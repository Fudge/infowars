[33:02.000 --> 33:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:32.000 --> 33:51.000]  Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, you are witnessing the rebirth of the American Republic back from the dead, 1776 part two, this time it's worldwide.
[33:51.000 --> 34:20.000]  I ended up going fishing and hanging out at the lake with my family yesterday and I didn't watch Trump's speech live, but I came in and I sat down and I had dinner and then all around me in the neighborhood as it got dark, the fireworks went off and Trump's speech from about two hours before reared on C-span.
[34:20.000 --> 34:46.000]  Now, I'd been home for about an hour and I'd gone and I had looked at dozens of headlines on YouTube, I'd turned on ABC, CNN, Fox, and it was all, well, was Trump right to do this and oh, critics say it's horrible, terrible speech and Phil Mudd says it's a disgrace on CNN.
[34:46.000 --> 35:01.000]  But I noticed in all the comments for NBC and CBS on YouTube, every comment was you're a disgrace, you hate America, you're undermining our president, you're pathetic, we see through you, I used to be a Democrat, now I'm not, every comment.
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.000]  And I sent these links to the producers last night, but guess what?
[35:06.000 --> 35:21.000]  They were gone, I went back to them last night and they were gone, CBS and NBC and others had pulled their YouTubes with headlines like critics, I'll just pull it up for you right now.
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.000]  I can even show you the YouTube links which are now dead, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:27.000 --> 35:42.000]  Now, why is this so big? They know that their attack on 4th of July and their boldness and their attack on Trump, when he didn't celebrate himself at all, celebrated America and our history and tried to bring us together.
[35:42.000 --> 35:51.000]  They know it's blowing up in their face and they don't know what to do.
[35:51.000 --> 36:00.000]  Here it is, Dr. McCamshot, please. Critics slam Trump's salute to America.
[36:00.000 --> 36:10.000]  Now, look at that. Critics slam Trump's salute to America.
[36:10.000 --> 36:24.000]  Now, what happens when you click that? The video has been removed by the user. You understand, I'm not just telling you this.
[36:24.000 --> 36:35.000]  So then, when I got in bed at about 10.30 at night, I lay awake for an hour with an iPad and I went to over 100 links and I have screenshots.
[36:35.000 --> 36:44.000]  I may do a whole special report this weekend and show just this. Of 100 plus hit pieces, over 70 were removed.
[36:44.000 --> 37:00.000]  Now, what does that tell you? It shows the media is very centralized. Somebody's calling the shots. It had a total backlash and so within three hours of when I saw it,
[37:00.000 --> 37:10.000]  I got in at about 7.15 or so. Trump had just finished his speech. The fireworks were coming up.
[37:10.000 --> 37:18.000]  I went cook dinner, hung out with the family. Michael Zimmerman was hanging out with us as well out of the lake house.
[37:18.000 --> 37:25.000]  They were staying at. One of our crew was there with us. We had steak and chicken and it was great.
[37:25.000 --> 37:38.000]  He cooked on the grill and I went in there and started seeing all the hate pieces and then I'm getting messages back from the producers.
[37:38.000 --> 37:49.000]  These videos are dead. They killed him. Now, again, that's a Rosetta stone. It's a window into all this, a fly on the wall.
[37:49.000 --> 37:57.000]  Boy, the hills have eyes. It's totally centralized and it backfired and they pulled it.
[37:57.000 --> 38:16.000]  And how big a story is that in and of itself that I clicked on over 100 headlines that were negative and mean from everything from Politico to the Washington Post to CNN to MSNBC to ABC News to NBC to CBS and they were all gone.
[38:16.000 --> 38:26.000]  I say all the comments. I probably only read 20, 30 comments deep on 10 or 15 of them, but it was all the same.
[38:26.000 --> 38:37.000]  And I told the producers, I said to print off all these comments and next time I've just got to print them then because they're now just getting rid of the video, getting rid of the comments because everyone is turning against them.
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.000]  We are reaching a collapse level moment for the globalist.
[38:42.000 --> 38:47.000]  Now, here's why I get frustrated. That's one little story of yesterday.
[38:47.000 --> 39:04.000]  I sat down this morning and wrote probably five pages of notes and then forgotten left at the house about angles I wanted to go with and clips I wanted to play and things I wanted to do because that's just one was how they were all negative.
[39:04.000 --> 39:13.000]  I pulled in the speech that was the worst thing they've ever seen. And when everyone rejected it, they pulled it off YouTube.
[39:13.000 --> 39:21.000]  Who has the centralized control? How big a story is that? How that it was all rejected? How beautiful is that?
[39:21.000 --> 39:28.000]  And that's what's happening everywhere. And that's why they're in so much trouble.
[39:28.000 --> 39:37.000]  The only place that I saw that didn't pull all of them was CNN. They pulled some saying it was a terrible speech and it was all about Trump. None of it was about Trump.
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.000]  So I saw CNN pull a few videos, but they didn't pull this one. Here it is.
[39:42.000 --> 39:50.000]  Well, let's see. Let me be subtle here. At a professional level, 25 years in national security, I hated it. At a personal level, I hated it more.
[39:50.000 --> 39:58.000]  Let me tell you something. When we're in the midst of July 4th after 9-11, when I was at the CIA, I thought we were celebrating the defense of ideals.
[39:58.000 --> 40:09.000]  The right to live free and fair, the right to live according to those documents that our founding fathers established, the right of every person, every citizen in this country to pretend like they can be president,
[40:09.000 --> 40:16.000]  the right to have economic opportunity. I didn't realize we were fighting for the chance to pay for guns, for weapons. I did national security.
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  I thought this was about ideals and now we've made it about the military.
[40:20.000 --> 40:28.000]  It goes on and on. I'll play it all later, but this is a guy that says they're going to kill the president. He's related to the Virginian.
[40:28.000 --> 40:37.000]  The only other person convicted of killing Lincoln, Dr. Mudd. That's where your name is Mudd. This guy's incredible.
[40:37.000 --> 40:49.000]  But it's Trump trying to pull us out of all these wars. It's Trump trying to do peace deals, not you, you little nasty neocon. Robert Mueller's protege, I should add, from the CIA into the FBI.
[40:49.000 --> 40:59.000]  We're going to go to break and come back with all of this, but I haven't hit the ritual Trump conducted yet, and I'm going to do it next segment.
[40:59.000 --> 41:16.000]  Come hook or crook, but it was absolutely incredible. Absolutely insane that they're attacking it and it just really shows you the two different sides here.
[41:16.000 --> 41:25.000]  Crystal clear and confirms everything we always knew about the left. They want our guns. They hate our country. They want to have sex with our children. They're just evil.
[41:25.000 --> 41:35.000]  And history shows that you go through these periods. We're going to go to break. This is the last few days of the save in full wars. Fourth of July, mega special.
[41:35.000 --> 41:45.000]  It will be ending coming up on Sunday. We're going to have some new specials next week. We're going to launch a special week broadcast.
[41:45.000 --> 41:55.000]  Extra shows either Wednesday or Thursday. We'll go for 36 hours live. I haven't decided yet, but I'll know about this afternoon. We're going to call that 1776 worldwide emergency transmission.
[41:55.000 --> 42:04.000]  A lot of special guests that's coming up next week because this is an incredible time to be alive. But right now we have the same info wars, info wars, live special.
[42:04.000 --> 42:15.000]  Fourth of July special and that is store wide free shipping, double patriot points in your next order and 50% off all the supplements and a bunch of other specials that I almost forgot.
[42:15.000 --> 42:28.000]  We're able to get t shirts printed and made in the US within one week. They are being printed today. The design is done. We have the Betsy Ross flag shirts, two different designs, two different colors.
[42:28.000 --> 42:37.000]  That's four different total shirts. Great red, white and blue Betsy Ross flag on the front since 1776 on the front under it and on the back.
[42:37.000 --> 42:46.000]  It says info wars and above it America is back. Both on the blue shirt, the navy shirt and the white shirt.
[42:46.000 --> 42:54.000]  So four different shirts. They are collectors editions just like the clown world. We're only printing 4,000 of these and when they're gone, they're gone.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  We're going to trigger a live tart and anti-American demon. This is the shirt.
[42:59.000 --> 43:12.000]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square. The other thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate trigger daddy.
[43:12.000 --> 43:18.000]  That's not backed by some billionaire. That's not being funded by secret foreign government. It is completely independent of all that.
[43:18.000 --> 43:28.000]  The old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country.
[43:28.000 --> 43:34.000]  They actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[43:34.000 --> 43:45.000]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear.
[43:45.000 --> 43:52.000]  The info wars audience has broken through that. They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[43:52.000 --> 43:59.000]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation, lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[43:59.000 --> 44:10.000]  We'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this. We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have through their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[44:10.000 --> 44:16.000]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year. We need to end here. We need to be provisioned.
[44:16.000 --> 44:20.000]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy.
[44:20.000 --> 44:26.000]  Fairly. I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin. I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[44:26.000 --> 44:30.000]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[44:30.000 --> 44:37.000]  That just brings more people here. So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds. I need gas. I need ammo politically now.
[44:37.000 --> 44:45.000]  But literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together.
[44:45.000 --> 44:52.000]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us.
[44:52.000 --> 44:59.000]  And I will never back down. You have my commitment. This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[44:59.000 --> 45:08.000]  I want to encourage everyone to take advantage of the huge July 4th specials we're running right through in the next weekend until they've got to stop.
[45:08.000 --> 45:17.000]  Storewide free shipping, 50% off all the award winning supplements and double Patriot points. That means on your next order, 10% off, not 5% off on the dollar.
[45:17.000 --> 45:22.000]  Designed for auto shipping, additional 10% off. Some of these products are lost leaders at those prices.
[45:22.000 --> 45:29.000]  X2, learn about why it's so special. How is the good at halogen? How is the missing link in the body? Find out about X2 at m4slife.com.
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  Rainforest Plus, super blue fluoride free toothpaste, 4 to 5 o'cloid silver and iodine.
[45:33.000 --> 45:42.000]  Turboforce, the great clean 10 hour energy, real red pill plus alpha power, super male vitality, the lung cleanse, the ultimate tumor formula bodies.
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.000]  Most of those are close to selling out. Some won't be back in for months. Many won't be back in for weeks.
[45:47.000 --> 45:55.000]  But regardless, fish oil for adults, for children, the very best out there. All of these are great products, books, films, t-shirts, water filtration, air filtration.
[45:55.000 --> 46:01.000]  That's what funds the M4 War and the big sales running right now at m4store.com.
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[46:03.000 --> 46:12.000]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades.
[46:12.000 --> 46:20.000]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this
[46:20.000 --> 46:25.000]  have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change.
[46:25.000 --> 46:35.000]  And they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[46:35.000 --> 46:45.000]  The M4 War's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[46:45.000 --> 46:52.000]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.000]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[46:55.000 --> 47:07.000]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[47:26.000 --> 47:35.000]  America is back. The bane of globalist communists, king pens and tyrants everywhere.
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  And it stands in the way of their corporate world government and their peace system.
[47:40.000 --> 48:00.000]  President Trump invoked Christ and God and our covenant, our birthright, our inheritance, our providence. As thunderstorms raged and swirled around the city, it did not pour down during the key events.
[48:00.000 --> 48:10.000]  During Trump's speech, within minutes of him exiting the stage, it began to pour rain again. Stuff of legend.
[48:10.000 --> 48:17.000]  Just like during the inauguration, as soon as he was done, rain began to pour. It's amazing.
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.000]  They tried to tell Trump to cancel it because it would look bad if it was pouring down rain in the middle of it.
[48:21.000 --> 48:31.000]  He said, no, we go ahead with it. There was that giant crowd. Some estimate a million. Many couldn't even get into there.
[48:31.000 --> 48:41.000]  Hundreds of thousands of them all. And CNN was running crop photos just like three years ago at the inauguration, saying there were small crowds there and huge demonstrations.
[48:41.000 --> 48:52.000]  Our reporters have video of only 20 people at the anti-Trump demonstration wearing communist shirts and the little stupid Trump balloon that the media focused on.
[48:52.000 --> 48:57.000]  But here is the battle hymn for the Republic.
[48:57.000 --> 49:11.000]  And if you watch this video at the live streams at infowars.com forward slash show, and if you see this, you see Melania with tears in her eyes and breathing and her chest rising, you see Trump about to break down crying.
[49:11.000 --> 49:22.000]  He also did it earlier when he talked about American innovation and going to the stars. You can see how much they love seeing America come back from the dead and stopping the demoralization of the people.
[49:22.000 --> 49:29.000]  So let's start rolling battle hymn of the Republic Christian song triggering the left massively.
[49:52.000 --> 50:04.000]  My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.
[50:04.000 --> 50:22.000]  He is stamping out the bingeage where the graves of rap are stored. He had lose the faith for life, he had misderebles with salt.
[50:22.000 --> 50:50.000]  This truth is marching on, Melania. Glory, Glory, Hallelujah. Glory, Glory, Hallelujah.
[50:50.000 --> 51:03.000]  And again, by the end of it, it continues on. And then after the song's over, as they're breaking up and the final jets are flying over, Trump is totally focused.
[51:03.000 --> 51:21.000]  Body language is off the chart, and he almost staggers off the stage, and you've got Lonnie up there just beaming the amount of emotion, the amount of focus, perfectly executed event. Remember, just seeing American flags makes the left run in fear.
[51:21.000 --> 51:35.000]  Only the last four years or so did this become complete. It was always there, but I learned it like globalist events and events attacking me that they had downtown called Trump and Alex Jones, the city held.
[51:35.000 --> 51:51.000]  When I showed up, I said, it's okay to love America. America's back. We should all come together. They went, ah, for an attacking and a guy ran up and said, I like to have sex with kids and started humping me. I mean, I'm not kidding.
[51:51.000 --> 52:07.000]  And then others are like, I love Satan. You have to experience these people and understand that it's literally an exorcism Trump was conducting. Good old fashioned Americana. If the country wasn't so much trouble, it'd be kind of cheesy.
[52:07.000 --> 52:22.000]  He realized maybe we'll fought and died for this nation, but the globalists want to conquer it and make us hate ourselves and only tell us about the bad things in our past. Like Betsy Ross was a famous abolitionist. She made the first American flag. She designed it in her head. Boom, made it.
[52:22.000 --> 52:36.000]  It's the most recognizable flag in the world. It's beautiful. She's an abolitionist. Thomas Jefferson wanted to be an abolitionist. But the point is they say, oh, it's from the past. It's bad. You can't have it. It's sick.
[52:36.000 --> 52:46.000]  In the beauty of the lilies.
[52:46.000 --> 52:55.000]  See the beauty. Christ was born. Christ was born. They hate that.
[52:55.000 --> 53:10.000]  Glory.
[53:10.000 --> 53:29.000]  Elsie died to make men holy. Let us die to make men free while God is marching on.
[53:29.000 --> 53:45.000]  That's it. You can go full screen with Melania. She is an ecstasy right there. That's the part. He's just getting tears in her eyes. Trump is she a tear. If you watch on HD, I went up right to the TV and looked at it. Tears come out of his eyes.
[53:45.000 --> 53:58.000]  Knowing that we're defeating the globalists with God's help. There's Trump squeezing back tears. He did it a couple times, even more intense during the speech.
[53:58.000 --> 54:20.000]  Melania, she is, that's the opposite of a power trip look. That is a real Christian right there. Realizing that we are invoking God against the evil standing against him. She spontaneously broke out with the Lord's prayer a few years ago.
[54:20.000 --> 54:30.000]  And again, America isn't perfect, but the evil hates it. He wants to control it and use it for world domination. The answer is no. F-18s fly over.
[54:30.000 --> 54:42.000]  Trump is in just absolute heaven because he knows how much the globalists hate this country and hate him and hate us.
[54:42.000 --> 54:54.000]  And in this song, if they say it's cheesy, we're going to move to North Korea. Or maybe Europe? We're one of the only countries where you can own guns. We're the only country where you can really own your property.
[54:54.000 --> 55:08.000]  And yeah, we've lost a lot of it. Do you know what? We're going to take it back. That's right. Once they take your pride in your country away, they've got you.
[55:08.000 --> 55:31.000]  You know what's taking the country over? World government, ruthless mega banks that have exploited the third world, not us. And now, 50 years of globalism is being reversed, like flushing a big toilet filled with leftist scum.
[55:31.000 --> 55:41.000]  Let's go full screen with this. Again, this is literally an exorcism of the left. We're moving it. Get behind me, Satan, the name of Jesus Christ.
[56:01.000 --> 56:22.000]  Yeah, you can say people overdo the Americana. I thought that too when I was growing up, even though I loved America. I thought, what is this America and this Texas stuff until you realize there's people that want to take it over and replace it with stuff absolutely evil.
[56:22.000 --> 56:32.000]  They want our children. They want our property. They want our guns. They want our souls. They want our names. They want our genetics. They want our seed. They want our soul.
[56:32.000 --> 56:41.000]  They're not going to get it. We're going to go to break and I'm going to get more into this second hour. We have a bunch of special guests in studio, but I've got so many of these clips we haven't played yet.
[56:41.000 --> 56:52.000]  This was this was amazing, but I know body language when I see it from the military personnel to the crowds. So I was watching in HD, man. And and it was the people were coming together.
[56:52.000 --> 57:04.000]  This was a healing ritual with Christ's name being said at least 10 times while I was watching invoking that holy name above all other names. The enemy is convulsing.
[57:04.000 --> 57:14.000]  And remember, they pulled 70 plus videos that I went and looked at with headlines, trashing Trump and the United States.
[57:14.000 --> 57:23.000]  It backfired and somebody said, this isn't working. Pull it, pull it, pull it. All of your plans will be defeated.
[57:23.000 --> 57:38.000]  The end. All the weapons you form against this will not prosper. Enemies know that know that you called for war. Now you shall reap the world when globalists remember we are listed supported only by you.
[57:38.000 --> 57:50.000]  We continue on and we have the new Betsy Ross. These colors don't run America's back info or shirts limited edition funding him for and get a great shirt.
[57:50.000 --> 58:02.000]  The time has come. The time is here. The globalists are openly activating their anti American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders and that the whole world could come here and get everything free.
[58:02.000 --> 58:11.000]  But that we, the citizens have to pay for it when our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy. If we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status.
[58:11.000 --> 58:21.000]  And the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and the US to collapse the countries to kill capitalism and bring in socialism.
[58:21.000 --> 58:29.000]  So we can go the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea and Venezuela. This is a plan. That's why we've got to stay on air. It's why you've got to keep fighting because we're going to win this in the end.
[58:29.000 --> 58:38.000]  Thanks to you and your support. That's what makes it all possible. So I salute you and I thank you. But I ask you again, do your shopping with us and we will continue on the face of this.
[58:38.000 --> 59:06.000]  So the Infowars model is a self fulfilling, self supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[59:06.000 --> 59:17.000]  The only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach, it is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self supporting, self sustaining, self structured, little d democratic structure.
[59:17.000 --> 59:25.000]  That because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting Infowars.
[59:25.000 --> 59:36.000]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that.
[59:36.000 --> 59:43.000]  And at the same time, support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[59:43.000 --> 59:53.000]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[59:53.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  July 5th, 2019, hour number two just kicked off on your host Alex Jones. You can certainly mark your calendars yesterday.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  20th 2017, I said mark your calendars. Trump's going to deliver or die trying this guy's for real.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  And I'm more sure of Trump now that I've ever been.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  Trump's 100% for real.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  He's like one of those people that comes from Christian background, but doesn't go to church a lot, but loves God, but thinks of mainline Christians as kind of hypocrites.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  But Melania is a very deep Christian. That's well known. And she's gotten him on the straight and narrow. Let me tell you.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  And he's really matured at 73 years old. He's really matured the last six, seven years. He said that during the campaign.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  He says, listen, I've changed a lot. I've grown a lot.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  And I've talked to a lot of preachers that prayed with Trump and I've talked to folks that are very close to Trump.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  And he's, he's had a real Christian conversion from being a Christian to really being one.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  And, you know, as they say in the cheesy Star Wars, the force is with him. Holy Spirit's with him because of Melania Trump, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  And there's no doubt the enemy is pulling their hair out. They do not know what to do and see Trump is into energy.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  And so in stuffy, fake churches and things, he never felt it, but in black churches and in southern churches and in others.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  I've had a conversation with Trump. He brings it up about the energy at that event. It was like a church. It's way, these churches, it's way better than a rock concert.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  The energy, the spirit. You feel it all? Yes, I do. Yes, sir. I feel the spirit. You feel the spirit get stronger, don't you?
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  You want to get that spirit even stronger? It's going to get stronger. I mean, this is spirit stuff, folks. This is 1776, the spirit of 1776 worldwide.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  And, and I, you know, I don't want to get metaphysical here with you, but I've decided I think at the 15 after I was driving into work this morning,
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  I was driving in from the Hill Country out of the lake to my house this morning and it really hit me that I should just go ahead and tell folks.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  But this is a spiritual war, ladies and gentlemen. And, you know, I used to think I was crazy when I was a little kid because you don't really call it the visions.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  It's just a knowing and of a job you've got to do. And then never even as you get older, even thinking about what you thought when you were a kid.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  And then once you're in college and things like that, forgetting when you were young, like four or five, six years old, God telling you you have a mission and then envisioning what was going to happen.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  And then later it happens and you look back and you say, that wasn't like Oprah Winfrey's The Secret where you just say something and it magically happens.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  It's all about destiny and providence and bloodlines and backgrounds and ongoing wars and God's plan and providence and you step into that.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  It's not that God's making things happen. God's put forward these different future roads and then you've got to choose the path you're going to go on.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  But the paths are predestined. People always get confused by Calvinist saying it's predestined, but we have faith and we have free will.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  Well, it's predestined if you take that road. And I just, it's incredible. I took the road of my ancestors. We've taken this road. You've taken this road and Trump has taken the road and it's real.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  And we have the keys to hell and death because of Jesus Christ. And we have power over Satan. But we have to exercise it.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  And Satan knows that and Satan's very real. Ladies and gentlemen, again, look at the planet. Look at the sun in the sky.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  All this stuff going on. All these evil people that go out of their way to hurt kids and poison people and demoralize and do bad things.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  And you look at how fallen these armies are. I looked up the New York Times writers that say America sucks and I looked up the Vox writers that say it sucked.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  I spent a lot of time, last few days, and Paul Watson wrote about it for him, FullWars.com and NewsWars.com. And you look at what these people look like.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  I'm going to show you some of them. I mean, if you were walking down a dark alley, you'd go the other direction if you saw all these people.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  It physically manifest. Not that they got a wart on their nose or a hunchback, but that they physically radiate evil.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  So it's all real. Heaven and Hell, interdimensional war. It's all here. Trump knows it and we are all in it.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity. There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  Order now at the InfoWars store. Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you for joining us on this live Friday worldwide broadcast.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Let us die to make men free while God is marching. Melania Trump tears in her eyes in ecstasy to see the country relaunched an evil now facing a renewed spirit of liberty and justice and love of Christ.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  Her lips trembling, her eyes on fire with liberty and the Holy Spirit, Trump next to his wife feeling it, having to purse his lips and hold back tears.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  And you look at HD, the tear comes out of his eye, knowing that they've tried to defy this nation, tried to crush it, tried to tear it apart, tried to conquer our souls, but they have failed.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  That's what you're watching on screen. And we have worked so hard, all of us together, old, young, black, white, from all over the world, 1776 worldwide, a renaissance against the globalists, a renaissance against the empires, the tyrants, the renaissance against those that want centralized systems of control.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  America is fighting back for its life. Evils try to take us over because we're so powerful as we had God. You see Trump and Melania in ecstasy, not in a power trip ruling over people, not with the demonic glow in their eyes like the Clintons or the Obamas, the evil chip on their shoulder.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  No, but a feeling of strength and coming together and building a future to the stars and innovation.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  Is there ever any question about Trump? Or ever any question about Info Wars? You know, ladies and gentlemen, by the enemy's response, we're real. Oh, we're senators, we're not perfect. We understand America's destiny. We understand that to let the Republic fall and let the globalists take over is a fate worse than death.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  I'll gladly stand up next to you. That's all of us together. There's no doubt, my friends. God bless the United States. That the Chinese flood with enough fentanyl to kill everybody.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  That Hollywood bombards the nastiest poison ever seen. Because America had mostly innovation in the world. And we're known all over the planet as the nicest, hardest working people. The best literature, the best art, the best machines, the best ships, the best science, the best medicine.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  The most honorable people you can count on. And now we become a satanic overrun system that kills its babies after they're born. Well, guess what? We're going to turn the tide against evil.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  And evil knows it. And so they're pouring out their evil upon us right now, hoping we just get overwhelmed and give up, hoping to demoralize us.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  But the tide is turning. And last night, I heard the enemy's back break even more. I don't have extra evasion to look into their soul, but I can tell you they're falling right now.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  But it's going to be rough. Human clones and chimeras already walk the streets. World governments have been established. They're already setting up systems to take full control.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Trump is blind to many things like 5G and other things. But in the end, we're establishing the country again. We're exposing the globalist. We're empowering the people.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  And we are identifying the enemies like the left. And so the tide is turned.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  And when you think about how the choice is so simple between the left that loves world government, that is allied with the chai comms, that hates our families, that hates God, that hates independence, and that tells us that we suck, and that humans should roll over and die, and that humans are a disease,
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  that's what the globalists are projecting onto you, what they think you are. Because in their own hearts, that's what they are.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  Powerful. And I'm just honored to be here with you. Let's go to some of these clips.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  Trump, when he got into John Paul Jones, got very, very emotional. When he got into the military, he got very, very emotional.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  He spent even more time talking about our soldiers fighting and dying in a civil war to try to write slavery and leading the world against tyranny and all of our innovations and having respect for ourselves and our shared experiences.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  So here's the President and the founder of the U.S. Navy, John Paul Jones.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  In October of 1775, the Continental Congress ordered the construction of two swift sailing vessels, each carrying 10 cannons and 80 men to sail eastward.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  Our young fleet tested their sea legs against the most powerful navy the world has ever seen.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  John Paul Jones, America's first great naval hero, said,
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast, for I intend to go in harm's way.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  He got his wish many times when his ship was shot into pieces off the coast of England by a British vessel and her four dozen guns.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  When demanded to surrender, Jones very famously declared, I have not yet begun to fight.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  When our navy begins fighting, they finish the job.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  You know, I said I was going to start that new podcast show on Saturday, and we've got to line up all the callers, because it's going to be a show about callers two hours, I think starting every Saturday, and then I'll let them start hosting it themselves.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  I'm going to do that next week, because this weekend, I haven't chosen the time, we need to come in and play the whole speech and stop it and start it and analyze it, because it's his biggest speech, his most powerful speech, and again, it's got the globalists shaking to their very core.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  And again, if they can get us to give up our birthright and to hate ourselves, they've won.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  And they can get us to hate our unborn babies, they've won, or our little babies after they're born, they've won.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  And I knew the Democrats were run by Satanists and pedophiles at the top, they're part of the globalist system. They're predators.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  But I want to explain something.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  Whenever we would say, oh, the Democrats hate America, they go, oh, you're picking and choosing, you're cherry picking. And I see that talking point on Info Wars by the establishment commenters.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  Oh, Jones is focusing on the extreme, saying the left hates America. I have hundreds of articles the last few days saying they hate America.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  Hundreds of news clips, I can't even watch them all saying it.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  No, you do hate America. And by the way, you do want our guns. Almost every Democratic candidate, he said, we're just going to confiscate them.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  And they have New York Times front page story saying time to repeal the Second Amendment, you want our guns, you support pedophilia, you want open borders, you think everybody should come here and get free stuff and bankrupt us.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  It's official. You are what we said you were.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  I read their own documents, I tracked what the foundations were pushing, what the globalist wanted, and people like, oh, that'll never happen. They'll never get that. Well, you know what, they're sure, as you know what, trying.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  Now, folks, we are launching another limited edition right now t shirt. We're only going to have 4,000 of these. There's four different variants, two different shirts in white and in navy blue.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  I'm very excited about it. It is the Betsy Ross flag, the first flag made by an abolitionist.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  Made by an American. She came with the designs, a beautiful flag or the most recognizable in history of not world history.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  And it's a white shirt on the front that has the flag in red, white and blue right across the chest big.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  And then under it says these colors don't run. On the back, it says America is back in full wars.com.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  There's another variant that says the Betsy Ross flag established 1776.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  And on the back, it says America is back in full wars.com. So two different variants, two different colors. That's four shirts.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  We're printing a thousand of each. The order was put in yesterday.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  The place where they make them in America is printing them now. They'll be shipped to us by next week, two weeks for delivery.

[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of it, okay?
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  I want to expand, not contract. And for six months, we've not been able to stand still.

[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  I like to be expanding. I like to be winning. I like to be fighting.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  And we are winning the info war. That's why we're so hated.

[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  We never have time to get into dry. We got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  Then they're really going to plant child porn on us. Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks and the Chai comms.

[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  I don't know about you, but Alania Trump just continues to impress a real lady, a real powerhouse.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  You know what Margaret Thatcher said, somebody's got to tell you they're a lady, they're not.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  Tears in her eyes, seeing the reboot of America, seeing the America haters that have run this country down,
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  having it rubbed in their face, seeing the people come together.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  Look at Trump, tears in his eyes.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  That's what it's all about.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  That's what it's about 18 hours a day when he kills himself to attack the enemy.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  Because he's got so much energy flowing through him, he can't help it.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  You know what folks, America won't be killed as easily as they thought.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  What does AOC do?
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  What does Hillary do?
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  What does CNN do?
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  They lie, and they lie, and they lie, and they cheat, and now they'll do anything.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  They'll do anything, but people know their lies.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  What's so exciting, as I said last night, is I typed in Trump into YouTube,
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  and every video for 10 pages deep was vicious attacks with headlines like,
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  Critics say it was terrible, Trump's horrible, Trump made it all about himself,
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  Public hates it, small crowds, and I clicked on dozens of them.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  I looked at the comments and every comment on the ones I clicked was just,
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  I'm done, you're pathetic, this was a great event.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  He didn't make it about himself, it made it about all of us coming together.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  I'm so proud of my country.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  You know, I used to be a liberal, but now I learn they really do hate America.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  They want us all to hate each other, to control us.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  I mean, the comments were all on fire.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  There were videos with 5,000 views, like the CBS one I showed you,
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  before they took it down, and there'd be 10,000 comments.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  And I looked at page after page after page, and I clicked the next one,
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  they're like, hey, the stakes are ready.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  You understand?
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  No one's buying their crap, except people like this guy.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  I've got a stack of censorship news of us and others being censored.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  And I've got a stack of the type of people that hate America,
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  and when you look at these people, they look so evil,
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  like when you see the hillside strangler, and he looks totally satanic.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  And you're like, my God, that guy's demon-possessed,
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  and he turns his hand around, there's a pentagram in it.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  Evil people who are demonically-possessed look like jack-o'-lanterns.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  And I want to show you some of these individuals.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  I've got so many of these.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  Can you guys pull up the headline from newswars.com or infowars.com?
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  It's, what's his name?
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  Vox Reporter says the U.S. would have been better off staying with England.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  And you look at the guy, and you look at what he's saying.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  Yeah, look at this guy.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  Look at this guy.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  Now, Vox celebrates Fourth of July by seeing the American Revolution was a mistake.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  Let me explain something.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  Every reporter they've had on me from BuzzFeed or any of these places looks like this.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  Whether it's a woman or a man, put him back on screen please.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  And blow up his face for people.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  He's got a face that's more evil than Brian Stelter's.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  Full screen please.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  Now, think about that.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  And you look at him.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  He's got this satisfied, evil, creepy, dirty, oily look.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  And then I Googled his name in more photos.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  Each one looks more creepy after the next.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  He's got this ingenuousness of him.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  And again, this is a guy on July 4th telling you how much America sucks.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  And you wouldn't let that guy clean your toilets.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  You wouldn't let him work on your pool.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  You wouldn't let him get anywhere near your children.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  I mean, he's ready to be in Hellraiser without makeup.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  And these are the people that hate civilization and hate society
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  and want to just pull it all down and wreck it.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  When I find out the stack, I'm going to get to it because I've got a whole stack of news here.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  Take Caitlyn Bennett.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  Take Caitlyn Bennett.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  Yeah, I mean, there he is.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  Take Caitlyn Bennett.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  Seven months ago, she posted a photo of herself wearing an infowars.com t-shirt.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  Facebook owns Instagram.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  They took it down on July 4th.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  There's a picture of her with American flag behind her and the info wars in your face t-shirt,
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  which is just bright red on a navy blue background.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  And they told her, you do that again.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  We're going to take you off of Instagram.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  It's a thought crime that they said two months ago, you can't say Alex Jones's name
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  or have a positive mention of info wars.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  How are we in this that people say, oh, Alex, it's okay.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  You'll still sell your shirts.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  It's not about me selling shirts.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  It's about the fact they have AI scanning computers scan the Internet and they find photos.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  They're telling everybody and their dog to take down info wars.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  And now they're saying they want the American flag taken down and they want the Betsy Ross flag taken down.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  And Nike took it off.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  That's where this is going.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  And the Chinese government wants Winnie the Pooh taken down because the Chinese make fun of the leader as Winnie the Pooh.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  They say he talks like Winnie the Pooh in Chinese.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  And oh, now they don't want Taiwan, these flags.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  So Apple and Google are complying to not have those.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  You see, it's info wars today.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  It's everything else tomorrow.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  Here's some of the articles on censorship.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Wikipedia co-founder Slam Zuckerberg, Big Tech, for appalling Internet censorship.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  Says they can control what you see.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  And he says they're censoring everybody.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  They're creating a whole false reality.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  This isn't an Internet.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  This is a captive Internet, info wars.com.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  Here it is.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  Instagram removes American flag photo because it showed info wars t-shirt.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  Again, info wars.com, news wars.com.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  Teen who said there are only two genders expelled from school go fund me shut down.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  We're going to show you that video.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  Big Pharma now with Big Tech won't allow any criticism of any of their drugs.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  If anybody gets hurt, you can't say any drug hurt you in a consumer report.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  They're basically banning Yelp.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  The same Communist Party group that sued me after flag burning in Cleveland.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  The suit got thrown out, by the way.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  Never heard about that in the news, though.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  They sued me when I wasn't even there.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Well, they're the same group that lit one up, was flinging it around, and they got arrested
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  for the dangerous thing that did not for burning the flag.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  That's all up on info wars.com.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  Oh, and France now moves to make companies block hate speech worldwide, AP.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  See, because Trump won't act to say, you can't censor Americans, France is coming into the vacuum.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  That's coming up.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  We're going to take your calls as well.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  Leo Zagami's here.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  More clips of the president, and so much more, but whatever you do.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  Get the article out showing how huge the crowd was, and the media saying it wasn't large.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  It's at infowars.com, newswars.com, and drugsreport.com.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  America's back.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  America's back.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  It's easy.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  Click Amazon or Walmart, and search today for Sunny Bay.
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people,
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements,
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  and that if you go back five, six years ago before all the censorship and attacks
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  and how they were the best and why they were,
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us,
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  or they'll shut us down. The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements,
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  Jones sells unapproved supplements, and he claims they're supplements.
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them,
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  and manipulate it and do different things, and a lot of drugs work great.
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature.
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder,
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  and I feel your love in my heart.
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  I want you to know that love is right back at you,
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  and I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  and your financial support, because I'm committed to fight to the end,
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  but I want to win, and without you, I'm going to be destroyed,
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  and it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  The enemy could win.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  We're being used by God. You're being used by God.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  This is providence, so I salute you,
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  The time has come. The time is here.
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders,
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  and that the whole world could come here and get everything free,
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  but that we, the citizens, have to pay for it.
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy,
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  if we don't have major innovation and major booms,
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  we will collapse into third world status,
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  in Europe and the U.S. to collapse the countries,
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  to kill capitalism, and bring in socialism
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  so we can go the way of the Old Soviet Union, North Korea, and Venezuela.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  This is a plan. That's why we've got to stay on air.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  It's why you've got to keep fighting, because we're going to win this in the end.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  Thanks to you and your support, that's what makes it all possible,
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  so I salute you, and I thank you, but I ask you again, do your shopping with us,
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  and we will continue on in the face of this.
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  I believe in you. I don't think you're stupid.
[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  One man and the ranks of women, all genitals are cut off,
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  and we're kicking these trainers' asses politically,
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  and we're not backing down at her.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  I want to get these people. We're winning.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  I can feel the spirit rising. Can't you?
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  We have broken their back. Yes, I can feel it.
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  Let's go.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  Vengeance is coming. Fire is coming.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  The real revolution against you is coming,
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  and you will burn in hell.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  As he dies to make men holy,
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  let us die to make men free,
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  while God is marching on.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Info Wars was the detonator to relaunch America,
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  1776 worldwide.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  We did it, and the fight's just begun, but we did it.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  I've got a feeling we're going to win this war with Christ help.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  Leo Zagami's the best-selling author,
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  research a real expert on the inner workings of the Vatican,
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  P2 Lodge, Mason's, and so much more.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  He's riding shotgun with us into the fourth hour.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  Paul Watson joins us as well.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  Robert Barnes is going to spend about a week or month with us here.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  He's leaving today, but he'll be with us some in the fourth hour
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  and third hour as well.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  But I want to get more into these clips from Trump,
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  and Leo Zagami's take on how historic this is,
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  but it's kind of fitting that Leo came here Wednesday
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  and he said, I brought you a bottle of champagne
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  that was very expensive in all the news in Italy
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  when Trump won three years ago.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  And so he brought me a bottle of it.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  In fact, the decorative box is right over there on that desk.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  If somebody could bring it to me out of the dark over there.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  And I was kind of like, well, what are we going to celebrate?
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  Well, just the fact that Trump's in there.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  But now that after this Fourth of July speech,
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  that's his biggest yet, the way the left demonized it,
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  lied about it, said it was all about him when it wasn't,
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  how well it was received while they're trying to ban the American flag
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  and trying to do all of this, this is a very good time to celebrate.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  So I don't normally have champagne at 12.30 noon.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  I actually don't really drink much these days.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  But in celebration of this, I am more than happy to do this
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  with Leo Zagami and his lovely wife, who's here.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  So in a minute, she'll have to come up and share out of your glass.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  I've only got two glasses here, Leo Zagami.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  But what would you call this historical time we're in right now?
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  It's a time of real renaissance.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  It's a time of getting back what was taken from us.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  And we were in Italy, the first organization to believe in Trump
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  before he became president with Italian...
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  Four years ago when he was first running,
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  I met with you in Italy again.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  You said he's going to win.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  He's like Berlusconi, who I know you're friends with,
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  and you were explaining it all to me.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  Yeah, and I hope it doesn't make any compromises
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  that unfortunately Berlusconi in the end had to make.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  And that is the only thing I fear.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  But at the moment he's actually delivering what he promised.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  And so I'm very happy to bring this bottle,
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  which was presented to the Italian press on the 20th of January 2017
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  in Palazzo Feraioli and in front of the American Embassy
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  at the Galleria Salustiana.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  This is a bottle which is handcrafted by the master glassmakers in Venice
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  with a layman of gold on top of it.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  It is a very complicated process to make it,
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  and each bottle is handcrafted differently.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  And so it was the perfect gift.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  It was never opened.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  We presented it to the press on the 20th of January 2017, Alex,
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  and everybody in Italy had seen it, but the bottle stayed intact.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  So now we are about to open it to celebrate finally this great moment
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  of American renaissance that thanks to Donald J. Trump yesterday we had.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  By the way, I've been there with you for over 10 years.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  None of your work for 17, 18 years, read a lot of your books
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  and thought, well, this can't be true,
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  but then everything you predicted came true
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  about how you'd have two popes, how they start serving terms.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  Now they're announcing that.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  I mean, you got your finger on the pulse
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  and you were able to give a special tours of the Vatican
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  because it's corrupt, but a lot of people in it don't like what's happening.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  So there's different factions.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  So there's not many bottles of this.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  No, and the guy who presented it with me to the press
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  is Antonio Maria Rinaldi,
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  who is now the economist of the League,
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  has been elected to the European Parliament.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  And so he's the most popular guy after Salvini in Italy,
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  Antonio Maria Rinaldi.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  And I'm glad that we can bring you this gift
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  to demonstrate that there is some true patriots also in Italy.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  Tell me about the company itself.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  Well, of course, this is a company that makes luxury bottles only.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  A bottle like this costs 2,000 euros.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  That means approximately $2,500.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  Wow.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  So we are about to open a very expensive bottle,
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  which I advise you to keep for posterity because...
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  Oh, I will.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  I've never had a 2,000 bottle of anything.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  I'll take $100 as fancy for me at a wedding or something.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  All right, well, this is a big deal.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  And I have to thank also the people at the Fiumicino Airport,
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  my friend Andresi Nini, who came to pick us up outside of the airport
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  and brought us through the VIP line so we could avoid any control.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  That's why you're not allowed to bring liquor or alcohol into a country.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  Well, especially a luxury thing, like a brand like this one,
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  because if you go and check on the Internet the name of this brand,
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  which is Moristrico...
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  So why did Journey to get this here to us?
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  Yes, yes.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  Wow.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  It was perfect.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  One bottle of this, this all exists.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  That's it.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  Well, thank you, Giozigami.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  All right, well, we got to have your wife drink out of this first here.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  So let's get her up here.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  Tell us who this lady is.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  They've been with her for a long time.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  It's Christi, my wife, who has endured a lot of hardships back in Italy
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  with my persecution, of course.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  And we know the left-wing judicial.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  Kamala, they've sued you.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  They've arrested you.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  Same stuff they're doing to me.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  Same stuff.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  And at the end, I gave up, though.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  I just fled the country.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  Come on up here, sweetheart, with your husband.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  Stand right beside him, yeah.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  This is Christi.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  Let's do a wide shot, guys.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  I don't want to scare the dog.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  I'm going to pop the champagne, OK?
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  The dog is there.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  Here's to the Renaissance worldwide against the globalists, to nationalism, Christianity,
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  to the family, and to just all basic, you know, classical things that we know are good
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  at work.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  Here's to men.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  Here's to women.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  Here's to families.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  Here's to children.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  Here is to God, number one, and Jesus Christ's son.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  There you go.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  All right.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  And this is good.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  After yesterday's speech, I feel like some champagne.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  Yeah.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  We got beautiful.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  Thank you.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  You bet.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Me and Christi are going to share our glass together as a group.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  I should have taught you three glasses.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  No worries.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  No worries.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  And again, folks, a celebration to all of you out there and making it all possible.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  Cheers.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  There's the victory.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  Victory.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  OK.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  I think I'm supposed to see Rachel.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  You drink the best.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  I drink the best, always.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  How is it, Alex?
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  It's a French accord.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  That's the best champagne I ever drank.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  Yeah.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  It's actually worth for the money.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  I don't know, man.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  It should have been.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  It was in the refrigerator.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  Not even cold enough.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  It should have been nice.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  I'm not just lying.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  It's super brute and dry.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  Both an incredible mixed sweet flavor at the end.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  This is unbelievable.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  It's nice.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  Very nice.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  A French accord.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  And one of the things.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  Wow.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  It's also rich.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  I've never had.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  I know it's only champagne.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  It's from France.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  I've never had a sparkling wine this good.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  This is almost like you get what you pay for.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  What?
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  Most of the time, unfortunately, this kind of sparkling wines from
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  going in the hands of the mega rich, you know, the billionaires.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  This is what the globalists are drinking on those yachts.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  Yes.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  That's what they're.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  But this time.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  God bless you, brother.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  Here's the president, Trump.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  Oh, and Melania.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  She.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Well, I want her to run for president.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  Yeah.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  Yeah.
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  Let's repeal the amendment that foreign born can't be president for her.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  But haven't the amendment only for her.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  I'm very glad to be here with my wife.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  Absolutely beautiful.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  I was with Melania.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  The fact that they are both ex models.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  And so it's a coincidence.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  But also we like fine ladies.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  And you have also fine wife, which I met when you were not even, I think, married yet.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  So that was a great opportunity for me to meet your wife in the making.
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  She was a very nice lady.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  So thank you very much for coming to Rome back then because you actually spired the Italians
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  for Trump and Trampiani d'Italia to take the first step in putting together a project
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  with Giuliano Ferramonti, Alfredo Esposito and Antonio Maria Rinaldi.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  And now Brexit and Trump has inspired a nationalist anti globalist is now your president.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  He's leading the fight to break up the euro.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  To break up the euro and Antonio Maria Rinaldi, the economist of the league is one of the
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  people who is trying to put together an alternative currency or some other alternative ways of
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  escaping the euro technocratic imposing.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  And again, they call themselves technocrats.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  Leo Zagami is our guest.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  We're going to come back and get into Trump's incredible speech and so much more.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  The battle is joined.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  Real history is taking place.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  And this celebration is all about you, the listeners and viewers.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  My hats off to you.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  Thank you.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  You're incredible.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  or legal for their illicit activities over two decades.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public in the
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  to their course of conduct.
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  Otherwise they will never change.
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  And they will become the Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  century, who ran American politics and ran American economy, almost into the ground until
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  The inforward's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world,
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  of an independent free press.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other, to try to meddle
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  Even it is what you just saw.
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  Super special.
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  Emergency special.

[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  We need the funding.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  Thank you for your support.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  A lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  We're not going to back down.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  The other thing that's unique about inforwards is it isn't the only network of this reach
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  That's not backed by some billionaire.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  That's not being funded by secret foreign government.
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  It is completely independent of all that.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  It is an old school, American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  like this because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who have been able to control and manipulate
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  And the inforwards audience has broken through that.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  freedom.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation,
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  Well, we're very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  mega-council we have, do their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  We need to end here.
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  We need to be provisioned.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  fearlessly. I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  That just brings more people here.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  And I need war bonds.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  I need gas.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  I need ammo politically now.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  But literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  We're unstoppable together.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that they're
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and I will never back down.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  You have my commitment.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  about this.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  The Alex Jones show.
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  Well, the crew is in there enjoying the rest of the champagne and they tried it and Gary
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  and others agreed.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  Best champagne they've ever had.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  We don't normally drink on the job, but I think between eight or nine of us, we can all have
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  a half a glass.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  Leo Zagami, you, your wife, awesome folks.
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  I'm going to get into meat and potatoes now and also take some calls in the next hour
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  specifically on Trump's Fourth of July speech.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  The insane leftist response.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  Leo Zagami, again, best selling author from Italy, now here in the U.S. as an exile, a
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  real exile, a real political prisoner escaped.
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  I don't know if you've been able to follow it, but the left literally attacks before
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  the July attacks the American flag says America sucks.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  There should be a bigger backlash against these people, but when you look at all the
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  comments in newspapers and on YouTube, everyone is against them and saying how dare you.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  And I noticed all these videos got pulled by CBS, ABC, NBC attacking Trump and attacking
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  the Fourth of July.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  I think they realize that they've gone too far.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  What would you call this hating of your own nation?
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  I know the globalists are doing it to get us ready to get rid of our sovereignty just
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  like the Euro tells people to hate their countries inside Europe.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  U.S. used to be the greatest democracy with this.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  Of course you have two parties and they oppose each other in a democratic way, but now they
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  went too far.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  And so they criticized the essence of America.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  And that's not right, Alex, because they're criticizing even the declaration of independence
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  ended up as a hate speech at one point on Facebook.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  I mean, we are in a situation whereby the left wing has lost the plot and wants to
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  transform the United States of America in a socialist slash communist country.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  This is not America.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  I used to say a song back in the days by, I remember, David Bowen, Pat Metin.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  And definitely this is not America the way it was born.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  So I hope that the rise that went too far is, of course, backlashing.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  They know already that they will probably lose the elections in 2020.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  And now they will have to recover.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  And I don't know how they're going to recover ever from all this.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  Because the party, as I said, went one step too far into the realm of socialism.
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  We have been fighting for many years here in the US during the Cold War, the evil ideology of communism.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  How is possible that now there is parts of America that embrace all that?
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  It's again 51% in a Gallup poll of millennials want communism.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  But then they're wearing $200 jeans that they've got $1,000 smartphones.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  They'll pull up their communist events in new Jaguars.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  It's insane.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  What they really want is total political power.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  As your TV viewer, you see Roger and I toasting champagne when Trump won election night in November 2016.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  But everybody said, why are you so upset?
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  And I said, I feel a disturbance in the force.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  They're going to really come after us now.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  And they know that Roger and I in this audience were pivotal and critical in getting Trump elected.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  And I said, get ready.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  Trump's going to have to protect us.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  I don't think he'll be able to.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  And Roger said, he's going to be the president.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  And I said, no, there's a deep state.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  They're undermining him.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  Obama's going to leave stay-behind networks behind.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  And Roger respected me back then.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  But after it all came true, he's like, how do you know all this?
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  Who are your contacts?
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  I've been in politics 45 years.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  Nobody told me this.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  And I said, Roger, it's a different climate.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  I've studied how the globe was to operate in other countries.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  Like in Italy, they put stay-behind networks in as well.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  And so that's what we have as a civil war in the government.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  You see, the stay-behind networks we had in Italy were anti-communist.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  The moment they actually stopped operating, that's when the left took over.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  Exactly.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  These are leftist stay-behind networks.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  Yes, these are leftist stay-behind networks.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  And of course, part of it is in Antifa and all those left-wing organizations like sponsored by Soros.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  And it's all linked also to the Catholic Church with Jesuits that are promoting this legal immigrants
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  and facilitating their arrival, even with the Bishop of Santa Fe.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  We swam only last week.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  Taking illegal aliens across the border.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  We're going to talk about that and how to stop that game plan.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  And we've got all these other Catholic bishops in the U.S. saying, don't have open borders.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  So there's definitely a civil war in the church.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  But I want to say this, to the good stay-behind networks of peaceful nationalists and patriots for 50 years,
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  Mary Goldwater, and of course, Mr. Welsh, and to Cleon Scousen, and to Ron Paul.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  We've been the real stay-behind networks.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  Info Wars has been the latest wave, the vanguard popularizing it.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  But we're the stay-behind networks to fight globalism once it took over, believing people will want to fight back.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  The audience, you were all part of an American 1776 stay-behind network to stop the globalist.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  And we are now on the offense, like the French resistance, winning with our beachhead,
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  our magnificent beachhead, that's Donald John Trump.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  So here is to the stay-behind network. Here is to the real resistance.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  Salute you all.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  Tell folks more about the stay-behind networks.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  Well, I entered the military in 1989 because in Italy everybody had to do one year of military back then.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  It was obligatory. And during my time in the Air Force, I was recruited by Gladio,
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  which was actually in the last, let's say it was almost the end of their operations,
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  because at that point the Soviet Union was fading.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  And when it faded, then Gladio was the sponsorship that came from the U.S.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  Because you have to understand that people like, for example, Lyscio Gelli of the P2 Lodge received approximately 10 million dollars a month to fight communism.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  Of course, a lot of things that were done were also, I mean, draconian, they were not always good things,
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  because when they started to get into the strategy of tension from the end of the 60s into the 70s, Italy became a hell, became a hell zone,
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  in which they started to explode bombs, innocent people died.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  And all this was to stop the takeover of the communist agents that were infiltrating.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  And of course, Steve Pacinic was involved.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  And actually, he was really important during the kidnapping of the Prime Minister Aldo Moro.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  It was Kissinger who apparently orchestrated the kidnapping of Aldo Moro,
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  because he wanted to bring this alliance between the Christian Democrats and the communists together.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  And that will have already brought us to the level we are now.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  If it became a reality back then, that alliance is called cattocommunism.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  In Italy, actually, there's a movement that was born gradually from the 50s onwards called cattocommunism.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  And cattocommunism means mixing catholicism with communism, which usually don't go together.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  But that's what the new pub's been doing.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  Yeah, now it's evident that this cattocommunism is quite successful for all the liberals.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  They like the Pope because the Pope is totally left-wing, is totally pushing all their agendas together.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  And you have Joe Biden who met last year in the Vatican with all these important people.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  And the Vatican paid for him to have his conference there.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  And there was a lot of things.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  And I had the leftist arm of the Vatican funding Georgetown's suing me.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  Georgetown University's suing me for the fact that we pointed out that George Soros was funding Antifascist.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  George Town, of course, is the Jesuits.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  That is really the place in which the Jesuits recruit all their future agents like the Clintons.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  So George Town, of course, wants to sue you, wants to ruin you, but because we have started criticizing Pope Francis very heavily here.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  As you remember, Alex.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  As soon as I started criticizing him, all hell broke loose.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  Yeah, that's it. You had Obama in your case.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  You had everybody attacking you because you can't mention the Vatican.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  You can't mention the Pope.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  Imagine Bernie Sanders arrived in Rome begging to meet the Pope.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  Just begging because he said, oh, but Joe Biden had this big event and I didn't even meet the Pope.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  Let me meet him. In the end, they made him meet the Pope.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  He was coming out of his morning mass just quickly so he could finally have a talk with him.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  So Bernie Sanders, who is, of course, a communist.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  And now we had this meeting yesterday.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  Vladimir Putin.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  Stay there. Let's talk about this when we come back, folks.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  Remember, they're coming after us.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  That's how we get funded is by your support.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  The new Betsy Ross flags in navy blue and in white that say these colors don't run on the front on the back.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  America's back in full wars.com.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  You don't know how this will trigger Lib Tards in your area and how it will enthuse patriots in your area.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  Another version that says since 1776 under the flag, but on the back, the shirt is the same.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  It says that America's back in full wars.com.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  This is a sexy shirt.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  It's an awesome shirt.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  It's an exciting shirt and it funds this operation.
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  It's limited edition.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  We're printing a thousand of each.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  So 4,000 of these.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  Two different variants, two different shirts, two different messages, but two different colors.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  So it's a total of four.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA-2533139.
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  And this weekend's the last weekend to get store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points and 50% off all the supplements.

[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  There is no longer any doubt.
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  Multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted violent, Maoist-style overthrow of the U.S.
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  Our borders are being totally collapsed.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  Already-born babies are being killed.
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:57:59.000]  World government is here.
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:01.000]  Now is the time for decision.
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  Now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're on.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  And if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are banning the American flag
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  and attacking the family and that are attacking our borders and our country and our military and our heritage,
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  if you want to defend that, then now is the time to take action.
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  And that means word of mouth about this broadcast.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  And that means buying products at Infowarsstore.com.

[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus here on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City.
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  And one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[1:59:46.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  All right, this is going to be a jam-packed third hour that Paul Watson's coming up.
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  Robert Barnes is in the other studio.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  We've got Leo Zagami here in the United States from Italy.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  Talk about Inside Baseball.
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  This guy knows this stuff as you were just witnessing and as you were just hearing.
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  But first, this clip of Democrats literally hating on the existence of America itself to let you know they work for the globalist.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  They should be totally rejected.
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  They tell us we shouldn't even have a fourth of July.
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  They hate the American flag.
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  Here it is.
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  When I hear these things about, let's make America great again.
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  I think to myself, well, exactly when did you think America was great?
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  We're not going to make America great again.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  It was never that great.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  There's things that are savagely wrong in this country.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  What we're seeing in this country doesn't reflect our spirit.
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  What we're seeing in this country doesn't reflect our potential.
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  Yes, we're supposed to be for 70% tax rate on the wealthy.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  You hear folks say there's not enough money.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  What I say to them every single time is there's plenty of money in this world.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  There's plenty of money in this country.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  It's just in the wrong hands.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  We're in late phase capitalism and we know it doesn't work and we've got to move into something new.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  And I believe in community ownership of land, labor resources and distribution of those resources.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  And so whatever that morphs into, I think is what will serve community the best.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  And I'm excited to usher it in by any means necessary.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  Any means necessary.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  This liberal will be all about socializing.
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  We'll be about basically taking over and the government running all of your companies.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  Raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border without documentation.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  Can we keep the hands up so we can see them?
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  Those people who are online making fun of members of Congress are this grace.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  And there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable.
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  We're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  So folks, look, if you start off with a notion there's nothing you can do, well might y'all go home then, man?
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  Or let's start a real physical revolution if you're talking about it.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  A so-called anti-fascist website is encouraging, quote, all manner of physical violence against Trump supporters and capitalists.
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  Today we are lifting up these stories in the homes that you will see, the lights.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  And if you don't, we will bring the fire.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  After arriving in the emergency room I had a CT scan which confirmed that I was diagnosed with a brain hemorrhage.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  Coming up, Robert Barnes is in the other studio, Leo Zagami here, but Leo wanted to show you this.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  It's a unique moment of, as I said before, earlier of renaissance.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  Re-renaissance, renaissance means...
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  It felt like 2.0 July 4th.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  Renaissance means...
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:42.000] ...means taking back your sovereignty.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  It means taking back your sovereignty with respect to this new world order that instead wants to globalize everything and send us into this communist nightmare, so...
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  I really feel like I should be smashing this class if you do really special things, that's what you gotta do.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:11.000]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up,
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting Infowars.
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:57.000]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[2:05:57.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  But that's not why Bob's here all the time. He likes coming on the show and I like Bob. He's my buddy. He's a friendly, funny guy.
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  He was out there with me and my kids and Zimmerman's a friend, cooking steaks and everything out with my wife at the lake, out there fishing, two of my children are at camp,
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  but my other children, my son and my youngest daughter were there and Barnes was there and we got back off the lake.
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  We were cooking steaks, had dinner, fireworks were going off. We saw the speech from two hours before of the president.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  We were all particularly blown away, I thought. I mean, I really, really, really, really, really liked it.
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  And so we're going to be getting Robert Barnes' take on that here in just a few minutes, but going back to Leo Zagami, author, researcher, Leo Zagami.com.
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  I want to become American because Donald J. Trump is the president. If he was another president, I will probably renounce to this idea.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  But the fact that Donald J. Trump is the president forced me to become American because he's the only president in the world that is opposing globalism.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  You understand, Alex? He's the only one. I mean, he might not be the perfect president, but he's doing a great job.
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  Well, he's not a dictator. I mean, I've got a hundred employees and they're all great people, but it's hard to get them all going in one direction.
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  He's facing mutiny. He's facing all this resistance. We're going to get Barnes' take on that in a moment.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  But speaking of Trump, let's play a clip of him, about a three-minute clip, getting into innovation and trailblazing.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  And the American spirit of excellence. At one point, he gets tears in his eyes. Here it is.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, crossed the continent, harnessed science, took to the skies, and soared into the heavens.
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  Because we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free.
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same almighty God.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  From the banks of the Chesapeake, to the cliffs of California, from the humming shores of the Great Lakes, to the sand dunes of the Carolinas,
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  from the fields of the heartland, to the Everglades of Florida, the spirit of American independence will never fade, never fail, but will reign forever and ever and ever.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage. Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  It is the chronicle of brave citizens who never give up on the dream of a better and brighter future, and it is the saga of 13 separate colonies that united to form the most just and virtuous republic ever conceived.
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  On this day, 243 years ago, our founding fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to declare independence and defend our God-given rights.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  All right, folks, we're going to come back to more of the 1776 relaunch of the country, but what does America mean to you, Robert Barnes, and then Leo Zagami? For me, Gutenberg Press, the Renaissance, coming out of the Dark Ages, and the flower of the Renaissance was America,
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  and people all running to here to really try to establish freedom. Didn't mean we were perfect, but there was really the ethos of that plan that's now led the world, and there are those, the modern technocracy, who are authoritarians who seek to discredit the liberalism of the West
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  by posing as liberals themselves who are really left-hand path occultic leftists who seek to overthrow the classical liberalism that they would call right-wing extremism, that they've really, like, the thing taken over America and then posed as if they were the institutions.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  But I see this as a revolution, returning those institutions back to the people, and that's why we're seeing the convulsions.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  No doubt about it. I mean, you look at sort of America and Christianity did not start slavery, it ended it.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  America as a country, as an idea, as an actual government, and Christianity came together to not only end slavery, but they didn't start segregation or racial oppression that long predated them, but it was one of the first countries to end it and to get rid of it.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  So America has taken the lead at ending almost every mechanism and method of oppression in the world, whether it be ruled by royalty, whether it be ruled by elites, whether it be empires built on ceaseless wars, women's suffrage.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  Exactly, human suffrage, whether it be slavery, whether it be racial oppression, any of it. America has been at the lead, Christianity has been at the lead of making the world a better, safer, stronger place for the world.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  And that's what Trump was going through, one by one, all the different examples in such a tiny time period from a historical contextual perspective.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  And over just 200 years, one country took the lead in lighting the flame of liberty for everybody around the world in a wide range of contexts, whether it be war, whether it be suffrage, whether it be oppression, whether it be political power, whether it be economic power, whether it be social power,
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  whether it be science, whether it be exploring space, whether it be exploring the world, did so in little d-democratic ways that made the world more democratic economically, politically, socially, and culturally.
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  And did so by recognizing its religious foundations, did so by recognizing its spiritual roots, did so by recognizing its political orientation, and did so by recognizing the traditions of its fathers and its forefathers.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  And that's what the president was proud of and rightfully proud of, because America as a country has more to be proud of than any country in the world by far, not only as of this time period right now, but as in looking at time over all of the course of history.
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  That's right. And let's be clear. You just knocked it out of the park. That was a grand slam, if there ever was one, of veritas.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  We have become exceptionally evil in some respects, because with great power comes great responsibility, as Lord Acton said, power tends to corrupt.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  Absolute power corrupts absolutely. So we've had great power, and so evils come and tried to take over.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  So now we're a paradox of incredible good, innovation, and love, but also incredible evil. And there's a fight now over the soul of America.
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  And Trump, I see this as a ritual, an exorcism of the evil, of the hate of the left, and Trump knows it's a ritual.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  Melania knows it's a ritual. And as I sat there last night on that HDTV, watching her with tears in her eyes, Trump with tears in his eyes, I knew my gut was always right.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  The enemy's response tells you Trump's good, but this was a magic moment. We'll come back to you, Robert Barnes, powerful things he just said, Leo Zagami.
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  Getting back to the American dream, it was becoming a nightmare with the Clinton era, the Bush era, it was becoming a nightmare.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  They were there to demoralize us. Yeah, of course. And now we can dream again, because the world needs America dreaming again.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  We need to be able to dream something. Dreaming of aircraft, dreaming of science, dreaming of freedom, dreaming of free speech.
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  Without the dream, we are as a species, as a human race. We will not have posterity. We will not have envisioned the great things that America has offered us.
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  Because dream is vision. Yeah. And dream also is you create those images and in magic, for example, is connected to the word imago, which is image.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  So you imagine things and then you put them into reality. But if you don't imagine them, they will never come into it.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  And you're also an expert on the occult. You're a Christian. But explain, Trump no doubt did a huge Christian ritual yesterday.
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  Absolutely. I mean, it's an aggregate. Aggregor means a thought form. You put together many people thinking the same thing. You obtain a thought form.
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  And that is incredibly powerful. So yes, this was highest level magic. Absolutely. Not from an occult perspective. The devil tries to twist God's systems and put names on it.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  Listen, even churches are aggregate. I mean, when people get together in church, they form an aggregate and many churches together form then a belief system.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  The Bible says that two people together is done in heaven. Yeah. And if you have more than two people thinking of positive energy,
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  that's why they're trying to break us down because they know info wars is one of the main power drivers like a hydroelectric dam powering Trump.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  They can't stand it. And they've not blown this power structure out. They've only made it stronger. We're sending more power to Trump.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  Infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today. Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ. Full power. Damn the torpedoes. Go straight, Adam.
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory.

[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  Help with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  In October of 1775, the Continental Congress ordered the construction of two Swift sailing vessels, each carrying 10 cannons and 80 men to sail eastward.
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  Our young fleet tested their sea legs against the most powerful navy the world has ever seen.
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  John Paul Jones, America's first great naval hero, said,
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast, for I intend to go in harm's way.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  He got his wish many times when his ship was shot into pieces off the coast of England by a British vessel and her four dozen guns.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  When demanded to surrender, Jones very famously declared, I have not yet begun to fight.
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  And took the British ship an hour later. Three times in size.
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  When our navy begins fighting, they finish the job.
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  Absolutely. Robert Barnes, you were very prophetic what you just said earlier. Very powerful.
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:43.000]  And I want Leo Zagami here. Both of you guys are amazing speakers.
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  I don't hype things. Everybody knows that. I really tell you what I think is going on.
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  And we've had decades of evil and decades of globalism, and they're trying to demoralize us and run us down now.
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  But I see them jumping with shark. We talked about this last night and I showed you examples.
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  After we went to bed, Owen had been there earlier in the day. He came back in the town.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  We went out to the lake. All those articles, all those videos, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS taking down videos,
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  trashing it, saying it was horrible, saying it was all about Trump, saying Trump's horrible.
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  Everybody hated it. There were no crowds there. But suddenly they just backed off.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  First, they said there were no crowds there. DrudgeReport.com is linked to one of our reports,
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  one of Paul's reports, Summit.News, about how big the crowd was.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  To me, that's a bellwether, though, that now they're finally pulling propaganda in mass where they know we're not buying it.
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  No doubt about that. I mean, clearly they had a story scripted and the story was going to be Trump fails,
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  Trump has to back down, nobody shows up. Mother Nature doesn't lie.
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  The early viral tweets were that Mother Nature doesn't like Trump, doesn't like America.
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  They were trying to push Colin Kaepernick's tweet where he misquoted or quoted out of context,
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  Frederick Douglass' state of the great July 4th speech from back in 1845.
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  So there was all this effort to sort of demonize America. And you get a sense for how important American history,
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  American freedom, American liberty is all connected together.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  That's the reason why the president had that ritualistic celebration yesterday, did so celebrating our military prowess,
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  did so celebrating the spirit of our history, did so by celebrating all of the heroes and patriots over time
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:27.000]  who've done extraordinary things to keep the light of liberty alive.
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  And not only here in America, but around the world, because it's America that led the world.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  Every other democratic country post-dates the American Revolution in any meaningful manner.
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  It was the United States that kept freedom alive. It's the United States of America that created that freedom,
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  instigated that freedom and spread that freedom and protected that freedom.
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:48.000]  It's the United States who overcame communism and attempts and fascism.
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  It's the United States who is the back-to-back World War champs in World War I and World War II.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  It's the United States that has managed to keep us out of wars for the most part, like President Trump has done.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  So the people that are again, the deep state apparatus, the Democrats, people on the left, who want to demonize America,
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  demonize Christianity, demonize the American founders and freedom and liberty, demonize even the flag.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  They were burning the flag yesterday, wherever they could, whenever they could, however they could, even in the nation's capital.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  There were attacks on people for wearing Make America Great Again hats.
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  Those are people who basically need to demonize American history because that history tells the story of freedom and of liberty
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  and is very popular around the world.
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  That's why the President's speech yesterday was so critical, his celebration so important, his ritual invocation so essential
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  to protecting the American founding dream of freedom and liberty that ordinary everyday people keep alive,
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  but that the political elites, the cultural elites, the social elites and the economic elites want to oppress, suppress,
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  want to recreate and want to tell a false and fake narrative in order to be able to tell a story where Nike's scared
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  to even put out a shoe that celebrates the Betsy Ross flag.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  That's the kind of world they need to create in order to create their world.
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  That's why they want open borders.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  That's why they want trade without any protections.
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  That's why they want ceaseless and endless wars.
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  They want the American ideal to basically be defamed.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  The statue of liberty to be scarred in ways that will not be remembered amongst the ordinary everyday American public
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  so that kids don't know who our own country is.
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  Our country is in the country that started slavery.
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  It's the country that went to a civil war to end it.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  Our country is in the country that started racial oppression.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  It was the one that led the world to end it.
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  Our country wasn't the world that had royalty rule.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  Our country was the one that created democracy for the whole world to follow.
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  So that's who America isn't fascist.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  America isn't communist.
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  America is what put the input and end to fascism and communism and back-to-back world wars over a 50-year time frame.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  Beautifully said, and Trump said all that yesterday and they are just howling with hate.
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  And I'm not trying to be mean to CNN and New York Times writers and Vox writers.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  But when you go look them up, they all look like if I was a Hollywood producer
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  and I was casting a remake of One Who Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  they all look like deranged homicidal maniacs or schizophrenics or people with multiple personalities.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  I mean, what the hell is wrong with this freak show, Leo Zagami?
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  No, maybe they want the Queen to rule them again.
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  No, that's what the New York Times said.
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  But Vox says that they just are beside them.
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  What is it about America that makes them so mad?
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  It's crazy because if this Declaration of Independence didn't happen,
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  we will still be ruled here by the Queen of England.
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  Imagine that, guys, the Queen of England and that family of Hanoverians,
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  which actually is still ruling this country, England, but the same...
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  They're not even British. Explain that.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  Well, they're not even British, of course.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  Since the time of Queen Victoria, they married into German nobility.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  And it was actually a relative of mine, the Queen Mother, Elizabeth Bowes Lyon,
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  that brought back a bit of Britishness into the equation
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  because the Queen Mother was the cousin of my grandfather.
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  The fact that the British still follow and worship this royal family
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  gives you an idea of where America will be right now in 2019.
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  And that will be a nightmare.
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  I know that the Democrats are so obsessed that the whole of the Hollywood apparatus
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  still worships all this royal family.
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  And every time I go in any wall, I see all these newspapers
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  and they only talk about the British royal families.
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  How is this possible?
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  Why don't you talk about the beautiful family that Donald Trump has?
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  They had to give a Melania one major magazine cover, even though she's a dream.
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  And they prefer to talk about Prince William, Prince Harry, the American wife.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  You think we're a British Commonwealth.
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  And that'll happen with the Anglification with the CFR in 1922,
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  where they try to get us to merge the British Empire.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  These people are clearly anti-American.
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  Even my own mother is anti-American.
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  And I am sorry to say that on the air, but I mean, it's a shame for me,
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  but I had to declare independence from my mother because she is just like them.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  They're part of this mindset, you know, and it's like a nightmare.
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  Is it because the American system challenged the empires for so long,
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  they've been obsessed with taking it over?
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  Yeah, I mean, for people like my mother, I mean, from the English aristocracy, whatever,
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  America should still treat it like a colony that rebelled.
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  Oh, those evil doers, they should have stayed with us.
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  Oh, my God, they're just so, so far out.
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  I mean, and they still try to sabotage America
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  because America is being forwarded this dream of independence, of liberty.
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  Well, I tell you, we're going to get more from Robert Barnes and Leo Zagami
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  on where they think this fight goes, how the globalists try to take Trump out, and more.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  Tomorrow's news today, it's July 5th, 2019.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  Bill Hyde here, and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  Over $1,000 in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500, $300 or even $200.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:26.000]  In Europe and the U.S. to collapse the countries to kill capitalism
[2:30:26.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  and bring in socialism so we can go the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea and Venezuela.
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:32.000]  This is a plan.
[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  That's why we've got to stay on air.
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:36.000]  It's why you've got to keep fighting because we're going to win this in the end.
[2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:37.000]  Thanks to you and your support.
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  That's what makes it all possible.
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  So I salute you and I thank you, but I ask you again.
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:56.000]  Do your shopping with us and we will continue on in the face of this.
[2:30:56.000 --> 2:31:22.000]  The most banned network in the world.
[2:31:22.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  Thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support.
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:35.000]  Because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:39.000]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun.
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:40.000]  But that's not what's important.
[2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  The enemy could win.
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:43.000]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:44.000]  We're being used by God.
[2:31:44.000 --> 2:31:45.000]  You're being used by God.
[2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:46.000]  This is Providence.
[2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:51.000]  So I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[2:31:51.000 --> 2:31:57.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  The time has come.
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:31:59.000]  The time is here.
[2:31:59.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders,
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:09.000]  and that the whole world could come here and get everything free,
[2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  but that we, the citizens, have to pay for it.
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:16.000]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms,
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  we will collapse into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and the US
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  to collapse the countries, to kill capitalism and bring in socialism
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  so we can go the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea and Venezuela.
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:32.000]  This is a plan.
[2:32:32.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  That's why we've got to stay on air.
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  It's why you've got to keep fighting because we're going to win this in the end.
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  Thanks to you and your support, that's what makes it all possible.
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:43.000]  So I salute you and I thank you, but I ask you again, do your shopping with us
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  and we will continue on in the face of this.
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:49.000]  InfowarsStore.com, 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points,
[2:32:49.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  whatever you do, commit now to history and know that buying products from us
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:33:22.000]  is one of the most important things you can do in the fight against the globalist.
[2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  Now take you live for the heart of the resistance.
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  No one can deny we're living in incredibly epic times.
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  Leo Zagami, I want to get your take and then Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  and the other studio on Trump's Achilles' heel, our Achilles' heel,
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  what the system's going to do, who the different power structures are,
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  and like a game of risk, how they're going to try to stop the American recovery
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  and what's unfolding in Leo during the break, you were telling me,
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  Putin just flew in to meet the Pope yesterday on July 4th,
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  who the different factions are, and what's really happening.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  Well, he was actually sending a message to Trump by flying into Rome and visiting the Pope,
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  because you see the Pope is this very powerful figure at the moment that is more of a political figure
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  than a religious one and is supporting all the way whatever the Democrats are doing,
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  whatever the left wing is doing.
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  So Putin himself has a dark agenda which people tend to forget.
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  The fact that the KGB infiltrated back in the days so many seminaries
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  and had approximately 7,000 agents that infiltrated the Catholic Church
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  and they didn't stop their operation, which is to destroy the Catholic faith
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  and reduce it to what we see nowadays, which is basically a liberal theology nightmare
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  full of communists, perverts, pedophiles running around
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  and wanting illegal immigrants so they can take their children and bring them in their pedophilia rings.
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  It's a complete nightmare.
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  And so the fact that they met on the 4th of July was to send a message to America.
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  Well, we receive your message, their elite, their Jesuits, and we are not scared.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  That's what would be our answer, because after what we saw yesterday in Washington DC,
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  we are definitely not scared.
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  But let's be clear, a lot of great Catholics, a lot of great people,
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  a lot of great Republicans are great Protestants.
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  Catholics have nothing to do with the Pope.
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  Let's say it's different factions, so explain.
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  Yeah, I mean, there is factions in the Catholic Church and Raymond Burke, for example,
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  Heads One, a more conservative faction, traditionalist.
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  Do all these American cardinals come out and say,
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  you can't let Islam take over you?
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  But the moment in which you even mentioned that, for example,
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  I just cited the words of Raymond Burke against Muslim immigration.
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  I got blocked for 30 days on Facebook, so just for citing the words of a cardinal.
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  I mean, it's quite incredible.
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  But that demonstrates what they're doing.
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  They have taken over the Catholic Church and it's not the Church of Jesus anymore.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  Exactly, and it's just like universities are anti-free speech now and are hell holes.
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  I mean, that's what the left takes everything over.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  And everything they take over, they use sex cult operations.
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  Explain that, because it's how they compromise people.
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  Well, we saw the Bishop of Santa Fe bringing these illegal immigrants.
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  Yeah, let's roll some of that video while he talks.
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  This happened last week.
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  Bishop of Santa Fe illegally bringing people across.
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  The defiant of U.S. laws.
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  I mean, why nobody's doing anything?
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  I mean, if you're a bishop here in America in 1776,
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  there was the separation of church and state also.
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  So we should do something about it.
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  Don't you think, Alex?
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:36:59.000]  I mean, absolutely.
[2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  Well, I mean, I saw that video last week.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  We played here.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  He is bringing thousands of people across.
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  Boom, breaking the border to tell the whole world rush us.
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  And of course, the victims are always the same, the children, the children that are exploited.
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  And nowadays we find more and more children at the border who are not really with their real parents,
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  but with people who take them along so they can pass through more easily.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:28.000]  They get immediately inserted in pedophile rings.
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  The exploitation of children today also by the LGBT community that just received a few days ago, Alex,
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  the LGBT community received one organization, a very powerful organization,
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  received $700,000 by the U.S. Bishop Conference.
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  How is that possible?
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  Why is the U.S. and they have this Jesuit called James Martin,
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  who is like a pro-LGBT all the way and he is involved in it?
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  So why is this U.S. Bishop Conference giving money to the LGBT community?
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  LGBTQ or whatever you want to call it.
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  I mean, without their respect, the Catholic Church should be helping the poor,
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  should be helping all those homeless people that we see flooding the cities.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  I mean, does the LGBTQ community need the money of the county?
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  Absolutely.
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  No.
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  And again, here it is.
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  Texas Bishop escorts Central American migrants across Border Bridge to protest U.S. policy
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  and they just let him do it.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  I mean, this is the incredible area.
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  So let's go back to constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes.
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  You can see it.
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  World government, the U.N., the Vatican.
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  A lawyer maybe can explain us how.
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  Organizing the collapse of the borders.
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  Telling us we've got to pay for everybody once they get here.
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  Beto O'Rourke campaigning in Mexico for president with illegals.
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:48.000]  You can see the plan to break the U.S. up,
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  just like the U.N. said they would do, Barnes.
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  No doubt.
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  I mean, for example, to show sort of how things are aligned or what allegiance is there,
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  the Southern Poverty Law Center is involved in legal action against people who exposed
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  the various church activities that were engaged in illicit criminal activities
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  and helping illegal immigrants access the country and avoid detection.
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  And even though, so here someone is doing their lawful duty, reporting criminal behavior,
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  criminal behavior that happens to involve members of a local, of the church.
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  And they are the ones targeted for legal action.
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  And they, I mean, to date, they haven't been able to find counsel to defend them
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  because of the problems they face and they don't have lots of money or means.
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  So that's just one example.
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  If we look at another example of this sort of effort to be anti-patriotic
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  and the threats that Trump faces, you look at Google yesterday just couldn't put up
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  Betsy Ross's flag all day.
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  They couldn't even put up any American flag all day
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  when they usually always celebrate whatever holiday it is.
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  They showed baseball.
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  Exactly.
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  They showed baseball instead.
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  Which is also a great America tradition.
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  But there's no reason not to include the American flag that where from which baseball comes from.
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  But they couldn't do it.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  And you have people like Congresswoman Omar who celebrated Somalian Independence Day
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  but wouldn't celebrate American Independence Day.
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  So that's the sort of mindset mentality.
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  And as we were talking about with the European Union yesterday,
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  what you're seeing in the United States is going to the question that Leo asked,
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  why isn't there more effort by Democratic cities, by the Catholic Church,
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  by the political left to do something for the people that are homeless in the United States
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  instead of doing what Austin is doing which is encouraging and incentivizing homelessness
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  by legalizing it in a wide range of locations all across the city.
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  The reason is very simple and they want disruption.
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  They want chaos.
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  They want to justify denationalizing police forces and creating sort of a globalized structure
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  in EU police and army structure in the European Union.
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  Something equivalent here in the United States.
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  That's right. Overrun the borders, break them and then demand a continental security perimeter
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  for the North American Union which is in their own documents.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  They said we'll use migrant waves, disease, and economic collapse to force it on the US and Europe.
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  And now I'm glad you brought that up because you're in another studio.
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  Coming back, I'm going to show the local newscast saying Austin is adopting something stronger
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  than Portland or stronger than Seattle or San Francisco or LA saying they can sleep in your front yard
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  that homeless from the world come here. Everything's free.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  The Democrats own the places that get the federal and state money only get part of the homeless.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  They make money off each homeless person.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  This is insane until you realize a larger game plan, Robert.
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  Oh, exactly. And it all relates to things like the citizenship question.
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  So I think the president actually does have a solution to that of a variety of legal scholars
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  including a Texas law professor, Josh Blackman, who is friends with mine.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  We've recommended a proposal to the president that I think the president can take
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  that actually will make sure the citizenship question is included
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  because constitutionally under the 14th Amendment, it has to be included
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  in order to enforce the 14th Amendment rights of states all across the country.
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  So hopefully that will actually happen and occur, but it's all part of the same species.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  Trying to destroy America is part of trying to destroy nationalism,
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  trying to destroy borders so that powers no longer localize.
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  I said it's simple multinational corporations that think they're too big for their britches
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  coming in and taking over your country and buying up your politicians is real simple.
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  And these idiots are like, yay, free stuff.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  This multinational secret CHICOM funded consortium tells me they're going to give me free stuff
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  and the Democrats are all one-upping each other.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  Everything's free, homes, tuition, money, education.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  It's all free. Who pays for it?
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  And by pushing inside America more and more South Americans who are Catholics,
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  that means that they are incentivating their own electorate, their own show.
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  Let's be clear, leftist Catholics.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  Yeah, but they're all nowadays the Catholic Church is in the hands of a Pope-based communist.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  That's it.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  There is no real opposition because even Raymond Burke was punished by the Pope
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  and sent to a remote island when he was...
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  No, it's true. The anti-crisis captured the Catholic Church
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  and every Catholic I know understands that.
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  Well, they're right back, stay with us.
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  There is no longer any doubt multinational companies and governments
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  are funding an attempted violent, malice-style overthrow of the U.S.
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:04.000]  Our borders are being totally collapsed.
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  Already-born babies are being killed.
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:07.000]  World government is here.
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  Now is the time for decision.
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  Now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're on.
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:15.000]  And if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are banning the American flag
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:18.000]  and attacking the family and that are attacking our borders and our country
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  and our military and our heritage,
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  if you want to defend that, then now is the time to take action.
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:24.000]  And that means word of mouth about this broadcast.
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  And that means buying products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  And that means praying for InfoWars.
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  And praying for President Trump.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  And praying for yourself.
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  And praying for peace.
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  Praying for justice.

[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:05.000]  with the Save InfoWars 50% off,
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked-up stuff.
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price.
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:13.000]  And we're moving a ton of it, okay?
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:15.000]  But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:17.000]  or something and you get $20,000.
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure,
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:22.000]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  of dollars a product.
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  I want to expand, not contract.
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  And for six months, we've not just made a standstill.
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:28.000]  The enemy's been winning.
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  And I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  I like to be expanding.
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  I like to be winning.
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  I like to be fighting.
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  And we are winning the InfoWars while we're so hated.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  But we need to be retreaded.
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  We need to be tuned up.
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  We need to be fixed up.
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:41.000]  We never have time to get into dry-up.
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  And the enemy wants to silence us.
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  funded by foreign banks in the CHICOM.
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  So go to infowarsstore.com.
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:59.000]  I want to be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:01.000]  We're going into the season of war.
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  And they have been inches from shutting down
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  the final mega-counts we have through their criminal activity
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  and their digital fraud.
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  We need to end here.
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:13.000]  We need to be provisioned.
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:17.000]  against the enemy fearlessly.
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  I'm bloody, and then I'm up politically.
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  I'm banging heads with them, and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  That just brings more people here.
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  So I'm in one hell of a fight, and so are you.
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:31.000]  And I need war bonds.
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  I need gas.
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  I need ammo politically now.
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  But literally, if you flood us with money,
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  and if you flood us with product purchases,
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  We're unstoppable together.
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:43.000]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  You have my commitment.
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:47:21.000]  of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:28.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  Look, I meant to go to calls.
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  I did.
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  But I am going to suit up whoever wants to volunteer out there with our crew.
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  And I'm going to come here to this studio tomorrow from...
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  But let's get it out of the way.
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  I'll come in here at about 11 a.m.
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  I think we should go live at noon tomorrow.
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  And air all of Trump's speech.
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  And then if we can't, open the phones up and take people's calls about it
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  because it really needs to be done.
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  So 11 a.m. Central tomorrow, a special Saturday edition.
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  You know, Trump's going to be working tomorrow.
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  Too much history is happening.
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  I'll be here.
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  And please, listeners, we were in the red for most of this year
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  until the huge attacks, the Facebook ban,
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  the attempt to plant child porn on us and all of it.
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  And listeners really saw how serious it was when they said
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  that you can't even say my name on Facebook.
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  Let's show that Caitlyn Bennett article from this weekend if we can.
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  They banned a photo.
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  She posted it with the Info War shirt with an American flag seven months ago.
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  So now they have like a pre-crime machine that goes back in time.
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  And they said, you post any more Info Wars stuff,
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  any more photos with it will ban you.
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  Think about the intimidation.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  Think about the threats.
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  Well, they can't stop you from getting a classic.
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  This is our best selling shirt.
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  Info Wars in your face.
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  It's navy blue.
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  It's got a big red info wars.com on the front info wars.com on the back.
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  And again, everybody can get that shirt and check it out here.
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  I'll pull it up for you right now.
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  Again, you go to infowarstore.com and you can find that article.
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  You can also go to the store infowarstore.com and you can find it.
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  But the article from yesterday written by Paul Joseph Watson is Instagram.
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  That's who owns Facebook removes American flag photo because of info wars.com in the image.
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  And it's Caitlyn Bennett.
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  So again, think about that folks.
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  Think about the level of control that these people think that they have.
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  Think about the level of arrogance and what they're going to ban next.
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  The Betsy Ross flag of the abolitionist lady saying it's racist effect.
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  I have a news clip.
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  I want to plan and get both our guests take on that.
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  Here is a clip from the news with one of the usual suspect Democrats saying that this is a horrible person.
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  Betsy Ross is a slave master, but she was actually an abolitionist.
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  This is just incredible.
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  Here it is.
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  Sometimes these computers have a little bit of a hiccup.
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  That's all right.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  That's what happens.
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  That's what happens with what you want to get your take on that because we're living in a time where there's a different type of sensitivity and sensibility about race.
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  Yeah, well, you know, and I was glad to see that.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  And my hope is that they didn't just do it to do it, that they understand the significance there.
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  And look, there are a lot of things in our history that are still very painful.
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  The Confederate flag that still flies in some places and is used as a symbol.
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  And I believe that we need to move toward an inclusive America that understands that pain that doesn't wipe it away from history in the sense that it still belongs in a museum.
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  Or we need to read about it and understand the significance because that's how you learn and make sure that we don't make the same mistakes in the future, but does not glorify it, does not celebrate it.
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:19.000]  Well, I mean, that is the most amazing statement from Julian Castro.
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  This is the same guy that just said a week ago in the debates that we need tranny men, trans men to be able to have abortions.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  They don't have uteruses.
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  And now he goes, oh, you can have this flag in a museum, the original American flag, made by an abolitionist.
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:34.000]  You can't glorify it.
[2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  I mean, it's insane.
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  Think about what this guy is saying.
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:40.000]  I mean, well, we have to exercise these symbols or we'll lose it.
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  And again, I'm going to do a special broadcast today just on the Caitlyn Bennett article.
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  I'm staying here till six now.
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  We're going live till seven.
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  I'm doing one hour on the Caitlyn Bennett article news wars.com info wars.com whole hour on it because we're going to talk about it.
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  We're going to show it to you.
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  It's summit dot news.
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:04.000]  It's just it's just next level.
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:06.000]  Robert Barnes.
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  Well, I mean, the reason why info wars is targeted is for the same reason that all these sort of anti-American activities are taking place by people like Congressman Castro, by people like Congressman Omar, by people like AOC.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  It's people who really don't love and believe in America because it's the greatest resistance to the efforts that they're trying to do.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:24.000]  So info wars is America.
[2:52:24.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  Info wars is Americana.
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:28.000]  Info wars is Independence Day.
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  Info wars is July 4th because it reflects and represents Americana at its core, not just protects it, defends it as it does on a day to day basis.
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  That's why they obsessively hate over info wars.
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  That's why it's not a surprise they're trying to ban Caitlyn Bennett from even showing a shirt.
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:57.000]  That's a pro-American shirt that just because it has a correlation with info wars because in the minds of the cultural, social, political, big tech oligarchic elite left, they believe America is the idea of America.
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  The spirit of America is the great threat to their ideas of globalism and global ideals and ideals that remove local, little D, democratic power, which they have been trying to take away really for centuries.
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:12.000]  I mean, the American experiment was radical and was revolutionary.
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  We had been used to being dominated by elites for thousands of years, elites that had corrupted aspects of the Catholic Church that led to the Inquisition and other atrocities that also had led to royalty being ruled.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  Being ruled by someone that's five years old simply because they're the product of some ancestral relationship between some royal families.
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  That was how the world was ruled for almost 2,000 years until America came along.
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:38.000]  And it's the idea of America, the spirit of America.
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  President Trump talked about America forever, no matter what, and I believe what he meant was the spirit of America will be here forever.
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  They can't crush it, they can't kill it, they can't destroy it, they can't wipe it out.
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  Just as the idea of infowars will be here forever, they can't crush it, they can't destroy it, because the audience continues to support it.
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  Because the audience continues to believe in it, because the audience keeps it alive by doing things like going to InfowarsStore.com and supporting it in any and every possible way they can.
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  They cannot crush the American dream and they cannot crush American liberty because it lives in the hearts and souls and minds of everyday Americans.
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:24.000]  And that's the great resistance against this elite effort to co-opt and coerce a different sort of behavior, an anti-Christian behavior, an anti-American behavior, an ideal system that is anti-little D Democratic at its heart and its soul.
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  And that's why it's so critical that Infowars does what it does and the audience does what it does because it is the tip of the spear for keeping America and Americana alive today.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  Well, you know, Castro and all these other Democrats, they work for foreign powers, they work for multinational corporations that set up the Euro, that set up the North American Union, they want to conquer countries.
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  And they learn we can't do it with tanks, we do it politically, we undermine the nation, we teach a large group of people to hate the country they live in and to identify with the communist Chinese.
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  They identify with the communist Chinese, but they also identify with the communists in South America.
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  For example, some of them have even glorified Maduro, who is still in charge of Venezuela, by the way, and who hasn't been put aside because he's protected by Pope Francis and by Russia.
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  So this gives you an idea of who is behind the scenes defending these globally stuges of the left.
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  So I think that a guy like Castro should be ashamed for what he said, ashamed, but he doesn't have any sense of shame.
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  That's the problem with left-wingers. They are just adamant in going and pursuing this anti-American ideology.
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  And of course, you've got this Castro guy who served the Obama administration running for president. There's this bio right there on screen.
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  Now, let's play that clip I mentioned earlier, or I'll give you a time. Just give me a thumbs up when you got it.
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  He came out, because I don't want to just mention this. I want to play it. We're going to talk about it.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  He said that, oh, we always want women to have the right to abortion. We want trans men to have the right to have abortions.
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  So a man doesn't have a uterus, but he wants to make you accept this. And the crowd goes, whoa!
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  I mean, this is exciting. Here it is.
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:20.000]  To universal health care.
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  Secretary Castro, this one does for you. All of you on stage support a woman's right to an abortion.
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  You all support some version of a government health care option. Would your plan cover abortion, Mr. Secretary?
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  Yes, it would. I don't believe only in reproductive freedom. I believe in reproductive justice.
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  Justice. Kill that baby.
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  What that means is that just because a woman, or let's also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female,
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  is poor doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to exercise that right to choose.
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  And so I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion. More than that, everybody in this crowd and watching at home
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  knows that in our country today, a person's right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri and Alabama.
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  Oh, stop right there. By the way, we didn't edit that. That's a computer glitch. We're going to re-download that clip.
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  We're going to re-download it because everybody knows we didn't edit that. He actually said a trans man has a right to abortion.
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  Well, I'm still recovering from that. That evening when I saw this scene, and I wrote it the day after on my social media,
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  I mean, it's unheard of. I mean, you must be into some twilight zone where men are capable of giving birth,
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  but actually they are pushing that agenda, you know.
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:43.000]  So it's an overthrow reality. Let's come back and finish with both you guys and Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of people here in New York City,
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:57.000]  and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[2:57:57.000 --> 2:58:04.000]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him
[2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:06.000]  in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:12.000]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:14.000]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:18.000]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[2:58:18.000 --> 2:58:23.000]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man. I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:30.000]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles,
[2:58:30.000 --> 2:58:34.000]  and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[2:58:34.000 --> 2:58:36.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for Liberty.
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:45.000]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:19.000]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[2:59:19.000 --> 2:59:23.000]  There has never been a more important time to support info wars.
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:30.000]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:33.000]  Order now at the info war store.

[2:59:41.000 --> 2:59:44.000]  At infowarstore.com
[2:59:48.000 --> 2:59:52.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:52.000 --> 3:00:06.000]  Robert Barnes earlier brought this up.
[3:00:06.000 --> 3:00:07.000]  We see the same thing with Europe.
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:13.000]  Giant migrant camps everywhere up to 90% of people five years later don't have jobs or homeless rioting stabbing people.
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:15.000]  My own son Rex Jones,
[3:00:15.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  this is Spanish kids three years ago that stayed at his mother's house when he was there part time from Spain who were exchange students.
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  And his friend that he still talks to on the Internet every week to the hospital fighting for his life in Madrid stabbed by a North African migrant for no reason.
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  Stabbed a few of his other friends just walked up to him in a bus stop started stabbing.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  Of course the police aren't even going to charge them.
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  They just they said there's so many we can't stop it.
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:43.000]  They block roads.
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  They rape.
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  They kill.
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:46.000]  What's the larger plan?
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  Here's an Austin newscast where they say they can sleep basically in your front yard or anywhere else except the city council building.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  Here it is.
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  Several other major cities that allow camping within city limits in Seattle.
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  Camping is also legal except in parks and San Francisco and appeals court ruled last year that cities could not criminalize people for sleeping or camping in public areas if shelter isn't available.
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  And in Portland camping is only banned on public property and public rights away.
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  Now we'll have to establish that the underlying conduct posed a hazard or danger to someone before we can take any action.
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  As KXA and Eugene chill found out that last part about camping still has many people worried.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  Police chief Ryan Manley told the city council under these new changes if you set up a tent say here on Congress Avenue police cannot make you move.
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  As long as you're not blocking the public right of way on entrance to a business or as long as you're not posing safety risks to yourself or others.
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:56.000]  This is about the next student who would be groped, followed, assaulted or possibly murdered in the West Campus area.
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  We were chased.
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:02:00.000]  It's not pleasant to be so frightened.
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:06.000]  Some people worry about safety and what will happen to downtown streets since people can now set up tents without getting cited.
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:14.000]  But the mayor says the city manager has been directed to come up with guidelines later this summer for safe places to camp and other solutions for homelessness.
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:18.000]  He doesn't think a tent city will be an issue in the meantime.
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  I just don't think we're going to see that kind of thing happen over a week period of time if it does.
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  Let's stop him.
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  I want to get Zagami's quick take on this.
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  She's going to be back on with the war room and on Shroyer today.
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:38.000]  Well, in Europe, we have this happening for years. My wife, who is here in the studio, she's been harassed by North Africans for the last 10 years, living in Italy all the time.
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  I mean, I live in the car alone and I go to a shop and they will start knocking on the car.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:48.000]  She will go on her own and at one point they will stop her in the middle of the street.
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:50.000]  It was just, I mean, it was insane.
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:52.000]  But they're third world, they're virtuous.
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  I don't care.
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  I'm joking.
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:56.000]  They're not.
[3:02:56.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  No, I know, I know.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  And they'll just let them do whatever they want. It's just like insane.
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:04.000]  So why is the left doing it?
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  To destroy the very fabric of the West.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  To destroy our families.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:16.000]  To incentivize the sense of isolation that brings also these people to become homeless.
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:19.000]  A lot of them are from the US. They're all on drugs.
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  It's a whole culture.
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  Now Barnes, where does this go?
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  Well, no place good unless the president is successful.
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  And that's why what Leo said earlier about them, that President Trump is the main area of resistance to this sort of globalist agenda.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:38.000]  Now, there's been other successes politically in Italy as he's talked about.
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  There's been successes in the EU elections for the Brexit Party.
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  There's been successes in Brexit itself.
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  But you see all the resistance that's been done.
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:54.000]  I mean, the UK cannot put into place the Brexit referendum that the population and the biggest referendum turnout in UK history said to do.
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  And the president himself is having to fight his own internal people in the deep state apparatus that continues to try to throw up obstacles.
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  So that's why it's critical that people stay active, people stay involved, people support independent free press like this network, support the president's efforts.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  Because that is the bulwark against these assaults and attacks from the global elites and the political establishment that wants to end the mere idea of nationhood
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  and undermine the mere ideal of Christianity by attacking our very history that the president so successfully celebrated yesterday.
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:28.000]  Well said, Barnes. Well said, Leo Zagami at leozagami.com.
[3:04:28.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  You're going to be on the war room coming up.
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:32.000]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:36.000]  I'll be back tomorrow noon for at least a two hour special broadcast.
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:40.000]  I think I'm doing more tonight. In fact, I'm just doing 20 hours this weekend.
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  We're not giving up.
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:42.000]  We're dug in and we're winning.
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  But we're going to fight even harder now to ensure that victory.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:53.000]  Paul Joseph Watson from England absolutely ready to launch is live in 60 seconds.
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:04:54.000]  All right, great.
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:04:57.000]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget this is the maximum alert.
[3:04:57.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:05:00.000]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[3:05:00.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight.
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:06.000]  We need financial support and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:08.000]  We want to just give us straight donations.
[3:05:08.000 --> 3:05:09.000]  There's a P.O. box.
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:10.000]  We want to mail us a check.
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:12.000]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:16.000]  We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.
[3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:19.000]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main page.

[3:05:52.000 --> 3:05:59.000]  We're not going to back down.
[3:06:22.000 --> 3:06:33.000]  But I got to tell you, we don't strip what we talk about here.
[3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:35.000]  My host, my guest host, my crew.
[3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:38.000]  We all have different views, but in general, we love freedom.
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:39.000]  We love justice.
[3:06:39.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  And we love the Renaissance.
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  And we love humanity.
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:44.000]  We believe in a pro-human future.
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:47.000]  Paul Watts is taking over here in just a minute or two.
[3:06:47.000 --> 3:06:51.000]  But I got to tell you right now, we're going to be playing a lot of excerpts from the War
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  Room of Trump's amazing historic speech.
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  I'm coming in here tomorrow at noon central.
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:07:03.000]  So it'll just be a live feed, internet only, infowars.com, forward slash show, front page,
[3:07:03.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  rearing of Trump's speech with analysis and history.
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:14.000]  So be sure and join us at 12 noon tomorrow, central standard time for a live retransmission
[3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:19.000]  of the speech, because it was a new Declaration of Independence.
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:23.000]  It was a exorcism of the left and their hatred of America.
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:27.000]  Their attack on it was unprecedented and insane.
[3:07:27.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  We have got to make a big deal out of this because it is.
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:32.000]  And listen, the listeners get it.
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:33.000]  I'm seeing the comments.
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:36.000]  We're getting the calls and emails coming in.
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:39.000]  People are excited.
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:43.000]  And I didn't get into all the other articles that Paul's written today.
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:50.000]  New trend of tampering with food products by putting them back is going viral by leftist
[3:07:50.000 --> 3:07:52.000]  men dressed as women.
[3:07:52.000 --> 3:07:57.000]  They come in, they spit in your mouth, watch the lick and spit in your ice cream.
[3:07:57.000 --> 3:07:59.000]  It's just total degradation.
[3:07:59.000 --> 3:08:06.000]  Also, new leftist trends of women on YouTube bathing in water and then buying pints of it.
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:09.000]  People say, oh, you're just click baiting, focusing on the degenerate.
[3:08:09.000 --> 3:08:12.000]  No, this is the main operating system of the left.
[3:08:12.000 --> 3:08:17.000]  The average leftist says it's fun to kill babies, kill those little pieces of crap, beat them
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:18.000]  up, assault them, get them.
[3:08:18.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  We've played the clips.
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:22.000]  They have converted to pure evil.
[3:08:22.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  But beyond that, if they were just going to stop with banning info wars dot com or Alex
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  Jones on Facebook, Twitter, Google, it wouldn't be that big a deal.
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:37.000]  But obviously, China's already banned Winnie the Pooh, making fun of their dictator, or
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:40.000]  the Taiwanese flag and big techs worked with them.
[3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:46.000]  Well, this article up on summit.news, Paul Sight and infowars.com, and newswars.com is
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:47.000]  so critical.
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:54.000]  We can put it on screen and show you all the screenshots in there where it has the information
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  and it has the posting from Instagram owned by Facebook.
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  And they say community guidelines, we want to keep Instagram a safe place for everyone.
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:16.000]  And we created these guidelines to support and protect our community on Instagram.
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:21.000]  And it's a blurred out picture of Caitlyn Bennett and the American flag and info or shirt from
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  seven months ago.
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  And now they want to ban the Betsy Ross flag when she was an abolitionist.
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  That means free the slaves.
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:35.000]  But does it matter to Mr Castro?
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:38.000]  He says that men deserve to have abortions too.
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:39.000]  He actually said that.
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  And he said that the flag should be in a museum, not publicly on Nike tennis shoes.
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:47.000]  These people want the power to control what symbols you can have.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:55.000]  That's why we're selling a new special edition shirt in navy blue and in white that is the
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:09:58.000]  Betsy Ross original continental flag.
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:01.000]  And under it, these colors don't run.
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  And on the back, on the back, it says America's back.
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  There's another version that says the spirit of 1776 established in 1776 under the flag.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  And on the back, it has the same message of America's back info wars.com.
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  This is an awesome shirt.
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:26.000]  You need to wear this proud and it funds our operation.
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  They're being printed right now, they'll ship out in a week, two weeks for delivery, get
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:34.000]  your special edition shirt and trigger these leftist everywhere.
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  And we have to end the specials this weekend, store wide free shipping, 3% off all the
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:41.000]  supplements and double patriot points.
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:45.000]  And either Wednesday or Thursday, I'll be announcing it later this afternoon, we're
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  going to a 36 hour broadcast 1776 worldwide to coincide with Trump's summit.
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  Trump's summit coming up on the 11th, where he's going to go after the sensors.
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:01.000]  So that's all coming up.
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  All right, thank you all for your support.
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  You're amazing.
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  Great things are happening.
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:07.000]  The battle is joined.
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  Now Paul Joseph Watson with so much news to cover makes my head spin.
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  And then in about 50 minutes, Owen Troyer and the war room with Leo Zagami in studio.
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  Paul Watson.
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:19.000]  Thanks Alex.
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  Yeah, we're still looking at this big story that's linked up on judge report.com about
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  the attendance and the lies that the media told about the quote poorly attended fourth
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:33.000]  of July parade in DC yesterday.
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  AOC has put out a tweet in the last few hours that says Trump spent millions on a poorly
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:44.000]  attended one day parade.
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  They are still claiming that this was poorly attended.
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  Okay, I saw on Twitter earlier under the trending hashtag Trump parade fail or whatever it was
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  earlier on.
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  Dozens of people, dozens of leftists claiming, first of all, that it was poorly attended
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:09.000]  when people posted screenshots of the thousands and thousands of people lined up all the way
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:11.000]  down the National Mall.
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  They claimed those photos were photoshopped were faked.
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  I literally linked one direct from CNN with a link to the CNN article.
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:22.000]  It was a CNN photo.
[3:12:22.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  I think it was that one right there.
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:30.000]  Oh, so CNN's photo shopping this, she's literally out claiming after claiming that, you know,
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:34.000]  there were concentration camps that migrants were drinking toilet water, complete absolute
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  hysterical nonsense.
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  Now that this was a poorly attended parade, you have ABC.
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  ABC News put out a tweet.
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:51.000]  After this event, wild weather, small crowds and protesters rain on Trump's parade.
[3:12:51.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  Did you see the comparison between the Trump baby balloon protesters and the actual attendees
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:12:59.000]  for the rally?
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:04.000]  Oh, it's literally like six or seven protesters with this Trump baby balloon.
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:08.000]  You saw the Antifa protesters burning the flag.
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  Again, it was a gaggle.
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  It was no more than 12.
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  They're literally saying that the protests were comparable to the actual people who attended
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:17.000]  the event.
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  Again, ABC News, wild weather, small crowds and protesters rain on Trump's parade.
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:26.000]  Small crowds.
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  If that's a small crowd, I mean, what do they expect?
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:38.000]  John Cooper, former Barack Obama campaign chair, put out a tweet.
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  Trump's event in DC today has drawn an embarrassingly small crowd.
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  This was after the event, after all these photos came out.
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  This individual who put out this tweet said that they turned off the webcam on the National Mall
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:56.000]  because no one was there.
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:14:01.000]  That was before the event started at a distance well away from it.
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  In fact, I posted the picture directly under this tweet.
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  Again, you had the Guardian.
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  There you go.
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  There's the actual attendance.
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:09.000]  You had the Guardian.
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  Why have struggles to draw crowds to Trump's Fourth of July show?
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:20.000]  If that's struggling, then, you know, absolutely incredible.
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:21.760]  What else do we have here?
[3:14:21.760 --> 3:14:24.000]  We had the media beforehand.
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:29.200]  As we've gotten the article up on Summit News, the Independent reporting Trump officials
[3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:33.000]  fear embarrassingly tiny crowd for his Fourth of July speech.
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  Again, you read into that article.
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:39.000]  Okay, so what officials fear embarrassingly tiny crowds?
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  Do you have a quote?
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:41.000]  No, there was literally nothing.
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:44.000]  There were no officials who feared anything.
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:49.000]  And as you can see from the photos, it was not a tiny crowd.
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  Absolutely incredible level of deception that they'll literally go on there and claim that it was poorly attended.
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  And Paul, let me just interrupt briefly.
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  Let me just throw this in briefly.
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:01.000]  Remember the inauguration almost three years ago?
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:05.000]  They showed the gates when they first opened and said no one was there and then said Trump was crazy.
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  No one was there.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  Remember those photos from the Washington Monument where they showed it when it only first opened on CNN?
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  PBS, they all did it.
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  They all said, oh, look, hardly any crowd, even though the gates had just opened and Antifa was trying to keep people from going in.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  There's no end to this.
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  Oh, they literally had webcam set up hours before and then these leftists on Twitter took screenshots and said, oh, look, nobody's turned up.
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  They're literally claiming that CNN is now faking photos of this.
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:38.000]  This is the level of hysteria.
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  They just need to admit to take the L to admit that this was a very well attended event.
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  It was a great success.
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  The speech was great.
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  Give Trump the win.
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:47.000]  Just accept it.
[3:15:47.000 --> 3:15:49.000]  Stop being hysterical morons.
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  We'll be back.
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:51.000]  Summit.news.
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:53.000]  Don't go away.
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:04.000]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart and body extract?
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:55.000]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[3:17:55.000 --> 3:17:56.000]  Marcus here on the air.
[3:17:56.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  Thanks for holding.
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:17:58.000]  Hey, Alex.
[3:17:58.000 --> 3:18:00.000]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[3:18:00.000 --> 3:18:02.000]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City.
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:06.000]  And one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:14.000]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public.
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:15.000]  The approaching 2020.
[3:18:15.000 --> 3:18:16.000]  That's it.
[3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:21.000]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him.
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:23.000]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[3:18:23.000 --> 3:18:24.000]  I agree entirely.
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:29.000]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:32.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:34.000]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[3:18:34.000 --> 3:18:37.000]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:39.000]  You've won a lot of battles.
[3:18:39.000 --> 3:18:43.000]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[3:18:43.000 --> 3:18:45.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[3:18:45.000 --> 3:18:51.000]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:53.000]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[3:18:55.000 --> 3:19:00.000]  I want to encourage everyone to take advantage of the huge July 4th specials we're running right through in the next weekend.
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:06.000]  But then they've got to stop store-wide free shipping, 50% off all the award-winning supplements, and double-patriot points.
[3:19:06.000 --> 3:19:10.000]  That means on your next order, 10% off, not 5% off on the dollar.
[3:19:10.000 --> 3:19:15.000]  Designed for auto-shipping and additional 10% off, some of these products are lost leaders at those prices.
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:17.000]  X2, learn about why it's so special.
[3:19:17.000 --> 3:19:20.000]  How is the good at halogen? How is the missing link in the body?

[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  Brain Force Plus, super blue fluoride-free toothpaste, 4 to 5-of-the-cold silver and iodine.

[3:19:35.000 --> 3:19:40.000]  Most of those are close to selling out, some won't be back in for months, many won't be back in for weeks.
[3:19:40.000 --> 3:19:44.000]  But regardless, fish oil for adults, for children, the very best out there.
[3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:48.000]  All of these are great products, books, films, t-shirts, water filtration, air filtration.
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:20:06.000]  That's what funds the M4 and the big sales running right now at m4store.com.
[3:20:18.000 --> 3:20:41.000]  Your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:49.000]  Yep, we're talking about the crowd size at the July 4th event yesterday. AOC is outlying about it. ABC News is outlying about it.
[3:20:49.000 --> 3:20:53.000]  The former campaign chef of Barack Obama is lying about it.
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:21:00.000]  Either they're saying that the photographs were photoshopped even when they're literally on CNN.com.
[3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:02.000]  Now AOC has come out with a new tweet.
[3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:07.000]  And they did a similar thing back for the inauguration back in 2017,
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:14.000]  where actually CNN itself initially put out these photos from the inauguration of Trump,
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:20.000]  comparing it to Obama in 2009, claiming that the Trump inauguration was basically empty.
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:26.000]  Then they debunked themselves and released a massive picture.
[3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  It was like a million gigapixel picture or something from CNN,
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:37.000]  where you could zoom out and see that the crowd stretched back all the way down the National Mall.
[3:21:37.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  And in fact, if you look at mall attendance at the Trump inauguration by the American thinker,
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:52.000]  they've got a direct link to that billion pixel interactive photograph, which is what you're seeing right now,
[3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:59.000]  that you can move around, you can zoom, and you can see that the crowd in the mall goes all the way back to the Washington Monument.
[3:21:59.000 --> 3:22:06.000]  This was a CNN picture, which they released after claiming that Sean Spicer, the then press secretary,
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:12.000]  was lying about the attendance of Trump's inauguration back in 2017.
[3:22:12.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  Now, I don't doubt for a second that Barack Obama had a larger attendance for the inauguration of the first black president in 2009,
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:30.000]  but to claim that it was basically half empty when Trump was inaugurated, which is what the media did, was completely erroneous,
[3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  based on their own picture, which you saw right there.
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:41.000]  But now they've gone even further and claimed that this was poorly attended when it was clearly extremely well attended,
[3:22:41.000 --> 3:22:49.000]  despite the weather, and they're actually trying to compare the protests and saying like that was anywhere near in comparison,
[3:22:49.000 --> 3:22:52.000]  or the protesters reigned on Trump's parade.
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:56.000]  There were literally like seven of them with the Trump balloon.
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:23:01.000]  There were literally a gaggle of 12 Antifa burning the American flag.
[3:23:01.000 --> 3:23:05.000]  The people who threw it at the Secret Service agent got arrested.
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:08.000]  It was an absolutely pathetic protest.
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:14.000]  But they're saying that it was comparable, once again, caught in a flagrant act of complete deception,
[3:23:14.000 --> 3:23:25.000]  which is why, moving on to this next report, media faces 12,000 job cuts, most since 2009 economic crash.
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:29.000]  So despite the good job numbers today, which came out earlier this morning,
[3:23:29.000 --> 3:23:35.000]  the American media will be hit with nearly 12,000 job cuts in 2019,
[3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:38.000]  the highest number since the economic crisis of 2009.
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:45.000]  And again, that is the main reason, or one of them at least, why they're desperately trying to de-platform to silence,
[3:23:45.000 --> 3:23:50.000]  to put out of business their competition because they're all losing their jobs.
[3:23:50.000 --> 3:23:55.000]  We saw a few weeks ago, CNN had to cut a bunch of its health department staff.
[3:23:55.000 --> 3:24:00.000]  They had to basically wipe out their London bureau because of these cuts.
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:09.000]  And now the consultancy Challenger Gray and Christmas report this week, media companies which include movies, television, publishing music and broadcast and print news
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:20.000]  announced plans to cut 15,474 jobs so far this year, of which 11,878 are from news organizations.
[3:24:20.000 --> 3:24:27.000]  This is a huge increase over 2017's 4,026 media job cuts, and according to the article at least,
[3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:32.000]  this is primarily happening due to paywalls and ad revenue.
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:40.000]  So again, Washington Post and all these big news outlets are having to survive by going behind a paywall.
[3:24:40.000 --> 3:24:43.000]  Many a time you'll see a Washington Post article linked up on Drudge.
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:47.000]  You click through, you try to read it, you can't read it without paying.
[3:24:47.000 --> 3:24:51.000]  And that's the only way they can survive with a very diminished audience,
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:56.000]  but at least an audience that's paying some money because they can't generate that money anywhere else.
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:25:00.000]  And that again is why they're having to de-platform everyone else.
[3:25:00.000 --> 3:25:07.000]  Already this year, CNN BuzzFeed had slashed over 100 and 200 jobs respectively.
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:12.000]  Verizon slashed 800 jobs at Yahoo, AOL and Huffington Post.
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:19.000]  And as John Nolte points out in this bright bar article, the reason they're slashing jobs,
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:24.000]  the reason that they're losing this resonance with the American public is because they lie over and over again,
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  as they did with the crowds at the July 4th parade yesterday.
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  He lists some examples of prominent hoaxes that the media has carried forward in the last few years.
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:37.000]  Hispanic George Zimmerman, the white racist killer.
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:39.000]  Hands up, don't shoot.
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:44.000]  Which of course, if you remember, started a wave of riots across the country
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:48.000]  and the worst race relations in decades.
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:52.000]  Because again, it was based on a complete lie that Michael Brown had his hands up
[3:25:52.000 --> 3:25:55.000]  when he was tackled by the officer. It never happened.
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:25:57.000]  Trump can't win, of course.
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:26:00.000]  Hillary Clinton, 98% certain of winning.
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  Brett Kavanaugh, serial rapist.
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  They pushed that monumental hoax for weeks and weeks and weeks.
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:10.000]  The KKK kids from KK Covington High School,
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:17.000]  harassing, doxing, exposing, smearing high school kids for standing in one position and smirking.
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:20.000]  And the whole Trump colluded with Russian narrative.
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:27.000]  Which of course is why, from April 2018 to April 2019, CNN lost 24% of its audience.
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:33.000]  Rachel Maddow literally got shaved off hundreds of thousands of viewers in prime time
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  because she relentlessly pushed that complete hoax.
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:40.000]  So they're losing their audience, they're losing their income
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:43.000]  and now laying off thousands more jobs.
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  Which is why, again, they're having to de-platform their competition.
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  Meanwhile, Democrat harasses Trump supporter for wearing MAGA hat,
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:57.000]  claims he was, quote, standing up to a Nazi.
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:00.000]  And in fact, there is a MAGA meetup, I believe,
[3:27:00.000 --> 3:27:02.000]  Jack Pasobic was tweeting about this,
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:07.000]  at this Hill Country barbecue restaurant in DC.
[3:27:07.000 --> 3:27:12.000]  Because this idiot TJ Helmstetter walked in there,
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  saw a man with a MAGA hat,
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:18.000]  immediately started harassing him, saying, are you from DC?
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:21.000]  We don't tolerate racism in DC.
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:25.000]  Literally calling him a Nazi, goes on Twitter, calls him a Nazi.
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  The restaurant, because he's harassing one of their patrons straight off the bat,
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:32.000]  kicks him out and then he whines like he's the victim.
[3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:36.000]  Basically what happened is this Trump supporter who was wearing a MAGA hat,
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:39.000]  his girlfriend confronted this guy
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  and he couldn't handle being confronted by his girlfriend.
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:44.000]  So that made him even more irate.
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:47.000]  But then again, the whole point is,
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:52.000]  he harassed a Trump supporter for wearing a MAGA hat, then got kicked out.
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:57.000]  But he thinks he's got the moral high ground because he's standing up to a Nazi.
[3:27:57.000 --> 3:28:00.000]  So every Trump supporter is a Nazi.
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:04.000]  I noticed now he's started deleting these tweets, by the way,
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  because they're not showing up in the article,
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:09.000]  because he got absolutely rinsed on Twitter.
[3:28:09.000 --> 3:28:16.000]  He's trying to say that 63 million Americans who voted for Donald Trump are all Nazis,
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:21.000]  because the benchmark for being a Nazi is wearing a MAGA hat.
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:24.000]  He's got absolutely rinsed on Twitter.
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  The restaurant rightly threw him out because he was harassing people.
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:32.000]  And now he's desperately deleting his tweets,
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  which is not going to work because the internet is forever.
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  So now this restaurant is getting death threats from tolerant progressives,
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:43.000]  like they like to sing death threats to eight-year-old AOC impersonators.
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:45.000]  They're getting death threats.
[3:28:45.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  There's going to be a police presence at this MAGA meetup,
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  but it's going to go ahead anyway.
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:29:17.000]  We'll be back with more infowars.com.
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:27.000]  We'll be back with more infowars.
[3:29:50.000 --> 3:30:00.000]  For more infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[3:30:20.000 --> 3:30:23.000]  I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart.
[3:30:23.000 --> 3:30:25.000]  I want you to know that love is right back at you.
[3:30:25.000 --> 3:30:28.000]  And I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth,
[3:30:28.000 --> 3:30:30.000]  and your prayers, and your financial support,
[3:30:30.000 --> 3:30:33.000]  because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[3:30:33.000 --> 3:30:37.000]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and it's not going to be fun,
[3:30:37.000 --> 3:30:39.000]  but that's not what's important. The enemy could win.
[3:30:39.000 --> 3:30:41.000]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[3:30:41.000 --> 3:30:44.000]  We're being used by God. You're being used by God.
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:46.000]  This is Providence, so I salute you,
[3:30:46.000 --> 3:30:49.000]  and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[3:30:49.000 --> 3:30:55.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[3:30:55.000 --> 3:30:57.000]  The time has come. The time is here.
[3:30:57.000 --> 3:31:00.000]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces
[3:31:00.000 --> 3:31:04.000]  to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders,
[3:31:04.000 --> 3:31:07.000]  and that the whole world could come here and get everything free,
[3:31:07.000 --> 3:31:09.000]  but that we, the citizens, have to pay for it.
[3:31:09.000 --> 3:31:11.000]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy,
[3:31:11.000 --> 3:31:14.000]  if we don't have major innovation and major booms,
[3:31:14.000 --> 3:31:16.000]  we will collapse into third-world status,
[3:31:16.000 --> 3:31:20.000]  and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves
[3:31:20.000 --> 3:31:23.000]  in Europe and the U.S. to collapse the countries,
[3:31:23.000 --> 3:31:26.000]  to kill capitalism, and bring in socialism
[3:31:26.000 --> 3:31:29.000]  so we can go the way of the Old Soviet Union, North Korea, and Venezuela.
[3:31:29.000 --> 3:31:31.000]  This is a plan. That's why we've got to stay on air.
[3:31:31.000 --> 3:31:34.000]  It's why you've got to keep fighting, because we're going to win this in the end.
[3:31:34.000 --> 3:31:37.000]  Thanks to you and your support. That's what makes it all possible,
[3:31:37.000 --> 3:31:39.000]  so I salute you, and I thank you, but I ask you again,
[3:31:39.000 --> 3:31:43.000]  do your shopping with us, and we will continue on in the face of this.

[3:31:50.000 --> 3:31:53.000]  and know that buying products from us is one of the most important things
[3:31:53.000 --> 3:31:55.000]  you can do in the fight against the globalist.
[3:31:55.000 --> 3:31:58.000]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena
[3:31:58.000 --> 3:32:01.000]  and the public square. The other thing that's unique about Info Wars
[3:32:01.000 --> 3:32:04.000]  is it isn't the only network of this reach
[3:32:04.000 --> 3:32:07.000]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[3:32:07.000 --> 3:32:09.000]  That's not backed by some billionaire.
[3:32:09.000 --> 3:32:11.000]  That's not being funded by secret foreign government.
[3:32:11.000 --> 3:32:13.000]  It's completely independent of all that.
[3:32:13.000 --> 3:32:16.000]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment
[3:32:16.000 --> 3:32:19.000]  in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech.
[3:32:19.000 --> 3:32:21.000]  That, in fact, the founders were so concerned with,
[3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:24.000]  at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support
[3:32:24.000 --> 3:32:26.000]  and subsidize organizations just like this,
[3:32:26.000 --> 3:32:28.000]  because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[3:32:28.000 --> 3:32:31.000]  And then ultimately, we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[3:32:31.000 --> 3:32:34.000]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[3:32:34.000 --> 3:32:37.000]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views
[3:32:37.000 --> 3:32:40.000]  the persons allowed to have, or express, or hear.
[3:32:40.000 --> 3:32:42.000]  Info Wars audience has broken through that.
[3:32:42.000 --> 3:32:45.000]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age
[3:32:45.000 --> 3:32:47.000]  ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[3:32:47.000 --> 3:32:50.000]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught
[3:32:50.000 --> 3:33:14.000]  in a majority of American fame.
[3:33:14.000 --> 3:33:18.000]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:18.000 --> 3:33:20.360]  Won't you buy the gold?
[3:33:20.360 --> 3:33:23.280]  Your backline won't fall out of the show.
[3:33:23.280 --> 3:33:25.120]  Headline up at summit.news.
[3:33:25.120 --> 3:33:27.480]  CBC accused of sexualizing children
[3:33:27.480 --> 3:33:30.480]  after promoting drag kids documentary.
[3:33:30.480 --> 3:33:33.280]  They're basically out there promoting
[3:33:33.280 --> 3:33:37.240]  and broadcasting soft porn for pedos.
[3:33:37.240 --> 3:33:38.480]  You know how I know that?
[3:33:38.480 --> 3:33:41.600]  I know that because an actual pedophile
[3:33:41.600 --> 3:33:45.560]  and convicted child molester, this is a big story last week.
[3:33:45.560 --> 3:33:47.800]  Didn't get enough attention.
[3:33:47.800 --> 3:33:50.840]  Actually wrote in a WordPress blog.
[3:33:50.840 --> 3:33:54.520]  He was basically lusting after the 12-year-old drag queen
[3:33:54.520 --> 3:33:55.360]  kid.
[3:33:55.360 --> 3:33:58.080]  Desmond is amazing.
[3:33:58.080 --> 3:34:00.560]  I'm basically saying that he was, quote, hot.
[3:34:00.560 --> 3:34:04.840]  So we know for a fact that actual pedos are lusting
[3:34:04.840 --> 3:34:07.400]  after these drag queen kids.
[3:34:07.400 --> 3:34:11.440]  One was arrested and turned out to be an actual sex offender
[3:34:11.440 --> 3:34:14.320]  one of these drag queen story times in Houston.
[3:34:14.320 --> 3:34:16.160]  We covered that story.
[3:34:16.160 --> 3:34:20.080]  Then this convicted child porn peddler
[3:34:20.080 --> 3:34:27.000]  who literally had a cache of 50,000 images of a pedo porn
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:30.920]  wrote a WordPress blog saying how hot he thought
[3:34:30.920 --> 3:34:32.800]  a 12-year-old kid was.
[3:34:32.800 --> 3:34:35.320]  It's on wordpress.com.
[3:34:35.320 --> 3:34:38.200]  In fact, I didn't even link to it in this article.
[3:34:38.200 --> 3:34:40.360]  I wanted to check if it was still there,
[3:34:40.360 --> 3:34:41.800]  if they've not removed it.
[3:34:41.800 --> 3:34:44.280]  This is WordPress, by the way, which removes
[3:34:44.280 --> 3:34:47.080]  entire right of center commentary blogs
[3:34:47.080 --> 3:34:51.320]  while hosting for months a pedophile lusting over a child.
[3:34:51.320 --> 3:34:53.520]  Oh, he doesn't get D-platformed.
[3:34:53.520 --> 3:34:55.520]  Todd Nickerson doesn't get D-platformed.
[3:34:55.520 --> 3:34:58.440]  Vice.com gives him a platform.
[3:34:58.440 --> 3:35:00.200]  So you got that going on.
[3:35:00.200 --> 3:35:03.120]  And now CBC, the Canadian broadcaster,
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:05.560]  has been accused of sexualizing children
[3:35:05.560 --> 3:35:09.000]  after it promoted a new documentary about drag kids.
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:11.360]  They've got these poor victims, which is what they are,
[3:35:11.360 --> 3:35:13.360]  is what I see them as.
[3:35:13.360 --> 3:35:17.600]  Talking about their alter egos as drag queen kids,
[3:35:17.600 --> 3:35:20.800]  while one of them, who is 12 years old,
[3:35:20.800 --> 3:35:24.640]  I don't know if it's a boy or a girl, but you best guess,
[3:35:24.640 --> 3:35:29.080]  is dancing around in denim hot pants
[3:35:29.080 --> 3:35:32.680]  while actual pedos write WordPress blogs about how
[3:35:32.680 --> 3:35:35.240]  they lost after these kids, who are being put on national
[3:35:35.240 --> 3:35:40.080]  television on an almost daily basis at this point,
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:44.240]  as soft pedo porn for wannabe child molesters.
[3:35:44.240 --> 3:35:48.480]  That's the state of progressivism in 2019.
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:53.440]  This was tweeted out by an account called CBC Kids.
[3:35:53.440 --> 3:35:55.800]  So it's not even the main CBC account.
[3:35:55.800 --> 3:36:00.280]  It's specifically a Twitter account aimed at children.
[3:36:00.280 --> 3:36:03.720]  It shows numerous minors talking about their drag alter egos,
[3:36:03.720 --> 3:36:05.600]  while one of them, a 12-year-old, performs
[3:36:05.600 --> 3:36:09.400]  what some complain was sexually suggestive dance moves.
[3:36:09.400 --> 3:36:13.360]  What's it like to be a kid drag queen CBC Kids news
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:17.080]  spoke with four of the stars of CBC's new drag kids
[3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:21.320]  documentary to find out what drag is and why they do it?
[3:36:21.320 --> 3:36:26.520]  Bear in mind, this is after the 12-year-old drag queen kid
[3:36:26.520 --> 3:36:30.160]  Desmond is amazing, who again is another victim,
[3:36:30.160 --> 3:36:35.200]  was made by his parents to perform at a gay bar in New York,
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:37.440]  while the patrons in this gay bar literally
[3:36:37.440 --> 3:36:38.800]  threw money at him.
[3:36:38.800 --> 3:36:42.360]  And some of those people, some of those gay attendees
[3:36:42.360 --> 3:36:46.320]  of that club, were themselves uncomfortable with it.
[3:36:46.320 --> 3:36:49.600]  But then the mother, this is the article,
[3:36:49.600 --> 3:36:51.800]  she went on an Australian TV show,
[3:36:51.800 --> 3:36:54.760]  this was a few weeks ago now, and said,
[3:36:54.760 --> 3:36:58.160]  I don't understand what the controversy is.
[3:36:58.160 --> 3:37:00.720]  So you've got gay people who show up to this club,
[3:37:00.720 --> 3:37:03.680]  who themselves are uncomfortable about why
[3:37:03.680 --> 3:37:07.160]  on earth a 12-year-old kid is in a gay club at night
[3:37:07.160 --> 3:37:09.840]  dancing around, while some of the other attendees
[3:37:09.840 --> 3:37:12.000]  throw money at him.
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:13.760]  And the mother says she doesn't understand
[3:37:13.760 --> 3:37:16.080]  what the controversy is.
[3:37:16.080 --> 3:37:18.360]  Meanwhile, they're literally lusting after kids
[3:37:18.360 --> 3:37:21.640]  on WordPress blogs, and they're on there for months.
[3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:24.360]  WordPress does nothing whatsoever about it.
[3:37:24.360 --> 3:37:28.800]  After literal sex offenders who were involved in these drag
[3:37:28.800 --> 3:37:32.480]  queen storytime events are being arrested,
[3:37:32.480 --> 3:37:37.960]  this is the state of progressivism in 2019, absolutely sick.
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:41.200]  We had another story the other day.
[3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:44.440]  Photoshow kids laying on top of drag queen at drag queen
[3:37:44.440 --> 3:37:46.840]  storytime event.
[3:37:46.840 --> 3:37:49.200]  This was, you guessed it, Portland, Oregon,
[3:37:49.200 --> 3:37:53.760]  the center of all debauchery and degeneracy,
[3:37:53.760 --> 3:37:56.240]  shows young children lying on top of a drag queen
[3:37:56.240 --> 3:37:59.320]  during a drag queen time story event.
[3:37:59.320 --> 3:38:01.760]  This is a St. John's Library.
[3:38:01.760 --> 3:38:04.720]  Kids aged five and under, there were literal toddlers
[3:38:04.720 --> 3:38:10.960]  at this event, frolicking on top of drag queen Carla Rossi.
[3:38:10.960 --> 3:38:13.640]  When LifeSight News drew attention to these photos,
[3:38:13.640 --> 3:38:18.520]  the Multnomah County Library's Flickr account removed them.
[3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:21.080]  So as soon as it began to attract controversy,
[3:38:21.080 --> 3:38:23.080]  the photos were removed again.
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:25.200]  They know that this is messed up.
[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:27.360]  As soon as people start complaining about it,
[3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:29.120]  they remove the photos.
[3:38:29.120 --> 3:38:30.920]  Absolutely sick.
[3:38:30.920 --> 3:38:35.480]  And now you've got CBT, Canada's premier broadcaster,
[3:38:35.480 --> 3:38:39.200]  following in the footsteps of all those American networks
[3:38:39.200 --> 3:38:43.160]  that platformed this poor victim Desmond is amazing,
[3:38:43.160 --> 3:38:46.040]  doing exactly the same thing.
[3:38:46.040 --> 3:38:49.160]  And the ratio on that tweet was quite something to behold.
[3:38:49.160 --> 3:38:51.240]  In fact, I'm surprised I haven't removed it.
[3:38:51.240 --> 3:38:53.720]  Let's see what it is now.
[3:38:53.720 --> 3:38:55.800]  This again, this is from CBT Kids.
[3:38:55.800 --> 3:39:00.280]  This is a Twitter account aimed at children.
[3:39:00.280 --> 3:39:04.440]  We've got 148 retweets, 1.7,000 responses.
[3:39:04.440 --> 3:39:07.560]  Most of them not too supportive.
[3:39:07.560 --> 3:39:09.760]  This is the state of progressivism.
[3:39:09.760 --> 3:39:13.320]  And this is the state of youth culture in 2019.
[3:39:13.320 --> 3:39:19.840]  Ethought sells her own bathwater, breaks up relationships.
[3:39:19.840 --> 3:39:22.440]  This is a 20-year-old cosplay influencer
[3:39:22.440 --> 3:39:24.840]  with 4 million Instagram followers,
[3:39:24.840 --> 3:39:29.480]  called Bell Delphine, who is literally
[3:39:29.480 --> 3:39:34.440]  retailing small pots of her own bathwater
[3:39:34.440 --> 3:39:38.680]  and selling them to desperate incels on the internet.
[3:39:38.680 --> 3:39:41.880]  She sold out after two days.
[3:39:41.880 --> 3:39:43.800]  It's basically, again, soft porn.
[3:39:43.800 --> 3:39:46.160]  I guess at least she's an adult.
[3:39:46.160 --> 3:39:48.080]  Don't play the video in this clip, by the way,
[3:39:48.080 --> 3:39:50.280]  because it basically is soft porn.
[3:39:50.280 --> 3:39:52.200]  Bell Delphine, a self-proclaimed gamer girl,
[3:39:52.200 --> 3:39:54.120]  makes money by convincing desperate men
[3:39:54.120 --> 3:39:56.640]  to give her beta books via Patreon.
[3:39:56.640 --> 3:39:58.760]  In fact, if you go on her Patreon,
[3:39:58.760 --> 3:40:03.920]  if you give her $2,500 a month on subscription,
[3:40:03.920 --> 3:40:06.680]  she says she will quote, she says,
[3:40:06.680 --> 3:40:08.560]  I'm not sure what reward I could give you,
[3:40:08.560 --> 3:40:09.880]  but we'll talk about it.
[3:40:09.880 --> 3:40:11.680]  Absolutely gross.
[3:40:11.680 --> 3:40:15.280]  I mean, at one level, you can appreciate her relentless
[3:40:15.280 --> 3:40:17.680]  entrepreneurship, as I write in the article.
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:18.960]  But when it gets to this stage,
[3:40:18.960 --> 3:40:21.640]  it's just predatory degeneracy.
[3:40:21.640 --> 3:40:24.400]  And then the tweet at the end of the article
[3:40:24.400 --> 3:40:28.800]  talks about how this woman received this package
[3:40:28.800 --> 3:40:30.320]  that was addressed to her boyfriend.
[3:40:30.320 --> 3:40:34.040]  She opened it, or he tried to hide it.
[3:40:34.040 --> 3:40:37.680]  So she made him open it, and it was a part of this bathwater
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:42.120]  that he bought from this ethot for $30.
[3:40:42.120 --> 3:40:43.600]  And basically, she dumped him,
[3:40:43.600 --> 3:40:46.440]  and their relationship is now over.
[3:40:46.440 --> 3:40:48.440]  I'm sure that was worth it.
[3:40:48.440 --> 3:40:51.280]  Another young man explained how his girlfriend broke up
[3:40:51.280 --> 3:40:53.760]  with him because he had paid to communicate privately
[3:40:53.760 --> 3:40:56.920]  with Belle Delphine via Snapchat.
[3:40:56.920 --> 3:41:01.280]  So these desperate men, even though they've got girlfriends,
[3:41:01.280 --> 3:41:04.120]  are paying hard cash to communicate
[3:41:04.120 --> 3:41:06.840]  with this 20-year-old British girl
[3:41:06.840 --> 3:41:11.680]  who wears a ton of makeup and weird anime cosplay outfits,
[3:41:11.680 --> 3:41:14.840]  and it's literally costing them their relationships.
[3:41:14.840 --> 3:41:17.040]  I mean, you can't really blame Belle Delphine
[3:41:17.040 --> 3:41:19.440]  for exploiting their desperation.
[3:41:19.440 --> 3:41:21.600]  But what kind of commentary is that
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:25.840]  on the state of masculinity in 2019?
[3:41:25.840 --> 3:41:29.680]  Meanwhile, new trend of tampering with food products
[3:41:29.680 --> 3:41:32.520]  and putting them back is going viral.
[3:41:34.520 --> 3:41:36.760]  Three different examples of this in the article,
[3:41:36.760 --> 3:41:38.560]  a new trend where people tamper with food,
[3:41:38.560 --> 3:41:40.160]  licking it or half-consuming it
[3:41:40.160 --> 3:41:43.520]  before putting it back in the container is going viral.
[3:41:43.520 --> 3:41:46.760]  This happened in the first instance
[3:41:46.760 --> 3:41:49.480]  in the city of Lufkin, eastern Texas,
[3:41:49.480 --> 3:41:52.760]  in a branch of Walmart where a woman was filmed
[3:41:52.760 --> 3:41:54.680]  opening an ice cream tub, licking it,
[3:41:54.680 --> 3:41:56.880]  and then placing it back in the freezer.
[3:41:56.880 --> 3:42:00.880]  She now faces up to 20 years in jail
[3:42:00.880 --> 3:42:03.880]  for tampering with a consumer product.
[3:42:03.880 --> 3:42:05.520]  So they've actually identified her.
[3:42:05.520 --> 3:42:06.720]  She's going to be charged.
[3:42:06.720 --> 3:42:08.560]  She's going to get at least two years in jail
[3:42:08.560 --> 3:42:10.280]  from what I read.
[3:42:10.280 --> 3:42:12.880]  But then there were a spate of other examples,
[3:42:12.880 --> 3:42:15.400]  including what appears to be a transgender individual
[3:42:15.400 --> 3:42:16.960]  taking a swig of mouthwash
[3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:20.920]  before spitting it back in the bottle and walking away.
[3:42:20.920 --> 3:42:24.320]  There's another guy called Sean Mendes,
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:28.320]  who literally tweeted the police visiting him for doing this.
[3:42:28.320 --> 3:42:32.400]  This is how narcissistic and messed up these kids are,
[3:42:32.400 --> 3:42:34.240]  that they just tweet it like it's nothing.
[3:42:34.240 --> 3:42:37.080]  They're that he could face two years in jail minimum
[3:42:37.080 --> 3:42:39.920]  and he's still on Twitter bragging about it,
[3:42:39.920 --> 3:42:42.520]  how he scoops out ice cream with his hand,
[3:42:42.520 --> 3:42:44.960]  licks it, stops it back in the tub
[3:42:44.960 --> 3:42:46.800]  and stuffs it back in the freezer.
[3:42:46.800 --> 3:42:49.360]  And he's still on Twitter bragging about it,
[3:42:49.360 --> 3:42:51.600]  even though he's probably going to jail.
[3:42:53.600 --> 3:42:57.760]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[3:42:57.760 --> 3:43:00.200]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling,
[3:43:00.200 --> 3:43:03.280]  self-supporting structure that is promoting free press
[3:43:03.280 --> 3:43:05.320]  and free speech by people getting together
[3:43:05.320 --> 3:43:08.120]  and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[3:43:08.120 --> 3:43:11.440]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale,
[3:43:11.440 --> 3:43:12.920]  of this public reach.
[3:43:12.920 --> 3:43:14.320]  It is the one model that says,
[3:43:14.320 --> 3:43:17.560]  here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[3:43:17.560 --> 3:43:20.000]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure
[3:43:20.000 --> 3:43:23.000]  that because the audience determines what content goes up,
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:25.600]  the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached
[3:43:25.600 --> 3:43:27.600]  by their choices and supporting Infowars.
[3:43:27.600 --> 3:43:29.560]  And it's all because the audience spends there,
[3:43:29.560 --> 3:43:32.480]  whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month
[3:43:32.480 --> 3:43:34.240]  on products that they like and that they want
[3:43:34.240 --> 3:43:36.720]  that actually compete with the corporate driven model
[3:43:36.720 --> 3:43:39.040]  and the ability to do that and at the same time,
[3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:42.320]  support press, support speech, support letting the audience
[3:43:42.320 --> 3:43:44.080]  choose what news they want to see
[3:43:44.080 --> 3:43:45.320]  and what views they want to hold.
[3:43:45.320 --> 3:43:47.960]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression
[3:43:47.960 --> 3:43:50.720]  and experiment and it is the celebration of free press
[3:43:50.720 --> 3:43:52.480]  and free speech with free markets.
[3:43:53.480 --> 3:43:56.000]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[3:43:56.000 --> 3:43:57.640]  We're going into the season of war
[3:43:57.640 --> 3:43:59.760]  and they have been inches from shutting down
[3:43:59.760 --> 3:44:01.240]  the final mega counts we have,
[3:44:01.240 --> 3:44:03.760]  do their criminal activity and their digital fraud
[3:44:03.760 --> 3:44:06.120]  and we need to know that we've got capital
[3:44:06.120 --> 3:44:07.560]  to go six months a year.
[3:44:07.560 --> 3:44:09.760]  We need to end here, we need to be provisioned
[3:44:09.760 --> 3:44:11.560]  and you've got my total commitment
[3:44:11.560 --> 3:44:13.640]  that I am gonna rampage forward against the enemy
[3:44:13.640 --> 3:44:16.000]  fearlessly, I'm loving every minute of this
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:18.200]  because I know I'm getting under their skin,
[3:44:18.200 --> 3:44:20.000]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically,
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:22.480]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help
[3:44:22.480 --> 3:44:25.120]  but attack back with lies and that just rings more people here.
[3:44:25.120 --> 3:44:27.000]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you
[3:44:27.000 --> 3:44:29.200]  and I need war bonds, I need gas,
[3:44:29.200 --> 3:44:31.200]  I need ammo politically now.
[3:44:31.200 --> 3:44:33.320]  But literally, if you flood us with money
[3:44:33.320 --> 3:44:35.080]  and if you flood us with product purchases
[3:44:35.080 --> 3:44:36.640]  and if you flood us with your word of mouth,
[3:44:36.640 --> 3:44:38.600]  you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[3:44:38.600 --> 3:44:40.040]  I wanna send a strong message to the enemy,
[3:44:40.040 --> 3:44:42.320]  I wanna raise a couple million dollars right now
[3:44:42.320 --> 3:44:44.440]  to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing
[3:44:44.440 --> 3:44:45.680]  and that you will stand with us
[3:44:45.680 --> 3:44:48.080]  and I will never back down, you have my commitment,
[3:44:48.080 --> 3:44:50.640]  this only gives me more energy and more understanding
[3:44:50.640 --> 3:44:53.240]  of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[3:44:54.760 --> 3:44:56.160]  There is no longer any doubt,
[3:44:56.160 --> 3:44:57.920]  multinational companies and governments
[3:44:57.920 --> 3:44:59.800]  are funding an attempted violent,
[3:44:59.800 --> 3:45:02.000]  malice style overthrow of the US,
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:04.040]  our borders are being totally collapsed,
[3:45:04.040 --> 3:45:06.800]  already born babies are being killed, world government is here.
[3:45:06.800 --> 3:45:08.120]  Now is the time for decision,
[3:45:08.120 --> 3:45:10.200]  now is the time for everyone watching and listening
[3:45:10.200 --> 3:45:11.240]  to decide which side they're on.
[3:45:11.240 --> 3:45:13.160]  And if you decide that you wanna stop the forces
[3:45:13.160 --> 3:45:15.600]  that are banning the American flag and attacking the family
[3:45:15.600 --> 3:45:17.480]  and that are attacking our borders and our country
[3:45:17.480 --> 3:45:19.040]  and our military and our heritage,
[3:45:19.040 --> 3:45:21.480]  if you wanna defend that, then now's the time to take action
[3:45:21.480 --> 3:45:23.680]  and that means word of mouth about this broadcast
[3:45:23.680 --> 3:45:26.520]  and that means buying products at infowarstore.com
[3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:28.360]  and that means praying for info wars
[3:45:28.360 --> 3:45:30.360]  and praying for President Trump and praying for yourself
[3:45:30.360 --> 3:45:32.600]  and praying for peace, praying for justice.
[3:45:32.600 --> 3:45:35.040]  We're running it through July 4th, but it's gotta end
[3:45:35.040 --> 3:45:36.720]  because we're running out a lot of the best selling items.
[3:45:36.720 --> 3:45:38.720]  We have store wide free shipping,

[3:45:46.760 --> 3:45:48.320]  you cannot meet these deals,

[3:45:51.360 --> 3:45:52.920]  or infowarslife.com.
[3:45:55.440 --> 3:45:56.880]  I talk about this on the air
[3:45:56.880 --> 3:45:58.280]  and I know it sinks into people,
[3:45:58.280 --> 3:46:00.440]  but I've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot
[3:46:00.440 --> 3:46:02.400]  all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years,
[3:46:02.400 --> 3:46:04.520]  before all the censorship and attacks
[3:46:04.520 --> 3:46:05.960]  and fake lawsuits and the rest of it,
[3:46:05.960 --> 3:46:07.840]  I would talk about how great the products are
[3:46:07.840 --> 3:46:09.560]  and how they were the best and why they were
[3:46:09.560 --> 3:46:10.880]  and I'd have doctors on an experts
[3:46:10.880 --> 3:46:12.120]  to explain why they were so good.
[3:46:12.120 --> 3:46:13.680]  And instead the last few years, I'm like,
[3:46:13.680 --> 3:46:15.320]  hey, we need to really support us
[3:46:15.320 --> 3:46:16.240]  or they'll shut us down.
[3:46:16.240 --> 3:46:17.920]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements
[3:46:17.920 --> 3:46:18.800]  because they know how great they are
[3:46:18.800 --> 3:46:19.920]  and how wonderful they were.
[3:46:19.920 --> 3:46:21.640]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[3:46:21.640 --> 3:46:24.520]  Jones sells unapproved supplements
[3:46:24.520 --> 3:46:25.880]  that he claims are supplements.
[3:46:25.880 --> 3:46:28.480]  No, under federal law since 1996,
[3:46:28.480 --> 3:46:31.840]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA
[3:46:31.840 --> 3:46:33.880]  because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[3:46:33.880 --> 3:46:35.160]  But then they say, you've got to say,
[3:46:35.160 --> 3:46:36.520]  it's not approved by them.
[3:46:36.520 --> 3:46:38.160]  And all drugs are is the system
[3:46:38.160 --> 3:46:39.640]  trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature
[3:46:39.640 --> 3:46:41.440]  and manipulate it and do different things.
[3:46:41.440 --> 3:46:42.600]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[3:46:42.600 --> 3:46:44.520]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature,
[3:46:44.520 --> 3:46:46.440]  but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing
[3:46:46.440 --> 3:46:48.120]  about God's medicine chest.

[3:48:52.680 --> 3:48:57.600]  Author, Sweden is experiencing a small scale war.
[3:48:57.600 --> 3:49:00.360]  This is Swedish author Bjorn Ranalled,
[3:49:00.360 --> 3:49:02.320]  who warns that the level of crime and violence
[3:49:02.320 --> 3:49:04.320]  that previously sedate country
[3:49:04.320 --> 3:49:06.480]  until they brought in millions of migrants
[3:49:06.480 --> 3:49:08.440]  from the Middle Eastern North Africa
[3:49:08.440 --> 3:49:12.280]  is experiencing what amounts to a small scale war.
[3:49:12.280 --> 3:49:14.800]  Ranalled cites, car fires, which were previously unknown
[3:49:14.800 --> 3:49:17.120]  but have now become commonplace across the country,
[3:49:17.120 --> 3:49:19.720]  along with an explosion in shootings.
[3:49:19.720 --> 3:49:21.680]  The author said that blaming the frustrations
[3:49:21.680 --> 3:49:24.520]  of young people for the crime wave was a cop-out,
[3:49:24.520 --> 3:49:27.320]  since his generation had it just as tough
[3:49:27.320 --> 3:49:29.480]  but didn't turn to criminality.
[3:49:29.480 --> 3:49:32.560]  He said they lived crowded in outdated apartments
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:34.920]  and the economy of many families was poor,
[3:49:34.920 --> 3:49:37.000]  but none of my hundreds of acquaintances,
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:39.520]  friends and playmates burned cars,
[3:49:39.520 --> 3:49:41.880]  robbed old people or warwars.
[3:49:41.880 --> 3:49:44.520]  And in fact, the new trend in Sweden now is
[3:49:44.520 --> 3:49:46.720]  children being robbed.
[3:49:46.720 --> 3:49:48.680]  They're telling children not to go out now
[3:49:48.680 --> 3:49:50.840]  because they're being robbed.
[3:49:50.840 --> 3:49:53.200]  And there was a big study in Kualaet
[3:49:53.200 --> 3:49:55.120]  a couple of weeks ago,
[3:49:55.120 --> 3:49:58.280]  which basically found that it's now a national emergency
[3:49:58.280 --> 3:50:01.240]  in many of these migrant ghettos in Sweden,
[3:50:01.240 --> 3:50:04.080]  the rampant crime, the grenade attacks,
[3:50:04.080 --> 3:50:07.440]  the shootings, again, the sexual violence.
[3:50:07.440 --> 3:50:10.080]  A third of young women in Sweden are now reporting
[3:50:10.080 --> 3:50:12.240]  they feel unsafe going out at night.
[3:50:12.240 --> 3:50:15.400]  Those are the ones who admit to it.
[3:50:15.400 --> 3:50:17.160]  And this has all happened under the watch
[3:50:17.160 --> 3:50:19.360]  of a feminist government that has opened the borders
[3:50:19.360 --> 3:50:22.400]  to mass immigration like never before.
[3:50:22.400 --> 3:50:25.200]  So the sprawling welfare system has failed
[3:50:25.200 --> 3:50:28.000]  to deter them from turning to crime.
[3:50:28.000 --> 3:50:30.840]  Now the head of the Swedish security today,
[3:50:30.840 --> 3:50:32.880]  Anders Thornberg, has said that
[3:50:32.880 --> 3:50:35.520]  Swedes better get used to the current conditions.
[3:50:35.520 --> 3:50:40.000]  He said, quote, this can continue for five to two years.
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:44.480]  After 10 years, Sweden is enjoying its cultural enrichment,
[3:50:44.480 --> 3:50:48.280]  just like the UK, where we have this headline,
[3:50:48.280 --> 3:50:50.880]  Afghan migrant asked people if they were English
[3:50:50.880 --> 3:50:53.920]  before attacking them with a 10-inch knife.
[3:50:55.440 --> 3:50:58.880]  So this 32-year-old asylum seeker from Afghanistan
[3:50:58.880 --> 3:51:03.000]  basically went into a bunch of supermarkets in South London,
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:06.880]  selected targeted people specifically by their nationality.
[3:51:06.880 --> 3:51:09.920]  He went up to them, asked them where they were from,
[3:51:09.920 --> 3:51:13.400]  before attempting to attack them with a 10-inch blade.
[3:51:14.400 --> 3:51:17.080]  His motive was to, quote, kill members of the public
[3:51:17.080 --> 3:51:18.840]  if they were English,
[3:51:18.840 --> 3:51:22.240]  with the asylum seeker's own cousin warning police, quote,
[3:51:22.240 --> 3:51:24.040]  he wants to kill the English people,
[3:51:24.040 --> 3:51:26.640]  I can see his eyes, he's serious, he will do it,
[3:51:26.640 --> 3:51:29.720]  he's trying to run and he will kill someone.
[3:51:29.720 --> 3:51:32.840]  So this guy actually attacked three different people,
[3:51:32.840 --> 3:51:35.200]  only by a miracle did they all escape
[3:51:35.200 --> 3:51:38.640]  any kind of serious injury or death.
[3:51:38.640 --> 3:51:39.960]  Meanwhile in France,
[3:51:39.960 --> 3:51:42.680]  Muslim youths attacked police station with projectiles
[3:51:42.680 --> 3:51:44.120]  show Alarak Bar.
[3:51:45.040 --> 3:51:47.640]  A group of 15 Muslim youths attacked a police station
[3:51:47.640 --> 3:51:49.720]  in northern France with projectiles,
[3:51:49.720 --> 3:51:51.480]  while shouting Alarak Bar,
[3:51:51.480 --> 3:51:54.040]  according to a report by Le Figaro,
[3:51:54.040 --> 3:51:57.040]  which is a left-wing newspaper in France.
[3:51:57.040 --> 3:51:58.720]  This occurred two a.m. last Friday
[3:51:58.720 --> 3:52:01.440]  in the Val de Rue Luvié police station
[3:52:01.440 --> 3:52:03.440]  in the department of Eur in France,
[3:52:03.440 --> 3:52:05.360]  the gang of hooded youths through fireworks
[3:52:05.360 --> 3:52:08.480]  and other objects, including paving stones.
[3:52:08.480 --> 3:52:10.240]  This is one of their favorite techniques,
[3:52:10.240 --> 3:52:12.720]  they like to throw fireworks at people.
[3:52:13.560 --> 3:52:16.240]  And the footage always comes out in Sweden,
[3:52:16.240 --> 3:52:19.680]  France and other areas where they're throwing fireworks
[3:52:19.680 --> 3:52:23.240]  at people, the left response to that were by saying,
[3:52:23.240 --> 3:52:25.520]  why are you afraid of fireworks?
[3:52:27.160 --> 3:52:29.960]  Literally they're throwing fireworks at people's heads
[3:52:29.960 --> 3:52:32.080]  and their response is to say,
[3:52:32.080 --> 3:52:34.760]  don't be a snowflake, you're afraid of fireworks,
[3:52:34.760 --> 3:52:37.000]  these are the same people who are literally afraid
[3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:40.720]  of words and ideas with which they disagree.
[3:52:40.720 --> 3:52:43.280]  During the attack, the gang referred to police officers
[3:52:43.280 --> 3:52:46.360]  inside the station as French effers
[3:52:46.360 --> 3:52:50.960]  while threatening them come out, we are going to burn you.
[3:52:50.960 --> 3:52:53.520]  So yet another fantastic example
[3:52:53.520 --> 3:52:58.360]  of migrant integration going so well in France.
[3:52:58.360 --> 3:53:00.240]  The entire attack lasted around 30 minutes
[3:53:00.240 --> 3:53:03.640]  during which the youths repeatedly shouted Alarak Bar,
[3:53:03.640 --> 3:53:06.240]  which means God is great in Arabic.
[3:53:06.240 --> 3:53:10.360]  They found 115 different projectiles at the scene.
[3:53:10.360 --> 3:53:15.080]  The police union said the attack was unheard of violence
[3:53:15.080 --> 3:53:17.840]  and noted that the exact same police station
[3:53:17.840 --> 3:53:20.400]  had been targeted last year.
[3:53:20.400 --> 3:53:23.160]  So it's not even the first time that it happened.
[3:53:23.160 --> 3:53:25.800]  Meanwhile, another favorite activity
[3:53:25.800 --> 3:53:28.960]  of these newly arrived visitors in Europe
[3:53:28.960 --> 3:53:32.960]  is to start riots and fights around swimming pools.
[3:53:32.960 --> 3:53:36.520]  So of course, Europe had a big heat wave last week.
[3:53:36.520 --> 3:53:39.960]  So everyone went out to the public swimming pools.
[3:53:39.960 --> 3:53:41.480]  German swimming pool closed
[3:53:41.480 --> 3:53:44.640]  after hundreds of migrants harassed family.
[3:53:44.640 --> 3:53:46.840]  This was in Düsseldorf, Germany.
[3:53:46.840 --> 3:53:48.560]  Swimming pool had to be closed twice
[3:53:48.560 --> 3:53:50.080]  after hundreds of male migrants
[3:53:50.080 --> 3:53:52.880]  harassed a family prompting a huge police deployment.
[3:53:54.160 --> 3:53:57.600]  Basically it started when they started harassing
[3:53:57.600 --> 3:54:00.440]  another migrant family, a Turkish man
[3:54:00.440 --> 3:54:02.440]  who was at the pool with his family.
[3:54:02.440 --> 3:54:06.120]  He responded by referring to the migrants as nafris,
[3:54:06.120 --> 3:54:07.880]  which is a derogatory term
[3:54:07.880 --> 3:54:11.200]  meaning North African intensive offenders.
[3:54:12.120 --> 3:54:14.280]  Large numbers of migrants began to harass the man
[3:54:14.280 --> 3:54:16.080]  and his family and police were called,
[3:54:16.080 --> 3:54:18.920]  only for them to be pelted with empty bottles upon arrival.
[3:54:18.920 --> 3:54:20.400]  So again, when the police show up
[3:54:20.400 --> 3:54:22.560]  to try to bring calm to the situation,
[3:54:22.560 --> 3:54:24.480]  they attack the police.
[3:54:24.480 --> 3:54:27.040]  We see that in similar circumstances
[3:54:27.040 --> 3:54:31.080]  where you have these car fires in these inner city ghettos
[3:54:31.080 --> 3:54:34.240]  where the fire service will come to put out the fire,
[3:54:34.240 --> 3:54:37.000]  they'll attack the fire service.
[3:54:38.400 --> 3:54:40.520]  Now they have to be accompanied by the police.
[3:54:40.520 --> 3:54:43.520]  The ambulance crews come out to attend to casualties
[3:54:43.520 --> 3:54:44.880]  with some of these riots.
[3:54:44.880 --> 3:54:46.840]  They attack the ambulance crews.
[3:54:46.840 --> 3:54:49.560]  They don't want them there because it's a no-go zone.
[3:54:49.560 --> 3:54:51.360]  But again, according to the media,
[3:54:51.360 --> 3:54:54.280]  no-go zones are a conspiracy theory.
[3:54:55.160 --> 3:54:57.120]  The pool had to be closed once again on Sunday
[3:54:57.120 --> 3:54:59.680]  due to an incident described as being similar
[3:54:59.680 --> 3:55:02.600]  to what happened on Saturday.
[3:55:02.600 --> 3:55:05.520]  So again, they had a big riot, the police came out,
[3:55:05.520 --> 3:55:07.560]  they tried to quell it, they did eventually quell it
[3:55:07.560 --> 3:55:10.800]  and then the exact same thing happened the day later.
[3:55:11.760 --> 3:55:14.120]  Breitbart reports, woman who invited migrants
[3:55:14.120 --> 3:55:17.400]  to camp in her garden now demands they leave.
[3:55:17.400 --> 3:55:19.280]  Could never seen this one coming.
[3:55:19.280 --> 3:55:21.120]  A Belgian woman who invited migrants
[3:55:21.120 --> 3:55:23.600]  to set up a makeshift camp in her garden
[3:55:23.600 --> 3:55:24.960]  now says she wants them to leave
[3:55:24.960 --> 3:55:27.600]  after incidents of aggression and violence.
[3:55:27.600 --> 3:55:30.000]  Basically, anyone could see that coming.
[3:55:30.000 --> 3:55:32.000]  She allowed a bunch of them to come and stay.
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:33.480]  They invited all their friends.
[3:55:33.480 --> 3:55:35.040]  The neighbors started complaining.
[3:55:35.040 --> 3:55:36.600]  They were fighting with the neighbors.
[3:55:36.600 --> 3:55:38.560]  They were fighting with each other.
[3:55:38.560 --> 3:55:41.000]  At the end of it, 100 migrants were staying
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:43.640]  in this woman's back garden basically.
[3:55:43.640 --> 3:55:45.880]  She later admitted she felt exhausted.
[3:55:45.880 --> 3:55:49.440]  So again, it was another virtue signalling lefty
[3:55:49.440 --> 3:55:52.640]  who thought she was doing a great humanitarian good here.
[3:55:52.640 --> 3:55:55.120]  Ended up being a complete disaster.
[3:55:55.120 --> 3:55:58.080]  Now, she regrets it.
[3:55:58.080 --> 3:56:03.080]  660,000 migrants waiting to get to Europe from Libya.
[3:56:03.080 --> 3:56:05.040]  While the number of migrants entering Europe
[3:56:05.040 --> 3:56:08.360]  has declined, reports claim that as many as 660,000
[3:56:08.360 --> 3:56:10.280]  individuals still remain in Libya
[3:56:10.280 --> 3:56:12.240]  looking for a way into Europe.
[3:56:12.240 --> 3:56:13.920]  And of course, we know why that is
[3:56:13.920 --> 3:56:16.080]  because the criminal people smugglers
[3:56:16.080 --> 3:56:19.120]  are working with the left-wing Soros-funded NGOs
[3:56:19.120 --> 3:56:21.480]  to literally pick them up from Libya
[3:56:21.480 --> 3:56:24.480]  as a taxi service to bring them into Europe.
[3:56:24.480 --> 3:56:28.280]  Matteo Salvini has put in measures to try and stop that,
[3:56:28.280 --> 3:56:30.480]  to try and disincentivise that.
[3:56:30.480 --> 3:56:33.280]  And of course, he's called a fascist for doing so,
[3:56:33.280 --> 3:56:36.880]  even though he's literally halved the number of migrant deaths
[3:56:36.880 --> 3:56:41.080]  in the Mediterranean simply by trying to disincentivise it
[3:56:41.080 --> 3:56:44.080]  and trying to target the criminal people smugglers.
[3:56:44.080 --> 3:56:48.880]  Europol 2018 stats, 24 G Haddist attacks,
[3:56:48.880 --> 3:56:51.280]  19 left-wing, only one right-wing.
[3:56:51.280 --> 3:56:55.080]  So they've done a study of terrorism in Europe in 2018.
[3:56:55.080 --> 3:56:58.280]  They found that out of all the attacks, again,
[3:56:58.280 --> 3:57:02.680]  24 were G Haddist, 19 left-wing and only one right-wing.
[3:57:02.680 --> 3:57:05.680]  So this narrative, the right-wing terrorism
[3:57:05.680 --> 3:57:08.680]  is the biggest threat, again, proven completely inaccurate
[3:57:08.680 --> 3:57:09.880]  once again.
[3:57:09.880 --> 3:57:12.680]  And when they drilled into the fatalities involved
[3:57:12.680 --> 3:57:15.480]  in terrorist attacks across Europe in 2018,
[3:57:15.480 --> 3:57:20.480]  all 13 fatalities were victims of Islamic G Haddists.
[3:57:20.480 --> 3:57:23.880]  So again, the entire narrative that the right-wing
[3:57:23.880 --> 3:57:26.680]  is the biggest terror threat, at least in Europe,
[3:57:26.680 --> 3:57:30.680]  is confounded, is debunked by the statistics.
[3:57:30.680 --> 3:57:32.480]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour
[3:57:32.480 --> 3:57:34.880]  with me breaking news at infowars.com.
[3:57:34.880 --> 3:57:37.480]  Be sure to get the products at infowarsstore.com.
[3:57:37.480 --> 3:57:39.680]  Coming up next is Warren with Owen Shroyer.
[3:57:39.680 --> 3:57:41.480]  We'll be back. Don't go away.
[3:57:41.480 --> 3:57:43.480]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[3:57:43.480 --> 3:57:45.480]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[3:57:45.480 --> 3:57:48.480]  And the way they did so is because they faced no consequence.
[3:57:48.480 --> 3:57:50.480]  Social, economic, political, or legal
[3:57:50.480 --> 3:57:52.480]  for their illicit activities over two decades.
[3:57:52.480 --> 3:57:54.480]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges,
[3:57:54.480 --> 3:57:56.480]  the juries, the members of the independent free press
[3:57:56.480 --> 3:57:58.480]  that care about this, the ordinary members of the public
[3:57:58.480 --> 3:58:00.480]  and the audience that care about this
[3:58:00.480 --> 3:58:03.480]  have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[3:58:03.480 --> 3:58:04.480]  to their course of conduct.
[3:58:04.480 --> 3:58:05.480]  Otherwise, they will never change,
[3:58:05.480 --> 3:58:07.480]  and they will become the big tech oligarchs
[3:58:07.480 --> 3:58:09.480]  equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[3:58:09.480 --> 3:58:11.480]  who ran American politics and ran American economy
[3:58:11.480 --> 3:58:14.480]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover
[3:58:14.480 --> 3:58:15.480]  after the Great Depression.
[3:58:15.480 --> 3:58:18.480]  The informer's audience is the fuel that flames
[3:58:18.480 --> 3:58:20.480]  the light of liberty across the world
[3:58:20.480 --> 3:58:23.480]  to make real the actions of independent free speech,
[3:58:23.480 --> 3:58:26.480]  to make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[3:58:26.480 --> 3:58:28.480]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media
[3:58:28.480 --> 3:58:30.480]  manipulating and working with each other
[3:58:30.480 --> 3:58:33.480]  to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[3:58:33.480 --> 3:58:35.480]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time
[3:58:35.480 --> 3:58:36.480]  it's not happening.
[3:58:36.480 --> 3:58:37.480]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[3:58:37.480 --> 3:58:39.480]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[3:58:39.480 --> 3:58:42.480]  Even it is what we just saw.
[3:58:42.480 --> 3:58:45.480]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[3:58:45.480 --> 3:58:46.480]  Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[3:58:46.480 --> 3:58:48.480]  Hey, Eric. Yeah, I just want to say
[3:58:48.480 --> 3:58:50.480]  your show is a breath of fresh air.
[3:58:50.480 --> 3:58:52.480]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City,
[3:58:52.480 --> 3:58:55.480]  and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees
[3:58:55.480 --> 3:58:56.480]  with these wars.
[3:58:56.480 --> 3:58:58.480]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately
[3:58:58.480 --> 3:59:00.480]  to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[3:59:00.480 --> 3:59:03.480]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him
[3:59:03.480 --> 3:59:05.480]  in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[3:59:05.480 --> 3:59:07.480]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this,
[3:59:07.480 --> 3:59:08.480]  it'll be the end of his presidency.
[3:59:08.480 --> 3:59:10.480]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated
[3:59:10.480 --> 3:59:11.480]  other than assassinating him.
[3:59:11.480 --> 3:59:13.480]  It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[3:59:13.480 --> 3:59:14.480]  I agree entirely.
[3:59:14.480 --> 3:59:15.480]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex,
[3:59:15.480 --> 3:59:17.480]  is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[3:59:17.480 --> 3:59:19.480]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[3:59:19.480 --> 3:59:22.480]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[3:59:22.480 --> 3:59:24.480]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[3:59:24.480 --> 3:59:27.480]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[3:59:27.480 --> 3:59:29.480]  You've won a lot of battles,
[3:59:29.480 --> 3:59:31.480]  and there are a lot of people like myself
[3:59:31.480 --> 3:59:33.480]  and many others who are going to continue.
[3:59:33.480 --> 3:59:35.480]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[3:59:35.480 --> 3:59:37.480]  And even if something does happen to you or your show,
[3:59:37.480 --> 3:59:40.480]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people
[3:59:40.480 --> 3:59:41.480]  fired up for liberty.
[3:59:41.480 --> 4:00:10.480]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
