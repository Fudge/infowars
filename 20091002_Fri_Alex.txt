[00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:09.671]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.671 --> 00:00:11.252]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:12.813]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:17.016]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:21.059]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:24.992]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:26.192]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:34.136]  I am Jason Burmiss sitting in this Friday, October 2nd, 2009.
[00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:41.159]  Alex will be joining us shortly as he is in Hardin, Montana at the scene of what has blown up
[00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:52.124]  In the mainstream media, the latest article out of the AP now being covered by MSNBC, being covered by USA Today, you don't think you make a difference out there?
[00:00:52.124 --> 00:01:01.008]  It is because of this radio program that people are up in arms, that privatized foreign military forces are being trained
[00:01:02.543 --> 00:01:05.045]  At a facility in our country folks.
[00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:08.827]  Yes, this is the beginning of the takeover.
[00:01:08.827 --> 00:01:16.112]  We warned you about National Level Exercise 09 that occurred this August.
[00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:20.015]  Coincidentally, in FEMA Region 6, which did include Montana.
[00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:25.448]  And now you have this guy with a confirmed 17 aliases!
[00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:26.229]  17!
[00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.891]  That's what the AP is reporting.
[00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:32.755]  Not over a dozen, 17 aliases.
[00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:41.743]  With judgments from civil cases that he's lost totaling more than 1.1 million dollars from the scams he's run before.
[00:01:41.743 --> 00:01:43.825]  And finally something is being done.
[00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:46.307]  There have been probes launched
[00:01:47.188 --> 00:01:48.088]  Into this debacle.
[00:01:48.088 --> 00:01:49.389]  Let me read you this.
[00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:50.589]  Out of the Associated Press.
[00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:51.950]  Again, breaking news.
[00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:05.715]  Montana's Attorney General has launched an investigation into a California company's plan to take over City of Hardin's $27 million dollar jail following the revelations that the company's lead figure is a convicted felon with a history of fraud.
[00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:22.728]  Michael Hilton, who formed Santa Ana, California-based American Police Force in March, remember, it's not American, it's not a police force, talk about Orwellian, came to Hardin last month promising to build the city's never-used jail and build an adjacent military and law enforcement training center.
[00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:27.051]  Let's not forget he also promised the people free health care, animal shelters,
[00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:30.954]  You know, everything rainbow and unicorns, we're here to save you!
[00:02:30.954 --> 00:02:38.179]  They always go to a destitute area, somewhere where the economy has been completely blown out for years.
[00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:45.685]  They come in and say, yes, we can save this town if you'll only let us have privatized military forces running it.
[00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:46.986]  And by the way, they won't be U.S.
[00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:48.247]  military forces.
[00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:53.311]  They'll be from Serbia, they'll be from Germany, they'll be from the Ukraine.
[00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:53.952]  What is this?
[00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:04.396]  Hilton has a decades-long track record of fraudulent activities and spent several years in a California prison on grand theft charges.
[00:03:04.396 --> 00:03:08.519]  The native of Montenegro uses at least at least 17 aliases.
[00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.092]  And, you know, they've reported two years in prison.
[00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:15.495]  They've reported six years in prison.
[00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.276]  I think they're taking the average here.
[00:03:17.276 --> 00:03:26.284]  Attorney General Steve Bullock said Thursday he is asking Hardin officials for all documents related to their dealings with Hilton and American Police Force.
[00:03:26.284 --> 00:03:27.565]  And that's the update.
[00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:30.068]  Here's the original article they posted.
[00:03:30.068 --> 00:03:34.612]  Michael Hilton showed up in Hardin, Montana last week presenting himself as an economic savior.
[00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:45.723]  The man who would take over the town's $27 million jail, empty since it was first built as a development project in 2007, and provide 200 new jobs in the process.
[00:03:45.723 --> 00:03:49.345]  Remember, this supersedes administrations.
[00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:51.666]  This is the new world order.
[00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:53.047]  This is incrementalism.
[00:03:53.047 --> 00:03:56.709]  They started under Bush, they continue it under Obama.
[00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.650]  And I still haven't seen this on Fox News.
[00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.831]  I haven't seen this on CNN Headline News.
[00:04:00.831 --> 00:04:03.473]  I haven't seen this on MSNBC's television program.
[00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:12.721]  Let's hope it breaks into the television mainstream today because all they're talking about are tsunamis and earthquakes and natural disasters.
[00:04:12.721 --> 00:04:15.904]  They're keeping away from this topic.
[00:04:15.904 --> 00:04:23.010]  He wore military-style uniform and as a gesture to local law enforcement, offered up the use of three Mercedes SUVs.
[00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.615]  And remember, these SUVs were labeled American Police Force as though they were law enforcement.
[00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:31.216]  They are not law enforcement.
[00:04:32.017 --> 00:04:33.798]  They are not police.
[00:04:33.798 --> 00:04:37.219]  This is a privatized organization.
[00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:45.603]  But the man who styles himself as a military veteran turned private sector entrepreneur and a California defense contractor with an extensive government contract also has another image.
[00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:50.106]  And that one is provided by public documents and interviews with associates and legal adversaries.
[00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:52.447]  We'll be back after this Alex Jones coming up.
[00:04:52.447 --> 00:04:53.547]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:53.547 --> 00:04:56.869]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting in PrisonPlanet.TV InfoWars.com
[00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:08.010]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.093]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[00:05:14.093 --> 00:05:16.754]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:17.054 --> 00:05:23.340]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.404]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.404 --> 00:05:32.770]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.092]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:35.092 --> 00:05:36.854]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.854 --> 00:05:39.377]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.377 --> 00:05:44.102]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:44.102 --> 00:05:47.826]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.826 --> 00:05:50.949]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.851]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:54.953]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:06:00.666 --> 00:06:02.807]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:06:02.807 --> 00:06:05.227]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:06:05.227 --> 00:06:07.488]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:07.488 --> 00:06:09.048]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:09.048 --> 00:06:10.769]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:13.650]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.291]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:06:26.948 --> 00:06:33.082]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:06:33.082 --> 00:06:34.204]  An inside job.
[00:06:35.609 --> 00:06:37.089]  How dare you?
[00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:43.111]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:45.812]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:06:45.812 --> 00:06:52.474]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:09.671]  Toxins are in our foods, and chemicals are in our air.
[00:07:09.671 --> 00:07:11.931]  Chemicals are in our water supply.
[00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:17.813]  We purify our air and we purify our water, and yet we forget to purify our bodies.
[00:07:17.813 --> 00:07:22.955]  Funny, our bodies continue to absorb these deadly toxins and chemicals every day.
[00:07:22.955 --> 00:07:24.316]  Isn't it time to make a change?
[00:07:24.836 --> 00:07:26.417]  Maybe a life change?
[00:07:26.417 --> 00:07:29.258]  Get rid of toxins and chemicals.

[00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.532]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.532 --> 00:08:10.313]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:11.874]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:12.795]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.795 --> 00:08:17.639]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:22.603]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:24.044]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:24.044 --> 00:08:26.126]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.126 --> 00:08:30.390]  Alex will be joining us from the streets of Hardin, Montana, shortly.
[00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.371]  But we have even more breaking news.
[00:08:32.371 --> 00:08:35.354]  Literally, over the break, I get handed this.
[00:08:36.542 --> 00:08:41.325]  It's not bad enough that Michael Hilton has 17 known aliases.
[00:08:41.325 --> 00:08:49.130]  It's not bad enough that he has been charged with 14 counts of grand theft in the past and other crimes.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.225]  He has an outstanding warrant in Wyoming according to the local news and he has not appeared in court.
[00:08:57.225 --> 00:09:00.847]  The arrest warrant was issued after he failed to appear in court.
[00:09:00.847 --> 00:09:06.391]  This is out of KULR and we are going to play the news clip later on in the program.
[00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:12.215]  We're also going to play this video clip of riot police attacking students who aren't even
[00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:13.795]  They're not even on the scene.
[00:09:13.795 --> 00:09:19.658]  They're watching from a balcony from campus and they fire tear gas up the stairs.
[00:09:19.658 --> 00:09:24.841]  They send a couple of riot cops up the stairs to corral these people who aren't doing anything.
[00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:33.473]  But you know, the willfully ignorant out there will just tell me there were no military on the streets, there were no LRAD weapons, the police did a good thing.
[00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:34.273]  It's insanity.
[00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:37.133]  We're going to be playing that video later in the show.
[00:09:37.133 --> 00:09:48.176]  But right now, without further ado, let's go to the KULR local newscast where they admit this Hilton character, which isn't even his real name, has an outstanding warrant in Wyoming.
[00:09:48.176 --> 00:09:48.756]  Let's go to it.
[00:09:49.136 --> 00:09:53.877]  ...has launched an investigation into a California company's plan to take over the Hardin Jail.
[00:09:53.877 --> 00:09:59.879]  The probe came one day after the criminal past of American police force leader Michael Hilton is revealed.
[00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:05.781]  Yesterday, concerned Montana citizens showed up at the Hardin Jail, joining officials in the quest for answers.
[00:10:05.781 --> 00:10:08.761]  Colorado's Nick Law went to Hardin and has the details.
[00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:10.062]  Hello!
[00:10:10.062 --> 00:10:10.702]  Anybody home?
[00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:20.103]  Tony Myers drove from Columbus, Montana in search of answers in the ongoing story between the Hardin Jail and American police force.
[00:10:20.103 --> 00:10:24.605]  I just want to know who they are, why they're coming here, who they're bringing in.
[00:10:24.605 --> 00:10:27.626]  My job is not to give you the answers that you want.
[00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:34.208]  My job is to give you the information that I have been employed to release or not release.
[00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:40.870]  Caught in the crossfire is APF spokesperson Becky Shea, who spent all day answering questions from media members and the public.
[00:10:41.297 --> 00:10:49.342]  After an AP story linked the security firm's leader, Michael Hilton, to multiple bankruptcies and convictions for more than a dozen felonies.
[00:10:49.342 --> 00:10:50.863]  There were no surprises.
[00:10:50.863 --> 00:10:57.527]  Michael disclosed this information to me before I agreed to come to work for him.
[00:10:57.527 --> 00:11:05.973]  Shea and TRA Vice President Al Peterson both say they knew about the convictions long before the report came out, but are still confident in APF.
[00:11:05.973 --> 00:11:10.716]  I firmly believe APF is legitimate and a solid corporation.
[00:11:11.135 --> 00:11:23.301]  Peterson declined an on-camera interview, but released this statement saying, quote, I believe that the TRA has a better chance of getting the detention facility open with APF than with any Montana officials.
[00:11:23.301 --> 00:11:25.862]  What do we have to lose if it doesn't work out?
[00:11:25.862 --> 00:11:26.783]  End quote.
[00:11:26.783 --> 00:11:31.645]  APF also continues to stand firm on its stance to not release the parent company.
[00:11:31.645 --> 00:11:34.926]  That information won't be disclosed.
[00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:38.008]  But Myers and others like her pledge to continue their research.
[00:11:38.653 --> 00:11:42.220]  They're putting in a criminal to watch criminals?
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.586]  And try to get to the bottom of the mystery behind the Hardin Jail.
[00:11:45.586 --> 00:11:48.831]  Reporting in Hardin, Nick Law, Color 8 News.
[00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.911]  Calls to Michael Hilton were not returned.
[00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:59.976]  APF spokesperson Becky Shea says Hilton is currently in California on business and is expected back in Hardin in the next couple of weeks.
[00:11:59.976 --> 00:12:10.722]  Well, court records from Orange County, California indicate Michael Hilton has a lengthy criminal past, including a six-year prison sentence for a dozen counts of grand theft and other charges.
[00:12:10.722 --> 00:12:15.866]  Court documents show more than a decade of courtroom appearances for Hilton, starting in 1982 through 1999 on charges
[00:12:18.507 --> 00:12:22.769]  Including bad checks, fraud, breach of contract, and grand theft.
[00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:30.652]  After his release from prison, court documents indicate he was entangled in at least three civil lawsuits alleging fraud or misrepresentation.
[00:12:30.652 --> 00:12:35.213]  And we learned just yesterday there's a warrant out for Hilton's arrest in Wyoming.
[00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:39.495]  A Sheridan County, Wyoming circuit court judge issued a warrant September 1st.
[00:12:40.175 --> 00:12:47.859]  A court clerk says he was ticketed for driving with a suspended driver's license on Interstate 90 in Sheridan County on August 15th.
[00:12:47.859 --> 00:12:51.361]  The arrest warrant was issued after he failed to appear in court.
[00:12:52.304 --> 00:12:57.046]  It just disgusts me that the man refuses an interview.
[00:12:57.046 --> 00:12:58.046]  We're not talking about Michael Hilton.
[00:12:58.046 --> 00:13:00.687]  We're talking about one of the TSRA guys.
[00:13:00.687 --> 00:13:01.787]  He refuses an interview.
[00:13:01.787 --> 00:13:04.669]  He says, what do we have to lose?
[00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:06.209]  Well, I'll tell you what we have to lose.
[00:13:06.209 --> 00:13:08.070]  We have our humanity to lose.
[00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.191]  We have our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, our freedoms to lose.
[00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:16.533]  When you bring in foreign criminals, foreign criminals,
[00:13:17.253 --> 00:13:26.827]  To run a privatized military facility where they will be training other foreigners and cooperating with local and tribal officials.
[00:13:26.827 --> 00:13:27.809]  It's the end of America.
[00:13:27.809 --> 00:13:29.050]  That's what you have to lose.
[00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.035]  You have this country to lose, sir.
[00:13:32.035 --> 00:13:33.176]  How dare you!
[00:13:34.158 --> 00:13:36.180]  But it's all about the almighty dollar.
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.022]  And everybody's saying how nice Becky Shea is, and I'm sure she's a really nice person.
[00:13:40.022 --> 00:13:44.126]  But she just outright tells you, I'm not here to answer your questions.
[00:13:44.126 --> 00:13:47.668]  I'm here to tell you what my bosses said was okay to tell you.
[00:13:47.668 --> 00:13:51.691]  And we won't disclose who really owns us.
[00:13:51.691 --> 00:13:54.474]  You know, this story came out the 12th of September.
[00:13:55.379 --> 00:13:57.020]  A little over three weeks ago.
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:02.864]  And here's another name to kind of throw out there and see what our great listeners can find out.
[00:14:02.864 --> 00:14:07.867]  In Santa Ana, an American police force occupies a single suite on the second floor of a two-story office building.
[00:14:07.867 --> 00:14:17.614]  During a visit to the location Thursday, a reporter for the Associated Press encountered a uniformed man behind a desk who would only identify himself as Captain Michael.
[00:14:17.614 --> 00:14:19.795]  Of course, this is Michael Hilton, a.k.a.
[00:14:19.795 --> 00:14:22.337]  whatever, Doyogovich.
[00:14:22.337 --> 00:14:24.739]  That's one of his favorite aliases, Mr. Doyogovich.
[00:14:25.619 --> 00:14:30.684]  The man declined to discuss basic details about the company and referred the reporter to the company's website.
[00:14:30.684 --> 00:14:36.931]  In a subsequent phone interview, he provided his surname but insisted it's not to be used because of security concerns.
[00:14:36.931 --> 00:14:38.873]  The man said he was a naturalized U.S.
[00:14:38.873 --> 00:14:44.558]  citizen born in Montenegro with decades of experience in military and law enforcement operations.
[00:14:45.399 --> 00:14:48.001]  The man said his boss is a retired U.S.
[00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:50.464]  Army colonel named Richard Culver.
[00:14:50.464 --> 00:14:52.125]  Let's repeat that for people.
[00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:57.791]  His boss is supposedly a United States Army colonel.
[00:14:57.791 --> 00:14:59.792]  Someone else selling us down the river.
[00:14:59.792 --> 00:15:02.215]  Someone else who's going along to get along.
[00:15:02.215 --> 00:15:04.837]  Someone else who's just taking orders.
[00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:11.063]  Yeah, the Nazis just took orders too while they were putting caps in the back of the heads of dissidents, communists, and Jews.
[00:15:12.847 --> 00:15:15.109]  Richard Culver, who is currently overseas.
[00:15:15.109 --> 00:15:19.952]  Culver's role with the company could not be immediately verified.
[00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:25.857]  The company's claim of a headquarters address is just up the street from the White House!
[00:15:25.857 --> 00:15:26.817]  So you do the math.
[00:15:26.817 --> 00:15:29.219]  You figure out how high up the chain this goes.
[00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:35.844]  This is obviously a globalist program, but the federales know all about it and are probably sponsoring it.
[00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:42.722]  So Colonel Richard Culver is another person we need to look into immediately.
[00:15:42.722 --> 00:15:46.844]  We need to find a background on.
[00:15:46.844 --> 00:15:55.526]  And I can only thank you listeners out there for getting this story to your friends, your family, the local news outlets, the major talk shows out there.
[00:15:55.526 --> 00:16:00.927]  Because now they've at least launched a probe and hopefully we can stop this before it goes too far.
[00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:06.389]  Before this becomes the norm in our already morally defunct society.
[00:16:07.711 --> 00:16:09.673]  What is everybody talking about today?
[00:16:09.673 --> 00:16:13.075]  Oh, David Letterman admitted he had affairs with co-workers.
[00:16:13.075 --> 00:16:14.356]  Who cares?
[00:16:14.356 --> 00:16:17.259]  Oh, another millionaire talk show host had an affair?
[00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:19.080]  Big shocker!
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.461]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:16:20.461 --> 00:16:22.163]  Who cares?
[00:16:22.163 --> 00:16:23.704]  What's the other big story?
[00:16:23.704 --> 00:16:26.987]  John left John and Kate Plus 8!
[00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:30.269]  What a crappy, horrible show.
[00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:33.752]  Who wants to sit there and watch a couple bicker over their children?
[00:16:33.752 --> 00:16:35.093]  I feel bad for the kids.
[00:16:36.087 --> 00:16:37.728]  But that's what people are talking about.
[00:16:37.728 --> 00:16:40.050]  That's what the word on the street is.
[00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.731]  The talk around the water cooler.
[00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:48.956]  It's not that privatized foreign military forces are in Montana right now practicing takeovers.
[00:16:48.956 --> 00:16:51.718]  Saying, yeah, we'll train your privatized military force.
[00:16:51.718 --> 00:16:54.080]  We'll train your local police force.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.881]  We're here to help.
[00:16:55.881 --> 00:17:00.325]  And remember, it was thrown around that this was going to be Guantanamo West.
[00:17:01.141 --> 00:17:04.746]  And we confirmed that with Jones inside the facility, seeing the paperwork.
[00:17:04.746 --> 00:17:09.051]  And of course, Becky Shea says, Oh, that was here when we got here.
[00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:13.077]  But then she won't disclose the company that was in charge beforehand.
[00:17:13.077 --> 00:17:19.205]  So we don't know if that company is one in the same as the company that really owns APF.
[00:17:20.219 --> 00:17:23.760]  And what a deceptive, disgusting name.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.561]  American Police Force.
[00:17:25.561 --> 00:17:27.622]  It gives the air of authority.
[00:17:27.622 --> 00:17:30.423]  It gives the air that it's part of this country.
[00:17:30.423 --> 00:17:31.463]  It is neither.
[00:17:31.463 --> 00:17:38.746]  And then they have the cojones to sit there and put the Serbian flag above it.
[00:17:38.746 --> 00:17:41.306]  The double-headed eagle with a crown over top.
[00:17:41.306 --> 00:17:45.448]  Kind of letting you know, laughing in your face, saying, yeah, it's American Police Force, all right.
[00:17:48.989 --> 00:17:50.930]  Oh my goodness.
[00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.771]  So USA Today has also done a follow-up story.
[00:17:53.771 --> 00:17:55.472]  Let's read some of this.
[00:17:55.472 --> 00:18:04.515]  We posted an item yesterday about the secretive California security company called American Police Force that was set to take over operations of a never-used jail in Hardin, Montana.
[00:18:04.515 --> 00:18:13.079]  APF raised eyebrows in the town after Mercedes SUVs belonging to the company arrived bearing decals that read, City of Hardin Police Department.
[00:18:14.144 --> 00:18:24.835]  The company and the city's economic development arm that has neglected to deal with APF refused to give details about its plans including where it expects to get prisoners to put in the jail.
[00:18:24.835 --> 00:18:28.198]  Today comes word from the Billings Gazette which has been following the story closely.
[00:18:28.198 --> 00:18:34.604]  The Montana Attorney General Steve Bullock has launched an investigation into APF to find out what's going on.
[00:18:35.495 --> 00:18:45.964]  That came after the newspaper and the Associated Press published stories yesterday saying that Michael Hilton, the apparent founder of APF, and he's not the founder, he is a front man.
[00:18:45.964 --> 00:18:54.031]  He's not the founder, who claims to be a military veteran, has a lengthy criminal record, and has served time in prison in California.
[00:18:54.031 --> 00:19:02.138]  The Attorney General has sent a nine-page demand letter to Becky Shea, a former Gazette reporter who is now a spokesperson for APF.
[00:19:02.879 --> 00:19:08.921]  Remember, she sat there and she said, yeah, you know, I was driving a really horrible car, but they threw some money at me.
[00:19:08.921 --> 00:19:12.362]  Now I'm riding around in a black SUV with a gas card.
[00:19:12.362 --> 00:19:13.202]  Everything's okay.
[00:19:13.202 --> 00:19:14.342]  It's the new America.
[00:19:14.342 --> 00:19:17.463]  We'll sell our soul for the almighty dollar.
[00:19:17.463 --> 00:19:19.464]  Which isn't almighty, by the way.
[00:19:19.464 --> 00:19:21.945]  It's losing more and more of its ground daily.
[00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:25.928]  And by the way, we're going to get to some financial news.
[00:19:25.928 --> 00:19:29.491]  Yesterday, IMF says global economic recovery has begun.
[00:19:29.491 --> 00:19:38.880]  But then today, they said it could be stifled if we don't go for the merger between the IMF, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve, the total banker takeover.
[00:19:39.855 --> 00:19:41.117]  It's a sick joke, folks.
[00:19:41.117 --> 00:19:42.539]  We got Alex Jones coming up.
[00:19:42.539 --> 00:19:44.061]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:44.061 --> 00:19:46.064]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[00:19:46.064 --> 00:19:51.993]  More to come after the break, including that video of riot police attacking Pittsburgh students.
[00:19:51.993 --> 00:19:54.237]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:09.882]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[00:21:15.538 --> 00:21:15.918]  Let's do it!
[00:21:39.209 --> 00:21:43.372]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[00:21:43.372 --> 00:21:48.235]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.

[00:21:59.122 --> 00:21:59.863]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:00.984 --> 00:22:03.005]  There are many guarantees in this world.
[00:22:03.005 --> 00:22:06.568]  The closest I can come to a guarantee is that the dollar is going to zero.
[00:22:06.568 --> 00:22:14.112]  During the great hyperinflation in Weimar, Germany, people who had worked all their lives and invested conservatively were wiped out, reduced to poverty.
[00:22:14.112 --> 00:22:16.934]  There are many parallels between the Weimar and the U.S.
[00:22:16.934 --> 00:22:17.434]  today.
[00:22:17.434 --> 00:22:18.315]  I'll send you a list.
[00:22:18.315 --> 00:22:27.361]  There are ways to protect yourself from hyperinflation, gold and silver, and legal and constitutional ways to avoid confiscation, which is becoming highly probable.
[00:22:27.361 --> 00:22:29.422]  I'm Bob Moss with Midas Resources.
[00:22:29.702 --> 00:22:34.888]  Many of the people I talked to today are aware of trouble coming, but haven't taken action to protect themselves.
[00:22:34.888 --> 00:22:39.974]  There is, in fact, a financial tsunami coming, and it could fall upon us quickly with little warning.
[00:22:39.974 --> 00:22:40.875]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:22:40.875 --> 00:22:41.776]  Protect yourself.
[00:22:41.776 --> 00:22:43.678]  Call me today, Bob Moss, at 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[00:22:48.223 --> 00:22:51.306]  That's Bob Moss, Midas Resources, 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[00:22:51.306 --> 00:22:53.728]  Again, that's Bob Moss, 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[00:23:01.368 --> 00:23:02.949]  Are you constantly tired?
[00:23:02.949 --> 00:23:04.809]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:08.091]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[00:23:08.091 --> 00:23:11.112]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.

[00:24:21.317 --> 00:24:22.078]  We are back.
[00:24:22.078 --> 00:24:23.220]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:29.868]  I'm Jason Verma sitting in Alex on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[00:24:29.868 --> 00:24:32.972]  And you know, what do you expect when you don't take interest in your government?
[00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:37.638]  What do you expect when nine out of ten people can't tell you what the three branches of government even are?
[00:24:39.121 --> 00:24:42.322]  Well, these guys are going to continue to encroach on our freedoms.
[00:24:42.322 --> 00:24:44.283]  They're going to continue their takeover.
[00:24:44.283 --> 00:24:46.444]  They're going to continue to blow out the economy.
[00:24:46.444 --> 00:24:52.025]  They're going to continue to bring in privatized, military, Blackwater-type forces.
[00:24:52.025 --> 00:24:55.827]  And they're going to continue to hire criminals to run the operations.
[00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:57.947]  Because guess what?
[00:24:57.947 --> 00:25:01.009]  Criminals don't give a damn about you and your family.
[00:25:01.009 --> 00:25:02.549]  They're sociopaths.
[00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:04.250]  They care about themselves.
[00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:08.071]  They care about their house, their money, their power.
[00:25:09.275 --> 00:25:11.216]  They don't care about the greater good.
[00:25:11.216 --> 00:25:25.064]  And you sit here and you look at this USA Today article I was just reading, Montana Attorney General Probes Secretive American Police Force, and this guy, Michael Hilton, is in what appears to be a police uniform.
[00:25:26.408 --> 00:25:31.510]  You know, that's why it's so important that you support the alternative media, that you support InfoWars.com.
[00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:36.453]  And I want to remind everybody that Fall of the Republic is coming soon and you can pre-order it today.
[00:25:36.453 --> 00:25:38.293]  It launches October 21st.
[00:25:38.293 --> 00:25:40.855]  It may even ship out a little bit earlier.
[00:25:40.855 --> 00:25:43.316]  You know, it's been done now for almost a week.
[00:25:44.306 --> 00:25:50.675]  It's out to press, and of course it'll be available for all the great PrisonPlanet.TV viewers first.
[00:25:50.675 --> 00:25:59.166]  But when you have a hardened criminal, in hardened Montana, no pun intended, with an admitted, now an admitted,
[00:26:00.307 --> 00:26:02.709]  9.8% unemployment rate in this country.
[00:26:02.709 --> 00:26:03.729]  And it's higher, folks.
[00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:04.790]  I promise you.
[00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.253]  It is much, much higher than 9.8%.
[00:26:08.253 --> 00:26:12.396]  Publicly, we are almost at 10% unemployment.
[00:26:12.396 --> 00:26:14.398]  Do you understand what that means?
[00:26:14.398 --> 00:26:15.999]  As they blow out the dollar?
[00:26:15.999 --> 00:26:17.900]  As they admit a world currency?
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.542]  Special Drawing Rights Unit?
[00:26:20.262 --> 00:26:27.486]  And they've been talking about this for quite some time, launched it at the G20 in April, continued it in the G20 in Pittsburgh.
[00:26:27.486 --> 00:26:28.867]  You know what you're going to see more of?
[00:26:28.867 --> 00:26:36.050]  You're going to see more of police on the streets, in Darth Vader costumes, attacking innocent people.
[00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:40.252]  And we've only got a couple minutes left in this segment, but I want to play some of this.
[00:26:40.252 --> 00:26:46.035]  Out of Pittsburgh, this occurred Thursday night where they just attacked students who aren't even on the streets.
[00:26:46.035 --> 00:26:46.856]  Let's go to that video.
[00:27:00.014 --> 00:27:14.825]  You know, for some context, and we're going to be showing this live at PrisonPlanet.TV later, the people shooting this video are on a balcony on campus when they start to launch tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters a couple hundred feet away.
[00:27:16.141 --> 00:27:18.403]  And what you're hearing there is that attack.
[00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:20.184]  Pop, pop, pop, pop!
[00:27:20.184 --> 00:27:22.205]  Pop, pop, pop, pop!
[00:27:22.205 --> 00:27:25.027]  But that's not enough!
[00:27:25.027 --> 00:27:26.848]  Those pop, pop, pop, pop, that's not enough!
[00:27:26.848 --> 00:27:32.132]  They're gonna go up the stairs and corral the students that aren't even on the streets and tear gas them as well.
[00:27:32.132 --> 00:27:32.853]  Let's pull the video.
[00:27:33.806 --> 00:27:35.367]  We're going to go to it much later.
[00:27:35.367 --> 00:27:39.871]  We're going to play it for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers at the top of the third hour.
[00:27:39.871 --> 00:27:42.033]  We're going to have Peter Dale Scott in studio.
[00:27:42.033 --> 00:27:50.899]  We're going to go to Bob Chapman and of course Alex Jones coming up in the next segment to really break down what's going on in the streets of Hardin, Montana.
[00:27:50.899 --> 00:27:52.140]  This story has blown up.
[00:27:53.393 --> 00:27:54.674]  Because of you great listeners.
[00:27:54.674 --> 00:27:57.415]  Because of the power within you.
[00:27:57.415 --> 00:27:59.096]  And don't tell me you don't have any power.
[00:27:59.096 --> 00:28:01.217]  Don't tell me you can't change things.
[00:28:01.217 --> 00:28:03.718]  Don't sit there like a baby.
[00:28:03.718 --> 00:28:04.699]  You're a grown man.
[00:28:04.699 --> 00:28:06.399]  You're a grown woman.
[00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:10.381]  Whether you're in your teens, your twenties, your thirties, or beyond.
[00:28:10.381 --> 00:28:13.083]  It's time to stop acting like a child.
[00:28:13.083 --> 00:28:21.927]  It's time to stop sucking our thumbs, and asking for our ba-bas, and getting in a fetal position, and acting like we're powerless cowards.
[00:28:23.134 --> 00:28:35.500]  You know, we played that local news story in the last segment where this woman goes right up to the new militarized foreign police facility, if you can even call it that, because they're not real police.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.621]  And at least she's standing up for herself.
[00:28:37.621 --> 00:28:39.462]  At least she's standing up for her community.
[00:28:39.462 --> 00:28:42.223]  She drove in from what I believe was Columbus, Montana.
[00:28:43.362 --> 00:28:51.924]  And anybody who's in driving range of that state, whether it be one, two, or three-hour drive, you're in 180 miles of that thing, get out there!
[00:28:51.924 --> 00:28:53.285]  Let them know you're displeased.
[00:28:53.285 --> 00:28:58.206]  Let them know it's not okay to say that we have a secret owner.
[00:28:58.206 --> 00:29:03.167]  And by the way, that secret owner works with Colonel Richard Culver of the U.S.
[00:29:03.167 --> 00:29:06.848]  Army, and he's hired a foreign criminal!
[00:29:06.848 --> 00:29:09.729]  Somebody who's spent time in a state penitentiary!
[00:29:09.729 --> 00:29:10.829]  Somebody who is currently
[00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:15.773]  Under an open warrant in Wyoming.
[00:29:15.773 --> 00:29:17.675]  I can't make this stuff up.
[00:29:17.675 --> 00:29:19.897]  Why would I want to make this stuff up?
[00:29:19.897 --> 00:29:23.822]  This is a nightmare scenario.
[00:29:23.822 --> 00:29:26.425]  But again, people want to talk about John and Kate Plus 8.
[00:29:26.425 --> 00:29:28.907]  They want to talk about David Letterman and his penis.
[00:29:28.907 --> 00:29:30.409]  Who cares?
[00:29:30.409 --> 00:29:31.410]  It's Johnny Nonsense.
[00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.753]  We've got real issues to deal with.
[00:29:35.572 --> 00:29:37.893]  We're gonna come back after this with Alex Jones.
[00:29:37.893 --> 00:29:39.013]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:39.013 --> 00:29:41.013]  I'm Jason Vermas sitting in.
[00:29:41.013 --> 00:29:51.175]  Go check out the latest over at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:29:51.175 --> 00:29:52.556]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.556 --> 00:29:55.096]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.096 --> 00:29:57.777]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.952]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.952 --> 00:30:09.297]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.297 --> 00:30:11.338]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.338 --> 00:30:16.342]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.342 --> 00:30:17.523]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.523 --> 00:30:18.644]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.644 --> 00:30:20.525]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.525 --> 00:30:21.606]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.606 --> 00:30:23.808]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.808 --> 00:30:25.149]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:26.470]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:31.934]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.934 --> 00:30:35.516]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.516 --> 00:30:39.339]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.339 --> 00:30:40.559]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:41.460]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.561]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.561 --> 00:30:43.321]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.321 --> 00:30:44.302]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.582 --> 00:30:47.643]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.643 --> 00:30:48.163]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:48.163 --> 00:30:50.764]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:50.764 --> 00:30:51.924]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:51.924 --> 00:30:55.685]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.586 --> 00:31:13.467]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.467 --> 00:31:19.949]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.949 --> 00:31:21.929]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.929 --> 00:31:24.390]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:35.292]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.586 --> 00:31:39.247]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.247 --> 00:31:41.107]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:41.107 --> 00:31:48.010]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:56.273]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.273 --> 00:31:57.854]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.854 --> 00:32:00.895]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.895 --> 00:32:03.836]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:32:05.759 --> 00:32:06.120]  I think so.
[00:32:21.428 --> 00:32:21.588]  I think.
[00:32:50.638 --> 00:32:55.799]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:32:55.799 --> 00:33:13.883]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[00:33:13.883 --> 00:33:14.684]  We are back.
[00:33:14.684 --> 00:33:16.424]  Alex Jones coming up in this segment.
[00:33:16.424 --> 00:33:18.725]  He's going to be calling in from Hardin, Montana.
[00:33:18.725 --> 00:33:19.905]  Boots on the ground.
[00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:25.332]  But first I want to thank some of our great sponsors that make this show possible.
[00:33:25.332 --> 00:33:26.472]  eFoods Direct.
[00:33:26.472 --> 00:33:28.654]  That's eFoods Direct.
[00:33:28.654 --> 00:33:30.656]  We don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.

[00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:35.940]  That's 1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.281]  And of course, our great sponsor, New Silver Solution.
[00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:54.022]  People all over the world are discovering the benefits of Supernatural Silver.
[00:33:54.022 --> 00:33:57.163]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com and check them out.

[00:34:05.765 --> 00:34:06.985]  New Silver Solution.
[00:34:06.985 --> 00:34:07.946]  That's SilverSolutions.com.
[00:34:10.390 --> 00:34:17.160]  Or you can go to SupernaturalSilver.com and you can go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlan.com and click on the big banner.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.442]  It's SupernaturalSilver.com.
[00:34:21.317 --> 00:34:23.619]  Alright, let's get back into this news.
[00:34:23.619 --> 00:34:48.521]  As we militarize our police force, as we blur the line between the military and police, as we eviscerate posse comitatus, which really hangs by a thread, and by the way, I walked up to over a dozen military personnel ranging from a newbie who was 18 years old to a general who was 50 years old, and not one of them could tell me what posse comitatus was.
[00:34:48.521 --> 00:34:49.342]  And they were talking to me!
[00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:53.321]  You know, at first, you know, they'd answer my questions shortly.
[00:34:53.321 --> 00:34:54.661]  Sometimes they would engage me.
[00:34:54.661 --> 00:35:01.945]  As soon as they engaged me, I would go back over with the camera and I would say, hey, what do you have to say to critics that would say that this is a violation of posse comitatus?
[00:35:01.945 --> 00:35:03.766]  Well, I don't know what that is.
[00:35:03.766 --> 00:35:08.748]  And then the one gentleman who said he did know what that was, I looked at him, I pointed the camera in his direction.
[00:35:08.748 --> 00:35:10.509]  I said, well, please tell us.
[00:35:10.509 --> 00:35:11.869]  And he just kind of gave me a blank stare.
[00:35:11.869 --> 00:35:14.811]  I'm like, well, why did you say you knew it if you didn't know it?
[00:35:16.584 --> 00:35:22.248]  You would have been the first soldier to actually tell me what Posi Comitatus is.
[00:35:22.248 --> 00:35:34.257]  And once that's gone, once you have military roaming on the streets, once you say it's okay for foreign troops to occupy America, what do we have left?
[00:35:34.257 --> 00:35:36.238]  And that's what we have in Hardin, Montana.
[00:35:36.238 --> 00:35:38.360]  You have a multiple felon.
[00:35:39.144 --> 00:35:41.365]  Again, this is all over the news now.
[00:35:41.365 --> 00:35:46.309]  Somebody with an open warrant, wearing a badge, and this one's out of the morning call.
[00:35:46.309 --> 00:35:53.753]  You know, when we go to PrisonPlanet.tv, at the top of the third hour, you'll see these pictures, and he's wearing what appears to be a badge.
[00:35:53.753 --> 00:35:59.937]  He's sitting in front of a City of Hardin waterworks sign in a, you know, a government building.
[00:35:59.937 --> 00:36:03.860]  He's got a badge on there that says American Police Force.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.741]  He's not the police!
[00:36:05.741 --> 00:36:07.442]  He's not even Michael Hilton!
[00:36:08.749 --> 00:36:20.093]  He's an outstanding felon who served prison time, who has had civil judgments weighed against him to the tune of more than a million dollars.
[00:36:20.093 --> 00:36:24.354]  Folks, I may never see a million dollars in my entire lifetime.
[00:36:24.354 --> 00:36:27.335]  And this guy is losing lawsuits of over a million dollars?
[00:36:27.335 --> 00:36:29.376]  What does that tell you?
[00:36:29.376 --> 00:36:31.677]  Is this the person that you want to entrust
[00:36:32.927 --> 00:36:39.134]  With a privatized prison system that's going to have a training facility for foreign mercenaries?
[00:36:39.134 --> 00:36:39.975]  It's nightmarish!
[00:36:39.975 --> 00:36:41.197]  It's outlandish!
[00:36:41.197 --> 00:36:42.638]  It's the new America.
[00:36:42.638 --> 00:36:42.919]  With a K.
[00:36:44.952 --> 00:36:57.006]  And you know, as we slide down this, as we say it's okay for riot police and military to engage the populace at the G20 in Pittsburgh, this is out of the Washington Times yesterday.
[00:36:57.006 --> 00:37:01.370]  DHS helps local police buy military sonnet devices.
[00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:04.314]  Yes, the LRADs are going to be going nationwide.
[00:37:05.796 --> 00:37:07.577]  With the help of Homeland Security Grants.
[00:37:07.577 --> 00:37:17.783]  Remember, Homeland Security was set up after 9-11, not for Al-Qaeda, not for the Taliban, not for the terrorists, but for you and me.
[00:37:17.783 --> 00:37:19.344]  Believe it.
[00:37:19.344 --> 00:37:35.034]  That's why Michael Chertoff, who headed up the organization after Tom Ridge, when he was part of the Attorney General's Office, he was the head of the Criminal Division, he was contacted by Robert Wright, who was a former FBI agent, who had followed the money
[00:37:35.834 --> 00:37:36.395]  We've been lobbed.
[00:37:36.395 --> 00:37:37.876]  This is all in my film Fabled Enemies.
[00:37:37.876 --> 00:37:42.219]  You can get it over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:42.219 --> 00:37:49.065]  And he said he had information on how this operation was funded, how the money moved, who was involved.
[00:37:49.065 --> 00:37:50.807]  Now he contacted Judicial Watch.
[00:37:50.807 --> 00:38:00.194]  Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch personally called Michael Chertoff, the then head of the criminal division in the Attorney General's office.
[00:38:00.194 --> 00:38:01.816]  What did Michael Chertoff have to say to him?
[00:38:02.776 --> 00:38:04.117]  This is what he said to him.
[00:38:04.117 --> 00:38:07.360]  We don't have time for conspiracy theories.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.502]  Sit down and shut up.
[00:38:09.502 --> 00:38:11.403]  Because this isn't about Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:11.403 --> 00:38:13.625]  This isn't about the Taliban.
[00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:15.507]  This isn't about the Middle East and the terrorists.
[00:38:15.507 --> 00:38:21.692]  We set up Homeland Security, which he later heads, which he later heads for the American people.
[00:38:21.692 --> 00:38:28.298]  And that's why you're seeing the DHS supply LRAD weapons to police departments nationwide.
[00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:30.351]  Let me read it.
[00:38:30.351 --> 00:38:36.963]  With the help of Homeland Security grants, police departments nationwide looking to subdue unruly crowds and political protesters.
[00:38:36.963 --> 00:38:38.566]  They want to take away your free speech.
[00:38:38.566 --> 00:38:41.011]  They want to put you in what's called a free speech zone.
[00:38:42.179 --> 00:38:42.719]  We're good to go.
[00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:09.712]  Let me repeat that for you.
[00:39:09.712 --> 00:39:19.302]  They're using LRADs on people at town hall meetings that don't want the clause to kill Granny.
[00:39:19.302 --> 00:39:21.064]  Yes, they are death panels.
[00:39:21.064 --> 00:39:24.567]  When Newsweek does a cover story with an unplugged
[00:39:25.564 --> 00:39:31.210]  Life support device and it says the case for killing granny and why it's the right thing to do?
[00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:33.232]  You're not allowed to say no!
[00:39:33.232 --> 00:39:35.934]  You're gonna get hit with an LRAD weapon!
[00:39:35.934 --> 00:39:38.937]  And believe me, you will disperse when you hear this thing go off.
[00:39:38.937 --> 00:39:49.948]  Officers were captured last week on video using the devices against protesters at the Group of 20 summit in Pittsburgh, causing many to cover their ears or disperse to escape the shrieking sound.
[00:39:50.268 --> 00:40:04.757]  San Diego-based American Technology Corporation insists the device is manufactured and sales are not intended to be used as sonic weapons, but rather to influence the behavior and gain compliance, compliance, from people.
[00:40:06.305 --> 00:40:20.795]  But the company stated in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in September 2008 that the device is capable of sufficient acoustic output to cause damage to human hearing or human health, expressing concern that this is a misuse and could lead to lawsuits.
[00:40:20.795 --> 00:40:22.777]  I sure hope it leads to lawsuits.
[00:40:22.777 --> 00:40:27.240]  I sure hope people stand up and say, yeah, I don't want to get hit with an acoustical device.
[00:40:28.424 --> 00:40:31.064]  And this is going to be deployed all around the country.
[00:40:31.064 --> 00:40:45.867]  Remember, it's not for Al-Qaeda, it's not for the Taliban, it's not for the insurgency, it's for you and me, when we don't like what the government is doing, when we don't care for what the establishment is pushing on us.
[00:40:45.867 --> 00:40:51.868]  At town hall meetings about healthcare, this is how we're going to use the LRAD weapons?
[00:40:51.868 --> 00:40:54.669]  And I'm sure they're going to be training all these foreign mercs.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:00.082]  Up in Hardin, Montana on how to use these LRAD weapons.
[00:41:00.082 --> 00:41:01.803]  How to round people up.
[00:41:01.803 --> 00:41:03.864]  How to gain compliance.
[00:41:03.864 --> 00:41:07.686]  Oh, they'll gain compliance when they shoot a rubber bullet in your eye.
[00:41:07.686 --> 00:41:12.489]  They'll gain compliance when they launch tear gas at you and your family.
[00:41:12.489 --> 00:41:13.309]  It's sick.
[00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:14.230]  It's disturbing.
[00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.311]  It's beyond disgusting.
[00:41:16.311 --> 00:41:18.132]  And this is our country.
[00:41:18.132 --> 00:41:20.673]  This is what our forefathers fought and died for.
[00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:24.950]  When are we going to say no?
[00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:26.511]  When are we going to say it's gone too far?
[00:41:26.511 --> 00:41:34.652]  When are we going to demand the abolishment of this unruly bureaucracy we call the Department of Homeland Security?
[00:41:34.652 --> 00:41:38.833]  I saw plenty of DHS officers on the scene over in Pittsburgh.
[00:41:38.833 --> 00:41:40.073]  You know what I didn't see?
[00:41:40.073 --> 00:41:41.213]  Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:41.213 --> 00:41:43.454]  Al-Qaeda did not make an appearance at the G20.
[00:41:43.454 --> 00:41:45.474]  What do you know?
[00:41:45.474 --> 00:41:48.915]  Yet they're still using these acoustical devices en masse.
[00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:51.830]  You know, they always beta test this stuff.
[00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:54.331]  When was the first time you saw it launched?
[00:41:54.331 --> 00:42:02.733]  Well, the first time it was on television was back in 2004 when the Republican National Convention came to New York City and they said, yeah, we'll put it on the top of police trucks.
[00:42:02.733 --> 00:42:05.194]  Yeah, we'll put it on the back of vans.
[00:42:05.194 --> 00:42:09.154]  Yeah, we'll hit unruly crowds that don't want to go into their free speech areas with it.
[00:42:09.154 --> 00:42:11.255]  No big deal.
[00:42:11.255 --> 00:42:12.215]  And we clamor for it.
[00:42:12.215 --> 00:42:12.995]  We love it.
[00:42:12.995 --> 00:42:18.697]  I see people on the comment board defending the actions of the riot police.
[00:42:18.697 --> 00:42:19.657]  What's happened to us?
[00:42:20.595 --> 00:42:22.917]  Why have we become so docile, so dumbed down?
[00:42:22.917 --> 00:42:26.180]  Do we really care that much about our Monday night football?
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:36.849]  Are we that enthralled with Grey's Anatomy and House that we can't take the time to say no to DHS and acoustic weapons around the country?
[00:42:36.849 --> 00:42:42.313]  That we can't take the time to say no to foreign mercenaries on the streets of Hardin, Montana?
[00:42:42.313 --> 00:42:47.257]  To privatize prison systems openly run by felons and the U.S.
[00:42:47.257 --> 00:42:47.738]  military?
[00:42:49.295 --> 00:42:54.359]  With that being said, let's go to Alex Jones right now on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[00:42:54.359 --> 00:42:55.881]  Alex?
[00:42:55.881 --> 00:43:00.444]  Jason, we are here in Hardin, Montana in front of the detention center again.
[00:43:00.444 --> 00:43:07.210]  It was a circus here yesterday with at least 30 locals showing up while we were here in just one hour.
[00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.292]  Then we came back later.
[00:43:09.292 --> 00:43:13.175]  Other locals were showing up, driving through to see what was happening.
[00:43:13.175 --> 00:43:15.397]  Of course, since then, the Attorney General
[00:43:16.335 --> 00:43:28.445]  The state of Montana has launched a major investigation into American police force and also the Two Rivers Authority here.
[00:43:28.445 --> 00:43:39.714]  And I sent Paul Watson some emails last night of local news out of Billings and also out of Hardin, but I didn't see those up on PrisonPlanet.com this morning.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:41.301]  I'm good.
[00:43:55.894 --> 00:44:00.856]  Police Force, Harden Police with a double-headed eagle and a center of the crest.
[00:44:00.856 --> 00:44:13.281]  So that is indeed going on and was on the front page of the Harden Weekly newspaper that was published yesterday and is on newsstands here.
[00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:25.366]  So, bottom line, this is a classic example of how any mercenary firm, no matter how disreputable their head is, can just come into a town, come into a
[00:44:26.278 --> 00:44:29.500]  $27 million dollar detention facility.
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:36.124]  Nine months ago they were trying to, and we've confirmed this with them inside, trying to turn this into Guantanamo Bay West.
[00:44:36.124 --> 00:44:46.290]  We saw the maps, the blueprints on the walls for enemy combatants and for holding quote alien prisoners.
[00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.531]  They're not talking about the kind from Mars.
[00:44:48.531 --> 00:44:50.332]  And so all of that is going on here.
[00:44:50.332 --> 00:44:53.574]  There's also a bizarre sign on the gate
[00:44:54.615 --> 00:44:57.577]  And I'm going to email these to Watson and Kirk today to get them posted.
[00:44:57.577 --> 00:45:04.841]  That we noticed inside the gate when you're leaving, it says no hostages will be allowed through this gate.
[00:45:04.841 --> 00:45:08.503]  And yes, it says no hostages will be allowed through this gate.
[00:45:08.503 --> 00:45:09.964]  Very, very bizarre.
[00:45:09.964 --> 00:45:12.146]  The mystery just deepens here.
[00:45:12.146 --> 00:45:16.028]  Also, they were claiming and using the logos and names of Blackwater, Blackwater.
[00:45:16.784 --> 00:45:22.345]  Has said that they're not affiliated with this group, but Blackwater has a history of being deceptive.
[00:45:22.345 --> 00:45:23.805]  And that's the problem with all these groups.
[00:45:23.805 --> 00:45:24.925]  We don't know what the truth is.
[00:45:24.925 --> 00:45:34.827]  I was in a bizarre press conference yesterday as the spokeswoman for American Police Force inside the prison.
[00:45:34.827 --> 00:45:39.528]  I was there with several newspapers, several local TV stations from Billings.
[00:45:39.528 --> 00:45:42.348]  And they were saying, I will not tell you who owns American Police Force.
[00:45:42.348 --> 00:45:45.169]  And they were literally yelling at her, demanding to know
[00:45:46.231 --> 00:45:51.194]  She started crying, saying that she can't tell people.
[00:45:51.194 --> 00:45:57.837]  Now, we were hoping that this guy was just a con artist once we discovered this, that that was where it ended.
[00:45:57.837 --> 00:46:13.366]  But he has purchased all these new cars, he has already given money to the local community, he was promising to build a homeless shelter, this huge military command base, has had all this personnel through the town.
[00:46:14.426 --> 00:46:22.429]  And was able to put down the two plus million dollar per year lease.
[00:46:22.429 --> 00:46:24.390]  Two million plus.
[00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:27.191]  It's in the paper, I think it's 2.3 million going from memory.
[00:46:27.191 --> 00:46:40.997]  So he was able to come up with all this money and then he has all these convictions in different states and convicted of running every scam and all these big civil judgments against him and all these strange aliases that he has.
[00:46:41.914 --> 00:46:50.040]  The question is, how could it just be a complete scam by this gentleman, whatever his real name is, Captain Hilton.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.982]  Captain Michael Hilton, as he's known by the locals.
[00:46:52.982 --> 00:46:58.966]  How could he come in and lease this and pay the money to the Two Rivers Authority?
[00:46:58.966 --> 00:47:09.673]  That's why they still think he's legitimate and say, well, even if he has this bad background, he's at least paid the money and we need to do something with this detention facility.
[00:47:09.673 --> 00:47:10.414]  On top of that,
[00:47:11.744 --> 00:47:15.425]  You have the locals paying for the infrastructure for this facility.
[00:47:15.425 --> 00:47:22.068]  You have foreign, shadowy investors who they won't mention two years ago that paid to have the $27 million facility built.
[00:47:22.068 --> 00:47:25.129]  To be technical, it's not on the reservation.
[00:47:25.129 --> 00:47:27.210]  Some of our guests we've had on were incorrect about that.
[00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:28.390]  I've got the local city maps.
[00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:33.052]  It's on the border of the Crow Nation reservation.
[00:47:33.052 --> 00:47:39.214]  We've also discovered from local newspaper reporters that there was a discussion a year and a half ago by the governor
[00:47:41.683 --> 00:47:42.765]  I'm getting some breakup.
[00:47:42.765 --> 00:47:44.126]  Jason, can you hear me?
[00:47:44.126 --> 00:47:47.109]  I can hear you, but the breakup is... I can hear that as well.
[00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.790]  Well, I'm gonna call you back.
[00:47:48.669 --> 00:47:54.133]  All right, Alex, before you go, I would also like to point out that our listeners did fish out this piece of information.
[00:47:54.133 --> 00:48:05.523]  This is out of an Associated Press article on September 12th, where he would only mention that his name was Captain Michael, but in an interview with this gentleman, he said that his boss is a retired U.S.
[00:48:05.523 --> 00:48:10.146]  Army colonel named Richard Culver, who is currently overseas.
[00:48:10.146 --> 00:48:14.250]  Culver's role with the company could not be immediately verified.
[00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:14.930]  So we need
[00:48:15.851 --> 00:48:18.573]  We need our listeners to do double time.
[00:48:18.573 --> 00:48:21.756]  We need you out there finding out who this Culver character is.
[00:48:21.756 --> 00:48:23.157]  What are his ties?
[00:48:23.157 --> 00:48:25.058]  Who are his financial backers?
[00:48:25.058 --> 00:48:26.639]  Where is this money coming from?
[00:48:26.639 --> 00:48:28.080]  Why is he overseas?
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.404]  Why has he taken an interest in foreign mercenaries?
[00:48:32.404 --> 00:48:36.327]  In foreign mercenaries taking over Hardin, Montana.
[00:48:36.327 --> 00:48:40.970]  In a privatized military facility that was built in 2007.
[00:48:44.554 --> 00:48:50.258]  Once again, you know, this Michael Hilton character is saying that his boss is a retired U.S.
[00:48:50.258 --> 00:48:53.641]  Army colonel named Richard Culver, who is currently overseas.
[00:48:53.641 --> 00:49:00.906]  So we really have to look into Culver's background, who he's been doing dealings with, and who supplies him with his money.
[00:49:00.906 --> 00:49:01.186]  Jones?
[00:49:01.186 --> 00:49:06.270]  I think it's also important to note that we can't believe anything that
[00:49:07.768 --> 00:49:12.109]  This Hilton character says, so that may be completely made up.
[00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:14.669]  He may just be stalling for time there.
[00:49:14.669 --> 00:49:17.050]  At this point, we don't know what the truth is.
[00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:32.493]  We just know that three black Mercedes SUVs came in here about a week and a half ago with the name
[00:49:34.103 --> 00:49:35.824]  I've got some locals coming up saying hi.
[00:49:35.824 --> 00:49:37.304]  Hi folks, we're going to be on in just a second.
[00:49:37.304 --> 00:49:38.485]  I'm live on the radio.
[00:49:38.485 --> 00:49:43.067]  Thanks.
[00:49:43.067 --> 00:49:46.748]  The point is, got distracted by some folks coming up, sorry.
[00:49:46.748 --> 00:49:50.189]  The issue here is, where do they get the money for the lease?
[00:49:50.189 --> 00:49:58.353]  And then they say, they won't say how much, they say it's paid a large portion of the two plus million dollars that is the yearly lease on the $27 million facility.
[00:49:58.353 --> 00:50:00.994]  And the three black Mercedes SUVs,
[00:50:03.049 --> 00:50:07.791]  Then showed up, they did have Hardin police on the side.
[00:50:07.791 --> 00:50:13.313]  He has shown up at, and I pulled up the old news articles on this from last month.
[00:50:13.313 --> 00:50:24.897]  He has showed up at different city council meetings where the city of Hardin is voting to begin the process in the last month.
[00:50:25.885 --> 00:50:32.811]  To get rid of the Bighorn Sheriff's Department as their police force.
[00:50:32.811 --> 00:50:41.378]  And so they admit they are looking, and were looking, at giving it over to this Hilton Characters company.
[00:50:41.378 --> 00:50:48.524]  So you have this convicted felon that's going to run a secretive detention facility, paramilitary training facility, and going to run the local police department.
[00:50:48.524 --> 00:50:49.905]  It is true they were trying to do that.
[00:50:50.868 --> 00:50:52.493]  Back with Alex Jones after this.
[00:50:52.493 --> 00:50:56.585]  It's the Alex Jones Show, the latest at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.

[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.601]  A new world order.
[00:52:05.601 --> 00:52:10.465]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:52:10.465 --> 00:52:13.328]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:13.328 --> 00:52:16.110]  Put their objective being world domination.
[00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:18.512]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:26.581]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:29.619 --> 00:52:35.063]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:52:35.063 --> 00:52:38.925]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:52:38.925 --> 00:52:41.507]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:52:41.507 --> 00:52:42.668]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:42.668 --> 00:52:43.448]  They're not after money.
[00:52:43.448 --> 00:52:44.729]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:44.729 --> 00:52:45.710]  They're after power.
[00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:46.871]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:52:58.378 --> 00:52:59.539]  You have been warned.
[00:53:02.041 --> 00:53:04.062]  Remain in your houses.
[00:53:04.062 --> 00:53:09.827]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:53:09.827 --> 00:53:11.188]  Will they do it?
[00:53:11.188 --> 00:53:13.789]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:19.754]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:53:20.254 --> 00:53:22.456]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:53:22.456 --> 00:53:26.738]  Executive Order 10-9-90 locks down all highways.
[00:53:26.738 --> 00:53:31.621]  Executive Order 10-9-95 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:53:31.621 --> 00:53:36.525]  Executive Order 10-9-98 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:53:36.525 --> 00:53:41.348]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.

[00:54:13.636 --> 00:54:14.997]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:14.997 --> 00:54:19.318]  Alex, live right now on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[00:54:19.318 --> 00:54:21.179]  Alex?
[00:54:21.179 --> 00:54:29.381]  Yes, I've gotten out of the car out here and I noticed that some locals from Billings are here and they noticed the sign that I noticed.
[00:54:29.381 --> 00:54:30.602]  Sandy is here from Billings.
[00:54:30.602 --> 00:54:35.023]  Sandy, tell folks on the radio what this sign hanging on the prison says.
[00:54:35.023 --> 00:54:40.445]  It says, notice, no hostages will exit through this gate and it also has it listed in Spanish.
[00:54:41.468 --> 00:54:44.091]  So this is just a crazy, crazy facility.
[00:54:44.091 --> 00:54:46.313]  What do you think of this whole situation?
[00:54:46.313 --> 00:54:51.718]  It's just very odd and very creepy and spooky.
[00:54:51.718 --> 00:55:00.007]  Apparently the Montana Attorney General is now investigating the American Police Force group because of all the controversy swirling around this.
[00:55:00.687 --> 00:55:01.227]  Absolutely.
[00:55:01.227 --> 00:55:04.108]  Well, I'm really glad, Jason, that we came out here to investigate this.
[00:55:04.108 --> 00:55:07.289]  I know that the feds are federalizing everything.
[00:55:07.289 --> 00:55:18.372]  If some shyster can come in here, whoever he really is, and take over a $27 million facility, and start driving around in patrol cars with the Serbian Kres saying, harden police, imagine what the big international...
[00:55:19.252 --> 00:55:23.235]  Bankers can do with the tens of trillions of dollars they've stolen from us.
[00:55:23.235 --> 00:55:26.157]  I think that's the number one moral of this story.
[00:55:26.157 --> 00:55:29.239]  Now, I'm going to go to the City Council meeting tonight, a special meeting.
[00:55:29.239 --> 00:55:34.563]  I'm about to go over to the Bighorn Sheriff's Department and try to talk to them, but I'm told they get very aggressive when you try to talk to them.
[00:55:34.563 --> 00:55:36.985]  They've hung up on us when we've called.
[00:55:36.985 --> 00:55:39.867]  We're also going to go over to the Mayor's office.
[00:55:39.867 --> 00:55:45.411]  We're going to go over to the Two Rivers Authority office and really try to get some answers
[00:55:46.263 --> 00:55:51.588]  Here today, what's going on, but a bizarre FEMA camp where they admitted they wanted to hold enemy combatants.
[00:55:51.588 --> 00:55:57.233]  Maps on the wall saying it's for enemy combatants and aliens, alien prisoners.
[00:55:57.233 --> 00:56:00.436]  It gets stranger and stranger and stranger.
[00:56:00.436 --> 00:56:07.963]  And then also you have locals with rumors spinning out of control and emails flying around.
[00:56:07.963 --> 00:56:09.865]  But what do you expect to happen?
[00:56:10.565 --> 00:56:18.510]  When you have such a secretive organization doing all of this, but I think it's safe to say that Mr. Hilton is going to be kicked off of this project.
[00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:21.252]  You know, I can't really judge the Two Rivers Authority.
[00:56:21.252 --> 00:56:23.314]  They probably just got conned in this whole thing.
[00:56:23.314 --> 00:56:29.097]  Most of the locals, you know, want to see this attention center used for something, but that's the other big issue.
[00:56:29.097 --> 00:56:32.800]  A lot of the locals are concerned, saying it's built right on the edge of the reservation.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:40.145]  And they're just going to start arresting people for petty offenses to get money out of them in this giant facility.
[00:56:40.145 --> 00:56:42.487]  I mean, this is a jail.
[00:56:42.487 --> 00:56:50.614]  This is a detention center that a major city of several hundred thousand could easily use.
[00:56:50.614 --> 00:56:53.256]  This is not something out here in the middle of nowhere.
[00:56:53.256 --> 00:56:55.818]  I mean, when you leave the town of Hardin, three and a half thousand people,
[00:56:56.398 --> 00:57:00.240]  You may drive for 10-15 minutes before you even see a house or a light.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:01.820]  It is pitch black out here at night.
[00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:12.805]  So in the middle of nowhere, there is this gigantic, shadowy facility with some weird con artist with a foreign accent running around with German paramilitary in tow, Jason.
[00:57:12.805 --> 00:57:15.186]  It just gets stranger and stranger and stranger.
[00:57:16.172 --> 00:57:27.101]  Absolutely, and I think that some of the big points that we need to make is that they put somebody who was a convicted felon, who now they're reporting over 17 aliases, in charge of this.
[00:57:27.101 --> 00:57:37.310]  It's also taking place in Montana, where they just had this NLE09 exercise, where they worked with foreign military, foreign businesses, and black ops.
[00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:41.554]  You know, I want to know what their involvement in that drill was, and whether this was... They did it so many times!
[00:57:42.014 --> 00:57:51.264]  When we look at other mercenary organizations, they have other criminals running them, and they usually use a criminal as their front person so they can just discredit them later.
[00:57:51.264 --> 00:57:59.974]  That is probably what's going on here, or he may just be a complete con artist, but where did he get all the money to pay the down payment if he is nothing but a con artist?
[00:57:59.974 --> 00:58:02.176]  This is very, very serious and quite a mystery.
[00:58:02.777 --> 00:58:11.381]  Absolutely, and let's not forget that Becky Shea and another official said that they were well aware of his criminal background before it hit the news media this week.
[00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:15.143]  So they knew what they were getting into by getting this guy on board, Alex!
[00:58:15.882 --> 00:58:20.063]  Well, she has said that, but she said that he told her this last Friday.
[00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:21.364]  Who knows what's true?
[00:58:21.364 --> 00:58:24.165]  I mean, this woman was breaking down and crying.
[00:58:24.165 --> 00:58:35.449]  I mean, I really kind of feel sorry for some of the locals in the community, but this is an example of how the feds or private corporations or anybody can just come into rural areas in America and push people around and take advantage of them.
[00:58:35.449 --> 00:58:35.949]  Absolutely.
[00:58:35.949 --> 00:58:36.929]  We'll be back after this.
[00:58:36.929 --> 00:58:37.970]  It's the Alex Jones Show.

[00:58:50.392 --> 00:58:54.635]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.635 --> 00:58:56.636]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.636 --> 00:59:05.161]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.161 --> 00:59:10.705]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.705 --> 00:59:12.326]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.566 --> 00:59:19.068]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.068 --> 00:59:30.130]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:30.891]  That's right.
[00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:33.471]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[00:59:36.992 --> 00:59:40.113]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network Big Brother
[01:00:06.505 --> 01:00:08.268]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.268 --> 01:00:10.030]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:11.612]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.612 --> 01:00:12.533]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.533 --> 01:00:17.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.426]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.643 --> 01:00:38.378]  Alex Jones with boots on the ground in Hardin, Montana as we speak, breaking this very important story of foreign military mercenaries taking over a privatized prison system in an economically destitute area.
[01:00:38.378 --> 01:00:38.559]  Alex?
[01:00:40.643 --> 01:00:46.465]  Jason Burmess, absolutely, and every five minutes or so new people roll into here.
[01:00:46.465 --> 01:00:51.227]  People from Belling, people from Hardin, people from surrounding communities wanting to know what's going on here.
[01:00:51.227 --> 01:01:06.953]  I mean, how could you make up a story this bizarre where some foreign multi-time felon from Serbia with bizarre mercenaries in tow comes in and leases a facility that's being looked at as a detention center for Guantanamo Bay people
[01:01:07.785 --> 01:01:14.828]  Takes it over in the middle of nowhere, brings in their own vehicles with police decals on the sides.
[01:01:14.828 --> 01:01:23.292]  A lot of people in the local town and the establishment think they're part of the power structure, are defending it, even as it comes out that he's a serious criminal.
[01:01:23.292 --> 01:01:29.135]  But the average locals, almost unanimously, when you talk to just the common folks, they are very upset about this.
[01:01:29.135 --> 01:01:30.996]  They're very angry, and they're not stupid.
[01:01:30.996 --> 01:01:35.698]  They keep saying, how are they going to fund this gigantic facility?
[01:01:36.797 --> 01:01:39.918]  I mean, in the town, there's 3,500 people.
[01:01:39.918 --> 01:01:43.719]  In the county, there's only a few thousand more people in the surrounding area.
[01:01:43.719 --> 01:01:49.041]  I mean, this is extremely ultra-rural, one of the most thinly populated areas in the country.
[01:01:49.041 --> 01:01:53.482]  How are they going to fill 450 beds to start with?
[01:01:53.482 --> 01:01:58.344]  And they say that they want, in the news, at least a thousand more beds.
[01:01:58.344 --> 01:02:01.065]  They want another facility built onto this.
[01:02:01.065 --> 01:02:05.186]  This is a very large... So, so, so, are they going to put a quarter?
[01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:08.452]  Or 10% of the town in the jail?
[01:02:08.452 --> 01:02:12.775]  I mean, I guess in Texas we have over 10% of the public has warrants out for their arrest.
[01:02:12.775 --> 01:02:18.360]  And that's the issue is, this was built as an economic development zone.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.081]  That's how sick this has gotten.
[01:02:20.081 --> 01:02:21.222]  That's what our economy is.
[01:02:21.222 --> 01:02:25.946]  Face scanning cameras, checkpoints, police, barbed wire, most of the big new
[01:02:28.041 --> 01:02:28.942]  We're good to go.
[01:02:46.074 --> 01:02:51.080]  Uh, we know that Blackwater's been used, er, raiding marijuana dispensaries in Southern California.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.825]  Uh, we know that other mercenary groups are now being used here in the United States.
[01:02:54.825 --> 01:03:03.295]  And look at Blackwater, with the federal filings and now being indicted for murder and, and, and, and raping children and all this other crazy stuff.
[01:03:03.955 --> 01:03:23.193]  It just goes on and on and on as criminal corporations and corrupt groups and unsavory organizations, all these different merc groups, summer unsavory, summer secretive, summer criminal, it's all just a mass, a cancerous mass just coming in and metastasizing and feeding on our society and our economy.
[01:03:23.753 --> 01:03:25.674]  I know you have Peter L. Scott coming up later.
[01:03:25.674 --> 01:03:27.115]  I also know you have Bob Chapman.
[01:03:27.115 --> 01:03:30.256]  I know you have a lot of other news on the flu situation and calls.
[01:03:30.256 --> 01:03:31.877]  I want to let you get to that, Jason.
[01:03:31.877 --> 01:03:45.003]  For the last 15-20 minutes of the show today, I will call in and give you a full report after we've talked to some of the other people in the local city and county government from here in Hardin, Montana.
[01:03:45.003 --> 01:03:48.485]  But we had to come to this when we had police vehicles
[01:03:49.105 --> 01:04:09.967]  Driving around with the Serbian crest saying hardened police and two rivers said oh yes This is our wish list to have them be the police and this guy has now been photographed at City Council in a police uniform at meetings where they were saying they want to become the new police force and they've now moved the City Council
[01:04:10.856 --> 01:04:12.157]  The Mayor and others.
[01:04:12.157 --> 01:04:13.298]  This is in local news.
[01:04:13.298 --> 01:04:17.281]  We've now gone back over news articles from the local paper over the last six months.
[01:04:17.281 --> 01:04:28.309]  And they are moving in the next few weeks to get rid of the Bighorn Sheriff's Department as their police force here in the city limits of Hardin.
[01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:31.791]  And clearly in the wings, they have the vehicles here with Hardin Police.
[01:04:31.791 --> 01:04:32.492]  They were going to have
[01:04:33.092 --> 01:04:44.815]  The detention center run by a convicted felon con artist, uh, out literally feeding on the public and jailing locals, uh, and putting them in this facility housed right next door to a bunch of mercenaries.
[01:04:44.815 --> 01:04:46.436]  I mean, it doesn't get any more bizarre than that.
[01:04:46.436 --> 01:04:49.877]  This was a slave center that turned a local town into a slave grid.
[01:04:50.473 --> 01:04:50.973]  Absolutely.
[01:04:50.973 --> 01:04:55.635]  Truth is stranger than fiction, and this is the next progression in the Prison Planet.
[01:04:55.635 --> 01:04:56.755]  We'll be back after this.
[01:04:56.755 --> 01:04:57.776]  It's the Alex Jones Show.

[01:05:00.357 --> 01:05:05.659]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.659 --> 01:05:10.180]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.461]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.461 --> 01:05:14.082]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.082 --> 01:05:15.102]  There is a solution.

[01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:11.804]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:11.804 --> 01:06:17.408]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:17.688 --> 01:06:22.471]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.471 --> 01:06:26.073]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:06:26.073 --> 01:06:30.896]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:30.896 --> 01:06:37.460]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.421]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:06:39.901 --> 01:06:43.102]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:06:43.102 --> 01:06:47.604]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:49.824]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:06:49.824 --> 01:06:50.125]  877-327-0365.
[01:06:50.125 --> 01:06:50.825]  Don't wait, call today!
[01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:04.122]  Remain in your houses.
[01:07:04.122 --> 01:07:09.889]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[01:07:09.889 --> 01:07:11.251]  Will they do it?
[01:07:11.251 --> 01:07:13.875]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[01:07:13.875 --> 01:07:19.823]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[01:07:20.323 --> 01:07:22.504]  Think it can't happen here?
[01:07:22.504 --> 01:07:26.805]  Executive Order 10-9-90 locks down all highways.
[01:07:26.805 --> 01:07:31.667]  Executive Order 10-9-95 seizes control of all media outlets.
[01:07:31.667 --> 01:07:36.588]  Executive Order 10-9-98 controls all farms and food supplies.
[01:07:36.588 --> 01:07:41.410]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:50.756]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:07:50.756 --> 01:07:53.258]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:07:53.258 --> 01:07:56.320]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.242]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[01:08:02.509 --> 01:08:09.130]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:13.371]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.371 --> 01:08:18.372]  If you've just joined us, you have missed some breaking news.
[01:08:18.372 --> 01:08:29.074]  This Hilton character with 17 plus aliases, multiple felony convictions, over a million dollars lost in civil suits that have still not been paid off, this guy
[01:08:30.967 --> 01:08:32.867]  Has an open war in Wyoming.
[01:08:32.867 --> 01:08:33.688]  It's unbelievable.
[01:08:33.688 --> 01:08:36.428]  If you've missed any of this, you need to get the podcast.
[01:08:36.428 --> 01:08:38.169]  You need to listen to the rebroadcast.
[01:08:38.169 --> 01:08:43.430]  You need to call your friends and family and let them know that this is going on in this country.
[01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:45.510]  We're going to open up the phone lines.
[01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:50.111]  Hopefully we're going to be talking about this hardened Montana issue or possibly the flu.
[01:08:50.111 --> 01:08:53.152]  And we've got some big news on the flu coming up.
[01:08:53.152 --> 01:08:54.232]  But I want to remind people.
[01:08:55.177 --> 01:09:04.202]  That Fall of the Republic drops October 21st and if you pre-order you will be the first to get this video and high quality DVD.
[01:09:04.202 --> 01:09:10.426]  Fall of the Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the United States economy by design.
[01:09:10.826 --> 01:09:17.131]  Leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency.
[01:09:17.131 --> 01:09:21.955]  President Obama has brazenly violated Article 2, Section 9 of the U.S.
[01:09:21.955 --> 01:09:30.042]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[01:09:30.042 --> 01:09:32.324]  President to chair the world body.
[01:09:32.324 --> 01:09:33.785]  Total conflict of interest.
[01:09:33.785 --> 01:09:34.446]  Total treason.
[01:09:35.026 --> 01:09:43.091]  A scientific dictatorship is in its final stages of completion and laws protecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide.
[01:09:43.091 --> 01:09:47.154]  An iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.
[01:09:47.154 --> 01:10:03.565]  And that reminds me, I gave these guys a video yesterday that basically showed you how the new Google Earth was going to work and how you would be able to, in real time, live time, see CCTV camera footage of what's going on on the location that you zoom into.
[01:10:03.565 --> 01:10:04.726]  We'll get to that story later.
[01:10:06.347 --> 01:10:18.073]  A worldwide regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite is implementing a planetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human activity and establish a system of neo-feudal slavery.
[01:10:18.073 --> 01:10:21.894]  The image makers have carefully packaged Obama as the world's savior.
[01:10:21.894 --> 01:10:28.638]  He is the Trojan horse manufactured to pacify the people just long enough for the globalists to complete their master plan.
[01:10:29.198 --> 01:10:33.999]  This film reveals the architecture of the New World Order and what the power elite have in store for humanity.
[01:10:33.999 --> 01:10:42.721]  More importantly, it communicates how we the people can retake control of our government, turn the criminal tide, and bring the tyrants to justice.
[01:10:42.721 --> 01:10:45.742]  Call the Republic the Presidency of Barack Obama.
[01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:47.202]  Pre-order it today.
[01:10:47.202 --> 01:10:49.683]  It drops October 21st.
[01:10:49.683 --> 01:10:51.403]  Less than three weeks away, folks.
[01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:54.623]  Alright, I wanted to get into some flu news.
[01:10:54.623 --> 01:11:05.608]  And, you know, one of the stories we've been covering for the past two to three weeks was how Walgreens was heavily promoting the influenza shot and how you could get that shot by going into the store.
[01:11:05.608 --> 01:11:06.589]  They'll administer it.
[01:11:06.589 --> 01:11:09.030]  They'll not only give it to you, they'll stick you with a needle.
[01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:11.511]  It's the greatest thing ever!
[01:11:11.511 --> 01:11:19.274]  And it should become no shock that due to that, and due to the fear-mongering and the hype surrounding the swine flu and the regular flu,
[01:11:21.912 --> 01:11:24.497]  That Walgreens is up 5.3%.
[01:11:24.497 --> 01:11:27.623]  Well, the jobless rate goes up to an admitted now 9.8%.
[01:11:27.623 --> 01:11:29.406]  It's well over 10%.
[01:11:29.406 --> 01:11:33.934]  We're going to be getting into that with Bob Chapman in about 20 minutes when he joins us.
[01:11:36.109 --> 01:11:41.914]  They're making, hand over fist, big bucks by selling you the flu vaccination.
[01:11:41.914 --> 01:11:58.266]  I remember the Mayo Clinic did a study about two to three months ago where they admitted if you take the flu vaccine, you are actually two to three times more likely, two to three more times more likely to get the flu.
[01:11:58.266 --> 01:11:59.867]  Unbelievable.
[01:11:59.867 --> 01:12:01.609]  Inconscionable.
[01:12:01.609 --> 01:12:02.349]  Unheard of.
[01:12:02.349 --> 01:12:03.110]  Let's read the story.
[01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.850]  This is out of Reuters.
[01:12:04.995 --> 01:12:15.285]  In-store flu vaccinations helped Walgreens company, the largest US drugstore chain, post a 5.3% jump in September sales as its stores opened at least a year.
[01:12:15.285 --> 01:12:23.653]  Some store sales of general merchandise, which have suffered as consumers curb non-essential spending, also climbed for the first time since May.
[01:12:23.653 --> 01:12:30.059]  So by Walgreens pimping out the regular flu vaccination, they're making some scratch.
[01:12:31.907 --> 01:12:40.515]  And let's not forget, the H1N1 vaccine, the people that don't like needles, they're gonna try to offer you a nasal spray.
[01:12:40.515 --> 01:12:42.536]  I implore you out there, people.
[01:12:42.536 --> 01:12:43.978]  I implore you.
[01:12:43.978 --> 01:12:46.320]  Refuse the shot at all costs.
[01:12:47.162 --> 01:13:09.171]  We read a story out of Abilene, Texas yesterday, where they admitted that it wasn't really mandatory, and that they had been curbing people who didn't want to take the shot, and then they said, well, you know, there are a couple of waiver forms, but the waiver forms will only go so far, and if your child has 10 unexcused absences, they're going to become truant, and we all know what happens in this country if your child's truant.
[01:13:09.171 --> 01:13:11.592]  Here comes CPS!
[01:13:11.592 --> 01:13:12.132]  Meanwhile,
[01:13:13.726 --> 01:13:24.868]  They give Verichip Corporation an exclusive license to patent used in-virus triage detective systems for the H1N1 virus, and then their stock jumps up.
[01:13:26.024 --> 01:13:37.631]  They make it mandatory for all military personnel, all military personnel, including National Guard and people who work for the Defense Department, to take the H1N1 vaccine.
[01:13:37.631 --> 01:13:39.713]  And remember, it's not really H1N1.
[01:13:39.713 --> 01:13:46.977]  It's H5N1, it's H1N1, and it's human flu virus, all mixed together.
[01:13:46.977 --> 01:13:48.698]  See, that's in the backdrop.
[01:13:48.698 --> 01:13:52.241]  They've really downplayed that aspect of it.
[01:13:52.241 --> 01:13:54.162]  And they always try to target the poor.
[01:13:55.219 --> 01:14:13.255]  And Catherine Sebelius, who's the head of Health and Human Services in this country, also a Bilderberg attendee the last two years running, has openly stated that she plans to vaccinate 11 million illegal aliens as well!
[01:14:13.255 --> 01:14:16.058]  That should tell you the mentality of this country.
[01:14:16.058 --> 01:14:20.482]  They're going to vaccinate 11 million illegal aliens, but they're not going to deport them.
[01:14:21.121 --> 01:14:25.062]  You know, they're gonna say, oh yeah, you're not in this country legally, take the shot.
[01:14:25.062 --> 01:14:30.324]  Because they always go after the poorest, the people who are in the least control.
[01:14:30.324 --> 01:14:33.665]  The people who are willing to bow down to the government.
[01:14:33.665 --> 01:14:35.045]  What is this?
[01:14:35.045 --> 01:14:38.126]  This is not America, folks.
[01:14:38.126 --> 01:14:39.627]  This is not America.
[01:14:39.627 --> 01:14:44.308]  This is like something out of a combination of Soviet, Russia, and Communist China.
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:46.780]  We're good to go.
[01:15:05.365 --> 01:15:18.436]  The only people that I know of that are standing up for their rights and saying no to this formaldehyde, squalene, mercury-based vaccination are the Albany health workers.
[01:15:18.436 --> 01:15:22.519]  They're the ones that are out in front of the city capitol saying no!
[01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:26.622]  Let me just read you the first paragraph of this article.
[01:15:28.376 --> 01:15:32.117]  This is out of the Troy record, and Troy is right outside of Albany.
[01:15:32.117 --> 01:15:34.238]  Again, the local media will report on this.
[01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:36.738]  You're not seeing it on Fox News.
[01:15:36.738 --> 01:15:40.419]  You're not seeing it on CNN.
[01:15:40.419 --> 01:15:48.822]  Formaldehyde, mercury, and squalene may sound like ingredients in some kind of toxic chemistry experiment, and that's what this is.
[01:15:49.861 --> 01:15:57.825]  But these are actually what can be found in the H1N1 flu vaccine, which should be made available to the public next week.
[01:15:57.825 --> 01:16:10.352]  And it is partially because of the presence of these toxins that nearly 500 people rallied at the Capitol Tuesday against the State Department of Health, mandating that health care workers should be vaccinated for the swine flu by the end of November.
[01:16:10.352 --> 01:16:15.695]  If they don't comply, these medical professionals could lose their jobs.
[01:16:16.789 --> 01:16:20.355]  So they're going after your jobs, the way you make your living.
[01:16:20.355 --> 01:16:23.981]  They're going after your children.
[01:16:23.981 --> 01:16:27.647]  How sick and disturbing is this?
[01:16:27.647 --> 01:16:29.010]  For what?
[01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:29.951]  The piggy flu?
[01:16:31.803 --> 01:16:45.891]  And remember, they preemptively put out an Associated Press and Reuters press release that says, oh yeah, a lot of people are going to die, a lot of people are going to get sick, but that's normal, and it's not because of the vaccination.
[01:16:45.891 --> 01:16:48.493]  And then we have this young girl who took the Gardasil shot.
[01:16:49.093 --> 01:16:50.094]  Against HPV?
[01:16:50.094 --> 01:16:51.755]  She dies two hours later!
[01:16:51.755 --> 01:16:52.896]  Two hours later!
[01:16:52.896 --> 01:17:01.862]  The mainstream in the UK immediately jumps on the story, says vaccination death, this girl died from the vaccine, and then American media, boom, let's spin it!
[01:17:01.862 --> 01:17:02.883]  It can't be that, U.S.
[01:17:02.883 --> 01:17:04.945]  News & World Report.
[01:17:04.945 --> 01:17:07.386]  Two days later, oh, she died of a tumor!
[01:17:07.386 --> 01:17:08.107]  She had a tumor!
[01:17:09.343 --> 01:17:10.904]  Folks, this girl was healthy.
[01:17:10.904 --> 01:17:11.945]  She was a 14-year-old girl.
[01:17:11.945 --> 01:17:17.469]  Even if she had the tumor, the tumor didn't kill her two hours after she took the vaccine.
[01:17:17.469 --> 01:17:18.509]  Let's be real.
[01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:22.412]  That's not how it works.
[01:17:22.412 --> 01:17:27.415]  And if you believe that, I got about five bridges to sell you at a great price.
[01:17:27.415 --> 01:17:31.598]  You can contact me over at my Facebook and my MySpace, and I'll give you a real good deal.
[01:17:31.598 --> 01:17:33.780]  Just make the checks out to Jason Vermas.
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:35.181]  That's the kind of suckers we are.
[01:17:38.413 --> 01:17:39.353]  I want to read this.
[01:17:39.353 --> 01:17:43.054]  Health officials seek to vaccinate illegal immigrants against swine flu.
[01:17:43.054 --> 01:17:58.218]  With swine flu vaccination set to begin in October, public health officials are mobilizing to ensure that the nation's estimated 11 million plus, and that's a low-ball number, it's probably more around 30 million, 11 million plus illegal immigrants are vaccinated to protect themselves and the public.
[01:17:58.218 --> 01:18:06.421]  Unlike the debate over whether illegal immigrants should get federal health care, there is little dispute they should be included in the nation's voluntary vaccination program.
[01:18:06.421 --> 01:18:07.181]  Voluntary?
[01:18:07.981 --> 01:18:11.163]  I just read to you it was mandatory!
[01:18:11.163 --> 01:18:17.326]  It's semantics, it's wordplay, it's Orwell all over again.
[01:18:17.326 --> 01:18:29.473]  It's again, it's a hybrid of the dumbing down through medication, through the foods, through the vaccinations that you see in Brave New World, and the Orwellian doublespeak that you saw in 1984.
[01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:47.880]  We believe it's important that all people are vaccinated regardless of immigration status if there's a pressing public health concern, said John Fair, a legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies, which opposes taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants and wants to reduce immigration.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:58.867]  Leaving 10 to 12 million immigrants unvaccinated against swine flu, also known as H1N1, would increase the health risk for everyone and make it much harder to control the epidemic.
[01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:00.248]  And remember, they put us under level 6!
[01:19:02.142 --> 01:19:06.405]  They put us under level 6 months and months and months ago!
[01:19:06.405 --> 01:19:19.976]  And then somehow in Spain, even though level 6 was the highest, it could possibly be you went to the CDC's own website and you went to their checklist for pandemic flu viruses and it said it basically could quarantine you.
[01:19:19.976 --> 01:19:22.698]  Not basically, it could quarantine you.
[01:19:22.698 --> 01:19:25.440]  It could allow the use of off-site drugs.
[01:19:26.241 --> 01:19:29.523]  With your inability to sue afterwards?
[01:19:29.523 --> 01:19:31.485]  No repercussions for these people.
[01:19:31.485 --> 01:19:33.066]  Total martial law in America.
[01:19:33.066 --> 01:19:37.489]  In Spain, they upped the game to 6.2.
[01:19:37.489 --> 01:19:42.352]  But you can't go higher than WHO level 6.
[01:19:42.352 --> 01:19:46.475]  So again, it's about putting you in fear, making you want to take the shot.
[01:19:46.475 --> 01:19:49.157]  We'll be back after this with your calls at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:49.157 --> 01:19:52.439]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in PrisonPlanet.tv and FoeWars.com.
[01:20:01.033 --> 01:20:07.735]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:20:07.735 --> 01:20:09.416]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:20:09.416 --> 01:20:13.997]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:20:13.997 --> 01:20:21.660]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.121]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[01:20:24.301 --> 01:20:26.522]  And has no dangerous second hand smoke.

[01:20:53.968 --> 01:20:54.308]  Good day.
[01:20:54.308 --> 01:20:55.348]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:20:55.348 --> 01:20:55.848]  October 2nd, 2009.
[01:20:55.848 --> 01:20:57.169]  Gold opened this morning at $9.9730.
[01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:58.829]  A one ounce gold coin to be purchased for $1,025.51.
[01:20:58.829 --> 01:21:01.429]  $5.1275 for the half ounce or $2.5638 for a quarter ounce.
[01:21:01.429 --> 01:21:01.689]  That's $1,025.51.
[01:21:01.689 --> 01:21:02.010]  $5.1275 or $2.5638.
[01:21:20.996 --> 01:21:34.605]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:21:34.605 --> 01:21:35.625]  Is this capitalism?
[01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:43.451]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:21:43.451 --> 01:21:44.551]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:44.551 --> 01:21:48.674]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:21:48.894 --> 01:21:49.995]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:49.995 --> 01:21:50.955]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:21:50.955 --> 01:21:51.115]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:51.355]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:51.355 --> 01:21:54.476]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:14.952]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:22:14.952 --> 01:22:21.555]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:21.555 --> 01:22:23.515]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:23.515 --> 01:22:26.037]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:26.037 --> 01:22:36.981]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.261]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:39.261 --> 01:22:41.122]  It's about a one world government.
[01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:48.047]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:48.047 --> 01:22:56.312]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:56.312 --> 01:22:57.873]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.873 --> 01:22:59.054]  The people strike back.
[01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:07.983]  If you're looking for a company that will meet and exceed your water purification needs, you need to visit PureWaterFreedom.com.

[01:23:46.342 --> 01:23:46.682]  That's 1-866-757-7644.
[01:23:46.682 --> 01:23:47.802]  Or visit purewaterfreedom.com.
[01:23:47.802 --> 01:23:48.562]  Purewaterfreedom.com.
[01:23:48.562 --> 01:23:50.163]  The best filtered water in the world.
[01:23:50.163 --> 01:23:51.723]  I wish a buck was still silver
[01:24:27.849 --> 01:24:29.330]  Alright folks, we are live.
[01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:30.551]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:30.551 --> 01:24:37.976]  Alex in Hardin, Montana at this foreign military training facility slash privatized prison.
[01:24:39.136 --> 01:24:43.137]  Run by an admitted criminal with 17 plus aliases.
[01:24:43.137 --> 01:24:47.298]  With over a million dollars in debt due to civil cases he has lost.
[01:24:47.298 --> 01:24:53.200]  A man who spent time in the California Correctional Facility.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.780]  You can't make this stuff up and he's the leader.
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:56.961]  He's the one in charge.
[01:24:56.961 --> 01:25:03.962]  He's the guy wearing a very deceptive American police force badge at city council meetings.
[01:25:03.962 --> 01:25:05.363]  He's not American.
[01:25:05.363 --> 01:25:06.503]  It's not a police force.
[01:25:07.742 --> 01:25:11.424]  Alright, I promised I'd take your call so let's jump to Brian in Montreal.
[01:25:11.424 --> 01:25:12.885]  Brian, you're online.
[01:25:12.885 --> 01:25:14.446]  Hi Jason, how's it going?
[01:25:14.446 --> 01:25:15.386]  Alright.
[01:25:15.386 --> 01:25:22.990]  I wanted to clarify something about the little announcement they made about the medical study up here in Canada because it certainly was a mind trick.
[01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:30.814]  I've heard some people state on the show that they thought just taking the regular shot would put you at risk.
[01:25:30.814 --> 01:25:36.037]  That isn't a lie because I've already heard from a doctor here in Montreal in the springtime when the
[01:25:36.445 --> 01:26:03.526]  flu first came out saying that they would put it in the fall shot that's not a surprise but what people have to understand is up here in Canada most of the people are fooled most of the time and last fall and this spring they had their seasonal regular flu shot and up here in Canada us info warriors have been doing a good job on sites like 12-160 and 9-11 Sherbrooke to inform the people and so there was a big resistance even though
[01:26:03.968 --> 01:26:08.091]  In Canwest, they published it, 95% said they would be willing.
[01:26:08.091 --> 01:26:12.014]  A lot of us questioned who they were asking, because that was a complete lie.
[01:26:12.014 --> 01:26:20.280]  At the same time, they had a poll on CBC site, and they were saying that only like 60% of people were not going to take the shot.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.142]  So they knew that the public was not interested.
[01:26:23.142 --> 01:26:33.629]  So what they were trying to do was scare the public by saying, if you've received your seasonal flu shot in the spring of this year, or in the fall of last year, you would be more likely
[01:26:34.332 --> 01:26:35.093]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:26:45.703 --> 01:26:48.205]  I'm three times, I'm five times as likely.
[01:26:48.205 --> 01:26:50.887]  I better go get this new H1N1 virus.
[01:26:50.887 --> 01:27:00.495]  Well, that actually is a separate study from the one that I mentioned earlier, which was out of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, but they use the same propaganda, and I thank you for the call.
[01:27:00.495 --> 01:27:02.957]  You know, they're always trying to put these people into fear.
[01:27:02.957 --> 01:27:03.818]  Let me give you an example.
[01:27:03.818 --> 01:27:08.781]  Remember, the mainstream media is the psychological warfare arm
[01:27:09.662 --> 01:27:10.943]  Of the establishment.
[01:27:10.943 --> 01:27:12.244]  Let me read this one out of Fox News.
[01:27:12.244 --> 01:27:18.610]  Again, trying to scare pregnant women into injecting themselves with formaldehyde, squalene, and mercury.
[01:27:18.610 --> 01:27:23.314]  Nearly one in three pregnant women who've contracted H1N1 have died in the U.S.
[01:27:23.314 --> 01:27:25.876]  That's the headline out of Fox News.
[01:27:25.876 --> 01:27:31.100]  A stark reminder about how deadly the new H1N1 virus can be during the news briefing Tuesday.
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:31.320]  U.S.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:36.285]  health officials said the virus has hit pregnant women especially hard.
[01:27:36.285 --> 01:27:37.265]  And remember, we had the
[01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:41.088]  The New York Times with a similar article earlier in the week.
[01:27:41.088 --> 01:27:45.410]  Pregnancy is no time to refuse the flu shot!
[01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:50.213]  So of course they're going to use fear to try to corral people into taking the poison.
[01:27:50.213 --> 01:27:51.993]  Let's go to Wilson in Florida.
[01:27:51.993 --> 01:27:54.115]  Wilson, you're online.
[01:27:54.115 --> 01:27:55.775]  Good afternoon, Jason Bermudez.
[01:27:55.775 --> 01:27:57.296]  It's a pleasure speaking to you.
[01:27:57.296 --> 01:27:57.877]  Thank you.
[01:27:57.877 --> 01:28:01.999]  I just wanted to start off by asking you, do you have a number to your radio show?
[01:28:01.999 --> 01:28:06.001]  Because I call the GCN Network and I'm constantly hearing the Alex Jones on replay.
[01:28:07.364 --> 01:28:10.546]  I don't have access to a computer, so is there a number I can call?
[01:28:10.546 --> 01:28:17.368]  Sure, let me just give that out to people, and that's the direct line here, and I thank you for the call, Wilson.
[01:28:17.368 --> 01:28:20.590]  888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:28.473]  That'll get you here in studio now for Alex Jones, and that'll get you on my Sunday show, 6 to 9 Central.
[01:28:28.473 --> 01:28:29.133]  Thank you for the call.
[01:28:29.133 --> 01:28:30.934]  Let's go to Aaron in Kentucky.
[01:28:30.934 --> 01:28:32.695]  Aaron, you're on the line.
[01:28:32.695 --> 01:28:35.736]  Hey, so I've got like two bits of information I thought I'd share.
[01:28:36.912 --> 01:28:51.243]  The first is I went to the Kentucky Department of Homeland Security website and they basically got this program called Eyes and Ears Kentucky where basically you're encouraged to call an anonymous tip line and basically report any suspicious activity.
[01:28:51.243 --> 01:28:58.068]  And they had, I guess, like reading a press release, they had a booth set up like at the State Fair in Louisville over the last like month.
[01:28:58.359 --> 01:29:00.280]  Well, Al Qaeda is everywhere, sir.
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:02.561]  We need to be tattling on our neighbors.
[01:29:02.561 --> 01:29:05.262]  We need to be tattling on their garbage activities.
[01:29:05.262 --> 01:29:07.903]  We need to be tattling on their carbon emissions.
[01:29:07.903 --> 01:29:11.224]  We need to be tattling on everything and anything.
[01:29:11.224 --> 01:29:15.066]  I mean, how else are we going to stay safe?
[01:29:15.066 --> 01:29:22.149]  Another thing, I just got a magazine here in the mail, New Scientist Magazine, and the name of the article is called Enough of Us Now.
[01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:24.270]  The people that wrote the article were Paul and Ann Ehrlich.
[01:29:25.958 --> 01:29:26.479]  Hold over.
[01:29:26.479 --> 01:29:27.640]  Hold over.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:29.941]  I'm going to go to you into the next segment in the beginning.
[01:29:29.941 --> 01:29:32.183]  We have Bob Chapman coming up.
[01:29:32.183 --> 01:29:33.885]  But yeah, these articles are everywhere.
[01:29:33.885 --> 01:29:40.089]  I mean, out of Salon.com, they're saying that don't have babies and you'll curb global warming.
[01:29:40.089 --> 01:29:45.714]  Their word population sustainability is a eugenics term for one child policy.
[01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:47.035]  That's what the deal is.
[01:29:47.035 --> 01:29:47.896]  They don't like you.
[01:29:47.896 --> 01:29:48.676]  They don't love you.
[01:29:48.676 --> 01:29:49.717]  They're not here to protect you.
[01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:51.498]  It's the Alex Jones Show back after this.
[01:29:51.498 --> 01:29:52.899]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.899 --> 01:29:54.401]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.411 --> 01:29:58.102]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.206 --> 01:30:04.207]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.207 --> 01:30:09.529]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.529 --> 01:30:11.589]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.589 --> 01:30:16.591]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.591 --> 01:30:17.771]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.771 --> 01:30:18.892]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.892 --> 01:30:20.772]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.772 --> 01:30:21.852]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.852 --> 01:30:24.053]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.053 --> 01:30:25.394]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.394 --> 01:30:26.694]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.914 --> 01:30:32.181]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.181 --> 01:30:35.766]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.766 --> 01:30:39.591]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.591 --> 01:30:40.813]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.813 --> 01:30:41.714]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.714 --> 01:30:42.835]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.835 --> 01:30:43.757]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.757 --> 01:30:44.558]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.838 --> 01:30:47.881]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.881 --> 01:30:49.663]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.663 --> 01:30:50.584]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:05.515]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.515 --> 01:31:10.041]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.041 --> 01:31:12.324]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.324 --> 01:31:13.946]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:13.946 --> 01:31:14.968]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.208 --> 01:31:23.636]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:23.636 --> 01:31:31.083]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:31:31.083 --> 01:31:36.748]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:31:37.108 --> 01:31:43.131]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:43.131 --> 01:31:47.293]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:31:47.293 --> 01:31:54.737]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[01:31:54.737 --> 01:31:58.039]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.341]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:32:03.341 --> 01:32:09.225]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:32:09.225 --> 01:32:18.210]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[01:32:18.210 --> 01:32:21.072]  Rely on OxySilver instead.
[01:32:21.072 --> 01:32:26.915]  OxySilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[01:32:26.915 --> 01:32:29.557]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol.
[01:32:30.178 --> 01:32:31.869]  Far safer than colloidal silvers!
[01:32:32.549 --> 01:32:37.452]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[01:32:37.452 --> 01:32:41.195]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[01:32:41.195 --> 01:32:43.417]  So get it while you still can.

[01:34:32.169 --> 01:34:34.131]  I'm glad to be back this Friday.
[01:34:34.131 --> 01:34:37.834]  And I saw you on tape this morning and I thought you did a terrific job.
[01:34:54.984 --> 01:34:56.725]  Well, thank you so much.
[01:34:56.725 --> 01:35:00.148]  You know, let's just get into the financial news.
[01:35:00.148 --> 01:35:08.593]  The Associated Press, Reuters, all the major news agencies are now admitting to a 9.8% unemployment rate.
[01:35:08.593 --> 01:35:14.377]  We know the number is actually higher, but for them to admit it's up around 10% is unprecedented.
[01:35:14.377 --> 01:35:15.978]  And I've got headlines in front of me.
[01:35:25.384 --> 01:35:27.245]  Well, it's extortion, it's a threat.
[01:35:27.245 --> 01:35:31.087]  They're trying to tell you if you do touch our Federal Reserve, we'll destroy the economy.
[01:35:31.087 --> 01:35:36.909]  And what they don't understand, or they don't want to go there, is that they are the richest people in the world.
[01:35:53.832 --> 01:35:58.493]  And they get the most to lose, including their lives, probably.
[01:35:58.493 --> 01:36:04.115]  You know, the American people and the people of the world are not dumb to what they're doing.
[01:36:04.115 --> 01:36:13.617]  You know, we have all these alternative radio programs such as Alex Jones and many others, and we have some publications that discuss these kind of things.
[01:36:13.617 --> 01:36:14.277]  Not many.
[01:36:14.277 --> 01:36:15.937]  I wish there were more.
[01:36:15.937 --> 01:36:17.878]  And the world knows what they're doing.
[01:36:18.724 --> 01:36:32.997]  And what their plan is now, and all this propaganda that you just talked about coming through the U.N., the G20, they're doing away with G7 and G8, they're moving toward a world currency which will be out of the IMF.
[01:36:32.997 --> 01:36:37.641]  They're using SDRs, which are Special Drawing Rights Now.
[01:36:37.641 --> 01:36:40.784]  The Japanese and several others are using them.
[01:36:40.784 --> 01:36:45.688]  And they want to phase into a world currency.
[01:36:46.511 --> 01:36:51.456]  And if they don't have any backing in gold, it's just not going to work.
[01:36:51.456 --> 01:36:54.959]  It's just another fiat currency, just like SDRs are.
[01:36:54.959 --> 01:36:56.520]  And so that's where they're headed with this thing.
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:02.406]  Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow morning, but it is going to happen over the next two to three years.
[01:37:02.406 --> 01:37:07.110]  If I had to put a time frame into it, I'd say probably a year and a half to two.
[01:37:07.110 --> 01:37:11.174]  And I think that what they're going to look for is
[01:37:13.072 --> 01:37:26.010]  When the dollar gets on the USDX, which is an index weighted of six other currencies versus a dollar, which is selling at around 77 right now, down from a high of 124, when it gets down
[01:37:30.047 --> 01:37:30.588]  I think?
[01:37:52.996 --> 01:37:58.904]  Uh, one-third of the debt will have to be paid off, and the other two-thirds, uh, will be done away with.
[01:37:58.904 --> 01:38:05.013]  And that's where I think this whole thing is headed, or at least that's the way they want it to head.
[01:38:05.013 --> 01:38:06.535]  And that's what I think is in the future.
[01:38:07.073 --> 01:38:11.497]  Well, there's two points that I want to hit on a little more extensively that you just talked about.
[01:38:11.497 --> 01:38:20.965]  One, the idea that these are the richest people in the world, yet the dumbed-down public believes that Bill Gates is the richest man in the world, followed by Warren Buffett.
[01:38:20.965 --> 01:38:23.768]  And certainly those men are powerful and wealthy.
[01:38:24.008 --> 01:38:28.291]  But they're really just tools of the real establishment, the real elite.
[01:38:28.291 --> 01:38:29.432]  Let's speak to that.
[01:38:29.432 --> 01:38:33.595]  And then on top of that, we're talking SDR units and a global currency.
[01:38:33.595 --> 01:38:47.805]  When they do announce this global currency outside of SDR units, are we going to see this as a hard physical currency or just a fiat traded currency that we won't see an actual bill or coin for?
[01:38:47.805 --> 01:38:51.888]  Well, knowing them and knowing the status of the nation's gold wise,
[01:38:52.472 --> 01:38:54.614]  They sold most of their gold off.
[01:38:54.614 --> 01:38:59.037]  It will be, without backing, it will be another fiat currency.
[01:38:59.037 --> 01:39:01.659]  And I don't think there's any question of that.
[01:39:01.659 --> 01:39:05.401]  And it won't work any better than any of the other ones.
[01:39:05.401 --> 01:39:10.845]  But I think it's going to be accompanied by a very deep depression.
[01:39:10.845 --> 01:39:19.311]  And I think that the turmoil that's going to come from that may upset their plans.
[01:39:19.311 --> 01:39:22.013]  And as you saw in Montana, and you reported,
[01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:23.803]  Uh, with Alex on the air.
[01:39:23.803 --> 01:39:25.164]  That's the tape I saw this morning.
[01:39:25.164 --> 01:39:31.886]  Uh, they are already, and they're responsible for this, putting these criminals into the United States.
[01:39:31.886 --> 01:39:34.867]  They're nothing but mercenary murderers.
[01:39:34.867 --> 01:39:39.629]  And, uh, and they expect to do that all over the country and then use that against the people.
[01:39:40.589 --> 01:40:02.322]  Absolutely, and how shocking is it that, you know, number one, we have somebody with 17 plus aliases, multiple felony convictions, over a million dollars in lawsuits, lost and unpaid, an open warrant in Wyoming, and this is the guy that's going to head up the privatized prison system that was first built in 2007?
[01:40:02.322 --> 01:40:05.944]  This is insanity!
[01:40:05.944 --> 01:40:08.166]  Well, this is the kind of people that they attract.
[01:40:09.322 --> 01:40:13.224]  Because the criminals work very good with criminals.
[01:40:13.224 --> 01:40:25.470]  The people in banking, Wall Street, the power behind all of the Illuminati is the European heads of royal families called the Black Nobility.
[01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:32.554]  They've been in charge of it probably since the 14th century.
[01:40:32.554 --> 01:40:35.375]  They are the ones who hire these types of people.
[01:40:37.063 --> 01:40:39.084]  Once they've done their job, they get rid of them.
[01:40:39.084 --> 01:40:40.946]  They eliminate them.
[01:40:40.946 --> 01:40:49.391]  And so you're going to find a lot of very, very bad people who are going to be in groups like this, including Blackwater.
[01:40:49.391 --> 01:40:52.033]  I mean, they're no lilies of the valley either.
[01:40:52.033 --> 01:40:56.796]  And these are the people that the American military are going to have to take out.
[01:40:58.069 --> 01:41:00.771]  Well I hope it does actually come to that.
[01:41:00.771 --> 01:41:03.032]  But when we expend our U.S.
[01:41:03.032 --> 01:41:15.439]  military forces overseas in illegal conflicts such as Afghanistan and Iraq and now we continue to beat the drums against Iran and now they're ramping up again privatized
[01:41:15.879 --> 01:41:18.762]  Well, there's an answer to that, and that is this.
[01:41:44.355 --> 01:41:53.380]  There's going to be a certain amount of military in the United States, and it's up to the American citizens to go to the military and say, I'm at your service.
[01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:55.221]  I've got my own weapons.
[01:41:55.221 --> 01:41:56.422]  I've been trained.
[01:41:56.422 --> 01:42:00.684]  You just tell me what unit you want me in and give me a uniform.
[01:42:00.684 --> 01:42:02.985]  Well, I hope that the military really wakes up.
[01:42:02.985 --> 01:42:06.027]  There are 80 million veterans in the United States, Jason.
[01:42:06.027 --> 01:42:09.108]  40 million of them have been in combat.
[01:42:09.108 --> 01:42:11.990]  There's 450 million weapons in the United States.
[01:42:12.955 --> 01:42:16.537]  These people are going to get a taught a lesson that they'll never forget.
[01:42:16.537 --> 01:42:23.600]  It's just like the Japanese were asked after the war, why didn't you invade the United States when you had the opportunity?
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:27.601]  And they said, well, everybody's got a gun and they ought to shoot it.
[01:42:27.601 --> 01:42:29.422]  And so, you know, they, they figured that.
[01:42:29.422 --> 01:42:32.043]  And he said, no, we don't want to tangle with that.
[01:42:32.043 --> 01:42:35.045]  Well, the Illuminati wants to tangle with it.
[01:42:35.045 --> 01:42:39.927]  And not only is it going to cost the lives of their mercenaries, it's going to cost them their own lives.
[01:42:40.879 --> 01:42:41.660]  Well, you know, the U.S.
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:44.723]  Supreme Court is set to rule on the Second Amendment coming up.
[01:42:44.723 --> 01:42:46.405]  That's making headlines everywhere.
[01:42:46.405 --> 01:42:50.429]  What do you expect to see out of that?
[01:42:50.429 --> 01:42:56.575]  I think probably that the people who have guns will be able to keep them.
[01:42:58.032 --> 01:43:09.855]  Well, I hope that we are, and I hope that they don't restrict our firearms any further, but we know what their plan is, and we know they like to encroach on our freedoms incrementally, so we'll be keeping a close eye on that.
[01:43:09.855 --> 01:43:18.397]  You know, as the economy continues to falter, as the dollar continues to drop, the last time I checked it against the SDR, or Special Drawing Rights Unit, and for
[01:43:18.897 --> 01:43:31.869]  You know, listeners out there that don't believe that there's already world currency, just type in SDR conversion rate into Google and you'll be able to see the conversion rate of the SDR across the board on all the other currencies out there.
[01:43:31.869 --> 01:43:34.972]  The last time I checked the dollar was somewhere between 60 and 67 cents.
[01:43:36.853 --> 01:43:37.393]  Tell us about that.
[01:43:58.757 --> 01:44:01.159]  It's only a matter of time before gold moves higher.
[01:44:01.159 --> 01:44:01.500]  And where?
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.321]  Anywhere between $1,200 and $1,700 an ounce.
[01:44:03.321 --> 01:44:05.863]  And I think that's eminent.
[01:44:28.524 --> 01:44:30.366]  I don't think that's far away.
[01:44:30.366 --> 01:44:45.218]  And I think if I'm right, let's say it went to $1,600 or $1,700, which is very possible out of the technical formation it's in right now, I would say that there's a chance next year that it could go up to $2,500 to $3,000.
[01:44:45.218 --> 01:44:47.781]  That possibility exists.
[01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:55.167]  So gold is going to be a dynamite investment, a way of protecting your wealth, probably the only way, gold and silver.
[01:44:55.862 --> 01:45:01.284]  Well, tell people how they can make that investment today, and tell them about your newsletter.
[01:45:01.284 --> 01:45:11.009]  Well, International Forecaster is about business, finance, economic, social, political issues all over the world, and we have two issues a week, Wednesdays and Saturdays, by email.
[01:45:11.009 --> 01:45:23.995]  We have a hard copy that goes out, and you can go to our site that addresses theinternationalforecaster.com, theinternationalforecaster.com,
[01:45:24.657 --> 01:45:26.018]  Or you can call toll free 877-479-8178.
[01:45:26.018 --> 01:45:26.939]  That's 877-479-8178.
[01:45:26.939 --> 01:45:31.042]  And you can get a free introductory copy, either hard copy or a email copy.
[01:45:41.986 --> 01:45:42.806]  Excellent.
[01:45:42.806 --> 01:45:51.428]  I want to shift gears and really discuss how the public is being more and more acclimated to military and military-style troops on the street.
[01:45:51.428 --> 01:46:07.272]  You know, I went down and I covered the G20 in Pittsburgh with another couple Info Warriors here in the office, and they locked down the entire downtown area of Pittsburgh with Humvees and National Guard units at every bridge, at every street corner,
[01:46:07.652 --> 01:46:14.116]  And when I went up to them and I was filming them, sometimes with Cindy Sheehan who would approach them and say, you know, my son died for this.
[01:46:14.116 --> 01:46:15.077]  This is disturbing.
[01:46:15.077 --> 01:46:16.357]  This is disgusting.
[01:46:16.357 --> 01:46:23.522]  And I would ask them, you know, what do you have to say to critics that would say that this is a violation of posse comitatus?
[01:46:23.522 --> 01:46:24.963]  And I was talking to, you know,
[01:46:25.703 --> 01:46:40.406]  People who were the freshest in the military, 18-year-old kids, to people who were 40 and 50 years old, sometimes even older than that, who had, you know, all sorts of military experience, and not one of them, not one of them could even tell me what that was, Bob.
[01:46:40.406 --> 01:46:42.446]  Well, it's understandable.
[01:46:42.446 --> 01:46:47.887]  Among the ranks, unfortunately, you don't get a lot of high IQs.
[01:46:47.887 --> 01:46:55.349]  And so these people, you know, they do their job, which is to function as an arm of the United States government and the President.
[01:46:56.102 --> 01:46:59.604]  And they don't know very much about anything.
[01:46:59.604 --> 01:47:06.409]  You will occasionally find people in certain units that do, but more often than not, no.
[01:47:06.409 --> 01:47:18.096]  And the Officer Corp, of course, if you did address them, they might have smiled and said, well, I'd rather not speak about that, but I understand what you're talking about.
[01:47:18.096 --> 01:47:19.677]  And so they just don't know.
[01:47:19.677 --> 01:47:20.858]  But on the other hand, Jason,
[01:47:21.883 --> 01:47:28.525]  We're looking at half the population in America is functionally illiterate.
[01:47:28.525 --> 01:47:37.647]  And so, you know, you can't expect probably more than one-third to even have a wild idea of what you're talking about.
[01:47:37.647 --> 01:47:38.267]  So sad.
[01:47:38.267 --> 01:47:40.048]  It really, really is so sad.
[01:47:40.048 --> 01:47:42.729]  And every country's in the same boat.
[01:47:42.729 --> 01:47:45.789]  They all have functional illiteracy that's terrible.
[01:47:45.789 --> 01:47:47.490]  And I'm talking, you know, ours is
[01:47:49.008 --> 01:47:50.629]  About 51%.
[01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:53.571]  Canada's is 40%.
[01:47:53.571 --> 01:47:56.232]  I mean, Germany's is 40%.
[01:47:56.232 --> 01:48:01.455]  The educational systems in all these countries have degenerated unbelievably.
[01:48:02.947 --> 01:48:11.675]  Well we see it when we talk to people and they can't tell us what the three branches of government are but they can tell us about David Letterman's affair.
[01:48:11.675 --> 01:48:22.325]  We are so mesmerized and hypnotized by the box that talks to us at night in our living rooms that we just don't seem to take an interest in what's going on in the streets of our own country.
[01:48:22.805 --> 01:48:36.673]  And you know, out of the Washington Times today, DHS is deploying LRAD weapons to police departments around the country, again, furthering the militarization of our police force, Bob.
[01:48:36.673 --> 01:48:39.455]  I saw the article and it's there.
[01:48:39.455 --> 01:48:45.238]  I carry it in tomorrow's International Forecaster, which keeps on getting bigger and bigger.
[01:48:45.238 --> 01:48:51.882]  In fact, I carry more links now than I ever did before because there's so much going on out there and I don't want to miss anything.
[01:48:52.304 --> 01:48:57.346]  And I know everybody doesn't have the time to read the whole thing each time it comes, but that's okay.
[01:48:57.346 --> 01:49:03.129]  Go through and pick out what appeals to you and things that you see that you want to know about.
[01:49:03.129 --> 01:49:04.529]  Absolutely.
[01:49:04.529 --> 01:49:09.131]  Alright, so they're now admitting that the jobless rate is at 9.8%.
[01:49:09.131 --> 01:49:13.133]  What do you think the true and real numbers are at this point?
[01:49:13.133 --> 01:49:15.954]  Well, all you have to do is take U6, which is 16.8%, the last figure I got,
[01:49:18.659 --> 01:49:27.308]  And that includes that short-term unemployment you just mentioned and all the people who are no longer getting state checks for unemployment.
[01:49:27.308 --> 01:49:36.457]  All the people who are working part-time, which is almost 10 million people, the average work week now is 33.1 hours at the last time I saw it.
[01:49:37.385 --> 01:49:45.488]  And also we have the discouraged people who have gone out for a year and a half or two to try to get a job and there just isn't any.
[01:49:45.488 --> 01:49:46.769]  And so they've just given up.
[01:49:46.769 --> 01:49:50.910]  So that's what comprises that 16.8% U6.
[01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:54.712]  But there's another thing in there called the birth-death ratio.
[01:49:55.467 --> 01:50:05.789]  And it was something created in 2003, and the government said, we don't have time to go out and check on all those small and medium-sized companies, so we're going to guess at it.
[01:50:05.789 --> 01:50:09.169]  Well, of course, they always guess in their own direction.
[01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:16.431]  And they average about creating about 185,000 jobs a month.
[01:50:16.431 --> 01:50:18.711]  And that's on average.
[01:50:18.711 --> 01:50:23.972]  And so if you take that out of U6, because it's a Mickey Mouse figure,
[01:50:24.699 --> 01:50:25.320]  It's 21% unemployment.
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:26.201]  It's going to get a lot worse.
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:43.081]  Of mindlessness.
[01:50:43.081 --> 01:50:44.682]  Of everything's going to be okay.
[01:50:44.682 --> 01:50:54.066]  Everything's not going to be okay unless we step up to the plate and hold our leaders accountable and try to bring the Constitution and Bill of Rights back from the brink of extinction.
[01:50:54.066 --> 01:50:55.107]  We'll be back after this.
[01:50:55.107 --> 01:50:56.167]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:56.167 --> 01:50:59.409]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in PrisonPlanet.tv and FoeWars.com.
[01:51:01.638 --> 01:51:12.551]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[01:51:12.551 --> 01:51:16.736]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[01:51:16.736 --> 01:51:18.478]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[01:51:18.858 --> 01:51:24.481]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:51:24.481 --> 01:51:34.526]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[01:51:34.526 --> 01:51:41.009]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[01:51:41.009 --> 01:51:44.331]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[01:51:44.331 --> 01:51:46.432]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:51:46.432 --> 01:51:48.293]  It simply needs some help so it has
[01:51:48.493 --> 01:51:49.794]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[01:51:49.794 --> 01:51:52.495]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:52:06.202 --> 01:52:08.524]  9-11 was an inside job!
[01:52:08.524 --> 01:52:09.805]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:52:09.805 --> 01:52:11.486]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[01:52:11.486 --> 01:52:14.328]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:52:14.328 --> 01:52:18.612]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:52:18.612 --> 01:52:27.658]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:52:27.658 --> 01:52:33.843]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:33.843 --> 01:52:34.904]  An inside job?
[01:52:36.326 --> 01:52:38.768]  How dare you?
[01:52:38.768 --> 01:52:43.831]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:43.831 --> 01:52:46.512]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:46.512 --> 01:52:52.956]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:52:58.299 --> 01:53:00.781]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:53:01.553 --> 01:53:06.054]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[01:53:06.054 --> 01:53:10.335]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[01:53:10.335 --> 01:53:21.158]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[01:53:21.158 --> 01:53:31.101]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful immune system-building blocks defending your body against natural and man-made viruses, but they also assist your body in healing itself from life-threatening

[01:54:08.802 --> 01:54:09.542]  Get up, stand up.

[01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:26.630]  We are back live.
[01:54:26.630 --> 01:54:27.831]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:27.831 --> 01:54:29.251]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[01:54:29.251 --> 01:54:32.932]  Peter Dale Scott coming up in the next segment in studio.
[01:54:32.932 --> 01:54:36.133]  We're sitting here with Bob Chapman.
[01:54:36.133 --> 01:54:40.594]  Mr. Chapman, in this final segment, why don't you just wrap up in a nutshell.
[01:54:40.594 --> 01:54:46.916]  What is the most important thing that the American populace needs to know at this point?
[01:54:46.916 --> 01:54:52.838]  I think they know, or should know, and they should get after their Senators and Congressmen and make sure week past HR 1207
[01:54:54.731 --> 01:54:59.634]  And investigate and audit the Fed Reserve and then ultimately get rid of it.
[01:54:59.634 --> 01:55:04.277]  It's the home, the nexus of the Illuminati.
[01:55:04.277 --> 01:55:06.478]  This is the core of which they operate from.
[01:55:06.478 --> 01:55:14.803]  And if we can separate that and get rid of it, we can move towards solving some of the problems.
[01:55:15.595 --> 01:55:20.636]  There's a big move afoot right now to, as I said earlier in the program, to replace the dollar.
[01:55:20.636 --> 01:55:27.738]  There's no question now, people in order to protect themselves have to be in gold and silver related assets.
[01:55:27.738 --> 01:55:29.639]  What's going to happen next year?
[01:55:29.639 --> 01:55:32.820]  Half of the stimulus package has been spent.
[01:55:33.673 --> 01:55:38.317]  And my guess is most of it will be gone into the economy by next June.
[01:55:38.317 --> 01:55:43.022]  So the second half of next year will see the remainder of the effect.
[01:55:43.022 --> 01:55:47.946]  And after that, if they don't inject another $2 trillion stimulus into the economy,
[01:55:48.368 --> 01:55:53.091]  Or banks can increase their lending, which is off about 14% from last year.
[01:55:53.091 --> 01:55:59.475]  If both of them don't do that, the economy's going to spiral into a deflationary mode.
[01:55:59.475 --> 01:56:01.476]  Now, what do I think is going to happen?
[01:56:01.476 --> 01:56:05.559]  I think we're going to get another stimulus package, and I predicted that last January.
[01:56:05.559 --> 01:56:09.901]  Because, you know, I did all the numbers and I said, this isn't going to work for them.
[01:56:09.901 --> 01:56:12.303]  And so, that's where we're headed with these things.
[01:56:12.853 --> 01:56:16.757]  Getting rid of the Federal Reserve is the number one thing we can do.
[01:56:16.757 --> 01:56:26.986]  And besides that, we should get as many people as we can to listen to Alex's show so they'll understand what's going on fresh, right to the moment.
[01:56:26.986 --> 01:56:32.051]  And, of course, my publication, which follows it up a couple of days later.
[01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:35.935]  And for those who can't see that they can read.
[01:56:35.935 --> 01:56:37.877]  Anyway, those are the most important things.
[01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:42.452]  What do you think about this word that the FDIC is asking for a bailout?
[01:56:42.452 --> 01:56:45.614]  I saw that a couple weeks ago and I had just forgotten to cover it.
[01:56:45.614 --> 01:56:49.376]  I mean, what happens if the FDIC gets a bailout?
[01:56:49.376 --> 01:56:52.697]  Well, first of all, they're broke.
[01:56:52.697 --> 01:56:59.561]  They've asked the banks for an increase of dues over the next two years to get it now.
[01:56:59.561 --> 01:57:01.482]  I don't think that's doable.
[01:57:01.482 --> 01:57:05.204]  And they're going to have to go to the government for $500 billion.
[01:57:06.716 --> 01:57:14.802]  And they'll be subsidized just like Fannie, Freddie, Ginnie, FHA, and all of these other agencies.
[01:57:14.802 --> 01:57:28.252]  And just put that line of all the deposits under $250,000 to cover 1% of those deposits, which are supposedly insured, will cost $700 billion.
[01:57:28.252 --> 01:57:30.694]  So let's say that the U.S.
[01:57:30.694 --> 01:57:31.654]  government gave them $700 billion.
[01:57:33.405 --> 01:57:36.927]  I mean, they're going to be, that's 1% of what they need.
[01:57:36.927 --> 01:57:40.488]  I mean, half the banks in this country are going to go down.
[01:57:40.488 --> 01:57:42.729]  It certainly appears that way.
[01:57:42.729 --> 01:57:46.711]  Between $3,200 and $4,200 are going down.
[01:57:46.711 --> 01:57:49.953]  Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:57:49.953 --> 01:57:53.114]  I mean, if you're listening, folks, it's time to take action.
[01:57:53.114 --> 01:57:54.715]  Any word when this will hit the Senate?
[01:57:54.715 --> 01:57:57.776]  We know that 1207 has passed through Congress.
[01:57:57.776 --> 01:57:59.217]  When is it up for the Senate?
[01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:06.011]  Well, I think it's up to the Senate itself, and we need some great support there.
[01:58:06.011 --> 01:58:08.932]  The last I saw, we had 23 co-sponsors.
[01:58:08.932 --> 01:58:20.757]  We need everybody to contact every Senator and just say, we want you to pass SB 604, I think it is.
[01:58:20.757 --> 01:58:24.078]  And we want that to get passed.
[01:58:24.078 --> 01:58:27.860]  And I think you'll do a great deal of good by doing that, because they do listen.
[01:58:28.735 --> 01:58:30.697]  Bob Chapman, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:30.697 --> 01:58:32.598]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:32.598 --> 01:58:35.180]  Peter Dale Scott in studio in just a moment.
[01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:36.281]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[01:58:36.281 --> 01:58:42.826]  Go check us out at Infowars.com and we're streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:42.826 --> 01:58:45.468]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.468 --> 01:58:48.631]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.776 --> 01:58:55.020]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:57.022]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:57.022 --> 01:59:05.551]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.551 --> 01:59:11.096]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:11.096 --> 01:59:12.718]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.958 --> 01:59:19.460]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:30.525]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.525 --> 01:59:31.285]  That's right.
[01:59:31.285 --> 01:59:33.846]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:33.846 --> 01:59:35.446]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:59:37.387 --> 01:59:40.509]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network Big Brother
[02:00:06.795 --> 02:00:08.576]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.576 --> 02:00:10.318]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.318 --> 02:00:11.919]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.919 --> 02:00:13.460]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:17.663]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.663 --> 02:00:21.726]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.579 --> 02:00:33.021]  All right, folks, we are back.
[02:00:33.021 --> 02:00:34.322]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:34.322 --> 02:00:45.615]  I am Jason Burmess, sitting in Alex on the ground in Hardin, Montana, where they've recently launched a privatized foreign mercenary service at a local prison there.
[02:00:45.615 --> 02:00:50.621]  And again, the guy they put at the head of it, multiple felon, 17 plus aliases.
[02:00:51.121 --> 02:00:57.246]  Over a million dollars in lost civil suits, and he's calling himself Michael Hilton.
[02:00:57.246 --> 02:01:01.710]  But he has many, many aliases, and we are trying to find out who are his boss.
[02:01:01.710 --> 02:01:07.355]  Becky Shea, who's doing PR for them, refusing to discuss who the parent company is.
[02:01:07.355 --> 02:01:12.719]  But with your vigilant efforts, our listeners out there, I'm sure we will get the truth soon enough.
[02:01:12.719 --> 02:01:13.400]  Joining me now
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:15.462]  Is really a legend.
[02:01:15.462 --> 02:01:17.504]  Somebody I've been following for years and years and years.
[02:01:17.504 --> 02:01:19.826]  Somebody I followed even before Alex Jones.
[02:01:19.826 --> 02:01:25.111]  I came across him talking about his initial publication, The War Conspiracy.
[02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:27.974]  I believe that was back in 1972.
[02:01:27.974 --> 02:01:32.098]  He's an author, he's a poet, and in my mind, he's a genius.
[02:01:32.098 --> 02:01:33.980]  Peter Dale Scott, how are you today, sir?
[02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:35.181]  I'm very happy to be here.
[02:01:36.332 --> 02:01:38.133]  You and your fine new studio.
[02:01:38.133 --> 02:01:40.035]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:01:40.035 --> 02:01:47.239]  Why don't you just give people that don't know who you are, who are not familiar with you, you know, what your background is, what your work has been.
[02:01:47.239 --> 02:01:48.420]  I mean, you've done so much.
[02:01:48.420 --> 02:02:01.209]  You've done work on, you know, RFK, JFK, MLK assassinations, extensive work on the continuity of government programs, extensive work into deep politics in 9-11, just a huge body of work.
[02:02:01.926 --> 02:02:07.028]  Yes, well actually, all this time until I retired, I was a professor of English.
[02:02:07.028 --> 02:02:10.550]  So the question is, why would I get into these other fields?
[02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:16.893]  The answer is that before that, I'm a Canadian and I was a diplomat for the Canadian government.
[02:02:16.893 --> 02:02:29.018]  And I had just enough exposure to Indochina in the 1950s to be a very early advocate that America should not make the mistake of the French and go into Vietnam.
[02:02:29.833 --> 02:02:52.277]  And then in researching what was wrong, the reasons why we shouldn't go into Vietnam, I became aware of Kennedy's decision to pull troops out, which was made in October of 63, and then reversed the weekend that he was killed by incoming President Johnson.
[02:02:52.277 --> 02:02:56.218]  And so that got me inevitably interested in the Kennedy assassination.
[02:02:57.154 --> 02:03:02.322]  And from all of that, I've just, you know, for those of you who are old enough to remember the 60s,
[02:03:04.054 --> 02:03:10.016]  It was a terrible decade because Bobby Kennedy was killed, Martin Luther King was killed.
[02:03:10.016 --> 02:03:13.717]  There were some other minor assassinations, too.
[02:03:13.717 --> 02:03:22.439]  And so I, at the time, used to talk about that my specialty was researching parapolitics.
[02:03:22.439 --> 02:03:29.261]  And now I usually use the term deep politics, which seems to have taken a term which will outlast me.
[02:03:29.261 --> 02:03:31.902]  I think people will continue to talk about it.
[02:03:31.902 --> 02:03:32.502]  And I have a book.
[02:03:33.122 --> 02:03:35.764]  By that title.
[02:03:35.764 --> 02:03:50.851]  So that is, and I've continued to study it because I have my conviction that if you study all of these suppressed events, you find certain elements in common.
[02:03:50.851 --> 02:03:56.554]  By knowing more about the Kennedy assassination, it prepares you in a way to be able to study 9-11.
[02:03:58.975 --> 02:04:13.689]  I know that's an odd idea, but I have a book that's the revised issue, reissue of The War Conspiracy lays out the case for saying that those two events have something in common.
[02:04:13.809 --> 02:04:15.149]  Is that back in publication?
[02:04:15.149 --> 02:04:17.270]  Yeah, there's a new edition.
[02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:20.451]  It's not the old book.
[02:04:20.451 --> 02:04:22.952]  This one actually talks about 9-11 and so on.
[02:04:22.952 --> 02:04:25.893]  It came out last year.
[02:04:25.893 --> 02:04:33.915]  If you Google for me, you'll get my website and then from there you'll see how to get the revised
[02:04:34.375 --> 02:04:35.256]  More conspiracy.
[02:04:35.256 --> 02:04:40.281]  Wow, just a great interview coming up for you folks that are not familiar with Peter Dale Scott.
[02:04:40.281 --> 02:04:42.343]  Let me tell you, that was 1972.
[02:04:42.343 --> 02:04:46.867]  To put out a revised edition 36 plus years later is just excellent in my mind.
[02:04:46.867 --> 02:04:48.128]  I can't wait to check it out.
[02:04:48.128 --> 02:04:48.789]  We're going to come back.
[02:04:48.789 --> 02:04:50.570]  We're going to talk about the Obama administration.
[02:04:50.570 --> 02:04:52.472]  We're going to talk about the wars in the Middle East.
[02:04:52.472 --> 02:04:54.134]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:54.134 --> 02:04:56.316]  He'll be coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:04:56.316 --> 02:04:59.379]  PrisonPlanet.tv and TheWars.com
[02:05:00.646 --> 02:05:04.027]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.027 --> 02:05:07.648]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.648 --> 02:05:12.230]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.230 --> 02:05:17.832]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:18.112 --> 02:05:22.896]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.896 --> 02:05:26.499]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.499 --> 02:05:31.323]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.323 --> 02:05:37.888]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.888 --> 02:05:39.850]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.330 --> 02:05:43.532]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.532 --> 02:05:48.015]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:05:48.015 --> 02:05:50.256]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.256 --> 02:05:50.556]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.556 --> 02:05:51.256]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:00.822 --> 02:06:08.568]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:06:08.568 --> 02:06:14.653]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:06:14.653 --> 02:06:17.615]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:06:17.615 --> 02:06:23.520]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:25.461]  This book will work for anyone.
[02:06:25.461 --> 02:06:27.962]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:27.962 --> 02:06:33.584]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.584 --> 02:06:35.665]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.665 --> 02:06:37.405]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.405 --> 02:06:39.946]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:39.946 --> 02:06:44.668]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.668 --> 02:06:48.370]  Go to hereiswhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.370 --> 02:06:50.531]  Again, it is hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:51.491 --> 02:06:53.391]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:53.391 --> 02:07:01.113]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:04.134]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.134 --> 02:07:09.455]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.455 --> 02:07:11.496]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.496 --> 02:07:16.497]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.497 --> 02:07:17.397]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.677 --> 02:07:18.798]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.798 --> 02:07:20.679]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.679 --> 02:07:21.760]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:23.961]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.961 --> 02:07:25.302]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.302 --> 02:07:26.823]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.823 --> 02:07:32.106]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.106 --> 02:07:35.689]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.689 --> 02:07:39.151]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.491 --> 02:07:40.712]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.712 --> 02:07:41.633]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.633 --> 02:07:42.734]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.734 --> 02:07:43.655]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.655 --> 02:07:44.756]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.756 --> 02:07:47.818]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.818 --> 02:07:48.339]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:48.339 --> 02:07:50.000]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.081]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:51.081 --> 02:07:54.044]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.918 --> 02:08:10.639]  We are back.
[02:08:10.639 --> 02:08:11.940]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:11.940 --> 02:08:14.001]  I'm joined by Peter Dale Scott in studio.
[02:08:14.001 --> 02:08:14.882]  A real treat for me.
[02:08:14.882 --> 02:08:19.146]  And during the break, we were just discussing this Michael Hilton character.
[02:08:19.146 --> 02:08:25.371]  And you were just discussing how you looked into the crest and how this was the crest of Montenegro.
[02:08:25.931 --> 02:08:27.172]  Well, actually, Serbia.
[02:08:27.172 --> 02:08:30.234]  Can the camera pick this up?
[02:08:30.234 --> 02:08:32.395]  Absolutely.
[02:08:32.395 --> 02:08:41.321]  This coat of arms was the coat of arms of the Obrenovic family, who were the rulers, the kings of Serbia down until 1903.
[02:08:43.206 --> 02:08:52.894]  When the last one was, I think, assassinated, and then you got the Karadjordjevichs, who were the kings up until World War II.
[02:08:52.894 --> 02:09:00.281]  The only surviving line of that family are the people who call themselves the Princes of Montenegro.
[02:09:00.281 --> 02:09:07.326]  And this Hilton, Michael Hilton, was really Michael Djokovic, is apparently from Montenegro.
[02:09:08.047 --> 02:09:15.454]  So for some reason, you know, if you have it, that's an imperial double eagle, a sign of empire.
[02:09:15.454 --> 02:09:17.036]  And here is a king.
[02:09:17.036 --> 02:09:21.160]  It's a sign, the crown is a sign of monarchy.
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:26.485]  What's that doing on the side of a police car in Hardin, Montana?
[02:09:26.485 --> 02:09:28.126]  Which isn't really a police car.
[02:09:28.126 --> 02:09:30.388]  I mean, they're saying they're American police force.
[02:09:30.388 --> 02:09:31.810]  Well, they're not American.
[02:09:31.810 --> 02:09:33.191]  They're not a police force.
[02:09:33.651 --> 02:09:41.880]  And the guy heading this up is a multiple felon with over... Yesterday it was a dozen aliases, now they're reporting 17 aliases plus.
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:44.003]  Did you ever see this coming in our country?
[02:09:44.003 --> 02:09:51.511]  Did you ever think we'd be at a time where prisons are set up, they're going to be run by foreign mercenaries, and they're going to be training foreign troops?
[02:09:51.511 --> 02:09:52.192]  It's nightmarish!
[02:09:52.692 --> 02:09:56.974]  And foreigners arresting Americans in America.
[02:09:56.974 --> 02:10:05.937]  And also the part of it that really scares me is the outsourcing of the job of spying on Americans.
[02:10:05.937 --> 02:10:09.158]  That's now being handled by private companies.
[02:10:09.158 --> 02:10:12.099]  I did an article about this recently.
[02:10:12.099 --> 02:10:14.780]  Science Applications and SAIC.
[02:10:18.102 --> 02:10:28.288]  They are composed of veterans of intelligence, but they're a private corporation with a contract to various departments of the U.S.
[02:10:28.288 --> 02:10:35.653]  government, and they've been assigned the job of correlating the job of spying on Americans.
[02:10:35.653 --> 02:10:37.094]  So there are these special
[02:10:37.834 --> 02:10:51.880]  Stations set up all over America where members of army counterintelligence sit in the same office with members of SAIC, private people, spying on us.
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:11:00.904]  I, you know, I went all through the Vietnam War and I knew my phone was tapped and I knew that my mail was, odd things happened to my mail.
[02:11:01.824 --> 02:11:06.068]  And it didn't particularly bother me, because I like this country.
[02:11:06.068 --> 02:11:07.710]  I'm not even an American.
[02:11:07.710 --> 02:11:10.112]  I'm a Canadian, but I like America.
[02:11:10.112 --> 02:11:20.182]  And I sort of wanted them to know what I was doing, because I was not planning to put bombs anywhere, and I would prefer that they knew that.
[02:11:20.182 --> 02:11:23.304]  But I'm very uncomfortable that the job of
[02:11:24.798 --> 02:11:34.881]  Watching me is now being handed out to private corporations, because they really have, you know, they have a profit motive.
[02:11:34.881 --> 02:11:46.105]  One of the things that went wrong in Iraq, this same company, SAIC, was given the job of finding out whether there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or not.
[02:11:46.105 --> 02:11:52.287]  And it was big business for them to report, yes, there is, because that meant more contracts and more money.
[02:11:53.107 --> 02:12:09.932]  And, of course, this was one of the biggest intelligence fiascos of the last, well, 50 years, probably, because we waged a whole war on the pretext of the weapons of mass destruction, which absolutely weren't there when they went to look for them.
[02:12:10.652 --> 02:12:20.695]  So the Bush administration set up a committee to find out what went wrong and they put all the SEIC people on the committee.
[02:12:20.695 --> 02:12:29.677]  So obviously they were unable to find or they failed to report that SEIC had been a big part of the problem.
[02:12:29.677 --> 02:12:38.840]  That's what's wrong with privatizing intelligence because a profit motive is going to skew the intelligence and the same thing with privatizing
[02:12:40.521 --> 02:12:49.188]  I don't know who was really responsible for stirring up trouble in Pittsburgh.
[02:12:49.188 --> 02:13:01.278]  I mean, time after time after time, you have peaceful protests which are then broken up in a violent way by the people whose nominal job is to prevent violence.
[02:13:01.278 --> 02:13:02.439]  But they have a stake.
[02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:10.007]  Uh, as private corporations in prolonging the violence that they're supposed to be stopping.
[02:13:10.007 --> 02:13:14.892]  Well, we're talking about even the LRAD weapons that they used at this thing, the long-range acoustical devices.
[02:13:14.892 --> 02:13:22.881]  We find out today, uh, the Washington Times, DHS helps local police nationwide buy military-style sonic devices.
[02:13:22.881 --> 02:13:23.942]  This is huge business.
[02:13:24.202 --> 02:13:29.783]  For the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about on his exit from the presidency.
[02:13:29.783 --> 02:13:32.264]  This is them really coming into fruition.
[02:13:32.264 --> 02:13:36.685]  And you talked about private security firms spying on the American people.
[02:13:36.685 --> 02:13:52.209]  We know through the lawsuit, Hefting v. AT&T, that AT&T and other companies had secret rooms where they split off all the information, everything that went through a data cable, everything that went through your cell phone, was then hard-lined into a database.
[02:13:52.549 --> 02:14:02.577]  Now, I'm not saying that that's all tracked through human eyes, but it is sent through systems like Carnivore and Promise, and they look for key words, key phrases.
[02:14:02.577 --> 02:14:05.360]  In essence, they're spying on the American people 24-7.
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:10.904]  And I wonder if anyone has really thought through the consequences.
[02:14:10.904 --> 02:14:16.549]  What happened in Pittsburgh is really very, very disturbing, because it's like
[02:14:17.710 --> 02:14:22.673]  Serving notice to the American people that the age of peaceful protest is over.
[02:14:22.673 --> 02:14:29.898]  If you go to a peaceful demonstration, you risk losing your hearing from this LRAD, which is a monster.
[02:14:29.898 --> 02:14:39.665]  I mean, you know, in 1984, Orwell didn't have the imagination to foresee some of the things that we now have in place here.
[02:14:39.665 --> 02:14:44.489]  And, you know, I have very mainstream friends who were
[02:14:45.269 --> 02:14:54.116]  People who never protested in their lives but are extremely upset that this kind of... As you say, it's big business.
[02:14:54.116 --> 02:15:14.553]  And, you know, if people can't protest peacefully, well, I don't want to advise them what to do, but I would personally prefer that people protested peacefully than be driven to other forms of protest because peaceful protest is now past history in this country.
[02:15:14.713 --> 02:15:18.394]  Yeah, and I went down, I actually covered on the ground the Pittsburgh G20.
[02:15:18.394 --> 02:15:19.154]  I was there.
[02:15:19.154 --> 02:15:21.634]  They locked down all of downtown Pittsburgh.
[02:15:21.634 --> 02:15:23.375]  It was absolutely impossible to get there.
[02:15:23.375 --> 02:15:26.155]  They had Humvees with military forces.
[02:15:26.155 --> 02:15:28.036]  The National Guard came in.
[02:15:28.036 --> 02:15:30.536]  It was a $19 million project.
[02:15:30.536 --> 02:15:37.978]  I had covered every single one of the quote-unquote protests or out-of-control riots, and I had not seen the force that they used
[02:15:39.258 --> 02:15:43.562]  Just the amount of force ever, what they used on Friday night after the G20.
[02:15:43.562 --> 02:15:50.388]  You know, it was less than, I don't know if you've seen the videos yet, but there were less than 200 peaceful protesters in Shenley Plaza.
[02:15:50.388 --> 02:15:52.330]  I have seen some of them.
[02:15:52.330 --> 02:15:55.053]  All the ones I've seen, the camera ends up sort of going crazy.
[02:15:56.333 --> 02:16:03.436]  I don't want a rubber bullet in the eye.
[02:16:03.436 --> 02:16:04.617]  You lose your hearing.
[02:16:04.617 --> 02:16:08.779]  People are getting hit with tear gas canisters and LRAD weapons.
[02:16:08.779 --> 02:16:10.879]  I was threatened with arrest several times.
[02:16:10.879 --> 02:16:12.500]  I was grabbed by one of the riot police.
[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:13.881]  I'm the only person there.
[02:16:13.881 --> 02:16:16.742]  Literally, the protesters are a couple hundred feet away from me.
[02:16:16.742 --> 02:16:21.144]  All I'm doing is filming the line of military police that are out there.
[02:16:21.144 --> 02:16:22.044]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:16:22.404 --> 02:16:22.804]  You can't
[02:16:37.615 --> 02:16:42.760]  And when we were calling to try to get these guys out, they said, no, there's a different process for protesters.
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:51.027]  Now this is the first time in this country that they detained over a hundred peaceful protesters, took their digital fingerprints, and didn't charge them with anything.
[02:16:51.027 --> 02:16:58.094]  It used to be in this country, you had to be charged with a crime, they would take your fingerprints, but if you were found innocent of that crime, you got that information back.
[02:16:58.094 --> 02:16:59.475]  These people weren't charged with anything.
[02:17:00.615 --> 02:17:01.196]  It's unbelievable.
[02:17:01.196 --> 02:17:08.799]  They're obviously databasing the dissidents to try to quelch us from using our free speech.
[02:17:08.799 --> 02:17:09.940]  It's a deterrence thing.
[02:17:09.940 --> 02:17:17.143]  They want to say to people, you go out and be part of a peaceful protest and you don't know what's going to happen to you, so stay away.
[02:17:22.228 --> 02:17:24.251]  And I just don't see any opposition to it.
[02:17:24.251 --> 02:17:36.805]  And I didn't see, you know, the mainstream media are writing themselves into the history books by their refusal to face these big new issues that are coming up in this country.
[02:17:37.210 --> 02:17:40.613]  Absolutely, and you've been one who was very critical of the Bush administration.
[02:17:40.613 --> 02:17:43.695]  You've gone beyond the left and right paradigm.
[02:17:43.695 --> 02:17:47.798]  You know that this is, you know, one control group, one establishment.
[02:17:47.798 --> 02:17:51.361]  So you've been pretty critical of the Obama administration as well.
[02:17:51.361 --> 02:17:58.806]  I want to get into how they've really advanced the program, how they've advanced continuity of government, how they've advanced
[02:17:59.827 --> 02:18:06.235]  You know, presidential privileges and how, you know, this is and these are executive orders.
[02:18:06.235 --> 02:18:08.858]  This is not a government for and by the people anymore.
[02:18:08.858 --> 02:18:12.622]  We really don't have the system of checks and balances that this country was found on.
[02:18:12.622 --> 02:18:15.125]  That's why we have the three different branches of government.
[02:18:15.125 --> 02:18:17.908]  That's why, you know, Congress is supposed to have oversight.
[02:18:17.908 --> 02:18:19.510]  We don't see that anymore in this country.
[02:18:20.231 --> 02:18:35.436]  I think there's a crucial issue, which is, I hope everybody listening to this program knows, that for 20 years, Rumsfeld and Cheney were planning something called continuity of government measures.
[02:18:35.436 --> 02:18:39.117]  Originally, this was a quite legitimate activity.
[02:18:39.117 --> 02:18:41.758]  What happens if there's an atomic attack and
[02:18:42.839 --> 02:18:49.026]  Washington is hit by a nuclear weapon and we are decapitated.
[02:18:49.026 --> 02:18:51.389]  We don't have a government anymore.
[02:18:51.389 --> 02:19:01.361]  But Cheney and Rumsfeld changed it so it was planning to deal with any emergency and they got an executive order passed under Reagan which redefined
[02:19:02.462 --> 02:19:06.306]  The purpose of COG was to deal with any emergency.
[02:19:06.306 --> 02:19:14.074]  And the amazing thing is these two people went on planning for, in effect, the suspension of the American Constitution.
[02:19:14.074 --> 02:19:17.177]  That's what it's been called.
[02:19:17.177 --> 02:19:19.199]  When neither of them were in the government.
[02:19:20.980 --> 02:19:22.661]  But they were in the continuity of government.
[02:19:22.661 --> 02:19:46.514]  They were in this special thing that was set up under Reagan back in 1981 by a secret order and there's one biography of Rumsfeld that suggests that Clinton didn't even know what was going on and the people who were planning it, originally they were Democrats and Republicans but in the 90s they were all Republicans
[02:19:46.957 --> 02:19:47.637]  Hold that thought.
[02:19:47.637 --> 02:19:49.278]  We're going to be back right after this.
[02:19:49.278 --> 02:19:55.682]  I do cover a lot of this in my film Fabled Enemies, the revamping of the continuity of government or shadow government program.
[02:19:55.682 --> 02:19:56.482]  Please check it out.
[02:19:56.482 --> 02:19:57.563]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:57.563 --> 02:19:58.804]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in.
[02:19:58.804 --> 02:20:00.325]  We'll be back with Peter Dale Scott after this.
[02:20:01.314 --> 02:20:04.836]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[02:20:04.836 --> 02:20:06.837]  Now, going green can save money.
[02:20:06.837 --> 02:20:12.400]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:20.424]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[02:20:20.424 --> 02:20:31.169]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[02:20:31.169 --> 02:20:31.509]  I think so.
[02:21:03.070 --> 02:21:04.531]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:04.531 --> 02:21:10.596]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:21:10.596 --> 02:21:11.396]  That's right.
[02:21:11.396 --> 02:21:15.079]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:21:15.079 --> 02:21:21.164]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:21:21.724 --> 02:21:29.866]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:29.866 --> 02:21:35.347]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:21:35.347 --> 02:21:41.148]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:41.148 --> 02:21:45.669]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:21:45.669 --> 02:21:45.929]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:45.929 --> 02:21:47.769]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:21:51.010 --> 02:21:53.491]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.491 --> 02:21:55.051]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:55.051 --> 02:22:03.093]  It is a big idea.
[02:22:03.093 --> 02:22:05.913]  A new world order.
[02:22:05.913 --> 02:22:10.034]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:22:10.034 --> 02:22:13.615]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:22:13.615 --> 02:22:16.395]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:22:16.395 --> 02:22:18.816]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:22:19.577 --> 02:22:29.953]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:22:29.953 --> 02:22:34.900]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:22:35.379 --> 02:22:39.242]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:22:39.242 --> 02:22:41.823]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:22:41.823 --> 02:22:42.984]  Most people have no idea.
[02:22:42.984 --> 02:22:43.765]  They're not after money.
[02:22:43.765 --> 02:22:45.045]  They have all the money they need.
[02:22:45.045 --> 02:22:46.026]  They're after power.
[02:22:46.026 --> 02:22:47.187]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:24:10.974 --> 02:24:12.375]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:12.375 --> 02:24:13.576]  I am Jason Burma sitting in.
[02:24:13.576 --> 02:24:18.578]  Joining us in studio for PrisonPlanet.tv members is Peter Dale Scott.
[02:24:18.578 --> 02:24:22.961]  And we were just talking about this Continuity of Government program, which is the shadow government.
[02:24:22.961 --> 02:24:25.762]  Tell us how this integrates into the new Obama administration.
[02:24:25.902 --> 02:24:39.525]  Continuity of Government, COG, is a concept that every American should know about because it is a plan for, it's supposed to be, temporary suspension of the Constitution.
[02:24:39.525 --> 02:24:51.488]  And as I wrote in my book, The Road to 9-11, it was instituted for the first time on the morning, before 10 o'clock, on the morning of September the 11th, 2001, in response to these attacks.
[02:24:54.549 --> 02:25:09.568]  Now that might have been an understandable response to an attack which they still didn't know the limits of, but that was codified into the declaration of a state of emergency three days later, on September the 14th.
[02:25:11.250 --> 02:25:16.252]  And there is a law which says that these things have to be renewed.
[02:25:16.252 --> 02:25:20.253]  And so Bush renewed it as late as the fall of 2008.
[02:25:20.253 --> 02:25:33.358]  And then I and another, Dan Hamburg, a former congressman, we started a campaign that Obama should end this once and for all.
[02:25:33.358 --> 02:25:36.399]  And he let us down.
[02:25:36.399 --> 02:25:38.419]  He renewed it just this last month.
[02:25:38.419 --> 02:25:39.700]  He's renewed it again.
[02:25:40.501 --> 02:25:44.685]  And this is a plan, we don't even know what it means.
[02:25:44.685 --> 02:25:58.257]  Congressman DeFazio back in 2007, when he saw that Bush had, again, he was on the Homeland Security Committee, and he saw that there were certain secret orders.
[02:25:58.937 --> 02:26:04.742]  And he was on the oversight subcommittee that should have seen those orders, so he asked to see them.
[02:26:04.742 --> 02:26:11.127]  He was told that he didn't have the clearance to see them, because COG has its own clearances.
[02:26:11.127 --> 02:26:24.678]  This is why I think the report, the 9-11 report, certain things it just can't talk about, they can't find the certain orders because they were done at a higher level of clearance than the
[02:26:25.839 --> 02:26:30.242]  They had to, in order to write the report.
[02:26:30.242 --> 02:26:50.856]  Well, his whole committee wasn't able to see them, but there's another part of the law, and I feel like a voice in the wilderness here because nobody's picked up on this, but it's right there in the law that if a state of emergency is declared, Congress must review it within six months and either
[02:26:51.556 --> 02:26:52.036]  I think so.
[02:27:12.405 --> 02:27:23.789]  And one congressman wrote back and said, well, that provision of the law is no longer operative because it has been overridden by guess what?
[02:27:23.789 --> 02:27:25.610]  Continuity of government.
[02:27:25.610 --> 02:27:32.372]  Well, this is the whole issue of, as you said, three branches of government and checks and balances.
[02:27:32.372 --> 02:27:37.334]  If a small group of people, two of whom are not even in the government,
[02:27:37.914 --> 02:27:38.475]  I think?
[02:27:53.145 --> 02:28:04.675]  Uh, we have a disturbing situation, and when nobody in the media, I say there's the mainstream media, now we have the mainstream internet too, and then we have people like you and me.
[02:28:04.675 --> 02:28:12.462]  The mainstream internet has not picked up on this, but this whole thing should be looked at, and Congress should
[02:28:13.522 --> 02:28:17.944]  First of all, we should find out what secret rules are being put in.
[02:28:17.944 --> 02:28:20.905]  I mean, somebody in Congress should have the right to do that.
[02:28:20.905 --> 02:28:26.047]  We have an intelligence committee that can look at what the CIA is doing.
[02:28:26.047 --> 02:28:33.790]  I would have thought that Homeland Security would be the people who could see what are the secret rules to deal with Homeland Security.
[02:28:33.790 --> 02:28:37.211]  This is, I think, a kind of line in the sand
[02:28:37.831 --> 02:28:44.935]  Whether we're going to go on having a tripartite constitutional frame of government or not.
[02:28:44.935 --> 02:28:51.018]  Well, unfortunately, the dumbed-down public thinks that the shadow government is nothing more than something you would see in a James Bond movie.
[02:28:51.018 --> 02:28:53.780]  They don't even know that it exists, Mr. Scott.
[02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:55.621]  I mean, that's just the reality.
[02:28:55.621 --> 02:28:57.782]  Well, I think they see more and more than they did.
[02:28:57.782 --> 02:28:59.843]  What happened in Pittsburgh, for example.
[02:28:59.843 --> 02:29:03.645]  That's not the American way of doing things, you know.
[02:29:03.645 --> 02:29:06.147]  You have a small group of peaceful protesters.
[02:29:07.027 --> 02:29:17.035]  These companies have these brand new weapons they want to try out and, you know, members of the press getting arrested.
[02:29:17.035 --> 02:29:18.836]  No, I can't say arrested, detained.
[02:29:18.836 --> 02:29:20.037]  He was not booked, right?
[02:29:20.037 --> 02:29:21.518]  Yeah, no, no, not booked at all.
[02:29:21.518 --> 02:29:27.402]  Just detained so that they can see that things are changing.
[02:29:27.402 --> 02:29:27.943]  Absolutely.
[02:29:28.303 --> 02:29:33.266]  Alright, final segment coming up with Peter Dale Scott, one of the great minds of our time, folks.
[02:29:33.266 --> 02:29:36.529]  I can guarantee that his work will go down in history.
[02:29:36.529 --> 02:29:39.491]  Author of The War Conspiracy and much more.
[02:29:39.491 --> 02:29:40.511]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:40.511 --> 02:29:41.732]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in.
[02:29:41.732 --> 02:29:42.693]  We'll be back after this.
[02:29:42.693 --> 02:29:51.479]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:29:51.479 --> 02:29:52.860]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.860 --> 02:29:54.381]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.393 --> 02:30:00.856]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.856 --> 02:30:05.098]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.098 --> 02:30:07.119]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.119 --> 02:30:15.623]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.623 --> 02:30:21.186]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.186 --> 02:30:22.807]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:23.027 --> 02:30:29.553]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.553 --> 02:30:40.603]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.603 --> 02:30:41.384]  That's right.
[02:30:41.384 --> 02:30:43.946]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:30:43.946 --> 02:30:45.527]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:30:48.089 --> 02:31:06.118]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.

[02:32:02.730 --> 02:32:04.470]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:07.151]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:32:07.151 --> 02:32:12.293]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[02:33:04.266 --> 02:33:10.890]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:33:10.890 --> 02:33:13.852]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:31.078 --> 02:33:32.619]  Alright folks, we are back.
[02:33:32.619 --> 02:33:33.760]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:35.842]  I'm Jason Vermas sitting here with Peter Dale Scott.
[02:33:35.842 --> 02:33:39.385]  He's going to remain with us for a few more moments and then we're going to start taking your calls.
[02:33:40.559 --> 02:33:49.385]  Going over some of the mainstream news here, that again, foreign mercenary forces are in the United States under the guise of American police force.
[02:33:49.385 --> 02:33:53.087]  It's not American, it's not a police force.
[02:33:53.087 --> 02:34:01.732]  But we were just talking a little bit about COG and how that kind of intertwines into this government drug dealing, and we talked about Iran-Contra over the break.
[02:34:01.732 --> 02:34:07.536]  Why don't you tell people about Oliver North's revelations about continuity of government during Iran-Contra?
[02:34:08.656 --> 02:34:22.262]  Almost all that we know about continuity of government actually goes back to the era when there was a congressional committee on Iran-Contra and Oliver North was a witness.
[02:34:22.262 --> 02:34:27.404]  And a very good journalist, Alonzo Charty, wrote for the Miami...
[02:34:32.606 --> 02:34:40.957]  Yes, for the Miami Herald, an article where he described it in some detail as a plan for the suspension of the Constitution.
[02:34:40.957 --> 02:34:49.629]  And Congressman Jack Brooks from Texas was on the committee and he asked Oliver North on camera, on television,
[02:34:50.289 --> 02:34:56.392]  Is it true that you have been working on plans to suspend the American Constitution?
[02:34:56.392 --> 02:34:58.653]  And the most amazing thing happened.
[02:34:58.653 --> 02:35:07.456]  The chairman of the committee, who was a Democrat, Senator Inouye, banged his gavel and said, oh, we can't go into that in an open session.
[02:35:07.456 --> 02:35:10.557]  We have to go into that in a secret session.
[02:35:10.557 --> 02:35:16.040]  Thereby telling us all, in effect, that there was something there that was so
[02:35:17.100 --> 02:35:23.362]  sensitive that the American people couldn't hear about it.
[02:35:23.362 --> 02:35:32.486]  And it was amazing that the New York Times had printed every word of the hearings and they printed that exchange.
[02:35:32.486 --> 02:35:36.627]  But they did a news story about what happened that day and didn't mention that.
[02:35:38.368 --> 02:35:50.696]  Oliver North, I mean, the idea that Oliver North was doing something about suspending the American Constitution was not in the news story or any other mainstream media news story.
[02:35:50.696 --> 02:35:58.041]  That's where I really became, for the first time, aware of the increasing gap between what's going on at a deeper level.
[02:35:59.362 --> 02:36:05.467]  I call Iran-Contra a deep event, the Kennedy assassination a deep event, 9-11 a deep event.
[02:36:05.467 --> 02:36:13.113]  We're just getting used to the fact that every now and then something happens that we're not going to get to the bottom of.
[02:36:13.113 --> 02:36:20.959]  And what we have to be aware of is accumulatively these deep events are doing more to shape where the country is going.
[02:36:21.699 --> 02:36:27.741]  Then all the public debate that goes on in Congress, and that's particularly true of 9-11.
[02:36:27.741 --> 02:36:31.823]  We still haven't got to the bottom of it.
[02:36:31.823 --> 02:36:40.966]  Even the chairman of it had admitted that they didn't get proper information from the CIA.
[02:36:40.966 --> 02:36:49.990]  Louis Freeh, who was head of the FBI at the time, has said that it's perfectly understandable that people would want a new investigation.
[02:36:51.511 --> 02:36:56.835]  And yet, we're not going to get a new investigation because it's a deep event.
[02:36:56.835 --> 02:37:07.963]  But the most important constitutional event of this century to date has been the passing of COG on the morning of September the 11th, 2001.
[02:37:10.164 --> 02:37:13.546]  And it's barely reported anywhere.
[02:37:13.546 --> 02:37:20.609]  The 9-11 report says, yes, it happened, but we decided not to look into COG.
[02:37:20.609 --> 02:37:25.272]  They admit in their report that it did happen and that they didn't investigate it.
[02:37:25.939 --> 02:37:26.719]  It is shocking.
[02:37:26.719 --> 02:37:38.843]  Some other things that they've said, you know, Lee Hamilton and Thomas Kean did a book, Without Precedent, where they admitted that, you know, NORAD and the FAA just lied to them and they said it was so far from the truth, we don't know why they said what they did.
[02:37:38.843 --> 02:37:41.864]  I was actually one of the first people to get
[02:37:42.404 --> 02:37:50.768]  The NORAD tapes, which had been vetted, but you know, the first person to go through 30 plus hours of audio over, I think it was 21 separate channels.
[02:37:50.768 --> 02:37:54.170]  And you listen to these things and they're talking about drills going on.
[02:37:54.170 --> 02:37:56.772]  In fact, you know, in the movie Fabled Enemies, I go over it.
[02:37:56.772 --> 02:38:08.498]  They had to call in to Cheyenne Mountain 20 minutes after Flight 93 had been downed and ask them to take the inputs out of their screens, out of radar, because they were getting even more hijackings.
[02:38:08.498 --> 02:38:09.118]  Oh my God.
[02:38:09.178 --> 02:38:21.404]  Yeah, and I play the audio for you with them frantically calling into Cheyenne Mountain, telling them to take the inputs off, and publicly we know they were following Delta 1989, which supposedly had a bomb on board.
[02:38:21.404 --> 02:38:25.366]  They were following a Korean Airlines plane out of Alaska coming in.
[02:38:25.366 --> 02:38:27.767]  Oh, I know about that one, because it came down in Canada.
[02:38:27.827 --> 02:38:28.587]  Yes, that's right.
[02:38:28.587 --> 02:38:30.648]  It did come down in Canada before it was able to reach.
[02:38:30.648 --> 02:38:36.191]  So, you know, you read over and over and over that not a single plane was brought down.
[02:38:36.191 --> 02:38:38.112]  One plane was forced down.
[02:38:38.112 --> 02:38:42.054]  It was forced down by the Canadians who were not clued in to whatever was happening.
[02:38:42.054 --> 02:38:53.739]  Well, if you go and you check the FBI's initial, I believe it's Team 8 or Team 7, they've now released some documents where they admit, and they give you the tail numbers of not only the four hijacked planes, but four more.
[02:38:53.999 --> 02:38:54.320]  That's right.
[02:39:09.159 --> 02:39:10.660]  Win their Supreme Court decision.
[02:39:10.660 --> 02:39:13.922]  Just getting it to the Supreme Court is almost a victory.
[02:39:13.922 --> 02:39:16.024]  And, you know, shining the light in the darkness.
[02:39:16.024 --> 02:39:18.746]  And that's what you've been able to do so well.
[02:39:18.746 --> 02:39:24.550]  You know, we're going to let you go because we've got an extensive interview to do later on for my upcoming film, Invisible Empire.
[02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:25.851]  Thank you so much for your time.
[02:39:25.851 --> 02:39:27.052]  Thank you, Jason.
[02:39:27.052 --> 02:39:29.353]  It was a great pleasure to actually see you.
[02:39:29.353 --> 02:39:30.234]  Just talk to you.
[02:39:30.234 --> 02:39:30.835]  Oh, excellent.
[02:39:30.835 --> 02:39:31.815]  Thank you so much.
[02:39:31.815 --> 02:39:34.177]  So we're going to go to your calls in just a moment, folks.
[02:39:34.177 --> 02:39:36.519]  But I want to thank the final sponsor of the day.
[02:39:36.519 --> 02:39:36.879]  You can just
[02:39:37.319 --> 02:39:38.160]  Get up and go.
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:40.824]  I'm not going to force you to stay the other 10 minutes.
[02:39:40.824 --> 02:39:42.286]  FrontSight.com.
[02:39:42.286 --> 02:39:43.747]  That's FrontSight.com.
[02:39:43.747 --> 02:39:46.070]  S-I-G-H-T.com.
[02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:48.413]  You want to learn how to use your firearm.
[02:39:48.413 --> 02:39:50.436]  You want to be trained by the best.
[02:39:50.436 --> 02:39:52.459]  You got to go to FrontSight.com.
[02:39:52.459 --> 02:39:54.882]  They help make this program possible.
[02:39:56.209 --> 02:40:11.750]  You know just great people you know if you want if you want to use a firearm in the correct manner you know I was going through the news wires today this is just a side story I thought it was a great story but a five-year-old boy was able to shoot down in Texas by the way out of Houston an 800 pound alligator
[02:40:14.093 --> 02:40:19.554]  Now, all you people that want to disarm the American public, if this child did not have a firearm, guess what?
[02:40:19.554 --> 02:40:21.975]  That 800-pound alligator probably would have eaten him.
[02:40:21.975 --> 02:40:24.636]  So there are many reasons to arm yourself.
[02:40:24.636 --> 02:40:26.416]  It's our Second Amendment right.
[02:40:26.416 --> 02:40:33.538]  And, you know, Peter Dale Scott alluded to it, you know, when peaceful protest is gone in this country, what do we have left?
[02:40:34.298 --> 02:40:39.659]  Well, you know, Jack McLam out there will tell you, you know, we got the voting box and we've got the cartridge box.
[02:40:39.659 --> 02:40:43.941]  And I really sincerely hope it never comes down to that cartridge box.
[02:40:43.941 --> 02:40:45.381]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[02:40:45.381 --> 02:40:46.401]  Stephen in Texas.
[02:40:46.401 --> 02:40:49.322]  Stephen, you're on the line.
[02:40:49.322 --> 02:40:49.682]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:49.682 --> 02:40:50.802]  Hey, good afternoon, Jason.
[02:40:50.802 --> 02:40:51.763]  Great show.
[02:40:51.763 --> 02:40:52.863]  Thank you.
[02:40:52.863 --> 02:40:57.984]  OK, first of all, a follow up on what I was telling you about yesterday.
[02:40:57.984 --> 02:40:59.965]  When I called out there to Hardin,
[02:41:00.618 --> 02:41:02.878]  I talked to a lady in City Hall.
[02:41:02.878 --> 02:41:25.362]  She said there wasn't anybody available from the City Council, but I specifically asked her, and this is one thing I really think needs to be pushed, because, okay, we're investigating who is this Michael Hilton, who's the parent company, all that, and that's all important, but I think the biggest issue, and this is what I asked her about, I said, I understand that this is a detention center.
[02:41:25.362 --> 02:41:28.423]  I said, who are they planning on detaining
[02:41:29.449 --> 02:41:33.135]  Who are they going to have for detention?
[02:41:33.135 --> 02:41:35.919]  She would not answer my question.
[02:41:35.919 --> 02:41:40.445]  And now they're saying, no, this isn't a Guantanamo type deal.
[02:41:40.445 --> 02:41:41.247]  Well, they're right.
[02:41:41.247 --> 02:41:42.328]  It's not.
[02:41:42.328 --> 02:41:43.330]  It's for me and you.
[02:41:43.330 --> 02:41:44.732]  And if you think about it,
[02:41:45.390 --> 02:41:51.476]  You know, I thought it was really strange that Becky Shea actually took Alex inside the facility.
[02:41:51.476 --> 02:41:54.600]  You know, why would they do that when this is obviously a FEMA camp?
[02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:56.442]  I'll tell you what I believe, personally.
[02:41:56.442 --> 02:42:01.968]  Number one, okay, try to quell the crowds in there, you know, uproar about this.
[02:42:01.968 --> 02:42:07.874]  But I think, secondly, this was a psych job that they were trying to do on Alex, and you can ask them about this.
[02:42:08.274 --> 02:42:14.726]  Well, they're sending him a subtle message saying, Mr. Jones, welcome to what will ultimately be your home.
[02:42:16.345 --> 02:42:20.267]  Well, let's hope that that's not the case, but I do see where you could come to that conclusion.
[02:42:20.267 --> 02:42:29.152]  And I thought it was very bizarre that they had that sign about the hostages outside of the premises that we read earlier on the show today.
[02:42:29.152 --> 02:42:41.519]  If you saw the local news report, and we're going to be playing that in an upcoming segment along with the Pittsburgh video of them just gassing students who are on campus watching from a balcony.
[02:42:41.519 --> 02:42:43.300]  Believe it or not, I mean, it's there.
[02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:44.181]  We can't deny it.
[02:42:44.881 --> 02:42:57.130]  And I sincerely hope you're wrong, but when you have foreign mercenaries coming into this country who are multiple felons about to train other foreign mercenary and military groups, we have to ask these questions.
[02:42:57.130 --> 02:43:00.933]  And by the way, again, we have to find out about this Richard Culver fellow.
[02:43:00.933 --> 02:43:03.555]  Is he really Michael Hilton's boss?
[02:43:03.555 --> 02:43:07.598]  What has he done since he left as a colonel of the U.S.
[02:43:07.598 --> 02:43:07.938]  Army?
[02:43:07.938 --> 02:43:09.299]  What are his connections?
[02:43:09.299 --> 02:43:10.240]  Who owns
[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:12.301]  Hi Jason, glad to hear you again.
[02:43:12.301 --> 02:43:14.342]  I wanted to let you know three things.
[02:43:14.342 --> 02:43:16.564]  One, I'm getting the word out with the films I have bought.
[02:43:37.498 --> 02:43:41.020]  And my podiatrist, he's got four brothers that are doctors.
[02:43:41.020 --> 02:43:42.440]  They're getting him out.
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:45.982]  They've been getting reviews back from him, so that's neat.
[02:43:45.982 --> 02:43:52.785]  Secondly of all, I went yesterday to the heart clinic to get my heart checked.
[02:43:52.785 --> 02:43:54.886]  They have a scan there.
[02:43:54.886 --> 02:43:56.487]  I wasn't really paying attention.
[02:43:56.487 --> 02:44:05.631]  I was half asleep, and the lady there told me to wash my hands with sanitizer, place my right hand on this machine,
[02:44:06.332 --> 02:44:08.693]  And it scanned my whole, you know, scanned everything.
[02:44:08.693 --> 02:44:12.554]  Yeah, it's the new, it's the new way that they take fingerprints and they database you.
[02:44:12.554 --> 02:44:13.894]  They did this to Rob Due.
[02:44:13.894 --> 02:44:18.415]  Again, no charges brought against him, a different process for protesters.
[02:44:18.415 --> 02:44:30.678]  It's the new digital way to get your biometric information and they're going to be doing this at your local health clinics, at your checkups, and of course by the police, military, and now these privatized security forces.
[02:44:31.278 --> 02:44:34.479]  You know, the control grid is ever encroaching, and it is here.
[02:44:34.479 --> 02:44:35.839]  I thank you for the call, Betty.
[02:44:35.839 --> 02:44:38.080]  Let's go to Wilson in Florida.
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:40.441]  Wilson, you're on the line.
[02:44:40.441 --> 02:44:42.261]  Good afternoon, Jason.
[02:44:42.261 --> 02:44:49.183]  I'm extremely delighted that you're filling in for Alex, because I love how you mix your intellect and humor at the same time.
[02:44:49.183 --> 02:44:50.464]  Well, thank you.
[02:44:50.464 --> 02:44:57.166]  I just wanted you to comment on me, because I was actually thinking about joining the National Guard, because I'm a college student.
[02:44:57.166 --> 02:44:58.226]  I just moved to Florida.
[02:44:59.011 --> 02:45:09.195]  It's hard for me because I'm thinking about joining the National Guard, but at the same time, I'm a devoted listener and follower of all the news that you guys report.
[02:45:09.195 --> 02:45:10.476]  I'm kind of conflicted on this.
[02:45:10.476 --> 02:45:13.637]  You know, we need good people like yourself in the military.
[02:45:13.637 --> 02:45:14.277]  Absolutely.
[02:45:14.277 --> 02:45:16.378]  And you can only help by being in the military.
[02:45:16.378 --> 02:45:21.240]  However, you know, I don't want to put you in a position, and I almost joined the National Guard before I woke up.
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:23.461]  I had taken the ASFAB test.
[02:45:23.461 --> 02:45:25.922]  I went with my buddy who did join the National Guard.
[02:45:26.742 --> 02:45:29.425]  And, you know, he ended up being deployed into Iraq.
[02:45:29.425 --> 02:45:33.528]  This is back in, I believe, 99-2000, and I was much like you.
[02:45:33.528 --> 02:45:35.189]  You know, I didn't have a lot of money.
[02:45:35.189 --> 02:45:36.370]  I was going to college.
[02:45:36.370 --> 02:45:40.274]  I'm like, well, you know, it's a couple months a year and one weekend a month.
[02:45:40.274 --> 02:45:41.775]  This is something that I can do.
[02:45:41.775 --> 02:45:43.256]  It'll give me discipline.
[02:45:43.256 --> 02:45:45.258]  It'll put me in better physical condition.
[02:45:45.258 --> 02:45:51.023]  But is it really going to put us in better physical condition when they're mandating that you must take the H1N1 shot?
[02:45:52.564 --> 02:46:03.475]  If you are indeed in the military, National Guard included, and now, you know, some military personnel had protested taking a mandatory anthrax shot, and that was just shot down.
[02:46:03.475 --> 02:46:15.648]  That's about to go to the Supreme Court, and I don't really have a lot of confidence that the Supreme Court is going to uphold, you know, an individual's freedom to say no to something that has, again, formaldehyde in it.
[02:46:16.028 --> 02:46:17.148]  We're good to go!
[02:46:38.874 --> 02:46:41.475]  I was just calling basically to see if you guys could send out a message to Gun Rights
[02:46:58.070 --> 02:47:01.952]  Activists and people who want to defend our Second Amendment across the country.
[02:47:01.952 --> 02:47:06.654]  In California, I don't know if you guys are aware, there's a bill that's on the governor's desk right now.
[02:47:06.654 --> 02:47:08.034]  It's called AB 962.
[02:47:08.034 --> 02:47:13.336]  It's a mail order ammo ban for the state of California.
[02:47:13.336 --> 02:47:22.720]  And there's also another bill in the process that was put into legislation in San Francisco from a senator out there.
[02:47:24.511 --> 02:47:26.672]  His name is Mark Lozano.
[02:47:26.672 --> 02:47:49.817]  Well, I gotta tell you, I am not aware of that, but those seem like serious and real issues, so if you could get those bill numbers down and just a brief synopsis of what they're all about, links to the subsections that specifically talk about what you just said on air, please send them to rob at infowars.com, articles at infowars.com, and writers at infowars.com, and hopefully we can get them up on the site, and we'll be talking
[02:47:49.957 --> 02:47:53.860]  Yes, getting back to a different subject matter, I would like to know what's Russia's take
[02:48:18.991 --> 02:48:21.094]  On us going into Ireland.
[02:48:21.094 --> 02:48:21.975]  Yeah, that's what I was hoping.
[02:48:39.386 --> 02:49:02.817]  The mainstream media continues to put out the myth that Russia attacked Georgia over a year ago, Russia's this evil giant, Russia's the new enemy, when even the EU, which is a globalist organization, the European Union is basically one of these globalist wet dreams that has occurred, this consolidation of power, this move towards world government, and even their investigation
[02:49:03.317 --> 02:49:03.558]  Also
[02:49:18.575 --> 02:49:19.135]  We're good to go.
[02:49:47.458 --> 02:49:49.219]  Yes, good afternoon, sir.
[02:49:49.219 --> 02:49:50.340]  Good afternoon.
[02:49:50.340 --> 02:49:53.122]  I just got three simple questions, if you may.
[02:49:53.122 --> 02:49:53.702]  Okay.
[02:49:53.702 --> 02:49:57.345]  One, where is the governor of Montana?
[02:49:57.345 --> 02:49:58.206]  That's a good question.
[02:49:58.206 --> 02:49:59.567]  I don't think he's weighed in.
[02:49:59.567 --> 02:50:01.468]  You know, the attorney general has now weighed in.
[02:50:01.468 --> 02:50:03.369]  They say that they're going to do a probe.
[02:50:03.369 --> 02:50:05.531]  I'm not sure anybody's called the governor's office.
[02:50:05.531 --> 02:50:06.952]  I would encourage people to do so.
[02:50:06.952 --> 02:50:08.193]  Go ahead, Nick.
[02:50:08.193 --> 02:50:11.415]  Second one, where is the local county sheriff?
[02:50:12.059 --> 02:50:13.120]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:16.021]  They're trying to disband the Sheriff's Department.
[02:50:16.021 --> 02:50:24.525]  I don't know where the local County Sheriff is, but they have been trying to get rid of them because they say that they're unnecessary, the town is small.
[02:50:24.525 --> 02:50:27.526]  Like Alex said, it's black in most of the town.
[02:50:27.526 --> 02:50:29.327]  You know, there's not a lot of lights around.
[02:50:29.327 --> 02:50:31.708]  It's not like this is a 24-7 running city.
[02:50:31.708 --> 02:50:34.049]  This is a small, small area.
[02:50:34.049 --> 02:50:35.770]  What's the third question?
[02:50:35.770 --> 02:50:41.333]  The third question is, I just don't understand how
[02:50:42.140 --> 02:50:45.923]  You can usurp the authority of a county sheriff, not under the Constitution.
[02:50:45.923 --> 02:50:47.485]  Well, that's how you get rid of them, Nick.
[02:50:47.485 --> 02:50:50.447]  You just say that they don't exist and we need a privatized police force.
[02:50:50.447 --> 02:50:52.409]  Unfortunately, again, this is the new America.
[02:50:52.409 --> 02:50:53.250]  I thank you for the call.
[02:50:53.250 --> 02:50:54.211]  More calls after this.
[02:50:54.211 --> 02:50:55.532]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:55.532 --> 02:50:58.775]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in PrisonPlanet.TV, InfoWars.com.
[02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:05.052]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:51:05.052 --> 02:51:08.954]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:51:08.954 --> 02:51:12.676]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:51:12.676 --> 02:51:19.599]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[02:51:23.001 --> 02:51:23.261]  I think so.
[02:51:51.434 --> 02:51:56.598]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:51:56.598 --> 02:52:01.381]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[02:52:01.381 --> 02:52:05.124]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dry guide.
[02:52:05.124 --> 02:52:12.288]  During times of physical and emotional stress like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[02:52:12.288 --> 02:52:17.292]  You should only store what you usually eat because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[02:52:17.572 --> 02:52:19.512]  Lucky for you, there's the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[02:52:19.512 --> 02:52:26.134]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[02:52:26.134 --> 02:52:31.075]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[02:52:31.075 --> 02:52:40.417]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[02:52:40.417 --> 02:52:47.078]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[02:52:47.478 --> 02:52:47.999]  Probably.
[02:52:47.999 --> 02:52:52.306]  The advances made in food storage from the World War II era till now are equally great.
[02:52:52.306 --> 02:52:57.093]  Visit the website at www.freezedryguy.com or call toll free 866-404-3663.
[02:53:04.821 --> 02:53:08.342]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:53:08.342 --> 02:53:10.642]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:53:10.642 --> 02:53:18.984]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:53:18.984 --> 02:53:26.426]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:53:26.426 --> 02:53:33.367]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:53:33.815 --> 02:53:38.158]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:53:38.158 --> 02:53:42.121]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:53:42.121 --> 02:53:44.403]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:53:44.403 --> 02:53:48.846]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:53:48.846 --> 02:53:56.171]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:54:01.257 --> 02:54:02.201]  Yeah, we're good.
[02:54:10.120 --> 02:54:11.060]  We are back!
[02:54:11.060 --> 02:54:12.601]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[02:54:40.222 --> 02:54:43.025]  Words are ringing true on the bumper music, unfortunately, folks.
[02:54:43.025 --> 02:54:50.592]  I want to remind everybody that Fall of the Republic, the presidency of Barack Obama, drops October 21st.
[02:54:50.592 --> 02:54:55.076]  You can pre-order it now at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[02:54:55.076 --> 02:54:59.961]  It's got a ton of bonus features, including Oath Keepers and Charlie Sheen's message to the President.
[02:54:59.961 --> 02:55:02.963]  Fall of the Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is
[02:55:03.624 --> 02:55:06.247]  Bankrupting the US economy by design.
[02:55:06.247 --> 02:55:12.272]  Leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency.
[02:55:12.272 --> 02:55:16.817]  And we discussed the SDR unit earlier in the program.
[02:55:16.817 --> 02:55:18.038]  Folks, go get it now.
[02:55:18.038 --> 02:55:18.879]  Pre-order it today.
[02:55:18.879 --> 02:55:23.383]  You'll be the first to get Barack Obama, fall of the republic.
[02:55:24.989 --> 02:55:26.430]  Alright, we're going to continue with your calls.
[02:55:26.430 --> 02:55:28.992]  We're going to take calls all next hour.
[02:55:28.992 --> 02:55:37.617]  If you want to talk about this Michael Hilton character, if you want to talk about the police state, if you want to talk about the H1N1 vaccinations, now's the time to call in.
[02:55:37.617 --> 02:55:38.918]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:38.918 --> 02:55:43.921]  Alex is going to be joining us in the last 20 minutes of the program.
[02:55:43.921 --> 02:55:46.903]  Let's go to our next caller, Richard in New York.
[02:55:46.903 --> 02:55:50.245]  Richard, you're on the line.
[02:55:50.245 --> 02:55:52.086]  Yes, Jason.
[02:55:52.086 --> 02:55:54.228]  My name is Richard Kurt.
[02:55:55.581 --> 02:55:58.446]  I am a journalist.
[02:55:58.446 --> 02:56:05.318]  I understand that you may have some career opportunities at Prison Planet.
[02:56:06.599 --> 02:56:15.447]  Um, you know, I'm not sure who we're hiring, Richard, but you'd have to check in with, like, articles at InfoWars or writers at InfoWars and check that out, show tips at InfoWars.
[02:56:15.447 --> 02:56:17.509]  I don't handle any of the hirings.
[02:56:17.509 --> 02:56:19.711]  You know, I sit here, I do my own thing.
[02:56:19.711 --> 02:56:21.653]  I'm working on a movie most of the time.
[02:56:21.653 --> 02:56:23.354]  I do the weekly radio broadcast.
[02:56:23.354 --> 02:56:25.016]  I sub in for Alex.
[02:56:25.016 --> 02:56:25.997]  I go on the scene.
[02:56:26.617 --> 02:56:33.584]  of many of these organizations, but I do know that if you start submitting articles to writers and articles, you know, that's how Curt Nemo got started.
[02:56:33.584 --> 02:56:39.089]  And Curt Nemo, obviously, one of the premier writers for InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:56:39.089 --> 02:56:40.670]  I appreciate the interest.
[02:56:40.670 --> 02:56:42.972]  Let's go to Robert in California.
[02:56:42.972 --> 02:56:45.435]  Robert, you're on the line.
[02:56:45.435 --> 02:56:45.855]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:45.855 --> 02:56:50.920]  Jason, I want to tell you what a great job you did last night and a great job today.
[02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:52.081]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:56:52.725 --> 02:57:09.458]  But let me confirm exactly what you and Alex were saying, and I want to say that I have a friend, I'm not going to get into detail, but his spouse is in the Department of Immigration, and she's a higher-up in the Department of Immigration in Washington, D.C.
[02:57:09.458 --> 02:57:20.147]  And she told him, because I called him today to warn him not to take the shots, and I told him about the mercenary camp, and he told me that his girlfriend
[02:57:21.337 --> 02:57:32.965]  Has seen that they are giving citizenship to foreign mercenary soldiers fighting alongside the troops in Afghanistan and in Iraq, my friend.
[02:57:32.965 --> 02:57:43.293]  It confirms exactly what you and Alex Jones have been saying at huge numbers where she is looking at it and seeing that it's disturbing her and she works for the government.
[02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:45.941]  Well, it's in the thousands, no doubt.
[02:57:45.941 --> 02:57:49.402]  And remember, foreign troops on U.S.
[02:57:49.402 --> 02:57:53.064]  streets will be more apt to round out American citizens.
[02:57:53.064 --> 02:57:57.326]  They will be more apt to use violent force against American citizens.
[02:57:57.326 --> 02:58:04.289]  They will be less apt to rise up against the state because they look at this as their meal ticket, their way to a better life.
[02:58:04.289 --> 02:58:05.729]  So they won't care.
[02:58:05.729 --> 02:58:09.651]  I mean, I don't understand how people cannot get the fact
[02:58:10.171 --> 02:58:26.602]  That it is bad news to have a foreign mercenary criminal, I mean this guy Hilton, with 17 plus aliases, running a privatized detention center that's going to be training other foreign mercenaries and troops.
[02:58:26.602 --> 02:58:28.363]  Again, it's the end of America.
[02:58:28.363 --> 02:58:29.324]  It's mind-blowing.
[02:58:29.324 --> 02:58:31.485]  It's hard for me to understand.
[02:58:31.485 --> 02:58:32.966]  It's hard for me to conceive.
[02:58:32.966 --> 02:58:34.247]  Yet it's right in front of my face.
[02:58:34.247 --> 02:58:35.188]  We'll be back after this.
[02:58:35.188 --> 02:58:36.408]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:36.408 --> 02:58:37.069]  Taking your calls.
[02:58:43.706 --> 02:58:46.188]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.188 --> 02:58:51.033]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.033 --> 02:58:54.416]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.416 --> 02:58:58.040]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:58.040 --> 02:59:02.604]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.604 --> 02:59:08.210]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:59:08.490 --> 02:59:13.253]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.253 --> 02:59:16.875]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.875 --> 02:59:21.698]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.698 --> 02:59:28.262]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.262 --> 02:59:30.203]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:59:30.703 --> 02:59:33.905]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:59:33.905 --> 02:59:38.389]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:59:38.389 --> 02:59:40.190]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:59:40.190 --> 02:59:40.630]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:40.930]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.930 --> 02:59:41.171]  Don't wait.
[02:59:41.171 --> 02:59:41.791]  Call today.
[02:59:41.791 --> 02:59:42.832]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.832 --> 02:59:44.113]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:07.774 --> 03:00:13.359]  Streaming live from PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.359 --> 03:00:21.886]  Alex set to join us in the final 20 minutes of this hour with a report from Hardin, Montana on the ground.
[03:00:22.918 --> 03:00:28.803]  Getting as much intel, as much information as he possibly can as this story breaks nationwide.
[03:00:28.803 --> 03:00:44.277]  And this is a call to all the people out there that have not lost their souls, that have not lost their humanity, that have not lost the ability to love one another, to care for one another, to look out for one another, to take action today, to decide this is the day you change your life.
[03:00:45.543 --> 03:00:51.845]  To get this information out to your mother, your father, your brother, your sister, your neighbor, your friends.
[03:00:51.845 --> 03:01:03.188]  It is so vital, so important that we stop this right now before this program expands from Montana into California, into New York, into Chicago.
[03:01:04.124 --> 03:01:08.226]  Where some of the leaders are now saying, you know, the streets are just too dangerous, we need martial law.
[03:01:08.226 --> 03:01:17.589]  We had the Schenectady mayor trying to say the crime was so bad there they were going to disband the police department and bring in the military for martial law.
[03:01:17.589 --> 03:01:22.331]  I can promise you folks, martial law is not what this country was founded on.
[03:01:22.331 --> 03:01:26.393]  Martial law is not the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[03:01:26.393 --> 03:01:30.715]  Martial law does not involve a free populace.
[03:01:31.806 --> 03:01:33.967]  Martial law is tyranny.
[03:01:33.967 --> 03:01:36.268]  Martial law is a nightmare.
[03:01:36.268 --> 03:01:47.092]  And these are the steps towards martial law when you bring in foreign mercenary forces who are under the direction of private corporations who remain as of yet unnamed.
[03:01:47.092 --> 03:01:50.554]  And that is the reality we are dealing with today.
[03:01:50.554 --> 03:01:51.454]  Today.
[03:01:51.454 --> 03:01:53.015]  This isn't in the future.
[03:01:53.015 --> 03:01:54.475]  This is now.
[03:01:54.475 --> 03:01:57.476]  So please stand up for what is good in this world.
[03:01:57.476 --> 03:01:58.157]  For what is right.
[03:01:58.897 --> 03:02:01.939]  For that baby in the crib in the other room.
[03:02:01.939 --> 03:02:06.482]  For your son or daughter who's off to kindergarten.
[03:02:06.482 --> 03:02:11.365]  For your teenager about to graduate high school and move on to college.
[03:02:11.365 --> 03:02:12.825]  There is so much to live for.
[03:02:12.825 --> 03:02:15.527]  There's so much that is still good in this country.
[03:02:15.527 --> 03:02:16.768]  We can work together.
[03:02:16.768 --> 03:02:19.329]  We can save this country.
[03:02:19.329 --> 03:02:20.630]  If we want to.
[03:02:20.630 --> 03:02:22.271]  If we decide to take action.
[03:02:22.271 --> 03:02:24.813]  If we decide that we have great power within ourselves.
[03:02:25.751 --> 03:02:27.311]  Alright, let's continue with the calls.
[03:02:27.311 --> 03:02:29.272]  Let's go to Lou in Massachusetts.
[03:02:29.272 --> 03:02:31.672]  Lou, you're online.
[03:02:31.672 --> 03:02:32.913]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:32.913 --> 03:02:35.093]  Hi, Jason.
[03:02:35.093 --> 03:02:40.574]  I've got some information about the Richard Culver character.
[03:02:40.574 --> 03:02:42.435]  Let's hear it.
[03:02:42.435 --> 03:02:50.336]  I just did some basic internet searches and it looks like he is a director for a company called International SOS.
[03:02:50.336 --> 03:02:51.877]  What they do
[03:02:53.487 --> 03:02:54.367]  Well, you know what?
[03:02:54.367 --> 03:02:57.788]  We did some similar research and we have not been able to confirm whether that is the same Richard Culver.
[03:02:57.788 --> 03:03:05.070]  You know, we appreciate everybody out there trying to get as much information together as possible and I even appreciate the call, sir, and the work.
[03:03:05.070 --> 03:03:05.790]  Somebody else has
[03:03:23.315 --> 03:03:46.002]  Showing me another Richard Culver that works for a major media outlet And I don't want to say that major media outlet yet because I'm not sure if this indeed is the same Richard Culver I would just encourage you Lou and others to continue your research Continue your vigilance, and let's find out you know what this Richard Culver character has to do with American police force I thank you so much for the call.
[03:03:46.002 --> 03:03:51.064]  Let's go to Mona in Montana Mona you're on the line Hey, Jason.
[03:03:51.064 --> 03:03:52.144]  How are you all right?
[03:03:53.591 --> 03:03:54.891]  Listen, I'm from Montana.
[03:03:54.891 --> 03:03:56.332]  I've got information for you.
[03:03:56.332 --> 03:03:58.932]  We actually took a trip to Hardin, Montana, two days ago.
[03:03:58.932 --> 03:03:59.712]  Okay.
[03:03:59.712 --> 03:04:02.853]  We're about a six and a half hour drive from where we are.
[03:04:02.853 --> 03:04:04.894]  That's great dedication, ma'am.
[03:04:04.894 --> 03:04:08.254]  And we're politically active here and 24-7.
[03:04:08.254 --> 03:04:21.157]  So, wanted to let you know that we actually went to the City Hall and tried to get copies of the meeting minutes from September 15th from the City Council.
[03:04:21.889 --> 03:04:22.049]  I don't
[03:04:40.822 --> 03:04:52.491]  Hold over Mona, I want to find out what happened, what was in these documents.
[03:04:52.491 --> 03:04:53.872]  We appreciate your vigilance.
[03:04:53.872 --> 03:04:56.554]  We'll be back with Mona, Ryan, Stuart, Michael and more.
[03:04:56.554 --> 03:04:57.615]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:57.615 --> 03:04:58.876]  I am Jason Burma sitting in.
[03:04:58.876 --> 03:05:00.477]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:05:01.755 --> 03:05:04.777]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.777 --> 03:05:10.100]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.100 --> 03:05:12.141]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.141 --> 03:05:17.144]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.144 --> 03:05:18.065]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.325 --> 03:05:19.446]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.446 --> 03:05:21.327]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.327 --> 03:05:22.408]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.408 --> 03:05:24.609]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.609 --> 03:05:25.950]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.950 --> 03:05:27.471]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.471 --> 03:05:32.735]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.735 --> 03:05:36.337]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.337 --> 03:05:39.800]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.140 --> 03:05:41.361]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.361 --> 03:05:42.262]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.262 --> 03:05:43.383]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.383 --> 03:05:44.303]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.303 --> 03:05:45.404]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.404 --> 03:05:48.447]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.447 --> 03:05:50.228]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.228 --> 03:05:51.149]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.805 --> 03:06:06.112]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:06.112 --> 03:06:10.638]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.638 --> 03:06:12.921]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.921 --> 03:06:14.543]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.543 --> 03:06:15.565]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.785 --> 03:06:24.232]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:06:24.232 --> 03:06:31.678]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[03:07:01.533 --> 03:07:03.714]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[03:07:03.714 --> 03:07:04.574]  Spy on me?
[03:07:04.574 --> 03:07:04.894]  Yeah.
[03:07:04.894 --> 03:07:09.936]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[03:07:09.936 --> 03:07:11.556]  You should use Startpage instead.
[03:07:11.556 --> 03:07:12.317]  Startpage?
[03:07:12.317 --> 03:07:12.717]  Yeah.
[03:07:12.717 --> 03:07:13.817]  Startpage.com.
[03:07:13.817 --> 03:07:16.578]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[03:07:16.778 --> 03:07:20.659]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[03:07:20.659 --> 03:07:23.780]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[03:07:23.780 --> 03:07:26.401]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[03:07:26.401 --> 03:07:28.001]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[03:07:28.001 --> 03:07:28.301]  Right!
[03:07:28.301 --> 03:07:31.602]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[03:07:31.602 --> 03:07:33.543]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[03:07:33.543 --> 03:07:37.044]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[03:07:37.384 --> 03:07:41.189]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[03:07:41.189 --> 03:07:46.335]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[03:07:46.335 --> 03:07:49.739]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the big brother habit.
[03:07:49.739 --> 03:07:51.481]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[03:07:51.481 --> 03:07:55.786]  Try StartPage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[03:07:55.786 --> 03:07:57.388]  That's StartPage.com.
[03:08:01.704 --> 03:08:07.134]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:07.134 --> 03:08:09.417]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:11.656 --> 03:08:13.677]  We are back live.
[03:08:13.677 --> 03:08:17.698]  Folks, if you missed any of the program, such an important, informative program.
[03:08:17.698 --> 03:08:20.559]  Alex Jones reporting live from Hardin, Montana.
[03:08:20.559 --> 03:08:22.560]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[03:08:22.560 --> 03:08:25.201]  He's going to be joining us in the last 20 minutes of the program.
[03:08:25.201 --> 03:08:29.182]  We have Peter Dale Scott in studio, a discussion with Bob Chapman.
[03:08:29.182 --> 03:08:37.465]  If you missed any of it, you can get the podcast after the program or the rebroadcast begins at InfoWars.com as soon as the regular show ends.
[03:08:37.825 --> 03:08:45.731]  We're going to continue with the phone calls and we were talking to Mona in Montana who drove six hours with a partner of hers.
[03:08:45.731 --> 03:08:47.812]  They tried to go into the city council meeting.
[03:08:47.812 --> 03:08:48.893]  They tried to get documents.
[03:08:48.893 --> 03:08:51.234]  At first they said, no, you can't have these documents.
[03:08:51.234 --> 03:08:52.836]  He pulled out his state constitution.
[03:08:52.836 --> 03:08:54.477]  You were able to get these documents.
[03:08:54.477 --> 03:08:56.578]  What did they entail?
[03:08:56.578 --> 03:09:04.524]  Well, the documents that we did get are the minutes of the previous meeting from September 15th regarding the economic development
[03:09:06.658 --> 03:09:09.359]  Mona, we need to see what's on these things.
[03:09:09.359 --> 03:09:12.981]  Do you have access to a scanner or a fax machine?
[03:09:28.795 --> 03:09:30.636]  I do.
[03:09:30.636 --> 03:09:31.076]  I do.
[03:09:31.076 --> 03:09:34.778]  Can we hold her over, John, and give her the fax information?
[03:09:34.778 --> 03:09:43.822]  We'll have you fax that out and email the information because it is so vital we see what was actually discussed at these meetings and put on paper.
[03:09:43.822 --> 03:09:46.643]  Just go over a few things for us right now.
[03:09:46.643 --> 03:09:47.443]  Okay.
[03:09:47.443 --> 03:09:50.725]  Let me just give you a couple highlights here.
[03:09:50.725 --> 03:09:55.267]  What I think is important to mention here, it says that, let's see, would that fit?
[03:09:55.683 --> 03:10:02.928]  The Two Rivers Authority, and the contract was signed by officials representing Two Rivers Authority and the American Police Force.
[03:10:02.928 --> 03:10:22.243]  He explained to the crowd that the APF, now he being Al Peterson, who is the Vice President of TRA, consists of retired and ex-police slash military personnel, including ex-SEALs, Rangers, etc., who have been trained and have experience in everything from airline slash cruise ship security to hostage negotiations.
[03:10:22.898 --> 03:10:26.480]  The APF chose Hardin because they are impressed with the community.
[03:10:26.480 --> 03:10:27.080]  Uh-huh.
[03:10:27.080 --> 03:10:31.343]  They have been in Hardin for the last nine months and the community has welcomed them and treated them well.
[03:10:31.343 --> 03:10:48.452]  Okay, in the contract signed, it says the APF will only house low to medium security inmates and only the chief of police, the United States government, Montana Department of Corrections, and the state, local, county, and federal jurisdictions will be allowed to place only properly classified inmates in the facility.
[03:10:49.963 --> 03:10:55.887]  The city will be able to house between 30 to 60 inmates at their detention center.
[03:10:55.887 --> 03:11:02.992]  The APF will also permit the city to use the courtroom and office space for city court at no cost.
[03:11:02.992 --> 03:11:08.896]  The APF are required to maintain all appropriate certifications and insurances necessary and they'll take care of all of that.
[03:11:10.151 --> 03:11:16.613]  Okay, Al stated that the only money APF would be making will be from inmate phone calls and stuff like that.
[03:11:16.613 --> 03:11:18.654]  Oh, please.
[03:11:18.654 --> 03:11:25.736]  They will be paying TRA $5 per inmate per day, as well as all taxes, etc.
[03:11:25.736 --> 03:11:32.319]  APF will pay any deficiency to trust starting February 1st, 2010, regardless of whether they have inmates or not.
[03:11:32.319 --> 03:11:34.920]  They will pay the money to TRA, then TRA will make the payments.
[03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:36.240]  The contract also mentions that
[03:11:36.656 --> 03:11:42.977]  The contract also states that APF will shop in the community first for the things they need before heading out of town.
[03:11:42.977 --> 03:11:45.478]  APF wants to help them become a part of this community
[03:12:06.109 --> 03:12:11.851]  And they're willing to send a police officer with food to the houses of people who are not able to get out and about.
[03:12:11.851 --> 03:12:12.512]  Alright.
[03:12:12.512 --> 03:12:15.553]  They're also willing... Mona, Mona, hold back.
[03:12:15.553 --> 03:12:16.133]  Get a pen.
[03:12:16.133 --> 03:12:18.234]  I'm going to give you the fax number right now.
[03:12:18.234 --> 03:12:19.835]  You tell me when you're ready.
[03:12:19.835 --> 03:12:20.075]  Ready.
[03:12:20.075 --> 03:12:20.755]  Okay, it is 866-894-1767.
[03:12:20.755 --> 03:12:21.255]  Do you have that?
[03:12:21.255 --> 03:12:21.476]  Got it.
[03:12:27.557 --> 03:12:29.538]  Alright Mona, I'm going to let you go.
[03:12:29.538 --> 03:12:34.959]  Yes, please fax that right over and we'll be doing Prison Planet and Info War Stories ASAP.
[03:12:34.959 --> 03:12:37.399]  We're going to get that to Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson.
[03:12:37.399 --> 03:12:39.720]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:12:39.720 --> 03:12:41.340]  Let's go to our next caller.
[03:12:41.340 --> 03:12:43.701]  Let's go to Ryan in Canada.
[03:12:43.701 --> 03:12:45.081]  Ryan, you're on the line.
[03:12:45.081 --> 03:12:46.142]  Hey Jason, how you doing?
[03:12:46.142 --> 03:12:47.242]  Alright.
[03:12:47.242 --> 03:12:48.482]  Awesome, glad to be with you.
[03:12:48.482 --> 03:12:50.883]  I just found some information about two weeks ago.
[03:12:50.883 --> 03:12:53.363]  I thought it might be interesting to call and let you know.
[03:12:53.363 --> 03:12:55.244]  The RCMP in Canada have actually been
[03:12:56.087 --> 03:12:59.231]  This is coming from someone who's a member of the clergy.
[03:12:59.231 --> 03:13:04.698]  The police in Canada have been preparing for a pandemic and apparently they've known about it for a very long time.
[03:13:04.698 --> 03:13:10.486]  They've been going through training, they've had conferences in Ottawa, all about the pandemic and how they're going to handle it.
[03:13:11.459 --> 03:13:14.441]  I mean it's a bit weird don't you think that they're planning everything?
[03:13:14.441 --> 03:13:29.354]  Well you know they've talked about using schools and I mean not even talked about they've said they're going to use schools as mass vaccination centers but they're not going to stop there they figure that community centers and churches are another way to get mass gatherings of people and to take these vaccinations so it doesn't really
[03:13:29.774 --> 03:13:40.147]  Shock me that they would use the clergy as we know about the clergy response teams for a couple of years now that will be working with departments like the Department of Homeland Security here in this country.
[03:13:40.147 --> 03:13:42.810]  So it really isn't a shock to me.
[03:13:42.810 --> 03:13:48.357]  Are they saying that they may use this as a mass vaccination center somewhere where they may offer the vaccine?
[03:13:49.105 --> 03:13:55.849]  I haven't really gotten a whole lot of information on it, but I am still trying to talk to the minister that was involved in this.
[03:13:55.849 --> 03:14:09.398]  Well, you've got to be careful, because a lot of these ministers and a lot of these priests and a lot of these clergymen are now on government payrolls, and they're there to tell you to love the government, do whatever they say, they're here to help, when we know it is the exact opposite.
[03:14:09.398 --> 03:14:11.880]  Keep doing your research and let me know as it develops.
[03:14:11.880 --> 03:14:13.161]  Thank you so much, Ryan.
[03:14:13.161 --> 03:14:15.362]  Let's jump to Stuart in New York.
[03:14:15.362 --> 03:14:17.003]  Stuart, you're on the line.
[03:14:17.003 --> 03:14:18.344]  Pleased to talk with you, Jason.
[03:14:18.812 --> 03:14:40.658]  I'm just wondering, and considering how vicious the Pittsburgh police attack so many innocent people, and in regards to what's going on in Montana with non-citizens, I'm just wondering, they're wearing these Darth Vader suits, not for their own personal protection, physically, but more to disguise their identities.
[03:14:40.658 --> 03:14:45.679]  I'm just wondering, how many of these so-called police were really American citizens?
[03:14:46.110 --> 03:14:49.953]  Well, I would say the majority of them were, in actuality, American citizens.
[03:14:49.953 --> 03:14:56.637]  I didn't see a lot of foreigners out there, but I did see a lot of blurring of the lines, whether or not they were National Guard or not.
[03:14:56.637 --> 03:14:57.498]  Let me give you an example.
[03:14:57.498 --> 03:15:05.804]  The first riot police I saw were wearing regular riot police tops and uniforms, but they were wearing military fatigues on the bottom.
[03:15:05.804 --> 03:15:12.488]  When I went to the big concert out there for Al Gore and global warming, they took it a step further.
[03:15:12.488 --> 03:15:14.370]  They were in full military garb
[03:15:14.950 --> 03:15:15.530]  I don't
[03:15:30.339 --> 03:15:57.163]  uh... admittedly national guard i did not uh... i did see a lot of uh... foreign security forces in other words people in suits acting as secret service type agents in the hotels and downtown area but uh... you know this time they they were able to use american citizens a lot of these national guardsman said you know i'll defend your right to free speech every day while they're in riot gear on the streets uh... shooting tear gas at people and with that with that said we're gonna go to that video
[03:15:57.663 --> 03:16:05.014]  of the uh... young people at the college if we can bring that up by jaron and who's of the the incident at pittsburgh
[03:16:06.022 --> 03:16:22.130]  On Friday night, when these kids are on a balcony, when the cops start shooting off rubber bullets, they start shooting off the tear gas canisters, and they actually go into the building and up the stairs onto this balcony and corner all these kids that are now being tear gassed.
[03:16:22.130 --> 03:16:24.751]  So let's go to that video, then we're going to continue with your calls.
[03:16:24.751 --> 03:16:28.973]  Michael, Scott, Dan, Scott, and Gary right after this.
[03:16:28.973 --> 03:16:30.514]  So let's hit that clip right now.
[03:16:32.148 --> 03:16:32.629]  Oh boy!
[03:16:32.629 --> 03:16:33.690]  This is what America looks like!
[03:16:50.202 --> 03:16:55.125]  And I mean, you're really looking at something like out of a science fiction movie.
[03:16:55.125 --> 03:16:57.726]  All these protesters are mostly college students.
[03:16:57.726 --> 03:16:59.667]  There are no anarchists amongst them.
[03:16:59.667 --> 03:17:01.128]  Not one anarchist.
[03:17:01.128 --> 03:17:02.669]  And there you see the flashes.
[03:17:02.669 --> 03:17:04.750]  There you see the tear gas canisters.
[03:17:04.750 --> 03:17:06.871]  You hear the rubber bullets going off right now.
[03:17:06.871 --> 03:17:08.952]  You're watching it on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:17:08.952 --> 03:17:12.134]  One of the protesters throws one back at them.
[03:17:12.134 --> 03:17:13.134]  But it's a moot point.
[03:17:13.134 --> 03:17:14.555]  They're all wearing gas masks.
[03:17:14.955 --> 03:17:18.319]  Here's where it gets really, really scary.
[03:17:18.319 --> 03:17:20.901]  The kids that are on the balcony, they think they're safe.
[03:17:20.901 --> 03:17:22.343]  They're not.
[03:17:22.343 --> 03:17:26.087]  Tear gas to come up the stairwells.
[03:17:26.087 --> 03:17:27.288]  Yes, they're inside.
[03:17:27.288 --> 03:17:29.230]  Are we trapped here?
[03:17:40.515 --> 03:17:47.423]  And here they are being tear gassed as the riot police pass them up the stairwell and corner them.
[03:17:56.334 --> 03:17:57.335]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:17:57.335 --> 03:18:07.425]  We're going to pull the clip because there is some obscenities that come up later on that we have not edited out, but the full clip is available at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:18:07.425 --> 03:18:17.454]  And a young girl, I don't know whether or not she gets pulled, she gets hit by a rubber bullet, but she gets hit by something and her neck begins to bleed up by her ear.
[03:18:18.275 --> 03:18:19.878]  This is just unbelievable.
[03:18:19.878 --> 03:18:24.063]  This is, again folks, the new America.
[03:18:24.063 --> 03:18:25.625]  The new tyranny.
[03:18:25.625 --> 03:18:31.153]  Jackboot thugs ruling over us, stopping us from assembling peaceably.
[03:18:32.708 --> 03:18:36.149]  The founding fathers would be rolling over in their graves.
[03:18:36.149 --> 03:18:36.689]  You know what?
[03:18:36.689 --> 03:18:38.730]  They wouldn't be rolling over in their graves.
[03:18:38.730 --> 03:18:43.212]  They would be getting their muskets and saying, that's enough.
[03:18:43.212 --> 03:18:44.092]  We've had it.
[03:18:44.092 --> 03:18:50.254]  These people stood up for taxation without representation because they were being taxed too much by the king.
[03:18:50.254 --> 03:18:54.756]  Do you think we're being taxed too much when they start to say, yeah, you know, a carbon tax is a good idea?
[03:18:55.456 --> 03:18:58.517]  Yeah, one-child policies are a good idea.
[03:18:58.517 --> 03:19:05.200]  Salon.com publishing articles saying that contraception curbs global warming.
[03:19:05.200 --> 03:19:09.541]  Basically telling you don't have children or you're screwing the planet.
[03:19:09.541 --> 03:19:11.202]  That's what we're here for.
[03:19:11.202 --> 03:19:12.962]  We're here to procreate.
[03:19:12.962 --> 03:19:15.263]  We're here to expand our family.
[03:19:15.263 --> 03:19:16.844]  We're here to love one another.
[03:19:16.844 --> 03:19:19.585]  We're not here to say, no, you can't have children.
[03:19:20.689 --> 03:19:22.511]  No, you can't have a family.
[03:19:22.511 --> 03:19:25.395]  Yes, the state is your god.
[03:19:25.395 --> 03:19:26.897]  Big Brother loves you.
[03:19:26.897 --> 03:19:28.278]  That's not why we're here.
[03:19:28.278 --> 03:19:32.584]  We're here to flourish as humanity.
[03:19:32.584 --> 03:19:38.691]  Not to stop one another from experiencing life, from experiencing love.
[03:19:39.755 --> 03:19:44.538]  From being in fear all the time, so we start sucking our thumbs in a fetal position.
[03:19:44.538 --> 03:19:46.519]  Letting the state walk all over us.
[03:19:46.519 --> 03:19:49.441]  Letting the establishment have their way with us.
[03:19:49.441 --> 03:19:52.443]  We're going to come back with more calls Alex Jones coming up.
[03:19:52.443 --> 03:19:53.724]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:53.724 --> 03:19:56.846]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in PrisonPlanet.tv and FoeWars.com.
[03:20:03.228 --> 03:20:05.229]  Remain in your houses.
[03:20:05.229 --> 03:20:10.992]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:20:10.992 --> 03:20:12.353]  Will they do it?
[03:20:12.353 --> 03:20:14.975]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:20:14.975 --> 03:20:20.918]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:20:21.434 --> 03:20:23.616]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:20:23.616 --> 03:20:27.919]  Executive Order 10-9-90 locks down all highways.
[03:20:27.919 --> 03:20:32.783]  Executive Order 10-9-95 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:20:32.783 --> 03:20:37.707]  Executive Order 10-9-98 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:20:37.707 --> 03:20:42.531]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:20:43.431 --> 03:20:51.862]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:20:51.862 --> 03:20:54.366]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:20:54.366 --> 03:20:57.430]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:20:57.430 --> 03:21:00.354]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:21:01.482 --> 03:21:03.643]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:21:03.643 --> 03:21:06.064]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:21:06.064 --> 03:21:08.705]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:21:08.705 --> 03:21:09.865]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:21:09.865 --> 03:21:11.606]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:21:11.606 --> 03:21:14.487]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:21:14.487 --> 03:21:18.729]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:21:18.729 --> 03:21:19.849]  Do you listen to us?
[03:21:27.772 --> 03:21:32.680]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:21:36.457 --> 03:21:40.521]  How dare you?
[03:21:40.521 --> 03:21:43.964]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:21:43.964 --> 03:21:46.647]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:21:46.647 --> 03:21:53.053]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[03:21:53.053 --> 03:21:56.156]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[03:21:56.156 --> 03:21:58.418]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:21:58.418 --> 03:22:00.921]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:22:02.233 --> 03:22:03.253]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:22:03.253 --> 03:22:08.795]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:22:08.795 --> 03:22:09.335]  I get it.
[03:22:09.335 --> 03:22:18.959]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:22:18.959 --> 03:22:20.099]  That's not what's happening.
[03:22:20.359 --> 03:22:28.825]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:22:28.825 --> 03:22:32.227]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:22:32.227 --> 03:22:36.490]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:22:36.490 --> 03:22:38.091]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:22:38.091 --> 03:22:42.054]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[03:22:42.054 --> 03:22:45.656]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:22:45.856 --> 03:22:46.757]  You should too.
[03:22:46.757 --> 03:22:47.899]  Find out what they know.
[03:22:47.899 --> 03:22:51.223]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:22:51.223 --> 03:22:51.283]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.283 --> 03:22:51.623]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.623 --> 03:22:51.804]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.929 --> 03:23:03.510]  Are you constantly tired?
[03:23:03.510 --> 03:23:05.371]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[03:23:05.371 --> 03:23:08.653]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[03:23:08.653 --> 03:23:11.674]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.

[03:23:22.960 --> 03:23:31.225]  Studies show that Liquid Zeolite captures triggering antigens which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.

[03:24:06.347 --> 03:24:08.756]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:24:08.756 --> 03:24:11.506]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:24:17.799 --> 03:24:19.080]  We are back live.
[03:24:19.080 --> 03:24:19.801]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:19.801 --> 03:24:21.482]  We're going to continue to take your calls.
[03:24:21.482 --> 03:24:22.883]  Alex calling in shortly.
[03:24:22.883 --> 03:24:27.888]  But for PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers, I want to play this video.
[03:24:27.888 --> 03:24:35.514]  The local KULR station now reporting, yeah, you know, he's got 17 aliases.
[03:24:35.514 --> 03:24:39.998]  Yeah, he spent some time in a California state correctional facility.
[03:24:39.998 --> 03:24:40.479]  Yeah.
[03:24:40.859 --> 03:24:49.085]  He's lost some civil suits of over a million dollars that he hasn't paid, but he also has a current outstanding warrant in Wyoming.
[03:24:49.085 --> 03:24:51.167]  He's a wanted criminal!
[03:24:51.167 --> 03:24:59.093]  And again, the elite and the establishment love criminals who don't care about the American people.
[03:24:59.093 --> 03:25:02.936]  They're not under our jurisdiction of we the people.
[03:25:02.936 --> 03:25:04.658]  So let's go to this video.
[03:25:04.658 --> 03:25:06.239]  PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[03:25:06.527 --> 03:25:10.789]  Launched an investigation into a California company's plan to take over the Hardin Jail.
[03:25:10.789 --> 03:25:16.792]  The probe came one day after the criminal past of American police force leader Michael Hilton is revealed.
[03:25:16.792 --> 03:25:22.675]  Yesterday, concerned Montana citizens showed up at the Hardin Jail, joining officials in the quest for answers.
[03:25:22.675 --> 03:25:25.336]  Colorado's Nick Law went to Hardin and has the details.
[03:25:29.235 --> 03:25:36.997]  Tony Myers drove from Columbus, Montana in search of answers in the ongoing story between the Hardin Jail and American police force.
[03:25:36.997 --> 03:25:41.519]  I just want to know who they are, why they're coming here, who they're bringing in.
[03:25:41.519 --> 03:25:44.520]  My job is not to give you the answers that you want.
[03:25:44.520 --> 03:25:51.122]  My job is to give you the information that I have been employed to release or not release.
[03:25:51.122 --> 03:25:57.764]  Caught in the crossfire is APF spokesperson Becky Shea, who spent all day answering questions from media members and the public.
[03:25:58.191 --> 03:26:06.236]  After an AP story linked the security firm's leader, Michael Hilton, to multiple bankruptcies and convictions for more than a dozen felonies.
[03:26:06.236 --> 03:26:07.777]  There were no surprises.
[03:26:07.777 --> 03:26:14.421]  Michael disclosed this information to me before I agreed to come to work for him.
[03:26:14.421 --> 03:26:22.887]  Shea and TRA Vice President Al Peterson both say they knew about the convictions long before the report came out, but are still confident in APF.
[03:26:22.887 --> 03:26:27.630]  I firmly believe APF is legitimate and a solid corporation.
[03:26:28.029 --> 03:26:40.215]  Peterson declined an on-camera interview but released this statement saying, quote, I believe that the TRA has a better chance of getting the detention facility open with APF than with any Montana officials.
[03:26:40.215 --> 03:26:42.777]  What do we have to lose if it doesn't work out?
[03:26:42.777 --> 03:26:43.697]  End quote.
[03:26:43.697 --> 03:26:48.540]  APF also continues to stand firm on its stance to not release the parent company.
[03:26:48.540 --> 03:26:51.821]  That information won't be disclosed.
[03:26:51.821 --> 03:26:54.923]  But Myers and others like her pledge to continue their research.
[03:26:55.564 --> 03:26:59.112]  They're putting in a criminal to watch criminals?
[03:26:59.112 --> 03:27:02.479]  And try to get to the bottom of the mystery behind the Hardin Jail.
[03:27:02.479 --> 03:27:05.746]  Reporting in Hardin, Nick Law, Color 8 News.
[03:27:06.584 --> 03:27:08.825]  Calls to Michael Hilton were not returned.
[03:27:08.825 --> 03:27:16.869]  APF spokesperson Becky Shea says Hilton is currently in California on business and is expected back in Hardin in the next couple of weeks.
[03:27:16.869 --> 03:27:27.635]  Well, court records from Orange County, California indicate Michael Hilton has a lengthy criminal past, including a six-year prison sentence for a dozen counts of grand theft and other charges.
[03:27:27.635 --> 03:27:32.778]  Court documents show more than a decade of courtroom appearances for Hilton, starting in 1982 through 1999 on charges
[03:27:35.399 --> 03:27:39.682]  Including bad checks, fraud, breach of contract, and grand theft.
[03:27:39.682 --> 03:27:47.546]  After his release from prison, court documents indicate he was entangled in at least three civil lawsuits alleging fraud or misrepresentation.
[03:27:47.546 --> 03:27:52.129]  And we learned just yesterday there's a warrant out for Hilton's arrest in Wyoming.
[03:27:52.129 --> 03:27:56.372]  A Sheridan County, Wyoming circuit court judge issued a warrant September 1st.
[03:27:57.082 --> 03:28:04.006]  A court clerk says he was ticketed for driving with a suspended driver's license on Interstate 90 in Sheridan County on August 15th.
[03:28:04.006 --> 03:28:09.310]  The arrest warrant was issued after he failed to appear in court.
[03:28:09.310 --> 03:28:11.031]  All right, let's continue with the callers.
[03:28:11.031 --> 03:28:12.972]  Let's go to Michael in Texas.
[03:28:12.972 --> 03:28:15.053]  Michael, you're on the line.
[03:28:15.053 --> 03:28:15.794]  Yeah, Burmese.
[03:28:15.794 --> 03:28:18.215]  This is Mike Moore calling from Wichita Falls, Texas.
[03:28:18.215 --> 03:28:19.296]  How you doing today?
[03:28:19.296 --> 03:28:20.757]  All right.
[03:28:20.757 --> 03:28:25.400]  Hey, there's one thing that I'm talking about this Montana story as it develops that
[03:28:26.241 --> 03:28:32.964]  Uh, came to mind, I used to hold a security officer license here in Texas for about four years.
[03:28:32.964 --> 03:28:49.771]  And, I've been going through the, uh, Montana, it's mt.gov website, in order to find the, uh, Montana Board of Private Security, to find out if there's even a current license for this American Police Force, which, so far to my search, I haven't found one.
[03:28:50.233 --> 03:28:57.042]  Well, you know, that'll tie into a story by Felix Barber over at PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:28:57.042 --> 03:28:58.984]  The headline is, APF License?
[03:28:58.984 --> 03:29:00.506]  We don't need no stinking license.
[03:29:00.506 --> 03:29:08.617]  When the scene started to unfold in Hardin, Montana, my first reaction could be best described as an overwhelming feeling of despair, the thought that our worst fears were coming true.
[03:29:08.977 --> 03:29:10.418]  So it doesn't appear that they do have a license.
[03:29:10.418 --> 03:29:11.979]  We're going to continue with your calls.
[03:29:11.979 --> 03:29:13.901]  We're going to go to Scott, Dan, Gary, Chris, and more.
[03:29:13.901 --> 03:29:15.182]  Alex Jones coming up after this segment.
[03:29:38.097 --> 03:29:39.177]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:39.177 --> 03:29:43.819]  Remember, pre-order Ball of the Republic right now to be the first to receive it.

[03:29:51.923 --> 03:29:53.204]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.204 --> 03:29:55.745]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.745 --> 03:29:58.406]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.186 --> 03:30:05.430]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.430 --> 03:30:07.432]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.432 --> 03:30:15.961]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.961 --> 03:30:21.526]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.526 --> 03:30:23.128]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.368 --> 03:30:29.871]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.871 --> 03:30:40.936]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.936 --> 03:30:41.396]  That's right.
[03:30:41.696 --> 03:30:44.258]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[03:31:02.045 --> 03:31:04.047]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[03:31:04.047 --> 03:31:07.672]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:31:07.672 --> 03:31:10.134]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:31:10.134 --> 03:31:13.198]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:31:13.198 --> 03:31:15.060]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[03:31:15.521 --> 03:31:16.142]  We're good to go.
[03:31:35.765 --> 03:31:38.807]  Directly to your computer or iPhone and share it with others.
[03:31:38.807 --> 03:31:44.810]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[03:31:44.810 --> 03:31:49.672]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[03:31:49.672 --> 03:31:52.534]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[03:31:52.534 --> 03:31:54.615]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:54.615 --> 03:31:56.616]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[03:31:56.616 --> 03:31:58.757]  Put them on the file sharing networks.

[03:32:00.558 --> 03:32:01.319]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:32:02.998 --> 03:32:08.160]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[03:32:08.160 --> 03:32:11.661]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:32:11.661 --> 03:32:17.383]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:32:17.383 --> 03:32:19.944]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:32:19.944 --> 03:32:24.485]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:32:24.485 --> 03:32:27.206]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:32:27.666 --> 03:32:33.393]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:32:33.393 --> 03:32:35.636]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:32:35.636 --> 03:32:44.206]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:32:44.206 --> 03:32:45.207]  Don't pick your nose.
[03:32:45.567 --> 03:32:50.151]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:32:50.151 --> 03:32:55.256]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:32:55.256 --> 03:32:57.018]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[03:32:57.018 --> 03:32:59.220]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:32:59.220 --> 03:33:00.701]  Be well and stay well.
[03:33:22.082 --> 03:33:22.762]  We are back.
[03:33:22.762 --> 03:33:23.922]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.922 --> 03:33:25.263]  I am Jason Burmas sitting in.
[03:33:25.263 --> 03:33:26.863]  Alex joining us momentarily.
[03:33:26.863 --> 03:33:30.344]  We're going to continue with your calls in just a moment.
[03:33:30.344 --> 03:33:33.804]  But I want to read more of this article that the caller just brought up.
[03:33:33.804 --> 03:33:34.785]  APF license.
[03:33:34.785 --> 03:33:38.125]  We don't need no stinking license as you read into it.
[03:33:38.125 --> 03:33:40.686]  American Police Force is a California corporation.
[03:33:40.686 --> 03:33:45.547]  In order to advertise for investigative services in the state of California, one must be licensed.
[03:33:46.147 --> 03:33:51.088]  And the licenses must advertise using the name that the license is issued under.
[03:33:51.088 --> 03:34:01.952]  I went to the website of B-S-I-S dot C-A dot gov slash online services slash verify licenses S-H-T-M-L.
[03:34:01.952 --> 03:34:07.773]  This is the website for the California Department of Consumer Affairs Bureau of Security and Investigative Services.
[03:34:07.773 --> 03:34:11.554]  They have a database that anyone can use to verify a license.
[03:34:11.554 --> 03:34:13.095]  You simply put in the name of the company.
[03:34:14.227 --> 03:34:17.708]  And under it, it will tell you whether that firm is licensed or not.
[03:34:17.708 --> 03:34:20.449]  As I suspected, no matches were found.
[03:34:20.449 --> 03:34:28.793]  They are not licensed to operate as a private investigator, nor as a security operator required to provide bodyguard services.
[03:34:28.793 --> 03:34:37.156]  I knew this would be the case going in because the state of California will not issue a license to a company that has the word police as part of its company name.
[03:34:37.156 --> 03:34:42.618]  But remember, this is under some other umbrella corporation that has remained secret as of this point.
[03:34:43.098 --> 03:34:43.338]  Yes, sir.
[03:35:00.973 --> 03:35:02.094]  Yes.
[03:35:02.094 --> 03:35:04.117]  This is about Hilton there.
[03:35:04.117 --> 03:35:11.746]  I went to this website, I surf around a lot, and it's whatdoesitmean.com.
[03:35:11.746 --> 03:35:13.127]  I've been there before, of course.
[03:35:13.127 --> 03:35:17.453]  It's under an article named Obama in Secret Russia.
[03:35:18.214 --> 03:35:26.136]  Visit warns Putin I may not make it about a third of the way, about three quarters of the way down, okay?
[03:35:26.136 --> 03:35:36.259]  It goes into an American police force company, which is owned by one of the most brutal fascist warlords of the former nation of Yugoslavia, named Madrid.
[03:35:41.653 --> 03:35:48.875]  So they're telling you that this guy, one of his aliases, is this alias that you're saying, and that he is just a brutal military dictator?
[03:35:48.875 --> 03:35:50.615]  Yeah, and then it goes on.
[03:35:50.615 --> 03:36:04.098]  Who, when brought to the United States by the CIA, in parenthesis, who backed his brutal troops in the destruction of the Balkan Genocide Wars, changed his name to Michael Anthony Hilton.
[03:36:05.230 --> 03:36:07.733]  Well that's incredible.
[03:36:07.733 --> 03:36:10.936]  Is there a source article or is this just up on that website?
[03:36:10.936 --> 03:36:15.641]  I mean, did they pull this from some kind of an Associated Press or other mainline article?
[03:36:15.641 --> 03:36:16.261]  I'm not sure.
[03:36:16.261 --> 03:36:17.442]  I'm trying to get into that.
[03:36:17.442 --> 03:36:17.763]  It's been...
[03:36:18.254 --> 03:36:19.635]  Well let me tell you how you do it.
[03:36:19.635 --> 03:36:23.279]  What you do is you take a section of the article, a few sentences, alright?
[03:36:23.279 --> 03:36:33.369]  You copy that and then you paste it into Google and then all articles that have republished it or initially published it will come up so you can kind of see where the sources are.
[03:36:33.369 --> 03:36:37.934]  We would appreciate it if you took that link and you sent it over to articles at infowars.com
[03:36:38.154 --> 03:36:38.895]  We're good to go.
[03:37:00.179 --> 03:37:13.022]  It says, uh, imagine a bloodless coup, uh, to restore the defense and defend the Constitution through an intern administration that would do serious business of governing and defending the nation.
[03:37:13.022 --> 03:37:20.364]  Skilled military-trained nation builders would replace accountability-challenged radical left commissioners.
[03:37:20.364 --> 03:37:27.086]  Having bonded with their twin teleprompters, the President would be detailed for ceremonial speech-making.
[03:37:28.117 --> 03:37:41.245]  Well it is creepy stuff and I just hope that you can get that article to us as soon as possible and all the info warriors out there can check it out and either verify or disprove this but you know the way things are going it looks like we're going to be able to verify this.
[03:37:41.245 --> 03:37:55.895]  This guy has all the markings of this type of a dictator, this type of a strongman, someone that the CIA would back and you know he admittedly said that his boss was an ex-army colonel named Richard Culver and this was at the point
[03:37:56.175 --> 03:38:00.979]  When he was just calling himself Captain Michael and not giving out his last name.
[03:38:00.979 --> 03:38:05.684]  And again, under the very deceptive name of American Police Force.
[03:38:05.684 --> 03:38:11.129]  It's not American, it's not a police force, it's not even a licensed security firm.
[03:38:11.129 --> 03:38:15.132]  According to this article and according to the California State Board website.
[03:38:15.132 --> 03:38:16.614]  I thank you for the call, Dan.
[03:38:16.614 --> 03:38:19.016]  Let's jump to Gary in Massachusetts.
[03:38:19.016 --> 03:38:20.617]  Gary, you're on the line.
[03:38:20.617 --> 03:38:22.219]  Hey Jason, how you doing today?
[03:38:22.219 --> 03:38:22.539]  Alright.
[03:38:23.462 --> 03:38:28.186]  Listen, this is really important, and I just made a couple tiny URLs for you.
[03:38:28.186 --> 03:38:33.229]  And for the listeners, tinyurl.com forward slash fluinserts.
[03:38:33.229 --> 03:38:41.215]  You would not believe what's in all the normal, and I say normal, not swine flu injections, and in particular, Flumist.
[03:38:41.215 --> 03:38:43.057]  Have you checked out the ingredients?
[03:38:43.057 --> 03:38:50.442]  Well, we've actually posted some of those scans that people have sent in, and it admittedly has thimerosal formaldehyde and squalene in it.
[03:38:50.442 --> 03:38:50.662]  And, and,
[03:38:52.370 --> 03:38:55.691]  H1N1 in every single normal flu shot!
[03:38:55.691 --> 03:38:57.431]  That is huge!
[03:38:57.431 --> 03:38:59.012]  That is huge!
[03:38:59.012 --> 03:39:04.653]  It actually says this on the inserts that H1N1 is included in the shot.
[03:39:04.653 --> 03:39:18.117]  Go to FDA.gov and just type in flu insert and look at every single flu manufacturer's insert from Flumist to Fluzine to Fluzone to you name it
[03:39:18.692 --> 03:39:21.433]  Normal flu shots and especially Flumist.
[03:39:21.433 --> 03:39:26.255]  Now when questioned at a public school, I said to the principal, what are you doing?
[03:39:26.255 --> 03:39:28.716]  You ought to tell the parents it has it in it.
[03:39:28.716 --> 03:39:30.596]  Oh, we'll just switch to Flumist.
[03:39:30.596 --> 03:39:37.199]  Do you know, Jason, that Flumist spreads whatever's in it after people sneeze for up to 20 days?
[03:39:39.537 --> 03:39:47.685]  Well, it's not a shock, and that would explain why they're really pushing this new nasal spray as the alternate to the actual vaccination.
[03:39:47.685 --> 03:39:49.487]  Oh, we'll vaccinate you with a nasal spray.
[03:39:49.487 --> 03:39:50.849]  You don't want to take the shot?
[03:39:50.849 --> 03:39:52.610]  We'll just right up your nose.
[03:39:52.610 --> 03:39:54.773]  And Fox News is promoting it heavily.
[03:39:54.773 --> 03:40:00.118]  They're trying to scare pregnant women into taking this by saying one in three of pregnant women who have contracted H1N1 die.
[03:40:02.040 --> 03:40:05.362]  You are going to poison your unborn child if you take this stuff.
[03:40:05.362 --> 03:40:11.825]  Gary, I need you to send these scans over to Articles at InfoWars, Writers at InfoWars, or if you can fax them to us.
[03:40:11.825 --> 03:40:14.046]  Let me see if I have the fax number in front of me still.
[03:40:14.046 --> 03:40:15.067]  I think I do.
[03:40:15.067 --> 03:40:20.529]  The fax number to InfoWars is 866-894-1767.
[03:40:20.529 --> 03:40:21.630]  Do so immediately.
[03:40:21.630 --> 03:40:22.650]  We appreciate you.
[03:40:22.650 --> 03:40:24.171]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:40:24.171 --> 03:40:25.972]  Let's go to Chris in Kentucky.
[03:40:25.972 --> 03:40:28.053]  Chris, you're on the line.
[03:40:28.053 --> 03:40:28.934]  Hey, Jayce.
[03:40:28.934 --> 03:40:29.414]  Yes.
[03:40:29.414 --> 03:40:31.435]  I just wanted to report on a
[03:40:32.040 --> 03:40:34.402]  Associated Press article out of Frankfort.
[03:40:34.402 --> 03:40:35.682]  Okay.
[03:40:35.682 --> 03:40:40.265]  It says, Marine training exercise disturbs Kentucky neighborhood.
[03:40:40.265 --> 03:40:47.250]  Some Central Kentucky residents say military training exercises damage their property.
[03:40:47.250 --> 03:40:54.134]  Frankfort resident, Tim Evans, said the flying aircraft might be voluntary.
[03:40:56.607 --> 03:40:58.868]  You're breaking up Chris, Chris, Chris, you're breaking up.
[03:40:58.868 --> 03:41:00.669]  Can you repeat that last part for you?
[03:41:00.669 --> 03:41:06.151]  What kind of residential property damage have we seen and what kind of exercise is this?
[03:41:06.151 --> 03:41:09.872]  Okay, well first, what kind of exercise?
[03:41:09.872 --> 03:41:18.896]  Captain Robert Schuffer, spokesman for the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, said the unit was doing an urban training exercise and didn't mean to disturb
[03:41:19.187 --> 03:41:20.908]  Chris, Chris, I've got Alex on the line.
[03:41:20.908 --> 03:41:25.951]  I'm going to need you to send that information to articles at InfoWars or writers at InfoWars.com.
[03:41:25.951 --> 03:41:30.454]  Alex on the ground in Montana right now, in Hardin.
[03:41:30.454 --> 03:41:32.455]  Alex.
[03:41:32.455 --> 03:41:35.337]  Jason, you know, I'm fine if that caller's still there.
[03:41:35.337 --> 03:41:36.577]  I want to hear that about the Marines.
[03:41:36.577 --> 03:41:40.960]  They're doing drills in Tennessee, Kentucky, all over the country.
[03:41:40.960 --> 03:41:43.181]  I noticed they're doing these drills that didn't go live.
[03:41:43.181 --> 03:41:46.643]  And they do this on purpose to condition the public.
[03:41:46.643 --> 03:41:47.724]  Is the caller still there?
[03:41:48.528 --> 03:41:50.469]  I'm not sure if he's still... Yes, he is.
[03:41:50.469 --> 03:41:51.210]  Go ahead, Collin.
[03:41:51.210 --> 03:41:52.130]  You go ahead, sir.
[03:41:52.130 --> 03:41:54.171]  Take three minutes, finish your story, then I'll come back.
[03:41:54.171 --> 03:41:55.432]  Go ahead.
[03:41:55.432 --> 03:42:08.298]  Okay, I just... It says that the low-flying aircraft, I presume a helicopter, knocked over a picnic table and chairs and damaged his wood fence and tossed his daughter's playset across the yard.
[03:42:08.298 --> 03:42:15.022]  His neighbor, Jonda Hopper, says her phone cable lines were knocked down and tree limbs were tossed into her yard.
[03:42:16.245 --> 03:42:20.555]  What's the headline on this article, Chris, so we can get this up at InfoWars.com?
[03:42:20.555 --> 03:42:24.445]  It says, Marine Training Exercise Disturbs Kentucky Neighborhood.
[03:42:24.855 --> 03:42:26.576]  Alright, we are on it.
[03:42:26.576 --> 03:42:45.009]  Alex, we also got a caller in, and we can't confirm this yet, that this Michael Hilden character is actually out of Yugoslavia, ran, you know, death squad type military units out there, and was moved here by the CIA and given the name Michael Hilden.
[03:42:45.009 --> 03:42:47.110]  We're developing that story as we speak.
[03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:48.111]  Just incredible stuff.
[03:42:50.563 --> 03:42:54.466]  Well, again, that's the problem, is that he does have a lot of funds.
[03:42:54.466 --> 03:42:55.266]  Millions.
[03:42:55.266 --> 03:42:57.428]  And he has been here making some of the payments.
[03:42:57.428 --> 03:43:01.811]  The news is saying he's got another big payment to make in February.
[03:43:01.811 --> 03:43:03.913]  And he has been spreading a lot of money around town.
[03:43:03.913 --> 03:43:05.714]  I've been talking to the people.
[03:43:05.714 --> 03:43:17.843]  And then you look at his M.O., it's $100,000 thefts, $200,000 thefts, civil victories against him in court as well, for a million, too.
[03:43:21.573 --> 03:43:33.497]  Again, we're just investigating all of this, trying to find out exactly what's happening and exactly what's going on here, but I want to give you an update on that in just a moment.
[03:43:33.497 --> 03:43:50.142]  First off, going back to what the gentleman said, before I left town, I noticed urban warfare drills all over the country, namely Tennessee, Kentucky, and others, with the Army, with the Marines, and I talked to Thomas Sanchez back in 99, the head of emergency management in Kingsville, Texas,
[03:43:50.908 --> 03:43:57.653]  And they admitted to him that this was being done to condition the public.
[03:43:57.653 --> 03:44:00.615]  They admitted to him that this was basically acclimation for occupation.
[03:44:00.615 --> 03:44:04.558]  Now, that's not even debatable.
[03:44:04.558 --> 03:44:09.302]  They're coming out and just putting regular National Guard, Army, Marines on the streets.
[03:44:09.302 --> 03:44:13.845]  And so it's this slow, incremental unfolding of this agenda.
[03:44:13.845 --> 03:44:20.170]  But now, here at the end, it's all intersecting and getting sped up, kind of like birthing pains with a woman.
[03:44:21.326 --> 03:44:33.135]  You know, as she gets down to delivering the baby, as she goes through labor for 12 hours, the last 30 minutes, the contractions are closer and closer until it's all just one big contraction.
[03:44:33.135 --> 03:44:36.618]  And that's why we see all the different activities just exploding.
[03:44:36.618 --> 03:44:41.222]  The bottom line here from Hardin, Montana, is I'm very glad I came here.
[03:44:41.222 --> 03:44:46.166]  Because more and more on the air I talk about this being like a Twilight Zone episode.
[03:44:46.166 --> 03:44:48.108]  You get to this very poor town,
[03:44:48.715 --> 03:44:51.676]  Ordering the Crow Indian Reservation.
[03:44:51.676 --> 03:45:05.679]  There are Native Americans, like, right out of a stereotype, just completely drunk, walking around all over the streets, bumping into walls, falling down.
[03:45:05.679 --> 03:45:17.002]  Other Native Americans, nice-looking, happy families out, taking their family to eat and things, but there's homeless, old, white people begging for money on the sides of the street.
[03:45:18.506 --> 03:45:28.511]  Uh, but there's also, you know, cheery, nice, you know, folks here as well, both, uh, both, uh, non-native and, uh, folks from Montana, Montana.
[03:45:28.511 --> 03:45:33.713]  And in the middle of it, you have this, this individual who's got a rap sheet the size of a New York phone book.
[03:45:33.713 --> 03:45:40.776]  I mean, every day, every few hours, new warrants in different states and new civil judgments and new felonies.
[03:45:40.776 --> 03:45:42.777]  And as you said, I saw that number 17 aliases.
[03:45:45.225 --> 03:45:47.606]  He is hooked into the government at certain levels.
[03:45:47.606 --> 03:45:52.428]  Now, the question is, the government's full of criminals, con artists, scammers.
[03:45:52.428 --> 03:45:55.449]  Was he just taken in because he was a fellow traveler?
[03:45:55.449 --> 03:45:58.570]  Or has he gone out and conned the U.S.
[03:45:58.570 --> 03:46:02.171]  government, other contractors, other groups?
[03:46:02.171 --> 03:46:04.492]  He's such a liar that we really don't know.
[03:46:04.492 --> 03:46:11.594]  It may just be that he's a complete con artist who was able to get a $27 million facility and have German mercenaries in tow.
[03:46:11.594 --> 03:46:12.815]  We've confirmed that's going on.
[03:46:14.096 --> 03:46:18.998]  And other Croatian and Serb people in tow with him.
[03:46:18.998 --> 03:46:21.699]  Or it could be this is something much bigger and much deeper.
[03:46:21.699 --> 03:46:41.046]  The reason it may actually be, he may just be a front man, is if you look at it, they did a year ago, they're singing in pieces on this, I've talked to the locals, try to turn the prison into a Guantanamo West, as it was called,
[03:46:41.847 --> 03:46:45.149]  Uh, to hold prisoners from Guantanamo Bay.
[03:46:45.149 --> 03:46:47.631]  And this other company does have offices.
[03:46:47.631 --> 03:46:50.553]  I saw their computers and phones and equipment in there.
[03:46:50.553 --> 03:46:54.676]  There's another company that they said, well, they partially pulled out, but they're still here with us.
[03:46:54.676 --> 03:46:56.577]  I got different stories.
[03:46:56.577 --> 03:47:03.081]  And they were saying, we still may make this a, uh, you know, alien detainee center, enemy combatant center.
[03:47:03.081 --> 03:47:07.985]  And then I went into different offices and saw different blueprints and maps on the walls.
[03:47:07.985 --> 03:47:09.866]  Uh, the spokeswoman didn't want me to take that.
[03:47:09.866 --> 03:47:11.447]  It's on paper saying, please don't take that.
[03:47:12.578 --> 03:47:15.259]  And, uh, very, very suspiciously.
[03:47:15.259 --> 03:47:22.601]  So we do have a site, a FEMA camp, a center that the feds and the locals and others have.
[03:47:22.601 --> 03:47:34.924]  The feds tried to, were involved a year ago, tried to sell this to the state, but the legislature, the people in Helena and in Billings, the major cities, said, we do not want this.
[03:47:34.924 --> 03:47:38.505]  And so it looks like they tried to come back through another organization
[03:47:39.184 --> 03:47:43.667]  To try to push it, is that what they said was going to be an international training center for foreign troops?
[03:47:43.667 --> 03:47:49.392]  And we have confirmed, it is now in the Billings Gazette today.
[03:47:49.392 --> 03:47:57.478]  In fact, I just came out of one of the city offices and just had the new Billings Gazette article.
[03:47:57.478 --> 03:48:00.500]  In fact, it's behind me here, and it's about to give it to me.
[03:48:00.500 --> 03:48:06.445]  And it does confirm, if we're going to, I'm on the air, if we need to get in, if we're going to do that.
[03:48:06.445 --> 03:48:06.705]  Thanks.
[03:48:09.415 --> 03:48:36.831]  The Billings Gazette today confirms that without authorization, the Two Rivers Authority, this private consortium that's basically taking over the town, it has its officials running for mayor, it has its officials and their officials' wives in the city council, and it's kind of like their own little boss hog type constabulary, or I guess you'd call it good ol' boy mafia around here, kind of.
[03:48:37.287 --> 03:48:40.608]  Feeding on the locals that don't really know their rights.
[03:48:40.608 --> 03:49:00.295]  And it's confirmed in the Billings Gazette, and they've now admitted, yes, the True Rivers was preparing to go before the City Council and they had gone ahead and gone into talks to make this Captain Michael Hilton and all his other aliases the police chief.
[03:49:00.295 --> 03:49:06.717]  And so literally, they were going to go out into the county and arrest people for different petty offenses.
[03:49:07.310 --> 03:49:10.811]  And bring them back to the jail and make profits off of that.
[03:49:10.811 --> 03:49:13.451]  So a felon con artist.
[03:49:13.451 --> 03:49:14.351]  And I've talked to locals.
[03:49:14.351 --> 03:49:24.613]  He walked around everywhere in his hardened police force, American police force, on one side it had a hardened police force, on the other it said American police force.
[03:49:24.613 --> 03:49:29.434]  And he was strutting around for weeks with his security man announcing that he was the police chief.
[03:49:29.434 --> 03:49:33.335]  Everyone was just groveling to him because he was foreign, had a foreign accent.
[03:49:33.335 --> 03:49:35.455]  They thought that was James Bondition.
[03:49:35.455 --> 03:49:35.935]  Sexy.
[03:49:36.687 --> 03:49:42.732]  And he literally just strutted around smoking cigarettes with everyone bowing and hiding and worshipping him.
[03:49:42.732 --> 03:49:45.574]  And then they were preparing to just dispatch.
[03:49:45.574 --> 03:49:48.977]  And it turns out that the big Oren County Sheriff was for this.
[03:49:48.977 --> 03:49:51.819]  His name is... What's his first name?
[03:49:51.819 --> 03:49:53.921]  Lawrence Big Hair.
[03:49:53.921 --> 03:49:56.443]  They can't make this up.
[03:49:56.443 --> 03:49:59.485]  I guess when he was born that they thought my name was Big Hair.
[03:49:59.485 --> 03:50:05.230]  But the point is that... And we've heard from... The Sheriff's always sick and no one can ever find him.
[03:50:05.714 --> 03:50:07.494]  They're saying he's sick right now.
[03:50:07.494 --> 03:50:11.275]  Locals have reported something else.
[03:50:11.275 --> 03:50:14.216]  Well, he has the native taste for certain things.
[03:50:14.216 --> 03:50:17.896]  But the point is, it's really bad, folks.
[03:50:17.896 --> 03:50:22.037]  And I've never seen a boss hog town quite like this.
[03:50:22.037 --> 03:50:23.758]  But it's a microcosm.
[03:50:23.758 --> 03:50:26.498]  You drive across Texas, more prisons than anywhere else in the U.S.
[03:50:26.498 --> 03:50:28.579]  per capita, more prisons than anywhere else in the world.
[03:50:28.579 --> 03:50:29.079]  The U.S.
[03:50:29.079 --> 03:50:33.520]  is the capital of prisons nationwide and worldwide.
[03:50:33.520 --> 03:50:34.840]  Texas is the capital of that.
[03:50:35.180 --> 03:50:35.981]  We'll be back after this.
[03:50:35.981 --> 03:50:37.202]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:37.202 --> 03:50:38.743]  Alex on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[03:51:02.028 --> 03:51:07.910]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:13.052]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[03:51:13.052 --> 03:51:14.272]  That was then.
[03:51:14.272 --> 03:51:15.553]  This is now.
[03:51:15.553 --> 03:51:18.274]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[03:51:18.274 --> 03:51:24.336]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[03:51:24.336 --> 03:51:29.618]  The DigiNet Sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings,
[03:51:29.878 --> 03:51:33.540]  Proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[03:51:33.540 --> 03:51:37.021]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[03:51:37.021 --> 03:51:41.483]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[03:51:41.483 --> 03:51:43.004]  Video never lies.
[03:51:43.004 --> 03:51:44.665]  Watch Big Brother back.

[03:52:20.948 --> 03:52:22.929]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.929 --> 03:52:25.391]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.391 --> 03:52:38.598]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.598 --> 03:52:40.259]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.259 --> 03:52:42.120]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:42.120 --> 03:52:48.344]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:52:57.291 --> 03:52:58.873]  The Obama Deception.

[03:53:02.110 --> 03:53:04.011]  We all need to prepare ourselves.
[03:53:04.011 --> 03:53:09.194]  You might have the food, water, gold, and silver, but ask yourself, are you truly prepared?

[03:54:09.215 --> 03:54:11.195]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:11.195 --> 03:54:19.777]  Remember, if you missed any of the program, the rebroadcast begins in about six minutes, and you can pick up the podcast only at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:54:19.777 --> 03:54:24.458]  Joining us live from Hardin, Montana, boots on the ground, Alex Jones.
[03:54:24.458 --> 03:54:26.438]  Alex?
[03:54:26.438 --> 03:54:29.879]  Yes, Barnabas, I will be live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:54:29.879 --> 03:54:33.419]  Central, and I'll give people a boil-down of everything we've witnessed here.
[03:54:33.419 --> 03:54:38.040]  We'll also get the latest flu information, a lot of other important, informative guests coming up next week.
[03:54:38.464 --> 03:54:43.707]  You're going to interview Peter Dale Scott today for your upcoming film that I'm very, very excited about.
[03:54:43.707 --> 03:54:50.410]  So that is some great work that you're doing there, Jason, on the Invisible Empire documentary.
[03:54:50.410 --> 03:55:05.997]  Before I finish up with Harry Hilton and what's happening here in Hardin, Montana, I wanted to just encourage listeners to understand that we're running out of time.
[03:55:05.997 --> 03:55:07.178]  The tyranny is taking over.
[03:55:07.628 --> 03:55:14.897]  They use economically depressed areas and countries so the people can't stand up or take care of themselves, just like what's happening here in Arden.
[03:55:14.897 --> 03:55:16.759]  We need to show who the criminal bankers are.
[03:55:16.759 --> 03:55:22.867]  We need to identify them as the real shadow government that is the source of all of this tyranny and most of our problems.
[03:55:23.487 --> 03:55:24.968]  And that's what Fall Republic does.
[03:55:24.968 --> 03:55:30.452]  It shows how they use the TV for mind control, the police state, how they're turning everybody into Stasi spies.
[03:55:30.452 --> 03:55:31.693]  It really is my greatest work.
[03:55:31.693 --> 03:55:34.234]  And if you want to get it first, pre-order it now.
[03:55:34.234 --> 03:55:36.636]  It's going to be shipping in about 19 days or so.
[03:55:36.636 --> 03:55:38.457]  It comes out the 21st of October.
[03:55:38.457 --> 03:55:40.558]  It'll be at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:55:40.558 --> 03:55:45.162]  If you let your PrisonPlanet.TV membership lapse or never tried one, we've updated the site.
[03:55:45.162 --> 03:55:45.962]  We've made it even better.
[03:55:45.962 --> 03:55:47.763]  It's five and a half years up and running.
[03:55:47.763 --> 03:55:51.786]  All my films, the live TV show, my book, Paul Watson's book, so much more.
[03:55:51.786 --> 03:55:53.287]  Expanded extras from all the films.
[03:55:53.710 --> 03:55:55.646]  PrisonPlanet.tv or order!
[03:55:56.184 --> 03:56:01.648]  Fall of the Republic, today, so you get the DVD with all the extras first, in the highest quality.
[03:56:01.648 --> 03:56:08.353]  Again, Fall of the Republic, available at InfoWars.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[03:56:08.353 --> 03:56:10.555]  I'm so excited about Fall of the Republic.
[03:56:10.555 --> 03:56:19.242]  I don't want this to be as viral or more than Obama Deception, and that is up to you, the great listeners, that got the DVD of the Obama Deception and made those copies and got out to everybody.
[03:56:19.242 --> 03:56:20.502]  I met a bunch of locals here.
[03:56:20.502 --> 03:56:22.804]  More than half the town knows me and likes me.
[03:56:22.804 --> 03:56:23.665]  I walked down the street,
[03:56:24.235 --> 03:56:25.176]  We're good to go.
[03:56:39.784 --> 03:56:40.744]  We're good to go.
[03:57:00.089 --> 03:57:02.511]  It blows up in their face big time.
[03:57:02.511 --> 03:57:05.715]  But just please, everybody get ball in Republic today.
[03:57:05.715 --> 03:57:08.858]  And again, we'll continue to investigate this hardened situation.
[03:57:08.858 --> 03:57:15.124]  It looks like we dug through the wall and burrowed into a giant rat's nest of corruption, but this can only happen
[03:57:15.620 --> 03:57:17.681]  If our country wasn't so corrupt.
[03:57:17.681 --> 03:57:22.264]  This happened because these little towns and the big cities alike, corruption has set in.
[03:57:22.264 --> 03:57:25.365]  Boss hogs, thugs have taken over government everywhere.
[03:57:25.365 --> 03:57:30.288]  They feed and predicate like predators on the local populations.
[03:57:30.288 --> 03:57:32.089]  And that is definitely what's happening here.
[03:57:32.089 --> 03:57:41.014]  Any way you slice it, this is a mafioso takeover with a big prison to further suck the blood out of the local people that can't stand up for themselves.
[03:57:41.014 --> 03:57:42.274]  That's what the government is.
[03:57:42.274 --> 03:57:43.435]  It's a giant parasitic
[03:57:45.353 --> 03:57:47.955]  Absolutely, and it continues to expand its power.
[03:57:47.955 --> 03:57:56.081]  I mean, I can't even recognize this country anymore when we're saying it's okay to have foreign mercenaries run our police forces, Alex.
[03:57:56.081 --> 03:57:58.723]  I mean, we've had callers... That's my final point!
[03:57:58.723 --> 03:58:05.447]  The leadership of the town, we went to the Sheriff's Office, went to talk to us, but others, people at the Sheriff's Department and others said, look, we like it.
[03:58:05.447 --> 03:58:06.808]  We don't mind if he's a foreigner.
[03:58:06.808 --> 03:58:07.529]  We want you.
[03:58:07.529 --> 03:58:08.730]  You're not from here.
[03:58:08.730 --> 03:58:09.490]  You need to leave.
[03:58:09.490 --> 03:58:11.532]  So they said, we like foreign serves.
[03:58:13.148 --> 03:58:14.289]  But we don't like U.S.
[03:58:14.289 --> 03:58:17.231]  citizens from Texas, but that's the small minority.
[03:58:17.231 --> 03:58:21.894]  The boss hogs just love this Hilton guy because he fits right in with them.
[03:58:21.894 --> 03:58:32.841]  Absolutely, and if you missed any of this ever-important program, you need to listen to the rebroadcast or hit the podcast over at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[03:58:32.841 --> 03:58:33.662]  God bless you all.
[03:58:41.862 --> 03:58:47.504]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[03:58:47.504 --> 03:58:51.326]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[03:58:51.326 --> 03:58:54.727]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.727 --> 03:58:58.349]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.349 --> 03:59:02.910]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.910 --> 03:59:04.331]  These emergency backup systems
[03:59:04.531 --> 03:59:07.453]  We'll provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[03:59:07.453 --> 03:59:13.579]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.579 --> 03:59:17.202]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.202 --> 03:59:22.026]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:22.026 --> 03:59:28.591]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.591 --> 03:59:30.533]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:31.013 --> 03:59:32.674]  Coast to coast and in your face!
[03:59:32.674 --> 03:59:36.657]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
