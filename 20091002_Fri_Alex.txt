[02:00.000 --> 02:06.880]  the revelations that the company's lead figure is a convicted felon with a history of fraud
[02:06.880 --> 02:12.040]  Michael Hilton who formed Santa Ana California based American police force in March remember
[02:12.040 --> 02:17.480]  it's not American it's not a police force talk about Orwellian came to Hardin last month
[02:17.480 --> 02:21.920]  promising to fill the city's never used jail and build an adjacent military and law enforcement
[02:21.920 --> 02:27.640]  training center let's not forget he also promised the people free health care animal shelters

[03:15.880 --> 03:20.920]  taking the average here attorney general Steve Bullock said Thursday he is asking Hardin
[03:20.920 --> 03:26.240]  officials for all documents related to their dealings with Hilton and American police force
[03:26.240 --> 03:30.760]  and that's the update here's the original article they posted Michael Hilton showed up
[03:30.760 --> 03:36.640]  in Hardin Montana last week presenting himself as an economic savior the man who would take
[03:36.640 --> 03:41.080]  over the town's 27 million dollar jail empty since it was first built as a development
[03:41.080 --> 03:49.240]  project in 2007 and provide 200 new jobs in the process remember this supersedes administrations
[03:49.240 --> 03:55.160]  this is the new world order this is incrementalism they started under Bush they continue it under

[04:11.680 --> 04:18.480]  disasters they're keeping away from this topic he wore military style uniform and as a gesture
[04:18.480 --> 04:23.680]  to local law enforcement offered up the use of three Mercedes SUVs and remember these
[04:23.680 --> 04:29.880]  SUVs were labeled American police force as though they were law enforcement they are
[04:29.880 --> 04:37.680]  not law enforcement they are not police this is a privatized organization but the man who
[04:37.680 --> 04:41.480]  styles himself as a military veteran turned private sector entrepreneur and a California
[04:41.480 --> 04:45.960]  defense contractor with an extensive government contract also has another image and that one

[10:39.200 --> 10:44.240]  from media members and the public after an ap story linked the security firms leader michael
[10:44.240 --> 10:49.560]  hilton to multiple bankruptcies and convictions for more than a dozen felonies there were
[10:49.560 --> 10:56.760]  no surprises michael disclosed this information to me um before i agreed to come to work for
[10:56.760 --> 11:01.640]  him shea and t r a vice president al peterson both say they knew about the convictions
[11:01.640 --> 11:09.240]  long before the report came out but are still confident in apf i firmly believe apf is legitimate
[11:09.240 --> 11:14.400]  and a solid corporation peterson declined in on camera interview but released this statement
[11:14.400 --> 11:19.680]  saying quote i believe that the t r a has a better chance of getting the detention facility
[11:19.680 --> 11:25.240]  open with apf than with any montana officials what do we have to lose if it doesn't work
[11:25.240 --> 11:30.720]  out end quote apf also continues to stand firm on its stance to not release the parent
[11:30.720 --> 11:37.360]  company that information would be disclosed but mires and others like her pledged to continue
[11:37.360 --> 11:43.400]  their research they're putting in a criminal to watch criminals and try to get to the bottom
[11:43.400 --> 11:50.040]  of the mystery behind the harden jail reporting in harden nick law colorate news calls to
[11:50.040 --> 11:55.720]  michael hilton were not returned apf spokesperson becky shea says helton is currently in california
[11:55.720 --> 12:00.520]  on business and is expected back in harden in the next couple of weeks well court that
[12:00.520 --> 12:05.480]  records from orange county california indicate michael hilton has a lengthy criminal past
[12:05.480 --> 12:10.640]  including a six-year prison sentence for a dozen counts of grand theft and other charges
[12:10.640 --> 12:14.920]  court documents show more than a decade of courtroom appearances for hilton starting
[12:14.920 --> 12:20.440]  in nineteen eighty two through nineteen ninety nine on charges including bad checks fraud
[12:20.440 --> 12:25.160]  breach of contract and grand theft after his release from prison court documents indicate
[12:25.160 --> 12:30.840]  he was entangled in at least three civil lawsuits alleging fraud or misrepresentation and we
[12:30.840 --> 12:35.680]  learned just yesterday there's a warrant out for hilton's arrest in wyoming a shared in
[12:35.680 --> 12:41.160]  county wyoming circuit god court judge issued a warrant september first court clerk says
[12:41.160 --> 12:45.160]  he was ticketed for driving with a suspended driver's license on interstate ninety in

[12:50.760 --> 12:57.440]  in court it just disgusts me that the man refuses to an interview on we're not talking
[12:57.440 --> 13:01.720]  about michael hilton we're talking about one of the uh... t s r a guys he refuses an interview
[13:01.720 --> 13:07.400]  says what do we have to lose well i'll tell you what we have to lose we have our humanity

[13:20.320 --> 13:27.240]  will be training other foreigners and cooperating with local and tribal officials the end of
[13:27.240 --> 13:34.240]  america that's what you have to lose you have this country to lose sir how dare you but
[13:34.240 --> 13:38.280]  it's all about the almighty dot dollar and everybody saying how nice becky shea is and
[13:38.280 --> 13:42.740]  i'm sure she's a really nice person but she just outright tells you i'm not here to answer
[13:42.740 --> 13:48.240]  your questions i'm here to tell you what my bosses said was okay to tell you and we won't
[13:48.240 --> 13:51.680]  disclose who really owns us
[13:51.680 --> 13:55.320]  you know this story came out of that the twelfth of september
[13:55.320 --> 14:00.800]  a little over three weeks ago and here's another name to kind of throw out there and see what
[14:00.800 --> 14:05.680]  our great listeners can find out in san anna american police force occupies a single suite
[14:05.680 --> 14:09.680]  on the second floor of a two-story office building during a visit to the location thursday
[14:09.680 --> 14:14.680]  reporter for the associated press encountered a uniform man behind a desk who would only
[14:14.680 --> 14:20.720]  identify himself as captain michael of course this is michael hillton a.k.a. whatever the
[14:20.720 --> 14:26.160]  yoghavitch that's his that's one of his favorite aliases mr. the yoghavitch the man declined
[14:26.160 --> 14:30.640]  to discuss basic details about the company and refer the reporter the company's website
[14:30.640 --> 14:34.920]  in a subsequent phone interview he provided his surname but insisted it it's not to be
[14:34.920 --> 14:39.760]  used because of security concerns the man said he was a naturalized u.s. citizen born
[14:39.760 --> 14:45.400]  in montanegro with decades of experience in military and law enforcement operations
[14:45.400 --> 14:50.920]  the man said his boss is a retired u.s. army colonel named richard culver let's repeat
[14:50.920 --> 14:59.040]  that for people his boss is supposedly a united states army colonel someone else selling us
[14:59.040 --> 15:03.880]  down the river someone else who's going along to get along someone else who's just taking
[15:03.880 --> 15:08.400]  orders yeah the nazis just took orders to well they were putting caps in the back of
[15:08.400 --> 15:15.480]  the heads of dissidents communists and jews richard culver who is currently overseas culver's
[15:15.480 --> 15:21.320]  role with the company could not be immediately verified the company's claim of a headquarters
[15:21.320 --> 15:28.000]  address is just up the street from the white house so you do the math you figure out how
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.560]  high up the chain this goes this is obviously a globalist program but the federalies know
[15:33.560 --> 15:40.320]  all about it and are probably sponsoring it so colonel richard culver is another person
[15:40.320 --> 15:47.560]  we need to look into immediately we need to find a background on and i can only thank
[15:47.560 --> 15:53.840]  you listeners out there for getting this story your friends your family the local news outlets
[15:53.840 --> 15:58.320]  the major talk shows out there because now they've at least launched a probe and hopefully
[15:58.320 --> 16:04.840]  we can stop this before it goes too far before this becomes the norm in all in our already
[16:04.840 --> 16:11.120]  morally defunct society what is everybody talking about today oh david letterman admitted

[16:37.480 --> 16:42.040]  about that's what the the word on the street is the talk around the water cooler it's not
[16:42.040 --> 16:48.880]  that privatized foreign military forces are in montana right now practicing takeovers
[16:48.880 --> 16:54.040]  saying yeah we'll train your privatized military force we'll train your local police force
[16:54.040 --> 16:59.800]  we're here to help and remember it was thrown around that this was going to be guantanamo

[17:30.480 --> 17:37.800]  is neither and then they have the cojones to sit there and put the serbian flag above
[17:37.800 --> 17:42.960]  it the double headed eagle with a crown over top kind of letting you know laughing in your
[17:42.960 --> 17:52.320]  face saying yeah it's american police force alright oh my goodness so usa today has also

[36:01.080 --> 36:09.480]  that says american police force he's not the police he's not even michael hilton he's
[36:09.480 --> 36:16.320]  an outstanding felon who served prison time who has had civil judgments weighed against
[36:16.320 --> 36:22.200]  him to the tune of more than a million dollars folks i may never see a million dollars in
[36:22.200 --> 36:27.560]  my entire lifetime and this guy is losing lawsuits of over a million dollars what does
[36:27.560 --> 36:35.120]  that tell you is this the person that you want to entrust with a privatized prison system
[36:35.120 --> 36:40.080]  that's going to have a trainings facility for foreign mercenaries it's nightmarish it's
[36:40.080 --> 36:47.360]  outlandish it's the new america with a k and you know as as we slide down this as we say
[36:47.360 --> 36:53.840]  it's okay for riot police and military to engage the populace at the g twenty in pittsburgh
[36:53.840 --> 37:01.320]  this is out of the washington times yesterday dhs helps local police by military sonic devices
[37:01.320 --> 37:07.960]  yes the l rads are going to be going nationwide with the help of homeland security grants remember
[37:07.960 --> 37:14.080]  homeland security was set up after nine eleven not for al-qaeda not for the taliban not for
[37:14.080 --> 37:22.000]  the terrorists but for you and me believe it that's why michael shartoff who headed
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.600]  up the organization after tom ridge when he was a part of the attorney general's office
[37:26.600 --> 37:32.320]  he was the head of the criminal division he was contacted by robert right who was a former
[37:32.320 --> 37:37.840]  fbi agent who had followed the the money with bin laden this is all in my film fabled enemies
[37:37.840 --> 37:43.560]  you can get it over info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv and he said he had information
[37:43.560 --> 37:50.440]  on how this operation was funded how the money moved who was involved now he contacted judicial
[37:50.440 --> 37:56.880]  watch larry claimant of judicial watch personally called michael shartoff the then head of the
[37:56.880 --> 38:01.560]  criminal division in the attorney general's office what did michael shartoff have to say
[38:01.560 --> 38:08.000]  to him this is what he said to him we don't have time for conspiracy theories sit down
[38:08.000 --> 38:14.240]  and shut up because this isn't about al-qaeda this isn't about the taliban this isn't about
[38:14.240 --> 38:19.720]  the middle east in the terrace we set up homeland security which he he later heads which he later
[38:19.720 --> 38:25.880]  heads for the american people and that's why you're seeing the dhs supply lrad weapons
[38:25.880 --> 38:31.800]  to police departments nationwide let me read it with the help of homeland security grants
[38:31.800 --> 38:37.000]  police departments nationwide looking to subdue unruly crowns and political protesters they
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.600]  want to take away your free speech they want to put you in what's called a free speech
[38:40.600 --> 38:47.640]  zone are purchasing a high tech device originally used by the military to repel battlefield insurgents
[38:47.640 --> 38:54.000]  and somali pirates with piercing noise capabilities uh... that damaged your hearing police acknowledge
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.800]  that they deployed the so-called at long-range acoustic devices lrads as a safeguard at recent
[38:59.800 --> 39:05.480]  political conventions protest plagued international summit meetings and this summer summers volatile
[39:05.480 --> 39:12.280]  town hall meetings on health care let me repeat that for you they're using lrads on people
[39:12.280 --> 39:19.160]  at town hall meetings that don't want the clause to kill granny
[39:19.160 --> 39:26.760]  yes they are death panels when newsweek does a cover story with an unplugged life support device
[39:26.760 --> 39:32.040]  and it says the case for killing granny and why it's the right thing to do you're not allowed to
[39:32.040 --> 39:37.560]  say no you're gonna get hit with an lrad weapon and believe me you will disperse when you hear
[39:37.560 --> 39:42.920]  this thing go off officers were captured last week on video using the devices against protesters
[39:42.920 --> 39:48.040]  at the group of twenty summit in pittsburgh causing many to cover their ears or disperse
[39:48.040 --> 39:53.000]  to escape the shrieking sound san diego-based american technology corporation insists the
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.520]  device is manufactured and sales sales are not intended to be used as sonic weapons but rather
[39:58.520 --> 40:07.080]  to influence the behavior and gain compliance compliance from people but the company stated
[40:07.080 --> 40:11.560]  in a securities and exchange commission filing in september 2008 that the device is capable of
[40:11.560 --> 40:17.640]  sufficient acoustic output to cause damage to human hearing or human health expressing concern
[40:17.640 --> 40:23.560]  that this is a misuse and could lead to lawsuits i sure hope it leads to lawsuits i sure hope people
[40:23.560 --> 40:29.080]  stand up and say yeah i don't want to get hit with an acoustical device and this is going to be
[40:29.080 --> 40:35.080]  deployed all around the country remember it's not for al-qaeda it's not for the taliban it's not
[40:35.080 --> 40:41.080]  for the insurgency it's for you and me when we don't like what the government is doing when we
[40:41.080 --> 40:48.200]  don't care for what the establishment is pushing on us at town hall meetings about health care
[40:48.200 --> 40:53.800]  this is how we're going to use the lrad weapons and i'm sure they're going to be training all these
[40:53.800 --> 41:01.960]  foreign mercs up in harden montana on how to use these lrad weapons how to round people up how to
[41:01.960 --> 41:07.800]  gain compliance oh they'll gain compliance when they shoot a rubber bullet in your eye they'll
[41:07.800 --> 41:14.680]  gain compliance when they launch tear gas at you and your family it's sick it's disturbing it's beyond
[41:14.680 --> 41:20.600]  disgusting and this is our country this is what our forefathers fought and died for
[41:23.160 --> 41:27.000]  when are we going to say no when are we going to say it's gone too far when are we going to
[41:27.000 --> 41:34.440]  demand the abolishment of this unruly bureaucracy we call the department of homeland security
[41:34.440 --> 41:40.440]  i saw plenty of dhs officers on the scene over in pittsburgh you know what i didn't see al-qaeda
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.920]  al-qaeda did not make an appearance at the g20 what do you know yet they're still using these
[41:46.920 --> 41:52.600]  acoustical devices in mass you know they always beta test this stuff when was the first time you
[41:52.600 --> 41:57.800]  saw it launched well the first time it was on television was back in 2004 when the republican
[41:57.800 --> 42:01.480]  national convention came to new york city and they said yeah we'll put it on the top of police
[42:01.480 --> 42:07.400]  trucks yeah we'll put it on the back of vans yeah we'll hit unruly crowds that don't want to go into
[42:07.400 --> 42:13.720]  their free speech areas with it no big deal and we clamor for it we love it i see people on the
[42:13.720 --> 42:21.160]  comment board defending the actions of the riot police what's happened to us why have we become
[42:21.160 --> 42:26.600]  so docile so dumbed down do we really care that much about our monday night football are we that
[42:26.600 --> 42:34.680]  enthralled with graze anatomy and house that we can't take the time to say no to dhs and
[42:34.680 --> 42:40.280]  acoustic weapons around the country that we can't take the time to say no to foreign mercenaries
[42:40.280 --> 42:46.760]  on the streets of harden montana to privatize prison systems openly run by felons and the
[42:46.760 --> 42:53.640]  u.s. military with that being said let's go to alex jones right now on the ground in harden
[42:53.640 --> 43:00.360]  montana alex jason we are here in the harden montana in front of the detention center again it
[43:00.360 --> 43:06.440]  was a circus here yesterday with a lot at least 30 locals showing up while we were here in just
[43:06.440 --> 43:12.200]  one hour then we came back later uh other locals were showing up driving through to see what was
[43:12.200 --> 43:18.760]  happening of course since then the attorney general of the state of montana has launched a
[43:18.760 --> 43:29.480]  major investigation into american police force and also the two rivers uh authority here and uh i
[43:29.480 --> 43:36.600]  i said paul watched us some emails last night of local news uh out of billings and also out of
[43:36.600 --> 43:42.040]  harden but i didn't see those up on prison planet dot com this morning uh of him dressed up
[43:42.040 --> 43:48.920]  at city council meetings in his american police force uniform uh and also we've gotten more
[43:48.920 --> 43:58.040]  photographs of the decals they had on the cars that said american police force harden police
[43:58.040 --> 44:02.840]  with a double headed eagle in the center of the christ so that is indeed going on amazon the front
[44:02.840 --> 44:11.880]  page of the harden weekly newspaper uh that was published yesterday and is on newsstands
[44:11.880 --> 44:20.120]  here so uh bottom line is a classic example of how any mercenary firm no matter how disreputable
[44:20.120 --> 44:28.120]  uh their their head is can just come into a town come into a 27 million dollar detention facility
[44:28.680 --> 44:34.360]  uh nine months ago they were trying to and we confirmed this with them inside trying to turn
[44:34.360 --> 44:39.720]  this into wantonimo bay west we saw the maps the blueprints on the walls or enemy combatants
[44:39.720 --> 44:46.920]  uh and for uh holding uh quote alien uh prisoners uh they're not talking about the
[44:46.920 --> 44:53.480]  count from mars and so all of that is going on here there's also a bizarre sign on the gate
[44:54.200 --> 44:58.280]  and i'm going to email these to watch and encourage them to get them posted uh that
[44:58.280 --> 45:03.640]  we noticed inside the gate when you're leaving uh it says no hostages will be allowed through this
[45:03.640 --> 45:09.960]  gate and yes it says no hostages will be allowed uh through this gate very very bizarre so the
[45:09.960 --> 45:15.720]  mystery just deepens here also they were claiming and using the logos and names of blackwater black
[45:15.720 --> 45:21.160]  water has said that they're not affiliated with this group but black water has a history of being
[45:21.160 --> 45:25.320]  deceptive and that's the problem with all these groups we don't know what the truth is i was in a
[45:26.120 --> 45:33.000]  bizarre press conference yesterday uh as the spokeswoman for american police force
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.960]  inside the prison uh was there with several newspapers several local tv stations from
[45:37.960 --> 45:42.600]  billings and they were saying i will not tell you who owns american police force and they were
[45:42.600 --> 45:49.160]  literally yelling at her demanding to know uh she started crying uh saying that she can't tell
[45:50.040 --> 45:56.520]  people now we were hoping that this guy was just a con artist once we discovered this that that was
[45:56.520 --> 46:02.200]  where it ended but he has purchased all these new cars he has already given money to local
[46:02.200 --> 46:08.600]  community uh he was promising to build a homeless shelter this this huge military command base
[46:09.640 --> 46:17.560]  as has had all this personnel uh through the town and was able to put down uh the two
[46:18.600 --> 46:25.880]  plus million dollar per year lease two million plus it's in the paper thing of 2.3 million going
[46:25.880 --> 46:31.080]  from memory so he was able to come up with all this money and then he has all these convictions
[46:31.080 --> 46:34.600]  in different states and and and convicted of running every scam and all these big
[46:35.720 --> 46:43.320]  civil judgments against him and all these strange uh aliases that he has the question is how could
[46:43.320 --> 46:50.360]  it just be a complete scam by this gentleman lever's real name is captain hilton captain
[46:50.360 --> 46:56.200]  michael hilton as he's known by the locals how could then he come in and lease this and pay the money
[46:56.200 --> 47:01.320]  uh to the two rivers authority that's why they still think he's legitimate and say well
[47:02.040 --> 47:07.080]  even if he's a you know has this bad background he's at least paid the money and we need to do
[47:07.080 --> 47:13.160]  something with this with this detention facility on top of that you have the locals paying for
[47:13.160 --> 47:17.880]  the infrastructure for this facility you have foreign shadowy investors so they won't mention
[47:17.880 --> 47:23.080]  two years ago that paid to have the 27 million dollar facility built to be technical it's not
[47:23.080 --> 47:27.480]  on the reservation uh some of our guests we've had on we're incorrect about that i've got the
[47:27.480 --> 47:33.800]  local city maps it's on the border of the crow nation uh reservation we've also discovered
[47:33.800 --> 47:39.160]  from local newspaper reporters that there was a discussion a year and a half ago by the governor
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.800]  uh i'm seeing some breakup jason can you hear me i can hear you but the breakup is uh i can
[47:45.800 --> 47:50.440]  hear that as well well i'm gonna call you back all right alex before you go i would also like
[47:50.440 --> 47:54.680]  to point out that our listeners did fish out this piece of information this is out of a
[47:54.680 --> 48:00.200]  associated press article on september 12th where he would only uh mention that his name was captain
[48:00.200 --> 48:06.680]  michael but an interview with this gentleman he said that his boss is a retired us army colonel
[48:06.680 --> 48:12.440]  named richard culver who is currently overseas culver's role with the company could not be
[48:12.440 --> 48:19.160]  immediately verified so we need we need our listeners to do double time we need you out
[48:19.160 --> 48:24.920]  there finding out who this culver character is what are his ties who are his financial backers
[48:24.920 --> 48:31.400]  where is this money coming from why is he overseas why has he taken an interest in foreign mercenaries
[48:32.200 --> 48:39.240]  in foreign mercenaries taking over harden montana in a privatized military facility
[48:40.120 --> 48:47.880]  that was built in 2007 once again you know this this michael hilton character is saying
[48:47.880 --> 48:53.800]  that his boss is a retired us army colonel named richard culver who is currently overseas so we
[48:53.800 --> 48:59.400]  really have to look into culver's background who he's been doing dealings with and who supplies
[48:59.400 --> 49:05.960]  him with his money jones and i think it's also important to know that we can't believe anything
[49:05.960 --> 49:13.480]  that this hilton character says so that may be completely made up he may just be stalling for
[49:13.480 --> 49:20.680]  time there at this point we don't know what the truth is we just know that three black
[49:21.720 --> 49:23.720]  mursadies uh
[49:25.960 --> 49:35.000]  suvs came in here about a week and a half ago with the name i've got some locals coming up
[49:35.000 --> 49:43.880]  saying hi hi folks we're gonna be on just saying i'm live on the radio thanks uh the point is
[49:43.880 --> 49:49.160]  got distracted by some folks coming up sorry the issue here is where did he get the money for the
[49:49.160 --> 49:53.720]  lease and then they say they won't say how much they say he's paid a large portion of the two
[49:53.720 --> 49:58.760]  plus million dollars that is the yearly lease on the 27 million dollar facility and the three
[49:58.760 --> 50:08.840]  black mursadies uh suvs uh then showed up they did have harden police on the side he has shown up
[50:08.840 --> 50:14.200]  at and i pulled up the old those articles on this from the last month he has showed up
[50:15.480 --> 50:23.960]  at different uh city council meetings where the city of harden is boating to begin the process
[50:23.960 --> 50:33.560]  in the last month to get rid of the big horn sheriff's department as their police force and so
[50:33.560 --> 50:39.320]  they admit they are looking and we're looking at giving it over to this hilton characters
[50:40.200 --> 50:44.600]  company so you you have this convicted felon that's going to run a secretive detention facility
[50:44.600 --> 50:49.160]  paramilitary training facility and going to run the local police department it is true they were

[55:23.320 --> 55:27.560]  think that's the number one moral of this story now i'm going to go to the city council meeting
[55:27.560 --> 55:31.720]  tonight a special meeting i'm about to go over to the bighorn sheriff's department try to talk to
[55:31.720 --> 55:35.560]  them but i told they get very aggressive you try to talk to them they've hung up on us when we've
[55:35.560 --> 55:41.960]  called we're also going to go over to the mayor's office we're going to go over to the two rivers
[55:41.960 --> 55:48.520]  authority office and then really try to get some answers here today what's going on but a bizarre
[55:48.520 --> 55:52.920]  femacamp where they admitted they wanted to hold enemy combatants maps on the wall saying it's for
[55:52.920 --> 56:00.280]  enemy combatants and uh aliens alien prisoners uh just it gets stranger and stranger and stranger
[56:00.920 --> 56:05.800]  and then also you have locals you know with rumors spinning out of control and emails
[56:05.800 --> 56:12.600]  of uh flying around but but what do you expect to happen when you have such a secretive organization
[56:12.600 --> 56:17.000]  doing all of this but i think it's safe to say that mr hilton is going to be kicked off of this
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.440]  uh project you know i i can't really judge the two rivers authority they probably just got con in
[56:22.440 --> 56:27.480]  this whole thing uh most of the locals you know want to see this attention center used for something
[56:27.480 --> 56:31.720]  but that's the other big issue a lot of the locals are concerned saying it's built right on the edge
[56:31.720 --> 56:37.080]  of the reservation and that's uh they're just going to start arresting people for petty offenses
[56:37.080 --> 56:43.480]  to get money out of them in this giant facility i mean this is a this is a jail this is a detention
[56:43.480 --> 56:51.160]  center uh that a major city of several hundred thousand uh could easily uh used this is not
[56:51.160 --> 56:54.920]  something out here in the middle of nowhere i mean when you leave the town of harden three and a
[56:54.920 --> 57:00.040]  half thousand people you may drive for 10 15 minutes before you even see a house or a white
[57:00.040 --> 57:04.360]  it is pitch black out here at night so in the middle of nowhere there is this gigantic
[57:04.360 --> 57:09.960]  uh shadowy facility with some weird con artist with a foreign accent running around with
[57:09.960 --> 57:16.760]  german paramilitary uh in touge and it just gets stranger and stranger and stranger absolutely and
[57:16.760 --> 57:21.400]  i think that some of the big points that we need to make is that they put somebody who was a convicted
[57:21.400 --> 57:29.320]  felon who had snouted reporting over 17 aliases in charge of this it's also taking place in montana
[57:29.320 --> 57:35.080]  where they just had this n l e o nine exercise where they worked with foreign military foreign
[57:35.080 --> 57:40.040]  businesses and black ops you know i want to know what their involvement in that drill wasn't it
[57:40.040 --> 57:45.000]  whether this was so many times when we look at other organizations they have other criminals
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.520]  running them and they usually use a criminal as their front person so they can just discredit
[57:50.520 --> 57:55.400]  them later that is probably what's going on here or he may just be a complete con artist but where
[57:55.400 --> 58:00.680]  did he get all the money to pay the down payment if he is nothing but a con artist this is very
[58:00.680 --> 58:05.720]  very serious and quite a mystery absolutely and let's not forget that becky shea and another
[58:05.720 --> 58:10.760]  official said that they were well aware of his criminal background before it hit the news media
[58:10.760 --> 58:16.360]  this week so they knew what they were getting into by getting this guy on board alex well she has
[58:16.360 --> 58:21.720]  said that but she said that he told her this last friday uh who knows what's true i mean this one
[58:21.720 --> 58:26.040]  was breaking down and crying uh i mean i really kind of feel sorry for some of the locals in the
[58:26.040 --> 58:31.000]  community but this is an example about the feds or private corporations or anybody can just come
[58:31.000 --> 58:36.120]  into rural areas in america and push people around and take advantage of them absolutely we'll be

[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:37.160]  a foreign military mercenaries taking over a privatized prison system in an economically
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:45.720]  destitute area alex jason bermas absolutely and every five minutes or so new people roll into here
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:50.440]  people from billing people from heart and people from surrounding communities wanting to know what's
[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:57.160]  going on here uh i mean how could you make up a story this bizarre or some foreign multi-time
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:03.880]  felon from servia with bizarre mercenaries in tow comes in and leases a facility that's being
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:09.960]  looked at as a detention center for mondano bay people takes it over in the middle of nowhere
[1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:16.280]  brings in their own vehicles with police details on the sides uh a lot of people in the local town
[1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:20.840]  and the establishment have been uh i think they're part of the power structure are defending it
[1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:26.280]  even as it comes out that he's a serious criminal but the average locals almost unanimously when
[1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:30.360]  you talk to just the common folks they are very upset about this they're very angry and they're
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:37.160]  not stupid they keep saying how are they going to fund this gigantic facility uh i mean in the
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:42.040]  town there's three thousand five hundred people in the county there's only a few thousand more people
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:47.960]  in the surrounding area i mean this is extremely ultra rural one of the most uh thinly populated
[1:01:47.960 --> 1:01:54.440]  areas in the country how are they going to fill 450 beds to start with and they say that they want
[1:01:55.160 --> 1:02:01.720]  in the news at least a thousand more beds they want another facility built onto this this is a
[1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:09.080]  very large so so so are they going to put a quarter or 10 of the town in the jail i mean i
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:13.160]  guess in texas we have over 10 of the public has warrants out for their arrest and then that's the
[1:02:13.160 --> 1:02:20.120]  issue is this was built as an economic development zone uh that's how sick this has gotten that's
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:26.840]  what our economy is face scanning cameras checkpoints police barb wire most of the big new uh

[1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:31.800]  of harden and and clearly in the wings they met the vehicles here with art and police they were

[1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:24.680]  curb non-essential spending also climbed for the first time since may so by walgreens
[1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:33.000]  pimping out the regular flu vaccination they're making some scratch and and let's not forget the
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:39.480]  h1n1 vaccine the people that don't like needles they're going to try to offer you a nasal spray
[1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:47.720]  i implore you out there people i implore you refuse the shot at all costs we read a story
[1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:52.920]  out of abalone in texas yesterday where they admitted that it wasn't really mandatory and
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:57.640]  that they had been curbing people who didn't want to take the shot and then they said well you know
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:03.080]  there are a couple of waiver forms but the waiver forms will only go so far and if your child has
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:07.800]  10 unexcused absences they're going to become truant and we all know what happens in this country
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:16.120]  if your child's truant here comes cps meanwhile they give verichip corporation an exclusive
[1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:23.160]  license to patent uh used in virus triage detective systems for the h1n1 virus and then
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:31.000]  their stock jumps up they make it mandatory for all military personnel all military personnel
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:37.400]  including national guard and people who work for the defense department to take the h1n1 vaccine
[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:44.440]  and remember it's not really h1n1 it's h5n1 it's hn1 or h1n1 and it's human flu virus
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:50.760]  is all mixed together see that's in the backdrop they they they've really downplayed that aspect of
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:58.360]  it and they always try to target the poor and kathryn uh kathryn sobellis who's the head of health
[1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:05.400]  and human services in this country also a bill derberg attendee the last two years are running
[1:14:05.400 --> 1:14:13.400]  has openly stated that she plans to vaccinate 11 million illegal aliens as well that should
[1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:19.400]  tell you the mentality of this country they're going to vaccinate 11 million illegal aliens but
[1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:23.080]  they're not going to deport them you know they're they're going to say oh yeah you're not in this
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:28.680]  country legally take the shot because they always go after the poorest the people who are in the
[1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:35.720]  least control the people who are willing to bow down to the government what is this this is not
[1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:43.000]  america folks this is not america this is like something out of a combination of soviet russia
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:49.960]  and communist china but you tell the average person on the street this they'll just knob their head
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:57.560]  uh huh uh huh uh huh did you hear about john and k plus eight did you i i can't believe it
[1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:07.880]  he left the show i love that show tlc who and right now the only people that i know of that
[1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:15.240]  are standing up for their rights and saying no to this formaldehyde squalene mercury based
[1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:21.720]  vaccination are the albany health workers they're the ones that are out in front of the city capitol
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:28.840]  saying no let me just read you the first paragraph of this uh this article this is out of the
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:34.280]  troi record and troi is right outside of albany again the local media will report on this you're
[1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:43.640]  not seeing it on fox news you're not seeing it on cnn formaldehyde mercury and squalene may sound
[1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:50.280]  like ingredients in some kind of toxic chemistry experiment and that's what this is but these are
[1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:56.120]  actually what can be found in the h1n1 flu vaccine which should be made available to the public
[1:15:56.120 --> 1:16:01.320]  next week and it is partially because of the presence of these toxins that nearly 500 people
[1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:05.960]  rallied at the capitol tuesday against the state department of health mandating that health care
[1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:11.880]  workers should be vaccinated for the swine flu by the end of november if they don't comply these
[1:16:11.880 --> 1:16:19.640]  medical professionals could lose their jobs so they're going after your jobs the way you make
[1:16:19.640 --> 1:16:29.640]  your living they're going after your children how sick and disturbing is this for what the piggy
[1:16:29.640 --> 1:16:37.320]  flew and remember they preemptively put out an associated press and reuters press release that
[1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:42.040]  says oh yeah a lot of people are going to die a lot of people are going to get sick but that's
[1:16:42.040 --> 1:16:47.560]  normal and it's not because of the vaccination and then we have this young girl who took the
[1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:53.640]  Gardasil shot against hpv she dies two hours later two hours later the mainstream in the
[1:16:53.640 --> 1:16:59.160]  uk immediately jumps on the story says vaccination death this girl died from the vaccine and then
[1:16:59.160 --> 1:17:06.040]  american media boom let's spin it it can't be that us news and roll report two days later oh she
[1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:12.280]  died of a tumor she had a tumor folks this girl was healthy she was a 14 year old girl even if she
[1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:18.760]  had the tumor the tumor didn't kill her two hours after she took the vaccine let's be real that's not
[1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:27.560]  how it works and if you believe that i got about five bridges to sell you at a great price you can

[1:17:31.880 --> 1:17:39.400]  checks out to jason bermas that's the kind of suckers we are i want to read this uh health
[1:17:39.400 --> 1:17:44.120]  officials seek to vaccinate illegal immigrants against swine flu with swine flu vaccinations
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:48.040]  set to begin in october public health officials are mobilizing to ensure that the nation's
[1:17:48.040 --> 1:17:53.320]  estimated 11 million plus and that's a low ball number it's probably more around 30 million
[1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:58.520]  11 million plus illegal immigrants are vaccinated to protect themselves and the public unlike the
[1:17:58.520 --> 1:18:02.360]  debate over whether illegal immigrants should get federal health care there is little dispute
[1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:08.840]  they should be included in the nation's voluntary vaccination program voluntary i just read to you
[1:18:08.840 --> 1:18:18.680]  it was mandatory it's semantics it's wordplay it's orwell all over again it's again it's a hybrid
[1:18:18.680 --> 1:18:25.240]  of the dumbing down through medication through the foods through the vaccinations that you see in
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:33.000]  brave new world and the orwellian double speak that you saw in 1984 we believe it's important
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:37.960]  that all people are vaccinated regardless of immigration status if there's a pressing public
[1:18:37.960 --> 1:18:42.760]  health concerns said john fair a legal policy analyst at the center for immigration studies
[1:18:42.760 --> 1:18:49.080]  who which opposes taxpayer funded health care for illegal immigrants and wants to reduce immigration
[1:18:49.240 --> 1:18:54.040]  leaving 10 to 12 million immigrants unvaccinated against swine flu also known as h1n1 would
[1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:59.000]  increase the health risk for everyone and make it much harder to control the epidemic and remember
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:05.560]  they put us under level six they put us under level six months and months and months ago
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:12.200]  and then somehow in spain even though level six was the highest it could possibly be you went to
[1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:18.360]  the cdc's own website and you went to their checklist for pandemic flu viruses and it said
[1:19:18.360 --> 1:19:24.040]  it basically could quarantine you not basically it could quarantine you it could allow the use
[1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:31.320]  of offsite drugs with your inability to sue afterwards no repercussions for these people
[1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:39.400]  total martial law in america in spain they upped the game to 6.2 but you can't go higher than
[1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:46.280]  who level six so again it's about putting you in fear making you want to take the shot

[1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:55.080]  man who spent time in the california correctional facility you can't make this stuff up and he's
[1:24:55.080 --> 1:25:01.400]  the leader he's the one in charge he's the guy wearing a very deceptive american police force
[1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:08.440]  badge at city council meetings he's not american it's not a police force all right i promised i
[1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:14.440]  take your call so let's jump to brian in montreal brian you're online hi jason how's it going all
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:19.400]  right i wanted to clarify something about the little announcement they made about the medical
[1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:25.160]  study up here in canada because it certainly was a mind trick i've heard some people uh stayed on
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:31.160]  the show that they thought um just taking the regular shot would put you at risk that isn't
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:36.280]  a lie because i've already heard from a doctor here in montreal in the springtime when the
[1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:41.080]  flu first came out saying that they would put it in the fall shot so that's not a surprise
[1:25:41.080 --> 1:25:46.360]  but what people have to understand is up here in canada most of the people are fooled most of the
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:53.800]  time and last fall and this spring they had their seasonal regular flu shot and up here in canada
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:26:00.280]  us info warriors have been doing a good job on sites like 12 160 and 9 11 sherbrooke to inform
[1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:06.760]  the people and so there was a big resistance even though in can west they publish it 95 percent said
[1:26:06.760 --> 1:26:11.800]  they would be willing a lot of us questioned who they were asking because that was a complete lie
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:18.120]  at the same time they had a poll on cbc site and they were saying that only like 60 percent of people
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:23.560]  were not going to take the shot so they knew that the public was not interested so what they were
[1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:28.680]  trying to do is scare the public by saying if you've received your seasonal flu shot in the
[1:26:28.680 --> 1:26:35.160]  spring of this year or in the fall of last year you would be more likely to get so this would
[1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:40.360]  scare people i've had like 15 people come up to me and at least five of them they explain it to me
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:45.480]  exactly like that that they've been scared they think well because i got the flu shot in the spring
[1:26:45.480 --> 1:26:51.800]  i'm three times i'm five times likely i better go get this new h1 n1 virus well that that actually
[1:26:51.800 --> 1:26:56.120]  is a separate study from the one that i mentioned earlier which was out of the mayo clinic in
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:27:01.160]  minnesota but they use the same propaganda and i thank you for the call uh you know they're always
[1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:06.040]  trying to put these people into fear let me give you an example remember the mainstream media is
[1:27:06.040 --> 1:27:12.760]  the psychological warfare arm of the establishment let me read this one out of fox news again trying
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:18.840]  to scare pregnant women into injecting themselves with formaldehyde squalene and mercury nearly
[1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:24.440]  one in three pregnant women who've contracted h1 n1 have died in the us that's the headline out of
[1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:30.520]  fox news a stark reminder about how deadly the new h1 n1 virus can be during the news briefing
[1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:36.600]  tuesday us health officials said the virus was uh has hit pregnant women especially hard and remember
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:42.760]  we had the uh the new york times with a similar article earlier in the week pregnancy is no time
[1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:48.360]  to refuse the flu shot so of course they're going to use fear to try to corral people
[1:27:48.360 --> 1:27:55.160]  into taking the poison let's go to wilson in florida wilson you're online good afternoon jason

[1:34:55.960 --> 1:35:02.680]  um you know let's just get into the financial news the associated press reuters all the major
[1:35:02.680 --> 1:35:10.040]  news agencies are now admitting uh to a 9.8 percent unemployment rate we know the number is actually
[1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:15.400]  higher but for them to admit it's up around 10 percent is unprecedented and i've got headlines
[1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:21.640]  in front of me uh world bank head acknowledges shifting global order and how they need a new
[1:35:21.640 --> 1:35:27.400]  economic world order these have been headlines all week and uh this one's out of reuters imf world
[1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:33.560]  bank worn global cooperation could falter basically they're saying if people don't cooperate with the
[1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:41.320]  cartels the banksters at the imf and world bank things could get much worse well it's extortion
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:47.240]  it's a threat they're trying to tell you if you did touch our federal reserve will destroy the economy
[1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:52.760]  and what they don't understand or they don't want to go there is that they are the richest people
[1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:59.240]  in the world and they get the most to lose including their lives probably uh you know the american
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:05.000]  people and the people of the world are not dumb to what they're doing you know we have all these
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:11.480]  alternative radio programs such as uh alex jones and many others and we have some publications
[1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:17.560]  that discuss these kind of things not many i wish there were more and uh the world knows what they're
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:22.520]  doing and what their plan is now and all this propaganda that you just talked about coming
[1:36:22.520 --> 1:36:29.720]  through the u and the g20 they're doing away with g7 and g8 uh they're moving toward a world
[1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:36.680]  currency which will be out of the i imf uh they're using uh strs which is special drawing rights now
[1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:44.440]  the japanese and several others are using them and um i they want to phase into a world
[1:36:45.080 --> 1:36:50.440]  currency and if they don't have any uh backing and gold it's just not going to work
[1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:55.800]  uh it's just another fiat currency just like strs are and so that's where they're headed
[1:36:55.800 --> 1:37:00.520]  with this thing now this isn't going to happen tomorrow morning but it is going to happen over
[1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:05.560]  the next two to three years if i had to put a time frame into it i'd say probably a year and a half
[1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:15.960]  to two and uh i think that what they're going to look for is when the dollar gets on the usdx
[1:37:15.960 --> 1:37:23.400]  which is an index weighted of six other currencies versus a dollar which is selling at around 77 right
[1:37:23.400 --> 1:37:33.720]  now uh down from a high of 124 uh when it gets down uh to 40 to 50 which i think it will over the
[1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:39.880]  next year and a half to two years uh then i think they'll make their move with the devaluation of
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:47.160]  all currencies or revaluation of currencies against one another and also accompanied by a major
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:54.280]  default by many countries including the united states which about one third of the debt will
[1:37:54.280 --> 1:37:59.720]  have to be paid off and the other two thirds will be done away with and that's where i think this
[1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:05.800]  whole thing is headed or at least that's the way they want it to head and that's what i think is
[1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:10.600]  in the future well there's two points that i want to hit on a little more extensively that you just
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:16.680]  talked about one the idea that these are the richest people in the world yet the dumb down public
[1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:21.400]  believes that bill gates is the richest man in the world followed by warren buffett and certainly
[1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:27.320]  those men are powerful and wealthy but they're really just tools of the real establishment the
[1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:33.400]  real elite let's speak to that and then on top of that we're talking sdr units in a global currency
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:39.320]  when they do announce this global currency outside of sdr units are we going to see this as a hard
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:46.280]  physical currency or just a fiat traded currency that that we won't see an actual bill or coin for
[1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:53.640]  well knowing them and knowing the status of the nation's gold wise they sold most of their gold
[1:38:53.640 --> 1:39:00.440]  off it will be without backing it will be another fiat currency and i don't think there's any question
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:07.320]  of that and it won't work any better than any of the other ones but i think it's going to be accompanied
[1:39:07.320 --> 1:39:17.720]  by a very deep depression and i think that the turmoil that's going to come from that may upset
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:24.520]  set their plans and as you saw in montana and you reported with alex on the air that's the tape i saw
[1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:30.360]  this morning uh... they are already in their responsible for this putting these criminals
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:36.840]  into the united states nothing but mercenary murderers and uh... and they expect to do that
[1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:43.080]  all over the country and then use that against the people absolutely and how shocking is it
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:49.880]  that you know number one we have somebody with seventeen plus aliases multiple felony convictions
[1:39:49.880 --> 1:39:57.560]  over a million dollars in lawsuits lost and unpaid and open warrant in wyoming and this is the guy
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:03.480]  that's going to head up the privatized prison system that was first built in two thousand and seven
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:10.760]  this is insanity well this is the kind of people that they attract and uh... because of the the
[1:40:10.760 --> 1:40:16.600]  criminals work very good with criminals and the people in banking wall street the power behind
[1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:23.640]  all of the of the illuminati is the european heads of of royal families called the black
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:29.240]  nobility and uh... they've been in charge of it probably since the uh... fourteen century
[1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:37.960]  and uh... uh... they are the ones who hire these types of people and once they've done their job
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:44.360]  to get rid of them they eliminate them and uh... so you're going to find a lot of very very bad
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:49.720]  people uh... who are going to be in groups like this including backwell blackwater i mean they're
[1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:55.320]  no lilies of the valley either and uh... these are people that uh... the american military
[1:40:55.320 --> 1:41:01.640]  are going to have to take out well i hope it does actually come to get come to that but when we
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:09.000]  expand our u.s military forces overseas in illegal conflicts such as afghanistan and iraq and now we
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:16.760]  continue to beat the drums against iran and now they're ramping up again privatized uh... foreign
[1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:22.200]  mercenary services in this country it seems that that's the plan let's bring the foreign
[1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:27.400]  mercenaries into this country let's bring the nato troops let's bring the people that will be more
[1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:33.880]  apt to pull guns on the american populace in quarantine situations and emergencies and
[1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:39.960]  let's dispel our u.s military overseas so they can't defend the constitution and bill of rights
[1:41:41.080 --> 1:41:46.200]  well there's an answer to that and that is this there's going to be a certain amount of military
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:51.800]  in the united states and it's up to the american citizens to go to the military and say i'm at
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:58.120]  your service i've got my own weapons i've been trained you just tell me what unit you want me
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:04.520]  in and give me a uniform well i hope that the the military really makes a million veterans in the
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:11.560]  united states of jason 40 million of them been in combat there's 450 million weapons in the united
[1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:17.720]  states these people are going to get a total lesson that they'll never forget it's just like the
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:23.480]  japanese were asked after the war why didn't you invade the united states when you had the opportunity
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:29.080]  and they said well everybody's got a gun and they had to shoot it and so you know they they figure
[1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:34.840]  that and he said no we don't want to tangle with that well the illuminati wants to tangle with it
[1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:39.880]  and not only is it going to cost the lives of the mercenaries it's going to cost them their own lives
[1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:44.840]  well you know the u.s supreme court is set to rule on the second amendment coming up that's
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:47.880]  making headlines everywhere what what do you expect to see out of that
[1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:56.600]  um i think uh probably dead uh the people who have guns will be able to keep them
[1:42:57.880 --> 1:43:01.720]  well i i hope that we are and i hope that they don't restrict our firearms
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:06.200]  any further but we know what their plan is and we know they like to encroach on our freedoms
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:11.960]  incrementally so we'll be keeping a close eye on that you know as the economy continues to falter
[1:43:11.960 --> 1:43:17.240]  as the dollar continues to drop the last time i checked it against the s dr or special drawing
[1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:22.120]  rights unit and for you know listeners out there that don't believe that there's already world currency
[1:43:22.120 --> 1:43:27.960]  just type in s dr conversion rate into google and you'll be able to see the conversion rate of the
[1:43:27.960 --> 1:43:33.560]  s dr across the board on all the other currencies out there the last time i checked the dollar was
[1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:43.080]  somewhere between 60 and 67 cents to or 60 or 67 units compared to one or 0.67 to one s dr so i
[1:43:43.080 --> 1:43:49.080]  would say it's only you know it's about two-thirds the value of one s dr yet we've seen gold shoot
[1:43:49.080 --> 1:43:54.440]  up i believe it's over a thousand dollars at this point silver also doing well tell us about that
[1:43:55.720 --> 1:44:01.160]  well the government uh had to the treasury department the working group and financial
[1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:08.840]  markets uh the february sir uh they uh have been holding gold down here at about a thousand but
[1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:13.560]  they don't have the physical to depress the market and so every day they come in and they
[1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:18.280]  battle with using derivatives and and also in the futures exchange and they're going to lose
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:25.480]  it's only a matter of time before gold moves higher and where anyway between 1200 and 1700
[1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:31.320]  dollars an ounce and i think that's eminent i don't think that's far away and i think if i'm
[1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:37.400]  right in it let's say it went to 16 or 1700 which is very possible out of the technical
[1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:43.560]  formation it's in right now and i would say that there's a chance next year that it could
[1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:51.400]  not go up to 2500 to 3000 that possibility exists so gold is going to be a dynamite investment a way
[1:44:51.400 --> 1:44:56.920]  of protecting your wealth probably the only way gold and silver well tell people how they can make
[1:44:56.920 --> 1:45:02.760]  that investment today and tell them about your newsletter well the international forecasters

[1:45:44.280 --> 1:45:50.520]  discuss how the public is being more and more acclimated to military and military style troops
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:55.240]  on the street you know i went down and i covered the g20 in pittsburgh with another
[1:45:55.240 --> 1:46:02.040]  couple info warriors here in the office and they locked down the entire downtown area of pittsburgh
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:08.200]  with humvees and national guard units at every bridge at every street corner and when i went
[1:46:08.200 --> 1:46:12.360]  up to them and i was filming them some sometimes with cindy she hand who would approach them and
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:17.640]  say you know my son died for this this is disturbing this is disgusting and i would ask them you know
[1:46:17.640 --> 1:46:23.320]  what do you have to say to critics that would say that this is a violation of posi cometatus
[1:46:23.320 --> 1:46:28.840]  and i was talking to you know people who were the freshest in the military 18 year old kids to people
[1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:34.440]  who were 40 and 50 years old sometimes even older than that who had you know all sorts of military
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:40.680]  experience and not one of them not one of them could even tell me what that was bob well that's
[1:46:40.680 --> 1:46:48.920]  understandable among the ranks unfortunately you don't get a lot of high IQs and so these people
[1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:54.840]  you know they do their job which is to function as an arm of the united states government and the
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:47:01.160]  president and they don't know very much about anything you will occasionally find people
[1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:09.000]  in certain units that do but more often than not know and the officerial of a core of course
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:15.480]  uh if you address them uh they might have smiled and said uh well i'd rather not speak about that
[1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:20.840]  but i understand what you're talking about and so they just don't know but on the other hand jason
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:28.760]  we're looking at half the population in america is functionally illiterate and so
[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:35.800]  you know you can't expect probably more than one third to even have a wild idea of what you're
[1:47:35.800 --> 1:47:43.240]  talking about so sad it really really is so every country's in the same boat they all have
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:50.520]  functional illiteracy that's terrible and i'm talking you know our ours is uh about 51 percent
[1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:58.200]  canada's is 40 40 percent i mean germany's is 40 percent the educational systems in all these
[1:47:58.200 --> 1:48:05.480]  countries have been degenerated unbelievably well we see it when we you know talk to people
[1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:09.400]  and they can't tell us what the three branches of government are but they can tell us about
[1:48:09.400 --> 1:48:15.240]  david letterman's affair uh you know we are so mesmerized and hypnotized by the box that talks
[1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:20.600]  to us in night in our living rooms that we just don't seem to take an interest in what's going on
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:26.920]  in the streets of our own country and you know out of the washington times today dhs is deploying
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:34.280]  el rad weapons to police departments around the country again furthering the militarization
[1:48:34.280 --> 1:48:40.760]  of our police force bob i saw the article and i and in it's there i carry it in tomorrow's
[1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:47.000]  international forecaster which keeps on getting bigger and bigger in fact i carry more links
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.400]  now than i ever did before because there's so much going on out there and i don't want to miss
[1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:56.040]  anything and i know everybody doesn't have the time to read the whole thing each time it comes
[1:48:56.040 --> 1:49:01.320]  but that's okay go through and pick out what appeals to you and things that you see that you
[1:49:01.320 --> 1:49:07.960]  want to know about absolutely all right so they're now admitting that the jobless rate is at nine
[1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:13.400]  point eight percent what do you think the true and real numbers are at this point well all you
[1:49:13.400 --> 1:49:19.640]  have to do is take u six which is sixteen point eight percent the last figure i got and um that
[1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:24.520]  includes that short term unemployment you just mentioned and all the people who are no longer
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:29.960]  getting state checks for unemployment uh all the people who are working part time which is almost
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:36.440]  10 million people the average work week week now is 33.1 hours at the last time i saw it
[1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:43.080]  and uh also we have the discouraged people who have gone out and for a year and a half or two
[1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:47.960]  or try to get a job and it just isn't any and so they've just given up so that's what comprises
[1:49:47.960 --> 1:49:55.240]  that sixteen point eight percent u six but there's another thing in there called the birth death ratio
[1:49:55.240 --> 1:50:01.880]  and it was something created in two 003 and the government said we don't have time to go out and
[1:50:01.880 --> 1:50:06.360]  check on all those small and medium sized companies so we're going to guess at it well of course they
[1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:15.400]  always guess in their own direction and they average about creating about 185,000 jobs a month
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:23.960]  and so and that's on average and so if you take that out of u six because it's a Mickey Mouse figure
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:31.640]  it's 21 percent unemployment that's one in every five people in this country with no job unbelievable
[1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:38.440]  unbelievable but we've got to get a lot worse yeah we continue to slide down this path of
[1:50:38.440 --> 1:50:45.880]  establishment tyranny of mindlessness of everything's going to be okay everything's not going to be
[1:50:45.880 --> 1:50:51.160]  okay unless we step up to the plate and hold our leaders accountable and try to bring the constitution
[1:50:51.160 --> 1:50:56.040]  and bill of rights back from the brink of extension we'll be back after this it's the alex joneshow

[1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:34.440]  sitting in peter dale scott coming up in the next segment in studio we're sitting here with bob
[1:54:34.440 --> 1:54:41.000]  chatman uh mr chatman in this final segment why don't you just wrap up in a nutshell what is the
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:47.560]  most important thing that the american populace needs to know at this point i think they know
[1:54:47.560 --> 1:54:52.760]  i should know and they should get after their senators and congressmen to make sure we passed
[1:54:52.760 --> 1:55:01.080]  hr 1207 and investigate and audit the fed reserve and then ultimately get rid of it it's the the home
[1:55:01.800 --> 1:55:08.520]  the nexus of the illuminati this is the core of which they operate from and if we can we can
[1:55:08.520 --> 1:55:16.280]  separate that and get rid of it we can move towards solving some of the problems there's a big move
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:21.640]  afoot right now to as i said earlier in the program to replace the dollar there's no question now
[1:55:22.280 --> 1:55:27.800]  people in order to protect themselves have to be in gold and silver related assets what's
[1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:34.920]  going to happen next year half of the stimulus packages been spent and my guess is most of it
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:41.640]  will be gone into the economy by next june so the second half of next year will see the remainder
[1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:48.200]  of the effect and after that if they don't inject another two trillion stimulus into the economy
[1:55:48.200 --> 1:55:53.720]  or banks can crease their lending which is off about 14 percent from last year if both of them
[1:55:53.720 --> 1:56:00.440]  don't do that the economy is going to spiral into a deflationary mode now what do i think is
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:05.720]  going to happen i think we're going to get another stimulus package and i predicted that last january
[1:56:05.720 --> 1:56:10.440]  because i you know i did all the numbers and i said this isn't going to work for them and so
[1:56:10.440 --> 1:56:14.440]  that's where we're headed with these things getting rid of the federal reserve is the
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:22.280]  number one thing we can do and besides that we should get as many people as we can to listen
[1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:27.560]  to alex's show so they'll understand what's going on fresh right to the moment and of course my
[1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:34.760]  publication which follows it up a couple of days later and uh for those who can't see that they can
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:41.080]  read anyway uh those are the most important things what do you think about this word that the fdic
[1:56:41.080 --> 1:56:45.720]  is asking for a bailout i saw that a couple weeks ago and i had just forgotten to cover it i mean
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:53.480]  what happens if the fdic gets a bailout well the first of all they broke uh they've asked the the
[1:56:53.480 --> 1:56:59.800]  banks for a uh increase uh of dues for that over the next two years to get it now i don't think
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:05.720]  that's doable and uh they're going to have to go to the government uh for five hundred billion
[1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:13.880]  and uh and they'll be subsidized just like fanny freddy jenny fha and all of these other agencies
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:21.080]  and uh just to put that line of all the deposits under two hundred fifty thousand dollars to cover
[1:57:21.080 --> 1:57:28.120]  one percent of those of those deposits which are supposedly insured will cost seven hundred billion
[1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:33.720]  dollars so let's say that the the u.s. government gave them seven hundred billion i mean they're
[1:57:33.720 --> 1:57:38.680]  going to be that's one percent of what they need i mean half the banks in this country are going to
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:45.240]  go down it certainly appears that way between thirty two and forty two hundred are going down
[1:57:46.600 --> 1:57:52.040]  bob jabin of the international forecaster dot com i mean if you're listening folks it's time to
[1:57:52.040 --> 1:57:57.640]  take action any word when this will hit the senate we know that uh 1207 has passed through congress
[1:57:57.640 --> 1:58:04.520]  when is it up for uh the senate well i think it's uh up to the senate itself and we need some great
[1:58:04.520 --> 1:58:12.600]  support there uh the last i saw we had 23 cosponses we need everybody to contact every senator and
[1:58:12.600 --> 1:58:23.960]  just say we want you to pass uh sp 604 i think it is and uh and we want that uh to get passed and
[1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:29.560]  i think you'll do a great deal of good by doing that because they do listen bob jabin thank you so

[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:20.360]  i've been following for years and years and years somebody i followed even before alex jones i uh
[2:01:20.360 --> 2:01:25.400]  came across him talking about his initial publication the war conspiracy i believe that
[2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:33.000]  was back in 1972 he's an author he's a poet and in my mind he's a genius uh peter dale scott how
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:39.080]  are you today sir i'm very happy to be here you and your fine new studio well thank you very much
[2:01:39.880 --> 2:01:44.440]  why don't you just give people that don't know who you are who are not familiar with you um you
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:49.400]  know what your background is what your work has been i mean you've done so much you've done work on
[2:01:49.400 --> 2:01:56.200]  you know rfk jfk mlk assassinations extensive work on the continuity of government programs
[2:01:56.200 --> 2:02:03.880]  extensive work into deep politics in 9 11 just a huge body of work yes well actually all this time
[2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:09.640]  in until i retired i was a professor of english so the question is why would i get into these other
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:15.240]  fields the answer is that before that i was a i'm a canadian and i was a diplomat for the
[2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:24.520]  canadian government and i had just enough exposure to indochina in the 1950s to be a very early uh
[2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:29.000]  advocate that america should not make the mistake of the french and go into vietnam
[2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:36.520]  and then in researching uh what was wrong the reasons why we shouldn't go into vietnam uh i
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:44.760]  became aware of the kennedy's decision to pull troops out which was made in october 63 and then
[2:02:44.760 --> 2:02:53.560]  reversed the weekend that he was killed uh by incoming president johnson and so that got me
[2:02:53.560 --> 2:03:00.600]  inevitably interested in the kennedy assassination and from all of that i've just uh you know for
[2:03:00.600 --> 2:03:05.800]  those of you who are old enough to remember the 60s you it was a terrible decade because
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:12.520]  bobby kennedy was killed martin luther king was killed there were some other minor assassinations
[2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:22.280]  too and uh so i at the time is to talk about that my specialty was researching parapolitics
[2:03:22.280 --> 2:03:28.440]  and now i usually use the term deep politics which is a seems to have taken a term which will
[2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:34.920]  outlast me i think people will continue to talk about it and i have a book by that title um
[2:03:35.640 --> 2:03:44.120]  so that is uh and and i've continued to study it because i have my conviction that if you study
[2:03:44.120 --> 2:03:52.040]  all of these suppressed events uh you find certain elements in common uh by knowing more about the
[2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:59.560]  kennedy assassination it prepares you in a way to be able to study 9-11 and i know that's a
[2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:10.360]  not idea but i have a a book that's the revised issue a reissue of the work conspiracy lays out
[2:04:10.360 --> 2:04:15.080]  the case for saying that those two events have something in common is that back in publication

[2:08:07.160 --> 2:08:14.760]  we are back it's the alex jones show i'm joined by peter dale scott in studio real treat for me
[2:08:14.760 --> 2:08:19.720]  and during the break we we were just discussing this uh michael hilton character and uh you
[2:08:19.720 --> 2:08:25.800]  were just discussing how you looked into the crest and how this was the crest of montanegro
[2:08:25.800 --> 2:08:33.560]  well actually serbia serbia is it can the camera pick this up absolutely um this this code of arms
[2:08:33.560 --> 2:08:41.240]  was the code of arms of the obranovic family who were the rulers the kings of serbia down until
[2:08:41.240 --> 2:08:48.600]  1903 when the last one was i think assassinated and then you got the carer george of itches
[2:08:49.320 --> 2:08:57.240]  who were the kings up until world war two the only surviving line of that family are the people
[2:08:57.240 --> 2:09:04.120]  who call themselves the princes of montanegro and this george this hilton michael hilton was really
[2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:11.000]  michael jokovic is apparently from montanegro so for some reason the you know if you have it
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:19.560]  that's an imperial double eagle a sign of empire and here is a king uh it's a sign a crown is a
[2:09:19.560 --> 2:09:26.840]  sign of monarchy what's that doing on the side of a police car in hardened montan which isn't
[2:09:26.840 --> 2:09:31.720]  really a police car i mean they're saying they're american police force well they're not american
[2:09:31.720 --> 2:09:37.160]  they're not a police force and the guy heading this up is a multiple felon with over now the
[2:09:37.160 --> 2:09:42.760]  yesterday was a dozen aliases now they're reporting 17 aliases plus did you ever see
[2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:47.640]  this coming in our country did you ever think we'd be at a time where prisons are set up they're
[2:09:47.640 --> 2:09:51.480]  going to be run by foreign mercenaries and they're going to be training foreign troops it's it's
[2:09:51.480 --> 2:09:58.600]  nightmarish and foreigners are resting americans in america and also the part of it that really
[2:09:58.600 --> 2:10:08.360]  scares me is the outsourcing of the job of spying on americans that's now being handled by private
[2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:18.200]  companies i did an article about this recently science applications and sa s a i c uh they
[2:10:18.200 --> 2:10:24.920]  are composed of veterans of intelligence but they're a private corporation with a contract to
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:32.600]  various departments of the u.s government and they've been assigned the job of correlating
[2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:40.840]  the job of spying on americans so there are these special stations set up all over america where
[2:10:40.840 --> 2:10:49.320]  members of army counterintelligence sit in the same office with members of s a i c private
[2:10:49.320 --> 2:10:56.280]  people spying on us i you know i went all through the vietnam war and i knew my phone was tapped
[2:10:56.280 --> 2:11:03.640]  and i knew that my mail was odd things happened to my mail and it didn't particularly bother me
[2:11:03.640 --> 2:11:11.160]  because uh i like this country i'm not even an american i'm a canadian but i like america and
[2:11:11.160 --> 2:11:16.440]  i sort of wanted them to know what i was doing because i was not planning to put bombs anywhere
[2:11:16.440 --> 2:11:25.480]  and i would prefer that they knew that uh but i'm very uncomfortable that the job of watching me
[2:11:25.480 --> 2:11:30.760]  is now being handed out to private corporations because they really have you know they have a
[2:11:30.760 --> 2:11:39.160]  profit motive uh the uh one of the things that went wrong in iraq this same company s a i c
[2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:45.880]  was given the job of finding out whether there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq or not
[2:11:45.880 --> 2:11:51.880]  and it was big business for them to report yes there is because that meant more contracts and more
[2:11:51.880 --> 2:12:00.360]  money and of course this was one of the biggest intelligence fiascos of of of the last uh well
[2:12:00.360 --> 2:12:06.840]  50 years probably because we waged a whole war on the pretext of the weapons of mass destruction
[2:12:06.840 --> 2:12:13.240]  which absolutely weren't there when they went to look for them so the uh bush administration
[2:12:13.240 --> 2:12:20.520]  set up a committee to find out what went wrong and they put all the s a i c people on the committee
[2:12:20.520 --> 2:12:28.360]  so obviously they were unable to find or they they they failed to report that s a i c had been a
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:34.920]  big part of the problem that's what's wrong with privatizing intelligence because a profit motive
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:41.960]  is going to skew the intelligence and the same thing with privatizing uh security uh you know
[2:12:41.960 --> 2:12:49.320]  these i i don't know who was really responsible for stirring up trouble in pittsburgh i mean
[2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:57.400]  time after time after time you have preset peaceful protests which are then broken up in a violent way
[2:12:57.400 --> 2:13:04.840]  by the people whose nominal job is to prevent violence but they have a stake uh as private
[2:13:04.840 --> 2:13:10.440]  corporations in uh prolonging the violence that they're supposed to be stopping well we're talking
[2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:14.920]  about even the el rad weapons that they used at this thing the long range acoustical devices we
[2:13:14.920 --> 2:13:22.280]  find out today uh the washington times dhs helps local police nationwide by military style sonic
[2:13:22.280 --> 2:13:27.480]  devices this is huge business for the military industrial complex that eisenhower warned us
[2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:33.000]  about on his exit from the presidency this is them really coming into fruition and you talked about
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:39.560]  private security firms spying on the american people we know through the lawsuit hepting versus
[2:13:39.560 --> 2:13:46.520]  atn t that atn t and other companies had secret rooms where they split off all the information
[2:13:46.520 --> 2:13:49.880]  everything that went through a data cable everything that went through your cell phone
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:55.800]  was then hard lined into a database now i'm not saying that that's all tracked through human eyes
[2:13:55.800 --> 2:14:02.440]  but it is sent through uh systems like carnivore and promise and they look for key words key phrases
[2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:08.360]  in essence they're spying on the american people 24 7 and i wonder if anyone is really
[2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:15.160]  thought through the consequences what happened in pittsburgh is is really very very disturbing
[2:14:15.160 --> 2:14:21.720]  because it's it's like uh serving notice the american people that the age of peaceful protest is over
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:28.040]  if you go to a peaceful demonstration you risk losing your hearing from this el rad which is
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:37.160]  a monster i mean you know in 1984 orwell didn't have the imagination to foresee some of the
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:44.360]  things that we now have in place here and uh you know i have very mainstream friends who were
[2:14:45.080 --> 2:14:51.960]  people who never protested in their lives but are extremely upset that the this kind of yes you as
[2:14:51.960 --> 2:15:00.280]  you say it's big business and uh and uh you know if people can't protest peacefully uh well i don't
[2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:06.920]  want to advise on what to do because but but but i wouldn't personally prefer that people protested
[2:15:06.920 --> 2:15:13.080]  peacefully absolutely then be driven to other forms of protest because peaceful protest is now
[2:15:13.080 --> 2:15:18.280]  past history in this country yeah and i went down i actually covered on the ground the pittsburgh g20
[2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:23.240]  i was there they locked down all of downtown pittsburgh it was absolutely impossible to get there
[2:15:23.240 --> 2:15:29.080]  they had humvees with uh military forces the national guard came in uh it was a 19 million
[2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:35.240]  dollar project i had covered every single one of the quote-unquote protests or out of control riots
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:41.480]  and i had not seen the force that they used uh just the amount of force ever what they used on
[2:15:41.480 --> 2:15:45.480]  friday night after the g20 you know it was less than i don't know if you've seen the videos yet
[2:15:45.480 --> 2:15:51.400]  but there were less than 200 peaceful protesters in shenley plaza right i have seen some of them
[2:15:51.400 --> 2:15:56.760]  yeah all the ones i see in the camera ends up sort of going crazy and photographing this because
[2:15:56.760 --> 2:16:02.040]  you're running running over their lives yeah you're you know i don't want to press yeah yeah you
[2:16:02.040 --> 2:16:06.120]  don't want a rubber bullet in the eye you lose your hearing you know people are getting hit with
[2:16:06.120 --> 2:16:11.400]  tear gas canisters and lrad weapons and i was threatened with arrest several times i was grabbed
[2:16:11.400 --> 2:16:15.720]  by one of the riot police i'm the only person there literally the protesters are a couple hundred
[2:16:15.720 --> 2:16:20.920]  feet away from me and all's i'm doing is filming the line of military police that are out there
[2:16:20.920 --> 2:16:25.960]  and it's just unbelievable you can't be here i get charged by one i get grabbed by another they
[2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:31.800]  reach for the plastic cuffs and then uh rob dew who you've been talking with all morning he was
[2:16:31.800 --> 2:16:37.480]  actually detained now they showed them the press pass and they said no and uh detained them anyway
[2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:41.880]  and when we were calling to try to get these guys out they said no there's a different process for
[2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:47.000]  protesters now this is the first time in this country that they detained over a hundred peaceful
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:51.560]  protesters took their digital fingerprints and didn't charge them with anything it used to be in
[2:16:51.560 --> 2:16:55.480]  this country you had to be charged with the crime they would take your fingerprints but if you are
[2:16:55.480 --> 2:16:59.720]  found innocent of that crime you got that information back these people weren't charged with anything
[2:16:59.720 --> 2:17:05.480]  right it's it's unbelievable they're obviously databaseing the dissidents you know to try to
[2:17:05.480 --> 2:17:11.000]  quench us from using our free speech like you said they wanted it's a deterrent thing they want to
[2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:15.960]  say to people you go out and be part of a peaceful protest and you don't know what's going to happen
[2:17:15.960 --> 2:17:24.120]  to you so stay away and and that's uh it's it's and and and i just don't see any opposition to it
[2:17:24.120 --> 2:17:31.000]  and i didn't see you know the mainstream media are are writing themselves into the history books by
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:37.720]  their refusal to face these big new issues that are coming up in this country absolutely and you've
[2:17:37.720 --> 2:17:42.280]  been one who was very critical of the bush administration you've gone beyond the left and
[2:17:42.280 --> 2:17:47.960]  right paradigm you know that this is you know one control group one establishment so you've
[2:17:47.960 --> 2:17:54.280]  been pretty critical of the obama administration as well i want to get into how they've really advanced
[2:17:54.280 --> 2:18:00.120]  uh the program how they've advanced continuity of government how they've advanced uh you know
[2:18:00.120 --> 2:18:06.920]  presidential privileges and how you know this is and these are executive orders this is not a
[2:18:06.920 --> 2:18:11.320]  government for and by the people anymore we really don't have the system of checks and balances that
[2:18:11.320 --> 2:18:15.800]  this country was found on that's why we have the three different branches of government that's why
[2:18:15.800 --> 2:18:20.440]  you know congress is supposed to have oversight we don't see that anymore in this country i think
[2:18:20.440 --> 2:18:27.560]  there's a crucial issue which is uh i hope everybody in listening this program knows that uh
[2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:35.320]  for 20 years rumsfeld and cheney were planning something called continuity of government measures
[2:18:35.320 --> 2:18:41.720]  originally this was a quite legitimate activity what happens if there's an atomic attack and
[2:18:41.720 --> 2:18:49.400]  and what washington is hit by a nuclear weapon and we don't have we are decapitated we don't
[2:18:49.400 --> 2:18:56.440]  have a government anymore but cheney and rumsfeld changed it so it was planning to deal with any
[2:18:56.440 --> 2:19:03.160]  emergency and they got an executive order passed under reagan which redefined uh the purpose of
[2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:09.800]  c o g was to deal with any emergency and the amazing thing is these two people went on planning for
[2:19:09.800 --> 2:19:15.320]  or in effect the suspension of the american constitution that's what it's been called
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:22.520]  when neither of them were in the government but they were in the continuity of government
[2:19:22.520 --> 2:19:28.920]  and you know they were in this special thing that was set up under reagan back in 1981 by a secret
[2:19:28.920 --> 2:19:37.320]  order and there's one biography of rumsfeld that suggests that clinton didn't even know what was
[2:19:37.320 --> 2:19:44.120]  going on and uh the people who were planning it originally they were democrats and republicans
[2:19:44.120 --> 2:19:48.680]  but in the nineties they were all republicans hold that thought we're going to be back right
[2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:53.240]  after this i do cover a lot of this in my film fabled enemies the revamping of the continuity

[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:20.360]  planet dot tv members is peter dale scott and we were just talking about this continuity of
[2:24:20.360 --> 2:24:25.080]  government program which is the shadow government tell us how this integrates into the new obama
[2:24:25.080 --> 2:24:31.000]  administration continuity of government c o g is a concept that everybody every american should
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:38.520]  know about because it is a plan for it's supposed to be temporary suspension of the constitution
[2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:45.960]  and as i wrote in my book the road to nine eleven it was instituted for the first time
[2:24:45.960 --> 2:24:52.280]  on the morning before ten o'clock on the morning of september the eleventh two thousand one in
[2:24:52.280 --> 2:24:59.560]  response to these attacks now that might have been an understandable response to an attack
[2:24:59.560 --> 2:25:05.400]  which they still didn't know the limits of but that was codified into the declaration of a state
[2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:13.960]  of emergency on three days later on september the fourteenth and there is a law which says
[2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:20.280]  that these things have to be renewed and so bush renewed it as late as the fall of two thousand
[2:25:20.280 --> 2:25:28.760]  and eight and then i am another dan hamburg a former congressman we started a campaign
[2:25:28.760 --> 2:25:37.880]  that obama should end this once and for all and he had let us down he renewed it just this last
[2:25:37.880 --> 2:25:45.160]  month he's renewed it again and this is a plan we don't even know what it means congressman
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:55.320]  defazio back in 2007 when he saw that bush had again he was on the homeland security committee
[2:25:55.320 --> 2:26:01.480]  so he and he saw that there were certain secret orders and he was on the oversight subcommittee
[2:26:01.480 --> 2:26:06.760]  that should have seen those orders so he asked to see them he was told that he didn't have the
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:13.480]  clearance to see them because cog has its own clearances this is why i think the report can't
[2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:19.160]  there are certain things that they the nine eleven report certain things that just can't talk about
[2:26:19.160 --> 2:26:25.400]  they can't find the certain orders because they were done at a higher level of clearance than the
[2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:32.600]  they they had to in order to write the report well his whole committee wasn't able to see them
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:39.800]  and uh but there's another part of the law and i feel like a voice in the wilderness here because
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:45.560]  nobody's picked up on this but it's right there in the law that if an emergency state of emergency
[2:26:45.560 --> 2:26:54.600]  is declared congress must review it within six months and either ratify the the state of emergency
[2:26:54.600 --> 2:27:02.360]  or close it down so as i say this ex congressman dan hamburg and i said well congress you've had
[2:27:02.360 --> 2:27:08.120]  eight years now and you're supposed to do it in six months so for heaven's sakes do it and we try
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:14.520]  to mobilize a campaign to get everyone to write to their congressman and uh one congressman wrote
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:22.360]  back and said well uh that provision of the law is no longer operative because it has been over
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:28.600]  written by guess what continuity of government well this is the whole issue of as you said three
[2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:35.400]  branches of government and checks and balances if you if if a small group of people two of
[2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:42.520]  whom are not even in the government can set up a new set of rules which are brought in under the
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:49.720]  shadow of this attack on september the eleventh and uh congress is told that they can't review it
[2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:56.680]  when the law says that they must review it uh we have a disturbing situation and when nobody in the
[2:27:56.680 --> 2:28:02.680]  media i say there's the mainstream media now we have the mainstream internet too and then we have
[2:28:02.680 --> 2:28:09.240]  people like you and me uh the mainstream internet has not picked up on this but this whole thing
[2:28:09.240 --> 2:28:17.320]  should be looked at and congress should uh first of all should find out what secret rules are being
[2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:22.360]  put in i mean somebody in congress should have the right to do that we have a intelligence
[2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:27.960]  committee that can look at what the cia is doing i would have thought that home and security would
[2:28:27.960 --> 2:28:34.280]  be the people who could see what are the secret rules to deal with home and security um this is
[2:28:34.280 --> 2:28:43.160]  i think a kind of line in the sand whether uh we're going to go on having a tripartite constitutional
[2:28:43.160 --> 2:28:47.800]  frame of government or not well unfortunately the dumb down public thinks that the shadow
[2:28:47.800 --> 2:28:51.480]  government is nothing more than something you would see in a james bond movie they don't even know
[2:28:51.480 --> 2:28:57.320]  that it exists mr scott and i mean that's just the reality well i think they see more and more
[2:28:57.320 --> 2:29:02.760]  they did what happened in pittsburgh for example that's that's not the american way of doing things
[2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:08.840]  you know you have a small group of peaceful protesters and these companies have these
[2:29:08.840 --> 2:29:15.400]  brand new weapons they want to try out and uh and uh you know members of the press getting
[2:29:15.400 --> 2:29:21.400]  arrested uh no i can't say arrested detain he was not booked right yeah no no not booked at all
[2:29:21.400 --> 2:29:29.320]  just detained um so that they can see that things are changing absolutely all right final segment

[2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:50.520]  forces are in the united states under the guise of american police force it's not american
[2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:56.280]  it's not a police force but we were just talking a little bit about cog and how that kind of
[2:33:56.280 --> 2:34:01.560]  intertwines into this government drug dealing and we talked about iran contra over the break
[2:34:01.560 --> 2:34:06.520]  why don't you tell people you know about oliver north revelations about continuity of government
[2:34:06.520 --> 2:34:12.520]  during iran right you know almost all that we know about continuity of government is actually
[2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:20.440]  goes back to the era when congress there was a congressional committee on iran contra and
[2:34:20.440 --> 2:34:27.320]  oliver north was a witness and a very good journalist alonzo charty wrote for the miami
[2:34:27.320 --> 2:34:36.520]  uh we're one of miami one herald yes for the miami herald an article he described it in some
[2:34:36.520 --> 2:34:42.360]  detail as a plan for the suspension of the constitution and congressman jack books from
[2:34:42.360 --> 2:34:51.000]  texas um it was on the committee and he asked oliver north on camera on television is it true
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:57.400]  that you have been working on plans to suspend the american constitution and the most amazing
[2:34:57.400 --> 2:35:03.800]  thing happened the the chairman of the committee who was a democrat senator anoye banged his gavel
[2:35:03.800 --> 2:35:09.720]  and said oh we can't go into that in an open session we have to go into that in a secret
[2:35:09.720 --> 2:35:18.120]  session thereby telling us all in effect that there was something there that was so sensitive
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:26.200]  that the american people couldn't hear about it and uh and it was amazing that the new york times
[2:35:26.200 --> 2:35:33.240]  had run printed every word of the hearings and they printed that exchange but they did a news
[2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:40.760]  story about what happened that day and didn't mention oliver north i mean the the idea that
[2:35:40.760 --> 2:35:46.840]  oliver north was doing something about suspending the american constitution was not in the news
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:53.160]  story or any other mainstream media news story that's where i really became for the first time
[2:35:53.160 --> 2:36:00.920]  aware of the increasing gap between what's going on at a deeper level what i call iran contra a
[2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:06.680]  deep event the kennedy assassination a deep event 9 11 a deep events we're just getting used to the
[2:36:06.680 --> 2:36:12.920]  effect that every now and then something happens that we're not going to get to the bottom of
[2:36:12.920 --> 2:36:19.640]  and what we have to be aware of is accumulatively these deep events are doing more to shape where
[2:36:19.640 --> 2:36:26.120]  the country is going than uh all the public debate that goes on in congress and that's
[2:36:26.120 --> 2:36:34.440]  particularly true of 9 11 it's we still haven't got to the bottom of it even the uh the chairman
[2:36:34.440 --> 2:36:41.240]  of it have had admitted that they didn't get proper intel uh information from the cia louis
[2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:47.240]  free who was head of the fb i at the time has said uh that is perfectly understandable that
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:54.840]  people would want a new investigation um and yet you we're not going to get a new investigation
[2:36:54.840 --> 2:37:02.680]  because it's a deep event but the most important constitutional event of this century to date has
[2:37:02.680 --> 2:37:12.040]  been the passing of c o g on the morning of september the 11th 2001 and it's it's barely
[2:37:12.040 --> 2:37:18.200]  reported anywhere the 9 11 report says yes it happened but we decided not to look into
[2:37:18.840 --> 2:37:25.800]  c o g they they admit in their report that it did happen and that they didn't investigate it
[2:37:25.800 --> 2:37:29.800]  it is shocking some other things that they've said you know uh lee hamilton and thomas keen
[2:37:29.800 --> 2:37:34.920]  did a book without precedent where they admitted that you know norad in the f a just lied to them
[2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:39.880]  and they said it was so far from the truth we don't know why they said what they did um i was
[2:37:39.880 --> 2:37:45.240]  actually one of the first people to get the norad tapes uh which had been vetted but you know the
[2:37:45.240 --> 2:37:50.840]  first person to go through 30 plus hours of audio over i think it was 21 separate channels and you
[2:37:50.840 --> 2:37:55.080]  listen to these things and they're talking about drills going on in fact you know in the movie
[2:37:55.080 --> 2:38:01.880]  fabled enemies i go over it they had to call into shayan mountain 20 minutes after flight 93
[2:38:01.880 --> 2:38:06.920]  had been downed and asked them to take the inputs out of their screens out of radar because they
[2:38:06.920 --> 2:38:11.640]  were getting even more hijacked oh my god yeah and you know when i i play the audio for you with
[2:38:11.640 --> 2:38:17.000]  them frantically calling into shayan mount tell them to take the inputs off and publicly we know
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  they were following delta 1989 which supposedly had a bomb on board they were uh following a Korean
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:28.200]  airlines plane out of alaska coming out about that one because it came down in canada yes that's
[2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:32.600]  right it did come down in canada before it was able to reach you know you read over and over and over
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:39.000]  that now not a single plane was brought down one plane was forced down it was forced down by the
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:44.040]  canadians who were not clued into whatever was happening well if you go and you check the fbis
[2:38:44.040 --> 2:38:49.080]  initial i believe it's uh team eight or team seven uh they've now released some documents where they
[2:38:49.080 --> 2:38:53.800]  would admit then they give you the tail numbers of not only the four hijacked planes but four more
[2:38:53.800 --> 2:38:59.320]  that they thought were hijacked on the morning of 9 11 so we we are so far from the truth on that
[2:38:59.320 --> 2:39:05.000]  very very deep event and it does warrant a new investigation and i'm hoping that the people

[2:39:58.040 --> 2:40:02.840]  if you want to use a firearm in the correct manner you know i was uh going through the news wires
[2:40:02.840 --> 2:40:08.520]  today this is just a side story i thought it was a great story but a five-year-old boy was able to
[2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:15.160]  shoot down in texas by the way out of houston an 800 pound alligator now all you people that want
[2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:20.520]  to disarm the american public if this child did not have a firearm guess what that 800 pound
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:25.160]  alligator probably would have eaten them so there are many reasons to arm yourself it's our second
[2:40:25.160 --> 2:40:29.720]  amendment right and you know peter dale scott alluded to it you know when they when peaceful
[2:40:29.720 --> 2:40:36.520]  protest is gone in this country what do we have left well you know uh jack mclam out there i'll tell
[2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:41.320]  you know we got the voting box and we've got the cartridge box and i really sincerely hope
[2:40:41.320 --> 2:40:45.240]  it never comes down to that cartridge box all right let's go to your calls
[2:40:45.240 --> 2:40:51.960]  steven in texas steven you're online yes yeah hey good afternoon jason great show thank you
[2:40:52.680 --> 2:40:58.520]  okay uh first of all uh so i'm following what i was telling you about yesterday um when i called
[2:40:58.520 --> 2:41:04.680]  out there to harden i talked to a lady in city hall um she said there wasn't anybody available
[2:41:04.680 --> 2:41:10.280]  from the city council but i specifically asked her and this is one thing i really think needs to be
[2:41:10.280 --> 2:41:16.600]  pushed uh because okay we're investigating who is this michael hilton who's the parent company
[2:41:16.600 --> 2:41:21.400]  i'll add and that's all important but i think the biggest issue and this is what i asked her about
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:28.360]  i said i understand that this is a detention center i said who are they planning on detaining
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:35.160]  who are they going to have you know that in for detention she would not answer my question
[2:41:35.720 --> 2:41:41.560]  and you know now they're saying no this isn't a guantanamo type deal well they're right it's not
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:47.000]  it's for me and you and if you think about it you know i thought it was really strange that
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:53.560]  becky shea actually took alex inside the facility you know why would they do that and this is obviously
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:42:00.040]  a femicamp i'll tell you what i believe personally number one okay try to quell the crowds and they're
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:06.040]  you know uh uproar about this but i think secondly this was a psych job that they were trying to on
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:11.000]  alex and you can ask him about this were they're sending him a subtle message saying mr jones
[2:42:11.560 --> 2:42:18.680]  welcome to what will ultimately be your home well let's hope that that's not the case but i do see
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:22.360]  where you could come to that conclusion and i thought it was very bizarre that they had that
[2:42:22.360 --> 2:42:29.320]  sign about the hostages outside of the premises that we read earlier on the show today uh if you
[2:42:29.320 --> 2:42:34.680]  saw the the local news report we're going to be playing that uh in an upcoming segment along with
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:41.400]  the uh pittsburgh video of them just gassing students who are on campus watching from a balcony
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:47.160]  believe it or not i mean it's there we can't deny it and i i sincerely hope you're wrong but when
[2:42:47.160 --> 2:42:52.440]  you have foreign mercenaries coming into this country who are multiple felons about to train
[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:57.960]  other foreign mercenary and military groups we have to ask these questions and by the way again
[2:42:57.960 --> 2:43:03.880]  we have to find out about this richard culver fellow is he really michael hildon's boss uh what has
[2:43:03.880 --> 2:43:11.640]  he done since he left as a colonel of the u.s army what are his connections who owns american police
[2:43:11.640 --> 2:43:17.320]  force which is neither american nor a police force but you know the whole deep ends the mystery deep
[2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:22.440]  ends and we need answers i thank you for the call steven as always let's go to betty in north
[2:43:22.440 --> 2:43:29.960]  carolina betty you're online hi jason glad to hear you again thank you um i wanted to let you know
[2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:38.520]  three things one um i'm getting the word out with the uh films i had bought and my podiatrist
[2:43:38.520 --> 2:43:43.480]  he's got four brothers that are doctors they're getting them out they've been getting reviewed
[2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:51.560]  back from him so that's neat secondly of all i went yesterday to the heart clinic get my heart
[2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:58.600]  checked they have a scan there i wasn't really paying attention i was half asleep and the lady
[2:43:58.600 --> 2:44:06.360]  there told me to wash my hands with sanitizer place my right hand on this uh machine and it's
[2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:10.680]  scanned my whole you know scanned everything yeah it's the new it's the new way that they take
[2:44:10.680 --> 2:44:15.800]  fingerprints and they database you they did this to rob do again no charges brought against him a
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:21.400]  different process for protesters it's the new digital way to get your biometric information
[2:44:21.400 --> 2:44:26.520]  and they're going to be doing this at your local health clinics at your checkups and of course by
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:32.680]  the police military and now these privatized security forces uh you know the control grid is
[2:44:32.680 --> 2:44:38.280]  ever encroaching and it is here i thank you for the call betty let's go to wilson in florida wilson
[2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:44.360]  you're on the line yes good afternoon jason i'm extremely delighted that you're filling in for
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:50.120]  alice because i love how you mix your intellect and you mind the same time well thank you i just
[2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:55.640]  wanted i wanted you to comment on me because i was actually thinking about joining the national
[2:44:55.640 --> 2:45:00.360]  guard because i'm a college student i just moved to florida and it's hard for me to for college i'm
[2:45:00.360 --> 2:45:05.880]  thinking about joining the national guard but at the same time i'm a devoted listener follower of all
[2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:11.240]  the news that you guys report so you think that's i'm kind of conflicted on this you know we need
[2:45:11.240 --> 2:45:15.720]  good people like yourself in the military absolutely and you can only help by being in the
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:19.880]  military however you know i don't want to put you in a position and i almost joined the national
[2:45:19.880 --> 2:45:25.560]  guard before i woke up i i'd taken the asfab tests i went with my buddy who did join the national
[2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:32.360]  guard and you know he ended up being deployed into iraq this is back in i believe 99 2000 and
[2:45:32.360 --> 2:45:37.000]  i was much like you you know i didn't have a lot of money i was going to college i'm like well you
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:42.040]  know it's a couple months a year and one weekend a month this is something that i can do it'll give
[2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:46.680]  me discipline it'll put me in better physical condition but is it really going to put us
[2:45:46.680 --> 2:45:52.360]  in better physical condition when they're mandating that you must take the h1n1 shot
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:58.200]  if you are indeed in the military national guard included and now you know some military personnel
[2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:04.120]  had protested taking a mandatory anthrax shot and that was just shot down that's about to go to the
[2:46:04.120 --> 2:46:09.160]  supreme court and i don't really have a lot of confidence that the supreme court is going to
[2:46:09.160 --> 2:46:15.720]  uphold you know an individual's freedom to say no to something that has again formaldehyde in it
[2:46:15.720 --> 2:46:22.200]  squalene and mercury so you know wilson i would say pick up a crappy part-time job i know it sucks
[2:46:22.200 --> 2:46:27.880]  flippin burgers i was a pizza guy for almost a decade find something else do yard work anything
[2:46:27.880 --> 2:46:33.640]  else do not join the military man i just i can't encourage people to do it again we need good people
[2:46:33.640 --> 2:46:38.200]  in the military but are you willing to put your health at risk and you know that's that's a soft
[2:46:38.200 --> 2:46:41.960]  kill weapon they could very well send you overseas and you could get a bullet through your head in
[2:46:41.960 --> 2:46:47.000]  afghanistan and iraq you've got to make the decision for yourself but i wouldn't recommend it thank you
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:54.520]  so much let's go to matt in california matt you're on the line yes sir hi i was just calling basically
[2:46:54.520 --> 2:46:59.800]  to uh see you guys to send out a message to a gun rights activists and people who want to send a
[2:46:59.800 --> 2:47:05.160]  second amendment across the country um in california i don't know if you guys are aware there's a bill
[2:47:05.160 --> 2:47:12.200]  that's on the governor's desk right now it's called ab 962 it's a mail order ammo ban uh for the state
[2:47:12.200 --> 2:47:18.840]  of california and there's also a another bill in the process that was uh put into legislation
[2:47:19.480 --> 2:47:27.640]  in uh san francisco from a senator out there and uh his name is marco well uh well i gotta tell you i
[2:47:27.640 --> 2:47:32.440]  am not aware of that but those seem like serious and real issues so if you could get those bill
[2:47:32.440 --> 2:47:37.160]  numbers down and just a brief synopsis of what they're all about links to the subsections
[2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:42.120]  that uh specifically talk about what you just said on air please send them to rob at info wars dot
[2:47:42.120 --> 2:47:48.040]  com articles at info wars dot com and writers at info wars dot com and hopefully we can get
[2:47:48.040 --> 2:47:52.520]  them up on the site and we'll be talking about them next week on the program or perhaps this
[2:47:52.520 --> 2:47:58.200]  weekend of course alex jones does his show four to six p.m central time and then i follow it up
[2:47:58.200 --> 2:48:03.320]  with a wrap up six to nine central time only at info wars dot com thank you so much for the
[2:48:03.320 --> 2:48:08.120]  call matt and please get that information to us ruth in louisiana ruth you're on the line
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:18.040]  yes um getting back to a different subject matter i would like to know what russia's take
[2:48:18.840 --> 2:48:25.960]  on us going into ireland it seems like it could spark up world war three i mean they don't want
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:31.640]  to see that at all and i wish that peter dale scott were here uh to answer that question is he's
[2:48:31.640 --> 2:48:37.240]  you know much more involved yeah that's how i think yeah in in these type of politics however
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:44.840]  you know i can say this the mainstream media continues to put out the myth that russia attacked
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:51.880]  georgia over a year ago russia's this evil giant russia's the new enemy when even the EU which is a
[2:48:51.880 --> 2:48:56.840]  globalist organization the european union is basically one of these globalist wet dreams that
[2:48:56.840 --> 2:49:02.040]  that has occurred this consolidation of power this move towards world government and even their
[2:49:02.040 --> 2:49:08.440]  investigation also concludes that south osetian irregular forces violated rules of war in attacks
[2:49:08.440 --> 2:49:14.680]  on georgian villages so what what they're saying is look georgia went in they're the ones that
[2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:19.880]  attacked russia wasn't going to attack and how did they do this they had drills going on on the
[2:49:19.880 --> 2:49:25.640]  border they were using israeli and american forces as well as blackwater types they go in
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:30.440]  then they blame it on russia then we beat the war drums against russia and how bad they are
[2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:35.480]  so i couldn't tell you but i i'm from from what i've seen their take is if we go into ireland
[2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:39.960]  this could spark world war three wefster tarpley talks about this a lot maybe we can get him on
[2:49:39.960 --> 2:49:44.600]  the program in the coming weeks to discuss it further thank you so much ruth let's go to nick
[2:49:44.600 --> 2:49:51.160]  in new york nick you're on the line yes good afternoon sir good afternoon i just got three
[2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:58.280]  simple questions if you may okay one where's the governor of montana that's a good question i don't
[2:49:58.280 --> 2:50:01.960]  think he's weighed in uh you know the attorney general has now weighed in they say that they're
[2:50:01.960 --> 2:50:06.280]  going to do a probe i'm not sure anybody's called the governor's office i would encourage people
[2:50:06.280 --> 2:50:13.000]  to do so go ahead nick second one where's the local county sheriff well that's that's the thing
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:18.520]  they're trying to disband the sheriff's department uh i don't know where the local county sheriff is
[2:50:18.520 --> 2:50:23.320]  but they have been trying to get rid of them because they say that he's they're unnecessary
[2:50:23.320 --> 2:50:28.440]  the town is small like alex said it's black and most of the town you know there's not a lot of
[2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:34.120]  lights around it's not like this is a 24 seven running city of this is a small small area what's
[2:50:34.120 --> 2:50:43.720]  the third question third question is i i just don't understand how you can use the authority
[2:50:43.720 --> 2:50:47.960]  of a county sheriff not under the well that's how you get rid of them nick you just say that
[2:50:47.960 --> 2:50:52.280]  they don't exist and we need a privatized police force unfortunately again this is the new america

[3:12:43.560 --> 3:12:49.160]  ryan you're online hey jason how you doing all right awesome glad to be with you i just found
[3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:53.160]  some information about two weeks ago i thought it might be interesting to call and let you know
[3:12:53.160 --> 3:12:58.760]  the rcmp in canada have actually been this is coming from someone who's a member of the clergy
[3:12:58.760 --> 3:13:03.000]  the police in canada have been preparing for a pandemic and apparently they've known about it for
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:08.280]  a very long time they've been going through training they've had conferences in ottawa all
[3:13:08.280 --> 3:13:13.320]  about the pandemic and how they're going to handle it i mean it's a bit weird don't you think that
[3:13:13.320 --> 3:13:17.240]  they're planning everything well you know they've talked about using schools and i mean not even
[3:13:17.240 --> 3:13:20.680]  talked about they've said they're going to use schools as mass vaccination centers but they're
[3:13:20.680 --> 3:13:25.640]  not going to stop there they figure that community centers and churches are another way to get mass
[3:13:25.640 --> 3:13:31.080]  gatherings of people and to take these vaccinations so it doesn't really shock me that they would use
[3:13:31.080 --> 3:13:36.120]  the clergy as we know about the clergy response teams for a couple of years now that will be
[3:13:36.120 --> 3:13:41.080]  working with departments like the department of homeland security here in this country so it really
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:46.840]  isn't a shock to me are they saying that they may use this as a a mass vaccination center somewhere
[3:13:46.840 --> 3:13:51.400]  where they may offer the vaccine i haven't really gotten a whole lot of information on it but i am
[3:13:51.400 --> 3:13:56.920]  still trying to to talk to the minister that was involved in this and we gotta be careful because a
[3:13:56.920 --> 3:14:01.800]  lot of these ministers and a lot of these priests and a lot of these clergymen are now on government
[3:14:01.800 --> 3:14:06.600]  payrolls and they're there to tell you to love the government do whatever they say they're here to
[3:14:06.600 --> 3:14:11.720]  help when we know it is the exact opposite keep doing your research and let me know as it develops
[3:14:11.720 --> 3:14:17.080]  thank you so much ryan let's jump to steward in new york steward you're on the line uh please
[3:14:17.080 --> 3:14:23.160]  to talk with you jason i'm just wondering and considering how vicious the pittsburgh police
[3:14:23.160 --> 3:14:30.760]  attacked so many innocent people and in regards to what's going on in montana with non-citizens
[3:14:30.760 --> 3:14:36.360]  i'm just wondering they're wearing these Darth Vader suits not for their own personal protection
[3:14:36.360 --> 3:14:42.520]  physically but more to uh disguise their identities i'm just wondering how many of these
[3:14:42.520 --> 3:14:47.880]  so-called police were really american citizens well i would say the majority of them were in
[3:14:47.880 --> 3:14:53.480]  actuality american citizens i didn't see a lot of foreigners out there but i did see a lot of
[3:14:53.480 --> 3:14:57.320]  blurring of the lines whether or not they were national guard or not let me give you an example
[3:14:57.320 --> 3:15:02.760]  the first uh riot police i saw were wearing regular riot police tops and uniforms but they
[3:15:02.760 --> 3:15:09.080]  were wearing military fatigues on the bottom uh when i went to the uh big concert out there for
[3:15:09.080 --> 3:15:14.760]  al gore and global warming and they took it a step further they were in full military garb
[3:15:14.760 --> 3:15:22.120]  in riot suits with the backwards american flag in a green patch and they had no police identification
[3:15:22.120 --> 3:15:28.200]  whatsoever and then that really prepped me for the next day when i outwardly saw just military i mean
[3:15:28.200 --> 3:15:34.200]  they were in full military garb uh admittedly national guard i did not i did see a lot of a
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:39.880]  foreign security forces in other words people in suits acting as secret service type agents in the
[3:15:39.880 --> 3:15:45.880]  hotels and downtown area but uh you know this time they they were able to use american citizens and
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:50.600]  a lot of these national guards men said you know i'll defend your right to free speech every day
[3:15:50.600 --> 3:15:55.480]  while they're in riot gear on the streets uh shooting tear gas at people and with that with
[3:15:55.480 --> 3:16:01.000]  that said we're going to go to that video of the uh young people at the college if we can bring that
[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:07.560]  up uh jaren and who's of uh the the incident at pittsburgh on friday night when these these kids
[3:16:07.560 --> 3:16:12.440]  are on a balcony when the cops start shooting off rubber bullets they start shooting off the
[3:16:12.440 --> 3:16:18.840]  tear gas canisters and they actually go into the building and up the stairs onto this balcony
[3:16:18.840 --> 3:16:23.400]  and corner all these kids that are now being tear gas so let's go to that video then we're
[3:16:23.400 --> 3:16:29.160]  going to continue with your calls michael scott dan scott and gary uh right after this so let's
[3:16:29.160 --> 3:16:45.080]  hit that that clip right now
[3:16:50.040 --> 3:16:53.880]  and i mean you're really looking at something like out of the science fiction movie
[3:16:53.880 --> 3:17:00.440]  all these protesters are mostly college students there are no anarchists amongst them not one
[3:17:00.440 --> 3:17:05.080]  anarchist and there you see the flashes there you see the tear gas canisters you hear the
[3:17:05.080 --> 3:17:09.000]  rubber bullets going off right now you're watching it on prison planet dot tv one of
[3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:14.840]  the protesters throws one back at them but it's a moot point they're all wearing gas masks
[3:17:14.840 --> 3:17:20.760]  here's where it gets really really scary the kids that are on the balcony they think they're safe
[3:17:20.760 --> 3:17:27.160]  they're not tear gas to come up the stairwells yes they're inside
[3:17:27.160 --> 3:17:45.960]  and here they are being tear gas as the riot police pass them up the stairwell
[3:17:45.960 --> 3:17:47.400]  and corner now
[3:17:56.120 --> 3:17:59.720]  it's just unbelievable we're going to pull the clip because there is some obscenities that

[3:25:51.240 --> 3:25:56.600]  the crossfire is apf spokesperson becky shea who spent all day answering questions from media
[3:25:56.600 --> 3:26:02.040]  members and the public after an ap story linked the security firm's leader michael hilton to
[3:26:02.040 --> 3:26:07.640]  multiple bankruptcies and convictions for more than a dozen felonies there were no surprises

[3:26:15.080 --> 3:26:20.280]  vice president al peterson both say they knew about the convictions long before the report came out

[3:26:28.280 --> 3:26:33.720]  declined an on-camera interview but released this statement saying quote i believe that the tora
[3:26:33.720 --> 3:26:39.080]  has a better chance of getting the detention facility open with apf than with any montana
[3:26:39.080 --> 3:26:45.640]  officials what do we have to lose if it doesn't work out end quote apf also continues to stand firm
[3:26:45.640 --> 3:26:52.440]  on its stance to not release the parent company that information won't be disclosed but mires and
[3:26:52.440 --> 3:26:58.280]  others like her pledge to continue their research they're putting in a criminal to watch criminals

[3:28:58.760 --> 3:29:02.920]  we don't need no stinking license when the scene started to unfold in hardened montana my first
[3:29:02.920 --> 3:29:07.480]  reaction could be best described as an overwhelming feeling of despair the thought that our worst
[3:29:07.480 --> 3:29:13.000]  fears were coming true so soon literally sent chills down my spine talks of troops on american soil
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:17.720]  and secret empty detention centers appeared to be taking shape before our very eyes scary stuff
[3:29:17.720 --> 3:29:22.440]  indeed but as the hours and days unfolded and more light was shined upon this story it became less
[3:29:22.440 --> 3:29:27.960]  of a looming threat and more like an engrossing tabloid scandal so it doesn't appear that they
[3:29:27.960 --> 3:29:33.480]  do have a license uh we're gonna continue with your calls we're gonna go to scott dan gary chris

[3:33:32.360 --> 3:33:37.320]  that the caller just brought up apf license we don't need no stinking license as you read into it
[3:33:37.320 --> 3:33:42.680]  but american police force is a california corporation in order to advertise for investigative
[3:33:42.680 --> 3:33:48.200]  services in the state of california one must be licensed and the licenses must advertise using
[3:33:48.200 --> 3:33:56.840]  the name that the license is issued under i went to the website of bsis dot ca dot gov slash online
[3:33:56.840 --> 3:34:04.280]  services slash verify licenses s html this is the website for the california department of consumer
[3:34:04.280 --> 3:34:10.040]  affairs bureau of security and investigative services they have a database that anyone can
[3:34:10.040 --> 3:34:15.240]  use to verify a license you simply put in the name of the company and under it will tell you
[3:34:15.240 --> 3:34:21.640]  whether that firm is licensed or not as i suspected no matches were found they are not licensed to
[3:34:21.640 --> 3:34:27.880]  operate as a private investigator nor as a security operator will require to provide bodyguard
[3:34:27.880 --> 3:34:32.360]  services i knew this would be the case going in because the state of california will not issue
[3:34:32.360 --> 3:34:38.280]  a license to a company that has the word police as part of its company name but remember this is
[3:34:38.280 --> 3:34:43.000]  this is under some other umbrella corporation that has remained secret as of this point
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:49.000]  use the word police in the context of any license is strictly forbidden by california state law
[3:34:49.000 --> 3:34:54.920]  and it goes on full story over at prison planet and info wars all right let's continue with the

[3:35:10.440 --> 3:35:17.480]  mean dot com i've i've been there before of course it's under an article named obama in secret russia
[3:35:18.120 --> 3:35:24.040]  visit warren's uh pewton i may not make it about a third of the way about three quarters of the way
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:31.000]  down okay it goes into an american police force company which is owned by one of the most brutal
[3:35:31.560 --> 3:35:40.920]  fascist warlords of the former nation of yucca slavia named me dreed io iya the gobo chevich
[3:35:41.480 --> 3:35:46.280]  so they're telling you that this guy one of his aliases is is this alias that you're saying and
[3:35:46.280 --> 3:35:52.040]  that he is just a brutal military dictator yeah and then it goes on who when brought to the united
[3:35:52.040 --> 3:35:59.320]  states by the cia cia in parenthesis who backed his brutal troops in the destruction of the
[3:35:59.320 --> 3:36:06.600]  balkan genocide wars changed his name to michael anthony hilton well that's incredible rest time
[3:36:06.600 --> 3:36:11.480]  yeah what is that is there a source article or is this just up on that website i mean did they
[3:36:11.480 --> 3:36:16.600]  pull this from some kind of an associated press or other mainline article i'm not sure i'm trying to
[3:36:16.600 --> 3:36:21.160]  get into that it's been well let me tell you how you do it what you do is you take a section of the
[3:36:21.160 --> 3:36:26.280]  article a few sentences all right you copy that and then you paste it into google and then all
[3:36:26.280 --> 3:36:30.760]  articles that have republished it or initially initially published it will come up so you can
[3:36:30.760 --> 3:36:35.320]  kind of see uh where the sources are we would appreciate it if you took that link and you
[3:36:35.320 --> 3:36:40.920]  sent it over to articles at info wars dot com or writers at info wars dot com because if he is
[3:36:40.920 --> 3:36:46.920]  one in the same and this is the same michael hilton and he has not only cia ties but military
[3:36:46.920 --> 3:36:55.400]  dictatorship ties in yugoslavia this is huge dam on here as well a couple of major um sentence
[3:36:55.400 --> 3:37:03.960]  links okay because it was just posted today um it says uh imagine a bloodless coup uh to restore
[3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:09.800]  the defense and defend the constitution through an intern administration that would do serious
[3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:16.040]  business of governing and defending the nation skilled military trained nation builders would
[3:37:16.040 --> 3:37:21.960]  replace accountability challenge radical left commissioners having bonded with their twin
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:29.240]  teleprompters the president would be detailed for a ceremonial speech making well it is creepy stuff
[3:37:29.240 --> 3:37:33.720]  and i just hope that you can get that article to us as soon as possible and all the info warriors
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:38.920]  out there can check it out and uh either verify or disprove this but you know the way things are
[3:37:38.920 --> 3:37:43.800]  going it looks like we're going to be able to verify this this guy has all the markings of this
[3:37:43.800 --> 3:37:49.800]  type of a dictator this type of a strong man someone that the cia would back and you know
[3:37:49.800 --> 3:37:55.560]  he admittedly said that his boss was an ex army colonel named richard culver and this was at the
[3:37:55.560 --> 3:38:01.240]  point when he was just calling himself captain michael and not giving out his last name and again
[3:38:01.240 --> 3:38:08.200]  under the very deceptive name of american police force it's not american it's not a police force
[3:38:08.200 --> 3:38:13.640]  it's not even a licensed security firm according to this article and according to the california
[3:38:13.640 --> 3:38:19.480]  state board website i thank you for the call dan let's jump to gary in massachusetts gary you're on

[3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:53.400]  people have sent in and it admittedly has thimerosal formaldehyde and squailing in it and and h1n1 in
[3:38:53.400 --> 3:39:00.280]  every single normal flu shot that is huge and one that is huge huge it actually says this on the

[3:42:43.640 --> 3:42:48.040]  the name of michael hilden we're developing that story as we speak just incredible stuff
[3:42:50.440 --> 3:42:56.120]  well again that's the problem is that he does have a lot of fun millions and he has been here
[3:42:56.120 --> 3:43:00.840]  making some of the payments the news is saying he's got a other big payment to make in february
[3:43:00.840 --> 3:43:05.880]  and he has been spreading a lot of money around town i've been talking to the people and then you
[3:43:05.880 --> 3:43:11.960]  look at his mo it's hundred thousand dollar thefts two hundred thousand dollar thefts uh civil
[3:43:13.960 --> 3:43:22.200]  uh big trees against demon court as well for a million two so again we're just
[3:43:22.200 --> 3:43:27.480]  investigating all of this trying to find out exactly what's happening and exactly what's
[3:43:27.480 --> 3:43:33.960]  uh going on here but uh i want to give you an update on that in just a moment first off going
[3:43:33.960 --> 3:43:38.920]  back to what the gentleman said before i left town i noticed urban warfare drills all over the
[3:43:38.920 --> 3:43:45.560]  country namely tennessee kentucky and others with the army with the marines and i talked to
[3:43:45.560 --> 3:43:51.080]  thomas stanchez back at ninety nine the head of emergency management kingsville texas and they
[3:43:51.080 --> 3:43:58.440]  admitted to him that this was being done to condition the public they admitted to him that
[3:43:58.440 --> 3:44:05.640]  this is basically acclimation for occupation now that's not even debatable uh they're coming out and
[3:44:05.640 --> 3:44:10.600]  and just putting regular national guard army marines on the streets and so it's this slow
[3:44:10.600 --> 3:44:16.680]  incremental uh unfolding of this agenda but now here at the end it's all intersecting and getting
[3:44:16.680 --> 3:44:23.400]  uh sped up kind of like birthing pains with a woman and you know as she gets down to delivering the
[3:44:23.400 --> 3:44:29.240]  baby uh as she goes through labor for 12 hours the last 30 minutes the contractions are closer
[3:44:29.240 --> 3:44:35.480]  and closer until it's all just one big contraction and that's why we see all the different activities
[3:44:35.480 --> 3:44:42.200]  exploding the bottom line here from heart in montana is i'm very glad i came here because i more
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:47.320]  and more on the internet talk about this being like a twilight zone episode you get to this very
[3:44:47.320 --> 3:44:56.120]  poor town ordering the crow indian reservation there are native americans like right out of a
[3:44:56.120 --> 3:45:03.400]  stereotype uh just completely drunk walking around all over the streets bumping into walls
[3:45:03.400 --> 3:45:10.200]  falling down uh other native americans show nice looking happy families out taking their family
[3:45:10.200 --> 3:45:16.040]  to eat the things but there's there's there's there's homeless old white people begging for money on
[3:45:16.040 --> 3:45:22.440]  the sides of the street uh but there's also you know cherry nice you know folks here as well both uh
[3:45:23.240 --> 3:45:29.960]  both uh non-native and uh folks from montana montana and in the middle of it you have this
[3:45:29.960 --> 3:45:34.920]  this individual who's got a rap sheet the size of the new york phone book i mean every day every
[3:45:34.920 --> 3:45:41.720]  few hours new warrants in different states and new civil judgments and new felonies and as you said
[3:45:41.720 --> 3:45:47.720]  i saw that number 17 aliases that he is hooked into the government at certain levels and the
[3:45:47.720 --> 3:45:53.640]  question is the government's full of criminals con artist scammers was he just taken in because
[3:45:53.640 --> 3:46:00.680]  he was a fellow traveler or has he gone out and conned the u.s government other contractors
[3:46:00.680 --> 3:46:07.000]  other groups he's such a liar that we really don't know he may just be that he's a complete con artist
[3:46:07.000 --> 3:46:12.040]  who was able to get a 27 million dollar facility and have german mercenaries and so we've confirmed
[3:46:12.040 --> 3:46:19.800]  that's going on and and and other Croatian and Serb people in tow with him uh or it could be this
[3:46:19.800 --> 3:46:25.880]  is something much bigger and much deeper the reason it may actually be he may just be a
[3:46:25.880 --> 3:46:33.240]  part of the front man is if you look at it they did a year ago they're seeing in pieces on this
[3:46:33.240 --> 3:46:42.600]  i've talked to locals try to turn the prison into a montana mo west as it was called uh to hold
[3:46:42.600 --> 3:46:48.520]  prisoners from montana mo bay and this other company does have offices i saw their computers
[3:46:48.520 --> 3:46:52.920]  and phones and equipment in there there's another company that they said well they partially pulled
[3:46:52.920 --> 3:46:58.280]  out but they're still here with us i got different stories and they were saying we still may make this
[3:46:58.280 --> 3:47:04.600]  a uh you know alien detainee center enemy combatant center and then i went into different offices and
[3:47:04.600 --> 3:47:09.720]  saw different blue premises maps on the walls uh the supposed woman didn't want me to take that
[3:47:09.720 --> 3:47:16.760]  if i'm paper saying please don't take that and uh back in very very suspiciously so we do have a site
[3:47:16.760 --> 3:47:23.800]  a FEMA camp a a center that the feds and the locals and others have the feds tried to we're
[3:47:23.800 --> 3:47:29.160]  involved a year ago trying to sell us to the state but the legislature the people in uh
[3:47:29.800 --> 3:47:35.800]  Helena and in billings in the major cities said we do not want this and so it looks like they
[3:47:35.800 --> 3:47:40.600]  tried to come back through another organization to try to push it as that's what they said it was
[3:47:40.600 --> 3:47:45.240]  going to be an international training center for foreign troops and we have confirmed it is now
[3:47:45.240 --> 3:47:53.000]  uh in the buildings because that today in fact i just came out of one of the city offices and
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:58.840]  and just had the new uh buildings to set article in fact it's behind me here and it's about to give
[3:47:58.840 --> 3:48:04.760]  it to me uh and it uh does confirm if we're gonna come on the air if we need to get in and we're
[3:48:04.760 --> 3:48:11.880]  gonna do that uh thanks let me have this paper you're sitting on thank you um the building
[3:48:11.880 --> 3:48:19.240]  because that today confirms that without authorization the two rivers authority that's
[3:48:19.240 --> 3:48:24.600]  this private consortium especially taking over the town and its officials running for mayor as
[3:48:24.600 --> 3:48:29.560]  its officials and their officials wives and the city council and it's kind of like their own little
[3:48:29.560 --> 3:48:35.560]  little little boss hog you know types it's tabular here i guess you call it good old boy mafia
[3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:42.040]  around here kind of feeding on the locals uh that don't really know their rights that it's confirmed
[3:48:42.040 --> 3:48:48.040]  in the building it goes there and they've now admitted yes uh the two rivers was preparing
[3:48:48.040 --> 3:48:55.400]  to go before the city council and they had gone ahead and gone into talks to make uh this captain
[3:48:55.400 --> 3:49:03.080]  michael hilton and all his other aliases the police chief and so literally they were going to go out
[3:49:03.080 --> 3:49:08.680]  into the county and arrest people for different petty offenses and bring them back to the jail
[3:49:08.680 --> 3:49:14.920]  and make profits off of that so they fell in con artists and i talked to locals he walked around
[3:49:14.920 --> 3:49:21.400]  everywhere in his hardened police force american police force on one one side it had a hardened
[3:49:21.400 --> 3:49:26.280]  police force on the other instead american police force and he was strutting around for weeks with
[3:49:26.280 --> 3:49:31.400]  his security man announcing that he was the police chief everyone was just groveling to him
[3:49:31.400 --> 3:49:36.840]  because he was foreign on a foreign exit they thought that was games bondition sexy and he
[3:49:36.840 --> 3:49:42.520]  literally just strutted around smoking cigarettes with everyone bowing and hiding and worshiping him
[3:49:42.520 --> 3:49:47.640]  and and then they were preparing to just dispatch and it turns out that the big horn county sheriff
[3:49:47.640 --> 3:49:56.280]  was for this his name is what's his first name lauren's big hair they can't make this up because
[3:49:56.280 --> 3:50:02.200]  i guess when he was born the state thought it was big hair but uh the point is that and if we
[3:50:02.200 --> 3:50:06.680]  heard from me the sheriff's always sick and no one can ever find him they're saying he's sick right
[3:50:06.680 --> 3:50:14.120]  now locals um they reported something else that uh well he has the native uh taste for certain things
[3:50:14.120 --> 3:50:21.320]  but the point is it's really bad folks and this i've never seen a boss on town quite like this
[3:50:21.320 --> 3:50:26.120]  and but it's a microcosm you drive across texas more prisons than anywhere else in the
[3:50:26.120 --> 3:50:30.520]  u.s for capital more prisons than anywhere else in the world the u.s is the capital of prisons
[3:50:31.480 --> 3:50:36.520]  nationwide and worldwide texas is the capital of that so the u.s is the capital worldwide of
[3:50:36.520 --> 3:50:40.760]  prison and texas is the capital of the u.s for prison we had detention centers in every little
[3:50:40.760 --> 3:50:45.960]  county and that's why they put you in jail for nothing it's all the same parasite groups this
[3:50:45.960 --> 3:50:49.880]  guy just happens to be a criminal con artist so it blew up in his face and they're in a lot of
[3:50:49.880 --> 3:50:53.720]  trouble with the attorney general investigating but we'll continue to see if he is hooked up with
[3:50:53.720 --> 3:50:57.880]  all these other shadowy groups far from the court we'll be back after this it's the alex

[3:57:22.120 --> 3:57:28.200]  boss hogs thugs have taken over government everywhere they feed and preditate like predators
[3:57:28.200 --> 3:57:33.720]  on the local populations and that is definitely what's happening here any way you slice it this
[3:57:33.720 --> 3:57:39.960]  is a mafioso takeover with a big prison to further suck the blood out of the local people that can't
[3:57:39.960 --> 3:57:46.040]  stand up for themselves that's what the government is is a giant parasitic cancer absolutely and it
[3:57:46.040 --> 3:57:51.320]  continues to expand its power i mean i can't even recognize this country anymore when we're saying
[3:57:51.320 --> 3:57:57.800]  it's okay to have foreign mercenaries run our police forces alex i mean we've had a final point
[3:57:57.800 --> 3:58:02.040]  of the leadership of the town we went to the sheriff's office went to talk to us but others

[3:58:06.680 --> 3:58:13.240]  we want you you're not from here you need to lead so they said we like foreign serves but but but
[3:58:13.240 --> 3:58:18.920]  we don't like us citizens from texas but that's the small minority the boss hogs just love this
