[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.480]  You can go to CNN right now, via PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com, it's one of the top stories.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.120]  Our headline is 82% agree with Charlie Sheen, the US government covered up the real events
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.840]  of 9-11, and it's gyrating between 84% and 82%, I looked at it 5 minutes ago, or a few
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.280]  minutes ago, and it said 84%, now it's down to 82%, and I haven't really been pushing
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.120]  you to go vote on it, and I've been told, we've confirmed, the calls come into the studio
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.520]  and the emails, neocons are on talk radio all over the country panicking over this poll,
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.040]  and they are telling people to go there and to vote.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:02.860]  And so we're out of 18,605 votes, 15,328 agree with Charlie Sheen, and 3,277 agree with the
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.700]  official, the tooth fairy did it, government conspiracy theory.
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.320]  So since they're on there saying go vote, go vote against Charlie, we just said vote
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.560]  your conscience, go vote for Charlie, go to PrisonPlanet.com before they close this poll
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.600]  and do it right now.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.320]  In fact, they had a big online poll with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution three years ago
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.440]  when Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney went public and said 9-11 is a clear cover up, we need
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.120]  a real investigation, and she listed NORAD stand down and public officials being warned,
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.040]  and of course we've interviewed her on the radio show and on TV, and it was a 24 hour
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.280]  poll and 90 plus percent were agreeing with her until Neil Borch, who's based in Atlanta,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.000]  and a bunch of other people said go tell her she's crazy, say she's wrong, and when
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.040]  they closed the poll it had gone down to 45%, it went back up to 55% and they shut it down
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.040]  because even with national attacks going the people were going to really show that we had
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040]  the majority view.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.360]  That was three years ago, over three years ago now.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.680]  CNN last year had a poll on Anderson Cooper, the exact same type of poll, and out of tens
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.200]  of thousands of respondents, we have links to that on the website, understand that it
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.000]  closed at 90% believing the government was covering up and may have been involved.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.960]  Zogby, 49% believe the government could be involved, 66% wanted a new investigation and
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.800]  thought they were being lied to.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.440]  So Charlie Sheen being attacked by hundreds of newspapers and magazines and it's backfiring
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.240]  on them, he's also being supported by I would say about 45% of them are being supportive,
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.920]  and even the hit pieces then I think are people falling down on purpose.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.080]  In fact some of them I've talked to and I know but they're not allowed to tell the truth
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.640]  so they say, isn't he an idiot, and then they list, look at all these top government people
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.240]  that say what he says, aren't they dumb too.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.440]  So I believe people are deliberately doing all they can to actually help Charlie, and
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.840]  listen he's the first person in Hollywood to go public, he's an American citizen, he's
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.520]  well informed and educated on these subjects, I know you want to hear from him, I'm just
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.520]  telling you he's got amazing courage and I'm commending him.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.480]  Charlie thank you so much for coming on with us Mr. Sheen.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.400]  Thanks for having me back Alex.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:21.200]  All I can say is wow, wow, this has been some kind of week I'll tell you.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.440]  I had a sense that this thing was going to get hot, I didn't realize that as you say
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.760]  it was going to go supernova.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.000]  Well it has gone supernova despite the fact that they tried to can it the first few days
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.440]  but they just couldn't stop it.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.800]  No they could not, but it's interesting because you talk about this recent poll which is really
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.800]  inspiring.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.720]  Now can you specifically speak to CNN showbiz tonight in their poll?
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.880]  Well gosh, first of all I have to tip my hat to CNN, to showbiz tonight, to A.J. Hammer
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.420]  for having the courage, for having the guts, for having the wherewithal to give someone
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:10.740]  like myself, someone like you the actual time and the focus to examine these issues because
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.860]  as you said I think this is the most attention in mainstream coverage that this topic has
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.860]  ever received.
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.500]  It is, I mean no one has ever had in Hollywood the courage you had and then that spurred
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.860]  more courage and A.J. Hammer says he thinks there's a cover up and he wants an investigation.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.060]  Well yeah and that says a lot about him sticking his neck out there, you know, but again like
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.380]  we said in the first interview it feels like the worm is turning, that the consciousness
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.620]  is shifting, but it's interesting because you talk about the attack pieces and the majority
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.780]  of them, in fact 90% of them were attacking me personally, were attacking my credibility,
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:05.540]  were attacking my observational or talents of insight or observance and what they did
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.540]  not attack is the specific points that you and I raised, the points that generate the
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.380]  most controversy about the events.
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.700]  Well that's what a hit piece, if it's done by an operative, always is.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.660]  They build a straw man and you know even, you know, most of the stuff they're attacking
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.180]  you on is exaggerated or isn't even true because I've researched it, you know it's
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.100]  tabloid trash, you know 80% of it's a fraud and then I mean I love them, I mean as for
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.100]  being a party animal George Bush is known to be a bigger partier than you are in many
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.740]  cases in his life so I guess it's okay that you know George Bush has got a few, you know
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.100]  a few problems in his life but you've got to be basically Jesus Christ.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.580]  Well absolutely, for anyone to have any kind of an opinion about something that warrants
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:02.700]  opinion I guess you have to be as squeaky clean as all of those offering their critique.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.260]  You're absolutely right about that but I'm listening to talk shows and I'm listening
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.260]  to the callers call in and they're predominantly agreeing with you and their neocon hosts are
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.700]  flipping out and then I mean what does this poll mean to you specifically you know in
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.980]  the low 80s, 80 plus percent, more than 8 out of 10 people agree with Charlie Sheen
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.580]  and you speak directly to that, those type of numbers.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:32.780]  Well those numbers are staggering but again I'm not entirely surprised because I didn't
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:39.180]  blindly go on your show on Monday, I did my research, you know I was looking at those
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.220]  numbers that you referenced earlier and so I felt like you know if I was going to have
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.380]  the guts to come out about this that there would be some support, there would be a strong
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:07:01.900]  measure of support and I think it speaks volumes to the reality that people want the truth,
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:08.900]  they want the truth and what's been offered to us resembles nothing of the sort.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.260]  Well on top of it Charlie, the old line media still thinks they have a monopoly, they don't
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.580]  understand that overall the alternative media is now bigger and that they're not just going
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:25.020]  to be able to mug you and then everybody just sit back and you know watch them beat
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.020]  you up.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:33.660]  Yeah well clearly and I you know there were a lot of blogs and there were a lot of chat
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:40.580]  boards and there were a lot of internet data that there was a lot of people I wanted to
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:48.220]  personally for their support and their courage to join those of us that are you know part
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.060]  of the 9-11 truth movement.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.380]  Well I want people to understand something too, I mean when I call you or you call me
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.300]  or I'm calling you back and you answer the phone and I hear you know the newest 9-11
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.140]  documentary on in the background or I hear you online researching something, listening
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.780]  to firefighter tapes where they're saying there's bombs in the buildings, you've been
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:13.340]  researching this for how many years, I mean again I'm not just saying you are hyper super
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.900]  informed on this, that's true, I mean you really are.
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:24.260]  Well thank you Alex, no but it's not like I have access to any secret data, I'm looking
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.500]  at the evidence and the data that is available, that is available for anyone to look at if
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.940]  they know where to look, if they know how to look and you know it takes a lot of filtering,
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:39.460]  it takes a lot of sifting but if you do your research and you're diligent there's stuff
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:45.460]  that will be uncovered that you just can't turn away from, you cannot ignore.
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:51.780]  How many hours a week have you been researching 9-11?
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:58.780]  I'd be guessing but it didn't really begin until about six months after the actual event
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:06.580]  because again, oh and I was vilified for expressing my feelings about what I saw and I was demonized
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:15.260]  about expressing or for expressing my gut reaction to what I saw so again, that's right,
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.980]  they ignored the meat and potatoes, they ignored whenever you came right out with the facts
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:25.500]  and then they tried to focus just in on you talking about that day, your instincts, exactly
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:32.500]  which was a mistake and it was a viable lesson not to talk about gut instinct because you
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:39.700]  know these times have obviously driven us to eradicate such notions.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.160]  But the good idea is they're not willing to face you on the real meat and potatoes issues
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.780]  and what you've done is going to drive tens of millions more people to go out and simply
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:57.140]  not look directly at the points that you've raised and let's spend a little bit of time
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:04.140]  on that, 9-11, Building 7, I mean would you like to challenge these neocons to specifically
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:10.260]  put up or shut up and what about this lady who we now find out the production company
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.940]  she works for is owned by one of Bush's fraternity brothers from Skull and Bones, she went on
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.700]  TV on CNN and told us that we needed to do more research and she claimed that the planes
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.260]  knocked the fire retardant off the steel, even if they did steel doesn't melt at that
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.660]  temperature and Building 7 wasn't hit by a plane.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:35.660]  Yeah no it wasn't hit by debris, there was no obvious damage other than a few described
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:44.860]  small fires that burned for 5-6 hours, no but this woman based all of her credibility
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:50.980]  on the ratings that the show received and I find that ludicrous because what that speaks
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:57.980]  to is people's interest, whether you believe official story or you're curious about an
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.980]  alternate viewpoint so she kind of shot herself in the foot talking about this is the base
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.980]  of my credibility, this is why I'm right, because a lot of people watched it.
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:16.140]  Well I can say the same thing about the reaction to my comments this week, well that obviously
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.500]  shows that a lot of people believe me but I'm not saying that, I'm just here to remind
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:28.500]  people that the only credibility I need is what I have and that is as an upstanding tax
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:37.300]  paying American citizen who loves his country and who refuses to stand by at this level
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:46.100]  of insanity is blanketed over obvious truths.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.500]  Well you know an area we haven't really explored is motive for the trillions in oil, motives
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:58.260]  for the hundreds of billions of no bid weapons contracts and Bush told his biographer to
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:05.260]  be able to have a war then no one could really question him domestically and to have that
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.980]  war, Dick Cheney wrote in the PNAC documents, Project for a New American Century that they
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:15.560]  needed a big Pearl Harbor event to mobilize us, I mean what about the motive, I mean now
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.420]  America is turning into a police state and they're using the Patriot Act in non-terror
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.980]  related crimes, they admit that and they're using this to take our freedoms and kill America,
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.660]  can you speak to that?
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:35.220]  It just seems too convenient the path that we've been led down since the event, again
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:43.500]  I cannot speak about the why, the how, the who because I do not have any evidence that
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:50.500]  points in any of those directions, you know what I'm saying, I mean yes I'm aware of the
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:57.860]  times that we're living in, I'm aware of civil liberties and you know a lot of my God given
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:04.860]  rights, constitutionally given rights being eradicated sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly,
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:12.340]  but again I think if we keep the focus on the specific evidence, the specific areas
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:18.620]  that generate the most questions, I think that's where our argument is.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.140]  So we're getting back to what you said on Monday and I'd like you to say it again in
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.940]  your own words or add to it, their official story is the biggest conspiracy theory of
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:34.740]  them all and we know what they're telling us about 9-11 from pillar to post is a fraud,
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.580]  so therefore I mean if Building 7 is wrong, it's all wrong, speak to that.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.500]  Well it's like I said on Monday, if there's a problem with Building 7, there's a problem
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:50.500]  with the whole damn thing and guess what, there is a serious problem with Building 7.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.500]  Now you say you've tried to contact Larry Silverstein, correct?
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.260]  Yes.
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.020]  And he will not return your call?
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:56.620]  No.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:02.020]  And he will not respond to his quote about pulling Building 7?
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.020]  No.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:10.020]  Now how is that possible? How is that justifiable? When somebody makes a statement like that,
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:18.740]  I think it warrants a follow-up response.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.340]  Well it does.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:25.140]  You know what, I'll come right out and say that I'm personally requesting a direct answer
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:31.860]  from Mr. Silverstein about what he meant because so far none of us have been able to get it.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.500]  Well that's extremely bold of you.
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.660]  Give him my number, tell him to call me, I'm just curious. Tell him to call CNN, tell him
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:44.380]  to call somebody because you cannot make a statement like that and not follow it up
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.140]  and not back it up and not explain it.
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.740]  Well let's be specific about that. Obviously you've seen the films, you've seen the news
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:57.020]  footage. There were clear blast points going off down the sides. You see the central column
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.340]  get blown, you see the penthouse came in, the perfect classical demolition and it falls
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.220]  in on its own footprint. Can you specifically talk about the video you've seen and those
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.380]  blast points?
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:14.380]  Anyone that cannot view this as a controlled demolition, I would have to say that their
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:23.740]  chair was not facing the television. Anyone that can look at this and say yes, that is
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:30.740]  a random event caused by fire really needs psychiatric evaluation.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:38.220]  Well, literally folks, I have hours of different firefighters and police and we can't put it
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.180]  all in the films because that's all the films would be. We have hours of them saying did
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.620]  you see the bombs, did you see the explosions and then reporters when seven falls going
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:51.260]  loud you hear those explosions and then it falls. I mean hours and hours and hours and
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:57.060]  hours and Dan Rather and Peter Jennings saying looks like bombs. All of this and then a modern
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.580]  steel building never falling. I mean this cannot be ignored.
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:07.580]  But when they pigeonhole me into the tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy knucklehead brigade
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.840]  they don't mention those quotes by Peter Jennings and Dan Rather.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.620]  They don't mention the quotes?
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:21.180]  But that was their first impression. That was their gut reaction. You see what I'm saying?
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.740]  They didn't have any evidence. They didn't have any proof. They were observing exactly
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.300]  or they were commenting on what they were observing at that specific moment in time.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.060]  Absolutely.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:38.640]  But again Alex, the majority of what we're discussing existed only on day one. If there
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:44.180]  wasn't a problem with any of it, why wouldn't it still be accessible through the mainstream
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.620]  to this day?
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.900]  Why won't they talk about it and debate it with us? It's the big no-no. It's persona
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:56.260]  non grata. It's taboo. We're not supposed to get into building seven because not only
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.420]  did it look like a controlled demolition on the day, then the firefighting organizations
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:05.180]  and firefighter engineering say it's a cover-up. Fire didn't do that. That's impossible. They're
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:10.020]  the experts. They're the firefighter engineers. Not just firefighters, they're engineers.
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.080]  They're saying it's a cover-up. Then they haul the steel away guarding it with machine
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.820]  guns to ship it to China.
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:20.660]  Let me ask you a question. What do you think of Communist China, a known Communist Chinese
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:25.460]  company, a military company taking over our port security now?
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.220]  Well gosh, that would require an entirely separate interview for you and I to launch
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.220]  into.
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.220]  Yeah, that just broke the dab.
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.740]  No, I saw that. I saw that.
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.460]  It's amazing. Charlie Sheen, final segment with you. We'll cover some other key issues
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:45.100]  on the other side. Again, I can only commend you for being just an amazing trailblazer.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.420]  You have really made history on the side of the good guys in a big way, and I think
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.420]  what you've done here is more important than everything else you've done in your life,
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.420]  my friend. We'll be right back with Charlie Sheen, who's a hero.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.220]  Charlie and I were just talking during the break, and he was saying, I want to challenge
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:14.260]  these neocons to not attack me personally, but challenge me on the facts. It's not about
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.220]  Charlie Sheen. Charlie, just for all the newspapers and CNN and everybody else out
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.780]  there listening, would you like to state that in your own words?
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:32.140]  Yeah, I just want to restate that I am a citizen that loves my country. As a citizen, with
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:43.140]  my passion for this great country, I demand that I be challenged on the facts, not on
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:48.900]  immature behavior from 20 years ago, that if they continue to attack me personally,
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.420]  it only gives credence to our side of the argument.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:56.020]  That's right. You're here saying, hey, just look at these facts, like many other prominent
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:03.060]  people are doing, and that's the issue. You also had another idea about new media polls
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.220]  you're challenging the media to carry out.
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.300]  I think there should be a poll on Building 7. First of all, ask people if they even know
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:18.020]  what Building 7 is, or was, rather. Then ask them, having seen the video evidence,
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.020]  what their opinion is.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.500]  That's a great point.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.820]  I would predict right now it would be in the 90s. I'm on the record saying that. Do you
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:29.140]  believe Building 7 was a controlled demolition? Ninety percent. Okay, I said it. I'm on the
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.140]  record.
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.660]  Well, that's what I'm getting in the real poll of 4,000 radio interviews in the last
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:39.380]  four and a half years. Now, I think it will be 90 percent of Americans who know about
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.140]  Building 7. The government and media have been so quiet about it because you have a
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.500]  47-story building, and I've been there, folks. It's way down the block, imploding and falling
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:52.380]  down when buildings right up next to Tower 1 and 2 that weren't owned by certain parties
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.900]  had buildings fall on them and burn for a day and nothing fell.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:05.980]  Yeah, no. It's startling. It's startling. If we can take simple physics and every aspect
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:12.620]  of logic that we've come to know and just put it on its ear, then we can get behind
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:17.700]  how they've explained that away. What does FEMA say about Building 7, Alex?
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:23.300]  They've had four different stories, as you know, and they've had to change each one.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.980]  First it was an oil tank, and then they proved that didn't make it fall. Then they said,
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.980]  oh, well, fires. They said, well, no, that's impossible. I mean, underwriting laboratories
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:38.740]  that underwrote it said it's impossible. Those are engineers that underwrote it. You
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:45.140]  understand, folks? Then they claim that a north tower fell, hit it, and knocked out
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:50.500]  its main column when their own official debris field shows only dust hit it. Fires didn't
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:56.540]  start for hours, and so they're just all over the map. Then they claim structural failure,
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.540]  but it had been underwritten, and so that's just bizarre.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:06.260]  Metal desk in the Madrid fire that burned for over a day, little cheap metal nothing
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:12.660]  desk in the middle of white hot flame didn't melt. Okay, giant steel, hardened steel does
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.100]  not do that. It's bottom line physics. In closing here, during the break, you said
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.940]  you wanted to directly challenge the neocons. Just specifically, do you want to challenge
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.700]  them to deal with your facts? Do you want to lay it on the line?
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:30.380]  Yes. I ask that they look at the evidence and that they debate myself, yourself, people
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:35.420]  that support us on those specific issues. Not about me personally. Not about what they
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.580]  think of me personally. They think they know about me personally. Just about the facts.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:46.660]  I issue that challenge. In closing, is 9-11 the biggest hoax in world
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:52.860]  history? Gosh, I don't know that I want to make that
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.940]  statement, but it's pretty darn close. Let me just say this, Alex. It feels like you
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:02.660]  and I have started the revolution, and God bless America.
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:07.660]  The chair is against the wall. John has a long mustache. We're out there, America, fighting
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:13.420]  behind enemy lines. Are you guys going to start the Hollywood Wolverine militia? Beverly
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.540]  Hills? I hadn't thought of it until this very moment,
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.780]  but it's a hell of an idea. That's just one of my attempts at humor.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.900]  Listen, it was great having you on, sir, and I appreciate your amazing courage. We'll
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.860]  be talking to you very, very soon. Charlie Sheen.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.020]  Thank you, Alex. God bless you, man. Take care, my friend. An amazing individual.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.700]  You ought to know him personally. All right. Take care, my friends.
