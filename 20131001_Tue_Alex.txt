[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:35.580]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:35.580 --> 00:41.380]  well it's Obamacare day eugenics day neural order day shut down the
[00:41.380 --> 00:46.260]  House try to bloody day as some good Republicans in the House try to block
[00:46.260 --> 00:51.820]  this destructive device from being fully detonated the Senate has voted down
[00:51.820 --> 00:57.380]  the Republican funding the House funding of the government and the
[00:57.380 --> 01:03.780]  kleptocratic Decepticon press has gone into characteristic overdrive to a lot
[01:03.780 --> 01:07.960]  of the public and claim that it is libertarians conservatives constitutional
[01:07.960 --> 01:15.700]  and anti-socialist who have derailed the federal government but I would just
[01:15.700 --> 01:19.180]  keep thinking think of all the horrible things the federal government does the
[01:19.180 --> 01:23.860]  biggest most in-depth government in history one of the most corrupt
[01:23.860 --> 01:29.060]  governments undoubtedly in history run by foreign special interest why not have
[01:29.060 --> 01:34.700]  it shut down oh but I'm sorry all the bad parts the the thousands of armored
[01:34.700 --> 01:38.220]  vehicles being delivered every month to different cities the training the police
[01:38.220 --> 01:43.140]  the founding fathers are the enemy and that gun owners are the enemy the FDA
[01:43.140 --> 01:48.020]  approving GMOs without even looking at them and not letting you know if there's
[01:48.020 --> 01:53.700]  GMO in your food blocking that the FDA run by Monsanto the federal court over
[01:53.700 --> 01:59.860]  GMO in st. Louis run by Monsanto I thought we'd open the phones up to to
[01:59.860 --> 02:05.620]  ask listeners specifically how you're liking Obamacare because just in three
[02:05.620 --> 02:11.020]  years since it got passed there's been a more than doubling on average for
[02:11.020 --> 02:15.100]  people's premiums we had Geraldo Rivera on yesterday the articles up on info
[02:15.100 --> 02:19.900]  wars.com Geraldo Rivera is pretty big liberal says Obamacare doubled his
[02:19.900 --> 02:24.700]  health insurance cost the last three years for him and his six employees that
[02:24.700 --> 02:32.620]  work directly for Geraldo Rivera so there you go I'd like to specifically open
[02:32.620 --> 02:35.620]  the phones up in the next segment and we don't screen your calls except when I
[02:35.620 --> 02:40.700]  asked for you to talk on a subject then we'd like you to call in on that
[02:40.700 --> 02:46.540]  subject most the time it's just free for all as you know I specifically I
[02:46.540 --> 02:52.940]  specifically want to get your take on has your insurance gone up or down did
[02:52.940 --> 02:58.100]  you get laid off from 40 hours to 29 hours as some estimates are 15 million
[02:58.100 --> 03:01.140]  some are 25 million that have already been laid off the point is or had their
[03:01.140 --> 03:05.540]  hours cut back and of course that actually makes unemployment go go down
[03:05.540 --> 03:09.860]  because they count when you get two or three jobs as those being new jobs in
[03:09.860 --> 03:13.980]  the economy and then average that into the population the working population
[03:13.980 --> 03:19.620]  that what's a hundred to 60 million or something out of 315 million the point
[03:19.620 --> 03:24.780]  is is that this is designed to implode the economy so I want to get your take
[03:24.780 --> 03:30.020]  on a are you liking Obamacare because if you enjoy all the shutdown of the
[03:30.020 --> 03:33.660]  economy so far just just as it approached now that it's actually
[03:33.660 --> 03:40.660]  arrived do you like it I know everybody I talked to absolutely hates it and then
[03:40.660 --> 03:44.660]  I want to get your take on what are the most horrible things the federal
[03:44.660 --> 03:49.860]  government does that of course they're not defunding Ron Paul site put out an
[03:49.860 --> 03:56.260]  article that we posted yesterday going over all of the police state measures
[03:56.260 --> 04:04.020]  that are continuing that are continuing to roll out very very fast against the
[04:04.020 --> 04:07.700]  American people and then of course we have the really big news how the
[04:07.700 --> 04:12.500]  internationalists the IMF the World Bank the UN the communist Chinese are all
[04:12.500 --> 04:22.460]  lecturing us right now on the fact that we are basically you know not allowed as
[04:22.460 --> 04:28.620]  a country to say that we don't want Obamacare and that we're going to shut
[04:28.620 --> 04:34.900]  it down the idea is that by doing that we're somehow violating all these
[04:34.900 --> 04:38.660]  international agreements so it shows how more and more like a third-world nation
[04:38.660 --> 04:43.220]  we're controlled by outside interest and this is how globalism gets rid of
[04:43.220 --> 04:46.660]  national sovereignty is by getting countries into debt and having them
[04:46.660 --> 04:51.620]  sign on to this so this is the conquering of America and the shutdown of
[04:51.620 --> 04:56.580]  Obamacare is a last-ditch effort to try to save the country this is really a
[04:56.580 --> 05:02.420]  historical time we're seeing right now the world is discovering the power of

[08:47.420 --> 08:52.180]  piven trick-or-treat as they attempt to shut down the free market and the
[08:52.180 --> 08:57.340]  individually controlled economy to move it into the centralized global mafia
[08:57.340 --> 09:04.740]  hands we're going to open the phones up on this Tuesday addition specifically
[09:04.740 --> 09:08.580]  for callers and we don't screen your calls folks but when I want you to call

[09:15.180 --> 09:17.980]  fact that we don't screen calls and then when I open the phones up
[09:17.980 --> 09:22.160]  specifically on a topic every few weeks when I want to discuss something in
[09:22.160 --> 09:27.980]  your take on it a lot of people do not respect that and so again we don't
[09:27.980 --> 09:33.340]  screen your calls except when I put out the call for a specific issue or a
[09:33.340 --> 09:41.580]  specific group of issues that I really want to get your take on a just in the
[09:41.580 --> 09:45.740]  lead-up to Obamacare being put into place with its passage three years ago
[09:45.740 --> 09:51.860]  we've seen more than a doubling on average of premiums and Geraldo Rivera
[09:51.860 --> 09:55.820]  was on yesterday the articles up on info wars.com with the video and audio and
[09:55.820 --> 10:00.260]  he said that look he was pretty much a supporter of it early on but now for he
[10:00.260 --> 10:04.820]  and his six employees that work under him it's doubled I think the quote was
[10:04.820 --> 10:09.500]  more than doubled of the so-called Affordable Care Act now I saw people in
[10:09.500 --> 10:14.060]  the article on info wars.com commenting with their talking points that oh
[10:14.060 --> 10:18.580]  that's because the insurance companies use it as an excuse and we're too stupid
[10:18.580 --> 10:23.180]  to know that no no no I'm sorry you're too stupid or too gullible the insurance
[10:23.180 --> 10:28.460]  companies wrote Obamacare to get around laws that didn't allow them to gouge
[10:28.460 --> 10:35.020]  people and that allowed competition and it got around state laws on insurance
[10:35.020 --> 10:39.660]  and things that didn't let them gouge people so it blew all those away and
[10:39.660 --> 10:45.340]  that's why you're going to see prices go up amongst other things now Adon
[10:45.340 --> 10:50.100]  Salazar did an article on Friday from the New York Stock Exchange own graphs
[10:50.100 --> 10:54.420]  and the statements of the Big Ten insurance companies in the United States
[10:54.420 --> 10:58.660]  most of them are firing owned globalist operations just want to point that out
[10:58.660 --> 11:03.500]  that have conquered us that they on average have doubled just like the
[11:03.500 --> 11:16.020]  prices doubled their stock has doubled doubled doubled so this is the reality
[11:16.020 --> 11:19.740]  now I've already gone over a lot of that but I want to get your take on how are
[11:19.740 --> 11:24.140]  you liking it how are you liking between 15 and 25 million the numbers vary but
[11:24.140 --> 11:29.180]  it's happening right now being laid off being laid off from 40 hours or more
[11:29.180 --> 11:36.260]  down to 29 hours or less I walked into Barton Springs about a month ago and
[11:36.260 --> 11:41.500]  before I've gotten the 200 yards down to where I wanted to jump in I had two
[11:41.500 --> 11:45.140]  different lifeguards walk over including a senior one and go man I warned
[11:45.140 --> 11:50.340]  everybody here they're all big Obama supporters they have taken is it's open
[11:50.340 --> 11:55.140]  year-round they've taken the more than a hundred lifeguards is a huge giant
[11:55.140 --> 12:00.380]  people haven't seen it it's you know 400 yards long you name it big natural
[12:00.380 --> 12:05.820]  spring thousands people go to the data in the summer the point is they cut
[12:05.820 --> 12:13.580]  everybody including managers to 20 hours just to be safe they said not 29 so
[12:13.580 --> 12:18.060]  again it was written to lower the wages of America and impoverish us and most
[12:18.060 --> 12:23.700]  people will just give up most people will just give up most people that work
[12:23.700 --> 12:27.060]  there by the way or middle-aged now and have college degrees oh I'm a scientist
[12:27.060 --> 12:31.620]  oh I'm an engineer yeah I work here for $10 an hour well now you're going to get
[12:31.620 --> 12:37.980]  your hours cut from 40 to 20 hope you enjoy it and it's everyone I know whether
[12:37.980 --> 12:41.940]  they back groceries or whether they work for the city you name it they're being
[12:41.940 --> 12:46.820]  fired as regular employees large numbers of them and then rehired as
[12:46.820 --> 12:51.220]  temporary employees are part-time and it was designed to impoverish you just like
[12:51.220 --> 12:55.780]  open borders is designed to impoverish you just like everything out there is the
[12:55.780 --> 13:00.180]  globalist to wage war against labor and of course the labor unions are now
[13:00.180 --> 13:06.780]  lining up against Obamacare as they get the news that it's a major screw job but
[13:06.780 --> 13:09.260]  it won't matter your leadership is controlled you'll go down with the ship
[13:09.260 --> 13:13.460]  just like Detroit you will do what you're told because it's Obama I mean you've
[13:13.460 --> 13:17.860]  got to stick another Obama sticker on your car there's the headline London
[13:17.860 --> 13:21.620]  Guardian U.S. employers slashing worker hours to avoid Obamacare insurance
[13:21.620 --> 13:25.420]  mandate of course they'll just pass laws later
[13:26.260 --> 13:30.580]  making employers not just have minimum wage but higher U.S. full-time but then
[13:30.580 --> 13:33.500]  all the big companies are going to get waivers and then of course all the small
[13:33.500 --> 13:37.740]  companies they're just gonna get rid of people entirely what's what's better
[13:37.740 --> 13:43.500]  than having your hours cut from 40 to 20 being fired and that's the plan because
[13:43.500 --> 13:47.900]  then you'll go on a third of what you were being paid on unemployment and then
[13:47.900 --> 13:51.900]  that won't get food so you'll go on food stamps 24 million were on food stamps
[13:51.900 --> 13:55.020]  when Obama came into office five and a half years ago last time I checked it's
[13:55.020 --> 14:01.060]  49 million on full-time food stamps with 101 million as of last month on some
[14:01.060 --> 14:06.700]  form of food assistance 101 million land of the free home of the brave and you
[14:06.700 --> 14:10.580]  get the socialist calling in the social workers and people laughing going we are
[14:10.580 --> 14:14.140]  socialists we are taking over and you're just a racist and you're gonna fail
[14:14.140 --> 14:18.020]  I'm a racist because I want you to do well and have a future and I know free
[14:18.020 --> 14:22.260]  market creates the most wealth in every case in history what we've got is not a
[14:22.260 --> 14:27.860]  free market it's a big corrupt rigged crony capitalist inside monopoly system
[14:27.860 --> 14:39.900]  and it's going to get worse very very very very quickly because it's a plan
[14:39.900 --> 14:45.380]  it's been done in hundreds of other countries hundreds the IMF World Bank
[14:45.380 --> 14:50.940]  plans have been public since 2002 leaked it's on record what they do this is
[14:50.940 --> 14:56.260]  military you think Hitler when he was rolling into the capital of Poland and
[14:56.260 --> 14:59.420]  bombing it cared that hundreds thousands were dying do you think the
[14:59.420 --> 15:03.180]  globalist when I took over Iraq cared that over a million Iraqis died no that
[15:03.180 --> 15:08.420]  was the plan depopulation they are psychopaths that see you as dog meat
[15:08.420 --> 15:12.620]  and when they're done with you as veterans you're the number one enemy and
[15:12.620 --> 15:17.780]  the minute you figure this out the minute you understand we're facing
[15:17.780 --> 15:22.180]  crimes against humanity posing as liberals with list being MPR voices
[15:22.180 --> 15:27.100]  I'm telling you if tanks in World War two would just broadcast hi I'm here to
[15:27.100 --> 15:31.660]  help you loving liberal liberal if Hitler's tanks would have been pink he
[15:31.660 --> 15:36.780]  would have won if you had people in pink uniforms going I'm your friend but
[15:36.780 --> 15:40.420]  firing as they attack people would have actually laid down and been killed I'm
[15:40.420 --> 15:44.700]  not kidding it's easy to fight somebody wearing skull insignias and black
[15:44.700 --> 15:48.300]  uniforms saying we're going to kill everybody no quarter because then you
[15:48.300 --> 15:53.500]  know you got to fight but it's the creeping death that's so hard to beat
[15:53.500 --> 15:58.860]  all list being dipped in patchouli oil scampering around on their sandals
[15:58.860 --> 16:04.140]  telling you about peace and love by the way all the real peace-loving folks I
[16:04.140 --> 16:09.260]  know are anti-New World Order anti-establishment basically neo gypsies
[16:09.260 --> 16:12.900]  minus the stealing and are out of the system off the grid and know what's
[16:12.900 --> 16:17.340]  going on those are real hippies and they're all awake and know what's going
[16:17.340 --> 16:23.820]  on but the but the establishment yuppie-oid yippie hippie whatever you
[16:23.820 --> 16:29.100]  want to call them are authoritarian cult members and they know what they're
[16:29.100 --> 16:33.740]  doing now that said I want your calls on Obamacare and how it's affecting you but
[16:33.740 --> 16:40.580]  I also want to get your take looking at this to tell us are you concerned that
[16:40.580 --> 16:45.580]  there's the IMF the World Bank the UN the Communist Chinese in the news
[16:45.580 --> 16:48.940]  dictating that we better not have a government shutdown that even the
[16:48.940 --> 16:52.140]  Democrats has voted for it in the Senate twice today and the shutdowns now on
[16:52.140 --> 16:57.860]  and then blaming national sovereignty and you've got neocons at Forbes saying
[16:57.860 --> 17:01.740]  you got to go to China to get permission this is how they conquer third world
[17:01.740 --> 17:04.900]  countries this is how third world countries South Africa has been told by
[17:04.900 --> 17:09.260]  the IMF today you will raise taxes and you will cut benefits and you will pay
[17:09.260 --> 17:13.100]  us more money and back up our derivatives and pay us an international
[17:13.100 --> 17:18.220]  tax to the IMF and World Bank or will down your rating and shut your economy
[17:18.220 --> 17:24.900]  down they hold you hostage with the giant debts they have maneuvered us into

[24:31.660 --> 24:37.460]  now but the three prongs Obamacare will hammer the general public it will shut
[24:37.460 --> 24:41.900]  the economy down and centralize it towards state run with select private
[24:41.900 --> 24:46.780]  interest benefiting picking winners and losers but most importantly it brings
[24:46.780 --> 24:51.420]  us under internationalism and just like Brazil or South Africa are currently
[24:51.420 --> 24:55.620]  being told you'll pay off tens of billions of debts that are loan sharking
[24:55.620 --> 25:00.140]  rates that you already paid off many times over or will shut you down we'll
[25:00.140 --> 25:04.780]  have embargoes will send in special forces to assassinate your leaders
[25:04.780 --> 25:09.900]  that's what the globalists do it's not America or England or Germany or France
[25:09.900 --> 25:14.820]  doing this it is the big financial interest that run our governments and
[25:14.820 --> 25:19.580]  they don't want a power plant in your city owned by your city or owned by a
[25:19.580 --> 25:24.180]  smaller corporation they write the regulations to shut that down and exempt
[25:24.180 --> 25:30.020]  themselves they are a mafia and they will destroy prosperity and their
[25:30.020 --> 25:36.340]  religion is social Darwinistic Malthusian neo eugenics under a planetary
[25:36.340 --> 25:41.860]  system of controlled markets and mercantilism and I stand in resistance
[25:41.860 --> 25:46.700]  to neo feudalistic serfdom and those aren't big fancy words I'm using these
[25:46.700 --> 25:51.180]  are words used on record by them to describe their world-wide
[25:51.180 --> 25:56.180]  technocracy it is meant to bring in a new dark age where only they have the
[25:56.180 --> 25:59.980]  benefits of the advanced technologies life extension you name it and you have
[25:59.980 --> 26:03.620]  nothing but ignorance and bondage the only tech you're gonna be allowed to
[26:03.620 --> 26:08.860]  have is surveillance systems that microwave you and your family this is
[26:08.860 --> 26:14.380]  the ruthlessness of the globalist waging war on humanity they are the enemy of
[26:14.380 --> 26:19.940]  progress they don't even intend to let us have an off-world space program they
[26:19.940 --> 26:23.340]  say humans will never go the elite will merge with machines and then if they
[26:23.340 --> 26:29.700]  choose they will go into space this is Ray Kurzweil this is Ted Turner this is
[26:29.700 --> 26:36.620]  all of them all it's been the decisions have been made in counsel the human
[26:36.620 --> 26:45.220]  space program is over we're over they're playing God if I was an alien species
[26:45.220 --> 26:50.100]  that was advanced and could somehow send in nanobots to program people's brains
[26:50.100 --> 26:55.420]  I would send in drones micro drones take over the leadership and do exactly what
[26:55.420 --> 27:02.180]  they're doing now let's say if I was a synthetic silicon based life form and
[27:02.180 --> 27:04.980]  I'm saying this hypothetically I don't mean this but it's a good analogy to
[27:04.980 --> 27:13.220]  understand if if I was the alien mainframe that invaded in the excellent
[27:13.220 --> 27:20.540]  sci-fi dystopic film that came out this year oblivion I wouldn't come in with a
[27:20.540 --> 27:25.540]  big orbiting attack ship to then destroy the moon and destabilize the planet and
[27:25.540 --> 27:32.140]  kill everybody I would come in with a salvo of nanotech basically silicone
[27:32.140 --> 27:37.700]  body snatcher spores and I would go in and program the ruling class to build
[27:37.700 --> 27:44.260]  with reverse engineered technology a control grid that the establishments
[27:44.260 --> 27:48.700]  building right now I mean when you look at this thing it looks alien like an
[27:48.700 --> 27:52.860]  alien takeover plan when you look at what they're rolling out how organized it
[27:52.860 --> 27:58.340]  is how bad it is it's that bad and the reason I use that analogy that parable
[27:58.340 --> 28:02.700]  that allegory is because it might as well be that and I keep saying that
[28:02.700 --> 28:07.900]  because that's how it hits me it's just it's like an alien attack by a guild of
[28:07.900 --> 28:11.780]  psychopaths who say they're another species who say they don't like humans
[28:11.780 --> 28:16.900]  who say they're gonna become god merger machines wipe all us out step on us like
[28:16.900 --> 28:22.300]  a bug these are all the quotes by the transhumanist at first they're gonna put
[28:22.300 --> 28:25.580]  us in ghettos if we don't accept it but they're incrementally bringing in and
[28:25.580 --> 28:29.580]  testing it in a Pavlovian way where you basically can't say no to it because you
[28:29.580 --> 28:34.380]  want to compete in the system even against it you are adapting to it but
[28:34.380 --> 28:43.180]  in a bad way and accepting the Borg simulation assimilation and then the
[28:43.180 --> 28:46.740]  globalist put out papers we've read them on air saying see how smart we are see
[28:46.740 --> 28:52.220]  see why don't you join us it's your only hope and then I look at the stuff
[28:52.220 --> 28:54.980]  they're doing to the earth and how the genetic engineering is wrecking
[28:54.980 --> 29:01.540]  everything because they're doing it in a out of control irresponsible way and and
[29:01.540 --> 29:07.580]  I study them and they're really they go to orgy balls and and and dress up and
[29:07.580 --> 29:11.620]  devil outfits and have orgies and just all about how willful they are now they
[29:11.620 --> 29:15.140]  don't they can gut up and do it they're all about their shelf and they're
[29:15.140 --> 29:18.700]  willing to put out GMO they're willing to blow the planet up in the process of
[29:18.700 --> 29:22.380]  taking control at least they're willing that's a quote I just gave you it's an
[29:22.380 --> 29:26.260]  endgame on one of the top globalist fact they say once they merge the
[29:26.260 --> 29:30.300]  machines and become God they may just blow up the universe because because
[29:30.300 --> 29:34.460]  that's willing that's the next level to show their will I mean these are crazy
[29:34.460 --> 29:38.500]  people and they want to run your healthcare and I just took you to the
[29:38.500 --> 29:41.660]  bottom of the rabbit hole basically I mean that's who these people are they

[34:38.980 --> 34:41.740]  of Google came out and said we're going to make you live forever we're going to
[34:41.740 --> 34:46.060]  be the mind of God master plan world government join us basically and you
[34:46.060 --> 34:50.780]  can be part of it you're not going to be part of it and I'm not saying it can be
[34:50.780 --> 34:57.380]  attained either by the way I'm pointing out that that's what these people believe
[34:57.380 --> 35:05.940]  that they can do of course the media then makes fun of me and says I'm saying
[35:05.940 --> 35:08.820]  they're going to do this like it's fantastical and I just pulled it out of
[35:08.820 --> 35:14.100]  a old boot or something on the high on the side of the highway this is what
[35:14.100 --> 35:18.260]  they're pushing this is what they're doing and they to control technology
[35:18.260 --> 35:21.780]  they've got to control health care they already control all the other
[35:21.780 --> 35:25.620]  disruptive technologies that is anything that they don't control that allows you
[35:25.620 --> 35:28.980]  to be free or independent so now they're coming in to take over what they
[35:28.980 --> 35:33.300]  really are obsessed with life extension every time there's a globalist secret
[35:33.300 --> 35:38.740]  confab that leaks out in the news at Rockefeller University or at one of the
[35:38.740 --> 35:44.020]  palaces in England you notice that what's leaked is the world elite we're
[35:44.020 --> 35:53.100]  discussing life extension and health care because they're not going to give you
[35:53.100 --> 35:58.260]  access to stuff that can already increase life 20 30 40 years on record if
[35:58.260 --> 36:04.260]  you start the treatments now and if you can live another 30 40 years well then
[36:04.260 --> 36:06.500]  you're gonna be able to live another hundred years and then if you can live
[36:06.500 --> 36:10.100]  another 100 years you can live another thousand that's how they're thinking and
[36:10.100 --> 36:15.980]  so they are capturing the future they are owning the future as Obama says in
[36:15.980 --> 36:22.380]  his slogan they are moving for their goal to capture the technology for
[36:22.380 --> 36:26.300]  themselves have you build it develop it pay for it and then you get no access to
[36:26.300 --> 36:31.180]  it you're gonna get petty status and uniforms to strut around and henpeck
[36:31.180 --> 36:37.700]  each other as we are put in the giant slums and the elite live in their
[36:37.700 --> 36:44.620]  armored green zones you're saying well that sounds like a movie I've seen yeah
[36:44.620 --> 36:48.860]  Hunger Games again totally in your face the type of world they're planning to
[36:48.860 --> 36:55.980]  set up calorie cards restricting everything that's the plan I put in
[36:55.980 --> 37:07.380]  films in 2001 in game in 2006 but also in road to tyranny 2001 I made it 2002 or
[37:07.380 --> 37:11.220]  at least in February where I said they're gonna have us living basically in
[37:11.220 --> 37:15.860]  loincloths as feudalistic serfs while they live in high-tech command centers
[37:15.860 --> 37:20.580]  because that's what they say in their books I'm on record saying everything
[37:20.580 --> 37:24.740]  that's in Hunger Games before it came out in Hunger Games people send me emails I
[37:24.740 --> 37:28.580]  see comments yeah I see them coming in on the website going oh you got all this
[37:28.580 --> 37:32.620]  for Hunger Games no folks they're throwing in your face what they're
[37:32.620 --> 37:40.820]  building they're giving you the revelation of the method in the 70s the
[37:40.820 --> 37:51.860]  Pentagon called the drone computer satellite control GPS grid sky net in
[37:51.860 --> 37:57.500]  the 70s they were already calling it in internal documents the global web and
[37:57.500 --> 38:07.580]  then it became worldwide web WWW dot the web of the NSA control grid the web to
[38:07.580 --> 38:11.300]  make everything cashless the web to track everything you do and make it to
[38:11.300 --> 38:14.820]  where you can't operate without it to make you begin merging with the machines
[38:14.820 --> 38:20.780]  this is their words not mine this is the total grid this is the plan this is the
[38:20.780 --> 38:25.700]  program this is not my opinion this is what Obamacare is at it everybody's
[38:25.700 --> 38:28.980]  talking about Obamacare and how the exchanges didn't work and how the big
[38:28.980 --> 38:33.460]  guys are exempt and how it's doubling the cost and how it's a horrible deal and
[38:33.460 --> 38:40.940]  how blah blah blah that's all a side issue to what it overall is meant to do
[38:40.940 --> 38:45.620]  so that the average people understand why this is being done to them toll free
[38:45.620 --> 38:50.620]  number to join us on Obamacare eight hundred two five nine nine two three one
[38:50.620 --> 38:56.100]  the phones are open eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one and we
[38:56.100 --> 39:00.700]  are going to have Stuart Rhodes coming on for about 45 minutes with some big
[39:00.700 --> 39:04.380]  breaking news ahead of both keepers in the next hour and then Max Kaiser will
[39:04.380 --> 39:08.940]  be on the last 40 minutes of that third hour to break down the economy and what's
[39:08.940 --> 39:13.100]  happening worldwide here today but the left calls throughout the next two and a
[39:13.100 --> 39:17.620]  half hours the toll free number to join us is eight hundred two five nine ninety
[39:17.620 --> 39:26.300]  two thirty one and then of course there's this giant issue that's going on in
[39:26.300 --> 39:34.340]  the background the real government the checkpoints the government forcing GMO
[39:34.340 --> 39:37.620]  into the school lunch program not letting you know if it's got GMO in it
[39:37.620 --> 39:41.740]  blocking labeling I want to hear from you about all the horrible things that are
[39:41.740 --> 39:47.260]  still running see all the nasty stuff all the real stuff all the essential
[39:47.260 --> 39:53.380]  stuff it's going to keep running for your safety of course in the background
[39:53.380 --> 39:59.540]  while the chicken feed the national parks the things like that that's going
[39:59.540 --> 40:02.740]  to start breaking down and then oh heaven forbid the welfare checks might
[40:02.740 --> 40:06.980]  not come and then you'll have over a hundred million people burned down the
[40:06.980 --> 40:10.860]  country oh but don't worry the tanks the armored vehicles they're already all in
[40:10.860 --> 40:16.100]  place to save us so they use the rioting if it goes to that probably won't
[40:16.100 --> 40:20.860]  this time but we will go totally defunct it's designed to do that the IMF that's
[40:20.860 --> 40:24.100]  that's their favorite thing they could have two years of rioting and discord
[40:24.100 --> 40:27.620]  which totally destroys the country and then they come in and buy everything up
[40:27.620 --> 40:31.420]  for pennies on the dollar that's called the IMF riot in the documents that
[40:31.420 --> 40:42.060]  were leaked in 2002 it's all planned out all planned out 800 259 92 31 but yep the
[40:42.060 --> 40:46.460]  LA Times is you know they're telling people leave Yosemite there's not
[40:46.460 --> 40:50.460]  going to be any guards there oh they'll be guards there to tell you you can't use
[40:50.460 --> 40:59.380]  it I mean it sounds like heaven to not have armed park rangers coming up
[40:59.380 --> 41:04.060]  getting in your face telling you that you know socialism is the answer sounds
[41:04.060 --> 41:09.220]  like sounds like a heavenly thing to go to the national parks and literally not
[41:09.220 --> 41:13.460]  have them spying on you and following you around and doing everything they do
[41:13.460 --> 41:17.700]  but here are some of the articles Obamacare exchanges start up as government
[41:17.700 --> 41:25.060]  shuts down oh but the AP spoke too soon surprise surprise sergeant Obama health
[41:25.060 --> 41:33.220]  insurance exchange websites don't work healthcare.gov a total mess as planned as
[41:33.220 --> 41:39.260]  planned ladies and gentlemen continuing President Obama expect months of
[41:39.260 --> 41:46.100]  glitches yes it was glitches when they shut off the farmers and the co-ops and
[41:46.100 --> 41:49.740]  the systems that worked in Ukraine and Poland for many years and then
[41:49.740 --> 41:53.380]  everything broke down except for the central party systems yes it's a glitch
[41:53.380 --> 41:57.500]  it's a glitch when the IMF and World Bank shut down Greece and Spain and they
[41:57.500 --> 42:00.700]  get double digit increases in unemployment and the economy totally
[42:00.700 --> 42:04.660]  implodes and the IMF and World Bank comes in and totally takes over oh it's a
[42:04.660 --> 42:11.220]  glitch oh it's a glitch it's a glitch when a drug dealer comes up to 11 year
[42:11.220 --> 42:17.100]  olds and gives them hard drugs to get them addicted and then comes back a week
[42:17.100 --> 42:22.420]  later and says get the money out of your mom's purse I'll never forget when I was
[42:22.420 --> 42:28.060]  about 13 years old I was already somewhat street wise and I was trying to date
[42:28.060 --> 42:31.460]  this girl that was about 16 and I'll go to your calls actually did successfully
[42:31.460 --> 42:36.100]  date her she lived down the street in the neighborhood and then she was kind of
[42:36.100 --> 42:41.740]  wild very beautiful and I learned she was on drugs she was 16 I was 13 and then
[42:41.740 --> 42:46.540]  her boyfriend came around it was like 20 years old drug dealer you know driving
[42:46.540 --> 42:51.580]  the driving the sports car and he didn't have a problem with the fact that that I
[42:51.580 --> 42:55.300]  was starting to date her because the truth is he had like 20 young women out
[42:55.300 --> 42:59.940]  there Robin mama's purse and doing whatever to you know to to buy drugs
[42:59.940 --> 43:03.300]  from him it wasn't his girlfriend he got me in the car and he said here's some
[43:03.300 --> 43:07.140]  cocaine one of the few times I've tried cocaine I've told the story or told part
[43:07.140 --> 43:10.380]  of it and I went and tried I was like this is horrible who would ever do
[43:10.380 --> 43:14.020]  something like this and then a week later came out he said yeah you know why
[43:14.020 --> 43:17.380]  don't you you know take the money out of your mom's purse or sell whatever you
[43:17.380 --> 43:20.740]  know rings or whatever they've got and we'll go buy some drugs and I said man I
[43:20.740 --> 43:24.700]  said you're just doing this to everybody aren't you you're a scam artist and the
[43:24.700 --> 43:28.300]  guy totally turned into a demon he said ah whatever scumbag don't let me see it
[43:28.300 --> 43:33.340]  with my girlfriend and slam the door see at 13 I was dumb enough to want to
[43:33.340 --> 43:37.100]  experiment and try something but smart enough to then figure it out and never
[43:37.100 --> 43:40.460]  never do it again I did it one more time later people said oh you had a bad
[43:40.460 --> 43:45.460]  experience you'll like it this time but the point is is that that's that's what
[43:45.460 --> 43:49.540]  this whole culture that's what this whole system is it's not an accident when
[43:49.540 --> 43:52.980]  they go and give school kids drugs to get them on drugs I've actually had it
[43:52.980 --> 43:58.420]  happen to me and it's not an accident when these loan sharks come and loan us
[43:58.420 --> 44:03.100]  our own money fiat and then maneuver it so it goes bankrupt it's not an accident
[44:03.100 --> 44:09.540]  Obama cares on an accident it's all on purpose and the moment the moment
[44:09.540 --> 44:13.780]  everybody figures it this out is the moment we start becoming free again the
[44:13.780 --> 44:18.820]  moment we become streetwise and stop being schmucks idiots fools stop letting
[44:18.820 --> 44:23.540]  people muscle in on us I'd rather lose everything I've got than let government
[44:23.540 --> 44:26.900]  or private individuals muscle in on me when you've got that attitude they move
[44:26.900 --> 44:31.540]  on to somebody that's easier and so many people who are highly intelligent think
[44:31.540 --> 44:35.620]  it's their right to manipulate people who are gullible even if you're as
[44:35.620 --> 44:38.980]  intelligent as they are but don't have an evil streak I mean streak they will
[44:38.980 --> 44:42.580]  feed on you because they feel like they disrespect you because you won't stand up
[44:42.580 --> 44:47.580]  for yourself that's how this works it's time for good people to not be sheep but
[44:47.580 --> 44:52.580]  not be wolves to be sheep dogs you know the analogy here's some more headlines
[44:56.220 --> 45:00.140]  Obama cares site goes live with some glitches that's the Washington Post
[45:00.140 --> 45:05.060]  whitewash Obama on the GOP I shouldn't have to offer anything that's right he's
[45:05.060 --> 45:09.620]  God even though the bill is totally unpopular can't be implemented it doesn't
[45:09.620 --> 45:13.020]  even work there's so many special interests got in there to get a piece of
[45:13.020 --> 45:18.700]  it see finally in a piratical pirate run system things get so corrupt everything
[45:18.700 --> 45:22.700]  and implodes because no one can say no to anybody and now that's what it's
[45:22.700 --> 45:26.860]  gotten to but they like that because it'll only implode things more
[45:26.860 --> 45:31.500]  Obama administration lawmaker staff can get an abortion coverage in that suite
[45:31.500 --> 45:39.020]  continuing here with the news we've got Bob Woodward coming out saying if this
[45:39.020 --> 45:45.700]  doesn't get fixed it's on Obama's head because he's clearly sitting back letting
[45:45.700 --> 45:50.900]  the whole thing crumble or political points so it's strange to see an
[45:50.900 --> 45:54.700]  establishment person like Woodward come out and tell the truth yeah here it is
[45:54.700 --> 45:58.700]  in the Washington Free Beacon Woodward if shut down or debt ceiling causes
[45:58.700 --> 46:04.340]  economic crisis it's on the president's head he's got to lead he's got to talk
[46:04.340 --> 46:08.020]  and the absence of discussion here is baffling and now they're in the news
[46:08.020 --> 46:13.340]  saying the US is going to lose its credit rating oh we're the dollars
[46:13.340 --> 46:17.580]  dropping oh the stock market's in trouble just go along with Obamacare or
[46:17.580 --> 46:21.700]  they'll take they'll implode everything and if the yuppie see their stock
[46:21.700 --> 46:26.620]  portfolio lose 20% they'll they'll call the Republicans and they'll say better
[46:26.620 --> 46:30.860]  do what you're told and do Obamacare and then they'll hold his hostage again and
[46:30.860 --> 46:35.980]  again and again until we live in rack and ruin until we're totally bankrupted
[46:35.980 --> 46:40.340]  let's talk to Dave in Arizona Dave you're on the air what's your take on this
[46:40.340 --> 46:46.420]  whole situation yes Alex what was just thinking where we are right now is in
[46:46.420 --> 46:51.100]  Egypt and just look at Obama as the Pharaoh and they're just rubbing it in
[46:51.100 --> 46:55.780]  our faces day after day and now this Obamacare is the final stroll getting
[46:55.780 --> 47:01.380]  into our our health care and everything about us you know because they're trying
[47:01.380 --> 47:11.580]  to be God continue okay now what happens is I I'm trying to wake people up to
[47:11.580 --> 47:17.540]  this fact but a lot of people just don't seem to get it we need a name and a
[47:17.540 --> 47:23.020]  number in order to buy and sell no one can work in the United States without
[47:23.020 --> 47:27.500]  saying they're a US citizen or some citizens from other UN country controlled
[47:27.500 --> 47:31.060]  by the devil and and they can't work unless they have a number a social
[47:31.060 --> 47:37.260]  security number or in the UK it's an NIN national that's right it's opting in
[47:37.260 --> 47:41.220]  to the control grid with the numbers and the internet that brings you under its
[47:41.220 --> 47:45.460]  control that literally dials into your mind off of where you're going and what
[47:45.460 --> 47:49.940]  you're doing to add it to the rest of the giant global map the Pentagon and
[47:49.940 --> 47:54.580]  Google admittedly have to track the whole world in real time as a giant
[47:54.580 --> 48:00.700]  three-dimensional four-dimensional search engine
[48:00.700 --> 48:07.620]  16 through 18 tells me my God tells me not to buy and sell if someone makes me
[48:07.620 --> 48:13.660]  use a name and a number so I'm opting out of the system everywhere a lot of
[48:13.660 --> 48:16.700]  people are doing that and for a while that will work and that will hold the
[48:16.700 --> 48:20.660]  system back but they're already gearing up saying it's basically terrorism to
[48:20.660 --> 48:23.380]  try to live out on a piece of property even if you want to come in and pay
[48:23.380 --> 48:28.580]  with cash for your property taxes that turn you into a surf they'll have to
[48:28.580 --> 48:31.220]  send a SWAT team out to make sure you're not a terrorist and then of course
[48:31.220 --> 48:35.420]  they'll have to be taken in for questioning under homeland all over the
[48:35.420 --> 48:38.300]  country they're saying you're not allowed to have gardens now because you might
[48:38.300 --> 48:41.940]  grow something illegal we're all criminals the government is God I
[48:41.940 --> 48:45.940]  appreciate your call that's it's very very sad it's total bondage coming in
[48:45.940 --> 48:49.980]  but it doesn't matter the average man just sticks a football sticker on their
[48:49.980 --> 48:53.780]  car and talks about how manly that is and that's all that matters as long as
[48:53.780 --> 48:57.580]  they have football they don't care if their kids died of cancer from all the
[48:57.580 --> 49:02.180]  GMO and the shots they just they just want that manliness Pamela in
[49:02.180 --> 49:07.540]  California you're on the air go ahead hi thank you I have a little one in the
[49:07.540 --> 49:11.740]  background so hopefully it won't be too loud but I was calling because of Obama
[49:11.740 --> 49:18.700]  care and my heart is very sick and over the I've known so many people that have
[49:18.700 --> 49:25.220]  lost their jobs because of Obama care I know at least at least four restaurants
[49:25.220 --> 49:32.820]  that I used to go to they've closed a local hardware store has closed a local
[49:32.820 --> 49:38.540]  hair cutting place is closed so it's just it's very it's a very bad thing for
[49:38.540 --> 49:42.220]  America it's killing the middle class and that's what it was intended to do but
[49:42.220 --> 49:45.820]  it's okay for the big restaurant change they've all got exemptions and they
[49:45.820 --> 49:50.320]  already only have part-time employees they wrote the bill they all got the
[49:50.320 --> 49:54.180]  big consortium and said let's write the biggest screw job ever and they did and
[49:54.180 --> 49:58.660]  all the gullible sheep will love it I'm also going to be going to you so many
[49:58.660 --> 50:01.900]  soon so I can call you back and let you know how it was when I was there oh
[50:01.900 --> 50:06.700]  great yeah it'd probably be wonderful without all the enviro nazis messing
[50:06.700 --> 50:12.740]  with you I also want to point out something that even if we can't do this
[50:12.740 --> 50:19.660]  now during this current Congress Obama is not a natural born citizen no he came

[54:58.380 --> 55:02.780]  gonna respond Republicans got in the way of it so it wasn't implemented it's
[55:02.780 --> 55:06.060]  already been implemented letting the insurance companies force 35 million
[55:06.060 --> 55:09.700]  people to get care and lower the standard and have new government
[55:09.700 --> 55:14.860]  regulations to shut down smaller hospitals and clinics it's already been
[55:14.860 --> 55:18.940]  implemented and then they're just gonna say that the states and the
[55:18.940 --> 55:23.580]  Republicans blocked it and gotten its way and then that's why everything got
[55:23.580 --> 55:28.340]  screwed up that was always the plan as we told you three years ago with Dr.
[55:28.340 --> 55:32.780]  Blalock then the whole thing will shut down then they'll fully nationalize it
[55:32.780 --> 55:37.780]  and you'll get incredibly horrible care at five times the price and it'll all go
[55:37.780 --> 55:44.380]  to private interest that's why they're in control because they're gangsters that's
[55:44.380 --> 55:47.580]  why they're moving in now to try to shut down supplement companies all over the
[55:47.580 --> 55:53.620]  country the harassment the the FDA the all of it it is the deindustrialization
[55:53.620 --> 55:58.380]  of a country it's the takeover ladies and gentlemen and you're going to see it
[55:58.380 --> 56:01.700]  and in the select big interests are going to be flushed with all the bailout
[56:01.700 --> 56:05.220]  money trillions of it when you're not going to have anything or you can give
[56:05.220 --> 56:11.340]  up and go on welfare and then be their constituent be their slave coming up

[56:22.580 --> 56:27.620]  going to play Bernie Sanders the independent socialist in Congress up
[56:27.620 --> 56:33.180]  there reading Republicans from the passage of the Social Security Act back
[56:33.180 --> 56:38.220]  in the early 30s and he's reading what Republicans said it would do as if it
[56:38.220 --> 56:42.300]  discredits them when it's absolutely true what happened how we would become
[56:42.300 --> 56:46.380]  domesticated slaves of the government like animals in a zoo these are quotes
[56:46.380 --> 56:53.780]  how it would break down society how it's a con job because if you got 3% on
[56:53.780 --> 56:56.620]  average as a worker back on your investment you get about double what
[56:56.620 --> 57:00.740]  you get in Social Security those numbers are all out there with a little more
[57:00.740 --> 57:04.140]  risky investment you know five six seven eight nine percent which isn't really
[57:04.140 --> 57:08.780]  risky you're talking about triple quadruple but now they're going to
[57:08.780 --> 57:12.220]  implode the whole system of Social Security and nationalize the private

[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:53.500]  Senate and he does a lot of things I like I think he means well he's really a
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.380]  true believer like he fought the banker bailouts and these wars and stuff he's
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:04.220]  a true believer a useful idiot what is he the socialist independent from Maine and
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:11.220]  and he gets up there and he he he goes up where Vermont that's right Vermont I've
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:15.020]  got so much going on I flipped it in my mind the socialist independent from
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:23.180]  Vermont and he gets up there and covers all these letters and statements in
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:29.660]  Congress from 1935 debating the passage of Social Security as if it discredits
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:35.820]  everything when in truth if you know the facts it doesn't discredit the
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:46.940]  Republicans that said it how many years ago was that 1935 to 2013 we're talking
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:53.660]  about close to 80 years here ladies and gentlemen and it is extremely
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:02:01.300]  extremely frustrating to see the public go all the way going along with this
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:04.820]  because he's like oh Social Security will make us dependent people won't like it
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:09.020]  he goes people love it actually a lot of folks don't love it but they don't know
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:12.140]  that they would have gotten double or triple the money with a guaranteed
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:21.020]  investment of three four percent fitting on the time period even more and so yeah
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:24.380]  they think it's great that they get the $600 check or whatever every month I
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:30.340]  mean it would be a $2,000 check a $1500 check they just don't know God help them
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:35.020]  and he doesn't know and he's up there and it's just a portrait of ignorance let's
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:43.700]  talk to John in Texas John you're on the air thanks for holding Alex yeah hey

[01:02:55.300 --> 01:03:02.420]  that guy's name again Lord ha ha Lord ha yeah but anyway getting on to the
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:07.660]  the Obamacare when I was growing up nobody in the 1950s nobody had health
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:11.380]  insurance because you didn't need it the doctors had fair rates the hospital
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:15.220]  said fair rates he went to hospital you didn't you didn't get broke you know
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:20.180]  bankrupted but the insurance company like the mafia with a protection racket
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:23.940]  came in there and fixed things so either buy our insurance plans or you get

[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:57.820]  like $3,000 yeah and that's probably because he didn't have much money I know
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:02.820]  it was insurance look the hospitals are criminal operations now you go in they've
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:05.780]  got a health department computer asking you questions it's going right to the

[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:23.060]  then Stuart Rhodes is coming up with big breaking news from oath keepers but
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:28.220]  first here's four minutes of Bernie Sanders the senator from Vermont the
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:32.220]  socialist independent to trying to discredit Republicans from their
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:37.380]  statements in 1935 after the passage of Social Security saying with
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:42.340]  domesticated like in zoos and was a rip-off he says well people love Social
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.820]  Security because they don't know any better they don't know on average of the
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:48.860]  3% guaranteed investment of the money you put into Social Security you would
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:54.340]  get double on average back look it up on a 6% return that didn't guaranteed you'd
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:58.700]  get way more than double triple quadruple depending on the time frame how
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:02.460]  long it's in there they know this folks it's the domestication so of course
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:06.740]  something born in captivity any animal or a human doesn't know it so here's
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:11.100]  Bernie Sanders and listen to this he thinks it's discrediting Republicans
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:16.900]  from 1935 this is actually showing them to be profits here is the clip from the
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:22.500]  Senate yesterday afternoon let me take you madam president back to April of
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:30.340]  1935 when Social Security was just passed and let me quote what some of
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:36.300]  turns out Republicans had to say about Social Security at that time on April
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:42.900]  19th 1935 Republican Congressman John Tabor said this about Social Security and
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:48.700]  I quote never in the history of the world has any measure been brought he has
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:56.540]  so insidiously designed as to prevent business recovery to enslave workers to
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:02.780]  enslave workers was his language and to prevent any possibility of the
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:07.420]  employers providing work for the people well you go out and you ask most
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:12.060]  working people in Hawaii and in Vermont whether Social Security is quote-unquote
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:16.380]  enslaving them I think they would not understand what you were talking about
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:21.660]  because in fact since its inception Social Security has been enormously
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:27.020]  successful in reducing the poverty rate among seniors but it's not only
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:33.460]  Congressman Tabor in 1935 here's what Republican Congressman James Wadsworth
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:39.460]  told the American people he said that Social Security quote opens the door
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:45.500]  and invites the entrance into the political field of a power so vast so
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:50.340]  powerful and to threaten the integrity of our institutions and to pull the
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:56.460]  pillars of the temple down upon the heads of our descendants whoa and the
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:02.700]  quote world is just about coming to an end in 1935 because they passed Social
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:07.580]  Security Republican senator Daniel Hastings in 1935 called Social Security
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:12.180]  on American and told the American people that Social Security would quote end
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:16.780]  the progress of a great country and bring its people to the level of the
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:21.060]  average European end of quote not quite sure what that means but looks pretty
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:27.780]  scary on May 6th 1935 former Republican President Herbert Hoover former
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:31.540]  president of the United States said this about Social Security I quote as a
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:37.660]  matter of economic security alone we can find it in our jails the slaves had it
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:43.460]  our people are not ready to be turned into a national zoo our citizens
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:48.700]  classified labeled and directed by a form of self-approved keepers and the
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:54.380]  quote that is a former president of the United States on Social Security madam
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:58.940]  president's not widely known be honest with you I didn't know it but in 1936
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:04.940]  the Republicans campaign to repeal Social Security that year the Republican
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:10.300]  nominee for president Alph Landon said that Social Security quote is unjust
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:14.860]  unworkable stupidly drafted and wastefully financed and quote he called
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:19.620]  Social Security quote a fraud on the working man and a cruel hoax and said
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:24.220]  we must repeal Social Security the Republican Party is pledge to do this
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:31.380]  end of quote Alph Landon Republican candidate for president well turned out
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:36.620]  not quite to be the case turned out that Social Security will probably go down
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:43.140]  in history is maybe the most important and successful program ever passed by
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:47.740]  the United States Congress plays an enormous role in keeping seniors out
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:53.620]  of poverty all right helps people with disabilities so there you go yeah and
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:56.860]  people are gonna have a lot more disabilities eating GMO drinking fluoride
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:14:02.980]  and having all the aluminum dioxide sprayed out on the geoengineering that's
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:06.780]  going on you know under government-controlled care under corporate
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:12.100]  controlled care our life expectancy's gone down the neurological disorders the
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:19.300]  cancer the infant mortality rates gone up again this is a nightmare this system
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:22.940]  we live under and now they're going to wreck it for people that could pay for
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:26.660]  their insurance and the insurance that everybody gets is going to be basically
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:31.940]  crud unless you can pay triple or quadruple and go to premium private
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:38.860]  clinics that have the money to jump through all the Obamacare hoops or who
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:43.740]  refuse Obamacare entirely which this is going to move to try to block this is a
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:51.180]  mafia takeover it is 13,000 plus pages long with the bill and the writers the
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:55.900]  amendments and it's written to where they can change it as it goes and they
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:15:00.540]  can sit there and tweak it but it's so bad and meant to wreck the economy so
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:07.740]  fast that they've overdone it in their zealous lust to destroy this country and
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:13.020]  they have absolutely let too many special interests in to where it it won't
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:18.020]  even work it's designed to bring down the system but it's too good it's going to
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:23.140]  bring it down too fast and so of course the computers don't work of course the
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:27.140]  exchanges don't work of course other government computer systems don't work
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:35.300]  of course because it wasn't meant to work you're already there buying from the
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:39.340]  Big Ten insurance companies whose stock has doubled the last three years who
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:42.860]  wrote this to make you buy their overpriced garbage while the power
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:50.860]  structure maneuvers and works to go after everybody's basic liberties on
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:55.620]  every front they're not just nationalizing health care to give the
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:16:00.500]  business a select interest that run it they're not just nationalizing the
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:05.260]  automobile manufacturers to ship it to China they're taking everything over
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:11.220]  right now they are funding with all the fiat currency and the giant debt and the
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:17.060]  doubling of the national debt under Obama armies of bureaucrats hordes of
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:21.260]  agents to go out and eat out our substance to quote the Declaration of

[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:26.140]  manuals saying that the Founding Fathers would not be welcome in the

[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:11.020]  the reconstruction of the country as it was deemed in 1933 and then the
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:15.020]  expansion of the National Security Act where the whole shadow mafia government
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:20.660]  the opium trafficking government could go underground and be above the law and
[01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:25.460]  then just from there on out the secret military programs under NASA
[01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:29.580]  established by Eisenhower that's another shadow government group right

[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:48.860]  their cold-bloodedness and they see us as an infestation on the earth and it's
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:52.900]  their sacred duty to set up the control grid hit us with soft-kill weapons so we

[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:28.820]  middle of last week upon info wars dot com it was by Kit Daniels dealing with
[01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:33.660]  Obamacare to hire groups like acorn to come and get your personal information
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:37.260]  and basically sign you up for Obamacare and get your social security numbers and
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:41.460]  have access to government documents here's an article fraud firm gets okay
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:46.620]  to sign people up for Obamacare a seed to co a New York based community
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:49.820]  development organization was sued by the federal government for faking at least
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:56.020]  1,400 of 6,500 job placements under a 22.2 million dollar federally funded
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:00.220]  contract with the city but it doesn't matter obama's hiring him to carry out
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:09.020]  enrollment for the Affordable Care Act this is a mafia takeover that is the
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:13.660]  New York post up on drudge report dot com right now and I'm going to have Kit
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:18.660]  Daniels flashback his article the last week where we predicted this I remember
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:24.020]  the exact headline I think it was Obamacare there it is breaking door to
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:29.340]  door identity theft likely under Obamacare like the TSA a new wave of
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:34.020]  bureaucrats will abuse their power this time by stealing your identities boom
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:39.660]  and now a group that actually is engaged in mass fraud with fake identities
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:44.380]  raking in 22 mil according to the feds if you even believe that is being given
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:47.180]  it and again you got one part of the federal government trying to do their
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:51.020]  job the other part at the top being mafia we're going to go to break because
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:54.020]  this is a short segment long segment coming up with Stuart Rhodes for the rest of the hour
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:26:01.020]  the head of oath keepers they've just broken the news at oath keepers dot
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:06.780]  org oath keepers is going operational by forming special civilization preservation
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:10.660]  teams great way to get people involved in waking up oath keepers has been
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:14.700]  exploding I hear about it everywhere a lot of main line libertarians and
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.860]  conservatives are now joining it and supporting it the idea of keeping your
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:21.180]  oath against tyrants I want to get into this the next sec next segment
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:26.180]  Stuart Rhodes constitutional lawyer top of his class there at law school was at
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:29.740]  Yale and of course good friend of mine and he's also successfully fought cases
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:34.660]  for us when our reporters have been arrested winning those cases in civil
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:39.300]  court and he's just a great all-around guy retired out of the army as a
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:43.260]  paratrooper after an accident went to college his constitutional lawyer worked
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:46.660]  for Ron Paul he joins us when we got four or five minutes till we go to break
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:51.060]  here Stuart I want to get your take on Obamacare and how it's wrecking the
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:55.460]  economy I mean we told everybody but this is the road to surf them give us
[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:59.340]  your take on it then we'll get into all the big breaking news after the break
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:04.660]  well sure it's part of it's part of the subversion of the founders republic to
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:09.380]  remove options from the people and centralized power and control more and
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:13.100]  more of their lives and we know where this goes historically you wind up you
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:17.380]  do wind up with death panels in the end that's that's the purpose of it so but
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:20.180]  but it's also a distraction I think it's important for people to start
[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:24.420]  realizing that it's like the it's like rearrangement deck chairs on Titanic
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:28.820]  the dollar is doomed and this is just in many ways another distraction get you
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:32.420]  fighting over this while they do something else with the other hand and
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:36.300]  the other than something else is to prepare for the destruction of the
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:40.660]  republic that's why DHS is spending billions of dollars on ammunition but
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:44.500]  no food for relief in when the economy collapses and you should know the reason
[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:48.980]  why of course is because they intend for you to be as weak and as dependent as
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:55.580]  possible that's right and now we're learning the 7,000 plus giant armored
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:59.780]  vehicles they got this year alone are being deployed to local departments to
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:03.460]  battle the American people right they're pre-positioning supplies this is
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:07.020]  exactly what you would do if you're a military commander and had the luxury of
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:11.220]  doing so you you would pre-position and cash supplies in your areas of
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:14.580]  operation across the country you wouldn't have them in central central
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:17.540]  locations you'd have dispersed that's what they're doing along with
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:21.180]  federalizing and force multiplying through the local SWAT teams that's
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:25.860]  exactly why with an oath keepers we feel it's time for us to do the same on the
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:28.820]  side of liberty is to go into our communities and preposition supplies
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:32.980]  and force multiply by getting our local communities squared away and in
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:36.460]  particular get the veterans to wake up and realize their responsibilities and
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:42.020]  so we're gonna lead by example well you certainly are and there's no doubt we're
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:47.180]  moving towards the jump point where but we're not gonna be hit flat-footed we've
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:52.380]  been warning people so our credibility is rocketing how is the establishment
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:59.980]  gonna deal with that well what they can do is try to maximize the unprepared
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:04.060]  as the American people so that even if we can say we'll see we told you should
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:07.780]  told you told you so they're still overwhelmed during a crisis that's why
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:11.860]  it's incredibly important for us to make sure we're focused on actual physical
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:14.860]  achievement when in our local communities and being able to fill the
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:20.140]  vacuum the more prepared we are the less the cell is going to work the less
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:22.980]  the manipulation that's right we're not gonna have to physically fight we're
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:30.580]  gonna have to fight to help people and be leaders preferably preferably stay
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:34.660]  right there Stuart no I mean listen help in your community being involved
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:38.700]  being a leader is 90% of it if it goes physical it means we failed we'll be
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:44.060]  right back and we're not gonna turn our guns in folks everybody knows that
[01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:56.100]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:42.220]  civilization it is the shutdown of the economy it is the nationalization of
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:45.900]  economy by special interests that stand to gain from it that's what they've
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:51.060]  done in third world countries over and over again it's the globalist taking
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:54.660]  over our nation now saying oh our dollars down our stock markets down the
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:58.060]  communist Chinese that own our debt they're angry they say we better do it
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:02.540]  Obama says this is how you capture America is you economically take it
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:06.900]  over and then you declare George Washington to be the enemy and steward
[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:11.020]  about a month ago or three weeks ago it came out in judicial watch we wrote a
[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:15.100]  story about it that went all over the Internet and they said in the Army
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:18.700]  Manual the founding fathers would not be welcomed in today's military and
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:22.860]  anybody that doesn't like total government it's basically an enemy and I
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:28.260]  see this waking the military up you have 91% in a Reuters poll against the
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:32.660]  Syria war you have people talking about false flag terror all over the news I
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:36.740]  have people all over the place apologizing to me like a raldo Rivera
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:41.460]  saying you're right about the NSA and all this other stuff I'm seeing a giant
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:45.340]  awakening I see that is very very positive and I understand you're right
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:50.380]  they're gearing up for a big collapse but I don't see them being able to pull
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:54.020]  it off if people are aware that they did it and now they want to hold his
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:58.140]  hostage and say you know give us Obamacare which they admit is a tax to
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:01.940]  foreign banks and insurance companies or will gut the economy further at a
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:04.780]  certain point holding his hostage is not going to work anymore
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:08.500]  Stuart Rhodes of Oathkeepers well certainly there's an awareness in the
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:12.540]  military recently I was at an event and I had a special worker guy walk up to me
[01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:18.140]  current serving and tell me that at least half of his unit is awakened aware
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:22.980]  not just of the constitutional issues but also the economic issues the Federal
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:27.300]  Reserve is the destruction of a dollar you know the big picture and I asked him
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:29.820]  what about the rank and file in the infantry and he said well he figured
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:33.980]  least around 30% but I've heard from other special worker guys even higher
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:38.660]  that about 75 or 80% of the guys in special forces and Marine Force recon
[01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:44.300]  Navy Seals etc are awakened aware and paying attention the problem though is
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:49.980]  even if that's true they can still take advantage of a strategic weakness we
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:54.020]  have the American people have no food reserves we don't we have no strategic
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:59.260]  reserves any longer so they crash the economy there will be mass starvation
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:05.260]  and mass you know dependency upon the government and this manipulation of
[01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:09.020]  that emergency like a nationwide Katrina is what I worry about the most
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:14.540]  and as we said in our we post today you know of over a year ago we war game this
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:18.260]  and figure this is the best thing they can do they certainly are losing time
[01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:21.860]  we are waking up but what the one trump card they have left is to
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:27.780]  intensely collapse the economy and cause that kind of fear and anger that
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:31.620]  comes in an economic and by the way that's what Soviets and Communist these
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:35.180]  are bankers using that model they finance it in China and Russia so it's the
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:41.620]  same group this is what they use to bring down Romania Ukraine Poland it's
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:46.820]  what the Mao used to wipe out 80 plus million people over a decade they've
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:50.620]  got a game plan and it looks like they're planning to use it here right
[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:55.100]  consider it an economic neutron bomb it would kill people as much as an EMP
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:59.740]  striker did the same thing we used to have three years of grain reserved for
[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:03.380]  our people during the Cold War because we knew then the wake of a nuclear
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:07.460]  exchange they could take three years to grow crops again when economic collapse
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:12.100]  can be as catastrophic by interrupting the delivery of food systems and now in
[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:16.620]  an urbanized society it does not have its own capacity grow food you would have
[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:20.580]  the same result as if you had an EMP or a nuclear strike you would have millions
[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:23.660]  of Americans starving to death they could just sit back and wait two or three
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:28.260]  months and then riding like the Calvary bringing in you know you and peacekeepers
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:31.740]  by the way which is where the UN treaty would really be operational and then
[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:34.860]  they would say well the reason why we couldn't get food here fast enough is
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:38.500]  because of those extremists over there who were ambushing the checkpoints and
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:41.940]  and disrupting the delivery trying to take advantage of the collapse and they
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:45.420]  would blame it on the patriot movement so be a double whammy and to that you can
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:49.620]  add Brandon Smith one of our writers had a recent insight is that look they could
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:53.180]  just take the war with Syria and use that as their excuse they could they
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:57.620]  could have the US invade Syria and reprisal have China and Russia dump the
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:02.780]  dollar and demand only the use of the one or the or the Russian currency in
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:06.820]  instead of the dollar and cause a worldwide run on the dollar and dumping
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:09.860]  the dollar and destroy the dollar and then the bad guys would blame the
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:14.220]  Chinese rather than the the bankers who are really at fault they can say oh look
[01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:18.180]  this is warfare and if you if you disagree with our reaction to this and
[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:22.260]  the emergency measures that are necessary when you're aiding the enemy and so it
[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:27.500]  could be a compound situation of during a war letting that the clap the
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:31.300]  collapse be blamed on the enemy and then taking advantage domestically of the
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:36.140]  hysteria and the you know the anxiety the American people to go and round up
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:39.660]  disciplines this is what we're concerned about and so the way to counter that is
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:43.500]  to make sure that we provide for a local security and we provide for our loan
[01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:47.580]  our own strategic food reserve in our community you cannot store food only for
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:53.260]  you you must store it for your neighbors as well has to be done and they make fun
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:56.500]  of us when we say have firearms have food have water holders know how to use
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:39:01.340]  them the establishment is on record underground bases giant hordes of food
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:06.340]  hordes of weapons and and then Homeland Security orders two million dollars
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:09.180]  worth of paper targets ladies and gentlemen that's enough to train our
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:17.020]  army on of women in nightgowns old ladies in shower curtain robes little
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:21.780]  kids five-year-olds and it says no hesitation and then all their manuals
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:26.780]  say they're training for war and their enemy is George Washington I mean this
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:31.260]  is absurdist imagine they've been a movie 50 years ago where the government is
[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:36.020]  teaching people the founders are bad and that gun owners are the enemy and that
[01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:39.460]  people that aren't collectivist are bad I guess they made it in the 1980s it's
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:44.100]  called red dawn I mean this is really what's happening here and these people
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:48.980]  really mean business well say Patrick Henry said in his time when he looked
[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:54.060]  at the amassing of troops and naval forces off the coast of the colonies he
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:57.900]  said you know what are these preparations for is there any enemy in
[01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:01.700]  this court of the world to face Great Britain that would justify this
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:05.780]  it's accumulation of men and materials he said no they're meant for us they can
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:10.200]  meant for no other there's there's you know the the arming of DHS and
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:13.540]  distributing armored vehicles throughout our communities these fortified
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:17.500]  fusion centers they're not meant for al-qaeda that's not their concern it's
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:21.460]  obviously us but the question we have to answer is what are we gonna do about it
[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:24.940]  and what we decided to do with an oath capers is have and direct all of our
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:29.500]  members 30,000 members across the country to go operational in a sense of
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:34.300]  forming teams of people within their own communities based on the special forces
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:39.340]  a team model of having specialists in each field on a team who are there to
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:43.260]  then go and be a training cadre to force multiply to establish neighborhood
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:46.380]  watches in every community to wake up all the veterans organizations and
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:50.140]  encourage them to do the same to form teams that are sort of self-sufficient
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:54.900]  within their chapters who can operate in a local community to provide the
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:58.340]  stability and they'll try to demonize it like it's a militia even though that's
[01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:02.460]  part of the Constitution and every able-bodied male by by law is part of
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:06.580]  the posse that's the common law but expanding on this it's great to call
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:11.180]  them civilization preservation teams because that hijacks the popular mean
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:14.740]  of preparedness which they actually hijacked from us because we're getting
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:18.460]  people ready and then makes it more politically correct so that everybody
[01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:22.900]  can get ready and be all inclusive and it'll make it harder to infiltrate and
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:28.700]  radicalize because they try to infiltrate us to radicalize us to then set us up
[01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:34.220]  exactly and the point is not to establish some small elite group that's
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:37.820]  that's exclusive the point is to get everybody to replicate this we would
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:42.540]  like to see squared away self-sufficient teams in every neighborhood you should
[01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:46.940]  have a communications expert a medical expert that's been the info wars model
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:51.020]  in info war with the truth is to get everybody a citizen activist out there
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:55.300]  to establish a teams in every area to then force multiply and we've done that
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:58.700]  as well exactly do it in your own neighborhood I mean you could you can
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:03.240]  use what we are doing as a as a template or a model but then adapt it to your
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:07.380]  local area and the main thing is is that everybody in their own communities
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:11.860]  are squared away community is the most important thing and having people you
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:15.700]  know prepare in advance and get together in advance for mutual aid mutual
[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:19.420]  defense is critical and one other point is if you're looking at the prospect of
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:23.620]  a crackdown on dissidents what you don't want to do is be isolated afraid to
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:27.620]  associate with each other and waiting for the knock at the door in the night
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:31.340]  assaults and needs and said that's the wrong way to go you what you want to do
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:35.260]  is organize at the founding fathers did they organize as communities yes they
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:39.100]  had a secret organization the sons of liberty but otherwise the org organized
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:43.460]  very publicly in public militias and town hall meetings and they did that as a
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:47.980]  group and so they could not when it came to trying to arrest John Adams or Sam
[01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:51.780]  Adams and Hancock they couldn't just just worry about only them they had to
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:55.860]  worry about the entire community rising up and the advantage to that is that when
[01:42:55.860 --> 01:43:00.180]  you force them to bring in the army in the Marine Corps because they can't get
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:04.220]  away with it with their well vetted snatch teams because you're just too
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:08.100]  many of you organized that forces them to take the gloves off all the way and try
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:11.980]  to use a standing military which they don't control fully we already know that
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:16.860]  least I was about to say if we force them into that then we're probably going to
[01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:20.780]  win but I tell you this is a very dangerous period but look we've totally
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:26.100]  got the jump on them we laid out their entire battle plan decades ago patriots
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:29.420]  like red Beckman and countless others and and then I've been doing it 18 years
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:32.340]  you've been doing it for like a decade I don't know what they're going to do
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:36.180]  because everything we've said is now happening and that's what I've been
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:40.500]  hearing a couple years ago was 30% of the military now it's 50% and I run into
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:44.020]  the military on the street and they come over they know what's going on and I
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:47.660]  don't see how the globalists think they're going to pull this off well they
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:52.620]  must they must cause as much chaos as possible that's what an economic
[01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:58.140]  collapse could do as much desperation as possible look at Katrina you had
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:01.700]  people who otherwise might not have followed those orders going along with
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:04.740]  it because it perceived it as a catastrophic emergency which it was
[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:09.220]  and so they went along with things in that those emergency circumstances it's
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:12.900]  just human nature the less prepared you are and the more desperate you are the
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:16.980]  more likely your neighbors will clamor and beg for martial law and they will
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:21.100]  turn you in we'll turn their guns in for food we'll turn you in for food so we
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:25.820]  have to get meant to correct that every guerrilla fighter in in world history is
[01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:31.220]  known from now on down that the the resistance has to provide the stability
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:35.180]  and security for the people they don't the government will manipulate them so
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:39.700]  you must remove the dependency and the problem is our own government as I said
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:44.180]  is not preparing to feed us it's only preparing to shoot us and so we're going
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:48.340]  to have to fill the vacuum and provide that stability so I encourage all of you
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:52.820]  to think about it in terms of a strategic necessity that you store food for
[01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:57.140]  your neighbors even just beans and rice anything that you can do that's cheap is
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:00.620]  better than nothing so that they're not begging for more we've also got to
[01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:04.820]  prepare if they stage a false flag or whatever and say arrest me kill my
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:08.340]  takeout stir it because they really go for it you'll see a bunch of people
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:12.660]  Ron Paul have a stroke you know you'll hear about all these deaths going on if
[01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:15.740]  that happens everybody's got to get their print machines with their simple
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:20.780]  messages about the occupation now so that people understand so suddenly they
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:25.340]  see everywhere what this really is you've got to be the key info core out
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:30.100]  there the French resistance basically to put the V's up everywhere so people
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:35.380]  understand what's really happening yeah definitely agreed on that but I think
[01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:39.100]  the physical preparation in advance is more important than anything else at
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:43.820]  this point we already have a use that a critical mass is starting to wake up but
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:48.340]  there's still that physical weakness of not having food storage not having fuel
[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:52.220]  storage not being organized for mutual aid and defense in our communities we're
[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:56.180]  all atomized and fragmented how otherwise if that's why you can see
[01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:59.980]  somebody get rated the middle of the night by a SWAT team and the SWAT team is
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:03.060]  pretty confident the only only guy they got to worry about is that guy is
[01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:06.620]  underwear at three o'clock in the morning inside the house they're not worried
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:09.700]  about the entire community because the community is not organized they're all
[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:13.340]  afraid to organize that's the whole point of the NSA and letting you know
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:16.540]  they're watching you is that you are afraid to organize well I think the
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:21.140]  exact opposite is what you have to do you must organize as a community make it
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:24.900]  make it so that that's right that's right the great danger isn't being in fear
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:29.420]  then they win if we charge out and are ready they will fail I mean it's that
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:35.540]  simple right we can only get so many well-vetted and selected mercenaries who
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:38.460]  will do anything they're told there's only so many of those in the world in
[01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:42.260]  Russia where everyone was sat in their houses hoping the knock on the door
[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:45.820]  wouldn't come to them they could use a secret police into house-to-house one
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:50.060]  at a time but if you organize as a community that will not work because
[01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:53.820]  they'll be outnumbered like for example in Calispo, Montana where I lived the
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:59.740]  local BFW has 500 members in it there's no way some snatch team from DHS could
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:03.820]  possibly come into that community if all 500 of them were organized and ready to
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:07.220]  defend the people it couldn't be done they have to pull out that the National
[01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:11.100]  Guard at least or the US Army so that's what you want them to do you want to
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:15.420]  force them to not be able to use secret police was they can always have you
[01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:18.380]  want to force them to try to use a standing military and that's what
[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:23.020]  that's what they'll lose well the word I get just across the grapevine is when
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:26.380]  they start giving orders for guns or to round up Patriot leaders pull a false
[01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:32.940]  flag whoever gives those orders is gonna be in deep trouble definitely yeah
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:37.500]  definitely so I mean that's not me saying that's everybody's that default
[01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:41.620]  position is America knows there's a takeover we know we're the Americans
[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:45.700]  fighting a globalist takeover we are the resistance it's on they're shutting
[01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:49.660]  the whole country down right now and I think then and they're scanning all the
[01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:53.980]  airwaves they're scanning the web they know we're in a strong position Stuart I
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:58.540]  don't know if they're really gonna try to execute this I think they may back
[01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:02.820]  off when you've got Bob Woodward saying that this is the fault of Obama and and
[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:06.340]  all these generals turning against even the joint chiefs of staff chairman saying
[01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:12.060]  no you're not gonna hit Syria I think there's already been a partial soft
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:15.980]  counter coup within the power structure well actually and that's that's one of
[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:20.180]  the more dangerous things is that this could be a manipulation where they
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:25.820]  present you with a false choice between submitting to Obama and his handlers on
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:29.540]  the other side saying well you know the only answer that is a military coup
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:33.980]  military could be disastrous we're not calling for a military coup I understand
[01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:39.580]  I'm saying it's more of a stand down a good stand down in the military refusing
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:43.020]  to do this thing with al-qaeda to Syria that's what I'm saying I mean that's a
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:47.220]  good thing that Dempsey went and said no you're not going to do this no I
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:51.420]  agree but what I'm saying is is folks need to be aware that there's also the
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:55.700]  possibility of a slight of hand where they build up the military as a solution
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:59.180]  and say all the military coups only the only choice and I've heard this
[01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:03.020]  increasingly from for some elements in the right and I'm just saying guard
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:07.260]  against that the the answer is not for the military to step in and take over the
[01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:14.220]  country that'd be the end of our public no I don't want that either but if and I
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:17.100]  don't think they want to go with that bait and switch those stirred and I don't
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:21.140]  think the most the military people I've seen would not even want to be in
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:26.900]  control of something like that I'm saying the FBI the federal marshals the
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:32.020]  Secret Service and I'm not romanticizing those institutions they more and more
[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:34.780]  have been dragging their feet implementing tyranny they've been
[01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:39.460]  leaking stuff the military is just like wildfire waking up right now and I'm
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:46.940]  saying that itself just people not following illegal orders is is is more
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:53.260]  and more basically blocking the globalist yeah it's a good sign but like I
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:57.220]  said what they could then do is go with a nuclear option their economic
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:01.260]  neutron bomb crush the economy and sit back and wait for it all to implode
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:04.780]  wait for Americans be killing each other for food and then they can come in like
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:07.780]  the Calvary so that is that is still an option for them this is what I worry
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:10.700]  about them oh no I think you're right as you said last year on the show and as
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:13.940]  you're saying now and as you have in the paper that breaks it all down with a
[01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:18.420]  great analysis at info wars comm and oathkeepers org breaking right now I'm

[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:34.780]  fighting this tyranny and and we're not being sensational this is what we really
[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:38.700]  face but but when we come up against something this over the top it's hard
[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:42.340]  for even us I know to admit to ourselves that we're really dealing with the
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:46.900]  tyranny of this magnitude but in closing folks I guess can go to
[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:52.300]  oathkeepers.org and see the details on how in in their area to set up these
[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:57.580]  civilization preservation teams for the collapse of the collectivist are
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:01.820]  bringing in that they always bring in to domesticate and break a country through
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:05.660]  economic seeds this is siege of the whole nation we're under global a siege
[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:11.380]  the district of Mordor Mordor and the Potomac is running it and it's now time
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:16.780]  to really admit how much trouble we're in and start making real preparations right
[01:57:16.780 --> 01:57:20.260]  but it should not come from fear it should come from as you said a moment
[01:57:20.260 --> 01:57:24.180]  ago have have the you know the peace and the calm of knowing this is where you
[01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:28.180]  are in history just to just deal with it you know embrace the suck and and do
[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:31.420]  what you have to do but I think I think it's most important to focus on love
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:36.300]  loving your family love loving your children your country so look at it like
[01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:40.460]  that this is this is you doing what's right because it's right and letting go

[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:38.060]  key points the head of oath keepers you'd like to relate to people about the
[02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:43.820]  serious point our republic's gotten to well as I said before that they've
[02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:47.300]  turned the founder of public upside down and they weaken the people intentionally
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:51.300]  the people who stood to their powers told the only only answer is to go vote
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:55.940]  and then we're also bombarded with with you know one crisis after another and
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:59.300]  folks need to realize what's really going to count when the crap it's the fan
[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:03.500]  is whether you're squared away as a family if you and your circle of friends
[02:01:03.500 --> 02:01:07.580]  post friends have formed into a team for mutual assistance and self-defense and
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:10.500]  most importantly whether your neighborhood is squared away that's why I
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:13.620]  think the most important thing you do right now is go start a neighborhood
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:17.780]  watch you don't already have one start one throw a block party to get to know
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:21.820]  your neighbors become a community again and do it as fast as you possibly can
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:24.860]  and then reach out to your veterans and the veterans out there you have a duty
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:29.620]  responsibility to step up and train to spread your knowledge you know a lot the
[02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:33.300]  government's trained you in specialty they spent you know thousands or even
[02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:37.100]  sometimes millions of dollars on you to train you spread that knowledge through
[02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:40.740]  your community and get them organized lead them that's the most important thing
[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:43.400]  that can happen right now the neighborhood watches and local veterans
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:46.980]  stepping up and leading their communities if you do that you'll remove the

[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:33.980]  live from Austin Texas it's Alex Jones when I look at Obamacare and how on
[02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:40.180]  record we said last week in an article they're going to send out groups like
[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:47.700]  Akron and give them governmental power to basically threaten and intimidate
[02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:51.220]  people saying it's the law you better enroll and get your social security
[02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:58.060]  number and all your info that's what the census the last two rounds the last 13
[02:08:58.060 --> 02:09:01.060]  years was about was telling you you're gonna tell us how many toilets you got
[02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:03.580]  you're gonna tell us how much money you got you're gonna tell us if you own guns
[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:07.420]  many of the census forms had that we're gonna arrest you if you don't when the
[02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:11.940]  law didn't even say that it was about getting you accustomed to being
[02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:17.260]  interfaced with the bureaucrats with the system and now the New York Post fraud
[02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:22.780]  firms gets okay to sign people up for Obamacare the feds went after him for
[02:09:22.780 --> 02:09:32.340]  reportedly taking 22.2 million and creating fake applicants rampant fraud
[02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:35.420]  the New York City contract last year didn't stop a major nonprofit from
[02:09:35.420 --> 02:09:40.060]  landing a slew of federal contracts to sign people up for Obamacare seed co in
[02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:43.140]  New York based community development organization was sued by the federal
[02:09:43.140 --> 02:09:48.740]  government for faking at least 1,400 of the 6,500 job placements under 22 plus
[02:09:48.740 --> 02:09:52.980]  million dollar federally funded contract with the city eight months later the
[02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:58.100]  feds and seed co are teaming up this time to help medical insurance seekers
[02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:03.060]  maneuver through the maze that is the Affordable Care Act and this is all part
[02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:08.420]  of the teams are gonna be sending door to door you cannot make that up and last
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:13.740]  week hit Daniels wrote an article dealing with the door-to-door Obama teams
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:17.780]  and the identity fraud nightmare there's the headline breaking door-to-door
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:26.300]  identity theft likely under Obamacare devastatingly bizarre devastatingly
[02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:35.860]  strange devastatingly weird just absolutely over the top and the
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:40.780]  government shutdown is ongoing and they're saying oh in the AP we may lose
[02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:47.820]  our credit rating oh it's terrible the dollar values going down oh oh it's
[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:51.540]  horrible what the Republicans did there they're there like a foreign power I saw
[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:55.140]  this on the news last night as a talking point and on C-span have a foreign
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:58.900]  power shut down the government we go to war but the Republicans when the
[02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:03.100]  Democrats in the Senate voted this down and Republicans as well because they're
[02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:06.340]  bought and paid for by the financial interest that want to rape the American
[02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:11.140]  people see I want real prosperity you want prosperity you believe rising tide
[02:11:11.140 --> 02:11:16.020]  raises all ships they are pirates they believe in the opposite they believe if
[02:11:16.020 --> 02:11:20.100]  you're doing good in business even in a different area than them it's bad they
[02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:23.460]  believe you're in the same business as them oh my gosh it's the worst thing ever
[02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:28.940]  and cannot be allowed they don't even get how economies really work because
[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:33.980]  they're parasites it's unbelievable let's go to your phone calls Keith in
[02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:38.180]  Maryland you're on the air go ahead hey Alex how you doing pretty good sir great
[02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:43.380]  and you're the one who woke me up I want to thank you for that thank you sir and
[02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:48.660]  I had two points I want to make real quick one I did these people out here
[02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:53.300]  they just don't they don't get it they're not paying attention last night I sat
[02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:57.540]  there and I watched that illegal president of ours get on that TV and
[02:11:57.540 --> 02:12:02.740]  just out on that line of those people and I was appalled that no one questions at
[02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:08.380]  the press doesn't even question because to the Obama line it just makes me sick
[02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:15.260]  this whole Obamacare thing is meant to put us all into government dependence
[02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:18.260]  because we're not gonna be able to afford anything because he's cutting
[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:22.980]  everybody's jobs they're seeing people's bank accounts and this is gonna force us
[02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:27.420]  into being subservient to the government only say hope it does me I'm never
[02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:31.500]  gonna be subservient to the government but that's what the whole plan is that
[02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:35.340]  there's nothing to do with everybody getting health care they couldn't care
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:42.700]  less you know if this is a huge stroke for Obama I totally agree with you and
[02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:47.060]  now we're being lectured in the news that oh the communist Chinese they say
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:50.540]  the Chinese people really the horrible murderous Communist Party that's killed
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:55.860]  more people in history you know than anybody else the Chinese communists are
[02:12:55.860 --> 02:13:01.060]  now dictating our debt which most of it is banker debt that they signed us on to
[02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:06.820]  I mean it's so obvious it's such a fraud it's such a swindle but it's a swindle
[02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:10.540]  that's too big to fail we've been told so everything has to be committed to it
[02:13:10.540 --> 02:13:15.820]  everything has to be given to it no the answer is wake up to it and they'll try
[02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:20.860]  to hold us hostage just like Henry Paulson five years ago in 2008 threatened
[02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:26.460]  Congress in October October 3rd 2008 in closed-door session it's come out a
[02:13:26.460 --> 02:13:32.460]  year after he said if you don't give us unlimited money and do this there'll be
[02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:35.740]  tanks and blood in the streets and total collapse and that's what they're
[02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:39.300]  threatening you give us everything you let us totally rape everybody
[02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:43.740]  financially or we'll collapse everything when they're gonna collapse it
[02:13:43.740 --> 02:13:48.300]  anyways and now they're doing it again oh you won't give us Obamacare oh we'll
[02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:51.340]  just shut down the government say you did it and then we're gonna lose our
[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:55.780]  faith and credit we're gonna we're gonna collapse but then a strange thing
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:59.980]  happened Bob Woodward came out and said if shut down or debt ceiling cause
[02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:05.620]  economic crisis it's the president it's on the president's head Bob Woodward
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:10.540]  comes out and says that so again everybody better look at their grandkids
[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:14.260]  and their kids and ask you really want to do this because this country is being
[02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:17.940]  purposely maneuvered to collapse like every other nation is so the globalist
[02:14:17.940 --> 02:14:21.220]  can take it over they just want to have it on their terms and pose as saviors
[02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:25.060]  we've got to get the fact out they're the ones behind it our lives depend on
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:28.780]  this folks they're not trained to take on the American people and setting up
[02:14:28.780 --> 02:14:34.500]  cattle tail clergy response teams and putting in snooping hubs everywhere to
[02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:38.580]  play games they're building giant NSA centers everywhere that go online right
[02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:42.780]  now they're going online right now for a war against us with threat fusion
[02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:46.740]  centers to direct this whole operation the country already got taken over now
[02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:51.660]  it wants to mop everything up and this is a lot more than a mop-up operation
[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:55.580]  the minute we become aware of this operation against us it's over I'm
[02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:58.540]  talking to the military out there you don't have to believe me you know what's
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:02.740]  going on you know what you're being trained to do it's treason cotton dry
[02:15:02.740 --> 02:15:10.300]  no debate choose which side you're on commit to it commit to it commit to your
[02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:14.140]  decision and then go with it you think working with the new orders and make a
[02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:20.740]  good idea that go ahead work with them I just I can't believe it thank you Keith
[02:15:20.740 --> 02:15:26.060]  let's talk to Scott in Washington you're on the air yeah hello Alex
[02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:31.260]  hey buddy yeah yeah I wanted to talk about how it is affecting Medicaid and I
[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:35.860]  also had a brief story about the charity care for that food that claim that it
[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:40.580]  didn't exist personally involving me but it is intertwined with the Medicare or
[02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:45.780]  the Medicaid I should say in this particular state and I suspect it's
[02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:51.820]  being that way and a lot of states what the Medicaid is doing now is that the
[02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:56.980]  money that they're being paid by the federal mandate or the star of money
[02:15:56.980 --> 02:16:01.660]  that Obamacare took out of the Medicaid budget what they're doing now is
[02:16:01.660 --> 02:16:08.180]  pushing people on to HMOs and ironically I actually started a year ago today so
[02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:13.900]  you know you're paying the tax dollars to basically get the HMOs to give you
[02:16:13.900 --> 02:16:17.260]  crappy insurance or less of insurance that you would have gotten under the
[02:16:17.260 --> 02:16:21.300]  state when they you know when they would have rafting it out and paid it
[02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:25.580]  anyway so basically you know one way or the other and I suspect they'll probably
[02:16:25.580 --> 02:16:30.180]  start doing that with Medicare too you're going to wind up you know at the
[02:16:30.180 --> 02:16:35.740]  mercy of these HMOs anyway so that's one way that that's already gone into effect
[02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:41.460]  I don't know if anybody else is aware of it but it started in this state
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:48.500]  it is the HMOs I mean in the 50s 60s you name it you had anything you needed
[02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:53.100]  done if you were poor there was charity care and since the HMOs and the banks
[02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:57.140]  got involved they have jacked up the price of health care the most expensive
[02:16:57.140 --> 02:17:02.340]  in the world from the cheapest and the best we have the highest credit score
[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:07.340]  60 years ago we had the highest IQ 60 years ago the highest test score 60
[02:17:07.340 --> 02:17:11.900]  years ago though the some of the longest-lived people everything is the
[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:17.500]  opposite now government is a curse because it is a conduit through which
[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:23.220]  the parasites always not the low-level people that are dependent the globalists
[02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:28.420]  that the power elite always use it to control people and the insurance companies
[02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:33.740]  wrote this so of course their stock has doubled because it is a giant ripoff I
[02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:41.940]  agree with you oh yeah and briefly to the charity care in regards to my situation
[02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:47.580]  and that kind of explains my absence of not calling for a long while I had a
[02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:51.940]  situation at the early beginning of last year and I had ended up having an
[02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:57.300]  extended hospital stay for over three months at that point when I went into
[02:17:57.300 --> 02:18:02.060]  the hospital I did not have any insurance and when they tried to roll you
[02:18:02.060 --> 02:18:08.260]  and medicate it's usually a 90-day waiting period but the hospital which is
[02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:13.220]  very good may have its fault but franciscan hospital system is very good
[02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:18.140]  with working with charity care laws and actually they have an emergency
[02:18:18.140 --> 02:18:24.060]  thing actually at one point I was denied Medicaid and they were still treating me
[02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:29.300]  and then they went back and they found a higher tier of Medicaid to get me on but
[02:18:29.300 --> 02:18:34.980]  I ended up having over 373 thousand dollars in medical expenses that
[02:18:34.980 --> 02:18:42.900]  included agreement on my leg MRI cat scan $1500 a day and wound cost you know
[02:18:42.900 --> 02:18:48.460]  $500 a day and wound back all kinds of things that I had done and they were
[02:18:48.460 --> 02:18:52.820]  still treating me and I was a pin in case and in fact at one point I had been
[02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:57.620]  denied and the social worker came in and told me and I was aware of this that
[02:18:57.620 --> 02:19:01.380]  they would have just filled out a charity care application and taking care
[02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:05.660]  right and those are the good social workers and now under Obamacare and
[02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:09.300]  this has been done all over the world they're now not going to let them give
[02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:12.300]  you that option they're going to phase that out and you're somebody who's gone
[02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:16.140]  through it it's so frustrating for me who's watched it studied it knows what
[02:19:16.140 --> 02:19:21.660]  you're saying is true to have people calling me saying oh no now I'll get my
[02:19:21.660 --> 02:19:26.420]  free health care when a lot of these corrupt hospitals will not tell you that
[02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:30.740]  they're charities because they're really profit centers most hospitals are
[02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:34.100]  charities they were set up to be they're called hospitals because the first one
[02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:41.260]  was set up by the hospitlers a group of Catholic priests to take care of people
[02:19:41.260 --> 02:19:46.220]  during the Crusades who were chopped up and stuff and it's always been about
[02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:50.020]  charity that's what it's always been about and then now it's just become
[02:19:50.020 --> 02:19:53.460]  corrupt and a God bless you we're gonna come back with Max Kaiser then we're

[02:25:56.820 --> 02:26:01.500]  Max good to have you back on with us hey Alex Jones it's great to be with you
[02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:07.100]  once again yeah it's a panic here in the United Kingdom I'm coming to you from
[02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:12.380]  London you know in August 30th they had a vote in the House of Commons they voted
[02:26:12.380 --> 02:26:19.060]  for no action in Syria it was a very close vote only 13 difference and this
[02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:24.500]  is the direct result of alternative media your appearance here in the UK I
[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:29.540]  think had an impact the guy woke a lot of people up so they did not go into
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:33.420]  Syria and here in the UK people are panicking there's a program here in the
[02:26:33.420 --> 02:26:37.820]  UK where the government wants to subsidize speculation in the housing
[02:26:37.820 --> 02:26:43.020]  market they call it the help the buy scheme and the opposition made such a
[02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:48.460]  strong speech at their party conference that David Cameron has now brought that
[02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:53.340]  program forward by three months because he knows that the only way to buy votes
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:57.500]  the only way to stay in power the only way to appease the people with the
[02:26:57.500 --> 02:27:03.300]  pitchforks is to keep the Ponzi scheme going keep inflating the bubble and of
[02:27:03.300 --> 02:27:07.820]  course we have a champion here in the UK in the House of Commons who
[02:27:07.820 --> 02:27:12.420]  orchestrated this 13-vote victory for no action in Syria and of course I'm
[02:27:12.420 --> 02:27:16.820]  talking about George Galloway who you've had on your show he's fighting the good
[02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:20.940]  fight in the House of Parliament today Alex
[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:27.060]  where is the state of the world right now well the state of the world as you
[02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:33.100]  still have guys like Prince Bandar the Saudi if you remember he threatened
[02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:37.180]  Tony Blair when Tony Blair was in office he said if you don't call off that
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:41.780]  fraud investigation into my slush fund with the British Aerospace I am going
[02:27:41.780 --> 02:27:46.940]  to commit another 7-7 bus bombing act of terrorism in in London that's fully
[02:27:46.940 --> 02:27:50.900]  documented it's in the fight in the Financial Times it went before a judge
[02:27:50.900 --> 02:27:56.140]  Judge Patel so Prince Bandar threatened an act of terrorism in London to Tony
[02:27:56.140 --> 02:28:01.140]  Blair he then recently threatened the Russians he said I'm going to make
[02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:05.540]  another terrorist act happen in the Sochi Olympics unless you get my unless I
[02:28:05.540 --> 02:28:10.380]  get my way so the Saudis are still very much running the show and of course the
[02:28:10.380 --> 02:28:14.940]  Saudis were involved in 9-11 the Saudis are pulling the strings in Israel and
[02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:22.300]  again you've got a guy going back a little bit Tony Blair who is guilty of
[02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:27.060]  war crimes he's wanted I believe in several countries for war crimes and
[02:28:27.060 --> 02:28:33.900]  there's a growing movement in the UK to bring Tony Blair to the Hague have him
[02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:38.020]  tried for war crimes and maybe he'll meet the same fate of Saddam Hussein who
[02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:41.020]  knows we're gonna come back and talk about what you're doing George Galloway
[02:28:41.020 --> 02:28:44.700]  and they get into the larger economic issues but for those that don't know it's
[02:28:44.700 --> 02:28:50.180]  actually in the mainstream press overseas that Prince Bandar the Financial
[02:28:50.180 --> 02:28:54.100]  Times I remember covering that said I will activate Al Qaeda the same ones
[02:28:54.100 --> 02:28:57.300]  they're using against Syria the same ones they're funding and then they're
[02:28:57.300 --> 02:29:00.060]  threatening the Russians to blow up the Olympics if they didn't play ball I
[02:29:00.060 --> 02:29:04.700]  mean this is hiding in plain view the Saudis the head of their intelligence
[02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:11.940]  literally do not care well Alex you know in the United States as your previous
[02:29:11.940 --> 02:29:16.900]  guest outline they've got a police state to protect Americans from some kind of
[02:29:16.900 --> 02:29:22.020]  existential threat meanwhile Prince Bandar and the Saudis are openly
[02:29:22.020 --> 02:29:28.260]  threatening the leaders in the UK and around the world with terrorism using
[02:29:28.260 --> 02:29:34.020]  all kinds of nasty bombs to kill people and David Cameron doesn't say anything
[02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:37.180]  about it Barack Obama doesn't say anything about it so they're right
[02:29:37.180 --> 02:29:41.700]  right there is an open admission that they are terrorists Bandar is a terrorist
[02:29:41.700 --> 02:29:46.660]  Cameron's a terrorist stay there while this is having this is having you got a
[02:29:46.660 --> 02:29:51.820]  little break you're right they're terrorists we're on the March the
[02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:58.900]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:05.620]  Alex Jones here and I want to tell you about a long time friend of the show my
[02:30:05.620 --> 02:30:09.980]  patriot supply as you might remember this is the company that stood up to the
[02:30:09.980 --> 02:30:15.500]  DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food
[02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:21.100]  it has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share
[02:30:21.100 --> 02:30:26.020]  the same values as their fellow patriots my patriot supply brings us their

[02:33:19.860 --> 02:33:28.780]  live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:40.140]  you know be honest with you I cannot believe I'm on the radio I cannot believe
[02:33:40.140 --> 02:33:43.340]  we're reaching 15 million people a week conservatively one way or another
[02:33:43.340 --> 02:33:49.980]  they're XM AM and FM stations global shortwave YouTube prisonplanet.tv and I
[02:33:49.980 --> 02:33:54.300]  can't believe I'm talking to people like Geraldo Rivera yesterday and Rand Paul
[02:33:54.300 --> 02:34:00.380]  and Ron Paul and Ted Cruz and Charlie Sheen and Willie Nelson everything
[02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:04.140]  between I can't believe I'm talking to folks like you out there and but more
[02:34:04.140 --> 02:34:11.380]  importantly I can't believe that the establishment is so naked now in their
[02:34:11.380 --> 02:34:15.700]  corruption they just admit in all these financial publications we cover that
[02:34:15.700 --> 02:34:18.620]  they created the tens of trillions of debt to sign us on to it to make us slaves
[02:34:18.620 --> 02:34:22.300]  I mean listen to Bloomberg financial and they have guys up there bragging all
[02:34:22.300 --> 02:34:25.820]  the public will never stop us you know we've got them leveraged and it's the
[02:34:25.820 --> 02:34:30.540]  way it is we're holding all the pension funds they don't even hide this stuff
[02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:34.940]  they go on CNBC every day now and say we're run by foreign banks they've
[02:34:34.940 --> 02:34:38.740]  conquered everything the insurance companies are happy ah ha ha they're
[02:34:38.740 --> 02:34:44.380]  you know their stocks doubled in three years ah ha ha and what I don't get is
[02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:49.620]  even with like Hitler and Stalin and other bad guys they wouldn't brag
[02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:56.620]  publicly and that's something that really gets to me John Corzine didn't get
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:00.060]  criminally charged just like Max Kaiser said two years ago he wouldn't stealing
[02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:06.740]  millions in private money it I mean it it is insanity and then they're openly
[02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:10.140]  training to take on the American people openly saying we're terrorists if we're
[02:35:10.140 --> 02:35:15.300]  not total criminals I mean you read this stuff it's like absurdist beyond satire
[02:35:15.300 --> 02:35:20.620]  if I'd read Kurt Vonnegut satire which I did 20 years ago and then got to talk
[02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:23.700]  to Kurt Vonnegut and he sent me some art I'm not bragging it's just so weird that
[02:35:23.700 --> 02:35:28.100]  I talked to him before he died that he was a listener if Kurt Vonnegut wrote
[02:35:28.100 --> 02:35:32.300]  stuff this absurdist in the 50s or 60s no one would believe it even as absurdist
[02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:37.380]  it would be too absurd but then I look at people that aren't awake who are just
[02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:40.700]  into football or whatever and I get why it's happening but but Max you were
[02:35:40.700 --> 02:35:43.460]  getting into Bandar Bush we're gonna pull up some of these articles Bandar
[02:35:43.460 --> 02:35:48.180]  Bushes is nicknames such big buddies of the bushes coming out and saying if you
[02:35:48.180 --> 02:35:51.060]  don't do what I say I'm gonna bomb London and that's in the mainstream news
[02:35:51.060 --> 02:35:57.460]  there and then you've got a few weeks ago Bandar the head of intelligence for
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:36:01.340]  the Saudis former ambassador of the US says we will blow up the Olympics if you
[02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:06.180]  don't they publicly are financing the jihadis in Syria our militaries are
[02:36:06.180 --> 02:36:13.300]  waking up what is really going on here and and why are these elites so arrogant
[02:36:13.300 --> 02:36:17.180]  Max Kaiser well I mean he got away with not 11 didn't he I mean most of the
[02:36:17.180 --> 02:36:21.340]  hijackers were Saudi and we know Prince Bandar and Buzzy Kroengard and Tony
[02:36:21.340 --> 02:36:25.340]  Blair were trade I listen I'll tell you something Alex Jones within a few months
[02:36:25.340 --> 02:36:28.460]  there's a book coming out by a friend of mine who's already had a very very
[02:36:28.460 --> 02:36:32.020]  popular book went to the top of the best analysts in the York Times it's a new
[02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:38.060]  book he showed me the galleys chapter one talks about his eyewitness account
[02:36:38.060 --> 02:36:43.180]  being in the room in the CIA discussing trading inside information on the days
[02:36:43.180 --> 02:36:48.180]  ahead of 9-11 he's talking about Bandar he talks about Tony Blair he talks
[02:36:48.180 --> 02:36:51.580]  about Buzzy Kroengard this is coming out in a few months you should get him on
[02:36:51.580 --> 02:36:55.020]  your show he asked me you know I've already said more than I probably should
[02:36:55.020 --> 02:36:59.340]  have but what we're doing is we want to get Tony Blair in the Hague and bring
[02:36:59.340 --> 02:37:03.660]  him up on charges of a by the way let's go back I promise you'll get into this
[02:37:03.660 --> 02:37:06.700]  and talk about your thing you're doing with the number of parliament but let's
[02:37:06.700 --> 02:37:12.660]  stop right there yeah I know that Buzzy Kroengard executive director of the CIA
[02:37:12.660 --> 02:37:20.820]  of the subdirector did make the bets on United and American at their peak two
[02:37:20.820 --> 02:37:25.260]  weeks before set for that day right and we know that Prince Bandar was also
[02:37:25.260 --> 02:37:29.020]  making bets on those by the way that came out in the German news that's
[02:37:29.020 --> 02:37:34.620]  confirmed in der spiegel so you have a you you tell us about the author because
[02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:38.300]  for his own safety now you've seen the book it's not out yet tell us the name
[02:37:38.300 --> 02:37:44.380]  and everything so I'm gonna get him on this is this is a former CIA insider this
[02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:49.900]  is a former CIA insider who showed me the galleys of a book it's coming out I
[02:37:49.900 --> 02:37:54.140]  know the publisher in New York I met his publisher in New York and this is and he
[02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:58.100]  had a bestseller less than three years ago on the top of the New York Times best
[02:37:58.100 --> 02:38:01.020]  so well they know who it is Max so now that you've said this we got to say the
[02:38:01.020 --> 02:38:06.260]  name now I can't because I I'm not going to say any more because it would
[02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:11.580]  completely upset their he showed this to me confidence the only reason I
[02:38:11.580 --> 02:38:15.660]  mentioned is because Bandar and Tony Blair are such scoundrels but now with
[02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:18.900]  George Gallaway's project and I you know want to get into it here because he
[02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:24.300]  wants he's already raised 126 thousand pounds on Kickstarter for his film it's
[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:29.460]  called the killing of Tony Blair he talks about the killing financially that
[02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:34.260]  Tony Blair has made by trading on inside information based on 9-11 is not
[02:38:34.260 --> 02:38:38.260]  part of the it's not part of that film yet I wanted to get him into it but he
[02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:42.660]  does talk about Tony Blair making money trading blood for oil about all of his
[02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:46.180]  associations and friends in Parliament and around the world the killing of Tony
[02:38:46.180 --> 02:38:50.780]  Blair on Kickstarter so they got about 127 thousand pounds raised it's only five
[02:38:50.780 --> 02:38:57.580]  days left but the point of this film is to get Tony Blair into the egg and get
[02:38:57.580 --> 02:39:02.340]  him arrested for crimes against humanity which he is definitely committed
[02:39:02.340 --> 02:39:05.740]  he's he's been part of a genocide and this is what this film is all about so
[02:39:05.740 --> 02:39:10.340]  George Gallaway as you know he's a sitting member of Parliament and he has
[02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:16.180]  been extremely active in the anti-war coalition and it is because of him and
[02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:21.660]  alternative media that the British Parliament voted no to invading Syria on
[02:39:21.660 --> 02:39:25.700]  August 30th and of course when I say alternative media I mean global
[02:39:25.700 --> 02:39:29.140]  alternative media including Alex Jones you know you were just in the UK you were
[02:39:29.140 --> 02:39:32.780]  on the Andrew Neal show he made an incredible stir people saw a lot of
[02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:36.780]  people thought it was you know they were gobsmacked they were in who was this guy
[02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:41.700]  but it did get people's attention and heads returned and opinions were changed
[02:39:41.700 --> 02:39:48.460]  and so you alternative media George Gallaway saved lives they stop David
[02:39:48.460 --> 02:39:52.500]  Cameron in fact that's why I wanted to get you on a few weeks ago and how big
[02:39:52.500 --> 02:39:56.180]  a deal is it that usually England the UK's at the tip of the spear of any new
[02:39:56.180 --> 02:40:00.580]  Imperial War that's in shock waves around the world why did the power
[02:40:00.580 --> 02:40:06.500]  structure over there for the first time since 18 what was it 1880 something
[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:11.460]  when they gave up fighting us here in the US for the first time and in 200 plus
[02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:15.380]  years they stood down why that's exactly right because they're panicking
[02:40:15.380 --> 02:40:19.620]  because all because there's a sheet and there's a sea change in Britain because
[02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:22.860]  they've had the austerity seen America they try to print all the money and
[02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:26.540]  they've caused the reaction to the crisis was to print money to print food
[02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:29.820]  stamps and to try to paper over the crisis and they're just led to more
[02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:32.780]  crisis like that now they've shut down the government in the UK they tried
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:36.580]  something called austerity so the there's a lot of people the majority of
[02:40:36.580 --> 02:40:41.220]  people living here in the UK are they can't afford to heat their homes people
[02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:45.460]  are going to be frozen to death on the street this winter because of George
[02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:49.700]  Osborne and David Cameron that was their reaction to the crisis now that the
[02:40:49.700 --> 02:40:53.820]  people have woken up because of alternative media they are voting down
[02:40:53.820 --> 02:40:57.300]  the constituents the MPs they're hearing from their constituents all over
[02:40:57.300 --> 02:41:02.020]  Britain and they're saying we don't want these wars for Prince Bandar anymore we
[02:41:02.020 --> 02:41:05.980]  don't want these policies that make the bankers in the city wealthy anymore and
[02:41:05.980 --> 02:41:09.820]  there's a sea change here in Britain and Galloway's new project the killing of
[02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:14.980]  Tony Blair on Kickstarter is going to be a film that will be on the Festival
[02:41:14.980 --> 02:41:20.700]  Circuit and the thing about it is that here in the UK George Galloway does
[02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:24.220]  not get anywhere near the press attention against around the world
[02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:29.340]  because of the global alternative media influence that I have that you have that
[02:41:29.340 --> 02:41:33.420]  others have he has now been able to raise about two hundred thousand dollars to
[02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:38.060]  make a documentary and the sole purpose of this documentary is to put Tony Blair
[02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:44.140]  take him to the egg and have him convicted of war crime and and there's a
[02:41:44.140 --> 02:41:47.620]  good chance that this could succeed so people have a chance now to vote with
[02:41:47.620 --> 02:41:51.660]  their pocketbook to put up five bucks or ten bucks and help get this thing
[02:41:51.660 --> 02:41:55.420]  funded even more than what the original goal was because they want to increase
[02:41:55.420 --> 02:41:58.580]  the production values and they wanted played at Sundance and other festivals
[02:41:58.580 --> 02:42:03.180]  etc so everyone's had an impact the global alternative media has had an
[02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:07.940]  impact you have I have and George Galloway is our man in government he's
[02:42:07.940 --> 02:42:11.980]  our man in the House of Commons he represents what we're talking about so
[02:42:11.980 --> 02:42:17.980]  here's a chance now to let this entire momentum going after Tony Blair I
[02:42:17.980 --> 02:42:21.740]  remember when I was living in Paris Donald Rumsfeld came to a meeting and
[02:42:21.740 --> 02:42:27.980]  there was 50 or 60 Parisians running around Paris trying to catch him because
[02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:31.940]  he's wanted for war crimes had they caught him he would now be in the Hague
[02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:36.740]  he facing war crimes but he was able to elude capture when he was in Paris Tony
[02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:42.300]  Blair it's a similar situation he is violated human rights laws all over the
[02:42:42.300 --> 02:42:46.020]  world there's a posse looking for him George Galloway is gonna make a film it's
[02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:49.980]  called the killing of Tony Blair on Kickstarter people can put up five or
[02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:54.820]  ten bucks to contribute to the film and be a part of history because this it's a
[02:42:54.820 --> 02:42:58.820]  sea change it as your previous guest has alluded to there's really now we're at
[02:42:58.820 --> 02:43:03.340]  war now there there's no pretense that there's sure and you know in the past
[02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:07.620]  many years ago I could get George Galloway on when the media was spinning
[02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:11.460]  what he said or what he stood for he's a great speaker I agree with well you know
[02:43:11.460 --> 02:43:15.100]  a lot of what he has to say but now that you're here on my show raising money for
[02:43:15.100 --> 02:43:19.540]  his film I would hope that because we have his phone number his office number I
[02:43:19.540 --> 02:43:22.380]  would hope that you talk to his folks over there and get him on the show
[02:43:22.380 --> 02:43:27.940]  himself to try to you know promote his film done deal yeah I want to do that
[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:31.740]  because it is important to go after Tony Blair he is particularly nasty
[02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:35.860]  creature I think of him as kind of the British Obama this fake liberal who can
[02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:40.020]  get away with so much more because the left stands down what do you think is
[02:43:40.020 --> 02:43:43.340]  happening to Obama and the general awakening because I'm not trying to put
[02:43:43.340 --> 02:43:49.860]  good spin on this I cannot tell you how many famous people have contacted me and
[02:43:49.860 --> 02:43:54.900]  prominent people and generals and Hollywood folks and business people I
[02:43:54.900 --> 02:43:58.580]  mean I didn't even know Geraldo Rivera was gonna apologize to me during a break
[02:43:58.580 --> 02:44:03.140]  and halfway do it on air saying Alex you deserve an apology from everybody you
[02:44:03.140 --> 02:44:06.940]  know you were right about all this tyranny in the NSA and so much I think I
[02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:10.820]  made it safe for people who already knew what was going on to start to say more
[02:44:10.820 --> 02:44:15.180]  and more and now I'm hearing Rush Limbaugh say it looks like a frame job on
[02:44:15.180 --> 02:44:21.460]  Syria now you got Pat Buchanan Ron Paul Rand Paul Ted Cruz you've got mainline
[02:44:21.460 --> 02:44:25.780]  national radio Glenn Beck now sounds like me which is great great I mean he
[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:30.260]  literally takes my show and then rears at the morning but through his voice
[02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:35.460]  that's wonderful I mean I'm seeing and I'm not saying I get the credit I'm just
[02:44:35.460 --> 02:44:40.980]  part of that I'm seeing mega maps of success on every front via the ripples
[02:44:40.980 --> 02:44:45.180]  thanks to drudgereport.com helping us and and others but but my point is we're
[02:44:45.180 --> 02:44:49.180]  in the middle of a revolution of awakening it's so big and I know the
[02:44:49.180 --> 02:44:55.020]  power structure has got to be aware of that well yeah like I said in the UK
[02:44:55.020 --> 02:45:00.060]  they're panicking so Tony you know Cameron is is readjusting his policies
[02:45:00.060 --> 02:45:03.420]  to try to buy votes and as in the way I described it they have a thing called
[02:45:03.420 --> 02:45:06.840]  help to buy it's a Ponzi scheme for real estate they're accelerating it to the
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:11.580]  present to try to inflate this housing bubble which will guaranteed pop within
[02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:15.540]  24 months but I mean look at the US economy for a second take a step back
[02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:19.740]  because the government shut down in the US well what happened on Wall Street it
[02:45:19.740 --> 02:45:24.980]  went up not only did it go up but Carl Icon who's a billionaire shyster tweeted
[02:45:24.980 --> 02:45:29.940]  that he talked to the CEO of Apple Computer about $150 billion stock buy
[02:45:29.940 --> 02:45:33.980]  back of Apple Computer stock to help Carl Icon who incidentally bought billions
[02:45:33.980 --> 02:45:38.180]  of dollars of the Apple stock this is open trading on inside information open
[02:45:38.180 --> 02:45:43.340]  market manipulation using cash that Apple has off-shore because they don't
[02:45:43.340 --> 02:45:46.900]  want to pay tax to the American people on the cash off-shore that they made
[02:45:46.900 --> 02:45:50.100]  selling products to the American people they don't have jobs for the American
[02:45:50.100 --> 02:45:55.020]  people they have their products slave made in China and here you have Carl Icon
[02:45:55.020 --> 02:45:59.860]  doing deals $150 billion deal on a day that the government closes what does that
[02:45:59.860 --> 02:46:02.820]  tell you it tells you that there's two economies in America there's one
[02:46:02.820 --> 02:46:07.540]  economy which is Carl Icon Apple Computer Wall Street Goldman Sachs JP
[02:46:07.540 --> 02:46:10.740]  Morgan they have access to unlimited amounts of money from the Federal Reserve
[02:46:10.740 --> 02:46:14.100]  Bank at 0% interest rate and they can just print all the money they want for
[02:46:14.100 --> 02:46:17.780]  themselves all day long and then there's the other economy the people who are
[02:46:17.780 --> 02:46:23.100]  living paycheck to paycheck of which I believe 60% of America don't quote me on
[02:46:23.100 --> 02:46:28.900]  that but something on that order is living no I think it's 67% but yeah and
[02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:34.100]  then on top of it I will not pressing charges against stratcom officer the
[02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:38.780]  head of the nuclear weapons of the United States regarding fake casino chips I
[02:46:38.780 --> 02:46:43.620]  mean it's just the government is so corrupt it makes your head spin well
[02:46:43.620 --> 02:46:47.700]  there's the American dream and then there's the Saudi dream okay the Saudi
[02:46:47.700 --> 02:46:54.100]  dream is where you don't need the people because you just have a few slave pump
[02:46:54.100 --> 02:46:58.500]  oil you don't need the people and that's why in a Saudi Arabia you have 5,000
[02:46:58.500 --> 02:47:02.700]  princes and everyone else lives in destitute and poverty and then there's
[02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:07.540]  the American dream the American dream is now the Saudi dream you have 5,000
[02:47:07.540 --> 02:47:11.300]  Princelings who can go to the Federal Reserve they don't pump oil they pump
[02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:14.900]  money they can pump all the money they want all day long for themselves and
[02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:20.020]  they don't need workers they don't need tax revenue they don't need a GDP they
[02:47:20.020 --> 02:47:25.460]  don't need you they don't need 250 270 million a million Americans to have a
[02:47:25.460 --> 02:47:29.820]  job and pay taxes because they don't need that money the total they need is
[02:47:29.820 --> 02:47:33.580]  drones and huge armored vehicles being delivered to every city and preparations
[02:47:33.580 --> 02:47:38.340]  for absolute war against the people well that's tax revenue in the u.s. is
[02:47:38.340 --> 02:47:42.100]  something on the order of three trillion dollars the Federal Reserve has close to
[02:47:42.100 --> 02:47:45.820]  four trillion of that in debt on its 800 trillion dollars in derivatives around
[02:47:45.820 --> 02:47:49.820]  the world the American people don't generate enough tax revenue for people
[02:47:49.820 --> 02:47:54.300]  like Carl Icon to give a hoot they just don't matter anymore they don't add
[02:47:54.300 --> 02:47:58.460]  enough that's right that's right they've stolen over 1.5 quadrille and
[02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:03.100]  they're sitting there with space-based particle beams and weapons and they're
[02:48:03.100 --> 02:48:06.780]  running around saying we're going to merge with computers and be God on wired
[02:48:06.780 --> 02:48:12.300]  magazine the head of Google is saying I will be God and the only question is
[02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:15.700]  when do they release the bio weapon and to wipe us all out as they say they're
[02:48:15.700 --> 02:48:21.220]  getting ready to do well if they thought if they needed the taxes paid by the
[02:48:21.220 --> 02:48:27.220]  workers to fund the economy the government and the businesses they would
[02:48:27.220 --> 02:48:30.980]  not be out there with tanks killing well here's the only reason they can't
[02:48:30.980 --> 02:48:33.500]  release the bio weapons right now and they're very upset about it and they
[02:48:33.500 --> 02:48:36.340]  say they are by the way if you're a new listener and you're hearing this I'm not
[02:48:36.340 --> 02:48:40.500]  joking about all this they're on record saying this stuff is the Russians and
[02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:44.020]  I'm not loving the Russians but they're not under total globalist control they've
[02:48:44.020 --> 02:48:48.300]  got nuclear weapons the globalists run shining now they're they're working with
[02:48:48.300 --> 02:48:52.260]  them all that's left and I can't believe I'm saying this is Russia standing
[02:48:52.260 --> 02:48:57.580]  between us and psychopathic bankers that have nuclear weapons well who is the
[02:48:57.580 --> 02:49:01.940]  peace broker in Syria was Russia who's the peace broker in Iran Russia who's
[02:49:01.940 --> 02:49:05.660]  probably gonna bring peace between Israel and Palestine Russia so here you
[02:49:05.660 --> 02:49:09.340]  got a guy Vladimir Putin who should get the Nobel Peace Prize because he's
[02:49:09.340 --> 02:49:13.660]  actually promoting peace but no Barack Obama who sends drones into Pakistan and
[02:49:13.660 --> 02:49:17.420]  around the world for a quick buck so he can go golfing on the weekend he gets
[02:49:17.420 --> 02:49:22.460]  a peace prize makes no sense but it is true I mean look at Karzai he made
[02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:25.700]  401 bets with other people's money former head of Goldman Sachs head of
[02:49:25.700 --> 02:49:30.220]  ML Global and you predicted it and so did Gerald Salento actually had his money
[02:49:30.220 --> 02:49:34.540]  taken he did not get in any trouble these people yeah here's another
[02:49:34.540 --> 02:49:39.100]  prediction that I made and a few of the people made Peter Schiff and others
[02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:43.060]  there was a talk a couple of weeks ago about the taper they're gonna taper
[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:47.260]  quantitative easing I said very vocally and other people like Peter Schiff
[02:49:47.260 --> 02:49:52.020]  said that you can't taper a Ponzi scheme because it would collapse over no
[02:49:52.020 --> 02:49:55.300]  they're only going to accelerate it that's right they're gonna increase that
[02:49:55.300 --> 02:49:58.300]  85 billion dollars a month that they buying of government bonds to keep the
[02:49:58.300 --> 02:50:01.900]  bond market afloat in this huge Ponzi scheme it's gonna be increased and they
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:04.900]  use the money that they get from the Fed but they don't pay any money on again
[02:50:04.900 --> 02:50:08.300]  they don't need the workers they don't need your taxes they don't need your
[02:50:08.300 --> 02:50:12.660]  labor they just need you to be good little prisoners and be spied on all day
[02:50:12.660 --> 02:50:17.940]  and don't don't don't don't don't protest because in their argument is
[02:50:17.940 --> 02:50:20.940]  they've already stole the world it's theirs we're just here eating their
[02:50:20.940 --> 02:50:24.820]  resources that's how they say it and so they're just getting ready to kill us
[02:50:24.820 --> 02:50:28.220]  they're going as soon as we can take down Russia the bio weapons being
[02:50:28.220 --> 02:50:32.540]  released the other drones ready to spurs it over the cities are ready and the
[02:50:32.540 --> 02:50:37.100]  minute we take down Russia you're all dead our bunkers are built and the minute
[02:50:37.100 --> 02:50:41.660]  we take down Russia we're gonna kill everybody it's moon raker time does that
[02:50:41.660 --> 02:50:47.140]  sound fun max is that it our member Russia is aligned with China and Iran so
[02:50:47.140 --> 02:50:51.060]  good luck with that China's in the hip pocket of the globalist I'm telling you
[02:50:51.060 --> 02:50:56.020]  they're all the way they're lemmy winks right now we'll be right back with Max
[02:50:56.020 --> 02:51:02.700]  Kaiser stay with us from South Park every time you eat a cooked food your
[02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:06.420]  body responds by producing an increase in circulating white blood cells this
[02:51:06.420 --> 02:51:10.340]  happens because nature designed us to eat food that is undamaged at the
[02:51:10.340 --> 02:51:14.340]  molecular level when we heat food to normal cooking temperatures we change
[02:51:14.340 --> 02:51:18.540]  the shape of the molecules into shapes the body cannot use the body now looks
[02:51:18.540 --> 02:51:22.540]  at them as toxins and allergens in an effort to protect itself from this
[02:51:22.540 --> 02:51:26.060]  irritant the body intelligently increases the amount of circulating white
[02:51:26.060 --> 02:51:30.220]  blood cells to act as garbage collectors white blood cells gobble up all
[02:51:30.220 --> 02:51:34.020]  the unusable damaged food particles to neutralize their cell damaging properties
[02:51:34.020 --> 02:51:37.820]  this puts stress on your organs of elimination and your body is subject to

[02:54:38.780 --> 02:54:42.260]  through cycles Russia is going through a cycle where they're corrupt they're
[02:54:42.260 --> 02:54:47.340]  wild west but they're pro family pro Christ they're trying to find their
[02:54:47.340 --> 02:54:50.940]  morals they've been through 80 years of living hell meanwhile we're in a very
[02:54:50.940 --> 02:54:56.380]  decadent cycle and have psycho demons running everything and I just get
[02:54:56.380 --> 02:55:01.020]  chills when I think about it how much trouble we're in I have three children
[02:55:01.020 --> 02:55:05.100]  and I didn't mean to get emotional right now I just these people I don't even
[02:55:05.100 --> 02:55:09.020]  hate them I just want them off my back and then I look at the public who
[02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:14.540]  doesn't have any idea how much trouble we're in it makes me sick and how this
[02:55:14.540 --> 02:55:18.420]  is going to hurt poor people I don't like seeing people poor I really do want
[02:55:18.420 --> 02:55:22.020]  to build people up and I know that real free market does it not crony
[02:55:22.020 --> 02:55:26.660]  corruption Rand Paul offers a glimmer of hope I'm in shut down tries to go up
[02:55:26.660 --> 02:55:30.460]  with a plan to have some type of conference committee Obama says no
[02:55:30.460 --> 02:55:34.260]  wants to go forward because any shut down actually lets him create a bigger
[02:55:34.260 --> 02:55:38.500]  crisis Oathkeepers is going operational with a plan to try to save the country
[02:55:38.500 --> 02:55:42.180]  read that in info wars.com Paul Watson's article is getting no attention needs a
[02:55:42.180 --> 02:55:47.140]  lot of it insurance giants see stocks soar on launch of Obamacare totally sick
[02:55:47.140 --> 02:55:53.180]  Geraldo Rivera says his health care is doubled along with his crews since
[02:55:53.180 --> 02:55:58.300]  Obamacare went in that is by the way here's the headline Geraldo Rivera
[02:55:58.300 --> 02:56:02.740]  libertarian views on the war on drugs no the headline is he talked about
[02:56:02.740 --> 02:56:08.940]  government drug dealing and admitted that they were they're growing the opium
[02:56:08.940 --> 02:56:13.180]  that's the big he's an eyewitness to government drug production was the
[02:56:13.180 --> 02:56:16.460]  headline yesterday I told the crew I wanted a headline on that but it's not a
[02:56:16.460 --> 02:56:21.220]  big deal whatever it's like lots reality so sensational we like take it and then
[02:56:21.220 --> 02:56:25.860]  water it down it might as well become the mainstream media but that video is
[02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:33.820]  up on up on info wars dot com right now we're gonna go back to Max Kaiser here
[02:56:33.820 --> 02:56:39.140]  in a moment but we have this video that's up on info wars dot com they're
[02:56:39.140 --> 02:56:43.020]  blocking all the national parks including the Veterans Memorial which is
[02:56:43.020 --> 02:56:46.780]  just a you don't need any security there and they're telling World War two vets
[02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:49.440]  that were already coming on buses they couldn't be there so the World War two
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:54.660]  vets are going past the police and I guess you like Chalcescu in Romania or
[02:56:54.660 --> 02:56:58.180]  Vifra Vendetta fiction the police are backing off and aren't arresting them
[02:56:58.180 --> 02:57:02.860]  World War two vet knocks over shut down barrier to visit Memorial and now more
[02:57:02.860 --> 02:57:06.700]  doing it and of course they have cops there to tell people they can't be there
[02:57:06.700 --> 02:57:12.740]  though that's not being shut down Max Kaiser your take on this well you know
[02:57:12.740 --> 02:57:17.420]  the the government shutdown is it is a travesty of course but like I said
[02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:22.020]  earlier it proves with the stock market rising in these multi hundred billion
[02:57:22.020 --> 02:57:26.340]  dollar deals that there's a class of people in America that does not need
[02:57:26.340 --> 02:57:29.860]  taxpayers they don't need workers and the sooner they exterminate them the
[02:57:29.860 --> 02:57:33.220]  better we've seen it before and you scapegoat a group of people you
[02:57:33.220 --> 02:57:36.740]  exterminate them it's the final solution it's coming to America that's why I
[02:57:36.740 --> 02:57:39.820]  don't live in America it's too freaking dangerous it's run by kleptocrats and
[02:57:39.820 --> 02:57:44.180]  there's no upside there I've seen the Grand Canyon so I'll say this people are
[02:57:44.180 --> 02:57:48.380]  awake in America they're even more awake in England which is surprising and the
[02:57:48.380 --> 02:57:53.420]  police like half the police for listeners I mean you were there but I had
[02:57:53.420 --> 02:57:57.500]  like MI5 showing up giving me intel that turned out to be true I've talked to
[02:57:57.500 --> 02:58:03.500]  police that off record were absolutely hating the Bilderbergs some I tell you
[02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:07.740]  why because in the UK they have something called the working class there
[02:58:07.740 --> 02:58:11.660]  there are blue collar workers cops firemen people who work in hospitals
[02:58:11.660 --> 02:58:15.260]  teachers professors to their working class they have that in the Britain they
[02:58:15.260 --> 02:58:19.500]  don't have an America anymore you've got the destitute and the fabulous nothing
[02:58:19.500 --> 02:58:24.660]  in between but but I will say this I mean the British establishment people got
[02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:29.020]  that the guys were in there screwing them because they're middle class common
[02:58:29.020 --> 02:58:33.660]  sense people stay there max guys are gonna come back by the way it's almost

[03:00:33.460 --> 03:00:37.220]  should have been plugging the entire three hours that we're in a live special
[03:00:37.220 --> 03:00:40.780]  hour and a half transmission with special reports the latest on the
[03:00:40.780 --> 03:00:44.220]  government shutdown we'll know a lot by this evening of exactly where all this
[03:00:44.220 --> 03:00:49.540]  is going big round up with myself jacari Jackson Gigi Arnetta Leanne
[03:00:49.540 --> 03:00:55.620]  McAdoo David Knight John bound again yours truly we got some special guests

[03:01:06.820 --> 03:01:12.540]  special transmission tonight max Kaiser max Kaiser commas our guests you can
[03:01:12.540 --> 03:01:16.260]  find that Kickstarter campaign but I think it's a very worthy goal to try to
[03:01:16.260 --> 03:01:20.420]  get a movement going and a film can do that to have war crimes on Tony Blair
[03:01:20.420 --> 03:01:25.140]  and make him run to Paraguay down there with the bushes I've had Dr. Corsi on
[03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:29.100]  who did a lot of black ops work obviously folks you know his family grew up
[03:01:29.100 --> 03:01:32.900]  with the Kennedys and stuff just to leave it at that and move forward coming
[03:01:32.900 --> 03:01:36.140]  out saying the bushes and the Saudis and all these countries New World Order and
[03:01:36.140 --> 03:01:40.300]  the government's corrupt and murderous and their staging terror and sounds just
[03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:45.180]  like me he always knew that Geraldo Rivera always knew what was going on now
[03:01:45.180 --> 03:01:49.820]  it's safe because everybody's waking up now all these prominent people can go
[03:01:49.820 --> 03:01:53.860]  public that's why you've got to hit the bar bar first you've got to do like Max
[03:01:53.860 --> 03:01:57.660]  Kaiser's done who's sometimes more radical than I am it's accurate what he
[03:01:57.660 --> 03:02:03.020]  says but he's got bigger wavos rancheros than I do you've got to tell it so that
[03:02:03.020 --> 03:02:06.660]  it makes it safe for other people to come behind you then you reach critical
[03:02:06.660 --> 03:02:12.660]  mass and in closing Max Kaiser I think we're reaching critical mass yeah well
[03:02:12.660 --> 03:02:16.500]  I think I think we are because again I just returned to what's happening in the
[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:21.540]  UK they stopped that going into war which was the first time in 200 years the
[03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:25.700]  people in the UK are definitely awake and the people in the US are now starting
[03:02:25.700 --> 03:02:31.420]  to get awake I think and the economics are such where the wholesale
[03:02:31.420 --> 03:02:36.420]  confiscation of wealth from the middle to the top is becoming more than just an
[03:02:36.420 --> 03:02:41.740]  inconvenience it's becoming a huge social issue because people are now
[03:02:41.740 --> 03:02:46.700]  suffering in the millions in in all over the all over the world including the
[03:02:46.700 --> 03:02:51.140]  US and the UK so these people are now trying to figure out what went wrong how
[03:02:51.140 --> 03:02:55.100]  to get things back I mean the Obamacare is a disaster basically for one simple
[03:02:55.100 --> 03:02:59.140]  reason they're taking healthcare and they're turning it into a stock market
[03:02:59.140 --> 03:03:04.060]  so and all the abuse the past 20 years has been this monetization of
[03:03:04.060 --> 03:03:08.420]  corporations and municipalities everything that they do turning it into a
[03:03:08.420 --> 03:03:12.700]  market a stock market of some kind and then it becomes manipulated by stock
[03:03:12.700 --> 03:03:16.180]  market manipulators so the idea of turning healthcare into a stock market
[03:03:16.180 --> 03:03:21.540]  was concocted by stock brokers I as a former stock broker have already
[03:03:21.540 --> 03:03:24.820]  figured out 20 different ways to game this health care system and to make
[03:03:24.820 --> 03:03:29.420]  money on it by trading it as a stock market of course and that's why people
[03:03:29.420 --> 03:03:32.740]  who are in the stock market business and that's the number one business in the
[03:03:32.740 --> 03:03:37.380]  UK and the US is financialization finance is they love it because they're
[03:03:37.380 --> 03:03:41.060]  going to make a bundle I mean while prices are going to go up all those
[03:03:41.060 --> 03:03:44.220]  prices today that people are saying I'm saving money in my health care that's
[03:03:44.220 --> 03:03:48.340]  like the teaser rate when the credit card says here's 4% but in that in a year
[03:03:48.340 --> 03:03:51.300]  from now it's going to go to 27 it's like a it's like an adjustable rate
[03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:55.220]  mortgage yeah exactly so in a year from now everyone's health care will be
[03:03:55.220 --> 03:03:58.780]  higher than it is there ever has been health care is only going one way and
[03:03:58.780 --> 03:04:03.540]  as your reporter actor you know very accurately pointed out all the health
[03:04:03.540 --> 03:04:09.060]  care insurance stocks boom today I mean that's another huge bailout of the
[03:04:09.060 --> 03:04:15.820]  health care industry another huge gift to a rapacious invidious sociopathic
[03:04:15.820 --> 03:04:19.980]  group of kleptocrats by the Obama administration how much how much
[03:04:19.980 --> 03:04:23.220]  billions and hundreds of billions is it going to give to the to the
[03:04:23.220 --> 03:04:27.100]  cacostocracy the worst elements of society when is it going to end with this
[03:04:27.100 --> 03:04:31.140]  psychopath and they're not just stealing it they openly work to shut down our
[03:04:31.140 --> 03:04:35.260]  economy because they know making us poor makes us where we can't fight them I
[03:04:35.260 --> 03:04:39.540]  mean they they are just they are the worst in Iraq they put on the sanctions
[03:04:39.540 --> 03:04:42.700]  and then they bombed them to came and come these are this is the equivalent of
[03:04:42.700 --> 03:04:45.620]  public care is the equivalent of sanctions before they come in and just pick up
[03:04:45.620 --> 03:04:49.620]  the dirt and the dust and go to the ovens I'm going to use that analogy you're
[03:04:49.620 --> 03:04:52.940]  absolutely right we're under total siege max geyser thank you so much for your
