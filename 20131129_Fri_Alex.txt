[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:28.080]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Friday November 29th 2013 the Friday
[00:28.080 --> 00:32.720]  after Thanksgiving or as it's now being called gray Thursday or black Thursday
[00:32.720 --> 00:36.920]  there's a lot of craziness going on out there as you know if you're driving
[00:36.920 --> 00:39.200]  around if you're looking at any of these shopping centers we're going to be
[00:39.200 --> 00:43.160]  talking to several people today about that this we're going to have Alex Jones
[00:43.160 --> 00:45.960]  at the bottom of the hour breaking this down force we're also going to be
[00:45.960 --> 00:49.840]  talking to Anthony Gutiarty and taking your calls in the second hour we've got
[00:49.840 --> 00:53.440]  Mark dice coming on the show later he's got a video right now that's top linked
[00:53.440 --> 00:58.560]  on drudge and is on info wars.com Santa with a megaphone shames Thanksgiving
[00:58.560 --> 01:03.840]  parasite shoppers that's a pretty funny video we've got a video from Paul Joseph
[01:03.840 --> 01:07.160]  Watson that we're going to be playing in the next segment and it's a real
[01:07.160 --> 01:11.680]  interesting video because what he's got mixed in there is scenes of people
[01:11.680 --> 01:16.280]  shopping on black Friday on black Thursday otherwise known as Thanksgiving
[01:16.280 --> 01:20.840]  formerly known as Thanksgiving he's got these scenes mixed in with zombie
[01:20.840 --> 01:24.280]  movies and it's pretty indistinguishable and take a look at it so if
[01:24.280 --> 01:28.640]  you're listening to us on on radio I'm going to describe some of that for you
[01:28.640 --> 01:32.000]  but if you're watching stay tuned for that because that's really funny and
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.600]  then we're going to have Paul Watson in the third hour so there's a lot of news
[01:36.600 --> 01:40.280]  here but we've got some updates to some stories that have been happening in just
[01:40.280 --> 01:43.760]  the last week you know this is a constant trend of the government going
[01:43.760 --> 01:47.480]  through and looking at our data we've heard so much about the NSA from Ed
[01:47.480 --> 01:51.280]  Snowden's leaks but it's not just the federal government that's doing it and
[01:51.280 --> 01:54.640]  of course the federal government is training local law enforcement and
[01:54.640 --> 01:58.040]  state law enforcement to act the way that they act now we have a report here
[01:58.040 --> 02:03.640]  that's also on Drudge this is from Mikhail Thalen and it's on info wars.com
[02:03.640 --> 02:08.080]  South Carolina police grab innocent cell users data through tower dumps that's
[02:08.080 --> 02:13.560]  what they call it a tower dump allows them to grab all calls all text all data
[02:13.560 --> 02:18.280]  transmissions from any specific time from a cell towers provider and this is
[02:18.280 --> 02:23.000]  being done by the Richland County Sheriff's Office and they're turning
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.240]  over everybody's telephone data to the police unrelated any suspicion of crime
[02:27.240 --> 02:31.040]  according to a First Amendment attorney J Bender he says I think that's an
[02:31.040 --> 02:35.240]  unreasonable search and seizure well absolutely what they're doing is they're
[02:35.240 --> 02:39.880]  grabbing metadata and that's important you can tell what people are doing you
[02:39.880 --> 02:42.920]  can track their movements just last month the Senate Judiciary Committee the
[02:42.920 --> 02:48.880]  article goes on to say hearing revealed that a 2010 NSA pilot project that used
[02:48.880 --> 02:53.000]  cell phone towers to map people's locations unknowingly that's your
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.240]  metadata if they look at your metadata they can tell where you're traveling
[02:56.240 --> 02:58.720]  they can tell what your political religious affiliations are they can
[02:58.720 --> 03:04.200]  totally profile you and in most societies that in a free and open
[03:04.200 --> 03:08.120]  society that wouldn't be a problem but when you've got a government that wants
[03:08.120 --> 03:13.560]  to control you and wants to ignore the law themselves that says at the same
[03:13.560 --> 03:16.880]  time they acclaim that they have a right to look at everything that you do
[03:16.880 --> 03:20.800]  they're also saying you have a right to look at nothing that they do you don't
[03:20.800 --> 03:24.080]  have any rights to see what our government is doing they're totally
[03:24.080 --> 03:27.400]  opaque there's absolutely no transparency and yet they demand to see
[03:27.400 --> 03:30.960]  everything that we do that's why you should be concerned about metadata but
[03:30.960 --> 03:33.920]  it's also why you should be concerned about the definition of what's
[03:33.920 --> 03:37.600]  reasonable you know doesn't just mean that it's something that's not out of the
[03:37.600 --> 03:41.520]  ordinary because the government is always moving that normalcy bias what it
[03:41.520 --> 03:45.440]  means is they don't have a reason they don't have a reason to grab your cell
[03:45.440 --> 03:49.200]  data they should not be allowed to and it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment
[03:49.200 --> 03:55.320]  now quickly just before the break here we've also got an update on drunk driving
[03:55.320 --> 04:00.280]  you remember they were taking people's breath they wanted voluntarily according
[04:00.280 --> 04:05.080]  to the NHTSA the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration they
[04:05.080 --> 04:09.880]  wanted to voluntarily take people's blood or breath in Fort Worth and
[04:09.880 --> 04:13.160]  initially the Fort Worth Police Department so that wasn't going on they
[04:13.160 --> 04:17.280]  then had to admit that it was but it was just part of a study well it turns out
[04:17.280 --> 04:23.600]  that of course this study is going to be used to justify lowering the definition
[04:23.600 --> 04:30.160]  of drunk driving from 08 to 0.05 that's what they're really trying to push this
[04:30.160 --> 04:33.120]  is like an agenda from the federal government that they're trying to push
[04:33.120 --> 04:37.200]  on us that's why we need to push back that's why we need to have juries as
[04:37.200 --> 04:41.200]  we've mentioned the other day that look at the definition of drunkenness because
[04:41.200 --> 04:44.960]  the legislature is not going to do it and actually make sure that justice is
[04:44.960 --> 04:48.240]  being done we need some oversight of what the government is doing juries
[04:48.240 --> 04:52.320]  provide us with that it's one of our best defenses we'll be right back we got a
[04:52.320 --> 04:57.520]  big show today on the madness of crowds so stay tuned

[08:52.160 --> 08:56.720]  Thanksgiving parasite shoppers so you got to see that we're going to talk to
[08:56.720 --> 09:00.360]  Mark Dice about that he put on a Santa Claus outfit and bullhorned shoppers
[09:00.360 --> 09:05.560]  who've been waiting all night for specials on Black Friday and that kind of
[09:05.560 --> 09:08.360]  brings up as we see what's going on with that and we see what's going on with
[09:08.360 --> 09:13.840]  Bitcoin what does it really mean how do you really assess value and what does it
[09:13.840 --> 09:17.560]  say about our society when we see these types of things happening at Walmart
[09:17.560 --> 09:23.320]  people fighting each other over TVs or toasters and we see these knockout games
[09:23.320 --> 09:27.280]  happening in the urban centers what do you think's going to happen if things
[09:27.280 --> 09:31.680]  get really tough in this society but first of all how do you assess value
[09:31.680 --> 09:35.440]  let's take a look at Bitcoin you know it was just about a week ago or maybe 10
[09:35.440 --> 09:41.920]  days ago that was about $400 it passed gold and value momentarily today just in
[09:41.920 --> 09:47.320]  the last 24 hours we have an article up on infowars.com Bitcoin worth more than
[09:47.320 --> 09:53.000]  gold then collapses well it's still about 1160 dollars I think with gold
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.200]  being a little over $1,200 articles are coming out from Forbes magazine
[09:59.200 --> 10:04.480]  comparing it to South Sea bubble territory and they said it looks like the
[10:04.480 --> 10:07.200]  same sort of bubble that we see now if you don't know what the South Sea bubble
[10:07.200 --> 10:11.640]  is it's a classic bubble it was explored in the book popular delusions and the
[10:11.640 --> 10:16.520]  madness of crowds is written in the early 1800s and it's when we see
[10:16.520 --> 10:22.000]  exponential price and then immediately dropping in value and that's what people
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.920]  are concerned about with Bitcoin it's suckered in a lot of very smart people
[10:25.920 --> 10:32.600]  in the South Sea bubble it's suckered in Isaac Newton Isaac Newton was a pretty
[10:32.600 --> 10:38.160]  intelligent person he invented calculus he worked out the tides came up with
[10:38.160 --> 10:41.600]  equations for the tides something nobody else had done before very
[10:41.600 --> 10:46.080]  intelligent guy but he got suckered in to the stock market this is a situation
[10:46.080 --> 10:50.440]  where the South Sea company had been given a monopoly on all trade with South
[10:50.440 --> 10:53.880]  America now you would think that's a pretty sure deal and a lot of people
[10:53.880 --> 10:58.120]  did but then they started doing crazy things and since you could kind of say
[10:58.120 --> 11:02.640]  there was a lot of speculation like derivative market that we've seen and
[11:02.640 --> 11:07.480]  it got out of hand and the beginning of it it looked exactly like what we're
[11:07.480 --> 11:11.600]  seeing now with Bitcoin Bitcoin starting out at $400 and over the weekend
[11:11.600 --> 11:16.080]  first weekend last weekend I think it was it went up to like five or $600 then
[11:16.080 --> 11:21.040]  jumped to $800 $900 and $1,200 it's going straight up and if you look at this
[11:21.040 --> 11:25.760]  graph that's on the article comparing it to the price of gold it's absolutely
[11:25.760 --> 11:29.360]  amazing but pull up this article guys for for people who are looking at it this
[11:29.360 --> 11:33.120]  is the one showing Isaac Newton's nightmare it's how he went broke and
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.680]  basically it's the upward curve it just goes straight up exponentially not like
[11:38.680 --> 11:41.560]  climate change that's what they would like us to think is going up
[11:41.560 --> 11:45.000]  exponentially that's not that's staying flat but this is a real exponential
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.080]  curve just kind of popping along and Newton invests a little bit at the very
[11:49.080 --> 11:52.560]  beginning and then he gets out as it jumps up and so they've got a line here
[11:52.560 --> 11:56.600]  Newton exits very happy but then he waits a while and it's just going straight up
[11:56.600 --> 12:00.520]  and says Newton's friends are getting rich so now he reenters but
[12:00.520 --> 12:04.720]  unfortunately he reenters now at about the top of the bubble the bubble burst
[12:04.720 --> 12:08.320]  he's optimistic thinking that it's going to come back because after all the South
[12:08.320 --> 12:12.360]  Sea company has a monopoly on all trade to South American that's the way these
[12:12.360 --> 12:16.840]  bubbles always start out and then he exits at the bottom without any money
[12:16.840 --> 12:22.080]  totally broke so it remains to be seen Bitcoin just like the South Sea bubble
[12:22.080 --> 12:26.440]  has a lot of real value to it these cryptocurrencies do but it's not just
[12:26.440 --> 12:30.000]  Bitcoin that's going up one of the signs that it's a bubble is the fact that all
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.640]  these other cryptocurrencies are also going up exponentially at the same time
[12:34.640 --> 12:38.560]  that's a sure sign according to this Forbes article that we are in a bubble
[12:38.560 --> 12:43.040]  but it brings up the real question is how do you evaluate real value how do
[12:43.040 --> 12:47.440]  you evaluate real value when you're shopping on Black Friday and as many
[12:47.440 --> 12:51.760]  studies have pointed out they're making more money obviously in the fourth
[12:51.760 --> 12:55.720]  quarter because they're selling more but their profit margins are higher their
[12:55.720 --> 13:01.120]  profit margins are 22% higher in this quarter and they're making more money
[13:01.120 --> 13:05.560]  prices are higher for many items on Black Friday than they are even in the
[13:05.560 --> 13:10.360]  rest of this quarter and the rest of the holiday season so by pulling in and
[13:10.360 --> 13:14.200]  doing what the crowd is doing that's really what that popular delusions and
[13:14.200 --> 13:18.040]  madness of crowds is all about you get suckered into that just like you kind
[13:18.040 --> 13:20.920]  of got a lot of people got suckered in not our listeners probably a lot of
[13:20.920 --> 13:25.600]  people got suckered into Obamacare you know it's we see that its prices are
[13:25.600 --> 13:30.440]  going up exponentially the differences though is that it's not really your
[13:30.440 --> 13:34.160]  choice you're being put in there so it's kind of like popular socialism and
[13:34.160 --> 13:38.440]  the delusion of dictators is what we've got going on with Obamacare but
[13:38.440 --> 13:43.960]  people are buying into this Black Friday madness and Paul Joseph Watson has
[13:43.960 --> 13:47.920]  done a really funny video that's up on info wars dot com I believe it's red
[13:47.920 --> 13:53.600]  linked at the top or near the top and it compares zombie movies to what we see
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.360]  happening in Walmart let's take a look at that and I'll narrate it for people
[13:57.360 --> 14:02.960]  who are listening on the radio says actual footage of zombie plagues sweeping
[14:02.960 --> 14:07.200]  America right now this is Walmart
[14:07.560 --> 14:14.400]  giant crowd fighting over boxes of consumer goods from China now he's
[14:14.400 --> 14:19.880]  coming to a he's coming to a video movie where people are standing outside
[14:19.880 --> 14:27.880]  feeling the glass trying to get in or back inside Walmart absolute chaos or
[14:27.880 --> 14:34.040]  are you in that I hope not the difference is the zombies are less
[14:34.040 --> 14:43.160]  aggressive I think when we compare these back and forth I think the zombies look
[14:43.160 --> 14:50.600]  definitely less dangerous than the Walmart shoppers certainly much quieter
[14:50.600 --> 14:57.240]  don't shatter as much there the people crashing the lines running across as
[14:57.240 --> 15:04.560]  they're opening the store doors totally out of control a wall-to-wall sea of
[15:04.560 --> 15:11.160]  people and now we're back at the zombie movie you can always tell when we go
[15:11.160 --> 15:13.240]  back to the zombie movie if you're not watching this because it gets real
[15:13.240 --> 15:19.000]  quiet the people screaming are the ones in Walmart yeah this is a guy punching
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.080]  someone in the stomach for a little box of I guess it's a TV I don't know what
[15:23.080 --> 15:28.280]  it is and in that particular case the guy filming it was ejected by security
[15:28.280 --> 15:31.600]  but they didn't do anything to the guy who was punching people and here the
[15:31.600 --> 15:38.360]  cops wrestling somebody to the ground at another Walmart absolute insanity he
[15:38.360 --> 15:43.640]  says if Americans behave like this over electronic slave goods and I guess what
[15:43.640 --> 15:47.080]  he's gonna have what do you think he's gonna put up next what's gonna happen
[15:47.080 --> 15:51.560]  when everything collapses imagine how they will react when food runs out yeah I
[15:51.560 --> 15:56.480]  think they're kind of gonna go from knockout game to cannibalism in about
[15:56.480 --> 16:01.600]  24 hours don't you it's very frightening we're gonna be talking to Alex
[16:01.600 --> 16:04.480]  about that at the bottom of the hour we're gonna be taking your calls in the
[16:04.480 --> 16:09.000]  next hour with Anthony Gutiarty and we've also got Mark dice to talk to us
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  about the video that he did it's a it's a funny parody video where he's bullhorning
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  people saying what are you doing out here don't you realize that you're
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.680]  getting ripped off and you realize that you're buying stuff from China that
[16:18.680 --> 16:23.480]  you're going to debt for this but we're not doing this necessarily just to make
[16:23.480 --> 16:26.920]  fun of people we want you to understand to be an intelligent consumer we're
[16:26.920 --> 16:30.960]  trying to help people that's what we do here we're trying to show you trends not
[16:30.960 --> 16:34.320]  to make fun of people not to pick fights with people we're trying to help you to
[16:34.320 --> 16:38.480]  understand what's going on it's just like people complaining that we're maybe
[16:38.480 --> 16:41.720]  too negative because we're showing the bad things that the government is doing
[16:41.720 --> 16:46.680]  but you need to see the gathering storm crowds you know I think that it's makes
[16:46.680 --> 16:51.560]  you more grateful more thankful for what you've got now if you really understand
[16:51.560 --> 16:56.320]  the potential dangers and what's gathering in the future certainly does in
[16:56.320 --> 16:59.440]  our family we see what's happening we're trying to make some preparations
[16:59.440 --> 17:03.000]  hopefully you're making some preparations as well but you need to
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.240]  understand the trends and you need to understand how crowds react when you
[17:07.240 --> 17:11.580]  look at things like Bitcoin for example this is something that the the
[17:11.580 --> 17:16.280]  astronomical rise of Bitcoin and just the last week to ten days it's got a
[17:16.280 --> 17:21.840]  very small market cap we've seen cases where gold has shot up and then been
[17:21.840 --> 17:25.600]  pumped and dumped and there's been a lot of belief that that's being done by
[17:25.600 --> 17:31.800]  large investors perhaps central banks and we know that George Soros has made a
[17:31.800 --> 17:36.880]  lot of money doing that to currencies to the Bank of England so he out pumped
[17:36.880 --> 17:41.400]  and dumped the Bank of England and made billions of dollars so an individual
[17:41.400 --> 17:45.560]  like George Soros could do that to Bitcoin because its market cap is so
[17:45.560 --> 17:50.040]  small and that's a real danger these other currencies these other crypto
[17:50.040 --> 17:54.000]  currencies even though they're great ideas and we hope that they succeed you
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.320]  need to be very very cautious about it especially don't do something like Isaac
[17:59.320 --> 18:03.440]  Newton did which is buying in as the thing is going up exponentially that's
[18:03.440 --> 18:07.760]  how one of the smartest men that ever lived went bankrupt so we we don't want
[18:07.760 --> 18:11.760]  to see that happen but I want to go back real quickly to news that was
[18:11.760 --> 18:16.300]  breaking earlier as a follow-up story I mentioned in the news segment just the
[18:16.300 --> 18:21.720]  first five minutes about this drunk driving breathalyzer test that were
[18:21.720 --> 18:25.840]  being conducted on people in Fort Worth they were telling people that it was
[18:25.840 --> 18:29.640]  voluntary but the minute you turn up they're analyzing your breath and their
[18:29.640 --> 18:33.160]  reason for doing it is because the National Highway Traffic Safety
[18:33.160 --> 18:37.840]  Administration wants to use it as a justification to lower the definition of
[18:37.840 --> 18:42.480]  drunk driving we saw the same thing happen with the EPA they did exactly the
[18:42.480 --> 18:47.320]  same thing in North Carolina they hooked people up volunteers that they in
[18:47.320 --> 18:50.040]  this case paid they weren't paying people in Fort Worth they hooked up
[18:50.040 --> 18:55.360]  volunteers to diesel engines and had them breathing the exhaust because they
[18:55.360 --> 18:59.860]  wanted to get these people sick so that they could argue to increase the
[18:59.860 --> 19:04.160]  regulations on particulate matter so the government does this type of thing all
[19:04.160 --> 19:07.680]  the time but here's a case out of California where the California Supreme
[19:07.680 --> 19:13.680]  Court actually outlaws science and a driving under influence case this guy
[19:13.680 --> 19:18.520]  was driving 125 miles an hour on the highway in San Diego the cops pulls up
[19:18.520 --> 19:23.040]  behind him flips on the light he immediately pulls over he passes all of
[19:23.040 --> 19:26.680]  the sobriety test but they want to run a breathalyzer test on him because he
[19:26.680 --> 19:32.520]  admitted that he had a drink he got he blew a 086 which is right over the
[19:32.520 --> 19:38.000]  legal limit and he wanted a blood test but they wouldn't give it to him so what
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.560]  they did was he took it to court and he had an expert doctor say that the
[19:41.560 --> 19:46.480]  breath tests don't really accurately measure your alcohol content or whether
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.320]  you're intoxicated and the court just threw it out they said we don't care the
[19:50.320 --> 19:54.200]  legislator gave us a definition of drunk driving we're gonna go with that we
[19:54.200 --> 19:57.360]  don't care what the reality is stay tuned we're gonna be right back with

[24:14.080 --> 24:18.560]  segment today we're talking about Black Friday and you probably may even be out
[24:18.560 --> 24:23.560]  there in that Georgiaport.com has that totally covered he's got Maul Mayhem
[24:23.560 --> 24:27.280]  suspected shot flipper shot after dragging a cop through the Coles
[24:27.280 --> 24:32.760]  parking lot we got brawls we got Walmart giving people arm bands to try to keep
[24:32.760 --> 24:37.520]  everything down and we've got Santa with a megaphone who is telling
[24:37.520 --> 24:41.720]  Thanksgiving parasite shoppers to think about what they're doing that's Mark
[24:41.720 --> 24:45.760]  Dice's video we've got that on info wars.com and we're going to be talking
[24:45.760 --> 24:49.920]  to Mark Dice in the next hour and we're going to be playing his video and
[24:49.920 --> 24:53.880]  looking at that with Alex Jones in the next segment I went out yesterday on
[24:53.880 --> 24:59.920]  Thanksgiving and we looked at what was happening Best Buys had a Thanksgiving
[24:59.920 --> 25:03.400]  opening for the first time they've never done that before they've always open
[25:03.400 --> 25:06.760]  just on Black Friday and that's what happens they're getting people are
[25:06.760 --> 25:09.600]  getting more and more aggressive so they're pushing back they're making
[25:09.600 --> 25:14.680]  their employees come in and work on Thanksgiving and it's just kind of a sad
[25:14.680 --> 25:18.960]  thing to see this devolve from a time of reflection where you can get together
[25:18.960 --> 25:22.320]  with your family where you can think about the future you can reflect on the
[25:22.320 --> 25:27.360]  past you can be grateful for what you've got into a situation where people are
[25:27.360 --> 25:31.080]  just knocking each other down and the Walmart's trying to grab the latest
[25:31.080 --> 25:35.200]  special whether or not it's even a good deal and of course we have articles that
[25:35.200 --> 25:39.240]  show that it's not a good deal on average sometimes it is a good deal
[25:39.240 --> 25:42.760]  sometimes they give you a really good deal to get you in the door their door
[25:42.760 --> 25:45.680]  busters and once you get in there they know that you're going to shop around
[25:45.680 --> 25:49.320]  you're going to look at other stuff in there and you're going to buy on impulse
[25:49.320 --> 25:53.580]  that's when they get you the price trends that Wall Street Journal has looked at
[25:53.580 --> 25:57.800]  show that certainly in this quarter their profit margins not just their sales
[25:57.800 --> 26:02.360]  their profit margins are much much higher and that's even true on Black
[26:02.360 --> 26:05.760]  Friday you can find cheaper prices even in the Christmas season not to mention
[26:05.760 --> 26:09.120]  getting stuff out of the Christmas season this is what we found last night I
[26:09.120 --> 26:12.560]  went out and looked at a couple of stores with Rob Jacobson we talked to
[26:12.560 --> 26:16.640]  shoppers had been waiting a long time we even talked to the manager the best buy
[26:16.640 --> 26:20.440]  who is having all their employees work for the first time on a Thanksgiving this
[26:20.440 --> 26:25.200]  is what we found in front of Best Buy on Black Thursday which used to be called
[26:25.200 --> 26:29.040]  Thanksgiving retailers like Best Buy are trying to get a jump on the
[26:29.040 --> 26:33.680]  competition by opening on Thanksgiving Day David Knight thanks for coming out
[26:33.680 --> 26:38.040]  talking to us just curious because Black Friday is no longer Black Friday it's
[26:38.040 --> 26:41.360]  now Black Thursday how do you feel about that I feel great about it I'm actually
[26:41.360 --> 26:44.240]  think that it gives us more of an opportunity to be awake being
[26:44.240 --> 26:48.080]  vigorated we definitely appreciate what we're coming out on this special day they
[26:48.080 --> 26:52.640]  can spend it with us get in get out go home eat your leftovers is this the
[26:52.640 --> 26:55.280]  first year you've opened up on Thanksgiving or is this something you've
[26:55.280 --> 26:59.200]  done in previous years this is the very first year we're doing the 6 p.m. open of
[26:59.200 --> 27:04.360]  course much more sold this time of year but profit margins are 22% higher this
[27:04.360 --> 27:08.000]  quarter than in the rest of the year in other words you're paying more to buy
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.360]  just before Christmas and the biggest day of this quarter is Black Friday so
[27:12.360 --> 27:15.800]  named because the profits made these couple of days often are the deciding
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.160]  factor in a profitable quarter or even a profitable year but people are still
[27:20.160 --> 27:23.680]  convinced they're getting a deal guys you how long you've been here I've been
[27:23.680 --> 27:29.120]  here since midnight the 3d TV that I'm getting overall it's gonna be like 600
[27:29.120 --> 27:34.360]  dollars in savings tonight I've been here since 7 a.m. 8 in the morning for
[27:34.360 --> 27:40.440]  laptop I'm looking for a TV 39 inch flat screen for $169.99 that TV may be
[27:40.440 --> 27:44.360]  cheaper than it was last week but if they could wait until after Christmas
[27:44.360 --> 27:49.160]  would it be even cheaper and even if it's a steal will they buy other things on
[27:49.160 --> 27:53.160]  impulse while in the store that aren't such good deals so you think you're
[27:53.160 --> 27:56.560]  going to be susceptible to just kind of impulse buying what you get in there if
[27:56.560 --> 28:00.680]  you're not really sure it's here I'm not sure oh yeah most definitely it's
[28:00.680 --> 28:07.080]  always just like the same exact yeah for sure but the shoppers are convinced
[28:07.080 --> 28:10.680]  they're getting a deal and the retailers are really pumped
[28:10.680 --> 28:31.960]  you feel good about the economy it's living maybe looking a little bit better
[28:31.960 --> 28:38.040]  but yeah another impulse buy that you can't afford just like Obamacare but
[28:38.040 --> 28:41.080]  unlike Obamacare you can return it if it doesn't work
[28:41.080 --> 28:48.320]  for wars nightly news I'm David Knight well you know when we look at what's
[28:48.320 --> 28:52.240]  going on on Black Friday we look at people as the drudge report has you've
[28:52.240 --> 28:56.240]  got a guy shot walking home with a big screen television got salvation army
[28:56.240 --> 28:59.800]  kettles that are stolen we look at what's going on with the knockout games
[28:59.800 --> 29:04.320]  and large cities and even in some cities that aren't so large it's a very
[29:04.320 --> 29:10.480]  troubling picture of what can happen if society breaks down or if we have war we
[29:10.480 --> 29:14.680]  have Chinese jets that are flying in disputed air defense zones if you look
[29:14.680 --> 29:19.560]  at this map take a quick look at this map here on the we've got Taiwan as well
[29:19.560 --> 29:27.600]  as Japan as well as China all asserting hegemony over a certain area what it
[29:27.600 --> 29:32.360]  looks like is a Venn diagram you've got all these different countries saying we
[29:32.360 --> 29:35.920]  own this the same area the same little islands when you look at them
[29:35.920 --> 29:40.720]  early there's nothing at all on these islands that's a real powder keg that
[29:40.720 --> 29:44.240]  could possibly happen there and of course these are the people that sell us
[29:44.240 --> 29:49.520]  everything that we have so maybe they'll loan us the money to build our defense
[29:49.520 --> 29:58.400]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.400 --> 30:04.000]  my friends Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important

[33:32.320 --> 33:36.200]  joining us in the studio right now and if you're watching this intro you're
[33:36.200 --> 33:40.880]  seeing excerpts from Paul Joseph Watson's video comparing shoppers at
[33:40.880 --> 33:44.280]  Walmart the violence that's going on there with the zombies and actually I
[33:44.280 --> 33:47.920]  think the the zombies don't look nearly as dangerous as the Walmart shoppers do
[33:47.920 --> 33:51.920]  the Alex you're right David and again I appreciate you doing the show Tuesday

[34:01.600 --> 34:06.120]  to the broadcast but I personally enjoy listening to you David I know a lot of
[34:06.120 --> 34:10.040]  other people do out there across the country and that's been my goal is to
[34:10.040 --> 34:13.920]  take the reporters that we put on the nightly news and develop them so that
[34:13.920 --> 34:17.200]  they can co-host the show and in the future start other radio shows and
[34:17.200 --> 34:22.440]  basically end up pretty much 24 hours a day down the road having live
[34:22.440 --> 34:27.120]  transmissions here at the info wars dot com center and we're finally getting
[34:27.120 --> 34:30.960]  close to the point of being able to start launching more of the shows a lot
[34:30.960 --> 34:34.560]  of exciting things coming in the new year we're really cracking the whip in a
[34:34.560 --> 34:40.040]  good way I'm cracking the whip on myself to really up my game go to the next
[34:40.040 --> 34:45.520]  level and really try to counter the zombification of the public and not just
[34:45.520 --> 34:51.240]  here in the US but worldwide because we have a real shot right now at awakening
[34:51.240 --> 34:56.200]  humanity and taking action now I wanted to explain to listeners why we are
[34:56.200 --> 35:01.200]  critical of black Friday black Thursday soon will be black Wednesday then it'll
[35:01.200 --> 35:06.000]  be black week or whatever you'll get in the black for businesses the reason we're
[35:06.000 --> 35:12.600]  critical is multi-pronged a I am all for a merchant class I am all for commerce
[35:12.600 --> 35:20.000]  I am all for free market I am all for sales and and and shopping and and all
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.640]  of that because we have a large population and in a marketplace that's
[35:23.640 --> 35:28.200]  what brings diversity and competition but we don't really have a free market
[35:28.200 --> 35:32.280]  system to a great extent now and it's the big box stores with the Chinese slave
[35:32.280 --> 35:37.440]  goods that have created the last decade this phenomenon of black Friday that is
[35:37.440 --> 35:44.000]  a front and then the activity you see by the welfare class it doesn't matter
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  they're black white or Hispanic or Asian they all look and act just the same
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.080]  just different skin color punching each other attacking for things they think
[35:51.080 --> 35:54.120]  are good deals when even the New York Times and Wall Street Journal and
[35:54.120 --> 35:58.320]  Associated Press and Paul Watson as an article on that at info wars.com right
[35:58.320 --> 36:05.520]  now on record admit it's probably about the tenth worst time of the year to shop
[36:05.520 --> 36:11.280]  the best time is obviously right after Christmas or in the new year and most
[36:11.280 --> 36:15.080]  these people because they've done the demographic breakdowns are on welfare or
[36:15.080 --> 36:19.440]  they're deeply in debt with credit cards they've got student loans we have the
[36:19.440 --> 36:25.000]  greatest debt any country's ever seen public private corporate churches are
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.120]  in debt you name it so you shouldn't see this type of activity just
[36:29.120 --> 36:35.160]  ravenously the self-propelled obese people eating GMO all day their kids
[36:35.160 --> 36:39.200]  probably shop every vaccine there are watching 10 12 hours of TV and video
[36:39.200 --> 36:43.600]  games a day literally don't know where their state capital is point their
[36:43.600 --> 36:47.520]  finger at us who are politically involved and say we're bad they don't know
[36:47.520 --> 36:52.920]  about Foxconn and Apple and the suicide nets and none of us are perfect as we
[36:52.920 --> 36:56.720]  are a consumerist society and there's nothing wrong with consuming unless it's
[36:56.720 --> 37:01.160]  the top of the pyramid for you on your hierarchy of needs is it the golden calf
[37:01.160 --> 37:05.280]  the golden calf should be God should be being honorable should be your family
[37:05.280 --> 37:11.760]  should be self-sufficient and at the bottom of it of your pyramid should be
[37:11.760 --> 37:16.120]  daily sustenance your needs that's the first thing you need and then you move
[37:16.120 --> 37:22.320]  up into family and culture and wanting to help others that should be right up at
[37:22.320 --> 37:26.120]  the top of your pyramid in a healthy society in a collapsing decadence
[37:26.120 --> 37:33.200]  society you see people what I call the lottery mentality or what I call the
[37:33.200 --> 37:37.480]  Obamacare mentality it doesn't matter the lottery is the worst investment you
[37:37.480 --> 37:41.280]  can make bar none except for maybe cigarettes or alcohol things that hurt
[37:41.280 --> 37:46.320]  you it doesn't matter if Obamacare you could read the legislation written as a
[37:46.320 --> 37:52.400]  fantastical private corporate tax dream to double triple quadruple prices shut
[37:52.400 --> 37:58.520]  down their competition force you to buy it written by offshore megabanks doesn't
[37:58.520 --> 38:01.680]  matter if we came up and told people it's a screw job they said look man I
[38:01.680 --> 38:04.840]  want my free deal I don't care if it's going to take money from the middle
[38:04.840 --> 38:09.000]  class I don't care if it shuts the economy down I want my free deal now
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.160]  they're finding out it's not a free deal but instead of admitting they were
[38:12.160 --> 38:18.680]  kind they're saying they want even more okay Obama become a dictator
[38:18.680 --> 38:23.280]  dictatorially fix it and we predicted this would happen because we know how
[38:23.280 --> 38:27.440]  it works you stick your hand in the wood shipper and the answer is don't pull
[38:27.440 --> 38:31.080]  it out stick it in deeper there's a loud speaker saying climb into the wood
[38:31.080 --> 38:34.880]  shipper stick your head in it if you like your arm being torn off and shredded
[38:34.880 --> 38:38.720]  stick your whole body and throw your kids in that's what I like in it too
[38:38.720 --> 38:47.560]  because in this kind of welfare class idea they believe if the mainstream
[38:47.560 --> 38:50.920]  media is telling them who are all financed by these big box stores and
[38:50.920 --> 38:56.120]  others get in there black friday is the best time to have a sale they actually
[38:56.120 --> 39:00.200]  believe that they're going and you went out and talk to mark dice is going out
[39:00.200 --> 39:03.960]  and talk to him mark dice is coming up bottom of the next hour his stories on
[39:03.960 --> 39:06.640]  drudgereport.com top story in the left-hand side people should go watch
[39:06.640 --> 39:11.920]  that video because when you look at it you can talk to these people he did
[39:11.920 --> 39:16.160]  last year he did the year before you talk to them they don't believe that it's
[39:16.160 --> 39:19.680]  one of the worst times to shop that they that they raised the price three
[39:19.680 --> 39:23.840]  weeks ago and then on this day lower it back to what it was previous to three
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.120]  weeks ago they don't tell you after Christmas after New Year's is the best
[39:27.120 --> 39:29.720]  time they don't tell you sometimes the middle of the summer is the best time
[39:29.720 --> 39:34.000]  they don't actually go do market research if they wanted to save money they
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.240]  go in on average and that's profit margins up 20% on the products they're
[39:39.240 --> 39:43.520]  selling I haven't seen the numbers on total profit margin that vary so so this
[39:43.520 --> 39:48.480]  is a screw job right this is hype this is fraud and you go tell them hey lottery
[39:48.480 --> 39:52.040]  tickets are not a good investment hey going to Vegas is not a good investment
[39:52.040 --> 39:54.960]  if you're rich you want to go to Vegas knock yourself out but if you're poor
[39:54.960 --> 39:58.880]  don't mortgage the house don't don't don't don't have the kids not have food
[39:58.880 --> 40:03.000]  to eat because you think you're gonna go to Vegas or Atlantic City so some mob
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.840]  bosses can you know fleece you it's rigged and that's the point is that the
[40:07.840 --> 40:12.240]  Pope's coming out saying free market capitalism is bad no it's not this is
[40:12.240 --> 40:17.480]  monopoly capitalism run by globalists that set the rules it isn't free trade
[40:17.480 --> 40:24.360]  it's it's slave trade it isn't capitalism it's insider crony capitalism
[40:24.360 --> 40:29.520]  monopoly capitalism and so the people perish for lack of knowledge and and
[40:29.520 --> 40:32.680]  this is a manifestation I have some points I want to run through but you've
[40:32.680 --> 40:37.600]  got some points you were telling me off air it's like Bitcoin people said Alex
[40:37.600 --> 40:40.200]  you knew about Bitcoin when it started four years ago you could have made a
[40:40.200 --> 40:43.840]  hundred million dollars and I said yes I could have hyped it I could have pushed
[40:43.840 --> 40:47.400]  it I could have gotten out of it I told people get out of it months ago on air
[40:47.400 --> 40:52.480]  now it's plunged they will now be mad at me for saying it's a scam it's the same
[40:52.480 --> 40:57.480]  thing I could have had a black Friday sale for our naysan iodine and our
[40:57.480 --> 41:03.520]  American Patriot blend super high quality Mexican coffee but see I have sales
[41:03.520 --> 41:07.960]  all the time I have lower prices all the time that's real capitalism real
[41:07.960 --> 41:13.320]  competition where quality is why you're successful not because you've got
[41:13.320 --> 41:18.080]  mind control over the population so it's good to innovate and sell good
[41:18.080 --> 41:22.800]  products but we're not going to have a black Friday sale and then piggy back
[41:22.800 --> 41:28.480]  on in fact I even almost have told my crew let's not have it be 29 95 let's
[41:28.480 --> 41:33.920]  have it just be 30 because people literally buy more if you say 29 95 I
[41:33.920 --> 41:37.800]  mean and I go along with some of it because it funds our operation against
[41:37.800 --> 41:42.440]  the word out I got rid of almost all advertising I have one contractually I
[41:42.440 --> 41:45.440]  have some of those block ads you see I can't get out up for a couple months but
[41:45.440 --> 41:50.040]  then I'm probably not gonna have any of it until I slowly vet each sponsor I have
[41:50.040 --> 41:52.800]  to deal with network ads I don't agree with I've told them and they're great
[41:52.800 --> 41:56.600]  guys I said listen if I say I don't learn that on my show he gets taken off or I
[41:56.600 --> 42:01.600]  leave because because it's a real struggle to try to be at the highest
[42:01.600 --> 42:06.720]  level of integrity so so so I'm not here on some high horse with people we all
[42:06.720 --> 42:10.480]  make compromises but are we moving towards better quality being more
[42:10.480 --> 42:14.680]  honorable or are we moving towards lower quality being less honorable I am
[42:14.680 --> 42:19.960]  working harder being healthier not drinking any not using any tobacco
[42:19.960 --> 42:24.720]  products not eating sugar processed sugar I am literally I'm gonna pray for
[42:24.720 --> 42:28.720]  me folks because I'm committed in my responsibility I was telling this this
[42:28.720 --> 42:32.160]  morning on the phone and I've challenged the entire office to do the same that
[42:32.160 --> 42:35.040]  of course you you don't drink smoke or anything and eat healthy so there's not
[42:35.040 --> 42:38.520]  much to challenge you're trying to give up you know soda pop or whatever but the
[42:38.520 --> 42:41.960]  point is you're you know you're one coke a day and which I don't blame you cook
[42:41.960 --> 42:46.320]  cola tastes great I love it myself all I know is we're in a historical
[42:46.320 --> 42:50.520]  crossroads so we've all got to commit and talk about the spirit of this nation
[42:50.520 --> 42:55.840]  and it all starts inside us it's an inside job just like it always is as the
[42:55.840 --> 42:59.120]  song says but but make your point and I've got a laundry list I think it's
[42:59.120 --> 43:03.480]  really you're talking about the spirit of the society when you look at things
[43:03.480 --> 43:07.080]  like the knockout game when you look at people fighting over trivial things at
[43:07.080 --> 43:11.160]  Walmart it's very frightening to realize that we have a very fragile
[43:11.160 --> 43:15.120]  infrastructure here we've got China pushing in different territory that's the
[43:15.120 --> 43:19.840]  big issue or so there's so many things that could happen it and if things get
[43:19.840 --> 43:24.600]  difficult if we have a breakdown in the infrastructure because now you're talking
[43:24.600 --> 43:29.280]  about big box retailers we have big box food suppliers so that they just in time
[43:29.280 --> 43:33.040]  delivery in time if that breaks down if we if they can't get the trucks there
[43:33.040 --> 43:37.760]  they don't have a lot of backup for the city so what's going to happen to these
[43:37.760 --> 43:42.400]  people who are just knocking people out for the fun of it who are getting into
[43:42.400 --> 43:45.560]  fights because they want some kind of consumer item what's going to happen when
[43:45.560 --> 43:50.000]  they have a real need when that's what our M4 car beams are for that's right
[43:50.000 --> 43:55.440]  and and and folks ask why why we're so into preparedness people ask why I've
[43:55.440 --> 43:59.200]  moved to the country people asked because if you mathematically and all the
[43:59.200 --> 44:04.360]  major economists are on record whether it's Peter Schiff or Mark Faber or Jim
[44:04.360 --> 44:08.080]  Rogers it doesn't matter but but but even the British Defense Ministry report
[44:08.080 --> 44:14.960]  2007 even the Pentagon report two years ago admits this is unsustainable it will
[44:14.960 --> 44:19.680]  collapse the question is how bad will it collapse and because they've engineered
[44:19.680 --> 44:25.540]  it to collapse the globalists plan to be the last group standing when it all
[44:25.540 --> 44:31.600]  happens and that's why we're so freaked out that's why we're so concerned a lot
[44:31.600 --> 44:35.400]  of what's behind Bitcoin too because when you look at Bitcoin a lot of what's
[44:35.400 --> 44:40.480]  driving that is people's concern about the dollar and the the poor management
[44:40.480 --> 44:44.280]  the manipulation by the Federal Reserve so there's a lot of people who have a
[44:44.280 --> 44:48.200]  real concern about that they also want to have something that is private that's
[44:48.200 --> 44:50.920]  out of the control of the federal government that they can move out so
[44:50.920 --> 44:54.360]  there's a real reason to have a cryptocurrency just like with the South
[44:54.360 --> 44:57.400]  Sea bubble there was a real reason for people to invest in a company that had
[44:57.400 --> 45:01.600]  a monopoly for all trade exactly but but just like some of this bubble thing
[45:01.600 --> 45:04.600]  because of a crowd everybody starts to buy into it because that's what
[45:04.600 --> 45:07.840]  everybody else is doing so well notice it's the first one put out very
[45:07.840 --> 45:11.680]  shadowy I believe in crypto totally independent currencies it is the way of
[45:11.680 --> 45:16.240]  the future it is the answer to the system the problem is if you look at past
[45:16.240 --> 45:20.320]  bubble currencies past private currencies they always go through this boom
[45:20.320 --> 45:25.440]  bust cycle and so I didn't want to be there holding the bag handing out
[45:25.440 --> 45:30.680]  basically the Kool-Aid to my listeners as if this was a panacea I wanted to not
[45:30.680 --> 45:34.240]  have a rational exuberance and point out where I believed it was going and
[45:34.240 --> 45:38.080]  where it is undoubtedly going and then they're gonna use this destruction of
[45:38.080 --> 45:42.080]  Bitcoin down the road I believe to then discredit people that promoted it
[45:42.080 --> 45:45.640]  discredit the idea of an independent outside cryptocurrency and then bring
[45:45.640 --> 45:51.440]  in a globalist SDR model and I believe at a gut level fundamentally day one
[45:51.440 --> 45:54.920]  four years ago when it showed up that this is a globalist manufactured time
[45:54.920 --> 45:58.920]  bomb Trojan horse but the way the mainstream media promoted it up front
[45:58.920 --> 46:02.280]  the way they weren't negative about it up front and then now they've just phased
[46:02.280 --> 46:07.200]  in the negativeness if they didn't create it there they're planning to use it I
[46:07.200 --> 46:11.560]  find it very interesting that at the same time it took off they also had all
[46:11.560 --> 46:16.560]  of these Washington hearings where they had virtually they had about eight or
[46:16.560 --> 46:19.860]  ten different agencies in the federal government you had the IRS you had the
[46:19.860 --> 46:24.120]  SEC had FinCEN you know looking at foreign transfers you had the FBI you
[46:24.120 --> 46:27.680]  had Homeland Security and they're all coming in and they're saying well it's
[46:27.680 --> 46:32.040]  right after they took down a major drug site but they're saying we don't really
[46:32.040 --> 46:35.080]  want to push this too hard because we want the free market to work they start
[46:35.080 --> 46:37.800]  sounding like they're libertarian free market advocates since it's like
[46:37.800 --> 46:41.020]  there's something wrong with this what they were doing was wanting people
[46:41.020 --> 46:44.440]  at the same time as being pumped up and then now they're using it to pass laws
[46:44.440 --> 46:47.720]  to basically ban any type of this currency now let's stop there because I
[46:47.720 --> 46:51.000]  want to give people the real reason I came in to break all this up and I'll
[46:51.000 --> 46:54.760]  be here till five after than Anthony Gucci already's coming in let's go over
[46:54.760 --> 46:59.640]  the big issue that you just brought up if you go watch Paul Watson's video on
[46:59.640 --> 47:04.120]  info wars.com about the zombie plague sweeping America these are people that
[47:04.120 --> 47:08.680]  literally believe that a handout of free government a handout of free health care
[47:08.680 --> 47:13.320]  or a magic golden lottery ticket is going to set their course not starting a
[47:13.320 --> 47:19.320]  business not being honorable not inventing something new not working
[47:19.320 --> 47:24.000]  hard which builds a good civilization but running scams getting it getting on
[47:24.000 --> 47:29.160]  the backs of bubbles this is a get rich you know type scenario the only time you
[47:29.160 --> 47:32.880]  should see lines of people fighting is in the old west when the feds were
[47:32.880 --> 47:38.720]  taking public property and giving it away for five cents a acre or three cents
[47:38.720 --> 47:42.960]  an acre or the Mexican land run or the Spanish land run when people ran down
[47:42.960 --> 47:46.280]  here from the U.S. because the Mexican government was giving it away for three
[47:46.280 --> 47:51.320]  cents an acre like my ancestors paid three cents an acre in east Texas for
[47:51.320 --> 47:57.560]  tens of thousands of acres that's better than Bitcoin because then it's not
[47:57.560 --> 48:00.480]  some Chinese slave goods that break in two days or before you go out of the
[48:00.480 --> 48:04.120]  box that were made at a factory with forced abortions and suicide nets then
[48:04.120 --> 48:08.000]  you could actually cut the trees you could put cattle on it you could raise
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  crops you could have kids you could live and get away from bringing a share
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.600]  cropper in Alabama because you had basically white slaves is what they
[48:15.600 --> 48:18.640]  were these weren't called slaves because that was illegal but they want to turn
[48:18.640 --> 48:22.520]  us all into sharecroppers again that's the plan that's the plan is the
[48:22.520 --> 48:25.880]  globalist are offshore and they've created this mindset someone explain to
[48:25.880 --> 48:30.280]  people what's happening here when you see these riots and people punching each
[48:30.280 --> 48:34.320]  other in the stomach over bags of dog food or Xboxes and they're not even
[48:34.320 --> 48:36.800]  really getting the best deal they're getting a terrible deal they could have
[48:36.800 --> 48:40.280]  got a better deal online or it's a loss leader where they sell 10 at one price
[48:40.280 --> 48:45.000]  then change the sign it's scam on top of scam when you can't reach them realize
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.920]  that we've got 50 million people on food stamps 101 million on food assistance
[48:49.920 --> 48:53.680]  that number's only growing the baby boomers starting to retire this year
[48:53.680 --> 48:57.760]  2013 they started this year it accelerates the next five years you'll
[48:57.760 --> 49:02.040]  have more people retired than in the working class illegals coming in who
[49:02.040 --> 49:04.800]  are getting all the free welfare and stuff because the government set it up
[49:04.800 --> 49:09.120]  that way it is a recipe for destruction and so what's gonna happen is when
[49:09.120 --> 49:13.280]  things start to collapse they'll roll out the riot police the military to quell
[49:13.280 --> 49:17.560]  things and we'll be like yeah we needed that when the globalists created the
[49:17.560 --> 49:21.480]  atmosphere where that would be needed to begin with then they will have the
[49:21.480 --> 49:27.080]  giant mass after the waves of riots that are coming in the next decade the waves
[49:27.080 --> 49:30.120]  of collapse just like we've already seen in Europe a few years ahead of us about
[49:30.120 --> 49:33.560]  four years ahead of us they will use that their homeland securities geared up
[49:33.560 --> 49:37.240]  for that the social engineering to bring in the high-tech system of control
[49:37.240 --> 49:41.840]  they will then have the illegals and the giant mass of working poor who will now
[49:41.840 --> 49:45.080]  be supplemented with welfare even at their working job that'll be the new
[49:45.080 --> 49:48.600]  model you work for the government or a select corporation then you also get a
[49:48.600 --> 49:52.920]  stipend digitally on your national ID card that's tied to welfare this is all
[49:52.920 --> 49:57.360]  part of the official plan DHS will approve you getting a job under TSA this
[49:57.360 --> 50:02.840]  is all official so they're going to have the mass of these people and the
[50:02.840 --> 50:08.280]  bureaucratic class vote to raise taxes just like France 70 80 90 percent on the
[50:08.280 --> 50:13.600]  middle class ultra rich offshore above the law to then leverage out the middle
[50:13.600 --> 50:19.480]  class leverage us out and and basically destroy us transferring our wealth to the
[50:19.480 --> 50:23.640]  poor which won't even fund them for more than a few years it's not designed to do
[50:23.640 --> 50:26.920]  that it's designed to get rid of the political middle class that's always the
[50:26.920 --> 50:30.600]  strategic enemy of the offshore ultra elite who are above the law and have
[50:30.600 --> 50:34.800]  basically diplomatic immunity throughout history it that's why Homeland
[50:34.800 --> 50:39.880]  Security will be targeted at the Tea Party libertarian working middle class
[50:39.880 --> 50:44.280]  because we're the only challenge once we're extincted they're gonna cut all
[50:44.280 --> 50:48.520]  the welfare off put the poor people in forced labor camps that's the official
[50:48.520 --> 50:52.520]  plan that's the globalist takeover program we'll be right back with key
[50:52.520 --> 50:56.720]  intel on Black Friday and what it means to our civilization with David not a

[51:14.240 --> 51:18.880]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing

[54:12.360 --> 54:16.360]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight hosting today this Friday
[54:16.360 --> 54:20.680]  after Thanksgiving Black Friday and we've got Alex Jones here in the studio
[54:20.680 --> 54:25.120]  analyzing what this really tells us about what's going on in society and the
[54:25.120 --> 54:28.600]  impending breakdown of society and how it's being manipulated by the globalist
[54:28.600 --> 54:32.000]  tell us you had a couple more points you wanted to make absolutely and we're
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.120]  going to five after the Gucci art is coming in the mark dice is coming on
[54:35.120 --> 54:40.240]  and then Paul watch them with a lot of breaking news again this is all part of
[54:40.240 --> 54:44.320]  the dumbing down process and you have to understand these masses of dumb down
[54:44.320 --> 54:48.000]  people where they pay poor folks to have kids and then basically lobby with
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.080]  conditioning for upper-class folks to not have children this is all part of a
[54:52.080 --> 54:55.320]  phase just to bring down society on record Department of Education
[54:55.320 --> 54:58.800]  Charlotte is there he was there in the 80s she published the secret documents
[54:58.800 --> 55:03.040]  in her book deliberate dumbing down that we sell an abridged version the big
[55:03.040 --> 55:07.440]  thick one sold out and it it is a program that's why we know what the
[55:07.440 --> 55:11.680]  program is and so they will vote to take our private property they will vote to
[55:11.680 --> 55:15.760]  take our guns they will vote to take our children they're announcing the new
[55:15.760 --> 55:20.280]  culture and saying the problem is not enough socialism not enough
[55:20.280 --> 55:25.440]  centralization but again it's fascism sitting above socialism now let's
[55:25.440 --> 55:30.240]  expand on this you see these dangerous hordes countless videos of people beating
[55:30.240 --> 55:35.080]  up men women and children for their Xboxes for their toys the idea that
[55:35.080 --> 55:38.560]  this is where they can be somebody this is their football field this is their
[55:38.560 --> 55:42.560]  competition they're not in the woods fighting you know to go pick more
[55:42.560 --> 55:46.640]  bananas than the other primitive human running to the jungle they are battling
[55:46.640 --> 55:51.480]  in in the fields of Walmart the streets are fields that never died a quote Jim
[55:51.480 --> 55:56.880]  Morrison and the police are there to arrest whoever videotapes it not
[55:56.880 --> 56:00.200]  arresting the people they're foraging and they've been doing tests letting
[56:00.200 --> 56:04.160]  ebt's be unlimited in Walmart to see what happens or turning them off to see
[56:04.160 --> 56:07.720]  what happens that they can only do this because people aren't individuals
[56:07.720 --> 56:13.880]  they're scientifically controlled now and just like you saw police in New
[56:13.880 --> 56:18.520]  Orleans and other areas stealing during Katrina you're going to see the
[56:18.520 --> 56:22.880]  breakdown of society and I think the establishment has overdone it I think
[56:22.880 --> 56:27.560]  things are going to collapse so bad in this country that we have a chance as
[56:27.560 --> 56:31.880]  Ron Paul has said to use the collapse of crony capitalism and socialism and
[56:31.880 --> 56:39.440]  mobsterism insiderism gangsterism cronyism monopolism to restore the
[56:39.440 --> 56:43.120]  republic but anybody that says those of us that work hard and don't produce
[56:43.120 --> 56:47.160]  aren't giving enough and that we're bad France has a hundred percent tax now in
[56:47.160 --> 56:50.400]  the middle class to extinct them the ultra-rich socialists that run the
[56:50.400 --> 56:54.840]  country are tax exempt on record this is mainstream news the police on record
[56:54.840 --> 56:58.640]  end up not paying tax most of it government can do whatever they want be
[56:58.640 --> 57:02.560]  above the law we're not and that leads me to the last article upon info wars
[57:02.560 --> 57:07.120]  calm I'm gonna be covering this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. the lawlessness of
[57:07.120 --> 57:10.320]  government I'm getting a bunch of examples on the Sunday show this is out
[57:10.320 --> 57:16.720]  of ammo land it links to mainstream news and goes through a whole raft of
[57:16.720 --> 57:21.560]  examples the headline is legalized theft of guns where if the cops come to your
[57:21.560 --> 57:25.680]  house for a fire or if the neighbor sees you cleaning a gun in your garage this
[57:25.680 --> 57:29.440]  is what I see most often the news they come and take all your guns and say
[57:29.440 --> 57:33.520]  your neighbor was scared and then don't give them back saying it's our policy
[57:33.520 --> 57:37.760]  you've got to ask the judge and then it takes two years with lawyers to get it
[57:37.760 --> 57:42.240]  back and instead of a grand jury indicting the police or unlawful
[57:42.240 --> 57:47.520]  confiscation of property they act like it's okay and this is part of a larger
[57:47.520 --> 57:52.440]  lawlessness of the NSA lawlessness of Obama lawlessness putting our military
[57:52.440 --> 57:56.320]  under NATO lawlessness putting fluoride in the water which is forced medication
[57:56.320 --> 58:00.680]  with a toxic chemical there's hundreds of examples people can tweet and give me
[58:00.680 --> 58:03.880]  your example at real Alex Jones because I'm gonna be compiling these this weekend
[58:03.880 --> 58:09.240]  there's hundreds of government lawless this is called tyranny and all over the
[58:09.240 --> 58:13.120]  country they're confiscating people's guns they're taking people's kids for
[58:13.120 --> 58:17.560]  not inoculating them when there's no law it's the family courts it's a look
[58:17.560 --> 58:22.320]  that's what tyranny is is a mass movement of lawlessness hoping to
[58:22.320 --> 58:26.680]  overwhelm us at so many fundamental levels with imperious arrogant government
[58:26.680 --> 58:31.280]  and corporations that control it that we collapse and give in so this is how
[58:31.280 --> 58:34.600]  criminal government criminal corporations and criminal individuals they
[58:34.600 --> 58:38.200]  see themselves advanced through the welfare system through Obamacare
[58:38.200 --> 58:41.680]  through Black Friday through these artificial constructs thank you for

[59:00.840 --> 59:04.680]  huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat they
[59:04.680 --> 59:08.760]  know that a massive nuclear attack is coming they want that attack to come
[59:08.760 --> 59:13.080]  Joel Scowzen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic
[59:13.080 --> 59:17.560]  relocation and the securing of your home what I tell people is that you do have
[59:17.560 --> 59:21.520]  time we talk about natural disasters the health environment we talk about
[59:21.520 --> 59:25.520]  pollution the water quality my personal experience about being in every one of
[59:25.520 --> 59:28.800]  these states most people won't even be ready won't be able to get out of town
[59:28.800 --> 59:33.480]  because there'll be absolute panic there is no preparedness without strategy

[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:26.400]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this day after Thanksgiving
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.760]  Black Friday as it's also known Alex Jones is in the studio with us and he's
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.960]  been breaking down what this really means and he's got a couple more points go
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.440]  forward Alex that's right coming up in the next segment David you're gonna
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:42.680]  recap your view on this and where it's all going the FAD-ism the hype culture
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.440]  the mind control culture and that's my biggest point here is that this is a
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:52.400]  culture who's told by the system Obamacare is your free ticket is is your
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:58.400]  heaven vaccines are gonna make you never die never get cancer vaccines are a
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:03.360]  panacea GMO is a panacea and then you actually study everything the globalists
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.680]  do it's all a fraud to enslave because the globalists are taking over the
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:14.480]  planet they're trying to conquer life on earth as we know it but bottom line this
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.440]  is mass mind control this is cultural manipulation and Black Friday gets worse
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.240]  and gets longer each and every year and and and let's be clear it's a
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:30.400]  substratum of society who tend to vote Democratic and who tend to really think
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.280]  in their life someone in the power structure is gonna give them something
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:39.880]  well only for after you exactly but but only for a season all of that will
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:43.440]  leave just like Greece just like Spain just like all these other countries just
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:49.040]  like Nigeria just like Chile once they're done and once they wipe out the
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.080]  middle-class folks it never comes back this is a a planned program and I've
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.880]  made a lot of points here it's just that it's the it's it's the lawlessness of
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:02.920]  the government itself and corporations that is the real telltale sign and
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:08.320]  imagine our forebears if they could see Americans just randomly in a frenzy
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:14.440]  believing they would find salvation in a Walmart buying slave goods from a
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.040]  country designed to dehumanize their own population with thousands of riots a
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:23.840]  month forced abortions suicide nets prozac being forced on the workers 16
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:29.400]  17 hours a day they're living in the streets just hell on earth had this
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:34.480]  plays out in Greece we just had an article earlier this week where he had
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:41.560]  covered of an older man who is living on 300 euros a month and a lot of these
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:46.720]  people are injecting themselves with HIV so they can get 700 euros a month
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.280]  which and a little bit more health care killing yourself to live exactly there
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.480]  but there's they don't even have enough money to buy food and that's what we're
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.080]  really concerned about when we see these kind of riot thousands are dumping
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.040]  their children and that's the key when you come back make that point I should
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.000]  have made that up front that's the big issue imagine this domesticated population
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.600]  who will beat each other up and trample each other over over an Xbox that spies
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.440]  on everything you're doing in your house they their fantasy world where they're a
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:17.560]  top general their total failures on their own life but but they're they're a
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.800]  top general in their video game world so many people that have worked here who
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.880]  been okay folks were always exhausted and couldn't work we had to let them go
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:28.480]  because they were playing video games all night and exhausted in their fantasy
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.960]  world they were a movie star second life you know in and it's so sad they're

[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:32.120]  Thanksgiving black friday as it's known we've been looking at the madness of
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:36.880]  crowds and what that might pretend for the future especially as shaky as
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.040]  things are financially as well as the drawn-out supply lines we have in this
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.440]  country anything could happen we need to be prepared for what's going to happen
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:50.200]  but when you look at what the crowds are doing on black friday drudge report
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.600]  has this broken out we got maul mayhem we've got a man stabbed over a parking
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:57.360]  spot we've got shoppers kicked out of walmart for filming a fight we've got the
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:01.760]  salvation army kettles stolen a man shot walking home with a big screen TV and
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.360]  one of the stories is linked from info wars dot com santa with megaphone
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.680]  shames Thanksgiving parasite shoppers that's a mark dice piece and we're gonna
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.920]  have mark dice at the bottom of the hour he's going to we're gonna look at his
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:19.000]  video he's going to talk to us about what he saw on black friday and leading up
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.800]  to it actually on gray thursday they're calling it now used to be Thanksgiving
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:26.360]  used to be a time of Thanksgiving if any what do you think that's exactly right
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.440]  and what concerns me is this is what we have to look forward to if we can't
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.080]  completely transform society there's no question going back to hurricane sandy if
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:37.200]  you remember that I was up in the northeast in Philadelphia when that
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:41.600]  happened and I made a video it was I guess that was what years ago I made a
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.200]  video in CVS I went in there to get something real quick all the water was
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.240]  gone the toilet paper was gone there were people shoving each other and this
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.840]  was before it even hit it didn't even hit Philadelphia that hard it was like
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:57.000]  nothing shoving each other to get toilet paper in bulk as we're going to be
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.920]  there for six months you know without a toilet paper but that's what this comes
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.880]  down to they're killing each other over TVs what they're paying more for they're
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.400]  telling each other to pay more for consumer items yeah that's the other
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.720]  thing is a big fraud yes just consumer items so they're gonna go from they're
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:16.960]  gonna go from Walmart riots to cannibalism in a very short time if we
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.320]  really have some kind of a major infrastructure breakdown well the experts
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.560]  say about two weeks is how long we have before people literally are in the
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:29.160]  street killing each other and eating each other because the food will go bad
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.360]  in the fridge the food will go bad in the freezer you know ultimately it comes
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:37.080]  down to you know the one person that is prepared is the target let me give out
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.000]  this phone number because we want to take your calls on this and and get your
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.760]  feedback from what you've seen out there on black Friday it's 800 259 9231
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:52.320]  that's 800 259 9231 to talk to Anthony and I and we're gonna have Mark dice in
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.880]  at the bottom of the hour let's take a quick look at this video that he's got
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:01.240]  linked off of drudge report on to info wars.com he's dressed up as a Santa Claus
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:06.880]  and he's driving by bullhorning shoppers who are out there just consuming away
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.720]  here's a little clip from that black Friday Thanksgiving shopping is
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:16.120]  destroying the very fabric of the family ruining the Thanksgiving tradition and
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.720]  it's about time somebody do something about it.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:26.480]  Thank you for not spending time with Grandma and Grandpa and leaving them and
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:31.520]  destroying the very fabric of society for buying more slave goods. Okay we're gonna
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:34.240]  come back we're gonna have the rest of that video later in the show and we're
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.800]  gonna be talking to the guy who made that video Mark dice and he's gonna tell
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:41.640]  us what he saw and what he experienced there on black Friday. What do you think
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.040]  about that video? Have you seen that video? I have seen that video I'm
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.240]  interested to talk to Mark but at the same time on the flip side of that I
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:52.320]  mean here we are you know just a week ago myself and Alex were in Dallas and
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.560]  it was 28 degrees if I recall yeah shivering for eight hours in the rain
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.360]  declaring the First Amendment to be right declaring the Constitution to
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.760]  exist being attacked by goon squads from the sheriff's office and as you may
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.600]  tell in my voice you know I'm actually battling some type of sickness right now
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:13.160]  but I'm here because guess what there's no time to lose yesterday even I was
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:16.440]  working you know you were working you were there filming the black Friday
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:20.920]  insanity or the gray Thursday or whatever it is this is a time of victory at
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.760]  the same time to reflect on Thanksgiving as it was meant to be to
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.520]  reflect on the reality of how far we have come the mainstream media is dead
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:32.080]  that's why the new magazine which actually I was looking at the cover and
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:36.400]  talking about that a couple weeks ago it's so clear to me now the dinosaur
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:40.120]  media is dead and the new alternative media the real media which is an
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.160]  alternative anymore is the media period is the comet that killed the dinosaur
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:49.680]  media right exploding and wiping them all out and here they are staring up at
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.200]  the sky freaking out because they don't know what to do so they start hiding
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:57.960]  under a rock or a tree and it's a comet the comet is going to blow up the tree
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.400]  and blow up the rock and they're sitting there under the rock freaking out and
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.440]  saying stop them you know go get those people they're crazy stop the comet and
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:09.400]  they're just completely obliterated yeah you saw that in Dallas and here we are
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.240]  again one week later just pushing it even harder and guess what the reason
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.520]  Mark Dykes Mark Mark Dice's videos on Drudge Report and how so many views is
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:19.800]  because people know what's going on they watch these these videos and
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:24.000]  discussed and they say how can people act like that you know how could how could
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.680]  they possibly be so primal over a television I mean you could see a
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:32.160]  grandmother having super strength to pick up a car which happens all the time
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.920]  for you know her her granddaughter whatever underneath it trapped they have
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.040]  super strength they have that primal ability to help people but they're
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:43.440]  focusing that adrenaline and primal rush on something as stupid as a television
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.920]  that's when we know we need a complete transmogrification of how people think
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.440]  ideologically at a societal level if we're gonna get anywhere and ultimately
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.720]  though I think we are achieving it that's why they are freaking out about
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.520]  this when we're saying look at these crazy zombies and there's so many people
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:59.840]  saying well yeah they are zombies so I think we are having a major victory
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.560]  there's also an element of this madness of crowds you know people see everybody
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:06.400]  lined up and they say hey there must be a great deal in there you know so that
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:11.000]  they go in there and that's part of the thing they do give people some real good
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.480]  deals they may not have very many of those really good deals and you may get
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.520]  in there even if you're going in there to get that one thing that you think
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.800]  that you're getting a really good price on they know that you're going to start
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.640]  impulse buying once you get in there any smart business person would raise the
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:28.600]  prices dramatically just before the MSRP which is the retail listed price
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.720]  suggested price they would slash the MSRP by like 90% after raising it that's
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:38.120]  right it was a Christmas time and say wow you're getting $500 off on this TV when
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.600]  you know they actually sell it for $100 or whatever it is those are the same
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.880]  people that stand in the TSA lines yes and love it and say yeah they're
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.200]  protecting us this is the exact same people the headlines in the Business
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:53.960]  Week article is hey shoppers like Friday savings are a hoax and this is a long-term
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.160]  trend that they've looked at they analyze the price data they looked at it
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.200]  online they looked at in regional chains and they know exactly what they're
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:05.360]  talking about they are hoax but TSA is a hoax as well and they can pull that off
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.000]  by scaring people you know that that's part of the crowd mentality and the TSA
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.600]  even admitted in their own internal documents that there was no threat
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:16.040]  against airports and airplanes back in 2011 at the same time they were
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:21.240]  threatening Texas with a no-fly zone if we put on some kind of anti-groping
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:26.040]  constraints on what the TSA was doing to men women and children no the real
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:30.000]  threat are the homeless people that were given dinners check this out this just
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.120]  came out of story leak we're gonna have it up on info wars church group kicked
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.760]  out of public park for handing out Thanksgiving dinners to homeless didn't
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:41.600]  print out very well but ultimately the story is and it was in CBS 12 which
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:45.240]  props to the local news station trying to be the alternative media now this
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.360]  church group went to a park I watched the video before it came on air here
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:52.200]  handing out Thanksgiving meals to homeless people because they felt bad and
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.240]  you know they actually wanted them a meal and the park ranger comes up and
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:59.320]  he says I have orders from the top you guys got to get off this public park you
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.240]  can't give out food here to homeless people and they say well you know why
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:06.240]  can't we do that we're just having a picnic and also offering it to the
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.840]  homeless who are coming here and all the homeless are saying yeah thank God for
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:11.920]  this you know this feels like Thanksgiving again I haven't even eaten
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.440]  anything the attack is on free association not organizing outside of a
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.800]  box store is illegal look at Dallas if you let one aunt stand up they might all
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.520]  stand up they're afraid of individuals coming together and free association
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:30.320]  they're afraid of look how we built info wars because of free association they
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:34.160]  are scared of individuals they want a monopoly we're only the government and
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.080]  mega corporations are allowed to organize people at sports stadiums with
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:43.240]  TSA diddling us that's exactly right and homeless people are now evil and the
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:46.720]  right to actually help people and help others I mean for example I've actually
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:50.760]  given food all the time to homeless people I'm driving and the one time the
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.280]  guy was just like shaking it was freezing I said here take this he said no
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.200]  no no watch out buddy watch out and I said what's wrong you said you see that
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.240]  cup over there he's waiting for you to give me food so he can take you down
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.700]  really that's a true story yeah really here in Austin was it just food or was
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:07.920]  it but you could give him money in the cup of E okay with it but if you give
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:12.560]  him food he's gonna take you down it was one of those cliff bars that I have
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:16.120]  cliff bars in my car for this reason and I gave him a cliff bar I was going to
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.960]  give him a cliff price and whoa whoa unless you want to go to jail or be
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:22.640]  taken down by that cop don't give me that food well well they have to
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.800]  establish that authority and just like Alex was saying last week in Dallas they
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.840]  even said that we can't let this guy get away when Alex was handing out flyers
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.440]  in front of the Federal Reserve telling people where they could listen where we
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.760]  were meeting what was going to be happening they organized that we could
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.960]  have take that guy down and I was there they said all criminals we asked them
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.040]  and they said you're all criminals you could all be arrested and give it a
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.840]  $500 fine for having a sign near a road and then you ask well where is there
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.040]  not a road in Dallas and then they say well there's a free speech zone over at
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.880]  this park here in the middle of nowhere and that's ultimately where we went just
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:59.680]  to just to not completely get smashed in by police just to show how ludicrous it
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.760]  was we went to the free speech zone and then ultimately we said you know what
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:05.680]  forget all this and went to the barricades and that's when they started
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:09.240]  completely assaulting us for doing nothing let's go to our calls we've got
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.280]  Marvin from Texas on the line Marvin what did you want to tell us about Black
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:16.920]  Friday or the madness of crowds I just want to kind of talk to you a little
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:23.640]  bit about the Walmart fiasco it seems like well they're they're run by
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:30.080]  globalists themselves but I brought one of the iPad minis where you pay 299 you
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:34.840]  get the $100 gift card well you don't even get the gift card at the time you're
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:41.520]  in a store it's an e-card they email to your mail to you at a time whenever they
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:45.600]  feel they want to send it to you so I was trying to buy something and then they
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:49.600]  got your email address then they can send you stuff all the time yeah and you
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:53.840]  know what when you log in when you make create a Walmart profile they ask for
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.640]  your cell phone number your name your email address so you know there they go
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:03.280]  getting into your business more but I want everything digital so they can
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:07.280]  track it and then game it always idiots go I don't care if they spy on me they
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:12.440]  use the spying systems to game everybody folks that's the point is it's a

[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:36.320]  guys had up there oh you know during the JFK right I'm with it it's not what
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:41.640]  mentioned was the assault on the on the pro not the not the protest yet all
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.200]  the mainstream media covered us it was the biggest story because they had
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:47.520]  nothing else going for them well the Dallas Morning News mentioned it just to
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:51.240]  try to ridicule us for even being out there about free speech whether you
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:54.720]  agree with what we're talking about or not we have free speech and we need to
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.960]  stand up for that or we're gonna lose those rights I'll be right back with

[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:16.320]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight coming in for Alex and I'm
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:20.280]  joined here in studio with Anthony Gutiarty from Story League now Anthony we've
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:24.000]  been talking about Black Friday but there's another aspect of this and that's
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.880]  just the random senseless violence where they're not even attacking people
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.440]  because they want their little Walmart television but just coming up and
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:36.800]  clocking people's this case that happened this week of this fairly well-known
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:41.600]  chef who was in New York City they came up they broke his jaw they broke his
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:45.920]  nose I believe it was we're seeing this happening though all over the country
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:49.840]  this isn't something that just limited to the big cities what does that tell you
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:54.560]  along with what we see with Black Friday can you imagine the societal
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:58.920]  collapse which is coming you know ushering in all of these zombies who
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.440]  are willing to kill people for big screen TVs what they would do in a real
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.400]  collapse scenario flooding into the streets just anyone with any material
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:09.980]  goods would be taken down and that's the whole thing thank God for the Second
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:14.040]  Amendment and also we have to look at it in this perspective to Hurricane Sandy
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.240]  see I was up in the Northeast when that was actually happening so it flashes me
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:21.520]  back to that in New York major flooding there was taxis going down the street in
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:27.720]  wells of water and what we saw though was FEMA gods coming in yes with with
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:32.320]  literal trucks of Doritos and Mountain Dew just corporate ownership coming in
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:36.840]  the corporations were descending their leathery black wings over New York and
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.440]  everyone was just crowding around these trucks and trying to push them over to
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:44.240]  get their Doritos out and drink their Mountain Dew and that's exactly what
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.800]  would happen the same people that are patrolling Walmart and the same people
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.920]  kicking out churchgoers who are trying to feed the homeless would come over with
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:56.480]  assault rifles and assault weapons and their black uniforms and they would be
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:00.280]  gods and the corporations would come in with FEMA and the government they would
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.120]  offer Doritos and Mountain Dew and we would have to just beg for it and that's
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.400]  literally what would happen that's what FEMA gave you know when you're talking
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:10.560]  about FEMA the way they've handled these disasters or mishandled them my son
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.880]  when I contested the Frazier Institute essentially contrasting a couple of
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.880]  disasters that happened in North Carolina one that was pretty localized it
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.560]  was a tornado that came through a small town and devastated but just that one
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.920]  little area another one we had a hurricane come through and hit a large
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:29.440]  area so FEMA got involved FEMA came in and set themselves up and created this
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:32.960]  massive bottleneck where nobody could get anything you talk about how they were
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:36.960]  handing out Mountain Dew and they were finding junk food yeah kill each other
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:41.000]  for a bag of chips today is a hurricane FEMA was keeping people from getting
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.840]  anything in contrast the way it used to be done was the way it was done in the
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:49.120]  small town that was hit by the tornado that was just about 10 15 minutes away
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:52.640]  from where we lived in that particular scenario the police came in they kept
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:56.440]  people away from downed power lines which is a good thing other than that they
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.920]  didn't get involved in people's lives and they allowed businesses to come in
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:05.840]  and just dump massive quantities of food and things that people really needed in
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:09.680]  church parking lots and the churches handed the stuff out to people and
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:13.640]  distributed it is now illegal completely voluntary because you didn't have the
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:18.120]  federal government coming in and creating this top-down bottleneck that
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:21.400]  they that you see happen every time FEMA gets involved which the police now
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:24.360]  arrest you if you do that if you give out food to anyone that needs it you
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.040]  have the government and FEMA shut down all before a hurricane Sandy even came
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:31.000]  in they just shut down didn't help anyone then they came in with their
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.600]  corporate overlords with the trucks of Doritos that's their response and that
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:37.760]  was just a hurricane like one or two days after a hurricane happened when
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.200]  most people were actually fine the streets were flooded and you know
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:44.000]  buildings were destroyed but just imagine the actual societal collapse you
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.280]  actually imagine it and the only defense against us and complete
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:50.840]  destruction of our homes and our family is the Second Amendment that's right
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:54.000]  no one can argue against the Second Amendment for that very reason others
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.840]  mm-hmm we've looked we saw that happen in the LA riots you saw it amazingly there
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:03.800]  it was the Korean shop owners who were defending themselves against the
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:07.840]  rioting crowds using the Second Amendment and they were the only ones who
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:11.920]  basically didn't get wiped out and the police aren't going to come and save you
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:15.040]  that's right riders they're going to go after the church people who are giving
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.880]  out food to homeless people well in the LA riots what the police did you had
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:22.480]  to loot your houses like in Hurricane Katrina you had police chief Gates who
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:27.600]  had led the move towards SWAT teams and the militarization of the police there
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.440]  in LA and they were heavily heavily armed compared to every other police
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.320]  department in the country and yet what they did was they took that militarized
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:39.200]  police force and they used it to surround the police stations they use it to
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.280]  surround city hall because they're they're concerned about themselves and
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:47.320]  that's what FEMA is concerned about it's concerned about the continuity of
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:50.160]  government it's all about the government it's not about taking care of people
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:53.920]  we've seen this every time there's a disaster just think about this in Dallas
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:57.120]  they attacked us for doing nothing and having a First Amendment just standing
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:00.560]  there behind barricades that they said were magically blocking us from entering
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.760]  a public event just think about that they attacked us for nothing what would
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.120]  they do in the event that their families needed food and were threatened as well
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:12.000]  because the worst things get the more power they get it's easier to wreck
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.560]  society and then take it over then build a good society because we have a
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:19.760]  society run by criminals now and we the good people have to stand up and take
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:23.120]  this country back and that's exactly what they want they want to own
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.800]  everything they want to turn us back into a kind of a needle neo feudal
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:30.880]  that's what the goal of the elite is that's why they're taking everything
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.520]  they want us all to be turned into renters we have to buy everything from
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:37.360]  them we're gonna be right back with mark dice and we're gonna play his video
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:41.040]  that's top linked on drudge and we're gonna talk to him about what he saw on

[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:31.760]  how in the disasters that you saw sandy up in philadelphia
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:35.280]  bima showed up and they started handing out mountain dew and junk food and
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:38.720]  people were fighting over that i'm trying to find ways that i can get
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:42.880]  healthier food and info wars life is is rolling out new
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:46.880]  products you've got this nascent iodine survival shield
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.680]  very pure form of iodine you've been involved in that from the very beginning
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:52.560]  tell us a little bit about what your goals were how you put this together no
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.880]  that's exactly right the government wants to give you
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:57.920]  doritos and mountain dew with high fructose corn syrup that admittedly
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:01.840]  contains mercury which admittedly contains genetically modified
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:05.280]  ingredients and the whole thing within forest life has always been
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:09.520]  rejecting thousands of products finding the best the kernel

[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:28.800]  nascent iodine also tastes amazingly good yeah and i'm actually really happy
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:32.800]  logistically we finally have some more in stock today
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.480]  so if you go ahead to info wars life dot com and you purchase them for yourself
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:39.840]  and your family in the event of a disaster this is what i have in my
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.640]  medicine cabinet this is what i take on a daily basis
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:45.680]  as well to prepare myself and we finally have some
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.040]  in stock thank god because you know i know
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:51.840]  so many people want it to prepare themselves just you know in the event of
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:55.040]  a disaster that we do have some if you order it today it should go out today
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.920]  if you order it soon enough otherwise it will go out monday
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:01.520]  and then also so you mentioned it tastes good i mean it really does that's
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:04.800]  that's the thing about a lot of these supplements that you get a lot of people
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:08.800]  take things in pills because the taste is so bad of the other forms
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:11.760]  but it's a lot more bio available if you get in liquid form and that's one of
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:14.800]  the things about that iodine is it really tastes good but i mean my
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:19.120]  whole thing is dr group the developer of the nason iodine
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:22.720]  his process is so astounding to me even even though i know it when he tells me
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:26.080]  more about it each and every day i'm just my mind is blown the sound wave
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:28.560]  technology the russian russian physicist he brings
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:32.800]  in with the patents on this technology just completely just make sure it tastes
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.480]  the best it works the absolute best all the testing he's done i won't even get
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:40.080]  into how much money he spent on just testing the purity alone just over and
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.200]  over again making sure it's the best and that's why i know i'm good with
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:46.640]  promoting it creating the third largest natural health site in the world
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:50.400]  i'm only okay with promoting and you know overseeing products that are good
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.280]  and we've got another aim on this we've got another product wake up america
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:56.240]  coffee that that's enough i'm talking about tasting good that's great
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:00.400]  i mean i i just started drinking coffee because i'm trying to get off of
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:04.160]  my vice which is soda pop we just talked about how harmful soda pop is the high
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:08.720]  fructose corn syrup things like that but this is a this is the best coffee i've
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:11.440]  tasted i don't even drink coffee and i said this before
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:14.880]  but this coffee is actually really good and to add that on there is an immune
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.000]  support bonus as well on the black one this is my favorite right here
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.120]  because you're actually getting immune support with various mushroom blends
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:25.280]  and that's key to me because i know there is studies out there coffee is a key
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.560]  element in numerous aspects of health but with the immune support you're also
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.040]  adding that extra kick and it doesn't taste bad tastes good
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:34.960]  so that's the one i take and drink on the daily basis but for me you're also
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:37.440]  if you support the first amendment you know if you support what we did in
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:41.840]  dallas that takes funds that's right that takes massive activism
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:45.680]  there's a you know we printed 30 000 of the signs we went out got you know the
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.880]  hotel rooms to be there he brought his whole crew out
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:52.960]  you know to do this for eight hours and 28 degree you know weather
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:58.240]  that takes fuel in a couple days or in gasoline and i'm all about fueling you
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:02.560]  know what is info wars and fueling alex is a you know major goals
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:06.640]  and that's what's key to me not only are you preparing your health which is great
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:10.000]  but you're fueling all this at a major level it's an info wars life.com
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.960]  that's where you can find this stuff we're trying to bring you
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.040]  good quality products great quality products and as anthony said that's how
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:21.280]  we fund the operation now we've got on the phone line joining us now is
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:25.440]  mark dice mark's got a video that's top linked on drudge

[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:32.080]  let's take a look at this video and then we're going to bring mark dice on to
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:35.840]  talk about it this black friday thanksgiving shopping is
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:39.440]  destroying the very fabric of the family ruining the
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.040]  thanksgiving tradition and it's about time somebody do
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.080]  something about it

[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:56.160]  and destroying the very fabric of society for buying more slave goods

[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:22.400]  there's a target isn't got people lined up for
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:25.680]  life thirsty destroying the very thanksgiving tradition
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:29.520]  you're teaching your children such great family values
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:32.560]  let's not have the family together for dinner
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:36.800]  let's get everybody out to buy a bigger television and more iPads
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:41.440]  so that they don't talk to each other thank you enemies of america
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:46.880]  thank you parasites on this country how much credit card debt do you all have
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:54.320]  oh oh oh you're all a disgrace to christmas shame on you all from the north
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:39:02.480]  oh you are parasites and debt slaves mentally enslaved
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:10.160]  you are enemies of america you are enemies of the family
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:13.760]  and i'm pretty much on all of you for this you guys can see the rest of that
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:19.360]  video on info wars dot com mark uh san is usually there to promote
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.080]  consumerism you uh use them for something else
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:25.520]  didn't you you know the black friday madness has just
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:28.960]  really gotten me angry because it is ruining thanksgiving
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.560]  the poor workers that have to work these bizarre hours have to take a sleeping
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:36.320]  pill at one in the afternoon to go to sleep and try to get up and work these
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.360]  bizarre hours we have countless families
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:42.880]  that are sacrificing and leaving thanksgiving dinner early
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:45.920]  spending time with grandma grandpa aunts and uncles people that they hardly
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:49.120]  ever see to go and stand in line for hours
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:54.880]  and hours and hours to maybe save a few dollars and so the video that you showed
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:57.440]  started off a little sarcastic a little
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:01.840]  uh ingest and then it did get a little caustic but
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:07.040]  somebody has to try to reach these people they are destroying the very fabric
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:11.040]  of the family on thanksgiving a day when we're supposed to be thankful for what
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.760]  we have they're sacrificing and leaving their
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:18.000]  families to go and get more iphones more ipads bigger televisions
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.440]  so that they can isolate themselves in their own little world
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:24.640]  not talking and communicating with their own family members
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:28.160]  yeah something that's being done driven by big box retailers isn't it i i
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:31.520]  didn't when we were out on thanksgiving looking for crowds
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:35.040]  we didn't see any at the mom and pop stores local retailers
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.800]  even some of the big box stores like hobby lobby they weren't open they were
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:41.840]  closed but you've got a lot of these other stores where
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.640]  if they can just make a few more bucks they're going to try to beat out the
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:47.920]  other big box retailer right it's horrific i mean some of these
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.600]  stores coals department store jc penny and we have people that are working
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:55.280]  there in their 40s 50s perhaps in their 60s that may be
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:58.320]  forced or coerced into working these bizarre
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.320]  graveyard shift hours on one of the holiest days
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.440]  of the family you know if it was black friday which
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.960]  it was supposed to be contained to black friday and then as we all know it
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:12.480]  started encroaching the stores started opening a little bit earlier a
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:17.840]  little bit earlier 8am 6am 4am causing many people to
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.160]  have to leave their thanksgiving family dinners
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:23.040]  early to then go to bed so that they could then work
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:27.120]  black friday at these early hours now having to sacrifice their very
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:31.920]  thanksgiving dinner and these zombies these parasites
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:37.760]  are it's it's a symptomatic reflection of the destruction of the family values
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:41.520]  of this almost completion of the illuminati controlled
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:44.800]  new world order when we have people leaving
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.400]  thanksgiving dinner to go and buy more crap
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:52.240]  it's it's absolutely incredible i mean i can't express how disappointed and
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:55.920]  gray i am i'm sure it reminds me even jesus went in
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:59.520]  and whipped the money changers you know i mean sometimes you have to be harsh
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.280]  to these people because they just don't get it
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:05.120]  i mean it's a little hard to whip to them i tried to play if they weren't there
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:08.720]  if nobody showed up the big box retailers wouldn't do this so ultimately
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:11.680]  it's these people lining up at midnight to get in and
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:15.280]  and get their television set that's causing people to have to work on thanksgiving
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:19.360]  well and i think the key question though mark is this foreshadowing
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.560]  what's to come i mean what happens in actual societal collapse
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.280]  what do you what does this mean to us i mean there's people out there
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:28.480]  willing to kill each other for a hundred dollars off on a tv when they're
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.680]  actually spending more money what are they going to do when they have no food
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:35.200]  no these these are zombies these are parasites they're virtually animals it's
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.280]  it's unbelievable that's why i i try not to just to ridicule them try not to
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:42.080]  just to shame them i tried to plant some seeds
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:45.760]  asking them if they have a retirement plan asking them about their credit card
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.000]  debt trying to get them to think about this
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.520]  gold and silver and investments in the family and what are these people
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.680]  teaching their children to go and leave thanksgiving dinner
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:59.040]  forget talking to grandma and grandpa and the wisdom that they have gathered
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:02.800]  over their many years on this earth go and try to save a couple bucks on a
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:06.080]  big screen television so that you don't have to talk to your family members
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:09.440]  and i encourage other people i encourage other people to do this
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:14.880]  and i think if we can if we can create such a shameful environment if we can
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:18.320]  cause people to understand the damage that this is doing
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:23.520]  then maybe we can shame and convince these big box retailers
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:28.000]  to reverse this trend and stay closed on thanksgiving
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.920]  what's next open on christmas day for after the holiday bargains it has to
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:37.360]  stop now you know i was kind of disturbed too i was
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:41.040]  asking people who was getting the xbox one and i found a family
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.760]  very young child and i said which watch is you naked
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:47.840]  yeah exactly and so i started talking to the mom actually over the over the
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:50.960]  child i said you're aware of what it's watching
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:54.160]  you're aware of how it's trying to manipulate your child
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:57.920]  looking at his heartbeat looking at his body language so it can keep him hooked
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:01.360]  in the how do you feel about that she kind of just kind of sheepishly shrugged
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.560]  and and he goes i i want it mommy you know
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:08.240]  well that's the key thing people are willing to do anything for these
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:12.320]  worthless plastic goods yes what are they willing to do
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:15.600]  when society collapses and they have no food what are they going to do with
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:20.320]  they're being driven to this primal adrenaline rush rage over a tv
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:23.520]  by design from these corporate oars what are they going to do when their
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:26.960]  family needs a loaf of bread they'll kill anybody and
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:30.320]  anyone they would probably kill their grandma just to take her last jar of
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.680]  peanut butter i mean if you saw the video which is
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:37.280]  youtube.com slash mark dice or info wars.com
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.120]  before i started megaphone as i'm driving up you can see almost everybody
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:44.080]  standing in line wasn't talking and hanging out and having a big
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:47.520]  festive environment every single person virtually was standing in
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:52.240]  line staring at their phone it's absolutely disgusting
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:56.000]  i don't even know what else to say i just i'm glad that you know i'm not the
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.840]  only one that feels this way i'm glad that info wars is on this and that we
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:04.080]  are seeing a kind of a backlash thankfully drudge is posting the
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:07.200]  the video of these zombie plagues and the violence
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:11.120]  these people are not civil it's not a big fun festive
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.880]  environment it is becoming a very dangerous
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:18.640]  place to go and to bring children to and it's just a disgusting
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:21.920]  symptom of the new world order that's nearly completed well i think you're
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.000]  right in saying that the key here is shaming the people that will wait 24
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.440]  hours to get 100 off a tv that's the msrp of which has been
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:33.200]  raised $600 ultimately spending more money and fueling the machine
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.880]  and it also kind of goes you know hand in hand with this whole idea
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:40.080]  that the system is helping you the establishment is helping you as the
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:43.360]  mainstream media dies as all these corporations are flushed out by
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:46.240]  online retailers that actually have good deals and actually you know help to
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:51.120]  influence and educate people my thing is do you think we can
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:54.240]  overcome this and change society and transmogrify it to the point where
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:58.240]  people don't think this is cool anymore i hope so and that's what i'm trying to
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.560]  do and that's i know what you guys are trying to do and that's why i appreciate
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.960]  you having me on and spreading the word about the
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:08.080]  santa shaming parasite Thanksgiving shoppers because it's almost too late i
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:12.080]  mean thousands of people lining up outside of virtually every
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:15.920]  one of these stores the violence plaguing and i'll bet you most of these
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:21.120]  people are probably buying stuff on credit card paying 15 18 20 interest so
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:23.280]  even if they save a few hundred dollars on their
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:27.360]  chinese made slave goods in the long run they probably will never pay those
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:30.480]  items off or even if they do they will have more than paid
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:33.760]  the difference for what they saved to begin with i don't know if some of these
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:36.720]  people maybe just didn't hear of like amazon.com or
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:40.240]  overstock.com or you know maybe what i think what i'm going to do this
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:43.440]  after i'm going to go maybe salvation army and get a couple of nice books
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:46.880]  for 50 cents a piece books you mean those like
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:51.440]  paper things i don't know well you know we've seen people
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:54.640]  knocking each other around in stores on black friday before
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:58.000]  but now this year we've seen something a little bit different we've seen a
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.320]  further degradation and devaluing of of human life and respect for each other
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:05.760]  with this knockout game and i'm not surprised at all really to see what
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.200]  they're doing for television sets or consumer goods from china when
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:12.800]  we see the last several weeks we've seen this knockout game going on all over
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:16.320]  the country just no respect for human life or which is where they punch someone
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:19.680]  in the face and pretty much hope they die yeah just sneaking up behind somebody
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:23.280]  and hitting him you know when when you're in a city if you go to a
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:26.000]  if you go to a self-defense instructor they're going to talk about threat
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.360]  awareness right somebody else might just talk about street smarts
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.840]  and essentially that's what we're trying to do we're trying to give people
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:35.600]  some threat awareness about this fragile infrastructure we've got
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.840]  this economy that's very fragile and things that can happen and and give
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:43.600]  them some insight into what they can do to take care of their family now and
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.160]  the dangers that are possibly coming up with the infrastructure breakdown
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:51.200]  and this has been a long time in the making it's the breakdown of the family
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:54.480]  it's the breakdown of the schools it's the poisoning of the mainstream media
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:58.640]  it's this these Illuminati icons that these kids worship and
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.680]  you can destroy a country in a generation and that is what's happening
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:05.280]  and that's why I think all of us are trying to work as hard as we can
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:09.760]  to try to stop this or to slow it or to minimize it and thankfully there are
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:14.080]  some good stories we know the Pizza Hut manager refused to open
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:17.920]  and have his employees work on Thanksgiving he was fired
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:21.280]  after word spread about that and the Pizza Hut didn't want the negative
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:26.080]  publicity so they rehired him some stores like Hobby Lobby other
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:31.280]  Christian-owned stores refused to open on Thanksgiving and I think
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:34.640]  that you know shaming them is the right thing to do because these
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:39.040]  are these people are victims and willing victims in
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:42.720]  many cases of the psychological manipulation
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:46.960]  because human beings are very easily manipulated we're essentially just
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:51.600]  biological machines and the system knows how to push those
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:54.880]  buttons and manipulate people like Marionettes and so
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:58.960]  since we know some of those very same strategies we can use them to reach
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:02.320]  people to show them what's happening to them so that they're
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:05.920]  don't wake up you know in a boat with no oars
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.400]  five feet from Niagara Falls. Well the same techniques they use on us
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:13.360]  psychologically you know they insult people who don't go to Black Friday and
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:16.720]  they act like it's a cool thing to do go save $500 it's smart
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:21.040]  they have on all of the ads the magazines how much you save $600 today
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:24.320]  it's the same thing we're doing by you know you going out and pointing out how
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:27.040]  insane they are that's actually psychologically programming on a
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:30.000]  massive scale you know when it's on drugs everything like that for people
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.960]  to realize it's not cool I think it's a good idea well it's also the madness
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:35.840]  of crowds it's like what we're seeing going on with bitcoin everybody say
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:38.800]  hey this is you know this is big I got out there here's a line at the store
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:42.320]  they must have good stuff everybody's buying bitcoin it's going
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:45.520]  straight up astronomically so I need to get in on that if we don't stop it now
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:48.960]  then they will actually kill themselves when society collapses
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:52.560]  which will happen anyway but go ahead yeah I just saw an interview with Kanye
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.360]  West I call Kanye Pest one of the biggest rappers in the
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:58.640]  in the world as you know married to the antichrist of entertainment to
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:02.240]  Ken Kardashian or engaged to this just boff about worshiping blood bathing
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:06.080]  bimbo but he was saying how he didn't feel successful he
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:09.600]  didn't think that black people were successful because they didn't there
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.560]  weren't as many black billionaires and because
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:15.760]  only X amount of african-americans owned Maybach
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:19.040]  benzes you know what I think is a sign of a successful
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.200]  person is having a great family having some good kids being a quality man and
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:27.120]  sticking by your family these this mainstream media
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:31.680]  Illuminati controlled system has fed false idols
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:35.040]  to the youth and and really to the adults as well
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:41.440]  a teaching them in a false way what to aspire to be and perverting the very
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:45.120]  value systems where they believe that in order to be a happy
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:48.480]  successful peaceful person they need to have a Mercedes as opposed to having a
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:50.560]  quality that's exactly right mark hang on we're

[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:15.840]  joined the studio here with anthony gutiarty and we have
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:19.440]  mark dice on the line now mark has a video
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:22.880]  where he's dressed as santa claus and he's bullhorning the shoppers trying to
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:26.880]  get them to understand that they're not getting good deals that they're not
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:30.080]  doing anything that really makes any sense they're making people work on
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:33.760]  Thanksgiving it's a video this up on info wars.com it's linked
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:37.200]  from drudge you know there's also anthony an article
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:40.720]  from drudge about a north carolina store manager donating a hundred dollars
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:44.480]  after a thief steals a salvation army kettle from the mall
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.480]  that's the kind of thing that mark you were just talking about before the break
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:52.080]  how we need to lead and we've got some people like hobby lobby they were not
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:55.200]  open on Thanksgiving and and good for them and good for this
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:59.280]  store manager who even though he had to work on Thanksgiving day he
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:01.920]  donated a hundred dollars of his own money when somebody
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:07.680]  stole the charity kettle yeah it's just absolutely incredible i don't even know
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:11.520]  what else to say this is what the new world order
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:17.040]  wants a bunch of mindless slaves that only think about a few hours in advance
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:20.560]  you know they don't they can't even have the cognitive ability to think and plan
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:23.840]  ahead they are that's why i've called them zombies and i've
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:26.960]  been doing that for years and this is sort of caught on
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:30.560]  it's just that's what they are they're they're almost more dangerous than
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:33.520]  zombies like you said earlier in the show david zombies are more
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:37.200]  docile they're not quite as aggressive as some of these
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:41.600]  i don't even know what to call them anymore demons these is just absolutely
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:46.000]  i you know demonic well mark let me ask you a question your youtube channel i
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:49.120]  forget how many millions how many millions of views does your youtube
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:52.480]  channel have now uh last i checked probably about 40
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:54.960]  million views that's what i thought that's what it's about
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:59.040]  three million views a month well the truth is viral isn't it i mean alex's
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:02.000]  channel has something 200 million micro channels combined probably have
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:05.600]  you know several million it's just ultimately truth is viral we don't you
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:08.080]  think we're winning though at the same time this insanity is going on we're
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:10.720]  actually winning oh it's incredible and i'm very
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:14.000]  blessed you know one of the things that i was i'm very thankful for is the fact
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.920]  that we have such a huge outreach and we have eyes and ears
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:22.320]  all over we have such a great support base with the resistance
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:26.160]  supporting family values supporting the constitution
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:29.360]  and it's incredible i mean sometimes i don't really realize it most of the time
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:33.760]  i don't realize how successful you know widespread my channel is until
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:37.200]  like you say you really look at the numbers and it's it's quite incredible
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:40.640]  and i think you know i'm just a vessel i'm just
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:43.360]  doing what i think is right i'm trying to do it and that's what we're all
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:47.040]  trying to do and it's it's great that so many people are on the same page with
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:50.640]  us and i think the fact that you know my youtube channel is getting
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:54.800]  40 million views three million views a month consistently
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:58.320]  shows that we're not alone in this fight that we're not a small
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:02.640]  minority and i think you can see this year in the coverage because
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:05.600]  many people have seen the black friday and the thursday
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:09.360]  thanksgiving and crouching getting worse every year and so
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:14.080]  yes there is a growing backlash of people like us that are really taking a
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.960]  look at this and saying this is just disgusting this is exactly what
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:20.960]  we have a great metaphor for that on the cover the new infowars magazine just
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:24.480]  came out as dinosaurs running and they've got labels from mainstream media
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:27.680]  and there's this meteor coming down this labeled
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:31.280]  alternative media that's exactly what we're talking about the truth is going
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:34.720]  viral you're a big part of that mark thank you so much for coming on and
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:38.000]  talking to us about your experiences on black friday
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.520]  and hopefully we can wake people up hopefully we can make them understand
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:46.880]  that there's more to life than just consumerism isn't it
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:50.640]  you know it is true family and friends the most important thing and we need to
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:54.400]  just reinforce that and a word of caution to anybody who wants to mimic
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:57.760]  this and try this you must be very careful you're literally dealing with
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:02.000]  angry mobs you you could get seriously injured or killed if you
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.760]  do this without the appropriate safety measures so just a word of caution out
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:07.600]  there and you know thanks everybody hope
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:10.720]  everybody had a great thanksgiving david anthony alex everybody over there at

[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:22.400]  insights to people and i've seen videos where he's done in the past where
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:26.720]  people have actually thrown stuff at him as he's driving by bullhorn
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:29.760]  they don't like to be pointed out that they don't like the fact pointed out
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:33.760]  that they're really kind of standing in line for what's essentially a hoax as
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:37.600]  the wall street journal puts it would you say so anthony all that's exactly
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:41.280]  right they hate exposure we'll be right back
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:50.400]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:08.240]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government
[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:12.640]  did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:17.600]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:22.560]  reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously
[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:26.320]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important

[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.520]  been talking about the zombie consumerism
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:44.080]  the concerns that we all have as we see them doing these knockout games as we
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:48.560]  see people fighting in walmart for these little trinkets from china
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:51.760]  what does that tell us about human nature what does that tell us
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:55.360]  what's going to happen when society begins to fray at the edges or if we
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:58.480]  have some kind of sudden infrastructure collapse
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:02.480]  let's go to randy in oklahoma randy what you want to tell us about your black
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:07.920]  friday experience hi david well hi i'm i'm basically boycotting
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:11.200]  although i may go online and get something there at info wars i'd encourage
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:14.960]  people to do that of course uh...
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:18.480]  there's a there's an app i'm aware of by the way called bycott
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:21.680]  that might be something people could check out
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:25.920]  you'll listen to mark i was the the word idolatry came to mind
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:29.680]  and i think it's just a sign of the desperation of
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:34.800]  the corporate the power structure of how bad thing how how desperate the
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:37.360]  economy is and what what they're trying to
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:41.600]  you'll ring the last bit of money out of the out of the consumers that they
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:45.440]  ring the last bit of effort out of their employees i think it was a really
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:49.600]  important point that mark made about employees being forced to work in this
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:54.320]  pizza manager who let his employees off was fired and then reinstated
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:57.840]  he's the guy who really understands and appreciates his employees i think i
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:00.000]  think that's a that's a very important thing having
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.120]  owned some retail stores for a while understand how important it is
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:07.040]  to keep good employees to keep good morale it really does pay off in the
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:10.960]  long run they're looking at a very short term cycle i think when they
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:13.040]  put these kind of requirements on their employees
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:16.560]  thanks for calling randy i've got alex has called in and he always gets to the
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:18.480]  top of line alex
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:21.680]  that's right i can't help but even when i take off and i'm coming in that's the
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:24.880]  whole i'm thinking about the middle of order i i take off even a day or two i
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:28.160]  feel so good i'm not exhausted if i'm on air i'm looking
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:31.760]  for a great place for making money i had one more point i wanted to make and that
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:35.520]  guy just basically made it it's not that consumer things are bad or
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:38.880]  buying stuff you need is bad or like in a car that runs well with matter like in
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:42.320]  a nice guy it's that if you'll do anything for it and beat
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:46.560]  people up at a store plus it's not even a good deal
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:50.320]  it tells us the same crowd that's looking for a free ride
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:53.760]  uh and you know the point i i heard you talking about mark
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:57.360]  i was ending there in the last segment i know bo wants us coming up with the
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:01.200]  information and the final equation here
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:05.280]  our youtube channel has 340 million videos our other channels are about a
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:07.680]  hundred million views the end of all the other channels
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:12.800]  we have 600 plus million views on youtube now conservatively
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:19.040]  600 million views that's just one outlet that goes we are the dominant media we
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:21.680]  are becoming a dominant media thanks to budget board
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:24.320]  dot com and worldanddaily.com and all the other
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:29.600]  true libertarian patriot media because we understand individualism is freedom
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:34.400]  collectivism in all its form is slavery unless it's volunteer collectivism
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:38.240]  through free association but that's still an individual collective
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:42.320]  to the opposite of a force uh collectivism i just wanted to point out
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:46.960]  that that that people are hungry yes the zombies are dangerous
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:50.880]  yes there's a zombie like but we've got to reach out to them
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:55.600]  and show them how it's really a scam they believe the mainstream media that
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:59.040]  that's the best deals are then but that's not even true but in the mainstream
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:03.040]  media is being forced to now report the truth so
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:06.320]  they don't want to sell the streets they don't want churches handing out food
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:09.600]  in austin they won't let you give homeless people food they've passed
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:13.680]  type of regulations where only their controlled systems could hold up
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:16.640]  society when it collapses because the collapse
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:20.400]  used their takeover system the average cop doesn't know that you never be
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:23.440]  regretted on that we need to reach out to them
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:26.880]  they care about their children they care about the future so that's what i
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:30.320]  called in about was just to send the record straight we reached 15 million
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:34.480]  people awake one way or the other and even in the game youtube world
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:38.400]  600 plus million huge 340 million on one channel
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:41.760]  it's unbelievable and just continue on i know full oxygen

[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:19.200]  through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:22.160]  belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:26.720]  if you've got a business that you didn't build that somebody else

[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:44.960]  live from the info wars dot com studios
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:48.320]  it's alex jones
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:58.320]  you
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:01.760]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex and i'm
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:06.160]  joined here in the studio with anthony gucciardi and we've been talking about
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:08.960]  black friday what that tells us about society
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:11.760]  we've got paul joseph watson who's joining us
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:15.200]  right now after we talked to anthony a little bit more but anthony i wanted to
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:20.080]  give you one last moment here to tell us give us your take on what's going on
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:24.080]  i think the reality here is short and sweet if the people that are so
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:28.400]  rabidly outside just adrenaline pumping through their veins at a
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:31.840]  primal level to get a piece of plastic main china
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:35.680]  if those same people the thousands hundreds of thousands maybe across the
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:39.360]  country lining up outside at five a.m those same people
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:43.440]  would take one percent of that drive and put it towards the fight for liberty
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:47.280]  yes towards the fight for independence the constitution the fight for reality
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:51.200]  we would win tomorrow period if those same people would join us
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:54.960]  and come together and realize those plastic material items
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:59.200]  they're worthless and like alex said it's not bad to drive a nice car or you
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:02.960]  know want some material items you know when you have the capacity to
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:05.920]  purchase them and help other people with your funds everything as well
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:10.560]  but if you're frothing over them outside at two a.m waiting to save
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:13.840]  fifty dollars when you're actually spending two hundred dollars more on a tv
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:18.320]  that's right that energy needs to be converted it needs to be completely
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:21.840]  you know trans transferred into a powerful
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:25.120]  decision that you're going to fight for liberty and for freedom and we will win
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:28.400]  if we can get those people and i think those people sure they are zombies they
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:32.640]  are diluted but at the same time we can recapture their spirit and we can drive
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:36.800]  them towards understanding and join our side in the fight against
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:40.240]  corruption and tyranny and deception that's right it's not
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:43.680]  money that's root of all evil that's often misquoted out of the bible it's the
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:47.280]  love of money that's root of all evil and if we can get these people to
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.600]  understand and love their family and liberty those issues understand where
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:55.360]  they are the dangers in front of them i think you'll find them joining people
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:59.200]  standing in the cold rain fighting for the first amendment
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:02.960]  like you and so the rest of the info wars crew and alex jones were doing
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:07.840]  just a week ago and dallas is amazing how much has happened in just a week
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:11.600]  but a small committed group of people is always a thing
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:15.840]  that changes society because that small committed group of people
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:19.280]  always pulls in a larger group of people i think that's
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:22.480]  exactly what we're hoping to see here and what we're starting to see with the
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:26.240]  mainstream media being replaced by a more authentic media like the cover of
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:30.080]  the info wars magazine with these dinosaur media
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:33.840]  looking up and seeing this meteor coming in that's that's the real media the
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:35.840]  real truth that's going viral with people
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:39.840]  that's exactly right the new media is coming the dinosaur media is trying to
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:42.480]  cloak itself and become the new media they're failing
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:46.960]  bloomberg i always use this example look to bloomberg they are the perfect prime
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:50.480]  beta example of how they are trying to be alternative news talking about the big
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:53.840]  banks and how bad they are you know then we see actually cbs coming out with
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:56.320]  some good pieces actually cbs came out with this piece that we
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:59.440]  covered on story league about how homeless people aren't allowed to eat
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:02.800]  thanksgiving in public parks from churchgoers who are trying to help them
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:06.800]  yeah yeah we've seen that from fox in the past but then fox will go in and
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:09.760]  shut down or marginalize the more libertarian
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:13.760]  hosts like judge napolitano or others though
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:17.040]  they'll pull them in they'll get the audience hooked thank oh yeah these guys
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:20.240]  are kind of on the same line and then they'll move them away yeah exactly right
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:24.080]  they need that audience or they will actually have zero viewership i mean
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:27.120]  less than 20 according to gallup polls actually trust them
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:30.560]  but fox actually has the highest trust ratings that's because they do throw in
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:33.840]  some scraps you know they throw in some real news and stuff but so does so do
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:36.960]  most of those channels besides you know completely worth those channels like
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:40.640]  msnbc i mean a lot of the mainstream news now is fusing
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:43.760]  in this alternative spin on a lot of it because they know they have to just
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:47.040]  survive yes yes it's it's just like someone someone
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:50.960]  dying you know of an infection they need the antibiotics
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:53.840]  and instead of taking the whole the whole bottle as you know as directed by the
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:56.720]  doctor they're just taking some antibiotics here and there
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:00.080]  taking away some of the infection you know that is the complete establishment
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:03.840]  control of the mainstream media but ultimately they'll never get rid of it
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:07.840]  unless we also force them to and become our own media you're absolutely right
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:11.200]  well thank you anthony for coming in on this black friday and giving up your
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:14.640]  spot in line at walmart i really appreciate the sacrifice well you know
[02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:18.560]  i was there all night and i just decided to come in and fight for
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:21.600]  for freedom instead at the last minute you just gave it up and came in and
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:24.560]  talked to us thank you so much for coming in we've got paul joseph watching on the
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:27.440]  line from the uk paul do you have anything like
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:33.040]  black friday in the uk i know this looks bizarre to you it looks bizarre to us
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:37.120]  well one of the things that you know i noted in previous years was the fact
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:41.040]  that this was an american tradition that it wasn't we weren't seeing
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:44.880]  similar rabid scenes of rampaging hordes in europe
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:47.600]  but actually there's there are articles out today
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:51.040]  where indeed it has been imported into the uk
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:55.360]  oh no while it's not as aggressive and
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:58.480]  rabid and zombie like as it is in america
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:02.640]  the trend is crossing the uh the atlantic ocean so yes it is being
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:05.840]  imported now into britain as most american culture
[02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:09.920]  cultural icons are give it give it time the kind of black friday madness will
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:14.640]  start metastasizing all over the uk just like mcdonald's and burger kings right
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:18.720]  well we had we had the uber black friday a couple years ago with the mass riots of
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:22.320]  everybody trashing shopping malls and stealing things so
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:25.840]  you know we're doing it on a professional level i thought the video you
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:29.040]  did was great i looking at these alternating clips
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:32.640]  between zombie movies and shoppers and walmart
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:35.920]  i think i would take my chances with the zombies
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:39.440]  well they're slower moving aren't they they're not as aggressive as uh
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:43.040]  george aramero's undead but the funny thing about that video
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:47.280]  was um you know it's a two-minute video i spliced together about
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:51.200]  20 different clips almost half of which were
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:55.360]  you know short clips from dawn of the dead the dystopian classic
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:59.600]  yeah well after i rendered the video and uploaded it to youtube
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:04.480]  there's actually a sequence between a clip of black friday shoppers
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:08.320]  being let into a store rushing the gates and being let into a store
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:12.400]  and then it cuts to another overhead clip of a similar scene of
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:16.560]  uh people rushing into a store as the barricades are lifted
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:20.240]  i don't actually know i forgot if that is actually from
[02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:25.200]  dawn of the dead or from black friday shoppers i don't know
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:29.840]  where it comes from because the line was between reality and
[02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:34.000]  exactly movies right but i was genuinely baffled i was thinking is that
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.800]  is that black friday or is that dawn of the dead because i genuinely forgot
[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:42.480]  so i mean that's how that's how scary it is but as i mentioned at the end of the
[02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:45.120]  video you know if this is how americans behave over
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:48.720]  electronic goods which they don't really need and they can't afford
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:51.840]  how will they react when the food runs out because
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:56.080]  what you're seeing in these videos psychologically speaking is how people
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:01.200]  behave when they perceive scarcity so you know imagine
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:04.160]  it's not hd televisions they're fighting over but food in a
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:07.520]  bread line you know it's going to get pretty rough which is a very good
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:11.440]  argument for storable food yeah in this case it's just like you
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:15.040]  mentioned in this case it's just perception and what does this tell us
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:18.080]  when that perception turns into reality when
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:21.600]  people are genuinely hungry and they really have to have something whether
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:25.520]  it's food or whether it's health care it's going to turn from this kind of
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:29.040]  scene into a kind of cannibalism that we've seen over and over again
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:32.640]  in the soviet union or in china other places where
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:36.400]  a kind of socialism has descended and they've shut down the
[02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:40.320]  the system either intentionally or just out of total incompetence and we see
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:45.280]  people very quickly having to turn on each other to survive
[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:48.480]  exactly and you mentioned socialism communism
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:52.080]  i see these black friday scenes as another argument against
[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:56.480]  collectivism you know the bigger the crowd the bigger the social group
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:59.360]  the more selfish and brutal it appears to become
[02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:02.560]  so whereas the argument you know with collectivism is for the great to good
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:05.840]  everybody bands together you know we treat each other the same
[02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:09.920]  we take care of everybody as these scenes show in america
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:13.600]  the opposite happens people become more brutal and selfish
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:17.120]  you know the strong men rule the weak suffer so whereas
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:21.360]  a society based on individualism which is based on a moral foundation of
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:25.120]  protecting everybody's rights and having true equality
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:30.080]  would you know resemble a more free more fair society
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:35.360]  more caring for other people this to me represents collectivism it's selfish
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:39.200]  the bigger the crowd gets the more selfish they get which is
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:43.840]  from the social psychology angle extraordinary popular delusions and
[02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:46.240]  the madness of crowds it all goes back to that
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:50.800]  oh yeah absolutely and what you see is combine this with these knockout games
[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:53.920]  that are happening here you see a total devaluation
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:57.760]  a total disrespect for other people as people and you see this
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:01.120]  shopping that's going on on thursdays i see a breakdown of the family will be
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:04.240]  right back 50 years iodine has been phased out of
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:07.040]  our staple foods and replaced with the halogen
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:11.600]  bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world
[02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:14.480]  guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:18.960]  ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:22.960]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:26.960]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:32.320]  are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had
[02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:36.640]  previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important
[02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:42.160]  unbound clean in a glycerin base nascent iodine was the answer for myself

[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:18.560]  friday after thanksgiving and i'm talking to paul joseph
[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:22.320]  watson of info wars dot com and prisonplanet.com
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:27.200]  and he did a video earlier today about the contrast between
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:31.040]  walmart craziness and violence in the shopping centers
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:33.840]  and contrasted that to zombies you know paul
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:38.800]  we had also a tradition here in america that unfortunately we see being
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:43.360]  gobbled up with this black friday and that's thanksgiving that was a time
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:47.520]  that was that was also a period of time that was kind of unique to the united
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:50.640]  states you don't have black friday in uk as you mentioned it's starting to come
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:53.280]  in but with thanksgiving it was really
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:56.480]  a nice thing that we had here in america it was a time that
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:24:59.600]  families reflected on what they meant to each other
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:03.760]  what had been happened in the last year what god had done in their lives the
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:07.120]  blessings that they had had and it was a time that was kind of rooted in a
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:11.920]  remembrance of a real hardship that the first settlers from europe
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:15.120]  who came to this country experienced when they came here a time of
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:19.360]  starvation and privation and how they pulled themselves out of that that
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:22.720]  seems to be being eclipsed now by this more shallow
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:27.440]  consumerism that's being pushed on us by the big box retailers
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:31.040]  well if you actually read the motivation behind some of these people who
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:35.120]  engage in this behavior they will justify it by saying
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:39.760]  that time that shopping time is time spent with their loved ones
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:43.840]  and they've actually grouped themselves together into a kind of hunger game style
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:48.320]  team and they treat this as a competition this rabid mad dash to get
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:51.920]  products off shelves they treat it as a sport
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:54.880]  that's what they say in the interviews that i read today
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:59.840]  and of course the the motivation to get a deal is complete bonkin because
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:03.760]  you know they mark the prices of months before black friday anyway so then the
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:06.960]  discount seem more value than they actually are
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:11.120]  the 98 percent markup on the other products that the shoppers buy while
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:13.680]  they're in there compensates for it for the big
[02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:18.800]  retailers so they actually make larger profits profit margins during the holiday
[02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:21.760]  season proving that you know the idea that they're losing
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:25.120]  big on giving all these massive discounts is a complete hoax
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:29.360]  so that's not the motivation really now that people engage in this black friday
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:33.040]  zombie madness it's it's a sport it's a competition
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:36.960]  it's a hunger style hunger game style bread and circus
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:41.040]  and you know it's the it's the acquisition of physical objects
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:46.000]  otherwise known as retail therapy which is another mechanism through which people
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:49.520]  drown out the nagging voice of conscience and the
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:52.720]  hopelessness in many cases of their real lives
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:56.560]  they're trying to tune out of reality yeah alex was just talking about that
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:00.400]  earlier this week he was out earlier this week and
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:04.320]  dripping springs and he was hiking through the wilderness and he talked to
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:07.360]  people and they said you know we like what you have to say we grew what you
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:10.720]  say but it's just so depressing we can hardly listen to it and he was making
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:14.880]  the case that you know reality is what it is you need to
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:19.120]  face it and then do something positive about it you're not going to
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:23.200]  feel any better by just ignoring this until it comes crashing down on you and
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:26.800]  the consequences of ignoring the problems just continually
[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:30.000]  build until everything implodes on you that's what we're
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:33.520]  telling people but as you're pointing out people like to just ignore that they'd
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:37.040]  like to look at the happy news is being presented by the media they'd like to
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:41.760]  not look too carefully at the clouds on the horizon
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:46.080]  well again it's hoax i mean knowledge is power but it's also happiness
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:49.600]  i find the more knowledge i acquire the happier i get i mean
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:53.920]  in terms of consumerism you know 10 years ago when i first
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:58.960]  got my first decent paycheck yes i would buy items that i didn't need didn't
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:03.120]  really want just because i could but i find i don't know about you david but
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:07.440]  as you mature more spiritually our objects actually
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:12.560]  repel you the more physical objects you acquire the more weighed down you feel
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:16.400]  that's right and you you start moving towards a kind of minimalist thing where
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:20.000]  the less objects around you the happier you are so it you know you flip the
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.680]  complete other way yeah it is it is actually a burden
[02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:27.440]  that you start to feel i i i couldn't put it any better than that
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:31.680]  i realized that when we started moving here from north carolina how many things
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:34.320]  just started accumulating over the decades and
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:38.400]  you just want to get rid of these these uh millstones around your neck is what
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:42.480]  they feel like and that's just materialism what you what you really value
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:46.320]  is the connections with other people and that's what i see being lost
[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:49.440]  and not only this consumerism but also in these
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:53.520]  knockout games because in the past we were seeing this kind of violence on
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:57.600]  in walmart on black friday but now it's coming out we're just for this year
[02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:00.560]  fun of it as you mentioned that they've turned black friday into a kind of a
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:05.200]  hunger gains game while they're turning brutalizing other people into a game
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:10.960]  there's absolutely no feeling for other human beings
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:15.120]  and again again that relates back to uh social media where
[02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:19.680]  like video games you know there's no requirement to see other people to treat
[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:22.800]  them as equal human beings like in social media
[02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:26.880]  um and then of course you happy slapping in the uk which is what
[02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:30.480]  you know the knockout game is in america and again it's all about narcissism
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:34.080]  getting your videos on youtube getting them on social media that all feeds into
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:36.640]  it wow wow that's amazing we're talking to paul

[02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:05.520]  i want to get his comments on black friday and we can talk about that and
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:09.520]  then we're going to talk a little bit about the killer robot campaign that

[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:18.400]  to tell us about black friday how are you sir
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:23.040]  you're fine uh you know first of all i i'm boycotting
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:26.480]  black friday and i just urge everybody else to do so
[02:34:26.480 --> 02:34:32.320]  um you know i spent last night i stumbled onto something um a long
[02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:38.480]  really a whole book online called uh the the nazi hydra in america
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:42.080]  and it breaks down so much of what you guys talk about
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:45.440]  um it's frightening um you know this gets into
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:50.960]  four generations of the bush clan uh totally tied with nazis uh alan
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:54.480]  dullis had a cia fired by kennedy total nazi
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:58.000]  john j mccloy who i have not heard you guys talk about
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.920]  um maybe you have before but this is a man who
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:06.480]  this is this the guy who made sure that the trains to the death camps
[02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:11.600]  were not bombed he's the guy who oversaw the internment camps the japanese
[02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:16.000]  he's a guy put in charge of post war germany and let
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:19.600]  all the mass murdering head nazis right out of prison
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:23.760]  and he was put on the war in commission okay the fix was in
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:27.520]  this is a guy who was the head of the world bank he was the head of the cfr
[02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:31.360]  he's considered one of the great wise men of uh foreign policy
[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:36.080]  um and he's one of the biggest scumbags uh in american history
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:42.080]  i spent four uh a degree from major very well-renowned university
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:46.720]  which i won't name right now uh and i studied foreign policy i study
[02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:51.600]  government and politics and not once was this man's name other than
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:56.400]  briefly impacting to never come up and it's just like a
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:00.160]  glass of cold water throwing your face when you wake up to some of this material
[02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:04.160]  i mean you know again there's absolutely carol else it did post war post war
[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:07.840]  one germany the press economy uh putting the
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:12.320]  fluoride in the water just like the nazi did uh basically controlling
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:16.000]  all american media back in the day was totally pro-nazii leading up to
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:19.760]  and all the way oh yeah there were a lot of there were a lot of financial ties
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:22.640]  with bush family the patriarch presscott bush and of course
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:26.160]  there are a lot of books that talk about this one of the ones that i thought
[02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:29.680]  was really very interesting about operation paperclip was a terrible
[02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:33.760]  mistake it was about the death of frank olson and he was a scientist who
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:40.000]  worked for the biological and chemical research departments of the cia and it
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:44.160]  was interesting very very well researched very factual book
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:47.520]  based on recently declassified documents that were
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:51.760]  classified for 50 60 years breaks down in that book
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:55.760]  the story of what happens to the scientist who went along with all this
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:58.880]  criminal activity and that's what we're trying to tell people over and over again
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:03.520]  to the policemen who stand there a week ago pushing back people about
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:06.880]  free speech protests were saying this is the world that you're creating
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:10.160]  you're going to have to live in this and they're going to turn on you don't
[02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:12.160]  think that you're getting a pass from all of this
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:14.400]  you're going to be one of the ones that they turn against just like they turned
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:18.240]  against the scientist frank olson and also in part of that book they
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:21.280]  pointed out how these nazi scientists these
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:24.880]  japanese scientists who had been involved in war crimes
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:28.400]  how they were brought to the u.s they were given very high level positions
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:32.240]  in the research departments but i think you made a good point there thank you so
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:35.920]  much for calling in for hanging on for such a long time mark in dc
[02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:39.120]  i think the point he was making too at the beginning there paul was about
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:44.320]  boycotting not just black friday but especially boycotting what's going on
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:48.560]  on thanksgiving if you don't show up they're not going to make the employees
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:52.320]  leave their families to go work on those days are they
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:56.640]  well that's right and there's actually a growing backlash the bbc did a report on
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:38:00.160]  it today against black friday they've got a boycott
[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:03.040]  day which is the buy nothing day i believe it's cool
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:08.480]  and also trending on twitter hashtag black friday body count actually
[02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:14.080]  numerous injuries last night and today because four people have died since 2006
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:17.360]  shooting stabbings everything going on today but
[02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:20.880]  even the bbc is now reporting that there's a massive backlash against it so
[02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:23.840]  hopefully there's the kind of scenes that we've
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:27.520]  witnessed are on the wane well let's shift gears a little bit now
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:32.000]  you know a week ago it was just a week ago that alex and crew were in dallas
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.480]  doing a free speech protest because the city government had shut down
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:40.000]  any demonstrations did not allow people like
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:43.920]  jim tagg who had been one of the people that was shot on that fateful day
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:48.480]  would not allow him in because he did not carry he did not uphold to the
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:52.320]  official story about what happened that day so alex and crew went up there to
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:56.560]  protest this restriction of free speech and you and i were not there but i know
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:39:00.960]  you were watching i was watching as we saw the police come out
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:05.120]  and push back on the demonstrators they were led into this area by other police
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:08.880]  and then the federal police the sheriffs who were coming out of
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:12.000]  homeland security trailer just came out and started
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:15.520]  immediately hitting punching people shoving them
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:19.520]  as i looked at that i was thinking about how robotic
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:23.040]  they looked and how dangerous they looked when they stood there in line the
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:26.640]  contempt on these people's face but there's a real concern
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:30.640]  about killer robots we talked on uh tuesday
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:33.760]  to noel scharke actually it was wednesday we talked to noel scharke
[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:38.240]  about the campaign to stop killer robots i know that uh he's in the uk you've
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:42.080]  been following him you did an article on that interview that got picked up by
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:46.000]  the drudge report and he had an amazing revelation there that you use as a
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:49.360]  headline and that is he fully expected to see robots used
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:54.880]  for crowd control armed with tasers well that's right i mean it's coming
[02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:57.680]  sooner than you think but he actually did a report
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:02.320]  a few months ago now called 2084 big robot is watching you
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:05.680]  and scharke predicted that within the next 30 years
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:11.200]  quote humanoid walking robots would be more in use for crowd control at games
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:15.600]  strikes and riots robots will patrol city centers and trouble spots
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:19.760]  where fights are likely to break out so there he's talking about them being
[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:23.920]  armed with tasers already i did a video report back in
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:28.720]  april about some technology out of zurek university which they said
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:33.200]  would be used for homeland security purposes and even the inventor of that
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:38.000]  drone technology said it could be used to quote abuse humans
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.560]  and that was a network of could be yeah and that was that was the creator of
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:46.560]  the technology but it was basically a network of drones that carried
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:52.320]  nets and they said it could be used to snatch suspects off the streets
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:55.680]  so they're talking about that already they've got rudimentary drones that
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:58.720]  already do that they're quite small at the moment
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:02.160]  but they're going to ramp it up this is really horrific stuff that we're
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:05.760]  looking at when i look at this when we saw the trailer for the
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:10.080]  movie elysium that's exactly what we saw we saw these brutal robots
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:14.400]  just smacking people who are standing in line used for crowd control law
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:17.360]  enforcement i had high hopes for that movie it turned out
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:21.200]  to be a very cheap analogy to for obama care and illegal
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:24.320]  immigration it didn't really seem to address that but that was a very
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:28.240]  powerful scene that was in the trailer it's something that i think
[02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:32.240]  people should be very concerned about and he's going around and talking to the
[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:35.600]  un and talking to the government's raising awareness of the public
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:40.160]  raising awareness and the press but i want to see more awareness raised of
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:43.120]  the scientists who are creating these things just like i was talking about
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:47.040]  frank olson and the past segment you know when when you're a scientist and
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:50.880]  you're doing something or an engineer it's not just enough to tackle something
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:54.080]  because it's an intellectual problem that you can solve you need to think
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:58.720]  about how it's going to be used the ethical consequences of it
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:01.920]  well the vast majority of this technology is being developed by
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:06.240]  DARPA which of course is the pentagon and people like sharky and others have
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:09.520]  said that these robots are going to be used to kill people
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:14.320]  that's their ultimate you know application and DARPA has even admitted
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:17.760]  that in in several different instances they're now starting to roll them out
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:21.680]  on the battlefield but initially it's going to be
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:26.640]  about as you said robots checking IDs at checkpoints
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:31.120]  alerting authorities if necessary to suspects and you know anyone can be a
[02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:35.680]  suspect now and in fact you mentioned elysium the new robo cop film
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:39.280]  actually depicts robots patrolling the streets of iraq
[02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:43.200]  yes biometrically scanning citizens faces
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:47.120]  against the database and one of the plot lines of the films is
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:50.720]  americans are robo phobic they won't accept this
[02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:54.960]  that's right and of course that was being in the film that was being driven by
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:58.560]  the military industrial complex or we could say the police state
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:03.200]  industrial complex now the same people that have been creating these weapons
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:07.920]  of war that have kept the united states at war continuously for the last 60
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:12.880]  years those same large corporations are looking for increased
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:15.840]  profits they're never satisfied they always want
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:20.480]  as rock a fella said just a little more and the way they're going to get that is
[02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:24.240]  to create this police state industrial complex
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:27.680]  sell the weapons are already bringing the weapons home from iraq and afghanistan
[02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:31.760]  but they want to create new crowd control weapons as they call them
[02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:36.240]  non-lethal weapons but they're not leaf they're not non-lethal at all we see
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:39.840]  people dying from tasers all the time
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:43.200]  well precisely and i think the point is about
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:47.840]  handing that power over to robots is by making them autonomous
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:52.800]  you remove the responsibility for death or injury if it was the robots decision
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:55.680]  to go ahead and taser somebody who ended up dying
[02:43:55.680 --> 02:43:59.120]  then they're not going to fear for legal legal retribution are they and
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:01.920]  there's going to be no chain of responsibility behind that
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:06.080]  yes so that's one of the benefits for law enforcement authorities
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:10.960]  but the key point is you know we already have flying robots killing people
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:14.240]  all over the world they're called predator drones
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:19.680]  they kill 50 innocent civilians for every suspected terrorist they take out
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:23.280]  so to think of this as some way off in the future thing is
[02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:27.680]  naive because it's already happening yes way up if you want to get way into
[02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:33.280]  the future then even the co-founder of skype wrote that the
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:38.320]  eventual progression of robots will be about them taking over quote the
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:41.760]  speed and direction of technological progress itself
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:46.080]  and actually shaping the environment of planet earth to their own ends
[02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:50.080]  so once these robots get some kind of sentient intelligence
[02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:54.800]  and under their own auspices have a survival mechanism
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:57.680]  then you're going to find that they shape their environment for their own
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:01.840]  purposes and as the co-founder co-founder of skype said
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:05.120]  we're just going to be you know a bug on the windscreen
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:09.120]  to them they don't they don't care about us so that's where it's going in the
[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:12.240]  future that's where people like ray Kurzweil have said that it's
[02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:14.960]  heading and when ray Kurzweil looked at the
[02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:20.480]  Atlas robot that DARPA funded his comments were oh that's great now all
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:23.360]  it needs is a brain i'm looking at this thing and i'm saying do we want to give
[02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:27.040]  that kind of monopoly of force to a few people in
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:30.080]  government because that's what's happening with these drone strikes it's a
[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:34.400]  a few people that can remotely control a tremendous
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:37.360]  amount of force it gives a tremendous amount of leverage
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:41.280]  to the government to the police department to use against people
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:45.120]  it's a very disturbing trend and in my opinion and we need to get people to
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:49.200]  understand just how imminent and how dangerous this is
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:53.040]  there it seems like science fiction to so many people and yet we can see these
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:55.760]  robots that are being built by Boston Dynamics
[02:45:55.760 --> 02:45:59.920]  and i find them to be very frightening because i can see
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:03.680]  the potential for abuse because we already see that technology being
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:07.200]  abused as you mentioned with the drone strikes
[02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:12.080]  exactly i think ultimately it's about the total obliteration of human liberty
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:16.240]  on an industrial mechanized scale exactly that's what it's ultimately about
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:20.400]  because once you give these robots power of sentient
[02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:23.920]  awareness and the power to act on their own accord
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:27.040]  they're just going to kill people because they're in their own interest to do so
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:31.360]  if they're in a battlefield mode they're being developed by DARPA the pentagon
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:36.320]  and the pentagon's actually developed a device that thinks and looks like a
[02:46:36.320 --> 02:46:40.640]  human brain which they plan to install in these robots so they
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:44.320]  can navigate completely of their own accord and they can learn as they
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:47.920]  progress through their environment so they've already got brains human like
[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:51.920]  brains developed synthetic brains which they plan to put into these robots
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:56.320]  so it's it's frightening where it's going but you mentioned Kurzweil again
[02:46:56.320 --> 02:47:00.640]  you know the trendy transhumanists all seem to worship him
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:06.960]  as this icon of the technological singularity but if you actually read
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:10.320]  his book which i don't think many of them have from cover to cover
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:15.280]  the age of spiritual machines his lust for you know robotics and
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:18.640]  transhumanism it comes across to me as some kind of
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:23.600]  creepy sexual fetish if you actually get to the end of the book
[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:28.880]  he talks about a woman leaving her husband for a computer
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:33.280]  uploading her own intelligence into the computer so that she can then have sex
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:36.320]  with the computer and then at the end of the book
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:39.760]  Kurzweil joins in as a kind of threesome
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:44.880]  it's completely creepy i think his whole thing is based on some weird
[02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:49.040]  sexual fetish i mean well he also thinks that he's going to live
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:52.000]  forever you know that's the original life from the garden of Eden that you'll
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.720]  become like god he really does think he's going to become like god
[02:47:54.720 --> 02:48:00.160]  even if he could transfer his mental processes and make a copy of his
[02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:03.600]  brain essentially and and put it in a robotic thing that's still not him
[02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:06.080]  that's just a copy of him he's still going to die
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:09.680]  he doesn't want to come to the grips with that fact and so he
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:14.160]  is working towards this this crazy invention that he's got but it's also
[02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:17.360]  very disturbing because we realize where this is headed
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:20.880]  we realize how dangerous this is and we realize that even though
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:24.800]  he's not going to be able to really transfer himself into a robot
[02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:28.400]  these people could kill an awful lot of people it's just like the artileque
[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:30.800]  wars i don't know if you've seen that book or not where the guy's talking
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:34.240]  about giga death between people who are pushing this
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:37.920]  artificial intelligence and the people who are trying to push back against it
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:42.320]  people that he calls the Terrans and he predicts that that's going
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:45.520]  the author of that book predicts that that's going to happen
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:48.800]  and that we're going to have billions of people die it's going to be one of the
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:52.000]  most horrific periods of human history but they
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.440]  think they're going to win they think the artileques will win they think the
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:49:00.320]  transcendent transhumanist singularity people are going to win
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:04.960]  i think a lot of it david is the fact that Kurzweil especially is just a very
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:08.720]  insecure individual who has a massive fear of death
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:13.360]  and this is how he compensates for it yes yes exactly that's how it comes across
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:15.840]  to me and he has a lot of financial resources
[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:20.000]  behind him now being chief scientist for google so there's a lot of money
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:24.320]  behind it i mean google is is funding this race to the moon
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:29.520]  uh i think it ends december 31st 2015 somebody can get to the moon they can
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:32.480]  fly or travel across its surface a certain distance
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:36.080]  make a couple of broadcasts or whatever there's a large prize involved in that
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:40.400]  google has so much money that they can fund these
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:43.520]  development projects now there's nothing harmful with the moon
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:48.400]  launch but some of this other stuff even taking away our ability to drive our
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:52.880]  own cars that's where the google self-driving cars are headed
[02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:56.160]  you're going to find people that are going to be priced out in the insurance
[02:49:56.160 --> 02:49:59.120]  market the compulsory insurance market that we have here in the united states
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:01.920]  if you want to drive your own car i'm sure that's going to be at a premium
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:05.760]  because of course the cars can do it so much more safely than you'll be able
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:09.680]  to do it they're going to basically shut us down and control our movements
[02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:13.600]  in their entirety with that well that that's what reno
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:16.960]  recently announced with their electric cars you're going to rent the battery
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:20.400]  off them and they can shut it down at any point so it's outside of you
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:24.720]  control again in a car in 2013 you're basically sitting
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:27.360]  inside a computer not a vehicle and that's only going to get more
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:30.880]  sophisticated but with google i mean google is
[02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:34.720]  skynet they're creating an artificial reality which people are going to be
[02:50:34.720 --> 02:50:38.560]  able to insert themselves into and live an alternative life they're
[02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:41.680]  behind all of this stuff there's not enough flights in the majority of

[02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:54.160]  let's talk about what's going on in china right now

[02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:14.800]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this friday after
[02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:18.240]  thanksgiving i'm talking to paul joseph watson in the uk
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:22.320]  and paul and i were just talking about dr noel scharke's campaign to stop
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:26.240]  killer robots and when he was on two days ago he was talking about the rapid
[02:54:26.240 --> 02:54:31.200]  development of technology in unmanned aerial vehicles that are
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:35.040]  fighter jets traveling at supersonic speeds taking off
[02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:39.200]  and landing on aircraft carriers the amazing advances that are being made in
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:43.040]  that and as we're looking at that paul i'm thinking about how easy it's going to
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:47.440]  be for governments to get into a war when they
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:50.240]  feel like they don't have as much to lose if they're just going to lose an
[02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:53.760]  unmanned aerial vehicle but eventually as dr scharke
[02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:57.760]  pointed out it's going to come down to people dying isn't it
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:01.200]  well exactly because you know you're going to have humanitarian concerns that
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:04.960]  are caused by any war but yeah they eventually plan to roll out huge
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:08.720]  battlefield armies of robots to fight each other under that
[02:55:08.720 --> 02:55:11.920]  justification that humans won't be slaughtered in the
[02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:16.480]  process if you believe that wars can be fought without humans dying then i
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:20.240]  think you're very much naive yeah and eventually one side of robots is going
[02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:23.040]  to start killing humans at least one side of those robots
[02:55:23.040 --> 02:55:26.720]  now what's happening with china now we see there's this map pull up this map
[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:28.560]  guys for the viewers that are looking at it
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:34.960]  on cnn we see these multiple overlapping claims of territory that are
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:40.320]  conflicts between taiwan and china and south korea and japan and what we see
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:43.600]  here really is kind of a looks like a venn diagram but it's really a venn
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:47.440]  diagram for war it's amazing to look at these aerial
[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:51.120]  shots of these islands and you don't see anything on them but we've seen people
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:54.720]  go to war for lesser things haven't we paul
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:58.240]  well world war one started with the assassination of a
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:01.920]  relatively obscure arch duke in sarri ava that's right
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:06.000]  you know having normalcy bias in thinking this can't happen to our generation
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.240]  that's right it's short-sighted but this is about obviously the senkaku islands
[02:56:10.240 --> 02:56:14.880]  the east china sea china set up this air defense zone which by the way
[02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:19.760]  japan us and russia have had for decades over their own territories but
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:24.800]  apparently china's not allowed to do that immediately almost immediately the
[02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:29.840]  us sent in two b 52 bombers in a in an astounding provocation
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:33.360]  this was all while americans are fighting over xboxes by the way
[02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:37.760]  literally sliding into world war three but ambrose evans pritchard who is with
[02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:42.240]  the telegraph you know he's no tin foil hat wearing lunatic said
[02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:46.240]  quote we are clearly sliding into a new cold war
[02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:49.600]  one misjudgment by either side could change our world entirely
[02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:54.960]  so now you've got japan south korea flying their war planes into this zone
[02:56:54.960 --> 02:56:58.800]  now you've got military professors in china saying that
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:04.560]  if they keep doing this provocation quote china will be forced to respond
[02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:09.600]  and they issued a veiled threat last weekend that they would shoot down
[02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:13.840]  planes entering this region so initially of
[02:57:13.840 --> 02:57:17.280]  course they did nothing people said oh it's just china being a paper tiger
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:20.720]  again but they've since issued statements saying that they will take
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:23.920]  military action if these provocations keep occurring
[02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:28.640]  and imagine if china scrambled war planes off the coast of america
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:32.560]  what the freak out response would be and yet this is happening
[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:36.640]  now on an almost daily basis where the u.s south korea japan
[02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:41.520]  flies through this air zone taunting china with threats to shoot down the
[02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:44.720]  aircraft and you know it's it's bubbling under the
[02:57:44.720 --> 02:57:47.040]  surface it's not a massive story yet but
[02:57:47.040 --> 02:57:50.080]  mainstream commentators are even saying that it could
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:54.800]  spark a new world war yes i've seen people
[02:57:54.800 --> 02:57:58.480]  make the comparison to them in road doctrine with what's going on in asia
[02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:01.440]  that as you mentioned what would we do if china was
[02:58:01.440 --> 02:58:04.320]  doing flights and asserting territorial influence
[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:07.840]  just off the coast of the u.s or even off the coast of
[02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:11.120]  south america we've seen the cuban missile crisis in the past
[02:58:11.120 --> 02:58:15.520]  but at the same time china is really pushing it as a very dangerous
[02:58:15.520 --> 02:58:18.960]  situation and as you pointed out though we're just really concerned about where
[02:58:18.960 --> 02:58:23.280]  we're going to get our next video game fix or where we can find a big screen
[02:58:23.280 --> 02:58:26.480]  tv to pacify us for a little bit more time
[02:58:26.480 --> 02:58:30.400]  well thanks for joining us on this friday after thanksgiving paul i really
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:34.080]  appreciate it and very very helpful insights we're going to be back
[02:58:34.080 --> 02:59:02.560]  on sunday at four p.m. with alex jones that's four p.m. central five p.m. eastern
