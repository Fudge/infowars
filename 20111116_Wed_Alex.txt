[00:00.000 --> 00:12.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.640 --> 00:30.880]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:30.880 --> 00:37.680]  we are live it is a worldwide transmission it is wednesday the sixteenth day of november

[00:44.960 --> 00:53.360]  got a big breaking report coming out at info wars.com in the next few minutes gerald solente's
[00:53.360 --> 00:58.720]  gold account was emptied out over one hundred thousand dollars he's just saying over six figures
[00:58.720 --> 01:04.800]  he doesn't want to say how much over a hundred thousand dollars it was and and watson's article
[01:04.800 --> 01:12.640]  just went live seconds ago mf global looted customers accounts via internal bank run this
[01:12.640 --> 01:17.040]  was getting almost no attention in the last few days they were just talking about its bankruptcy
[01:17.040 --> 01:22.320]  because it has the former new jersey governor corezine running it it's tied all into the globalist
[01:22.320 --> 01:26.640]  it's a front group for goldman sacks that's admitted here in all the articles but it isn't
[01:26.640 --> 01:33.600]  just gerald solente's gold account that was his private segregated account no they looted their
[01:33.600 --> 01:41.040]  customers regular cash accounts and the neocons are spending it that's free market to lose your
[01:41.040 --> 01:48.240]  money no it's not not when you have a bank account and they declare bankruptcy and then take 900
[01:48.240 --> 01:55.120]  million dollars of it and give it to jp morgan and all of you neocons because i heard neocon
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.280]  this morning on the radio defending it all of you guys pushing this and defending it
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.800]  and calling 27 trillion and bank or bailout to foreign banks free market they're going to
[02:04.800 --> 02:08.960]  take your bank accounts and your pensions too and whatever you've got left they're going to
[02:08.960 --> 02:16.640]  devalue it through hyperinflation i'm seeing democrats defend this as well it is truly
[02:17.360 --> 02:22.720]  disgusting and i've got a twitter here that drudge is linked to we have the man himself joining us
[02:22.720 --> 02:29.280]  gerald solente coming up 20 minutes from now this is from gerald solente's twitter gerald solente
[02:29.280 --> 02:33.360]  twitter.com forward slash gerald solente and we're going to i'm going to retweet this at
[02:33.360 --> 02:38.240]  real alex jones that we should tweet to tweet it right now that solente's coming on bankrupt
[02:39.360 --> 02:49.440]  mf global fires entire 1066 workforce he goes on to say by the way i got hammered by
[02:49.440 --> 02:57.920]  mf global too too bad corezine didn't die in his car accident and by the way uh solente was on with
[02:57.920 --> 03:03.680]  us on the nightly news last night and that restreamed after it first aired over and over again
[03:03.680 --> 03:09.280]  every once in a while the upload of the mp4 archive fails so it isn't on our youtube channel yet
[03:09.280 --> 03:14.240]  are you better believe it beyond drudge right now but he's linked to the uh our team piece which is
[03:14.240 --> 03:20.160]  great it's just that he went into more detail in our interview last night and we're going to stream
[03:20.160 --> 03:26.400]  restream re-air part of that coming up the next segment then jerald solente will join us live
[03:28.160 --> 03:37.760]  but why is this such a big deal why is this so huge because it turns out the sec and the cftc
[03:37.760 --> 03:42.560]  knew about this three weeks ago i have all the mainstream roiders forms all right here
[03:42.560 --> 03:51.840]  they all knew about it and no one was warned and this was basically allowed to be done now
[03:51.840 --> 03:56.160]  that people are screaming bloody murder by the way this didn't start breaking about the missing
[03:56.160 --> 04:02.640]  accounts until yesterday when solente went on rt in the morning then that forced the business channels
[04:02.640 --> 04:08.800]  and bloomberg and others to start covering it this is a big deal because it shows that well
[04:08.800 --> 04:14.720]  they're admitting it it shows the start of a new 2008 style crisis and this is a new type of bank
[04:14.720 --> 04:20.400]  run this is an internal bank run by these big hedge funds and people that are now in banking
[04:21.120 --> 04:26.800]  that's what getting rid of glass deagle did and mf global gobbled up
[04:27.760 --> 04:33.600]  slent has been doing this for close to 40 years what he said since 1972 so they gobbled up the
[04:33.600 --> 04:40.320]  gold trading company where he actually was getting physical delivery and then took the
[04:40.320 --> 04:44.400]  money out of his account and then contacted him saying oh there's no money in your account put
[04:44.400 --> 04:50.800]  more in obviously with the intent of grabbing that up and so this signifies the accelerating
[04:50.800 --> 04:55.920]  collapse i mean i cannot describe to you how big this is we're going to break it down on the other

[08:32.480 --> 08:39.360]  am and fm in canada to all of you thank you so much for tuning in today we have broken down the
[08:39.360 --> 08:45.600]  fact that there is a global concerted effort by the six big mega banks to implode the global
[08:45.600 --> 08:51.440]  economy by design with the six big mega banks that have bought off the major legislatures the
[08:51.440 --> 08:59.280]  congress and the parliaments of europe to then publicly poses the saviors during each leg of
[08:59.280 --> 09:05.760]  the engineered implosion and then always the answer to the last crisis is more power to the
[09:05.760 --> 09:12.240]  globalist more global government more tyranny more taxes more trillions paid to the offshore banks
[09:12.240 --> 09:18.960]  who engineered the whole thing european technocratic dictatorship now announced on every news channel
[09:18.960 --> 09:24.160]  and they're telling yuppies technocracy and tyranny will keep your stock market up we are
[09:24.160 --> 09:33.360]  now being fully bathed in evil they have now come out and said oh it's soft corruption it's no big
[09:33.360 --> 09:44.000]  deal that the congress the leadership of the congress insider trades knowing how bills are
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.080]  going to be voted on knowing what funding what companies are going to get and actually passing
[09:50.080 --> 09:56.240]  government funding and port barrel directly to companies in some cases their wives husbands
[09:56.240 --> 10:03.280]  fathers mothers children own and they just have Nancy Pelosi come out and say yeah my wealth doubled
[10:03.280 --> 10:09.040]  in four years bought up 60 plus percent in two years has gone down 20 plus percent i'm allowed
[10:09.040 --> 10:15.840]  to insider trade and 60 minutes announces it and calls it soft corruption when it's the most hard
[10:15.840 --> 10:25.120]  core type there is this is the essence of corporate globalist fascism crony capitalism at the barrel
[10:25.120 --> 10:33.120]  of a gun homeland security is the prison planet takeover of america it is the system of making
[10:33.120 --> 10:38.720]  americans prisoners and even giving us prisoner induction training with checkpoints and tsa now
[10:38.720 --> 10:44.080]  on the highways we have denver post and others promoting how great it is that citizens are
[10:44.080 --> 10:49.680]  being taught to not even trust their best friends and family we have a report out on that today
[10:49.680 --> 10:55.840]  no one can be trusted but government giant telescreens going up all over the place saying
[10:55.840 --> 11:01.920]  trust no one but government terrorists are everywhere the only people who aren't terrorist
[11:01.920 --> 11:07.600]  are goldman sacks jp morgan chase the new world order they're here to help you everybody else is bad
[11:08.480 --> 11:12.800]  al qaeda wants to get you but never mind the fact that the bankers put them in over libya
[11:12.800 --> 11:20.240]  and are trying to put them in syria i mean this is it and then the other shoe dropped a major sign
[11:20.240 --> 11:30.880]  in the acceleration i have never since the great depression seen banks run off with people's secured
[11:30.880 --> 11:38.400]  accounts people segregated bank accounts gold accounts you name it and since i learned about
[11:38.400 --> 11:45.200]  this yesterday i'm now discovering other companies are doing this right now and i know why the system
[11:45.200 --> 11:48.800]  in the last two weeks didn't make a big deal out of this and kept it very quiet until salente
[11:49.520 --> 11:55.360]  was finally the straw that broke the camels back yesterday morning on rt because when people figure
[11:55.360 --> 11:59.520]  out that they're not just going to devalue your currency they may just not even let you have your
[11:59.520 --> 12:05.200]  money they may just snatch your safety deposit boxes and i'm seeing more and more of that by the feds
[12:05.200 --> 12:11.280]  but now they're just talking about taking it all and you can type into the search engine more
[12:11.280 --> 12:15.840]  municipalities seizing safety deposit boxes i mean there's a lot of weirdness going on
[12:16.480 --> 12:21.120]  why not they already took the veteran's death benefits 12 years ago made deals with the insurance
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.680]  companies that take them when the people try to collect them they can keep that quiet so gerald
[12:25.680 --> 12:30.720]  salente is coming up imagine he has over a hundred thousand dollars he won't say how much more but
[12:30.720 --> 12:39.680]  he says it's six figures of his money in his account at mf global mf global had bought
[12:40.640 --> 12:47.280]  the commodity company that he was with that he had an account with and they just took it out of
[12:47.280 --> 12:52.240]  the segregated account and i've got all the reports here where they just in plain view
[12:52.240 --> 12:59.840]  admit it commissioner views mf global darkly this just came out yesterday and it turns out
[12:59.840 --> 13:05.520]  for upwards of three weeks they knew now now guess who the commissioner is guess who the head is
[13:05.520 --> 13:12.400]  listen to this this is out of Reuters cftc head didn't want to distract from mf probe this is
[13:12.400 --> 13:21.680]  november 7th this is more than a week ago and you know why buried in the article it says the head
[13:21.680 --> 13:33.520]  of the cftc the commodities federal commission it turns out that he has close ties with mf
[13:33.520 --> 13:40.880]  global's former chief executive john corzine and goldman sacks they're all in business together
[13:40.880 --> 13:44.480]  that's why they're doing this let's go to the gerald salente interview from last night that he's
[13:44.480 --> 13:55.280]  coming up live on the other side of this break info wars dot com gerald salente i mean this is off
[13:55.280 --> 14:02.160]  the charts insane did i get it right correct anything if i was wrong yes you got it essentially right
[14:02.720 --> 14:07.120]  and i've been saying this a long time you know that that they're going to they're going to impose
[14:07.680 --> 14:13.120]  some level of economic martial law and i thought of course it would be in the banks
[14:13.120 --> 14:19.600]  that they're going to call a bank holiday of some sort and devalue the dollar but what i did is i
[14:19.600 --> 14:27.120]  had an account and i've been trading gold by the way alex since 1978 i've never had a problem
[14:27.760 --> 14:37.040]  what i do is like airlines and and grain companies you buy futures and i buy gold futures some people
[14:37.040 --> 14:45.040]  speculate with them i buy futures with the intention of taking delivery so i had enough
[14:45.040 --> 14:55.040]  money in my account and i had contracts that were coming due in december which is next month last
[14:55.040 --> 15:01.600]  monday i get a telephone call again the company i used to deal with was called lind wall dock
[15:01.600 --> 15:08.400]  by past me i never realized that they got bought out by mf global didn't make any difference
[15:08.400 --> 15:13.440]  been dealing with them for years i've no been in there as i said i've been around commodities a
[15:13.440 --> 15:21.120]  long time nothing of this type of ever happened so i get a call i have a margin call that means
[15:21.120 --> 15:26.160]  i don't have enough money in my account to support my goal positions i said to guy what are you
[15:26.160 --> 15:30.160]  talking about yeah i'm taking delivery at the end of the month i got a ton of money in my account
[15:30.160 --> 15:37.360]  oh no you don't mr salenti the money has been taken out of your account i said who agreed to take
[15:37.360 --> 15:43.920]  the what are you talking about he's well lind wall dock is owned by mf global and they decided
[15:44.640 --> 15:50.720]  the cme group and another party that they're going to take the money and put it with a trustee i said
[15:50.720 --> 15:58.160]  oh yeah you mean the myo lansky group and the al capone group decided to take all of my money
[15:58.160 --> 16:06.240]  out of my account and then asked me for a margin call to put in more money into a sinking ship
[16:06.240 --> 16:13.840]  i should be out of your mind i'm sorry mr salenti that's all we know if you don't come up with more
[16:13.840 --> 16:24.240]  money we're going to close your accounts your positions so now alex they have my money they
[16:24.240 --> 16:32.320]  close my positions and i can't get any of it now let's put this into perspective the guy that was
[16:32.320 --> 16:40.080]  running this operation john cozine hey where did john cozine come from well he's originally a
[16:40.080 --> 16:48.320]  goldman sacks guy you know one of those fine people out there and then he became governor
[16:48.320 --> 16:54.640]  senator in new jersey that wasn't good enough for him gave it to new jersey really good i'm gonna
[16:54.640 --> 17:01.840]  become i'm gonna become governor he becomes governor and senator in new jersey runs that
[17:01.840 --> 17:07.360]  place into the ground and by the way cozine if you're listening you know that car accident you
[17:07.360 --> 17:14.640]  got into a while ago and you almost died your sob you should have died because you're ruined a lot
[17:14.640 --> 17:23.520]  of people's lives stealing their money you know what he was doing alex because he's connected
[17:23.520 --> 17:29.920]  with the boys you know they give him preferential treatment trading rights oh the guy that runs
[17:29.920 --> 17:38.800]  the commodities future trading commission gary gensler gary gensler hey he gave cozine i think
[17:38.800 --> 17:46.880]  ten thousand dollars for his campaign it's a contribution god be sure yeah it's a bribe and
[17:46.880 --> 17:54.560]  a payoff gary gensler runs the commodities future trading commission for the united states of america
[17:55.440 --> 18:00.400]  and they let these guys get away with all these dirty deals as they're pulling them off
[18:00.400 --> 18:08.240]  and bringing everybody down so now cozine he's going to play according to reports that i read
[18:09.680 --> 18:16.560]  you go to los vegas over there alex and you go put a dollar down on the table and you say to the
[18:16.560 --> 18:24.640]  guy dealing the cards that's not a dollar that's forty dollars that's right that's what the house
[18:24.640 --> 18:31.440]  that i could bet every dollar down i can make a forty dollar bet that's what he was doing
[18:32.320 --> 18:42.240]  so now what happens is brilliant brilliant cozines betting on european bonds you know what's going
[18:42.240 --> 18:51.200]  on in europe the bond market's going berserk italy's on the verge of going greek with the bonds hitting
[18:51.200 --> 18:59.360]  over seven percent you look at what's going on he bet on portuguese irish all the losing bonds spain
[19:00.400 --> 19:08.560]  so now the bet in total as i read it it's about 40 billion dollars that this guy's controlling
[19:09.760 --> 19:18.720]  the shortfall that they can't find is 600 million the cme group that runs the commodities game
[19:18.720 --> 19:26.240]  they they've come up and they said we'll cover 300 million so now we're talking about a 300
[19:26.240 --> 19:34.480]  million dollar shortfall out of a 40 billion dollar pie and they steal everybody's money out of their
[19:34.480 --> 19:44.640]  account you tell me what's going on because my suspicion is they don't have the gold and silver
[19:44.640 --> 19:49.600]  to deliver that's it well that's what max keiser and you and many others predicted
[19:49.600 --> 19:54.400]  was that they were going to end up being short but my god the boldness of this

[24:32.640 --> 24:38.080]  six minutes from our lengthy 35-minute in-depth interview last night on info wars nightly news
[24:38.080 --> 24:45.760]  at prisonplanet.tv with Gerald Salente now we've learned more in just the last 14 hours or so
[24:46.400 --> 24:53.600]  since last night Reuters is now reporting that the federal government regulator
[24:54.640 --> 24:59.360]  involved in overseeing this as long ago as a few weeks ago two and a half weeks ago
[24:59.920 --> 25:05.680]  knew about all this and basically kept it quiet but they went on to say don't worry though even
[25:05.680 --> 25:12.000]  though he's quote involved with john corzine and involved with goldman sacks who basically is using
[25:12.000 --> 25:18.800]  this as a front company it's okay his underlings can still carry out a good investigation cftc
[25:18.800 --> 25:26.240]  had didn't want to distract from mf probe the top us futures regulator said he was not participating
[25:26.240 --> 25:32.720]  in the investigation of mf global holdings the brokerage that filed for bankruptcy so he would
[25:32.720 --> 25:39.120]  not become a distraction and it goes on to say that genzler has had close ties with mf global's
[25:39.120 --> 25:44.480]  former chief executive john corzine the former governor of new jersey both men worked at goldman
[25:44.480 --> 25:49.280]  sacks group and then it goes on to say that of the 900 million it was 600 million last night
[25:49.280 --> 25:54.240]  900 million of customers money out of cash accounts not just gold accounts and other accounts
[25:54.240 --> 26:00.320]  they say regular accounts that was just taken segregated accounts i mean they're making no
[26:00.320 --> 26:03.520]  bones about this is unprecedented to actually grab customer accounts
[26:06.240 --> 26:10.080]  now what they're doing is they're admitting and we're going to go to gerald salente on this
[26:10.080 --> 26:14.320]  joining us via video skype from new york at the trends research center headquarters
[26:15.280 --> 26:21.040]  i mean i'm almost speechless right now this is so incredible they are now
[26:21.040 --> 26:30.400]  now uh announcing that most of the money 500 plus million of the 900 million was given to jp
[26:30.400 --> 26:35.360]  morgan and there's now an investigation of how they claimed those bank accounts were theirs
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.920]  and those brokerage accounts were theirs gerald salente uh i know you learned about this last
[26:41.920 --> 26:46.160]  week but they didn't even explain what was happening it came into focus just the last 48
[26:46.160 --> 26:52.560]  hours now we're learning more by the minute what is the latest uh on your six plus figures that's
[26:52.560 --> 26:57.920]  disappeared into a black hole i just got off the phone with the broker the account that they've
[26:57.920 --> 27:07.200]  taken it over to the the new brokerage firm zero they know nothing and of course you know a lot
[27:07.200 --> 27:14.400]  of people from mf global have got you know mf'd by by corzine they lost their jobs so a few guys
[27:14.400 --> 27:22.480]  that were brought over now with the new firm and they they can't tell me one thing this is this is
[27:22.480 --> 27:30.320]  criminality clear and simple and you know here's the rub alex you get court driving you're like a
[27:30.320 --> 27:39.120]  fraction over that that limit for alcohol boy the goons put the handcuffs on you look how they

[28:38.720 --> 28:48.400]  white shoe boys so sacrosanct that no one could talk about them only the italians if the italians
[28:48.400 --> 28:58.080]  were doing this some the redstone would be having a ball putting it on HBO why isn't corzine in jail
[28:58.080 --> 29:05.600]  until we could straighten this out why why do all of these groups you look it up two weeks ago

[34:03.440 --> 34:08.880]  Reuters forbs you name it but they just calmly report on it yeah they took people's money that
[34:08.880 --> 34:13.760]  was segregated in theirs yeah they don't know if they're going to give it back yeah jp morgan
[34:13.760 --> 34:18.400]  got five hundred and what 90 million of it yeah that's just the way it is and they can they call
[34:18.400 --> 34:23.680]  salente up a week and a half ago yeah mr salente uh they need more money your account's empty for

[34:39.040 --> 34:42.560]  this has ever happened this is important it's not like he's some little old lady that didn't know
[34:42.560 --> 34:47.200]  what she was doing and this happened this is this is going after people's personal
[34:48.640 --> 34:54.480]  accounts this is rating them and here it is mf global looted customers accounts via
[34:54.480 --> 35:00.080]  internal bank run that's what this is and now i'm reading over Reuters and others it turns out
[35:00.080 --> 35:05.440]  it's other people's separate cash accounts people that had cash accounts with them even had credit
[35:05.440 --> 35:14.080]  cards attached to it or debit cards gone 900 million dollars and it turns out the cftc knew
[35:14.080 --> 35:18.960]  about this three weeks ago and let them let me just reach these headlines we're going back to
[35:18.960 --> 35:26.560]  gerald uh here's Reuters cftc that's the federal agency commissioner views mf global darkly this
[35:26.560 --> 35:31.200]  is yesterday saying it looks like fraud looks criminal you know the money is not where it should
[35:31.200 --> 35:36.960]  be something nefarious has happened potentially something illegal oh really you're you're just
[35:36.960 --> 35:45.280]  now saying that as you get scared continuing analysis sec targets low level bankers spares top
[35:45.280 --> 35:50.560]  execs Reuters of course we've always they go after people who've done nothing but if you
[35:50.560 --> 35:55.040]  steal the whole farm it's fine because these mega companies put their people in as all the regulators
[35:55.040 --> 36:01.440]  purgatory for mf global customers wall street journal at least 33 000 account holders can't get
[36:01.440 --> 36:07.520]  their cash my entire business has come to a halt that's a quote wall street journal they're grabbing
[36:07.520 --> 36:13.680]  cash gold everything mf global clients accuse jp morgan of overreach and bankruptcy and it goes on
[36:13.680 --> 36:20.000]  500 plus million of the 900 million jp morgan got oh those accounts will take those those are ours
[36:20.000 --> 36:26.800]  cftc head didn't want to distract from mf global probe because it turns out ginsler is quote heavily
[36:26.800 --> 36:32.480]  connected to john corezine and goldman sacks where they both came from it's always goldman sacks
[36:33.040 --> 36:39.040]  continuing launches investigation now the cftc launches an investigation to bankrupt mf deal
[36:39.040 --> 36:43.600]  after the money's already been gotten out cox brothers and mf global friends to the end
[36:44.160 --> 36:49.280]  there's another one mf global judge sets hearing on cash transfers this is just out
[36:49.280 --> 36:54.320]  this morning a federal bankruptcy judge scheduled a thursday hearing on the request of the trusty
[36:54.320 --> 37:00.400]  overseeing the bankruptcy of mf global holdings ltd's broker dealer unit and returned to 520 million
[37:00.400 --> 37:08.160]  of cash to customers so they're they're now meeting about the 520 of the 590 is different
[37:08.160 --> 37:13.760]  different articles that jp morgan's got and the hearing set for later this afternoon we'll
[37:13.760 --> 37:18.640]  we'll go over all of this here's another one san francisco chronicles cme new of mf global fund
[37:18.640 --> 37:28.720]  shortfall before cftc regulators they knew now this is break down why this happened and what
[37:28.720 --> 37:34.960]  this signifies for me you were getting into the cart of this they arrest people for lemonade stands
[37:34.960 --> 37:39.280]  don't let people have organic cookouts they come and grab stuff they're they're arresting
[37:39.280 --> 37:43.840]  homage people in year and a half i keep saying a year i've been corrected a year and a half long
[37:43.840 --> 37:47.760]  million dollar secret sting when he was just publicly selling it to his neighbors and the
[37:47.760 --> 37:51.760]  undercover cops begged him for months to sell him the whole milk by the way i got raw milk in
[37:51.760 --> 37:55.280]  my refrigerator out there i'm gonna drink some later you're not gonna stop me with my one-world
[37:55.280 --> 38:01.120]  way i'm gonna gonna drink it and i'm gonna enjoy it okay i'm gonna get that natural growth hormone

[38:05.920 --> 38:09.760]  imagine you're well you're not ranting you're putting a lot of pieces together that are very
[38:09.760 --> 38:18.800]  important especially the line from gary gensler the commodities future trading commission head
[38:19.360 --> 38:26.400]  he doesn't want to interfere he's been shoveling money into kozine's campaign fund
[38:26.400 --> 38:33.920]  when the loser used to run new jersey kozine the former senator and governor it's the goldman
[38:33.920 --> 38:41.920]  sax gang it's the merrill lynch mob it's the city group criminals and i want to make this clear
[38:41.920 --> 38:48.320]  alex i'm reading some of these comments oh how stupid salenti is you know he talks about having
[38:48.320 --> 38:58.320]  physical gold and here he gets stung buying paper gold no idiots it goes like this i had a contract
[38:58.320 --> 39:08.720]  the contract was an agreement that i would pick my gold up in december they took my money out of
[39:08.720 --> 39:17.920]  my savings out of my account with lin wall doc and won't give me the money to buy the gold that's
[39:17.920 --> 39:26.800]  like you going to any gold dealer and i go to other gold dealers for the record i buy coins
[39:26.800 --> 39:35.920]  and i buy bullion it's like calling up one of the ones like kit go that's everywhere and sending
[39:35.920 --> 39:44.400]  them money for your gold and they don't send it to you it's as simple as that so no i'm not an
[39:44.400 --> 39:53.120]  imbecile no i wasn't buying paper gold i had bought an agreement to deliver the gold in december
[39:53.120 --> 40:01.200]  now hear this you have money with Charles Schwab you got your money in wells fargo you got it with
[40:01.200 --> 40:11.120]  the city group criminals you trade with with fidelity or Raymond james you have your money
[40:11.120 --> 40:20.560]  anywhere they'll do the same thing to you no i'm not a dupe no i'm not a jerk i've been robbed
[40:20.560 --> 40:30.400]  by the corezine criminal group do you remember alex when that guy Strauss kahn you know the
[40:30.400 --> 40:38.160]  head of the imf yes the international mafia federation when he was arrested in new york
[40:38.160 --> 40:46.640]  for allegedly forcing the maid to have oral sex with him do you remember the perp walk
[40:46.640 --> 40:54.160]  that those brave new york city cops who were out there beating up little kids and grabbing a matter
[40:54.160 --> 41:01.920]  occupy wall street do you remember when all those dick detectives were arresting kahn
[41:02.800 --> 41:10.800]  where's the perp walk for corezine how come he doesn't get one he screwed a lot more people
[41:10.800 --> 41:19.200]  than dominique Strauss kahn could ever have a wet dream about all right gerald and i understand
[41:19.200 --> 41:24.000]  you're angry he won't say but it's well over six figures well over a hundred thousand dollars and
[41:24.640 --> 41:30.400]  you know i did see in the info wars dot com story posted on drudge drudge report dot com that
[41:30.400 --> 41:34.160]  there were people in there snickering and laughing those are trolls that live in their
[41:34.160 --> 41:38.960]  mother's basement who don't understand commodities who don't understand what's happening i want to
[41:38.960 --> 41:42.320]  point something out so just ignore them it just gives them attention is what they love here's what's
[41:42.320 --> 41:47.760]  happening people don't want to admit how late in the game it is they don't want to admit they're
[41:47.760 --> 41:53.840]  setting up a banking dictatorship in time magazine's own words in europe out of the crisis the very
[41:53.840 --> 42:01.120]  same golden sacks jp morgan city bank wells fargo's same groups six big mega banks they set all this
[42:01.120 --> 42:06.720]  up they're doing it again and they've already been stealing our money by devaluing it they're
[42:06.720 --> 42:12.480]  already jacking up our taxes to pay more and more to them in banker bailouts they're already doing
[42:12.480 --> 42:18.560]  this and you are taking physical delivery of gold you have paid for and they literally grab your
[42:18.560 --> 42:27.280]  account even reuters bloomberg and forbs they admit these even the even the federal agency
[42:27.280 --> 42:34.560]  the cftc says this is illegal and they've grabbed people's personal accounts this is never done
[42:34.560 --> 42:40.480]  in bankruptcy how come corezine isn't in jail what makes him better than everybody else
[42:41.120 --> 42:47.280]  how come they're not doing a perp walk with him and that's what my anger is about besides stealing
[42:47.280 --> 42:53.120]  my money as i said look at all the lives that this guy's ruined i had friends that all lost their
[42:53.120 --> 42:59.200]  jobs but you the people that you were reading about have lost their businesses and you're talking
[42:59.200 --> 43:06.560]  about what's going on in europe let's get this straight it's fascism the top of the corporate
[43:06.560 --> 43:14.880]  line the bankers have taken over super mario they call the guy in italy super mario monti
[43:14.880 --> 43:22.800]  three cod monti he's running the show now where is he from he was the european head of the
[43:22.800 --> 43:31.600]  trilateral commission that's right go to wikipedia it's right there oh he's an international advisor
[43:31.600 --> 43:39.040]  to oh this is going to shock you alex gulman sacks oh look at the guy that they put in over
[43:39.040 --> 43:46.800]  there in greece the same thing gulman sacks it's a former vice president argentina coaster rica
[43:46.800 --> 43:52.880]  new zealand australia england germany france every country's run by gulman sacks every major
[43:52.880 --> 44:02.720]  company anywhere sacks government sacks that's what we're all under the thumb of hey marie rostin
[44:02.720 --> 44:11.200]  over there at what's your name redstone that's it some the redstone let's do a deal on the wall
[44:11.200 --> 44:19.200]  street mob i'm sick and tired of your going after italyans and if you have a problem with it marie
[44:19.760 --> 44:24.400]  come over and visit me we could talk about it man to man
[44:26.800 --> 44:32.000]  jerald again we need you i've never seen you this angry we're gonna you're gonna get your money back
[44:32.000 --> 44:37.600]  so just i don't know if i'm getting my money back i just talked to my broker over there and they
[44:37.600 --> 44:43.920]  don't know if i'm getting my money back and they've been holding it for two weeks i want to see a
[44:43.920 --> 44:49.280]  perp walk for corazon exactly that's what i want to exactly but let me just stop you right there
[44:49.280 --> 44:53.840]  because this goes to the heart of the matter this is what i'm asking you right now this is the key
[44:53.840 --> 45:00.640]  this is the key i'm asking you yes gulman sacks and the and the other five big banks and a few
[45:00.640 --> 45:05.760]  subsidiaries they literally can get away with anything now they've got both parties leadership
[45:05.760 --> 45:11.200]  they've got all the regulators that submitted right here in the news they they 12 years ago took all
[45:11.200 --> 45:16.400]  the veterans uh death benefits and as they die they they let the widow know sorry we're not paying
[45:16.400 --> 45:20.640]  you government says we can steal you know you might have put it hundreds of thousands of dollars
[45:20.640 --> 45:27.120]  over the years when your husband was in the military 25 years you don't get it okay so so my issue is
[45:27.120 --> 45:32.160]  won't this totally destroy confidence because they're certainly trying to keep the lid on this
[45:32.160 --> 45:36.160]  right now it's not getting the attention it should but it's starting to come out won't this totally
[45:36.160 --> 45:42.560]  destroy confidence when we learn that it doesn't matter if it's stocks bonds portfolios physical
[45:42.560 --> 45:49.600]  gold bank accounts safety deposit boxes they will take it they will take it all and that they're
[45:49.600 --> 45:55.440]  now admitting this signals an even bigger collapse than 2008 we can see it all happening how much do
[45:55.440 --> 45:59.680]  they think they can get away with how much do they think the cops will carry out for them when the
[45:59.680 --> 46:03.680]  cops families are going to lose everything when the cops are going to lose their pension funds
[46:03.680 --> 46:09.040]  it's already happening i mean how do they think they're going to get away with this or are they
[46:09.040 --> 46:15.840]  just so greedy they don't care they're basically like cancer destroying the body uh that it lives in
[46:15.840 --> 46:20.400]  i mean that's my question couldn't this trigger because a lot of people i know and i was already
[46:20.400 --> 46:24.080]  doing this i'd already been worrying about this lately because i feel it in my gut you've been
[46:24.080 --> 46:29.840]  warning about it i know a lot of people now who are already getting everything out of the banks
[46:29.840 --> 46:34.880]  and out of the stock market and out of everything what are these parasites going to do when people
[46:34.880 --> 46:40.560]  all start pulling their money out of the system i mean that doesn't send confidence when the inside
[46:40.560 --> 46:46.160]  banksters and the big commodity houses buy up companies that you're working with and steal your
[46:46.160 --> 46:51.920]  money and then just say you know that's the way it is you just need to go ahead and accept it
[46:51.920 --> 46:56.720]  won't that force people to pull their money out of the system when they learn the insiders
[46:56.720 --> 47:01.600]  are already engaged in internal bank runs of course and that's what they're doing so what
[47:01.600 --> 47:09.200]  do the fascists do they come up with a new line i got it we'll call it austerity measures and what
[47:09.200 --> 47:15.520]  they'll do is they'll send the false flag out there blame it on somebody else and say that because
[47:15.520 --> 47:21.760]  of these difficult times we have to impose austerity measures we're already living under them
[47:21.760 --> 47:27.280]  and you look remember when real estate prices were going up they raised your your real estate
[47:27.280 --> 47:33.360]  taxes because real estate prices were going up now real estate prices are down in the tubes
[47:33.920 --> 47:41.200]  you know land has gone down watch them 70 percent and what do they do they raise your taxes on real
[47:41.200 --> 47:48.400]  estate they raise your school taxes they raise every tax across the board so yes do they have a
[47:48.400 --> 47:56.640]  conscience do they understand their money junkies just like a heroin addict they have no bounds of
[47:56.640 --> 48:02.880]  boundaries they need more they need more and they will do anything to get it and they're doing it
[48:02.880 --> 48:07.920]  they're starting wars look what they've done in libya look what's going on around the world
[48:07.920 --> 48:13.520]  they are going to take that i've said this from the beginning when they first bailed out on the
[48:13.520 --> 48:21.600]  the goldman sacks guy over there frankenstein paulson remember him our us treasury secretary
[48:22.240 --> 48:29.360]  the guy was the former ceo of goldman sacks remember the tarp one yeah tarp all right
[48:29.360 --> 48:34.480]  they took our money gave it to goldman sacks and making a bed bet with ai jim and i have the clips
[48:34.480 --> 48:38.640]  jaryl have some breaking news here on your take on that's an obama deception and fall the republic
[48:38.640 --> 48:45.200]  that you're in he actually says to him in there's congressman stern from florida says how did you
[48:45.200 --> 48:49.600]  give yourself 200 something million of the bailout money and he said i got a waiver he goes who gave
[48:49.600 --> 48:55.600]  me the waiver i did i mean literally paulson said i gave myself a waiver to give myself uh the
[48:55.600 --> 49:00.080]  citizen's money now let's stop right there this is breaking jerald this just came out 10 minutes
[49:00.080 --> 49:07.360]  ago jaren just found it scanning mf global brokerage trustee to return some customer money but guess
[49:07.360 --> 49:12.640]  why they say it's happening they say it's already screwing up the stock market and the commodities
[49:12.640 --> 49:18.240]  no one globally now within 24 hours that this broke i think because you finally pushed it out there
[49:19.040 --> 49:26.560]  now they are announcing that it's affecting global trading in futures all over the world
[49:26.560 --> 49:32.480]  by shaking public confidence that's a quote so what we were just talking about is now happening
[49:32.480 --> 49:36.640]  and they're panicking and they're saying okay we'll give your money back we tried to take it but but
[49:36.640 --> 49:44.080]  don't don't keep everybody from pulling their money out a guy alex the global system is collapsing
[49:44.800 --> 49:50.640]  the fascist bankers that they just brought in to solve the problems and the prostitutes calling
[49:50.640 --> 49:56.560]  them technocrats as either yeah technocrat you know what technocrat is that's a bureaucrat that
[49:56.560 --> 50:03.520]  knows how to use a computer to cook the books these are the brilliant economists yeah they're
[50:03.520 --> 50:09.040]  not going to save the day you look at where bond yields are going in europe they're going through
[50:09.040 --> 50:16.640]  the roof there's no saving it the system isn't collapsed and as i said yesterday why do you
[50:16.640 --> 50:23.600]  think we heard all those stories about people taking their money and putting it under the mattress
[50:24.320 --> 50:32.880]  because they'll rob it from you and let's stop this proper language of calling them bankers

[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:13.920]  okay i want to go to your phone calls here for jerry solentine quick questions quick comments
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:18.480]  quick answers from him but i wanted to bring up something that he mentioned last night on info
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:23.840]  wars nightly news by the way that whole thing is now posted in the article mf global looted
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:28.720]  customers accounts via internal bank run if you want to find that video it's at the bottom of the
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:35.440]  article the video itself is titled zombie banks drain solentine's account because it's a consortium
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:41.600]  goldman sacks jp morgan house coming out they're all involved using mf global is just a fake holding
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.240]  company and that's how they do this over and over again but you raised the point and max keiser
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:51.200]  talked about this six months ago or a year ago really about how is golden silver goes up these
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:56.640]  companies were in there on record a naked shorting i mean you're an expert in you know golden silver
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.520]  trading so you can break it down for us you know in the futures manipulating it down and that they
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.480]  would really get caught short as the price went up and that we'd see more and more of this non-delivery
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.960]  from your research do you think that has anything to do with this uh with the december contracts
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:18.640]  coming up i really do i i don't think they have the goal to uh to to to give out and i've also
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:24.800]  heard i don't know if this is a fact but i've heard this before that for example with etfs the gld
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:33.200]  it's you know it's supposed to be um being held by hsbc in there in their vaults and i've heard
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:40.160]  that hsbc is one of the biggest shorts taking the biggest short positions on gold so in other words
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.800]  they're supposed to be holding gold but they're betting that the prices are going to go down
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:51.120]  and this is important alex because when i say take your money out of the the banks and and why
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:57.360]  they put in the mattress i'm not saying to keep it in that phony paper money for me i'm not giving
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:07.600]  anyone advice for me when i take it out i buy gold i buy in coins i used to buy it in contracts
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:15.440]  and i used to buy it from reputable companies so when i'm saying for me when i'm saying take
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:21.760]  in the i'm taking my i take my money out of the bank i buy gold and i buy silver and it goes back
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:30.160]  to gc's three g's gold's guns in a getaway plan this thing is collapsing around us oh i i was
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:37.360]  mentioning about three card monty over there that's taken over italy from burlesco he is also a member
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.480]  of the bill the burr group of course of a gun i who would have ever do who would have ever thought
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:49.520]  that listen of the last year of the 130 guests there more than 60 were were goldman sacks i mean
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:56.560]  from the exact number i think 67 i mean this is incredible this is the inner coterie now i wanted
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:01.840]  to raise one more point with you uh dealing with the economy and everything that's happening
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:07.040]  you mentioned individuals digging in not because we're in fear but because we're empowered and
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:12.400]  ready for whatever the situation is look at what governments are doing for a decade since
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.400]  they got rid of glass deagle they've been digging in they've been getting ready the pentagon admits
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:21.040]  they've been preparing a decade ago for collapse they knew all this was coming they think they're
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:25.600]  going to ride the crisis they created they're going to bring down the world just like they bring
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.560]  down companies they go in and liquidate and steal the pension funds and butcher it this is really
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:35.760]  a hostile takeover a thousand times worse than the you know charlie sheen wall street that came out in
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.040]  the 80s this is what they're doing and they really are so arrogant up there in their big
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:45.040]  high rises and all their armed guards they think they're going to get away with this
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:50.560]  jerald and i tell you like ron paul said if they get away with this we deserve it if we sit here
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:56.800]  when they destroy the dollar steal our accounts set up checkpoints grope our wives then i guess
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:02.240]  we do deserve it jerald i agree with you one of the people going to find some courage and self
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:09.040]  respect and stop looking up to politicians and how can an adult actually behave like this is
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:15.360]  beyond me and you have to take the future in your own hands and create the future and it's and you
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:21.760]  know we're going to be doing a documentary and there's a short out there now about you know me
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:28.800]  talking and i come and i say it's all about morality i mean that's all it is it's due on to others
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:35.200]  and there's no morality anymore whether it's at the top of the game with the gulman sacks gangs
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:41.520]  and the others and and starting phony wars or down to the welfare cheater the person trying
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:48.560]  to go on disability everybody's gaining the system so it goes back to morals and i'm not
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:55.200]  talking about religion i'm talking about spirituality the individual so and as i said this before
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:01.680]  alex there's that wonderful hindu buddha saying which whichever one when the students ready the
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:08.000]  teacher appears the people have to get ready they have to find the morality within them
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.640]  because when i'm not fine it then the future will change only until that happens that's right
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:20.320]  people think america's too big to fail and okay we're corrupt but it'll be okay no the bigger they
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:26.160]  are the harder they fall and and i mean folks i'm concerned i mean this is real this this is another
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:30.880]  big signpost what's happened to gerald and 30 plus thousand other people and it's just going to get
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.800]  worse it shows this is the former new jersey governor this is the guy invested with the head
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:41.680]  of the commission that controls it these people like bernie madeoff said he said i do what everybody
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:49.040]  does and it's true at that level they're all like bernie madeoff that's right and and by the way
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:56.800]  you know there's this february 27th new york magazine story that bernie did out of his cell
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.760]  over the telephone and there were two things that he said this otherwise worthless story
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:10.800]  one that he learned that the game was rigged for the members of the club those are his words and
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:22.960]  number two it's all one big ponzi scheme he said this the king of ponzi everybody open your eyes
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:32.240]  it's collapsing worldwide they're not going to be able to save the day you know it's a solution
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:39.600]  they're trying to come up with the or is to have the european central bank print money brilliant
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:49.120]  print more worthless money just like they're doing in the u.s. that's why i say gold absolutely let's
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:53.360]  go to you're absolutely right let's go to some calls here uh bill in connecticut you're on the
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:15:01.040]  air with jerry solente go ahead uh yes hi alex hi mr. solente um what i'm wondering is you know
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:06.160]  we've looked at this is definitely is a major signpost in the collapse and in light of that
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:12.240]  that do either of you two gentlemen see anyone within congress they could form a committee
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:19.600]  with sub subpoena power and prospect tutorial power with real teeth they can call a guy in
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:26.080]  light core site and question him before the american public well that's a good start yeah no it's
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.640]  not no it's a what are you going to call in what are you going to go to the mob members you know
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:36.640]  you're going to go to the dawns and ask them to be nice no they did the whole thing look at the
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:42.640]  numbers that just came out we were talking about it last night on how these congressmen and senators
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:48.560]  know the inside deal of what's going to happen and then they play your bets on them and become
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:53.520]  you know multimillionaires sure sure i mean specifically he was just saying no congress is
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:16:00.560]  totally corrupt there's a few good people in there like ron paul and a few others the rest of them
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.680]  you know forget it no no i agree with you he was just saying specifically is there anybody in a
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.880]  position of power ron paul's over yeah no paul's not over one of the big committees they've kept
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:17.840]  him out of it no they're not going to do it they put on these phony shows they bring them in they're
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:22.080]  all like they're in everywhere well jero let me say this because i think you're right that's why
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:27.600]  they've gotten so bold to steal people's bank accounts now is that they know as congress congress
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:33.280]  is so arrogant they come out and they go it's not insider trading when we do it and 60 minutes goes
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:40.080]  it's soft corruption no it's hardcore total insider trading and and it's not just insider trading it's
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:47.120]  fraud they are giving government bills and money to companies they're invested in i know and then
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:53.520]  so it's i love that language like he said soft that's prestitute language here let me make this
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:17:03.040]  straight the politicians are nothing more than enablers and enforcers for the financial and
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:13.440]  military crime bosses so to ask the enablers and enforcers to bring the guys that put them in power
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:18.720]  to bring put them it's not going to happen it never happens
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:24.960]  wow um jerald i know you got to go here in a few minutes let's take a few more calls and
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:28.720]  maybe i know you got to go but maybe bring in to the bottom of the hour so you can talk about
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.640]  some of your solution that is in a moment let's race through these calls jerald salente is our
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:37.600]  guest he's not being a negative ladies and gentlemen he's just facing facts and they wouldn't be
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.600]  publicly going we're allowed to insider trade and you're not if they weren't trying to inoculate us
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.240]  psychologically but but i appreciate the caller's point uh joe in pencil vein you're on the air
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:54.560]  with jerald salente hello yes sir yeah i hope so i just want to make a point uh how do we start
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.640]  with this happens with salente he's a great guy but uh just uh a little guy on the phone
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:03.200]  the post i've been noticing my bank account he misses 60 dollars here the account is perfectly
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:07.920]  balanced out i know i spent i'm saying i think i'll take the big guys down you know they could
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.240]  probably play with us for quite a while well that's what i was going to say is that everybody i know
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.960]  has companies overcharging them i go to restaurants i thought it was an accident the first 10 times
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:22.640]  now restaurants will cheat you and add things you didn't buy like i didn't buy a bottle of wine oh well
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:27.680]  never mind uh because they can tell you're not paying attention and and and again it's a culture
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.400]  of crux and it's permeating a lot of people get cheated and they don't decide to fight corruption
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.160]  they decide well i'll cheat somebody since it happened to me and that's what jerald was just
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:41.360]  getting to yes banks are trying to charge all these new fees to keep your money but they're also
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.240]  cheating people so are other companies jerald can you speak to that yes that's what i was saying
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:52.320]  before it all comes down to morality and it goes beyond the money i mean look at this country
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:58.880]  you know the founding fathers would be turning in their graves you got a clown like bush and
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:05.760]  cheney going out there taking the country to war for fake reasons that you know that
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:11.840]  Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and thai style cater and in other countries you know
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.520]  they had a thing called the norenberg trials in this country they put them out there on the
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:25.440]  media circuit the prostitutes ask them softball con questions and they sell their books look what's
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:31.520]  going on at every level of immorality let me raise this how they're letting these look at how they're
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:40.560]  letting these gas companies and oil companies frat the hell out of this country pumping in millions
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:48.640]  and millions and gallons of chemicals into the earth and saying that oh it doesn't do anything to
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:57.040]  poison the water you know i mean it's one immorality after another and as i said all the politicians
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:05.120]  are are enablers and enforcers for the crime bosses i agree now before i take a few more calls i
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:11.040]  just want to add here that uh if you look at all the other forms of immorality i watched
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:16.960]  ron paul when he was given 89 seconds during the televised portion of the cbs debate 89 seconds
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:21.360]  turned out there was a memo saying only give him 90 so they cheated him even out of one second
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:26.080]  when you know the establishment hedge fund guy you know romney you know he's getting 10 minutes
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:31.680]  plus but expanding on that gerald ron paul when he said he was against torture a bunch of people
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:37.040]  clapped but a bunch didn't and i watched all these soft men and women and i slowed it down
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:41.680]  and watched it like 10 times because i was intrigued by it sunday afternoon watching it
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:48.000]  the youtube and they shook their heads with satisfaction and anger and disgust and would
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.680]  look at each other and stick their chins out when ron paul said waterboarding is torture and it's
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:59.200]  wrong they think torture sexy and cool they think killing people without warrants is cool
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:03.120]  they think lawlessness is cool because the government's their friend and hire people on
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:08.160]  mainline talk radio they sound like little goofy children that call in they're not serious they're
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:14.000]  not hard and it is like lambs to the slaughter and that's why they're doing this is because i saw
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:20.880]  those soft gullible people hissing at ron paul begging for torture begging for the rule of law
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:27.280]  to be taken they have no idea that as the rule of law is taken that's the oxygen leaving the room
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:33.200]  can you speak to that oh you're you're 100 right that's very well put the oxygen leaving the room
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:38.720]  and again as i said it all comes back down to morality and i love like i said i love
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:45.120]  i just heard what's his name too this uh other guy that the other uh tough guy out there john
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.600]  huntsman huntsman yeah huntsman another you know guy that's never probably had been in a schoolyard
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:22:01.040]  fight let alone a bar room brawl he can't live with a nuclear armed ron oh you can't johnny boy
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:08.320]  i'll tell you what you do pack up your gear take your old man's billions of dollars take
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:18.720]  your wife take your kids and go fight against ron or shut your fat mouth and with all of them
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:25.680]  anybody out there that talks tough that wants to go to war leave the charge or shut your mouth
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:33.920]  and that's what really get like that gingrich oh you see this one gingrich made a million six
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:43.440]  advising freddy and fanny freddy mac and fanny may another fat boy who couldn't fight his way out
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:53.040]  of a paper bag that wants to get tough with ron all you big mouths out there all you flabber mouths

[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:04.560]  going to try to use our money and and and let's take a few more calls and we'll let gerald go
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:09.360]  here and talk about some of his solutions before he goes let's talk to steve in oklahoma you're
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:15.280]  on the air with gerald salenta of trends research dot com gerald i just want to say i'm a member of

[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:27.120]  back but my comment is hold on i feel sorry for us all this means that the criminals are getting
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:32.080]  10 times more bold i mean this means i mean this means the ball game's moving moving fast so again
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:37.040]  again it's a little bit go ahead and make your point i'm sorry okay yeah my comment was that the
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.520]  you know i see the two political parties at nothing more than organized crime families
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:46.320]  who happen to tolerate each other uh but one of these days when i'm going to decide
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:50.240]  they want it all and they're going to get rid of the other one and i think that john goddy's
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:56.400]  only crime is that he tried to out operate outside the uh the two big political crimes no no you
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:01.440]  just said it the whole government brings in the drugs all of it they only bust people that don't
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.920]  pay their cut or launder their money through them the head of the new york stock exchange
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:11.680]  richard grasso uh back in 99 was in reuters went to the head of the fart gorillas in columbia
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.600]  and said invest your money with us or we're going to have you invaded and they said no
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:22.240]  so the u.s covertly invaded gerard solente well yeah yeah and that's his covert action thing
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.400]  well first of all thank you for subscribing i'm glad you're enjoying the trends journal
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:33.440]  and and and and alex made a point also before i go on to the second one that yeah i'm losing money
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:44.320]  but what i'm warning everybody is that every financial institution is under the same kind
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:54.640]  of pressure because the systems are collapsing so if you think your money is safe with any of
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:25:03.680]  those big names you're making a big mistake mfglobal was one of the biggest of the 120-something
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:10.960]  trading groups out there in a commodities then and up going back to what you were saying about
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:21.440]  the drug deals now what they're doing is against the law they're sending in the united states troops
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:29.600]  under one of their agency names to go fight these phony drug wars in countries around the globe
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:33.360]  and that's just to keep the prices up and knock out their competition one more call come back
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:37.360]  your call to the break but gerard's got to go here in a moment let's talk to sue in georgia
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:46.000]  you're on the air with gerard solente go ahead hi gerard um i'm sorry about what's happened to you
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:54.160]  but if it's any consolation i'm sure it's not um you're helping other people immensely sure no
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:58.320]  no that's his point he's not even talking about himself he's saying this shows that the wolves
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:08.480]  are getting bold well i understand that you are not a registered investment advisor so you can
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:18.960]  uh speak to what your friends are doing and i want to be very very clear um that they should be or
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:25.760]  are your friends we're almost out of time just real quick what's your question 401ks pay penalties
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:33.040]  pay taxes get everything out i can tell you there's a story in forbes magazine laura martin
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:40.000]  i believe it was 2009 she was my assistant at the time her company went bankrupt one of these uh
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:48.640]  bond companies and that are riot anyway she took all her money out of a 401k at that time
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:57.200]  gold was about 700 and something dollars an ounce and forbes made fun of her and me for being you
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:03.520]  know it was a fear thing that we did fearful investment and she more than doubled her money
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:11.200]  they said she overreacted now remember now her money is more than doubled so only speaking for
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:20.160]  myself i will not trust one penny anywhere because there's a biggest story and the biggest story is
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:28.240]  the devaluation of the dollar as the europeans print more as the americans print more the devaluation
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:36.800]  is going to continue so only speaking for myself gold mostly and silver as a hedge that's right
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.480]  and jim rogers said the same thing two nights ago on the show that so he thinks silver's even
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:44.560]  better because it hasn't moved up as much as gold ma'am i hope that answers your question sorry i
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.240]  was hurrying and we're just almost out of time i've already kept jerald longer than he said he

[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:56.720]  solutions i mean where do you see this going i think it's time for folks to get angry

[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:38.400]  time to look at quote direct democracy we have to take the power out of the hands of the 535
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:45.520]  gangsters that are telling 312 million of us how to tie our shoes and put it back in the
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:52.000]  hands of the people let the people run the country i'm sick of these politicians telling me they're

[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:57.040]  and societies media universities everybody's geared around facing a military threat
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.760]  we all know some weird leader in a uniform strutting around and screaming is bad news
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:10.960]  well these guys are little old ballheaded men who talk in weird financial languages designed
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:15.600]  their emails have all come out where they're cussing and laughing and calling a scum and
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:20.160]  recordings of it these idiots are by all this stuff we do we're stealing everything
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:26.000]  no that's what's going on behind the scenes but up front it's like the political analysis of the
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:32.400]  monetary inflection shows a moderate movement in several different directions on the upside and
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:40.560]  the low side in the cumulative two-year uh overriding derivatives market uh shows a strengthening
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:48.480]  in the second quarter if we continue growth and all other systems are not stagnant that the overall
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:54.960]  driver could show some concern by the third quarter if we do not move up in the systematic overlay
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:00.480]  system i mean just just total bull they're selling pure derivatives garbage to people
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:05.360]  they're coming in buying off your local politicians to raise big bonds and invest them in crud
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.920]  they're coming in and going it's for the earth for the earth taking property 20 000 acres plus
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:15.520]  in austin years later handing it over to the big banks to build on some of the farmers outside
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.320]  austin wouldn't sell their property they actually sent the swat teams out there and got on bull horns
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:25.440]  a decade ago or more and said come out come out maybe like extremists won't leave their property
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:31.200]  it's for the earth a biosphere five years later they go we're taking the biosphere off and selling
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:37.200]  it to the former mayor's best friends that contributed here's the 300 million in property for five
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:43.040]  million it's yours thank you now the former mayor will set up a bank that gets all the business deals
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:50.320]  and they're like well they're letting us do this start taking the bank accounts don't like it swat
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:56.800]  teams are standing by by the way if you get too uppity al-qaeda might hit you know al-qaeda could
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00.640]  hit any minute we have to take all your rides and have to grab your wife's genitals and your
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:11.280]  children's genitals and your genitals because if we don't if we don't it's all over you see
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:15.680]  because al-qaeda will get us now i want to get into the financial news i want to get into all
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.880]  this other crazy news continue with your phone calls i want to do what we did yesterday again
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:25.120]  that was fun giving each caller 30 seconds and then myself only 10 because we got to a lot of people
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:36.320]  800 259 92 31 1 800 259 92 31 people ask why do i know so much people ask why do i predict
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:43.920]  things so accurately what has every historian and philosopher said in different ways old wise men
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:50.960]  if from every culture if you don't study history you are going to be a slave if you don't study
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:56.320]  history you're doomed to repeat it great wisdom comes with studying human history because humans
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:01.600]  do the same things over and over again i back when i had time it's one of the few things i miss
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:06.080]  because i read so many news articles so many documents that by the time i'm done working at
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:10.560]  seven eight nine o'clock at night some nights even later i cannot read history books anymore
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:16.160]  my eyes if i do or bloodshot the next day and and i actually get eye strain i just can't do it
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:23.840]  anymore i can't do it but up until just a few years ago i would read a history book every week
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:30.800]  read a couple chapters going to bed and humans act the same over and over again i know every
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:36.800]  globalist trick inside and out because they study history they've just reworked every other game plan
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:43.280]  every other blueprint i know them because i know humanity i know the species i know the good i know
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:50.320]  the bad i know the ugly i know my shelf and i know the enemy the average person grew up
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.480]  got hardly any schooling if they did it was my numbing garbage and they just learned how to
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:01.920]  do a specialized task they go hate that task all day the beginning of degradation of the mind is
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:08.720]  not liking your work and then they just want to go blow their mind on sports drugs alcohol whatever
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.360]  it is when they get off work and i don't blame people you know you worked all day at some job
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:16.960]  you hate you want to go spend that time you got you know you let your kids run wild because you
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:22.560]  want a few hours and the tv's they're creating the new culture we don't have a culture anymore
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:27.680]  you notice political correctness attacks every culture and then pushes the plastic corporate
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:34.880]  culture which is an anti-human culture in all their textbooks by design because humanity
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:44.000]  and goodness is not compatible with the new world order but if we ever rediscover being men being
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:52.960]  women if we ever just rediscover the normal proper roles if we ever rediscover what it's all about
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:02.720]  it's pure milk and honey life is great this is a beautiful planet every moment is a gift
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:08.880]  every day a blessing god has laid out so many wonderful things for us it's an incredible
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:16.400]  the world is so beautiful and so good and so full of electric life and energy and
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:26.720]  magic that that's why i hate evil that's why i hate corruption because i hate pain i hate
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:33.120]  sickness i hate those that wish to vandalize beauty those that wish to attack goodness
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.280]  those who wish to dominate the week
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:47.520]  i have a overriding desire to energize and set bushfires in the minds of good men and women
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:55.440]  and see you rise together and we will crush evil with god's help we will absolutely overdrive it
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:02.000]  and annihilate it and then a great time of blessing will come and then our grandchildren
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.720]  will become decadent again and evil will creep back in and people say oh the old timers they say
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:11.200]  fight corruption put up with no forms of corruption because they don't want you to have a good time
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:17.200]  let us not forget what we've been through over and over again we've been through all this over
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:22.240]  and over again over and over and over and over again it goes on and on and on but now because
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:27.280]  of the high-tech weapons and systems we can't go through this again we're not going to make it
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.760]  if we go through this again
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:36.000]  now they've taught through the globalist churches the last 150 years that it's the end
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.520]  of the world every five minutes and there's no reason to fight evil because god's coming back
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:43.600]  even if god was coming back in five minutes it's our responsibility to fight evil or god's
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:49.920]  going to say he knows it's not and even don't believe in god my point is it's a giant scapegoat
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:55.440]  and i've gone over it i've had experts on show where the globalist funded this where the Illuminati
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:00.480]  funded the idea that the end of the world's always coming so why fight evil roman's 13 all that
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:05.760]  well i could quote the bible to you all day none of us hundred year reprieve the list goes on and on
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:12.960]  the times israel did repent and was spared and blessed and warned over and over again it's a
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:19.680]  lie that everything is set in stone it's set in stone in the vision of the creator but god
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:25.280]  then lets us make the decisions on this plane about which way we go it's almost like
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  ever seen those children's books that came out in the 80s i know i read them where where there's
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:37.680]  like two or three different outcomes depending on how you read the book you see you see the books
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:44.240]  written every one of those possible realities is in the mind of the creator like a crystal but
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:55.120]  like a hologram but we free will decide so things are predestined but they're not you see that's
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:01.840]  the riddle that's three four five dimensional thinking and it doesn't matter because the body
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:07.760]  and all of this is is transitory fear not here you can kill the body fear here you can kill the soul
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:13.680]  the globalists don't want money they use us to get they use that to get us to to sell out
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:19.600]  they they use that as their false form of energy that's actually just a symbol that they get us
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:24.320]  to sell out for that they control society the globalists at the end of the day are obsessed
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:29.520]  with your mind they are obsessed with your intellect they are obsessed with how you're
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:36.000]  raised and what you believe they traffic as revelation says in the souls of men in fact my
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:41.280]  uncle gave me a bible verse and wrote it down about they they they kill souls they destroy
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:46.400]  from I think Ezekiel and I had it in here last week and I guess it got taken out I lost it I
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.680]  was going to read it but it was another passage it said the same thing the point is even if you
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:54.960]  don't believe the bible it's history it's people've seen the same things we've gone through the same
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:00.400]  things it's happened over and over again now I'm going to get into the economy a little bit here
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:03.760]  and then I'm going to get into you can't make this up and I think her how to send this to
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:09.040]  drudge because this is pretty pretty powerful DOJ says make it a federal crime to lie on the
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:17.200]  internet but they'll decide what's a lie the liar of liars the king of liars this system will tell
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.640]  us what a lie is and you've heard them they said if you don't believe in man make global warming
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:26.640]  and don't want to pay Al Gore money you should be arrested that's the White House regulations are
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:30.640]  coming up with this stuff coming up with this new regulation this is Cass Sunstein
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.800]  going to cover that
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:40.480]  super congress has now decided the new farming bill in secret not the regular congress but the
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:48.560]  appointed high court of satan I don't know 12 people with a 13th head don't you see all the
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:55.040]  Illuminati stuff in your face 12 disciples Christ the 13th oh boy these people are out of control
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:01.840]  let's go ahead and go to Ted Anderson here on the economy well you heard Gerald Salenta
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:06.880]  earlier what he's doing and he was taking delivery of his six figures plus of gold and they just
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:12.480]  said we're taking it now that's a big national news story the whole markets are melting down
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:18.480]  Bank of America is getting ready to go to the public for 79 trillion in derivatives
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:24.320]  folks that the entire budgets of this country's not even you know one tenth of that
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:32.960]  that in the military budget is is a trillion 800 billion on budget off budget supplemental
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:38.080]  I mean we're talking about a joke here and they're going to convince you somehow you owe it then
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:42.720]  say well the public needs to pay their fair share the America got lazy America deserves it
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:47.120]  and the public's like I guess I've got to have my taxes raised and live in a shack because
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:51.920]  America owes you know this is the stuff for Bank of America this globalist company financing
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:56.960]  open borders anti-gun movements new world order garbage fellow reserve shareholders
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:02.400]  Ted Anderson what do you make of Gerald Salenta in your 34 years in golden silver brokering to have
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:08.720]  the the the company he was involved with bought up by MF global and then they seized his private
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:14.080]  account with over six figures in it and at first people didn't believe this now it's in
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:19.200]  Bloomberg AP everywhere they're going yeah it looks like it's illegal they took people's private
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:24.400]  accounts Ted what does this signify to Ted Anderson well Alex I think we're going to see a lot more
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:28.240]  of that kind of thing I mean I've been warning that about that for quite some time here I mean
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:34.080]  the United States is becoming desperate and so the corporations that are you know
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:40.240]  that are sort of in the uh too big to fails category for the United States I mean they're
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:44.960]  going to be doing more of that kind of thing and it doesn't surprise me a bit that they're trying
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:50.160]  to do that so now Gerald has taken physical delivery of gold and silver I can't think of a
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:56.320]  better thing to do people you just have to realize that if you're putting your money into an institution
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:01.040]  and these institutions are in such great trouble what do you think is going to happen I mean the
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:05.440]  government's going to come in and they're going to ask for bailouts but part of this is you know
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:11.600]  just to nationalize and to be able to grab a hold of and seize these assets they can't do that when
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:16.720]  you have physical gold and silver when you own it they don't control it that's why it's such a good
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:21.600]  idea to do this Alex people are you know they're just they're going to see more of this it happened
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:26.800]  in Argentina it happened in Brazil certainly happened during the Weimar Republic in Germany
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:31.040]  I mean you were lucky to be able to get out of that country the only way you were able to get out
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:35.200]  is if you have physical assets something that you could actually put your hands on if you had
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:43.440]  gold coins or silver coins or if you had diamonds or emeralds or anything even a even a 916th wrench
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:48.000]  would be more valuable than the paper currency and I'm just watching what's going on in Europe
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:54.080]  I mean Spanish bonds are going into the toilet the European governments Italy and Greece you know
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:57.920]  that Ted I want to get to that in a moment but I want to point something out here people keep asking
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:04.160]  how are we always right how do we know Greece was going to go down and and in Ireland and and and
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:10.400]  then Italy and then Spain because the globalist planned it it's a playbook they've done it all
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:17.520]  over the third world all over Eastern Europe we got the documents 11 years ago 2002 I guess 10 years
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:22.800]  ago where they said that they would do all this I've been screaming bloody murder every day since
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:27.680]  then I told you they'd announce a bank of the world that it would be dictatorial and Time Magazine
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:35.280]  says banker Goldman Sachs coup Goldman Sachs rules Europe like it's good technocrats get rid of freedom
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:41.040]  and I'm and the media is like yeah actual Wall Street folks are we've got power they've shined
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:46.240]  on to like a new Nazi party don't you idiots get it and they're going to blame capitalism for all
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:52.720]  this I mean Ted we've been right about this because it's historical what's happening that's really
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:58.880]  what's going on Alex it's just a repeat of history you know what what what has happened in the past
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.760]  is what our current government is trying to do to solve problems when they're jumping to the printing
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:08.720]  press when they're seizing assets like Gerald is talking about I mean that's the direction where
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:13.600]  this country is heading we're going away from liberty we're going away from freedom we're going
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:19.040]  away from property rights and the individuals right and it's premeditated Ted they're following
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:25.120]  they want total collapse they don't want people to have confidence in the systems anymore this is
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:30.640]  the end if we let these crooks get away with they are so bold people I believe in gold and silver
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:34.240]  I've been recommending silver since it was five dollars gold since it was 260 something
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:40.160]  gold and silver are rising they can drive it down short term but as I said months ago when they did
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:44.800]  I said that when it's lower is a buying opportunity now it's gone back up because globally they're
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:51.040]  devaluing currencies globally this is happening Ted Anderson's got the golden silver on hand
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:56.000]  he will ship it directly to you that's why I'm hooked up with this company Ted briefly is we're
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  about to go to break them and come back with calls tell folks about your spectrum of specials
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.640]  the radio specials that again this is gold you bought in the last month you ran out of the stuff
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:09.440]  you bought two months ago so you're buying it at a lower price Ted doesn't raise prices as the market
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:15.680]  goes up he locks it in and gives you that saving Ted give folks the lost leaders for the day yeah
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:19.680]  sure I mean let's talk about I mean real quick we're still offering the video and book deal
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:24.400]  I think there's about 500 copies of that book left and then it's done we're not going to have any more
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.040]  two silver dollars book video the silver dollars that cost with the free book video and shipping
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:34.640]  500 of those left that'll go probably buy it next week yeah 73 dollars a piece you I mean you just
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:38.960]  can't beat that deal with two silver dollars the book and the video that explains what's going on
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:44.640]  in our economy and the book you know it just it's a great deal put together we have Frank's
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:51.120]  currently right now a 386 walking liberties are at 1658 all this stuff is for physical delivery
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:56.720]  I still think it's a good idea to take a look at the older $10 liberties they're at 1,050 right now
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:01.920]  there's just a lot of things that are that are in that right buying range right now I mean I
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:08.080]  saw a little bit of a decrease in gold today it hit down to as low as 1752 10 and then it came
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:14.720]  racing right back up again and right now we're at 1778 you know I try to buy in those little dips
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:20.080]  there they're just I mean the the opportunities to be able to accumulate a good quantity of
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:26.800]  good material to sell is it's just getting harder to do there's just not as much material to go
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:33.440]  around nowadays and shortages and supply drive up premiums and that's just the way the market's

[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:44.640]  gerald solente's interview last night with us uh very very powerful powerful information and info
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:50.960]  wars dot com and this just shows how ruthless they are now because people are complaining they
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:57.040]  say they might give people some of their money back and no it's it's not insured well as they
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:00.880]  bankrupt the other big banks and systems they're just going to insure it by printing more money
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:04.560]  and that's what's happening in europe that's what's happening here that's why inflation is going up
[01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:09.280]  as the real economy depresses i'm going to go to your calls here the folks that are patiently
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:16.880]  holding here in just a moment mike and others but briefly uh ted final comments uh on this i mean
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:22.320]  how big of a deal is this for you uh to see the former new jersey governor a little darling of
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:29.360]  the establishment running this operation well i mean again you have major institutions that
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:34.800]  are in trouble this is this is one institution that's failing alex and and to have the corruption
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:39.920]  that you're seeing i mean you're just you're scratching the surface on what's actually going on
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:44.240]  out there in the in the financial community and there's going to be more of this going on and it's
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:50.480]  going to affect the people that are invested in stocks bonds mutual funds i mean you name it all
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:56.800]  these institutional type investments are at risk because of this type of activity and just the
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:02.560]  very fact that the united states dollar has been printed to solve our economic issues is a big
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:07.280]  problem in of itself and then you add in these institutions that are crumbling and falling
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:12.560]  apart and the corruption that goes along with it it's no surprise to me at all that people are
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:16.960]  diversifying into gold and they should be and they should be taking physical delivery of it
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:22.800]  the reason why that is is because you can't mess with this stuff it is the real value it's been
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:28.400]  holding value for six thousand years it's not attached to these absolutely and that's what

[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:30.080]  him um but i had a story 10 years ago i became a day trader part time in the late 90s and the uh
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:36.560]  which you often bring up the illegitimate family courts my goodness they created a different department
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:42.640]  property execution department in there and my checks never made it there on time by time
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:48.480]  the notification mail up to our state capital and information was transferred down to this
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:53.760]  department new york state created anyways make a long story short they restrained all my checking
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:59.200]  accounts banking accounts spending my driver's license i i mean it goes on endless but at that
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:04.640]  time i had six figures close to half million dollars as a day trader in the stock market
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:10.640]  and what they did to me prior to right before 9 11 just restrain my account and it wasn't for a
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:16.720]  couple weeks or just take the money out of the accounts but they restrain them for eight months
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:22.400]  and virtually i lost 450 thousand dollars in that time hold on i gotta hear more about this incredible
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:27.120]  i've seen these reports and again sounds good make the deadbeat dads pay the child support
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.120]  or but notice the moms never have to but but the issue is then they set up grids to shut down all

[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:27.200]  texas alex jones all right we're into hour number three thank you for joining us i have massive
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:31.600]  tons of key news we're gonna cover today first i want to continue to go into about your calls
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:38.080]  because you always bring up interesting points news and information take drill salenta he had
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:43.520]  more than six figures coming to him it was in his account but he was also trading in gold futures
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:48.080]  and so that messes up all his other positions now they're saying there's no money in his account
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:51.680]  and so that's going to damage him that way he told me last night on air
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:56.080]  and mike brings up that for eight months because the checks didn't get to the right
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:00.720]  department i've seen this in the news too where where they won't process the child support payments
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:06.720]  right that the government takes and then they penalize you where i've seen cases of where
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.800]  a father even has custody and the wife in another state decides to go ahead and go get
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:16.320]  lie and say she needs child support and then they'll they'll give it to her it's all part of
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:20.480]  breaking up the family and you can always find some deadbeat examples of dads but that's like
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:25.680]  taking people's kids because they're you know poor and then giving them to cps who's the most abusive
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:29.680]  group out there it's like well you might be a problem guilt's end up rivet innocent so we'll
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:33.840]  just give you to a group of known perverts and then scumbags here here you know who's on record
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:38.400]  being a bunch of pedophiles but you know here it is but but mike if you just tuned in was telling
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:44.160]  the story for eight months he had six hundred thousand dollars in the account i think he said
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:49.600]  of day trading he'd done a really great job and they just restrained it so that he couldn't make
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:56.000]  decisions and it all went to hades in a handbasket and that's what's happening to society and then
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:01.760]  business isn't safe to conduct and your society collapses because nobody trusts anybody this
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:06.880]  is being done by design to create a post industrial world the bankers are stealing all the money and
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:11.440]  assets in the process of destroying the free market they will then blame the free market
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:16.160]  for wrecking everything and offer communism as the answer as the bankers sit offshore
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:22.960]  that's the new world order in essence mike in new york uh finish your story yeah you're correct
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:28.640]  alexa just uh mentioned a couple other um things that go with that i mean tripled your
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:35.360]  insurance rates uh the bank uh charged me uh with each bounce check besides the regular
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:42.320]  30 dollar fee a hundred dollar legal fee besides that let me change the subject a little bit and
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:47.600]  bring back another highlight that i learned from you maybe four or five years ago and that was a
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:53.520]  comprehensive annual financial report and i looked and dug deep into it in my county where i live
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:03:01.360]  and i spoke with the county exec uh the assistant anyways to the county exec and uh just to remind
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:08.080]  your listeners out there uh the comprehensive financial report uh just list the uh incomes
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:13.840]  and and expenditures for each county throughout the united states and typically speaking uh the
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:20.320]  point that you raise a gentleman you add on and i think you even uh did a video uh a short video
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:26.560]  with that is uh of course we have sales tax and property taxes but the third um the appointment
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:34.240]  uh thing was that uh each county you know has between 100 and maybe three or 400 million dollars
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:39.680]  that they invest and that's basically the main job of the county executives reinvest every year
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:44.480]  but do they never put that on the budget and then they basically end up siphoning it off it's a giant
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:49.920]  double set of books they actually learned it from al capone the chicago 1313 model that adopted by
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:55.120]  the u.s government and and we cover it in the comprehensive annual financial reports exposed
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:04:00.560]  dvd which is one of the 18 films you get with the everything special i should add we're only
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:05.360]  running till christmas of 99 bucks get them all but yeah i tell you that's what's dangerous about
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.520]  this cashless society they can take your money they can shut your accounts off for no reason
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:14.240]  they can also now with this cashless system not let you use your money to buy or sell
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:17.920]  they can track everything you're doing they can put all these new fines and fees on it
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:24.800]  and the cashless society is about the bankers being able to absolutely rob you and there's
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:30.720]  nothing you can do with the rate of returns anymore throughout the country i i think that's
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:35.440]  going to be a critical number that's going to be missed and you're going to damage municipalities

[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:24.080]  everything now and they're going wild and they don't like us on air talking about them so they're
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:30.320]  talking about censorship right now now before i go to joe and everybody else that's holding i
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:37.440]  want to do a program note here i'll be doing the show live friday maybe even sunday and then monday
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:42.560]  tuesday but i'm going to be out of town so i'm going to be doing it from the road via video skype
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:46.400]  erin dykes will be here waiting in the wings there's any technical problems he can pop in
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:52.560]  but erin is doing the show by himself tomorrow erin dykes who also from time to time does a great
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:58.560]  job hosting in full wars nightly news i'll be filing reports from the road that'll be aired here
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:04.320]  i'll be filing reports from the road separate from the skype interviews and the skype broadcast
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:11.200]  to the radio network uh for the nightly news as well and i've decided before next year starts
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:16.160]  and i start traveling to our am and f m affiliates and doing speaking engagements and broadcasting
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:21.680]  from their studios and i'm going to do a quick trip to the southwest and up into those areas
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:33.120]  because in 2000 in 2000 well in 1997 i traveled to some of the national parks and would just
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:38.240]  politely ask about the un marker saying it was un property they would blow up and freak out on us
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:45.040]  so i thought that i would go and revisit america destroyed by design and illustrate where we are
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:50.080]  14 years later from my first film and we're going to shoot a special report on that but there'll be

[02:10:54.320 --> 02:11:01.040]  the radio but then i'll also put together a big report when i get back so that is all coming up

[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:17.680]  report in the first hour live but also airing excerpts of last night's special truly revealing
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:22.960]  kim trails with all the documents how they do it the patents the the declassified documents

[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:34.880]  the first hour with erin bringing in even more information we didn't get to last night
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:44.080]  then we're going to have a fema camp breakdown homeland security national security state uh
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:52.560]  john warner defense authorization act governor's council rural affairs takeover piece that'll be
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:58.720]  the entire second hour and then erin has guest in the third and i'll undoubtedly call in sometime
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:04.160]  tomorrow as well and follow some reports show tomorrow a very special broadcast that i'll
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:11.760]  host the entire three hours uh on friday show that is all coming up tomorrow please spread the word
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:21.200]  about it let's go ahead and go to your phone calls let's go ahead and talk to joe in california go
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:32.480]  ahead joe hey joe how you doing my friend okay joe's gone let's talk to garrett mississippi
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:38.240]  garrett you're on the air hey alex how you doing man good my friend i had a long time no see but i
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:43.920]  just wanted to make a statement about silver and gold i started buying it back when you told us
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:49.920]  14 years ago and pick up five dollars here and you know there now well i'm giving this as a
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:57.440]  cautionary statement anybody out there get your money out of the system now put it in the silver
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:03.360]  because as it's right now sitting at 35 my my statistical analysis we're looking at 65 by
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:10.320]  you know first quarter next year well i know this it hasn't moved up as much via inflation as gold
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:16.480]  gold in my gut and this is my personal opinion it's still a really safe move but it's it's gotten
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:24.800]  closer to its bubble than silver and jim roger and others agree silver is the way to go if you do buy
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:31.040]  gold it's what tell people to buy is 10 ounces because it is easier to transfer into smaller
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:36.720]  quantities just like in ross book a guy had a corvette for sale for two you know two fifty
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:43.040]  dollar gold pieces you know it's too big but people gotta realize and the people it's gonna hurt when
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:48.960]  this stuff goes down it's people like my parents don't fix 10 cups you know get your money out of
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:55.760]  the bank the only thing i use a bank for is to pay my bills anything left over goes in the safe as
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:02.000]  greenbacks or i you know i got i keep you know catch a special like mitis puts out something like
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:08.320]  that but but alex i appreciate taking my collar on t this folks have got to get prepared the snow
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:14.240]  ball is rolling downhill if it wasn't for you it would have happened about 10 years ago all right
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:19.920]  and um everybody out there get the information out you know forget about christmas this year
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:27.200]  uh get your pantries full get your cartridge boxes filled up and just get ready for the storm
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:32.240]  is coming probably next year well i agree with you and and you know if somehow we make it out of
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:37.360]  this without a total collapse good then we were prepared you know you've got insurance just in case
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:44.000]  you know something bad happens but unfortunately more and more it looks like it it runs from bad
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:50.720]  to worse the best case scenario is long stagnating depression worst cases road warrior collapse and
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:57.680]  we're so decadent spoiled on average now people are so out of it on average uh that it i mean
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:02.080]  that's what you got to worry about in the collapse is the zombie like population throwing fits
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:07.760]  and all the family and people even if they're awake where are they going to get food where
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:13.760]  are they going to get money uh i mean again folks you don't need just food and money for yourself
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:17.360]  you need to be able to get ready to take care of those in-laws and people because even though
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:23.280]  they laugh at you and stuff they're going to end up asking for help and uh and i don't even know
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:26.480]  people laugh at you too much you might not want to help them because they'll they'll get in your
[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:30.400]  house while you're helping them and say they saw something illegal make it up and call the cops to
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:37.520]  move into your house i mean the yuppies are deadly they will serve evil until the end and i'm not
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:42.160]  talking about my in-laws but i'm guessing that some people's in-laws and and and people who are
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:46.960]  into this world they are into it and they're going to hold on to it forever and no amount of
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:52.960]  trendingness is going to protect them i understand trendingness is fine it's really just a brainwashing
[02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:58.400]  of the establishment of false worth and i feel sorry for these people anything else
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:07.040]  um garret yes sir you if you recall i went through katrina the aftermath of it if we got
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:13.120]  to depend on the federal government to come down there to to help us in this uh coming economic
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:19.120]  storm you can forget about it it took them two weeks to mobilize to even think about doing
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:24.000]  something the people that did stuff for us in south mississippi when i was living down there
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:29.280]  was the ohio national guard they loaded up the trucks with mre's and water and they came on
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:34.960]  their own accord the federal government is just a bunch of yahoo's and if ron paul doesn't get
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:41.440]  elected next year katie barredor i hear you god bless you i appreciate you and they had fires
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:46.640]  all over texas femen would block other fire departments and people from helping and i had
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:51.120]  i have a friend who manages one of the biggest department complexes and she went down to give
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:55.600]  them free apartment complexes for six months and fema wooden said we don't want your help even though
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:17:01.600]  they saw people that needed help it's just all about a federal power grab it's just this government
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:08.960]  is run by a bunch of rats uh johnny in canada you're on the air go ahead you uh do you think it you

[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:20.080]  i was a study by a student of history i began to read what governments were putting out about
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:28.080]  a global government the end of families a cashless society bankrupting everybody uh forced abortion
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:34.880]  and i was like man this is hardcore authoritarianism i want to fight this they were trying to pass all
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:41.520]  sorts of gun vans restricting guns in texas they were property grabbing uh they were doing it
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:47.360]  nationally and i said i'm gonna stand up against these people and in 17 years seems like a long
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:56.320]  time that is just a flash in the pan a twinkling of the eye in the scheme of time and think of how
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:00.720]  much america's changed in 17 years just since i got in the fight ladies and gentlemen you're
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:06.080]  going to see more change down the next five than we've seen the last 50 and it's not going to be
[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:12.640]  for the good i mean the system has done this consciously and the realization that vicious
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:21.200]  wicked people who want to do bad are in control now old timers always knew that the founding
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:25.760]  fathers said that and they try to train cops in these training seminars and stuff that you know
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:30.240]  we're dangerous we're crazy you know those that talk about government being big and dangerous
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:35.600]  that they're bad like the founding fathers i mean i have that on video fema teaching police that
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:39.360]  and the cops believe it a lot of them they're like the people talking about freedom in the
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:46.560]  constitution they're the ones that blew up oklahoma city yeah right that was bill clinton's people so
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:53.840]  this isn't a game this isn't a game and all of you that thought you'd sit on the bench
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:58.000]  you'd sit on the sidelines you stay out of the fight you're the ones they're going to gobble
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:03.920]  on first and those of you that serve the evil from my historical study you are in the most
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:09.360]  dangerous position there is the system eats its own more often than any other group
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:14.640]  all right going back to al and then others al finish up your point

[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:12.320]  for a hunt for what 200 years they had that you know that they developed a lot of the
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:17.760]  systems were under tavas talk institute all of it that and and other scientists out of europe in the

[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:28.560]  guy in a hitler outfit who y'all there's the enemy beat him this is a system where they
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:34.320]  scientifically study us and as you said try to bring down the species itself it is a
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:41.520]  rewriting of humanity it is a final revolution of absolute pit of hell evil this i mean this is
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:49.680]  unspeakable end of humanity as we know it if they win i mean this is absolute it can only be satan

[02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:35.440]  negative i'm trying to be honest and see the globalist you can have 300 something thousand
[02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:39.680]  people die from bad drug interactions every year the media doesn't really report it so nobody's
[02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:46.240]  worried about it uh you can have a 3000 increase in most forms of cancer in the last 30 years
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:51.920]  media has it as a footnote so people aren't worried about it you can have governments
[02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:57.760]  stealing bank accounts and other things media doesn't make a big deal out of it nobody cares
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:02.640]  but they start hyperventilating about terrorist attacking and you got a better chance of being
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:09.440]  killed by honey bees or snake bites or whatever it's way down the list of dangers but it's so much
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:17.280]  fun to get scared and hate the foreigner i mean it's all manipulation and then you look at who's
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:22.880]  actually funding al-qaeda and it's the globalists the same banks that run us and it's hidden right
[02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:29.680]  there and a lot of good old boys they don't really care about america as long as they can hate arabs
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:34.480]  that's all they want the government could take everything from them their children their lives
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:44.480]  as long as they could hate arabs they're happy of course they ever actually met the average
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:49.040]  arab they'd like them it's pretty much like a middle eastern redneck or something but it doesn't
[02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:55.440]  matter that's what they want is that tribalism because five thousand years ago if you didn't
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:59.760]  stick with your tribe when it was under attack your tribe didn't survive it is one of the strongest
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:06.960]  instincts i i get it my country right or wrong al-qaeda hit us murder every brown person they did it
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:15.040]  and that is why we failed and now they're going with tribalism with all these tv ads where every
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:20.480]  terrorist is white middle-aged conservative white male or woman and the minorities like it just as
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:24.080]  much they've been taught white he's out to get them white he's been caught taught they're out to get
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:28.640]  them and now they'll first they teach whitey the brown people are terrorists give your rights up to
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:33.760]  get them okay get the brown people even if you're not even racist it's more of a tribalism then they've
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:37.840]  gone to the brown people okay now it's whitey they're like all right i understand why he's a terrorist
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:43.600]  now you're talking now see everybody's a terrorist and we have this article in fact i don't think we

[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:12.960]  and then the last 40 years they did psychological tests to not hire tough guys like they used to

[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:45.680]  scott in kentucky you're on the air go ahead hey alex your true american patriot and humanity's
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:49.920]  best friend well thank you i'm just trying to survive though brother but thank you go ahead
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:55.680]  hey i have a question in a couple comments i've been trying to figure out if something is true so
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:00.560]  i had framed this question in a way that if it is all you have to do that to guess or no no no for
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:10.000]  sure are you under a gag order to not mention anything about the nissera law no no well i i
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:17.200]  talked to court about this uh during the money bomb and um there's a movie uh uh documentary on youtube
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:24.640]  called changes on the horizon and it's uh quite interesting i highly recommend you watch that
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:29.440]  and then kind of report and do some research i'm trying to figure out if it's true or not now i can
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:34.560]  tell you right now nissera is not real it's been around 15 years they always say there's a secret
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:40.720]  group a reorganization america that's going to fix everything and that's a globalist dis info that
[02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:46.240]  good people pick up and repeat so that when they reorganize america people will believe that that's
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:54.400]  nissera this is a planted kind of missionary and protectorate type plan where they pre plant the
[02:42:54.400 --> 02:43:00.800]  legends so that people then accept them once it's announced so it's just like the infiltration of
[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:07.760]  christianity and planting false doctrine so people stand down i'm but listen i've been under one
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:14.240]  gag order and i told people i was under a gag order that was uh a week before the obama deception
[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:19.040]  was set to come out the fbi showed up here asking about the obama deception well they asked about
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:23.120]  it over the phone then they showed up and i said what's this about and they said here's the federal
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:30.720]  court order we want these particular ip addresses here's the court order had my lawyer checked
[02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:36.400]  it uh and they wanted about obama deception these ip addresses then i i went on air and i said the fbi
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:41.120]  was here but it's a gag order and then the dis info said i was lying and you know that i was making
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:45.840]  it up to promote obama deception then six months later it came out in the associated press gag
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:49.840]  order was lifted i guess it was lifted because then it was in the associated press that some
[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:55.120]  idiot listener was saying kill cops and giving the home address of the cop that shot the guy in the
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:44:01.040]  back and tried to cover it up out in san francisco on the uh train platform and i mean he gave his
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:05.760]  name everything and it turned out he'd been in some crazy trouble before i probably not not not all
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:11.680]  there and uh but the cops were using it as an excuse you know why do you got posters of obama up on
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:15.280]  the wall and i was like well that's for promotion of the new movie coming out really you promote
[02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:19.360]  things in here and go yeah i shoot video in front of it and i said and then they were trying to ask
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:22.960]  my employees questions and i said they'll twist it to say you're lying to them don't answer their
[02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:27.920]  questions i said the government it's drug dealers and murderers and ships guns into mexico and the
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:32.080]  fbi guys were looking at me like this you had an austin cop with him a detective and that guy was
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:36.800]  playing good cop with me and all this crud if they were to look at little children little they had the
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:41.680]  eyes of five-year-olds they were weak i wanted to see life in them in liberty instead they were like
[02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:46.720]  little children here and here's your gag order and all this crud and some other fbi guy called me
[02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:51.360]  the next day now don't talk about it don't say anything it was something so they were using
[02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:57.280]  one thing as an excuse to let me think it was about another and it didn't matter because it did turn
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:02.080]  into hype for obama deception i came out and said film isn't exactly ready but we're going to go
[02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:06.240]  ahead and release it a couple days early because the fbi was just here and everybody went crazy
[02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:11.360]  so it got more views than any other film ever put out for free online it's over 35 million last time
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:17.040]  i counted them all up you know one video alone has nine and a half million and uh you know and they
[02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:21.920]  were trying to intimidate us at first and i just started basically you know not yelling at them but
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:26.560]  just going the government is criminal i go you don't know i you know i looked at the fbi people i
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:31.280]  said you don't know you work for criminal government they're like no i don't know that i go yes you do
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:36.560]  and they were like look we just want to get out of here now uh so but no i'm not under a gag order
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:43.760]  is that answer question yes sir and couple comments i have is uh uh g ever gruffin's got a couple

[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:22.240]  you hear me yes sir hey um just wanted to call and uh let you know about the the conference we had
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:28.960]  at chattanooga uh university of tennessee chattanooga with architects and engineers uh basically it
[02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:36.000]  was spending room only um the students were doing it for extra credit and uh they had a debate um
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:43.360]  had an engineer there that uh apparently didn't do his homework because he was easily uh put in
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:51.520]  this place uh when he tried to debunk the whole 9 11 theory um but basically i'm a weird change of
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:58.640]  tennessee and you know if we get more weird change groups across the country and and get a
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:05.200]  network going more and more and especially internationally and have a couple people in
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:10.800]  each weird change group represent architects and engineers sure you can call it whatever you want
[02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:16.160]  but political activism exposing the globalist crimes that's the key great idea i want to jam
[02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:19.760]  in everybody here because i've got to do a tv interview after this i've got to end here in
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:26.400]  just a moment uh let's talk to otter and mass otter you're on the air go ahead hey you broke

[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:41.360]  jerobe my god um i like the idea you had in a recent show about ip addresses and the feedback
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:47.360]  that you get i read a lot of the feedback on the info wars page and a lot of the disinformationists
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:52.000]  and the multiple posts and maybe multiple individuals yeah i need to do a report on that
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:56.400]  showing how it'll be one ip address with 20 different names having fake conversations with
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:01.680]  themselves to create false consensus and a lot of times they don't even shield the ip's they go to
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:08.480]  governments think tanks pr firms and uh i don't know some kind of software programs i believe
[02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:14.720]  it seems like uh i see a number of these across the internet yeah they call them sock puppets the
[02:58:14.720 --> 02:58:19.440]  pentagon runs those and they attack anything pro america while the pentagon wraps itself in the
[02:58:19.440 --> 02:58:25.200]  american flag all day good grief so oklahoma city was the other thought i had i'm wondering why
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:32.640]  there hasn't been more of like nine eleven change and uh nine eleven was an inside job why more
[02:58:32.640 --> 02:58:38.320]  haven't uh because that happened before the true awakening the government sponsored terror began
