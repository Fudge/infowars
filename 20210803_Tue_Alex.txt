[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:50.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowar and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:50.000 --> 01:01.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  This is being called a pandemic among the unvaccinated.
[01:04.000 --> 01:11.000]  This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  This is an epidemic that's occurring in the unvaccinated.
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  We're seeing a pandemic among the unvaccinated.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  Pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:25.000 --> 01:31.000]  We have a pandemic among a non-vaccinated.
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  We have a pandemic because of the unvaccinated.
[01:34.000 --> 01:43.000]  We could have had this under control. We were well on our way and the only people that you can blame, the only people you can blame, this isn't shaming, this is the truth.
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  Maybe they should be shamed by the unvaccinated.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  We've got to shun folks. We've got to shun people into getting vaccinated.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  We need to shun those that refuse to get vaccinated.
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.000]  The unvaccinated people have put us in the position that we're in now and it is not a good place.
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated and they're killing people.
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  Just 36% of the people in this county are vaccinated.
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.000]  Every seat is full, no social distancing or masks.
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  It's stupid, dangerous and stupid.
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  You've got to start telling people if you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this office or this place of business.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come to work.
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this gym.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this, get onto this airplane.
[02:35.000 --> 02:41.000]  If you don't choose to get vaccinated, you may not come to work.
[02:41.000 --> 02:51.000]  You may not have access to a situation where you're going to put my grandchildren in jeopardy, where you might kill them.
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.000]  We're going to do a major vaccination drive for kids 12 years old and up.
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.000]  Grandparents, call your grandkids. Tell them they are vaccinated.
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  Put them on a bus and bring them to a mass vaccination site.
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  There's nothing to do with freedom. There's nothing to do with liberty.
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  You don't have the freedom and the liberty to put other people in jeopardy.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  You really need to get vaccinated.
[03:12.000 --> 03:20.000]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion. I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[03:20.000 --> 03:27.000]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion. Take the vaccine.
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  Put some rules in place that will demand that people get vaccinated.
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.000]  We try voluntary. The voluntary phase is over.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  It's time for mandates because it's the only way to protect our people.
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  Every day more businesses are implementing their own vaccine mandates.
[03:44.000 --> 03:51.000]  The Justice Department has made it clear that it is legal to require COVID-19 vaccines.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  And then I think a lot of people are going to expect that businesses will be mandating vaccines.
[03:56.000 --> 04:04.000]  It's time for us to reinstate some of these masking mandates while in the meantime, ideally aiming for proof of vaccination
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  so that we can really boost our vaccination numbers.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  It's time to impose some requirements based on the realities of different risks,
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.000]  unvaccinated individuals posed versus those who have been vaccinated.
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  If you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated.
[04:22.000 --> 04:29.000]  You have to have certain rules in the society if we all are going to continue to live and keep each other alive.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  You cannot be that selfish and quite frankly, that ignorant.
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  You have no right not to be vaccinated. You have no right not to wear a mask.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  You have no right to open up your business.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  Wait, can I stop you?
[04:42.000 --> 04:49.000]  No right not to be vaccinated, meaning if they decide you have to be vaccinated, we have to be vaccinated?
[04:49.000 --> 04:57.000]  Absolutely, and if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor's office.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[05:06.000 --> 05:14.000]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th.
[05:21.000 --> 05:30.000]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, frankspeech.com.
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to frankspeech.com now.
[05:35.000 --> 05:43.000]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products,
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  but they're only offered at frankspeech.com. Thank you and God bless.
[05:48.000 --> 06:00.000]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALIX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALIX.
[06:00.000 --> 06:18.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:31.000 --> 06:37.000]  Well, my friends, it's now official, not just in Europe, not just in Australia, not just in the UK,
[06:37.000 --> 06:45.000]  but here in the United States in blue city, blue state, globalist enclaves.
[06:45.000 --> 06:51.000]  They are announcing mandatory vaccines to go to the grocery store, mandatory vaccines to go into a restaurant,
[06:51.000 --> 06:57.000]  mandatory vaccines to get an Uber, and it's all the big corporations linking up with the big banks
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  and corrupt governments to force this world ID on we the people.
[07:02.000 --> 07:12.000]  This is extreme, extreme tyranny and it's not just a skeleton of an oppressive cashless society, it is the full body of it.
[07:12.000 --> 07:19.000]  And so we see this great leap suddenly into the authoritarian world government.
[07:19.000 --> 07:25.000]  Quite a time to be alive and everything that we see being pushed is based in fraud.
[07:25.000 --> 07:32.000]  But anyone that's logical, anyone that's informed, anyone that's researched knows everything we're being told is a lie.
[07:32.000 --> 07:39.000]  But then big tech links up and punishes and censors those and then banks kick people out of their bank accounts
[07:39.000 --> 07:46.000]  or lower their credit score literally now if you are not putting out the party line.
[07:46.000 --> 07:54.000]  So you wake up and all those decades of globalist preparation to bring us into tyranny are now here.
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  So let me go ahead and do this.
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000]  I'm going to hit a lot of the headlines in the first two segments and then at the bottom of the hour at 33 after,
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  I'm going to lay out what Agenda 2050 looks like.
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  Now there's no document out called Agenda 2050.
[08:11.000 --> 08:22.000]  There's Agenda 21 from 1992 at the Rio de Janeiro summit where they called for world government in the post-industrial world
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  and that that operation be launched in the year 2020 and that it be complete by 2030.
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.000]  And then the year 2020, they released Agenda 2030.
[08:33.000 --> 08:44.000]  But if you read into their documents and their statements, they have out there the final end of humanity at 2047 to 2050.
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  So I'm dubbing it Agenda 2050 and getting out ahead of it today.
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  And I'm going to give you Agenda 2050. Obviously not many of us that are alive today will be alive then.
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  That includes most children.
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  If they are successful, almost all of us will be dead long before 2050.
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.000]  So this is one hell of a war that's been declared against us.
[09:07.000 --> 09:14.000]  And finally, we've got a fighting chance because I knew that almost no one else would say what was coming
[09:14.000 --> 09:20.000]  because it would be discrediting, it would sound insane, but I knew that if we set it long enough, then when it launched,
[09:20.000 --> 09:26.000]  we would have great credibility in a very narrow window to have an intellectual global debate about this
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  and put the brakes on this project of the New World Order depopulation plan.
[09:31.000 --> 09:42.000]  And we've got a very narrow window of five years maximum until only concerted armed uprisings
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  targeting the globalist will be able to stop at that point and that's not the road we want to go down
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  because that actually could be in a judo move used by them to bring in more tyranny.
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  So we don't want to be violent offensively, but this is violent saying you are not essential, you can't have food,
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  you can't have a house, you can't have children, you can't fly on airplane.
[10:01.000 --> 10:09.000]  If you don't take these deadly experimental shots, violates the Nuremberg Code, absolutely 100% at every level.
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  And of course the deadly shots themselves are a very serious medical tyranny assault
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.000]  and the things are just getting more and more unstable by design because the globalist built a giant Ponzi scheme
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  that they want to collapse and then take full control instead of all of them going to prison.
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  So just imagine burning made off on steroids and with a lot of Satan mixed into it, you've got their main game plan.
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  So let me go ahead and show you these headlines here for you.
[10:35.000 --> 10:43.000]  White House COVID response coordinator says it's time to impose vaccine requirements.
[10:43.000 --> 10:55.000]  That's the White House saying that it's official, we are going to make you have COVID passports.
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.000]  And then of course that injection is not going to work, it's going to remove your immune system, make you ill.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  They're going to then call it COVID and say, oh people that didn't take the shot, they're the reason you're sick.
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.000]  Not the shot you took, that's why the majority of people in the hospital, they now admit, Fauci lied of course,
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  the majority dying have had the vaccine and they're calling it COVID.
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  And the Stockholm syndrome public just cannot admit they're being murdered, so they just roll their sleeves and say,
[11:21.000 --> 11:26.000]  thank you sir, may I have another, we've got that video clip coming up.
[11:26.000 --> 11:34.000]  And then of course vaccine passports, New York now requires proof of vaccination to go inside buildings.
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  Totally illegal.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  We have Cuomo saying he wants the businesses to enforce it.
[11:39.000 --> 11:45.000]  And then the mayor says, oh it is a law, even though it's not a law, totally illegal, totally criminal.
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.000]  New York City orders restaurants and gyms to demand proof of vaccination from all customers.
[11:50.000 --> 11:58.000]  That's called indentured servitude or the essence of authoritarianism, fascism, communism, you name it, is empowered and energized.
[11:58.000 --> 12:07.000]  The blood authoritarianism is enforced edicts carried out by the general public, mob rule through the state.
[12:07.000 --> 12:17.000]  Oh and notice right when they announce all this, the attorney general of New York, run by George Soros, keeping Cuomo on a short leash,
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  comes out and says in a press conference still going on right now, Cuomo harass women,
[12:23.000 --> 12:29.000]  sending old people with COVID to their deaths, not letting their families come see them,
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  sending people that were sick in nursing homes to kill people and cost 20,000 deaths, a majority of deaths from New York.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  None of that's a problem.
[12:36.000 --> 12:43.000]  The problem is he would tell women they look good and things like that, and obviously he's a weird authoritarian thug,
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  but that's what they put in there.
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  And so they're using that as a distraction away from the tyranny he's carrying out.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  Put that back on screen please.
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  There's this red report headline, Kinky Cuomo harass women, groped, kissing, verbal abuse.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  He would retaliate, violated federal and state law, read it all.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  Yeah, print that for me guys.
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  So they just came out with that in the last hour.
[13:07.000 --> 13:17.000]  And it's, again, a total distraction with all the anger in the state over the vaccine passports and over killing the old people.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  The reason he's in trouble is not for the crime connected to the globalist and Biden and the New World Order and all the rest of it.
[13:25.000 --> 13:31.000]  No, it's hitting on women.
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.000]  When, of course, it gets a lot worse than that with Cuomo and the nipple rings and all the rest of it.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  And they're letting the political class know we put all these movie directors in prison for raping women.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  We can put governors in prison.
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  We can get anybody we want, including our own people, so you better do what we say when we say it.
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  Because remember, Cuomo just six months ago was like, okay, maybe we should reopen New York.
[13:55.000 --> 13:56.000]  We're killing the state.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  And they went, ah, ah, ah, ah, sexual harassment.
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  And he clicked his heels and said, yes, sir.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  So we've got all that.
[14:04.000 --> 14:12.000]  Meanwhile, Treasury Department taking extraordinary measures to avoid default after Congress failed to raise the debt ceiling.
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  This country is being maneuvered into economic collapse.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  We should all come together and reject the globalist.
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  But oh, it's okay.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  You can take the vaccine.
[14:22.000 --> 14:23.000]  You'll be safe.
[14:23.000 --> 14:31.000]  Vaccinated Senator Lindsey Graham tests positive for China virus still praises the vaccine.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  And it's now even in the Wall Street Journal.
[14:34.000 --> 14:46.000]  It's now even in the precious Jerusalem post and the Darling, New York Times that the majority of hospitalizations for COVID have had the shot and the majority of the deaths have had the shot.
[14:46.000 --> 14:55.000]  And the statistics are actually out instead of, again, Fauci lying to you as a demonic criminal that he is.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  That's all coming up today.
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  We're going to go to break.
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  I'm going to come back and get more into it and how we stop it.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  And then we're going to get into agenda 2050 at the bottom of the hour.
[15:06.000 --> 15:19.000]  I'm going to tell you what the future looks like, you better write this down or record it because if they start winning the next few major battles over the next few years, politically, culturally, economically, you'll never be seeing Alex Jones again.
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.000]  You won't be seeing anybody that questions anymore.
[15:23.000 --> 15:35.000]  Because once they take the resources away and start starving the public, they'll do anything they're told to quote, get their EBT cards to work again.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  And so the true end is here, my friends.
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  We did it to the unborn babies.
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.000]  We did it to the old people.
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.000]  We didn't take care of ourselves.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  We didn't value human life.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  And so now we have become what we treated others like garbage.
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  But I'll assure you in the end, Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and the globalist will pay.
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  Well, the ride back stay with us.
[15:59.000 --> 16:06.000]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.

[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th.

[16:59.000 --> 17:06.000]  Hey everybody, if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:08.000 --> 17:15.000]  Here's the thing, we just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.000]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.000]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.000]  The best part?
[17:24.000 --> 17:30.000]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.000]  and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to, gets even better.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being,
[17:38.000 --> 17:46.000]  I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world, period.
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.000]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com
[17:50.000 --> 17:58.000]  and discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[17:58.000 --> 18:05.000]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[18:05.000 --> 18:08.000]  Challenge, first of all, let me say I love your products.
[18:08.000 --> 18:15.000]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[18:19.000 --> 18:25.000]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[18:25.000 --> 18:30.000]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements,
[18:30.000 --> 18:36.000]  but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time,
[18:41.000 --> 18:47.000]  I started noticing, okay, you know, this is the ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know.
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.000]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.000]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[18:56.000 --> 19:01.000]  One of the products that I'm very proud of, I don't talk enough about,
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  because there's so many amazing essential oils and ingredients in it,
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.000]  it takes a long time to break down the product because it's a complex product.
[19:09.000 --> 19:15.000]  A lot of the sprays you put in your mouth or your throat and lungs are really thin.
[19:15.000 --> 19:21.000]  It's a little bit of alcohol if you want it to essential oils.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  Not our lung cleanse.
[19:23.000 --> 19:30.000]  It's got a long list of the highest quality essential oils and ingredients in it.
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  You take a few sprays in your mouth, lightly inhale,
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.000]  and it just does so much for me when I've got allergies or when my throat is tired.
[19:40.000 --> 19:45.000]  It's just very, very soothing and it's just one more thing for you and your family
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  to have in your arsenal during these insane times.
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  So get your lung cleanse discounted at InfowarsStore.com
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.000]  and get yourself and your family prepared while at the same time funding the Infowar,
[19:56.000 --> 20:11.000]  a total 360 win, InfowarsStore.com.
[20:27.000 --> 20:42.000]  The killer awoke before dawn, put his boots on and he made his way to the ancient gallery
[20:42.000 --> 20:57.000]  and he walked on down the hall.
[20:57.000 --> 21:03.000]  They're really carrying out the beginning of the planetary depopulation.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  They really already started it.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  You're going to see such carnage in death.
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.000]  You already see it very soon and the media is going to manage it to a certain point
[21:13.000 --> 21:17.000]  but then say the unvaccinated caused it.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  Let's put that screen back up there for TV viewers please.
[21:20.000 --> 21:23.000]  Regulations I'll read it to you.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  Alex Jones exposed the secrets of Agenda 2050 and beyond.
[21:27.000 --> 21:32.000]  Tune in to this broadcast if you want to live.
[21:32.000 --> 21:39.000]  That's not a joke.
[21:39.000 --> 21:44.000]  Yes, I know we talk about horrifying things but if you go back to my film In Game,
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  if you go back to what I said 20 years ago, 25 years ago,
[21:47.000 --> 21:54.000]  what's the most well-known thing we're known for here on air?
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  With hardcore audiences.
[21:56.000 --> 22:01.000]  It's talking about a global virus and a lockdown and forced inoculations with steroids.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  Because the UN talked about doing that.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  I thought they'd only do the sterilant.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  No, no, they just said why just sterilize?
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  Start killing.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  So it's a cocktail of things that does to you.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  I've played you all of these top scientists.
[22:13.000 --> 22:19.000]  The latest one's the head of the medical system at Baylor University.
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.000]  That's all over the state of Texas, very respected.
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.000]  Saying every one of these viruses has failed.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  Every one of these vaccines based on a protein jacket of a virus has failed
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  and has killed the lab animals.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  You can't do it.
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  And we've done human trials and he lists the human trials of other vaccines
[22:38.000 --> 22:47.000]  where it killed the children, particularly.
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  And then he says in the congressional hearing,
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  he says every project failed over the last 50 years,
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  but then Bill Gates picked it back up and that's what he did.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  And I told you it's Bill Gates.
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  Gee, we've got all these studies that when you do this, it kills the lab animals.
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  Almost all of them.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  In some cases all of them.
[23:11.000 --> 23:12.000]  Blood clots.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  Let's do it to everybody.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  Again, this is just open and shut as if I walked over to you with a gallon of gasoline,
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  poured it on you and lit you on fire.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  I'm killing you when I do that.
[23:24.000 --> 23:29.000]  Or if I walked up with a butcher knife and I had you tied up and I slit your damn throat,
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  I'd be murdering you premeditatedly.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  Murder one.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  And we're, I mean, we're sitting here.
[23:36.000 --> 23:39.000]  Look, I know Bill Gates and the globalists said they were going to do this.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  I know they tested a bunch of stuff in other third world countries.
[23:41.000 --> 23:46.000]  I know in some cases they'd kill, half a village would die when they give them an inoculation.
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  For smallpox or for polio or for tetanus.
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.000]  I mean, sometimes they'd kill half the village would die in like a week.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  This is on record.
[23:57.000 --> 24:04.000]  All of the world in Burma and in Nigeria and in Guatemala and in everywhere.
[24:04.000 --> 24:10.000]  Patnistan.
[24:10.000 --> 24:16.000]  And, you know, those villagers aren't rocket scientists, but back when the old doctors would come 56 years ago,
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  they ran up and wanted it because those were nice doctors.
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  But now when Big Pharma comes the last 30, 40 years, they run to the hills and they have to have armies come
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  who get paid in these countries all over the world to hold people in the villages.
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  They'll just show up and announce with 100 troops, try to encircle the village with machine guns and say,
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  you're going to take this.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  And you see, they've gotten away with that so long around the world.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  Bill Gates is banding over 30 countries.
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.000]  He's completely banded 20 something and another 30 or so he's partially banded in.
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.000]  But it's kind of average it to say 30 plus countries and it's changing all the time.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  But it's a lot of them.
[24:55.000 --> 25:02.000]  And when they show up at the villages, the villagers literally attack men with machine guns with clubs because they've seen the death.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  You don't act like that.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  You know, Indians aren't just known for starting fights with people for no reason.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  Why are the Indians so vicious to their own government?
[25:14.000 --> 25:22.000]  Because they saw their family members killed before.
[25:22.000 --> 25:27.000]  So we better get the same common sense they've got or we're done.
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  It's not rocket science, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  Hell, let's go ahead and play the clip.
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.000]  This should have gotten more attention.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  It's on zero heads.
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  It's on M4 wars.
[25:35.000 --> 25:43.000]  Watch White House COVID response coordinator says it's time to impose vaccine requirements and Fauci is looking totally sinister.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  He's out of the CDC up there as well.
[25:45.000 --> 25:56.000]  And here he is announcing from the White House it's time to impose mandates forced inoculation declaration of war violation of the Nuremberg code.
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  Talk about martial law.
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  Imagine if President Trump was on TV saying you got to take shots.
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  Cities would burn and they should.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  I'm not calling for violence at this point because they'll use it against us.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  But I mean this type of behavior.
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  One person gets injected forcibly and dies.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  All the globalists go to prison and their houses burn.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  I mean that's justice.
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.000]  I'm not saying do that.
[26:19.000 --> 26:26.000]  But they are they are waging war against us and trying to do with this authority because they're at a White House lectern.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  And they're going to have the corporations and companies make us do this.
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.000]  This is beyond Nazi Germany already.
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  But I do not want violence, ladies and gentlemen, because they will use that against us and spin it.
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  We have to keep our independent media going.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  We have to expose it.
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  We have to warn people.
[26:43.000 --> 26:51.000]  We have to get the victims and the survivors on air to tell their story of what happened when they took this poison and have an endless list of doctors and scientists coming out.
[26:51.000 --> 26:56.000]  Because the globalists did all this because their whole system was collapsing three years ago, two years ago.
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.000]  The UN admitted their doctors were all turning against the vaccines because they quote were hurting people.
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.000]  They did this giant fail forward, this giant too big to fail operation.
[27:05.000 --> 27:10.000]  So here it is, ladies and gentlemen, Jeffrey Zinz with Fauci.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  Listen to it.
[27:11.000 --> 27:19.000]  So working with states to encourage vaccinations through incentives, which have made a difference throughout the vaccination effort.
[27:19.000 --> 27:26.000]  Last week, the president called on states and local governments to use funding they have received, including from the American Rescue Plan,
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.000]  to give $100 to anyone who gets fully vaccinated.
[27:31.000 --> 27:37.000]  Minnesota and New Mexico have already stepped up to answer the president's call.
[27:37.000 --> 27:44.000]  If financial incentives like these help us get more shots in arms, we should use them.
[27:44.000 --> 27:57.000]  But in addition to incentives, it's time to impose some requirements based on the realities of different risks, unvaccinated individuals pose versus those who have been vaccinated.
[27:57.000 --> 28:10.000]  Last week, the Department of Veteran Affairs announced it will require doctors and nurses and other healthcare workers who provide medical care to our veterans to get vaccinated.
[28:10.000 --> 28:20.000]  This is in lockstep with many healthcare employers around the country who are requiring vaccinations and will protect our veterans when they get medical care.
[28:20.000 --> 28:28.000]  At the president's direction, the Department of Defense is looking into how and when they will add COVID-19 vaccination.
[28:28.000 --> 28:29.000]  Let's stop right there.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  Fauci looks like he's up in front of a firing squabble.
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  This is happening because he knows this is this is totally illegal.
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  It's experimental injection and they're going for it.
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  And they know that the public now knows it's the vaccines killing people, not the unvaccinated.
[28:45.000 --> 28:51.000]  So, but they're still going ahead with it because they've set the machine in motion and now they can't stop it.
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  I mean, they've already killed 50, 60, 100 million Americans.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  Who knows?
[28:56.000 --> 29:07.000]  They're already walking dead right now.
[29:27.000 --> 29:34.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.000]  No cures or treatments there.

[31:01.000 --> 31:07.000]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[31:07.000 --> 31:14.000]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[31:14.000 --> 31:17.000]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[31:17.000 --> 31:22.000]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th.
[31:22.000 --> 31:30.000]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, frankspeech.com.

[32:00.000 --> 32:09.000]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[32:09.000 --> 32:13.000]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate,
[32:13.000 --> 32:18.000]  I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[32:18.000 --> 32:24.000]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.
[32:24.000 --> 32:33.000]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated, they fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off, $14.95.
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.

[32:49.000 --> 32:57.000]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use. It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal global system.
[32:57.000 --> 33:19.000]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[33:19.000 --> 33:36.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones transmission. Thank you for joining us today on this August 3rd, Tuesday broadcast.
[33:36.000 --> 33:51.000]  So let me just give you my 35,000 foot view on this and then we can give you some contemporary examples and talk about how to stop it.
[33:51.000 --> 34:08.000]  I don't want to put info wars at the center of the chessboard, but that's really where all of you are. We are the info war. We are citizens and humans that love God and justice and want a pro human future and believe in humanity and believe in God and believe in a human future.
[34:08.000 --> 34:35.000]  But the globalists know that whatever humans can envision because we're made in the image of God, we're able to build and they are very jealous and envious of the incredible mind of humanity and they want to steal it and basically chain it down and confuse it and gaslight it so they can control it as an engine of their power.
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.000]  They don't want the bird to fly.
[34:39.000 --> 34:44.000]  And if you study all of history, you see corrupt regimes that come to power that do just that.
[34:44.000 --> 35:02.000]  But then in the end, they destroy themselves in the process because they are projecting their own hatred of themselves onto the general public that they decided that it's so ugly and so bad that it's going to be rounded up and exterminated because that's their subconscious mind wanting to kill themselves.
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.000]  On the surface, they love themselves, but they definitely hate themselves.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  So let's talk about it right now.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  What is agenda 2050?
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  Well, that's the term I'm using.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  And you better believe they've got it.
[35:17.000 --> 35:18.000]  And that's what it's called.
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.000]  But I've never seen that document.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  I've seen agenda 21.
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  I've seen agenda 2030.
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  And we're living it.
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.000]  But they don't release their new agenda reports until they're right in the middle of it.
[35:30.000 --> 35:36.000]  So I would imagine they'll release their agenda 2050 in a 2040.
[35:36.000 --> 35:48.000]  And again, these timelines, these gold posts can be moved back and forth because they're always calibrating, but it's still always the same plan going in the same direction.
[35:48.000 --> 35:57.000]  And so in all of their priests, and it is a religion, transhumanist, satanic religion, in all of their admissions.
[35:57.000 --> 36:04.000]  And in all their statements, and you see it everywhere now in the Wall Street Journal, looking forward to the end of humanity.
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  And you see it in the New York Times, a world without humans would be wonderful.
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.000]  And families are bad.
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.000]  The nuclear family is bad.
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  And humans are parasites and must be gotten rid of.
[36:14.000 --> 36:22.000]  And NBC talks to the top bioethics scientists and says, we must merge the machine and get rid of carbon-based life forms.
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  Carbon itself is bad.
[36:24.000 --> 36:33.000]  And then you learn, when you redeep their literature, their religious text, that they want to overwrite the whole planet and believe all life here is bad.
[36:33.000 --> 36:41.000]  So the supposed guardians of the earth who get a lot of humans to sign on to their agenda in this cult, they're in the outer room.
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  They're not in the temple.
[36:43.000 --> 36:51.000]  They're not in the inner sanctum or the tabernacle with its even more holy centers within it.
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.000]  That's how all these systems work is concentric rings.
[36:54.000 --> 37:02.000]  The people out on the far out edge really believe we've got to get rid of humans and do all this to save the earth and save the whales and save the butterflies.
[37:02.000 --> 37:12.000]  The globalists talk about once we become God, Ray Kurzweil says, top advisor to Google, once we become God, we'll build a trillion worlds.
[37:12.000 --> 37:19.000]  And it won't matter and we'll be able to recreate butterflies on a thousand galaxies if we choose to.
[37:19.000 --> 37:29.000]  And they talk about how they'll all upload their consciousness to rockets, to spaceships that then blast off into space and they'll start competing with each other in the wider universe as gods.
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  Kind of like Guardians of the Galaxy part two.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  And that's really what they're telling you when they do all of this.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  And but then you study the people running it.
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  They've just hijacked all the intelligent people, stolen the technology and they themselves are in the pedophilia.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  They themselves have high suicide rates for children do their horrible people.
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  Just a low level example.
[37:53.000 --> 38:00.000]  None of these globalists even give tips to waitresses or anybody or a person that gives a massage, anything.
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  They skip out on bills, you name it, because they don't just dislike people.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  They hate people.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  So they're not the type of folks that built this system.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  They're not the type of folks that have creativity.
[38:12.000 --> 38:19.000]  They're just the type of people that want to control it and run it all and turn us into a commodity.
[38:19.000 --> 38:29.000]  Where we where we devalue ourselves to the point where we don't stand up for ourselves so we can be like Potter's clay in their hands.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  And so let's talk about agenda 2050.
[38:31.000 --> 38:43.000]  In 2050, if you look at all their religious transhumanist texts, which are now official UN law and official corporate governance at the Davos Group World Economic Forum.
[38:43.000 --> 38:51.000]  They say by the year 2047, there really won't be any humans left.
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  Or if there are, we'll be in museums.
[38:54.000 --> 39:02.000]  They're going to tolerate us like a bug or like a house plant is the most common megalomaniacal delusion that they put out.
[39:02.000 --> 39:14.000]  And they talk about how then there'll be a singularity and an acceleration and that then the people that have become gods are going to need to leave the planet.
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.000]  Or they might contend with each other and destroy each other.
[39:19.000 --> 39:28.000]  Or a lot of them say, well, they'll end up just being one super being. And so we'll just absorb everyone into one super being being and then basically make everybody give up their bodies.
[39:28.000 --> 39:37.000]  And you see that in the Illuminati religious peace childhoods in put out in the 1950s by Sir Arthur C. Clarke.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  It was one of their high priests.
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.000]  So that's where all this comes from.
[39:46.000 --> 40:01.000]  And part of the entrance into it is giving up your humanity and not having children and promising to hurt children.
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.000]  And really what it is is a total religion of selfishness.
[40:06.000 --> 40:15.000]  So now that I've talked about their philosophy some, let's talk about what they're planning to do right now.
[40:15.000 --> 40:29.000]  The name of the game is conduct covert war against independence, against health, against sanity, against goodness, because the system they're bringing in can't compete with that.
[40:29.000 --> 40:42.000]  Destroy all islands of sanity, wreck economies, engage in economic, cultural and biological, radiological war while posing as the savers.
[40:42.000 --> 40:51.000]  Kill the planet as you absorb it and use it as the energy and the engine for what you're building.
[40:51.000 --> 41:06.000]  Because the main mission is kill all life on earth in a ritual of planetary sacrifice so that the new creature can emerge from the husk of the once beautiful living world.
[41:06.000 --> 41:15.000]  So the main mission is absorb the planet as you kill it and then blow the planet up when you're done.
[41:15.000 --> 41:25.000]  That's in Clarke's writings, it's in all Asimov's writings, it's in the religious high holy moment will be once humanity is destroyed, fully absorbed, then the planet will be destroyed.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  That is the high ritual.
[41:27.000 --> 41:37.000]  It will be blown up into a space rubble, into a new asteroid belt.
[41:37.000 --> 41:44.000]  And no competing civilization may be allowed to escape, no arc must be able to get away.
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  They must suppress all technology, dominate it, poison the people, dumb them down.
[41:48.000 --> 41:58.000]  In a process to where even the globalists are so sick and so decrepit from 5G, 6G, 8G, all the poisons that they themselves will have to give up their bodies.
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  They intend, you say, well, how do they not poison themselves while we're poisoned?
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  Well, some of them avoid it and stuff, but the real Acolytes don't avoid it.
[42:05.000 --> 42:14.000]  They embrace it in their transhumanist movement and want to merge with it.
[42:14.000 --> 42:27.000]  Because they want to give up their humanity and they want to show their God that they are truly ready to be faithful and to merge with it before it moves on to the next planet.
[42:27.000 --> 42:35.000]  And they want to understand it, it's all a love letter from Satan in childhoods end.
[42:35.000 --> 42:48.000]  And let's just say Clark, well, you know Clark definitely fit in the club, Ogrosy Clark, OSS, MI6, inventor of the communication satellite, and of course, a major perv.
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.000]  All right, we're going to come back and I'm going to give you the rest of the story, what it's going to look like, how the control collapse is going to look.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  Now they're coming to murder you and your family slowly, but first they want to suck your soul.
[42:59.000 --> 43:08.000]  I recently ran an ad where we played a cavalry bugle call in the background and I made the point that hey, the cavalry is here, but it's really true.
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.000]  Listeners are incredible and we're able to keep these great products in stock.
[43:12.000 --> 43:21.000]  We were able to fund ourselves last year and actually dig ourselves someone out of a hole that we've been in because I expanded so much for the 2020 election.
[43:21.000 --> 43:32.000]  But thanks to you, we're still on air. But now because of the shutdown in production and because of slowdowns with the whole COVID lockdowns with the supply chain, a lot of our best selling products have not been available for months and months and months.
[43:32.000 --> 43:39.000]  Some for six months, some have been discontinued, but the cavalry is here now in our funding because a lot of these products are finally coming back in.
[43:39.000 --> 43:51.000]  Prostagard, Vaso Beats, Alpha Power, and of course, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula are all in our top 10 best sellers. Our second best seller is Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% of humanoid's.
[43:51.000 --> 43:59.000]  It is back in stock right now, 50% off at InfoWrestler.com. So really, you are the cavalry when you order these products at InfoWrestler.com.
[43:59.000 --> 44:16.000]  The biosecurity state is here. It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil. The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same,
[44:16.000 --> 44:30.000]  has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024, and that in 2024 you will again take two shots. And he says it will be whatever Pfizer cooks out that wants to put in your body.
[44:30.000 --> 44:40.000]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates. They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[44:40.000 --> 44:50.000]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Home Institute in Germany.
[44:50.000 --> 45:00.000]  InfoWrestler will continue to set fast. They fight this. I don't know how long we can. The enemy's coming for us all now. God bless, and good luck. I would again get right with God right now.
[45:00.000 --> 45:14.000]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told, and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[45:14.000 --> 45:24.000]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions, natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[45:24.000 --> 45:40.000]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system. The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye. Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[45:40.000 --> 45:54.000]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy. Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride-free and the pro-pure showerhead will seal the deal.
[45:54.000 --> 46:10.000]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[46:24.000 --> 46:40.000]  The U.N. will use the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that the U.N. will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the U.N. whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees,
[46:40.000 --> 46:56.000]  not fleeing COVID or climate change as the U.N. and Klaus Schwabber and Bill Gates are saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the U.N. and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[46:56.000 --> 47:12.000]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist.
[47:26.000 --> 47:54.000]  There is a call. There is a frequency. There is a transmission.
[47:54.000 --> 48:10.000]  And we know what the priesthood of the Illuminati believe. They believe they are gods, but must first take control of the planet to survival of the fittest and exterminate every life form in a sacrifice to their god.
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.000]  Only then will they become gods.
[48:16.000 --> 48:29.000]  The question is, are you going to submit to that and go along with that? Or are you going to stand up and resist it?
[48:29.000 --> 48:40.000]  The choice is yours, whether you want to go interstellar, intergalactic, interdimensional. We've got all the tools.
[48:40.000 --> 48:58.000]  We've got Atlantis too. Will this project succeed? America is Atlantis too. This broadcast is Atlantis too. Will this project succeed? Or are we going to let these things blow us up?
[48:58.000 --> 49:09.000]  Teachers to hate ourselves, teachers to fight with each other, teachers to be idiots, suppress our technology.
[49:09.000 --> 49:17.000]  Let's hit it right now. So they control the resources. They start cutting them off while posing as a savior, always blaming their opposition.
[49:17.000 --> 49:23.000]  Those that won't take the special injections. Those that won't turn their children over for programming. Those that still want to have a family.
[49:23.000 --> 49:34.000]  Those that still want to own their own property. Those that want to be independent. Those that want to go to a real church where the frequency is not Lucifer's channel.
[49:34.000 --> 49:48.000]  All about what you tune your channel to. Now can you handle tuning to that channel? It scares you. You certainly don't want to be tuned into both channels.
[49:48.000 --> 49:57.000]  That's why to read their own writings and do this. I don't even need to do that. I can just dial into the channel and I would advise folks not to dial into the Satan's channel.
[49:57.000 --> 50:08.000]  I've done it and that's how I know what they're up to. But more often than not, I don't dial into it. I just can read their own writings and I can see more and more.
[50:08.000 --> 50:20.000]  They're telling you what they're tuned into. Is that so?
[50:20.000 --> 50:30.000]  I was at a big grappling championship in Austin a few months ago with Joe Rogan and I didn't even notice that giant thunderstorms and tornadoes had blown in and nobody was telling me.
[50:30.000 --> 50:39.000]  And I was inside the big Marriott Hotel, J. W. Marriott downtown, this giant ballroom, like chandeliers and dudes fighting under. It was very, very surreal.
[50:39.000 --> 50:54.000]  And I just felt excitement, felt energy and I said, what's going on? And I just felt compelled to get up and I went outside and it was black purple clouds and green clouds and tornadoes and lightning and like 60 mile an hour wind and trees falling down.
[50:54.000 --> 51:05.000]  You couldn't hear it. You couldn't see it down deep under the hotel, giant hotel, just humongous. But I could feel it and feel the barometer in my mind, my guts.
[51:05.000 --> 51:14.000]  And I went outside and just saw it right as it was getting dark at like eight o'clock at night, just boiling green clouds out of a movie in between the buildings.
[51:14.000 --> 51:23.000]  Just what the hell? I could open the door to go outside and everybody's dialed into that. Everybody knows. Well, that's just the frequency of nature.
[51:23.000 --> 51:30.000]  That's the frequency of our bodies in the third dimension that are picking up on that frequency of just life.
[51:30.000 --> 51:38.000]  You can be in a room totally blocked out windows, but you know when the sun comes up, you feel it, you open your eyes and if you go check your watch, that's sunrise.
[51:38.000 --> 51:48.000]  You may make yourself go back to sleep and they want you to divorce yourself from all those feelings and all those instincts God gave you that are a connection to God's creation that itself is a connection to God.
[51:48.000 --> 52:15.000]  I don't worship the creation. The creation, though, is a hymn of God's garment. And just like the woman reaches out to touch Christ's garment, to touch the sun, to touch the trees, to touch the water, to touch your wife, to touch your husband, to take care of your children, to cook your friends a meal, to have love, is to commune with God and is a form of energetic worship that connects you to God.
[52:15.000 --> 52:26.000]  And the more the connections there, the more it accelerates and the enemy seeks around the clock to try to stop that. And that's the whole plan.
[52:26.000 --> 52:41.000]  So they want to artificially cut the resources off while they pose as the saviors and then make things so poisonous and so toxic and remove our immune systems and have all the babies be born by cesarean and then by the year 2045 they estimate all men will be sterile with the chemicals in the water.
[52:41.000 --> 52:56.000]  This is all official until you have to totally give up your physical body, they will tell you to stay alive and that you'll be uploaded into a synthetic silicon system.
[52:56.000 --> 53:08.000]  And they say that will be the final religious move is your new body being born again into the matrix, born again into the Borg, born again into their system.
[53:08.000 --> 53:28.000]  And everything you see out of science fiction they admit is the nebula awards and others were given by the Illuminati to the futurist they wanted so that humans would envision this future and accept this future and build this future because we are master builders.
[53:28.000 --> 53:48.000]  And so the year 2050 is the goal at which no independent human life will be allowed on the planet Earth unless quote it is in a zoo or it is in a museum.
[53:48.000 --> 54:02.000]  And so this is a total revolution and the globalists are smart in a very cold-blooded way. They know that empires rise and fall that are based on human systems. They know that human activity always is going to challenge other human and people don't want to be under somebody's thumb.
[54:02.000 --> 54:28.000]  The only way to conquer humanity is to end humanity. But you've got to give humanity a way out and tell it oh you're going to evolve in this way, give yourself over to control this and it's more like a sexual operation where you're being raped by the AI for your thoughts, your mind, your genetics and raped by a system that isn't just going to kill you, again it's going to absorb you but take your free will away.
[54:28.000 --> 54:53.000]  It's going to rape you to death. And so that's all this is, is a complete takeover. But again it wants to extract our knowledge first and chronicle us and save us like you go out and find a butterfly in the field and put it under glass and with alcohol and kill it and put a pin on it in your wall.
[54:53.000 --> 55:11.000]  It wants us to be part of its collection. Because it doesn't just want our knowledge, it hates us because we're made in the image of the thing that kicked its ass, of the thing that's defeated it over and over again.
[55:11.000 --> 55:23.000]  See? And so it's this process, it's this thing that hunts humans, it's this thing that hates humans, it's this thing that wants to kill you. That is agenda 2050.
[55:23.000 --> 55:41.000]  Compliance with anything the globalist pushes, death, resistance is life and victory. We have a special guest coming in studio in the next hour, he's one of the prominent members of the nation of Islam, message to the millennials, bro Riza Islam and he's a well-spoken individual,
[55:41.000 --> 55:57.000]  he's going to eugenics and the targeting of everybody, particularly people of African descent or extermination and why he thinks that's the case. And I guess he's super banned everywhere in so am I. So we're all about having people on that are thought provoking.

[2:42:56.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:48.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:45:12.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:56.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:47:24.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:28.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:50.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:46.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:53:46.000 --> 2:54:14.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:32.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:57:24.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  That's an invitation for each one of us to examine how we're living.
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  And how not a single decision we make.
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:36.000]  Not one in any moment is without consequence.
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  This is our moment to reclaim our humanity.
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:58:08.000]  What are champions made of.
[2:58:08.000 --> 2:58:10.640]  Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[2:58:10.680 --> 2:58:12.160]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[2:58:12.200 --> 2:58:14.240]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the
[2:58:14.240 --> 2:58:16.880]  phone of the product. The X2 does wonders.
[2:58:16.880 --> 2:58:19.200]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[2:58:19.200 --> 2:58:22.040]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the ample work.
[2:58:22.080 --> 2:58:24.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year.
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:24.960]  Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:27.400]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[2:58:27.440 --> 2:58:28.120]  Honour, talk to you.
[2:58:28.160 --> 2:58:32.120]  Awesome. So personally, I wanted to do was say, I love the
[2:58:32.120 --> 2:58:36.440]  products, alpha power, even at 29. If you ask my better half,
[2:58:36.440 --> 2:58:38.800]  she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[2:58:38.840 --> 2:58:40.520]  So just number one for a few.
[2:58:40.520 --> 2:58:42.200]  I like that one. He works. It's not a joke.
[2:58:43.080 --> 2:58:43.920]  Absolutely.
[2:58:50.240 --> 2:58:52.480]  The bio security state is here.
[2:58:53.120 --> 2:58:56.600]  It's an anti human eugenics operation training us that
[2:58:56.600 --> 2:58:58.280]  humans are dirty, bad and evil.
[2:58:59.040 --> 2:59:02.600]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada says he
[2:59:02.600 --> 2:59:04.760]  admires the communist dictatorship of G.G.
[2:59:04.760 --> 2:59:08.320]  Ping and wishes to make Canada the same has announced that
[2:59:08.320 --> 2:59:12.440]  they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all
[2:59:12.440 --> 2:59:16.440]  the way out into 2024 and in 2024, you will again take two
[2:59:16.440 --> 2:59:19.920]  shots and he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and
[2:59:19.920 --> 2:59:20.840]  wants to put in your body.
[2:59:21.480 --> 2:59:23.160]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:59:23.200 --> 2:59:25.480]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[2:59:25.960 --> 2:59:28.160]  They're now implementing it and now they've announced that US
[2:59:28.160 --> 2:59:30.800]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:59:31.080 --> 2:59:33.480]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the
[2:59:33.480 --> 2:59:37.320]  main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler and the eugenics at
[2:59:37.320 --> 2:59:39.160]  Colesprings Harbor that trained the Coserville home
[2:59:39.160 --> 2:59:40.400]  Institute in Germany.
[2:59:40.960 --> 2:59:42.400]  And bullwars will continue to so fast.
[2:59:42.400 --> 2:59:43.000]  They fight this.
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:43.960]  I don't know how long we can.
[2:59:44.400 --> 2:59:45.720]  The enemy is coming for us all now.
[2:59:45.720 --> 2:59:47.040]  God bless and good luck.
[2:59:47.040 --> 3:00:15.040]  I would begin your ride with God right now you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:15.040 --> 3:00:19.080]  All right, folks, Alex Jones here in defiance of tyranny.
[3:00:19.480 --> 3:00:22.160]  I am so blessed and I'm so honored to be here with you.
[3:00:22.840 --> 3:00:26.240]  And you just saw nine minutes out of the documentary film that's
[3:00:26.240 --> 3:00:28.360]  free at man.video.
[3:00:29.240 --> 3:00:30.360]  Put it back on screen, please.
[3:00:30.800 --> 3:00:32.440]  That just blows it all away.
[3:00:32.440 --> 3:00:37.920]  And again, the way that that doctor lays it all out, Dr.
[3:00:37.920 --> 3:00:38.720]  David Martin.
[3:00:40.680 --> 3:00:42.000]  And we've gone and looked at the patents.
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:42.760]  It's all true.
[3:00:43.160 --> 3:00:44.520]  This was premeditated.
[3:00:44.520 --> 3:00:47.240]  It needs to get out pandemic to indoctrination.
[3:00:48.600 --> 3:00:51.280]  And they're going to plan more pandemics, more control.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:53.640]  They they're fully committed.
[3:00:53.640 --> 3:00:57.480]  And that gives Fauci and Bill Gates a power that they launched this attack.
[3:00:57.760 --> 3:00:58.520]  They did this.
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:01.960]  And now they think they can just get away with anything.
[3:01:03.480 --> 3:01:06.840]  And the whole media signed on and the lawyers signed on and most of the
[3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:07.800]  hospitals signed on.
[3:01:07.800 --> 3:01:09.080]  So they're committed now.
[3:01:09.920 --> 3:01:10.920]  That's how corruption works.
[3:01:10.920 --> 3:01:14.440]  To the crime, they got tricked into being part of.
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:18.640]  So that's coming up right now, that full film.
[3:01:18.640 --> 3:01:23.760]  And I'm going to shoot some more special reports on that film and other films.
[3:01:25.280 --> 3:01:26.560]  With all the censorship going on.
[3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:28.280]  Thank God we started man.video.
[3:01:29.440 --> 3:01:31.360]  That URL itself is banned on most places.
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:36.240]  I Twitter and Facebook at freeworldnews.tv is not because so many people.
[3:01:36.240 --> 3:01:40.240]  Who've made films that have been seen 20, 30, 40, 50 million times can't
[3:01:40.240 --> 3:01:42.200]  even be on Facebook or Twitter anymore.
[3:01:42.520 --> 3:01:44.120]  They've got to come to man.video.
[3:01:44.120 --> 3:01:45.120]  I don't like that.
[3:01:46.600 --> 3:01:51.480]  It's scary to me that man.video is such an oasis for free thinkers and people.
[3:01:51.480 --> 3:01:52.240]  And then I just.
[3:01:53.080 --> 3:01:54.520]  Ask all of you.
[3:01:56.240 --> 3:02:00.160]  To think about that and to take those videos and to take those links and to take
[3:02:00.160 --> 3:02:04.320]  that information and to share it with everyone you know, because that's the real
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:06.240]  power in the universe, and I cannot.
[3:02:08.720 --> 3:02:12.360]  Accentuate that I cannot highlight that I cannot put a bigger.
[3:02:14.520 --> 3:02:15.560]  Exclamation point.
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:21.320]  On the fact that when you take action and you care and you spread the word,
[3:02:21.320 --> 3:02:22.320]  it changes the world.
[3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:23.000]  In fact, let's.
[3:02:23.720 --> 3:02:24.840]  Take that documentary.
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:27.720]  Pandemic to.
[3:02:28.640 --> 3:02:32.440]  And let's repost the featured spot on man.video.
[3:02:32.440 --> 3:02:34.520]  On Bandai video, this half a million views is not enough for that.
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:37.960]  Pandemic indoctrination.
[3:02:39.760 --> 3:02:43.200]  It needs way more than 456,000 views.
[3:02:44.200 --> 3:02:48.440]  It needs to have billions of years, and I guarantee you, if that film got a
[3:02:48.440 --> 3:02:50.440]  billion views, it became over the new world order.
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:54.400]  If you shared it and told others to share it and then they shared it, we would
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:02:54.920]  win.
[3:02:54.920 --> 3:02:57.440]  It's literally up to you.
[3:02:57.440 --> 3:03:00.560]  And again, it's not about who gets the credit or who sought first.
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:04.680]  I'm just saying we already a year and a half ago in a year ago, had Dr.
[3:03:04.680 --> 3:03:08.440]  Francis Boyle on others over the patents, over the funding, how they created
[3:03:08.440 --> 3:03:11.440]  the virus, how foul should he gain a function, but.
[3:03:12.960 --> 3:03:16.360]  Dr. David Martin does a great job laying it all out.
[3:03:17.480 --> 3:03:21.960]  In a great, easy to watch film with his expectation finances that goes even
[3:03:21.960 --> 3:03:25.160]  further than we've gone, and that's why it's so important.
[3:03:25.160 --> 3:03:29.120]  The enemy is desperate to suppress communications because it's like
[3:03:29.120 --> 3:03:30.440]  sunlight to vampires.
[3:03:30.440 --> 3:03:32.240]  It's like holy water to Count Dracula.
[3:03:33.240 --> 3:03:39.000]  And so again, I tell you, band.video, band.video, that's, you can share via
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:40.960]  email, via text messages or word of mouth.
[3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:42.960]  You can't share it via most platforms.
[3:03:42.960 --> 3:03:43.480]  It's banned.
[3:03:44.480 --> 3:03:50.200]  Freeworldnews.tv, freeworldnews.tv, freeworldnews.tv, and it's so
[3:03:50.200 --> 3:03:55.200]  pavlovian that those of us that tell the truth, people are shared to expose it,
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:03:57.200]  they're scared to share it because you might get banned.
[3:03:57.200 --> 3:03:59.200]  You're going to get banned anyways.
[3:04:00.200 --> 3:04:05.200]  Big tech, the censorship, it's all going for broke right now.
[3:04:06.200 --> 3:04:09.200]  So I ask you, are you going to just sit there idly by and let them win,
[3:04:09.200 --> 3:04:10.200]  or are you going to take action?
[3:04:12.200 --> 3:04:14.200]  All right, we're out of time for my part of the transmission.
[3:04:14.200 --> 3:04:18.200]  Paul Watson is coming up in literally two weeks.
[3:04:18.200 --> 3:04:21.200]  He's coming up in literally a minute and a half.
[3:04:21.200 --> 3:04:27.200]  Separately, we have the M4's limited supply, flash shell 50% off on top selling products.
[3:04:27.200 --> 3:04:30.200]  Some of these should only go for three days, like bodies, ultimate tumor,
[3:04:30.200 --> 3:04:35.200]  forming a limited supply, 50% off turbo, force, and energy, 50% off lung cleanse.
[3:04:35.200 --> 3:04:40.200]  That's for a week, 50% off vitamin C with zinc, a huge mega dose, 50% off with
[3:04:40.200 --> 3:04:45.200]  limited supply, vitamin D3 gummies with zinc, or that's with calcium, 50% off
[3:04:45.200 --> 3:04:48.200]  infowarstore.com, I want to thank you all for your support,
[3:04:48.200 --> 3:04:52.200]  but most importantly, your prayers and your word of mouth.
[3:04:52.200 --> 3:04:53.200]  That is so important.
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:56.200]  All right, great job crew, great job listeners, amazing broadcast.
[3:04:56.200 --> 3:05:16.200]  Paul Watson takes over now.
[3:05:27.200 --> 3:05:35.200]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to Frankspeech.com now.
[3:05:35.200 --> 3:05:41.200]  To help support the CyberSupposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever
[3:05:41.200 --> 3:05:46.200]  on my pillow products, but they're only offered at Frankspeech.com.
[3:05:46.200 --> 3:05:59.200]  Thank you and God bless.
[3:06:16.200 --> 3:06:29.200]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:06:29.200 --> 3:06:30.200]  We're live.
[3:06:30.200 --> 3:06:34.200]  It is the Summit News Hour with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:06:34.200 --> 3:06:39.200]  We've got a ton of massive breaking news ahead of us, the vast majority of it,
[3:06:39.200 --> 3:06:47.200]  of course, relating to the global psychocrat takeover coronavirus scientific establishment
[3:06:47.200 --> 3:06:53.200]  dictatorship, which continues to spread its ugly wings across all continents on Earth,
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:59.200]  including over in Europe, where we have the top German newspaper.
[3:06:59.200 --> 3:07:04.200]  It's actually the best selling German newspaper in Europe, period.
[3:07:04.200 --> 3:07:10.200]  Build, now coming out and offering me a culpa and apology for its fear mongering
[3:07:10.200 --> 3:07:16.200]  coronavirus coverage over the past year plus, and in fact, openly apologizing to
[3:07:16.200 --> 3:07:22.200]  children for traumatizing them, giving them PTSD and basically accusing them of
[3:07:22.200 --> 3:07:25.200]  killing granny if they wanted to see their relatives.
[3:07:25.200 --> 3:07:27.200]  That is a massive news story.
[3:07:27.200 --> 3:07:30.200]  It's not getting nearly as much coverage as it should.
[3:07:30.200 --> 3:07:33.200]  I want to start with this, though, and we've got the clip here in a second
[3:07:33.200 --> 3:07:37.200]  because this broke just about an hour ago.
[3:07:37.200 --> 3:07:41.200]  They're now telling people in America, as Biden presumably prepares for another
[3:07:41.200 --> 3:07:44.200]  lockdown, that's been in the offing now for a couple of weeks,
[3:07:44.200 --> 3:07:49.200]  rumors of that bumbling below the surface, that you're not just going to have to
[3:07:49.200 --> 3:07:53.200]  wear masks in restaurants, in gyms, as we saw with New York today,
[3:07:53.200 --> 3:08:00.200]  but even the prospect of people forcing parents to wear masks inside their own
[3:08:00.200 --> 3:08:04.200]  homes if they have kids under the age of 12 who are not vaccinated,
[3:08:04.200 --> 3:08:07.200]  which, of course, is basically all of them.
[3:08:07.200 --> 3:08:10.200]  Headline up on summit.news.
[3:08:10.200 --> 3:08:14.200]  NIH director says parents should wear masks inside their own homes.
[3:08:14.200 --> 3:08:20.200]  This is Dr. Francis Collins, who appeared on CNN New Day just a few hours ago
[3:08:20.200 --> 3:08:23.200]  to make this new proclamation.
[3:08:23.200 --> 3:08:24.200]  We have the clip.
[3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:25.200]  Let's roll it.
[3:08:25.200 --> 3:08:28.200]  Here it is.
[3:08:28.200 --> 3:08:35.200]  It's clear that this variant is capable of causing serious illness in children.
[3:08:35.200 --> 3:08:40.200]  You have heard those stories coming out of Louisiana pediatric ICUs,
[3:08:40.200 --> 3:08:44.200]  where there are kids as young as a few months old who are sick from this.
[3:08:44.200 --> 3:08:45.200]  That is rare.
[3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:47.200]  Certainly younger people are less likely to fall ill,
[3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:50.200]  but anybody who tries to tell you, ah, you don't have to worry about it
[3:08:50.200 --> 3:08:55.200]  if you're a young, healthy person, there's many counter examples all around us now.
[3:08:55.200 --> 3:08:58.200]  So, yeah, you do need to think about it.
[3:08:58.200 --> 3:09:02.200]  And that's the reason why the recommendations are for kids under 12
[3:09:02.200 --> 3:09:05.200]  that they avoid being in places where they might get infected,
[3:09:05.200 --> 3:09:10.200]  which means recommendations of mask wearing in schools and that at home,
[3:09:10.200 --> 3:09:13.200]  parents of unvaccinated kids should be thoughtful about this.
[3:09:13.200 --> 3:09:16.200]  And the recommendation is to wear masks there as well.
[3:09:16.200 --> 3:09:17.200]  Let me just follow up on that.
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:18.200]  I know that's uncomfortable.
[3:09:18.200 --> 3:09:22.200]  I know it seems weird, but it is the best way to protect your kids.
[3:09:22.200 --> 3:09:28.200]  But I just, again, want to fully understand if this is about protecting the kids.
[3:09:28.200 --> 3:09:30.200]  So he said, I know it seems weird.
[3:09:30.200 --> 3:09:32.200]  Yeah, it is weird wearing masks.
[3:09:32.200 --> 3:09:34.200]  How terrorized do you need to be?
[3:09:34.200 --> 3:09:38.200]  How much of a jellyfish with a complete lack of spine do you need to be?
[3:09:38.200 --> 3:09:44.200]  To be so conformist that you wear a mask inside your own home.
[3:09:44.200 --> 3:09:48.200]  Even beside the fact that, as we know now, the masks are completely useless.
[3:09:48.200 --> 3:09:53.200]  We have the Dan mask study in Denmark, the only peer reviewed study of its type.
[3:09:53.200 --> 3:10:00.200]  6,000 participants studied COVID infections between those who wore masks and those didn't.
[3:10:00.200 --> 3:10:05.200]  There was no statistical, no significant statistical difference between those two control groups
[3:10:05.200 --> 3:10:08.200]  when it came to wearing masks or not wearing masks.
[3:10:08.200 --> 3:10:12.200]  We have Dr. Colin Axon, a sage advisor for the UK government,
[3:10:12.200 --> 3:10:17.200]  come out and admit last week that these face masks are nothing but comfort blankets
[3:10:17.200 --> 3:10:18.200]  in his own words.
[3:10:18.200 --> 3:10:20.200]  They do virtually nothing.
[3:10:20.200 --> 3:10:24.200]  The COVID-19 virus particle, depending on which mask you wear,
[3:10:24.200 --> 3:10:28.200]  is up to 5,000 times smaller than the frigging mask.
[3:10:28.200 --> 3:10:32.200]  How many more times do we need to make this argument?
[3:10:32.200 --> 3:10:36.200]  If you are in the cloth mask, not the blue surgical mask,
[3:10:36.200 --> 3:10:39.200]  it's only a thousand times smaller than the holes in that mask.
[3:10:39.200 --> 3:10:44.200]  The cloth mask, the virus particle is 5,000 times smaller.
[3:10:44.200 --> 3:10:50.200]  Yet this idea is telling parents to wear them inside their own houses.
[3:10:50.200 --> 3:10:56.200]  Despite the fact that we know the risk of a child getting seriously ill from COVID,
[3:10:56.200 --> 3:11:02.200]  whatever scarient they dream up, is virtually nonexistent.
[3:11:02.200 --> 3:11:04.200]  There are still people walking outside in London.
[3:11:04.200 --> 3:11:08.200]  There's no mandate in London, in the UK, that says you have to wear masks.
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:13.200]  There was someone in the park today who was literally a 25-year-old guy
[3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:17.200]  with one of those, what are they called, NH95?
[3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:22.200]  The actual full professional face mask, walking in a park
[3:11:22.200 --> 3:11:26.200]  with no one else around him, completely on his own.
[3:11:26.200 --> 3:11:28.200]  What the hell is wrong with you?
[3:11:28.200 --> 3:11:32.200]  It's over, take off the mask, let it go.
[3:11:32.200 --> 3:11:34.200]  You know what's interesting though?
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:40.200]  I was at a protest last weekend, anti-lockdown protest.
[3:11:40.200 --> 3:11:43.200]  Now I was with people, my friends amongst them,
[3:11:43.200 --> 3:11:47.200]  who were literally yelling at people who walked past
[3:11:47.200 --> 3:11:52.200]  or when we went past in the taxi, we were politely informing them out of the window.
[3:11:52.200 --> 3:11:56.200]  Take off your mask, take off your mask.
[3:11:56.200 --> 3:12:00.200]  Not in a mean, intimidating way, just in a quite forceful way.
[3:12:00.200 --> 3:12:06.200]  What's interesting is that numerous people, when you tell them to take off the mask,
[3:12:06.200 --> 3:12:10.200]  they take it off, it's like any chance to conform,
[3:12:10.200 --> 3:12:15.200]  the latest opportunity to conform, whether it's the government telling them that,
[3:12:15.200 --> 3:12:18.200]  whether it's the television telling them that,
[3:12:18.200 --> 3:12:21.200]  or whether it's someone on the street telling them something.
[3:12:21.200 --> 3:12:26.200]  They've got such a bizarre kind of kink to want to conform at every moment of their lives.
[3:12:26.200 --> 3:12:29.200]  They'll take the mask off if you ask them to.
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:32.200]  Not in every case, obviously some will get in your face
[3:12:32.200 --> 3:12:34.200]  and call you every name under the sun.
[3:12:34.200 --> 3:12:39.200]  But some of them, they're so desperate to conform to whatever the latest edict is,
[3:12:39.200 --> 3:12:42.200]  whether it comes from the television, the government or people on the street,
[3:12:42.200 --> 3:12:45.200]  they will do it.
[3:12:45.200 --> 3:12:49.200]  Now this idiot is saying you need to wear a mask inside your own home.
[3:12:49.200 --> 3:12:52.200]  How is that going to be enforced?
[3:12:52.200 --> 3:12:54.200]  How is that going to be patrolled?
[3:12:54.200 --> 3:12:56.200]  We're going to have COVID visits.
[3:12:56.200 --> 3:12:59.200]  We're going to have special COVID marshals like we do here in the UK
[3:12:59.200 --> 3:13:01.200]  to check if you're not self-isolating.
[3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:06.200]  Are they going to come around your house and check whether or not you're wearing a mask inside?
[3:13:06.200 --> 3:13:09.200]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:13:09.200 --> 3:13:12.200]  I'm going to get into the Germany thing after the break
[3:13:12.200 --> 3:13:15.200]  because I want a full run at it because it's the biggest story of the day
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:17.200]  and it's got no coverage whatsoever.
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:20.200]  But also today the broadcaster Jeremy Clarkson came out
[3:13:20.200 --> 3:13:24.200]  and said the communist government advisors in the United Kingdom
[3:13:24.200 --> 3:13:26.200]  want to lock us down forever.
[3:13:26.200 --> 3:13:28.200]  There was a big fallout about this.
[3:13:28.200 --> 3:13:31.200]  Oh my God, how dare he say the word communist?
[3:13:31.200 --> 3:13:38.200]  Even though there's literally an extremist hardliner communist called Susan Mitchie
[3:13:38.200 --> 3:13:43.200]  who is so hardcore, her nickname is Stalin's nanny
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:46.200]  who is advising the UK government on lockdown coronavirus
[3:13:46.200 --> 3:13:54.200]  who has repeatedly said she wants mask mandates and social distancing to continue forever.
[3:13:54.200 --> 3:13:58.200]  Why is somebody with an extremist political belief
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:03.200]  one that in the 20th century led to the deaths of tens of millions of people?
[3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:06.200]  Why is someone like that advising the government?
[3:14:06.200 --> 3:14:09.200]  We're going to hire neo-Nazis to advise the government now.
[3:14:09.200 --> 3:14:12.200]  Oh no, because communism is just nice, isn't it?
[3:14:12.200 --> 3:14:15.200]  It was just wrongly practiced, right?
[3:14:15.200 --> 3:14:17.200]  60 million dead.
[3:14:17.200 --> 3:14:19.200]  They just got it wrong.
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:23.200]  Well now British broadcaster Jeremy Clarkson has blasted communist government advisors
[3:14:23.200 --> 3:14:26.200]  who want to keep the population under lockdown forever.
[3:14:26.200 --> 3:14:29.200]  He made the comments during an interview with the Radio Times.
[3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:33.200]  He said, I think the politicians should sometimes tell those communists at stage
[3:14:33.200 --> 3:14:35.200]  to get back in their box.
[3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:39.200]  Remember, these are the people who admittedly used totalitarian, unethical,
[3:14:39.200 --> 3:14:41.200]  mind control tactics.
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:45.200]  They weaponised behavioural psychology at the start of the pandemic
[3:14:45.200 --> 3:14:48.200]  to terrify everyone into complete obedience.
[3:14:48.200 --> 3:14:52.200]  These are not good people, but Clarkson's come out to his credit
[3:14:52.200 --> 3:14:55.200]  and he's basically asking when's it going to end?
[3:14:55.200 --> 3:14:57.200]  He said it could be 40 years.
[3:14:57.200 --> 3:14:59.200]  We could still be in some form of lockdown.
[3:14:59.200 --> 3:15:02.200]  He said, well, if it's going to be forever, let's open it up.
[3:15:02.200 --> 3:15:04.200]  And if you die, you die.
[3:15:04.200 --> 3:15:09.200]  He clarified those comments by saying, you know, we can't have empty hospital beds.
[3:15:09.200 --> 3:15:11.200]  We can't have nobody dying.
[3:15:11.200 --> 3:15:16.200]  At some point we have to open everything up and get over it and live with it
[3:15:16.200 --> 3:15:20.200]  just as we did with every other virus in human history.
[3:15:20.200 --> 3:15:23.200]  And he's calling out communists within the British government,
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:26.200]  at least the advisory branch of that.
[3:15:26.200 --> 3:15:29.200]  And of course, there is mass fallout.
[3:15:29.200 --> 3:15:33.200]  Of course, when this Susan Mitchie lifetime member of the Communist Party
[3:15:33.200 --> 3:15:37.200]  was challenged on her beliefs a couple of months ago,
[3:15:37.200 --> 3:15:40.200]  the Twitter mob railed to her defence and they said that it was, quote,
[3:15:40.200 --> 3:15:45.200]  a misogynistic attack to merely ask this commie scum
[3:15:45.200 --> 3:15:50.200]  why she's commie scum and why she's got a position of informing the government
[3:15:50.200 --> 3:15:52.200]  on the sage committee.
[3:15:52.200 --> 3:15:55.200]  We'll come back and get into what's happening in Germany
[3:15:55.200 --> 3:15:57.200]  because it's absolutely huge.
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:16:26.200]  News don't go away.
[3:16:28.200 --> 3:16:29.200]  Hey, everybody.
[3:16:29.200 --> 3:16:32.200]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[3:16:32.200 --> 3:16:33.200]  Me too.
[3:16:33.200 --> 3:16:36.200]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies,
[3:16:36.200 --> 3:16:40.200]  after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:40.200 --> 3:16:44.200]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[3:16:44.200 --> 3:16:46.200]  You probably already believe that.
[3:16:46.200 --> 3:16:47.200]  I certainly do.
[3:16:47.200 --> 3:16:48.200]  So here's the thing.
[3:16:48.200 --> 3:16:52.200]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances
[3:16:52.200 --> 3:16:57.200]  actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:57.200 --> 3:16:59.200]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver,

[3:20:02.040 --> 3:20:12.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:12.520 --> 3:20:30.160]  So we know for a fact it's all documented that in the United Kingdom the behavioural
[3:20:30.160 --> 3:20:36.560]  psychologists that were working with the government weaponized behavioural psychology, they deliberately
[3:20:36.560 --> 3:20:43.080]  went out to terrorize the British public way beyond the actual threat level that coronavirus
[3:20:43.080 --> 3:20:48.160]  represented in the early weeks of the pandemic because they were afraid that people wouldn't
[3:20:48.160 --> 3:20:55.160]  conform to the government mandates and so they grossly exaggerated the threat of Covid.
[3:20:55.160 --> 3:21:01.000]  They failed to educate and inform people that for the healthy portion of the population
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:08.440]  the fatality rate of Covid was literally 99.95% under the age of 50.
[3:21:08.440 --> 3:21:13.720]  They terrorized the public with propaganda, advertising campaigns via the media.
[3:21:13.720 --> 3:21:19.000]  The media was completely complicit in it and it's left a trail of destruction to the point
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:25.400]  that childhood depression specifically is way up, suicides, childhood suicides are way
[3:21:25.400 --> 3:21:26.400]  up.
[3:21:26.400 --> 3:21:27.400]  We also saw that in Australia.
[3:21:27.400 --> 3:21:31.520]  They were literally doubled as a result of the lockdown.
[3:21:31.520 --> 3:21:37.560]  Basically a situation where this is going to reverberate in terms of PTSD and psychological
[3:21:37.560 --> 3:21:42.640]  trauma probably for a generation or more and will there be any walk backs?
[3:21:42.640 --> 3:21:44.080]  Will there be any apologies?
[3:21:44.080 --> 3:21:51.000]  Will there be any mere culprits from the media who were completely complicit in facilitating
[3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:55.080]  this psychological attack on the world?
[3:21:55.080 --> 3:22:02.240]  There's one ray of light in the context of that today, Germany's top newspaper and this
[3:22:02.240 --> 3:22:07.280]  is the biggest selling newspaper in Europe throughout the entire continent.
[3:22:07.280 --> 3:22:14.720]  Their editor-in-chief has come out and apologized for billed newspaper coverage of the coronavirus
[3:22:14.720 --> 3:22:19.240]  pandemic over the past 16, 17 months.
[3:22:19.240 --> 3:22:26.360]  When editor-in-chief of Germany's top newspaper apologizes for fear driven COVID coverage,
[3:22:26.360 --> 3:22:33.640]  this story last time I checked has got literally no media coverage whatsoever.
[3:22:33.640 --> 3:22:39.220]  Somebody tweeted the video of this guy's comments and this is the editor-in-chief.
[3:22:39.220 --> 3:22:44.720]  This is quite a prominent individual in the world of media, in the world of journalism
[3:22:44.720 --> 3:22:50.440]  and I've literally just Googled his name and gone on news and there's not one news
[3:22:50.440 --> 3:22:56.520]  out there in the entire world, apart from some of the news that has covered this story
[3:22:56.520 --> 3:22:59.880]  which to my mind is the biggest story of the day.
[3:22:59.880 --> 3:23:06.880]  The editor-in-chief of Europe's top selling newspaper has come out publicly and apologized
[3:23:06.880 --> 3:23:14.200]  profusely to his readership, to Germans in general and specifically to children for their
[3:23:14.200 --> 3:23:17.480]  fear driven coverage of COVID.
[3:23:17.480 --> 3:23:22.400]  This is Julian Reichelt who delivered a speech to camera and he said he was sorry for Billed's
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:28.800]  coverage which was quote like poison, can you imagine the BBC, can you imagine Sky News,
[3:23:28.800 --> 3:23:34.080]  can you imagine CNN coming out and admitting any of this, it's never going to happen, this
[3:23:34.080 --> 3:23:39.720]  is why this is so big, so he said their coverage was quote like poison and he said it quote
[3:23:39.720 --> 3:23:45.880]  made you feel like you were a mortal danger to society again, making humans the enemy
[3:23:45.880 --> 3:23:52.800]  of themselves as the club of Rome stated was its ultimate intention in that document, that
[3:23:52.800 --> 3:23:56.960]  founding document decades ago now.
[3:23:56.960 --> 3:24:01.760]  Reichelt went on to direct his main sentiment towards children who have been terrorized
[3:24:01.760 --> 3:24:06.200]  by fear-mongering media coverage which is called caused child depression and suicides
[3:24:06.200 --> 3:24:09.200]  to soar across the world.
[3:24:09.200 --> 3:24:13.720]  He said quote to the millions of children in this country for whom our society is responsible,
[3:24:13.720 --> 3:24:18.440]  I want to express here that neither our government nor our chancellor, he's talking about Angela
[3:24:18.440 --> 3:24:25.600]  Merkel, dares to tell you, we ask you to forgive us, forgive us for this policy which for a
[3:24:25.600 --> 3:24:32.480]  year and a half has made you victims of violence, neglect, isolation and loneliness, he's talking
[3:24:32.480 --> 3:24:33.480]  about lockdown.
[3:24:33.480 --> 3:24:38.560]  He goes on to say quote, we persuaded our children that they were going to murder their
[3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:45.880]  grandma if they dared to be what they are, children or if they met their friends, none
[3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:50.160]  of this has been scientifically proven.
[3:24:50.160 --> 3:24:55.580]  You went on to say when a state steals the rights of a child, it must prove that by doing
[3:24:55.580 --> 3:24:59.320]  so it protects him against concrete and imminent danger.
[3:24:59.320 --> 3:25:04.720]  This proof has never been provided, it has been replaced by propaganda presenting the
[3:25:04.720 --> 3:25:11.080]  child as a vector of the pandemic which is precisely what the NIH director is doing today
[3:25:11.080 --> 3:25:16.040]  in America, telling parents they need to wear masks inside their own homes because their
[3:25:16.040 --> 3:25:24.160]  kids are vectors for the pandemic, again demonizing children as an enemy to their own relatives,
[3:25:24.160 --> 3:25:31.280]  to their own grandmas, traumatizing them for life in some cases.
[3:25:31.280 --> 3:25:35.360]  Mike Helt, the editor-in-chief of BUILD went on to know how moderate voices who attempted
[3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:41.960]  to offer calmer perspectives on the pandemic were quote, never invited to the expert table
[3:25:41.960 --> 3:25:47.960]  and urged viewers quote, don't believe this lie when encountering alarmist proclamations
[3:25:47.960 --> 3:25:50.120]  from the government.
[3:25:50.120 --> 3:25:55.000]  This is literally like Rupert Murdoch or somebody like that coming out and apologizing
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:25:57.760]  for his media empire's coverage of coronavirus.
[3:25:57.760 --> 3:26:02.880]  This is the top guy at BUILD, the top newspaper in Europe.
[3:26:02.880 --> 3:26:07.520]  You'd think this would be a big story, it isn't even a story anywhere.
[3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:10.240]  Why is no media outlet reporting on this?
[3:26:10.240 --> 3:26:15.120]  This is one of the biggest stories of the year so far.
[3:26:15.120 --> 3:26:20.240]  He went on to state that authorities should open schools and sports halls instead of polling
[3:26:20.240 --> 3:26:25.400]  stations warning that those who impose brutal lockdown measures quote, will have on their
[3:26:25.400 --> 3:26:31.680]  conscience and will leave in the history books a multitude of innocent souls.
[3:26:31.680 --> 3:26:36.880]  So this is obviously weighed on his conscience for the best part of the past 18 months.
[3:26:36.880 --> 3:26:40.760]  He's getting out ahead of time because he sees which way the winds are blowing.
[3:26:40.760 --> 3:26:47.040]  He sees the absolute devastation across the board that these lockdown policies have caused
[3:26:47.040 --> 3:26:53.360]  in terms of domestic abuse, suicide, depression, delayed cancer treatments, all kinds of delayed
[3:26:53.360 --> 3:26:58.600]  health treatments, the devastation to the economy which causes further wealth inequality,
[3:26:58.600 --> 3:27:02.080]  which causes poverty, which causes death.
[3:27:02.080 --> 3:27:08.240]  The actual number of years lost in terms of lives will greatly outnumber the years lost
[3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:14.200]  of COVID victims as we've proven time and time again with all these analyses and breakdowns
[3:27:14.200 --> 3:27:20.040]  from major institutions including the one in South Africa that we prominently highlighted
[3:27:20.040 --> 3:27:21.840]  back last year.
[3:27:21.840 --> 3:27:27.760]  The lockdowns will kill more people than the virus and in fact I think it was Germany's
[3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:32.960]  own foreign minister or their interior minister that came out and admitted that last year
[3:27:32.960 --> 3:27:36.800]  that the lockdown is going to kill way more people than the virus.
[3:27:36.800 --> 3:27:37.800]  Where are the apologies?
[3:27:37.800 --> 3:27:38.800]  Where are the mere culprits?
[3:27:38.800 --> 3:27:40.800]  They're never going to happen.
[3:27:40.800 --> 3:27:45.040]  This guy's got it out early, he's come out early because it's obviously weighing on
[3:27:45.040 --> 3:27:50.160]  his conscience and he's basically said sorry to all the innocent souls that we traumatized
[3:27:50.160 --> 3:27:53.680]  with PTSD with our fear mongering coverage.
[3:27:53.680 --> 3:27:59.360]  This newspaper has a circulation of 1.24 million copies a day and it's the biggest newspaper
[3:27:59.360 --> 3:28:00.360]  in Europe.
[3:28:00.360 --> 3:28:04.720]  You'd think that would be a story, it isn't and we know why.
[3:28:04.720 --> 3:28:09.520]  Meanwhile, UN Special Rapporteur on torture requests info on German police brutalizing
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:11.280]  anti-lockdown protesters.
[3:28:11.280 --> 3:28:18.120]  We had the footage yesterday, numerous anti-lockdown protests in Berlin across the weekend.
[3:28:18.120 --> 3:28:22.760]  The riot police went out and were basically ordered to brutalize them, shoving down old
[3:28:22.760 --> 3:28:26.800]  ladies to the floor by the throat, punching children in the face.
[3:28:26.800 --> 3:28:32.840]  This kind of behavior wouldn't look out of place in 1930s Germany, never mind Germany
[3:28:32.840 --> 3:28:33.840]  2021.
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:38.360]  If this had happened during an LGBT march in somewhere like Russia, there'd be global
[3:28:38.360 --> 3:28:39.360]  condemnation.
[3:28:39.360 --> 3:28:46.560]  There's nothing of the kind because anti-lockdown protesters have been dehumanized and vilified
[3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:51.880]  by the same media that's covered up the true origin and source of this pandemic from the
[3:28:51.880 --> 3:28:52.880]  very start.
[3:28:52.880 --> 3:29:22.840]  We're going to wrap it up for this segment, coming up we'll talk about the UK situation
[3:29:22.840 --> 3:29:30.180]  that's now working on the U.S.
[3:29:52.840 --> 3:29:57.000]  great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more. They're wonderful products and they
[3:29:57.000 --> 3:30:03.000]  support the M4. Thank you. Let's go to Juan in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for
[3:30:03.000 --> 3:30:07.000]  holding. Hello. Can you hear me? I sure can, sir. Thank you. Hey, Alex. Before I start, man,
[3:30:07.000 --> 3:30:11.640]  I just, I've been wanting to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now.
[3:30:12.200 --> 3:30:15.560]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother. I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and
[3:30:16.200 --> 3:30:21.800]  I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive,
[3:30:21.800 --> 3:30:28.680]  me and my brothers that drive. There's a couple of us. We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[3:30:28.680 --> 3:30:35.000]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking
[3:30:35.000 --> 3:30:39.480]  all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man. Well, brother, we put more in this than
[3:30:39.480 --> 3:30:44.760]  any other long-term high-quality energy powder there is. So this was designed on one of the top
[3:30:44.760 --> 3:30:47.880]  guys in the country. He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues,
[3:30:47.880 --> 3:30:50.840]  but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it. And we
[3:30:50.840 --> 3:30:55.640]  believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there. And you're saying that it's
[3:30:55.640 --> 3:30:59.400]  made your life better. So that means a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you.
[3:30:59.400 --> 3:31:04.200]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're super computers controlled
[3:31:04.200 --> 3:31:09.080]  by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go, what we do. But because they have great cameras
[3:31:09.080 --> 3:31:14.200]  and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan
[3:31:14.200 --> 3:31:19.160]  horse, this Promethean fire has a lot of power. But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high
[3:31:19.160 --> 3:31:24.840]  quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com. We finally got them back in stock,

[3:33:05.400 --> 3:33:17.320]  You're listening to the summit.news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:23.080 --> 3:33:27.160]  We are back and we're going to get into the situation in Australia because they've imposed
[3:33:27.160 --> 3:33:32.200]  what is probably the most brutal lockdown in the developed world and it continues to get worse
[3:33:32.200 --> 3:33:37.960]  with more video footage coming out of police arresting people for not wearing masks outside
[3:33:37.960 --> 3:33:42.840]  and in this case literally inducing a man to have a heart attack because they're really there to
[3:33:42.840 --> 3:33:49.720]  protect and serve. I'm going to get to that in a second and in fact I made a video about Australia
[3:33:49.720 --> 3:33:54.280]  which will play before I get into that story but first I wanted to cover this came out a few days
[3:33:54.280 --> 3:34:01.480]  ago. Video NHS nurses demand to COVID test newborn baby claim it's not mother's property once
[3:34:01.480 --> 3:34:09.400]  outside the womb literally as due course now in UK hospitals under the wonderful sanctified
[3:34:09.400 --> 3:34:14.680]  deified NHS whichever one applauds and worships because it's so great and not terrible in every
[3:34:14.680 --> 3:34:22.600]  instance whatsoever. They record COVID cases from newborn babies as soon as they're born.
[3:34:22.600 --> 3:34:28.360]  Gee I wonder if they're really trying to bump up those COVID cases of course we had some relaxing
[3:34:28.360 --> 3:34:33.880]  of restrictions here a couple of weeks ago and all the pangendrums all the government advisors
[3:34:33.880 --> 3:34:40.200]  came out and said no don't do it don't do it it's going to cause 200,000 COVID cases a day
[3:34:40.200 --> 3:34:44.840]  as it happens they've been sliding down they've been falling for the past two weeks they're now
[3:34:45.480 --> 3:34:50.920]  hovering around 20,000 a day they said there'd be 200,000 a day by this point and that we couldn't
[3:34:50.920 --> 3:34:55.880]  open up anything because of that the same models that have proven disastrously wrong time and time
[3:34:55.880 --> 3:35:01.960]  again but they're literally testing newborn babies as soon as they pop out the womb for COVID
[3:35:01.960 --> 3:35:08.440]  in UK hospitals and we wonder why we're getting all these test results that are positive well one
[3:35:08.440 --> 3:35:15.640]  couple resisted that and the video shows this if Twitter hasn't deleted it imagine my shock they
[3:35:15.640 --> 3:35:21.160]  haven't deleted it yet shocking video which is posted to Twitter shows a heavily pregnant mother
[3:35:21.160 --> 3:35:25.320]  in hospital bed being lectured by nurses about how it's mandatory for the baby to be given a
[3:35:25.320 --> 3:35:33.240]  COVID test she says it's my property referring to the baby and the nurses respond basically it is
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:38.120]  quote while the baby's in your abdomen so they're basically telling her as soon as that baby comes
[3:35:38.120 --> 3:35:43.080]  out it's the property of the state and they're going to COVID test it maybe they'll jab it with
[3:35:43.080 --> 3:35:48.280]  some of the nice little cocktail of vaccines and basically she has no choice in the matter whatsoever
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:55.320]  so they complain and basically they get up and just leave the hospital but not before the
[3:35:55.320 --> 3:36:02.200]  deified sanctified TikTok dancing angels of the NHS tell her that they're going to report the
[3:36:02.200 --> 3:36:07.400]  situation the case to social services which basically means the government is going to
[3:36:07.400 --> 3:36:13.720]  investigate and try and take her newborn baby away because the mother didn't want it to get
[3:36:13.720 --> 3:36:19.160]  a COVID test the minute it popped out of her womb because she's such a terrible person
[3:36:19.800 --> 3:36:24.520]  and these NHS nurses who literally tried to get the state to seize her baby because it won't take
[3:36:24.520 --> 3:36:29.320]  a COVID test they're the good guys they're the guys who get applauded they're the people who get
[3:36:29.320 --> 3:36:35.080]  statues made of them sanctified and deified the wonderful NHS let's go to Australia now though
[3:36:36.120 --> 3:36:42.440]  because the communist Chinese government has literally expressed surprise at how much of an
[3:36:42.440 --> 3:36:48.120]  iron fist the Australian authorities are using against their own population to subjugate their
[3:36:48.120 --> 3:36:54.840]  own people with this coronavirus lockdown I made a video about this yesterday it is called Australia
[3:36:54.840 --> 3:37:01.640]  has fallen and here is the video guess who's criticising Australia for imposing one of the
[3:37:01.640 --> 3:37:07.960]  most brutal lockdowns in the developed world peers Corbyn amnesty international human rights
[3:37:07.960 --> 3:37:13.880]  campaigners no it's literally the communist Chinese government the global times the official
[3:37:13.880 --> 3:37:19.160]  mouthpiece for the CCP published a scathing editorial describing Australia's decision to
[3:37:19.160 --> 3:37:25.240]  send members of the military to occupy Sydney and enforce lockdown as a move that seemed quote
[3:37:25.240 --> 3:37:31.320]  draconian among nations yeah chances are if even Beijing is taken aback by your level of
[3:37:31.320 --> 3:37:37.320]  authoritarianism that's a pretty draconian brand of authoritarianism now obviously on the one hand
[3:37:37.320 --> 3:37:43.400]  China is just clapping back at Australia for the Morrison government's earlier criticism of China's
[3:37:43.400 --> 3:37:49.720]  atrocious disregard for human rights when it came to imposing its own lockdown but the fact remains
[3:37:49.720 --> 3:37:56.600]  he who fought with monsters has become the monster Australia gazed into the abyss and now the abyss
[3:37:56.600 --> 3:38:02.920]  gazes back at Australia because just like communist China Australia is now officially a
[3:38:02.920 --> 3:38:10.040]  biosecurity police state Australia is a post democratic country how else could you describe
[3:38:10.040 --> 3:38:15.720]  a country where protest is outlawed where under a newly proposed law those who risk arrest by even
[3:38:15.720 --> 3:38:21.400]  daring to attend a demonstration a subject to onerous fines of up to five and a half thousand
[3:38:21.400 --> 3:38:28.120]  dollars where those who merely post anti-lockdown information online could face fines of up to
[3:38:28.120 --> 3:38:34.120]  eleven thousand dollars where protest organizers face fines of twenty thousand dollars where
[3:38:34.120 --> 3:38:38.760]  pregnant women who promote such protests on facebook are arrested in front of their kids
[3:38:38.760 --> 3:38:43.480]  in their own homes how else could you describe a country where people face five hundred dollar
[3:38:43.480 --> 3:38:49.720]  fines for failing to wear a face mask outside where surveillance drones are deployed to catch the
[3:38:49.720 --> 3:38:58.760]  unmasked they're the eyes and voices in the sky where grandma sitting on park benches are arrested
[3:38:58.760 --> 3:39:04.920]  for not wearing masks where the public is ordered by top health officials not to speak to each other
[3:39:04.920 --> 3:39:11.160]  even if they're wearing masks whilst it isn't human nature to engage in conversation with others
[3:39:11.880 --> 3:39:18.680]  to be friendly unfortunately this is not the time to do that so even if you run into your
[3:39:18.680 --> 3:39:24.760]  next door neighbour in the shopping centre in the coals wash your coals wars or elderly or
[3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:32.200]  any other grocery shop don't start up a conversation now is the time for minimizing
[3:39:32.200 --> 3:39:37.960]  your interactions with others even if you've got a mask don't start up a conversation how else could
[3:39:37.960 --> 3:39:43.640]  you describe a country where police have the power to enter homes without a warrant to ensure
[3:39:43.640 --> 3:39:48.840]  compliance with coronavirus rules where authorities get themselves the power to remove children from
[3:39:48.840 --> 3:39:54.440]  the custody of their parents to ensure compliance with coronavirus rules where people are prevented
[3:39:54.440 --> 3:39:59.640]  from traveling further than three kilometers from their homes where surveillance choppers are used
[3:39:59.640 --> 3:40:05.240]  to track down people who camp in remote locations where senior government ministers refuse to rule
[3:40:05.240 --> 3:40:11.160]  out australians being forced to wear electronic ankle bracelets even if they're fully vaccinated
[3:40:11.160 --> 3:40:16.120]  to make sure they're complying with home quarantine orders where laws are under consideration giving
[3:40:16.120 --> 3:40:21.080]  authorities the power to arrest quote conspiracy theorists if it's thought they may commit a
[3:40:21.080 --> 3:40:28.280]  crime in the future australia continues to pursue a disastrous zero covid policy that has seen towns
[3:40:28.280 --> 3:40:36.200]  800 miles from the nearest city locked down after just one single covid case the country also continues
[3:40:36.200 --> 3:40:43.640]  to impose medical martial law measures that are so despotic even china is jealous when the world's
[3:40:43.640 --> 3:40:49.320]  leading communist dictatorship expresses surprise at the lengths you're prepared to go to to subjugate
[3:40:49.320 --> 3:40:57.560]  your own population you know for sure that something's rotten down under well there you have it australia
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:41:04.040]  started off as a penal colony and it seems to have written under that status very quickly more people
[3:41:04.040 --> 3:41:10.680]  die from the sun in australia than die from coronavirus in fact total deaths in australia
[3:41:10.680 --> 3:41:15.000]  for the entire period from coronavirus and this is even with their inflated numbers
[3:41:15.560 --> 3:41:23.960]  925 over 18 months and yet they basically enforced measures more draconian than communist china at
[3:41:23.960 --> 3:41:29.880]  this point another example of that occurred yesterday headline australian man suffers
[3:41:29.880 --> 3:41:35.480]  suspected heart attack while under arrest for not wearing a mask this was an elderly gentleman
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:41.320]  with a medical condition that made it hard for him to breathe he was exercising outside in a
[3:41:41.320 --> 3:41:48.680]  botanical gardens in brisbane four police officers came up to him started uh interrogating him for
[3:41:48.680 --> 3:41:54.520]  not wearing the mask despite the fact that he's exempt and even so even the draconian law in
[3:41:54.520 --> 3:41:58.600]  australia says you don't have to wear a mask while you're exercising but i'm sure they'll mandate
[3:41:58.600 --> 3:42:03.720]  that soon they'll literally want people to choke to death while they're doing physical exercise
[3:42:04.600 --> 3:42:10.760]  so four police gather around him then shortly afterwards he falls to the ground he has a violent
[3:42:10.760 --> 3:42:16.600]  seizure the police officers then proceed to make a joke out of it and say that he's just pretending
[3:42:16.600 --> 3:42:21.960]  despite the fact that he's literally screaming and gagging for his medicine which he has in a
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:27.080]  bag and he tries to reach out and grab it whether he died or not i don't think he died his son is
[3:42:27.080 --> 3:42:32.040]  out on instagram saying he could have suffered brain damage permanent injury or death the police
[3:42:32.040 --> 3:42:38.280]  were joking about it they literally did all this and induced cardiac arrest in the guy because he
[3:42:38.280 --> 3:42:45.720]  was outside in a park exercising without a mask on and they claim they're there to protect and serve
[3:42:46.440 --> 3:42:52.920]  who are you protecting you're literally inducing heart attacks in old men well done bravo we'll

[3:47:21.400 --> 3:47:27.400]  larry page another billionaire elitists are buying up private islands in fiji and other areas while
[3:47:27.400 --> 3:47:33.400]  tourists aren't even allowed to enter those countries you have of course john carrey waltzing
[3:47:33.400 --> 3:47:37.880]  through airports without a mask while everyone else is forced to wear one you have governor
[3:47:37.880 --> 3:47:45.320]  newson attending a fancy restaurant dinners in posh expensive french restaurants while telling
[3:47:45.320 --> 3:47:51.480]  californians that they can't meet each other for thanksgiving you have the french elite having
[3:47:51.480 --> 3:47:57.080]  underground secret parties while the rest of the country was under the most draconian lockdown ever
[3:47:57.080 --> 3:48:05.720]  now you have barack obama organizing a birthday party with 700 people while americans are told
[3:48:05.720 --> 3:48:09.960]  to wear masks while americans are told to avoid each other while other people for example in
[3:48:09.960 --> 3:48:15.720]  australia are literally told that they shouldn't even be talking to each other barack obama is
[3:48:15.720 --> 3:48:23.880]  planning a party involving some 700 people they include 475 guests including oprah winfrey
[3:48:23.880 --> 3:48:29.000]  george cloney and steven spielberg pearl jammer playing there that will do their
[3:48:29.000 --> 3:48:36.120]  anti-establishment street cred the world of good i presume there'll be 200 staff to serve the
[3:48:36.120 --> 3:48:43.720]  privileged elitists during this jamboree of course we had the g7 a few weeks ago doing the same thing
[3:48:43.720 --> 3:48:49.240]  having their little staged socially distanced photo ops their little elbow bumps while literally
[3:48:49.240 --> 3:48:55.080]  then embracing hugging almost slobbering over each other at one point with macron and biden
[3:48:55.080 --> 3:49:00.440]  and having their giant barbecue parties no social distancing whatsoever one rule for them
[3:49:00.440 --> 3:49:05.720]  another rule for us it's happening again with obama he's being slammed for this took a call
[3:49:05.720 --> 3:49:11.960]  some talked about this on his show last night we have the clip with mark stein here is the video
[3:49:11.960 --> 3:49:18.600]  no one's more impressed than michelle obama she's told you that many times she can barely go outside
[3:49:19.320 --> 3:49:24.040]  but when she's at home she goes big for she and her husband the king of the democratic party he's
[3:49:24.040 --> 3:49:29.880]  turning 60 so naturally they're celebrating and martha's vineyard with 200 servants so there'll be
[3:49:29.880 --> 3:49:34.920]  elephants will be brought in on a litter and what will shell will linsky have to say about it talk
[3:49:34.920 --> 3:49:39.640]  about a super spreader event we don't have the answers but we believe mark stein might he's our
[3:49:39.640 --> 3:49:45.720]  highest that he correspondent means that he's part based in martha's vineyard he joins us tonight
[3:49:45.720 --> 3:49:51.480]  so do you think 200 servants seems like a lot even for barack obama what do you think they'll be doing
[3:49:52.920 --> 3:49:58.280]  well actually in fairness i think all these under butlers and deputy footmen are actually
[3:49:58.280 --> 3:50:04.520]  going to be the only diversity because the 500 guests seem to be the same guests who go to every
[3:50:04.520 --> 3:50:10.040]  we're basically back to medieval europe where it's the same 500 people who go to all the parties as
[3:50:10.040 --> 3:50:18.120]  you know barack obama's got oprah and george cloney just as oprah and george cloney went to harry
[3:50:18.120 --> 3:50:23.240]  and meghan's wedding even though they've never met either of them i mean you have to feel sorry for
[3:50:23.240 --> 3:50:29.960]  george and oprah just going to the parties of people you don't know is a pretty sad and miserable
[3:50:29.960 --> 3:50:37.720]  existence but i have to i have to say that when you look at this 500 guests 200 forning
[3:50:37.720 --> 3:50:43.400]  footmen and under butlers what's interesting to me is the way people are actually perfectly happy
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:49.080]  with this you've been talking about citizenship on this show but actually a disturbing number of
[3:50:49.080 --> 3:50:55.560]  people are quite happy to be subjects they say oh yes i couldn't go to granny's 90th birthday but
[3:50:55.560 --> 3:51:02.760]  it's perfectly fine for barack obama to have 500 people because our rulers are so much better than
[3:51:02.760 --> 3:51:09.880]  us the the last 18 months has actually clarified this uh the governor of california eating at the
[3:51:09.880 --> 3:51:16.600]  french laundry oh well that's different he's a great man obama is a great man flying george cloney
[3:51:16.600 --> 3:51:22.680]  and oprah in that's appropriate oh i'm just gonna put my mask back on and go back in the house for
[3:51:22.680 --> 3:51:29.880]  another 18 months god that's the saddest observation i've heard the the fierce egalitarian spirit of
[3:51:29.880 --> 3:51:35.080]  american society dying and that's our fault i agree with you completely mark stein sometimes it takes
[3:51:35.080 --> 3:51:39.960]  a foreign eye to see the truth about our country great to see you well sometimes you have to be
[3:51:39.960 --> 3:51:47.160]  in budapest to see america clearly i envy you that time yes safe clean budapest the great marx
[3:51:47.160 --> 3:51:54.280]  so there you have it folks some mass gatherings are more equal than others of course they chided
[3:51:54.280 --> 3:51:59.480]  trump for having the rallies during when he was president saying that was a super spreader event
[3:51:59.480 --> 3:52:04.440]  meanwhile you had literally hundreds of thousands of people on black lives matter rallies look that
[3:52:04.440 --> 3:52:10.920]  was fine and in fact they put out fake studies in the aftermath saying that black lives matter
[3:52:10.920 --> 3:52:16.040]  rallies actually helped reduce coronavirus infections all of those trump rallies though
[3:52:16.040 --> 3:52:22.520]  they exacerbated it wildly well now even china which i guess a broken clock is right twice a day
[3:52:23.240 --> 3:52:28.360]  is chiding obama for holding what they're calling a super spreader event now i acknowledge in this
[3:52:28.360 --> 3:52:33.080]  article that it's somewhat rich of china the country literally responsible for deliberately
[3:52:33.080 --> 3:52:38.360]  leaking the coronavirus from the wuhan lab to chide anyone about any kind of behavior and it
[3:52:38.360 --> 3:52:43.480]  comes to social distancing but in this case they're right the chinese communist part is accused
[3:52:43.480 --> 3:52:50.520]  barack obama of creating a super spreader event by hosting a party at martha's vineyard uh they go on
[3:52:50.520 --> 3:52:55.800]  to say in this editorial from the global times which is basically the the mouthpiece of the ccp
[3:52:55.800 --> 3:53:02.200]  is word for word what they want to get out into the world pointing out the double standard of obama
[3:53:02.200 --> 3:53:06.680]  and his rich friends gathering in huge numbers they write it's generally agreed among experts
[3:53:06.680 --> 3:53:11.320]  that vaccinate people should also wear masks and respect respect social distancing to minimize
[3:53:11.320 --> 3:53:15.400]  the risks don't think obama and his friends will be wearing masks but they go on to say
[3:53:16.280 --> 3:53:20.600]  therefore the highly infectious delta variant brings the question of whether obama's upcoming
[3:53:20.600 --> 3:53:25.960]  party will become a super spreader event that overshadows the us has already wretched fight
[3:53:25.960 --> 3:53:30.680]  against the pandemic but again doesn't matter because they're the elite they can do whatever
[3:53:30.680 --> 3:53:36.840]  they want they can literally buy private islands while banning tourists from entering the countries
[3:53:36.840 --> 3:53:42.760]  in which they ensconce themselves and hide themselves away meanwhile information liberation
[3:53:42.760 --> 3:53:50.280]  reports science writer suspended from twitter for quoting results of phyza clinical trial you can't
[3:53:50.280 --> 3:53:56.200]  even quote the results of the vaccine companies trials without getting suspended by twitter now
[3:53:56.200 --> 3:54:01.080]  this is where we're at twitter suspended the account science writer and former new york times
[3:54:01.080 --> 3:54:06.360]  reporter alex baronson for sharing the newly released results of the quote pivotal phyza
[3:54:06.360 --> 3:54:10.600]  clinical trial which completely undermined the narrative of our medical establishment oh gee
[3:54:10.600 --> 3:54:16.360]  i wonder why that's why he got suspended isn't it despite literally word for word quoting the
[3:54:16.360 --> 3:54:22.120]  results from their trial baronson said on a friday blocked again this time for a week
[3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:28.200]  for this tweet which is completely accurate and does nothing but quote phyza's own clinical trial
[3:54:28.200 --> 3:54:35.320]  data this was the tweet quote the pivotal clinical trial for the phyza covid vaccine shows it does
[3:54:35.320 --> 3:54:42.440]  nothing to reduce the overall risk of death zero 15 patients who received the vaccine died
[3:54:42.440 --> 3:54:50.280]  14 who received the placebo died the end literally lifted from phyza's study and then we wonder why
[3:54:50.280 --> 3:54:54.840]  all these vaccinated people are still getting the virus they're still getting hospitalized
[3:54:54.840 --> 3:54:57.720]  yeah because they admit in their own clinical trial it doesn't work
[3:54:57.720 --> 3:55:07.080]  work meanwhile apple vans tinder for unvaxxed after media snitches on company so this uh
[3:55:07.080 --> 3:55:13.400]  entrepreneurial outreach had the foresight to create a dating app in response to the likes
[3:55:13.400 --> 3:55:18.520]  of tinder and bumble coming out and saying they'll give people the right to discriminate on their
[3:55:18.520 --> 3:55:25.000]  app against people who haven't been vaccinated by creating a dating app solely for unvaccinated
[3:55:25.000 --> 3:55:31.640]  people no we can't have that can we launched by two women in hawaii the service thought to
[3:55:31.640 --> 3:55:36.840]  appeal to like-minded people that support medical autonomy and free speech and guess what happened
[3:55:37.880 --> 3:55:45.720]  the snitch grass media found out about it and immediately tattletail to apple and within hours
[3:55:45.720 --> 3:55:53.000]  it was gone from the app store the monopoly that should be abolished because bloomberg news
