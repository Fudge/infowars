[00:00.000 --> 00:14.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:14.280 --> 00:26.080]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well I wouldn't
[00:26.080 --> 00:33.160]  call it Waco Part 2 where the BATF along with the FBI wanted to get anti-terror funding
[00:33.160 --> 00:38.200]  and launch a war against Christians in this country I wouldn't call it what happened on
[00:38.200 --> 00:51.920]  April 19th 1993 on day 51 but this is another conspiracy if you pull back from it what we
[00:51.920 --> 01:00.840]  see unfolding in Waco Texas and the conspiracy is this is part of the drug war and the thug
[01:00.840 --> 01:06.520]  culture that we're living under I wouldn't say this is part of Jade Helmer this is crisis
[01:06.520 --> 01:12.000]  actors and nothing happened up there with the 160 arrested nine dead and a whole bunch
[01:12.000 --> 01:20.440]  of people wounded this is the thug biker gang culture in this country that if we're not
[01:20.440 --> 01:25.040]  careful mixed in with the Crips and the Bloods and the Mexican Mafia and all the rest of
[01:25.040 --> 01:33.640]  it will turn us into something like Mexico economies based on thugism based on gangs
[01:33.640 --> 01:42.040]  of crooks based on on on tribal allegiances this is a prison culture we don't really
[01:42.040 --> 01:46.480]  have universities that give you a future but if you go to prison you will generally be
[01:46.480 --> 01:51.640]  pretty much forced into some type of criminal activity once you get out because what else
[01:51.640 --> 02:04.640]  are you going to do and this is all part of the larger slide into the conquest economy
[02:04.640 --> 02:12.280]  that I talk a lot about now that said the police aren't making a big deal of this but
[02:12.280 --> 02:17.720]  if you read or watch the press conferences they had undercover there they had a uniformed
[02:17.720 --> 02:22.840]  officers there they told to twin peaks this was getting out of control with upwards now
[02:22.840 --> 02:30.760]  of five different major biker gangs there several of them clearly criminal organizations
[02:30.760 --> 02:35.920]  and they knew that something would end up basically flaring up because this is not like
[02:35.920 --> 02:45.240]  a rally or something with a bunch of motorcycle aficionados this is a bunch of basically drug
[02:45.240 --> 02:55.040]  dealing thugs and want to be tough guys who basically want to set up their own type of
[02:55.040 --> 03:01.600]  organized crime operations inside of this country and a lot of times the organized crime higher
[03:01.600 --> 03:06.560]  up levels uses the motorcycle gangs as their puppets and then the motorcycle gangs like
[03:06.560 --> 03:11.520]  the banditos the hell's angels and others have their own motorcycle gang puppets underneath
[03:11.520 --> 03:19.000]  them and it is just absolutely the antithesis of the culture I meant to I've talked a lot
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.240]  about this whether they're black gangs white gangs Hispanic gangs Asian gangs corrupt
[03:24.240 --> 03:28.800]  police departments that become gangs government that become thugs and gangs you know the Nazis
[03:28.800 --> 03:36.520]  were a gang the communists were a gang it is gang culture that is a plague on this country
[03:36.520 --> 03:45.240]  and I personally have seen motorcycle gangs be rude to people's families in South Padre
[03:45.240 --> 03:52.320]  I've seen them be rude to people out in the parking lot at the rodeo and motorcycle gangs
[03:52.320 --> 03:56.280]  more and more are going to meet with the fate they met with the police when they messed
[03:56.280 --> 04:00.240]  with citizens a lot of citizens was just pulling assault rifle out of their car and waste you
[04:00.240 --> 04:08.080]  know 1015 of these bikers because people are sick of guys running around trying to act
[04:08.080 --> 04:11.600]  tough and intimidate everybody because they're so hard and they're willing to go to prison
[04:11.600 --> 04:16.800]  oh I'm so impressed you're willing to go to prison you're willing to not want to have
[04:16.800 --> 04:22.960]  a future oh you're so cool oh you deal drugs that the government ships in oh how impressive
[04:22.960 --> 04:29.360]  we're also scared and of course they ran up into a larger gang the police that were just
[04:29.360 --> 04:34.160]  waiting for something to happen if the police have done anything wrong it's that they are
[04:34.160 --> 04:38.040]  not making a bigger deal about exactly who they shot win because I bet when it comes
[04:38.040 --> 04:42.840]  out some biker pulled out a gun started shooting and the cops just wasted a whole group of
[04:42.840 --> 04:48.240]  them no turns they're not even saying which bikers they killed yet but we've got a good
[04:48.240 --> 04:53.400]  idea if you go to drudgereport.com they've got a photo of the scene with the Cossacks
[04:53.400 --> 05:02.480]  out there with their Nazi thunderbolts all over their arms we'll be back the hashtag
[05:02.480 --> 05:08.320]  black lives matter is being used by demonstrators all across the country but why should it be
[05:08.320 --> 05:13.400]  capped with the actions of police what if it was expanded to include another area where
[05:13.400 --> 05:19.080]  lives are being lost abortion it wasn't that long ago that new york reported it had more
[05:19.080 --> 05:25.600]  black babies aborted than born with this in mind join the black lives matter demonstration

[09:07.080 --> 09:14.520]  today with steve quail and will open the phones up in the third hour with steve quail that said
[09:14.520 --> 09:20.360]  wake up is back in the headlines not for the brutal siege that killed so many young children
[09:20.360 --> 09:29.800]  back in 1993 ending in a fiery explosion no it's at a twin peaks uh basically bikini bar
[09:31.640 --> 09:37.560]  it's similar to hooters and it happened just up the road from where we broadcast from here in
[09:37.560 --> 09:45.640]  austin texas the causax the bandidos and other groups listed by law enforcement as organized crime
[09:45.640 --> 09:55.640]  at least five different biker gangs were meeting there and the twin peaks management
[09:56.920 --> 10:03.880]  refused to do anything according to police to mitigate the situation so the police
[10:04.440 --> 10:10.120]  staked it out as best we know because quite frankly government lies so much i just don't
[10:10.120 --> 10:14.360]  believe things out of hand but it may be true probably is true there's a lot of witnesses
[10:14.360 --> 10:23.720]  confirming what they saw and you've got nine dead a whole bunch of people wounded 160 plus arrested
[10:23.720 --> 10:33.720]  when yesterday at high noon someone disrespected someone's uh you know prison etiquette out in
[10:33.720 --> 10:40.920]  the bathroom area stall area that spilt into the parking lot where fights started and knife
[10:40.920 --> 10:47.640]  fights and firearms were pulled out and then supposedly as soon as the gunfire started echoing
[10:47.640 --> 10:56.040]  the police took out some of the bikers they're not saying how many uh that's probably because
[10:56.040 --> 11:02.520]  they took all of them out and then don't want it to sound like they just executed them uh we've got
[11:02.520 --> 11:08.920]  the controlled left running around saying it's white privilege because of the way that the
[11:08.920 --> 11:17.400]  bikers were treated uh you mean put on the ground handcuffed and sent to jail the police
[11:17.400 --> 11:24.120]  setting up checkpoints down the road as more people arrived arresting them as part of suspicion
[11:24.120 --> 11:32.920]  and organized crime ring they're basically throwing the book out now anyone who's a
[11:32.920 --> 11:39.000]  routine listener knows that I don't like motorcycle gangs I don't dislike the veterans groups that
[11:39.000 --> 11:45.080]  like to have their own uh clubs that's great they go out and do community service or Christian
[11:45.080 --> 11:49.480]  groups and you've got to write if you want to have a group and you know get a reputation as
[11:49.480 --> 11:57.080]  tough guys or whatever that's your issue but I personally and people I know when they've had
[11:57.080 --> 12:04.120]  families with them including myself once have had motorcycle gangs aggressively pull up on the
[12:04.120 --> 12:17.000]  curb in front of me and then ask me about have a problem and I just freeze and start getting angry
[12:18.920 --> 12:23.560]  and in both cases they didn't push it which is a good thing because man I'm not out here wearing
[12:23.560 --> 12:28.920]  leather and tough guys stuff and skulls and swastikas all over me and everything I just want
[12:28.920 --> 12:32.760]  to have a free country and my children have a future but I mean nice people are the most
[12:32.760 --> 12:38.680]  violent vicious people around everybody knows that and these biker gangs are a joke and need to be
[12:38.680 --> 12:45.560]  dealt with or we're going to end up being just like Mexico which has got a bunch of gangs fighting
[12:45.560 --> 12:52.600]  with each other ruling the country and it's disintegrating into hell on earth but in America
[12:52.600 --> 12:58.600]  the thug culture not just in the Mexican mafia or in the crypts in the bloods with the black
[12:58.600 --> 13:04.360]  fugs or with the white supremacists out of the prisons and the prison culture but with the media
[13:04.360 --> 13:11.480]  and MTV I don't care whether it's country music or hip hop thugism is cool and we've seen it adopted
[13:11.480 --> 13:18.760]  in the police departments in many areas we've seen it adopted in the US military gangs are just rampant
[13:18.760 --> 13:22.760]  and it's what you see when a society is declining
[13:28.520 --> 13:38.040]  it's what you see in a system where things aren't based on ideas and based on free association
[13:38.040 --> 13:47.000]  and based on uh valuing the individual it's it's based on mindless primitive law of the jungle
[13:47.000 --> 13:55.160]  thugism and it's what brought down the roman empire the nazi party if they were anything
[13:55.160 --> 13:58.840]  were an organized criminal street gang made up of military veterans
[14:04.040 --> 14:09.640]  this is the thug culture I talk about and I don't care if it's a group of black thugs
[14:09.640 --> 14:15.960]  uh at Barton Springs pool threatening white people that I witnessed two saturday nights ago
[14:17.240 --> 14:24.840]  and who walked by me and made obnoxious statements uh to the friends I was with because there were
[14:24.840 --> 14:30.440]  some attractive ladies there basically give us your women we're gonna have sex with them
[14:30.440 --> 14:34.280]  oh you don't like it how would you like to get popped up side the headcracker
[14:34.280 --> 14:41.880]  this isn't america it isn't where I want to be and I'm telling you I grew up in Dallas and
[14:41.880 --> 14:48.760]  saw a lot of this and it was it was it was not fun and I was a creature not not not of it but in it
[14:50.920 --> 14:59.480]  and I didn't go around acting tough I was tough and I didn't go around wearing gangster outfits
[14:59.480 --> 15:06.120]  I went around wearing polo shirts and I guess that's why people wanted trouble well they got it and
[15:06.120 --> 15:13.640]  the same thing goes today now I've lived in Austin for 23 24 years since my last year of high school
[15:15.240 --> 15:22.920]  and I've never had to deal in just general areas of Austin with gangster activity thug activity
[15:22.920 --> 15:27.800]  motorcycle gang activity and I'm telling you it's going on all over the place
[15:27.800 --> 15:34.920]  and that's why I carry a firearm because I'm not going to get some knockdown drag out with some
[15:34.920 --> 15:41.720]  bikers or with some uh black racist thugs or Mexican racist thugs somebody tries to assault me
[15:41.720 --> 15:51.800]  I'm just going to defend my family center of ass and I couldn't imagine being around 165 170
[15:51.800 --> 15:59.160]  criminal motorcycle gang people uh and a fight not breaking out between them and I totally get what
[15:59.160 --> 16:05.400]  the police did up in Waco probably shooting all nine of them because they were just going to run
[16:05.400 --> 16:08.600]  around and wave their guns around and probably shoot in the air and the rest of it and see
[16:08.600 --> 16:12.360]  the real world encroached putting them six feet under
[16:15.880 --> 16:18.200]  but I'm just tired of driving down a country road
[16:18.200 --> 16:23.800]  and there'll be a couple guys in motorcycle gang and they'll kind of get over in the lane
[16:23.800 --> 16:27.560]  and bug their eyes out at you I mean all that's going to happen if you chase me down so I'm just
[16:27.560 --> 16:32.760]  going to get out of my car with a m4 and defend myself I mean I'm not looking for trouble but
[16:33.320 --> 16:41.160]  I mean you guys just really have a death wish I don't like ISIS they're the exact same kind of people
[16:41.160 --> 16:48.760]  running around in their gang running around with their with their black outfits and their flags
[16:48.760 --> 16:55.000]  and taking over cities taking over towns raping and killing the Christians I'll tell you I've
[16:55.000 --> 17:00.680]  seen the New York police act like gangs I've seen um other police departments act like it when
[17:00.680 --> 17:07.160]  they attacked our reporters in Ferguson just shooting them with rubber bullets and tear
[17:07.160 --> 17:13.880]  gassing them for no reason makes me want to throw up but this is what we've got is just a nation of
[17:13.880 --> 17:21.720]  a bunch of men that think it's tough to act like thugs and criminals what's tough is to be strong
[17:21.720 --> 17:26.440]  and to be honorable and to build a good civilization and to be involved in community service that
[17:26.440 --> 17:30.760]  really helps people and by community service I mean standing up against the tyrants usurping
[17:30.760 --> 17:34.760]  the country our country is being taken over by foreign banks our country is being leveled and
[17:34.760 --> 17:39.960]  turned into a criminal enterprise completely you can argue it's always had problems but I mean it's
[17:39.960 --> 17:47.560]  really here now and a lot of people are just giving up on believing in a free market system
[17:47.560 --> 17:53.400]  and they're joining with the criminal system because this is the key point they see foreign
[17:53.400 --> 18:00.840]  mega gangs the foreign banking cartels that run the major mercenary and paramilitary groups
[18:00.840 --> 18:06.520]  and the control our foreign policy and control our Pentagon taking control of everything and
[18:06.520 --> 18:14.360]  getting away with it and so young people say hey I'm going to go join organized crime I'm going to
[18:14.360 --> 18:23.320]  break the law I'm not going to engage in a policy of truth I'm going to engage in a policy of
[18:23.320 --> 18:30.360]  dishonor and I'm only going to be honorable to my dirtbag gang and there is no honor in these
[18:30.360 --> 18:35.800]  dirtbag gangs they talk about honor all day all they do is use people and they're dishonorable
[18:35.800 --> 18:47.720]  to each other and there's no honor amongst thieves we are a nation of sheep as Thomas Jefferson said
[18:47.720 --> 18:56.680]  if we ever became a nation of sheep we would be ruled by wolves and we are now ruled by wolves and
[18:56.680 --> 19:04.600]  we're going into a total wolf predator culture and it's destroying productivity and prosperity and
[19:04.600 --> 19:15.800]  security and it will force egalitarian true liberals classical liberals paleo conservatives
[19:15.800 --> 19:18.680]  constitutionalists wherever you want to call people like me
[19:18.680 --> 19:29.880]  into going into a fortress mentality it'll force mainly mainline conservatives to join with the
[19:29.880 --> 19:34.920]  police state as an answer to the thugism they see growing on the outside and that will only
[19:34.920 --> 19:42.280]  turn us over to a centralized gang system that's even worse we are degenerating slowly but surely
[19:42.280 --> 19:50.040]  into a road warrior scenario and it's not glamorous like the movies it's hellish

[24:07.320 --> 24:12.680]  it was about a month ago we're about six weeks into intensifying jade helm hysteria
[24:13.480 --> 24:16.520]  both by the government the control corporate media but also the public
[24:16.520 --> 24:24.040]  and about a two three weeks into it a month ago i said look i've looked at every angle of this the
[24:24.040 --> 24:28.360]  way the media is hyping it the way they keep saying that i'm saying it's an imminent invasion
[24:28.360 --> 24:33.800]  an imminent takeover it could be that they're planning major race riots throughout the summer
[24:33.800 --> 24:37.880]  which we know they're already pushing via the justice department and this could be an excuse
[24:37.880 --> 24:42.840]  to pre-deploy them i'm not saying that we're speculating we're saying we're speculating
[24:42.840 --> 24:49.240]  it could be they're planning to run false flags against the military during the operations
[24:49.240 --> 24:55.240]  and then claim that we in the new media the alternative media the patriot media spurred that
[24:56.760 --> 25:00.440]  it could be they are profiling areas where they know unstable people are
[25:01.720 --> 25:05.640]  that will get scared and think it's some type of un red dawn invasion
[25:06.600 --> 25:11.160]  and there could be friendly fire there could be a friendly fire operation that can be blamed
[25:11.160 --> 25:17.720]  in the public there are so many angles well louis gohmert is on the homeland security
[25:18.520 --> 25:25.640]  committee terrorism homeland security committee in the house he is the deputy chair the vice chair
[25:26.840 --> 25:30.680]  so he's privy and he's been on the show before he is a listener i'll just leave it at that
[25:31.640 --> 25:34.840]  we just don't have him on anymore he'd come on as they make a big deal out of it and
[25:36.280 --> 25:40.840]  just as we're not here to give the enemy any any gas mileage the point is gohmert is on the
[25:40.840 --> 25:45.960]  homeland security committee he knows what's going on okay he's an army officer a veteran
[25:47.560 --> 25:52.200]  combat veteran he he's a smart guy he doesn't hate the military like the media says he says
[25:52.200 --> 25:57.560]  he's never seen in an article he put out a week ago a week and a half ago the military listing
[25:57.560 --> 26:01.880]  states his hostile he's never seen domestic preparations like this well in a new article
[26:01.880 --> 26:10.920]  that was published sunday in a texas paper we're linked to it on info wars.com the congressman came
[26:10.920 --> 26:16.840]  out and said that it's clear that they're trying to provoke a fight with texas
[26:19.320 --> 26:26.280]  and that they may want to try to get people to do something of the military as a pretext to
[26:26.280 --> 26:30.520]  demonize the liberty movement so he's saying exactly what i'm saying and i don't know whether
[26:30.520 --> 26:34.520]  he's independently getting this information or he's listening to the show and agrees with it
[26:35.160 --> 26:40.840]  or whether he just came to his own conclusion the point is you've got senator cruse congressman
[26:40.840 --> 26:47.400]  gohmert governor abbot all of them agreeing that we've got too many federal power grabs happening
[26:47.400 --> 26:53.880]  i mean again the president outside of law has dissolved the border pays to ship the illegals in
[26:53.880 --> 27:02.200]  from somalia you name it gives them free vouchers gives them id cards that lets them vote that's
[27:02.200 --> 27:08.360]  totally lawless is shutting off our power plants is shipping guns into mexico to blame the second
[27:08.360 --> 27:14.040]  amendment they got caught with those documents cbs news they're running mangas either funding al-qaeda
[27:14.040 --> 27:22.040]  they are starting wars with russia they are uh just just federalizing everything of course
[27:22.040 --> 27:29.000]  when you see an unprecedented 10 state two-month drill where they talk about doing illegal things
[27:29.560 --> 27:34.840]  you know simulated illegal things and dressing in civilian attire and interfacing with the public
[27:39.080 --> 27:44.200]  you'd be crazy not to say hey we should look into this but that's all we said six weeks ago back in
[27:44.200 --> 27:52.520]  march we did not say it's imminent takeover look out lock and load but that's what the media keeps
[27:52.520 --> 28:01.560]  saying we're saying so jade helm from the preparations for race riots and civil unrest
[28:01.560 --> 28:06.120]  and all these top anthropologists and sociologists and political scientists saying they believe
[28:06.120 --> 28:10.520]  there's going to be race riots this summer that could quote destabilize and bring down the country
[28:10.520 --> 28:16.680]  we were showing those headlines last week mainstream news to all the weird military
[28:16.680 --> 28:22.440]  preparations the economy is obviously going into free fall right now uh you've got all
[28:22.440 --> 28:28.600]  these ramped up preparations to take on the liberty movement i don't know what the globalists
[28:28.600 --> 28:37.160]  are going to do i i know their playbook i know their playbook i know what's in the playbook
[28:37.160 --> 28:42.440]  i don't know what play they're going to call until i see them line up on the line
[28:42.440 --> 28:47.000]  11 guys on the line then i can try to you know know what the next move is going to be but
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.800]  that might be a a a trick it could be something else
[28:55.160 --> 29:01.800]  the parallels with football or chess or any game and was what's happening currently
[29:01.800 --> 29:09.240]  are staggering i just know this there's a massive build up in preparation that does not appear to
[29:09.240 --> 29:15.800]  be a drill on so many fronts not just jade helm we're getting videos every day or two
[29:17.240 --> 29:23.000]  of urban warfare drills training to take on veterans gun owners libertarians sovereign
[29:23.000 --> 29:31.640]  citizens so there's a giant gear up going on not for the motorcycle gangs not for the mexican
[29:31.640 --> 29:38.680]  mafia not for the cribson bloods not for all the crime we see out there it's for the patriots

[30:03.640 --> 30:09.560]  by fritch un soldiers fritch authorities were notified nine months ago by a un whistleblower
[30:09.560 --> 30:16.040]  under's compass of the rape and sodomy of at least 10 starving and homeless boys some as young as
[30:16.040 --> 30:22.360]  nine over a period of seven months in the central african republic un secretary general bonke moon
[30:22.360 --> 30:27.800]  was far more upset about the leak of the information than he was about the crime calling it a serious
[30:27.800 --> 30:32.920]  breach of protocol and he took immediate action against the whistleblower not against the un
[30:32.920 --> 30:38.600]  sexual predators this is far from an isolated incidents of un troops preying on civilians
[30:38.600 --> 30:44.040]  that were sent to protect and having the un cover up their crimes identical atrocities committed by
[30:44.040 --> 30:49.080]  un soldiers in Haiti surfaced just three months ago and it's happened in virtually every country

[33:15.640 --> 33:21.480]  political advance information management has become so sophisticated every administration
[33:21.480 --> 33:27.320]  learns from the previous i've got a pen and i've got a phone there are actions i have the legal
[33:27.320 --> 33:32.280]  authority to take as president what do you say to someone who believes the president took action
[33:32.280 --> 33:37.480]  to change the law we did not change the law we acted within the law what you're not paying attention
[33:37.480 --> 33:54.120]  to is the fact that i just took an action to change the law
[34:07.480 --> 34:12.360]  the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[34:15.640 --> 34:19.800]  breaking the law breaking the law breaking the law breaking the law
[34:21.560 --> 34:27.720]  and that is a society that we're plunging into armored vehicles checkpoints militarized police
[34:27.720 --> 34:35.160]  motorcycle gangs hordes of third world populations pouring in as their populations explode and the
[34:35.160 --> 34:42.760]  e u says european union countries must have quotas of millions of illegals a year to be
[34:42.760 --> 34:48.440]  legalized and given everything free to further maneuver the nations towards bankruptcy and
[34:48.440 --> 34:55.080]  collapse so the mega banks can then consolidate and buy up everything in the country for pennies on
[34:55.080 --> 35:02.280]  the dollar then they'll shut the borders down for good use the internal third world populations
[35:02.280 --> 35:08.680]  as the new political body for divide and conquer while carrying out forced population reduction
[35:08.680 --> 35:15.000]  in the third world that's the next phase of this but right now they're bringing in substantive enough
[35:15.000 --> 35:24.280]  numbers for the balkanization great game model i do not believe the historic
[35:24.280 --> 35:35.640]  historic shootout in waco from what i've seen 24 hours into this it'll be 24 hours and about 30
[35:35.640 --> 35:42.120]  minutes i do not believe this is an inside job a false flag a staged event in waco at the twin
[35:42.120 --> 35:54.520]  peaks burger joint i do not think that that's what happened here that said i do think there's a
[35:54.520 --> 36:00.440]  conspiracy but it's a bigger conspiracy the fake drug war the thugging of our culture
[36:01.560 --> 36:06.360]  the fact that prisons are divided into the different racial gangs black white hispanic
[36:06.360 --> 36:13.000]  and if it's on the east or west coast areas like new york or la asian they break the jails
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.760]  into five different groups four to five different groups and then you basically have to submit to
[36:18.760 --> 36:27.720]  one of those prison gangs or uh you get raped or even killed this is turning our society into a
[36:27.720 --> 36:33.960]  divide and conquer system from the most basic level then you get out of jail you can't get any job
[36:33.960 --> 36:40.280]  that's worth anything because you have a criminal record so you go out you start robbing houses you
[36:40.280 --> 36:47.480]  go out and start robbing warehouses or you cook meth and fetamine or you sell dope then that money
[36:47.480 --> 36:54.200]  is basically laundered through big banks payoffs are made to police uh at first small levels then
[36:54.200 --> 36:58.120]  more and more police are basically brought into it because the ones that won't play ball are kicked
[36:58.120 --> 37:02.600]  out then you have a corruption of the police department then a corruption of the city the
[37:02.600 --> 37:10.680]  county the state and finally the fall of the nation as we know it and it was about five years ago i
[37:10.680 --> 37:22.600]  did a special report on how the drug war and the opium wars were used to destroy china it was a
[37:22.600 --> 37:29.320]  sovereign strong country china 500 years ago and i'm going off just basic numbers you can
[37:29.320 --> 37:37.880]  pull up the history this is just a gestalt a simplification outlawed the importation of opium
[37:38.520 --> 37:41.880]  out of india and vietnam
[37:46.920 --> 37:53.640]  into their country the british only had a few ports they were allowed to operate
[37:53.640 --> 38:01.080]  really about 400 years ago is when it really got cranking discovered 500 but
[38:03.400 --> 38:07.160]  i mean they had a land passage to it but about 450 years ago they began to
[38:07.800 --> 38:12.120]  be able to have shipping into the area going around the horn of africa
[38:14.440 --> 38:18.040]  going around the southernmost tip of the africa and then and then around the horn and
[38:18.040 --> 38:28.360]  up over to china and the indian sea and the subcontinent and they began to import opium into
[38:29.000 --> 38:35.800]  china and china made it illegal and it took them well over 100 years just to get a foothold
[38:35.800 --> 38:41.400]  in port cities but then they could corrupt the local officials who could get some of the money
[38:41.400 --> 38:48.440]  because it was a black market and incredible amounts of money would be paid for the addicting addictive
[38:48.440 --> 38:56.520]  substance then you fast forward another hundred years to about 200 years ago and china itself
[38:56.520 --> 39:03.240]  had been broken into several pieces and later broken into more than 12 pieces
[39:03.240 --> 39:14.440]  as the entire country was subdivided by western powers who then occupied different sectors
[39:16.440 --> 39:23.240]  of china and it was all done because china made drugs illegal and now you look at mexico
[39:23.240 --> 39:30.120]  suffering the same fate broken in pieces you see the us now with the dea and others clearly
[39:30.120 --> 39:36.840]  involved in narcotics trafficking it's come out in congress the cia and they have now been able
[39:36.840 --> 39:44.840]  to effectively export this to the united states i've told the story many times up until the early
[39:44.840 --> 39:51.240]  1930s when prohibition of alcohol ended they needed the big drug gangs and the corrupt police
[39:51.240 --> 39:57.960]  in many cities they needed something new that was illegal so they lobbied through christian groups
[39:57.960 --> 40:09.240]  that they funded and through pta's to outlaw heroin opium its precursor cocaine and other
[40:09.240 --> 40:15.800]  items and so cocaine was taken out of dr pepper cocaine was taken out of coca-cola it had coke
[40:15.800 --> 40:20.840]  and cola in it that's why it's called coke folks see hiding in plain view i was getting
[40:20.840 --> 40:25.560]  emails saying i'm making that up though the secret ingredient they call it a secret ingredient
[40:25.560 --> 40:31.000]  people get upset it's decokinated cocaine that's cocaine flavor it's what cola is
[40:32.440 --> 40:35.000]  well it's coke mixed with cola another flavoring
[40:39.720 --> 40:44.840]  and they basically i mean if you look at the numbers portugal's totally decriminalized all
[40:44.840 --> 40:51.400]  drugs and more than half of the drug uses ended the last decade their prison population is shrunken
[40:51.400 --> 40:55.800]  size that's because the globalist already run that country and and and just made the decision to
[40:55.800 --> 41:01.640]  not destabilize it so they've moved in the right direction i guess there's some positives when the
[41:01.640 --> 41:05.880]  globalist totally run your country or wanted as a safe haven like switzerland they kind of
[41:05.880 --> 41:12.280]  start leaving you alone and in the wartime economy but not here we are a sector for this to happen
[41:13.160 --> 41:18.200]  and the drug war is a hidden tax not just in the billions it costs every year but
[41:18.200 --> 41:22.760]  the liberties we lose uh the young people getting on drugs the women selling themselves for drugs
[41:23.560 --> 41:30.600]  the houses getting broken into uh so that people can steal items to fund their drug habit
[41:32.040 --> 41:37.000]  the list goes on and on with the problems it causes but nevertheless you can argue with the
[41:37.000 --> 41:45.880]  facts that you can walk in to a drug store and go up to the soda fountain until the mid 1930s
[41:45.880 --> 41:53.400]  and tell them what you wanted to be put in your drink with the soda water and get yourself a
[41:53.400 --> 41:59.640]  opium drink a cocaine drink a mix of the two whatever you wanted they had it
[42:02.200 --> 42:09.320]  that's to leave it to beaver world or basically beaver's parents that's the world they grew up in
[42:09.320 --> 42:16.760]  there's the headline out of the atlantic magazine why we took cocaine out of soda a story of social
[42:16.760 --> 42:26.680]  injustice and a most wonderful invigorator of sexual origins and that's a whitewash article
[42:26.680 --> 42:31.480]  out of the atlantic and you can scroll down it shows a woman having a really good time dancing
[42:31.480 --> 42:37.880]  uh pouring herself a little little cocaine laden drink along with some wine
[42:40.680 --> 42:46.120]  when cocaine and alcohol meet inside a person they create a third unique drug and then it breaks
[42:46.120 --> 42:51.240]  it down and it works like cocaine but with more euphoria how do you pronounce that word
[42:52.360 --> 42:56.520]  so small on screen i can't see it coca ethylene
[42:56.520 --> 43:04.040]  and so it goes on to break down how they started mixing the two the point is is that this was all
[43:04.040 --> 43:12.600]  available and i don't want to spend the whole hour on a history lesson this is how we were
[43:12.600 --> 43:18.840]  destabilized this is how we were taken over and we're two-thirds of the way down the same road
[43:18.840 --> 43:24.600]  that china went down under globalism they create mega regions north american union
[43:24.600 --> 43:32.840]  that american union european union asian union pacific union all of them overlapping all of
[43:32.840 --> 43:39.720]  them merging into one global union in their own words but within the unions they're going to break
[43:39.720 --> 43:49.400]  countries and regions into smaller subgroups to then exploit them and so if you want to understand
[43:49.400 --> 43:58.600]  what happened up in weiko with the nine dead and the rest of it some of the only places you can make
[43:58.600 --> 44:08.440]  money is in drug dealing or in prostitution these days and there's going to be people who are going
[44:08.440 --> 44:17.000]  to want to take advantage of that and make money off of it now the smart gangs wear suits and ties
[44:17.000 --> 44:22.440]  and don't call themselves gangs the stupid gangs have their pants hanging down around their
[44:24.280 --> 44:29.800]  rare ends and and and and want run around trying to act thuggish and tough and really stupid women
[44:29.800 --> 44:36.280]  think those are successful guys then you've got to step up from that at the end of the korean war
[44:37.480 --> 44:43.320]  simultaneously in places like texas you see the bandidos established by white supremacists
[44:43.320 --> 44:50.760]  uh you see uh the hell's angels established by white supremacists you see the mongols established
[44:50.760 --> 44:56.840]  by people that wanted to let hispanics in jessie ventura was in the mongols only for a short period
[44:59.640 --> 45:02.120]  and you see other groups forming around the country
[45:04.440 --> 45:07.960]  because these are people that have been through a bunch of combat that have got issues
[45:07.960 --> 45:16.920]  and who basically just want to go out and make money but as they've degenerated they've gotten
[45:16.920 --> 45:22.040]  even more thuggish and are literally just about acting tough and seeing who can be sent to prison
[45:22.040 --> 45:29.800]  the most often and again if you didn't have the drug culture and you didn't have the prisons
[45:29.800 --> 45:36.280]  that are the universities for all of this i mean if you're 18 years old now and you get in a fist
[45:36.280 --> 45:43.240]  fight and somebody gets hurt they're going to put you in prison most of the time and after you spend
[45:43.240 --> 45:49.880]  a year in prison you're going to go in be forced to do a white supremacist or black supremacist
[45:49.880 --> 45:55.960]  or hispanic supremacist organization if you show yourself to be tough you're going to end up being
[45:55.960 --> 46:05.000]  recruited into a gang a real gang not the wannabe gangs once you get out and that's it the rest of
[46:05.000 --> 46:10.520]  your life is shut and you'll be used and think it's cool that you're a three-time loser by the
[46:10.520 --> 46:18.120]  time you're 30 in prison for life in a private prison owned by the very private central banks
[46:18.120 --> 46:28.120]  that launder 500 billion dollars conservatively in the united states a year wells fargo and
[46:28.120 --> 46:37.480]  wilcovia in two years alone 2006 and 2007 look it up in bloomberg laundered 378 billion dollars
[46:39.320 --> 46:44.120]  when they quote got caught running the aircraft themselves when the dea didn't know what the
[46:44.120 --> 46:52.840]  other hand was doing they were given a 111 million dollar fine on 378 billion
[46:52.840 --> 46:58.840]  that'd be like if i robbed a bank for a million and the cops got there and i gave them a tip
[46:58.840 --> 47:04.600]  of four thousand dollars all that is a tip to the government
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.960]  you're walking out with bags of diamonds over here over your back and gold and all you do is
[47:11.960 --> 47:19.560]  give them a gold coin and a diamond ring so the truth is the the establishment wants to siphon
[47:19.560 --> 47:25.640]  all this money off the old guys playing golf the old guys that own the banks the old guys that got
[47:25.640 --> 47:30.120]  the cops down the street guarding their house real quiet real friendly real nice speak with
[47:30.120 --> 47:36.760]  perfect atlantic accents they run the show in their private jets they're smart they're criminals
[47:36.760 --> 47:43.400]  they're evil they're predatory they've got god to deal with their daughters end up ending up being
[47:43.400 --> 47:50.680]  screwed up and their sons but nevertheless they're the real kingpins like tony montana says in scarface
[47:51.400 --> 47:58.040]  written by of course one of the best screenwriters out there all over stone based on real stories
[47:58.040 --> 48:03.240]  and real people like mario puzos the godfather the names were changed those are all real people in
[48:03.240 --> 48:10.760]  that movie that's a true story it's a composite but it's a true story just like the patriot with
[48:10.760 --> 48:17.640]  mel Gibson it's all true but it was three people the swamp fox and two others
[48:22.520 --> 48:28.680]  and remember tony tells his uh his his best friend his best friend wants him to go with the
[48:28.680 --> 48:33.000]  mafia and and and and wanted the money so they get a bigger percentage don't have to pay the banks
[48:33.000 --> 48:39.960]  he goes listen tony montana goes it's the wasp guys that have got every angle figured out that's
[48:39.960 --> 48:43.960]  who i'm going to invest with we're going to get raided if we don't put all our money
[48:43.960 --> 48:49.560]  in the federal reserves basically what he says but his buddy goes and does it anyways and they get
[48:49.560 --> 49:00.680]  busted that's what happened to the italians america was so controlled by the 50s and the fbi
[49:00.680 --> 49:06.920]  was so blackmailed by the by la costa nostra the family and other organizations that they would say
[49:06.920 --> 49:17.400]  no organized crime existed that's how dumb they were keeping the public no organized crime existed
[49:21.000 --> 49:27.080]  isn't that just special when my dad's great uncle
[49:29.800 --> 49:34.600]  i'm not even gonna tell the story the point is is that it's always been part of the culture
[49:34.600 --> 49:39.320]  here it's just now they've set it up where it's taking over the entire culture
[49:41.560 --> 49:43.560]  and now the system is waging war
[49:47.320 --> 49:53.880]  against anyone who isn't part of the criminal system and that's when you collapse into nigeria
[49:53.880 --> 50:01.080]  or mexico or north korea and we've now reached the tipping point very close to that i mean it's
[50:01.080 --> 50:06.120]  an organized gang of government that illegally listens to the phone calls and tapes everything
[50:06.120 --> 50:11.240]  and the dea it's all illegal and they just do it as an organized revolution against freedom
[50:11.800 --> 50:15.800]  it's an organized revolution against freedom for obama to just open the borders and ship any
[50:15.800 --> 50:27.720]  legals and give them free everything welcome to the jungle welcome to the law of the biggest thug
[50:27.720 --> 50:34.680]  welcome to tyranny and so no i don't think there's a conspiracy behind this biker gang
[50:36.520 --> 50:39.320]  they're so out of control over the country i'm surprised more of this doesn't happen
[50:40.680 --> 50:44.920]  but the bigger conspiracy is the drug dealers that own the private federal reserve that
[50:44.920 --> 50:49.240]  launder all the money and run the whole show and have the prisons as their recruiting arms
[50:50.040 --> 50:56.840]  for their armies of tyranny their armies of scum have set up this paradigm by design
[50:56.840 --> 50:59.080]  that is the conspiracy

[53:57.240 --> 54:05.560]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[54:06.920 --> 54:13.320]  all right i'm not going to belabor the biker event anymore other than to say we need the police to
[54:13.320 --> 54:20.440]  come out and break down exactly what happened and how many people they shot because the fact
[54:20.440 --> 54:24.920]  that they're keeping it very quiet it's just a minor footnote that oh there were shots being
[54:24.920 --> 54:28.920]  fired some of them were in the direction of police so they shot some of the bikers well
[54:28.920 --> 54:34.360]  how many did you shoot the fact that they're holding that back makes me suspicious
[54:35.320 --> 54:40.840]  um i'm not going to really second guess what's going on here with a bunch of organized crime
[54:40.840 --> 54:46.120]  gangs meeting because i don't think we'll ever know the full truth even though they're surveillance
[54:46.120 --> 54:56.200]  cameras but i'll say this the second amendment is there for the individual to not be pushed around
[54:56.840 --> 55:06.200]  by outlaw motorcycle gangs by other street gangs by thugs by criminals and by tyrannical government
[55:06.200 --> 55:15.720]  this is the reason we have the second amendment throughout history groups of 20 30 40 50 100 200
[55:15.720 --> 55:23.000]  men would get together they didn't have villages they didn't go fishing they didn't go hunting
[55:23.000 --> 55:32.120]  they didn't smelt uh metal to sell the neighboring tribe uh they didn't produce things they would raid
[55:32.120 --> 55:42.920]  and every culture had these types in them and they would basically prey on populations
[55:42.920 --> 55:50.440]  and they would rob them and they would kill the men and rape the women and enslave the children
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.160]  to take them back to their home base the teenagers to work as slaves for them
[55:55.160 --> 56:03.640]  and that's where slave culture came from was by warring cultures that did not want to do the
[56:03.640 --> 56:09.400]  menial work themselves but who wanted to go around stealing land and yes you'll notice that in our
[56:09.400 --> 56:15.640]  founding as a country you have that culture which was dominant around the world parallel with an
[56:15.640 --> 56:27.560]  agrarian and uh manufacturing system as well and so it's been a fight between conquest civilization
[56:29.640 --> 56:35.640]  and renaissance civilization and there's really no such thing as a conquest civilization for very
[56:35.640 --> 56:40.680]  long because things degenerate and they break down and my broadcast is against the conquest
[56:40.680 --> 56:53.800]  civilization i would want to see a happy village on the ocean producing finished goods involved in
[56:53.800 --> 57:06.040]  trade with their neighbors weaving clothing manufacturing jewelry putting salted fish
[57:06.040 --> 57:12.440]  in a barrel i mean i'm just giving you a nordic version of this and becoming a teaming metropolitan
[57:12.440 --> 57:23.400]  base after a few hundred years that is the towering achievement in the region but nine times out of
[57:23.400 --> 57:30.840]  ten there would then be raiders against it and so you have to produce a military to protect against
[57:30.840 --> 57:36.520]  the raiders and then over time that military would generally take over the kingdom degenerate it and
[57:36.520 --> 57:41.800]  it would fall apart and it's that same cycle we go through over and over again and that's where
[57:41.800 --> 57:47.160]  we're headed right now with predatory government predatory population a thug culture degenerating
[57:47.160 --> 57:52.760]  out of control because we've lost our roots we're going to come back hit some other news and then
[57:52.760 --> 57:57.240]  we're going to get steve quail on on the latest on jade helm congressman gohmert says he believes

[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:28.040]  from Austin Texas Alex Jones best-selling author extremely controversial steve quayle joining
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:35.640]  us the balance of the next two hours look thumbs up in the second hour today I was talking about
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:41.880]  Dallas growing up in Dallas in the thug culture I saw there whether it was the rednecks or the
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:49.160]  black folks everybody fought with each other everybody fought with the other groups it was
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:54.600]  not fun and people that were bigger than you just seemed to always want to start a fight
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.560]  until they were crying for mommy
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:08.200]  sometimes they didn't cry for mommy at all but now you see the rise of the Mexican mafia
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:13.880]  and ms-13 and the motorcycle gangs and the black gangs you all pretty much already killed each
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:22.200]  other in the 80s and 90s it is just a mess and I have had black gangs I've really had a spanish
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:28.520]  gang's ever seen anything I've had black groups of thugs three times the last couple months
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.640]  shoot their mouths off and say racist things to me for no reason and to other people they were
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:42.920]  just going down the line doing it and I've seen motorcycle gangs I don't know how many times
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:49.720]  three four times the last few years and a lot of people I talked to are telling me about these
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:56.600]  are family men uh I mean if you want to be in a gang go fight with other gangs don't fight with
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:02.680]  a dad with a life with three kids I mean you have any idea how how hurts you're going to get
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.120]  but I digress

[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.080]  steve quail is with us for the next hour and 52 minutes we're going to open phones up for part of
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:37.720]  the third hour today steve quail is a best-selling author a syndicated radio talk show host
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:45.080]  and of course one of the modern founders of the prepping movement he's been doing what he does for
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:58.680]  about 25 years i first interviewed steve quail in 1996 19 years ago and steve quail was on my show
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:06.280]  about six years ago and he said they're going to send the census group out to mark the gps of
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:11.080]  everyone's doorstep and they had mainstream news news articles saying he was crazy it happened a year
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:18.280]  later he said they're marking your doors for the military for gun confiscation and will even use
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:24.440]  predator drones with hellfires if you resist two years later that was in mainstream news
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:33.000]  so he says a lot of stuff that really sounds wild at the time but it's coming from his sources
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  and he does have some really good sources he also hosts national tv shows on some of the ancient
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  wonders things like that he's a very interesting fellow we should have him on sometime just about
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.400]  that i i saw part of the national tv show he's doing it just looked like something you know better
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:59.880]  than hbo when he was down in central and south america recently but we see the situation in
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:05.160]  cleveland ohio they're set to dare tomorrow to have the verdict on another police shooting
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:13.560]  jacari jackson and joe begs just got on the ground there this morning cleveland ohio burlo verdict
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:21.560]  protesters block lakeside avenue already that's out of wk yc and again there are some police
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:30.840]  brutality problems there is some thug culture problems everywhere there's a federalization problem but
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:36.760]  al sharpton has met over a hundred times at the white house al sharpton says it's about federalizing
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:41.800]  police we saw what the feds did it wake up that's not going to stop problems with the police
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.400]  they're the ones that have changed the police culture they're the ones that have given them
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:52.680]  the m wraps and it continues to be democrat run cities like baltimore where this stuff is
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:11:01.240]  happening or cleveland for that matter is pretty much democrat not as much so as is baltimore but
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:11.400]  close they want to take the social angst that's here and create a arab style spring as al gore has
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:20.840]  said a black spring black sun employment has doubled in the last seven years with a black president
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:27.560]  in black run cities it's globalism doing this not whitey but the system wants to get trouble
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:32.680]  where for going ahead of destabilization matt drudge has tweeted that it could bring the country down
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.000]  sociologists anthropologists have come out the economists have said it could bring the country
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.920]  down could it be used as a smokescreen for the economic collapse that they now admit is accelerating
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:48.200]  they've been papering over it with money printing or is it a war with russia they're getting ready
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:52.280]  for is it economic collapse they're getting ready for is it race where they're getting ready for
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.440]  or as congressman louis gomeron has now come out the news article i'm going to quote here in a moment
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:02.760]  after scheeve has some time to talk he's saying now from texas he believes jade helm is a way to try
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:08.520]  to quote provoke a fight with citizens and he's worried somebody might take a pot shot basically
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:14.760]  that's what i've been saying for a month this i believe overall is a drill but within the larger
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:19.000]  drills we know they're practicing for domestic takeover that's in the army's own documents
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:27.240]  but they've used drills before to bootleg false flags run by outside groups we know isis is in all
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:36.040]  48 lower states in in conus the contiguous lower 48 i get attacked people saying what do you mean
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:42.840]  you say the terror is all staged no al qaeda was pretty much staged and and funded this isis group
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:46.680]  is real groups that have been funded and organized and protected but they're real
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:54.040]  you notice the second amendment took them out so there's a lot of lines coming together a perfect
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:58.600]  storm a confluence right now and i wanted to get steve quail
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.680]  one of the first people to be out there warning about this 25 years ago
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:13.400]  the first guy i heard talking about kim trails the first guy i heard talking about so many issues
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:19.480]  that are now mainstream news he wants to talk about weather weapons today in fact we can you can
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:25.400]  just search do buy controls the weather russia controls the weather uh atlantic associated
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:29.480]  press admitting they're manipulating the weather but then we say hey we've had meteorologists on
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:33.880]  looks like they're blocking rain from the pacific they say shut up nut obama didn't create the
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.360]  tornado in oklahoma city which never said a caller called in and said could this have been
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:45.320]  manufactured i said they do have these technologies but generally no we've always had tornadoes in
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:51.400]  oklahoma they then tried to discredit the whole thing saying i said he made that tornado three
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:57.560]  years ago that hit the hit oklahoma city and killed so many the f5 or whatever it was just
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.360]  like we said we should watch jade helm because it's all part of a conditioning process they now
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:07.320]  say i said it's an imminent takeover to again discredit us when it doesn't happen the problem is
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:12.680]  we did to say that and louis gohmert and the governor and others have said they list patriots
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.040]  as the number one terror threat they admit they want the military trying to take them on
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:21.320]  so we need to have a national debate on this subject now i'm going to give steve quill the floor
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:26.280]  the next six minutes so we got a break to break down from his intel where all this is going and
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:31.880]  then what he thinks is it a confluence of all of it or are they getting ready for one thing
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:36.920]  or is this all just a ratcheting up in the conditioning steve quill of steve quill com
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:42.440]  thanks for coming on uh good morning alex well i think it's all of the above and it's being staged
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:50.040]  it's being uh staged concurrently and consecutively and uh let's just talk about the biggest issue
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:56.920]  when it comes to jade helm outside of very few uh oh news services and others showing the photos of
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:03.400]  un up armored humvees and un hospital trucks and everything i think the big point is is that the
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:09.240]  military lost their effective ability to even appear to tell the truth when no one addressed
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:14.280]  publicly i don't believe and i could be wrong but did anybody in bass strip texas ask why the
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:20.680]  presence of up armored un vehicles i don't think so why that's critical is because of you've talked
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:26.120]  about it i've talked about it everybody is now aware or should be aware of global disarmament
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:32.840]  this is the plan to turn the police against the people turn the people against the police
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.560]  i said that it down was 20 some years ago on coast to coast and i whoever they
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:42.040]  host was at that time it i think it was originally our belly well i know was our belt but then it
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:47.880]  switched to jordan or a i repeated it and everyone said i hope not it's my contention that this wake
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:55.400]  go uh and biker gang thing it looked too contrived bottom line is i'm not saying that it didn't happen
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:03.240]  but it just doesn't link up and and sync up so as we're seeing right now again texas texas texas
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:09.880]  good night pretty soon people begin to figure out that texas is in the sights of the current
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:15.240]  administration and i think that uh you know again your governor's right to put everyone on notice
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:21.480]  but let's get into the weather control because it's affected texas alec he who controls the weather
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:30.200]  controls the food he who controls food controls life and that's the great disassociative uh
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:37.320]  uh a blank or a blind spot in most people's thinking uh if anybody i i just put up two
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:44.440]  articles for you because lasers can control uh the weapon uh the the 2025 weather documents which
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.840]  by the way when i wrote you remember those because you have me on your show when i wrote the book
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:54.360]  weather wars the natural disasters that was originally published 15 years ago i think i've
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:58.840]  reprinted it two or three times i've gone through the whole development of weather warfare
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:07.160]  but in the meantime when people send you alex or me uh pictures of two uh but just perfectly
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:12.760]  straight lines in the sky and then chemical trails are usually black lines those are what
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:17.400]  are called tunneling lasers and i just put up on my website i don't know if you've got a chance to
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:23.160]  see it yet i just minutes ago but the gentleman who says we can control the weather with lasers
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:29.560]  there are hundreds of patents starting out with four six eight six six zero five bernard eastland
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:35.080]  harp but it goes way beyond that the satellite patents use of artificial satellites and earth
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:41.880]  orbits to modify the effective solar radiation that's five seven six two two nine eight so
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:47.480]  without boring everybody on all the numbers i posted those on my website but i want to quote
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:54.440]  clay born pal he said he basically now that we can control the weather this is 1995 create
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:59.880]  earthquakes and tidal waves and use it as a weapon of war we need to do a treaty russian
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:05.000]  united states now listen to this have worked together hand in hand for 20 years and developing
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.800]  weather control the russians were at laurence livermore laboratories cooperatively working
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:15.800]  and received an award uh some of their work for some of their work on weather control so the point
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:22.520]  being is is that look at what you do basically in the uh we own the the weather weather as a forest
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:28.040]  multiplier 2025 by the air force by the way i've reprinted that entire document they can go on the
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:33.400]  the uh you know just an internet search port but the point is to set how about zignu bruisinski
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:39.240]  national security advisor he said this in 1992 technology will make available to the leaders
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:44.680]  of a major of the major nations techniques for conducting secret warfare of which only a bare
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:49.480]  minimum of security forces need to be appraised techniques of weather modification could be
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:54.840]  employed to produce prolonged periods of droughts or storm and what about secretary of defense

[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:37.880]  the president's saying he'll use executive action to raise taxes he's already done it on
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:46.600]  borders defense energy the second amendment you name it so we're seeing a massive acceleration
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:53.000]  in tyranny more tyranny is unfolding in a month or two than what happened in a year before
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.320]  in fact that's an understatement steve wells our guest this is short segment long segment coming
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:03.720]  up steve that's what's so frustrating is that i've had over the years i think i'm gonna get
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:14.440]  them back on four or five west coast meteorologists and they would i mean i would get them on because
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:18.600]  i would see newscast on youtube of them going now the army's doing something out here with the
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:24.040]  air force we know they're doing some drills and it appears their chaff is blocking the rain because
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:28.920]  these water systems would come right in you can find these on youtube but something's blocking
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:33.640]  them i don't know what quite what's happening then their listeners educate them they go look at the
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:39.320]  patents for aluminum dioxide barium salts the rest of it where they can disperse the nuclei or
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:44.840]  cause it to rain uh this was a weather weapons used of course on the ho Chi Minh trail in vietnam
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:50.360]  that's on the weather channel discovery channel history channel all have shows i've had the guys
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:56.440]  like like ben livingston who was on before he went on history channel and fox i mean they
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:01.800]  was declassified i saw the declassified documents i called him up i got him in studio he was 90 years
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:08.360]  old then he got threatened not to come back on but they treat us like children steve because
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:14.840]  all this stuff's going on and i want to get into what's happening in california but when we come back
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:21.880]  i want to get into all these massive preparations the confluence the race war preparations the war
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.760]  on police that you talked about 15 years ago 20 years ago and we're not defending bad police
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:32.440]  behavior folks we're talking about the tactic the gambit of divide and conquer the george soros'
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:37.240]  funding uh it seems like they're making their moves so i want to know what's coming up in your expert
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:41.960]  view is this the big one or is it just more preparation but first finish up in the four or
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:50.680]  five minutes we have uh steve uh on the situation uh with the weather control well more and more
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:56.600]  people alex across the country are now starting to get the uh idea on chemtrails and it you know
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:03.160]  there's so many patents on combining iodates and and barium i mean a system and method for the
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:08.360]  irradiation of the planet's surface areas uh you know results of patents i mean there are
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.000]  literally hundreds of method of increasing the likelihood of precipitation by the artificial
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:20.120]  introduction of seawater here is the point we are at war we are seeing jade helm uh there's you
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:25.160]  know there's all there's so many documents each one but number one you know our military test
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:33.400]  test test but beyond that there's a i believe a very evil plan to basically and primarily the
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:39.400]  reason texas you know obviously the oil and gas industry in texas but primarily because of your
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:46.040]  border but more importantly because of your economy remember this i came up with a quote i've used it
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:52.200]  on uh info wars your show so many times alex john show the bottom line is rape pillage and plunder
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:58.040]  they are taking the united states under every time people hear the word derivative they should
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:03.400]  say this to themselves that's just a fancy word for someone's pick my pocket but in the weather
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:08.680]  modification world and i get i get so much black and i gotta tell you ladies and gentlemen but the
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:13.960]  amount of plaque that the mainstream uh goes against alex with or me or the others calling us
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:20.920]  everything they can crazies doomsday uh porn whatever they say you've got to understand and alex this
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:28.360]  is important their neuro linguistic programming nlp tell a lie tell a big enough lie repeat the lie
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:35.320]  and pretty soon people will go into a cognizant dissonance to disassociate the truth because the
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:42.440]  truth has already been dismissed and repetitiously uh made fun of ridicule scorn well that's what the
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.400]  that's what the attorney general said to the national association of broadcasters he said repeat repeat
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:54.040]  repeat the anti-gun messages never stop and literally brainwash the public absolutely only they
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:29:00.840]  never brainwash us they just basically dump their celestial pile of sewage into our cerebral cortex
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:05.480]  and call it the truth i think everyone listening to you everyone listening to me has listened to
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:10.440]  you or will listen to either one of us in the future needs to start boycotting you know and i
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:16.760]  mean that effectively boycotting be sure maybe a thousand letters to fox won't get any notice maybe
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:24.200]  two thousand maybe ten thousand won't but those those idiots that continue to put down empirical
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:28.600]  evidence are wrong let me just give you a good example okay yeah and and i want to share this
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:32.680]  because stay there you're gonna have the floor when we come back steve quill 18 man segment
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:39.480]  coming up steve quill dot com i want to get into again the big picture what's happening why are
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:45.240]  there two hundred three hundred articles a day lying about you know me i mean what are we saying
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:54.840]  that scares them so much we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:04.840]  network it's being called the largest gunfight in waco city history on sunday a biker braw left
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:09.400]  nine dead and more than 160 arrested members from five different motorcycle gangs have been
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:14.040]  charged with engaging in organized crime the brawl started in the bathroom of the twin peaks
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:19.560]  restaurant just off i-35 and waco witnesses said it quickly escalated into the bar and then out
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:24.200]  into the parking lot and that's where shots began to be fired interestingly police were on the scene
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:29.080]  in seconds why well they had the restaurant under surveillance in fact new york daily news reports
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:33.640]  that several law enforcement agencies including uniform waco police officers were already outside
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:37.640]  the restaurant as hundreds of gang members converged despite their presence the shootout
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:41.880]  ignited with officers returning fire amid the pandemonium sergeant patrick swanton informed the
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:46.040]  press that off-duty cops were also on the scene and jumped into help during the fight
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:50.120]  aside from the whole story sounding fishy this proves that we need our second amendment more
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:54.120]  than ever because even a preemptive massive police presence failed to stop guns from being
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:31:04.760]  drawn and fired rob dew reporting for info wars dot com and it's that type of behavior that spurred
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:10.680]  me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:16.520]  help children focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music fast food
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:21.960]  gmo's sugars you name it young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:27.720]  hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:32.760]  are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:36.920]  with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take we worked with the

[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:34.120]  if you're a new listener we're going back to Steve quill in just a moment
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:38.680]  you need to understand something i'm in way over my head
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:47.000]  but we all are i don't claim to have all the answers but there are literally as he was just
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:54.200]  saying thousands of patents about how to put barium salts limited to oxide and then radioactive
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:34:01.800]  isotopes into jet fuel so that it's then aerosolized and sprayed out by the plane
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.120]  to modify the weather and then they gave the guy that came up with it you can look this up
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:19.160]  the name escapes me in 1992 a Nobel Prize for science and then like the next year the chem
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:26.360]  trailing starts and they've got planes that do it special they've got it added to the jet fuel
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:34.120]  the pilots don't even know nasa said 15 years ago the earth was 21 percent darker now it's 30 plus
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:42.840]  percent darker and they show satellite photos showing the jet trail lines darkening the sky
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:49.800]  and then a few years ago we we saw a national fifth grade science book admitting plane spray
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:57.800]  chemicals to help give the earth sunscreen to stop global warming but then you find out the sun's
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:04.440]  rays the uv goes through it bounces back up and can't get out or the heat it creates on the ground
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:10.600]  can't get out it's actually heating the planet some think that there was an ice age coming with
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:14.680]  the Bilderberg group actually talked about secretly in the 50s and so they've been doing this to try
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:22.040]  to stop an ice age the truth is it's all secret so we don't know we just know it's going on and
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:26.440]  i didn't mean to digress i want to go back to our guests and get into jade helm and other big issues
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:32.440]  he's working on and open the phones up in the next hour stevequell.com's his site before i go
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:41.320]  any further we fund our operation with high quality products i have 50 crew members right at 50 it's
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:45.720]  very expensive takes tens of millions of dollars a year to run this we were in new york it would

[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.160]  and women we call to get on as guests and they say sure i'll come on and then they're on the show
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:20.360]  and they go yeah i'm a listener then they describe shows we've done other ones we call they go we're
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.120]  listeners but we're going to be under the radar more of us know what's going on up here than you
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:31.480]  think and i have like senior retired secret service agents on they say the same thing banjino
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:36.040]  is set on air you wouldn't believe how many secret service listen and how many new york cops listen
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:42.360]  so stop bashing them um you know that's just a few thugs they protect to make us all look bad
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:50.040]  and then i'm going to do more investigation find out just how many people in the system itself
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:56.200]  are awake so the globalists want to maneuver us somehow into a civil war they want to get
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:00.280]  things destabilized with race riots then they want to launch some false flags to blame to blame
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:05.720]  the patriots or or have somebody attack the military during jade helm or attack them and
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:10.200]  say we did it there's a lot of different scenarios but we know they're going to pull one of them in
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:17.080]  my gut now steve quail we're 12 minutes out from break you've got the floor uh get into jade helm
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:22.760]  the big picture why do you think there's this confluence of all these factors what's your intel
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:28.920]  what's your gut tell you what's coming up steve quail well actually it is truly that time that
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:35.960]  they have chosen the illuminous the globalists and the uh globally eluciferian agenda here's the deal
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:41.080]  they want a global war they need a global war in order to basically get rid of the old the new
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:46.120]  world or ladies and gentlemen basically is a just a buzzword for take everything it was based on god
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:51.800]  based on the constitution based on freedom and bringing in the greatest utopian utopian you
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:58.600]  uh totalitarian control mechanism the world has ever seen under the rule and reign of satan
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:03.480]  that's is that and and they can call me whatever they want to call me and let me share this too
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:09.880]  alex your products are critical for people to integrate into their bug out bag as as i would
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:15.720]  talk about weather war and the war that's on food come on we've got 20 30 million birds uh
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:21.800]  chickens and turkeys the egg uh production iowa's cutback was actually 40 million now that have done
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:27.880]  okay i stand corrected it seems like what's the day but another 10 million uh the point being we've
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:35.560]  got southern california the garden of the united states being systematically uh warred against
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:42.200]  by weather warfare now why would anybody do that simple you cut the food you kill the people you
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:47.800]  and i caught a lot of crap together for deagle let's call it what it is reporting on that yet
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:55.400]  even in their quote disclaimer they still can't explain why there's going to be the greatest
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:59.880]  immigration you notice that was one of their excuses that's going to come to pass and i don't
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:04.200]  believe there's anything sinister about them i believe there'd be absolutely truthful all you'd
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:09.320]  have to do is listen to one of your old videos my radio shows and quote all the people on population
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:16.120]  control but the point is we're going to lose 80 percent of our population so jade helm listen the
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:21.080]  military test test test and not everyone the military is evil not everyone in law enforcement
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:26.200]  is evil the point being it's that the evil has a louder voice so i want to share something
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:32.840]  ladies and gentlemen you must do what you can do i'm not on social media i'm you know philosophically
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:37.880]  opposed to it marcus wolf premacoff those guys you and i were the first two guys and thank you for
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:44.200]  having me on your show what 15 years ago whenever we talked about that that's set up you know the
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:51.080]  intelligence gathering operations so use their weapons against us when you see alice getting
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:56.920]  taken on when you see me getting taken on whoever's telling the truth getting taken on you get all
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:04.120]  your social media crew you gear them up and you bombard fox you bombard cnn you just absolutely
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:08.520]  saturated and you shove it down their throat you're right that's what they don't like is that we
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:13.640]  continue at the boston bombing and other events that are fishy or these places where the
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:18.920]  justice department's trying to start riots whatever the case is my reporters are in there
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:24.600]  getting the intel and they don't like the fact that we're able to challenge their official narratives
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:31.400]  alice you put people into the field they put them in front of a grain screen i e cnn you're not out
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:37.000]  there ladies and gentlemen if you watch it listen we can quote sources until we're blue in the face
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.920]  we can we can refer to documents we do all that but at this point you've got to open your eyes and
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:49.720]  open your ears how do you know when someone's over target when they get the flag in in in America
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:54.760]  there is no longer truth the prophet Jeremiah said roll unto them who call evil good and good evil
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:43:00.440]  alice you've used the word evil probably you know in describing these people they are evil
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:06.040]  and the evil is abscess of all good it's the way you described him you would come on the air 19
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:10.200]  years ago when i first discovered you when i was reading your books and listening to you on short
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:16.760]  wave you call my local fm show and you would describe a total inversion of reality an overthrow
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:21.720]  of all that's good the destruction of the family uh they're planned to overthrow every institution
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:26.120]  and i'd say steve come on they just want to take over the institutions and be in charge
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:32.360]  no they want to destroy everything they want to listen and this is something that out of the
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:38.680]  phoenix okay the phoenix is a bird that catches fire self emulates and then a new bird the new
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:44.600]  you know 256 times george bush senior whatever use the term the new world order the new world
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:51.160]  order is nothing more than satan's total attack a war against the god of heaven and the people of
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:57.960]  god you when you broke the myac report when when we were talking about that i came on as a guest
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:03.800]  we talked about all the official rules people didn't believe it was real for a full week and
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:09.160]  ron paul called me and said i know you don't lie alex but is that really real and of course it was
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:17.880]  real it was real and see we continue uh continue the the i guess you'd say that can well we we
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:23.480]  carry on to present truth truth truth but you've got to understand ladies and gentlemen it's time
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:28.760]  the more our personal will take up the cause of truth alex the more they will get involved in the
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:34.600]  info wars whether social media the next time anybody takes on alex or takes on me or takes on
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:39.720]  anybody you need to flood their boxes and say you're wrong if they say there is no such thing as
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:45.000]  weather war quote the patents go look on i put it up and by the way alex the last time i was on your
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.880]  show uh breathe no evil we did a quick brief on that a weather wars i just went on amazon to look
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:57.400]  it's funny your some of your videos and stuff and and things that we originally sell at one price
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:01.720]  people are trying around selling to people that aren't really aware at a higher price for instance
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:07.320]  weather wars and unnatural disasters i saw it for 30 bucks i've only got 300 of them left the last
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:12.920]  time i said that on your show they were all gone in a matter of days but the bottom line is i at
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:18.360]  60 90 dollars people are selling them so ladies and gentlemen you know when we make it shows people
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:24.280]  are valuing the truth now more than ever so let me ask this question steve well how is the power
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:30.680]  structure going to strike back at you myself and others past just the demonization phase i mean the
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:36.120]  demonization we're receiving is conservatively 10 times what it's ever been an intensity and it's
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:43.240]  it's it's sustained uh it is it is over the top and it's because they know the establishment
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:49.240]  that isn't evil part of the establishment is listening and it's giving them basically aid
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:54.600]  and comfort to realize we can defeat the globalist we can come together i don't think they like the
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:59.560]  fact that that that that we're letting folks understand that the globalists are not invincible
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:05.080]  well no but the way they'll do it is so cut obviously we're seeing the internet protocols
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:10.840]  there is no legislation turning the internet over yeah really you want to have uh some foreign
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:16.360]  intelligence service running what alex jones or steve quail or whoever can talk about you know
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:21.800]  the bottom line is alex that's how they're going to do it they can cut the phone lines i went through
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:30.360]  four brand new mac computers last year that they fried okay fried as an fr ied i have good isp
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:35.160]  is i have good you know firewalls and all that stuff but you know there comes a point when
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:41.720]  when you're telling the truth the fact now here's how it has to happen like i said earlier and i
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:49.560]  sent nico an email saying we have got to get the people to understand that they won't allow allow
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:55.640]  excuse me they won't allow the lies to stand if they're saying something that's just patently
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:47:01.720]  untrue look at this the media and ladies and gentlemen the reason the media doesn't do any
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:07.480]  reporting any longer they just agendatize maybe that's not the correct word but anyway i'm using
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:11.400]  it that way they just repeat whatever the globalists tell them they are literal repeaters they are
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:16.520]  now regurgitators yeah and can i tell you something that's why i say anybody who listens to mainstream
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:24.520]  media it's like taken a disgusting bath in warm vomit now nobody likes to smell a warm vomit nobody
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:29.880]  even likes you know you say that word but that's what people are exposed to when they're listening
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:36.440]  to mainstream media because they don't want you to think i agree watching msnbc and and and that guy
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:43.960]  madow is like bathing in monkey vomit monkey vomit we won one step better than i did you know
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:51.160]  and because we want to you know it's like basically high diving into a cesspool swimming pool
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:56.680]  expecting to come out of the water and uh not uh understanding the reaction of it's like high
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:01.240]  diving into a swimming pool that hillary clinton's been using for a toilet for a hundred years
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:08.360]  there you go the point being ladies and gentlemen is that you've got to start becoming proactive
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:12.600]  so many times you know one one one group of individuals used to say you know why we listen
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:17.400]  to you steve we think you're crazy but it's good entertainment i said no the reason why you listen
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:24.360]  to me beyond the mocking is because the truth will always condemn your denial i came up with the
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:30.440]  term dumb unto death and i think that people got to understand that they're counting on that i can't
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:35.800]  stop what's going to happen alex you can't stop it but we can save as many lives and we get as many
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:41.400]  people out of harm's way as possible let me say this then out of all the confluences all the
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:46.280]  things coming together right now the acceleration is this just part of the continuum of acceleration
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:51.560]  or is it building towards something big i mean what do you really think jade helm is okay jade
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:59.400]  helm is the uh placement of minimum material throughout the country for an initiating event
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:03.880]  that i still believe is going to be two-fold on the left hand you're going to have a mega quake
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:10.360]  and again phil schneider before he was murdered 1995 96 uh i talked to him alex one week before
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:14.840]  and he was talking to the reason he was murdered by the way was because he was blowing the whistle
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:19.480]  on the all the black budget technology but i believe that on the left hand you're going to
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:22.680]  have an earthquake you're going to have a west coast quake and you're going to have a major
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:28.840]  mid west quake on the new madrid i think on the right hand you're already seeing it the voluminous
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:37.160]  amounts of of uh economic uh disasters that are are brewing king world news eric interviews people
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:41.880]  all over the place you interview paul craig roberts we interview the best of the best
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:47.160]  well when you bring on half a dozen or a dozen billionaires with a b and they're saying the
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:52.600]  same thing and they didn't get their billions by being stupid yet the average guy doesn't
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:59.720]  understand when he goes to the grocery store that turkey's gone up from a buck 39 to a dollar 99 or
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:08.360]  worse uh ground round or ground beef 399 599 or or you go to buy a potato chips and the bottom
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:13.960]  line in that is that i'm saying the bottom line because i overuse that on purpose alex it's to
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:18.120]  show people it doesn't matter what's up on top what are they giving you at the end of the day
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:24.760]  they're giving you less food for more money and telling you the economy is great yeah and that's
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:29.880]  a lie and and if it's so great why do we have close to 100 million people unemployed why do we
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:35.880]  have 49 million and plus or minus a couple hundred thousand people on food stamps what is going to
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:40.600]  happen it's a time bomb it's a time bomb it is a time bomb and so the civil war you asked me
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:44.680]  what's going to happen stay there i want to get into that because the justice department admits
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:49.880]  they're stirring up race war they admit it's about federalizing police the summer hadn't even got here
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:54.680]  yet and you've got you know riots every couple of weeks they're about to kick off again in cleveland

[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:35.080]  the end of everything that stands the end i know this the rocker fellers in the un you can just
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:46.760]  google it's mainstream news have built 14 seed banks gene banks plant and animal banks arcs
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:54.360]  in rural remote areas like near the north pole and other areas four catastrophic collapse
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:59.320]  with all the different technological developments that are happening with nano tech gmo the rest
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:02.680]  of it's only a matter of time until something gets out of hand
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:11.640]  and when you just see the evil makeup of all this and how the end game is always not prosperity
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:18.680]  but just hell on earth and you could see decades of preparation by the controllers leading towards
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:24.760]  this point and the boldness of the white house running false flags giving weapons to al qaeda
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:31.160]  and isis and shipping guns into mexico and persecuting christians with the irs and nobody gets in
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:37.960]  trouble george sorrell spent 33 million dollars just in ferguson trying to get stuff going with
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:43.400]  just department got caught doing it as well now they're out in the open stirring it up taking
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:50.600]  tragedies and blowing them out of proportions and then these are tragedies but the globalist
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:57.640]  are the big bad guys and they have an end game so civil war steve quail steve quail dot com
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:02.920]  what is the game plan why is the justice department doing this well al sharpens said to
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:08.600]  federalized police but what do you expect to see this summer if stuff is already so out of control
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:15.160]  well i mean i expect to see isis because i believe that terrorism is nothing more than
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:21.960]  someone's foreign policy initiating the plan and again alex when we did the myac report people would
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:27.800]  not believe the fact that christians would ever be considered terrorists the fbi knows a 50 plus
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:34.440]  and listen there's probably 500 plus actually uh radical islamic training camps not one arrest
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:41.960]  not one disarmament and you've got to ask yourself the question why do people knowingly turn a blind
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:47.000]  eye to that well it's because you have the agenda and the agenda i'm afraid it's already been declared
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:54.840]  when the uh entity basically made the statement uh america is no longer christian nation you know
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:57:00.120]  and that's critical because well the entity also said that if we build a business we didn't build it
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:06.120]  i mean they are trying to invert reality sorry go ahead yeah no no no they are inverting reality
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:11.640]  and that's why i came up with a statement this morning you know just it is the virtual reality
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:19.800]  is total mental enslavement and reality avoidance okay virtual reality is total mental enslavement
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:25.320]  and reality avoidance i actually i'm going to come up with my own book of uh uh terms and one
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:30.760]  of the terms is going to be reality avoidance syndrome you know what alex your trouble point
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:37.240]  blank is you've got the ear of multi millions and millions of people telling the truth the people
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:45.320]  who are starting to come awake are seeing that the lies are no longer selling the agenda therefore
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:50.840]  they've got to get rid of all recipients very grateful we talked about him bottom line is when
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:57.000]  you've got the people that influence the entity talking about the fact that back in 72 that 30
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.880]  million people had to die take the population version it brings it up to 100 million the thing
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:07.960]  that bothers me the most is the disconnect i don't care what military spokesman says when he has to
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:13.560]  look to his civilian handler over the right and basically said what do i say now and he's not
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:18.120]  even familiar with the jay tell him documents that he's basically telling everybody not to worry
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:25.800]  i absolutely salute with my whole heart i have so much uh respect and admiration for the people
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:31.480]  about strip that didn't let it slide absolutely and it's the military that lets us know about all
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:36.200]  this i mean it's people on the inside that give us all the documents that also makes the system

[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:52.280]  specifically focus in and pick his brain on where he sees the world going representative louis
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:58.040]  gomert suggests feds using jade helm to provoke a fight with citizens congressman calls labeling
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:04.920]  of texas and utah's hostile states suspicious he said that last week in a new article in a local
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:11.640]  newspaper uh that we uh linked to here in the story in texas he says that it appears to be
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:17.480]  an attempt to provoke a fight and to get a confrontation going and i agree what how do you
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:23.400]  think we ought to handle jade helm and all the other exercises going on right now where we get
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:28.680]  the video and they're practicing going after patriots conservatives libertarians veterans
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:35.080]  what do we do when the military is given a mission that's so unconstitutional we know the
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:39.160]  individual soldiers don't like what's happening so they're not the problem in fact they're more
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:45.240]  away from the public on average but still what do we do uh go out and educate them in public uh
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:53.480]  expose it shoot video tell our cities not to do this uh what do we do in your view steve well
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:59.080]  we're doing all that alex so we're doing all we can do um you know four years ago and i want to
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:04.680]  make this clear you know i put up on my website and and read it multiple times on the air i believe
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:10.760]  it was a true word from the lord that god said i am against you pentagon and your plans to make
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:16.040]  war against my people we're seeing right now a two-star general they're asking him to be court
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:22.040]  marshal because he gave jesus a glory at a commencement speech or something i think the
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:27.160]  people have got to understand it's a spiritual battle you touch you touch on it and i touch on
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:34.440]  it but there are a lot of people who who cannot equate their faith in essence who go to church
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:41.800]  on sunday and can understand that they've now been vilified so alex the truth is the only thing
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:47.960]  i know that can confront this i would say this that the provocations will become more and more
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:54.920]  pronounced okay and so again the idea is is that information information so they're trying to push
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:03:00.520]  us into conflict absolutely absolutely you said it earlier and i want to make it clear too that
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:06.760]  these individuals want a civil war they're going to push it if you notice something interesting
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:11.320]  about the last riot the krypton the bloods came together along with the nation of islam
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:18.600]  and they were they were peaceful but again what when i say relatively peaceful but when you you
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:23.080]  don't know who's on the police force this is what i you know i think it should be know your cop
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:28.840]  i have some are some you know amazing uh people just like you do that are in law enforcement
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:34.280]  that send you an absolute state of the art information but i've warned them all and this
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:38.360]  is what i'll warn everybody who's in law enforcement that listens to your show today this
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:44.920]  is critical alex life and death beware of observers assigned to your vehicle beware of observers
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:50.200]  signed to your department beware of just recent guys that you know for a fact haven't been out of
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:56.280]  the military so long that are coming in and and and notice their demeanor you know street smarts
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:04:03.960]  are what uh saves the cops lives street smarts now can be uh uh identified if you will to the
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:08.760]  inform absolutely because when they drop the hammer there they've got everybody actuaryed and
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:13.480]  profiled uh they're going to have a night of the long knives where they go after a lot of the people
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:20.440]  in the government absolutely and here's the deal if you're not a politically correct cop
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:25.480]  then you've already been targeted for elimination when when the man who it cost him his life let
[02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:29.800]  me one more time run this down alex real quick the road we come back you're gonna have the floor
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:35.320]  when we come back because i know the story it's powerful and it's just crazy the deal yeah we've
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:39.240]  got to educate them that's what we're doing but we also need the people out there that have listened
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:43.400]  to you listen to me for all they're gonna have to get aggressive exactly it's time for everybody to
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:48.680]  be a leader everybody to be heard and seen they can't get us all the maximum pushes right now
[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:53.480]  the globalists are not invincible we're gonna come back don't talk about your friend and more and
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:57.800]  take phone calls and hit a bunch for their news the economy the election it's all coming up
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:05.080]  it's being called the largest gunfight in waco city history on sunday a biker braw left nine
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:09.800]  dead and more than 160 arrested members from five different motorcycle gangs have been charged with
[02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:14.840]  engaging in organized crime the brawl started in the bathroom of the twin peaks restaurant just
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:20.360]  off i-35 in waco witnesses said it quickly escalated into the bar and then out into the parking lot
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:25.560]  and that's where shots began to be fired interestingly police were on the scene in seconds why well
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:29.720]  they had the restaurant under surveillance in fact new york daily news reports that several law
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:34.360]  enforcement agencies including uniform waco police officers were already outside the restaurant as
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:38.520]  hundreds of gang members converged despite their presence the shootout ignited with officers
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:42.920]  returning fire amid the pandemonium sergeant patrick swanton informed the press that off-duty cops
[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:47.480]  were also on the scene and jumped into help during the fight aside from the whole story sounding
[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:52.200]  fishy this proves that we need our second amendment more than ever because even a preemptive massive
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:57.320]  police presence failed to stop guns from being drawn and fired rob do reporting for info wars.com

[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:35.720]  my cards on the table welcome i like to shoot clay pigeons there's no time i like to play golf
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:46.600]  i like to fish i like to hunt i like to hike i like to go see movies with my friends i like to
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:57.880]  go play pool and drink beer i like to have a good time i'm not looking for trouble i don't have some
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:07.240]  death wish or power wish i have looked at the documentation for 25 years 23 24 years been on
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:15.080]  air 20 and i saw it for totalitarianism that it was the globalist bragging about a corporate world
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:19.880]  government but if we were just going under a corporate world government and it would just
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:24.600]  be new owners and they wanted to keep taxes low because that actually creates more revenue and
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:30.680]  they wanted to skim off the top i would be a talk show host against it and i'd try to reform it but
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:39.080]  i wouldn't be every day getting myself right with jesus every day just just not even able to believe
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:45.320]  what's happening because i can't go shoot clay pigeons or go play golf or go fishing
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:50.680]  because i'm physically sick the whole time because i know
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:54.360]  that the globalists are doing what they're doing
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.480]  and i just can't avoid reality like steve quill was talking about that's our problem
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:09.080]  and i get people that just want to go to a baseball game or a football game
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:17.320]  or want to go bowling i mean if we weren't in such dark straits i'd be picking my kids up
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:21.160]  two or three nights a week we wouldn't be going home and doing homework we'd be going to bowling
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:32.200]  alley like when i was a kid we'd be going camping we'd be playing tennis
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:40.200]  but instead i don't know when the big hammer is coming down but the economy is degenerating
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:46.600]  the government's running around like all hands on deck gearing up the all the manuals we get
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:51.240]  nothing about radical islam everything about veterans and gun owners and none of that is going
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:56.600]  to fly and in christians unless they're planning atrocities be blamed on us
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:05.400]  and man when algae zero was here with american reporters or when bbc is here or when abc is here
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:11.720]  they look at me like they hate me and like i had done something to their kids
[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:20.200]  i mean they have really conditioned the public on the enemy side to hate us
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:29.560]  and all we want is them to have freedom and prosperity and a future and americana prosperity i
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:36.520]  mean we're good people we're just mainline americans i instinctively and spiritually cannot
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:42.680]  bow down and be a slave i instinctively cannot just give in to all this and we've had a huge effect
[02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:48.680]  but i'll tell you it's it's it's it's it's frustrating and i'm glad to have done what
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:52.920]  i've done we're going back to steve quill in a moment i am proud of the fact i've been honorable
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:58.360]  i can't help it it's in my bones i also don't feel worthy at many levels because i'm not perfect
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:06.440]  and and and an incredible task of this magnitude i mean do you understand this radio show is the
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:13.160]  number one worldwide media event in the face of the global of steve quill has millions of
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:17.560]  viewers and listeners as well i know he's probably glad i may have a little bit more because it's so
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:24.760]  dangerous this isn't fun i mean i want people to understand this isn't fun okay i don't go out in
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:29.320]  public and get awards i don't want to be famous i didn't want to take our guns in texas like they
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:38.440]  were trying in 1994 and i learned about the un model system and all the rest of it i thought
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:42.120]  other people would care and want to do something you know what you have cared you have done something
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:46.920]  and i know you're getting active so i'm telling you we're we're approaching a key event and when
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:52.440]  i talk about myself here it's so you as a new listener or viewer can understand this isn't
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:13:00.600]  a game and it's the sincerity we have and the truth we have and the documentation we have
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:02.600]  i mean steve quill is so upsetting speaking
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:09.560]  that you can hear him just just almost unable to talk and i know that feeling
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:15.560]  so i've just got to go a hundred miles an hour to get past the emotion so i can just get it out
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:19.880]  because there's nothing more frustrating than spending years reading this stuff and reading the
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:25.000]  books hundreds of them written by them how they put fluoride in the water to dumb us down how they
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:30.040]  put chemicals in the vaccines to brain damage our kids to to know they're coming with forced
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:36.120]  inoculations it's here they're coming with everything they're coming they're already here
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:41.240]  and to see most the servants of these people
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:48.520]  aren't even bad they're compartmentalized they want to go bowling they want to go play golf
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:51.720]  they want to go shooting they want to go out with their girlfriend or fiance
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:57.320]  they want to go see a baseball game and so do i man and so they look at me and they say you must
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:04.280]  be lying because if that was true i'd have to do something well it is true and what's happening is
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:09.080]  we're rapidly approaching the point of no return where everybody has to admit that evil took over
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:13.160]  and it's about to get a lot worse so people are finally waking up and that's why the globalists
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:17.320]  are coming in with internet kill switches and censorship and the founding fathers wouldn't
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:21.720]  be welcome in the military blah blah blah because they're about to make things so bad
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:26.360]  they've got to normalize stuff and hide it in plain view the toll free number to ask questions of
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:43.000]  steve quail is 800-259-9231-800-2599-231 first time callers please 800-2599-231 i will skip this

[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:36.120]  going to try to stop them from the real killers the democratic party and their kkk command base
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:42.440]  literally just look it up uh biggest supporters of the plan parenthood is the kkk and they've
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:47.560]  got the moron liberals all out there supporting them god they're so stupid i don't think i'm
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:52.040]  so sick of arguing with idiots i just i just steve quill you've got the floor i'm skipping the
[02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:56.280]  break you were getting into your friend that was killed for exposing the red blue and green list
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:02.040]  now they admit all these lists under infra guard clergy response teams their humet teams their roll
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:07.240]  out i mean and all these snot noses that have now got security clearances and think they're cool and
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:11.640]  part of a winning team against us i mean it is they have no idea they're going to be betrayed
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:17.880]  in the next phase of this once the civil war kicks off um steve quill break down exactly what's
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:21.880]  what the globalists would like to pull off and why they're always trying to maneuver us towards this
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:27.800]  point the wisest man in the world had least detailed in history was solemn and he said if the
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:34.760]  foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do the thing is alex is that people have allowed
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:39.880]  their country to be taken away from them now saying all that the next step they're going to do is
[02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:46.680]  they remember this you can always look at two words they both start with c control and chaos okay
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:51.960]  out of the chaos comes their control and let me share this this has got to strike a chord we're
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:17:00.280]  talking about these guys want and again this has not sunk in uh they want to i'm sorry they want
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:06.360]  90 percent of the world's population dead and done away with whether by vaccines whether by
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:11.640]  whether warfare or control whether by this whether by that now i'm using in the a different form of
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:19.640]  weather but the point being is that that's the end game okay the total destruction of mankind
[02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:25.880]  creating the image and likeness of god and then an insert will come in an entity made in the power
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:30.840]  of darkness's likeness and listen i think it should have been blamed everyone when the entity
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:37.880]  made the statement um uh america is no longer a christian nation probably that's another time he
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:43.400]  told the truth second time is when he said america is the greatest country in the world we intend to
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:50.120]  change all that so when you when the press will let the highest officer in the land get away with
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:57.400]  lie after lie after lie after lie i believe alex that we're being set up for a and this is not a
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:02.840]  pet uh plan of mine it's what i've been told by all the people that i've ever contacted with or
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:10.680]  have contacted me more likely that russia and china have their plans set for this country
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:14.600]  we've talked about chinese below the border people didn't believe that talked about russians
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:19.480]  and canada people didn't believe that our own government brought the russians in to help take
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:24.440]  away the guns one of the guys who whose whose brother was married to a high-ranking russian
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:31.560]  official saw the letter it was signed by former um i think was janet apolitano we've seen the
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:38.280]  murder of innocence we see it every day and this is why i salute what you're doing again my goal
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:45.640]  is get the blacks and i'm saying that the latinos and uh the whites everybody to understand who's
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:52.360]  behind initiating trying to get us meaning us collectively all americans to fight factually
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:58.280]  and create civil war the fact that the united nations is in this country and i want to share
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:03.720]  this alex maybe your sources can validate this too but i've been told the secret treaty and
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:10.280]  agreement exists pretty much to give back azatlan to mexico that's why the desert southwest was
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:15.880]  chosen as jade helm now have you heard that from any of your sources it's incredible you said that
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:21.000]  i was told that by some military folks two weeks ago they said alex do you notice that's the azlan
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:26.760]  map everything we do is multifaceted of course it's the condition of the public of course
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:32.360]  it's so the public can take pot shots at us and you can be blamed but more importantly
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:38.360]  down the road they are looking at a civil war and actually breaking part of the country off
[02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:44.760]  during that and using that as the excuse to introduce the un peacekeepers absolutely now
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:49.960]  look who's on the security council alex you've got russian china is two of the most powerful
[02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:55.320]  members on the security council you've got basically john carrey running with his tail
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:20:03.320]  between his legs to moscow and and begging for a meeting with budin you've got the whole uh strange
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:09.800]  arrest of masonic police you've got the story of one of them going to the soviet embassy
[02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:16.040]  and this isn't just on god you know wacky stuff from europe this is the real event right now as
[02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:22.120]  you and i on the air uh i'm seeing uh rad con levels in hartford connecticut this is important
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:26.920]  to what we're talking about maryland u.s look they've already decided that they're going to
[02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:32.200]  sacrifice washington dc that's why they set up dember as a provisional capital of the united
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:37.640]  states of what's left of it but the fact that your sources told you that two weeks ago that i'm on
[02:20:37.640 --> 02:20:45.720]  your show today is the 18th of may years 2015 that's got to tell people that we meaning alex
[02:20:45.720 --> 02:20:50.360]  i don't know your sources you don't know my sources and i can guarantee you they're in different
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:56.520]  parts of the world and country but the fact is when when we have two or three uh high ranking
[02:20:56.520 --> 02:21:02.840]  military intelligence law enforcement all these people saying the same thing i take notice and
[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:08.440]  the thing and here's why let's go back i mean member general boykin i remember admiral more
[02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:13.720]  remember uh uh people like ben parton still alive he was the former head of air force weapons
[02:21:13.720 --> 02:21:19.080]  development they were always the ones blowing the whistle before that's what the globalist have
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:25.400]  as a problem is that there's so many patriots in the military and in law enforcement but now
[02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:31.000]  the purge is accelerating and they've got these younger generations that they're filling the ranks
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:35.480]  with uh and i'm not saying all the young ones are bad but i tell you they've got their cadres in
[02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:41.240]  charge now and you can just tell get into your red blue list because that's now come out in
[02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:47.400]  mainstream news that they've got these roundup plans as best i can tell them start the civil war
[02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:52.360]  uh use that to tear up the military police and the public then bring in foreign troops
[02:21:52.360 --> 02:21:56.760]  to stabilization force later folks will beg to have the power turned back on six months a year
[02:21:56.760 --> 02:22:03.720]  two years if they go with this hot plan but after the stabilization they're going to take out most
[02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:09.320]  the leadership uh the minions that help bring them to power they never want to keep that group
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:15.400]  in charge because they were part of the coup takeover absolutely it's like the old series
[02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:21.080]  with chris christoverson america spell with the k and encourage everybody go see that and it's
[02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:25.800]  interesting alex because in the scene in america and this is what i've been told this plan again
[02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:30.200]  the man that told me about the red list real quick the red list are people that are outspoken
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:35.160]  obviously gun owners and this is what i'm trying to get across empowered individuals is what the
[02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:41.160]  pentagon and jade helm calls us exactly but gun owners are on the top list so the red list
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:48.200]  the blue list are complicit military and uh and law enforcement that will go along with the initial
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:54.200]  roundup and takeouts and didn't bother you when you heard jade helm and the blue list by the way
[02:22:54.200 --> 02:23:01.080]  dies in 60 days after the red list is fully culminated i had a brother i'm going to have
[02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:05.400]  brother a brother in the lord who is a former vietnam vet god bless each and every one of
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:10.600]  your vietnam vets he's in the woods he speaks russian they're tracking a joint uh uh what are
[02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:15.880]  these uh maneuver or training exercise and he hears the russian speaking and he speaks fluent
[02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:21.800]  russian saying those stupid americans once we've done what we need to do with them that's when
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:26.600]  we do them and he said steve they were openly talking and laughing and snickering he said real
[02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:31.480]  was amazing he said it didn't appear that maybe more than one guy who the russians are training
[02:23:31.480 --> 02:23:38.360]  with they spoke perfect english spoke russian so i i said this years ago the perfect double cross
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:44.600]  quadruple cross the point is alex everybody who can turn on each other will turn on each other
[02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:47.800]  we know that's going to come to i want to get in the red and blue list and and green list but
[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:53.080]  before we go there look at how they've shut off half our power plants in seven years look at how
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:59.000]  they've written all the laws to put our jobs overseas and then we wonder why why the weathermen
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:05.400]  the the the meteorologists go yeah these planes are flying around out here doing something that
[02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:09.080]  we believe is blocking the water we don't know why the weather system doesn't come into the west
[02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:14.840]  coast they've been for five years blocking water to bankrupt all that you can see it happening
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:21.320]  to then buy it up later for pennies on the dollar and to kill people who are starving that that's
[02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:26.920]  the problem and i think this is what minorities have got to understand that the reason they have
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:32.840]  been given the benefits and i say this uh the benefits that they begin is so that when the
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:37.560]  time comes they can shut them off the electronic benefits to make you dependent it's to make you
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:44.760]  dependent and when that dependence is no longer being fed literally or being subsidized that's
[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:50.120]  when everything goes crazy and so again the and by the way the blue list again law enforcement
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:55.400]  officers uh national guard military who go along with the red list to take over the guns
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:25:01.000]  then they're they get terminated they don't go to bring uh at their reeducation camps a green list
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:07.080]  of the people that go willingly and that have no political association that's right they they want
[02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:12.520]  the next wave is always a bunch of dumb goobers even in charlotte isherby's uh secret documents
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:19.080]  that she basically got leaked out uh back when she was the deputy head of education was that once
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:24.360]  they've taken over with the police state then they phase that out completely and have these cult-like
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:32.040]  little trendies going around that just run everything yes tx-111 seriously or it's the new uh
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:39.400]  cyborgites okay it's the composite entities that are as little human as possible this is what's uh
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:43.960]  uh recourse while all the people we've talked that's not for this show to talk about that but
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:50.040]  all people up do is look up two words transhumanism and singularity so when i hear i don't believe
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:57.240]  my immediate response now alexis you don't think when i say you're crazy i said i may be crazy with
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:03.640]  truth you're dumb unto death with lies i'm sorry but that's where we're at right now and again people
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:11.160]  have got to take responsibility look it's my kids i i'm a grandfather i know i mean me and i say that
[02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:15.880]  because i never thought i would be a grandparent but the point being i look at my grandchildren
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:21.800]  and i weep i look at my kids half my kids get it half my kids don't oh i know it's even in your own
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:28.360]  family and i mean here's the thing nine times out of ten the wildest stuff we're talking about it
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:33.960]  turns out being worse than we were saying i mean i mean that's what's so crazy is that think about
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:39.480]  everything that's already happened what we put up with now if you listen to our shows in 1996
[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:46.920]  it's like all come true and then i'm just hoping that we are wrong the problem is 95 percent of
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:55.000]  what we say is from them it's out of their fat stinking mouths listen it's also it's also again
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:00.280]  it's it's biblically prophetic obviously the great tribulation when i first went on talk radio
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:04.760]  just let me just point out a statement i made 25 years ago i said you'll know you're in the end
[02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:10.920]  when all the world's dormant volcanoes go active i remember you saying that in 1996 i remember you
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:14.760]  saying these are the the the great ring of fire will heat up you love volcanoes everywhere and i'm
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:18.920]  like this guy's entertaining but i was like come on steve i mean let's be honest i would tell you
[02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:23.160]  on air i think you're going too far yep and there were things that you didn't want me to talk on
[02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:29.480]  air about because because you even said later they made you nervous and the point being is this is that
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:35.880]  when we're so far ahead of our time those who haven't caught up with their time can only ridicule
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:41.160]  and that's and they can only denigrate and ladies and gentlemen i and alex this is the scary part
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:47.640]  i've had and this is this affects you so people have got to hear this when you see an orchestrated
[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:54.440]  hit against info wars alex shows the the reporters listen your reporters have got testicles i'm sorry
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:28:00.680]  to say it that way okay they've got the cahones to go and get it when you hear that the biggest names
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:06.520]  that most people listen to are inventing stories whether it's brian williams where it's the whole
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:12.440]  cadre these guys trying to be something they're not and then i gotta tell you you got guys around
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:19.880]  the field like joe and all these people jacari you know these guys are fearless and what's interesting
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:27.320]  is that they have the truth notice this the towers live in a world of lies and i tell people the
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:33.480]  american battle cry is not meow okay and and i won't go and exactly we're just trying to bring back
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:39.320]  real journalism we openly admit our bias of liberty and tell the truth and it's it's all
[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:44.680]  successful we are successful they can see our success and so they are coming after us in so many
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:49.560]  ways i won't even get into steve what do you think i should be doing just praying more because my
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:56.360]  sixth sense is look out my sixth sense is get ready you ain't seen nothing yet well your sixth sense
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:01.320]  is correct you need to upgrade your security you know and i pray alex you've heard me pray for you
[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:06.200]  your wife your kids and you know by the way i want to say something my critics and alex's critics
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:11.320]  neither one of us kiss anybody's but we're trying to tell all you people they're going to be forced
[02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:18.120]  to bend down and kiss bottom that you don't have to it's get right with jesus i mean that alex i am
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:23.320]  subject to the knowledge that outside of the grace of god and all the people praying for you
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:29.480]  and praying for me the point is we could go into eternity at any time and we have to live
[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:35.160]  with our mortality on a moment by moment basis increase your security increase your security
[02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:41.160]  and increase your prayer life that's that's what i would say to do there's no doubt that this is uh
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:45.640]  some bad stuff's coming down for everybody i've never seen such an exponential gear up and i can

[02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:41.000]  seeks to totally dominate and control the good and when you've got a government that's openly
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:47.160]  run by foreign banks putting us under secret treaties just dismantling every basic freedom
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:54.520]  teaching five-year-olds the most bizarre stuff you can imagine you know that the hammers about
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:59.160]  to drop and you can just see the gear up i mean i'll tell you it's financial the numbers are
[02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:04.040]  coming in that despite unlimited money printing it has not helped the economy because the elite
[02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:08.040]  give themselves the money don't even pass it into the economy then you just have inflation but at
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:13.880]  least you'd have an economy now we have inflation because of elite spending but we don't get any
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:18.920]  more of the profits and when i think about the time bomb of the spoiled brats out there the
[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:23.880]  only care about themselves all these rich people and in middle-class folks when the bottom drops
[02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:28.360]  out and then i think about a hundred million people on welfare 50 million on food stamps
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:35.400]  this is a time bomb steve quell steve quell dot com is our guest before he leaves us we're
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:41.640]  going to talk about true legends of the series that he's now basically the main host of i'd say
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:45.560]  starring him but he doesn't like people to use those type of words very humble man and we're
[02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:51.160]  going to play some of the amazing hd video of him in the jungle and investigating ancient ruins and
[02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:56.280]  things to understand exactly where all this comes from and why the elites always engage in basically
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:35:01.160]  satanic activity human sacrifice you name it what is this evil that keeps manifesting we're going to
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:07.960]  talk to him about that in a moment go to george chris rich michael max and many others but coming
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:12.520]  up michelle failen had this idea about a month ago one of our great writers and investigative
[02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:17.880]  journalist uh i was asking around jacari jackson said yeah i'll be glad to lead that so i want to
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:22.200]  do it while we're live on the radio and tv so hundreds of thousands can see it millions can hear
[02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:28.040]  it this thursday at the main planned parenthood facility in austin texas i'm going to have a
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:33.240]  reverend shoulders of black genocide dot org on i'm going to have the other folks from a pro
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:39.320]  life group up in dallas on uh also to promote what jacari's doing they're going to reach out
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:45.320]  to their uh pro life groups but whether you're pro life or not come on
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:51.400]  planned parenthood was set up by margaret sanger who got awards from hitler gave awards to hitler
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:56.440]  that's on record in in the national archives you can just type in margaret sanger's racist quotes
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:35:59.080]  you can see scans of her letters saying we got to kill the black weeds
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:05.560]  fifty one percent of 52 percent of black people have been aborted 17 million since roe v weight
[02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:10.760]  and it hadn't helped their communities they're worse than ever uh what's the answer kill them all
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:15.480]  see all the people claiming you're racist if you don't support obama care or if you don't
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:19.400]  turn your guns in they're the real poverty pimps the democratic party not that republicans are
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:24.520]  any better but the democratic party were the klan they had a southern strategy that wasn't working
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:28.440]  because republicans under eisenhower were getting all the minorities to vote for them and whites
[02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:33.880]  who were christians and veterans and southerners like my great my dad's dad these texas is the
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:37.960]  south folks texas always go who are ashamed of being part of the south that's not part of the
[02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:42.360]  south it's it's really part of both you know he ran on an eisenhower type platform got elected
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:47.560]  to county government and was for you know desegregation and stuff like that and he was a
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:54.520]  world war two combat vet army air corps they they got that we needed to fix this country and
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:37:00.280]  he of course was pro-life as well you know before he died the point is they're killing people across
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:05.640]  the board and they're saying black lives matter went out of 330 million people you know there's
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:09.400]  probably a couple questionable shootings by the police of black people a week there's just many
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:16.760]  or more white people those don't get the same attention uh because they haven't invoked all
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:21.000]  the race garbage so we're going to be out there with signs that say black lives matter trying to
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.960]  hijack the justice department's movement to create race war to point out the real racial attacks
[02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:30.280]  are against black people in the womb and we know they're innocent so briefly to pop in as

[02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:51.160]  pretty big signs they're going to be uh 11 18 by 24 we're getting those printed off uh we're
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:55.160]  sending them off to the printer today why are you racist against killing the black people well let me
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:58.920]  and speaking of races let me read a quote from why don't you just kill the black people you'd be
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:02.840]  liberal well here's what margaret sanger said founder of plant parenthood colored people are
[02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:09.080]  like human weeds and are to be exterminated so is her uh that's going to letter to colgate right
[02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:13.880]  and so black genocide dot org we've interviewed the founder a few times he's asking is her vision
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:18.520]  being fulfilled today when you have at least 35 percent of the abortions in america are done
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:23.080]  to black people in some cities it's up to 80 percent but it's oh yeah new york's shoulders
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:28.360]  has cracked the numbers is 51 yeah yeah it's they're saying it's 1800 a day i mean there's
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:33.240]  all these statistics you can look at and it and it really is abortion is a war on people and it's
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:38.200]  real racism the point is it really is done on purpose oh yeah yeah and that's while they're in
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:43.560]  78 percent of the plant parenthoods are in lower my lower uh income neighborhoods so they're going
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:48.520]  after the minorities it's uh it's amazing and then you know there's there's some pretty cool stuff on
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:55.240]  black i say cool it's the way they uh the way they organize and talk about how yeah let's
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:39:59.000]  talk him again we can show the history of genocide look at this yeah the history of genocide talking
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:04.440]  about how the nuremberg truss were were made to redefine people in the victim class and now
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:09.560]  you have in 1973 and i sent you guys the link on that as well you they define who a person is
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:14.600]  well now a person somebody who hasn't left the womb yet or who has left the womb so then that
[02:40:14.600 --> 02:40:19.000]  kind of leaves everybody up for grabs if if you're still in the womb you're a prime target at this
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:25.240]  point so it's a really you could just go to black genocide dot org and go to their uh it's called
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:29.720]  abortion and genocide pay and you can just read how they were classifying people and how they started
[02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:35.320]  uh dividing people into different subgroups and now they're saying veterans veterans don't get
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:42.200]  cared now old people don't it's dehumanization it's coming up this thursday during the three hour show

[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:38.600]  calls uh here that are on the board but steve quill before we do that uh any any points on
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:43.800]  abortion any points on the democratic party in its history uh and tell us about your new tv show
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:49.720]  well first of all you really covered margaret sanger and this is the this is the quintessential
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:56.520]  slap in the face of the afro-american population the point is is that it's genocide that's what
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:02.200]  that's what you know i can't do a better job on that than you just did the point that we made
[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:08.280]  earlier about the democrats funding historically funding all the giveaway programs was ultimately
[02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:13.560]  and i'm going to say this it's for the day of slaughter alex and that's exactly what we're trying
[02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:19.800]  to prevent by the grace of god if he gives us a little more time to save more lives and and a nation
[02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:25.000]  that is bathed in blood the whole abortion issue let me give you my two cents about cursing america
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:30.440]  isn't it yes it is and it's about the sacrament of abortion satanists have said you christians
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:37.240]  are this was said to me you christians are so stupid you don't get it this is our sacrificial
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:43.880]  altar mocking everything you believe and i said i get it i'm sorry but i even understand you that's
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:48.360]  what i told the person how many abortuaries has it turned out it turns out that they are doing
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:54.200]  weird rituals dead babies blood and they go oh the doctor was just crazy no they're satanist
[02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:58.680]  who else do you think wants to kill of course the satanist usually are the third trimester ones
[02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:03.160]  other ones just want money but the guys that'll do the third trimester they love it they are
[02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:11.240]  sacrificing babies absolutely so we're in a we're in a we're in a special conflict alex we're told in
[02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:15.080]  the bible in the book of revelation everybody quotes that you've heard me say this on even
[02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:20.520]  coast to coast i'm sure but point is is that it's the testimony of jesus that's who it's talking
[02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:25.480]  about now and look at this country you can worship anything in any one if you want to see how and i
[02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:30.360]  would include that encourage you after american community go and read the statement that the
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:35.080]  president has made concerning jesus christ and the old testament yet when you compare it to what
[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:41.000]  he did his statements about his mom it's it's the tree attack christianity on easter this year
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:47.560]  yes he did and mocked it in ridicule god is not mocked what sort of a man so so shall we read
[02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:53.560]  and even as we're talking today alex the blood is running you know it's funny and for the record
[02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:59.720]  that wasn't me in the true legends trailer the tin looks like a younger me when i had more hair
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:06.120]  timothy alberino took a film crew down to peru and bolivia looking for the we're actually on the
[02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:13.240]  trail of live giants actual giants who have been seen in peru and bolivia in contemporary times
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:18.280]  but in order to lay the basis the technology of the fallen we're laying out the case and this is
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:24.040]  this you know is on my website you can go look at it or you can go to uh true legends of series
[02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:29.480]  dot com sure but it is you sitting in front of the fireplace yeah that is me forgive me that is me
[02:44:29.480 --> 02:44:34.680]  you know maybe maybe my ego demands i wish i were in the jungles but the point being is is that
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:39.560]  we're we're presenting a series of i'm funding a series you know trying to raise the funding
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:46.120]  for the series for nine uh episodes as opposed to the everything is aliens crowd we've got some
[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:51.720]  of the best eyewitness views of who's messing you know anytime for instance my film team was
[02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:58.280]  constantly monitored by intelligence agents and the agents of the vatican for the record to keep
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:02.520]  an eye on what we're doing so it's going to be an amazing thing the five-minute trailer i would
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:07.880]  hope everybody takes a look at because it's it as you said it's incredibly well done and the
[02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:12.680]  documentary should be out available on the 15th the sale of proceeds will fund the other nine
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:18.360]  issues and you know man i i just am an awe at how you pull off everything you pop because it costs
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:25.240]  millions of dollars to do what you got to do but fortunately our budget you know is is that we can
[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:31.160]  do each episode for about 100 to 125 thousand dollars i have been approached by the past i get
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:37.960]  calls almost weekly emails uh easily every other week from a history channel geographic channel
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:42.680]  all these guys wanting me to come on wanting to turn over my pilot friend that actually flew a
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:52.120]  dead giant giant out of afghanistan in uh 20 i'm sorry 2005 and uh basically when the special forces
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:57.240]  team went in to take them out the giant killed them all ate them all and the fascinating thing is
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:03.320]  i got to share something that's interesting is that when we're down there everybody who's are
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:10.120]  like in the 80 75 to 80 years whether they're in sardinia and uh the mediterranean or in um
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:16.280]  south america prune bolivia the point is is that the old have an amazing story to tell the young
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:21.720]  people they're just buying into what they see on tv and what they watch on the internet well we
[02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:25.320]  certainly know there's a lot of hidden crazy stuff and as you said things before i thought
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:29.240]  we're just over the top and then they are not to be true well well i definitely want to watch
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:34.040]  these series and it's really interesting steve quail steve quail dot com let's go to chris
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:41.080]  in north carolina you're on the air welcome yes sirs uh this question's for dan or steve quail
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:49.560]  sorry i'll probably dang well that's weird it's okay dan quills go ahead uh my question is do you
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:55.720]  quail do you think the government already knows about and then pinning den from islamic
[02:46:55.720 --> 02:47:00.840]  terrorist in the jade helm area do you think that's going to implement marshal wall well i think it's
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:06.840]  going to be one of things that springboards us into marshal on uh yeah you can't say isis an open
[02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:13.480]  border with any type of intellectual or emotional or moral integrity why have the borders not been
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:18.520]  secured alex has had people on i've talked to him interviewed him uh read their emails on the air
[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:24.760]  they're basically saying if we arrest anybody who's a known terrorist and i'm not talking about uh
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:30.360]  latinos or or hispanics they they're talking about someone comes in from the state department
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:38.120]  and orders and uh let go so the point is absolutely isis here's the point in terror terror is ultimately
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:43.720]  to bring about submission and that's what they're trying to do we see it in the politics of radical
[02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:48.680]  islam in the united states we see it all through the middle east and the point is we could have
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:54.840]  stopped us and then if anybody remembers alex remember the long uh a victory parade four and
[02:47:54.840 --> 02:48:00.920]  a half mile long of isis and their captured us stuff in iraq yes and and people were saying
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:07.240]  why did we hit them then well simply because the powers that be in this country deep down
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:10.840]  they are satanists and they're going to use everybody it goes right back to albert pike
[02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:15.080]  statement you know turn the muslims against the jews jews against christians and when everybody
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:19.240]  wipes out everybody we bring on lucifer the true god and i'm not going to argue with anybody that's
[02:48:19.240 --> 02:48:23.160]  a moral well sure that's what they're doing and then people say alex you're the guy that exposed
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:30.920]  false flag terror on 9 11 why are you saying isis is real they have raised this al qaeda jihadi
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:34.920]  army they've changed the name to isis in islamic state to confuse the public i think colonel
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:41.720]  schaefer on you name it the pentagon knows 90 plus percent of the free syrian army he is al qaeda
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:48.520]  he is isis and so our government's funding him they let him come in they let him attack no need to
[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:53.640]  even stage an event now because the upstream they created them allow them to operate through saudi
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:49:01.320]  funding through nato funding then they can take our liberties in in the response to isis and isis
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:06.520]  in return is given part of the middle east as their payoff for being the secret army that
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:11.320]  destabilizes the west so a police state can be put in place and that's the bottom line of what's
[02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:16.760]  happening separately though it just shows what a farce homeland security is because they say their
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:23.240]  main mission is who those of us that don't want to go along with the new world order thank you chris
[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:29.560]  let's talk to michael in mississippi you're on the air go ahead uh hey alex they speak uh
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:35.480]  steve i had a question um i've listened to several interviews that you've that uh with bob fletcher
[02:49:35.480 --> 02:49:41.560]  including the one you did with on the hagman show and uh bob fletcher is pretty much stake put his
[02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:47.720]  uh investigative credibility and reputation on the line about an incoming celestial event that
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:53.400]  he believes marshal all must be established or said in place that's right a lot of folks think
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:59.160]  there's a a asteroid coming in or something what do you know about that well i you know i'm years
[02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:06.520]  ago i talked specifically about uh nibburu and that's but that's the um that's the official
[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:12.920]  ancient name the 10th planet planet in the yeah planet x gabriel's fist lucifer's hammer
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:19.320]  and based on what a navy seal i posted on my alert side navy seal explains a big event as
[02:50:19.320 --> 02:50:24.520]  being that okay in other words alex they know of all the earth changes that are going to be
[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:30.520]  happening they know of all of the electrical discharges they know of roaches r o c h e's limit
[02:50:30.520 --> 02:50:35.880]  and the point is that the whole universe if you want to uh look at it real simply is go and look
[02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:42.040]  up velikovsky worlds in collision and then the time of this is interesting because we've heard
[02:50:42.040 --> 02:50:47.800]  both of us from separate sources that they're stocking their underground of well sure and how
[02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:54.040]  many how many record blood moons have there been well uh what is it three the fourth is coming up
[02:50:55.160 --> 02:50:59.480]  i mean i i don't even put steak in all this but the elites do they're obsessed with it all

[02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:27.160]  spread the word some of the stories up on infowars.com explosive new documents reveal
[02:54:27.160 --> 02:54:34.360]  Obama Clinton spin and lies on Benghazi Al Gore's climate change lies exposed the latest on that
[02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:39.080]  now that now he says in a few more years will be all flooded and dead basically of course he said
[02:54:39.080 --> 02:54:46.680]  in 2007 it would be by 2013 leftist exploit biker bloodbath to complain about white privilege
[02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:51.320]  they say why isn't the national guard out on the street because they they arrested everybody it's
[02:54:51.320 --> 02:54:59.480]  it's it happened in a localized area isn't just random people going out and burning stuff it was a
[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:08.760]  outlaw motorcycle gang impromptu rally and the whole thing's very suspicious
[02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:15.480]  now they've got a giant rot rally coming up in Austin Texas and who knows what's gonna
[02:55:15.480 --> 02:55:19.000]  happen with that most of the bike riders are great people I don't care if you want to wear
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:25.240]  an outfit be part of a club come up the criminal groups claim their anti-establishment but all
[02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:30.920]  I see is them working with the establishment their drug dealing and all the rest of it going back to
[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:38.200]  Steve quail we're taking phone calls Steve what do you think is really going on with this I mean
[02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:43.960]  you say you have some questions about it why does everything keep popping up in Texas well I think
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:51.560]  that Texas number one has one of the most the strongest real based economies in the world without
[02:55:51.560 --> 02:55:58.440]  massive amounts of debt number two it's the spirit of the Alamo number three it basically is because
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:03.880]  if that secret agreement that is in place that I've been told that you've been affirmed that it
[02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:09.320]  is due to return of it long to Mexico then obviously the greatest resistance is going to come from
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:14.920]  Texas Texas has a history and by the way was there a TV series out or a HBO special called
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:20.520]  the sons of Texas I think there was or something or is coming out and I thought that was very
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:26.200]  prophetic in its timing so it's because of the border it's because of the strength of the people
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:31.960]  it's because you're obviously a Godfrey state historically with you know minor exceptions
[02:56:31.960 --> 02:56:38.040]  and some of it politics and that's the idea of all of the assets that are available in Texas
[02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:43.080]  meaning they all it's definitely a so standalone country and the US surpassed a year ago Saudi
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:47.880]  Arabian global production that's mainly Texas is the biggest well producer in the world it has its own
[02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:52.760]  infrastructure they've looked at the demographics and they know politically Texas is not going to
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:59.000]  say yes to the new world order and so Jade Helm is a dry run we're not demonizing the
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:06.120]  military it's there to condition them as well rich in Ohio you're on the air go ahead hi Alex and
[02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:12.280]  Steve welcome to the combination it's great to talk to both of you guys at the same time
[02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:19.720]  you guys are excellent I watch your videos and you know I connect the dots thank you brother
[02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:25.800]  both you're both starting around the big dots you both see it but you don't see it well hey
[02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:29.720]  you're on the air no I don't need to preface it got a minute and a half till break go ahead look
[02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:35.880]  look at the work of one Gil Brossard and Planet Seven X and forget all the rest of the crap
[02:57:35.880 --> 02:57:43.800]  and then look at Richard Shaw's new production on the tour codes and these are the two biggest dots
[02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:48.280]  that are interconnected that you're listening you know I've been on the air for 20 years and I'm
[02:57:48.280 --> 02:57:52.600]  always hearing about Planet X I know there's a Kuiper belt there's an asteroid belt I know we
[02:57:52.600 --> 02:57:57.240]  get struck by big objects I know it's real but people are always saying it's coming in two three
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:58:02.360]  years and it just becomes this all-encompassing thing I know governments are dug in four big
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:07.320]  collisions uh comments you name that I'm just so I know that's a real threat Yellowstone
[02:58:07.320 --> 02:58:13.480]  Supervolcano all of it uh but to just say it's this and it's going to happen I don't think we
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:18.760]  can say that Steve Cuell. Alex you know I hear about Yellowstone's going to blow any minute
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:24.520]  I fly down there almost weekly sometimes I mean I'm down there it's not ready to blow the bottom
[02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:28.760]  line is it doesn't do you good to worry about Planet X if you're going to be get wiped out uh
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:35.480]  you know in August, September should J. Helm go uh active the timing is always the issue
[02:58:35.480 --> 02:58:38.680]  doesn't stay there Steve back at 70 seconds I want you to finish up

[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:08.360]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown arabica beans we have now managed to secure

[03:00:07.880 --> 03:00:14.440]  that's right it's alex jones and the gcn radio network the over-the-top nature of reality is
[03:00:14.440 --> 03:00:22.200]  why so many people just can't wake up because it is legendary epic what's happening and let's say
[03:00:22.200 --> 03:00:27.560]  we're exaggerating and half of it's true it's still over the top insane and unfortunately i think
[03:00:27.560 --> 03:00:32.040]  it's probably worse than we're saying in many respects the elite have gone insane like caligula
[03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:38.920]  i want to go to max mike and others here in just a moment and i want to give a final comment real
[03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:44.360]  quick after that to steve quail i really appreciate riding shotgun with us today max has a question
[03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:51.800]  for steve quail on weather weapons go ahead hi alex jones and quail man i was wondering with uh
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:59.240]  the weather weapons they use um electrophrequency magnitudes and microwaves and also chemical
[03:00:59.240 --> 03:01:05.720]  drills interfere also with i naturally assume so the human body and mind and also a further
[03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:16.920]  extension of mk ultra are you asking me if it can affect the human mind uh if we'll also use the
[03:01:17.480 --> 03:01:22.520]  effect the human mind yes thank you max absolutely i'm sorry alex's phone broke up or something i
[03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:27.880]  could barely hear that's why i let him go his phone went bad go ahead yeah yeah absolutely there are
[03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:35.480]  so many studies you can go on the internet electronic mind control also it's possible to produce
[03:01:35.480 --> 03:01:39.560]  heart attacks i mean they have electromagnetic weapons and i believe that's what they use down
[03:01:39.560 --> 03:01:44.920]  right part when they killed him within five what was it within five or ten minutes after
[03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:50.040]  national defense authorization act you know 1867 was in place andrew by part was dead what about
[03:01:50.040 --> 03:01:56.360]  michael hastings and blowing his car up i mean they really are killing people yeah for for a certainty
[03:01:56.360 --> 03:02:00.520]  and i've done my homework alex it's just on weather wars people say well they can't do that
[03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:05.320]  i'm just telling you they can and when i've spent you know i i'm looking at my i don't
[03:02:05.320 --> 03:02:11.720]  400 500 footnotes whatever there is the point is this yes they can yes they are and yes they will
[03:02:13.080 --> 03:02:18.440]  we're not in kansas anymore as i say every day and we are in a futuristic weirdo land
[03:02:18.440 --> 03:02:26.920]  and the public still thinks we're back in 1950 we're not uh let's talk to um let's go ahead
[03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:32.600]  and talk to drew in missouri you're on the air with steve quayle go ahead uh yeah i mean great
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:38.040]  great talk to you too uh real quick my question is uh i mean i got two small kids and i want to
[03:02:38.040 --> 03:02:42.840]  be prepared for this upcoming civil war uh what are the three you know maybe three top things you
[03:02:42.840 --> 03:02:48.680]  suggest a guy should do i got a farm yeah i can prepare and self-sustained what do you suggest
[03:02:48.680 --> 03:02:53.480]  like guns and ammo silver and gold stuff how food and water yeah by the way they've been
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:02:58.040]  holding gold down it's starting to go back up uh steve quayle what would you do the top things to
[03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:04.040]  get ready uh for the unraveling of society which we know is coming the only question is when right
[03:03:04.040 --> 03:03:09.000]  well this is going to sound extreme but at the time when i say extreme at some point all of us
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:13.240]  have to throw our smartphones away okay that's true that's a radio tracking oh yeah they track
[03:03:13.240 --> 03:03:18.040]  everywhere you go with it yeah yeah but the number one food first what i'm telling everybody alex
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:25.800]  food prices are going to rise food will be available but at nothing near recognizable prices
[03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:30.360]  so no matter what a budget is i'm i know the farmer just got food and stuff started up
[03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:35.160]  you have to have a farm a self defense you must absolutely and be familiar with it
[03:03:35.160 --> 03:03:41.080]  i'm sorry a father is charged biblically to protect his family and alex you've got on record
[03:03:41.080 --> 03:03:46.120]  i've got on record there's nobody as long as we're alive and god gives us grace and breath
[03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:49.560]  that are going to harm those that's right it's not we're looking for violence you've just got to
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:54.280]  be ready to kill for your family and already be preset that you're not going to think about it
[03:03:54.280 --> 03:03:59.800]  when the time comes or you'll be dead absolutely the other thing you've got to think about is having
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:07.480]  a secondary location everybody needs a back door by back door if you have lancer you know make sure
[03:04:07.480 --> 03:04:12.760]  that you have other areas on your land beside the home the point is is that you know you've
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:18.440]  got to get a a realistic working knowledge of the things that disappear first and you want to be where
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:24.360]  everyone else isn't when the cash are killing cash so the only way people outside of the system who
[03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:29.240]  won't take the mark of the beast will be able to do any type of commerce is with gold and silver
[03:04:29.240 --> 03:04:33.720]  there's an attack on that they've kept it down it's getting ready to move and we're watching
[03:04:33.720 --> 03:04:37.640]  that in the last three days that's right i want to have you up very soon if you can do it steve
[03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:42.280]  to break down because you're a top prepper one of the main founding guys you never talk about that
[03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:48.840]  about just the war on individualism on cash on farming on the family i mean we can see the
[03:04:48.840 --> 03:04:53.640]  systematic takeover steve quill dot com amazing books and information they're on the site people
