[01:43.920 --> 01:50.000]  know that our best chance of defeating them politically non violently is taking

[02:47.160 --> 02:56.240]  referring to an article this morning that is in the El Paso newspaper and the
[02:56.240 --> 03:05.240]  El Paso newspaper is reporting this so we'll be going over that coming up
[03:05.240 --> 03:13.040]  after this first break I had the El Paso story here in my oh here it is
[03:13.040 --> 03:21.200]  Texas Crafts plan for Mexico collapse this out of the El Paso times and Time
[03:21.200 --> 03:27.040]  magazine has come out and called for a world government run by a new super
[03:27.040 --> 03:32.040]  World Bank I'm gonna read the actual quote there a month ago Newsweek had
[03:32.040 --> 03:36.320]  basically an identical article Newsweek this week of course says we're all
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.440]  socialists now no we're all slaves the bankers now until we wake up and say
[03:40.440 --> 03:44.800]  it's illegitimate and they're the very ones that ran this whole heist this whole
[03:44.800 --> 03:50.760]  swindle job and until we wake up and understand the government's not here to
[03:50.760 --> 03:53.640]  help us it's here to rob us it's only gonna get worse so we'll go over that
[03:53.640 --> 03:59.640]  and I want to ask Rush Limbaugh I want to ask the ADL I want to ask the
[03:59.640 --> 04:03.040]  Congress I want to ask to the different federal agencies you put out all these
[04:03.040 --> 04:07.080]  memos and training manuals saying we're schizophrenic terrorists that we said
[04:07.080 --> 04:11.000]  that there was a world government being set up by offshore banks because all
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.800]  their own documents said it and you and you you were still teaching and still
[04:14.800 --> 04:19.240]  showing on TV shows like 24 and others not just in your own training manuals
[04:19.240 --> 04:22.680]  but in popular culture that we're insane why because we read the newspaper now
[04:22.680 --> 04:27.720]  you know before we read the documents and leaked documents and things and we
[04:27.720 --> 04:32.720]  read the transcripts of Davos and the Club of Rome and others and you you
[04:32.720 --> 04:36.960]  lied about it and said it didn't exist when it was in the early days we had a
[04:36.960 --> 04:40.960]  better chance of stopping it now that it's here they're announcing it and this
[04:40.960 --> 04:46.360]  is such a key issue so I rebuke all of you in the media and the government that

[08:35.360 --> 08:39.360]  security prosperity partnership said through crises through terrorism through
[08:39.360 --> 08:42.840]  economic collapse they would bring in their North American Union and now
[08:42.840 --> 08:47.240]  every major publication in the country is telling the public the solution to the
[08:47.240 --> 08:52.720]  imploding economy which they engineered is world government total tyranny
[08:52.720 --> 08:58.320]  healthcare rationing gun confiscation FEMA camps it's all being announced
[08:58.320 --> 09:03.960]  internment camps readied for mass illegal alien influx Texas officials say
[09:03.960 --> 09:08.040]  contingency plans are in place for collapse of Mexico policy only covers
[09:08.040 --> 09:12.360]  law enforcement needs does not address humanitarian issues the news that Texas
[09:12.360 --> 09:15.600]  officials are working on contingency plans with the federal government to
[09:15.600 --> 09:20.560]  deal with the sudden influx of illegal aliens flowing across the border
[09:20.560 --> 09:24.240]  following a collapse of the Mexican government has sparked fears that FEMA
[09:24.240 --> 09:28.560]  detention camps an expansion of which is the subject of current legislation in
[09:28.560 --> 09:32.800]  Congress are being readied to detain thousands of illegals as well as
[09:32.800 --> 09:40.560]  American citizens now the National Security Council drew up the Rex 84 plan
[09:40.560 --> 09:46.760]  in 1984 to sell the public on building giant FEMA camps in the name of putting
[09:46.760 --> 09:51.720]  displaced aliens illegal aliens and citizens then it came out that was
[09:51.720 --> 09:55.720]  really a martial law plan this came out mainstream news and in hearings in
[09:55.720 --> 10:00.560]  Congress to take over the civilian government overthrow Congress through
[10:00.560 --> 10:05.080]  the executive now that's already happened that's happened they have declared
[10:05.080 --> 10:09.040]  the power they're moving forward incrementally with the steps training the
[10:09.040 --> 10:12.720]  military and the police to accept it and everything's being transferred to foreign
[10:12.720 --> 10:17.560]  banks we are now in receivership through fraud to the New World Order
[10:17.560 --> 10:21.560]  according to an El Paso Times report Texas officials are working on a plan to
[10:21.560 --> 10:24.560]  respond to potential collapse the Mexican government and the specter of
[10:24.560 --> 10:28.240]  thousands of fleeing north in fear for their lives of recent reports indicate
[10:28.240 --> 10:31.920]  the country could be on the verge of chaos they had a staged election and
[10:31.920 --> 10:34.680]  the guy really lost by millions of votes but they had the military go out
[10:34.680 --> 10:40.520]  machine gun crowds they're having thousands of murders and deaths now
[10:40.520 --> 10:44.880]  every week there are rocket attacks newspapers being firebombed in the
[10:44.880 --> 10:49.280]  United States homes are being burned from Texas to Arizona to Southern
[10:49.280 --> 10:54.920]  California La Reconquista stuff is spray painted everywhere the quote la
[10:54.920 --> 11:00.960]  reconquering the reconquering it's just a total free-for-all the most dangerous
[11:00.960 --> 11:04.520]  place in the world is the border with Mexico according to State Department
[11:04.520 --> 11:09.840]  four years ago routinely we've had the share of son Mexican troops come as far
[11:09.840 --> 11:15.200]  as five miles over the border at gunpoint if the police arrest a load of
[11:15.200 --> 11:21.560]  cocaine or marijuana they take it at gunpoint Mexican army the few thousand
[11:21.560 --> 11:24.120]  national guard troops put down there for show have been ordered not to have
[11:24.120 --> 11:28.920]  weapons and are told to run if fired on they do turn tail and run continually
[11:28.920 --> 11:33.960]  it only makes it in local papers but don't worry with the case of the
[11:33.960 --> 11:37.800]  Olympic swimmer in the marijuana they've just arrested eight people and are
[11:37.800 --> 11:42.840]  talking about indicting him don't worry don't worry they're gonna spend lots of
[11:42.840 --> 11:48.400]  manpower on the Olympic swimmer smoking marijuana but the rocket attacks the
[11:48.400 --> 11:53.760]  truck bombs it was a truck bomb in Dallas but just made a tiny mention see
[11:53.760 --> 11:57.320]  real terrorism is ignored
[11:58.200 --> 12:02.680]  this is all caused by the phony drug war as the Pentagon backed Mexican
[12:02.680 --> 12:05.600]  government battles with other cartels not under their control to have a
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.520]  monopoly over the drugs that's all this is a $400 million a year industry in
[12:09.520 --> 12:13.960]  North America and they launder the money in the big banks that's on record and
[12:13.960 --> 12:20.800]  so again another little wonderful thing the drug war gives us you hope for the
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.920]  best but plan for the worst Catherine Sessinger special for Governor Rick
[12:25.920 --> 12:29.520]  Perry said last week at this point we've got a contingency plan that's in
[12:29.520 --> 12:34.960]  development Texas Homeland Security Director Steve McGraw stated that the
[12:34.960 --> 12:39.080]  preliminary plan was in place that dealt only with law enforcement concerns it
[12:39.080 --> 12:51.200]  did not address humanitarian needs now in January of 2006 it came out that
[12:51.200 --> 12:57.120]  Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Roode had been given a huge contract to
[12:57.120 --> 13:03.320]  build three one million person camps so for three million people they have built
[13:03.320 --> 13:07.280]  those they already built others under the civilian and made labor camp program
[13:07.280 --> 13:11.080]  there's now 24 military bases with camps on them don't believe me just google
[13:11.080 --> 13:16.240]  civilian and made labor camp program you'll be on the army's website they
[13:16.240 --> 13:23.160]  kept it secret from it when they started it in 86 to 97 declassified in 97 it's in
[13:23.160 --> 13:26.160]  my book to send the tyranny and it's also in several of my films people still
[13:26.160 --> 13:31.000]  don't believe it so when you hear about this legislation of building giant new
[13:31.000 --> 13:36.080]  FEMA camps having local police and local pastors involved that's just now the
[13:36.080 --> 13:45.920]  publication of it that's now introducing it that'll be the PR front as you know
[13:45.920 --> 13:49.600]  riots start and starving people go into them you'll see country bands and rock
[13:49.600 --> 13:52.320]  bands playing on the stage for people but they'll announce there's been some
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.720]  riots in the camps and people are having to be taken to stockades and well you
[13:56.720 --> 14:00.760]  know the camps are needed the economic collapse came they are they always had
[14:00.760 --> 14:05.000]  no how to roll things out with the crises they create and then oh they're
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.720]  putting troops on the streets for the illegal aliens oh they're putting troops
[14:07.720 --> 14:12.560]  on the streets and just outside austin and taylor they have a big FEMA camp
[14:12.560 --> 14:15.760]  we've been out there and protested it we have video of it an in-game liberal
[14:15.760 --> 14:19.920]  and for global enslavement and they grab the illegal aliens without due
[14:19.920 --> 14:24.600]  process and they don't even deport them and they grab the children and it's
[14:24.600 --> 14:29.040]  full of children as well but again it's only a beta test and then these people
[14:29.040 --> 14:35.720]  deserve due process as well but they set the precedent on a group I think the
[14:35.720 --> 14:40.680]  public will go along with this song so this ties into everything else that is
[14:40.680 --> 14:45.040]  currently happening the rollout of the military takeover of the United States
[14:45.040 --> 14:50.240]  is ongoing and with that an increase by five billion dollars in the current
[14:50.240 --> 14:56.880]  black ops budget now publicly being admitted fake newscast propaganda paid
[14:56.880 --> 15:00.080]  off reporters in the news that's why you just hear endless worship of the
[15:00.080 --> 15:04.000]  military endless worship of the troops that's the sucker young people into
[15:04.000 --> 15:11.880]  thinking it's a good thing to join and it's not our military it's globalist it
[15:11.880 --> 15:15.320]  is globalist that they are there to make sure the foreign banks are able to
[15:15.320 --> 15:19.720]  take over the United States we're gonna get into this with glenn spencer
[15:19.720 --> 15:23.360]  sheriff richard mackin officer jack mclean coming up in the next few hours
[15:23.360 --> 15:31.680]  getting into the banking situation on the face of it george bush was in his
[15:31.680 --> 15:36.680]  his administration was involved in the latter implementation of the banker
[15:36.680 --> 15:39.520]  takeover but the democrats were the biggest cheerleaders more republicans
[15:39.520 --> 15:43.600]  voted against it than democrats did I'm not being partisan I'm stating facts
[15:43.600 --> 15:46.240]  here for all the democrats that I hear going oh
[15:46.240 --> 15:50.160]  Barack Obama was against the banking takeover he was against the banker bailout
[15:50.160 --> 15:54.920]  no he wasn't he honk showed it and I've got it on record with Rahm Emanuel the
[15:54.920 --> 15:58.080]  chief of staff who was in Congress at the time bragging he's the architect of
[15:58.080 --> 16:04.560]  it okay point is is it seamless transition and if you look at who he's
[16:04.560 --> 16:09.720]  brought in Timothy Geithner summers and others as his advisors they are the very
[16:09.720 --> 16:12.960]  group under clinton in the 90s that got rid of the Glass-Steagall act and other
[16:12.960 --> 16:16.880]  laws to allow the banks to leverage and run all these derivatives and run these
[16:16.880 --> 16:21.160]  scams and allow general electric everybody else get into fractional
[16:21.160 --> 16:25.520]  reserve or fiat money creation they just bought up the world with it now
[16:25.520 --> 16:29.240]  there's this big bubble they use to buy things up with they hold the real assets
[16:29.240 --> 16:38.000]  and pass the end of the Ponzi scheme on to us so all of that is going on and do
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.960]  you hear about indictments of Timothy Geithner you hear about indictments of
[16:40.960 --> 16:45.360]  summers you hear about indictments of Rubin no it's how their geniuses and how
[16:45.360 --> 16:49.040]  they're wonderful and how they'll fix everything when they're the very ones that
[16:49.040 --> 16:53.240]  engineered all this by design and broke all these laws they didn't just change
[16:53.240 --> 16:58.840]  the laws and Obama had a Freudian slip today's going so we've got to get this
[16:58.840 --> 17:04.400]  money flowing to the bankers I mean to the to the people and then the last bail
[17:04.400 --> 17:08.000]  out they won't say where the money went well they can't because all these banks
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.840]  are running criminal Ponzi schemes that's why there's no transparency and they
[17:13.840 --> 17:17.640]  don't want the capital flowing the money goes into the banks and then the
[17:17.640 --> 17:21.400]  government bars it right back from an interest and then puts it into more
[17:21.400 --> 17:28.000]  government and then we pay the taxes on it now I'm making this Obama deception
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.920]  film right now and my problem is there's too much proof literally hundreds and
[17:31.920 --> 17:36.080]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles a week saying world government
[17:36.080 --> 17:39.880]  is the answer world government a huge giant central bank and here it is in
[17:39.880 --> 17:44.920]  Time Magazine today the headline what's the name of the story the new world
[17:44.920 --> 17:52.400]  order the new world order by Justin Fox and he goes through saying oh my gosh
[17:52.400 --> 17:55.960]  the banks are in trouble it's America's fault when America has actually been set
[17:55.960 --> 18:05.280]  up the world demands change and what does he say the answer is Bretton Woods to
[18:05.280 --> 18:09.120]  and the view of many outside the US and some within the only way to limit such
[18:09.120 --> 18:13.600]  excesses is through a bigger more powerful IMF that can act as a central
[18:13.600 --> 18:17.920]  bank of the world that means setting the rules and knocking heads when needed oh
[18:17.920 --> 18:21.200]  the very bankers that engineered it will now get even more power and they'll
[18:21.200 --> 18:25.680]  knock heads yeah on your business your company I'm reading from Time Magazine
[18:25.680 --> 18:29.520]  while everybody agrees that this new IMF needs to be less dominated by the US see
[18:29.520 --> 18:33.800]  our powers nothing transferred and Western Europe things get controversial as
[18:33.800 --> 18:39.160]  soon as you go past voting rights should capital flows be restricted should
[18:39.160 --> 18:43.080]  there be limits on free trade on trade deficits and surpluses see total
[18:43.080 --> 18:46.800]  control over our government see what third world countries get taken over by
[18:46.800 --> 18:50.080]  the IMF and World Bank and their whole governmental structure gets set and
[18:50.080 --> 18:53.960]  directed by them and that's what the 2002 documents from the IMF World Bank said
[18:53.960 --> 18:59.600]  they were gonna do this to Europe in the US they set it up they do it then come
[18:59.600 --> 19:03.560]  in with conditions saying we'll loan you your own money back if you let us
[19:03.560 --> 19:08.200]  control everything continuing should the IMF be able to order around even the
[19:08.200 --> 19:13.320]  US that's a quote if the answer to any of these questions is yes global capital
[19:13.320 --> 19:18.840]  will have entered a new dramatically less freewheeling era it will all free
[19:18.840 --> 19:22.200]  we don't want freewheeling that sounds good the very group of international
[19:22.200 --> 19:26.080]  bankers that did all of this we've always told you setting up think tanks
[19:26.080 --> 19:29.600]  buying off state governments getting everybody in debt setting the system up
[19:29.600 --> 19:34.560]  to do it they're now coming with all these new taxes to squeezes to take our
[19:34.560 --> 19:38.360]  money give it to themselves and then they use it to put conditions on us and
[19:38.360 --> 19:44.040]  loan it back to us in interest now if that isn't sick I don't know what is so
[19:44.040 --> 19:48.120]  it's all happening ladies and gentlemen I'll continue covering the economic news

[21:59.720 --> 22:03.640]  hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal
[22:03.640 --> 22:07.360]  Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[22:07.360 --> 22:11.040]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[22:11.040 --> 22:14.000]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.760]  accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[22:17.760 --> 22:21.160]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will
[22:21.160 --> 22:24.680]  skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[22:24.680 --> 22:28.400]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[22:28.400 --> 22:32.320]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[22:32.320 --> 22:36.120]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[22:36.120 --> 22:40.080]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability
[22:40.080 --> 22:43.960]  I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly
[22:43.960 --> 22:48.080]  repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been
[22:48.080 --> 22:53.040]  driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for more

[23:03.640 --> 23:07.240]  with the recent bailout international bankers and power brokers have
[23:07.240 --> 23:11.400]  engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to
[23:11.400 --> 23:15.280]  act as savior but we've only seen the beginning their next engineered crisis
[23:15.280 --> 23:19.200]  will be on a scale never before seen in modern times shortages and empty
[23:19.200 --> 23:22.720]  shelves will spread fear and panic across the land the insiders have
[23:22.720 --> 23:27.000]  discovered that they must control two things to seize total power phase one
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.440]  is a one-world currency which we are currently being prepared to accept

[24:05.520 --> 24:12.400]  you've got all these well-meaning fools that think that Obama's really bringing
[24:12.400 --> 24:19.880]  them peace we've seen all the rallies he had during the campaign on the 91
[24:19.880 --> 24:26.160]  and then incredible stuff the last few days where they said oh my gosh Obama's
[24:26.160 --> 24:29.840]  gonna fix everything I'll never have bills anymore I'll never have problems
[24:29.840 --> 24:34.840]  anymore my whole life is solved everything's okay and Newsweek tells you
[24:34.840 --> 24:38.520]  that's right we're all socialists now the government can fix it when they
[24:38.520 --> 24:42.720]  engineered it all by design notice how he came into office right as the crisis
[24:42.720 --> 24:45.600]  deepens the government that had been telling you everything was fine with
[24:45.600 --> 24:49.600]  the economy says yes we're going into a depression everybody gets
[24:49.600 --> 24:53.720]  completely scared and like Kim Jong-il in North Korea they say our dear leader
[24:53.720 --> 24:57.160]  will save us we've got videos we're gonna play later of people collapsing and
[24:57.160 --> 25:00.880]  crying and begging him at town hall saying please I've lost everything I'm
[25:00.880 --> 25:05.080]  losing my job and he says I will save you and hugs them and they start crying
[25:05.080 --> 25:09.720]  and the and the he hugs the woman and the and the husband's going thank you
[25:09.720 --> 25:15.280]  oh no you've saved me and they have no idea that he's run by the banks that
[25:15.280 --> 25:19.560]  engineered it all that's why I says well I'm gonna save you but it's gonna be
[25:19.560 --> 25:27.360]  austere it's gonna get rough they go cut oh thank you they taught everybody to
[25:27.360 --> 25:30.840]  hate George Bush who was just their puppet they put all the hatred of Bush
[25:30.840 --> 25:39.280]  they transmuted that into love for Barack Obama and now the very banks that
[25:39.280 --> 25:43.640]  engineered the entire crisis by design are fully bankrupting and sucking the
[25:43.640 --> 25:48.280]  country dry hundreds and hundreds of new taxes are being erected total control
[25:48.280 --> 25:52.880]  FEMA camps are being built and Obama can tell his people oh you're hungry go to
[25:52.880 --> 25:56.280]  these facilities and they'll show them go to the facilities and they'll show
[25:56.280 --> 25:59.960]  them happy playing volleyball facilities and then the president said see you
[25:59.960 --> 26:03.640]  always said the army was gonna take over Alex and they did but they helped us
[26:03.640 --> 26:09.280]  and then the terrorist will strike oh and they've got to arrest thousands and
[26:09.280 --> 26:12.280]  tens of thousands of people that were aiding the terrorists and then they've
[26:12.280 --> 26:15.520]  got to arrest people that weren't going along with the government people that
[26:15.520 --> 26:19.080]  didn't let their farm or ranch be nationalized and you know this is
[26:19.080 --> 26:24.240]  socialism you've got to share to help the people this is what's got to happen
[26:24.240 --> 26:27.920]  and the cops will be like things are tough now I never thought America get
[26:27.920 --> 26:31.520]  like this but just like we had to get rid of the Bill of Rights after 9-11
[26:31.520 --> 26:35.440]  well now we got to start arresting everybody cuz you know I need my job I
[26:35.440 --> 26:39.760]  got a family to I know they took most my pension fund but everybody's having to
[26:39.760 --> 26:44.480]  sacrifice and they're telling the people in California they're not gonna get
[26:44.480 --> 26:48.880]  their retirements through government now and they've got to take pay cuts and
[26:48.880 --> 26:53.360]  but don't worry the taxes actually go up because once you go into this phase
[26:53.360 --> 26:57.960]  most the money goes to interest of the foreign banks that had the government
[26:57.960 --> 27:01.560]  create the money and give it to them and then back to us at interest and it's all
[27:01.560 --> 27:06.280]  fiat we've still got the industry the factories the roads the systems globally
[27:06.280 --> 27:12.560]  it's all the entire economy is perception the entire economy is faith and
[27:12.560 --> 27:17.200]  they have destroyed that faith by design they had bush with the torture and the
[27:17.200 --> 27:22.840]  secret arrest and the lying about WMD's all scripted they were more than happy
[27:22.840 --> 27:26.080]  for the truth about 9-11 being an inside job to come out as long as no
[27:26.080 --> 27:30.440]  prosecutions happen that was then blamed on the US not the full global system
[27:30.440 --> 27:36.160]  this is masterful psychological warfare and that's why the elites are in
[27:36.160 --> 27:39.840]  control and I'm here to tell you they are trying to set up a Stalinistic slash
[27:39.840 --> 27:44.040]  Nazi system and they think because of political correctness and the liberal
[27:44.040 --> 27:48.720]  brainwashing that the public will buy it because it's impossible for tyranny
[27:48.720 --> 27:54.280]  to come from a black man it can only come from a white man when right in
[27:54.280 --> 27:58.240]  front of him he's lied about everything first he said that six months after he
[27:58.240 --> 28:01.920]  got in that all the troops to be home then it was 16 months then it was 18
[28:01.920 --> 28:07.080]  months now they said 24 months and then they'll look at it Bush used to say in a
[28:07.080 --> 28:10.920]  year and then we'll look at it now it's two years and we'll look at it I mean
[28:10.920 --> 28:13.840]  every week it goes up by four or five months what will it be 20 years in a
[28:13.840 --> 28:20.400]  few years oh well we'll look at leaving in 20 years of course you don't have to
[28:20.400 --> 28:23.440]  listen to the rhetoric of the frontman Obama you can actually read what the
[28:23.440 --> 28:26.240]  Pentagon says in their own documents and they say they're gonna be a hundred

[34:44.560 --> 34:49.080]  you here and so I just thought we'd have you in here for one segment while
[34:49.080 --> 34:55.280]  you're popping in before the last break I was getting into the fact that we knew
[34:55.280 --> 34:57.680]  that the private central bank for setting up world government which is
[34:57.680 --> 35:01.800]  simple it's a corporate takeover of nation states I think the quote put out
[35:01.800 --> 35:09.720]  by the presidential candidate who ran against LBJ Barry Goldwater is the best
[35:09.720 --> 35:13.200]  where he just describes its foreign banks come in and bother government set up
[35:13.200 --> 35:16.600]  their own structure and remove checks and balances but now they're in hundreds
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.400]  of publications George as you know every day including Time Magazine this week
[35:21.400 --> 35:27.440]  saying we need a world government bank a super IMF World Bank that controls our
[35:27.440 --> 35:32.080]  currency that can that sets the rules and quote knocks heads worldwide now we
[35:32.080 --> 35:34.840]  know from their own documents has always been the plan now that they're
[35:34.840 --> 35:39.520]  announcing it for me means they're making their move right now we're finally
[35:39.520 --> 35:47.040]  and the FEMA camps the taxes the carbon taxes people treating Obama like he's a
[35:47.040 --> 35:50.800]  messianic savior like Kim Jong-il just falling down and begging it went from
[35:50.800 --> 35:55.000]  hope and change to do what I say or the crisis will be a catastrophe so can you
[35:55.000 --> 36:01.600]  speak to what it's like for 16 17 years you've been fighting into now be proven
[36:01.600 --> 36:04.720]  totally right and it's all happening well that's kind of funny that you're
[36:04.720 --> 36:09.480]  bringing this right up because this morning a really dear friend of mine who
[36:09.480 --> 36:16.160]  owns a large manufacturing business up in Michigan who for 18 years has been
[36:16.160 --> 36:20.520]  fighting me he's a staunch Republican and he's been just saying George you are
[36:20.520 --> 36:25.920]  absolutely crazy about this new world order stuff and we're dear friends and
[36:25.920 --> 36:29.720]  he's a good man and he just has a different point of view and just this
[36:29.720 --> 36:34.840]  morning he calls up he says you know George you're right for the last 18 years
[36:34.840 --> 36:39.360]  what you've been telling me about the new world order about the banks and about
[36:39.360 --> 36:43.040]  the takeover and about the deception of the Republicans and the Democrats and
[36:43.040 --> 36:49.800]  the false flags he says you're right and I said you know I love you Bob you're a
[36:49.800 --> 36:55.360]  great guy and it's not about me being right it's about us protecting our
[36:55.360 --> 36:59.760]  country about us protecting our our environment about us protecting our
[36:59.760 --> 37:05.080]  families about us protecting ourselves and right now right now is the time
[37:05.080 --> 37:12.080]  that all of us have to get up and wake up and take the steps because this is
[37:12.080 --> 37:18.360]  no dress rehearsal Obama is the biggest he's the biggest Trojan horse there
[37:18.360 --> 37:25.720]  ever has been there putting Obama in has been so unbelievably incredibly well
[37:25.720 --> 37:29.680]  thought out you know the this whole thing about Obama being an African
[37:29.680 --> 37:34.200]  American I mean it's just it's silly but it's a stroke of genius on their parts
[37:34.200 --> 37:39.040]  because he has just cemented in the hardcore left-wing of the Democratic
[37:39.040 --> 37:44.080]  Party and and a high percentage of the blacks in this country and even though
[37:44.080 --> 37:49.840]  even though it's just so obvious and you did such a great job 15 minutes ago
[37:49.840 --> 37:53.880]  about talking about about bombing all of his appointments and as I've told
[37:53.880 --> 37:59.200]  everybody the fruit is the mark of the tree not the flower now clearly Obama is
[37:59.200 --> 38:04.400]  intelligent he's a flower attic he's a flower he's a beautiful flower but his
[38:04.400 --> 38:11.440]  fruit is rotten poison it's poison and all you have to do is take a look at the
[38:11.440 --> 38:18.720]  people he's put around him the guy who's at his right hand 24-7 Rahm Emanuel is
[38:18.720 --> 38:26.280]  one of the most vicious people in this whole nation and he wants to go in
[38:26.280 --> 38:31.360]  nuke Iran right now not just the military bases but he wants to nuke Tehran
[38:31.360 --> 38:36.320]  his father was an assassin he used to Rahm Emanuel's father used to
[38:36.320 --> 38:44.040]  assassinate British envoys I mean well he was a leader in the Israeli terror
[38:44.040 --> 38:48.320]  organization that blew up hotels and false flag apps absolutely that's on
[38:48.320 --> 38:53.680]  record yeah and his whole family is has Israeli passports and it's nothing
[38:53.680 --> 38:58.480]  against Israel or you know cuz I I don't have a dog in the race between the
[38:58.480 --> 39:02.640]  Palestinians and the Israelis I you know but it's clear that Israel is is
[39:02.640 --> 39:06.720]  heavily involved in overthrow the U.S. there's no question it's not all Israelis
[39:06.720 --> 39:11.080]  most Israelis like most Americans don't really in the Israeli papers now that
[39:11.080 --> 39:14.640]  I mean whether it's true or not they're saying they run this country there's no
[39:14.640 --> 39:18.440]  question about that and so his patriots we have to go ahead and step into the
[39:18.440 --> 39:21.240]  fray let me just read a quote here from Barry Goldwater the trial lateral
[39:21.240 --> 39:25.200]  commission is intended now listen carefully folks this is what's happening
[39:25.200 --> 39:28.000]  now and this is the most trial lateral commission administration we ever seen
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.320]  the trial lateral commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational
[39:32.320 --> 39:36.000]  consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by seizing control of
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.840]  the political government of the United States the trial lateral commission
[39:38.840 --> 39:43.720]  represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the
[39:43.720 --> 39:48.880]  four centers of political power monetary intellectual and ecclesiastical and
[39:48.880 --> 39:52.800]  political and it goes on to see what the trial lateral commission intends is to
[39:52.800 --> 39:57.680]  create a worldwide economic power a worldwide economic power superior to the
[39:57.680 --> 40:00.960]  political governments of the nation states involved as managers and
[40:00.960 --> 40:06.800]  creators of a system they will rule the future in his book published in the
[40:06.800 --> 40:10.440]  seventies with no apologies Barry Goldwater now when you read the financial
[40:10.440 --> 40:13.720]  times of London and Time Magazine and Wall Street Journal they're saying we
[40:13.720 --> 40:17.280]  just got an idea a world government run by a new super bank that'll set the
[40:17.280 --> 40:21.520]  currencies that you'll pay taxes to and carbon taxes to it's the only thing
[40:21.520 --> 40:24.600]  that'll save us if you don't do it the economy's destroyed when it's the very
[40:24.600 --> 40:27.440]  central banks we have this from Bilderberg three years ago that we're
[40:27.440 --> 40:30.160]  going to pop the subprime mortgage you're gonna have for that began we have
[40:30.160 --> 40:33.560]  Daniel Estlin with sources in Bilderberg in in game blueprint for global
[40:33.560 --> 40:38.400]  enslavement on record saying that so and then here it is in Time Magazine today
[40:38.400 --> 40:46.240]  it says that what they need is a more powerful IMF to connect as a central
[40:46.240 --> 40:50.440]  bank to the world and knock heads when needed and it says even over the United
[40:50.440 --> 40:57.320]  States George you know it's almost laughable because you and I have been
[40:57.320 --> 41:02.960]  talking about this very thing day in day out weekend and week out for the last
[41:02.960 --> 41:08.160]  15 years I remember when we used to go down to the television station and you
[41:08.160 --> 41:12.640]  know every single week we would read those quotes we talked about the work
[41:12.640 --> 41:15.920]  there would laugh at us they would just they just they were rude to us at the
[41:15.920 --> 41:19.360]  counter they well there were some good people but now it's like a red carpet
[41:19.360 --> 41:24.400]  and they're just like oh you're right oh yeah and and and everywhere I go people
[41:24.400 --> 41:29.400]  are coming up and saying you're right and then most importantly they're saying
[41:29.400 --> 41:36.360]  what can we do what do we do and because clearly the information that you and I
[41:36.360 --> 41:42.400]  and many other wonderful patriots have been putting out everybody knows that
[41:42.400 --> 41:48.080]  the pirates have taken control of the ship we have mafia running this country
[41:48.080 --> 41:52.960]  anybody looks at Joe Biden and can't tell that he is a mafia dime it's just I
[41:52.960 --> 41:58.840]  mean he's just it it's just so apparent this this quote bailout stimulus
[41:58.840 --> 42:05.040]  package is the greatest theft and transfer of wealth in the history of
[42:05.040 --> 42:10.360]  Occidental history it is just unbelievable and it's going on right
[42:10.360 --> 42:17.800]  before our eyes and the people of this nation are in a comatose state and in
[42:17.800 --> 42:25.320]  it their eyes wide shut but more the good news is that more and more and more
[42:25.320 --> 42:30.120]  people every day are waking up to this reality and that's why they're accelerating
[42:30.120 --> 42:36.160]  the program yes absolutely and the good thing is is that people are saying what
[42:36.160 --> 42:40.200]  can we do and and there's two things that we have to be aware of we have to be
[42:40.200 --> 42:45.760]  aware of the first awakening which is the political economic manipulation of
[42:45.760 --> 42:52.000]  the of the forces of of separation of fear on the people of this nation there
[42:52.000 --> 42:57.520]  is no question none question whatsoever that the people who control our country
[42:57.520 --> 43:03.160]  are into enslaving the people of this world and then this the second awakening
[43:03.160 --> 43:08.160]  because clearly we can't beat them with guns or money right now we can't beat
[43:08.160 --> 43:11.760]  them they've got too many guns now that's not to say that we shouldn't have
[43:11.760 --> 43:16.440]  guns and that we shouldn't stand up and we shouldn't fight but we've got us
[43:16.440 --> 43:22.280]  fighting a smart way and the in the second awakening is is realizing that
[43:22.280 --> 43:27.360]  we have to beat them with a change in paradigm we have to become self-sufficient
[43:27.360 --> 43:31.240]  we have to get out of victim consciousness we have to realize that
[43:31.240 --> 43:35.400]  each and every one of us humans are incredible we have incredible power and
[43:35.400 --> 43:38.640]  it's your destiny you you're not fulfilled because you're not fighting
[43:38.640 --> 43:41.880]  evil you're not fulfilled because you don't respect yourself that's why so many
[43:41.880 --> 43:44.880]  people now would deny what we were saying now they admit it but they say
[43:44.880 --> 43:49.040]  there's nothing we can do the power of the human spirit the dynamic human
[43:49.040 --> 43:54.080]  spirit ladies and gentlemen we this is a test we are put here that this is all
[43:54.080 --> 43:59.080]  playing out as a test it absolutely and clearly it all depends upon one's
[43:59.080 --> 44:03.960]  philosophy about metaphysics I believe that there is a creative energy of this
[44:03.960 --> 44:09.320]  universe that is good and loving and I know that the people of this planet
[44:09.320 --> 44:15.240]  whether they be black Asian white Hispanic that we're all endowed with the
[44:15.240 --> 44:20.560]  energy of the creative force and that we are good and conscious beings but it's
[44:20.560 --> 44:25.040]  up to us us because we're in a free will society I mean this is a free will
[44:25.040 --> 44:29.520]  will world we have only look at how the enemy tries to sell death and
[44:29.520 --> 44:33.400]  destruction and evil as if it's fine they know that where we can once we
[44:33.400 --> 44:38.000]  enter into that greedy system absolutely in the materialism of what
[44:38.000 --> 44:44.600]  Christians call Mammon is so very real and this is not a test and and you can
[44:44.600 --> 44:49.760]  I as you know I go to India every year I study the ancient Vedas I study the
[44:49.760 --> 44:55.240]  scripts of Buddha I've studied the Quran I've studied ancient you know all the
[44:55.240 --> 45:00.440]  ancient teachings and every single teaching has pointed to this period of
[45:00.440 --> 45:05.840]  time whether it's Nostradamus or or or Casey or the Mayans or the Mayans or
[45:05.840 --> 45:11.120]  whatever but it doesn't take prophecy to figure out that these next five years
[45:11.120 --> 45:15.560]  humanity is at a crossroads we're at a crossroads these next five years is in
[45:15.560 --> 45:21.200]  and there's no knight in silver armor that's going to come up and save us
[45:21.200 --> 45:26.000]  it's up to you and me look in the mirror you want to see the solution it's in the
[45:26.000 --> 45:31.880]  mirror absolutely and the first thing is to realize you are not a victim you are
[45:31.880 --> 45:37.600]  endowed with the all the energy and the will and the power of the creative force
[45:37.600 --> 45:42.560]  God and that would in and this is what Gandhi had to get through to the people
[45:42.560 --> 45:48.080]  of India when he came back to India and the in the late when he came back in
[45:48.080 --> 45:52.280]  late teens from South Africa yeah from South Africa he realized that the
[45:52.280 --> 45:56.960]  mentality of the Indian people were really beaten absolutely there are only
[45:56.960 --> 46:01.760]  300,000 British there and there are 300 million Indians there by numbers the
[46:01.760 --> 46:06.200]  Indians could have stamped them out in a matter of moments but they had they were
[46:06.200 --> 46:10.120]  enslaved they also didn't in front people like Obama absolutely they used
[46:10.120 --> 46:16.560]  Indian chiefs here they use front people and in the you know we have to give
[46:16.560 --> 46:22.840]  accolades the Illuminati I mean the picking of Obama was absolutely a work
[46:22.840 --> 46:27.600]  of genius I mean this guy is unbelievable listen I'm watching see first
[46:27.600 --> 46:30.680]  first they says I'm gonna fix all your problems there and the women and men are
[46:30.680 --> 46:34.440]  saying oh I don't have any more bills everything's fine then he comes in as
[46:34.440 --> 46:37.800]  they tell you everything's darkening he says I'll fix it do whatever I say and
[46:37.800 --> 46:43.080]  these people it they are worshiping like like he's Elvis or the or or or the
[46:43.080 --> 46:49.920]  Beatles or Hitler it's unbelievable they're crying you know and they have
[46:49.920 --> 46:54.680]  no idea this guy is sitting directly by the beast it yesterday I was having
[46:54.680 --> 46:59.240]  lunch with a very very dear friend of mine in a good person and he was I was
[46:59.240 --> 47:02.840]  asking about Obama he was telling me all about all the good things and this guy
[47:02.840 --> 47:06.720]  is very involved restaurants are now putting his picture up like we're in
[47:06.720 --> 47:10.160]  this like we're in Nazi Germany his pictures everywhere they're like little
[47:10.160 --> 47:17.000]  shrines in East Austin there is an Obama retail store right now it's it's
[47:17.000 --> 47:21.000]  amazing to me again anytime that happens in history that's deadly dangerous and
[47:21.000 --> 47:25.640]  quite clearly look at the people he surrounded himself what's the guy he
[47:25.640 --> 47:31.080]  put in and the secretary of agriculture he's the Monsanto guy they're all
[47:31.080 --> 47:37.360]  there and and he put in the biggest hardcore agribusiness frank and food
[47:37.360 --> 47:42.720]  person there is and clearly agriculture is the key for freedom and that's why
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.200]  they have the animal ID the premise society yeah and so the per you know he
[47:47.200 --> 47:52.440]  kept gates at secretary of defense he's broken his promise about getting troops
[47:52.440 --> 47:57.800]  out there saying 24 months in Iraq yeah and and and they're increasing their
[47:57.800 --> 48:05.760]  surging in Afghanistan guys the reason he got his initial group of support was
[48:05.760 --> 48:10.520]  because he voted against this insanity in the Middle East and all these people
[48:10.520 --> 48:14.400]  thought he was the peace candidate that was just positioning it was positioning
[48:14.400 --> 48:20.840]  it had nothing to do with idealism and the fact that they have you know after
[48:20.840 --> 48:26.000]  after he was elected I heard the day of his inauguration I heard on the
[48:26.000 --> 48:32.720]  television at least 75 times this is the first African-American ever elected to
[48:32.720 --> 48:40.320]  the United States well his mother is Caucasian his father was 80% Arab and

[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:49.320]  against the synagogue of Satan these antichrist Gentiles that say they're
[1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:56.200]  Jews and millions of Jews have have gone on the web now and on five websites
[1:02:56.200 --> 1:03:02.640]  that I have listed because our wonderful police and soldier Jews contact me and
[1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:07.640]  asked me to put this on the air because when they do it individually they're
[1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:13.960]  murdered by Shin Bet and must the method who works for the communist Zionist and
[1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:18.920]  we've had four of our publishers who published books writers that publish
[1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:23.680]  books that are Jewish that have been murdered by the method and Shin Bet
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:28.840]  so be clear though Jack from your research there's also the Anglo-American
[1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:33.000]  Queen of England arm yeah that has entered red with the Rothschilds and
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:38.040]  and so why at the highest levels do we find that there's also this occultic
[1:03:38.040 --> 1:03:43.520]  slash teutonic strain which if anybody denies they're just not studying the
[1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:50.960]  record that's right yes it's not just the communist Zionist keys are Gentiles
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:56.600]  to call themselves Jews but it is the people you mentioned the Queen of
[1:03:56.600 --> 1:04:02.520]  England and that dynasty we have the Catholic Church the hierarchy of the
[1:04:02.520 --> 1:04:06.600]  Catholic Church setting up the world religion the Antichrist world religion
[1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:12.720]  and we've got the communist Zionist and their partners a lot of them in this
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:17.880]  country to the super rich that are setting up the political system for the
[1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:24.040]  Antichrist world government system so we we're in deep trouble if and and the
[1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:30.680]  reason for this Alex is because we've set back for over 70 years now and let
[1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:35.560]  God be thrown out of this nation there's nothing left there's nothing left in
[1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:41.400]  our system today that is out of the scriptures nothing and so God is mad and
[1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:46.280]  he's bringing his enemies upon us to destroy us and enslave us and if we
[1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:50.960]  can't awaken his people and get back on our knees before God and ask forgiveness
[1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:57.080]  for our national sins then we're going down hard big time well the globalists
[1:04:57.080 --> 1:05:00.600]  have sworn to kill at least half the American population and we're not
[1:05:00.600 --> 1:05:04.040]  joking are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your

[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:43.960]  Jack McClam that is the good news is that freedom loving people of every race
[1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:50.120]  religion and creed are sick of the evil sick of the banksters and the globalists
[1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:52.680]  don't have a choice because we're exposing them they're moving ahead and
[1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:58.040]  accelerating their plan specifically what's your take on all these states
[1:08:58.040 --> 1:09:02.320]  moving and in and bills we've been reading on air openly saying and the
[1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:05.760]  state reps we've been having on mainline state reps saying yes we know it's a
[1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:08.360]  new world order we know they're building FEMA camps we know they're planning
[1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:11.320]  gun confiscations we know we're under martial law we know they want to use
[1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:14.720]  the army against us you know one of these guys was an army officer the state
[1:09:14.720 --> 1:09:18.160]  rep from Washington state he knew all the history had a degree in history is
[1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:23.840]  aware of it I mean really the the knowledge is is is is starting to come
[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:28.400]  out everywhere so we've got a good chance of fighting this if we just take
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:33.280]  action that's right brother I'm just proud and pleased to hear that eight
[1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:37.600]  states have already filed for their reclaim their sovereignty against the
[1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:44.400]  federal takeover of the states in the counties and 20 I guess 20 states are
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:49.920]  looking at it right now very closely so we've got a chance of winning against
[1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:55.160]  these turkeys brother and it's a good it's a good thing but our police it's
[1:09:55.160 --> 1:10:01.360]  sad that when I was a police officer in the war zone of south phoenix the highest
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:07.280]  crime area and was injured repeatedly down there because when I became a
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:13.120]  constitutionalist the the police chief firing me a number of times I kept
[1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:18.000]  winning my job back because I went to the board the civil service board and
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.160]  they kept putting me back to work so he decided to kill me and he told all the
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:28.800]  department 2,500 men and women underarms that if officer mclam calls for a
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:33.240]  backup you don't go to his aid and I worked five years like that and was
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:37.200]  finally injured in the line of duty and had to take a medical retirement of
[1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:45.200]  arresting a drug smuggler on a Sunday morning but after I was in there and I
[1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:50.480]  was a Christian and wrote about it in aid and abet police military newsletter on
[1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:56.160]  constitutional issues that they changed the hiring practices this has been 20
[1:10:56.160 --> 1:11:00.920]  years ago brother to where they don't hire Christians anymore if you're of
[1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:05.920]  high moral character and they ask you six hundred questions that you have to
[1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:10.800]  fill out a form answering six hundred questions psychological test yeah and
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:16.240]  if you are of high moral character they will not hire you they want people they
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:22.180]  can manipulate and they're hiring people with criminal records now just like the
[1:11:22.180 --> 1:11:29.320]  military is hiring gang members now and and also the military's hiring people
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:33.720]  with felony records now because they know that a lot of these people are
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:38.200]  going to be on the streets of America enforcing the military rule the
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:43.440]  soviet style totalitarian military rule that's already set up by communist
[1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:49.000]  Chertoff and Marcus Wolf head of the East German Stasi and Ugani Premikov
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:55.200]  head of the KGB and they've got it all set up and now they've hired this
[1:11:55.200 --> 1:12:03.120]  Bilderberger and CFR member Janet Napolitano a lesbian governor of Arizona
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:11.360]  to run it now and so she's she's date deeply embedded in a puppet of the CFR
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:17.840]  and the Bilderberger so I guess there won't be any get a change at all with
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:22.160]  her at the helm getting back into the police you know I see these reports
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:26.760]  every day one of the San Antonio Express news yesterday the headline was police
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:31.480]  stops piracy and the police just pull you over rob all ladies of cash out of
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:35.680]  their wallets grab your watches and they just do it on record and say no judge
[1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:39.280]  no jury no arrest and they just say they're gonna continue and all over the
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:43.160]  nation now police departments are just robbing people under asset for which
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:46.760]  are seizure you know they pass law saying they're not even under arrest
[1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:51.160]  to steal everything you've got and and then the people call me all our sons of
[1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:54.640]  police officer and we don't you know you know they're not all bad Alex you
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:59.480]  need to take it easy what am I supposed to do when the leadership is evil the
[1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:04.240]  leadership is corrupt I know there's a lot of good police I know but the but
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:10.240]  the system itself is corrupt and works for an illegitimate federal government
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:16.800]  and so I mean how do you explain this to people that sorry police you now work
[1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:19.960]  for the New World Order and they say well you know get rid of the police I'm
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:24.600]  not even saying that I'm saying bottom line the country's been seized it has
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:31.440]  yes and I was my police chief we watched this as I was a cop there my other
[1:13:31.440 --> 1:13:36.960]  Christian police officer friends and good moral character not just Christian
[1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:43.320]  police officer friends watched as the most evil officers the most criminal
[1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:48.360]  officers were promoted up through the ranks to chief of police and our chief
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:53.240]  of police Ruben Ortega was a murderer and got away with murder and they
[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:58.200]  promoted him up to police chief because the criminals at the top of the system
[1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:03.120]  don't want anything but criminals in control of the police agencies federal
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:08.520]  state and local in the nation and so that's why they changed the hiring
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:12.440]  practices to where they wouldn't hire anybody with a high moral character
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:16.840]  they wanted them all to be criminals and you can see that happening today
[1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:22.200]  officers stunning people to death with stun guns just because it's fun and
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:26.280]  shooting people because they want to shoot people because they make them mad
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:32.840]  and so and robbing people like you say but there are still good police officers
[1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:37.840]  out there it's just we got to be very careful when we're pulled over by these
[1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:43.760]  officers because if you let out that you're a constitutionalist they they
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:49.200]  come up and they pull you out of the car and they call for a backup and one of
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:53.000]  them will fall down and fake that you pushed him down and scream and holler
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:57.800]  and all of them will swear that you pushed them down and that's a felony
[1:14:57.800 --> 1:15:03.440]  now against you for for allegedly pushing down a police officer hitting them
[1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:08.920]  and they all swear to the same lie on the witness stand and so it's a
[1:15:08.920 --> 1:15:14.800]  satanic system today brother and we need to get back under God under second
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:20.520]  Chronicles 714 or we've had it I mean the only thing that can save us now is to
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:25.600]  ask the Lord to come back into our nation and be our God and let us get back
[1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:29.800]  under his laws his commandments and so forth that we've thrown out of this
[1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:37.240]  nation and because it's just totally corrupt and satanic today brother now
[1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:43.120]  expanding on that good cops to lend up doing traffic duty but the ones that are
[1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:46.560]  corrupt that show that they'll go along with evil they get promoted I've talked
[1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:51.080]  to former narcotics officers who say that on average 85% of the narcotics
[1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:55.240]  officers they worked with that it is standard to plant drugs on people and
[1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:59.160]  we have all the news reports confirming that so so what am I spoke I mean what
[1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:03.480]  am I supposed to say about this system you know we're just stating on record
[1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:08.360]  that it is terminally corrupt and then now we see the banking takeover and all
[1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:16.040]  the corruption I know it it's but the thing is we watch too as the most evil
[1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:22.240]  corrupt prosecutors were promoted up the criminal prosecutors were promoted up to
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:26.120]  judgeships so that you'd have criminal judges and I'm not talking about
[1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:31.320]  criminal court judges I'm talking about absolute criminals now that are judges
[1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:37.360]  in the federal system and many time in the state system so that they can
[1:16:37.360 --> 1:16:42.520]  railroad you or me or Chris Jones for example in the prison anytime they want
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:48.360]  to by lying and and making phony reports and everything and Ramos and
[1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:53.440]  Compeon they did the same thing to them because it's just absolutely under the
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:17:01.920]  hand of Satan today and we we have to rise up in great numbers brother and I
[1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:05.880]  thank you Alex for reaching great numbers of our people well Jack here's
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:09.440]  another question out and reaching other great numbers of our people because
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:13.680]  that's the only hope we have is get back under God and our Constitution our
[1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:19.160]  Republic I've seen a lot of reports lately one just a few days ago where
[1:17:19.160 --> 1:17:24.280]  they busted a bunch of state judges in one state if a child was late to class
[1:17:24.280 --> 1:17:29.920]  or shoved somebody they would they would trick the parents into signing them
[1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:33.200]  over and then they were getting payoffs from the private juvenile detention
[1:17:33.200 --> 1:17:37.120]  centers in millions of dollars in some cases when a one judge got seven
[1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:40.600]  hundred something thousand of the table they were arrested they've now pled
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:44.840]  guilty but I see this all the time I know they do that right here in Austin
[1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:51.840]  put in Florida all over Florida I mean how widespread is this with the payoffs
[1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:55.040]  to judges to put people in jail from the prisons themselves or private
[1:17:55.040 --> 1:18:00.280]  prisons and how I mean how many police would you say from your studies lie on
[1:18:00.280 --> 1:18:07.040]  the stand well sadly and now that they've switched their hiring system to
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:11.280]  where they hire nobody with high moral character almost all of them lie on the
[1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:15.720]  witness stand there is some good Christian police officers that are still
[1:18:15.720 --> 1:18:20.560]  there trying to hang on by the skin of their teeth but it's so corrupt and so
[1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:25.640]  evil that many of them are bailing out because they just can't take the corrupt
[1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:31.240]  and the evil and the the criminal system that they have to work in today so
[1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:36.480]  they're weeding out the good officers brother and good soldiers too same thing
[1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:40.600]  in the military that's why Pat Tillman was killed because he was going to come
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:45.160]  back and tell the truth about what he saw there in Afghanistan about us
[1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:51.920]  planning 30 percent 30 times now the poppy fields that the Taliban
[1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:58.200]  destroyed there and so we had to go in and kill off the Taliban and take over
[1:18:58.200 --> 1:19:04.640]  that land to replant 30 times now the poppy fields and Pat Tillman his brother
[1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:09.560]  says knew that and knew we were only there to guard the poppy fields and he
[1:19:09.560 --> 1:19:13.840]  was going to come back and take over the anti-war movement in the next few days
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:18.800]  he was shot three times in the forehead and died and we've had other soldiers
[1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:24.680]  who have made the mistake of standing up and one female from Prescott Arizona
[1:19:24.680 --> 1:19:30.160]  stood up and said she would no longer interpret for the torture chambers in
[1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:36.120]  the part of the Middle East that she was in and the next couple days she shot
[1:19:36.120 --> 1:19:41.640]  herself allegedly committed suicide with her army rifle shooting herself in the
[1:19:41.640 --> 1:19:46.400]  head which we know was not true of course but so if you stand up and tell the
[1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:52.000]  truth in law enforcement today you're in deep trouble with the evil
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:56.920]  administration and it's only intensifying all so the bankers can

[1:24:17.960 --> 1:24:22.680]  segment with officer Jack McClam I've got a few final questions for you officer
[1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:29.520]  but before we do that I met you before and interviewed you probably 100 times
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:35.320]  over the last 13 years I've been on air but we're in a film together called the
[1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:38.920]  New World Order and I think it's gonna be the first mainstream fair film I've
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:44.400]  seen it it's gonna be on an independent film channel in about four months it's
[1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:48.760]  the main selection for the a bunch of top film festivals like South by Southwest
[1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:53.840]  and getting a chance to see your office let's just say it's extremely humble
[1:24:53.840 --> 1:25:00.120]  and I just think it's very important for people to support you and your
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:05.160]  important work I know you have a lot of health problems now and seeing that in
[1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:08.480]  the film because I haven't seen you in person in years and I just know how much
[1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:13.520]  you work every day Jack so I hope people will support you my friend well it
[1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:18.160]  would be good brother because we're struggling here to reach our police and
[1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:24.800]  soldiers as fast as we can and we've always prayed for years and years 29
[1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:31.080]  years now that one day God would allow us to have two three four million dollars
[1:25:31.080 --> 1:25:35.280]  to be able to mail out to all the police and soldiers that we can get the
[1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:40.920]  names of the Army times police times Air Force times Marine times and all we
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:47.400]  can buy those lists but we've never never had anybody come forward and we'd
[1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:52.520]  love to at this time be able to do that kind of a mail-out but I we're all
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:57.760]  volunteers here and every penny comes in goes to educate our police and
[1:25:57.760 --> 1:26:00.600]  soldiers how many years have you been doing this how many years you've been
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:06.240]  doing this 29 years now and and what you operate on a budget of about $20,000 a
[1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:12.560]  year oh probably yeah I would say probably that or maybe even less you
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:17.280]  know well what you've done with operation vampire killer and you know
[1:26:17.280 --> 1:26:21.440]  police and military passing those out to people has just been innumerable but
[1:26:21.440 --> 1:26:24.920]  yes people should get your information how they should support you fire out

[1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:25.960]  Killer 2000 have gone out over the years and we kept the price down to where
[1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:31.720]  we're just barely paying paying the printer for it and we've had police
[1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:35.680]  officers call us up and say my gosh I didn't know all this was happening
[1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:40.320]  because we use the quotes of prime minister's president's supreme court
[1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:45.240]  justices and all around the world that they knew the names of and put their
[1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:49.480]  actual quotes in there about the new world order and so after they read that
[1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:55.320]  75 pages they call us or write to us and say I never knew I was up all last
[1:27:55.320 --> 1:27:59.560]  night you made me lose a whole night of sleep when I started reading that book

[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:36.520]  their minds and souls to the truth of what's developing and certainly we are
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:40.640]  not in boring times these are very interesting very dangerous very serious
[1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:45.160]  times and all that evil needs to triumph is that good men and women do
[1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:48.720]  nothing and and folks we're not kidding this is the most virulent hardcore
[1:28:48.720 --> 1:28:54.400]  vicious slimy stinking corruption that you can even imagine I study it every

[1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:09.080]  terrorist act of war against this country the enemy struck America on
[1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:14.800]  September 11th but who is the enemy? Bin Laden. We have to look to the
[1:31:14.800 --> 1:31:19.040]  Middle East we have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 911
[1:31:19.040 --> 1:31:22.440]  film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[1:31:22.440 --> 1:31:26.240]  inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there are
[1:31:26.240 --> 1:31:32.000]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:36.980]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA the

[1:34:49.640 --> 1:34:54.040]  an arco terrorist state there are tens of thousands of murders in the last year
[1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:58.600]  alone in Mexico and many of those thousands on the border rocket attacks
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:04.600]  hang grenade attacks on media outlets homes being burned of citizens from
[1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:08.960]  Texas to Arizona to California and now the mainstream media is finally
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:13.760]  reporting on it and I covered this the start of the show in tournament camps
[1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:20.080]  ready for mass illegal alien influx this is out of the El Paso times linked up
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:26.400]  on prisonplanet.com it gets into all of that saying yes Mexico the State
[1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:30.960]  Department saying may fall Homeland Security saying it this is just
[1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:34.640]  unbelievable what's going on one of the most corrupt and dangerous nations in
[1:35:34.640 --> 1:35:40.640]  the world just virulently nationalistic against the United States and the SPP
[1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:43.920]  crowd North American Union crowds that are going to use this crisis to merge
[1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:47.560]  the nations and that's now official mainstream news after all the denials
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:52.880]  Lynn Spencer it's great to have you on with us good to talk to you again it has
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:56.400]  been a little while since we had you on a lot of new developments please give us
[1:35:56.400 --> 1:36:01.720]  so your breakdown what's happening well you know Alex I moved out of California
[1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:06.160]  down here to the border about seven years ago and said about to tell the
[1:36:06.160 --> 1:36:11.000]  truth about the border to the American people we developed a new technology we
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:14.560]  developed our own unmanned aerial vehicles we were sending live video
[1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:20.240]  from that UAV out over the Internet showing what was going on and we had
[1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:24.960]  great hopes in October of 2006 when the president signed the Secure Fence Act
[1:36:24.960 --> 1:36:31.920]  which called really for over 800 miles of double layered fence to be built along
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:36.000]  the border and what happened after that was amazing I'm going to tell you how
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:40.560]  it is linked in a minute to what the war going on in Mexico I'm going to tell
[1:36:40.560 --> 1:36:46.000]  you something that nobody's heard before but after he signed that bill I knew
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:50.600]  that they weren't serious so I launched what I called operation beef if they're
[1:36:50.600 --> 1:36:55.280]  going to beef up the border we're going to we're going to ask where's the beef so
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:37:00.920]  I bought a Cessna 206 I'm a pilot I started flying the border for American
[1:37:00.920 --> 1:37:06.720]  Border Patrol in actually August of 2006 and we've been going along that border
[1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:12.400]  every two months and documenting what they're doing now in December of 2007
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:18.400]  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchett pulled a fast one and modified the Secure Fence
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:25.240]  Act giving the Department of Homeland Security total discretion over where to
[1:37:25.240 --> 1:37:30.200]  build the fence nobody knows about this because it hasn't been publicized so they
[1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:35.480]  gave turt off veto power over the fence now this original Secure Fence Act was
[1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:42.800]  passed by 67% of the House of Representatives 82% of the Senate and
[1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:47.080]  signed by the president Glenn Glenn just to back you up and interrupt here I did
[1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:51.720]  see blurbs and congressional statements but it was not highly publicized that
[1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:55.360]  turt off took over the fence and then started all this virtual fence talk and
[1:37:55.360 --> 1:37:59.240]  then had illegal aliens build a few little things that wouldn't keep anything
[1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:03.080]  going through but go ahead well we started documenting this and blowing the
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:07.720]  whistle on what was going on and the heat got on them a little bit because I
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:12.520]  put out a video that shows that they were our information was getting out
[1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:17.160]  here even though the blackout on what we do so they started building the fence and
[1:38:17.160 --> 1:38:23.280]  in the middle of last year I think turt off got religion and started putting up
[1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:27.240]  some serious fence most of what they put up their calling a fence is what they
[1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:31.400]  call a vehicle barrier you could either walk through it or step over it and the
[1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:35.560]  usually little ramps trucks can drive right over it so it really isn't a
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:40.360]  barrier there's a lot of lying going on but we found something out they have
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:44.960]  about five hundred and twenty six miles of combination of fence and vehicle
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:51.160]  barrier along the border now it turns out where they really got serious was
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:57.080]  along the goldwater bombing range in Texas and they built about 50 miles of
[1:38:57.080 --> 1:39:04.520]  actual fence and we flew this bombing range actually I got a figured out a
[1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:08.240]  way to fly along this bombing range which is right on the Mexican border for
[1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:12.360]  50 miles you can't fly over it because the top of the bombing range restricted
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:17.560]  area is 80,000 feet so I had to figure out a way how am I going to get some
[1:39:17.560 --> 1:39:22.880]  video of the border and that bombing range where it meets Mexico I got
[1:39:22.880 --> 1:39:28.800]  permission from the FAA to launch out of here in eastern Arizona and fly along
[1:39:28.800 --> 1:39:34.560]  the border in Mexico right along the border and they gave me a radar code and
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:40.320]  everything as long as I landed in the Yuma and checked in with the
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:45.880]  Customs and Border Protection so guess what we started flying along the border
[1:39:45.880 --> 1:39:53.320]  a couple years ago in Mexico videotaping that border you couldn't believe what we
[1:39:53.320 --> 1:40:00.720]  saw I am telling you there is Mexican Highway 2 runs 700 feet south of the
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:08.720]  border parallels the border okay thousands of tire the vehicle two tracks
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:16.120]  coming right off of Mexican Highway 2 driving right onto the bombing range
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:22.000]  there was no fence it was documented all of this in high definition video there
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:28.080]  was no fence there was no trespassing signs that's where all the drugs were
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:35.240]  coming through right across the bombing range and our government knew it so what
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:41.520]  happened was we really put the pressure on a week I with the information got out
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:47.760]  and it suddenly turned off put this fence up and some other places that you
[1:40:47.760 --> 1:40:51.160]  know especially between Yuma and Calexico out in the desert which we were
[1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:55.640]  blowing the whistle on where there were running drugs through there well I'm
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:40:59.880]  going to tell you something I'm going to tell you why there's a drug war going
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:09.880]  on in Mexico because we blocked off some of their major corridors now you can go
[1:41:09.880 --> 1:41:14.520]  on American Patrol dot com and I you can see a chart back there we drew a
[1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:19.760]  chart we're the only ones who know how much fence was put in in each year we
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:23.480]  only know the people in the world were flying the border watching what they
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:31.480]  were doing and you can draw a chart as they added a fence the drug killings in
[1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:37.320]  Mexico go up there's a perfect parallel that charts right along what was what
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:44.360]  is going on is as we began to choke off those corridors there were fewer
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:50.840]  places left and they started fighting over it that's what caused the drug war
[1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:56.000]  in Mexico I mean I certainly think it's safe to say it's added to all of it but
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:00.080]  also the funny election when you look at the social pressures you look at the
[1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:05.000]  other evidence you take take that same chart we started with a hundred miles of
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:11.760]  border fence and barriers in 2005 a hundred miles by the end of 2008 we had
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:19.440]  almost 550 miles they had a hundred drug killings in Mexico in 2005 right go up
[1:42:19.440 --> 1:42:24.560]  to 2008 they had over 5,000 it's actually it's actually over 10,000
[1:42:24.560 --> 1:42:28.400]  the numbers I've seen now well I mean the numbers that I have from the
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:33.080]  border patrol the retired border patrols is 5,500 something like that but it may
[1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:37.520]  be over 10,000 yeah they always use old numbers but yes it was it was 10
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:41.520]  months in the last year it was 8,400 and then and then I saw thousands
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:47.520]  now regardless of what you know that jumps up and down the fence also in 2005
[1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:54.040]  they eradicated something like 2 million some odd thousand marijuana plants
[1:42:54.040 --> 1:43:00.000]  north of the border by 2008 it was over 6 million so what they're they're getting
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:04.400]  desperate they're trying to grow this stuff north of the border they're flying
[1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:09.800]  ultralight over the over the fence and crash when I crashed over by human
[1:43:09.800 --> 1:43:14.120]  killed them they're flying ultralight they're trying to dig tunnels but forget
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:16.920]  about tunnels let me tell you something I know the border better than anybody
[1:43:16.920 --> 1:43:22.080]  they can't dig tunnels there's no place for it to emerge to pop out in the U.S.
[1:43:22.080 --> 1:43:26.560]  side between El Paso and don't ever try to dig a tunnel under the Rio Grande
[1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:33.440]  River you'll die between El Paso and the San Diego coast there are probably 100
[1:43:33.440 --> 1:43:36.840]  places where you could have a tunnel pop up on the U.S. well they find them all
[1:43:36.840 --> 1:43:44.360]  the time they found 17 last year they found 17 it forget about tunnels you
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:48.480]  cannot yeah they got them in the gallows we know where they find them if the
[1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:52.400]  places are so limited where they can do that that's why they're getting so
[1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:57.160]  desperate all right let's stop the fence works I understand exactly we need to
[1:43:57.160 --> 1:44:01.720]  build a complete fence but expanding on that the overview of Mexico
[1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:06.320]  destabilized the United States destabilized is it true that the
[1:44:06.320 --> 1:44:10.440]  illegal aliens are going home and mass I've seen some evidence of that but but
[1:44:10.440 --> 1:44:15.400]  not that much I was about to add there is there is some anecdotal evidence we
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:19.440]  don't see it they're still trying to get in they could they caught a group of
[1:44:19.440 --> 1:44:24.360]  70 a couple of days ago about five miles from where I'm sitting they're
[1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:28.360]  coming through we have a 40 mile fence along the border where I am right now
[1:44:28.360 --> 1:44:34.440]  there is a a quarter mile gap in it where the river is that's my man run my
[1:44:34.440 --> 1:44:38.760]  ranch is I'm looking at it right now we're building a tower right near right
[1:44:38.760 --> 1:44:42.240]  there we should have it finished by Monday with a tower we're building a
[1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:45.520]  tower to put a thermal camera and look right down in that river to shut these
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:48.680]  people up because we're getting hundreds come through every night they're
[1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:52.640]  still coming through they're still coming through well that's the question I
[1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:58.800]  wanted to ask you have you seen the El Paso times talking about Mexico
[1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:06.080]  collapsing and millions more flooding across I saw that I saw it but I want
[1:45:06.080 --> 1:45:11.840]  to tell you something I don't trust Rick Perry he's the governor of pair of the
[1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:17.000]  Texas it's all talking but he came out a couple of years ago dead set against the
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:21.920]  border fence he was dead set against ending the practice of ending anchor
[1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:29.200]  babies okay he's all for this NAFTA highway he talks immigration enforcement
[1:45:29.200 --> 1:45:32.560]  only but only those who have committed other crimes now he's a belterburg
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:36.360]  group globalist he's horrible absolutely so what if when he starts talking about
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:40.200]  oh we're gonna get ready for a thrust across the border he's gonna probably
[1:45:40.200 --> 1:45:47.960]  love it but don't trust that guy and I know that I know that they're using it
[1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:51.840]  as a cover according to Rex 84 to build federal detention camps for the American
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:55.240]  people in Glenn that's now introduced in Congress and in the mainstream news they
[1:45:55.240 --> 1:45:59.040]  have built camps for the American people they're probably gonna spot it there
[1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:03.480]  for me well let me ask you this a what's going on with the camps Northcom and
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:09.120]  your expert analysis and be what is on the Obama agenda because the SPP has
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:12.800]  said as you know they want to use border crises as a way to just legalize
[1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:15.560]  everybody to say oh we've got a document everybody
[1:46:15.560 --> 1:46:21.040]  oh absolutely but what's going on right now is with this bailout program okay
[1:46:21.040 --> 1:46:26.800]  this is a great paper over the illegal immigration problem they are going to
[1:46:26.800 --> 1:46:31.480]  send billions of dollars I mean tens of billions of dollars especially to
[1:46:31.480 --> 1:46:35.760]  California and I have this on my website American Patrol comm and I've been
[1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:40.440]  warning about this because California is bankrupt illegal immigration has
[1:46:40.440 --> 1:46:45.920]  bankrupted California it is it can't even pay its people it's laying its civil
[1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:50.520]  servants off people they say they have to you know what that they just got a
[1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:54.560]  federal panel of federal judges told them they have to reduce their prison
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:46:59.200]  size by 40 percent they have to send almost 60,000 criminals out into the
[1:46:59.200 --> 1:47:03.800]  street now for those that don't know in Texas and California it is tens of
[1:47:03.800 --> 1:47:07.440]  billions of dollars conservatively over the years even more for the states to
[1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:12.640]  pay for the free health care the illegal aliens with the babies the housing
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:16.960]  the multiple identities and the welfare so people would say this is
[1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:21.080]  contributing it's the opposite it's bankrupting the states go ahead this is
[1:47:21.080 --> 1:47:25.640]  why California is bankrupt but you have to understand what just happened they're
[1:47:25.640 --> 1:47:28.440]  debating this whole thing back in Congress and that's what the whole
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:32.360]  issue was over it's an illegal immigration but now guess what the
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:38.120]  governor that the mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villarigosa okay he is a
[1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:42.440]  reconquista of the highest order he's here to turn California over to Mexico
[1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:47.000]  he has contacted the Obama administration and told them to send any
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:53.520]  stimulus money directly to him this is it this is it the hill the newspaper the
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:48:00.080]  hill yeah Bloomberg's reporting two billion bucks to go to move on and acorn
[1:48:00.080 --> 1:48:03.560]  and others so they're just gonna take all these people you know this this is
[1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:08.280]  that this is the Saul Olinski group and all these are this is where these people
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:12.360]  come from these are open borders Saul Olinski who who who wrote the forward to
[1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:18.400]  his book thanking Satan Lucifer yeah so you what you're seeing the struggle
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:24.040]  it going on even as we speak right now billions and billions of dollars are
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:28.080]  gonna be coming out to bail out these illegal alien states because it's
[1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:32.760]  remember California is bankrupt sending 60,000 people out of the prisons
[1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:36.720]  of illegal aliens meanwhile nursing homes are evicting the elderly we have
[1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:42.360]  a story on info wars.com absolutely because these people are going but now Obama
[1:48:42.360 --> 1:48:47.320]  cannot afford this to happen because eventually they're going to people are
[1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:50.680]  gonna coming that's why they were not he cannot allow that well they knew this
[1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:57.960]  bankruptcy was coming that's why they were racing to get total amnesty two
[1:48:57.960 --> 1:49:04.560]  years ago but failed I warned about this 16 years ago I said we were importing
[1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:10.280]  poverty I coined that phrase in California 16 years ago I knew this was
[1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:17.680]  gonna happen that they are importing but that state is finished and now Obama
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:23.640]  knows it and again all these mainline liberals all these mainline liberals you
[1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:26.360]  know we're not even against the poor Mexican people we know their death
[1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:30.040]  situation the point is you take hundreds of millions of third world people from
[1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:33.360]  all the planet mainly Mexico being 80 plus percent of the illegal aliens you
[1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:37.280]  take 30 million of them in here it will bankrupt things and so all these

[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:18.480]  the paycheck yeah finished today that's why it's so desperate to get the
[1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:22.000]  Congress to bail them out and that's what the struggle is over this Senate
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:26.200]  versus House version and the Congress is gonna loot the American people of their
[1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:29.120]  tax money regardless of what color they are of course they are but the
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:34.320]  doesn't this is a heavy to do with race this has to do with legality yes the
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:38.520]  people of California voted proposition 187 to stop this nonsense but the
[1:50:38.520 --> 1:50:42.200]  gray Davis came in and killed the thing with the president of Mexico now now
[1:50:42.200 --> 1:50:46.200]  I mean I remember 10 years ago you made films about this you predicted first the
[1:50:46.200 --> 1:50:52.840]  collapse then the racial rioting we come back I was just reading a book about
[1:50:52.840 --> 1:50:55.760]  World War one the other day or section about World War one about what Mexico

[1:52:11.920 --> 1:52:15.920]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was the state? Was it engineered by you?
[1:52:15.920 --> 1:52:22.920]  Even Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.F.R. The data we stop asking questions
[1:52:22.920 --> 1:52:27.920]  is the data that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door
[1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:33.920]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place
[1:52:33.920 --> 1:52:39.920]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:43.920]  If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself

[1:53:08.920 --> 1:53:13.920]  The market of beast is at hand, governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system
[1:53:13.920 --> 1:53:16.920]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope

[1:53:56.920 --> 1:54:06.920]  A long-term food solution
[1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:27.920]  All right, big government by design is bankrupt things
[1:54:27.920 --> 1:54:31.920]  They want to bring in total federal control under international agreements
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:34.920]  Our guest is Glenn Spencer
[1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:39.920]  Glenn, you predicted all of this in articles and films you made with stunning accuracy
[1:54:39.920 --> 1:54:46.920]  You also predicted that it's going to boil down into riots and open warfare
[1:54:46.920 --> 1:54:49.920]  Are you still saying that? And when do you see that unfolding?
[1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:55.920]  This is what they're so frightened of in Los Angeles
[1:54:55.920 --> 1:55:00.920]  This is why Obama's people are going to do everything they can to bail out the city and the state
[1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:05.920]  Just imagine this, that this state, they cannot pay the tax refunds
[1:55:05.920 --> 1:55:07.920]  People had money coming back, they can't pay it
[1:55:07.920 --> 1:55:10.920]  They were supposed to get it this week, they can't get it
[1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:13.920]  They had to shut down all of their construction jobs
[1:55:13.920 --> 1:55:17.920]  They can't do anything, the state is broke, it has no money
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:21.920]  It has no money, they're getting 60,000 criminals out of the prisons
[1:55:21.920 --> 1:55:24.920]  I mean this is here today, right now in the United States
[1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:27.920]  California is bankrupt, I predicted it
[1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:32.920]  Now I didn't predict the drug war in Mexico, things come out differently than you think
[1:55:32.920 --> 1:55:34.920]  You never know what's going to happen
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:41.920]  But that could be the premise upon which, yes, a flood of people, if the Mexican government falls
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:43.920]  And there's a possibility of that
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:49.920]  Then you could have massive unrest and applications for asylum
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:51.920]  And guess who would let them in?
[1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:54.920]  Well that's what Rick Perry is saying, they're going to let people in as asylum seekers
[1:55:54.920 --> 1:55:56.920]  That's correct
[1:55:56.920 --> 1:56:02.920]  This is the guys under which they're going to let in millions of Mexicans to take over the Southwest
[1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:09.920]  Well that's what the SPP, the North American Union group, said they're going to use crises to create a continuous border
[1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:11.920]  But we're right there
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:14.920]  We're right there
[1:56:14.920 --> 1:56:17.920]  Today
[1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:21.920]  And they're just hoping to do all this by fiat and not make a political issue out of it
[1:56:21.920 --> 1:56:26.920]  I didn't predict the Mexican drug wars, but I see how it happened
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:28.920]  Well it's more than drug war, Glenn
[1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:34.920]  You've got crime exploding, I talk to people now that go to Mexican resorts
[1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:40.920]  And the federales come in at 1001 after the pool closes and arrest them and steal everything from them
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:47.920]  This is a nation that was built, the whole culture
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:54.920]  They call it, there's a term for it
[1:56:54.920 --> 1:56:56.920]  Mordito
[1:56:56.920 --> 1:56:58.920]  Everything is bribery
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:56:59.920]  Little bite
[1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:01.920]  That's correct
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:06.920]  But I could go on in depth on that, the whole cultural thing
[1:57:06.920 --> 1:57:08.920]  This thing is coming apart
[1:57:08.920 --> 1:57:12.920]  There is no foundation there, there is no cultural strength
[1:57:12.920 --> 1:57:16.920]  Yes, in a sense there is, because once a Mexican, always a Mexican
[1:57:16.920 --> 1:57:20.920]  The Mexicans are unified in that sense, they're very nationalistic
[1:57:20.920 --> 1:57:27.920]  However, they will look for any reason and any excuse to move across that border
[1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:32.920]  And because they want to take the Southwest back
[1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:36.920]  Any way you slice it, we are headed into insane times
[1:57:36.920 --> 1:57:38.920]  Oh absolutely
[1:57:38.920 --> 1:57:41.920]  Because when California collapses
[1:57:41.920 --> 1:57:46.920]  You have unemployment there probably over 15% in reality
[1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:51.920]  People are starving, they're starving beginning to look, trying to find food out there
[1:57:51.920 --> 1:57:57.920]  And especially when you have let's say 4 million illegal aliens who can't work
[1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:01.920]  Who have nothing, things are going to get very ugly
[1:58:01.920 --> 1:58:03.920]  And that's 4 million in California alone
[1:58:03.920 --> 1:58:05.920]  That's correct
[1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:10.920]  4 million people who technically have no rights to any welfare benefit
[1:58:10.920 --> 1:58:17.920]  Well, I'm seeing reports in the mainstream news that Mexican style kidnapping is beginning
[1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:19.920]  Absolutely
[1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:24.920]  That's going on in our, this was in the Associated Press yesterday
[1:58:24.920 --> 1:58:29.920]  This was a major news yesterday that the drug war, okay
[1:58:29.920 --> 1:58:33.920]  Murder and mayhem, drug, Mexican drug violence spills over into the U.S.
[1:58:33.920 --> 1:58:38.920]  Stay there, we've got Officer Sheriff Richard Matt coming on
[1:58:38.920 --> 1:58:40.920]  But I want you to be able to finish up

[1:59:58.920 --> 1:59:59.920]  Work
[2:00:05.920 --> 2:00:09.920]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups
[2:00:09.920 --> 2:00:11.920]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.920 --> 2:00:16.920]  Well so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network

[2:00:21.920 --> 2:00:28.920]  We are live now into the third hour of the fourth hour coming up as well
[2:00:28.920 --> 2:00:31.920]  We're not just doing the radio show right now, in the last two hours every day
[2:00:31.920 --> 2:00:37.920]  We simulcast live at PrisonPlanet.tv on the full studio with the documents, the video clips
[2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:41.920]  Putting the articles up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv members
[2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:46.920]  Finishing up with Glenn Spencer of American Border Patrol
[2:00:46.920 --> 2:00:51.920]  Who is one of the most prominent and tireless, focused people
[2:00:51.920 --> 2:00:56.920]  Exposing the crisis with our third world nation that is bordering our south
[2:00:56.920 --> 2:01:02.920]  That is now falling apart in on itself with just carnage and murder in Mayhem
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:07.920]  And now mass kidnappings, there have been a lot of cases where drug smugglers will take 40-plus people
[2:01:07.920 --> 2:01:12.920]  Kidnap them out of Arizona or Texas, the police have to raid it and get killed
[2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:17.920]  I mean, it's getting bad and now the State Department's admitting there's kidnappings all over the U.S.
[2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:21.920]  Of Americans down to Mexico, they're not just kidnapping Americans when they go to Mexico
[2:01:21.920 --> 2:01:23.920]  The police are sucking money out of the family
[2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:26.920]  Then in a minute or two we're going to go to Sheriff Richard Mack for the next 30 minutes
[2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:29.920]  Then we have a state representative joining us with all these states
[2:01:29.920 --> 2:01:35.920]  It's now 10, and as you heard Jack McClam earlier, 20 more moving to declare sovereignty against the feds
[2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:38.920]  And all their globalist orders
[2:01:38.920 --> 2:01:42.920]  But finishing up with that in your website, Glenn Spencer
[2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:49.920]  Well, yeah, we were talking about the fact that we have major crimes in our cities
[2:01:49.920 --> 2:01:54.920]  That are being committed by these drug gangs
[2:01:54.920 --> 2:02:04.920]  Here was the AP report, U.S. authorities are reporting a spike in killings, kidnappings, and home invasions connected to Mexico's murderous cartels
[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:06.920]  Right in our cities
[2:02:06.920 --> 2:02:15.920]  Now, we've got 40% of the population of the prisons of California are in one way or another linked to illegal immigration
[2:02:15.920 --> 2:02:22.920]  Now they're going to let, I mean, now they're saying you've got to let go 40% of the population
[2:02:22.920 --> 2:02:27.920]  You have illegal aliens convicted of serious crimes
[2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:36.920]  During this unrest in California, they're going to release 60,000 of these people into the community
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:45.920]  Which will then cause huge crime rates to even spike more than the feds bring in more federalization of police and funding to control the general population
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:46.920]  Absolutely
[2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:48.920]  So they know exactly what they're doing
[2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:51.920]  Glenn Spencer, I want to get you back on the next few weeks for part two of this interview
[2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:54.920]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, fire out the websites
[2:02:54.920 --> 2:02:57.920]  American Patrol dot com
[2:02:57.920 --> 2:02:59.920]  American Patrol dot com
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:02.920]  I got 151 people online right now
[2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:05.920]  All right, thank you so much for joining us. Take care, my friend
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:06.920]  Thanks a lot
[2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:09.920]  All right, folks
[2:03:09.920 --> 2:03:14.920]  The next 30 minutes were joined by Sheriff Richard Mack
[2:03:14.920 --> 2:03:20.920]  For those that don't know who he is, former sheriff in Graham County, Arizona, in longtime pursuit of freedom, individual rights
[2:03:20.920 --> 2:03:24.920]  Right now, it is vital that they restore the constitution of supreme law of the land
[2:03:24.920 --> 2:03:26.920]  The greatest threat we face today is not terrorist
[2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:31.920]  It is our own federal government of America has conquered or ruined it will be from within, not a foreign enemy
[2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:33.920]  That's his quote
[2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:37.920]  And you can go to his website, Sheriff Mack dot com
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:42.920]  He of course brought a case to the supreme court for the second amendment on 10th amendment grounds, states rights and won
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:45.920]  And we are very, very thankful to have him on with his perspective
[2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:49.920]  As everything we talked about now has come true, world government upon us
[2:03:49.920 --> 2:03:51.920]  We're about to break, but I want to introduce you now
[2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:53.920]  Sheriff Mack, great to have you on with us
[2:03:53.920 --> 2:03:58.920]  Well, Alex, it's so good to be back with you. It's been a while and I've been following what you've been doing
[2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:02.920]  And I really thank you for having me back on with you. It's a great pleasure
[2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:04.920]  Well, I want to thank you for joining us
[2:04:04.920 --> 2:04:09.920]  Every major newspaper is announcing world governments the answer to the economic crisis
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:13.920]  World government run by the very same central banks that are now engineering the crisis
[2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:24.920]  Well, it is, and just, I mean, just like you're talking about the immigration problem, the global governance problem
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:32.920]  Where can we go? Where can we go for help? Washington D.C., your senator, your congressman, all that's a joke
[2:04:32.920 --> 2:04:43.920]  Richard Max, our guest, will be back after this short three-minute break and break down the state of the Union according to this great patriot
[2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:48.920]  And his advice to police and military out there who are being asked more and more
[2:04:48.920 --> 2:04:54.920]  The violet will arise the constitution and aid the foreign banksters in their takeover of our once great republic
[2:04:54.920 --> 2:04:56.920]  Stay with us
[2:04:56.920 --> 2:05:06.920]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment
[2:05:06.920 --> 2:05:11.920]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise
[2:05:11.920 --> 2:05:17.920]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease
[2:05:17.920 --> 2:05:23.920]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight
[2:05:23.920 --> 2:05:29.920]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic
[2:05:29.920 --> 2:05:33.920]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment
[2:05:33.920 --> 2:05:38.920]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it
[2:05:38.920 --> 2:05:41.920]  Do your part, alkalize and supercharge your body now
[2:05:41.920 --> 2:05:51.920]  Alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops

[2:08:24.920 --> 2:08:28.920]  We are back alive with Sheriff Richard Mack
[2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:31.920]  We had more lawmen like him in this country
[2:08:31.920 --> 2:08:34.920]  More defenders of liberty, more servants
[2:08:34.920 --> 2:08:37.920]  Through servants is how great work is done
[2:08:37.920 --> 2:08:40.920]  True heroes that we wouldn't be in the situation we're in today
[2:08:40.920 --> 2:08:42.920]  Sheriff Richard Mack, in the time we've got
[2:08:42.920 --> 2:08:45.920]  I want to be back up soon for a full hour
[2:08:45.920 --> 2:08:49.920]  Going back to what I first said, I want you to speak to this
[2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:52.920]  They're in the Time magazine saying we're all socialists now
[2:08:52.920 --> 2:08:55.920]  Time magazine has the headline New World Order
[2:08:55.920 --> 2:08:58.920]  They say a new global bank to run the United States
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:00.920]  To control the entire world that we pay taxes to
[2:09:00.920 --> 2:09:02.920]  This is what we always said the international bankers were planning
[2:09:02.920 --> 2:09:04.920]  Because their own documents said it
[2:09:04.920 --> 2:09:07.920]  Why are they now coming right out in the open with this?
[2:09:07.920 --> 2:09:09.920]  Why are they pushing this?
[2:09:09.920 --> 2:09:13.920]  And what does this mean to you that they're finally not lying about it anymore?
[2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:15.920]  The FBI training manual will say you're a terrorist
[2:09:15.920 --> 2:09:18.920]  If you talk about a New World Order and it doesn't exist
[2:09:18.920 --> 2:09:21.920]  Now they're admitting it exists but saying it's good
[2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:26.920]  Well I've written about Time magazine
[2:09:26.920 --> 2:09:29.920]  Has talked about the New World Order quite a bit
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:34.920]  I did an article about I think it was an issue of 1995
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:37.920]  Where Time magazine said it had an article
[2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:39.920]  Who should keep the keys?
[2:09:39.920 --> 2:09:42.920]  And it talked about Henry Kissinger saying that we need to compromise
[2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:47.920]  American idealism in order to fit into today's global society
[2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:50.920]  This isn't that new and you and I both know that
[2:09:50.920 --> 2:09:54.920]  But I think now is the time for them to make their play
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:58.920]  They're obviously not hiding it anymore
[2:09:58.920 --> 2:10:03.920]  They've got New World Order boys in there that have been pushing this
[2:10:03.920 --> 2:10:10.920]  Ever since the first George Bush obviously was pushing for this
[2:10:10.920 --> 2:10:12.920]  He talked about the New World Order all the time
[2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:16.920]  Bill Clinton talked about the New World Order all the time
[2:10:16.920 --> 2:10:22.920]  George Jr. didn't say the words as nearly as much as his dad did
[2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:25.920]  But he was certainly pushing for this
[2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:29.920]  They're giving all our money to the banksters
[2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:33.920]  The banksters own America, the banks own our currency
[2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:36.920]  And that's why people like you and I have said all along
[2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:39.920]  That you better have gold and silver and food storage
[2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:42.920]  And you better be able to protect yourselves and your family
[2:10:42.920 --> 2:10:47.920]  And so along with your food storage you need guns and ammo
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:51.920]  These things we've been preaching since we've been on the air
[2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:54.920]  And since we've been involved in the freedom movement
[2:10:54.920 --> 2:10:59.920]  Myself for the last 15 years, maybe a little bit longer
[2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:02.920]  Why there's being so blatant about it right now
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:06.920]  I don't know but the monster is knocking on the door
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:08.920]  And we better be ready for it
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:12.920]  And there's nobody protecting us in Washington DC
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:14.920]  Ron Paul would probably be the only one
[2:11:14.920 --> 2:11:18.920]  But he's basically ineffective because he's all by himself
[2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:20.920]  You know, just like I said before the break
[2:11:20.920 --> 2:11:23.920]  If you think you're going to call your congressman
[2:11:23.920 --> 2:11:25.920]  I get all these emails all the time
[2:11:25.920 --> 2:11:27.920]  Call your congressman, call your senator
[2:11:27.920 --> 2:11:30.920]  And ask him not to do this bill or whatever
[2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:32.920]  Those are all jokes, Alex
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:37.920]  I do not waste my time trying to call my congressman or senator anymore
[2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:39.920]  Those guys are bought and paid for
[2:11:39.920 --> 2:11:41.920]  They're going to do what they're going to do
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:44.920]  They do not care about you, they do not care about their constituents
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:48.920]  And there is one person who I believe can stop this new world order
[2:11:48.920 --> 2:11:52.920]  His name is your county sheriff
[2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:55.920]  And that's why I've written the new book
[2:11:55.920 --> 2:11:58.920]  The County Sheriff America's Last Hope
[2:11:58.920 --> 2:12:01.920]  It details the documentation
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:04.920]  There is no question that your sheriff
[2:12:04.920 --> 2:12:08.920]  Has the responsibility to protect you from tyranny
[2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:10.920]  And that's why the feds...
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:12.920]  That's why the feds have been moving
[2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:14.920]  And in many states to abolish the sheriff
[2:12:14.920 --> 2:12:16.920]  Or make it be appointed by the city
[2:12:16.920 --> 2:12:18.920]  When it's the county chartered by the state
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:22.920]  And he is the most powerful elected representative in the county
[2:12:22.920 --> 2:12:26.920]  Literally he can call up a posse, the local draft
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:28.920]  It's totally constitutional
[2:12:28.920 --> 2:12:31.920]  Instead they've tried to shut down the sheriff, demonize it
[2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:33.920]  Or run feds and new world order people
[2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:35.920]  For the position, so they've been attacking it
[2:12:35.920 --> 2:12:37.920]  From every angle, weakening it, getting rid of it
[2:12:37.920 --> 2:12:39.920]  Making it appointed, not elected
[2:12:39.920 --> 2:12:42.920]  I think the best way to start here is...
[2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:44.920]  You're right, they've already stopped
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:46.920]  They've already done away with the sheriff in Connecticut
[2:12:46.920 --> 2:12:49.920]  And you were talking about the immigration problem
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:52.920]  Not the immigration problem, but the illegal immigration problem
[2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:56.920]  Sheriff George Pyle, who has endorsed my book by the way
[2:12:56.920 --> 2:12:58.920]  He's on the back of the book
[2:12:58.920 --> 2:13:02.920]  He believes in all of this about the autonomy of the sheriff
[2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:04.920]  Look what he has done
[2:13:04.920 --> 2:13:08.920]  He has been, I guess, the only sheriff in this country
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:11.920]  To round up illegals and arrest them
[2:13:11.920 --> 2:13:14.920]  And put them in jail
[2:13:14.920 --> 2:13:17.920]  And he's having the feds come and get them
[2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:20.920]  As soon as they can and say, look, I'm doing your job here
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:22.920]  Come and get them and send them back
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:26.920]  This is an amazing example of your sheriff
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:30.920]  Have you noticed that nobody can get in his way
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:33.920]  He even had the city of Mesa
[2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:35.920]  Where he was doing some raids there
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:38.920]  And he actually went into the city of Mesa building
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:42.920]  And arrested some illegal aliens in the city complex
[2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:45.920]  And the chief of police got real mad
[2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:48.920]  And was spouting off on the news about
[2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:52.920]  Sheriff Arpaio should be coordinating such an effort with him
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:55.920]  And then they interview Arpaio, of course
[2:13:55.920 --> 2:13:57.920]  And you know what he said
[2:13:57.920 --> 2:14:01.920]  At the time I looked, Mesa is within the jurisdiction of Maricopa County
[2:14:01.920 --> 2:14:03.920]  He says, I don't have to ask anybody's permission
[2:14:03.920 --> 2:14:06.920]  And that's the point I make in the book
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:08.920]  Your sheriff is not a bureaucrat
[2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:11.920]  He does not answer to anyone except the people
[2:14:11.920 --> 2:14:15.920]  And he's bound by oath to uphold and defend the Constitution
[2:14:15.920 --> 2:14:18.920]  And therefore he can protect you from the IRS
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:22.920]  He can protect you and your money, your property
[2:14:22.920 --> 2:14:24.920]  Your welfare, your children
[2:14:24.920 --> 2:14:28.920]  He is the only answer left
[2:14:28.920 --> 2:14:32.920]  The county sheriff America's last hope
[2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:34.920]  Well, I think at the county level
[2:14:34.920 --> 2:14:36.920]  There's also juries, grand juries
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:38.920]  That form of voting for the people's and other hope
[2:14:38.920 --> 2:14:41.920]  And we now have 10 states and 20 others
[2:14:41.920 --> 2:14:44.920]  Now saying they may sign on to declare sovereignty
[2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:47.920]  And in the bills, I've been reading the last few days on air
[2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:49.920]  We've had some state reps on it states
[2:14:49.920 --> 2:14:50.920]  We will not have martial law
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:52.920]  We will not have gun confiscation
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:55.920]  We will not have forced compulsory service
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:14:57.920]  And they list what the feds are doing
[2:14:57.920 --> 2:14:59.920]  And so the state is the answer
[2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:02.920]  And enshrined in that, the smallest unit of that
[2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:04.920]  Is the sheriff
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:06.920]  And you're right, I've seen cases all over the country
[2:15:06.920 --> 2:15:09.920]  Where they're trying to come repossess people's homes
[2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:11.920]  And the sheriff's saying no
[2:15:11.920 --> 2:15:14.920]  So that's why they tried to move to block the sheriff
[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:16.920]  And basically federalize the states
[2:15:16.920 --> 2:15:18.920]  Because originally in how our country's set up
[2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:21.920]  It is the state that is the true unit of power
[2:15:21.920 --> 2:15:23.920]  It is, and you know, and the county
[2:15:23.920 --> 2:15:25.920]  Even more powerful than that, I do believe
[2:15:25.920 --> 2:15:28.920]  And in the book, you'll see the documentation
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:31.920]  From my lawsuit that you mentioned when you introduced me
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:34.920]  The lawsuit is key to all of this
[2:15:34.920 --> 2:15:40.920]  Because it establishes the constitutional premise
[2:15:40.920 --> 2:15:42.920]  For the sheriff to have this power
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:45.920]  And it's backed up by a recent Supreme Court ruling
[2:15:45.920 --> 2:15:48.920]  Which came out in June of 1997
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:51.920]  This has not been rescinded, it's law
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:56.920]  And Justice Scalia details quite clearly
[2:15:56.920 --> 2:15:59.920]  That the federal government has no power
[2:15:59.920 --> 2:16:02.920]  Over the county or the county sheriff
[2:16:02.920 --> 2:16:04.920]  Or the state employees
[2:16:04.920 --> 2:16:06.920]  Instead though under Obama
[2:16:06.920 --> 2:16:08.920]  They're trying to federalize everything
[2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:10.920]  They're building FEMA camps
[2:16:10.920 --> 2:16:12.920]  Where the local sheriff offices out of it
[2:16:12.920 --> 2:16:14.920]  With the military, with the police
[2:16:14.920 --> 2:16:16.920]  And with clergy response teams
[2:16:16.920 --> 2:16:20.920]  Well, yes, you know, those are happening
[2:16:20.920 --> 2:16:24.920]  Or it appears, I haven't seen any here in Arizona yet
[2:16:24.920 --> 2:16:26.920]  But it doesn't matter where they're going up
[2:16:26.920 --> 2:16:28.920]  If they're going up one place
[2:16:28.920 --> 2:16:30.920]  They're going to be going up in others
[2:16:30.920 --> 2:16:33.920]  I maintain even when I was sheriff
[2:16:33.920 --> 2:16:36.920]  And I maintain even now
[2:16:36.920 --> 2:16:39.920]  That the sheriff can tell FEMA to stay out of his county
[2:16:39.920 --> 2:16:41.920]  We can make our own preparations
[2:16:41.920 --> 2:16:43.920]  And the typical example of this
[2:16:43.920 --> 2:16:45.920]  Is the failure of the federal government
[2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:48.920]  Especially during Hurricane Katrina
[2:16:48.920 --> 2:16:49.920]  To really help people
[2:16:49.920 --> 2:16:51.920]  And people have their hands out
[2:16:51.920 --> 2:16:53.920]  And expect the federal government
[2:16:53.920 --> 2:16:54.920]  To come take care of you
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:16:56.920]  Don't expect it, don't count on it
[2:16:56.920 --> 2:16:58.920]  And don't even want it
[2:16:58.920 --> 2:16:59.920]  Well, FEMA, as you know
[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:00.920]  You can make your own preparations
[2:17:00.920 --> 2:17:01.920]  At the county level
[2:17:01.920 --> 2:17:04.920]  And just look what they did also at Katrina
[2:17:04.920 --> 2:17:07.920]  They started taking everybody's guns away from them
[2:17:07.920 --> 2:17:09.920]  That's what I was going to say is
[2:17:09.920 --> 2:17:10.920]  Finally, the parish sheriff
[2:17:10.920 --> 2:17:12.920]  Not a county of parish there
[2:17:12.920 --> 2:17:14.920]  Had to go stop FEMA from cutting
[2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:16.920]  The police communication lines
[2:17:16.920 --> 2:17:18.920]  Because they wanted total federal control
[2:17:18.920 --> 2:17:19.920]  Of course
[2:17:19.920 --> 2:17:20.920]  And they're going to
[2:17:20.920 --> 2:17:22.920]  And if we continue to allow it
[2:17:22.920 --> 2:17:25.920]  If we have sheriffs who are aware of their duty
[2:17:25.920 --> 2:17:28.920]  Then this is going to continue to happen
[2:17:28.920 --> 2:17:31.920]  I mean, you can look at the problems that happen
[2:17:31.920 --> 2:17:34.920]  When sheriffs relinquished at Ruby Ridge
[2:17:34.920 --> 2:17:35.920]  At Waco
[2:17:35.920 --> 2:17:40.920]  At New Hampshire with Elaine
[2:17:40.920 --> 2:17:41.920]  What was her last name?
[2:17:41.920 --> 2:17:42.920]  Edna Lane-Rome
[2:17:42.920 --> 2:17:44.920]  Yeah, exactly, the Brown family
[2:17:44.920 --> 2:17:47.920]  I mean, every place where the sheriff
[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:49.920]  And I think these were good sheriffs
[2:17:49.920 --> 2:17:50.920]  And good people there
[2:17:50.920 --> 2:17:52.920]  They just are ignorant of the power
[2:17:52.920 --> 2:17:54.920]  And the authority they have
[2:17:54.920 --> 2:17:56.920]  The federal government has no jurisdiction
[2:17:56.920 --> 2:17:58.920]  In your county to be doing these things
[2:17:58.920 --> 2:18:02.920]  Unless you, as the sheriff, allow it
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:04.920]  And yes, you can go along
[2:18:04.920 --> 2:18:07.920]  But to do so means you're throwing
[2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:10.920]  Your constituents to the dogs
[2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:12.920]  And this needs to be turned around
[2:18:12.920 --> 2:18:14.920]  And I do believe that this book
[2:18:14.920 --> 2:18:16.920]  Will offer the proper documentation
[2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:18.920]  And prove positive
[2:18:18.920 --> 2:18:20.920]  That the sheriff is the ultimate authority
[2:18:20.920 --> 2:18:22.920]  And we need to educate him about that
[2:18:22.920 --> 2:18:24.920]  I believe if we put the right information
[2:18:24.920 --> 2:18:26.920]  In front of the sheriffs in this country
[2:18:26.920 --> 2:18:28.920]  We'll have them convinced
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:30.920]  Can you imagine you can get freedom back
[2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:32.920]  And kick out the New World Order
[2:18:32.920 --> 2:18:34.920]  All at the same time
[2:18:34.920 --> 2:18:36.920]  By getting your sheriff on board
[2:18:36.920 --> 2:18:37.920]  Well, here's a-
[2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:39.920]  There's only 3,000 sheriffs
[2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:41.920]  In this country
[2:18:41.920 --> 2:18:44.920]  And if we could get 3 or 400 of them on board
[2:18:44.920 --> 2:18:46.920]  Just get 10% on board
[2:18:46.920 --> 2:18:48.920]  The rest of it will snowball
[2:18:48.920 --> 2:18:50.920]  Or you could move to where one of them
[2:18:50.920 --> 2:18:52.920]  Who actually is a constitutional sheriff
[2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:54.920]  And this idea is spreading
[2:18:54.920 --> 2:18:55.920]  Thanks to you and others
[2:18:55.920 --> 2:18:57.920]  Rediscovering liberty in our true system of government
[2:18:57.920 --> 2:18:59.920]  A microcosm is studying
[2:18:59.920 --> 2:19:01.920]  The western expansion, the robber barons
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:03.920]  The oil companies, the coal companies, the railroads
[2:19:03.920 --> 2:19:06.920]  They would come in and buy off a sheriff
[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:08.920]  And use him to let the
[2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:10.920]  Pinkerton and others go in
[2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:12.920]  Slaughter people and kick them out their land
[2:19:12.920 --> 2:19:14.920]  But in more cases than not
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:16.920]  It was the people's sheriff that would fight off the bankers
[2:19:16.920 --> 2:19:18.920]  So we've gone through this before
[2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:20.920]  Yes, we have
[2:19:20.920 --> 2:19:23.920]  And, you know, I really feel
[2:19:23.920 --> 2:19:26.920]  That the time is right
[2:19:26.920 --> 2:19:28.920]  Because of the hopelessness
[2:19:28.920 --> 2:19:30.920]  That people felt during
[2:19:30.920 --> 2:19:32.920]  Especially this last campaign
[2:19:32.920 --> 2:19:34.920]  The presidential election, I think
[2:19:34.920 --> 2:19:36.920]  Left so many people with a bad taste
[2:19:36.920 --> 2:19:38.920]  In their mouth of hopelessness
[2:19:38.920 --> 2:19:40.920]  And right now, I've given a message that there is hope
[2:19:40.920 --> 2:19:42.920]  And it is your county sheriff
[2:19:42.920 --> 2:19:45.920]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen
[2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:47.920]  Final segment with
[2:19:47.920 --> 2:19:49.920]  Sheriff Richard Mack straight ahead
[2:19:49.920 --> 2:19:51.920]  After this quick break
[2:19:51.920 --> 2:19:53.920]  And his new book will talk about that
[2:19:53.920 --> 2:19:55.920]  As well
[2:20:00.920 --> 2:20:02.920]  This year, many of us will have to make
[2:20:02.920 --> 2:20:05.920]  The tough decision on what to cut back on
[2:20:05.920 --> 2:20:07.920]  And what's essential as we prepare
[2:20:07.920 --> 2:20:09.920]  For an uncertain future
[2:20:09.920 --> 2:20:11.920]  In these troubled times, one of the most important
[2:20:11.920 --> 2:20:13.920]  Things your family can have is good health
[2:20:13.920 --> 2:20:15.920]  Some of the contributors to poor health
[2:20:15.920 --> 2:20:17.920]  Are parasites, viruses, toxins
[2:20:17.920 --> 2:20:19.920]  And heavy metals
[2:20:19.920 --> 2:20:21.920]  It's a documented fact
[2:20:21.920 --> 2:20:23.920]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people
[2:20:23.920 --> 2:20:25.920]  Around the world suffer from internal
[2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:27.920]  Parasites and parasitic infection
[2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:29.920]  Now, you can fight internal parasites
[2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:31.920]  Heavy metals and high cholesterol
[2:20:31.920 --> 2:20:33.920]  Naturally and safely
[2:20:33.920 --> 2:20:35.920]  Using fossilized phytoplankton powder
[2:20:35.920 --> 2:20:37.920]  Also known as FPP
[2:20:37.920 --> 2:20:39.920]  With your favorite beverage once a day
[2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:41.920]  FPP is now available to you
[2:20:41.920 --> 2:20:43.920]  From FreshwaterOrganics.com
[2:20:43.920 --> 2:20:46.920]  A two-month supply starts at just $17
[2:20:46.920 --> 2:20:48.920]  FPP is so affordable
[2:20:48.920 --> 2:20:50.920]  You can't afford to do without

[2:20:52.920 --> 2:20:54.920]  Or call them toll-free

[2:20:57.920 --> 2:21:00.920]  That's 888-949-3570
[2:21:00.920 --> 2:21:03.920]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years
[2:21:03.920 --> 2:21:05.920]  Hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[2:21:05.920 --> 2:21:07.920]  And live out their golden years
[2:21:07.920 --> 2:21:09.920]  Unfortunately, with taxation
[2:21:09.920 --> 2:21:12.920]  The rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical
[2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:15.920]  Many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line
[2:21:15.920 --> 2:21:17.920]  Is this a flaw for enterprise?
[2:21:17.920 --> 2:21:19.920]  Or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note
[2:21:19.920 --> 2:21:21.920]  Forcing us into perpetual debt
[2:21:21.920 --> 2:21:23.920]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes
[2:21:23.920 --> 2:21:25.920]  These questions and more can be answered
[2:21:25.920 --> 2:21:27.920]  By reading G. Edward Griffin's book
[2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:29.920]  The Creature from Jekyll Island
[2:21:29.920 --> 2:21:30.920]  And Ron Paul's States
[2:21:30.920 --> 2:21:32.920]  It's what every American needs to know about
[2:21:32.920 --> 2:21:34.920]  Central bank power
[2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:36.920]  A gripping adventure into the secret world
[2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:38.920]  Of international banking cartel
[2:21:38.920 --> 2:21:39.920]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson

[2:21:49.920 --> 2:21:52.920]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system

[2:21:57.920 --> 2:21:59.920]  A day unlike any other
[2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:01.920]  In the long course of American history
[2:22:01.920 --> 2:22:04.920]  A terrorist act of war against this country
[2:22:04.920 --> 2:22:06.920]  The enemy struck America on September 11
[2:22:06.920 --> 2:22:08.920]  But who is the enemy?
[2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:09.920]  Bin Laden
[2:22:09.920 --> 2:22:10.920]  This is his MO
[2:22:10.920 --> 2:22:11.920]  We have to look to the Middle East
[2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:13.920]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[2:22:13.920 --> 2:22:15.920]  Fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film
[2:22:15.920 --> 2:22:17.920]  To take a close look at the terrorist
[2:22:17.920 --> 2:22:20.920]  Ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[2:22:20.920 --> 2:22:22.920]  Some US investigators believe
[2:22:22.920 --> 2:22:25.920]  That there are Israelis again very much engaged
[2:22:25.920 --> 2:22:27.920]  In spying in and on the US
[2:22:27.920 --> 2:22:31.920]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:33.920]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:35.920]  The hijackers' ties to the FBI
[2:22:35.920 --> 2:22:36.920]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:38.920]  The Israeli intelligence network
[2:22:38.920 --> 2:22:39.920]  Warnings and war games
[2:22:39.920 --> 2:22:40.920]  The shadow government
[2:22:40.920 --> 2:22:41.920]  And much, much more

[2:23:01.920 --> 2:23:03.920]  That grow on earth, no other single plant
[2:23:03.920 --> 2:23:05.920]  Can compare with the nutritional value
[2:23:05.920 --> 2:23:08.920]  Of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant
[2:23:08.920 --> 2:23:09.920]  At hempusa.org

[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:15.920]  At hempusa.org
[2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:17.920]  We want to educate our listeners
[2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:19.920]  That edible hemp is not marijuana
[2:23:19.920 --> 2:23:21.920]  And is certified THC-free
[2:23:21.920 --> 2:23:23.920]  Our powder is 50% protein
[2:23:23.920 --> 2:23:25.920]  And does not contain gluten
[2:23:25.920 --> 2:23:27.920]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients
[2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:30.920]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to 5 years
[2:23:30.920 --> 2:23:31.920]  When vacuum packed

[2:24:07.920 --> 2:24:09.920]  Send the joker to the thief
[2:24:09.920 --> 2:24:11.920]  There's too much confusion
[2:24:11.920 --> 2:24:14.920]  I can't get no relief
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:17.920]  Outside in the cold distance
[2:24:17.920 --> 2:24:20.920]  A wildcat did growl
[2:24:20.920 --> 2:24:23.920]  There must be some kind of way out of here
[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:27.920]  Send the joker to the thief
[2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:32.920]  There's too much confusion
[2:24:32.920 --> 2:24:36.920]  I can't get no relief
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:40.920]  Business man there, drink my wine
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:44.920]  Plow man, dig my earth
[2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:48.920]  None will ever own the mine
[2:24:48.920 --> 2:24:52.920]  Nobody of it is worth it
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:55.920]  Sheriff Richard Mack is our guest
[2:24:55.920 --> 2:24:57.920]  With us till 40 after that I'm getting into financial news
[2:24:57.920 --> 2:24:59.920]  I have a state rep coming on
[2:24:59.920 --> 2:25:00.920]  This time from Missouri
[2:25:00.920 --> 2:25:02.920]  Fighting the New World Order
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:07.920]  Look, anytime good people disengage from government
[2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:10.920]  Terrany comes in and fills the vacuum
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:14.920]  99% of countries and nations have been tyrannical
[2:25:14.920 --> 2:25:17.920]  And that's really the bottom line
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:19.920]  You will have everything you've got stolen
[2:25:19.920 --> 2:25:21.920]  You really think you could just give the bankers your pension funds
[2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:24.920]  And your 401ks, and they wouldn't run a scam to steal it?
[2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:27.920]  That's what this police state's about, is total control
[2:25:27.920 --> 2:25:30.920]  Sheriff Richard Mack, I think it's an important time we have left with you
[2:25:30.920 --> 2:25:33.920]  For you to reach out to the police, not just the sheriff's departments
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:36.920]  And explain to them how they've been manipulated
[2:25:36.920 --> 2:25:38.920]  How they're being turned to the dark side
[2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:41.920]  Perhaps you should briefly talk about your awakening
[2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:42.920]  Well, it is
[2:25:42.920 --> 2:25:45.920]  And this book is directed towards everyone
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:48.920]  And my first book, the prequel to this one
[2:25:48.920 --> 2:25:50.920]  Is the proper role of law enforcement
[2:25:50.920 --> 2:25:53.920]  And it is intended for all police officers
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:56.920]  So they will become peace officers in this country
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:00.920]  And yes, quite frankly, the police departments across this country
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:03.920]  Whether it's sheriff's offices or police departments
[2:26:03.920 --> 2:26:06.920]  Have been brought into this mode of
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:08.920]  And been inculcated, if not brainwashed
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:11.920]  Into believing that all laws must be enforced
[2:26:11.920 --> 2:26:15.920]  And that no matter what, it comes down from the pike
[2:26:15.920 --> 2:26:18.920]  From Washington D.C. or from the state capitol must be enforced
[2:26:18.920 --> 2:26:23.920]  But that really, and the book talks about that very issue
[2:26:23.920 --> 2:26:26.920]  That lack of principle behind that
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:29.920]  Because that's actually, as Thomas Jefferson called it
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:32.920]  Laws were nothing more but tools of the tyrant
[2:26:32.920 --> 2:26:35.920]  And that's what laws have become today
[2:26:35.920 --> 2:26:38.920]  So all this photo radar crap
[2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:41.920]  And the multi-billion dollar industry
[2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:44.920]  Of wholesale distribution of traffic tickets
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:46.920]  Especially radar tickets
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:49.920]  You can go on and on, the drug war
[2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:53.920]  The drug war is something else I have preached against
[2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:55.920]  For the last 10 years
[2:26:55.920 --> 2:26:58.920]  I'm one of the speakers for law enforcement against prohibition
[2:26:58.920 --> 2:27:00.920]  Prohibition does not work
[2:27:00.920 --> 2:27:04.920]  Unless you're promoting a police state
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:07.920]  And more drugs because there's so much profit
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:10.920]  And every case of prohibition, it increases
[2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:12.920]  Of course, I mean let's be real
[2:27:12.920 --> 2:27:14.920]  Prohibition doesn't work
[2:27:14.920 --> 2:27:18.920]  Abraham Lincoln said prohibition is an insane law
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:21.920]  And an insane practice and makes crimes out of things
[2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:23.920]  That were never crimes at all
[2:27:23.920 --> 2:27:26.920]  And the prohibition isn't anything new
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:29.920]  I mean, it goes way, way back
[2:27:29.920 --> 2:27:32.920]  In fact, back during the Scottish Rebellion
[2:27:32.920 --> 2:27:34.920]  Against the King of England
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:36.920]  During Braveheart, you can even see
[2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:38.920]  In that movie of Braveheart
[2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:44.920]  Where the King of England outlawed bad pipe music
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:46.920]  Because it promoted patriotism
[2:27:46.920 --> 2:27:48.920]  And feelings of wanting to be free
[2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:51.920]  And so prohibition is nothing new
[2:27:51.920 --> 2:27:57.920]  And now isn't it insane that we have hemp illegal
[2:27:57.920 --> 2:28:00.920]  When we could use hemp to restore the economy of this country
[2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:03.920]  To make oil and fuel and all sorts of things
[2:28:03.920 --> 2:28:06.920]  That we could get from this hemp plant
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:07.920]  And let's be clear
[2:28:07.920 --> 2:28:10.920]  Almost all the hemp varieties don't have THC
[2:28:10.920 --> 2:28:11.920]  No, they don't
[2:28:11.920 --> 2:28:15.920]  It's better than cotton, better for rope, better for its band
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:16.920]  Yeah, exactly
[2:28:16.920 --> 2:28:19.920]  And I don't even care if they have THC in it too
[2:28:19.920 --> 2:28:21.920]  Who cares, but it doesn't
[2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:23.920]  And hemp has been used in our country way back
[2:28:23.920 --> 2:28:26.920]  The Declaration of Independence was written on it
[2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:28.920]  So was the Constitution
[2:28:28.920 --> 2:28:30.920]  Which served what our government does
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:32.920]  And then turns right around and lies to us
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:36.920]  And says stuff like, but there's no earmarks in this bill
[2:28:36.920 --> 2:28:38.920]  You know, it's amazing that people
[2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:41.920]  We have so many Kool-Aid drinkers in this country
[2:28:41.920 --> 2:28:44.920]  And I'm afraid that the police have been
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:45.920]  Part of the Kool-Aid drinkers
[2:28:45.920 --> 2:28:48.920]  And we've got to stand up and recognize our oath of office
[2:28:48.920 --> 2:28:52.920]  And the book points out and starts with this principle
[2:28:52.920 --> 2:28:56.920]  That James Madison said that states
[2:28:56.920 --> 2:28:58.920]  As you and I were talking earlier
[2:28:58.920 --> 2:29:00.920]  States and counties are supposed to erect barriers
[2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:03.920]  Against the encroachments of the national authority
[2:29:03.920 --> 2:29:05.920]  Well, that's what this is about
[2:29:05.920 --> 2:29:10.920]  And if we could depend on the 600-some-a-thousand peace officers
[2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:13.920]  In this country to keep their oath of office
[2:29:13.920 --> 2:29:15.920]  To uphold and defend the Constitution
[2:29:15.920 --> 2:29:20.920]  Instead of being red coats for the central government
[2:29:20.920 --> 2:29:22.920]  And sometimes for the state
[2:29:22.920 --> 2:29:24.920]  We could get our country back
[2:29:24.920 --> 2:29:28.920]  The people of this country could have their freedom back tomorrow
[2:29:28.920 --> 2:29:29.920]  Sheriff Richard Mack, stay there
[2:29:29.920 --> 2:29:31.920]  Final segment with you coming up
[2:29:31.920 --> 2:29:34.920]  And if police and military people don't like hearing this
[2:29:34.920 --> 2:29:35.920]  From Sheriff Richard Mack
[2:29:35.920 --> 2:29:37.920]  You don't like the United States
[2:29:37.920 --> 2:29:39.920]  Because this is what this country was founded on
[2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:41.920]  And it was set up to stop a powerful central government
[2:29:41.920 --> 2:29:43.920]  Because they always are bad
[2:29:43.920 --> 2:29:44.920]  They always go bad
[2:29:44.920 --> 2:29:47.920]  And they always hurt the people big time
[2:29:47.920 --> 2:29:50.920]  Stay with us, we'll be right back
[2:29:50.920 --> 2:29:52.920]  We're on the march
[2:29:52.920 --> 2:29:54.920]  The Empire's on the run
[2:29:54.920 --> 2:30:23.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:30:24.920 --> 2:30:26.920]  Stay with us, we'll be right back
[2:30:26.920 --> 2:30:31.520]  credit history and be protected from legal action without making one more payment to

[2:31:01.960 --> 2:31:07.600]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Sierra
[2:31:07.600 --> 2:31:11.120]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[2:31:11.120 --> 2:31:16.400]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[2:31:16.400 --> 2:31:18.040]  to tell their story.
[2:31:18.040 --> 2:31:26.960]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:31:26.960 --> 2:31:31.720]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[2:31:31.720 --> 2:31:34.000]  take action against their global masters.
[2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:37.160]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:31:37.160 --> 2:31:43.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear a 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:49.920]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide, download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and
[2:31:49.920 --> 2:31:55.040]  aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:31:55.040 --> 2:31:58.720]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[2:31:58.720 --> 2:32:01.400]  and bring in martial law.
[2:32:01.400 --> 2:32:03.200]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[2:32:03.200 --> 2:32:05.000]  What does humidity mean to you?
[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:09.400]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize
[2:32:09.400 --> 2:32:12.760]  that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[2:32:12.760 --> 2:32:15.760]  That's why I'd like you to visit AkolaBlue.com.

[2:33:14.520 --> 2:33:18.440]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to start pre-sales of the Obama deception
[2:33:18.440 --> 2:33:19.440]  today.
[2:33:19.440 --> 2:33:24.960]  I'll be done with the film in a few weeks and it'll be mass-produced and shipped out
[2:33:24.960 --> 2:33:31.160]  on March 15th and will also be at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality.
[2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:34.720]  We're getting an amazing response, people are freaking out wanting it.
[2:33:34.720 --> 2:33:38.360]  This doesn't attack him for the Kenya stuff or is he really a proper U.S. citizen and
[2:33:38.360 --> 2:33:39.360]  all that.
[2:33:39.360 --> 2:33:41.680]  We're not saying that that's not an issue, just we're not getting into that.
[2:33:41.680 --> 2:33:45.720]  We're getting into who he's appointing, what he's doing, his history, the gun control,
[2:33:45.720 --> 2:33:50.040]  the open borders, the FEMA camps, and how he's controlled by the very Wall Street group
[2:33:50.040 --> 2:33:52.480]  that engineered the implosion by design.
[2:33:52.480 --> 2:33:54.760]  This film is dynamic.
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:33:55.760]  This film is dynamic.
[2:33:55.760 --> 2:33:58.040]  I was up here again till midnight last night.
[2:33:58.040 --> 2:34:00.840]  I'm working on this tirelessly with my team.
[2:34:00.840 --> 2:34:06.280]  The Obama deception, the Obama deception dot net is the website and it's now up on the
[2:34:06.280 --> 2:34:07.280]  shopping cart.
[2:34:07.280 --> 2:34:13.200]  We haven't linked to it on the main page of infowars.com or prisonplanet.com yet.
[2:34:13.200 --> 2:34:15.120]  But why should you pre-order?
[2:34:15.120 --> 2:34:19.840]  Well, when you pre-order, the orders come in in a stack and the first person to order
[2:34:19.840 --> 2:34:23.600]  is the first person to have it shipped to them by UPS and it's vital.
[2:34:23.600 --> 2:34:25.320]  That's why I usually make a film in six months.
[2:34:25.320 --> 2:34:31.440]  I make this one in like three because I have been racing and racing and racing, but it's
[2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:33.760]  just as much quality or more than my other films.
[2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:38.640]  We're getting better and better at this and it's just an unbelievable film.
[2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:40.040]  It's obviously dangerous for us to do this.
[2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:43.120]  They come after everybody that fights them, but we're telling it like it is, he's a front
[2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:44.120]  man for the New World Order.
[2:34:44.120 --> 2:34:46.960]  So, the Obama deception is on sale right now at infowars.com.
[2:34:46.960 --> 2:34:49.760]  We've got to get to the toll free line.
[2:34:49.760 --> 2:34:50.760]  I read it to take orders.
[2:34:50.760 --> 2:34:53.000]  In fact, let's call them and get that set up.
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:55.080]  The Obama deception, 1995.
[2:34:55.080 --> 2:34:59.160]  I want you to make unlimited copies of this and give it out to everybody you know.
[2:34:59.160 --> 2:35:02.240]  Going back to Sheriff Richard Mack.
[2:35:02.240 --> 2:35:08.560]  Sheriff, there was a story in the San Antonio Express two days ago and I see these every
[2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:10.080]  couple of days and don't even cover them.
[2:35:10.080 --> 2:35:11.480]  I don't like bashing police.
[2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:17.360]  I know in psychology, it actually makes them get more into a gang mentality group.
[2:35:17.360 --> 2:35:21.280]  I know that most beat cops are good people, good men and women, but I know that these
[2:35:21.280 --> 2:35:24.280]  boss hog towns and a lot of these big cities are criminal.
[2:35:24.280 --> 2:35:27.680]  I've seen it and it just talked about all over Texas.
[2:35:27.680 --> 2:35:31.280]  They, I mean, just counting it for kind of, they just pull you over and take your watch,
[2:35:31.280 --> 2:35:35.160]  take your wallet, under asset forager, no drugs, no nothing found illegal.
[2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:36.600]  They rob old ladies.
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:37.600]  It's all in the news.
[2:35:37.600 --> 2:35:43.600]  I mean, it's not just bad cops or bad corrupt systems or violating the Millerites Constitution.
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:46.320]  We're seeing what happens in Mexico and most other nations.
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:50.960]  They are just going completely criminal and they're now recruiting more and more criminals
[2:35:50.960 --> 2:35:53.560]  into the police force, the military.
[2:35:53.560 --> 2:35:56.880]  We've got to turn this around now or the whole society will collapse like Mexico.
[2:35:56.880 --> 2:36:03.440]  Well, we do and, and we all have a responsibility with this, so we're off track in our country.
[2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:05.720]  We've forgotten our roots.
[2:36:05.720 --> 2:36:08.760]  We have gotten off our constitutional basics.
[2:36:08.760 --> 2:36:13.480]  We don't teach fundamentals in the police academies.
[2:36:13.480 --> 2:36:18.080]  They do hire people that should not be in there and I'm grateful too, just as you said,
[2:36:18.080 --> 2:36:26.200]  that these are the exceptions and not the norm, but it's happening too much and we need people
[2:36:26.200 --> 2:36:30.840]  to be vigilant and, you know, the price of freedom is eternal vigilance and we've got
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:34.600]  to get a handle on all of this.
[2:36:34.600 --> 2:36:38.480]  You know, in my first book, the proper role of law enforcement, it addresses that issue
[2:36:38.480 --> 2:36:43.680]  and it addresses how I was converted to the Constitution and I wasn't born a constitutional
[2:36:43.680 --> 2:36:45.200]  cop.
[2:36:45.200 --> 2:36:49.640]  You know, it came from looking at my oath of office one day that I swore to uphold and
[2:36:49.640 --> 2:36:54.080]  defend the Constitution, but I had never read it, so I started reading it and I believe
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:37:01.040]  that when these fundamental documents come to life for police officers and peace officers
[2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:04.240]  and sheriffs in this country, that they will have the same conversion.
[2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:09.160]  I believe, just as you said, that most of these men and women are good people, but they
[2:37:09.160 --> 2:37:14.720]  have to be given proper and good information or they're never going to change.
[2:37:14.720 --> 2:37:20.400]  I believe this change is possible and in my book, it addresses that, like I told you,
[2:37:20.400 --> 2:37:26.920]  it documents a large portion of my case that was endorsed by the Supreme Court and it's
[2:37:26.920 --> 2:37:30.360]  a landmark decision and it needs to be used.
[2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:37.080]  And James Madison has quoted again, again, talking about states standing up and counties
[2:37:37.080 --> 2:37:42.680]  standing up against the federal government and it says, hence, a double security arises
[2:37:42.680 --> 2:37:44.560]  to the rights of the people.
[2:37:44.560 --> 2:37:48.760]  The different governments will control each other at the same time that each will be controlled
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:49.760]  by itself.
[2:37:49.760 --> 2:37:52.720]  That's a quote from Madison, which is in the decision.
[2:37:52.720 --> 2:37:55.960]  Each binding down the others to the Constitution.
[2:37:55.960 --> 2:37:56.960]  Correct.
[2:37:56.960 --> 2:37:57.960]  Correct.
[2:37:57.960 --> 2:38:03.000]  And this is the only place in the book that it does this, so it says, to the reader.
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:08.360]  So who is charged with safeguarding the people from the federal government when it refuses
[2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:09.920]  to control itself?
[2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:14.920]  And then in parentheses, it says, please write the answer and the space provided.
[2:38:14.920 --> 2:38:19.560]  And there's an empty line right there for the reader to put that in there and you want
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:24.720]  your sheriff to realize the answer and there could be several answers.
[2:38:24.720 --> 2:38:31.280]  It could be the sheriff, it could be, the answer is, we are, or the sheriff, or I am.
[2:38:31.280 --> 2:38:37.840]  And that goes into the grand juries, the juries, how they've been made, these kept enslaved
[2:38:37.840 --> 2:38:41.800]  in the dark creatures who were told how to rule and told what to do when the founders
[2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:46.600]  in history in the Magna Carta states, even before that, 1215 in England, that it is the
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:52.080]  jury that judges the law and the case and if they think a law is unconstitutional or
[2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:55.240]  it's tyranny, or they don't, because back then they knew not to trust the police and
[2:38:55.240 --> 2:39:00.300]  the government, that they were even above the king and our ancestors fought incredible
[2:39:00.300 --> 2:39:02.680]  wars to get this basic right.
[2:39:02.680 --> 2:39:04.480]  And that's what everything is based on.
[2:39:04.480 --> 2:39:08.520]  And now they're abolishing the Magna Carta in England and crowing and trumpeting they've
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:09.520]  done this.
[2:39:09.520 --> 2:39:14.000]  So, bottom line, if you don't stand up, you will be run over.
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  Correct.
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:21.920]  And the overall question, and it asks the question specifically, to your sheriff, to
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:26.680]  your favorite peace officer, will you stand against tyranny?
[2:39:26.680 --> 2:39:28.560]  Well, there's only two answers.
[2:39:28.560 --> 2:39:30.720]  Yes, I will, or no, I won't.
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:35.840]  If he won't, especially after you giving this information, then you've got to get rid
[2:39:35.840 --> 2:39:38.160]  of him or you've got to move somewhere else.
[2:39:38.160 --> 2:39:44.840]  The second one is, yes, I will, then you convince him and show him when and where he should
[2:39:44.840 --> 2:39:45.840]  do that.
[2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:46.840]  All right, the book covers that.
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:52.840]  Do you want to stand behind the sheriff on this final, final, final question for you?
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:57.200]  You know, my life, I was a happy person, but I, you know, there was this emptiness and
[2:39:57.200 --> 2:40:01.480]  when I studied history and study what was happening, my life is so fulfilled, so dynamic.
[2:40:01.480 --> 2:40:03.200]  It is what you're meant to do.
[2:40:03.200 --> 2:40:07.440]  And men are meant to guard their hut, guard their village, guard their county.
[2:40:07.440 --> 2:40:08.440]  This is what humans do.
[2:40:08.440 --> 2:40:14.040]  I mean, it's the natural law that you become usurped or killed or enslaved if you don't
[2:40:14.040 --> 2:40:18.840]  stand up and aren't strong and if you don't have justice and that justice is what creates
[2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:20.920]  milk and honey and wonderful societies.
[2:40:20.920 --> 2:40:26.200]  How has your life changed since you were a constitutional police officer and a constitutional
[2:40:26.200 --> 2:40:29.600]  sheriff and the fights you've led and the victories you've had?
[2:40:29.600 --> 2:40:30.600]  Most of the time we fight back.
[2:40:30.600 --> 2:40:31.600]  We have victories.
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:32.600]  That's the big secret.
[2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:37.200]  And I just feel sorry for those that are involved in tyranny and rationalize it because
[2:40:37.200 --> 2:40:41.200]  they don't know that it isn't money or treasure or anything that life is about.
[2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:46.280]  It is literally about being a servant and being a protector and being a guardian and
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:51.480]  that all of this, whether we're a police officer or a sheriff's deputy or a firefighter
[2:40:51.480 --> 2:40:57.400]  or a military person or a shopkeeper, we are all guardians and that we have a job in life
[2:40:57.400 --> 2:41:00.840]  to be involved to fight evil because evil is always in our society.
[2:41:00.840 --> 2:41:03.240]  So what has that journey been like for you?
[2:41:03.240 --> 2:41:07.600]  Well, the first thing that I thought of when you said that, and I've even asked that question
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:10.920]  before, it's been a real roller coaster ride.
[2:41:10.920 --> 2:41:16.720]  It has been lots of ups, lots of downs, very exciting, thrills, thought I was going to
[2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:23.080]  die a few times, but my wife is hung with me and my kids have also and I've got a good
[2:41:23.080 --> 2:41:29.840]  family and it's brought us all fulfillment and I've got the respect of my kids because
[2:41:29.840 --> 2:41:33.320]  they know that I stood for what I believed in.
[2:41:33.320 --> 2:41:36.920]  Even though it didn't bring us any money, in fact, it did quite the opposite of that,
[2:41:36.920 --> 2:41:38.760]  but this has never been about money.
[2:41:38.760 --> 2:41:43.400]  It's been about one thing and one thing only and that is standing and fighting for what
[2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:49.360]  I truly believe in and this is what it has accomplished personally is I really feel that
[2:41:49.360 --> 2:41:54.080]  I've been able to make a little difference and the good Lord put me on earth to make
[2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:55.080]  a difference.
[2:41:55.080 --> 2:42:00.680]  I believe that He's called me to this work and I'm not going to turn my back on it.
[2:42:00.680 --> 2:42:01.680]  I'm not going to stop.
[2:42:01.680 --> 2:42:03.640]  I'm only 56 years old.
[2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:10.240]  I've got plenty of time left to stand and fight for this holy cause just as Patrick Henry
[2:42:10.240 --> 2:42:12.520]  called it, the holy cause of liberty.
[2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:14.280]  We cannot give up.
[2:42:14.280 --> 2:42:18.280]  Friends and neighbors and everybody listening to this do not give up.
[2:42:18.280 --> 2:42:24.000]  I've got speaking engagements about this very thing in Texas where people are inviting
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:26.840]  their sheriffs and favorite cops and deputies.
[2:42:26.840 --> 2:42:29.000]  I've got another one lined up in Ohio.
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:31.160]  I want to be doing this every weekend.
[2:42:31.160 --> 2:42:35.280]  So get on the website www.sheriffmack.com.
[2:42:35.280 --> 2:42:41.400]  I'm going to try to put my schedule on there so you know but anyway give me an email www.sheriffmack.com.
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:42.900]  It's on my website.
[2:42:42.900 --> 2:42:47.520]  Give me a call, drop me a line and let's make this movement.
[2:42:47.520 --> 2:42:54.600]  This movement can stop the New World Order but we've got to get this information out.
[2:42:54.600 --> 2:42:56.280]  Get the book for yourself.
[2:42:56.280 --> 2:43:00.440]  Get one for your favorite cop and definitely get one for your sheriff and let's get this
[2:43:00.440 --> 2:43:01.440]  thing rolling.
[2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:07.200]  All right, Sheriff Mac, just I would just say this, it isn't just physical courage.
[2:43:07.200 --> 2:43:11.280]  All the psychological studies show it's moral courage to admit you've been manipulated,
[2:43:11.280 --> 2:43:15.840]  to admit you've been indoctrinated and inculcated, to we're not even asked people to think the
[2:43:15.840 --> 2:43:16.840]  way we do.
[2:43:16.840 --> 2:43:20.160]  Just look at history, look at what you're doing, look at what you're involved in, whether
[2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:24.600]  you're a business person or a police officer, whatever it is and ask if this country's going
[2:43:24.600 --> 2:43:28.440]  in the right direction and ask what you're doing and all you silly yuppies that giggle
[2:43:28.440 --> 2:43:31.840]  and smirk and laugh about all this stuff, I told you the bankers were going to take
[2:43:31.840 --> 2:43:35.560]  everything you had because we had their own IMF World Bank documents.
[2:43:35.560 --> 2:43:36.560]  This isn't a game.
[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:38.600]  These guys aren't playing patty cake.
[2:43:38.600 --> 2:43:42.480]  The people running this New World Order killed 200 plus million people last century.
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:46.440]  So we don't stand up and fight these creatures just for fun.
[2:43:46.440 --> 2:43:51.760]  We do this because we know that there's no other choice and it is the best feeling and
[2:43:51.760 --> 2:43:56.520]  the most fulfilling thing in the world to just gut up, get past the fear, then you won't
[2:43:56.520 --> 2:43:57.520]  have it anymore.
[2:43:57.520 --> 2:44:03.000]  Once you go through fear, it's gone and it is animating the animating contest of liberty.
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:07.960]  You aren't living bungee jumping, you're not going to find this exhilaration, partying,
[2:44:07.960 --> 2:44:13.720]  having sex, doing drugs, getting drunk, none of that is going to fulfill you.
[2:44:13.720 --> 2:44:19.840]  Being rich, being powerful, nothing is going to fulfill you like helping others and knowing
[2:44:19.840 --> 2:44:23.520]  what's going on in the world and not being a sucker and a chump and we just really want
[2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:27.720]  to salute you, Sheriff Richard Mack, and we'll talk to you in the near future.
[2:44:27.720 --> 2:44:31.480]  Thanks a lot, Alex, and God bless you and thanks again for having me on.
[2:44:31.480 --> 2:44:33.400]  Thank you for joining us.
[2:44:33.400 --> 2:44:34.400]  Absolutely.
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:38.760]  You know, I think about how they could set me up, imprison me, how evil the feds are,
[2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:42.200]  how evil the most the states are now, and I'm not even worried about it.
[2:44:42.200 --> 2:44:47.040]  I worry about my little sweet, dear, darling, angelic children, but you know, if something
[2:44:47.040 --> 2:44:48.520]  bad happens to them, that's the New World Order.
[2:44:48.520 --> 2:44:49.520]  That's not me.
[2:44:49.520 --> 2:44:54.640]  I put it in God's hands because they have no future and other children have no future
[2:44:54.640 --> 2:44:55.880]  if we don't stand up.
[2:44:55.880 --> 2:45:02.000]  If we give in to the fear they win, if we fight, they lose.
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:05.480]  All you have to do is put yourself in motion.
[2:45:05.480 --> 2:45:11.080]  All you have to do is make the commitment to fight tyranny in small ways.
[2:45:11.080 --> 2:45:13.560]  It will grow into great things.
[2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:15.480]  Victory is ours.
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:17.320]  Resistance is victory.
[2:45:17.320 --> 2:45:22.400]  Now, that said, we need your financial support here.
[2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:25.200]  And the ways we ask for financial support are buying the books and videos, making all
[2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:29.160]  the copies you want, getting President Planet TV memberships, all of that because people
[2:45:29.160 --> 2:45:32.840]  say, Alex, you need to do this, you need to do that, you need to expand, you need to take
[2:45:32.840 --> 2:45:34.520]  action on these ways.
[2:45:34.520 --> 2:45:37.960]  And a lot of times I'd say, you know, what are you telling me to do more?
[2:45:37.960 --> 2:45:38.960]  But you know what?
[2:45:38.960 --> 2:45:39.960]  I'm taking the challenge.
[2:45:39.960 --> 2:45:40.960]  I am doing more.
[2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:43.120]  But if you ask me to do more, you have to support more.
[2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:46.680]  And the number one thing is telling your email list, your friends, your family, your neighbors,
[2:45:46.680 --> 2:45:51.200]  your community about AM and FM stations we're on in your area, shortwave, internet, satellite,
[2:45:51.200 --> 2:45:54.320]  the free podcast, that's how this show grows.
[2:45:54.320 --> 2:45:55.320]  Are you doing that?
[2:45:55.320 --> 2:45:57.880]  I mean, it's one thing to almost take action.
[2:45:57.880 --> 2:45:59.520]  It's another thing to take action.
[2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:00.520]  That's the biggest thing.
[2:46:00.520 --> 2:46:02.520]  I think this show is the most effective, the best guest, the best info.
[2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:06.880]  We bring all these great activists that have had success at the state level, federal level.
[2:46:06.880 --> 2:46:11.000]  He's one of the Supreme Court, held back a lot of gun grabbing, and it's all because
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:13.360]  you, the court listeners, have supported these other people.
[2:46:13.360 --> 2:46:20.040]  We bring on here as a larger platform, but we need the platform itself to grow so that
[2:46:20.040 --> 2:46:21.760]  we can launch others.
[2:46:21.760 --> 2:46:26.480]  This literally, we're like a Cape Canaveral rocket base, and we are launching, you know,
[2:46:26.480 --> 2:46:32.120]  ICBMs at the enemy, and we're trying to produce more info weapons and more powerful weapons
[2:46:32.120 --> 2:46:35.800]  to blow holes in the enemy.
[2:46:35.800 --> 2:46:37.520]  And we are going straight into the enemy.
[2:46:37.520 --> 2:46:38.960]  We are committed.
[2:46:38.960 --> 2:46:39.960]  We are focused.
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:45.960]  Well, I bring Ted Anderson up a couple of times a week now because gold was $280 an ounce
[2:46:45.960 --> 2:46:49.960]  when I first started plugging it.
[2:46:49.960 --> 2:46:53.400]  Now it's gone up, you know, to 939, 4950 today.
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:59.840]  I haven't looked, a few minutes, except at 940 something, 930 something, and rising.
[2:46:59.840 --> 2:47:04.160]  And Ted doesn't really even make money doing this.
[2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:08.120]  He buys the gold and silver when it's low, and he sells it when it's low, and he sells
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:09.200]  it when it's high.
[2:47:09.200 --> 2:47:14.680]  And he is at the very tail end of a purchase he made three weeks ago when gold was at 830.
[2:47:14.680 --> 2:47:16.880]  And Ted is the owner of this Genesis network.
[2:47:16.880 --> 2:47:20.440]  By the way, Ted, I've been so busy, I keep forgetting.
[2:47:20.440 --> 2:47:22.440]  Have you gotten my new Star Guide feed yet?
[2:47:22.440 --> 2:47:24.680]  I'm working on that right now.
[2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:28.000]  We just sent the equipment up to ABC so we can get that going.
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  Yeah.
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  Leasing that feed.
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:31.000]  Yeah.
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:37.480]  It takes, we've got a T1 connection there, but we have to break it up with an AdTran modem
[2:47:37.480 --> 2:47:39.360]  type unit that can do that.
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:44.320]  And then we put the Codex up there in order to transcode and get your voice back over
[2:47:44.320 --> 2:47:45.320]  to you.
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:46.320]  I mean, that's an example of what I'm saying.
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:50.720]  I'm on one ABC feed, but we're going to go, this radio show, 24 Hours a Day, except for
[2:47:50.720 --> 2:47:56.400]  Jason Burmes, on our own system with Ted, and it's Ted stepping up to pay the $5,000
[2:47:56.400 --> 2:47:57.400]  a month.
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:00.760]  And the feds, the side issue, I'm going to bring this up now, Ted, and we'll hold you
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:01.960]  over to the next segment.
[2:48:01.960 --> 2:48:03.280]  The feds put out this line.
[2:48:03.280 --> 2:48:08.560]  We know they're feds, that we're owned by ABC and owned by the Saudi Arabians, and that
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:13.160]  this is the kind of lies they do, and that we're on ABC.
[2:48:13.160 --> 2:48:14.160]  Yes.
[2:48:14.160 --> 2:48:18.400]  You go out and you lease a clear channel, an ABC receiver, or a Jones receiver.
[2:48:18.400 --> 2:48:21.960]  Those are the three radio station owners are laughing, and so are managers.
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:22.960]  They know.
[2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:23.960]  That's the piece of equipment.
[2:48:23.960 --> 2:48:27.360]  Like you, you know, you contract for an ISD inline, you get it from AT&T.
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:32.480]  We're not owned by AT&T, but that shows how the feds operate right there going, oh, look,
[2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:33.480]  they're owned by ABC.
[2:48:33.480 --> 2:48:34.480]  No.
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:40.680]  This, any of you can call ABC and lease your own feed, and the reason we go with ABC is
[2:48:40.680 --> 2:48:41.960]  they don't restrict the feed.
[2:48:41.960 --> 2:48:45.120]  You can lease one from Clear Channel, but they won't let the stations have the encoders
[2:48:45.120 --> 2:48:47.040]  to get you off unless you're a Clear Channel show.
[2:48:47.040 --> 2:48:51.200]  And it's just so sick how I think of the fact we're trying to get another satellite for
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:56.200]  the stations out there to deliver my show 24 hours a day so they can air it more, and
[2:48:56.200 --> 2:49:01.120]  then the enemy gets upset by that and lies to people and says that we're ABC.
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:02.720]  Can you explain that to folks then?
[2:49:02.720 --> 2:49:07.000]  Well, yeah, I mean, as simple as this, I mean, it's the delivery mechanism that's used by
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:10.160]  all the radio shows out there in the marketplace.
[2:49:10.160 --> 2:49:11.160]  You write about that.
[2:49:11.160 --> 2:49:15.720]  I did lease from Clear Channel for a little while, and unless if you're a premier group
[2:49:15.720 --> 2:49:21.800]  radio show like Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh or some of these others that they produce,
[2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:22.800]  they won't open up their receivers.
[2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:24.920]  And they didn't tell you that when they leased it to you.
[2:49:24.920 --> 2:49:25.920]  Oh, no.
[2:49:25.920 --> 2:49:30.080]  I mean, I had to get out of a five-year contract, and I had to buy my way out of it.
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:31.080]  It was crazy.
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:34.340]  ABC just happens to open it up.
[2:49:34.340 --> 2:49:40.360]  Anybody that's picking up Paul Harvey or ABC News has a receiver that can pick up the Alex
[2:49:40.360 --> 2:49:41.520]  Jones show.
[2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:45.960]  And if you want to syndicate in the marketplace, if you want to make any kind of a dent in
[2:49:45.960 --> 2:49:51.440]  the terrestrial market, meaning licensed AM and FM stations out there, you have to have
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:56.400]  an ABC Star Guide 3 feed, which is now developing into this new XDS receiver.
[2:49:56.400 --> 2:50:02.440]  But my whole point is this, we're doing a talk radio show, and you know, I have a Neumann
[2:50:02.440 --> 2:50:03.560]  Mike, German.
[2:50:03.560 --> 2:50:05.840]  I'm not owned by the Neumann Corporation.
[2:50:05.840 --> 2:50:08.480]  I have a Toshiba TV in front of me as a monitor.
[2:50:08.480 --> 2:50:13.200]  I'm not owned by Toshiba, and I'm just saying listeners, this is what the feds do, and it
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:17.480]  makes me angry not that they're putting the lies out, but that people are so gullible,
[2:50:17.480 --> 2:50:19.760]  like there's a porno magazine called Genesis.
[2:50:19.760 --> 2:50:23.480]  They claim we're owned by the porno magazine when there's hundreds of companies called
[2:50:23.480 --> 2:50:24.560]  Genesis.
[2:50:24.560 --> 2:50:29.200]  Another writer put out a lie, because there was some Genesis thing with some Saudi Arabian.
[2:50:29.200 --> 2:50:33.800]  You know, I think you ought to post on the site your, your, your, your charter, your
[2:50:33.800 --> 2:50:36.320]  corporate charter, that it's a Ted Anderson company.
[2:50:36.320 --> 2:50:40.160]  I'm tired of the feds running black ops and people believing it, Ted.
[2:50:40.160 --> 2:50:41.160]  Yeah.
[2:50:41.160 --> 2:50:43.920]  And there's a lot of, a lot of funny information.
[2:50:43.920 --> 2:50:47.680]  I think, you know, I think you want to just sue one of those people just to teach people
[2:50:47.680 --> 2:50:48.680]  a lesson.
[2:50:48.680 --> 2:50:49.680]  That's a good idea.
[2:50:49.680 --> 2:50:51.040]  Now, I know you sue people.
[2:50:51.040 --> 2:50:54.280]  You need to go ahead and just sue them because I'm tired of them getting, we need to get
[2:50:54.280 --> 2:50:57.560]  aggressive and start hammering people and call them in court and go, now listen, you
[2:50:57.560 --> 2:51:01.840]  bastard liar, you talk, you tell the judge what's going on.

[2:52:01.800 --> 2:52:07.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:08.520]  against this country.
[2:52:08.520 --> 2:52:10.680]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:52:10.680 --> 2:52:12.680]  But who is the enemy?
[2:52:12.680 --> 2:52:13.680]  Bin Laden.
[2:52:13.680 --> 2:52:14.680]  This is his M.O.
[2:52:14.680 --> 2:52:17.800]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:52:17.800 --> 2:52:22.480]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:52:22.480 --> 2:52:25.080]  networks inside the United States.
[2:52:25.080 --> 2:52:29.560]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:52:29.560 --> 2:52:31.720]  in and on the U.S.
[2:52:31.720 --> 2:52:35.320]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:35.320 --> 2:52:40.880]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:40.880 --> 2:52:45.040]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[2:52:45.040 --> 2:52:46.040]  much more.
[2:52:46.040 --> 2:52:47.040]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:53:06.240 --> 2:53:09.120]  People are being laid off in record numbers.

[2:54:01.160 --> 2:54:07.400]  They came and took it all away, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:54:07.400 --> 2:54:10.760]  You know, Ted, I didn't mean to get sidetracked.
[2:54:10.760 --> 2:54:13.840]  I just got into radio stuff with you here on air.
[2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:14.840]  We've been so busy.
[2:54:14.840 --> 2:54:15.840]  I hadn't talked to you about that.
[2:54:15.840 --> 2:54:21.600]  Jason Bermas' show starts nine to midnight, central March 1st, a couple of Thursdays from
[2:54:21.600 --> 2:54:22.600]  now.
[2:54:22.600 --> 2:54:27.160]  And I just know what a good guy you are and how hard you work, everything you've done,
[2:54:27.160 --> 2:54:30.040]  and the feds little lies about you really make me mad.
[2:54:30.040 --> 2:54:33.120]  I think I'm going to look at suing one or two of these people just to, you know, there's
[2:54:33.120 --> 2:54:36.000]  going to be a court record of their lives and get a judgment against them, but that's
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  a side issue.
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:38.960]  I'm glad you're going to get us another satellite feed.
[2:54:38.960 --> 2:54:40.960]  Good job, Ted.
[2:54:40.960 --> 2:54:47.120]  Let's get into the gold here in the four minutes that we have got left here today.
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:50.680]  You are at the very tail end, and folks, he told you this one was at 700 and that ran
[2:54:50.680 --> 2:54:52.920]  out and then it was 800 and then 830.
[2:54:52.920 --> 2:54:54.560]  It's about to run out.
[2:54:54.560 --> 2:54:58.080]  He was able, at that original price, to get some more sovereigns, British sovereigns,
[2:54:58.080 --> 2:54:59.080]  and Franks.
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:00.600]  What's the gold right now, Ted?
[2:55:00.600 --> 2:55:04.840]  Well, gold today has seen 948 80.
[2:55:04.840 --> 2:55:06.360]  It's down by just about two bucks.
[2:55:06.360 --> 2:55:07.360]  It's nine.
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:09.560]  It's, it's up 27 bucks.
[2:55:09.560 --> 2:55:12.400]  It's at 944 10.
[2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:15.200]  I did some math on the British sovereigns.
[2:55:15.200 --> 2:55:21.360]  Currently right now there are 288 when I buy them right now, I'm carrying them for 265.
[2:55:21.360 --> 2:55:23.760]  There are four of them put together, make an ounce.
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:28.560]  So I took the difference of 23 bucks from where they would be today to what I'm offering
[2:55:28.560 --> 2:55:32.600]  them for, and it comes out to be $92 per ounce.
[2:55:32.600 --> 2:55:37.000]  I also have the French Frank, I did the math on that one as well.
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  They are up $19 from where I'm carrying them right now.
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:44.320]  They're at 235, I've got them at 217.
[2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:51.080]  You multiply that by five because it's a fifth of an ounce, $95 above and beyond where they're
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:53.440]  trading at right now per ounce.
[2:55:53.440 --> 2:55:54.440]  That's the difference.
[2:55:54.440 --> 2:55:57.560]  I mean, the silver market right now is even higher.
[2:55:57.560 --> 2:56:02.400]  What we're currently right now today is at 1372.
[2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:06.080]  I have the silver dollars, not the silver dollars, I wish I had them.
[2:56:06.080 --> 2:56:11.120]  I have the walking liberty halves and the dimes for back when it's down at $9 an ounce
[2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:12.680]  when silver was down there.
[2:56:12.680 --> 2:56:21.400]  The same price as the dimes currently right now are at $1,190 per, per $100 face value.
[2:56:21.400 --> 2:56:22.400]  Or $1.59 today.
[2:56:22.400 --> 2:56:28.000]  This is the best deal you've ever offered, Alex, I haven't ever offered it for this,
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:33.240]  not like this before, and again, I mean, I talk to more of my clients.
[2:56:33.240 --> 2:56:38.120]  This is priced in $114 less than the market is right now, in most places don't even have
[2:56:38.120 --> 2:56:41.240]  gold or silver, and when they do, they put huge premiums over.
[2:56:41.240 --> 2:56:43.840]  This is an insane deal.
[2:56:43.840 --> 2:56:45.280]  How long are you offering it?
[2:56:45.280 --> 2:56:48.560]  Well, Alex, I can't offer this past midnight tonight.
[2:56:48.560 --> 2:56:49.560]  There's no way.
[2:56:49.560 --> 2:56:53.160]  Unless I can have a huge drop in gold, it ain't going to happen.
[2:56:53.160 --> 2:56:58.440]  I mean, I'm watching, I mean, the argument that's going on in Washington D.C. about
[2:56:58.440 --> 2:57:03.960]  this stimulus package, and then right behind that, the Secretary of Treasury asking for
[2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:07.120]  like $3 trillion to bail out the banks again.
[2:57:07.120 --> 2:57:09.880]  And last time, $700 billion turned into $8.5 trillion.
[2:57:09.880 --> 2:57:10.880]  Right.
[2:57:10.880 --> 2:57:15.320]  I mean, reports to bailouts now at $9.7 trillion, that's the newest number, so $3 trillion would
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:18.440]  be three times out of the always left, which we're talking about $30 trillion.
[2:57:18.440 --> 2:57:22.880]  I mean, this, I mean, these numbers don't, it's insane, protect yourselves now.
[2:57:22.880 --> 2:57:24.360]  They're hyperinflating the currency.
[2:57:24.360 --> 2:57:25.680]  There's no doubt of that.
[2:57:25.680 --> 2:57:30.040]  Give the brokers a call on the Franks, on the sovereigns, and on the half dollars in
[2:57:30.040 --> 2:57:40.520]  the dimes in silver, 1-800-686-2237, 1-800-686-2237, and that's good through midnight, February
[2:57:40.520 --> 2:57:41.520]  11th.
[2:57:41.520 --> 2:57:42.680]  That's a nice birthday present for me to everybody.
[2:57:42.680 --> 2:57:43.680]  Today's my birthday, Ted.
[2:57:43.680 --> 2:57:44.680]  Oh, wow.
[2:57:44.680 --> 2:57:45.680]  Happy birthday.
[2:57:45.680 --> 2:57:46.680]  I forgot about that.
[2:57:46.680 --> 2:57:48.520]  I'm an old man now, I'm 35.
[2:57:48.520 --> 2:57:50.880]  Well, you're getting to be an old man, all right.
[2:57:50.880 --> 2:57:53.400]  I'm on miles on there.
[2:57:53.400 --> 2:57:58.080]  Oh, well, I tell you what, every year goes by and that the amount of people that are
[2:57:58.080 --> 2:58:02.880]  listening to this show and how it grows, I can't tell you, Alex, I am so appreciative
[2:58:02.880 --> 2:58:03.880]  of what you've done.
[2:58:03.880 --> 2:58:07.560]  No, I'm pretty sure the listener is spreading the word.
[2:58:07.560 --> 2:58:09.600]  So where is silver right now?
[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:15.000]  Silver currently right now, $13 and you're selling it at the $9 level, which is priced
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:23.360]  in at $9, 800-686-2237, and you're pricing gold at $114 less than the market is.
[2:58:23.360 --> 2:58:25.600]  Yeah, right now at this time, you can't beat that.
[2:58:25.600 --> 2:58:28.400]  I know that my competition is shuttering.
[2:58:28.400 --> 2:58:32.600]  The other thing too is I have a lot of other coins that are due for our price increase
[2:58:32.600 --> 2:58:33.680]  starting tonight too.
[2:58:33.680 --> 2:58:35.400]  So if you're interested in something else too.
[2:58:35.400 --> 2:58:39.840]  This is it, 800-686-2237, staying with us.
[2:58:39.840 --> 2:58:40.840]  Thanks, Ted.
[2:58:40.840 --> 2:58:41.840]  Thanks.

[2:58:57.040 --> 2:58:58.040]  important than ever.
[2:58:58.040 --> 2:59:01.040]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[2:59:01.040 --> 2:59:03.840]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[2:59:03.840 --> 2:59:07.880]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in
[2:59:07.880 --> 2:59:10.120]  any emergency if you simply prepare.
[2:59:10.120 --> 2:59:13.400]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation between you.
[2:59:13.400 --> 2:59:17.760]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,

[2:59:47.480 --> 2:59:54.520]  The first step is getting storable food.
[2:59:54.520 --> 2:59:56.600]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:59:56.600 --> 3:00:06.080]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:06.080 --> 3:00:10.080]  We are back live now already into the final hour.
[3:00:10.080 --> 3:00:12.080]  State Representative Jim Guest will be joining us.
[3:00:12.080 --> 3:00:14.080]  They're going to come out the floor right now.
[3:00:14.080 --> 3:00:16.080]  He's in Missouri.
[3:00:16.080 --> 3:00:19.720]  10 states, another 20 according to Jack McClam are moving to declare sovereignty.
[3:00:19.720 --> 3:00:23.480]  They're talking about martial law, gun confiscations, how they're not going along with compulsory
[3:00:23.480 --> 3:00:26.000]  slavery, a new domestic draft.
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:30.760]  Obama is pushing, this is exciting, we're on the march, the empire is on the run.
[3:00:30.760 --> 3:00:35.280]  Ted Anderson is gone now, but you just heard him do that gold pitch from gold he bought
[3:00:35.280 --> 3:00:39.960]  when it was at $830 level.
[3:00:39.960 --> 3:00:48.760]  Just amazing deal on precious metals in stock, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237, take advantage
[3:00:48.760 --> 3:00:49.760]  of this or you're crazy.
[3:00:49.760 --> 3:00:52.880]  In fact, I'm going to take advantage of it every six months or so.
[3:00:52.880 --> 3:00:55.840]  I bought a little bit of silver and gold and this deal is just too good.
[3:00:55.840 --> 3:00:56.840]  800-686-2337.
[3:00:56.840 --> 3:01:02.080]  Okay, we are back live now into the fourth hour.
[3:01:02.080 --> 3:01:05.240]  Coming up, I'm going to get into Madoff's wife, pulled 15 million before his arrest
[3:01:05.240 --> 3:01:06.240]  out of Reuters.
[3:01:06.240 --> 3:01:09.560]  They've got a new drug czar, we're going over all that, Time Magazine calls for a world
[3:01:09.560 --> 3:01:14.520]  government and this issue titled the New World Order, saying a foreign bank will control
[3:01:14.520 --> 3:01:15.520]  the United States.
[3:01:15.520 --> 3:01:17.520]  See, this has been the plan.
[3:01:17.520 --> 3:01:21.440]  The good news is 10 states now have legislation introduced, it was eight last Friday, now
[3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:22.440]  it's 10.
[3:01:22.440 --> 3:01:29.360]  There's 20 more looking at it and we've been having people on from Oklahoma and from Washington
[3:01:29.360 --> 3:01:31.720]  and from New Hampshire, more from New Hampshire.
[3:01:31.720 --> 3:01:34.640]  Throughout this week and next week, we're having these great patriots, these great men
[3:01:34.640 --> 3:01:35.640]  and women.
[3:01:35.640 --> 3:01:42.160]  All representative Jim Guest has introduced HCR 13, claims sovereignty from the United
[3:01:42.160 --> 3:01:45.240]  States under the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution for all powers and otherwise
[3:01:45.240 --> 3:01:48.080]  enumerated and granted to the federal government under the Constitution.
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:54.560]  Now that's already enshrined in the 10th Amendment, but it has to be redeclared and
[3:01:54.560 --> 3:01:59.120]  the state has to be ordered and reminded the state agencies to follow that.
[3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:01.200]  Representative Guest, it's a great honor to have you on with us.
[3:02:01.200 --> 3:02:07.400]  Well, it's an honor for me to be on and visit with people of this great country and help
[3:02:07.400 --> 3:02:10.400]  them join our forces here too.
[3:02:10.400 --> 3:02:14.880]  It's sad that we have to have a wake up call to take back of the powers that supposedly
[3:02:14.880 --> 3:02:15.880]  are ours.
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:19.520]  Absolutely, we're going to break in a moment and come back and talk more about it, but
[3:02:19.520 --> 3:02:23.840]  what spurred you to introduce this and how is it going and what does it cover?
[3:02:23.840 --> 3:02:28.920]  I guess it probably started a couple years ago when this real idea came out that was
[3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:33.400]  also a direct violation of the 10th Amendment and we started down the road to get states
[3:02:33.400 --> 3:02:38.880]  to enact legislation to oppose that and we kept citing it was the direct violation about
[3:02:38.880 --> 3:02:43.840]  three or four amendments in the Bill of Rights and obviously the 10th and as we got on down
[3:02:43.840 --> 3:02:46.840]  there in abyss with other legislators around the country, I thought, you know, we need
[3:02:46.840 --> 3:02:52.800]  to make a concerted and united effort here to file some legislation to notify our federal
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:56.560]  government that we're going to take back those rights delineated in the 10th Amendment.
[3:02:56.560 --> 3:02:58.840]  So that's kind of what was behind it there.
[3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:01.960]  Have you seen the New Hampshire one that says we're saying no to martial law?
[3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:02.960]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:03:02.960 --> 3:03:05.960]  What do you think of that?
[3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:07.200]  That was a very bold step.
[3:03:07.200 --> 3:03:14.880]  I presented my HCR 13, the 10th Amendment rights here in my committee yesterday morning
[3:03:14.880 --> 3:03:16.480]  and I briefly noted it.
[3:03:16.480 --> 3:03:19.560]  I said, if you think this language is a little bit strong, you need to read the New Hampshire
[3:03:19.560 --> 3:03:23.960]  where it says, if they violate any of these, we're going to nullify the Constitution, start
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:24.960]  all over again.
[3:03:24.960 --> 3:03:29.120]  So yes, I commend them for that very brave and bold step they're taking.
[3:03:29.120 --> 3:03:32.200]  And New Hampshire has the strongest state constitution.
[3:03:32.200 --> 3:03:36.560]  It's even better in powers delegated to the state and the people than even the federal,
[3:03:36.560 --> 3:03:40.840]  the only one that I know of that's even stronger and it states right to revolt and they're
[3:03:40.840 --> 3:03:44.320]  basically preparing for right to revolt clause.
[3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:45.320]  That's right.
[3:03:45.320 --> 3:03:49.320]  I just reiterate that in like I said in that committee meeting, I kind of went over the
[3:03:49.320 --> 3:03:53.760]  high points of it that I said, you know, this is a no wonder they're called a live-free
[3:03:53.760 --> 3:03:59.560]  or die state up there and we need more patriots and poor people around the country to stand
[3:03:59.560 --> 3:04:02.440]  up with what they're starting there.
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:07.000]  I want to go over your concerns about federal control because it's not even federal.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:09.800]  It's international time.
[3:04:09.800 --> 3:04:13.000]  Time magazine says it is a world government run by private banks.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:17.560]  So they can't call us coops Wall Street journals calling for North American Union and getting
[3:04:17.560 --> 3:04:21.440]  rid of the dollar and letting a foreign bank and we're being taken over like a third world
[3:04:21.440 --> 3:04:23.120]  country by foreign banks.
[3:04:23.120 --> 3:04:27.280]  We are and you know, that's one of the efforts we've been working on here is a resolution
[3:04:27.280 --> 3:04:32.320]  with other states to make people aware of this North American Union and the the one
[3:04:32.320 --> 3:04:36.760]  world government is coming on, you know, people kind of made light of it for several years
[3:04:36.760 --> 3:04:40.320]  when all of what's the light starting to come on and they realize what's taking place.
[3:04:40.320 --> 3:04:45.000]  But it's difficult when some of these power gets that far down the road before you can
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:50.440]  get people to take action on it, but it's it's never too late until the doors close.
[3:04:50.440 --> 3:04:51.440]  So we need to work.
[3:04:51.440 --> 3:04:52.440]  That's right.
[3:04:52.440 --> 3:04:53.440]  And we turn the lights on.
[3:04:53.440 --> 3:04:55.880]  There were a million new voter cockroaches in there.
[3:04:55.880 --> 3:04:58.240]  Representative Jim Gas from Missouri, a great patriot.
[3:04:58.240 --> 3:05:03.360]  He'll be back with us after this break attention.

[3:05:25.320 --> 3:05:28.120]  Brain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[3:05:28.120 --> 3:05:31.280]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S. this fall?

[3:06:01.440 --> 3:06:07.100]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:06:07.100 --> 3:06:08.600]  against this country.
[3:06:08.600 --> 3:06:10.800]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:06:10.800 --> 3:06:12.400]  But who is the enemy?
[3:06:12.400 --> 3:06:13.400]  Bin Laden.
[3:06:13.400 --> 3:06:14.400]  This is his MO.
[3:06:14.400 --> 3:06:15.400]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:17.400]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:06:17.400 --> 3:06:21.880]  The fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[3:06:21.880 --> 3:06:25.160]  to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:06:25.160 --> 3:06:29.640]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:06:29.640 --> 3:06:31.800]  in and on the U.S.
[3:06:31.800 --> 3:06:35.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:35.400 --> 3:06:40.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:06:40.960 --> 3:06:44.760]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[3:06:44.760 --> 3:06:46.120]  much, much more.

[3:08:14.200 --> 3:08:19.260]  The United States, the jewel and the crown of this world, has been seized by offshore
[3:08:19.260 --> 3:08:25.160]  banks publicly, and if we don't address just how dire things are, just how out of control
[3:08:25.160 --> 3:08:30.680]  things are, with Newsweek saying we're now a socialist nation, we're all socialists now,
[3:08:30.680 --> 3:08:32.880]  we're not going to be able to turn this around.
[3:08:32.880 --> 3:08:37.720]  No more time to play patty cake or mince words, this is tyrannical world government at point
[3:08:37.720 --> 3:08:42.720]  blank range attacking our country and looting it, and all these scared people saying we'll
[3:08:42.720 --> 3:08:47.800]  do whatever you say, take our rights away, just give us money, give us jobs, when the
[3:08:47.800 --> 3:08:51.800]  very same crew filling Obama's administration, if you thought Bush was bad, are the very
[3:08:51.800 --> 3:08:55.480]  people in the Clinton administration who changed the banking rules to engage in this criminal
[3:08:55.480 --> 3:09:01.120]  looting, a bunch of made-offs basically, got representative guests on with us, and I appreciate
[3:09:01.120 --> 3:09:08.800]  Jim Guest joining us from Missouri, District 5, Republican, and I told you it was 8 states,
[3:09:08.800 --> 3:09:13.760]  I guess he's the 9th because they introduced it yesterday, it's up to 10 now and 20 more
[3:09:13.760 --> 3:09:19.920]  looking at it, why did you, I mean looking at things happening, run over the thought
[3:09:19.920 --> 3:09:24.840]  process of introducing this, where it's going, how we help you get this passed, I know I'm
[3:09:24.840 --> 3:09:30.400]  on a couple stations, like the fine station KCXL out of Kansas City, how do folks put
[3:09:30.400 --> 3:09:34.600]  pressure, because we know the foreign bankers are lobbying putting pressure against you
[3:09:34.600 --> 3:09:39.440]  guys to not save the republic, how do we help you, A, why do you do this, what's the main
[3:09:39.440 --> 3:09:42.600]  threats, B, how do we help you?
[3:09:42.600 --> 3:09:49.400]  The main reason is, I've got two grandchildren and I keep telling people I want them to grow
[3:09:49.400 --> 3:09:55.800]  up in the world I have, last thing I want to do is sit on the front step of my house
[3:09:55.800 --> 3:10:00.640]  and tell my two granddaughters I can remember back when America used to be free, I don't
[3:10:00.640 --> 3:10:05.120]  want them to ask me what it was like when America was free, that's one of the main reasons
[3:10:05.120 --> 3:10:09.400]  I'm working is for the children of future, so they've got a free country to live in,
[3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:13.640]  so they don't have to live under this tyrannical power that's coming down at us here, so in
[3:10:13.640 --> 3:10:18.200]  addition to that, you know, it's an obligation to the people of my constituents, they elected
[3:10:18.200 --> 3:10:21.760]  me to look out for them, to protect their rights and their freedoms, and that's what
[3:10:21.760 --> 3:10:28.160]  I'm doing, we've got a number of legislators around the country doing, so it's a concern
[3:10:28.160 --> 3:10:31.640]  today, it's more of a concern what's going to happen tomorrow if we don't take action
[3:10:31.640 --> 3:10:36.320]  today, and like you said, it's not tomorrow we need to take action, it's today because
[3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:41.120]  I keep saying we're at the crossroads and whatever freedoms and rights we lose, we're
[3:10:41.120 --> 3:10:43.240]  never going to get them back.
[3:10:43.240 --> 3:10:47.640]  On the campaign trail, a typical response was they always say, are you better off today
[3:10:47.640 --> 3:10:50.840]  than you were four years ago, I always ask them a question, do you have more or less
[3:10:50.840 --> 3:10:54.520]  rights today than you had four years ago, and people realize kind of a wake up call
[3:10:54.520 --> 3:11:00.360]  that slowly their rights are being taken away, and they can see the federal government's
[3:11:00.360 --> 3:11:05.080]  power grab taking over that, and you know, right now the federal government's trying
[3:11:05.080 --> 3:11:09.720]  to make people happy by putting a few dollars in their pocket and take more control of their
[3:11:09.720 --> 3:11:15.120]  lives, so that's why it's so important that we join here, and you know, how can people
[3:11:15.120 --> 3:11:21.520]  in Missouri help, pretty easy, but they find out who their legislators are on the committee,
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:28.720]  call their legislation, tell them to support this HCR 13, and I've also got a bill out
[3:11:28.720 --> 3:11:36.200]  there, House Bill 361 to reject the real ID, those both go in pretty close together, the
[3:11:36.200 --> 3:11:40.920]  real ID X and another tank for Big Brother to start watching us and controlling us and
[3:11:40.920 --> 3:11:46.800]  tracking our every movement, so those two bills are ones I'm working on today.
[3:11:46.800 --> 3:11:52.360]  Well, you know, people want solutions, this is it, this is the remedy in the Constitution
[3:11:52.360 --> 3:11:57.520]  next to the cartridge box, is the states, and you know, we don't have to go to that,
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:02.280]  for the states to say no and stand up and declare their sovereignty, and you know, we're
[3:12:02.280 --> 3:12:06.720]  now, as you said that earlier hours ago, this is the big crossroads, I totally agree with
[3:12:06.720 --> 3:12:12.240]  you, and the good news is the bad news, and I'll take the bad first, the bad news is,
[3:12:12.240 --> 3:12:16.080]  they've taken the gloves off, they're openly announcing world government FEMA camps, force
[3:12:16.080 --> 3:12:20.720]  compulsory service, national goon squads, carbon taxes that will shut down what's left
[3:12:20.720 --> 3:12:26.520]  of our industry, open borders, tracking and tracing, I mean, it was in Bloomberg yesterday
[3:12:26.520 --> 3:12:30.800]  that in the stimulus package is the total federalization of healthcare where doctors
[3:12:30.800 --> 3:12:35.160]  have to be told by the government what treatments they could do, and in there it says over 55,
[3:12:35.160 --> 3:12:39.960]  it says in the bill, they would deny this before, they said this is the British model,
[3:12:39.960 --> 3:12:43.280]  and we're just going to let old folks go blind, we're not going to give you the surgery, we're
[3:12:43.280 --> 3:12:46.880]  not going to give you brain surgery, you're going to have to wait, the young people will
[3:12:46.880 --> 3:12:53.760]  get the healthcare, actual rationing, I mean, so the good news is the bad news, the bad
[3:12:53.760 --> 3:12:58.680]  news is they're out in the open with classic tyranny and corruption and abuse and control,
[3:12:58.680 --> 3:13:02.920]  but that's also the good news, because it's so outrageous, how could we not beat this,
[3:13:02.920 --> 3:13:08.440]  why are they, so please speak to that, and why do you think government is going so hogwild
[3:13:08.440 --> 3:13:09.440]  right now?
[3:13:09.440 --> 3:13:15.080]  I think they've been successful in the past in stepping on this, and without people revolting,
[3:13:15.080 --> 3:13:20.600]  you know, I think maybe it is, as they say, time for another revolution here, that we've
[3:13:20.600 --> 3:13:25.680]  quietly gone along here until these last, I'm not sure, three or four years, they take
[3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:31.160]  away our rights and people kind of go along with it, and now they think that we won't
[3:13:31.160 --> 3:13:36.800]  put up any resistance, but then that's why it's so great, and I'm so glad to see so
[3:13:36.800 --> 3:13:42.720]  many states stepping forward now, I think I just feel like that they've got the upper
[3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:47.160]  hand, which they do have, and they're going to continue with it, so they feel that the
[3:13:47.160 --> 3:13:55.400]  states won't revolt, won't resist, and they've got the people in a state of fear out there
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:13:59.000]  that they're not going to have a job or not going to have any money, and the federal
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:04.720]  government gives them a few dollars to put in their pockets, and they'll owe them, and
[3:14:04.720 --> 3:14:08.440]  they'll be grateful for what they have, not realizing what they've lost in the meantime
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:09.640]  and getting to that point.
[3:14:09.640 --> 3:14:14.080]  Well, I agree with you, Ron Paul said a million times, and it's true historically, we could
[3:14:14.080 --> 3:14:18.640]  lose our whole economy tomorrow, but if we had liberty, we would rebuild it very quickly.
[3:14:18.640 --> 3:14:24.440]  Liberty is the engine of milk and honey, it is the engine of a great, free, beautiful
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:30.920]  city, socialism and corruption always devastates everything in its path, so can you speak to
[3:14:30.920 --> 3:14:31.920]  that?
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:34.480]  I mean, you talk about your grandchildren and children, I'm the same with three children,
[3:14:34.480 --> 3:14:38.760]  I mean, I look at them and I'm not worried about the fed setting me up or demonizing
[3:14:38.760 --> 3:14:44.120]  me or, you know, even killing me and I've had death threats, it's like, my God, there's
[3:14:44.120 --> 3:14:48.600]  not even a choice here, I have to fight these people to the bitter end, whatever the cost
[3:14:48.600 --> 3:14:53.680]  is, I am going to the end, and I can see with you and many other reps we're having on,
[3:14:53.680 --> 3:14:58.240]  I've never heard this type of commitment from Ron Paul and many others, there is now a commitment
[3:14:58.240 --> 3:15:05.120]  because it's clear our worst, you know, ideas on this were correct, it's even worse than
[3:15:05.120 --> 3:15:06.120]  we had thought.
[3:15:06.120 --> 3:15:12.480]  Yeah, you mentioned a good point there, some of us older people are willing to put up some
[3:15:12.480 --> 3:15:17.760]  resistance and I think they realize that and that's why they've sort of maybe let us alone
[3:15:17.760 --> 3:15:22.400]  and they're trying to indoctrinate the young children and the fact that they accept putting
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:28.520]  a biometric fingerprint or something or accepting a chip implanted in them, so they know that
[3:15:28.520 --> 3:15:32.080]  that's where they're going to start the young age and indoctrinating them to be under their
[3:15:32.080 --> 3:15:38.200]  control and that way they can form their habits from the very beginning and that's where our
[3:15:38.200 --> 3:15:43.560]  education process has to go to, make sure that the young people aware of the downfalls
[3:15:43.560 --> 3:15:49.120]  and the pits of the way to mouth there and get them to join our cause and we have some
[3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:53.560]  younger people getting involved here and I think they're the ones that realize that
[3:15:53.560 --> 3:15:58.840]  their future and their freedoms at stake here but then the socialism path that we're going
[3:15:58.840 --> 3:16:03.120]  down, it's picked up speed here, in fact I guess you'd say we're on the downhill slide
[3:16:03.120 --> 3:16:10.160]  right now and it's going to take an all out effort to get it stopped but then it's a price
[3:16:10.160 --> 3:16:14.240]  that we're going to have to pay to get it stopped out there because the price in the
[3:16:14.240 --> 3:16:16.800]  future would be many times greater than that.
[3:16:16.800 --> 3:16:21.000]  Well what would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:24.920]  They're going to give people a few hundred dollar tax credit but meanwhile you have trillions
[3:16:24.920 --> 3:16:30.880]  to offshore banks and fully federalize everything and I see these poor fools crying when Obama
[3:16:30.880 --> 3:16:36.160]  got elected saying my problems are all solved, I won't have to worry about bills ever again
[3:16:36.160 --> 3:16:39.560]  and then he went from hope and change, it's all going to be fixed too, it's going to go
[3:16:39.560 --> 3:16:44.400]  from a crisis to a catastrophe, do whatever I say or your life's basically over, is that
[3:16:44.400 --> 3:16:45.840]  not psychological terrorism?
[3:16:45.840 --> 3:16:53.280]  It is, they keep saying two months ago we had to do this bailout overnight or things
[3:16:53.280 --> 3:16:57.600]  were going to collapse, well we're at the point now that it hasn't helped and right
[3:16:57.600 --> 3:17:01.400]  now they're going to say we've got to get this money, we've got to spend it now and
[3:17:01.400 --> 3:17:09.760]  people are buying into that and they're accepting this few dollars as part of their socialism
[3:17:09.760 --> 3:17:15.080]  that they're heading down to so I'm really concerned about this government owning our
[3:17:15.080 --> 3:17:21.240]  banks and our financial institutions, I think that is another disaster in them making their
[3:17:21.240 --> 3:17:26.400]  big time and you know it's just a shame that our country got so out of hand here and we
[3:17:26.400 --> 3:17:30.040]  let these powers first of all be in control.
[3:17:30.040 --> 3:17:34.840]  Isn't that what the founding fathers and others like Andrew Jackson, all they did was
[3:17:34.840 --> 3:17:37.760]  fight the domination of bankers?
[3:17:37.760 --> 3:17:42.960]  Absolutely, you go back and look at the Federal Reserve system and the banks that they had
[3:17:42.960 --> 3:17:48.560]  here, they realized the dilemma that would happen if the government had a central bank
[3:17:48.560 --> 3:17:54.640]  and they had one for what, 20 years and then they abolished it and then what, in 1913 we
[3:17:54.640 --> 3:17:59.920]  started with the Federal Reserve system and a lot of people don't really understand the
[3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:03.560]  Federal Reserve system and when they see this in the Fed they think we're trying to end
[3:18:03.560 --> 3:18:09.000]  some federal government owned bank but in a little education they all the once they
[3:18:09.000 --> 3:18:14.400]  realize the cause of it and most of them are pretty outraged when they realize what's
[3:18:14.400 --> 3:18:19.040]  going on but it's difficult to educate so many people when they are, the only thing
[3:18:19.040 --> 3:18:22.280]  they're concerned with is a few dollars in their pocket today and they're not worrying
[3:18:22.280 --> 3:18:23.280]  about tomorrow.
[3:18:23.280 --> 3:18:29.680]  Well that's what we're doing is every Fed location late last year we went out and protested,
[3:18:29.680 --> 3:18:34.720]  the people are looking past the puppets, the Bushes, the Obamas to the real power structure
[3:18:34.720 --> 3:18:38.520]  and I think that's why the establishment's racing to finish their new world order because
[3:18:38.520 --> 3:18:40.640]  they know their time is short.
[3:18:40.640 --> 3:18:45.520]  You bet this, I know I had to admit sir, we years ago I kind of questioned this one world
[3:18:45.520 --> 3:18:50.120]  order but then when you start looking around they became more involved in it.
[3:18:50.120 --> 3:18:56.320]  You can see what's taking place here, you can see the European unions and the African
[3:18:56.320 --> 3:19:00.520]  union and the Med East union and the North American union taking place and all the once
[3:19:00.520 --> 3:19:05.240]  you see these pieces starting to come together and realize there are a few people that this
[3:19:05.240 --> 3:19:12.840]  one world order is quite feasible and it's heading towards that in a too fast a pace
[3:19:12.840 --> 3:19:14.840]  to make us comfortable.
[3:19:14.840 --> 3:19:18.200]  You're right, I want to do a final segment with you if you can, five more minutes after
[3:19:18.200 --> 3:19:23.240]  this break to talk about again on the ground how we get other states, how you recommend
[3:19:23.240 --> 3:19:27.280]  listeners introduce your bill, you know bring it to state legislators in Texas is going
[3:19:27.280 --> 3:19:34.000]  into session, other states because people are angry and this is I think one of the best
[3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:39.080]  solutions for those that don't know, this film the Money Masters covers the history
[3:19:39.080 --> 3:19:43.040]  of the international bankers, this is what Thomas Jefferson had to say, if the American
[3:19:43.040 --> 3:19:46.960]  people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation
[3:19:46.960 --> 3:19:50.880]  then by deflation the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children
[3:19:50.880 --> 3:19:54.920]  wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[3:19:54.920 --> 3:19:58.760]  The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it
[3:19:58.760 --> 3:20:06.520]  properly belongs Thomas Jefferson, it's a new year full of uncertainties, people are
[3:20:06.520 --> 3:20:12.240]  being laid off in record numbers, the price of food continues to rise and the economy

[3:37:42.640 --> 3:37:59.280]  like you but I'll have my staff talk to you after this after the time and then it cuts
[3:37:59.280 --> 3:38:04.080]  to the other club oh there's such a blessing to see you mr. president thank you for taking
[3:38:04.080 --> 3:38:13.280]  time out of your day oh thank you so much all right what's what's the question mr. president
[3:38:13.280 --> 3:38:17.400]  my name is Julio as a waiter I'm currently a student at Edison State College in my second
[3:38:17.400 --> 3:38:23.720]  semester and okay I've been at the same job which is McDonald's for four and a half years
[3:38:23.720 --> 3:38:28.440]  because of the fact that I can't find another job now with the fact that I've been there
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:34.040]  for as long as I've been there do you have any plan or any idea of making one that has
[3:38:34.040 --> 3:38:38.560]  been there for a long time received any better benefits than what they've already received
[3:38:38.560 --> 3:38:45.440]  well I tell you what first of all a couple things I'd like to say number one the fact
[3:38:45.440 --> 3:38:51.080]  that you are working as hard as you're working at a job that I know doesn't always pay as
[3:38:51.080 --> 3:38:57.240]  well as some other jobs I think that's a source of pride for you that shows that that you're
[3:38:57.240 --> 3:39:05.960]  doing the right thing now the second thing is is that you will actually benefit from
[3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:09.920]  the tax breaks that we're talking about so you'll be able to keep a little bit extra money
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:16.680]  because we're going to offset your payroll tax that's going to help oh I don't I assume
[3:39:16.680 --> 3:39:21.840]  that you're not getting health care through your job and so one of the things that we
[3:39:21.840 --> 3:39:27.080]  want to do is reform the health care system so that you will have access to health care
[3:39:27.080 --> 3:39:32.320]  in pause in the subsection that old lady he was just talking to she won't get health
[3:39:32.320 --> 3:39:36.480]  care I read the quotes Bloomberg yesterday of the people pushing the bill and what's
[3:39:36.480 --> 3:39:39.600]  in there it says well if you're going blind and you're old you're gonna have to just go
[3:39:39.600 --> 3:39:44.160]  blind that's what's supposed to happen only the young people get health care and what
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:47.720]  they're doing is playing the young off against the old as if everybody couldn't have it
[3:39:47.720 --> 3:39:51.480]  the bankers weren't stealing everything and they're taking over health care so you got
[3:39:51.480 --> 3:39:57.320]  this guy oh just I'm begging you oh lord like he's gone oh save me it's I mean just they
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:01.480]  have put their total faith in this guy and we know he's betraying them with the international
[3:40:01.480 --> 3:40:06.360]  banks we know they're openly setting up a global bank to tax the industry that's left
[3:40:06.360 --> 3:40:09.480]  from the companies that are left we know he said get ready for austerity get ready for
[3:40:09.480 --> 3:40:14.480]  tough times he told that old lady was a lot of people in your position man she's basically
[3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:19.120]  homeless you heard I remember bathroom or kitchen and it's going to get worse and worse
[3:40:19.120 --> 3:40:27.680]  and worse and worse let's go back to it of course now it better be a good one go ahead
[3:40:27.680 --> 3:40:32.040]  oh there's such a blessing to see you mr president thank you for taking time out of your day all
[3:40:32.040 --> 3:40:41.120]  right that's enough thank you so much are you good up to the end of you want it's just
[3:40:41.120 --> 3:40:45.320]  it's just horrible it it's absolutely horrific to see this happening let's go to your phone
[3:40:45.320 --> 3:40:51.240]  calls let's talk to John in Ohio first because he disagrees okay John you're up first yeah
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:55.200]  you know I always have to tell you where I'm coming from you know I've publicized your
[3:40:55.200 --> 3:41:02.720]  your videos on a national radio and I support and I'm usually inspired by what you say but
[3:41:02.720 --> 3:41:10.360]  on other occasions horrified and I think in some ways you're very contradictory in terms
[3:41:10.360 --> 3:41:18.680]  of believing the most extreme fascist elements of the military industrial complex propaganda
[3:41:18.680 --> 3:41:24.040]  concerning communism and socialism I know you know better because sometimes you ambivalent
[3:41:24.040 --> 3:41:28.400]  and and the news week claiming that this is socialism when they know it's exactly the
[3:41:28.400 --> 3:41:33.000]  opposite of social socialism is the marriage of the government would stop I'm gonna let
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:39.480]  you talk but I want you to stop there is no socialism there is no communism there is
[3:41:39.480 --> 3:41:44.680]  no fascism there's tyranny that always comes through big government because corrupt people
[3:41:44.680 --> 3:41:49.480]  will get control of it and use it to rob from people because men aren't angels and there's
[3:41:49.480 --> 3:41:53.720]  liberty now we can debate what will bring liberty but it's decentralization local control
[3:41:53.720 --> 3:42:00.560]  of course a stop stop of course I said the news week headline where the hand you know
[3:42:00.560 --> 3:42:04.640]  the red states the blue states are shaking hands and it says we're all socialists now
[3:42:04.640 --> 3:42:10.680]  of course this isn't socialism and of course this isn't true capitalism with these foreign
[3:42:10.680 --> 3:42:15.480]  offshore banks stealing and robbing this is looting this is piracy and so they're gonna
[3:42:15.480 --> 3:42:21.560]  give literally about 2% of the money to the poor people while taking their jobs and making
[3:42:21.560 --> 3:42:26.320]  them dependent and give 98% of the foreign banks so it's not socialism you're right
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:32.800]  about that but what we have is also not what you call capitalism this is crony capitalism
[3:42:32.800 --> 3:42:39.040]  robbing stealing whatever you want to call it so so so so you're saying you know that
[3:42:39.040 --> 3:42:44.000]  that I'm putting out right wing fascist information notice that both parties do the same thing
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:48.360]  you know what you just don't get it sir because you believe the left-right paradigm go ahead
[3:42:48.360 --> 3:42:53.640]  and make your point I'll shut up I don't believe that you know I've even before you were criticizing
[3:42:53.640 --> 3:42:58.760]  over Obama for being a fascist I was doing it so I'm not in that in that Democrat left
[3:42:58.760 --> 3:43:04.600]  that Democrat Republican paradigm it's right wing and disguised right wing and undisguised
[3:43:04.600 --> 3:43:10.560]  right wing it's not left right and and some of the people that I've heard you on on today
[3:43:10.560 --> 3:43:18.120]  now you know Jack McClam says some important things about the the war and and Tillman and
[3:43:18.120 --> 3:43:26.240]  the rest of it but he comes out and he says that any that these people are are are communist
[3:43:26.240 --> 3:43:31.600]  that are anyone who are who who's in the elite who have been involved in some of the most
[3:43:31.600 --> 3:43:36.720]  anti-soviet anti-communist operations that is going to discredit I think much of the
[3:43:36.720 --> 3:43:41.720]  wonderful things you're doing I think have some of the people in Hollywood are fearful
[3:43:41.720 --> 3:43:47.120]  others may be embarrassed like Jesse Ventura for instance when you had this man on from
[3:43:47.120 --> 3:43:53.560]  a Glenn Spence I believe that many of these people are are absolutely neo cons and their
[3:43:53.560 --> 3:43:58.280]  attitude towards war and the rest of it I've heard many of them they are total supporters
[3:43:58.280 --> 3:44:03.640]  of our neoconism Larry Platt he says very good things about keeping your gun rights
[3:44:03.640 --> 3:44:09.480]  the same time he made the comment that he supports the paramilitary desk was in Guatemala
[3:44:09.480 --> 3:44:15.120]  that are only a million people let me stop you let me stop you we are proud of the second
[3:44:15.120 --> 3:44:19.840]  amendment issue because it's the only real gun lobby we got sir you know you can't judge
[3:44:19.840 --> 3:44:26.400]  me by everything my guests have said or done but but let's just expand on here did the
[3:44:26.400 --> 3:44:31.400]  Soviets allow citizens to own guns did the communist Chinese loud known guns look at
[3:44:31.400 --> 3:44:36.760]  the fruits of what you call communism now if we had a bunch of angels running things
[3:44:36.760 --> 3:44:42.880]  for communism work no because that's not how humans operate we want to be different we
[3:44:42.880 --> 3:44:49.440]  want to identify as different people look it's a philosophical divide I'm against torture
[3:44:49.440 --> 3:44:54.720]  I'm against more wars I'm against drafts I'm against police state I'm against federal
[3:44:54.720 --> 3:45:03.260]  control you get rid of those the new order falls apart you know see I'm not a fan of
[3:45:03.260 --> 3:45:08.600]  Fidel Castro I'm not a fan of Barack Obama or George W. Bush I understand that it's not
[3:45:08.600 --> 3:45:15.720]  Iran good US bad US you know you know good Iran bad it's that it's the nature of man
[3:45:15.720 --> 3:45:19.680]  and corruption now who's the big empire the new world order who are we facing the new
[3:45:19.680 --> 3:45:25.680]  world order look I'll give you one more minute I got to the other colors go ahead well it
[3:45:25.680 --> 3:45:32.200]  seems like three or four times a day you've got to bring up and I'm not a particular brief
[3:45:32.200 --> 3:45:37.920]  for the deformed version of communism in the Soviet Union or China I don't think they had
[3:45:37.920 --> 3:45:43.640]  real communism but I believe we're subjected to massive lies massive exaggerations about
[3:45:43.640 --> 3:45:48.760]  what happened there if you'll check on Google lies concerning the Soviet Union you'll find
[3:45:48.760 --> 3:45:52.520]  that many of these things that we believe about the carnage and the rest of it the numbers
[3:45:52.520 --> 3:46:01.080]  of people killed China I talked it by Nazis Nazis gobbles hey China was not the CIA sir
[3:46:01.080 --> 3:46:06.760]  China says Mao killed 80 million people the official numbers in the west or 60 are you
[3:46:06.760 --> 3:46:12.040]  saying that didn't happen under Mao don't you know the mortal enemies of the new regime
[3:46:12.040 --> 3:46:16.480]  in China and Russia where the mortal enemies of the former regime they will say anything
[3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:21.720]  because they actually for instance of the elson actually bought drinks and troops up and
[3:46:21.720 --> 3:46:27.080]  killed the old guard in the in their own doom of parliament the elected people so to believe
[3:46:27.080 --> 3:46:31.960]  the the new regime which was the mortal enemy of the former regime is not that any kind of
[3:46:31.960 --> 3:46:39.520]  let me ask you this what's your view of Putin Putin is a yeah I believe he's a he's a nationalist
[3:46:39.520 --> 3:46:46.640]  he's a try to re-reverse some of the a total of stooging for the U.S. military industrial
[3:46:46.640 --> 3:46:52.520]  complex down under under Al Jeltsin but he has his own his own abuses of course he does
[3:46:52.520 --> 3:46:59.080]  but at the same time he's resisting I think some of the policies and of the of the United
[3:46:59.080 --> 3:47:03.840]  States military industrial complex which I think is is good to that limited extent that's
[3:47:03.840 --> 3:47:10.480]  what that's what I believe about him all right thanks for the call let's go ahead and who's
[3:47:10.480 --> 3:47:17.320]  up next year my call is just refreshed Elliott in Ohio you're on the air yeah I'll show
[3:47:17.320 --> 3:47:26.680]  you doing good so I got a question and I got an idea for a solution my question is let's
[3:47:26.680 --> 3:47:33.880]  just say everything like let's just say it is the worst case scenario everything crashes
[3:47:33.880 --> 3:47:40.360]  and Mad Max scenario happens what's what in your opinion do we do as patriots if we are
[3:47:40.360 --> 3:47:46.080]  prepared we got the guns the gold the water atmospheric water generators and all the food
[3:47:46.080 --> 3:47:51.400]  and all that where do we start from there well first first we have to wait while they
[3:47:51.400 --> 3:47:55.240]  let everything break down so then people beg for total tyranny and they plan to let it
[3:47:55.240 --> 3:47:59.000]  all fall apart it looks like they're going to do those so then after six months a year
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:02.880]  they come in and people are begging for it you have to be waiting for that next phase
[3:48:02.880 --> 3:48:06.400]  to not be reeducated to not go to the FEMA camp to not go along with them and if enough
[3:48:06.400 --> 3:48:13.200]  people say no to whatever extent whatever means necessary then the whole thing will fail and
[3:48:13.200 --> 3:48:19.680]  then we could reorganize at the state level and then reconvene the the republic you know
[3:48:19.680 --> 3:48:23.880]  we need organizations now at the state level read led by state representatives and others
[3:48:23.880 --> 3:48:27.560]  who talk openly about the new world order who say they're bankrupting things by design
[3:48:27.560 --> 3:48:32.600]  that the states need to organize now against the globalist that message has to go out now
[3:48:32.600 --> 3:48:36.360]  and then the globalist may stop and put in the economy they could stop it right now they
[3:48:36.360 --> 3:48:39.280]  destroyed Congress they could say everything was fine everything would be fine because
[3:48:39.280 --> 3:48:44.240]  it's fiat so we have to explain people that a the globalist are doing this by design to
[3:48:44.240 --> 3:48:47.520]  bring in world government which they meant they're doing now no more debating it that
[3:48:47.520 --> 3:48:52.320]  be if we have the states and organizations all with one voice start screen bloody murder
[3:48:52.320 --> 3:48:57.480]  they may back off and stop or regardless we go deeper down the road we keep spreading
[3:48:57.480 --> 3:49:04.520]  the word so we have a fighting chance right okay so my solution is like i've been college
[3:49:04.520 --> 3:49:09.720]  right now at the university of Cincinnati and for all all of you out in college you
