[00:00.000 --> 00:22.960]  Well, there's a battle over free speech going on in Washington right now.
[00:22.960 --> 00:23.960]  Good.
[00:23.960 --> 00:24.960]  We're for free speech.
[00:24.960 --> 00:30.920]  The question is, are the people who claim they're defending free speech actually defenders
[00:30.920 --> 00:31.920]  of speech?
[00:31.920 --> 00:32.920]  Hashtag Basta.
[00:32.920 --> 00:33.920]  Whatever that means.
[00:33.920 --> 00:43.680]  Well, anyway, we'll investigate the assault on free speech after the break.
[00:43.680 --> 00:47.240]  In the past couple of days, you've heard a lot of huffing and puffing about free speech
[00:47.240 --> 00:51.800]  and freedom of the press and how those freedoms are currently imperiled by the White House.
[00:51.800 --> 00:57.800]  And to be clear, we are for free speech, unfettered, absolute free speech, the kind
[00:57.800 --> 01:01.240]  of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment and ratified consistently by the Supreme
[01:01.240 --> 01:02.240]  Court.
[01:02.240 --> 01:06.400]  We've defended that kind of free speech almost every night here for the past two years.
[01:06.400 --> 01:10.640]  Many others, mostly on the left, have attacked speech.
[01:10.640 --> 01:12.960]  So we know who's for free speech and who's against it.
[01:12.960 --> 01:17.600]  And we cannot help but notice that some of free speech's greatest enemies are now posing
[01:17.600 --> 01:22.320]  as its defenders, all of a sudden, take CNN, for example.
[01:22.320 --> 01:26.800]  It was CNN that almost single-handedly led the campaign to have broadcaster Alex Jones
[01:26.800 --> 01:31.880]  banished from the Internet on the grounds that they didn't like what Jones had to say.
[01:31.880 --> 01:34.240]  Ultimately, CNN succeeded in doing that.
[01:34.240 --> 01:38.760]  The network convinced every major tech platform to ban Jones in its outlet, Infowars.
[01:38.760 --> 01:44.520]  You don't have to like Alex Jones to see that as a terrifying loss for free speech
[01:44.520 --> 01:46.240]  because it was exactly that.
[01:46.240 --> 01:49.520]  But CNN was not done trying to silence its critics.
[01:49.520 --> 01:54.080]  Last year, the cable network threatened an anonymous Reddit user for creating an anti-CNN
[01:54.080 --> 01:55.080]  meme.
[01:55.080 --> 02:17.240]  CNN threatened to expose its identity.
