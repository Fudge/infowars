[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  now because he just continues to really break national stories of import and he
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  always has information to add on other big news stories concerning the Delta
[01:00.000 --> 01:08.000]  Force and Dick Cheney's secret assassination squads now prisonplanet.com
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  years ago published stories dealing with the fact that there were CIA and
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  Israeli hit teams operating inside and outside of the United States and inside
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  friendly countries in the West this is finally becoming a big national scandal
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  so Madison will pop in for about 20 minutes starting in the next hour and

[01:48.000 --> 01:57.000]  global enslavement and then we have a individual coming on who was on local
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  and national news because he tried to fly an American flag upside down at his Italian
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  restaurant because the city wouldn't give him a liquor license when they
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  promised they would to build the Italian restaurant and the police came and
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  stole his flag and said it was disrespectful no it's you that disrespect
[02:18.000 --> 02:23.000]  the first amendment that flag symbolizes and the flag was being flown upside down
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.000]  because if you don't know this country's in distress I don't want some of what
[02:28.000 --> 02:34.000]  you're smoking because it's made you dumbered in a box of rocks and on the
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  news people show up cutting the flag down in front of police and not getting in
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  trouble so he just keeps running flags up that gets stolen by people screaming and
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  yelling and saying it's disrespectful you got to love all these good old boys
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  coming up and stealing his flag see they don't care if the bill of rights and
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  constitutions being killed they don't care if the country's being killed they
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  don't care if offshore banks have seized the nation and are stolen more than
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000]  14.8 trillion the last seven months they don't care if the government
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  socializing all health care seizing major corporations federalizing
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  everything under the sun America is dying no they just care about that flag
[03:11.000 --> 03:21.000]  you could wrap a wheelbarrow of cyanide in an American flag and they would run
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  up and start gobbling it and putting it in their iced tea thinking it was
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  sugar if it was wrapped in an American flag you could bash one of these good
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  old boys kids brains out right in front of them and if you did it with an
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  American flag hammer they would get on their knees and thank you and scream at
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  their child's dead body seeing how dare you you deserve to have your veins
[03:42.000 --> 03:49.000]  brains bashed out by an American flag mallet you could dress up an American
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  flag outfit I guess come to their house and beat them over the head with a
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  baseball bat rob them steal them set their house on fire and they'd thank you

[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  India the issue 1.2 billion new biometric ID cards
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  that's under the world treaty
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000]  agreements for a planetary ID card owned and run by the private
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.000]  central banks world health organization reports

[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  inoculations in the fall and winter we'll see if they get away with that though
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  certainly saying they're planning that that is coming up
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  concerns over superbugs in food supply MSNBC the meat
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  you buy could be contaminated with drug resistant MRSA
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  their answer spray the meat
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  down with live viruses that eat the bacteria
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.000]  which then causes its own problems they soak a lot of the
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  meat you eat for at least five years since it was approved in vaccines
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  live vaccines but that's not an environmental
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  problem
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  well they call it a vaccine they breed the viruses in these big vaccine production
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.000]  tanks a lot of other viruses that end up breeding in there as well and they spray it on your meat
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  oh I'm sorry that's a side issue
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  I don't believe me in fact guys go ahead and just Google that and print it for me
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.000]  bacteria eating viruses sprayed on meat or viruses sprayed on meat
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  AP and Reuters I want to I don't want to just mention that and have folks that are conditioned
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  out there say I'm lying I want you to know they're spraying
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  very powerful viruses on your food
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  side issue US failed to detect Russian submarines
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  that launched missiles this is out of Indo-Asia
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  service the United States was unable to detect the presence of Russian strategic
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  submarines in the Arctic before they test launched two ballistic missiles at Russian intelligence
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  source said Wednesday
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  Mayners invited to become track
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  your car getting pigs is out of the Portland press herald
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  and the main Sunday telegram
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  Texas is testing this and they have a local trial program with
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  they were they pay morons to take the satellite tracker box in their car to tax them
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  by the mile and Obama says that's the plan to get you ready for
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.000]  taxing by the mile I warned people 14 years ago about it and they laughed at me when I read
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  federal documents I guess you're going to be laughing when that box is in your car tracking you
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  but since the media said it didn't exist
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  I'll have they'll be people while they're being taxed by the mile saying it doesn't exist
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  it's all part of being slaves I guess
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  there's a story here out of the Denver examiner saying it's
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  a mental illness to believe that 9-11 could be an inside job that's right
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  if you believe the Gulf of Tonkin was staged to be classified or Operation Northwood
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  declassified or Operation Ajax declassified or
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  all the other programs if you know about
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  the
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  NATO option or Operation Gladio declassified with the U.S. government
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  stages terror attacks or if you read the 2004 Army manual
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  on how to stage terror attacks I mean it's an official manual
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  how to stage terror attacks I guess I'm mentally ill

[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  super bank keep saying there's no plan for RFID and all the money
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  keep saying there's no world ID card keep saying they don't take babies DNA
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  at birth which they now admit they do for DNA databases
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  just keep laughing at us while everybody finds out your liars
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  by design trying to keep them in the dark just totally discredit
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  yourselves mainstream media keep the hit pieces coming
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  because people have memories and they've heard this show and read
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.000]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and all the other sites and they know we were right
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  and they know your liars so just keep trying
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.000]  your salvos the arrows you launch the missiles you launch don't
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  just bounce off no no they sink home in your
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  breast see you firemen us they bounce
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.000]  right back on you and you don't have the breast place the breast
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  plate of truth I love it
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  I mean there may be 10 20% of the public that are totally brain dead and I believe anything you tell
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  them and are literally drooling on prozac and fluoride and drugs
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  but the general public when you do when you write articles like this
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  just totally wakes up to you so keep it up good job
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  barock slams

[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  electroshock people that believe in 9 11 truth they have it as a designated
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  mental illness

[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  continuing here
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  this is probably one of the most important articles of the day
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  this is out of Bloomberg today
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  Obama opened a partisan vote on health care overhaul
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  age say president barock Obama
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  only on democrats to push health care legislation to the US congress
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.000]  if republican opposition doesn't yield soon to the president's
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  top advisor say
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  to pass amnesty they don't need any republican votes they have a
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  supermajority 60 votes in the senate
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  they have a giant majority in the house they have the president
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.000]  and so that's why they're ramming through the gun control the victim disarmament

[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  now in the senate into the first amendment as we know it
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.000]  of course we're just going to ignore their criminal edict you can declare all day we're slaves
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  you can declare we have no first amendment just like the supreme court said blacks weren't humans
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  we're just going to ignore it
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  you mean you can tell me that Winnie the Pooh is the president you can pass a law saying that
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  well that just shows you sure a bunch of illegitimate crooks
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  the problem is through the guilds
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  through the state agencies through the lawyers and through the doctors and through the people
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.000]  that follow the orders of the bureaucracy they can seize
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  health care and they are seizing and they're going to jack up
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  taxes on all Americans to pay for it and break Obama's pledge
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  he's already said oh that's not really a pledge
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  we said we'd try no you pledged
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  but if we can hold
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  out until the midterm elections
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  they may lose control of the house or senate
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  see as bad as bush was he was just carrying the ball for the new world order
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  so that made republicans very unpopular and then the public puts in
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  democrats trying to rebel against the new world order and they just got the other
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  arm of the new world order and so people will figure that out and put republicans in
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.000]  but that will still create some gridlock some separation of powers
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  everything the founding father said was good everything the mainstream media decries
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  and says is bad and so we can just hold out a year and a half
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.000]  this whole agenda
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  may grind to a halt kind of like globalist expansion has ground to a halt
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  all across the planet EU expansion is failing
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.000]  they're not invincible
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  and when in just four and a half
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.000]  five months in office Barack H. Obama has lost
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.000]  massive massive massive support
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.000]  his approval rating is plunging his own base is figuring out
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.000]  he's a congenital liar reading off teleprompters
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  and as long as we don't let the media make this a left right issue we can discredit
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  the entire system and continue that 11% approval rating for
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  congress and then the entire government will be a dead duck an illegitimate
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  lame duck
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.000]  broke back system that'll just flail around and kind of collapse
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.000]  like the Soviet Union and let me tell you something that's a lot better
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  than them getting energized and being able to carry out their scientific
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.000]  dictatorship yeah we better hope it just
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  collapses but you see they know by creating
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  the crisis it kind of creates a gravitational political
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.000]  pull where they're the only big lifeboat
[18:21.000 --> 18:25.000]  even if when you climb onto the lifeboat the flesh eating zombies of government
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  and their camp followers feed on you they know
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  that by imploding things they can always kind of direct the next
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  crisis into the next crisis and consolidate power I mean it's irrevocable
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  seizing the major car dealerships and now
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  openly announcing well it's in Bloomberg
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  today that Obama is now saying
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  okay in the next bailout remember the first
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.000]  bailout unlimited power and money and funds to the private
[18:57.000 --> 19:01.000]  reserve six seven months in it was 14.8 trillion we haven't gotten
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  new numbers in two months I would guess it'll be 20 trillion next time we get numbers
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.000]  20 trillion but 14.8
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  bigger than the GDP
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.000]  in half a year roughly
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.000]  you see
[19:21.000 --> 19:25.000]  now he's saying oh we need money again
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.000]  why it's not just people that lost their jobs it's not just subprime mortgages all these other people
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  are losing their houses and going bankrupt oh they have a plan
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  the federal government's going to own your house now and you're going to pay rent to the federal government
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  that's Bloomberg today White House announcement I mean
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  you want to be sharecroppers you want to be slaves living out in the barn folks
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  we are see they've created a debt
[19:49.000 --> 19:53.000]  system that's a black hole where there's more debt
[19:53.000 --> 19:57.000]  than there is actual jobs or money to pay it they want to bankrupt you
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.000]  and drive you into their government arms
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  this is Alex Jones with important news I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's
[20:05.000 --> 20:09.000]  fast approaching a storm that will affect you and everybody you know here's the story
[20:09.000 --> 20:13.000]  the current administration is committed to nationalizing health care giving 40 million new people
[20:13.000 --> 20:17.000]  free care now here's the bad news the current system will almost be immediately
[20:17.000 --> 20:21.000]  overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures Medicare and
[20:21.000 --> 20:25.000]  Medicaid are already bankrupt many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened
[20:25.000 --> 20:29.000]  by the prospect of forced procedures all this is creating a perfect storm
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.000]  that should create unimaginable shortages in the health care services
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.000]  folks it's time to be prepared for the worst our friends at solutions from science
[20:37.000 --> 20:41.000]  have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make
[20:41.000 --> 20:45.000]  powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home it's called
[20:45.000 --> 20:49.000]  herbal preparations and natural therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind

[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  a current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  to increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply without
[21:35.000 --> 21:39.000]  equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve
[21:39.000 --> 21:43.000]  strength and stability I recommend a conservative portion of all investments
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments
[21:47.000 --> 21:51.000]  currently have been driven by debt gold on its own has held value

[24:47.640 --> 24:54.440]  in a managed society just like the Soviet Union and you will be so poor you
[24:54.440 --> 24:57.840]  will have no rights that you will not even be allowed to have children this
[24:57.840 --> 25:04.640]  is the official model by the way there's now been a statement put out
[25:04.640 --> 25:13.360]  officially by the president Obama's science czar John Holdren the Catholic
[25:13.360 --> 25:18.120]  news agency one of the biggest in the world is anti eugenics and abortion so
[25:18.120 --> 25:22.760]  they asked the White House about it and he responded and said our eco science is
[25:22.760 --> 25:29.120]  a textbook see I describe it as a textbook it's a policy textbook and they
[25:29.120 --> 25:36.840]  said this was just for free and open debate so that's coming up I'm gonna
[25:36.840 --> 25:41.680]  break down eugenics coming up later I want to continue with the news now and
[25:41.680 --> 25:49.440]  I do want to fire the toll-free number out for you to join us it's 1-800-259-9231
[25:49.440 --> 26:01.000]  1-800-259-9231 and I specifically want to talk about eugenics I specifically
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.800]  want to discuss socialized health care because that's part and parcel of it
[26:04.800 --> 26:08.640]  the bioethicist the eugenicist have said a hundred years ago they wanted
[26:08.640 --> 26:13.240]  socialized government health care socialized compulsory government
[26:13.240 --> 26:18.720]  education basically everything you see in the communist manifesto you see the
[26:18.720 --> 26:22.920]  big banks and the rich families in Europe on record British intelligence
[26:22.920 --> 26:28.000]  finance marks and Ingalls and others as a way to finance a revolution later in
[26:28.000 --> 26:35.760]  Russia to bring down their cousins the czars to bring in a managed ordered test
[26:35.760 --> 26:41.080]  eugenics society so you got to have a central bank that controls the money you
[26:41.080 --> 26:46.200]  got to have government education compulsory government health care
[26:46.200 --> 26:51.240]  progressive income tax I mean read the communist manifesto it is America but
[26:51.240 --> 26:55.120]  it isn't communist in what you think you know they advertise communism as well
[26:55.120 --> 26:59.600]  meaning liberal revolutionaries running around you know trying to overthrow the
[26:59.600 --> 27:06.920]  capitalist no the capitalist the monopoly men the monopoly capitalist they
[27:06.920 --> 27:10.680]  want communist and socialist and fascist command and control vertically

[33:10.640 --> 33:15.080]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time we're here live
[33:15.080 --> 33:20.360]  back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time thank you so much for
[33:20.360 --> 33:26.320]  joining us I'm Alex Jones your host all right for the last week or so I have
[33:26.320 --> 33:33.080]  been focusing a lot of our airtime on eugenics and for years I've realized
[33:33.080 --> 33:36.520]  this is the central issue that's why two and a half years ago I produced the
[33:36.520 --> 33:43.040]  film in-game blueprint for global enslavement which has been the number
[33:43.040 --> 33:49.880]  one documentary on Amazon.com it has claimed the number one spot for a full
[33:49.880 --> 33:59.120]  week which is exciting to know that people are interested in this information
[33:59.120 --> 34:03.960]  it claimed the number one spot a few years ago my point is is that it's
[34:03.960 --> 34:07.200]  certainly having an effect and it's been number one on Google and YouTube you can
[34:07.200 --> 34:12.400]  watch it for free or get the DVD at infowars.com and have viewing parties and
[34:12.400 --> 34:17.040]  show everybody you know because we live in a managed society there is a global
[34:17.040 --> 34:22.040]  architecture the United Nations the IMF the World Bank the OECD these
[34:22.040 --> 34:27.760]  international regulatory bodies the transatlantic treaty organization is
[34:27.760 --> 34:32.640]  publicly merging the European Union with the American Union and the Asian Union
[34:32.640 --> 34:39.960]  in the Pacific Atlantic trade agreement that's all covered in in-game I've
[34:39.960 --> 34:43.080]  even got Bush at a White House press conference saying they were merging the
[34:43.080 --> 34:46.960]  EU with the American Union judicial watch sued and got their internal
[34:46.960 --> 34:50.440]  documents how they've already merged the nations and how they would use carbon
[34:50.440 --> 34:55.120]  taxes to fund the world government that's why I can make a film two and a half
[34:55.120 --> 34:58.800]  years ago and say they're gonna bankrupt the world economy and announce a new
[34:58.800 --> 35:02.640]  bank of the world that will pay our carbon taxes to and the carbon taxes
[35:02.640 --> 35:07.880]  are meant to extinct human industry and jobs and have a post-industrial world
[35:07.880 --> 35:13.120]  where where the banks own the planet and and have command destruction and
[35:13.120 --> 35:17.600]  destroy the economy by designed to bankrupt you and make you dependent on
[35:17.600 --> 35:25.240]  government force you on to government jobs or welfare this is social
[35:25.240 --> 35:28.800]  engineering shutting down the family farms and ranches with the animal ID
[35:28.800 --> 35:34.400]  and the premises ID with fines and fees and regulations on small farms and
[35:34.400 --> 35:39.280]  ranches that aren't on the big agribusiness farms and ranches the best
[35:39.280 --> 35:46.240]  example is a $21 tag for a $5 chicken at market you got 10 chickens you got to
[35:46.240 --> 35:52.520]  have the $20 tag you got a thousand chickens the tag is only a dollar per
[35:52.520 --> 36:01.120]  chicken you have a million chickens it's only one tag per giant facility holding
[36:01.120 --> 36:05.880]  tens of thousands of chickens see that'll automatically shut down any
[36:05.880 --> 36:10.840]  competition and for all intents and purposes it already is I was reading
[36:10.840 --> 36:18.280]  yesterday about Walmart got the federal law changed two years ago for over 80
[36:18.280 --> 36:26.920]  years since mr. Sinclair wrote the jungle exposing people falling into
[36:26.920 --> 36:31.040]  sausage makers and meat grinders and the Rockefeller selling milk that was
[36:31.040 --> 36:38.480]  part talcum powder and babies getting brain damage from it wrote that almost a
[36:38.480 --> 36:43.280]  hundred years ago but that book cause changes 80 90 years ago depending on the
[36:43.280 --> 36:52.840]  federal or state law to where you couldn't inject water into beef or
[36:52.840 --> 36:57.640]  poultry or pork well Walmart went in the lobby and got the law changed so that
[36:57.640 --> 37:04.360]  they could add 10 15 20% water with injectors into the beef and poultry and
[37:04.360 --> 37:09.800]  pork you buy but they also have the regulations written were only it can
[37:09.800 --> 37:14.360]  only be done a certain way in a big expensive industrial process so nobody
[37:14.360 --> 37:20.040]  else but the big three meat packers can do it thus shutting down other small
[37:20.040 --> 37:24.880]  packers see it's a monopoly game and you say what does this have to do with
[37:24.880 --> 37:31.680]  eugenics that's my whole point I tried to do research last night I even
[37:31.680 --> 37:37.200]  research I tried to pull together my research scores of folders piles of
[37:37.200 --> 37:43.640]  documents hundreds of news articles just in the last month for sterilization
[37:43.640 --> 37:48.440]  worldwide the Chinese government being funded by the US government to kidnap
[37:48.440 --> 37:52.480]  people who have children to take their children and sell them on the open market
[37:52.480 --> 37:58.720]  BBC AP Reuters no one stopping them babies being taken and being killed
[37:58.720 --> 38:03.800]  having their flesh melted down for cosmetics mainstream news mobile
[38:03.800 --> 38:13.520]  execution vans I just started realizing it's just incredibly out of control our
[38:13.520 --> 38:18.360]  entire society the international regulations the international
[38:18.360 --> 38:23.640]  standardization we are living under global government under global
[38:23.640 --> 38:29.160]  regulation and the fortune 500 are given all the big global contracts in the
[38:29.160 --> 38:32.640]  national contracts under global government and so they're all globalist
[38:32.640 --> 38:36.880]  you pick up any corporate document any corporate magazine it's all about how to
[38:36.880 --> 38:40.600]  run the New World Order how to be part of the New World Order how to comply with
[38:40.600 --> 38:44.920]  the New World Order how to be advanced in the New World Order you've got a
[38:44.920 --> 38:52.840]  superclass of 6,000 New World Order gophers minions legates according to
[38:52.840 --> 38:56.640]  the Washington Post own article titled superclass written by the head of the
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.720]  Kissinger Group Roth Cop who we had on the show and he admitted yeah there's a
[39:01.720 --> 39:06.640]  world government run by 6,000 managers for a handful of families less than 20
[39:06.640 --> 39:16.760]  families it's all admitted 6,000 managers over the major nations they have a
[39:16.760 --> 39:22.200]  global playbook it's public it's world government and then they admit the
[39:22.200 --> 39:27.160]  world government is to lower carbon footprint have one child policies then
[39:27.160 --> 39:32.320]  licenses to even have one kid giant prisons everywhere CPS taking everyone's
[39:32.320 --> 39:36.480]  children who have an unauthorized birth for sterilizations of the air and
[39:36.480 --> 39:40.560]  water Bill Gates openly with his dad running Planned Parenthood saying and
[39:40.560 --> 39:44.880]  funding over a hundred billion he's given over 60 something bill but all
[39:44.880 --> 39:51.560]  total it's 130 something bill with their tax-free foundation as the front by the
[39:51.560 --> 39:54.760]  way they get to keep all that money they just put their money and businesses
[39:54.760 --> 39:59.360]  into this eugenics foundation then they supposedly take the profits which is
[39:59.360 --> 40:05.960]  billions a year and use it for eugenics it's so sick yeah did you know if you're
[40:05.960 --> 40:12.640]  funding eugenics worldwide you don't have to pay taxes Ted Turner Bill Gates
[40:12.640 --> 40:18.040]  Warren Buffett Oprah Winfrey they all put their money in tax-free they're on
[40:18.040 --> 40:32.240]  the inside they're part of the winning team and I have seen it's on YouTube if
[40:32.240 --> 40:40.320]  it will dig it up I would imagine if you search Prime Minister Tony Blair admits
[40:40.320 --> 40:46.160]  rationed care or admits cancer patients have to wait I'll never forget four or
[40:46.160 --> 40:52.160]  five years ago I was just having a watching House of Commons and there was
[40:52.160 --> 40:57.720]  Tony Blair in a debate and they said this person above 60 waited more than 18
[40:57.720 --> 41:04.200]  months for brain surgery and died this cancer is over 90 plus percent operable
[41:04.200 --> 41:09.240]  and if it's done in the first six months but you refused and there's tens of
[41:09.240 --> 41:14.560]  thousands waiting because it's rationed by the bioethic boards the bioethic
[41:14.560 --> 41:18.160]  boards for who is allowed to get care what would the Prime Minister like to
[41:18.160 --> 41:23.040]  say to this the Prime Minister stands up to answer the question and he says it's
[41:23.040 --> 41:29.400]  quite true they're waiting I mean I have Tom Daschel's book where he said this is
[41:29.400 --> 41:40.040]  good this is admitted this is eugenics this is bioethicist the Wall Street
[41:40.040 --> 41:43.280]  Journal before it was owned by the eugenicist Robert Murdock who pushes the
[41:43.280 --> 41:49.440]  global carbon tax had written more than a 20 part series Wesley Smith this is
[41:49.440 --> 41:55.920]  name I'll get him back on before Rupert Murdock took it over I haven't seen
[41:55.920 --> 42:00.600]  any article since where he listed the names every article of the people and he
[42:00.600 --> 42:03.680]  would go and visit them and they would be chained down begging for food and
[42:03.680 --> 42:09.760]  water the Wendland case was a famous one he could even get up and roll a little
[42:09.760 --> 42:14.840]  bowling ball in his he did it for the news begging to be given water and food
[42:14.840 --> 42:20.520]  it didn't matter they still killed him because he didn't have any family and
[42:20.520 --> 42:25.040]  he had signed the forms let in the government be his caretaker and so the
[42:25.040 --> 42:29.240]  board of the hospital said you don't have a good life because you've had a
[42:29.240 --> 42:34.880]  stroke and are paralyzed over much of your body so you die see they're already
[42:34.880 --> 42:40.200]  murdering people all over the place and see they advertise it as oh it's your
[42:40.200 --> 42:44.560]  right if you want to commit suicide you can no no no no no so that's how they
[42:44.560 --> 42:49.640]  sell it this is people chained down begging for food and water and every
[42:49.640 --> 42:52.640]  time I have a guest on about this the nurses call and they go yes I sneak
[42:52.640 --> 42:55.600]  them food they're killing them right here in our hospital or right here in our
[42:55.600 --> 43:05.520]  hospice this is eugenics this is what it's really all about and so prison
[43:05.520 --> 43:11.280]  planet.com wrote a detailed article last week it had been out a few other
[43:11.280 --> 43:15.240]  websites in February but didn't get any traction you notice when prison planet
[43:15.240 --> 43:20.640]  put it out because of you are active listeners many of which have their own
[43:20.640 --> 43:25.360]  websites and news sites and other radio shows when we cover something everybody
[43:25.360 --> 43:29.400]  else picks it up that is what is so valuable about the show I'm not perfect
[43:29.400 --> 43:34.680]  I don't have all the answers I make mistakes I'm obnoxious sometimes but you
[43:34.680 --> 43:38.160]  know what we've got the big audience we've got the great listeners and we
[43:38.160 --> 43:42.360]  punch this out to the mainstream news and now it's been on Fox it's been on
[43:42.360 --> 43:49.800]  CNN it's been in the Associated Press it's been in world net daily it's now a
[43:49.800 --> 43:54.840]  big issue and people are reading the 1100 page book written by George W.
[43:54.840 --> 44:02.720]  Bush's science advisor not his chief advisor but one of his main advisors and
[44:02.720 --> 44:09.360]  written by the current he's the co-author with Anne Erlich and Paul
[44:09.360 --> 44:18.360]  Erlich John Holdren John P. Holdren said put stuff in the water to sterilize the
[44:18.360 --> 44:23.440]  population have CPS take everyone's children who have kids have a managed
[44:23.440 --> 44:28.200]  global dictatorship a planetary regime to carry it out what does Al Gore call
[44:28.200 --> 44:32.200]  for a global planetary regime global governance to carry out the new greenhouse
[44:32.200 --> 44:38.400]  gas rules the new tyranny anything that puts off carbon is evil plants humans
[44:38.400 --> 44:44.920]  animals otters whales kangaroos polar bears all put off carbon carbon is good
[44:44.920 --> 44:48.960]  as part of the life cycle it's the ultimate sick joke a global tyranny
[44:48.960 --> 44:54.880]  over what plants breathe and all other environmental degradation the genetic
[44:54.880 --> 45:03.520]  engineering the toxic waste dumping clear-cutting overfishing it's all go go
[45:03.520 --> 45:08.440]  go green light this is the sickest most cold-blooded joke and the eugenesis
[45:08.440 --> 45:13.880]  brag this has nothing to do with the earth they just sell you on deciding
[45:13.880 --> 45:17.720]  you're bad deciding you need to die and deciding to give up your property and
[45:17.720 --> 45:25.800]  your sovereignty and your reproductive control and so here are all these stacks
[45:25.800 --> 45:30.400]  of news Obama's science czar does not support coercive population control
[45:30.400 --> 45:36.000]  spokesman says so now he's putting out a press release the office of the
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.960]  president's science are John Holdren has responded to concerns that Holdren
[45:41.960 --> 45:48.280]  co-authored a book which allegedly contained allegedly contained as if the
[45:48.280 --> 45:55.120]  Catholic news agency calm couldn't link to the scans on prison planet calm I
[45:55.120 --> 46:09.200]  mean we scanned the book in we scanned the book in it's right there but oh
[46:09.200 --> 46:12.960]  they don't dare put a link you go to amazon.com they've got a large part of
[46:12.960 --> 46:19.360]  the book posted you can go to some of the scribe websites some of the I mean
[46:19.360 --> 46:24.440]  you you can find most of the book online piece here piece there I mean he
[46:24.440 --> 46:29.040]  admits he wrote it he did an Associated Press video interview they're gonna play
[46:29.040 --> 46:33.560]  later when we're live where it's the the main book behind him in a bookshelf it's
[46:33.560 --> 46:38.600]  an American flag and then a bookshelf and on a book and on a whole area of the
[46:38.600 --> 46:42.160]  bookshelf by itself on one shelf is the book
[46:42.160 --> 46:49.760]  eco science that he says is a policy textbook but their answer is oh it
[46:49.760 --> 46:56.720]  allegedly allegedly that's like saying Al Gore allegedly got up and called for
[46:56.720 --> 47:02.240]  global government last week there's only video him and living color saying it
[47:02.520 --> 47:06.880]  which allegedly contained comments supporting coercive population control
[47:06.880 --> 47:10.920]  measures a spokesman for the department said that Holdren disavowed such
[47:10.920 --> 47:16.840]  policies at his confirmation hearing really Obama just reinstated forced
[47:16.840 --> 47:21.160]  abortion and fantasized funding in China and Africa I mean he's on record and I
[47:21.160 --> 47:24.960]  know it's racist if you're against killing blacks but you know gets the
[47:24.960 --> 47:29.320]  liberal view is oh I love Obama he's helping him look oh he killing black
[47:29.320 --> 47:37.600]  babies it's so liberal Margaret Sanger called him subhuman weeds oh let's give
[47:37.600 --> 47:42.840]  her a liberal award oh see the real Nazis have got ponytails and walk around
[47:42.840 --> 47:48.600]  with limp rest and Birkenstocks going ah I mean when you watch Holdren talk it's
[47:48.600 --> 47:53.040]  the exact spirit they all have it's a real he's like kind of biting his teeth
[47:53.040 --> 47:57.640]  together while he talks just relishing how smart he is and relishing oh I've got
[47:57.640 --> 48:03.400]  the power oh drink your water take your shots I'm in control they're all about
[48:03.400 --> 48:07.320]  power raw power that they're hitting you with chemical and biological weapons in
[48:07.320 --> 48:10.360]  your water and there's nothing you're gonna do to stop it you're gonna watch
[48:10.360 --> 48:13.840]  baseball and football and that cool and go to the bar you're not gonna get
[48:13.840 --> 48:18.840]  involved he's got control he loves it they're running society it's so enjoyable
[48:18.840 --> 48:23.080]  to know you're gonna under mind control from the television and the culture and
[48:23.080 --> 48:27.480]  that you're under a literal mind control spell a trance that you can't wake up
[48:27.480 --> 48:32.960]  he's enjoying it oh he's gonna take his time with you
[48:35.320 --> 48:39.040]  Holdren is currently director of the White House Office of Science and
[48:39.040 --> 48:42.720]  Technology Policy assistant the president of science and technology co-chair
[48:42.720 --> 48:46.840]  of the president's council on advisors and science and technology he authored
[48:46.840 --> 48:52.080]  the 1000 page book Ecoscience with Paul and Anne Ehrlich the book includes
[48:52.080 --> 48:54.800]  several descriptions of possible population control measures including
[48:54.800 --> 49:00.360]  the addition of sterilists of the water supply to prevent human conception one
[49:00.360 --> 49:04.880]  section titled population law cited that radical groups zero population growth
[49:04.880 --> 49:09.040]  and said it has been well yeah Ehrlich's part of that it has been concluded that
[49:09.040 --> 49:13.440]  compulsory population control laws even including laws requiring compulsory
[49:13.440 --> 49:18.280]  abortion could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population
[49:18.280 --> 49:25.840]  crisis sufficiently serves to endanger the society we need to justify this
[49:25.840 --> 49:30.680]  compulsion by the way we found a couple other books and a bunch of PhD papers he
[49:30.680 --> 49:39.440]  wrote it's even worse go read limits to growth I mean go read it in fact I'm
[49:39.440 --> 49:42.880]  giving curtain MO Paul Watson others the assignment I know we've scanned it and
[49:42.880 --> 49:48.000]  posted it and but there's even more in the book I in fact I'm asking listeners
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.240]  to go into the book and read the whole thing and everybody we need scores of
[49:51.240 --> 49:55.480]  articles about it listeners write articles office quotes only facts we'll
[49:55.480 --> 50:00.080]  review them we'll post them writers and info wars.com articles and info wars.com
[50:00.080 --> 50:04.800]  send them to us all of us as a group can expose him ferret out as other white
[50:04.800 --> 50:09.320]  papers as other books go look up dr. Eric Pionka and dr. Peter Singer and
[50:09.320 --> 50:12.880]  others look at their white papers look at their books look at their graduate
[50:12.880 --> 50:17.440]  students books and then do what I've done track some of their graduate students
[50:17.440 --> 50:22.560]  and I found some working in bio weapons production under bio shield you can find
[50:22.560 --> 50:27.400]  photos of them in white lab coats now smiling and then right next to that you
[50:27.400 --> 50:30.600]  can write an article showing their quotes about how they believe all humans
[50:30.600 --> 50:37.040]  could be killed I demanded the FBI visit Pionka two years ago and they did you
[50:37.040 --> 50:42.120]  went on the air with that hippie voice and went look man I got a family man
[50:42.120 --> 50:49.720]  well it's a Maui Maui sounds just like Chong his Labrador man and I read one

[54:42.480 --> 54:49.400]  the next I'm gonna run through some evidence of extermination of eugenics
[54:49.400 --> 54:55.760]  of their programming as they prepare the public to accept their own
[54:55.760 --> 55:00.040]  sterilization their own control their own imprisonment under a neo serfdom
[55:00.040 --> 55:08.960]  carbon footprint plantation that's what it is neo feudal state the globalist
[55:08.960 --> 55:11.960]  brag that's what they're doing and they're the great great great great
[55:11.960 --> 55:17.360]  grandchildren of neo feudal lords why wouldn't they they know what works they
[55:17.360 --> 55:21.840]  don't just domesticate pigs and cows and sheep they domesticate us that's what
[55:21.840 --> 55:28.760]  governments about new world orders about all of it you know what my real
[55:28.760 --> 55:33.480]  task is it's reaching out to the enforcers the police the military and
[55:33.480 --> 55:37.360]  saying look I'm telling the truth about Holdren I'm telling the truth about
[55:37.360 --> 55:43.800]  Ehrlichman Ehrlich I'm telling the truth about Pianca and Singer and you
[55:43.800 --> 55:49.400]  randomly go out and find the head of any psychology department you randomly go
[55:49.400 --> 55:57.840]  out and find the head of any major university psychology department
[55:57.840 --> 56:03.640]  sociology department anthropology department biology department especially
[56:03.640 --> 56:07.840]  and nine times out of ten you go have lunch with them and they'll say yeah I
[56:07.840 --> 56:11.040]  believe we should kill at least 80% of the public and I want a world government
[56:11.040 --> 56:15.120]  now how did that happen they recruit their own people into the positions and
[56:15.120 --> 56:18.680]  the big banks and governments that are controlled by the big bank families
[56:18.680 --> 56:23.840]  they're financing their people they're financing their research they've got
[56:23.840 --> 56:30.160]  control of the whole show now my job is getting you out there to realize you're
[56:30.160 --> 56:35.160]  under attack even though you serve this system even though you rationalize and
[56:35.160 --> 56:41.080]  make jokes about it this isn't a joke you know my word of honor it's worse
[56:41.080 --> 56:45.360]  than I'm even saying I can't describe to you how serious this is how real this
[56:45.360 --> 56:49.240]  is but at the bottom of the next hour I'm gonna break down some of the news and
[56:49.240 --> 56:54.160]  the facets and all the ways it ties together
[56:55.960 --> 57:01.600]  but the big message here is that it's up to you the listeners the eugenics is
[57:01.600 --> 57:06.080]  all around us our entire society is engineered to carry out eugenics it is
[57:06.080 --> 57:11.200]  a fact it is their own textbooks their own policy reports their own master
[57:11.200 --> 57:15.400]  plans their own blueprints eco science is a major blueprint we've discovered
[57:15.400 --> 57:19.480]  everything in it was already public but this is how they want to implement it
[57:19.480 --> 57:30.520]  how they want to do it this is a Rosetta stone a master key and you have to
[57:30.520 --> 57:34.120]  ferret out other professors other people pushing this and you have to create
[57:34.120 --> 57:37.920]  blogs and websites you can't count on me folks I could be killed or set up or
[57:37.920 --> 57:42.680]  anything I could die in a car wreck I can be struck by a bolt of lightning we've
[57:42.680 --> 57:48.520]  got to make this the main issue if our progeny have any future if we have any
[57:48.520 --> 57:53.120]  future because they're now moving into a hot phase of their silent weapons for

[1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:19.560]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:32.080]  Alex Jones the ultimate power trip is to carry out eugenics the ultimate power
[1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:36.120]  trip by mill gates is always smiling is controlling other people's destinies and
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:40.000]  lives for those out there that have honor and are decent and good it's
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:45.120]  embarrassing to wield an exercise power unless you absolutely have to do it for
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:49.440]  the species survival but these people revel in it and like moths to a flame
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:54.080]  they are guided to the most extreme forms of power I'm gonna get Wayne
[1:00:54.080 --> 1:01:01.160]  Madsen's take on Obama's climate czar and multiple textbooks he published
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:05.680]  calling for forced sterilization poisons in the water and food he's in with us
[1:01:05.680 --> 1:01:09.640]  for 30 minutes but the main reason I have him on is he continues to really get
[1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:16.480]  a lot of inside info on assassination squads now remember a few months ago he
[1:01:16.480 --> 1:01:22.520]  added with some inside intel from DC a lot to the picture of dealing with
[1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:26.920]  Cheney and his hit squads and this assassination group of course Cy Hirsch
[1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:33.840]  reportedly broke all of this four years ago and now it is coming out that it was
[1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:39.120]  Budo that one of the hit teams killed that was clear that Madsen said that
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:43.720]  months ago that's now mainstream news so I wanted to kind of get him on and
[1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:49.040]  squeezing for more info on this subject now one of my films and many of the
[1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:51.920]  articles we've written years ago covered how Delta Force has been used even
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:59.320]  before Bush as a hit team it's just they've expanded what the special combat
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:07.280]  applications a group out of Georgia out of Fort Bragg has been doing and what
[1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:12.160]  they've been up to and then I remember UPI and Reuters articles from 2002 when
[1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:15.640]  the Israelis bragged they had hit teams operating in friendly countries
[1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:20.400]  including the US killing US citizens so imagine how big the scandal is going to
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:24.520]  get when two and two has put together that it's also foreign assets going
[1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:29.240]  around killing people even inside the US so Wayne Madsen good to have you on
[1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:35.720]  with us yeah give us the latest on what's really happening with these hit
[1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:40.600]  teams and where the scandal is going of illegal murder well it may have this
[1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:47.040]  Cheney team of course I had a very good source that contacted me that told me
[1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:55.280]  basically that this Cheney squad which is now thought to really be centered
[1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:59.600]  around this joint official operations command apparently the CIA was involved
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:04.800]  from the very beginning after 9-11 with something called the worldwide attack
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:09.960]  matrix that was developed by the CIA director George Tenet and that's what
[1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:15.840]  they're owning up to targeting al-Qaeda leaders in various countries but it
[1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:20.640]  expanded after that the CIA said this is outrageous we don't want any part of
[1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:26.040]  this this harkens back to the the charges made against the agency in the
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:30.560]  70s with the church Frank church committee hearing and the and the other
[1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:36.240]  oversight committee that's why it's a planetary planetary death squads that
[1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:41.800]  can be delivered in 12 hours right and and and now apparently that's a jay sock
[1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:46.680]  joint special operations command team was working very closely with the
[1:03:46.680 --> 1:03:53.720]  Israel most odd specifically the Qadhaun unit Qadhaun is the Hebrew word for
[1:03:53.720 --> 1:04:00.360]  bayonet that that unit specializes in assassinations and kidnapping and
[1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:04.560]  something else that may have entered into this and the reason why Cheney
[1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:08.760]  wants this to go away real fast the story is they may have this group may have
[1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:14.760]  been involved in sabotage including the sabotage of Iranian military and
[1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:20.000]  civilian airliners and as of today we know that there was a Caspian Airlines
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:26.080]  plane flying from Tehran to the capital of Armenia that crashed and killed some
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:34.240]  168 people so this is huge because because the White House separately admits
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:38.240]  that they've been hiring destabilization teams inside Iran including bombing
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:42.000]  mosque and things Wayne Madsen stay right there this is such important
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:45.600]  information we're gonna go through this in detail with breaking information from
[1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:50.760]  Wayne Madsen Wayne Madsen report dot com by the way we've linked his stories up

[1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:09.360]  today ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:16.200]  all right I want everybody to listen to us very very carefully because the
[1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:22.120]  information you're about here is a vitally important window into the
[1:08:22.120 --> 1:08:32.240]  mindset of the global elite running our society today now in 1979 Jimmy Carter
[1:08:32.240 --> 1:08:37.680]  set up a Delta Force was officially set up in early 1980 they've been used for
[1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:43.000]  high-profile hostage rescues assassinations of leaders terrorist
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:49.040]  groups and others and it's a group above the military that operates under the
[1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:53.160]  orders of the National Security Council and the president they have radically
[1:08:53.160 --> 1:09:02.200]  expanded the size of Delta Force Delta Force was used April 19th 1993 in Waco and
[1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:07.240]  the Delta Force documents were declassified they were in their pulling
[1:09:07.240 --> 1:09:14.480]  triggers they followed orders they went in with infantry maneuvers but bombs on
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:18.160]  top the church records vault area where the women and children were hiding and
[1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:22.080]  blew it to bits they were ordered to do it by the FBI and by the president and
[1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:27.680]  they did it it's on record they were there pulling triggers you can see the
[1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:31.320]  flare footage of them in infantry maneuvers coming out the backs of the
[1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:42.160]  APC's the Bradley's and firing and then going in and planting the bunker
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:46.800]  munition the shape charge that then killed the people inside we've had
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:50.360]  General Benton K. Parton on former head of force Air Force weapons development
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:56.240]  to cover that so understand Delta Force will kill you in order to do so they
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:10:01.640]  will kill children in order to do so and I'm not here even attacking our
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:06.200]  military folks and I'm not even saying all Delta Force squadrons are involved
[1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:11.840]  in this but it's a fact Delta Force was killing and pulling triggers in Waco
[1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:20.680]  that's just a fact so you got a problem have it with them now that said things
[1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:23.680]  have gotten a lot worse under Bush obviously and Delta Force would run
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:27.800]  around the world staging terror attacks this is not my opinion and Wayne
[1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:34.640]  Madsen's about to break inside info here one thing I wanted to mention is
[1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:41.120]  where of Delta Force personnel who are operating under contract to this joint
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:46.520]  special operations command that this was a unit that reported to Donald Rumsfeld
[1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:52.240]  and was working with this office of special plans this rival intelligence
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:58.000]  agency set up within the Pentagon under Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas fight I'm
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:04.640]  aware that Israeli military and most odd people would come into the Pentagon not
[1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:07.920]  even sign in according to the established procedures they didn't want a
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:11.920]  record of them ever being there where these plans were discussed so this was
[1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:18.360]  a joint J-Sock Mossad operation that reported directly to Dick Cheney it
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:24.000]  was under Dick Cheney's command outside outside any control of the CIA this is
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.800]  why I believe the CIA pulled out of the thing when they realized this foreign
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:34.120]  intelligence agent was involved in the CIA's history with Mossad is tortured to
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:40.080]  say the best about it I think George Tennant knows about this before this
[1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:46.760]  gets out of hand I would expect that Mr. Tennant may be be talking about this a
[1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:53.440]  lot a lot more because it was his agency that was the only one that stood
[1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:59.200]  between Cheney's book and and these targets now a number of targets were
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:05.320]  taken out and the CIA knows how this was violating all kinds of established
[1:12:05.320 --> 1:12:08.760]  procedures and how they could they would get in hot water that they kept it on
[1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:13.560]  the books to net it got rid of it but I think it's very interesting that
[1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:18.040]  President Obama recently extended the secret service protection for Mr.
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:21.960]  Cheney for another six months I think they're very very afraid that there's
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:27.040]  going to be one South for Cheney's arrest for homicide from a very various
[1:12:27.040 --> 1:12:31.320]  countries around the world possibly including Pakistan and so the secret
[1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:36.640]  service I believe as that protection is extended to protect Cheney and I have
[1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:40.600]  to wonder why why the Obama White House is even interested in protecting this
[1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:47.200]  guy since he is a since he made it may be responsible for several murders
[1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:51.560]  around the world including that of ex-prime minister buto one of the other
[1:12:51.560 --> 1:12:57.760]  things this group specialized in was poisoning people now there may be
[1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:04.360]  evidence that Yassir Arafat who was reported to died of a blood disorder
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:10.120]  may have also been poisoned by this group now Wayne Madsen you're dropping
[1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:15.360]  bombshell after bombshell and the problem is I know everything you're
[1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:19.480]  saying is true because almost everything you're talking about has already come
[1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:26.720]  out in the news here and there Israel in Reuters and an UPI bragged in 2002
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:31.120]  I'm going to pull the article that they had hit teams operating in friendly
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:36.000]  countries quote killing terrorist or terrorist suspects including the United
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:42.080]  States then Cy Hirsch what five years ago wrote big New Yorker magazine
[1:13:42.080 --> 1:13:46.680]  articles about US special forces on the ground staging terror attacks inside
[1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:52.600]  Iran then in 2007 has been reported widely this all on record the White
[1:13:52.600 --> 1:13:57.680]  House puts out a press release saying yes and I guess they had to do this to
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:01.280]  act like it was normal in kosher so other parts of the government would not
[1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:04.680]  launch investigations you know one way to cover up is just to come out in the
[1:14:04.680 --> 1:14:08.280]  open like it's you know like you're whistling in the wind as you walk out
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:12.120]  of somebody's front door with their jewelry and computers and and and and
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:16.360]  and family silver but to make a long story short the point I'm trying to get
[1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:20.880]  out here is they admit they're in Iran blowing up mosque bombing police
[1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:27.000]  stations bombing dams shooting people trying to destabilize their funding for
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:31.400]  terror groups three of them Wahhabi is out of Saudi Arabia run by the number
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:36.520]  three in al-Qaeda the White House openly running al-Qaeda attacks Sunni
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:42.280]  against Shiite based Iran and then Obama has the nerve to deny the US is
[1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:46.640]  involved in Iran meanwhile we know this group is involved over there meanwhile
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:50.760]  we know they're running hit teams all over the world meanwhile we know they
[1:14:50.760 --> 1:14:55.600]  kill Benazir Budo she was shot on TV and then our news said she hit her head
[1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:59.360]  that's how dumb they think of the American people are when the whole world
[1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:03.960]  laughed at us so so I'm probably have to hold you past the half hour because I'm
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:08.160]  ranting here Wayne go through this slowly because you've got a lot of inside
[1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:12.560]  intel this story had already broken but you added a lot to it in the last few
[1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:16.920]  months at Wayne Madsen report dot com that that then months later comes out
[1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:22.440]  in the mainstream media to be true I mean if I was tenant I would be singing
[1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:27.200]  because he's you know this is the type of thing I've seen in the past when CIA
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:31.680]  directors die in canoe accidents or kayak accidents suddenly in their
[1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:37.280]  backyard or suddenly that they get a 24-hour brain tumor I mean this is
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:42.240]  explosive info and would this be the kind of team they would use on a Deborah
[1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:48.120]  Jean Palfrey supplying hookers for Cheney or would they just hire Mafia
[1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:54.200]  Hitman for that well on on on this group and I believe that the tenant is the
[1:15:54.200 --> 1:15:59.240]  most likely to come forward because out of all the people in this town he's the
[1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:02.440]  one who really doesn't have many friends here they're not going to touch
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:06.880]  general Hayden because he's you know he's a retired Air Force general was it
[1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:14.320]  a deputy director national intelligence CIA director as he may be guilty of
[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:17.440]  involvement in this but he's going to be he's not going to be touched another
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:21.200]  touch Porter Goss either because Porter Goss was a member of the House of
[1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:24.720]  Representatives and was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee those guys
[1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:28.840]  for whatever they did are not going to be touched the guy who they could go after
[1:16:28.840 --> 1:16:32.640]  though is the guy with very few friends in this town and that's George tenant
[1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:36.760]  the only tenant has is a presidential medal of freedom that was draped over
[1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:41.960]  his head by George Debbie Bush and that and about three dollars and forty five
[1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:47.040]  cents will get him a latte grande at Starbucks so kind of I think it's the
[1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:52.760]  likely person who will come forward whether he's he's called to testify
[1:16:52.760 --> 1:16:56.000]  before the House House Intelligence Committee another telling thing will
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:00.680]  be this House Intelligence Committee probe they're talking about and maybe
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:04.120]  one in the Senate as well the Senate Intelligence Committee will it be done
[1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:09.480]  in in camera in classified session or will be done in public if it's done
[1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:15.240]  behind closed doors without the public being in on on the hearings I think it's
[1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:20.160]  an indication that this program was much worse than what has been
[1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:25.480]  advertised I noticed Cheney sending his daughter Liz Cheney out to say oh well
[1:17:25.480 --> 1:17:30.320]  this was just targeting Al Qaeda members well if that's the case what's the big
[1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:34.080]  problem here it's obviously it's much more than that and they're trying to
[1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:37.920]  do the Cheney's are trying to do damage control here but here's something very
[1:17:37.920 --> 1:17:41.920]  interesting about how it was operated this group was operating out of the
[1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:47.160]  Pentagon I know for a fact that ex-Delta force contractors who were working
[1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:52.440]  for Jaystock were sent into Iran wait a minute wait a minute let me stop you
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:55.160]  don't mean to interrupt but that's important you're saying this is above
[1:17:55.160 --> 1:18:00.000]  Delta force that they're actually sheet dipping them out of Delta so these are
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:04.200]  men quote formally associated with special forces right and some of these
[1:18:04.200 --> 1:18:07.840]  guys actually went to work at the CIA and something called the special
[1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:11.560]  activities division everybody might remember Mike span the guy who was
[1:18:11.560 --> 1:18:16.280]  killed at Maverick Sharif when we first went into Afghanistan he's the guy who
[1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:23.400]  found Lynn John Walker lend amongst those prisoners he was killed but so
[1:18:23.400 --> 1:18:28.760]  FAD was involved in this from the beginning but then the CIA said hey
[1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:31.720]  wait a minute this is that this is something we don't want any part of
[1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:36.520]  the so it's above Delta you were saying they were in Iran go ahead and one
[1:18:36.520 --> 1:18:39.920]  case I know they were operating under journalists to cover they went in as
[1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:44.680]  as an as American journalist but they were there to identify soft targets for
[1:18:44.680 --> 1:18:50.520]  assassinations and sabotage this occurred in 2003 so this is a this was
[1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:57.360]  the this program was ongoing now we know that there were a number of airplane
[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:03.720]  crashes in Iran some took out top officers in the revolutionary guards the
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:10.080]  elite Iran military force there was civilian airliners targeted as well as
[1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:15.120]  a a Russian built plane that that went down carrying a number of Ukrainian and
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:21.720]  Russian engineers to the city of Isfahan now Isfahan was the center for Iran's
[1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:27.200]  uranium enrichment program we may have Cheney's fingerprints on a number of
[1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:35.680]  airplane crashes in Iran that were sabotage incredible info Wayne Madsen

[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:35.520]  believe me I wish it was that's how to face it all this is and none of it means
[1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:41.000]  anything the Wahhabis were created by British intelligence they work for the
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:45.680]  West they go in overthrow any Muslim nation or Middle Eastern nation the
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:53.520]  globalist don't control and Wayne Madsen stay with us in the next segment to
[1:24:53.520 --> 1:24:56.960]  talk about some other issues as well but I've noticed we've seen Newt
[1:24:56.960 --> 1:25:01.640]  Ginrich running around in the news saying we need to run black ops and
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:05.320]  sabotage inside Iran and we were talking during the break when you're
[1:25:05.320 --> 1:25:09.520]  saying that's him hiding in plain view because one of his chief aides has been
[1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:15.600]  involved in the special operation work for Douglas fight in the office of
[1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:22.640]  special plans and and Ludi was very much part of this the special unit that
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:28.200]  was operating basically under the orders of Dick Cheney I would also point out
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:35.120]  that Donald Rumsfeld military training even Gucci was in the chain of command
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:42.840]  for these JSOC ex-Delta Force guys who were probing salt targets in Iran
[1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:47.400]  Rumsfeld and Cheney are neighbors over in St. Michael's on Eastern Shore in
[1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:54.680]  Maryland they're very good friends that there's soul mates you know very core and
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:59.520]  I think the one name that has not come up with this is Rumsfeld Rumsfeld his
[1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:04.760]  personnel whether contractor or active duty special ops who were airing out
[1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:12.080]  these attacks in concert with these cannot cannot kid on people kid on is a
[1:26:12.080 --> 1:26:16.440]  Hebrew word for bayonet as I said specialized in assassinations and
[1:26:16.440 --> 1:26:23.600]  kidnappings and sabotage quite Iran's nuclear facility in Pakistani that of
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:28.960]  Pakistan as well they were active in Pakistan against the Pakistan nuclear
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:34.640]  program I would also point out that Eric over is it's very interesting when he
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:40.440]  says what he's considering a special prosecutor to look at torture I believe
[1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:46.160]  that's a diversion because as bad as torture is it comes nowhere to political
[1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:51.680]  assassinations torture victims of course may be scarred psychologically for life
[1:26:51.680 --> 1:26:58.040]  but people are expected to go on and well yes plus this shows the chain of
[1:26:58.040 --> 1:27:02.480]  command we didn't have you potted up at first give us the name again of the
[1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:08.200]  genrich minion and how he was involved well William Rudy worked under this
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:12.320]  office of special plans he worked for Douglas fight now there were Israeli
[1:27:12.320 --> 1:27:18.680]  most odd and IDF officers coming into the Pentagon during this time going to
[1:27:18.680 --> 1:27:23.600]  see fight than Rudy we're not signing in there was no record of them entering or
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:27.880]  leaving the Pentagon this was in complete violation of established Pentagon
[1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:32.840]  security procedures I know from talking to people work there they were shot the
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:38.560]  even even a long-time civil service secretaries were shot at the ease of
[1:27:38.560 --> 1:27:44.200]  access these Israelis had is a fight is a fight from Assad like the White House
[1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:50.440]  Chief of Staff well now I was bothered that my father was a long-time official
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:55.240]  the finest organization of America you know you could just say yeah well you
[1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:58.720]  know what are they obviously they're they're in Israeli front whether they're
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:02.800]  almost out front who knows but they're definitely part of this well my issue is
[1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:09.680]  love Israel love Israel or hate Israel Israeli spies shouldn't be above our
[1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:15.240]  own generals in this special office set up by bush and they're like gods who show
[1:28:15.240 --> 1:28:22.280]  up and go past all the security and then brag in the US news they've got hit
[1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:26.840]  teams here pulling triggers I mean this is ridiculous well that's right and I
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:35.640]  would also know that we were carried that this operation began after 9-11 but
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:40.400]  there's there's an indication that it may actually have been active prior to
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:44.560]  9-11 because there was there was an assassination carried out against the
[1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:49.240]  father of Iran's missiles a man named Ali Mahmoudi Maman who who was who was
[1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:56.560]  who was assassinated by an explosion at a laboratory at South of Tehran on get
[1:28:56.560 --> 1:29:06.240]  the date July 11 2001 two months prior to 9-11 so if that was this joint J
[1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:12.320]  stock most odd team in those days it may have included the CIA what were the
[1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:16.840]  back particular group play and what happened two months later well how are
[1:29:16.840 --> 1:29:21.000]  they operating in Iran I mean I mean they're doing this through through
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:25.240]  operatives they've got working for them right they have a number of spies
[1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:30.480]  agents even ethnic Persians were applying for for these individuals as well
[1:29:30.480 --> 1:29:35.160]  as the Mojahedini Calcutta terrorist group that was Richard Pearl's favorite
[1:29:35.160 --> 1:29:41.520]  organization the Prince of Darkness Richard Pearl unbelievable stay there

[1:32:25.040 --> 1:32:28.680]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:32.000]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:35.920]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar

[1:33:12.040 --> 1:33:19.840]  up at 1-800-259-9231 we got under Michael Kaufman a climatologist
[1:33:19.840 --> 1:33:28.120]  biologist expert in forest ecology is what one of his PhDs is in he'll be
[1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:32.440]  joining us talk about the global carbon tax the eugenicist in light of the new
[1:33:32.440 --> 1:33:38.080]  textbooks it's not textbook it's now multiple governmental level textbooks
[1:33:38.080 --> 1:33:46.840]  this is a post PhD level master planning and he's put out a statement about it
[1:33:46.840 --> 1:33:52.480]  saying it's a textbook well what's wrong with the textbook discussing how we
[1:33:52.480 --> 1:33:56.040]  need to poison you and sterilize you Wayne Madsen though finishing up I
[1:33:56.040 --> 1:34:00.600]  really appreciate you coming on with us other breaking news in and around this
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:06.440]  I mean I've really become to respect the amount of inside info and you know if
[1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:11.200]  you don't break a story you always then break huge new facets to it that no
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:15.840]  matter how wild it sounds always ties in later in his in his vindicated but so
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:18.680]  much of what you talked about about these special hit teams was really
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:22.600]  already hidden in plain view my question to you is and then anything else you've
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:27.600]  got to add is why is it now breaking why is it now coming out because a few
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:31.960]  people talked about how the CIA was caught lying as a CIA trying to cover
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:37.440]  it's it's a but what's going on here well I think I think we on Panetta when
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:43.760]  he after he arrived at the CIA was being briefed on some things and and probably
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:47.720]  asked a couple of questions about this particular program and and when he
[1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:54.000]  realized how explosive this is no pun intended could be he said well let's
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:35:01.760]  let's get out from under this well I'm going to cancel our residual involvement
[1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:06.720]  in this particular program before this thing because I think we know what the
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:12.360]  all with all the math here in Washington for a scandal it's summertime
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:17.000]  remember Watergate broke in the summertime the hearings were held in
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:20.760]  the summertime all those revelations they were on Contra broke in the
[1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:25.560]  summertime so we have a lot of revelations they were on contra broke in
[1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:29.680]  the summertime we have a history of that I think he knows as an experienced
[1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:36.280]  politician what could happen here and I think we're seeing control leaks now out
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:42.400]  of the CIA about this program we see Cheney battling back by trying to say
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:46.160]  oh it was only Al Qaeda was targeted well certainly one of the names that came
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:50.040]  up with the sudden death of the president of Turkmenistan he was a
[1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:55.400]  dictator but by the way Sapa Murat Niyazov also called Turkmenbashi that
[1:35:55.400 --> 1:36:01.360]  which means ahead of the Turkmen he decided not to allow his airspace or
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:05.560]  his territory to be used by the United States against Iraq or Afghanistan or
[1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:12.800]  any attack on Iran he died suddenly his country is rich in natural gas and oil
[1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:20.560]  well why this is seven-year-old news for us but every time the CIA or the FBI or
[1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:25.320]  Special Forces cornered bin Laden or real Al Qaeda they were ordered to stand down
[1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:30.040]  that's that's now mainstream news it's finally you know been all over TV and
[1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:34.760]  radio the last few months and every time we turn around they're working with the
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:39.840]  Taliban and Al Qaeda and we had the airlift of evil after the liberation of
[1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:44.400]  Kabul the Special Forces kernels even went to the newspapers it was in the
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:50.720]  San Francisco Chronicle as you know and said what's going on here we were ordered
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:54.560]  to take the Taliban give them a bunch of money and fly them out to Pakistan on C
[1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:59.240]  130's to and I said at the time to start the next destabilization of
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:03.480]  Pakistan I mean from your deep research and working with the NSA and working at
[1:37:03.480 --> 1:37:09.400]  Office of Naval Reconnaissance is is is Taliban Al Qaeda a wholly owned
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:17.280]  subsidiary of British Mossad and CIA or is it like a client just like any other
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:22.400]  mercenary group well I have a classified French intelligence document that states
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:28.840]  that bin Laden and his group were under the active operational control of CIA and
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:37.840]  am I up until 1995 now the reason Patrick Fitzgerald went after bin Laden for
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:42.720]  the 1993 World Trade Center bombing is because he knew that and and and to go
[1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:45.960]  after bin Laden would say well he's going after somebody who was under the
[1:37:45.960 --> 1:37:51.120]  operational control of US British intelligence at the time so Fitzgerald
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:56.380]  of course is a very goody prosecutor he's been he's been used in the past he
[1:37:56.380 --> 1:38:00.520]  let you know scooter Libby basically half by not getting him for what he really
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:05.840]  did and that was exposing Valerie Plain and her work actually monitoring how
[1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:10.120]  this nuclear proliferation some of which is Turkish and Israeli intelligence
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:14.560]  that said he made sure that she was as you know that was never brought those
[1:38:14.560 --> 1:38:17.880]  charges never brought against the Libby they got to the other stuff that well
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:22.240]  look at civil Edmunds look at what civil Edmunds heard she heard him a criminal
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:26.440]  group laundering money selling drugs involved in human trafficking above
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:31.360]  government commanding government forces running the terrorist and you were
[1:38:31.360 --> 1:38:35.000]  getting into who they were assassinating where you were talking about a
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:40.120]  dictator being killed when I interrupted with just the fact that that for
[1:38:40.120 --> 1:38:44.680]  change to claim that the hit teams are killing Al Qaeda is ridiculous because
[1:38:44.680 --> 1:38:49.160]  Al Qaeda is clearly a tool they're using and protecting and kind of moving
[1:38:49.160 --> 1:38:53.120]  around the chessboard to destabilize areas or they move them into an area for
[1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:57.840]  a pretext for Western military force to be brought to bear where do you see all
[1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:02.000]  this going I mean is Cheney gonna get in trouble is Libby gonna get in trouble
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.800]  is Rumssell gonna get in trouble or is Obama gonna continue this I have to say
[1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:11.560]  it is a positive sign that Panetta is doing this or is Panetta just doing
[1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:15.960]  this because he knows it's so criminal he wants to protect his own butt
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:20.240]  well I think that I not only want to protect himself but he hasn't been
[1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:24.320]  theater he wants to protect the agency which he is right now there's a there's
[1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:28.760]  all kinds of new players we got Admiral Blair over the director of national
[1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:33.480]  intelligence now he wants now the power to appoint the you know station sheets
[1:39:33.480 --> 1:39:39.040]  that work for him not for Panetta there's a big problem there the US
[1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:44.080]  intelligence is state of turmoil right now this is not helping matters but
[1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:49.800]  very much it and obviously Panetta is trying to protect the CIA at Langley
[1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:56.040]  and and that's why he's you know saying look we got out from underneath this
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:40:00.480]  thing we should also remember that Iran's government tried to turn over to us
[1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:05.440]  one of Bin Laden's lieutenants and the son and the son of a son of Bin Laden and
[1:40:05.440 --> 1:40:09.880]  of course how did how did the neocons running the Pentagon respond to that we
[1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:14.240]  were coming at airplanes and killing Iranian scientists that's how they
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:19.080]  responded to that offer so you have to wonder if what was the purpose of this
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:23.360]  thing and why and why isn't the Cheney is putting it out through his daughter
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:29.280]  that are we really targeting al-Qaeda I've written that there were leaders of
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:34.000]  guerrilla movements in Indonesia look like they were targeted but these are
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:39.480]  this operation politicians and Nigerians that these were not a kind of member by
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:44.880]  any stretch but these were targets of opportunity that would a Cheney line is
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:49.720]  our own pockets and those of his oil friends and I think we're seeing much
[1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:54.840]  more of that starting to come out and also that you know jenna problems for
[1:40:54.840 --> 1:41:01.000]  Iran this that this whole thing looks like it it had every intention of
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:05.520]  killing people who were not in al-Qaeda not members of al-Qaeda sure Wayne
[1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:09.520]  madson we al-Qaeda is a tool used to kill the constitution kill the bill of
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:13.080]  rights and let the military industrial complex take over the whole world in
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:18.080]  closing any other intel on other big breaking stories that we should watch
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:23.520]  the horizon for and but but but one more question along this line before you
[1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:35.160]  answer that one is Israel planning our Israel planning to attack Iran is the
[1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:38.800]  United States planning to back them up what are what are these statements by
[1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:43.440]  Biden mean about he that Israel has a right by itself to attack and the US
[1:41:43.440 --> 1:41:49.240]  will support that is is is Israel in a ramping up mode for all of this
[1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:55.640]  aggression or are they or are they becoming discredited in any way or do
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:41:59.400]  they just not care and it's damn the maneuvers go straight at us I mean is
[1:41:59.400 --> 1:42:03.680]  this just where do you see things going well who is really naval vessels just
[1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:08.720]  trip to a canal with the permission of Egypt I might add and it said that
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:13.760]  was a message a warning message to Iran we know that the Netanyahu Lieberman
[1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:17.240]  government over there has every intention of launching an attack against
[1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:23.120]  Iran especially since Ahmadinejad is the that was reelected as president
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:31.120]  this is a government that is extremely right way extremely pro-war so I don't
[1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:35.480]  think we can rule anything I believe that this is really government under
[1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:41.120]  Netanyahu and Lieberman as much warlike than any other any of them
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:45.800]  missives we're hearing out of Tehran they're in a basically a defensive mode
[1:42:45.800 --> 1:42:51.040]  over there right now and they had all this the turmoil on the streets and I've
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:56.680]  reported that you know Soros and his gang were basically manipulating a lot of
[1:42:56.680 --> 1:43:04.520]  that on both sides I would add as his want his want to do but I believe now
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:11.400]  this plane crash today in Iran it killed a number of Iranians of Armenian
[1:43:11.400 --> 1:43:14.760]  descent they run as the plane was on its way to Armenia Armenian Iran have very
[1:43:14.760 --> 1:43:18.680]  good close relations but that I believe that could be a warning message that
[1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:24.280]  plane was seen the tail section was on fire before it crashed it could be
[1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:29.640]  another case of sabotage but why do it that could be a warning by this secret
[1:43:29.640 --> 1:43:34.040]  group don't probe too far because we're still active we pulled this one off and
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:40.520]  you know the next the next plane to be one here in the United States care about
[1:43:40.520 --> 1:43:45.400]  air France and that other one that crashed in the ocean I mean planes keep
[1:43:45.400 --> 1:43:51.600]  blowing up and falling into the ocean after strange terror alerts well the
[1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:55.360]  air France plane had two passengers on board who were flying to Geneva for the
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:44:00.280]  annual a small arms survey where they come out and then talk you know they
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:04.760]  talked about weapons proliferators small arms proliferators that's a multi
[1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:09.520]  billion dollar business so it's quite clear that these people these visuals
[1:44:09.520 --> 1:44:15.040]  were threats to that industry one of the big kingpins in that industry is in
[1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:20.000]  Brazil there was another threat against another air France plane from Buenos
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:27.080]  Aires flying to Paris just before that crash we may have on our hands here a
[1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:33.600]  aviation terrorism group operating under government cover and that I think
[1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:39.000]  should work everybody well it's perfect I mean the globalist the the Interpol
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:43.120]  international system runs airport security and it's it's always been
[1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:46.680]  their favorite way to kill people blowing them up in aircraft and Israeli
[1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:51.560]  security companies that are mostly ex most odd individuals that have contracts
[1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:54.720]  to provide a lot of security at airports including many here in the United
[1:44:54.720 --> 1:45:01.520]  States and for for many international airlines include the US airline oh it
[1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:06.040]  just gets worse and worse and any word on when they're planning to go ahead and
[1:45:06.040 --> 1:45:10.680]  attack Iran and how well you know we've seen so many
[1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:15.720]  so much chatter what they call indications and warning in the past the
[1:45:15.720 --> 1:45:19.560]  Israelis will never show their hands so these you know sending the ships to the
[1:45:19.560 --> 1:45:24.320]  Suez Canal you can never pinpoint any type of attack but what state that they
[1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:28.320]  could Israel cannot attack Iran without the military support of the United
[1:45:28.320 --> 1:45:33.800]  States we control the airspace between Israel and Iran so anything they would
[1:45:33.800 --> 1:45:39.000]  do would have to have our cooperation was the revolution trying to get the
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:42.840]  United States behind the attack to demonize the Iranians well I think so
[1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:48.160]  and it's also you know try to try to soften up Iran by creating a domestic
[1:45:48.160 --> 1:45:53.720]  problem in that country to create maybe a rift within the Iranian military with
[1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:58.240]  an Iranian intelligence and security whether that has happened or not I
[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:01.720]  think it's anyone's guess obviously I agree with you I think it was a smoke
[1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:06.560]  screen cover to insert more operatives and they're in the fog of war and
[1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:11.600]  hysteria to set up some other programs are going to be launching very soon well
[1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:17.360]  that's right and but that but I think the Obama's got a real
[1:46:17.360 --> 1:46:21.080]  problem he's trying to do this outreach to Iran and with more revelations
[1:46:21.080 --> 1:46:27.240]  coming out about this JSOC most thought operation targeting Iranian
[1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:31.840]  military commanders and Iranian scientists that could really derail
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:38.120]  anything the administration has in mind oh this is like mayor pigs trying to
[1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:44.400]  sabotage Kennedy well it really well could be absolute all right Wayne
[1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:48.960]  Madsen we really appreciate you coming on the broadcast with us today and it
[1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:52.000]  will talk to you again next week Wayne Madsen report.com appreciate all the
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:57.880]  info his phone was bad today because we last minute got him on from the road
[1:46:57.880 --> 1:47:03.320]  but next week we'll get him on via a landline there was Wayne Madsen okay
[1:47:03.320 --> 1:47:09.200]  they're socializing healthcare right now socializing Madison socializing
[1:47:09.200 --> 1:47:14.480]  opening up the borders the globalists are making their move on every front all
[1:47:14.480 --> 1:47:18.560]  these world leaders are calling to dump the dollar and Geithner has said they
[1:47:18.560 --> 1:47:21.720]  want to do that but he said as part of an evolutionary process they want to do
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:26.120]  a little bit slower they want to phase it out I suggest people get into silver
[1:47:26.120 --> 1:47:29.520]  and gold so before we got a break I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson up
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:35.280]  he did an offer here a few days ago of gold that he bought at the price of 913
[1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:41.400]  gold is now above 940 and he is running out of the special coins he has at that
[1:47:41.400 --> 1:47:47.800]  price but he can still offer you gold in the market that he bought at the 913
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:51.880]  level you can buy it in fractions of an ounce or you can buy it as an ounce and
[1:47:51.880 --> 1:47:57.640]  Ted's got a lot of coins available at that 913 level with it now racing above
[1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:02.560]  940 so this is win-win-win this is like being able to buy a stock in the stock
[1:48:02.560 --> 1:48:08.520]  market when it's up at a much lower price just a very very safe bet in my
[1:48:08.520 --> 1:48:13.200]  book there's no perfect bet in finances and money today but gold and silver is
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:17.480]  outperforming everything else and this is a great deal and a great
[1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:21.840]  patriot who owns the Genesis Network and Midas Resources Ted's been buying
[1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:27.040]  selling and trading gold and silver for 30 years and had Midas now for 12 years
[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:33.400]  Ted how much longer can you hold this deal on gold and silver we haven't had a
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:36.760]  deal this good in three or four months that I know of yeah I can tell you right
[1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:41.200]  now it really is up to how many people decide to buy and how my stock is
[1:48:41.200 --> 1:48:44.920]  holding I mean yesterday I told you that we'd hold it till midnight I'm gonna
[1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:48.760]  hold it again still tell midnight I don't know how I can make this easier for
[1:48:48.760 --> 1:48:54.040]  people to buy gold and silver I mean we still have those Lakota's at $18.17
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:49:00.600]  cents when when silver was close to $14 there 21 right now I also have the
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:05.280]  British sovereign currently at 266 relatively speaking that should be
[1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:14.040]  closer to the 276 279 the French Frank right now 216 again a coin that
[1:49:14.040 --> 1:49:18.040]  should be sitting somewhere around 221 and that's because gold and silver has
[1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:21.680]  gone up like it has and I did lock into this stuff last week when the prices
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:25.200]  were lower I mean I don't know how I can make this easier for people to buy it I
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:29.840]  mean if you take a look the Treasury right now Alex has let's say US Treasury
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:35.480]  I just did some math on it they have 286.9 million ounces of gold if we went
[1:49:35.480 --> 1:49:39.880]  back to the gold standard in order to adjust it based upon the amount of gold
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:44.600]  they have in the 1.569 trillion dollars worth of paper that they've created
[1:49:44.600 --> 1:49:48.560]  including this bailout stuff that we've done we'd have five thousand four hundred
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:53.280]  sixty eight dollars and eighty cents for the spot price of gold to back the US
[1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:57.640]  dollar today just do the math the value of the dollars going through the toilet
[1:49:57.640 --> 1:50:03.920]  it's lost 30% just since 2001 against foreign currencies and I just don't
[1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:08.920]  think that that trend is going to change well people need to stop procrastinating
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:14.400]  I wish that I would have gotten into more gold and silver back five six years ago
[1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:19.040]  it was 300 you know dollars an ounce now ladies and gentlemen it's pushing up at
[1:50:19.040 --> 1:50:22.960]  a thousand again but Ted's got it at 913 in fact gold was still going up last
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:27.800]  time I checked where is it right now Ted well the highest price today was 942
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:32.360]  gold right now it's sitting at 940 and it honestly I always just it's a
[1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:36.440]  reflection of what's going on in that market you the United States dollars
[1:50:36.440 --> 1:50:41.040]  getting getting you know it's getting destroyed by the policies of our
[1:50:41.040 --> 1:50:45.840]  government well regardless people need to move into golden silver today and I
[1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:48.680]  don't know where they're gonna find a better deal on silver and gold will tell
[1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:52.480]  people about a few of those coins and the offer and the phone number when we
[1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:55.600]  get back then take some of your phone calls and get Dr. Michael Coffman on

[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:49.680]  folks that want to take advantage of gold at the 913 level at silver at a
[1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:54.000]  lower level than it is now that you bought and instead of doing what all the
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:57.320]  other gold and silver brokers do they jack prices up and that's okay to do
[1:54:57.320 --> 1:55:01.120]  it's a free market you got to pay bills I got to keep the lights on but Ted
[1:55:01.120 --> 1:55:05.440]  really has has started really growing in the market becoming a very well known
[1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:11.520]  name over the last decade plus because he likes to buy it when it goes down a
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:16.240]  bit and then sell it when it's high at the same low price and the problem is
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:19.240]  it hardly ever goes down anymore for him to do that but here's one of those
[1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:23.080]  times you can take advantage of this so Ted tell folks about the coins silver and
[1:55:23.080 --> 1:55:27.600]  gold you've got from the lower price yeah the silver coin that I referred to
[1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:31.360]  earlier was the Lakota coin which is the coin that sort of flies in the face of
[1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:36.320]  the Fed if you look it up Lakota Bank you'll see that that coin is is being
[1:55:36.320 --> 1:55:42.600]  used as currency in places it trades right now at $18 and 17 cents and I
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:46.280]  have to say it's probably one of the most beautiful coins in silver you'll
[1:55:46.280 --> 1:55:50.680]  ever buy the other thing is the Franks and the British sovereigns currently
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:55.040]  right now 216 for a Frank I can't think of a better way to own a piece of gold
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:56:00.160]  in small fraction that you can use it in case of any kind of emergency I can put
[1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:04.400]  you anywhere in the world and that coin is money recognized not just here in the
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:09.040]  United States and South America even trying to phase out cash people keep
[1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:12.560]  asking what the global currency is they're gonna bankrupt all the currencies
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:15.760]  of the world they stated it by the time they're done we're gonna have world
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:20.280]  biometric thumbprint face scan that's gonna be your money that's what we've
[1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:24.400]  got to try to keep cash and gold and silver alive more importantly gold and
[1:56:24.400 --> 1:56:27.880]  silver what else do you have Ted well then we also have the British sovereign I
[1:56:27.880 --> 1:56:31.960]  do have a list of other coins I mean with the Eagles we have even a few
[1:56:31.960 --> 1:56:36.600]  buffalo coins if you're interested you ask bottom but that's factored in at the
[1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:40.720]  lower price from the lower market yep that's exactly right and you know I have
[1:56:40.720 --> 1:56:46.120]  to say this Alex when gold became legal here in the United States in 1974 when
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:50.600]  Richard Nixon made it legal it was $35 an ounce before that inflationary boom
[1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:56.720]  that end run and happen gold went up 24 times to 800 and it was $850 dollars
[1:56:56.720 --> 1:57:03.760]  an ounce were peaked just the same 24 time increase from 255 gold is gonna
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:09.400]  put us in over $6,000 an ounce just if we had what happened in the 1970s and I
[1:57:09.400 --> 1:57:13.960]  think everybody can agree that we're having a much greater meltdown in in
[1:57:13.960 --> 1:57:19.320]  our economic system than the 70s is ever pretended let's explain that gold went
[1:57:19.320 --> 1:57:24.000]  from 30 something bucks an ounce to 800 and something an ounce last time
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:28.320]  something like this happened this time it said 900 to something what's gonna
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:34.320]  happen if it goes up so speculatively as a speculator and again this is risky if
[1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:38.560]  you buy this for speculation it could potentially explode stratosphericly but
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:43.400]  the reason I buy is for insurance is for peace of mind as a hedge against an
[1:57:43.400 --> 1:57:47.200]  imploding economy and inflation those are great deals Ted Anderson has give
[1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:51.040]  minus resources a call they'll be there till midnight central standard time

[2:01:04.920 --> 2:01:08.880]  happened since then and he's one of the main voices and main experts in my
[2:01:08.880 --> 2:01:13.520]  seminal film in-game blueprint for global enslavement and I've been talking
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:16.560]  more and more about in-game blueprint for global enslavement as of late because
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:20.600]  they've passed the total carbon tax takeover of all society is to be
[2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:24.800]  selectively enforced home inspectors federal zoning they say they can throw
[2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:28.280]  you out of your house no judge no jury total control it's meant to create a
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:33.320]  post-industrial world and Dr. Michael Kauffman in my film in-game and in the
[2:01:33.320 --> 2:01:38.560]  extra that's on prisonplanet.tv in-game 1.5 lays out their own documents where
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:42.560]  they want a planetary tyrannical government to carry out forced
[2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:46.800]  sterilization the end of the family children being raised in government
[2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:56.000]  hives now this was covered in detail really all in one place an 1100 page
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:02.960]  book titled eco science written by Obama's science are who lied before
[2:02:02.960 --> 2:02:06.080]  Congress because some of his anti-population stuff had come out and
[2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:09.440]  said no I don't believe the government has a role controlling population this
[2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:12.080]  is a guy who believes in a one-world government to carry this out
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:17.360]  Al Gore last week in England set on television he wants a world government
[2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:21.520]  to carry out this program and I have stacks of mainstream news I'm going to
[2:02:21.520 --> 2:02:26.640]  show some of it in this hour where they say in the US in Europe in Canada in
[2:02:26.640 --> 2:02:32.480]  in Australia babies are bad one child policy taxes on the carbon of humans
[2:02:32.480 --> 2:02:35.840]  they picked carbon because that's what humans exhale
[2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:39.600]  two and a half pounds a day now our guest Dr. Michael
[2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:43.200]  Coffin we're about to go to break but I want to bring him up
[2:02:43.200 --> 2:02:49.840]  is has a bachelor's in forestry and an ms in biology at Northern Arizona
[2:02:49.840 --> 2:02:55.840]  University and a phd in forest science at the University of Idaho
[2:02:55.840 --> 2:03:00.320]  and he is a ecologist who has involved in ecosystem research for over 20 years
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:04.400]  in both academia and industry and he's taught and worked across a wide
[2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:08.560]  spectrum including the US Forest Service in developing an ecological land
[2:03:08.560 --> 2:03:12.560]  classification system for each of the national forest in region nine being
[2:03:12.560 --> 2:03:16.160]  used today and he was instrumental in in in
[2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:20.480]  beating one of the big treaties in the 90s that would have given total control
[2:03:20.480 --> 2:03:24.560]  and these wilderness corridors shutting down human activity
[2:03:24.560 --> 2:03:27.840]  it's all about making us dependent shutting off resources
[2:03:27.840 --> 2:03:33.520]  in a neo-futile or neo-surf system so that we can't afford to even get married
[2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:36.560]  or have kids and this is all stated but it's stated
[2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:40.320]  in the United Nations biological diversity assessment 96
[2:03:40.320 --> 2:03:44.320]  and a part of it stated in the State Department random 200 and the CIA
[2:03:44.320 --> 2:03:47.520]  addendum to that by written by Kissinger and it's restated
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:51.520]  in environmental policy reports and club of Rome reports or in articles written
[2:03:51.520 --> 2:03:55.280]  by his royal highness the Duke of Edinburgh or in statements in funding
[2:03:55.280 --> 2:03:58.720]  by Bill Gates or Ted Turner or Warren Buffett and eugenics
[2:03:58.720 --> 2:04:05.280]  but this new report by Holdren it's all in one place
[2:04:05.280 --> 2:04:08.160]  and that's why this is so important so when we come back we're going to be
[2:04:08.160 --> 2:04:13.280]  talking to Dr. Michael Kaufman today about all the big developments with the
[2:04:13.280 --> 2:04:17.680]  greenhouse gas what it will do how we'll control our lives how the
[2:04:17.680 --> 2:04:20.720]  new bank of the world will regulate global carbon
[2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:24.960]  taxes and we will pay our money into this private group
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:29.200]  and their own statements their own statements
[2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:32.640]  dealing with how this will be a managed economy and how we will pay our taxes
[2:04:32.640 --> 2:04:36.720]  to the new bank of the world this is gone from Dr. Michael Kaufman and myself
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:42.000]  with the documents being called kooks a decade ago and Dr. Kaufman almost
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:45.360]  sheepishly saying i know this sounds kooky but here's the document
[2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:50.720]  to now hundreds of articles a week by the mainstream media admitting all this
[2:04:50.720 --> 2:04:54.640]  but saying it's a good thing and we should accept it so we're going to go
[2:04:54.640 --> 2:04:57.520]  through the mindset the philosophy of these people

[2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:17.920]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:25.200]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:08:25.200 --> 2:08:32.160]  he's got a new documentary out global warming emerging science
[2:08:32.160 --> 2:08:37.520]  and understanding he also has another film we carry global warming or global
[2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:40.720]  government you need to show these are your friends and family and neighbors
[2:08:40.720 --> 2:08:44.480]  first they get you all hyped up that humans are bad it's for the earth we're
[2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:48.400]  going to save it this is social workers bureaucracy
[2:08:48.400 --> 2:08:52.480]  feudalism serfdom they want to go to a post industrial system
[2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:56.960]  of total bondage and slavery under environmental crimes
[2:08:56.960 --> 2:09:00.320]  and it's not toxic waste dumping they're worried about our open-air planning
[2:09:00.320 --> 2:09:06.240]  of cross species genetic engineered organisms that could cause a problem
[2:09:06.240 --> 2:09:09.600]  it's not about real environmentalism or conservation it's about
[2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:14.160]  control and you can get his new documentary at infowars.com
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:17.600]  dr michael kaufman so much has happened since we had you on
[2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:22.320]  six months ago time just just flies they passed the total carbon tax takeover
[2:09:22.320 --> 2:09:25.040]  it was worse than we feared they kept the bill secret
[2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:29.440]  the latter it passed total federalization home inspections
[2:09:29.440 --> 2:09:32.720]  shutting down selectively whatever they want
[2:09:32.720 --> 2:09:37.680]  every federal agency and sub agencies with the power to levy carbon taxes
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:40.480]  arbitrarily it seems the new direction in
[2:09:40.480 --> 2:09:43.120]  government is just to give dictatorial power to the agency
[2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:46.800]  they've got gun bills introduced to let the attorney general ban any guns he
[2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:51.360]  wants it at his stroke of a pen if he just states it
[2:09:51.360 --> 2:09:54.720]  that allow him to put anybody on a no fly list or no gun by list
[2:09:54.720 --> 2:09:58.480]  no judge no jury no conviction it's the same thing with this global carbon
[2:09:58.480 --> 2:10:02.080]  system they just set up offshore authorities and then we're
[2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:06.160]  ruled by them dr kaufman
[2:10:06.160 --> 2:10:11.520]  absolutely because we have no way of of actually addressing somebody that's
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:14.880]  offshore that does not have any accountability to us whatsoever and
[2:10:14.880 --> 2:10:18.880]  that's why they're doing it because they want to basically control the u.s
[2:10:18.880 --> 2:10:22.320]  economy and remember we talked about this on your program before
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:25.440]  for every bit of carbon dioxide that's admitted
[2:10:25.440 --> 2:10:30.160]  it has a corresponding impact on our economy it's almost a one-to-one ratio
[2:10:30.160 --> 2:10:35.120]  so if we reduce our our carbon emissions by 20 percent
[2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:38.400]  we reduce our economy about by 20 percent
[2:10:38.400 --> 2:10:42.720]  it's a it's a terrible terrible thing they're trying to get renewable energy
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:46.480]  to take its place but spain has shown that for every green
[2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:49.520]  job created with renewable energy they lose two and a half
[2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:54.240]  jobs it cost hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in spain
[2:10:54.240 --> 2:10:57.680]  they have 18 unemployment they've been doing this for 10 years
[2:10:57.680 --> 2:11:01.920]  but see the government right there but see the government then directs
[2:11:01.920 --> 2:11:05.600]  the switch over in the economy and the profits only go to a select
[2:11:05.600 --> 2:11:10.240]  fuse vertically integrates but they know carbon's not bad dr kaufman
[2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:14.880]  they know it's what plants breathe then that's why they diabolically chose
[2:11:14.880 --> 2:11:19.520]  carbon to tax knowing it's a carbon cycle and we're carbon-based life forms
[2:11:19.520 --> 2:11:22.240]  absolutely in this new dvd that you mentioned
[2:11:22.240 --> 2:11:26.560]  global warming or emerging science has new footage in it from the old dvd
[2:11:26.560 --> 2:11:30.800]  that clearly i mean absolutely and positively shows that man cannot be
[2:11:30.800 --> 2:11:34.240]  causing global warming fact a new study was just released
[2:11:34.240 --> 2:11:37.920]  yesterday that basically says that all of the carbon
[2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:41.840]  dioxide in the last uh... you know six hundred thousand years couldn't be
[2:11:41.840 --> 2:11:45.680]  responsible for the warming in the cooling there is no correlation whatsoever
[2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:49.360]  it calls in this serious doubt this is peer reviewed in nature science
[2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:53.600]  peer reviewed science that shows that there is really highly questionable
[2:11:53.600 --> 2:11:57.760]  evidence now are strong evidence of questions now the man caused global
[2:11:57.760 --> 2:12:01.040]  warming theory based on carbon dioxide so
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:04.640]  everything is against these people yet you see in congressman
[2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:10.320]  major major push how they got it they introduced the bill on may 15th it was
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:15.600]  passed on june 26th over a thousand almost 1500 pages
[2:12:15.600 --> 2:12:20.960]  long nobody had a chance to read it it's the most expensive bill this this
[2:12:20.960 --> 2:12:25.440]  country's ever passed nobody ever read it it was rammed through congress
[2:12:25.440 --> 2:12:29.520]  and what it contains will blow your mind
[2:12:29.520 --> 2:12:32.640]  uh... it basically everything that you said in the introducing this whole
[2:12:32.640 --> 2:12:37.520]  subject uh... alex is true plus a lot i mean if you
[2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:42.240]  you're only touching the surface areas it will destroy this nation as we know
[2:12:42.240 --> 2:12:46.480]  it now there's absolutely no doubt of my mind that's exactly what the club
[2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:49.920]  home that's exactly what holdren called for lets
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:52.640]  we're we're gonna get back into the science and take some phone calls coming
[2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:53.440]  up but
[2:12:53.440 --> 2:12:58.960]  let's first get into academia i mean you have worked around these phony
[2:12:58.960 --> 2:13:02.400]  environmental issue been around them in my experience
[2:13:02.400 --> 2:13:07.040]  the majority the vast majority of them do believe in neo eugenics
[2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:11.440]  they do believe in sterilization they do believe in one child policies
[2:13:11.440 --> 2:13:15.200]  and now they're openly pushing it saying babies are bad they have a bad
[2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:19.040]  carbon footprint i'm gonna show some headlines people here in a moment
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:22.480]  and really these are just control freaks who want to manage
[2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:26.480]  collectivist economy and they're making their move right now
[2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:29.840]  and and and now we have the the president's technology advisors
[2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:34.160]  textbook eleven hundred pages saying forcibly drug the water
[2:13:34.160 --> 2:13:37.840]  have cps take all the children have a managed economy
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:41.600]  we wonder why the government seems so out of control and nuts they're not nuts
[2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:46.480]  they know what they're doing well they're not very absolutely insane there's no
[2:13:46.480 --> 2:13:49.920]  question about that but they are doing it deliberately yes there's no question
[2:13:49.920 --> 2:13:53.920]  about it for exactly the reasons you're discussing
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:58.560]  in fact i just i am literally astonished that anybody in their right mind would
[2:13:58.560 --> 2:14:02.320]  even consider doing what is being done right now because there is no
[2:14:02.320 --> 2:14:06.480]  justification for whatsoever other than the political justification
[2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:09.920]  of destroying us and rebuilding it in their image
[2:14:09.920 --> 2:14:13.440]  under their control that's all they're communist they're communist i mean they
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:17.920]  are scum i'm sorry i interrupted yes destroying us rebuilding
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:22.000]  us in their image it's really happening they're taking over health care
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:25.920]  industries they're seizing everything i mean they are going to destroy the
[2:14:25.920 --> 2:14:29.840]  economy and the only jobs you're going to get is from them on welfare or
[2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:34.960]  through a government contract doctor absolutely absolutely and the only way
[2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:39.600]  we can stop this is to just endate your congressman and senators depending on
[2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:44.480]  the word the bill is at the present time and tell them to vote no on health care
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:48.400]  vote no on cap and trade vote no on whatever it is a second stimulus
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:52.240]  package whatever it is and then back it up by saying i'm not going to vote for
[2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:55.200]  you if you vote yes for these things and then
[2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:58.960]  start writing letters to the editor with their name in it
[2:14:58.960 --> 2:15:02.000]  saying that they are trying to destroy this nation now you got to be
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:05.840]  diplomatic because otherwise the paper won't print it but
[2:15:05.840 --> 2:15:09.680]  but hell look at nafta look at gat they knew that was going to destroy us the
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:13.520]  un the imf world bank said they want to post industrial
[2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:17.600]  they've done everything they can to destroy us and now their solution
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:21.760]  to the crises they created is to throw a wet blanket
[2:15:21.760 --> 2:15:25.120]  over an economy that's almost already gone out
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:29.600]  absolutely i i totally agree they're just fast-tracking it through the
[2:15:29.600 --> 2:15:33.920]  to the destruction of this nation so that they can start rebuilding it and
[2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:37.520]  we know already they're talking about a single global currency you know i you
[2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:41.120]  and i've been talking about that for what five years now in their program
[2:15:41.120 --> 2:15:44.880]  and you have probably talked about it many more times than when i was on
[2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:48.320]  all these things that we used to talk about that we were kind of on the
[2:15:48.320 --> 2:15:52.320]  superficial fringe of of extremism back as you said at the beginning of the
[2:15:52.320 --> 2:15:55.840]  program five ten years ago uh... now it's in the daily
[2:15:55.840 --> 2:15:59.360]  newspapers and it's always written up in a very positive way of course
[2:15:59.360 --> 2:16:04.080]  but it's impossible to ignore and not see unless you were so
[2:16:04.080 --> 2:16:07.520]  brainwashed and that's what our public education system unfortunately is done
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:11.840]  to us is so brainwashed is that we look at this and think that's a
[2:16:11.840 --> 2:16:15.520]  fantastic idea and unfortunately almost half of the nation
[2:16:15.520 --> 2:16:18.800]  is in that category at least it certainly seems to be
[2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:21.920]  doctor i don't know if you've looked at this data but but i'm actually working
[2:16:21.920 --> 2:16:25.920]  on a new film right now on having a section on this but
[2:16:25.920 --> 2:16:30.320]  mainstream even ap studies where they test the major water supplies of the
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:34.560]  cities they're finding high levels of uh...
[2:16:34.560 --> 2:16:38.320]  female hormones that yet that that that that block pregnancy
[2:16:38.320 --> 2:16:41.760]  birth control they're finding high levels of uh...
[2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:46.080]  prozac type drugs and and they're noticing that it's
[2:16:46.080 --> 2:16:50.560]  uh... kind of a generic mass molecule it it's
[2:16:50.560 --> 2:16:54.960]  not even the type that that people are taking and they're finding even aquifers
[2:16:54.960 --> 2:16:59.520]  that are treated water where they take aquifer water and then treat it
[2:16:59.520 --> 2:17:03.280]  is having this added and and that they've done british studies as well
[2:17:03.280 --> 2:17:06.960]  clearly somebody's adding it i've been saying this for years
[2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:13.200]  and the scientists are saying this now and it's so strong at sterilizing fish
[2:17:13.200 --> 2:17:18.400]  whales amphibians you name it birds uh... or they're being unisex
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:24.480]  hemaphrodites so you study watersheds and and and forests and all of this
[2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:27.120]  but then we have all these government reports with the japanese government
[2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:32.720]  proposing it and obama's head of science proposing it
[2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:35.600]  i mean do you think there's evidence that they're already
[2:17:35.600 --> 2:17:39.600]  um testing this out and doing this in some areas you know you can't help but
[2:17:39.600 --> 2:17:42.720]  believe that they are at least on a on a selected
[2:17:42.720 --> 2:17:47.280]  basis if not more uniform across the country because what we're seeing here
[2:17:47.280 --> 2:17:51.600]  is if the eugenics issue even though i'm not an expert in eugenics
[2:17:51.600 --> 2:17:56.720]  that whole issue of population control trying to breed for the
[2:17:56.720 --> 2:17:59.840]  best uh... person and that type of thing
[2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:04.400]  is literally at the heart of what we're talking about and trying to create the
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:05.280]  new
[2:18:05.280 --> 2:18:08.800]  superperson and the emerging future and it's just
[2:18:08.800 --> 2:18:12.720]  it's taking you know much lower population the global biodiversity
[2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:15.360]  assessment that you mentioned at the beginning of the program calls
[2:18:15.360 --> 2:18:18.960]  for reducing the human population to the from the current six and a half
[2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:22.720]  billion down to about one maybe one and a half billion people
[2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:26.240]  so that we can live quote unquote sustainably
[2:18:26.240 --> 2:18:29.440]  and with nature and so forth this nature
[2:18:29.440 --> 2:18:33.120]  is god belief is underwriting this whole thing
[2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:36.480]  eugenics is underwriting the whole environmental movement
[2:18:36.480 --> 2:18:40.720]  all the rest you have to understand it is a major major religion is trying to
[2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:44.560]  gain control absolute control over your in my life
[2:18:44.560 --> 2:18:48.560]  well that's the thing that i
[2:18:48.560 --> 2:18:52.080]  come to this just coldly looking at the facts
[2:18:52.080 --> 2:18:55.680]  i don't have any preconceived notions but every time i run into these
[2:18:55.680 --> 2:18:59.440]  environmental leaders not their useful idiots on the ground who mean well
[2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:02.960]  when you always talk to them you find out they're into the occult
[2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:07.520]  i like dr peonka is on the ut website dressed up as a druid
[2:19:07.520 --> 2:19:10.800]  talking about lucifer when he's not talking about how he wants to kill 90
[2:19:10.800 --> 2:19:14.800]  percent of us and i know that sounds crazy we're not the ones that are crazy
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:18.080]  they're the ones but when you really study the u n that biological
[2:19:18.080 --> 2:19:21.760]  diversity assessment talks about bringing back wars and famine
[2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:26.160]  and human sacrifice you i mean that i mean you can't make this up
[2:19:26.160 --> 2:19:30.400]  and then you have the the state of memorandum 200 saying we'll use wars
[2:19:30.400 --> 2:19:34.240]  and pestilence and starvation to do it go ahead
[2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:38.640]  absolutely i mean there's this whole thing with these epidemics and all the
[2:19:38.640 --> 2:19:41.520]  rest uh you know some of these things are natural
[2:19:41.520 --> 2:19:46.320]  i mean they do happen but when you start seeing them on a regular basis
[2:19:46.320 --> 2:19:50.480]  intercoordinated with a lot of other things going on it's not a coincidence
[2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:54.240]  they're deliberately doing it for some unknown reason while we know what the
[2:19:54.240 --> 2:19:58.000]  reason is they want to gain control basically reduce the human
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:01.040]  population to control every single thing they do
[2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:04.640]  this is alex jones and i want to tell you about graph under safes dot com

[2:23:03.920 --> 2:23:07.040]  russia and china have now penetrated our power grid
[2:23:07.040 --> 2:23:11.120]  even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer
[2:23:11.120 --> 2:23:15.040]  to the limits of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for
[2:23:15.040 --> 2:23:18.320]  electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge
[2:23:18.320 --> 2:23:22.560]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting us all
[2:23:22.560 --> 2:23:27.040]  in the dark are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages or
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:30.880]  government created blackouts have you ever thought about taking steps to get
[2:23:30.880 --> 2:23:35.200]  off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power
[2:23:35.200 --> 2:23:39.120]  if so this will be the most important information you have ever heard
[2:23:39.120 --> 2:23:43.280]  solar powered generators are finally available they have no moving parts to
[2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:47.520]  wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever

[2:24:00.800 --> 2:24:19.600]  i'm gonna chase the sky forever
[2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:22.800]  ladies and gentlemen if you study history and other civilizations
[2:24:22.800 --> 2:24:27.680]  the elites just to exercise power would routinely say kill all the firstborn
[2:24:27.680 --> 2:24:32.240]  or they'd say go kill half the slaves gotta keep the slave numbers down gotta
[2:24:32.240 --> 2:24:35.280]  keep them dumbed down gotta keep them on the verge of starvation
[2:24:35.280 --> 2:24:38.880]  so they're so busy worrying about getting enough to eat they won't resist you
[2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:43.680]  this is how elites manage people back to the next segment you
[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:48.240]  queue up holdren with that ap clip of him talking about weather control
[2:24:48.240 --> 2:24:53.600]  that's another issue is in some of these eugenics reports they say they'll use
[2:24:53.600 --> 2:24:58.480]  wars famine and weather and then we have secretary of defense cohen
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:02.080]  at the time in 97 saying they'd use weather weapons for this
[2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:06.400]  i can show folks army dot mill that the text and then i've had
[2:25:06.400 --> 2:25:10.560]  but but now bill gates is in the news and the associated press
[2:25:10.560 --> 2:25:16.720]  today bill gates envisions fighting hurricanes by manipulating the sea
[2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:20.160]  well that's exactly what stanford research institute certified a long time
[2:25:20.160 --> 2:25:24.400]  ago my point is they're using the shadow government and all these high-tech
[2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:27.520]  systems i believe dr. kaufman that that they're
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:31.760]  going to create weather calamities uh as a pretext for
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:36.000]  creating the society of control because they've they've studied chicanery and
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:40.240]  scams of old and the old witch doctors six thousand years ago
[2:25:40.240 --> 2:25:43.840]  they would tell the tribe give me the best food give me the best hut
[2:25:43.840 --> 2:25:48.000]  or the snake god won't spit the sun out well he just knew when the eclipse was
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:51.280]  coming and he was manipulating them and that's all this is
[2:25:51.280 --> 2:25:55.840]  is con artist criminals uh who also like to be sadistic killers
[2:25:55.840 --> 2:25:59.360]  doing what every other elites done it's just a high-tech version
[2:25:59.360 --> 2:26:02.800]  that's right i totally agree with you there is no question that
[2:26:02.800 --> 2:26:08.000]  of climate modification and control is very much part of this agenda the
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:11.360]  the uh there's been major experiments done on that in alaska
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:14.560]  uh and we have seen some evidence of that
[2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:19.360]  you know it's hard to say for sure exactly how they do it and when they do it
[2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:24.000]  i'm not a physicist but i do know that the they actually interrupt the ionosphere
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:28.320]  in the ionosphere is where our weather is born so if they can control what
[2:26:28.320 --> 2:26:32.880]  happens there they basically control a climate to a greater or lesser degree
[2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:36.400]  it's just one of those things that all of these things i don't care if it's
[2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:40.240]  eugenics is climate control it's um legislation like
[2:26:40.240 --> 2:26:45.360]  cap and trade the the health care bill whatever it is is all coordinated to
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:49.200]  achieve a certain goal that you have been describing during this hour
[2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:55.600]  well every day uh no exaggeration i think today i printed off five or six or
[2:26:55.600 --> 2:26:58.880]  so mainstream articles with oh bill gates is going to save us
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:03.760]  from hurricanes he just got an idea of cloud seeding he invented it oh he's a
[2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:06.960]  genius no four years ago i had the father of
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:12.640]  weather weapons on the show who was doing this in uh korea
[2:27:12.640 --> 2:27:16.640]  in vietnam been livingston and it was declassified they were creating
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:19.760]  steering killing weakening whatever they wanted
[2:27:19.760 --> 2:27:25.600]  hurricanes certified by the u.s government in 67 and then now
[2:27:25.600 --> 2:27:30.400]  holdren comes out like he's some genius and says they've just invented this
[2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:33.600]  and that it's his idea so they all like it's like al gore saying he invented the
[2:27:33.600 --> 2:27:37.120]  internet yeah right i mean there's no into it and then
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:40.400]  all these newspapers and magazines i have
[2:27:40.400 --> 2:27:43.920]  say oh the global warming so bad they've got to save us
[2:27:43.920 --> 2:27:47.840]  and they're gonna now smoke screen their weather manipulation creating the
[2:27:47.840 --> 2:27:51.280]  crisis in the name of fixing it so while they're
[2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:55.680]  creating a crisis droughts hurricanes all this stuff
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:28:01.120]  floods they're gonna cover their own operation and that they're fixing it
[2:28:01.120 --> 2:28:03.840]  and exactly what we said they were doing with the chemtrails
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:08.400]  with the with the barium and aluminum dioxide now that's what they propose in
[2:28:08.400 --> 2:28:12.000]  the wall street journal and atlantic monthly and other publications
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.880]  and an ap that they're going to do to save us now
[2:28:14.880 --> 2:28:19.040]  how did we just imagine the chemtrails were barium salts and aluminum dioxide
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:22.560]  with all these climatologists we had on and then dr kaufman it ends up
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:26.240]  magically they go oh yeah we've been doing secret test programs
[2:28:26.240 --> 2:28:31.280]  all this giant global level terraforming was just a test
[2:28:31.280 --> 2:28:36.160]  isn't that amazing isn't that amazing you know i i talked about the
[2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:39.440]  wildlands project and what the convention on biological diversity was
[2:28:39.440 --> 2:28:43.840]  going to do for five years before it was finally introduced in the u.s senate
[2:28:43.840 --> 2:28:47.200]  nobody believed the word i said and here it is
[2:28:47.200 --> 2:28:51.120]  and now 10 years after the fact or 15 years after the fact now
[2:28:51.120 --> 2:28:54.720]  and it's full blown is doing everything that i said it was going to do back to
[2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:59.040]  the late 1980s uh you and i have both done this
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:03.360]  where we have predicted based on what we've seen the the papers and so forth
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:07.680]  of what is their planning behind the scenes that sooner or later within five
[2:29:07.680 --> 2:29:12.720]  to 12 to 15 years going to be mainstream and you can't get people to
[2:29:12.720 --> 2:29:16.960]  believe it because it wasn't published in the new york times
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:20.880]  amazing we had a long segment coming up and i want you to talk about
[2:29:20.880 --> 2:29:23.760]  the fact that we can't beat this and fight it because you've done that single
[2:29:23.760 --> 2:29:27.840]  handedly before you've been doing this for decades and you did warn about the
[2:29:27.840 --> 2:29:32.000]  wetlands now we have the water quality restoration
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:34.480]  act that federalizes basically the whole country
[2:29:34.480 --> 2:29:38.400]  they're really making their move but the good news is we're aware of it thanks

[2:32:03.040 --> 2:32:06.800]  you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer number one
[2:32:06.800 --> 2:32:10.080]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:32:10.080 --> 2:32:14.560]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[2:32:14.560 --> 2:32:17.920]  company allows you to have it's true total government control
[2:32:17.920 --> 2:32:21.040]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:32:21.040 --> 2:32:24.720]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:32:24.720 --> 2:32:27.600]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:32:27.600 --> 2:32:31.120]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[2:32:31.120 --> 2:32:34.160]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[2:32:34.160 --> 2:32:37.360]  outages number five a solar power generator provides
[2:32:37.360 --> 2:32:40.880]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[2:32:40.880 --> 2:32:44.240]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science a long time
[2:32:44.240 --> 2:32:46.960]  sponsor of ours you can get more information at
[2:32:46.960 --> 2:32:51.680]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[2:32:51.680 --> 2:32:56.000]  remember the government doesn't own the sun yet so go to mysolarbackup.com
[2:32:56.000 --> 2:33:11.920]  or call toll-free 877-327-0365
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:33.360]  i wish that i could fly into the sky so very high just like a dragonfly
[2:33:33.360 --> 2:33:38.400]  ladies and gentlemen you cannot accuse the establishment of not thinking big
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:42.080]  terraforming the planet controlling the weather and keeping us like ignorant
[2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:46.400]  savages that don't even know what the sun is
[2:33:46.400 --> 2:33:50.000]  and then holders talking about putting up satellites and blocking out the sun and
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:53.040]  all this craziness the point is they want to
[2:33:53.040 --> 2:33:55.920]  play god they want you to live in an engineered society
[2:33:55.920 --> 2:33:59.600]  there's an article out of a mainstream magazine in the 1940s
[2:33:59.600 --> 2:34:03.680]  we can control the weather and it describes exactly how they do it
[2:34:03.680 --> 2:34:09.840]  and there is a massive program of this going on this is 1944
[2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:15.920]  and just incredible absolutely incredible and it gets into cloud
[2:34:15.920 --> 2:34:23.200]  seeding i want to play the white house czar a
[2:34:23.200 --> 2:34:26.240]  clip from the associated press this is not
[2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:30.160]  alex jones saying this i want to play this
[2:34:30.160 --> 2:34:35.520]  clip of john p holdren the eugenicist and he is a eugenicist there's no
[2:34:35.520 --> 2:34:38.880]  doubting just like an in-game i accuse the head of the human
[2:34:38.880 --> 2:34:42.480]  genome project of being a eugenicist because i'd read his writings
[2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:46.400]  no one had ever publicly called him one and then a year after in game came out
[2:34:46.400 --> 2:34:51.760]  it came out that mr watson said blacks weren't human were basically subhuman
[2:34:51.760 --> 2:34:55.680]  and now it's come out they are taking your blood at birth for 36 years illegally
[2:34:55.680 --> 2:34:58.880]  for the human genome project that's a giant eugenics front
[2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:02.160]  sure they get some secondary science from it and i think it's fine but
[2:35:02.160 --> 2:35:05.600]  they're using it for race specific bio weapon development we're going to get
[2:35:05.600 --> 2:35:08.640]  dr michael coppins take on that and some of the things he's been fighting in
[2:35:08.640 --> 2:35:12.400]  this clean water restoration act that federalizes anything that has
[2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:16.240]  water above or below ground puddles of water
[2:35:16.240 --> 2:35:21.840]  and the rewilding act in these wilderness corridors on the rivers
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:26.560]  that's all coming up but here is holdren to the ap and notice on the video in
[2:35:26.560 --> 2:35:30.800]  the background by the american flag on the shelf is eco science
[2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:35.040]  the textbook he wrote for government a plan
[2:35:35.040 --> 2:35:39.600]  of a planetary tyranny to sterilize you here it is
[2:35:39.600 --> 2:35:43.680]  we have to look at it very carefully because we might get desperate enough
[2:35:43.680 --> 2:35:47.360]  to want to use it the danger of course with geo engineering
[2:35:47.360 --> 2:35:50.960]  is the one i was referring to a moment ago we don't understand the system well
[2:35:50.960 --> 2:35:54.080]  enough to predict its responses in detail
[2:35:54.080 --> 2:35:57.920]  and that means there's always a danger if you try to engineer the system on a
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:00.720]  large scale that you will do something that has side
[2:36:00.720 --> 2:36:04.000]  effects that are worse than the dimension of the
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:07.200]  problem you're trying to cure with the geo engineering in the first
[2:36:07.200 --> 2:36:10.800]  place there are a variety of schemes that have
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:15.360]  been discussed for geo engineering a classic example
[2:36:15.360 --> 2:36:19.840]  is injecting reflecting particles into earth orbit
[2:36:19.840 --> 2:36:23.680]  that would deflect some of the sunlight that would otherwise be warming the
[2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:26.400]  earth and in that way try to produce a cooling
[2:36:26.400 --> 2:36:29.760]  effect to offset the heating effect of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
[2:36:29.760 --> 2:36:33.680]  let's stop right there you can watch the rest of the clip up on info wars dot
[2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:38.880]  com and present planet dot com but understand for over a decade
[2:36:38.880 --> 2:36:42.160]  we found some government documents about high altitude spraying
[2:36:42.160 --> 2:36:46.880]  these aerosol campaigns people call them chemtrails we got called kooks
[2:36:46.880 --> 2:36:50.560]  and there are some kooks that pointed a regular ice trail and you know say it is
[2:36:50.560 --> 2:36:53.760]  a trail but it isn't but trails at 2 000 feet don't
[2:36:53.760 --> 2:36:57.680]  don't condensate and sit there and get bigger for five hours you know
[2:36:57.680 --> 2:37:02.000]  real ice trails real real con trails disappear in just a few minutes
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:04.880]  there's a massive program going on and they admit it
[2:37:04.880 --> 2:37:09.200]  now if you just google these terms all these universities department of energy
[2:37:09.200 --> 2:37:13.440]  nasa brags oh look the earth's 20 percent darker
[2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:17.360]  satellite photos of the whole country covered they really are
[2:37:17.360 --> 2:37:20.800]  revenge of the nerd scientists who happen to be eugenicist
[2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:25.200]  on wild power trips dr michael kaufman
[2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:29.200]  again there's no question of that there's it's just
[2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:32.240]  a phenomenal when you get back to the chemtrail issues i'm not an expert on
[2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:36.400]  chemtrails but what i do know is that they're high enough elevation
[2:37:36.400 --> 2:37:41.040]  that they actually form kind of a cirrus cloud formation now if you know the
[2:37:41.040 --> 2:37:45.120]  politics and the science of global warming my man caused global warming
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:48.960]  this is what they have predicted right from the very beginning is
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:52.320]  inherent in every single climate model that there is
[2:37:52.320 --> 2:37:57.280]  is that about six miles in elevation what you find is that more cirrus clouds
[2:37:57.280 --> 2:38:02.320]  are formed which trap the heat it's a positive feedback mechanism i might
[2:38:02.320 --> 2:38:04.720]  get more complicated than that or you won't understand it
[2:38:04.720 --> 2:38:08.640]  well the earth needs this as its shield explode go ahead and give people the
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:12.800]  science it basically says that with now first of
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:17.200]  all you have to understand the carbon dioxide itself cannot trap much more
[2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:20.800]  heat very very small percentage a couple percent that's about
[2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:25.840]  hit because it's the weight links the weight bands that it traps heat in
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:30.560]  are already saturated so it cannot do much more therefore the little bit it
[2:38:30.560 --> 2:38:33.200]  does do they claim are going to create more clouds
[2:38:33.200 --> 2:38:38.160]  more thunderstorms which when they decay they create more cirrus clouds
[2:38:38.160 --> 2:38:43.200]  cirrus clouds trap the heat low elevation rain clouds reflect the heat
[2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:46.640]  earth the sun just the opposite it's a negative feedback
[2:38:46.640 --> 2:38:51.280]  in a positive feedback in cirrus clouds the radiation emitted by the earth is
[2:38:51.280 --> 2:38:55.600]  trapped again and remitted down that means that the upper atmosphere heat
[2:38:55.600 --> 2:39:01.040]  faster than the earth's surface and this is well explained in our second dvd
[2:39:01.040 --> 2:39:04.880]  the emerging science global warming emerging science dvd that alex now
[2:39:04.880 --> 2:39:09.120]  has uh it is absolutely night and day what the
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:12.640]  models predict was going to happen the last 40 to 50 years
[2:39:12.640 --> 2:39:16.240]  and what has actually happened they're not the same at all i said
[2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:18.800]  another company explain this to me though because
[2:39:18.800 --> 2:39:22.560]  you know there's other big major films like the great global warming swindle
[2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:26.240]  they have all these climatologists and scientists and physicists from around
[2:39:26.240 --> 2:39:30.640]  the world literally the top names there's now 37 000 of them have sent a
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:33.920]  letter and petition to the government the government won't even read it won't
[2:39:33.920 --> 2:39:38.160]  allow him in testimony only al gore who lies and says he invented
[2:39:38.160 --> 2:39:41.760]  everything from kitty hawk to you know to fire
[2:39:41.760 --> 2:39:46.400]  is is is is is the only expert up there he openly owns one of the carbon
[2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:48.960]  companies and said what's wrong with me making money
[2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:53.280]  i mean it's the outrageousness of this but but also they say it's not just the
[2:39:53.280 --> 2:39:56.240]  heat from the sun it's that different type of
[2:39:56.240 --> 2:40:00.960]  nuclei particles come into the atmosphere can you explain that
[2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:05.280]  yes there's two and as well as again explained uh in much better graphics than
[2:40:05.280 --> 2:40:09.280]  it did in the first one in this new emerging science dvd
[2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:13.200]  really shows very clearly it's not the total amount of energy that the sonny
[2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:17.440]  met but the kind of energy you have incoming cosmic
[2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:21.200]  radiation from exposing supernovae from out in the
[2:40:21.200 --> 2:40:24.240]  galaxy and so forth that eventually get to earth
[2:40:24.240 --> 2:40:28.320]  those and it's been shown in experiments now to be correct
[2:40:28.320 --> 2:40:32.720]  those cosmic radiation particles when they enter the earth surface
[2:40:32.720 --> 2:40:37.680]  or enter the earth's atmosphere they start to condense out and ionize
[2:40:37.680 --> 2:40:42.800]  and create water droplets when they create water droplets clouds eventually
[2:40:42.800 --> 2:40:46.240]  form and when you have clouds low elevation clouds if you ever
[2:40:46.240 --> 2:40:51.040]  flown an airplane above these clouds it is a bright white
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:54.080]  that's because the sun is reflecting off of those clouds
[2:40:54.080 --> 2:40:58.000]  now let me understand so it's almost like just the space rays not just the
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:01.280]  sun's rays and this whole spectrum of different particles
[2:41:01.280 --> 2:41:05.840]  come in like like microscopic meteorites and create almost
[2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:10.560]  a energy field which then generates the nuclei
[2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:14.480]  to allow the rain droplets to form so it's a beautiful it it's a beautiful
[2:41:14.480 --> 2:41:18.080]  engine it's not a crime and carbon dioxide's what plants
[2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:21.680]  breathe it's not a chemical weapon that'll kill you
[2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:25.920]  water's good oxygen's good it's not with alkyda
[2:41:25.920 --> 2:41:29.440]  absolutely in fact we can probably have three to four hundred percent increase
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:32.720]  in our carbon dioxide and the earth would be much better off for it
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:36.320]  both plant productivity food production and it will not hurt us
[2:41:36.320 --> 2:41:40.000]  in fact i've seen those studies that during during some of the warming
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  periods with the dinosaurs were the most plentiful that it was many times
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:46.800]  higher and that the earth was much more tropical
[2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:50.640]  yeah absolutely probably about 10 times greater concentration during those
[2:41:50.640 --> 2:41:54.960]  that period of time uh and the earth was much more tropical
[2:41:54.960 --> 2:41:58.240]  uh vegetation was flourishing and abundant
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:02.000]  and every time in fact we have the science has actually shown that there's
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:06.160]  been a 12 percent increase in food production global food production
[2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:09.440]  because of the increased carbon dioxide we've had the last 50 years
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:13.280]  there's nothing negative about carbon dioxide is all positive but yet they're
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:16.960]  calling it a pollutant and because it's a pollutant
[2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:22.640]  then they can control our lives but i've done the day the dihydrogen
[2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:26.560]  monoxide joke with people at restaurants on the street and i tend to
[2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:31.280]  go out with a camera and do it because you can say hey we need to
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:34.640]  restrict carbon dioxide right and they go yes it's evil and i go what about
[2:42:34.640 --> 2:42:39.040]  dihydrogen monoxide it's in the water and almost every adult even
[2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:41.920]  people in suits downtown will go yes ban it
[2:42:41.920 --> 2:42:48.000]  it's water i assure the viewers people that support this that water is not bad
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:51.200]  absolutely you know it is amazing
[2:42:51.200 --> 2:42:54.560]  we have been so sensitized in our educational process
[2:42:54.560 --> 2:42:59.200]  that anything chemical is bad for us well i'm afraid to anything that we eat
[2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:02.400]  drink or otherwise is chemical and the fact that
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:06.320]  we have this version to the main chemical uh is
[2:43:06.320 --> 2:43:10.320]  been ingrained in us in our educational process in the television ads
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:15.520]  all the rest of it so that we just re-coil away from it
[2:43:15.520 --> 2:43:18.720]  and we shouldn't we have to understand what it is
[2:43:18.720 --> 2:43:22.320]  and then treat it accordingly what about the brainwashing did you know that
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:26.240]  there are scores of video games where where the zombies are carbon
[2:43:26.240 --> 2:43:30.880]  dioxide blobs and the kids shoot them and then it's just total brainwashing
[2:43:30.880 --> 2:43:34.400]  in the schools and the new york times reports that kids go home and
[2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:37.760]  write mock tickets to their mother because they take a hot bath and the
[2:43:37.760 --> 2:43:41.360]  mother goes i'm glad they're ordering me around this i mean they're turning us
[2:43:41.360 --> 2:43:44.640]  into a total stasi society what about the green bill
[2:43:44.640 --> 2:43:47.920]  with the home inspections in the federal language about
[2:43:47.920 --> 2:43:51.360]  uh they can kick you out of your house no judge no jury
[2:43:51.360 --> 2:43:55.920]  just i mean this is total tyranny it is total tyranny and you and i have and
[2:43:55.920 --> 2:44:01.280]  others have been warning the people for 15 years or more about this very thing
[2:44:01.280 --> 2:44:06.240]  it's now right in front of us and we have the last opportunity to stop it
[2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:09.760]  by calling your congressmen and senators and saying no i'm going to throw you
[2:44:09.760 --> 2:44:13.280]  out of office if you vote for these things and there's just not one thing
[2:44:13.280 --> 2:44:17.200]  there's a dozen of them out there it would be best if we just shut down
[2:44:17.200 --> 2:44:20.800]  congress and they didn't do anything for four years i agree now for those that
[2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:24.880]  don't know dihydrogen monoxide is the scientific term for water
[2:44:24.880 --> 2:44:28.400]  and i was just making the point that ask your friends or family
[2:44:28.400 --> 2:44:32.400]  but but put it in a carbon dioxide debate say for the environment shouldn't we
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:38.080]  have a carbon uh tax on dihydrogen monoxide you can also give them the
[2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:42.720]  scientific name for salt and nine times out of 10 they'll say ban it
[2:44:42.720 --> 2:44:46.080]  and right now you said you said there's about a dozen
[2:44:46.080 --> 2:44:49.200]  there's the climate change bill the carbon tax bills
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:54.560]  the water uh clean water restoration act uh there's the rewilding all these
[2:44:54.560 --> 2:44:58.160]  things you warned about they're now trying to ramp through right now
[2:44:58.160 --> 2:45:01.600]  because they think obama's got control of the entire government tell us about
[2:45:01.600 --> 2:45:04.240]  some of the things that they're trying to push through
[2:45:04.240 --> 2:45:07.760]  well i think that the water bill the clean water bill reenactment
[2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:12.080]  is really dangerous it basically puts you're talking about
[2:45:12.080 --> 2:45:16.160]  our economy with the clean cap and trade legislation with the water you're
[2:45:16.160 --> 2:45:20.400]  taking control over water which you need every single day to live
[2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:24.640]  and if the federal government controls the water of every acre of land in the
[2:45:24.640 --> 2:45:28.400]  united states it controls you and i period i mean it controls our crop
[2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:32.160]  production controls everything and as a consequence
[2:45:32.160 --> 2:45:35.680]  uh you look at what these bills do and every single one of them
[2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:41.680]  draws control over a basic thing in our society that we need to have to live
[2:45:41.680 --> 2:45:45.840]  and once that is done then the federal government basically controls us
[2:45:45.840 --> 2:45:49.120]  you have no choice in the matter you have to do what they say just like they
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:52.480]  did in the old phobia union or you're thrown out of your house you're you're
[2:45:52.480 --> 2:45:55.200]  prevented from buying food you're in you name it
[2:45:55.200 --> 2:45:59.040]  and i'm not saying it's going to happen next year but they have that potential
[2:45:59.040 --> 2:46:02.320]  they have the right to do it now once these laws pass
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:05.840]  and there has been no time in all of history where a bad bill like that has
[2:46:05.840 --> 2:46:09.360]  been passed legislation been the roman empire whatever
[2:46:09.360 --> 2:46:13.520]  that it hasn't been abused well listen i have every time
[2:46:13.520 --> 2:46:16.640]  exactly i have the head of city year federally funded
[2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:20.960]  these youth brigades in red and black uniforms people can google city year and
[2:46:20.960 --> 2:46:23.680]  watch them doing their chanting and drilling
[2:46:23.680 --> 2:46:27.680]  and where everything's so bankrupt now you have to get a job with the government
[2:46:27.680 --> 2:46:32.640]  out of high school doing this and it says i have national newscast saying
[2:46:32.640 --> 2:46:38.400]  they're going to have quasi-governmental groups mainly young stupid uh you know
[2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:42.240]  ignorant power-tripping young people and it already
[2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:48.480]  shown them on the news that say climate police out shouting people down like
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:53.440]  mousy tongues uh youth brigades that actually that's how they're modeled and

[2:46:57.280 --> 2:47:01.440]  china i'm not making this up i have the newscast waving them as they scream at
[2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:05.600]  you and already in austin if you park an suv by barton springs

[2:47:17.200 --> 2:47:20.800]  on us i mean this is nightmarish dr kothman

[2:47:25.360 --> 2:47:30.560]  uh in china you name it is we're following the same pattern of all this
[2:47:30.560 --> 2:47:34.160]  death all these despots in the past can't we see that
[2:47:34.160 --> 2:47:38.080]  you know we have been worrying about it for years decades even
[2:47:38.080 --> 2:47:42.240]  and here it is it's at our doorstep and everybody's yawning well not everybody
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:45.520]  in the listening audience i doubt that but for the most part
[2:47:45.520 --> 2:47:49.840]  society is yawning and i just cannot believe how they could be missing
[2:47:49.840 --> 2:47:52.720]  that you know everything is going to work out all right honey don't worry about
[2:47:52.720 --> 2:47:56.320]  it it's going to work out with those people will never do anything like that
[2:47:56.320 --> 2:48:00.000]  well i'm sorry folks history shows that those people will do exactly what we're
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:03.280]  talking about given the opportunity and they are creating that opportunity
[2:48:03.280 --> 2:48:07.840]  right now well they say they're going to wall off all the major nafta highways
[2:48:07.840 --> 2:48:12.000]  and keep what half the i mean i mean you've put together the maps off their
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:16.640]  own documents where half the country's awful limits to us and
[2:48:16.640 --> 2:48:20.400]  and everywhere they get control they they are rewilding they are
[2:48:20.400 --> 2:48:23.680]  all over the west harassing people off their own property i mean
[2:48:23.680 --> 2:48:28.720]  this is going on it is it really is we haven't heard a lot about it in the
[2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:32.640]  major urban areas because uh they have deliberately
[2:48:32.640 --> 2:48:36.480]  basically compartmentalized everything in this country so that we do not hear
[2:48:36.480 --> 2:48:38.560]  what's going on in another part of the country
[2:48:38.560 --> 2:48:41.360]  i go and talk to different groups in different parts of the country and they
[2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:43.680]  think that they're the only ones this is happening to
[2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:47.840]  it's happening to everyone and we need to read our property rights are being
[2:48:47.840 --> 2:48:52.240]  destroyed you have the kilo case back in 2005 that basically changed
[2:48:52.240 --> 2:48:54.880]  the fifth amendment from public use to public
[2:48:54.880 --> 2:48:59.040]  purpose uh it got to the whole purpose of property
[2:48:59.040 --> 2:49:03.120]  rights protection of the government i mean you name it it's been stepwise
[2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:06.240]  one by one by one our protections are falling
[2:49:06.240 --> 2:49:10.880]  and now they're cascading uh i have never seen such a push
[2:49:10.880 --> 2:49:16.160]  so fast so hard uh as we've seen since obama has become president we all knew
[2:49:16.160 --> 2:49:19.120]  it was going to be bad but i even i didn't realize it's going to be this
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:21.520]  bad well i've got it here in my folders i'm digging
[2:49:21.520 --> 2:49:25.520]  around for it right now i'll probably find her in the break but
[2:49:25.520 --> 2:49:29.920]  hundreds of articles a week saying babies are bad they have a big carbon footprint
[2:49:29.920 --> 2:49:32.800]  we need to ban having babies or put taxes on them
[2:49:32.800 --> 2:49:37.200]  and australia is actually trying to pass laws they're getting rid of the baby
[2:49:37.200 --> 2:49:42.160]  credits in california uh they're in women's magazines telling women
[2:49:42.160 --> 2:49:46.640]  marriage isn't good breaking up with your family's good don't have kids
[2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:51.280]  i mean this is a real culture of death but humans have a hunger for life
[2:49:51.280 --> 2:49:53.920]  i think they're going to have trouble implementing this i mean they're in
[2:49:53.920 --> 2:49:57.680]  power is what i'm saying and it's one thing to pass the laws
[2:49:57.680 --> 2:50:01.280]  it's another thing to be able to actually put this stuff into place
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:04.640]  yeah that is very true and it's amazing last year
[2:50:04.640 --> 2:50:08.320]  maybe maybe 14 15 months ago 80 percent of the
[2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:11.760]  population here in the united states believe that global warming was
[2:50:11.760 --> 2:50:15.280]  generally caused by men not not you know maybe they weren't a hard believer
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:19.280]  but 80 percent that's down to 44 percent now
[2:50:19.280 --> 2:50:24.560]  and people are beginning to wake up and it's been programs like this and others
[2:50:24.560 --> 2:50:28.240]  that are starting to really sink home when they start to see
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:31.840]  obama doing all these things and they've heard you know the are crazy
[2:50:31.840 --> 2:50:35.440]  con or crazy comments and so forth over the last few years
[2:50:35.440 --> 2:50:38.080]  all of a sudden they start to see it happen and they say oh my gosh maybe
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:41.840]  they're right uh you look at the the health care
[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:45.440]  60 percent of the american people two-thirds do not want to have
[2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:48.960]  the present health care in the house of representative and that's when they
[2:50:48.960 --> 2:50:52.000]  don't even know how bad it really is thunder michael
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.880]  caubman stay there let's talk more about this good news though
[2:50:54.880 --> 2:50:58.560]  the people are waking up that's why the establishment's kind of flipping out
[2:50:58.560 --> 2:51:02.160]  now an orgy of propaganda in an attempt to batter human control
[2:51:02.160 --> 2:51:06.640]  mankind's oldest natural antibiotic this very special mineral has been used

[3:00:01.840 --> 3:00:15.200]  it's our final segment of Dr. Michael Kauffman
[3:00:15.920 --> 3:00:19.680]  the entire planet's being issued through international treaty it's id cards
[3:00:19.680 --> 3:00:23.440]  under biometrics that'll be the new world currency will just be a casual
[3:00:23.440 --> 3:00:26.320]  system here's the times of london india issues
[3:00:26.320 --> 3:00:30.160]  all 1.2 billion citizens with biometric id cards
[3:00:30.160 --> 3:00:33.680]  and they say hey we've got lots of health care lots of government help
[3:00:33.680 --> 3:00:38.960]  just buy and sell with this card and then now they can micromanage society
[3:00:38.960 --> 3:00:42.960]  now the social planners can control things that's what the environmental
[3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:46.480]  movement admits they're about cutting off resources
[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:52.640]  to force the destruction of growth then to implode society
[3:00:52.640 --> 3:00:56.240]  to make you become domesticated dr. Michael Kauffman
[3:00:56.240 --> 3:00:59.840]  i wanted to continue to talk about the film global warming emerging science
[3:00:59.840 --> 3:01:03.600]  and understanding here in this final segment we're carrying this and your
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:06.320]  other documentary on global warming or global
[3:01:06.320 --> 3:01:10.320]  governance everyone needs to see this just because
[3:01:10.320 --> 3:01:16.240]  our listeners may know all about this their friends their family other
[3:01:16.240 --> 3:01:20.720]  school teachers people don't know and so we need to reach out
[3:01:20.720 --> 3:01:24.080]  and educate the public even if they pass these global carbon taxes
[3:01:24.080 --> 3:01:27.120]  we've got to fight it and expose it so we can repeal it
[3:01:27.120 --> 3:01:30.480]  dr. Kauffman absolutely there is no question about that and one of the
[3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:35.280]  reasons we did this second dvd was to bring new brand new information into
[3:01:35.280 --> 3:01:40.160]  the debate as well as formatted in a way that you can give to your friends and
[3:01:40.160 --> 3:01:43.360]  neighbors in a very easy to understand format
[3:01:43.360 --> 3:01:46.800]  you can give it to your sixth school science teachers it's designed for
[3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:52.080]  school club uh... classroom showing to combat al gore's inconvenient truth
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:55.760]  it's designed to share with other people you can make copies of it
[3:01:55.760 --> 3:01:59.360]  uh... to share not to sell it but to make copies to get your friends and
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:02.480]  neighbors and to your school teachers and so forth
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:06.960]  to try to spread this word because once they see this and it's extremely well
[3:02:06.960 --> 3:02:10.640]  done folks this is uh... order manager better than my first
[3:02:10.640 --> 3:02:16.560]  documentary and it is very conclusive i have got nothing but rave reviews from
[3:02:16.560 --> 3:02:20.960]  uh... a variety of sources including kids down to about ten years old so
[3:02:20.960 --> 3:02:25.360]  it is really a dynamic video that just takes the starch right out of the need
[3:02:25.360 --> 3:02:29.040]  for even having cap and trade legislation
[3:02:29.040 --> 3:02:33.040]  absolutely let me just ask you a side issue what feedback have you gotten
[3:02:33.040 --> 3:02:36.320]  now two years into endgame being out because
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:40.480]  endgame is is i think my best film my most important film
[3:02:40.480 --> 3:02:44.160]  uh... obama deceptions my biggest film because it shatters the left-right
[3:02:44.160 --> 3:02:48.000]  paradigm and shows his real agenda and it covers some eugenics
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:53.040]  what feedback have you gotten being in the endgame very heavy feedback uh...
[3:02:53.040 --> 3:02:57.680]  alex from a lot of people calling to find out exactly because i'm only on there
[3:02:57.680 --> 3:03:02.320]  for maybe five minutes totally uh... finding out my view on what the whole
[3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:05.760]  dvd is about and again i'm not an expert on eugenics so i have to
[3:03:05.760 --> 3:03:08.720]  say basically i know about as much as you do on that issue
[3:03:08.720 --> 3:03:11.760]  but nonetheless people are very interested in it
[3:03:11.760 --> 3:03:15.760]  they when i say that it's actually worse than what you portrayed on that but we
[3:03:15.760 --> 3:03:19.600]  can't really say that is bad enough what we say on that dvd
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:23.920]  uh... if they we need to understand it and believe it and people walk away
[3:03:23.920 --> 3:03:26.480]  with their head get interrupted on the streets
[3:03:26.480 --> 3:03:29.520]  uh... people who know me and have seen endgame and so forth and ask me
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:32.800]  questions it's been an extremely effective dvd
[3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:37.200]  well we need to make your new film as prolific as endgame global warming
[3:03:37.200 --> 3:03:40.560]  emerging science and understanding available at info wars dot com
[3:03:40.560 --> 3:03:44.880]  or by calling toll free eight eight eight two five three three one three nine
[3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:48.080]  eight eight eight two five three three one three nine
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:52.240]  well i'm gonna be really hammering the eugenics issue the global carbon tax
[3:03:52.240 --> 3:03:56.240]  issue as we try to defeat what's happening in the senate
[3:03:56.240 --> 3:03:59.200]  it looks like we may be able to stop it because
[3:03:59.200 --> 3:04:03.040]  they were able to hide the bill three hundred pages of it until it passed
[3:04:03.040 --> 3:04:07.040]  now though it is public and i think it may get beaten but they're not going to
[3:04:07.040 --> 3:04:10.240]  stop there so we're definitely in a serious fight
[3:04:10.240 --> 3:04:13.920]  yes we definitely are and we need to keep the fight up not only with
[3:04:13.920 --> 3:04:17.120]  with global warming that's where i'm focusing right now my efforts because
[3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:21.200]  you don't do one thing at a time but this water issue is crisis the
[3:04:21.200 --> 3:04:24.080]  health care issue is a crisis all of these things
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:27.840]  we need to be active and just calling your senators and congressman and say no
[3:04:27.840 --> 3:04:31.040]  we're not going to vote for that if you do i'm not going to
[3:04:31.040 --> 3:04:34.800]  i'm going to do everything i can to see that you're not elected again
[3:04:34.800 --> 3:04:38.560]  and i think i would really encourage some state where they really have an
[3:04:38.560 --> 3:04:42.400]  ability to get in there and recall some of their senators
[3:04:42.400 --> 3:04:46.240]  and congressman when they vote for these disc garbages without even reading
[3:04:46.240 --> 3:04:48.800]  well i agree you know that ties into the eugenics
[3:04:48.800 --> 3:04:51.840]  the government run health care that's the they want to carry their eugenics out
[3:04:51.840 --> 3:04:55.360]  against us including forced abortions as the white house chief says
[3:04:55.360 --> 3:04:58.160]  science chief dr coffman great having you with us

[3:08:06.800 --> 3:08:10.560]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[3:08:10.560 --> 3:08:16.800]  and the gcn radio network vto congeny jr got back from iraq
[3:08:16.800 --> 3:08:20.240]  as a veteran thought he'd open a little italian food restaurant
[3:08:20.240 --> 3:08:22.400]  they said yeah we'll give you the permits go ahead and we'll give you a
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:26.640]  liquor license and they said no so he flew an american flag upside down
[3:08:26.640 --> 3:08:30.320]  which means america's in deep trouble when the socialist bureaucrats
[3:08:30.320 --> 3:08:35.200]  control as a slave so much that we can't even have our own restaurant
[3:08:35.200 --> 3:08:39.040]  well the police came and took the flag and they said you don't do that boy
[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:43.920]  because in america you lick boots that's what this is all about now
[3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:46.880]  now of course the country is in crisis the whole bill of rights whole
[3:08:46.880 --> 3:08:50.800]  constitutions imploding the federal government seizing the big automakers
[3:08:50.800 --> 3:08:53.920]  handing it over to the chinese and brazilians and russians
[3:08:53.920 --> 3:08:59.760]  giving them gm the big pieces that were operating well like hummer and saturn
[3:08:59.760 --> 3:09:04.720]  foreign banks have stolen 14.8 trillion but seat of a lot of americans patriotism
[3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:08.560]  means if at all hitler put an american flag on his back and
[3:09:08.560 --> 3:09:12.720]  return from the dead half the public would just meal
[3:09:12.720 --> 3:09:17.760]  i mean if joseph stalin teleported in a time machine and was speaking russian
[3:09:17.760 --> 3:09:21.680]  and but wearing a suit that had the american flag on it
[3:09:21.680 --> 3:09:24.640]  the public is like under mind control they see an american flag they just
[3:09:24.640 --> 3:09:28.480]  kneel and so they don't even care if that means the
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:31.840]  country's in distress and that's not disrespectful to the flag but even if you
[3:09:31.840 --> 3:09:35.120]  do something disrespectful that's your first amendment because the flag
[3:09:35.120 --> 3:09:38.720]  symbolizes that first amendment and freedom and if you don't have the spirit
[3:09:38.720 --> 3:09:43.200]  of it and the flag is just a you know red white and blue so that's why the
[3:09:43.200 --> 3:09:47.040]  story is so important here's the local newscast where you can see people trying
[3:09:47.040 --> 3:09:51.360]  to pull the flag down the cop standing by and then
[3:09:51.360 --> 3:09:56.240]  our guest says that the police came and took this flag so uh this is how they
[3:09:56.240 --> 3:10:01.520]  roll might as well be the soviet union here it is
[3:10:01.520 --> 3:10:06.000]  flying upside down in privates to protest a decision made by the village
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:09.840]  tonight that symbol is dividing the small community
[3:10:09.840 --> 3:10:14.080]  nbc-26 reporter rachel stockman is interested in more
[3:10:14.080 --> 3:10:17.440]  what started off as a question about whether this restaurant could get a
[3:10:17.440 --> 3:10:20.960]  liquor license has now turned into a full-fledged
[3:10:20.960 --> 3:10:25.680]  village brawl and the question now is this flag a sign of distress
[3:10:25.680 --> 3:10:30.400]  and where someone's constitutional rights violated it's a flag in distress
[3:10:30.400 --> 3:10:34.480]  that some argue is a sign of disgrace so upsetting for this man
[3:10:34.480 --> 3:10:41.040]  he came with a knife to cut it down raise the flag properly
[3:10:41.040 --> 3:10:44.560]  you are violating the law and you are trespassing i don't care
[3:10:44.560 --> 3:10:48.080]  you're trespassing on but it's upside down for a reason
[3:10:48.080 --> 3:10:51.840]  a reason we'll get to soon but first oh god bring it down
[3:10:51.840 --> 3:10:55.920]  this is a sign of the deep division in this community that started at village
[3:10:55.920 --> 3:10:59.520]  hall and vito congenies supper club that'll be
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:03.840]  a small dining area vito says he can't open the restaurant because the village
[3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:07.760]  denied his liquor license a license he says he was promised
[3:11:07.760 --> 3:11:10.400]  we put everything that we owned into this
[3:11:10.400 --> 3:11:14.080]  we're about a hundred and eighty thousand dollars in debt right now
[3:11:14.080 --> 3:11:17.920]  so to show his distress he raised this flag i've been to war
[3:11:17.920 --> 3:11:22.240]  more than once i'd go over to other countries to fight tyrannical governments
[3:11:22.240 --> 3:11:24.640]  from doing whatever they want to their citizens
[3:11:24.640 --> 3:11:28.560]  and then i have to come home and deal with that here that's not fair
[3:11:28.560 --> 3:11:32.720]  it's not right that the american people should have to fear their local
[3:11:32.720 --> 3:11:35.840]  government bodies but if you ask the man standing on
[3:11:35.840 --> 3:11:39.680]  veto's roof he disagree and so apparently do the village cops
[3:11:39.680 --> 3:11:43.920]  i saw the village police the two full-time officers and two part-time
[3:11:43.920 --> 3:11:48.720]  officers stealing my american flag from vito congenies flagpole
[3:11:48.720 --> 3:11:52.320]  the village would only issue this statement the liquor license was denied
[3:11:52.320 --> 3:11:55.360]  for economic reasons and due to potential legal action
[3:11:55.360 --> 3:11:58.640]  the board will make no further comment as for this man
[3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:03.040]  maronet county deputies came and told him to leave but that's likely not the end
[3:12:03.040 --> 3:12:08.240]  of this dispute veto plans to appeal the village's actions at court in your
[3:12:08.240 --> 3:12:11.440]  corner and the rest of it's up on info wars dot
[3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:14.080]  com and prison punna dot com look we're gonna go
[3:12:14.080 --> 3:12:17.680]  to veto here in just a moment i just want to say this illustrates everything
[3:12:17.680 --> 3:12:22.880]  this little report you've always in every town got these empty men
[3:12:22.880 --> 3:12:26.800]  and they're always saluting the flag and acting real weird and if you criticize
[3:12:26.800 --> 3:12:28.960]  the government they say you're not a patriot
[3:12:28.960 --> 3:12:33.760]  it's patriotic to limit the government to criticize it
[3:12:33.760 --> 3:12:39.280]  the government is in our country we are the bill of rights and constitution is
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:42.960]  and i have seen similar things you know uh we sell a t-shirt that has the
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:46.560]  american flag upside down on it and it says save
[3:12:46.560 --> 3:12:50.720]  the usa i mean the us is being taken over in a foreign
[3:12:50.720 --> 3:12:55.120]  offshore corporate takeover and it's got paul revere on the front
[3:12:55.120 --> 3:12:59.920]  now according to the dhs report they say watch out for returning vets watch out
[3:12:59.920 --> 3:13:02.720]  for gun owners watch out for people that don't like the fellow reserve
[3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:07.200]  see and and if they tell these goons you saw on there
[3:13:07.200 --> 3:13:10.400]  that that go arrest americans it's patriotic they'll do it
[3:13:10.400 --> 3:13:14.800]  they're ready and they get real emotional over petty stupid stuff but
[3:13:14.800 --> 3:13:19.760]  then they flip out i mean they'll get upset about the flag or
[3:13:19.760 --> 3:13:22.800]  something not knowing it's a sign of distress and then violate somebody's
[3:13:22.800 --> 3:13:25.520]  property rights and first amendment but then they don't care about foreign
[3:13:25.520 --> 3:13:27.600]  banks raping us bill of rights on fire
[3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:32.080]  country going to hell in a hand basket so this story documents at all
[3:13:32.080 --> 3:13:36.640]  veto congenie jr who's not even in wisconsin right now he's in illinois
[3:13:36.640 --> 3:13:40.240]  looking for work uh and i guess the petty bureaucrats
[3:13:40.240 --> 3:13:43.440]  who promised him the license not gonna get it
[3:13:43.440 --> 3:13:47.920]  uh joining us uh thank you for coming on sir thank you for having me today i
[3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:50.800]  appreciate it i don't know how you didn't haul off and punch
[3:13:50.800 --> 3:13:55.040]  that guy he's on your property trying to take your property
[3:13:55.040 --> 3:14:00.400]  and uh he's just out of his mind i mean is that guy all there i mean he's up
[3:14:00.400 --> 3:14:04.640]  there saluting the flag like he just saved america from al-qaeda
[3:14:04.640 --> 3:14:08.560]  and he's on a property owners a veteran's own property
[3:14:08.560 --> 3:14:12.400]  trying to steal his property i think he had a few too many this morning
[3:14:12.400 --> 3:14:16.880]  that morning that that had happened uh the problem with it is
[3:14:16.880 --> 3:14:20.640]  he lets people tell him what he should think and what he should know instead
[3:14:20.640 --> 3:14:24.560]  of thinking and reading for himself
[3:14:24.560 --> 3:14:28.160]  amazing he actually thought that i was being disrespectful to the flag and that
[3:14:28.160 --> 3:14:32.400]  is not a sign of disrespect it is a sign of distress
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:37.840]  i have no intention nor would i ever disrespect the united states flag or
[3:14:37.840 --> 3:14:42.080]  this great country we need to stand up and take
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:45.360]  our freedoms and stop taking them for granted
[3:14:45.360 --> 3:14:48.880]  and realize you have to be willing to fight for it i've been to a few wars
[3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:52.720]  here i know what it's like for people not to have a freedom
[3:14:52.720 --> 3:14:56.400]  believe me i'm going to fight tooth and nail until my dying breath
[3:14:56.400 --> 3:15:00.400]  to keep my freedoms and freedom of speech is one of the most important ones
[3:15:00.400 --> 3:15:03.920]  we have and if they don't think that that first amendment is so important
[3:15:03.920 --> 3:15:07.040]  important to them they better realize the other items that are mentioned in that
[3:15:07.040 --> 3:15:09.920]  first amendment your freedom of choice of religion
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:14.640]  and your freedom of choice to question your government and a peaceful
[3:15:14.640 --> 3:15:20.400]  ensemble of people and the freedom of the press let's not forget that
[3:15:20.400 --> 3:15:24.080]  and the freedom of the right to assembly as you said
[3:15:24.080 --> 3:15:28.000]  so obviously that newscast is just a short snapshot
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  how did all this begin what's really going on what's your neighbor saying he
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:36.560]  sees the police taking your flag i mean are they really that stupid that that
[3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:40.160]  they don't understand it's your first amendment right and it's a sign
[3:15:40.160 --> 3:15:43.520]  of i'm in trouble help me that would be disrespectful
[3:15:43.520 --> 3:15:49.120]  to fly that flag right side up if the if the country is in crisis you're supposed
[3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:53.440]  to use the flag as a communication tool absolutely
[3:15:53.440 --> 3:15:56.880]  well the problem was not only it even gets worse
[3:15:56.880 --> 3:16:02.000]  not only did the police come to my place of business on the 4th of july on my
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:06.240]  private property with no warning no warrant but the district attorney from
[3:16:06.240 --> 3:16:10.400]  marinet county instructed them to do so since then he has
[3:16:10.400 --> 3:16:14.320]  actually gone on national tv and said i know i was doing wrong but i did it
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:18.400]  anyway now here's somebody who's supposed to know the law an educated
[3:16:18.400 --> 3:16:22.960]  man of the law and he decided to openly violate the law
[3:16:22.960 --> 3:16:28.400]  himself and who's going to prosecute him nobody
[3:16:30.560 --> 3:16:34.160]  are they that ignorant that they don't know that flying the flag upside down
[3:16:34.160 --> 3:16:38.720]  means distress i have explained it to them
[3:16:38.720 --> 3:16:43.600]  we've actually hung signs on our on my building to explain this to them what
[3:16:43.600 --> 3:16:47.360]  these signs with union side down what it means
[3:16:47.360 --> 3:16:52.320]  that way people can understand it that don't i don't know what more i can do
[3:16:52.320 --> 3:16:56.080]  i've been out there i've talked to these people i read
[3:16:56.080 --> 3:16:59.680]  the u.s flag code to them they just get told
[3:16:59.680 --> 3:17:04.000]  that by somebody that oh he must be meaning disrespect and they go off on
[3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:08.640]  their little tangent and believe it instead of listening to my side of it
[3:17:08.640 --> 3:17:14.640]  but we did have a small uh group of people that came to
[3:17:14.640 --> 3:17:17.600]  with their to show their displeasure and what i'm doing
[3:17:17.600 --> 3:17:21.760]  and about 10 out of those 25 people changed their mind
[3:17:21.760 --> 3:17:25.920]  after they were told why the flag was being blown in distress
[3:17:25.920 --> 3:17:29.520]  so the other 15 are complete morons they're complete look
[3:17:29.520 --> 3:17:33.040]  the thing is america is going to hell in a hand basket they know it
[3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:36.640]  and they don't like seeing a reminder of it they just want america to be
[3:17:36.640 --> 3:17:40.640]  euthanized put to sleep lethal injection
[3:17:40.640 --> 3:17:45.360]  quietly and they want to wrap themselves in the flag and climb into a grave
[3:17:45.360 --> 3:17:48.800]  and uh you know put up with that well they want to bury their heads in the
[3:17:48.800 --> 3:17:52.480]  sand if they're trying to play the ostrich effect and you can't do that
[3:17:52.480 --> 3:17:55.040]  you have to be willing to fight for your freedoms
[3:17:55.040 --> 3:17:59.680]  just like they did in 1776 you have to be well this is just ridiculous this is
[3:17:59.680 --> 3:18:03.680]  ridiculous that they nitty around and get so upset about this and
[3:18:03.680 --> 3:18:09.760]  even when you explain to them the law they just deny it because it feels so good
[3:18:09.760 --> 3:18:13.920]  to nitty around now now now how did this begin
[3:18:13.920 --> 3:18:18.560]  why won't this little area give you the license
[3:18:18.560 --> 3:18:23.120]  to sell beer i actually went to them prior to purchasing the building and
[3:18:23.120 --> 3:18:26.720]  told them what i wanted they approved of everything they said yes we like this
[3:18:26.720 --> 3:18:30.400]  idea would be wonderful for the town then i went to them
[3:18:30.400 --> 3:18:34.800]  in january twice and said i'm ready for it i'll open February 1 they said no
[3:18:34.800 --> 3:18:38.240]  you would be too much competition for the other people in town
[3:18:38.240 --> 3:18:41.920]  and your location they tried to say it was too close to a school
[3:18:41.920 --> 3:18:47.760]  the local ordinance for that is 300 feet i'm almost a thousand feet away from
[3:18:47.760 --> 3:18:50.480]  that school so i met every requirement
[3:18:50.480 --> 3:18:54.320]  plus there are four other reasons that they can deny you a license
[3:18:54.320 --> 3:18:58.160]  i met and surpassed every one of those reasons and i showed that to them
[3:18:58.160 --> 3:19:02.480]  and they still used it the one that gets me the most is that i would be too much
[3:19:02.480 --> 3:19:07.600]  competition how can you say that you can deny competition in the united states
[3:19:07.600 --> 3:19:11.680]  how can you feel that you have that authority that's what makes this country
[3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:15.600]  great is competition how can obama take over gm
[3:19:15.600 --> 3:19:19.760]  i mean they're little social planners as if they're god
[3:19:19.760 --> 3:19:22.640]  exactly you can't do that you can't allow the government
[3:19:22.640 --> 3:19:26.720]  to tell you how you're supposed to live that's like if you're more handsome and
[3:19:26.720 --> 3:19:30.560]  you get the beauty queen they come up and say we're going to cut your nose off
[3:19:30.560 --> 3:19:34.160]  so that you're not too handsome so there's no competition i mean that's where all
[3:19:34.160 --> 3:19:38.480]  this ends it can go a lot further it could be
[3:19:38.480 --> 3:19:42.400]  oh you're the wrong color you're the wrong race so we're not going to let you
[3:19:42.400 --> 3:19:47.200]  come up here well
[3:19:48.240 --> 3:19:52.560]  we know why they're just a bunch of control freaks and i'm sure
[3:19:52.560 --> 3:19:55.600]  some other restaurant or something gave them a little bit of money on the side
[3:19:55.600 --> 3:20:07.760]  and let's come back and talk about where this is going

[3:21:09.680 --> 3:21:14.000]  in creating the kind of world order that i think all of us would like to see
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:18.640]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the
[3:21:18.640 --> 3:21:22.480]  best interest of the american people while obama's already fudging
[3:21:22.480 --> 3:21:26.480]  yeah fudged since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a
[3:21:26.480 --> 3:21:29.200]  fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:21:29.200 --> 3:21:32.880]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[3:21:32.880 --> 3:21:38.080]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:41.680]  it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government
[3:21:41.680 --> 3:21:46.640]  this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told

[3:22:07.840 --> 3:22:12.800]  unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food energy housing and medical
[3:22:12.800 --> 3:22:15.920]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line
[3:22:15.920 --> 3:22:19.440]  is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the federal
[3:22:19.440 --> 3:22:21.920]  reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt
[3:22:21.920 --> 3:22:25.840]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes these questions and more can be answered

[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:06.080]  they won't even let you open you got to have wine an italian restaurant
[3:25:06.080 --> 3:25:09.360]  i mean that's just you know that goes good like a horse in carriage i wouldn't
[3:25:09.360 --> 3:25:12.320]  go to an italian restaurant at least back when i was drinking
[3:25:12.320 --> 3:25:16.480]  you know occasionally without red wine i mean that's something you got to have
[3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:19.840]  uh and they just don't care i mean all you've got to sue them that's pure
[3:25:19.840 --> 3:25:24.480]  discrimination that they said to you and i would call them again in
[3:25:24.480 --> 3:25:28.240]  record of saying at this time that oh that would be competition i mean are
[3:25:28.240 --> 3:25:32.080]  they like the gods the fairy godmother that waves their wand
[3:25:32.080 --> 3:25:36.800]  well that's what licensing does it turns us into slaves
[3:25:36.800 --> 3:25:41.120]  yes it does and as you said i need to sue them but unfortunately
[3:25:41.120 --> 3:25:44.080]  you can't really find an attorney who's trying to
[3:25:44.080 --> 3:25:47.600]  you know feed his family to sue him municipality because they're worried
[3:25:47.600 --> 3:25:52.320]  about people not coming in and using them as attorneys
[3:25:52.320 --> 3:25:54.640]  they just don't want to fight the municipality
[3:25:54.640 --> 3:25:58.880]  they don't want to try to get a bad name themselves in the town
[3:25:58.880 --> 3:26:02.320]  that's when the clu found out about the
[3:26:02.320 --> 3:26:06.000]  the uh violation of my first amendment rights and now they're considering
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:08.880]  taking it on they haven't agreed to do so yet but they are
[3:26:08.880 --> 3:26:14.320]  taking it under consideration well why don't these local boss hogs on power
[3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:17.760]  trips just apologize i mean they're obviously boss hogs
[3:26:17.760 --> 3:26:21.040]  if the police come and steal the flag i mean
[3:26:21.040 --> 3:26:25.040]  or are they just or are they just ignorant
[3:26:25.040 --> 3:26:29.120]  they actually came on my property no warrant no warning no phone call
[3:26:29.120 --> 3:26:34.480]  nothing and literally went there took the flag down from the pole and left with
[3:26:34.480 --> 3:26:38.160]  it and when my neighbor saw what they were doing he tried to stop them and
[3:26:38.160 --> 3:26:42.000]  they threatened him with arrest if he tried to interfere
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:46.400]  now there was a case in renown avada where they were flying a mexican flag
[3:26:46.400 --> 3:26:50.400]  above an american flag and the guy went and cut it down and got in
[3:26:50.400 --> 3:26:53.280]  trouble we had him on but i guess that's okay
[3:26:53.280 --> 3:26:56.480]  just don't fly the american flag upside down i guess if you would have
[3:26:56.480 --> 3:26:59.680]  urinated on it or something they would have been happy
[3:26:59.680 --> 3:27:03.280]  actually that's part of the u.s flag code and
[3:27:03.280 --> 3:27:07.600]  i am following the u.s flag code if you defecate or spit on the flag that is
[3:27:07.600 --> 3:27:11.440]  illegal but if you hang it upside down union side down
[3:27:11.440 --> 3:27:16.160]  that is part of the u.s flag code if they signal of distress it is not a sign of
[3:27:16.160 --> 3:27:19.360]  disrespect what no i know these people are just morons are they
[3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:23.120]  starting to get embarrassed that that the national
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:27.440]  media is covering the fact that that's a that that it's a sign of
[3:27:27.440 --> 3:27:29.840]  distress and you're right to do it or are they just
[3:27:29.840 --> 3:27:33.680]  sticking their thumbs in their mouths and sucking them and saying i don't care
[3:27:33.680 --> 3:27:37.360]  well you know it's hard to say because they're village attorneys that's
[3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:40.320]  attended the meeting for the licensing and everything
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:44.720]  they asked them they asked their attorney can we deny him for this reason
[3:27:44.720 --> 3:27:48.160]  and he told them straight out well if you deny him for that reason he's going
[3:27:48.160 --> 3:27:52.080]  to have the ability to come back at you and sue you
[3:27:52.080 --> 3:27:56.560]  and appeal it at the circuit court level and even though he basically told them
[3:27:56.560 --> 3:27:59.680]  you can't do it for that reason they did it anyway
[3:27:59.680 --> 3:28:04.960]  and why are they out to get you i mean are you an outsider i mean is this a
[3:28:04.960 --> 3:28:08.640]  boss hog situation where everybody's married to their mother
[3:28:08.640 --> 3:28:15.760]  pretty much pretty much i moved up there in 1995 i bought my house i bought a
[3:28:15.760 --> 3:28:18.960]  business in 2004 there which was just a bar
[3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:22.800]  camera with a small amount of food and then when i got activated for a rack i
[3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:26.800]  sold out to my partner and i went to a rack and then when i came back i started
[3:28:26.800 --> 3:28:30.400]  looking for another one it took me a couple years and now i just found it
[3:28:30.400 --> 3:28:34.080]  and now i went to them they said yes you'll give it to you and when i go to
[3:28:34.080 --> 3:28:37.440]  them to get the final approval for the license so i can open my door as they
[3:28:37.440 --> 3:28:39.600]  said don't
[3:28:40.800 --> 3:28:44.160]  that is just devastating and and of course they won't give you the liquor
[3:28:44.160 --> 3:28:47.200]  license until after you've already built it that's how it works most places
[3:28:47.200 --> 3:28:51.200]  exactly so so where are you going from here i mean are
[3:28:51.200 --> 3:28:57.280]  you you like to leave the state bankruptcy find another place to live
[3:28:57.280 --> 3:29:01.200]  hopefully they won't throw me me and myself and my wife my family out of our
[3:29:01.200 --> 3:29:04.960]  house on the street you know i'm paying about
[3:29:04.960 --> 3:29:08.960]  ninety seven hundred dollars a month in bills and that was fine until i lost my
[3:29:08.960 --> 3:29:13.120]  job as an electrician in illinois and now i come down here looking for work
[3:29:13.120 --> 3:29:16.320]  pretty much every week and it hasn't been so good
[3:29:16.320 --> 3:29:20.640]  i'll get a week maybe a month and then meanwhile the crazy town won't let you
[3:29:20.640 --> 3:29:24.720]  supply the service of an italian restaurant no no we're just thinking
[3:29:24.720 --> 3:29:28.240]  about it no do you have a website or an email for

[3:31:20.240 --> 3:31:24.400]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[3:31:24.400 --> 3:31:28.000]  is dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[3:31:28.000 --> 3:31:31.600]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again

[3:33:06.640 --> 3:33:11.040]  I hear the train coming it's rolling around the bend
[3:33:11.040 --> 3:33:15.120]  and I ain't seen the sunshine I don't know when
[3:33:15.120 --> 3:33:18.480]  look I don't care if you're black white Hispanic Asian
[3:33:18.480 --> 3:33:23.200]  a cop a fireman school teacher a nuclear physicist
[3:33:23.200 --> 3:33:28.400]  a dentist somebody who bags groceries if you love liberty and
[3:33:28.400 --> 3:33:34.080]  freedom and will stay out of my life I'll stay out of your life
[3:33:34.080 --> 3:33:38.240]  but when people have authority and abuse it they become the number one
[3:33:38.240 --> 3:33:41.600]  enemy and I'm with the founding fathers on that
[3:33:41.600 --> 3:33:44.480]  if you want to go along with these offshore banks and all these chicken neck
[3:33:44.480 --> 3:33:48.880]  criminals then just go right ahead and I tend to get mad at police at a
[3:33:48.880 --> 3:33:51.520]  primitive level because I'm threatened by them
[3:33:51.520 --> 3:33:54.320]  just like at a primitive level if somebody's got a pit bull walking down
[3:33:54.320 --> 3:33:57.520]  the street and kind of starts smiling and doing it towards me I get
[3:33:57.520 --> 3:34:03.200]  threatened and I want to attack them it's an instinct thing
[3:34:03.200 --> 3:34:06.240]  and I know I go over the deep end all the time and
[3:34:06.240 --> 3:34:10.000]  I try to not sit here and play the cop bashing videos constantly and
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:13.280]  believe me folks there's plenty of ammo
[3:34:13.280 --> 3:34:16.800]  but when they're choking some ambulance driver for no reason and then we
[3:34:16.800 --> 3:34:20.320]  get the squad car video and the ambulance didn't even block them and the cop
[3:34:20.320 --> 3:34:24.800]  drove up on them at 100 miles an hour and then acts like a nut
[3:34:24.800 --> 3:34:29.440]  and then lies about it that's a big issue and when the police
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:33.280]  defend that state trooper that's the bigger problem
[3:34:33.280 --> 3:34:37.360]  because there's corrupt people in power that want to promote bad people
[3:34:37.360 --> 3:34:41.600]  and protect bad people but that said there are a lot of police and military
[3:34:41.600 --> 3:34:44.560]  waking up and they send us a lot of documents a
[3:34:44.560 --> 3:34:48.480]  lot of material a lot of information like the myac report and the dhs report
[3:34:48.480 --> 3:34:52.160]  and all these other big reports
[3:34:54.880 --> 3:34:58.560]  people then say well tell us their names on air prove it I don't give up my
[3:34:58.560 --> 3:35:03.280]  sources you want to get them in trouble
[3:35:03.280 --> 3:35:09.520]  the proof of my sources is it comes out that the stories are real
[3:35:09.520 --> 3:35:12.240]  people are so ignorant like reporters aren't supposed to have sources and
[3:35:12.240 --> 3:35:16.160]  you're supposed to give them up the issue is I have a love hate
[3:35:16.160 --> 3:35:18.960]  relationship with the police and the military because I have a lot of family
[3:35:18.960 --> 3:35:22.560]  that are military some that are police they're good people
[3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:26.000]  you know bob daisy's son's a cop you know he's nice
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:28.720]  I know there are a lot of good police but there are a lot of bad ones and when
[3:35:28.720 --> 3:35:32.080]  they do bad things they get defended and protected
[3:35:32.080 --> 3:35:35.680]  because the system is corrupt and is evil and that's a fact
[3:35:35.680 --> 3:35:39.280]  but I get letters like this every day so I thought I'd read this one
[3:35:39.280 --> 3:35:42.560]  and I talk to people who travel around the country in the world
[3:35:42.560 --> 3:35:48.000]  and they see the same thing in fact it isn't just people getting arrested with
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:52.080]  anti-un stickers it's people getting let go that have anti-un stickers
[3:35:52.080 --> 3:35:56.320]  how about we don't arrest people that have
[3:35:57.200 --> 3:36:00.400]  anti-un stickers as their first amendment how about people that have
[3:36:00.400 --> 3:36:04.320]  anti-un stickers don't get special treatment because see once you start
[3:36:04.320 --> 3:36:08.720]  down that road that's the road to tyranny that's another form of tyranny
[3:36:08.720 --> 3:36:16.480]  but here is a letter I got to the alex jones show from john in Tampa Bay
[3:36:16.480 --> 3:36:20.240]  florida activity report for your encouragement
[3:36:20.240 --> 3:36:23.280]  just to let you know what is happening in Tampa Bay
[3:36:23.280 --> 3:36:26.960]  on the fourth of july holiday I was able to get about 240
[3:36:26.960 --> 3:36:30.720]  obama deception videos at events that day including the tea party
[3:36:30.720 --> 3:36:35.360]  on a major roadway cars at the intersection got the most dvds
[3:36:35.360 --> 3:36:42.160]  also a fireworks event was hit I like that term hit we are we're hitting
[3:36:42.160 --> 3:36:46.240]  the enemy operations we're unlocking mines you got this propaganda grid by the
[3:36:46.240 --> 3:36:51.040]  globalist and we're hitting it we're these are guerrilla attacks folks
[3:36:51.040 --> 3:36:56.000]  we are savaging them we're having great effects
[3:36:57.520 --> 3:37:01.840]  at the fireworks event at the city of Tampa police officers approached me
[3:37:01.840 --> 3:37:05.120]  I had on me turning response team uniform that's the shirt
[3:37:05.120 --> 3:37:08.240]  that we should punch up attorney response team t-shirt for folks so they
[3:37:08.240 --> 3:37:12.320]  can see it he saw what I was doing and he wanted a free
[3:37:12.320 --> 3:37:16.160]  dvd I thanked him for taking it and told him
[3:37:16.160 --> 3:37:19.040]  we were depending on him to uphold the constitution
[3:37:19.040 --> 3:37:25.680]  he said he would do his best this last Saturday on July 11th I passed out dvds
[3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:29.760]  at a business intersection at a red light passing them out to cars and
[3:37:29.760 --> 3:37:32.880]  pedestrians alike at one point a hills burrow county
[3:37:32.880 --> 3:37:36.480]  sheriffs pulled up and rolled his window down he asked is that an alex jones
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:39.840]  movie yes I have watched it several times
[3:37:39.840 --> 3:37:44.880]  he had the copy of the dvd on his car seat and showed me I said well
[3:37:44.880 --> 3:37:50.000]  a few minutes later he was able to pull off the road to talk he said that his
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:53.280]  brother had sent him the dvd and he had seen several other
[3:37:53.280 --> 3:37:57.120]  of alex's movies and was a regular listener of the radio show the internet
[3:37:57.120 --> 3:38:01.680]  I told him also that we were depending on him to uphold the constitution
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:06.000]  he we shook hands and in parting he said the answer to 1984
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:12.320]  is 1776 see that's why they're so afraid of liberty movement
[3:38:12.320 --> 3:38:17.440]  because these men and women have a hunger to be with George Washington
[3:38:17.440 --> 3:38:22.480]  to be with the founding fathers to be with
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:26.000]  colonel travis at the alamo to be real americans
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:29.520]  everybody does this is our heritage it's who we are
[3:38:29.520 --> 3:38:34.640]  it's in our guts and we they've taken the police and twisted their minds and
[3:38:34.640 --> 3:38:38.400]  they've taken the public and twisted our minds and they've set up this horrible
[3:38:38.400 --> 3:38:43.440]  system but the establishment knows
[3:38:43.440 --> 3:38:47.440]  that if the people have a choice between this chicken neck demon john p
[3:38:47.440 --> 3:38:51.600]  holdren let's put him on screen who says he wants to force druggist and cps our
[3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:54.720]  kids a choice between that and freedom and
[3:38:54.720 --> 3:38:58.160]  liberty and the second amendment god's guts and guns and
[3:38:58.160 --> 3:39:01.840]  fourth of july and freedom they're gonna want
[3:39:01.840 --> 3:39:07.760]  the freedom and so all of us have to really work on
[3:39:07.760 --> 3:39:09.920]  reaching out to the military and police and i know
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:15.120]  i fly off the handle and i tend to go after the police a lot and i've said
[3:39:15.120 --> 3:39:17.520]  this last year since i figured it out i'm growing
[3:39:17.520 --> 3:39:24.560]  i'm learning all the time i'm not perfect that that plays into the globalist plan
[3:39:24.560 --> 3:39:28.960]  that plays into it because they go give the police training
[3:39:28.960 --> 3:39:32.000]  and a culture that then makes the public not like them
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:36.080]  then they say see to the cops the public doesn't like you
[3:39:36.080 --> 3:39:39.360]  and then that further compacts the police into their area
[3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:43.600]  and then the citizens into their area it's another divide and conquer
[3:39:43.600 --> 3:39:46.640]  so when anderson cooper who's admittedly cia
[3:39:46.640 --> 3:39:51.440]  oh i was cia he said but then i went and joined cnn the heir to the aster fortune
[3:39:51.440 --> 3:39:55.520]  a disgusting globalist a piece of trash on record
[3:39:55.520 --> 3:40:00.160]  when he does all these constant tv shows about cops in texas robbing people
[3:40:00.160 --> 3:40:02.560]  and there are some bad
[3:40:02.560 --> 3:40:07.360]  the towns and counties that are doing this instead of having a newscast about
[3:40:07.360 --> 3:40:10.480]  how the state government and the state police were supposed to go
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:15.280]  after these people cnn kind of halfway legitimizes it but then says the feds
[3:40:15.280 --> 3:40:18.320]  need to federalize
[3:40:19.360 --> 3:40:22.880]  when you don't have texas towns running giant white slavery rings
[3:40:22.880 --> 3:40:27.040]  like dinecore and halliburton are see you got the big federal international
[3:40:27.040 --> 3:40:30.400]  evil it loves to show you the little local corruption
[3:40:30.400 --> 3:40:34.560]  as a pretext to come in and take over and they love to show the police beating
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:38.560]  people they love to show out of control thug cops choking teenagers for no
[3:40:38.560 --> 3:40:41.840]  reason and it's wrong
[3:40:41.920 --> 3:40:45.600]  it's wrong that they're doing that but the issue is why are they showing it so
[3:40:45.600 --> 3:40:50.560]  much because ladies and gentlemen they want us at
[3:40:50.560 --> 3:40:54.240]  each other's throats they want us to get into a fight with each other
[3:40:54.240 --> 3:40:58.640]  they want us to kill each other they are planning on instigating a revolution
[3:40:58.640 --> 3:41:02.000]  in this country that is going to slaughter the police and military
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:04.480]  and then after everything breaks down just like in argentine and other
[3:41:04.480 --> 3:41:06.400]  countries and i've had economists on from there
[3:41:06.400 --> 3:41:10.320]  same thing local cops and military gets shot up the citizens get shot up
[3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:12.880]  and then six months later everybody's tired of rioting
[3:41:12.880 --> 3:41:16.640]  and then the globalists come in this has been done
[3:41:16.640 --> 3:41:20.480]  over and over and over again so i've said i've made a lot of mistakes i never
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:24.640]  claimed to have all the answers understand all the psychological warfare
[3:41:24.640 --> 3:41:27.920]  i was talking to a friend of mine the other day and he said have you seen the
[3:41:27.920 --> 3:41:30.800]  cia declassified report and i said no i googled it
[3:41:30.800 --> 3:41:34.160]  another cia training manual release from 63
[3:41:34.160 --> 3:41:38.480]  how to torture people how to break them how to control local populations and i
[3:41:38.480 --> 3:41:42.000]  i sat there for two hours and read the whole document
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:45.120]  and it was everything i'm already seeing the feds do
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:50.400]  see i'm just learning so much so fast and i don't even have ways to describe it
[3:41:50.400 --> 3:41:54.560]  i just wish we could end this nightmare and arrest all these bankers
[3:41:54.560 --> 3:42:00.240]  and eugenicist trash i'm sick of them and i'm sick of how the whole
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:03.280]  thing's run by psychologists and psychiatrists
[3:42:03.280 --> 3:42:06.560]  who know how to manipulate us and they're playing games with us
[3:42:06.560 --> 3:42:10.000]  and manipulating our society and manipulating
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:14.160]  our social system and the way men operate and the way women operate
[3:42:14.160 --> 3:42:18.000]  they know how we operate they know how we work folks
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:21.600]  and they're manipulating it's just like we're in a petri dish and they got a
[3:42:21.600 --> 3:42:26.080]  a microscope studying us and you know looking at us and
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:30.240]  understanding how we operate that's what they're doing
[3:42:30.240 --> 3:42:34.080]  so we've got to learn sociology we've got to learn psychology we've got to read
[3:42:34.080 --> 3:42:37.040]  their manuals we've got to learn what these bastards have done
[3:42:37.040 --> 3:42:42.160]  because they have cold bloodedly come in with science
[3:42:42.160 --> 3:42:46.720]  and screwed our society up to make us dependent on them
[3:42:46.720 --> 3:42:49.360]  you know i didn't take a lot of calls today and i said i was and i covered
[3:42:49.360 --> 3:42:53.760]  some eugenics you know i'm doing the best i can here um
[3:42:53.760 --> 3:42:56.880]  and i keep everybody keeps saying oh the show's great you're doing a good job
[3:42:56.880 --> 3:43:01.120]  i know but still i just when you know about this level of evil you know
[3:43:01.120 --> 3:43:04.880]  about these criminals operating in plain view you know they're
[3:43:04.880 --> 3:43:08.480]  poisoning the water you know they're poisoning the food on record
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:12.800]  it's just you expect to see things instantly change
[3:43:12.800 --> 3:43:16.240]  but that's not how things work they didn't build their system overnight we're
[3:43:16.240 --> 3:43:19.760]  not going to dismantle their system and get the republic back overnight
[3:43:19.760 --> 3:43:24.240]  but number one having the attitude to win the attitude to take action having
[3:43:24.240 --> 3:43:28.160]  the facts getting involved you will get better at what
[3:43:28.160 --> 3:43:31.360]  you're doing by stepping up by taking action
[3:43:31.360 --> 3:43:35.040]  and so i can't expose all the eugenics i mean literally i have seven stacks in
[3:43:35.040 --> 3:43:39.280]  here this tall each one pure mainstream news pushing eugenics telling you how
[3:43:39.280 --> 3:43:43.760]  great it is to be sterilized i mean it's just off the charts
[3:43:43.760 --> 3:43:47.360]  and i've covered probably 30 or 40 of those today the point is go look at it
[3:43:47.360 --> 3:43:51.120]  for yourself it's a bottomless pit they're committing crimes and evil and
[3:43:51.120 --> 3:43:57.680]  micromanaging control freak garbage so fast i can't even
[3:43:57.680 --> 3:44:01.040]  track it it's just it's just a criminal society
[3:44:01.040 --> 3:44:05.360]  has taken over they use scientific techniques
[3:44:05.360 --> 3:44:09.040]  and we're all in the same boat they are screwing
[3:44:09.040 --> 3:44:12.400]  all of us i don't care who you are or what you are
[3:44:12.400 --> 3:44:17.040]  or what color you are or where you live but i know this i'm getting letters from
[3:44:17.040 --> 3:44:20.240]  brazil and letters from south korea and letters from
[3:44:20.240 --> 3:44:23.200]  japan and letters from russia and calls from russia
[3:44:23.200 --> 3:44:27.120]  and i talk to contractors and i talk to workers and i talk to family
[3:44:27.120 --> 3:44:31.120]  who are on cruise ships in other parts of the world and who were at factories
[3:44:31.120 --> 3:44:34.880]  in other parts of the world and who and have people walk up to them and say have
[3:44:34.880 --> 3:44:38.160]  you heard info wars dot com if you heard alex jones folks
[3:44:38.160 --> 3:44:42.320]  the responsibility of the fact that i'm trying to play down the people we
[3:44:42.320 --> 3:44:45.760]  reach but i know the establishment knows i'm reaching tens of millions now
[3:44:45.760 --> 3:44:50.080]  every month new i mean we've hit mega viral level
[3:44:50.080 --> 3:44:53.600]  my radio show and the films are just a tiny little node
[3:44:53.600 --> 3:44:57.360]  it's like a virus but a good virus that just you introduce a few viruses and
[3:44:57.360 --> 3:45:00.720]  then it turns into billions
[3:45:00.720 --> 3:45:04.720]  i'm under total surveillance i've got all sorts of black ops being pulled on me
[3:45:04.720 --> 3:45:08.560]  i just ignore it and trust in god you know to go through the storm i'm i'm
[3:45:08.560 --> 3:45:11.120]  happy i've done this you're only alive once
[3:45:11.120 --> 3:45:14.800]  but the issue is we're making history right now
[3:45:14.800 --> 3:45:19.200]  and the establishment is launching all sorts of coantel pro whisper campaigns
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:22.800]  black ops attacks they're pulling out all the stops on me
[3:45:22.800 --> 3:45:27.440]  trying to set me up and i just want folks to know whatever happens to me it's a
[3:45:27.440 --> 3:45:31.200]  victory the testament to what i've been able to
[3:45:31.200 --> 3:45:35.280]  do with your help taking action the testament
[3:45:35.280 --> 3:45:41.680]  these type of stories that that that this writer john and tampa bay tells me
[3:45:41.680 --> 3:45:48.240]  where all the cops he sees are awake i mean it you know it's just i was
[3:45:48.240 --> 3:45:52.240]  talking to a a friend last night who was in
[3:45:52.240 --> 3:45:56.160]  oregon visiting family i believe she told me the
[3:45:56.160 --> 3:45:59.680]  story but she was visiting some friends in florida i mean and i was thinking of
[3:45:59.680 --> 3:46:01.840]  florida and um let me go back to the exact story
[3:46:01.840 --> 3:46:05.280]  hold on kind of download that here mentally
[3:46:05.280 --> 3:46:09.040]  and it's also the the friends
[3:46:09.600 --> 3:46:12.000]  somebody don't want to be mentioned on air so i'll be careful not to mention that
[3:46:12.000 --> 3:46:14.960]  i was talking to a friend last night we were having dinner
[3:46:14.960 --> 3:46:18.000]  my wife and i had some friends and and this friend was talking about how she
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:25.680]  was in um no it was her mother our friend's mother
[3:46:25.680 --> 3:46:31.760]  was traveling visiting family in oregon and she went to the buffalo bill show
[3:46:31.760 --> 3:46:35.760]  uh because i guess they there's a company does that around the country
[3:46:35.760 --> 3:46:39.600]  and they read the buffalo bill show and they were just talking to some young
[3:46:39.600 --> 3:46:43.120]  man who was part of the buffalo bill show and he said oh have you heard info
[3:46:43.120 --> 3:46:46.320]  wars dot com and alex jones and then the uh
[3:46:46.320 --> 3:46:49.760]  mother of one of my friends was like absolutely and then suddenly there were
[3:46:49.760 --> 3:46:52.880]  more people there and they were talking about hey everybody's awake here
[3:46:52.880 --> 3:46:56.960]  we know what's going on my only point in telling that story is
[3:46:56.960 --> 3:47:01.360]  that that everywhere i go and everybody i talked to
[3:47:01.360 --> 3:47:07.280]  they're having the same experiences and i get calls and i get letters from new
[3:47:07.280 --> 3:47:12.400]  york and wisconsin and in south texas and
[3:47:12.400 --> 3:47:19.040]  colorada and uh new zealand i had police departments call and say
[3:47:19.040 --> 3:47:23.120]  did you do this did you spray paint info wars dot com on this big
[3:47:23.120 --> 3:47:26.720]  derelict city building and they'll send us a photo
[3:47:26.720 --> 3:47:30.800]  in new zealand of info wars dot com spray painted all across it and i'm like
[3:47:30.800 --> 3:47:35.600]  no uh or i'll get a mean letter going how dare you
[3:47:35.600 --> 3:47:41.040]  in these falls over the in hawaii carve info wars into the rock
[3:47:41.040 --> 3:47:44.000]  where people spray painting road signs in colorado
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:48.480]  you know thinking i'm doing it the point is folks it's everywhere and then i
[3:47:48.480 --> 3:47:51.760]  realize we have tens of millions of people
[3:47:51.760 --> 3:47:57.760]  listening to us we've actually got the attention of the people
[3:47:57.760 --> 3:48:01.120]  what am i supposed to do i mean i i mean this it's it's it's
[3:48:01.120 --> 3:48:04.640]  it's not even so much as a weight is that it's just
[3:48:04.640 --> 3:48:09.280]  almost embarrassing i mean i'm not the guy for this job i'm not the guy
[3:48:09.280 --> 3:48:12.320]  to be the leader of the resistance against the new world order but at the
[3:48:12.320 --> 3:48:17.840]  same time who else is there it's you they can kill me individually they can
[3:48:17.840 --> 3:48:20.720]  destroy my name i've been analyzing their attack
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:24.480]  profile they're more likely to invent scandals against me but i'm so clean
[3:48:24.480 --> 3:48:28.880]  i'm so square it's hard to do but whatever they do to me
[3:48:28.880 --> 3:48:34.320]  don't see the movement as about alex jones see it as about liberty and freedom
[3:48:34.320 --> 3:48:38.400]  and realize you're a leader and that they can't kill ideas
[3:48:38.400 --> 3:48:43.120]  and that you by going out handing out dvds handing out films handing out
[3:48:43.120 --> 3:48:46.560]  articles handing out websites starting your own local radio shows starting
[3:48:46.560 --> 3:48:50.240]  access tv starting your own local activist group
[3:48:50.240 --> 3:48:53.680]  by going out and going to city council and taking action
[3:48:53.680 --> 3:48:58.080]  if you will take action people will join you if you will build it they will come
[3:48:58.080 --> 3:49:01.760]  if you will engage the enemy we could defeat them because the enemy's coming
[3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:05.280]  in like a flood now there's no more denials open world government's been
[3:49:05.280 --> 3:49:08.640]  announced and i always knew that this key
[3:49:08.640 --> 3:49:12.000]  juncture that if i got out there and warned as many people as i could about
[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:15.920]  the globalist plan and didn't hold back a lot of other folks knew as much as i
[3:49:15.920 --> 3:49:19.680]  did they just didn't want to sound kooky so they only put a little bit out i went
[3:49:19.680 --> 3:49:24.320]  all the way to the wall with the most radical info i could that was factual
[3:49:24.320 --> 3:49:28.160]  snowing that people wouldn't believe me then
[3:49:28.160 --> 3:49:32.560]  but that as it all came true then they would remember
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:37.120]  and that it and that it's that power of revelation it's that power of the foresight
[3:49:37.120 --> 3:49:40.560]  that people pay attention to and that by doing that
[3:49:40.560 --> 3:49:44.800]  they would then wake up and get involved and join us and we've done that we
[3:49:44.800 --> 3:49:48.560]  planted tens of millions of seeds all across the world and now
[3:49:48.560 --> 3:49:51.920]  those have grown mentally and spiritually and they are
[3:49:51.920 --> 3:49:55.760]  planting seeds and so the great harvest is coming
[3:49:55.760 --> 3:49:59.120]  so the enemy's going to stage nuclear attacks they're going to stage flu
[3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:01.280]  attacks they're going to stage world war three type
