[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:44.360]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much
[00:44.360 --> 00:51.840]  for joining us very important broadcast today it is Wednesday June 10th 2009
[00:51.840 --> 00:59.920]  Congressman Ron Paul joining us to talk about HR 1207 to audit the private
[00:59.920 --> 01:07.000]  criminal Federal Reserve some of the new sites affiliated with Dr. Ron Paul are
[01:07.000 --> 01:14.200]  reporting 207 co-sponsors to the bill I've always found the daily poll to be
[01:14.200 --> 01:21.320]  quite journalistic and accurate but Thomas.loc.gov and GovTrack both say
[01:21.320 --> 01:26.560]  200 so we'll find out exactly from the Congressman today what it's up to but
[01:26.560 --> 01:32.360]  200 is amazing 207 is amazing Steve Watson has the latest on this up on
[01:32.360 --> 01:42.000]  prisonplanet.com posted as we speak and a lot of people are saying how dare on
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.840]  Paul only have a bill to audit the Fed abolish it he does have a separate bill
[01:47.840 --> 01:52.840]  with what over 70 sponsors last time I looked it up to abolish the Federal
[01:52.840 --> 01:56.640]  Reserve I mean that's like signing the Declaration of Independence that's like
[01:56.640 --> 02:03.200]  signing your John Hancock that's a very dangerous thing to do with the New
[02:03.200 --> 02:07.560]  World Order these bankers destroy entire countries militarily they stage
[02:07.560 --> 02:11.880]  terror attacks and overthrow countries they engage in every form of black op and
[02:11.880 --> 02:16.680]  subterfuge to control the planet on record the IMF and World Bank and others
[02:16.680 --> 02:26.720]  brag that they are doing this so Ron Paul is a lot of courage and he concurs with
[02:26.720 --> 02:30.040]  me on air last time he was on a month ago saying that he does believe it's a
[02:30.040 --> 02:37.320]  dangerous thing that he's doing but you know a lot of people will always look
[02:37.320 --> 02:47.400]  at gift horse in the mouth it's amazing so many people complain while they sit
[02:47.400 --> 02:51.960]  in the stands they sit in the nosebleed section watching Ron Paul myself and
[02:51.960 --> 02:57.080]  many others in the arena fighting for the life of this republic and our own
[02:57.080 --> 03:00.560]  personal liberties and everybody else's freedoms but I want to commend all of
[03:00.560 --> 03:04.240]  those that steadfastly continue to beat the drums of liberty and continue to
[03:04.240 --> 03:09.520]  shout the warnings from the hills and mountains from the church tops in the
[03:09.520 --> 03:16.160]  valleys from the hollers to the seaside from the forest to the dales you are
[03:16.160 --> 03:22.200]  out there doing a great job and we commend you and salute you but if they
[03:22.200 --> 03:27.600]  get another 20 or so sponsors ladies and gentlemen they have a good chance of
[03:27.600 --> 03:33.400]  passing it and then imagine having a vote in the house and finding out who
[03:33.400 --> 03:40.400]  votes so the Fed cannot be audited that will let us know who is fully controlled
[03:40.400 --> 03:43.480]  by the bankers now the Federal Reserve is in panic mode they've always been so
[03:43.480 --> 03:47.880]  arrogant they haven't had lobbyist because they've owned the nation by their
[03:47.880 --> 03:56.600]  subterfuge and hijacking in 1913 but now they've hired a bunch of high-powered
[03:56.600 --> 04:02.840]  lobbyist we wrote stories about that at info wars calm last week her memo did to
[04:02.840 --> 04:10.160]  go in and try to twist arms and threaten people but even if this doesn't pass this
[04:10.160 --> 04:14.680]  Congress which it has a great chance of doing the idea is introduced we've gone
[04:14.680 --> 04:19.400]  from just a very few small minority of people knowing about the private
[04:19.400 --> 04:22.160]  Federal Reserve and how it's never been audited and that the golds missing from
[04:22.160 --> 04:27.080]  Fort Knox and that we've been hijacked by offshore banks to now a large portion
[04:27.080 --> 04:31.640]  of Americans moving towards majority no this is the shadow government this is
[04:31.640 --> 04:37.480]  the enemy of free society now that's coming up later with big economic news
[04:37.480 --> 04:45.200]  ladies and gentlemen massive gun control gun registration of our veterans is

[07:06.960 --> 07:10.760]  devastated but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do
[07:10.760 --> 07:14.240]  a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you
[07:14.240 --> 07:18.200]  every day there is no job security you are always in danger of losing your
[07:18.200 --> 07:22.320]  job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business

[08:00.800 --> 08:18.240]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:18.240 --> 08:22.680]  we broke the fact that they were in a stage 9-11 terror attacks here months and
[08:22.680 --> 08:26.200]  months before it happened and specifically named the target and boldly
[08:26.200 --> 08:29.000]  said call the White House tell them don't stage the attacks and blame it on
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.440]  your asset there's someone been lauding we blew bohemian grove politically
[08:33.440 --> 08:37.800]  wide open and exposed that satanic ceremonies are going on with world
[08:37.800 --> 08:41.840]  leaders once a year in northern California and right outside the town of
[08:41.840 --> 08:50.200]  Monterey we have broken the Mayak report we broke at many other federal
[08:50.200 --> 08:57.080]  training manuals and reports we broke the DHS report and always in the first few
[08:57.080 --> 09:05.040]  days I get to have the alternative media post articles saying I'm a liar out of
[09:05.040 --> 09:12.600]  hand and I guess this is done because of pure jealousy I don't know what you're
[09:12.600 --> 09:18.080]  jealous of it's the best of times the worst of times it's exhilarating and
[09:18.080 --> 09:22.360]  empowering to know we're waking millions of people up and communing with
[09:22.360 --> 09:26.200]  wonderful like-minded people who love liberty and truth and justice but it's
[09:26.200 --> 09:31.360]  also very scary to deal with the black ops the dirty tricks the new order
[09:31.360 --> 09:37.480]  actions against us and you know at a certain level I selfishly just wish
[09:37.480 --> 09:42.520]  that I worked a regular job and work nine to five and had more time to enjoy
[09:42.520 --> 09:46.600]  myself and and carry out some of the private passions I have like art and
[09:46.600 --> 09:52.480]  hunting and fishing and things like that but those passions take an extreme
[09:52.480 --> 10:00.760]  back seat to fighting the New World Order it is a consuming passion for the
[10:00.760 --> 10:04.920]  truth for justice for honor and for defending ourselves against the New
[10:04.920 --> 10:09.960]  World Order because this is a life-and-death situation so every time we
[10:09.960 --> 10:16.080]  break one of these major stories hundreds of them hundreds the first
[10:16.080 --> 10:19.520]  reports that get written about our reports are that it's not true and then
[10:19.520 --> 10:24.120]  later it comes out in mainstream media that it is indeed true with their spin
[10:24.120 --> 10:32.080]  on it now a lot of that is done through just plain old jealousy but they'll turn
[10:32.080 --> 10:37.280]  into media some people out there but a lot of it we know is Cohen tell pro if
[10:37.280 --> 10:43.960]  they can blunt these huge stories we break and kind of blunt them bash its
[10:43.960 --> 10:51.880]  crown kind of bend the tip of the spear on a new story it then doesn't get the
[10:51.880 --> 10:55.720]  mega legs it would get because there's those first days of doubting doubting
[10:55.720 --> 10:59.520]  doubting that denying and then the mainstream media gets to come out and
[10:59.520 --> 11:03.960]  put their spin on it and then have it be admitted and that way it breaks only on
[11:03.960 --> 11:10.320]  national news then they get to take the story in the direction they want instead
[11:10.320 --> 11:14.880]  of our story with the truth and the correct breakdown of what it really
[11:14.880 --> 11:20.680]  means in context with the wider spectrum analysis it would be a thousand
[11:20.680 --> 11:27.000]  times more effective if the DHS story broke and it broke big with our
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.840]  analysis of it with links to videos of troops us troops training to confiscate
[11:32.840 --> 11:39.080]  our guns and links to old manuals listening how the founding fathers are
[11:39.080 --> 11:44.880]  bad you see instead of the Washington Post of the New York Times going yeah
[11:44.880 --> 11:49.800]  DHS says Ron Paul supporters and gun owners and veterans of the number one
[11:49.800 --> 11:59.160]  terror threat and it's reasonable because they are a terror threat or when we
[11:59.160 --> 12:03.000]  put the report out we point out they demonize the left and right but instead
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.160]  when Fox News takes the stories we break and then they break them and get the
[12:07.160 --> 12:11.120]  credit for breaking them they always make it left right they don't tell you the
[12:11.120 --> 12:15.520]  documents talk about the left as well which would then unify the American
[12:15.520 --> 12:19.840]  people understanding that homeland security has been set up to carry out
[12:19.840 --> 12:23.800]  predatory actions against the American people the looting the criminal
[12:23.800 --> 12:30.200]  consolidation instead of it being a left right issue it would be a liberty
[12:30.200 --> 12:33.320]  versus tyranny issue and then people would realize that it's all of us
[12:33.320 --> 12:36.920]  together but instead the left reads oh it's dangerous right-wingers yeah I
[12:36.920 --> 12:41.600]  support secret police and spying on the right-wingers not knowing they're
[12:41.600 --> 12:46.200]  supporting their own destruction as well just like when Bush would put out
[12:46.200 --> 12:50.800]  documents it would be oh look Bush wants to get the left wing and the
[12:50.800 --> 12:55.160]  documents also said the right wing and everything in between but the media
[12:55.160 --> 13:01.000]  would spin it say you know associated press Alabama federal report written
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.680]  for state police you know states that liberals and environmental activist or
[13:05.680 --> 13:10.440]  terrorist and then that would get big attention under Bush notice the media
[13:10.440 --> 13:14.040]  would never talk about how Bush was going after conservatives because they
[13:14.040 --> 13:18.640]  wanted to resubmit that left-right paradigm if a story is released and put
[13:18.640 --> 13:22.560]  out that way with that span it aids the New World Order do you understand how
[13:22.560 --> 13:29.440]  this works it's really I've more and more become to understand it's a form of
[13:29.440 --> 13:38.400]  political mathematics I need to develop equations or graphic demonstrations of
[13:38.400 --> 13:51.320]  this to explain it but you can almost see it like a a a a a seesaw on a on a ball
[13:51.320 --> 13:57.120]  and the seesaw has the left and right on each side and they're always needing
[13:57.120 --> 14:00.680]  to balance out the crimes on the left and the crimes on the right by the
[14:00.680 --> 14:04.800]  government to then play those two sides off against each other instead of ever
[14:04.800 --> 14:10.160]  realizing the entire paradigm is controlled and I hope you understand
[14:10.160 --> 14:14.960]  what I'm saying I know most of you do I know it's Greek to some the issue here
[14:14.960 --> 14:21.240]  is we put out stories as the government documents show and the government
[14:21.240 --> 14:25.480]  documents always show a concerted effort against all three peoples on a
[14:25.480 --> 14:29.360]  planetary scale the United States hijacked by offshore banks being used
[14:29.360 --> 14:34.640]  as an engine a mechanism and our motto of tyranny against the planet and no one
[14:34.640 --> 14:40.680]  is to be as enslaved as those in the heart of the Hessian military district
[14:40.680 --> 14:49.240]  known as the United States and we are to pay for it we are to bleed for it we
[14:49.240 --> 14:57.040]  are to animate this army of darkness politically the propaganda the
[14:57.040 --> 15:01.320]  military the financial tyranny it is an army of darkness nor the way to
[15:01.320 --> 15:07.800]  describe it a hell spawn a hell force a legion of death a legion of lies a
[15:07.800 --> 15:12.440]  legion of delusion and all the predatory actions the globalist carry out
[15:12.440 --> 15:16.160]  against third world and old world and first world nations are all carried out
[15:16.160 --> 15:20.840]  and beta tested here and in the true heart of the system air strip one
[15:20.840 --> 15:30.880]  Oceania's Britannia now that said I need everybody to start their engines and
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.760]  everybody to chocks away to pull the chocks off the landing gear of these
[15:35.760 --> 15:40.880]  aircraft I need you in the air engaging the new world order right now I need
[15:40.880 --> 15:47.240]  your help with this story and we need to not let the media make it a left wing
[15:47.240 --> 15:52.160]  or right wing issue need to explain this has been going on for a long time
[15:52.160 --> 15:56.000]  it's now just out in the open but there's not just that to deal with that's
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.360]  the second hurdle I've got to deal with it's not enough we break these stories
[15:59.360 --> 16:05.760]  we then have hurdles which is fine that's to be expected first hurdle is
[16:05.760 --> 16:16.440]  this is a real story 99% of our stories turn out to be true there's been a few
[16:16.440 --> 16:22.800]  where we got steered wrong that's a lot better track record the mainstream media
[16:22.800 --> 16:27.520]  who tries to lie we try to tell the truth try to be accurate but I confirmed
[16:27.520 --> 16:33.560]  this report I remember when we got the DHS report Kurt had it for a few days
[16:33.560 --> 16:40.600]  was trying to vet it and I just said why not call Homeland Security and the FBI
[16:40.600 --> 16:44.200]  phone numbers on it and I called they said yeah that's our report how did you
[16:44.200 --> 16:48.120]  get that what officer gave it to you what agent gave it to you and I said no
[16:48.120 --> 16:52.120]  this was sent to me anonymously thank you for answering my questions and I went
[16:52.120 --> 16:55.680]  down the line calling the watch commanders calling the FBI calling the
[16:55.680 --> 17:02.880]  phone numbers for law enforcement on it and I called Kurt on that Sunday night
[17:02.880 --> 17:07.240]  and I said put it out just like with the Mayak report we called the state police
[17:07.240 --> 17:12.280]  and they flipped out when I called up and then we go on air and say here's the
[17:12.280 --> 17:15.720]  phone number here's the document you can call them and people said it was a lie
[17:15.720 --> 17:22.960]  and they do that on every single subject and that's co-and-tell pro folks with
[17:22.960 --> 17:28.680]  their useful idiot servants who are just jealous jealous of our valor jealous of
[17:28.680 --> 17:32.640]  our commitment jealous of our work jealous of the fact that we're going
[17:32.640 --> 17:36.280]  right into the center of the tempest and taking a lot of slings and arrows
[17:36.280 --> 17:42.000]  ladies and gentlemen and trusting completely in the hands of the creator
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.160]  committed but I wanted to build up to this next article that's up on info
[17:48.160 --> 17:55.920]  wars.com and prisonplanet.com because I have called randomly a veterans of
[17:55.920 --> 18:04.680]  foreign wars and I called a friend of mine who's in veterans of foreign wars
[18:04.680 --> 18:10.360]  south of Austin I'll just leave it at that and he made calls last night and
[18:10.360 --> 18:15.360]  called me this morning it is confirmed double confirmed yes we have this with
[18:15.360 --> 18:20.240]  phone numbers yes I've called the VFW and they said no comment and passed me

[24:23.400 --> 24:28.560]  yesterday I just turned some of them down I mean I can't keep track of all this
[24:28.560 --> 24:35.120]  anymore and Ron Paul he does probably 10 radio interviews a day a TV interviewer
[24:35.120 --> 24:39.280]  to every day he takes time out to meet with students he takes time out to write
[24:39.280 --> 24:42.960]  books he takes time out to write legislation and then they're so
[24:42.960 --> 24:46.280]  professional his office just called and said it looks like he's gonna have floor
[24:46.280 --> 24:51.680]  time at 12 30 when he's supposed to be on with you for a half hour we may have
[24:51.680 --> 24:55.800]  to come on later or earlier can you stand by to have him yes we will clear
[24:55.800 --> 24:59.720]  the decks for Congressman Ron Paul but there he is to go have floor time to
[24:59.720 --> 25:03.880]  try to basically abolish the Federal Reserve and they're so classy they're
[25:03.880 --> 25:09.360]  calling us up to tell us that I mean that and by classy I wish I had that type
[25:09.360 --> 25:14.840]  of organizational skill or the energy I'm 35 and it exhausts me when I go to bed
[25:14.840 --> 25:21.560]  at two at night I hit that pillow and sink in and I was working 18 hours a day
[25:21.560 --> 25:25.280]  for years and had to cut back to about 12 because it just I was burning out how
[25:25.280 --> 25:32.000]  does Ron Paul work on average 15 to 16 hours a day and then people complain he's
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.120]  not working enough unbelievable anyways that's Ron Paul coming up Walter
[25:37.120 --> 25:44.680]  Williams and others today so since he's in Congress right now just
[25:44.680 --> 25:48.040]  heads up note no telling when Ron Paul is gonna be on the day and every once in
[25:48.040 --> 25:51.400]  a while he has to reschedule to tomorrow but that they're saying he'll be on the
[25:51.400 --> 25:55.840]  day he's got our hotline and he'll be calling him okay
[25:55.840 --> 26:01.440]  Jaren just walked up and showed me this article this is out of the Wall Street
[26:01.440 --> 26:06.400]  Journal former AT&T chief to become GM chairman and how do you decipher that
[26:06.400 --> 26:13.720]  GM's hijacked taken over given to the Russians the Chinese the Europeans and
[26:13.720 --> 26:19.040]  the Brazilians openly the good parts of it Saturn Hummer you name it profitable
[26:19.040 --> 26:23.280]  divisions Chrysler is given to a Bilderberg group Congress tries to block
[26:23.280 --> 26:28.240]  it they just run over give Chrysler with money on top very valuable just give it
[26:28.240 --> 26:33.080]  away to Fiat Bilderberg owned the head of the owner of a fiat is the top
[26:33.080 --> 26:37.480]  Bilderberg remember we shot video of Manistam bull it's in
[26:37.480 --> 26:44.360]  it's in the powerful film in game blueprint for global enslavement but so
[26:44.360 --> 26:49.440]  AT&T admits the Congress has said no warrants your email faxes phone calls
[26:49.440 --> 26:53.520]  anything they want no warrants everything is captured everything goes
[26:53.520 --> 26:57.320]  through everything is listened to we got that was in law 96 for the
[26:57.320 --> 27:01.520]  infrastructure not the law they can do the spying but the infrastructure by law
[27:01.520 --> 27:06.600]  they had to be able to and have it set up see that's how intelligence works and
[27:06.600 --> 27:10.160]  anybody can engage in intelligence gathering you can have your operation
[27:10.160 --> 27:15.120]  secret military economic whatever is but the manifestation of the operation in
[27:15.120 --> 27:20.360]  preparation and launch is obvious the difference is recognize it for what it
[27:20.360 --> 27:25.840]  is take that flu scare they did that was a open drill for when they do the real
[27:25.840 --> 27:29.280]  thing and I predicted that when it happened and then they came out weeks
[27:29.280 --> 27:32.400]  later and said yeah we use this as a drill and we think the next big one's
[27:32.400 --> 27:37.920]  coming in the fall now whether that happens or not remains to be seen but
[27:37.920 --> 27:41.840]  I'm self-taught at all this and you can self-teach yourself then understand
[27:41.840 --> 27:46.000]  the world really works it's very exciting it's very dynamic it's very
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.720]  engrossing see when I read the newspaper or jaren reads the newspaper or
[27:50.720 --> 27:56.720]  anybody who's focused on this you focus on something you learn it you know how
[27:56.720 --> 27:59.040]  do you learn how to play basketball you do it how do you learn how to play golf
[27:59.040 --> 28:02.160]  you do it how do you learn how to swim you do it how do you learn how to garden

[28:25.200 --> 28:33.280]  maneuvers go straight at them as one british admiral said in a battle at the
[28:33.280 --> 28:35.440]  Nile
[28:37.440 --> 28:45.960]  damn the maneuvers go straight at them and it's hesitation many times you gotta
[28:45.960 --> 28:50.120]  have basic wisdom you gotta know how things work you know it's a combination
[28:50.120 --> 28:54.960]  of things but at the same time you've also got to be able to act that mean your
[28:54.960 --> 28:57.040]  decisions are going to be perfect i mean you're going to do perfect when you
[28:57.040 --> 29:01.040]  start a radio show or a website or make a film but the point is that you take
[29:01.040 --> 29:04.720]  action that you get in motion that you don't lay down you could throw in an
[29:04.720 --> 29:09.520]  arena with a gladiator you better fight for your life you may not have much of a
[29:09.520 --> 29:15.120]  chance to be fired back but you have no chance if you cower on your belly and if

[34:24.800 --> 34:28.960]  that's a couple minutes into a nine minute clip i mean it's in my film um
[34:28.960 --> 34:33.200]  the obama deception but i'm i'm gonna play that later
[34:33.200 --> 34:36.640]  you're saying no one no one no police no agency no government
[34:36.640 --> 34:40.880]  we are god and bernack he said that to congress too
[34:40.880 --> 34:45.120]  i have him talking to senator uh sanders
[34:46.800 --> 34:51.360]  and he says um i won't tell you where the money went now sit down congressman
[34:51.360 --> 34:56.560]  sit down senator and shut up we own this country now but that bravada
[34:56.560 --> 35:00.240]  that it you know it's like a bully when he sits there and tells you he's going
[35:00.240 --> 35:02.960]  to kick your butt when he sits there and tells you he's going to dominate you
[35:02.960 --> 35:05.840]  and then you just go ahead and start fighting back
[35:05.840 --> 35:09.120]  and even if he ends up beating you if you fight hard enough you're going to
[35:09.120 --> 35:14.560]  hurt him too he's going to move on to an easier target next time
[35:14.560 --> 35:17.600]  but i guess everybody's got to be beat up a few times to learn that and
[35:17.600 --> 35:20.480]  don't worry the government if it hadn't beat you up real bad yet it's going to
[35:20.480 --> 35:23.840]  or one of the corporations that has got its favor and is allowed to do it

[35:41.040 --> 35:45.200]  the media will no doubt try to spend this this is going to end up
[35:45.200 --> 35:51.200]  we broke this last night this was sent to our office tim frugia doing a great
[35:51.200 --> 35:54.400]  job back during customer service customer service manager
[35:54.400 --> 35:56.960]  he saw it in the email ticket lord knows what we're missing i don't have the
[35:56.960 --> 35:59.120]  personnel to read all the tens of thousands emails that come in every
[35:59.120 --> 36:02.720]  couple days but he caught this
[36:02.720 --> 36:06.640]  we made some phone calls last night confirmed its accuracy
[36:06.640 --> 36:15.760]  here in texas and in tennessee this is going on nationwide though all vfw
[36:15.760 --> 36:22.000]  outfits have not gotten this yet they read you the article now ladies and
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.480]  gentlemen
[36:26.560 --> 36:32.560]  government demands inventory of all vfw weapons
[36:32.560 --> 36:41.440]  even 150 year old cannons and muskets swords because these decommissioned
[36:41.440 --> 36:45.040]  items before were given to the vfw kind of as a backup
[36:45.040 --> 36:48.720]  militia the remnants of the militia the posse
[36:48.720 --> 36:54.960]  civil defense they are now wanting to know every civil war cannon every old
[36:54.960 --> 36:58.960]  army tank that's been decommissioned and welded shut bolted out front
[36:58.960 --> 37:02.640]  or every airplane every helicopter every missile
[37:02.640 --> 37:09.440]  out front but mainly they want the world war two rifles
[37:09.440 --> 37:14.560]  the korean war rifles and i had already been told about this by
[37:14.560 --> 37:18.560]  people that i have inside camp mayberry where they administer a lot of this
[37:18.560 --> 37:23.040]  stuff here in texas that they are planning to confiscate those guns
[37:23.040 --> 37:26.800]  and they've already told vfw marchers all over the nation you can just google
[37:26.800 --> 37:30.560]  this and pull it up vfw not allowed to carry rifles in
[37:30.560 --> 37:33.760]  parade or the police have arrested some of them
[37:33.760 --> 37:38.560]  doesn't matter they're even spiked barrels barrels that have you know had
[37:38.560 --> 37:42.960]  hot lead bored down on them that are sealed it doesn't matter
[37:42.960 --> 37:46.240]  you can't let slaves see old vets with rifles
[37:46.240 --> 37:50.080]  you can't have old army tanks out front the because they're getting ready for
[37:50.080 --> 37:52.400]  gun confiscation they're getting ready for gun control
[37:52.400 --> 37:57.280]  more and more in america and they're also worried about the vets now remember
[37:57.280 --> 38:01.600]  that in um fort campel kentucky and then it popped up at
[38:01.600 --> 38:05.920]  fort blitz texas and then the media said oh those were just isolated generals
[38:05.920 --> 38:09.520]  and kernels on the basis they just thought this up on their own
[38:09.520 --> 38:13.760]  yeah sure they did in california texas and kentucky and then now other states
[38:13.760 --> 38:16.960]  and again we broke this
[38:17.680 --> 38:21.200]  years ago then world and daily picked up on it we broke it again when it broke
[38:21.200 --> 38:25.360]  about kentucky and people were in denial at first about it
[38:25.360 --> 38:30.720]  and then they said oh well it's just a lone commander
[38:30.720 --> 38:36.240]  it's just a lone commander yeah lone commanders all over the
[38:36.240 --> 38:39.840]  countries at army bases and they're telling them you
[38:39.840 --> 38:42.960]  we don't care if you live off base we don't care if you're a commander we don't
[38:42.960 --> 38:45.200]  care if you're an officer non-commissioned officer we don't care if
[38:45.200 --> 38:50.000]  you're a private we don't care what you are you will fill out all the firearms
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.800]  you've got in your life and any new firearms you buy
[38:52.800 --> 38:58.880]  and register them with us even if they're off base and you own them
[38:58.880 --> 39:02.640]  and then people made excuses about that
[39:02.640 --> 39:07.840]  well now they're going to the vfw
[39:07.840 --> 39:10.320]  and you can read in the comment section there are people confirming from their
[39:10.320 --> 39:13.840]  vfw as this is happening but i have not just have the document the phone
[39:13.840 --> 39:17.280]  numbers and called i have called someone i know in the vfw and they
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.920]  confirmed that this indeed did happen
[39:22.080 --> 39:25.600]  and then i talked to somebody separately in texas
[39:25.600 --> 39:30.640]  randomly calling and confirmed it you can read the documents up on info wars
[39:30.640 --> 39:35.200]  dot com and prison planet dot com right now government demands inventory of all
[39:35.200 --> 39:39.440]  vfw weapons but see the media will then pick
[39:39.440 --> 39:42.880]  up on this in the next few days they'll only report on this by itself
[39:42.880 --> 39:47.440]  our article gives you a bigger picture of the background and what else is going
[39:47.440 --> 39:51.280]  on for a fuller spectrum analysis not a full spectrum
[39:51.280 --> 39:56.080]  nothing's omnipresent but i guess god almighty an info wars reader has passed
[39:56.080 --> 40:00.240]  along an email sent to vfw commanders by the assistant adjunct of the
[40:00.240 --> 40:04.240]  department of texas veterans of foreign wars indicating that the u.s army
[40:04.240 --> 40:10.400]  tacom tactical army command is demanding an inventory of all weapons held by vfw
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.520]  post because again north com's number one threat
[40:15.520 --> 40:20.720]  and number one enemy is former military now i told you this again two years
[40:20.720 --> 40:23.920]  ago we have police officers on this show and wrote articles we ought to dig those
[40:23.920 --> 40:27.360]  out where police departments nationwide under homeland
[40:27.360 --> 40:31.840]  security grants were taught to fight veterans coming home and attacking
[40:31.840 --> 40:35.840]  or veterans not giving up their land
[40:35.920 --> 40:39.920]  and they were told all cities will be attacked by veterans
[40:39.920 --> 40:45.920]  with improvised explosive devices i don't care if you're the austin swat team
[40:45.920 --> 40:51.920]  or the la swat team or the albuquerque new mexico swat team or the
[40:51.920 --> 40:54.800]  providence rhod island swat team listening you know you were given this
[40:54.800 --> 40:59.920]  training but most of you listening saw it in your local news
[41:02.640 --> 41:06.240]  now remember the new york times in fact i see full spectrum curtain to add all
[41:06.240 --> 41:09.440]  this great article you wrote but we need to add to this article all the other
[41:09.440 --> 41:12.160]  background that really makes it clear
[41:12.160 --> 41:16.880]  where they're training the boy scouts of america and all these other youth groups
[41:16.880 --> 41:20.640]  in government federally issued homeland security uniforms
[41:20.640 --> 41:25.360]  with federal grants for gun confiscation and to track down veterans
[41:25.360 --> 41:30.560]  and kill them then we have the ap in michigan where they
[41:30.560 --> 41:33.760]  come into public schools and elementary dressed up in camos saying we're going
[41:33.760 --> 41:37.040]  to kill you the police do under federal grants saying we're home schoolers
[41:37.040 --> 41:41.440]  against public education we're going to kill you engaged in mind control
[41:41.440 --> 41:44.880]  traumatizing children and demonizing the second amendment home schooling
[41:44.880 --> 41:51.040]  that was a p this is a huge psi op going on
[41:51.040 --> 41:54.080]  because the globalist can't help but the bankers are in control financially
[41:54.080 --> 42:00.400]  they had to steal 14.8 trillion and growing it'll be 26 plus trillion
[42:00.400 --> 42:05.120]  one year out come this october from the banker takeover october third date
[42:05.120 --> 42:12.480]  it will be 20 plus trillion double the gdp
[42:12.480 --> 42:17.680]  but the american people are still armed so they need to stage terror attacks to
[42:17.680 --> 42:21.760]  get us to rally around patriotically to a fake outside threat to go along with
[42:21.760 --> 42:24.880]  this but this time they're going to claim Arabs are
[42:24.880 --> 42:27.360]  working with militias and white supremacists they're going to mix those
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.760]  three together to demonize militias and i told you this for years i could see
[42:31.760 --> 42:35.200]  this in their attack profile when i made my first film america destroyed by
[42:35.200 --> 42:39.760]  design then when i made road to tyranny years later in 2002
[42:39.760 --> 42:43.440]  i say in there and i give the evidence of how they're planning this in their own
[42:43.440 --> 42:48.400]  documents and their own mo they have created this history
[42:48.400 --> 42:51.760]  and it is a script ready to be activated they're going to say gun owners and
[42:51.760 --> 42:54.800]  veterans have now joined al-qaeda now i've been saying that for years
[42:54.800 --> 42:59.680]  fox news cnn bbc have now introduced that saying white al-qaeda
[42:59.680 --> 43:02.880]  there's tens of thousands they're about to strike
[43:02.880 --> 43:06.480]  it's totally asinine totally ridiculous but they don't care
[43:06.480 --> 43:09.440]  you don't give up your farmer ranch they're going to send in swat teams
[43:09.440 --> 43:12.080]  they're going to kill you and they're going to tell the dumb cops you were
[43:12.080 --> 43:14.640]  al-qaeda
[43:15.440 --> 43:19.040]  now i know this is incredible this is the attack profile
[43:19.040 --> 43:23.840]  now they won't launch this if they know we're awake and up on our hind legs to
[43:23.840 --> 43:27.600]  stand up against them politically that's why they're always probing always
[43:27.600 --> 43:31.520]  sending up trial balloons always testing
[43:31.520 --> 43:36.880]  and that's why they've done this
[43:36.880 --> 43:39.760]  in fact guys print me the actual document i forgot to do that i just
[43:39.760 --> 43:43.280]  read it here on the article thank you
[43:43.280 --> 43:48.240]  now remember that article new york times which we told you about again years
[43:48.240 --> 43:52.320]  ago because it was in philadelphia daily news in 2002 2003
[43:52.320 --> 43:55.680]  multiple articles where they were training the boy scouts with m16s
[43:55.680 --> 43:59.600]  with the local police and feds to quote gun confiscate and do door to door
[43:59.600 --> 44:04.000]  and fugitive apprehension and setting up cordons
[44:04.000 --> 44:07.040]  then you see the army doing all these drills and then coming out at real
[44:07.040 --> 44:10.800]  events and helping at car wrecks and helping stop drunk drivers just to
[44:10.800 --> 44:16.800]  acclimate you it's all happening red dawn and slow motion
[44:17.520 --> 44:21.040]  i'm risking my life to bring you this information this is real ladies and
[44:21.040 --> 44:24.000]  gentlemen
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.840]  government demands inventory of all vfw weapons an informer's reader has passed
[44:27.840 --> 44:30.880]  along an email sent to vfw commanders by the assistant adjunct of the department
[44:30.880 --> 44:34.560]  of texas veterans of foreign affairs indicating the u.s army tacom
[44:34.560 --> 44:38.560]  technical army command is demanding an inventory of all weapons held by vfw
[44:38.560 --> 44:41.840]  post while you may have had possession of the
[44:41.840 --> 44:46.080]  equipment for 20 40 60 or even 100 years the email states it still belongs to the
[44:46.080 --> 44:49.120]  u.s army actually possessions nine tenths of the
[44:49.120 --> 44:53.360]  law those were gifted until recently to the vfw is
[44:53.360 --> 44:57.920]  you're a pack of lying scum as usual you gotta decide veterans
[44:57.920 --> 45:01.920]  do you stand with george washington thomas jefferson do you stand with
[45:01.920 --> 45:08.320]  andrew jackson do you stand with
[45:08.960 --> 45:12.480]  john f kennedy for that matter do you stand with the veterans and the
[45:12.480 --> 45:16.720]  patriots or do you stand with the alien banking force that is taking control of
[45:16.720 --> 45:20.960]  our government it's time to choose sides it's time to draw
[45:20.960 --> 45:24.480]  lines in the sand it's time to gut up and stop living in denial and making
[45:24.480 --> 45:30.240]  jokes about this this is real and if the enemy
[45:30.240 --> 45:32.960]  tests us and thinks you're going to go along with this and that you're living
[45:32.960 --> 45:35.520]  in delusion they're going to pull the trigger on this they're going to drop
[45:35.520 --> 45:39.520]  the hammer they're going to initiate hot operations

[56:25.600 --> 56:29.040]  and by the way there's now mainstream articles today about how obama's
[56:29.040 --> 56:35.520]  continuing secret arrest secret kidnapping of people
[56:35.520 --> 56:38.720]  that is still ongoing so that is coming up you see when they start getting rid of

[56:53.760 --> 56:59.280]  and only if you are in the vfw and have seen this email or if you're in the vfw
[56:59.280 --> 57:02.960]  and haven't seen it but have a comment on it on all the other mainstream articles
[57:02.960 --> 57:07.040]  about them training to have the the boy scouts with machine guns come
[57:07.040 --> 57:10.000]  after you people say well they're kids we'll wipe them out
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.680]  it's meant for three or four years from now when they're 18 and still young and
[57:13.680 --> 57:18.720]  ignorant to go after you okay that's the whole point of this
[57:18.720 --> 57:22.720]  government demands inventory of all vfw weapons
[57:22.720 --> 57:26.560]  according to the emailing attempt to hide the items will be dealt with severely
[57:26.560 --> 57:30.320]  please do not try to hide this is all weapons and equipment not
[57:30.320 --> 57:34.720]  accounted for will be reported to the fbi and vatf as stolen or military
[57:34.720 --> 57:36.880]  equipment and there's really the key they're
[57:36.880 --> 57:41.920]  going to stick the fbi and vatf on you at the vfw this is all part of
[57:41.920 --> 57:45.840]  inducting the vfw to be snitches because they know most people over the
[57:45.840 --> 57:49.360]  decades have ended up taking stuff home or because the government offered it
[57:49.360 --> 57:52.880]  they gave you just tons of equipment as you know
[57:52.880 --> 57:56.000]  but see now they've compromised you the way they compromise the troops in iraq
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.560]  is they say you've been here six months as a private
[57:58.560 --> 58:02.000]  here's ten thousand dollars just for the extra trouble you've had of cash but
[58:02.000 --> 58:03.680]  don't tell anybody you were given this but
[58:03.680 --> 58:06.240]  the white house wants you to know they appreciate you this has come out in the
[58:06.240 --> 58:09.200]  news and then a year later they've gotten 30
[58:09.200 --> 58:13.120]  grand on average as a as a private and they say by the way you're going to be
[58:13.120 --> 58:16.240]  part of this other corrupt stuff we're doing we're going to report you stole
[58:16.240 --> 58:19.520]  that money so this is really about inducting the
[58:19.520 --> 58:23.600]  vfw into being spies this is about getting them all
[58:23.600 --> 58:27.360]  scared and getting them to start complying to do whatever they're told
[58:27.360 --> 58:32.880]  just watch 1-800-259-9231 will our veterans bow to this
[58:32.880 --> 58:36.400]  tyranny probably they'll probably hand their
[58:36.400 --> 58:42.800]  personal firearms in as well and that when they're told to do that

[59:58.560 --> 1:00:01.120]  engage
[1:00:01.120 --> 1:00:08.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:15.040]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now
[1:00:15.040 --> 1:00:20.240]  live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:29.120]  there are many rules to living in a dictatorship of the bankers to living in
[1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:32.480]  a tyranny the living under despotism
[1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:37.200]  but one of the most important rules probably the cardinal rule of tyranny
[1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:41.040]  is to criminalize the non-criminal to make everything criminal
[1:00:41.040 --> 1:00:44.160]  to pass so many laws that no one even knows what the laws and
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:47.840]  regulations and bureaucracies are and all the new little fake courts and
[1:00:47.840 --> 1:00:50.880]  bureaucracies to where everyone at any time
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:54.480]  can be investigated and imprisoned or fined and feed
[1:00:54.480 --> 1:01:00.000]  to the tyranny and thousands of laws are being passed criminalizing
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:05.680]  all behavior basically or there's not even a law that you have to be
[1:01:05.680 --> 1:01:08.960]  vaccinated but if you don't vaccinate your kids they'll cps of in many cases
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:11.920]  or there's no law that you can't yell at your
[1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:14.960]  children or even spank them but they imprison you and
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:18.320]  take your children when there is no law that's on record see
[1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:21.680]  this is what a tyranny is and they have their administrative law courts they
[1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:25.920]  have these family law courts that are really the eugenics law courts set up
[1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:28.800]  in the last hundred years in the western world
[1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:32.080]  and that's all historical fact
[1:01:33.120 --> 1:01:37.600]  and so i covered this article in the last hour government demands inventory of
[1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:41.040]  all vfw weapons and it says we don't care if it's a
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:44.240]  spanish-american war civil war we don't care if it's
[1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:48.400]  over a hundred years old we will send the batf and the
[1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:52.400]  fbi with swat teams for stolen military equipment
[1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:58.960]  and see swords knives tanks missiles the fed said we want to give you
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:01.840]  decommissioned and you see on a lot of them gifted
[1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:06.880]  by the u.s army to vfw chapter and and and you drive through small towns and
[1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:10.800]  see the vfw and there'll be a helicopter in a tank
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:14.640]  or there'll be a missile or there'll be an old howitzer there'll be a world war
[1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:18.320]  one gun or there'll be a spanish-american war gun or there'll be a
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:22.000]  gun of the confederacy next to a gun of the you see them everywhere you see them
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.840]  at the capitals they'll even have revolutionary war
[1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:30.480]  cannons at some of the state capitals some of the mortars you know little
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:34.160]  cannons pointing straight up old-fashioned mortar was just a
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:37.120]  cannon at an angle
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:42.160]  and so nobody has these records these guys are in their grill and steaks and
[1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:46.480]  hamburgers and drinking beer and playing uh poker and 42
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:49.040]  dominos
[1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:51.760]  i mean that's what's going on at the vfw ladies and gentlemen they're talking
[1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:55.120]  about deer hunting they're talking about you know who's house they're
[1:02:55.120 --> 1:02:57.600]  renovating and you know their construction job and other kids just
[1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:01.120]  got into a and m they're not and they're there worshiping the
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:04.160]  government whatever it says they're good people
[1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:08.720]  they're just completely ignorant on average well now the homeland security
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:11.200]  document comes out and says veterans the number one threat
[1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:14.960]  gun owners the number one threat it's public i told you you're the enemy
[1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:18.000]  they know you're not going to go along what's about to happen in this country
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  this is really happening and so we went over
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:25.440]  uh this entire document earlier did you guys print me this document like i was

[1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:25.680]  this is very exciting ladies and gentlemen think about
[1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:31.440]  the successes we've had nobody knew the federal reserve was private
[1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:34.720]  15 20 years ago i mean maybe one percent of the public
[1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:40.720]  now it is beginning to become a majority it's huge issues all over the news
[1:08:40.720 --> 1:08:45.120]  they can't hide the fact it hasn't been audited
[1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:49.600]  in over 50 years they can't hide the fact that it's an off-shore private bank
[1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:52.080]  now and that it's been stealing all this money
[1:08:52.080 --> 1:08:56.480]  they can't hide the fact that all the gold's gone from fort nox
[1:08:56.480 --> 1:08:59.680]  they can't hide the fact that we've been shanghai there was a corporate takeover
[1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:02.560]  in 1913 and they slowly been expanding to take over the
[1:09:02.560 --> 1:09:06.160]  states and our society and now they're figuring out we're awake to them
[1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:09.600]  so they're just trying to steal everything at one time and they think
[1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:12.960]  arrogantly that the public's so stupid that we're not going to bring
[1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:16.880]  them to justice well we are going to bring the new world order to justice
[1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:19.360]  ladies and gentlemen and i'm going to cover bill the audit
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:23.440]  federal reserve now has 207 co-sponsors
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:28.000]  steve watson info wars dot com prison planet dot com info wars dot net
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:32.480]  key story that everybody needs to read and see this is so exciting
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:36.960]  and even if it doesn't pass this time they only need like 11 more
[1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:40.160]  even if it doesn't pass this is gone from when he used to introduce this 10 years
[1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:43.680]  ago i remember interviewing ron paul in 1996 when he introduced these bills
[1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:47.920]  when he first got back in congress he'd been there for one stint in the 70s
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:50.960]  and uh he would have like three or four sponsors
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:56.160]  he's now 207 and people are blowing their phones off the hook
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:09:59.920]  and even if they say no and don't pass it people are saying wait a minute
[1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:04.000]  we can't audit them we can't question them we can't find out what this
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  private group that says it's above the law is doing
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:13.920]  here's forbs and ap today congress opinion is fed over bank of america deal
[1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:21.200]  here's ap i mean this is everywhere congress opinion is the fed
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:27.520]  before it was this mind game trick of saying the federal reserve doesn't handle
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:30.320]  money the federal reserve doesn't tell the irs what to do you just write your
[1:10:30.320 --> 1:10:33.920]  check to the federal reserve when you pay the irs the federal reserve is not
[1:10:33.920 --> 1:10:38.480]  offshore the federal reserves have audited the fed all lies all lies
[1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:41.520]  now they've switched to yeah okay we're above the law big deal
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:45.200]  and people are calling their bluff and now bernacky is an arrogant the bankers
[1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:48.400]  aren't arrogant now when you see them before congress they are freaked out
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:51.440]  and they all need to go to prison and it's because i've been calling for them
[1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:54.560]  to go to prison is so is ron paul in the show that i'm getting death
[1:10:54.560 --> 1:10:58.720]  threats dirty tricks extortion harassment and i'm not going to get
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:02.480]  into it on air it's just believe me folks we are under attack
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:07.600]  and it is intensifying it is intensifying so pray for us support us
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:11.200]  support the money bomb tomorrow think of how far we've come just on this
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:15.280]  and and they've tried to pass all these blanket amnesty plans those all fail
[1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:20.560]  they've tried to pass all these gun confiscation bills those are failing
[1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:23.360]  and they always come back and fight back but we're fighting back we're finding
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:27.600]  our fighting spirit here this is historical
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:30.880]  so i'm going to get back into congress opinion is the fed the bill to audit the
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:35.040]  fed all that's coming up with ron paul but but i feel the top story today was
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:39.120]  going to be what's happening right now with audit
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:42.400]  the private fellow reserve that is huge that is historical
[1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:46.000]  god knows what tricks they're going to play starting new war staging terror
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:49.200]  attacks who knows to get our minds off this i mean
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:52.560]  they're criminals we're calling your bluff they're con artists it's a fraud
[1:11:52.560 --> 1:11:56.000]  the government's illegitimate it's not our republic
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.440]  all we got to do is point this out and get the word out they will fail
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:03.120]  police and military are waiting for us to have the strength politically
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:06.400]  so they can somewhat more safely come out and tell the truth
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:10.080]  i say through caution of the wind justice be done by the heavens falls i love
[1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:14.240]  to say i'm committed to this the enemy would be completely defeated if all
[1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:16.320]  the real men and women out there would stop
[1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:19.120]  having their teeth chatter and their knees knocking and would commit to the
[1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:23.280]  cause of liberty 110 and sign your jane your john handcock

[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:09.200]  i have been contacted by the u s t a c o m about government issued weapons
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:13.760]  and equipment on loan to vfw post statewide the essence of our
[1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:18.400]  conversations centered on inventory of all government's weapons and equipment
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:22.560]  by each vfw post while you may have had possession
[1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:25.680]  of this equipment for 20 46 or even 100 years
[1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:29.520]  it still belongs to the us military in short
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:32.800]  every vfw post will be needed to complete the attached form
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:36.480]  and send to the department this form will then be bounced off the central
[1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:40.400]  database of all texas vfw post at us army
[1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:44.240]  t a c o m to verify serial numbers of each item that has been
[1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:49.200]  issued this is a very extensive list and goes back to before the vfw was
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:52.000]  founded so if you have a canon from the spanish-american war
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:56.160]  it's on the list weapons and equipment
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:02.480]  of butt consists of butt is not limited to
[1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:09.040]  rifles pistols mortars artillery tanks vehicles aircraft missiles aircraft
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:15.920]  carriers etc from any time period i know there are posts that have
[1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:18.960]  weapons they inherited from another post when they
[1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:22.400]  combined or when some other posts closed or donated to another post
[1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:26.880]  when the post could not and no longer maintain the items please do not
[1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:30.000]  try to hide this as all weapons and equipment
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:33.840]  not accounted for will be reported to the fbi and vatf as stolen military
[1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:37.760]  equipment the items will just be properly transferred to your
[1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:41.920]  district post one of their favorite things vatf does at gun shows
[1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:45.440]  if somebody sells a body armor a helmet something that's even there they just
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:50.240]  arrest you they just hate america you see the united states
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:56.240]  previously reveled reveled
[1:14:56.880 --> 1:15:00.000]  in the fact that in europe read thomas jefferson all the founders
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:03.440]  in europe the people didn't have weren't even allowed to own swords
[1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:09.840]  weren't allowed to own muskets much less tanks and and and and and canon
[1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:13.360]  tanks weren't invented till world war one but you get my point now we have all
[1:15:13.360 --> 1:15:16.880]  this it's pure americana pure liberty
[1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:22.240]  libertah that these weapons were served out when they were
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:28.400]  quote obsolete to the local militias that then the vfw grew out of
[1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:33.280]  home land security list you as a number one terrorist i mean
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:36.640]  dh in fact when i finished reading this this document
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:40.240]  when we show them the inventory form a search engine for folks out there in
[1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:43.360]  case they just now tuned in and are watching on prisonplanet.tv or never
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:47.840]  heard the show before listening on the radio

[1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:02.720]  we broke it okay
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:07.520]  i am hopeful that i will not need to remind anyone of the severity
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:11.040]  of punishment that can be administered or the legal bills resulting from
[1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:15.280]  individuals or elected officers give on post property of the post having

[1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:16.880]  the reason i jumped on you is i know i i predicted last hour how this is going
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:19.520]  to go and it's going to be well you guys hold
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:22.880]  just a second you guys signed all the documents so now you're basically our
[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:25.920]  slaves but the point is they're lying about all
[1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:29.680]  this previous stuff and i've got to get the actual year but i talked to a vfw
[1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:32.720]  ahead who won't come on air and he said yeah they started having to sign forums
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:36.480]  the last 15 20 years he's got to pull some documents up but but the issue and
[1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:38.640]  i'm gonna let you talk and i appreciate you calling
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:42.720]  is that they out of the gates are threatening the veterans
[1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:45.760]  who were who had this stuff pushed on them and given to them
[1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:50.320]  to go out and do services for our dead veterans and you don't
[1:24:50.320 --> 1:24:52.720]  it's bad enough to be registering them and making them you know get ready to
[1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:56.560]  turn the stuff in but what's even worse is the fact
[1:24:56.560 --> 1:25:00.800]  that out of the gates they're bullying them and threatening them
[1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:06.480]  with the law when when they do so many great services but just go ahead
[1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:10.080]  you're you're very correct uh by the way i'm the one who called in last week in
[1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:14.480]  about you not the water border so i know what's going on
[1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:19.120]  i uh uh just made a urgent call to my commander of my vfw
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:22.880]  and requested uh to speak to the next vfw meeting
[1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:26.400]  and i would like to challenge all vfw members
[1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:32.080]  to do some research get all this stuff together and inform
[1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:36.160]  uh their their other members that's the only way
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:40.160]  that we're going to get this stopped we all we all know what's going on especially
[1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:43.920]  the people who listen to your program now you're a former marine uh you called
[1:25:43.920 --> 1:25:46.720]  from from vietnam and then a retired police officer
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:50.000]  uh you heard me break down how this is treating them like they're criminals
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:53.440]  out of the gates to get them all scared i bet a million dollars
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:57.840]  next it's going to be we want to get you to serve us now
[1:25:57.840 --> 1:26:01.600]  correct correct they've already tried that now that's why i sort of i was an
[1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:06.720]  officer in the marine corps league and i was on the honor guard did when they
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:10.080]  sent the national guard to iraq they're the ones that does military
[1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:13.760]  funerals in missouri and we filled in i did 280 funerals
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:16.720]  in one year and you get treated like a piece of
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:21.680]  filth and threatened by the batf correct and then i got ostracized from uh
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:25.520]  marine corps league and the bfw from speaking out three and four years ago
[1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:28.000]  about the same things that you talk about every day
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.840]  but i bet they're not laughing at you now no they're not and i'm getting ready
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:36.400]  to jump in big and i'm gonna i'm gonna uh get some things done
[1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:42.320]  might not help but at least i'm gonna try to get the fellow veterans the ones
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:45.600]  especially the bfw members want to risk their life
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:50.160]  to stand up one more time well it's a shame that we would be
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:53.840]  suckered the american people into wars that were questionable and then when it
[1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:58.080]  tyranny is here this is the time i mean if people ever wanted a chance to fight
[1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:02.880]  for america by speaking out at least this is it i mean this is the real deal
[1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:08.160]  this is d-day this is red dawn this is happening my friend
[1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:11.200]  of a former marine friend of mine three years ago
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:15.680]  had come home from vietnam never had a better problem worked in one place all
[1:27:15.680 --> 1:27:18.480]  his life and he finally had a nervous breakdown
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:24.800]  up from ptsd after 40 years and uh he couldn't work anymore he got his
[1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:29.520]  uh 100 percent disability and about two weeks after he got it
[1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:34.080]  the batf pulled up front of his house and took every gun he had
[1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:38.480]  and that just helped break him a little bit more and by the way
[1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:43.200]  by the way there's no law to do that it's felonies under the 68 gun control act
[1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:47.680]  but they're now giving people a fake jurisdiction that's like they four shots
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:51.200]  on you there's no law they take your kids without a proper court order and they
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:54.000]  come and take vets guns every day i see in the news
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:58.400]  when there's not a law for a psychological made-up issue
[1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:01.920]  correct oh god well i mean look it's coming to a head
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:06.640]  they have decided to turn all the young cops and military and the gang members
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:09.120]  and the illegal aliens they're hiring for the military
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:13.600]  loose against the veterans and they plan to have both sides kill each other
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:17.280]  and then bring in the i-4 after everything breaks down
[1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:21.920]  and i'm telling you folks they're planning reconstruction style occupation
[1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:27.280]  in the united states yes they are but what they don't understand is it's going
[1:28:27.280 --> 1:28:31.120]  to be a really bloody and there might not be anything left
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:35.920]  if they do that well i mean it's not talk though americans are always like this
[1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:39.120]  we put up and put up but when the sleeping giant gets up
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:43.920]  that's right i mean it's good i i'd say i'm not looking forward
[1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:47.840]  some captured ss officers was questioned in world war two by
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:51.680]  by the way my family goes all the way back to the civil war
[1:28:51.680 --> 1:28:55.600]  uh served in this country so uh we are all patriots
[1:28:55.600 --> 1:28:59.840]  but they asked this ss officers what they was afraid of most

[1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:08.080]  american they said if we had a big battle and we
[1:29:08.080 --> 1:29:11.600]  annihilated a unit we didn't want to fight the next one's coming up because
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:15.760]  they was mad and they was ruthless so the powers of being i'm sure they're

[1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:38.480]  now because the last 15 20 years they've been having them sign forms to get this
[1:33:38.480 --> 1:33:42.400]  stuff they give to them and push on them you know they ask the veterans oh come

[1:34:00.640 --> 1:34:04.160]  obama said no more brass left over from the military
[1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:07.840]  for reloading could be sold to big companies and they're uh
[1:34:07.840 --> 1:34:11.440]  introduced all these bills totally in the second amendment as we know it
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:15.760]  this is all happening this is all real and it's just going to
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:20.640]  incrementally continue but even though it's incremental the incrementalism is
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:29.360]  accelerating now it is intensifying now it is
[1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:35.600]  expanding now and the question is as a society
[1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:39.920]  what are we going to do about this we have private outside banks
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:43.920]  that are having their way with the people and as soon as ron paul gets on
[1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:46.560]  with us that's what we're going to discuss
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:51.680]  is the bill that he's introduced that's now got over 200 sponsors
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:55.200]  bill to audit fellow reserve now has 207 cosponsors
[1:34:55.200 --> 1:34:58.160]  new names being added every day momentum building
[1:34:58.160 --> 1:35:02.240]  for ron paul and the american people identifying the outside criminal
[1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:05.360]  organization the private bankers that have engineered the collapse
[1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:08.640]  they've taken over our society this is the new world order we have their
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:12.240]  minutes we have their documents we have it all we understand
[1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:15.360]  what they're doing and what they're setting up
[1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:19.120]  and what they are
[1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:21.680]  creating
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:26.560]  bill to audit fellow reserve now has 207 cosponsors
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:30.000]  new names being added every day momentum building for the american people
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:33.200]  thanks to ron paul and all of your phone calls to congress all the letters to
[1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:37.440]  congress at a time of writing a bill that would
[1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:40.560]  see the federal reserve bank audited for the first time 59 years
[1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:44.560]  has 207 cosponsors in the house and is gaining traction
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:48.560]  with every single day now we've seen numbers of 200s what we confirm
[1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:52.560]  daily paul saying 207 we can talk to the man himself
[1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:55.520]  congressman ron paul the hardest working man in congress
[1:35:55.520 --> 1:35:59.600]  dr ron paul hailing from texas i'm so honored to be a texan with him
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:02.640]  uh congressman how many sponsors does it really have
[1:36:02.640 --> 1:36:08.560]  well it's actually 209 right now yeah you heard it here first 209
[1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:12.000]  so we have to almost check minute by minute and they're coming in faster and
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:15.920]  easier now and uh... uh... the product percentage of the new
[1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:20.480]  uh... people are democrats because a lot of the republicans are already on so
[1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:23.680]  it is spreading i think the people at the grass roots have done the job that
[1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:26.640]  they need to do and when we feel
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:30.480]  really be depressed about how slow congress works
[1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:34.960]  we do have a system that will respond if we wake up enough people but
[1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:38.880]  that's a tough job but it did they will respond when they hear from the people
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:43.200]  congressman how long have you worked to get this many sponsors i mean you've
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:46.320]  been introducing this bill for a decade haven't you
[1:36:46.320 --> 1:36:49.840]  yes it's been probably ever since i've been in congress i don't know if i've
[1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:53.440]  ever skipped any but there's never been any uh...
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:57.280]  uh... general support from the public but because of the financial crisis because
[1:36:57.280 --> 1:37:00.400]  of the presidential campaign the interest in the federal reserve all of a
[1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:03.680]  sudden to come together uh... so this is by far
[1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:07.120]  the uh... most interest uh... that we've had them
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:10.160]  and quite frankly i think it's the most interesting way they were had since the
[1:37:10.160 --> 1:37:13.040]  federal reserve has been established in nineteen thirty
[1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:16.240]  but you know even though the fed contributed significantly if they
[1:37:16.240 --> 1:37:19.280]  didn't cause the whole depression of the twenty of the thirties
[1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:23.600]  nobody was calling for you know audience that had an abolishing the fed
[1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:27.360]  today those are routine chance that we hear
[1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:31.040]  and uh... therefore i think we're making great progress only because they've
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:34.480]  uh... created such a static mess that we're dealing with
[1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:37.600]  well we'll have to change the headline info wars dot com in prison planet dot
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:41.600]  com to two hundred and nine from congressman ron paul so you heard it
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:44.880]  here first sir i don't want listeners to blink or
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:48.800]  viewers to blink because they may miss history
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:52.640]  i don't think even our own movement realizes the gravity
[1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:57.040]  of the fact that it looks like this bill has a good chance of passing if you
[1:37:57.040 --> 1:38:00.960]  get another ten or so sponsors in the federal reserve has hired lobbyists
[1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:03.680]  try to block this their arrogance their veneer of
[1:38:03.680 --> 1:38:06.640]  invincibility their cloak of invincibility is
[1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:09.440]  falling away people see that they can be beat
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:14.000]  they see that they are not above the law it's viral videos with the former fed
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:17.360]  chairman and current fed chairman saying they're above the law and no one can
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:21.360]  look into them and no agency of government of the three branches can
[1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:26.320]  that is asinine on its face for even an uneducated uninformed public
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:30.880]  on our system of government and so i just want to get your take on
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:33.840]  uh what is it like for you to know you're the leader
[1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:37.120]  of something that is so amazingly historical because even if they somehow
[1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:41.120]  beat this this time then the question is how were
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:45.680]  we not able to audit you and so you can see that the momentum
[1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:49.680]  has changed and the pendulum is really shifting i sense
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:55.520]  destiny of the level of 1776 here sir i think there's no doubt about they can't
[1:38:55.520 --> 1:39:00.240]  put the g back in the bottle because uh the the odds are still
[1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:04.080]  you know if the about uh where this is going to go
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:07.920]  i mean there's the powers to be have a lot of uh
[1:39:07.920 --> 1:39:11.120]  a lot of tools that they can use conference committees may they might
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:15.840]  block it in the senate uh they can do all sorts of things
[1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:21.120]  uh so i remain cautiously optimistic because i know it has a long way to go
[1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:24.560]  but the issue will not be quieted down i mean the
[1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:28.480]  issue is out there and uh if you know in in some
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:32.160]  ways let's say we have all this attention in this bill
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:35.360]  and we get the majority in the congress to endorse it and it
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:39.280]  never gets out and never goes anyway it's proof positive
[1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:43.280]  that we really need to do it with them that means instead it'll be that much
[1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:47.280]  greater to get a handle on all this so i think we win
[1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:50.880]  either way because we've gotten the attention of such a large number of
[1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:55.920]  people it's not uh only the very very hardcore constitutionalist
[1:39:55.920 --> 1:40:00.240]  because the grassroots are talking to the very average republican the very
[1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:02.960]  average democrat the moderate the liberal the progressive
[1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:07.280]  and they're all joining it the issue really here is reigning in government
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:10.720]  and transparency uh we should not be fooled into
[1:40:10.720 --> 1:40:14.640]  believing that they have a strong belief in the monetary
[1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:18.960]  policies that we might want i mean they're not all gold standard people or
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:23.520]  anything else which driving this is that the congress has created a mess
[1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:26.240]  the federal reserve has been doing a lot secretly
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:29.760]  and american people want to know what's happening because they've seen too many
[1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:33.760]  special interests bailed out knowing by congress and the treasury but by the
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:38.000]  federal reserve as well and they're demanding answers
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:41.360]  congressman uh in the 12 minutes or so we have left with you i've got so many
[1:40:41.360 --> 1:40:47.680]  important questions concerning this how do we explain to some of the public
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:52.560]  out there that this is all a process of liberty tyranny wasn't born overnight
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:55.840]  in this country and liberty isn't going to take back over
[1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:59.280]  overnight it's a constant battle between those two
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:03.520]  title forces as you know but if people said oh ron paul didn't win so boo who i
[1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:07.520]  said no it built this giant movement now the biggest thing on campus isn't
[1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:11.520]  liberal or fake conservative it's libertarian it's freedom it's a
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:15.120]  constitutionalist and now people are finally seeing that a year
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:21.120]  later that it's building in strength uh and that it's a process
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:25.200]  that even as you just said even if they defeated this time
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:30.240]  then people say well why can't we audit it it's almost better if they do
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:35.040]  uh engage in chicanery and pull out the stops and beat at this time because
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:37.520]  then everybody's going to want to know what they're hiding
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:41.120]  yep that's exactly right and uh that'll just energize our
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:45.360]  our group of young people especially even even more so
[1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:49.920]  but uh i think it's an issue whose time has come and uh it's not going to go
[1:41:49.920 --> 1:41:52.960]  away uh and uh i don't know if you saw jim
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:57.280]  grant's quote today on on the business station but uh
[1:41:57.280 --> 1:42:02.080]  he said that if we ever got that auditing bill passed that it would be
[1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:05.920]  a declaration that the uh Federal Reserve is in a lot worse shape than any of
[1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:09.280]  the banks that went bankrupt but the technically you know in
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:13.120]  in conventional terms the Federal Reserve does not have the assets all
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:17.360]  they have are credits and and obviously that's what we would expect
[1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:21.120]  but uh that would that goes to prove why
[1:42:21.120 --> 1:42:25.040]  uh they can't be the salvation of this country i mean just kind of fitting
[1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:28.240]  money and doing mischief and serving the interests
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:32.400]  uh of their friends that that can't work i think it's going to come to an end
[1:42:32.400 --> 1:42:36.560]  whether we win this legislative victory or not because their system is deeply
[1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:40.080]  flawed ultimately i think the solution comes
[1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:44.000]  uh if we're well prepared to offer it up
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:47.920]  uh when the system totally collapses the the financial structure
[1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:51.600]  has come unglued but the the dollar still
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:55.440]  the dollar still works to a degree you know people still are buying dollars
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:42:58.400]  and they don't know what to do with them but when they get discouraged they
[1:42:58.400 --> 1:43:01.680]  don't hold dollars anymore and then they start buying up hard assets they're
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:04.720]  starting to buy oil now more than a month or so ago
[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:09.280]  and they continue to buy gold and you know china continues to buy gold i mean
[1:43:09.280 --> 1:43:13.040]  not there's a lot of things but the end stages of a situation
[1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:17.200]  like this goes very very rapidly once the sentiment changes
[1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:20.880]  just like when the financial system collapsed uh everybody rushed to
[1:43:20.880 --> 1:43:23.360]  dollars and interest rates went down to one percent
[1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:28.800]  along with what the fed was doing but uh when a currency crisis hit
[1:43:28.800 --> 1:43:32.080]  people want to holy man let's get out of the dollar
[1:43:32.080 --> 1:43:35.360]  and then you'll see the fireworks then we have to be prepared
[1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:40.240]  to say don't just give us a u n central bank i mean the the international
[1:43:40.240 --> 1:43:44.560]  planners are they know what we know and they're making their plans they know
[1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:48.160]  their days are numbered but the contest is between
[1:43:48.160 --> 1:43:52.160]  totalitarianism and liberty and and whoever
[1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:55.680]  uh wants to totalitarian approach has to have
[1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:59.200]  uh government monopolized money and that's what we have to stop
[1:43:59.200 --> 1:44:02.400]  in your gut and we all know what the gut is it's thousands of pieces of data
[1:44:02.400 --> 1:44:05.680]  integrated in and the mind comes up with a prime projection
[1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:09.280]  in your gut congressman do you agree with me that in the last
[1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:15.200]  two months we were about to get the title shift or the flip to our side but
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:18.720]  i can almost spiritually feel it at a dna level
[1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:21.600]  that the shift has happened toward our way
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:26.240]  yes well when i'm out of washington i have two perspectives you know uh
[1:44:26.240 --> 1:44:31.120]  when i go to a college campus and you're you represent talk to people outside of
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:33.360]  washington and there should be reason why
[1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:37.440]  you're seeing signs of optimism but i come up here every single day right now
[1:44:37.440 --> 1:44:43.120]  we're dealing with the estate department uh authorization bill is atrocious
[1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:48.240]  you know that's 18 billion dollars and more mischief and more militarism
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:52.160]  and uh the republicans this time are going to oppose it but it's just a
[1:44:52.160 --> 1:44:54.720]  partisan thing but it'll go sailing right through
[1:44:54.720 --> 1:44:58.080]  so you're saying there's two different worlds and and more and more
[1:44:58.080 --> 1:45:01.600]  it's getting separated and that gulf is widening right in like
[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:05.200]  like this week and i just got off the floor i gave my all of two minutes and
[1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:07.600]  i said you know our president has asked us
[1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:11.040]  to go with pay go pay the bills as you go along
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:14.800]  of course for the liberal that means raise taxes well how can they raise taxes
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:19.360]  that there's no no businesses out there uh that that can pay
[1:45:19.360 --> 1:45:23.040]  but they're not going to pay for this if they're incapable
[1:45:23.040 --> 1:45:26.480]  and if they paid for it by cutting it and they want to spend all this
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:29.680]  uh money overseas they'd have to cut a domestic program which they're not
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:34.000]  going to do so the president's house outside on the tv
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:37.520]  and people say well that does sound good on this president's not a radical
[1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:40.560]  spender he he wants to cut down and he wants to
[1:45:40.560 --> 1:45:44.080]  rein this in and he wants pay go and and he says in
[1:45:44.080 --> 1:45:47.600]  two years from now we're going to you know cut way back we'll deal with
[1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:50.720]  the problems later on and and you know i think
[1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:54.160]  though our crowd is probably like young people
[1:45:54.160 --> 1:45:57.840]  around the world think of those young people in china when when geithner
[1:45:57.840 --> 1:46:01.280]  goes over there and says oh yeah we're going to get things under control
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:05.840]  and we're going to rain back our spending and those students just laugh at them
[1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:09.360]  well i imagine there's a lot of students around the country
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:14.720]  and a lot of other people now who just laugh uh at us up here in washington
[1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:18.000]  but the people here in washington are still in charge
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:21.680]  and uh we haven't converted them and we're just seeing
[1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:26.400]  signs of it that it's possible when we can get 209 people to support an
[1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:30.640]  auditing bill so we just have to do our best and uh
[1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:34.640]  see what happens if see if the calamity hit this before
[1:46:34.640 --> 1:46:39.280]  uh we can make some uh calm deliberate decisions that make some changes
[1:46:39.280 --> 1:46:43.360]  but guess is that we'll have the crisis before we could do that
[1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:47.360]  absolutely things are certainly deepening when do you see the next big
[1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:52.480]  plunge down more deeper into this globally engineered depression
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:56.480]  i think uh i think it's really going down now but the government's statistics
[1:46:56.480 --> 1:47:00.560]  sort of are giving people a false sense of security so i think we're still
[1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:03.840]  slipping but there's there will be more announcements and
[1:47:03.840 --> 1:47:07.760]  more bankruptcies and and probably more commercial property
[1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:11.840]  problems and more states going bankrupt and more unemployment
[1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:16.880]  then finally the uh euphoria on wall street of the last four months is
[1:47:16.880 --> 1:47:21.120]  dissipating and that'll feed into a lot of disappointments uh
[1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:25.040]  but you know even though wall street has done a little bit better by these prices
[1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:28.880]  going up a little bit i don't think the average guy out there that lost his
[1:47:28.880 --> 1:47:34.080]  job and started to feel any better yet uh and then i was impressed the other day
[1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:37.840]  that some of the news media have reported that the
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:41.360]  real rate of unemployment isn't nine percent
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:44.800]  it's like eighteen percent you know when you add up all the people who don't
[1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:48.960]  look for jobs anymore or who worked couple hours a week so
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:52.960]  it's a it's a very serious problem and exactly the mainstream media is now
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:55.840]  having to admit more and more that the government is lying and spending
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:47:59.200]  because they want to keep some credibility sir i want to specifically
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:04.480]  ask you in the time we have left how do we help you get this bill
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:10.640]  passed how do we help you get hr 1207 that has 209 sponsors now
[1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:14.960]  as of uh june 10th 2009 on this wednesday edition
[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:18.880]  what can we do to get this pass what can we do
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:22.400]  because going back to you and mckinney roughs when you gave a speech
[1:48:22.400 --> 1:48:25.920]  after i did five years ago it's in my film matrix of evil
[1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:30.240]  you talked about how the key was when the global crisis came in
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:35.920]  the establishment would try to use the crisis to bring in their bank of the
[1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:39.200]  world their world currency because you were reading the same global documents
[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:42.240]  i was and then now it's all over the news and
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:45.360]  they're posing as the saviors and the public is going wait a minute you're
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:48.560]  the guys that did this so they are looking to you and others
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:52.800]  uh so there's this vacuum that's about to happen and and i mean just speaking to
[1:48:52.800 --> 1:48:55.280]  the fact that as you always said when this happened
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:58.880]  we had to put in the maximum effort so we want to put in the maximum effort
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:02.560]  you're the general you're the george washington sir what do we do
[1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:06.240]  i think we just do more of what we're doing now and building our numbers i
[1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:09.040]  mean you have a large number of people that listen to you and you continue to
[1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:13.600]  do the things that you're best at now falling up from our campaign we started
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:17.040]  the campaign for liberty and that website helps bring people together and
[1:49:17.040 --> 1:49:22.240]  our numbers continue uh to grow but right now in a more specific way
[1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:26.320]  they need to go to campaign for liberty get the names of those who've signed on
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:30.320]  and find out exactly the congressman who have not
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:34.400]  and then instead of if your congressman has already signed on go
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:38.960]  go to the neighboring congressman and then you know and organize and find out
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:42.960]  where the meetup group is and enlist these people on the internet and go to
[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:45.600]  their office go i mean you could go shake their hand couldn't you
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:50.080]  yeah that's it thank you then and when the members come in
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:54.000]  and talk to me they say don't come up and they'll be very nice and they're just
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:57.040]  trying to do their job they what is this bill that the grass roots are all
[1:49:57.040 --> 1:49:59.760]  riled up about 1200 and something and i said
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:03.520]  oh it has to do with transparency of the feds so we know what they're doing oh
[1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:08.720]  oh god for them then they sign on but they came to me not because they
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:12.480]  wanted to be on ron paul bill but because the grass roots were telling
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:16.560]  him actually politically i have to take a little credit it is a little more
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:20.080]  popular being on ron paul bill now than it used to be
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:23.280]  oh yeah you're out there setting you're out there setting bushfires the minds
[1:50:23.280 --> 1:50:26.000]  of men and women everywhere you've been introducing this
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:29.840]  what i mean i remember 10 12 years ago you'd get like five six sponsors for
[1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:33.600]  this it's changing now it's politics i mean
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:37.440]  especially marginal democrats and marginal republicans when they need
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:42.640]  is 10 or 15 percent of the vote if somebody if it was a democrat in a
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:48.000]  republicans seat boy they really want to pay attention to what i'm doing and
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:52.560]  congressman in congressman in closing uh i want to uh
[1:50:52.560 --> 1:50:56.640]  ask you two quick questions number one there's a there's a domino effect isn't
[1:50:56.640 --> 1:51:00.800]  there from what you've been doing because as you move to audit the fed other
[1:51:00.800 --> 1:51:03.200]  agencies and groups and governments start thinking
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:07.520]  here's a p today congress subpoenas the fed about where all the billions of
[1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:10.720]  dollars the bank of america went because they won't tell senator
[1:51:10.720 --> 1:51:13.920]  sanders and congressman paul and others yourself
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:18.160]  uh so again here's this idea of holding these guys accountable is starting to
[1:51:18.160 --> 1:51:22.320]  happen isn't it oh yeah it'll be contagious and uh that is
[1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:27.040]  that is very good and i think that uh fortunately we can get
[1:51:27.040 --> 1:51:33.120]  all political uh groups together on transparency and then then we can
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:35.920]  argue out what we want to do and uh and
[1:51:35.920 --> 1:51:39.680]  matter of fact barney frank has been helpful to me on this
[1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:43.360]  but he wanted to make sure i knew he i didn't he didn't agree with me on the
[1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:48.000]  ultimate monetary policy that's okay if they believe in transparency
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:51.520]  then open debate but i so strongly feel that
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:55.120]  if we get transparency of the fed and the people know what they've done
[1:51:55.120 --> 1:51:59.680]  i think their days are numbered well it's been said that an audit of the fed
[1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:03.680]  will abolish the fed because as soon as all the admitted criminality we can see
[1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:06.720]  them doing openly i mean what do you expect to find
[1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:09.840]  if we do get the audit or how will they fight that
[1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:13.440]  i think there'll be some surprises but i'd be most interested in what they've
[1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:16.480]  done with the international organization which come the country they've
[1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:18.960]  bailed out and which central banks that they helped
[1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:22.080]  what they have done with gold and whether or not they've loaned out and sold
[1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:26.560]  gold and how they manipulate markets i i would imagine they even manipulate
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:31.920]  stock markets for that matter uh... and how they do it would be the thing
[1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:35.040]  i i think it would be a big audit you know i think
[1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:39.680]  once they get it there to trace that thing through it may be a big complex
[1:52:39.680 --> 1:52:44.880]  matter because it's internationalism i see my time is running out and i have to
[1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:48.240]  say goodbye congressman thank you in closing you'll hear about the news the
[1:52:48.240 --> 1:52:51.360]  first next in the next few days we broke it
[1:52:51.360 --> 1:52:55.200]  uh... just like the dhs documents demonizing yourself and others
[1:52:55.200 --> 1:52:58.000]  the government is demanding an inventory of even
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:01.120]  hundred-year-old cannons at all vfw post
[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:03.920]  and are and threatening to have b a t f raids
[1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:08.240]  if the veterans of foreign wars doesn't basically become their little snitches
[1:53:08.240 --> 1:53:11.120]  so i hope you'll look into this congressman on top of everything else
[1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:13.360]  you're doing thank you so much very good
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:17.280]  thank you so much congressman take care there he goes ladies and gentlemen on
[1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:21.360]  to the next matter a very busy man congressman ron paul
[1:53:21.360 --> 1:53:24.240]  and we skip that break because he got on this a little bit late
[1:53:24.240 --> 1:53:29.120]  running off of the floor to join us okay ladies and gentlemen
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:32.240]  uh... we're i know some stations probably went to break then even though
[1:53:32.240 --> 1:53:35.120]  it's not a local station break it is a uh...
[1:53:35.120 --> 1:53:38.480]  it is a network break that we skip we only skip network breaks occasionally
[1:53:38.480 --> 1:53:40.800]  when we have somebody like charlie sheen or jesse
[1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:45.920]  ventura ron paul or somebody of that uh... willy nelson on the show and i've
[1:53:45.920 --> 1:53:50.240]  got limited time with them so there went congressman
[1:53:50.240 --> 1:53:54.320]  ron paul and i got that info out to him
[1:53:54.320 --> 1:53:59.040]  just like i called their office well we're going to join some stations now
[1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:03.520]  here we go well i just had congressman ron paul
[1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:05.760]  on with us for some stations that may have gone to break
[1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:08.720]  that was a network break but some stations still take
[1:54:08.720 --> 1:54:13.280]  breaks they're not supposed to uh... but uh... regardless we just had him on
[1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:16.960]  during uh... that uh... last a little segment with us
[1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:22.800]  as well talking about a host of issues very very exciting interview with him
[1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:26.240]  and when we broke the myack report we broke the dhs report
[1:54:26.240 --> 1:54:30.560]  listeners would call ron paul's office saying hey you've been listed as a
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:33.840]  terrorist and ron paul didn't say this but his
[1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:37.200]  office said that can't be true and then later they said oh my god it is
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:40.480]  so i wanted to let ron paul know personally i know he's going to hear
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:44.080]  about this from me that it's from us and it's true
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:48.880]  vfw is vatf is threatening to raid them and confiscate
[1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:52.800]  uh... even world war one spanish-american war and
[1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:56.080]  also they were given uh... civil war cannons they're saying you have to
[1:54:56.080 --> 1:55:00.160]  register all those with us or we're going to swat team you with the vatf
[1:55:00.160 --> 1:55:03.680]  and uh... that is a fact and we have broken it and i have confirmed it
[1:55:03.680 --> 1:55:07.920]  and it is absolutely massive news okay i have just done
[1:55:07.920 --> 1:55:11.200]  um an interview with ron paul i want to get back to your calls
[1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:15.760]  as vfw situation get in the economy and a host of other
[1:55:15.760 --> 1:55:20.800]  issues but i also want listeners to know that the money bombs coming up tomorrow
[1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:24.400]  and we're getting a huge response already people are really excited
[1:55:24.400 --> 1:55:27.360]  uh... thousands of people have signed up and pledged to give
[1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:29.760]  this is your chance to be part of history think of everything we're doing
[1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:31.120]  think of everything we're going through
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:33.680]  think of everything we're trying to build here
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:37.200]  can i make these high quality expensive films and then i release them for free
[1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:40.560]  on google and youtube now they're in higher quality at prison planet dot tv
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:44.160]  and prison planet dot tv members and their memberships make that possible
[1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:47.520]  and they also get the live tv show and and all the other films and books and
[1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:50.160]  things being prison planet dot tv members but
[1:55:50.160 --> 1:55:52.880]  we need to raise more capital to hire a couple more video editors and other
[1:55:52.880 --> 1:55:57.120]  webmaster to us some more personnel some people to
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:56:00.560]  moderate the comments so the death threats aren't on there so the fbi
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:04.640]  doesn't come to pay to me as wired magazines reporting on yesterday and ap
[1:56:04.640 --> 1:56:08.400]  as well so we we need funds here i mean think
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:13.520]  this is a little operation there are about
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:16.640]  fourteen people in this office and the watson brothers and curtain mo in new
[1:56:16.640 --> 1:56:19.200]  mexico and a few other people a few contract
[1:56:19.200 --> 1:56:23.520]  uh... i think i mean that's it
[1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:27.520]  and i need more personnel to go to the next level
[1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:32.240]  and there's nothing bang for the buck like this radio show that the you know
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:35.680]  when you buy books buy videos support our sponsors that funds us when you
[1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:39.200]  donate on the second annual two thousand nine money bomb at info wars
[1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:42.960]  money bomb dot com tomorrow starting in the morning it's going to start up and
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:46.880]  run till friday when the show starts
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:49.280]  you know we've got on there the twenty thousand dollars have come in it's more
[1:56:49.280 --> 1:56:51.600]  like sixty i need to go ahead and we have to
[1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:55.520]  manually enter the money but about sixty grand has come in so far i want to go
[1:56:55.520 --> 1:56:59.440]  well above two hundred fifty thousand dollars sounds like a lot it's not
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:02.560]  when you're talking to try to do tv and finish our tv studio
[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:07.040]  look at all we've done i mean in a year found the office moved in
[1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:09.920]  built a studio there was a gutted warehouse in here
[1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:13.440]  i had to haggle companies you know to build it and try to get a good deal
[1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:18.480]  found the cheapest area in austin uh... we're actually kind of out on the edge
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:21.600]  of austin i just i'm proud of my crew and what they
[1:57:21.600 --> 1:57:24.320]  did in my and people that built the studio everybody
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:27.920]  so we found a place moved into it launched it made the obama deception
[1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:31.520]  other films while we were doing it on top of the radio showing everything
[1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:34.720]  and it's so hard to go from ten people in your office
[1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:38.320]  to to a bigger office in fourteen or fifteen and then we want to go to the
[1:57:38.320 --> 1:57:40.720]  next level of twenty twenty five thirty people
[1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:44.000]  it gets easier once you have the foundation
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:47.920]  and we're now at that launch pad we built the rocket it's loaded it's fueled
[1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:52.080]  it's got the gantry on it as they say you ain't seen
[1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:56.720]  nothing yet and you know all the big interviews we have the all the activist
[1:57:56.720 --> 1:57:59.760]  groups we have on all the legislation we battle that's bad all the good
[1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:02.880]  legislation we push this is really a fulcrum
[1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:07.280]  or one of the main centers i would say the anti-dual order movement
[1:58:07.280 --> 1:58:14.320]  uh... is a bipolar or double-polar uh... dose polar system with the ron paul and
[1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:17.520]  then the alex jones and that's been recognized by many even mainframe
[1:58:17.520 --> 1:58:21.840]  riders there's that you know those title systems
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:27.440]  and ron paul is really the gateway into the deeper information we cover and we
[1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:31.760]  are a gateway to people from the more extreme liberty into the ron paul
[1:58:31.760 --> 1:58:34.960]  revolution it is a great symbiotic relationship

[2:01:51.440 --> 2:01:55.440]  obama ministrations tearing me up uh... when you look at the veterans
[2:01:55.440 --> 2:01:59.200]  the hospital and stuff uh... and the way they've abandoned veterans
[2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:05.440]  you really got to wonder you know i saw the article last night about the vfw
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:09.360]  and it alarmed me because of what happened back in the eighties
[2:02:09.360 --> 2:02:13.600]  with the militia groups and banning uh any military training
[2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:19.280]  with militias and uh it did alarm me so i went to work this morning
[2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:23.440]  and i got a hold of the washington dc headquarters of vfw
[2:02:23.440 --> 2:02:28.240]  and i talked to this fellow who was very perturbed his name is jerry
[2:02:28.240 --> 2:02:31.760]  newberry i have his phone number and give to you offline if you like hold on i
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:36.400]  had a pen in here and it's been run off with like everything else

[2:02:40.640 --> 2:02:43.280]  write down these names it was a jerry newberry
[2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:46.960]  yes sir jerry newberry's public relations washington dc
[2:02:46.960 --> 2:02:50.640]  he's supposed to be one of the head honchos public relations
[2:02:50.640 --> 2:02:57.040]  eight one six seven five six three three nine zero

[2:03:04.800 --> 2:03:10.480]  right um now his is um the official version that he gave to me
[2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:14.800]  uh it seems that the vfw is going to take the side of the government
[2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:18.880]  of course they are it's going to grovel if they told veterans groups to turn
[2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:23.680]  their firearms in and to throw their kids off cliffs the leadership of the vfw
[2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:26.960]  and all these groups would say howl hitler go ahead i understand what you're
[2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:30.560]  saying i really do but it's you know first thing he was very perturbed and
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:34.000]  he said he was defending dan west he said dan west the sergeant
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:39.840]  his internal um mail and his words were threatening not not the government's
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:43.520]  words it was the sergeant's words that were threatening and he was trying to
[2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:48.640]  motivate the post commanders to comply with oh motivate them oh it's always
[2:03:48.640 --> 2:03:52.880]  all in texas and kentucky and california confirmed in the news
[2:03:52.880 --> 2:03:56.240]  it's just base commanders by themselves tell all the troops

[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:02.640]  it was it wasn't obama banning the sale of brass

[2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:10.640]  bills to basically ban the second amendment oh he didn't call for total
[2:04:10.640 --> 2:04:13.840]  gun bans as a state senator oh his attorney general

[2:04:21.680 --> 2:04:25.360]  i know and it gets worse alex because what he says next
[2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:30.240]  is alarming because it's so incriminating uh that it's hard to believe

[2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:06.720]  vfw being told by the feds and the batf turn your guns in and we're gonna come
[2:09:06.720 --> 2:09:09.120]  slot team basically you know register your guns

[2:09:14.080 --> 2:09:18.000]  okay what he said next i found alarming because it was so incriminating
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:21.920]  and he said the holding boils down to get this
[2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:26.000]  they are trying to track down weapons that have been lost
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:32.480]  and turned up at gun shows and that's their official story from from mr
[2:09:32.480 --> 2:09:38.400]  newberry at public relations vfw headquarters and i'll tell you something
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:44.560]  alex these crazy nuts calling calling veterans terrorists they're about to
[2:09:44.560 --> 2:09:47.440]  draw back a stump
[2:09:48.640 --> 2:09:52.800]  you don't think the vets will say i guess i am al-qaeda i guess i didn't know i
[2:09:52.800 --> 2:09:56.960]  hit us on 9 11 i guess the red white and blue is al-qaeda
[2:09:56.960 --> 2:10:01.200]  here's my guns i didn't i didn't know i did the attack but i government couldn't
[2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:05.600]  be wrong i hell abort the kids cps them all put
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:11.040]  fluoride in our water i i'm a terrorist i mean do the vets you
[2:10:11.040 --> 2:10:15.360]  talk to know that homeland security is listing them as the number one threat
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:18.640]  and training the police and paramilitary youth squads
[2:10:18.640 --> 2:10:22.800]  to take them on here is the new york times shang it
[2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:26.240]  well i know a few vets that know about it but i think the truth
[2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:30.080]  most are just totally unconscious drinking heavily
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:33.120]  just just don't know anything about what's going on
[2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:36.480]  and i doubt that this mr newberry knew anything about what was going on
[2:10:36.480 --> 2:10:40.400]  i asked him other thing about the m1 our local post has been
[2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:44.640]  told not to use the m1 that's been modified for blanks
[2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:47.680]  they've been told never to use it anymore and are also would be
[2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:51.360]  confiscated and i asked him about that he refused to comment on it
[2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:58.320]  and you know that that's the honor guard without the m1 there's no honor guard
[2:10:58.320 --> 2:11:02.640]  well you can't have veterans with guns on tv i mean uh...
[2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:06.880]  have you seen all the news reports about where vets will try to carry their
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:11.600]  their vfw rifles in the fourth july parade the cops had them had them hard
[2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:16.960]  oh that's crazy jesus we live well it's not if you're a slave master i mean
[2:11:16.960 --> 2:11:22.640]  america is going to be a nilly uh... nanny state but that's only the front
[2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:25.360]  right behind it's a black mask and an iron fist
[2:11:25.360 --> 2:11:28.640]  and they are going to work i mean look the bankers have openly already banked
[2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:31.520]  rep the nation and stolen more money than we could ever pay back
[2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:34.720]  so they know that they're in trouble you just heard ron paul
[2:11:34.720 --> 2:11:39.120]  i mean we're this close to getting these criminals in jail imagine if we just
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:43.840]  exposed them had them arrested we can start back getting our country back i
[2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:46.800]  mean it we have criminals running the nation
[2:11:46.800 --> 2:11:50.480]  of course they're coming after the guns but but see this isn't alone you add
[2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:53.600]  this into homeland security saying veterans the number one threat
[2:11:53.600 --> 2:11:56.080]  training local police that vets are going to attack
[2:11:56.080 --> 2:11:59.840]  here's the new york times ten minutes into the errant mayhem in the town near
[2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:03.360]  the mexican border and the government of disgruntled iraq war veteran has
[2:12:03.360 --> 2:12:06.960]  already taken out two people one slumped in a desk the other covered in
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:10.080]  blood on the floor
[2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:13.760]  the responding officers eighteen age boys and girls the youngest fourteen
[2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:17.520]  face tripwire a thin cloud of poisonous gas and loud
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:20.880]  shouts bam bam fire from behind a flimsy wall they move quickly
[2:12:20.880 --> 2:12:24.720]  pellet guns drawn and mask affixed united states border patrol
[2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:29.440]  hands up screams out one voice now again they know border patrol is popular so
[2:12:29.440 --> 2:12:32.400]  all these homeland security shows all these shows brainwashing the kids
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:35.840]  they call them border patrol but then they practice take it on vets and
[2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:39.200]  confiscating guns and this goes on all over the nation not
[2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:42.720]  just with the boys counts there it is right there
[2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:46.000]  this is what they're gearing up for they admit it
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:49.440]  and i don't think listeners understand i'm not just saying that
[2:12:49.440 --> 2:12:52.960]  people email me and say oh you're exaggerating no this
[2:12:52.960 --> 2:12:55.680]  you know you heard the retired cop calling from missouri he said no they've
[2:12:55.680 --> 2:13:00.080]  already tried to recruit us in the vfw and the and the and the marine court
[2:13:00.080 --> 2:13:02.720]  veterans group to spy on neighbors and tattle
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:06.160]  i've covered and and been sent by listeners the videos
[2:13:06.160 --> 2:13:11.040]  of the fbi in every county town and city has these meetings where they say
[2:13:11.040 --> 2:13:15.440]  we want your community to come volunteer to help look for terrorist
[2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:18.640]  and then when you show up to it they teach you
[2:13:18.640 --> 2:13:22.560]  all right we're fighting al-qaeda and gun owners and pot dealers
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:26.080]  and we're going to spy on people abusing their kids
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:29.760]  did you see your neighbor over the fence spat their kid call police
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:34.800]  call cpsc so it sounds good come here and fight al-qaeda that it is
[2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:39.600]  you get there and they go okay al-qaeda must spend five minutes on al-qaeda the
[2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:44.720]  next three days on veterans i know some of your veterans but
[2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:48.720]  you're the good veterans are some bad ones well what it comes down to is they've
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:53.120]  turned the entire patriot act something that was adopted you know to do a good
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:57.120]  thing they've turned the entire thing around on the united states people
[2:13:57.120 --> 2:14:01.040]  and it's a gun aimed at us and we're about to get it
[2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:04.400]  and if well they said it was the fight go ahead
[2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:08.160]  i wish we could somehow uh... yeah i don't know how you could do it
[2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:12.240]  but sponsor some sort of a million man march on dc let him know we have a
[2:14:12.240 --> 2:14:16.480]  problem i couldn't sponsor uh... fifty thousand person march would probably
[2:14:16.480 --> 2:14:19.280]  cost twenty grand a fund i don't know that's why we're having the money
[2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:23.600]  bomb tomorrow because everybody keeps saying and it's true i need to do more
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:26.720]  and we need the funds to do it so by the books by the videos donate
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:29.440]  whatever just support us god bless you sir we're gonna
[2:14:29.440 --> 2:14:33.760]  call those phone numbers and uh... folks don't call too much so i've had a
[2:14:33.760 --> 2:14:37.360]  chance to call but it won't matter the media is going to get a hold of this
[2:14:37.360 --> 2:14:39.760]  and you'll see all these quotes in the news about
[2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:44.640]  we can't have veterans with guns and uh... yeah these are batf investigations i
[2:14:44.640 --> 2:14:48.880]  said first hour about this probably has to do with batf at gun shows
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:52.000]  and this will be their excuse to intimidate the vfw and turn them all
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  into stenches and that's now what he was basically saying
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:59.440]  uh... let's go to more callers uh... let's talk to rob in texas and then
[2:14:59.440 --> 2:15:02.720]  james bill john and others go ahead rob
[2:15:02.720 --> 2:15:06.080]  hey alex how you doing good what do you think is going on here
[2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:10.720]  well i'm not quite sure uh... yeah i'm a quarter master at one of the vfw is
[2:15:10.720 --> 2:15:15.920]  here in texas and i got this email i posted on one of our forums
[2:15:15.920 --> 2:15:20.720]  back on april 22nd and uh... one of the things i'm kind of
[2:15:20.720 --> 2:15:24.880]  wondering about is there's a requirement for the vfw is to
[2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:28.880]  to report all their ceremonial rifles every three years
[2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:35.520]  to take on and what raises a question in my mind
[2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:40.720]  is why all of a sudden they need to inventory everything
[2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:44.960]  you know because all these cannons and artillery and everything that the vfw
[2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:48.400]  owns except for the ceremonial rifles are all demilled
[2:15:48.400 --> 2:15:52.400]  they're non-functional that's right for those that don't know
[2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:55.680]  when you drive in front of a vfw in little town you see an army tank and a
[2:15:55.680 --> 2:15:59.440]  helicopter if it even has the gatling gun
[2:15:59.440 --> 2:16:04.080]  on the cobra or if it even has uh... the uh...
[2:16:04.080 --> 2:16:09.440]  the main gun the howitzer on the tank it's been filled
[2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:13.920]  it's it's it's had hot metal poured down into it it's been spiked
[2:16:13.920 --> 2:16:18.720]  and but the issue is again there you are the terrorist this is a way to
[2:16:18.720 --> 2:16:22.160]  introduce you to the batf introduce you to secret police
[2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:24.800]  where you're intimidated and you're going to feel good when the
[2:16:24.800 --> 2:16:28.480]  batf and fbi at homeland screed auspices oh it's all right
[2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:31.680]  you're not in trouble we want you to work for us and you're thinking about a
[2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:33.840]  rifle that came up missing ten years ago and you're going
[2:16:33.840 --> 2:16:38.560]  all right what do you need to know we just want you to fight al-qaeda
[2:16:38.560 --> 2:16:42.960]  by the way uh watch your neighbors no i'm serious that's how this goes
[2:16:42.960 --> 2:16:48.000]  uh... i know and uh... you know i have some concerns with the vfw especially
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:50.960]  with the dhs report you know calling all of us
[2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:54.240]  veterans terrorists you know uh...
[2:16:54.240 --> 2:16:58.960]  the vfw was i saw the memo from the national commander and they were
[2:16:58.960 --> 2:17:02.240]  basically supporting the government's decision to do this
[2:17:02.240 --> 2:17:06.000]  i remember that i remember when the vfw came out on tv
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:10.320]  and said i know it seems strange to the veterans of the number one threat not
[2:17:10.320 --> 2:17:14.080]  even al-qaeda and gun owners are number two and then al-qaeda
[2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:20.080]  evil vets evil gun owners al-qaeda and and that was on national news going
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:23.040]  but veterans are bad they're dangerous
[2:17:23.040 --> 2:17:26.640]  so you know and i don't know i don't appreciate that in the american
[2:17:26.640 --> 2:17:28.960]  legion zack is here with al-qaeda
[2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:32.320]  assert we have to take you in
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:36.240]  we may have to take you in uh...
[2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:39.200]  for a little bit of waterboarding to make sure by the way they're now water
[2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:42.960]  boarding marijuana suspects i have the mainstream news article
[2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:45.840]  and you're against waterboarding maybe you're with al-qaeda
[2:17:45.840 --> 2:17:48.880]  i mean do you see how this whole thing works now
[2:17:48.880 --> 2:17:52.720]  oh yeah the whole problem is is american public in general
[2:17:52.720 --> 2:17:56.400]  is in denial of what's going on they think that
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:18:00.400]  oh everything's going to be okay we're going to turn around and vote republican
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:04.240]  and or do something to where our government isn't going to walk all
[2:18:04.240 --> 2:18:07.520]  over us i don't see that happening no no no
[2:18:07.520 --> 2:18:10.800]  when republicans are in power the right foot steps forward
[2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:13.920]  and then when the democrats are in power the left foot steps forward can't we
[2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:18.000]  look below the leg i mean past the legs of the body in the new world order
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:22.640]  you got these international bankers are the body and north comes their arms
[2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:26.720]  the irs is their mouth devour us and and and
[2:18:26.720 --> 2:18:30.640]  they just sprouted a new mouth that's the green taxes the carbon tax and

[2:34:48.720 --> 2:34:51.040]  oh my god that's the same thing it was on alex
[2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:54.960]  so you gotta be kidding anyway there's one thing i wanted to point out here
[2:34:54.960 --> 2:34:58.720]  today on today's msnbc.com
[2:34:58.720 --> 2:35:03.600]  okay the story the other story that you uh we're talking about pertaining to the
[2:35:03.600 --> 2:35:07.680]  grandmother who was zapped by the cop yes and
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:13.680]  yes this is on i'm looking at it right now today's msnbc.com
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:17.200]  they say here great grandmother dared cop dared
[2:35:17.200 --> 2:35:21.200]  the cop to taser so he did they have the film
[2:35:21.200 --> 2:35:25.840]  says woman 72 refused to sign traffic ticket
[2:35:25.840 --> 2:35:30.160]  an argument and then a zap and then she finally submitted
[2:35:30.160 --> 2:35:33.840]  and said i'll do it and that's when he's after and they the the mainstream media
[2:35:33.840 --> 2:35:36.880]  they just released us two days ago we were talking about weeks ago before
[2:35:36.880 --> 2:35:40.720]  they released it and of course his story is not exactly what
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:44.400]  he said and her story isn't exactly what she said that's normally how it is
[2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:48.240]  but the issue is the media loves it legitimizing look taser and women for
[2:35:48.240 --> 2:35:54.000]  not signing tickets is good and that message is a force man
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:57.600]  well look pretty soon they're gonna line well women up and blow their heads off
[2:35:57.600 --> 2:36:00.880]  right and if the yuppies think that's gonna get them some money they'll do it
[2:36:00.880 --> 2:36:04.160]  right um you gotta worry about the government and then the sheep the sheep
[2:36:04.160 --> 2:36:08.080]  are very dangerous right well the other thing the other thing i want to uh
[2:36:08.080 --> 2:36:11.760]  just mention real quick when when i called you the other week with uh when
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:16.400]  he had jesse ventura on did i hear him correctly i mean was he like selling
[2:36:16.400 --> 2:36:19.280]  out sitting there saying give me the post in cuba so i can go down there and
[2:36:19.280 --> 2:36:22.880]  drink rum and smoke cigars and i'll do whatever you say was that what are you
[2:36:22.880 --> 2:36:26.320]  saying i didn't hear him say that i mean i it's a
[2:36:26.320 --> 2:36:30.480]  joke saying i would love to be the first ambassador to cuba
[2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:35.280]  okay and and uh yeah i mean in a way he's saying
[2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:39.360]  he know he's obsessed with with scuba diving in the beach and surfing
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:44.560]  sure and so and so the joke was i want to job
[2:36:44.560 --> 2:36:48.240]  yeah he's saying he's saying no it was in the connet
[2:36:48.240 --> 2:36:52.320]  he was in the body of discussion i mean it's all the connotation it's in it's
[2:36:52.320 --> 2:36:56.800]  all how it's framed he's saying we ought to open up cuba
[2:36:56.800 --> 2:37:00.720]  50 years of sanctions is stupid i'll be the first ambassador
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:04.080]  so it was a joke but i bet if he was offered it he'd take it yeah
[2:37:04.080 --> 2:37:08.880]  because he agrees with that policy and i would tell jesse take that post because
[2:37:08.880 --> 2:37:12.160]  then we have a 9-11 truth there is the ambassador to cuba
[2:37:12.160 --> 2:37:15.920]  and we can have him on the show and get even more influence
[2:37:15.920 --> 2:37:18.960]  right right right i don't think it's a sellout
[2:37:18.960 --> 2:37:22.160]  all right no that's that's cool i just you know i was hearing that i was like
[2:37:22.160 --> 2:37:25.760]  oh whoa are you kidding so i mean i don't think he said i'm gonna sell out
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:30.640]  he said give me the post in cuba right anyway all right well we all know it's
[2:37:30.640 --> 2:37:32.720]  not gonna happen so let's not hold our breath

[2:42:59.920 --> 2:43:03.840]  about 40 percent of the price it was a year ago so i said oh i can't get
[2:43:03.840 --> 2:43:07.280]  more space but now they haven't leased it it's sitting there

[2:46:50.160 --> 2:46:54.720]  i've got this video we posted it days ago i know it's that we are change
[2:46:54.720 --> 2:47:00.400]  la whack la.org but we're gonna play some of it after the break but
[2:47:00.400 --> 2:47:04.400]  in a nutshell why was it so important whoever wants to speak up first go
[2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:07.440]  ahead i'll let maybe steward wasn't there but
[2:47:07.440 --> 2:47:11.440]  bruno wasn't jeremy was but you guys have been at many other events as well
[2:47:11.440 --> 2:47:14.960]  confronting people why was this important who is general mires for
[2:47:14.960 --> 2:47:18.960]  people that don't know this is jeremy of course jeremy
[2:47:18.960 --> 2:47:22.080]  thank you very much alex for having us on and i appreciate all the good work
[2:47:22.080 --> 2:47:25.760]  that you're doing um richard mires uh... was the acting
[2:47:25.760 --> 2:47:30.240]  uh... head of the joint chief of staff on nine eleven uh... while the real head
[2:47:30.240 --> 2:47:33.680]  was out of town like many other important people on that day
[2:47:33.680 --> 2:47:37.440]  and uh... since that day he's changed the story at
[2:47:37.440 --> 2:47:42.400]  numerous times about where he was when the building that he operates out of the
[2:47:42.400 --> 2:47:47.120]  pentagon was hit and uh... he doesn't change his story to
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:52.480]  repeatedly but go ahead and uh... he doesn't appear to desire to uh... really
[2:47:52.480 --> 2:47:55.840]  uh... clear his whole role in all this up
[2:47:55.840 --> 2:47:59.600]  he doesn't want to come really clean about all these uh... memetic war games
[2:47:59.600 --> 2:48:02.480]  and terror drills that were occurring at the same time
[2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:05.280]  that the terror attacks actually were pulled off
[2:48:05.280 --> 2:48:09.440]  so at this point he's at the very least he's considered a suspect in in the
[2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:12.800]  nine eleven black i'll say it no way he wasn't involved
[2:48:12.800 --> 2:48:17.040]  he was in there making sure norad stood down that's on record i'll say it
[2:48:17.040 --> 2:48:20.240]  general mires is complicit
[2:48:20.240 --> 2:48:22.320]  so
[2:48:24.400 --> 2:48:27.040]  hold on hold on one of the time we got two folks talking
[2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:31.040]  and i'm getting a little bit of static on these lines who was jumping in there
[2:48:31.040 --> 2:48:34.960]  bur dimensions buronev agree that we'd need to call the criminals out for who
[2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:39.200]  they are he's a nine eleven criminal and uh... that's how we label the video
[2:48:39.200 --> 2:48:43.360]  uh... normal is a nine eleven criminal
[2:48:43.360 --> 2:48:46.680]  you know who's got the crackly line there or somebody on the same line
[2:48:46.680 --> 2:48:49.600]  together
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:50.840]  not sure
[2:48:50.840 --> 2:48:53.560]  that's bruno's line bruno i'm gonna let you go in a moment i want to have you
[2:48:53.560 --> 2:48:55.440]  guys back up for a full hour soon
[2:48:55.440 --> 2:48:57.440]  because your lines bad but uh...
[2:48:57.440 --> 2:48:59.760]  we'll come back to the other two guys after the break bruno are you still
[2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:01.760]  there
[2:49:01.760 --> 2:49:07.320]  i was gonna let him go after he finishes point go ahead
[2:49:07.320 --> 2:49:09.200]  you know i think we need to call
[2:49:09.200 --> 2:49:13.200]  all the criminals for who they are calm criminals they are not it that we've
[2:49:13.200 --> 2:49:15.960]  reached a threshold in the nine-eleven troops movement
[2:49:15.960 --> 2:49:17.720]  people it's growing quickly
[2:49:17.720 --> 2:49:21.800]  uh... people are getting scared and uh... this is calm what they are the
[2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:24.800]  treasonous traitors nine-eleven criminals
[2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:28.720]  and it's not be nice about it anymore
[2:49:28.720 --> 2:49:31.480]  now there's no doubt they stood down nor have there's no doubt
[2:49:31.480 --> 2:49:35.040]  they ran the exact rills exact targets being hit the exact time bruno you have
[2:49:35.040 --> 2:49:36.240]  a lot of courage

[2:54:05.640 --> 2:54:10.000]  Yeah next week I'm gonna have the folks from We Are Change LA on for a full hour
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:15.120]  I gotta get Luke on too from New York just all of them are so great.
[2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:21.760]  In closing we let Bruno go because of his bad line Bruno really got roughed up
[2:54:21.760 --> 2:54:25.040]  by these guys they were so cowardly they're saying get out and they're
[2:54:25.040 --> 2:54:27.840]  trying to hold him there for the police get out then they hold you so they can
[2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:31.360]  get you for trespassing at a public event or he actually bought a ticket for
[2:54:31.360 --> 2:54:37.960]  it and then shoving them finishing up Bruno and is gone but Jeremy and Stuart
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:41.320]  Howell both very articulate great research I'm familiar with both of your
[2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:47.320]  work met Stuart a few times finish up with what happened in this event so this
[2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:52.040]  is Jeremy and so Bruno stood up and called out General Richard Myers and
[2:54:52.040 --> 2:54:57.200]  asked him how we could trust him when he's clearly contradicted his own
[2:54:57.200 --> 2:55:05.360]  stories around 9-11 and and then quickly he was booed and a man who a
[2:55:05.360 --> 2:55:10.560]  private individual was the primary one to try to push him out as he tried to
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:14.760]  warn people about their freedoms being taken away and then he was taken out and
[2:55:14.760 --> 2:55:18.880]  then a few moments later I couldn't handle it because they were they were
[2:55:18.880 --> 2:55:25.280]  applauding and they were apologizing to the alleged general for him having to
[2:55:25.280 --> 2:55:28.720]  deal with this and I so I couldn't take it so I stood up and I said that man was
[2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:33.080]  was telling the truth he has changed his story and at that point the same
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:38.960]  private individual came over and that dragged me out into the aisle and then
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:43.280]  gave me a chokehold and pulled me out while I asked it whether this was
[2:55:43.280 --> 2:55:49.320]  America whether he was a patriot and then when we finally got out he said he
[2:55:49.320 --> 2:55:53.800]  told me there were children in there like I he was disturbed that I had made
[2:55:53.800 --> 2:55:58.280]  him do violence in front of the children so it was it was very it was a very
[2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:03.480]  interesting so that's always the mental illness of a tyrant is to then say you
[2:56:03.480 --> 2:56:08.520]  hurt children oh I just took you to a FEMA camp you made me do this you're so
[2:56:08.520 --> 2:56:11.960]  bad what a little punk you know
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:18.360]  but what was great was that at once we got outside one lone proud citizen came
[2:56:18.360 --> 2:56:24.360]  out and and verified to the police that I had been choked and that all the many
[2:56:24.360 --> 2:56:28.120]  of the people in the audience had been clapping so and not and not that he
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:33.800]  agreed with my action but he stood up for my right to to take that action so
[2:56:33.800 --> 2:56:38.200]  it's always the lone individual who stands up who becomes the bastion of
[2:56:38.200 --> 2:56:43.840]  freedom in the power the cops are going to take you to jail for daring to buy a
[2:56:43.840 --> 2:56:47.640]  ticket and then go in and ask a question in an event and you were going to go to
[2:56:47.640 --> 2:56:51.880]  jail for being choked that's how the twisted justice works now in this
[2:56:51.880 --> 2:56:58.280]  country but people are standing up and saying no right and I we realize later
[2:56:58.280 --> 2:57:02.600]  that I didn't I failed to give the direct command to the police officers to
[2:57:02.600 --> 2:57:07.240]  go in and apprehend the man saying that I want to press charges that you got to
[2:57:07.240 --> 2:57:10.720]  tell him you must you know I've I'm filing a complaint I've been assaulted
[2:57:10.720 --> 2:57:15.360]  you've got to tell him to go after him real fast anything from Stewart about
[2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:20.520]  what's happening thanks Alex yeah you know I was in the periphery on this one
[2:57:20.520 --> 2:57:25.160]  but I'm just so proud of everybody in change it's just we all have our
[2:57:25.160 --> 2:57:29.600]  opportunities to stand up when we can how we can the way you put it before we
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:34.360]  came on I thought was great you know this is real and we're just we're genuine
[2:57:34.360 --> 2:57:38.280]  people doing our best because of the weight and the gravity of the importance

[3:00:22.760 --> 3:00:26.880]  online that I I like him a lot more than I like rush limbaugh because I like the
[3:00:26.880 --> 3:00:30.960]  fact that he's a professor that he covers economics and that he really
[3:00:30.960 --> 3:00:35.880]  exposes when I hear him on air the hypocrisy of the Republican Party which
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:40.120]  needs to be done more and more so for the next 30 minutes Walter E. Williams
[3:00:40.120 --> 3:00:43.640]  joins us we then go live to a press conference from the Texas Capitol where

[3:00:50.600 --> 3:00:55.040]  those are already flimsy from a judge but a host of issues to talk about Walter
[3:00:55.040 --> 3:00:58.520]  E. Williams today sir thank you for coming on with us well thank you thank
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:02.440]  you it's great to have you here with us for those that may not who you are most
[3:01:02.440 --> 3:01:06.960]  probably do tell us a little bit about yourself well I'm a I'm a professor of
[3:01:06.960 --> 3:01:11.080]  economics I've been teaching at George Mason University in Fairfax Virginia
[3:01:11.080 --> 3:01:17.920]  for coming going on 30 years and and my big job is trying to convince my fellow
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:24.240]  Americans on the moral superiority of individual liberty and its main ingredient
[3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:30.480]  limited government it's a hard job what do you think of Ron Paul I think he's a
[3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:35.040]  I think he's a great but he's what he's I think he's one of the few and perhaps
[3:01:35.040 --> 3:01:39.480]  you can only name five four or five congressmen that if the founders were
[3:01:39.480 --> 3:01:42.720]  to come back they would speak to he's one of the few that they would have
[3:01:42.720 --> 3:01:47.680]  respect for so you think he's founding father caliber or they would just talk
[3:01:47.680 --> 3:01:53.640]  to him I think they would talk to him that that is you know most most
[3:01:53.640 --> 3:02:00.840]  congressmen they have utter contempt for the Constitution United States and the
[3:02:00.840 --> 3:02:07.000]  moral principles that were the bedrock at our founding and when I say that a lot
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:10.280]  of people say well what what are you talking about well if you if you read
[3:02:10.280 --> 3:02:15.000]  through the Constitution they the government that the founders gave the
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:19.640]  government the Congress 21 things to do and it's listed in article one section
[3:02:19.640 --> 3:02:23.360]  of the United States Constitution and it's not there they can't do it and to
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:28.120]  give you an idea how far we strayed James Madison whose they acknowledge
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:34.160]  father of the Constitution he said in 1794 when Congress appropriated $15,000
[3:02:34.160 --> 3:02:38.680]  to help some French refugees he said and I'm virtually quoting him and all these
[3:02:38.680 --> 3:02:43.960]  quotes are available on my website at waltywilliams.com he says I cannot
[3:02:43.960 --> 3:02:48.760]  undertake to lay my finger on that article in the Constitution that allows
[3:02:48.760 --> 3:02:54.040]  Congress to take the money of their constituents for the purposes of the
[3:02:54.040 --> 3:02:59.360]  benevolence now if you look at the federal budget today two-thirds or
[3:02:59.360 --> 3:03:04.480]  three-quarters of it is for the purpose of benevolence that is the major function
[3:03:04.480 --> 3:03:09.960]  of the United States Congress today is that of taking the rightful property of
[3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:15.280]  one American and giving it to another American to whom it does not belong now
[3:03:15.280 --> 3:03:21.960]  I'm talking about farm subsidies business bailouts food stamps welfare
[3:03:21.960 --> 3:03:26.560]  prescription drugs you just name it on and on Congress is engaged in
[3:03:26.560 --> 3:03:31.160]  Congress is engaged in what if you and I did it we go to jail that is taking the
[3:03:31.160 --> 3:03:35.200]  property one person and giving it to another if nothing more than legalized
[3:03:35.200 --> 3:03:40.640]  theft and now it becomes more and more obvious with government just running
[3:03:40.640 --> 3:03:45.120]  wild at every level isn't the government just becoming a gang with a flag with a
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:50.720]  bunch of enforcers you know they become a Congress and the White House and
[3:03:50.720 --> 3:03:55.120]  they've been this way for a long time is just escalated recently they're just a
[3:03:55.120 --> 3:04:02.040]  group of folks well there's no doubt of that I mean we see all these reports
[3:04:02.040 --> 3:04:05.920]  where Congress is exempt for most the laws they pass on us is it that one of
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:10.440]  the hallmarks of tyranny well that is the absolute right that is what what
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:16.360]  people talk about rule of law and equality for the law it means that the
[3:04:16.360 --> 3:04:23.640]  same rules the same laws that you and I must obey also apply to people in
[3:04:23.640 --> 3:04:28.400]  government they must also obey them that is if something's immoral for you and
[3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:33.960]  I to do it's immoral for government to do amazing we got 25 minutes left with

[3:07:56.720 --> 3:08:03.760]  t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[3:08:05.840 --> 3:08:11.760]  well he is a professor of economics best-selling author nationally syndicated
[3:08:11.760 --> 3:08:17.400]  radio talk show host in his part time and the syndicated columnist Walter E
[3:08:17.400 --> 3:08:22.120]  Williams dot com is latest column out today as Americans love government but
[3:08:22.120 --> 3:08:24.600]  I was making the point during the break to him isn't that because we've been
[3:08:24.600 --> 3:08:28.120]  domesticated brought up in it not knowing how good it is without this
[3:08:28.120 --> 3:08:31.400]  giant government and people don't know that in every case in history government
[3:08:31.400 --> 3:08:37.720]  grows till it destroys the society can you speak to that sir? Yes I can that is
[3:08:37.720 --> 3:08:41.240]  if you look if you look at the federal government now has a percentage of our
[3:08:41.240 --> 3:08:47.120]  GDP the federal government spends something like 22 percent of our GDP
[3:08:47.120 --> 3:08:53.160]  and state and local governments spend up to I think the total amount goes to
[3:08:53.160 --> 3:09:00.160]  near 40% of the GDP is spent by government in our country now from 1787 the
[3:09:00.160 --> 3:09:07.560]  inception of our nation from 1787 until the 1920s the federal government spent
[3:09:07.560 --> 3:09:14.840]  only 3% of the GDP except during wartime and the state and local government
[3:09:14.840 --> 3:09:21.320]  spent around nine percent of the GDP and so for making for a total of 12% of the
[3:09:21.320 --> 3:09:26.880]  GDP as opposed to close to 40% is was being spent by government and keep in
[3:09:26.880 --> 3:09:34.680]  mind that in 1787 we were a third world nation and by 1920 we were the one we
[3:09:34.680 --> 3:09:38.640]  were the most powerful nation on the face of earth and we were rich that is we
[3:09:38.640 --> 3:09:45.000]  went through this whole interval without a big government and it turns it and it
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:47.880]  turns out something else that's significant that Americans just plain
[3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:53.080]  don't know is that the idea that Congress and the White House should be
[3:09:53.080 --> 3:09:59.240]  involved with the economy stimulating the economy new deal this is a new idea
[3:09:59.240 --> 3:10:05.160]  that is we've we've had recessions and depressions that went from one year to
[3:10:05.160 --> 3:10:10.440]  seven years from throughout our whole history and matter of fact in 1920 there
[3:10:10.440 --> 3:10:15.240]  was a sharp very sharp downturn in the economy there was no government program
[3:10:15.240 --> 3:10:21.120]  and we went off after that in 1922 we went through the roaring twenties in the
[3:10:21.120 --> 3:10:26.960]  1790 there was a great depression matter of fact it was I think like seven years
[3:10:26.960 --> 3:10:31.360]  and there was no government program now the government programs that deal with
[3:10:31.360 --> 3:10:37.800]  recessions came when there's a sharp turn down the economy in 1929 1930 and the
[3:10:37.800 --> 3:10:42.920]  Hoover administration started the government programs and can Roosevelt
[3:10:42.920 --> 3:10:48.160]  just follow on with it with a new deal and made and they what they did they
[3:10:48.160 --> 3:10:54.080]  turn what would have been in 1930 what would have been at the maximum of three
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:10:59.200]  years sharp downturn in the economy they turned it into a 16-year affair that is
[3:10:59.200 --> 3:11:06.080]  the great depression was not over until 1946 and Japan has now 12 13 years doing
[3:11:06.080 --> 3:11:10.840]  the same thing and I'm studying those panics as they called them in those
[3:11:10.840 --> 3:11:17.160]  depressions they were much shorter they were much more localized back before
[3:11:17.160 --> 3:11:20.160]  the Federal Reserve back before government got involved back before
[3:11:20.160 --> 3:11:24.560]  private interest got involved with government in this unholy alliance and
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:27.280]  they promised we'll never have another run on the bank we'll never have another
[3:11:27.280 --> 3:11:34.360]  recession or depression and then 1913 to 1929 they then take that depression and
[3:11:34.360 --> 3:11:38.920]  just exacerbate it with all the price controls and the rest of you absolutely
[3:11:38.920 --> 3:11:43.080]  and and you want to rather market the current set of problems that we face
[3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:50.800]  now is a direct result of Congress that is I always suggest people that the
[3:11:50.800 --> 3:11:56.600]  fundamentals of the American economy are and even now still reasonably sound
[3:11:56.600 --> 3:12:01.160]  we have this huge problem in the financial sector the financial sector is
[3:12:01.160 --> 3:12:05.240]  a big problem and it's affecting some other parts of the economy but
[3:12:05.240 --> 3:12:11.360]  Congress is the cause of the problems in the financial sector particularly those
[3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:17.160]  that stem from the subprime loans and the and the housing market it's been
[3:12:17.160 --> 3:12:22.280]  enabling it and demanding it and prodding it all along and then now is
[3:12:22.280 --> 3:12:28.000]  enabling it further just 14.8 trillion in seven months the Bloomberg reported I
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  mean my god that's that's more than the GDP in seven months that's right and the
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:36.960]  American people let me it's it I don't know what to say about my fellow
[3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:43.640]  Americans but they're asking Congress to come and help us out to change things
[3:12:43.640 --> 3:12:49.360]  that is it I mean to do to ask Congress to help us that's very much like seeing
[3:12:49.360 --> 3:12:54.200]  a building on fire and you calling the Arsons who set it on fire to help you
[3:12:54.200 --> 3:12:59.200]  put it out the same thing and and Congress is is the cause of the cause
[3:12:59.200 --> 3:13:02.960]  of the problem and and you know what and what what gets me about the I called
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:08.160]  stupidity of Americans or either the ignorance of Americans is that and
[3:13:08.160 --> 3:13:13.440]  Congress messed up you this current state affairs was a result of Congress
[3:13:13.440 --> 3:13:18.760]  trying to give us and the White House trying to give us affordable housing now
[3:13:18.760 --> 3:13:24.000]  we're asking Congress to give us affordable health care well it's
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:25.080]  unbelievable
[3:13:25.080 --> 3:13:30.160]  Bloomberg reported that nine point three trillion would pay off all the mortgages
[3:13:30.160 --> 3:13:35.440]  in the country so it's fourteen point eight so far mm-hmm where is all the
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:39.960]  money going I mean this is ridiculous and they're admitting now that it's
[3:13:39.960 --> 3:13:43.720]  driven up mortgage prices because the banks have got all this money they're
[3:13:43.720 --> 3:13:47.360]  just wanting to hoard it or to buy up other banks oh that's right and and see
[3:13:47.360 --> 3:13:51.280]  what what Congress should do you know what you what should happen is that
[3:13:51.280 --> 3:13:55.920]  people who got in overhead in the in the in the housing market they bought
[3:13:55.920 --> 3:13:59.440]  houses they cannot afford they should lose the house and they should they
[3:13:59.440 --> 3:14:03.440]  should be foreclosed on that is if you you know I think it was the Herbert
[3:14:03.440 --> 3:14:08.040]  Spencer said I believe was him it could have been somebody else that it if you
[3:14:08.040 --> 3:14:13.280]  protect people from the folly of their ways you create a nation of fools and
[3:14:13.280 --> 3:14:16.520]  that's what we're doing we're protecting people from their folly and
[3:14:16.520 --> 3:14:23.200]  therefore creating a nation of fools and and see see the problem is is that too
[3:14:23.200 --> 3:14:29.320]  many of us want to blame of politicians for our problems and yes we can blame
[3:14:29.320 --> 3:14:35.600]  politicians just a little bit but the bulk of the blame lies with the American
[3:14:35.600 --> 3:14:40.520]  people that is because politicians are doing precisely what American people
[3:14:40.520 --> 3:14:45.600]  elect them to office to do and what do we elect them to office to do we elect
[3:14:45.600 --> 3:14:50.520]  them to office to use the power of their office to take the property of one
[3:14:50.520 --> 3:14:56.040]  American and give it to us now let's shift gears let's shift gears sir into
[3:14:56.040 --> 3:15:00.760]  Barack Obama clearly George Bush size of government triples I thought that was
[3:15:00.760 --> 3:15:06.520]  bad now under Obama he's doubling the government yeah in one year if you
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:12.680]  project that out 10 times by the time he leaves office or or or or or even more
[3:15:12.680 --> 3:15:17.560]  so specifically sir I don't know whether that's sustainable but surely
[3:15:17.560 --> 3:15:21.560]  that's what he's doing and that's what the American people want that's what they
[3:15:21.560 --> 3:15:25.680]  want that look if you if you doubt what I'm saying what the American people want
[3:15:25.680 --> 3:15:31.480]  let me ask question now suppose I Walter Williams was running for the United
[3:15:31.480 --> 3:15:37.160]  States Senate from Texas and I go back and forth across the state of Texas
[3:15:37.160 --> 3:15:42.560]  down there my fellow Texans look I've read the United States Constitution I know
[3:15:42.560 --> 3:15:48.160]  what Congress is authorized to do and if you elect me to the Senate don't expect
[3:15:48.160 --> 3:15:53.160]  for me to bring back aid to higher education funds highway construction
[3:15:53.160 --> 3:15:59.360]  funds prescription drugs meals on wheels do you think I would get elected to the
[3:15:59.360 --> 3:16:04.480]  Senate from Texas no because maybe in Texas but in other states no because
[3:16:04.480 --> 3:16:08.760]  they don't understand the feds take a dollar of our money send 30 cents back
[3:16:08.760 --> 3:16:14.280]  with strings attached but you know that here's the problem Alex is that the
[3:16:14.280 --> 3:16:20.200]  people of Texas would be absolutely right not electing anybody who respect
[3:16:20.200 --> 3:16:23.640]  the United States Constituent Constitution to the United States Senate
[3:16:23.640 --> 3:16:28.640]  the reason why is that for example if I am the senator and I don't bring back
[3:16:28.640 --> 3:16:32.800]  billions of dollars to Texans that doesn't mean that Texans will pay a lower
[3:16:32.800 --> 3:16:37.360]  federal income tax exactly that it means is that Oklahoma will get it instead
[3:16:37.360 --> 3:16:43.680]  that is once legalized theft begins yes for everybody to participate oh that's
[3:16:43.680 --> 3:16:46.920]  a great point I hadn't thought of that that's what Ron Paul is always saying
[3:16:46.920 --> 3:16:51.680]  they say he's a hypocrite because he votes against the bills but then the
[3:16:51.680 --> 3:16:55.680]  spending bills but once the money comes in he says look I'm gonna earmark this
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:17:00.680]  because the money was spent I mean now you're paying these taxes you don't want
[3:17:00.680 --> 3:17:05.160]  it to come back for the shrimp fisheries of the of the Gulf Coast I mean I
[3:17:05.160 --> 3:17:09.720]  represent the Gulf Coast and so if I don't take this earmark it's gonna it's
[3:17:09.720 --> 3:17:13.680]  gonna go to foreign aid or something that that is that is that's right so so
[3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:19.560]  what it it makes people who are otherwise be moral they become immoral
[3:17:19.560 --> 3:17:23.640]  that is because if you're if you don't participate in the legalized theft
[3:17:23.640 --> 3:17:28.440]  you're going to wind up holding the brown end of the stick if you get what I
[3:17:28.440 --> 3:17:34.800]  mean wow amazing sir I mean you've been around a while you've made a lot of
[3:17:34.800 --> 3:17:39.080]  predictions I've seen come true what do you see happening with Obama with his
[3:17:39.080 --> 3:17:42.600]  false hope he knows government healthcare ain't gonna work he knows
[3:17:42.600 --> 3:17:48.680]  trillion spent is just gonna down the road make things even worse I mean I
[3:17:48.680 --> 3:17:51.160]  guess the special interest want all this money and they're the ones that put him
[3:17:51.160 --> 3:17:54.920]  in office but how do you see this ending with Barack Obama and all these
[3:17:54.920 --> 3:17:58.520]  people that followed him and believe he's really gonna give him a free house give
[3:17:58.520 --> 3:18:02.440]  him a free car you know people you see on TV saying all my problems are solved
[3:18:02.440 --> 3:18:09.400]  because Obama you know I I don't know what to what to I can I I don't know
[3:18:09.400 --> 3:18:14.600]  what to predict but however the current state of affairs is unsustainable I
[3:18:14.600 --> 3:18:19.440]  mean just one aspect to get about the the the health care and all this other
[3:18:19.440 --> 3:18:25.160]  spending it turns out that the unfunded liability of Social Security and
[3:18:25.160 --> 3:18:32.360]  Medicare is a hundred and one trillion dollars now what that means when I say
[3:18:32.360 --> 3:18:37.320]  unfunded liability and even the Social Security administration's report they
[3:18:37.320 --> 3:18:42.040]  say it's unfunded liability that's huge under one trillion dollars what that
[3:18:42.040 --> 3:18:47.680]  means is that in order for Congress to make good on the promises it's already
[3:18:47.680 --> 3:18:53.080]  made to people who are living today in terms of Medicare and and Social Security
[3:18:53.080 --> 3:18:58.960]  they would have to put trillions of dollars in the bank today earning a at
[3:18:58.960 --> 3:19:03.440]  least a six percent rate of interest in order to make good for it and this is not
[3:19:03.440 --> 3:19:07.720]  going they're not going to do that and and according to some estimates such as
[3:19:07.720 --> 3:19:13.240]  the National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas, Texas they point out that by
[3:19:13.240 --> 3:19:18.640]  2040 I believe something like you know given the current state of affairs if
[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:24.800]  it continues the way it's going now that 80 percent of the federal budget will be
[3:19:24.800 --> 3:19:33.160]  spent on Social Security and Medicare amazing 80 percent let's talk more
[3:19:33.160 --> 3:19:36.520]  about that in our final segment with Walter E. Williams, waltrywilliams.com

[3:23:53.640 --> 3:24:06.240]  today Walter E. Williams is our guest we had a bizarre power outage here in the
[3:24:06.240 --> 3:24:10.640]  studio we're on backup we'll see if we can stay on the air here together mr.
[3:24:10.640 --> 3:24:15.640]  Williams continuing GM the trillions of the banks and the government's now
[3:24:15.640 --> 3:24:19.080]  saying they're just gonna expand and intensify all of this are they gonna
[3:24:19.080 --> 3:24:23.360]  just continue to dump money on this until they completely destroy us or how
[3:24:23.360 --> 3:24:28.320]  do you see this unfolding well I I don't know I think a lot of things that
[3:24:28.320 --> 3:24:32.920]  they're doing is unsustainable but I think that the the whole idea but about
[3:24:32.920 --> 3:24:38.600]  Detroit and and GM and other companies going bankrupt I think that people don't
[3:24:38.600 --> 3:24:42.640]  quite understand what bankruptcy means if but if they did I don't think they
[3:24:42.640 --> 3:24:46.840]  would let government get away with what they're doing that is it's almost when
[3:24:46.840 --> 3:24:50.000]  you hear people talk you know when they if the airline goes bankrupt or if a
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:55.240]  auto company goes bankrupt it they people think as they talk as if the
[3:24:55.240 --> 3:24:59.560]  company the productive assets are going to go puff and disappear into thin air
[3:24:59.560 --> 3:25:02.600]  like if the airline went bankrupt the airlines are going to go puff and
[3:25:02.600 --> 3:25:07.080]  disappear into thin air or the assembly line Detroit will go puff no what
[3:25:07.080 --> 3:25:11.600]  bankruptcy means is that there's a change in the title to those assets
[3:25:11.600 --> 3:25:16.520]  somebody else will own those assets if it ultimately be goes goes bankrupt but
[3:25:16.520 --> 3:25:20.280]  there's intermediate step they can go to chapter 11 first but the point is is
[3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:24.880]  that when government fails at companies they're telling them keep on doing
[3:25:24.880 --> 3:25:28.880]  what you're doing see the important thing about a market system is that
[3:25:28.880 --> 3:25:34.600]  failure business failure is just as critical to the operational or market
[3:25:34.600 --> 3:25:39.880]  system as business success that is business success says you're doing the
[3:25:39.880 --> 3:25:42.880]  right thing you're please your customers and you're doing it in a reasonable
[3:25:42.880 --> 3:25:49.800]  way excuse me excuse me business failure means that you're not pleasing your
[3:25:49.800 --> 3:25:53.560]  customers or you're doing it in an inefficient way you're wasting resources
[3:25:53.560 --> 3:25:58.240]  of the society now when government steps into bail out a failing business it
[3:25:58.240 --> 3:26:03.840]  says it in effect says continue wasting the resources of society here's the
[3:26:03.840 --> 3:26:08.040]  money Americans won't buy your damn cars so here's some money we'll take some
[3:26:08.040 --> 3:26:13.720]  money from the Americans and give it to you well mr. Williams expanding on that
[3:26:13.720 --> 3:26:18.400]  the media keeps confusing this insane capitalism failed now we've got to have
[3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:22.400]  socialism with the cover of Newsweek that's a grand deception I've noticed
[3:26:22.400 --> 3:26:26.480]  they've been parroting as a talking point this isn't free market that did this
[3:26:26.480 --> 3:26:32.200]  this was the state merging with some type of crony insider corruption what do
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:36.920]  you call that how do you boil that down explain this is a bait and switch
[3:26:36.920 --> 3:26:42.000]  a crony capitalism and that is you know just give you one example we had this
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:47.600]  with with the housing market that we we had this community reinvestment act that
[3:26:47.600 --> 3:26:52.200]  intimidated banks into making loans that they otherwise would not have made now
[3:26:52.200 --> 3:26:57.400]  banks would not lend people to buy a house to buy a 200 500 thousand dollar
[3:26:57.400 --> 3:27:01.960]  house with no money down it required that government intimidate banks to do
[3:27:01.960 --> 3:27:06.440]  that that's not capitalism under a free market system a banker would not do that
[3:27:06.440 --> 3:27:11.400]  he will do it when the government says we want we want you to do it unless we're
[3:27:11.400 --> 3:27:15.600]  not we're not going to give you a merger and then plus if we had this Fannie Mae
[3:27:15.600 --> 3:27:20.040]  and Freddie Mac to buy the rotten paper that you sell and so it's not
[3:27:20.040 --> 3:27:25.920]  capitalism at all it's socialism that is failed but these the news media and
[3:27:25.920 --> 3:27:29.760]  politicians are doing a bait and switch
[3:27:30.680 --> 3:27:35.000]  they're deceiving the American people
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:39.960]  well mr. Williams I in the few minutes we have left with you what is your
[3:27:39.960 --> 3:27:43.200]  solution how do we get out of this just educate the public that it's a fraud
[3:27:43.200 --> 3:27:46.800]  because there are all these corrupt corporate interests that are not free
[3:27:46.800 --> 3:27:50.360]  market that are some of the biggest corporations in the world and they've
[3:27:50.360 --> 3:27:53.440]  made an alliance with corrupt government and then with the dumb down kind of
[3:27:53.440 --> 3:28:00.480]  howling mob as John Adams would call it I mean how do we deal with this I'm not
[3:28:00.480 --> 3:28:05.000]  sure I think that they we need to we can't deal with politicians there they're
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:09.040]  there they're hopeless in terms of respect for the Constitution what we
[3:28:09.040 --> 3:28:13.880]  have to do and I think that talk radio has been very very important on a lot
[3:28:13.880 --> 3:28:19.120]  number of the blogs have been very we have to somehow sell the American people
[3:28:19.120 --> 3:28:25.000]  on the moral superiority of individual liberty which means the limited
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:30.640]  government we have to sell the American people on individual responsibility we
[3:28:30.640 --> 3:28:34.880]  have to sell the American people that on the American are very generous and
[3:28:34.880 --> 3:28:41.360]  we have to tell people that look helping your fellow man in need is praise worthy
[3:28:41.360 --> 3:28:45.200]  and laudable when you reach into your own pockets to help them out when you
[3:28:45.200 --> 3:28:48.960]  reach into somebody else's pockets to help your fellow man in need that is
[3:28:48.960 --> 3:28:54.720]  worthy of condemnation and and it's despicable and and for the
[3:28:54.720 --> 3:28:58.920]  Christians among us we should recognize that when God gave Moses the
[3:28:58.920 --> 3:29:04.240]  commandment thou shalt not steal he did not mean thou shall not steal unless
[3:29:04.240 --> 3:29:09.520]  you've got a majority vote in Congress and moreover if yes good what is it
[3:29:09.520 --> 3:29:13.280]  okay to be a recipient of stolen property he would probably consider that
[3:29:13.280 --> 3:29:18.240]  a sin as well that is the big problems that we face in our society right now
[3:29:18.240 --> 3:29:24.320]  are moral problems and the big question is when does the stealing end the big
[3:29:24.320 --> 3:29:28.720]  question is if you accept any of this theft then the sky's the limit waltry

[3:34:04.240 --> 3:34:08.000]  for reloading could be sold to big companies and they're
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:11.520]  introduced all these bills totally in the second amendment as we know it
[3:34:11.520 --> 3:34:15.920]  this is all happening this is all real and it's just gonna
[3:34:15.920 --> 3:34:20.720]  incrementally continue but even though it's incremental the incrementalism is
[3:34:20.720 --> 3:34:29.520]  accelerating now it is in intensifying now it is
[3:34:29.520 --> 3:34:35.680]  expanding now and the question is as a society
[3:34:35.680 --> 3:34:40.080]  what are we going to do about this we have private outside banks
[3:34:40.080 --> 3:34:44.720]  that are having their way with the people as soon as ron paul gets on with us
[3:34:44.720 --> 3:34:48.400]  that's what we're going to discuss is the bill
[3:34:48.400 --> 3:34:51.840]  that he's introduced it's now got over 200 sponsors
[3:34:51.840 --> 3:34:55.280]  bill to audit fellow reserve now has 207 cosponsors
[3:34:55.280 --> 3:34:59.600]  new names being added every day momentum building for ron paul and the american
[3:34:59.600 --> 3:35:03.200]  people identifying the outside criminal organization
[3:35:03.200 --> 3:35:06.240]  the private bankers that have engineered the collapse that have taken over our
[3:35:06.240 --> 3:35:08.720]  society this is the new world order we have their
[3:35:08.720 --> 3:35:12.400]  minutes we have their documents we have it all we understand
[3:35:12.400 --> 3:35:15.520]  what they're doing and what they're setting up
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:21.760]  and what they are creating
[3:35:23.200 --> 3:35:26.720]  bill to audit fellow reserve now has 207 cosponsors
[3:35:26.720 --> 3:35:30.080]  new names being added every day momentum building for the american people
[3:35:30.080 --> 3:35:33.280]  thanks to ron paul and all of your phone calls to congress all the letters to
[3:35:33.280 --> 3:35:37.600]  congress at a time of writing a bill that would
[3:35:37.600 --> 3:35:40.720]  see the federal reserve bank audited for the first time 59 years
[3:35:40.720 --> 3:35:44.720]  has 207 cosponsors in the house and is gaining traction
[3:35:44.720 --> 3:35:48.720]  with every single day now we've seen numbers of 200s what we confirm
[3:35:48.720 --> 3:35:52.640]  daily paul saying 207 we can talk to the man himself
[3:35:52.640 --> 3:35:55.600]  congressman ron paul the hardest-working man in congress
[3:35:55.600 --> 3:35:59.680]  dr ron paul hailing from texas i'm so honored to be a texan with him
[3:35:59.680 --> 3:36:05.120]  uh congressman how many sponsors does it really have well it's actually 209
[3:36:05.120 --> 3:36:08.640]  right now yeah you heard it here first 209
[3:36:08.640 --> 3:36:12.080]  so we have to almost check minute by minute and they're coming in faster and
[3:36:12.080 --> 3:36:16.080]  easier now and uh the percentage of the new
[3:36:16.080 --> 3:36:20.560]  uh people are democrats because a lot of the republicans are already on so
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:23.920]  it is spreading i think the people at the grassroots have done the job that they
[3:36:23.920 --> 3:36:29.120]  need to do and when we feel really depressed about how
[3:36:29.120 --> 3:36:34.240]  slow congress works we do have a system that will respond if we wake up enough
[3:36:34.240 --> 3:36:37.920]  people but that's the tough job but it it they will respond when they hear from
[3:36:37.920 --> 3:36:42.240]  the people congressman how long have you worked to get
[3:36:42.240 --> 3:36:45.280]  this many sponsors i mean you've been introducing this bill for a decade
[3:36:45.280 --> 3:36:48.480]  haven't you yes it's been probably ever since i've
[3:36:48.480 --> 3:36:51.280]  been in congress i don't know if i've ever skipped any but
[3:36:51.280 --> 3:36:55.760]  there's never been any uh general support from the public but because of
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:36:59.520]  the financial crisis because of the presidential campaign the interest in
[3:36:59.520 --> 3:37:02.080]  the federal reserve all of a sudden to come together
[3:37:02.080 --> 3:37:05.520]  uh so this is by far the uh most interest
[3:37:05.520 --> 3:37:08.880]  uh that we've had and and quite frankly i think it's the most interest
[3:37:08.880 --> 3:37:13.120]  anybody's ever had since the federal reserve has been established in 1913
[3:37:13.120 --> 3:37:16.560]  because you know even though the fed contributed significantly if they didn't
[3:37:16.560 --> 3:37:19.360]  cause the whole depression of the 20s of the 30s
[3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:23.680]  nobody was calling for you know auditing the fed and abolishing the fed
[3:37:23.680 --> 3:37:27.440]  today those are routine chance that we hear
[3:37:27.440 --> 3:37:31.600]  and therefore i think we're making great progress only because they've
[3:37:31.600 --> 3:37:35.440]  created such a chaotic mess that we're dealing with well we'll have to change
[3:37:35.440 --> 3:37:38.240]  the headline at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[3:37:38.240 --> 3:37:42.240]  to 209 from congressman ron paul so you heard it here
[3:37:42.240 --> 3:37:46.080]  first sir i don't want listeners to blink or viewers to blink
[3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:51.360]  because they may miss history i don't think even our own movement realizes
[3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:55.040]  the gravity of the fact that it looks like
[3:37:55.040 --> 3:37:58.720]  this bill has a good chance of passing if you get another 10 or so
[3:37:58.720 --> 3:38:02.160]  sponsors and the federal reserve has hired lobbyists to try to block this
[3:38:02.160 --> 3:38:06.320]  their arrogance their veneer of invincibility their cloak of invincibility
[3:38:06.320 --> 3:38:09.520]  is falling away people see that they can be be
[3:38:09.520 --> 3:38:14.160]  they see that they are not above the law it's viral videos with the former fed
[3:38:14.160 --> 3:38:17.520]  chairman and current fed chairman saying they're above the law and no one can
[3:38:17.520 --> 3:38:21.440]  look into them and no agency of government of the three branches can
[3:38:21.440 --> 3:38:26.400]  that is asinine on its face for even an uneducated uninformed public
[3:38:26.400 --> 3:38:31.040]  on our system of government and so i just want to get your take on
[3:38:31.040 --> 3:38:34.000]  uh... what is it like for you to know you're the leader
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:37.280]  of something that is so amazingly historical because even if they somehow
[3:38:37.280 --> 3:38:40.400]  beat this this time then the question is
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:45.840]  how were we not able to audit you and so you can see that the momentum
[3:38:45.840 --> 3:38:49.840]  has changed in the pendulum is really shifting i sense
[3:38:49.840 --> 3:38:53.840]  destiny of the level of 1776 here sir
[3:38:53.840 --> 3:38:57.440]  i think there's no doubt about they can't put the g back in the bottle
[3:38:57.440 --> 3:39:02.320]  because uh... the the odds are still you know if the about
[3:39:02.320 --> 3:39:07.360]  uh... where this is going to go i mean there's the powers to be have a lot of
[3:39:07.360 --> 3:39:11.280]  uh... a lot of tools that they can use conference committees may they might
[3:39:11.280 --> 3:39:16.000]  block it in the senate uh... they can do all sorts of things
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:21.280]  uh... so i remain cautiously optimistic because i know it has a long way to go
[3:39:21.280 --> 3:39:26.240]  but the issue will not be quieted down i mean the issue is out there
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:31.840]  and uh... if you know in in some ways if they we have all this attention in this
[3:39:31.840 --> 3:39:35.520]  bill and we get the majority in the congress to endorse it and it
[3:39:35.520 --> 3:39:39.360]  never gets out and never goes anyway it's proof positive
[3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:43.440]  that we really need to do it with them that means it'll be that much
[3:39:43.440 --> 3:39:48.880]  greater to get a handle on all this so i think we win either way because we've
[3:39:48.880 --> 3:39:51.760]  gotten the attention of such a large number of people
[3:39:51.760 --> 3:39:56.080]  it's not uh... only the very very hardcore constitutionalist
[3:39:56.080 --> 3:40:00.320]  because the grassroots are talking to the very average republican the very
[3:40:00.320 --> 3:40:03.040]  average democrat the moderate the liberal the progressive
[3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:07.360]  and they're all joining it the issue really here is reigning in government
[3:40:07.360 --> 3:40:11.760]  and transparency uh... we should not be fooled into believing
[3:40:11.760 --> 3:40:15.680]  that they have a strong belief in the monetary policies
[3:40:15.680 --> 3:40:19.680]  that we might want i mean they're not all gold standard people or anything else
[3:40:19.680 --> 3:40:23.680]  which driving this is that the congress has created a mess
[3:40:23.680 --> 3:40:26.320]  the federal reserve has been doing a lot secretly
[3:40:26.320 --> 3:40:29.920]  and american people want to know what's happening because they've seen too many
[3:40:29.920 --> 3:40:33.840]  special interest bailed out knowing by congress and the treasury but by the
[3:40:33.840 --> 3:40:38.160]  federal reserve as well and they're demanding answers
[3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:41.280]  congressman uh... in the twelve minutes or so we have left with you i've got so
[3:40:41.280 --> 3:40:43.840]  many important questions concerning this
[3:40:43.840 --> 3:40:49.600]  how do we explain to some of the public out there that this is all a process of
[3:40:49.600 --> 3:40:52.640]  liberty tyranny wasn't born overnight
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:40:55.920]  in this country and liberty isn't going to take back over
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:40:59.360]  overnight it's a constant battle between those two
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:03.600]  title forces as you know but if people said oh ron paul didn't win so boo who i
[3:41:03.600 --> 3:41:07.600]  said no it built this giant movement now the biggest thing on campus isn't
[3:41:07.600 --> 3:41:11.600]  liberal or fake conservative it's libertarian it's freedom it's
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:15.840]  constitutionalist and now people are finally seeing that a year later
[3:41:15.840 --> 3:41:21.200]  that it's building in strength uh... and that it's a process
[3:41:21.200 --> 3:41:25.280]  that even as you just said even if they defeated this time
[3:41:25.280 --> 3:41:30.320]  then people say well why can't we audit it it's almost better if they do
[3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:34.800]  uh... engage in chicanery and pull out the stops and beat at this time
[3:41:34.800 --> 3:41:37.600]  because then everybody's gonna want to know what they're hiding
[3:41:37.600 --> 3:41:42.480]  yep that's exactly right and uh... that'll just energize our our group of
[3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:45.520]  young people especially even even more so
[3:41:45.520 --> 3:41:49.840]  but uh... i think it's an issue whose time has come and uh... it's not going to
[3:41:49.840 --> 3:41:52.880]  go away uh... and uh... i don't know if you saw
[3:41:52.880 --> 3:41:57.520]  jim grants quote today on on the business station but uh...
[3:41:57.520 --> 3:42:02.160]  he said that if we ever got that auditing bill passed that it would be
[3:42:02.160 --> 3:42:06.080]  a declaration that the uh... total reserve is in a lot worse shape than any of
[3:42:06.080 --> 3:42:09.440]  the banks that went bankrupt but the technically you know in
[3:42:09.440 --> 3:42:13.280]  in conventional terms the federal reserve does not have the assets all
[3:42:13.280 --> 3:42:17.520]  they have are credits and and obviously that's what we would expect
[3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:21.200]  but uh... that would that goes to prove why
[3:42:21.200 --> 3:42:25.120]  uh... they can't be the salvation of this country i mean just kind of fitting
[3:42:25.120 --> 3:42:28.400]  money and doing mischief and serving the interests
[3:42:28.400 --> 3:42:32.560]  uh... of their friends that they can't work i think it's going to come to an end
[3:42:32.560 --> 3:42:35.120]  whether we win this legislative victory or not
[3:42:35.120 --> 3:42:38.240]  because their system is deeply flawed ultimately
[3:42:38.240 --> 3:42:44.160]  i think the solution comes uh... if we're well prepared to offer it up
[3:42:44.160 --> 3:42:48.000]  uh... when the system totally collapses the financial structure
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:51.680]  has come unglued but the uh... the dollar still
[3:42:51.680 --> 3:42:55.520]  is the dollar still works to a degree you know people still are buying dollars
[3:42:55.520 --> 3:42:58.480]  and they don't know what to do with them but when they get discouraged they
[3:42:58.480 --> 3:43:01.760]  don't hold dollars anymore and then they start buying up hard assets they're
[3:43:01.760 --> 3:43:04.800]  starting to buy oil now more than a month or so ago
[3:43:04.800 --> 3:43:09.440]  and they continue to buy gold and you know china continues to buy gold i mean
[3:43:09.440 --> 3:43:14.000]  not there's a lot of things but the end stages of a situation like this goes
[3:43:14.000 --> 3:43:17.360]  very very rapidly what the sentiment changes
[3:43:17.360 --> 3:43:21.040]  just like when the financial system collapsed uh... everybody rushed to
[3:43:21.040 --> 3:43:23.520]  dollars and interest rates went down to one percent
[3:43:23.520 --> 3:43:27.200]  along with what the fed was doing but uh... uh...
[3:43:27.200 --> 3:43:32.240]  when a currency crisis hit people want a holy man let's get out of the dollar
[3:43:32.240 --> 3:43:35.600]  and then you'll see the fireworks then we have to be prepared
[3:43:35.600 --> 3:43:38.400]  to say don't just give us a u n central bank
[3:43:38.400 --> 3:43:41.840]  i mean the the international planners are
[3:43:41.840 --> 3:43:45.280]  they know what we know and they're making their plans they know their days
[3:43:45.280 --> 3:43:50.800]  are numbered but the contest is between totalitarianism and liberty and
[3:43:50.800 --> 3:43:55.840]  and uh... whoever uh... wants to totalitarian approach has to have
[3:43:55.840 --> 3:43:59.360]  uh... government monopolized money and that's what we have to stop
[3:43:59.360 --> 3:44:02.560]  in your gut and we all know what the gut is it's thousands of pieces of data
[3:44:02.560 --> 3:44:05.840]  integrated in and the mind comes up with a prime projection
[3:44:05.840 --> 3:44:10.800]  in your gut congressman do you agree with me that in the last two months
[3:44:10.800 --> 3:44:15.360]  we were about to get the title shift or the flip to our side but
[3:44:15.360 --> 3:44:18.880]  i can almost spiritually feel it at a dna level
[3:44:18.880 --> 3:44:22.400]  that the shift has happened toward our way yes
[3:44:22.400 --> 3:44:26.480]  well when i'm out of washington i have two perspectives you know uh...
[3:44:26.480 --> 3:44:30.720]  when i go to a college campus and you're you represent talk to people
[3:44:30.720 --> 3:44:33.520]  outside of washington and there should be reason why
[3:44:33.520 --> 3:44:37.600]  you're seeing signs of optimism i come up here every single day right now
[3:44:37.600 --> 3:44:40.240]  we're dealing with the estate department
[3:44:40.240 --> 3:44:44.400]  uh... authorization bill is atrocious you know the eighteen
[3:44:44.400 --> 3:44:48.400]  billion dollars and more mischief and more militarism
[3:44:48.400 --> 3:44:52.320]  and uh... republicans this time are going to oppose it but it's just a
[3:44:52.320 --> 3:44:54.880]  partisan thing but it'll go sailing right through
[3:44:54.880 --> 3:44:58.240]  so you're saying there's two different worlds and more and more
[3:44:58.240 --> 3:45:01.760]  it's getting separated and that golf is widening right in like
[3:45:01.760 --> 3:45:05.440]  like this week and i just got off the floor i gave my all two minutes and i
[3:45:05.440 --> 3:45:07.760]  said you know that our president has asked us
[3:45:07.760 --> 3:45:11.200]  to go with pay go pay the bills as you go along
[3:45:11.200 --> 3:45:14.960]  of course for the liberal that means raise taxes well how can they raise taxes
[3:45:14.960 --> 3:45:17.600]  that there's no no business out there
[3:45:17.600 --> 3:45:22.400]  uh... that that can pay but they're not going to pay for this if they're
[3:45:22.400 --> 3:45:26.000]  incapable and if they paid for it by cutting it and they want to spend all
[3:45:26.000 --> 3:45:29.840]  this money overseas they'd have to cut a domestic program which they're not
[3:45:29.840 --> 3:45:34.160]  going to do so the president's outside on the tv
[3:45:34.160 --> 3:45:37.680]  if people say well that does sound good on this president's not a radical
[3:45:37.680 --> 3:45:42.080]  spender he he wants to cut down and he wants to reign this in and he wants
[3:45:42.080 --> 3:45:45.840]  pay go and he says in two years from now we're gonna
[3:45:45.840 --> 3:45:49.840]  you know cut way back we'll deal with the problems later on and
[3:45:49.840 --> 3:45:53.200]  you know i think though our crowd is probably like
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:45:57.280]  young people around the world think of those young people in china
[3:45:57.280 --> 3:46:00.720]  when geithner goes over there and says oh yeah we're going to get things under
[3:46:00.720 --> 3:46:04.000]  control and we're going to reign back our spending
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:07.280]  and those students just laugh at them well i imagine
[3:46:07.280 --> 3:46:11.360]  there's a lot of students around the country and a lot of other people now
[3:46:11.360 --> 3:46:14.880]  who just laugh at us up here in washington
[3:46:14.880 --> 3:46:18.080]  but the people here in washington are still in charge
[3:46:18.080 --> 3:46:21.760]  and we haven't converted them and we're just seeing
[3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:26.480]  signs of it that it's possible when we can get 209 people to support an
[3:46:26.480 --> 3:46:30.720]  auditing bill so we just have to do our best and
[3:46:30.720 --> 3:46:34.720]  see what happens see if see if the calamity hits us before
[3:46:34.720 --> 3:46:39.440]  we can make some calm deliberate decisions that make some changes
[3:46:39.440 --> 3:46:43.520]  but yes is that we'll have the crisis before we could do that
[3:46:43.520 --> 3:46:47.520]  absolutely things are certainly deepening when do you see the next big
[3:46:47.520 --> 3:46:52.560]  plunge down more deeper into this globally engineered depression
[3:46:52.560 --> 3:46:55.920]  well i think uh i think it's really going down now but the government
[3:46:55.920 --> 3:47:00.160]  statistics sort of are giving people a false sense of security so i think
[3:47:00.160 --> 3:47:04.240]  we're still slipping but there's there will be more announcements and more
[3:47:04.240 --> 3:47:07.840]  bankruptcies and and probably more commercial property
[3:47:07.840 --> 3:47:12.000]  problems and more states going bankrupted more unemployment
[3:47:12.000 --> 3:47:17.120]  then finally the euphoria on wall street of the last four months is a
[3:47:17.120 --> 3:47:22.080]  dissipation and that'll feed into a lot of disappointments but you know
[3:47:22.080 --> 3:47:25.680]  even though wall street has done a little bit better by these prices going up a
[3:47:25.680 --> 3:47:28.240]  little bit i don't think the average guy out there
[3:47:28.240 --> 3:47:31.680]  that's lost his job has started to feel any better yet
[3:47:31.680 --> 3:47:34.880]  uh and then i was impressed the other day that
[3:47:34.880 --> 3:47:40.080]  some of the news media have reported that the real rate of unemployment
[3:47:40.080 --> 3:47:44.640]  isn't nine percent it's like 18 percent you know when you add up all the people
[3:47:44.640 --> 3:47:49.200]  who don't look for jobs anymore or who work a couple hours a week so
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:53.440]  it's a very serious problem and exactly the mainstream media is now having to
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:55.920]  admit more and more that the government is lying and spending
[3:47:55.920 --> 3:47:59.360]  because they want to keep some credibility sir i want to specifically
[3:47:59.360 --> 3:48:03.200]  ask you in the time we have left how do we help you get
[3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:10.400]  this bill passed how do we help you get hr 1207 that has 209 sponsors now
[3:48:10.400 --> 3:48:15.040]  uh as of uh june 10th 2009 on this wednesday edition
[3:48:15.040 --> 3:48:18.960]  what can we do to get this pass what can we do
[3:48:18.960 --> 3:48:22.480]  because going back to you and mckinney roughs when you gave a speech
[3:48:22.480 --> 3:48:26.000]  after i did five years ago it's in my film matrix of evil
[3:48:26.000 --> 3:48:30.320]  you talked about how the key was when the global crisis came in
[3:48:30.320 --> 3:48:36.000]  the establishment would try to use the crisis to bring in their bank of the
[3:48:36.000 --> 3:48:39.280]  world their world currency because you were reading the same global's documents
[3:48:39.280 --> 3:48:42.320]  i was yeah and then now it's all over the news and
[3:48:42.320 --> 3:48:45.440]  they're posing as the saviors and the public is going wait a minute you're
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:48.720]  the guys that did this so they are looking to you and others
[3:48:48.720 --> 3:48:51.520]  uh so there's this vacuum that's about to happen
[3:48:51.520 --> 3:48:55.440]  and i mean just speaking to the fact that as you always said when this happened
[3:48:55.440 --> 3:48:59.040]  we had to put in the maximum effort so we want to put in the maximum effort
[3:48:59.040 --> 3:49:02.720]  you're the general you're the george washington sir what do we do
[3:49:02.720 --> 3:49:06.560]  i think we just do more of what we're doing now and building our numbers i mean
[3:49:06.560 --> 3:49:09.440]  you have a large number of people that listen to you and you continue to do the
[3:49:09.440 --> 3:49:13.440]  things that you're best at now falling up from our campaign we
[3:49:13.440 --> 3:49:17.040]  started the campaign for liberty and that website helps bring people together
[3:49:17.040 --> 3:49:22.640]  and our numbers continue to grow but right now in a more specific way they
[3:49:22.640 --> 3:49:26.480]  need to go to campaign for liberty get the names of those who've signed on
[3:49:26.480 --> 3:49:30.480]  and find out exactly the congressman who have not
[3:49:30.480 --> 3:49:34.560]  and then instead of if your congressman has already signed on go
[3:49:34.560 --> 3:49:39.120]  go to the neighboring congressman and then you know and organize and find out
[3:49:39.120 --> 3:49:42.720]  where the meet-up group is and enlist these people on the internet
[3:49:42.720 --> 3:49:45.760]  and go to their office go i mean you could go shake their hand couldn't you
[3:49:45.760 --> 3:49:50.160]  yeah that's it thank you then and when the members come in
[3:49:50.160 --> 3:49:54.160]  and talk to me they say don't come up but they'll be very nice and they're just
[3:49:54.160 --> 3:49:57.200]  trying to do their job they what is this bill is the grassroots are all
[3:49:57.200 --> 3:49:59.920]  riled up about 1200 and something and i said
[3:49:59.920 --> 3:50:03.440]  well it has to do with transparency of the fed so we know what they're doing
[3:50:03.440 --> 3:50:08.880]  oh god for that then they sign on but they came to me not because they
[3:50:08.880 --> 3:50:12.640]  wanted to be on a ron paul bill but because the grassroots were telling
[3:50:12.640 --> 3:50:16.240]  him actually politically i have to take a little credit it is a
[3:50:16.240 --> 3:50:20.240]  little more popular being on a ron paul bill now than it used to be
[3:50:20.240 --> 3:50:23.440]  oh yeah you're out there setting you're out there setting bushfires the minds
[3:50:23.440 --> 3:50:26.160]  of men and women everywhere you've been introducing this
[3:50:26.160 --> 3:50:30.000]  what i mean i remember 10 12 years ago you'd get like five six sponsors for
[3:50:30.000 --> 3:50:33.760]  this it's changing now and it's politics i mean
[3:50:33.760 --> 3:50:37.600]  especially marginal democrats and marginal republicans when they need
[3:50:37.600 --> 3:50:42.720]  this 10 or 15 percent of the vote if somebody if it was a democrat in a
[3:50:42.720 --> 3:50:47.920]  republicansy boy they really want to pay attention to what i'm doing
[3:50:47.920 --> 3:50:52.720]  and congressman in congressman in closing i want to
[3:50:52.720 --> 3:50:56.800]  ask you two quick questions number one there's a there's a domino effect isn't
[3:50:56.800 --> 3:51:00.560]  there from what you've been doing because as you move to audit the fed
[3:51:00.560 --> 3:51:03.280]  other agencies and groups and governments start thinking
[3:51:03.280 --> 3:51:06.480]  here's a p today congress subpoenas the fed
[3:51:06.480 --> 3:51:09.920]  about where all the billions of dollars the bank of america went because they
[3:51:09.920 --> 3:51:13.120]  won't tell senator sanders and congressman paul and others you know
[3:51:13.120 --> 3:51:17.440]  yourself uh so again here's this idea of holding these guys
[3:51:17.440 --> 3:51:22.000]  accountable is starting to happen isn't it oh yeah it'll be contagious and uh
[3:51:22.000 --> 3:51:25.520]  that is that is very good and i think that uh
[3:51:25.520 --> 3:51:30.880]  fortunately we can get all political uh groups together
[3:51:30.880 --> 3:51:35.680]  on transparency and then then we can argue how well we want to do and uh
[3:51:35.680 --> 3:51:39.920]  and matter of fact barney frank has been helpful to me on this
[3:51:39.920 --> 3:51:43.520]  but he wanted to make sure i knew he i didn't he didn't agree with me on the
[3:51:43.520 --> 3:51:48.160]  ultimate monetary policy that's okay if they believe in transparency
[3:51:48.160 --> 3:51:51.680]  then open debate but i just strongly feel that
[3:51:51.680 --> 3:51:55.280]  if we get transparency of the fed and the people know what they've done
[3:51:55.280 --> 3:51:59.760]  i think their days are numbered well it's been said that an audit of the fed
[3:51:59.760 --> 3:52:03.760]  will abolish the fed because as soon as all the admitted criminality we can see
[3:52:03.760 --> 3:52:06.880]  them doing openly i mean what do you expect to find
[3:52:06.880 --> 3:52:12.640]  if we do get the okay ladies and gentlemen uh we rebroadcast part of
[3:52:12.640 --> 3:52:16.800]  the ron paul interview from a couple hours ago this is a good
[3:52:16.800 --> 3:52:22.480]  little drill for us in the new studio uh we have backup batteries
[3:52:22.480 --> 3:52:26.240]  here supposedly to run for a few hours but you notice they only did about 20
[3:52:26.240 --> 3:52:28.800]  minutes that's why some of our internet streams
[3:52:28.800 --> 3:52:33.120]  went down but that is a good beta test for us now
[3:52:33.120 --> 3:52:36.800]  we'd have a generator but those don't stay on roofs or outside offices for more
[3:52:36.800 --> 3:52:38.960]  than five minutes even if they're bolted down
[3:52:38.960 --> 3:52:42.960]  we're just going to get bigger bigger batteries here in the office
[3:52:42.960 --> 3:52:46.720]  in the next week or i guess i'll have to heads will roll or something
[3:52:46.720 --> 3:52:49.520]  and we're going to get a little generator in the studio so we can roll it
[3:52:49.520 --> 3:52:53.760]  outside when that does happen but all part of growing pains here i apologize
[3:52:53.760 --> 3:52:55.680]  we had to go to retransmission but it was
[3:52:55.680 --> 3:53:02.160]  hot breaking ron paul information uh from today
[3:53:02.160 --> 3:53:05.600]  and we will be rebooting the audio streams at info wars dot com and getting
[3:53:05.600 --> 3:53:08.800]  that restreaming for everybody that missed any of the first of the show

[3:53:24.080 --> 3:53:28.800]  which is absolutely vital to expand this radio show and buy the equipment we
[3:53:28.800 --> 3:53:32.240]  need and set up the bigger tv studio and get more video editors and
[3:53:32.240 --> 3:53:35.920]  up our output of viral films we put out for free
[3:53:35.920 --> 3:53:39.200]  we try to fund it all people buying the dvds but quite friendly that just didn't
[3:53:39.200 --> 3:53:41.920]  cutting it and people always are saying they want to donate so we want to
[3:53:41.920 --> 3:53:45.520]  commend all those of you out there that donated last year
[3:53:45.520 --> 3:53:48.560]  we want to ask folks to donate this year and to please spread the word today with
[3:53:48.560 --> 3:53:50.960]  the videos we've got posted promoting the money bomb
[3:53:50.960 --> 3:53:55.760]  i'm gonna send an email out today uh to a lot of our supporters in the past
[3:53:55.760 --> 3:53:59.440]  so we want to thank everybody so again we are back live we were in
[3:53:59.440 --> 3:54:03.360]  retransmission the last 15 minutes uh because i wasn't sure if our backup
[3:54:03.360 --> 3:54:06.720]  batteries would hold most of them did hold but some of the
[3:54:06.720 --> 3:54:10.480]  server stream backup batteries went down
[3:54:10.480 --> 3:54:15.120]  this is not just a radio network or radio station it's not just tv it's a lot
[3:54:15.120 --> 3:54:19.920]  of other things so uh it was a good good live action drill for us
[3:54:19.920 --> 3:54:23.760]  here today i want to thank oatman john's out of town right now my regular guy

[3:54:52.880 --> 3:54:56.080]  capital where the cps is trying to get rid of the fourth amendment the state of
[3:54:56.080 --> 3:54:59.280]  texas and kidnap any children they want without warrants or court orders
[3:54:59.280 --> 3:55:03.600]  unbelievable story we'll have those folks on tomorrow i apologize to them
[3:55:03.600 --> 3:55:07.280]  we had our power go out a couple times last year at the other place
[3:55:07.280 --> 3:55:11.280]  we put in more batteries and things one day it went off for three hours and
[3:55:11.280 --> 3:55:14.800]  we got about two and a half hours of air time before the batteries went down so
[3:55:14.800 --> 3:55:18.880]  we're going to get that fixed and up and going but tomorrow is the big money bomb
[3:55:18.880 --> 3:55:22.080]  please listeners even if you can't afford to give ten dollars at the money bomb

[3:55:37.120 --> 3:55:41.280]  big effect on them we're fighting the government that takes our tax money at

[3:55:46.000 --> 3:55:49.120]  money like the government does but the government says it's bad for us to even
[3:55:49.120 --> 3:55:51.760]  ask for money well that's because they're scared of us combining forces
[3:55:51.760 --> 3:55:56.400]  together and supporting people like we did ron paul and others
[3:55:56.400 --> 3:55:59.440]  they're very very scared of that so uh retransmission starts here in just a
