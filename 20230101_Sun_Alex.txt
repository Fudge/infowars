[00:00.000 --> 00:05.720]  If you think gun control or something like that is going to change the terrorist point
[00:05.720 --> 00:08.680]  of view, I think you're like out of your mind.
[00:08.680 --> 00:12.400]  You may think you've got me worried about what you're going to do, dude, you're about
[00:12.400 --> 00:16.280]  to find out what I'm going to do, and that's going to worry you a lot more.
[00:16.280 --> 00:21.560]  Oh, dawg, you don't step aside, we'll tear you apart.
[00:21.560 --> 00:23.880]  You die first, Ed.
[00:23.880 --> 00:27.280]  Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe, you
[00:27.280 --> 00:28.280]  understand me.
[00:28.280 --> 00:30.400]  He's bluffing, what's Russian?
[00:30.400 --> 00:31.400]  No.
[00:31.400 --> 00:32.400]  He ain't bluffing.
[00:32.400 --> 00:34.400]  You're not as stupid as you look, Ike.
[00:34.400 --> 00:38.800]  Yeah, I don't understand the concepts of the conversation of the gun culture.
[00:38.800 --> 00:44.080]  We've lived with guns since, what, the 7th century or something, I don't know.
[00:44.080 --> 00:48.840]  We all know that right now, guns are a token, it's a metaphor that differentiates white
[00:48.840 --> 00:49.840]  guys' need.
[00:49.840 --> 00:51.840]  It makes them feel good because they're being shot.
[00:51.840 --> 00:52.840]  You can say what you want, I'll agree with that.
[00:52.840 --> 00:56.160]  There's a big difference between fantasy land and reality.
[00:56.160 --> 00:58.160]  Fantasy land is what we do, doing a movie.
[00:58.160 --> 01:02.000]  Doing a television show, that's fantasy land, and that's where that stuff belongs.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.880]  In reality, when we're dealing with things like terrorism, we're all going to have different
[01:05.880 --> 01:09.280]  opinions on how to do it, how to deal with it.
[01:09.280 --> 01:14.440]  Mine happens to be that I think there's a very strong reason Founding Fathers had for
[01:14.440 --> 01:19.880]  the 2nd Amendment, and that is that no government ever hasn't had to fight its own people, and
[01:19.880 --> 01:22.440]  its own people hasn't had to fight its own government.
[01:22.440 --> 01:23.440]  So what are you going to do?
[01:23.440 --> 01:24.440]  Outlaw everything?
[01:24.440 --> 01:25.440]  That ain't the answer.
[01:25.440 --> 01:32.440]  Put some controls, what, so the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[01:32.440 --> 01:36.640]  No, nothing can, just so the idiots can't get hold of themselves.
[01:36.640 --> 01:38.560]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[01:38.560 --> 01:39.560]  Are you serious about that?
[01:39.560 --> 01:40.560]  Are you serious?
[01:40.560 --> 01:41.560]  What good will that?
[01:41.560 --> 01:42.560]  Oh my God.
[01:42.560 --> 01:43.560]  We had our civil war.
[01:43.560 --> 01:44.560]  If that 2nd Amendment hadn't been there, those people would not have had the opportunity
[01:44.560 --> 01:45.560]  to do what they considered was defending their life, their way, their way of living.
[01:45.560 --> 01:59.280]  So I agree with that, I think that's an important part of our existence, and it's basically
[01:59.280 --> 02:00.280]  that simple.
[02:00.280 --> 02:18.880]  It's called the great reset, tough guy, it's called the new world order, it's called the
[02:18.880 --> 02:23.920]  big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can loan us fiat
[02:23.920 --> 02:28.120]  money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and a universal basic
[02:28.120 --> 02:29.120]  income.
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.240]  That's the whole future of our lives, the whole world's going to be about surveillance
[02:34.240 --> 02:38.480]  and control and then manipulating and tracking everything you do, it's all being officially
[02:38.480 --> 02:46.280]  announced, we've got articles everywhere, their press releases saying it.
[02:46.280 --> 02:48.280]  And then the crew asks me during the break, they go, are you alright, are you alright,
[02:48.280 --> 02:49.280]  I didn't really see them set you up, are you feeling okay?
[02:49.280 --> 02:54.280]  Well then, they're about to have their war, I mean, they're going to starve a couple hundred
[02:54.280 --> 02:58.480]  million people to death, yeah, I'm pretty freaked out, yeah, but this is real, this
[02:58.480 --> 03:05.480]  is not, this is not a freaking game to me, man.
[03:05.480 --> 03:13.480]  People are already starving to death by the hundreds of millions right now, no, you never
[03:13.480 --> 03:18.480]  see it on news, they're dying right now, they're in, their freaking houses starving to death,
[03:18.480 --> 03:23.320]  begging for God to help them and no one's coming because God tells us to get up and
[03:23.320 --> 03:26.320]  take action and then we don't do anything.
[03:26.320 --> 03:35.320]  And that paralyzes God, yeah, God can do it, but God needs us to do it because God's not
[03:35.320 --> 03:36.320]  free will.
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.640]  Once again, not for the first time what has seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned
[03:40.640 --> 03:41.640]  out to be the truth.
[03:41.640 --> 03:49.920]  Yeah, I'm upset, I'm really, I'm really freaked out, I'm really freaked out, I'm really freaked
[03:49.920 --> 03:55.840]  out, I'm really freaked out, you see, because this is real, the supply chain may cut off,
[03:55.840 --> 04:03.000]  the energy grid being cut off is real and we're going into a time now where we're not
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.760]  going to be on the air, I mean if we don't back this off, if we don't get sane people
[04:06.760 --> 04:21.760]  to stop the globalist, we won't be here in six months, you won't be here in six months.
[04:21.760 --> 04:25.440]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[04:25.440 --> 04:26.440]  Infowars.com.
[04:26.440 --> 04:27.440]  Infowars comes to mind.
[04:27.440 --> 04:28.440]  Infowars.
[04:28.440 --> 04:29.440]  Infowars.
[04:29.440 --> 04:30.440]  Infowars.
[04:30.440 --> 04:31.440]  You watch Infowars?
[04:31.440 --> 04:32.440]  Infowars.
[04:32.440 --> 04:34.440]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[04:34.440 --> 04:35.440]  Alex Jones.
[04:35.440 --> 04:36.440]  Nice guy.
[04:36.440 --> 04:38.440]  He must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[04:38.440 --> 04:39.440]  Alex Jones.
[04:39.440 --> 04:40.440]  Alex Jones.
[04:40.440 --> 04:41.440]  Alex Jones.
[04:41.440 --> 04:42.440]  Alex Jones.
[04:42.440 --> 04:43.440]  Alex Jones.
[04:43.440 --> 04:44.440]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[04:44.440 --> 04:45.440]  He knows who Infowars is.
[04:45.440 --> 04:46.440]  Playing this joke over here.
[04:46.440 --> 04:47.440]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[04:47.440 --> 04:50.440]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[04:50.440 --> 04:57.440]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[04:57.440 --> 05:03.440]  There is a war on for your mind.
[05:03.440 --> 05:05.200]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[05:05.200 --> 05:07.440]  This is an information war.
[05:07.440 --> 05:11.440]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[05:11.440 --> 05:17.440]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor Sannis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all
[05:17.440 --> 05:23.440]  using the terms that Infowars has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations
[05:23.440 --> 05:24.440]  and we know how to beat them.
[05:24.440 --> 05:29.440]  But we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products and
[05:29.440 --> 05:31.440]  power you and your immune system and your family as well.
[05:31.440 --> 05:35.440]  You can also make straight donations at infowarstore.com, clicking on the big red banner.
[05:35.440 --> 05:36.440]  A one-time recurring.
[05:36.440 --> 05:38.440]  But I'm asking you to take action.
[05:38.440 --> 05:39.440]  We're nonviolent.
[05:39.440 --> 05:43.440]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on
[05:43.440 --> 05:48.440]  the line, you are literally, not violently politically, punching the new World Order in the nose.
[05:48.440 --> 05:50.440]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[05:50.440 --> 05:52.440]  We are going to defeat the new World Order.
[05:52.440 --> 05:53.440]  We're going over the top.
[05:53.440 --> 05:55.440]  And right now is a critical juncture.
[05:55.440 --> 05:58.440]  So please go to infowarstore.com and donate now.
[05:58.440 --> 06:03.440]  Donate now, donate now, donate now.
[06:03.440 --> 06:06.440]  Another time.
[06:06.440 --> 06:35.640]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from Austin, Texas,
[06:35.640 --> 06:40.200]  Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex John.
[06:40.200 --> 06:46.240]  Watching the vandalism of civilization, watching the purposeful destruction of human society
[06:46.240 --> 06:52.760]  and culture, repeat again in mass war under new names, it's very painful, but it's up
[06:52.760 --> 06:57.680]  to those of us that are aware of this, to persevere and continue civilization on to
[06:57.680 --> 06:59.480]  rebuild after.
[06:59.480 --> 07:05.520]  Well, we couldn't have a more important informative guest on today to cover the water front.
[07:05.520 --> 07:13.600]  He's Dr. Francis Boyle, he's an author, researcher, lawyer, took the special Ph.D., only one person
[07:13.600 --> 07:17.240]  gets a year at Harvard, that Henry Kissinger and Smith Brzezinski took, that teaches him
[07:17.240 --> 07:21.040]  how the whole New World War works, he was the top war crimes prosecutor, people like
[07:21.040 --> 07:26.080]  Slovak Molozovic at the UN, he wrote the U.S. law on chemical and biological weapons
[07:26.080 --> 07:32.720]  that contributed to the world law, and he's here to talk about the water front today,
[07:32.720 --> 07:38.920]  the huge escalation, as he pointed out, on the escalation ladder the Pentagon uses to
[07:38.920 --> 07:43.880]  full on total nuclear war, we'll also look at the gain of function coming out and the
[07:43.880 --> 07:48.560]  fact that it's now confirmed the deep state was censoring scientists and doctors and others
[07:48.560 --> 07:55.600]  that were exposing the truth, and we'll also look at the poison COVID shots, and so much
[07:55.600 --> 07:59.680]  more with him, the Twitter files, there's so much to cover, so I'm going to try to let
[07:59.680 --> 08:04.960]  Dr. Boyle start wherever he wishes, and it's great to have him on with us here today, so
[08:04.960 --> 08:06.960]  Dr. Boyle, thank you so much.
[08:06.960 --> 08:14.800]  Oh, thank you very much, Alex, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, Happy Holidays there to all
[08:14.800 --> 08:15.800]  your audience.
[08:15.800 --> 08:21.680]  I know you're not about being vindicated, you don't want the credit, but you also need
[08:21.680 --> 08:26.560]  folks to know the gravitas, you're a serious guy, you were on the air in late January and
[08:26.560 --> 08:32.600]  early February, 2020 on my show and other shows, predicting it was out of the lab, predicting
[08:32.600 --> 08:38.240]  the shots would be poisoned, predicting war would follow, predicting world ID cards, predicting
[08:38.240 --> 08:42.880]  the shots would cause mass death, so out of all the pantheon of great people, the Dr.
[08:42.880 --> 08:48.440]  Robert Malone's and the Dr. Michael, you know, Yidon's, you have been the most on target
[08:48.440 --> 08:53.560]  and the early bird in all this, so I know you want to get into the war in Ukraine and
[08:53.560 --> 08:59.080]  expanding and that existential threat, I want to hit that, but first, total vindication
[08:59.080 --> 09:01.960]  Dr. Boyle, it's like you had a crystal ball.
[09:01.960 --> 09:10.680]  Well, Alex, a lot of this credit goes to you because you're the only person in the mainstream
[09:10.680 --> 09:15.560]  news media that would let me talk about these things.
[09:15.560 --> 09:24.840]  I first blew the whistle on it on January 24, 2020, in a worldwide alert.
[09:24.840 --> 09:33.320]  The dangers here that COVID-19 was an offensive biological warfare weapon that had leaked out
[09:33.320 --> 09:37.200]  of the Wuhan BSL-4.
[09:37.200 --> 09:47.600]  And then later on on your program, I said that any Franken shots that big pharma developed
[09:47.600 --> 09:52.720]  here would be more dangerous than useless.
[09:52.720 --> 10:01.680]  And then later on on your show, I said, messenger RNA is very powerful stuff to inject it to
[10:01.680 --> 10:08.040]  your body and it could discombobulate your entire genetic system.
[10:08.040 --> 10:15.640]  Now, I said that very early on, as you correctly pointed out, in early February to you and
[10:15.640 --> 10:19.760]  on Info Wars and some of your colleagues.
[10:19.760 --> 10:26.800]  So kudos to you and to Info Wars for letting me speak the truth to the American people.
[10:26.800 --> 10:31.680]  But how did you, I mean, I know you were, wrote the bio weapons laws and were a top
[10:31.680 --> 10:34.520]  prosecutor at the UN, but just how did you nail it?
[10:34.520 --> 10:37.040]  So you totally nailed it.
[10:37.040 --> 10:41.000]  Well, we've discussed this before.
[10:41.000 --> 10:50.320]  I think the most important point now from my perspective are these proposed regulations
[10:50.320 --> 10:59.200]  by the World Health Authority and also the proposed pandemic treaty by the World Health
[10:59.200 --> 11:05.840]  Organization that are now under consideration over in Geneva.
[11:05.840 --> 11:12.600]  I have read both the regulations and the tree.
[11:12.600 --> 11:22.920]  And according to either one or both, they will established a scientific and medical
[11:22.920 --> 11:33.200]  police state that will cover the entire world and that will usurp and negate the sovereignty
[11:33.200 --> 11:41.800]  of the United States of America, as well as the sovereignty of the states of the Union
[11:41.800 --> 11:49.560]  under the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution and penetrate right down to our
[11:49.560 --> 11:53.120]  primary care physicians.
[11:53.120 --> 12:02.320]  You will have Dr. Tedros there, the WHO, telling our medical doctors how to treat us.
[12:02.320 --> 12:10.640]  This will be a one way path to the cemetery for all Americans and right now we must get
[12:10.640 --> 12:20.280]  organized to defeat the WHO regulations and the WHO treaty on future.
[12:20.280 --> 12:24.240]  And let's be clear, you're a guy that writes the US and UN regulations, there couldn't be
[12:24.240 --> 12:26.280]  a better guess to describe this.
[12:26.280 --> 12:29.760]  You've read the treaty, you've read the regulations, you're saying what we've been
[12:29.760 --> 12:36.480]  hearing is true that it is a worldwide biomedical big pharma corporate police state.
[12:36.480 --> 12:37.480]  That's correct.
[12:37.480 --> 12:47.120]  And in fact, Alex, I've researched, studied and taught international organizations, starting
[12:47.120 --> 12:54.400]  from my student days at Harvard Law School up until today, beginning with the First
[12:54.400 --> 13:01.640]  Hague Peace Conference of 1899, up through and including the United Nations Organization.
[13:01.640 --> 13:09.960]  You can read about this in my book, Foundations of World Order, Duke University Press, 1999,
[13:09.960 --> 13:13.720]  which was half of my PhD dissertation at Harvard.
[13:13.720 --> 13:18.720]  So yes, I've done this work professionally for all those years.
[13:18.720 --> 13:28.640]  Indeed, the most insidious part of the WHO treaty, from my perspective, is that the concluding
[13:28.640 --> 13:39.640]  clause has been drafted so that it will come into effect immediately upon signature by
[13:39.640 --> 13:41.640]  Biden's Delegate.
[13:41.640 --> 13:49.520]  Let me repeat that, it will come into effect immediately upon signature for Biden's Delegate,
[13:49.520 --> 13:57.600]  despite the requirements of the United States Constitution, that all treaties must receive
[13:57.600 --> 14:08.640]  the advice and consent of the United States Senate, a clear-cut usurpation of our Constitution,
[14:08.640 --> 14:16.800]  as well as the 10th Amendment, guaranteeing that all rights not delegated to the federal
[14:16.800 --> 14:23.360]  government reside in the hands of the states, the union, or the people.
[14:23.360 --> 14:28.800]  And so what will happen under this treaty, and also under the regulations, people like
[14:28.800 --> 14:39.120]  Governor DeSantis, Governor Abbott, and others who do not accept the party line coming out
[14:39.120 --> 14:43.200]  of the CDC will be side-sept and usurped.
[14:43.200 --> 14:44.200]  And that was my next question.
[14:44.200 --> 14:45.200]  We'll come back from break.
[14:45.200 --> 14:48.840]  We'll get into the World Treaty and more, and then get into the war in Ukraine that's
[14:48.840 --> 14:51.880]  currently the big, obviously, the front burner threat.
[14:51.880 --> 14:58.360]  But what do you make of the German vice president saying we need investigations, criminal investigations,
[14:58.360 --> 15:03.680]  the Supreme Court three days ago green-lining criminal investigations in Florida?
[15:03.680 --> 15:05.400]  That's got to be encouraging.
[15:05.400 --> 15:06.640]  Right.
[15:06.640 --> 15:16.080]  I have read the request for a grand jury that Governor DeSantis filed with the Florida
[15:16.080 --> 15:23.600]  Supreme Court, and then I have read the terms of reference given by the Florida Supreme
[15:23.600 --> 15:24.600]  Court.
[15:24.600 --> 15:33.760]  They are broad enough, in my opinion, to include indictments against everyone involved here
[15:33.760 --> 15:40.360]  for murder and conspiracy to commit murder in accordance with Florida law.
[15:40.360 --> 15:42.360]  And I certainly would encourage them to.
[15:42.360 --> 15:43.360]  Don, I'll stay there.
[15:43.360 --> 15:44.360]  I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor.
[15:44.360 --> 15:45.360]  Let's come back with that.
[15:45.360 --> 15:49.640]  Let's finish up with COVID and then get into the World War III situation and that latter
[15:49.640 --> 15:53.400]  of escalation you warned of two months ago on the show that we've now moved up several
[15:53.400 --> 15:54.400]  rooms on.
[15:54.400 --> 15:55.400]  Wow.
[15:55.400 --> 15:56.400]  Dr. Francis A. Boyle is our guest.
[15:56.400 --> 15:57.400]  Stay with us.
[15:57.400 --> 15:58.400]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[15:58.400 --> 15:59.400]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[15:59.400 --> 16:00.400]  Well, so do I.
[16:00.400 --> 16:01.400]  And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist, and I've
[16:01.400 --> 16:02.400]  got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[16:02.400 --> 16:03.400]  But, ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[16:03.400 --> 16:16.120]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[16:16.120 --> 16:20.120]  The bad news is, the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not
[16:20.120 --> 16:21.120]  going to back down.
[16:21.120 --> 16:23.120]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[16:23.120 --> 16:26.680]  So please keep me on the field, keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting
[16:26.680 --> 16:30.040]  great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.
[16:30.040 --> 16:34.920]  InfowarsStore.com for the best supplements and more, or just make a straight donation,
[16:34.920 --> 16:39.480]  Big Red Man at the top of InfowarsStore.com, and that way all the money goes towards the
[16:39.480 --> 16:41.600]  fight, not part of it going towards product cost.
[16:41.600 --> 16:43.360]  But I thank you all for your support.
[16:43.360 --> 16:47.680]  Please commit now to go to InfowarsStore.com, get great products, and make donations.
[16:47.680 --> 16:48.680]  I thank you for your support.
[16:48.680 --> 16:49.680]  Now take action.
[16:49.680 --> 16:52.880]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[16:52.880 --> 17:05.560]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[17:05.560 --> 17:10.920]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[17:10.920 --> 17:13.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.560]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[17:15.560 --> 17:18.720]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[17:18.720 --> 17:20.440]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[17:20.440 --> 17:24.600]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on their 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[17:24.600 --> 17:28.920]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[17:28.920 --> 17:29.920]  your support.
[17:29.920 --> 17:33.000]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.520]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[17:37.520 --> 17:41.480]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Infowars has been because
[17:41.480 --> 17:42.480]  of your past support.
[17:42.480 --> 17:46.680]  So I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[17:46.680 --> 17:51.120]  every double your efforts of visiting InfowarsStore.com, and getting amazing products to keep us
[17:51.120 --> 17:52.120]  on air.
[17:52.120 --> 17:54.120]  1776 is the promo code.
[17:54.120 --> 18:00.000]  The destination is InfowarsStore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history
[18:03.880 --> 18:09.040]  of Infowars under a new brand name, Infowars Platinum.
[18:09.040 --> 18:13.760]  Now all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number
[18:13.760 --> 18:18.800]  one bestsellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[18:18.800 --> 18:22.840]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've
[18:22.840 --> 18:28.720]  given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under
[18:28.720 --> 18:29.720]  other names.
[18:29.720 --> 18:35.600]  And not just other one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other
[18:35.600 --> 18:37.800]  major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[18:37.800 --> 18:42.360]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[18:42.360 --> 18:44.240]  We're talking about Payne MD.
[18:44.240 --> 18:46.920]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[18:46.920 --> 18:49.800]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[18:49.800 --> 18:51.400]  These things are incredible.
[18:51.400 --> 18:55.280]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your health
[18:55.280 --> 18:59.560]  care provider because they're so powerful, get them at InfowarsStore.com.
[18:59.560 --> 19:04.240]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school, and they had great effects.
[19:04.240 --> 19:07.960]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[19:07.960 --> 19:12.720]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing
[19:12.720 --> 19:17.160]  factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our
[19:17.160 --> 19:18.160]  natural male potential.
[19:18.160 --> 19:20.640]  But these products work great for women as well.
[19:20.640 --> 19:22.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Payne MD.
[19:22.680 --> 19:25.560]  It's the number one natural best seller under another name.
[19:25.560 --> 19:30.960]  We got it discounted for 40% off InfowarsStore.com under the label Infowars Platinum.
[19:30.960 --> 19:33.680]  We've also got HGH Max Boost.
[19:33.680 --> 19:34.880]  Read all about it.
[19:34.880 --> 19:36.160]  Be very safe with it.
[19:36.160 --> 19:39.440]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at
[19:39.440 --> 19:40.440]  night.
[19:40.440 --> 19:42.040]  Don't do it during the day.
[19:42.040 --> 19:45.320]  1776 testosterone boost, totally incredible.
[19:45.320 --> 19:46.320]  Go read about them.
[19:46.320 --> 19:51.960]  Learn more about them at InfowarsStore.com in the Infowars Platinum section.
[19:51.960 --> 20:01.320]  And you get 40% off on these already bestselling products under the new name Infowars Platinum.
[20:01.320 --> 20:12.680]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:12.680 --> 20:25.200]  All right, Dr. Francis A. Boyle, author, researcher, man that wrote the U.S. Biological Chemical
[20:25.200 --> 20:30.000]  Weapons Law, former UN, workhounds prosecutor.
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.280]  Got cut off by the break, he was getting into the German vice president saying he wants
[20:34.280 --> 20:39.680]  an investigation of the shots, a criminal investigation launched by the state of Florida
[20:39.680 --> 20:45.080]  and more, and then finishing up with all the gain of function news and what's coming out
[20:45.080 --> 20:49.240]  and what he thinks the deep state's going to do now because they're being so exposed.
[20:49.240 --> 20:54.200]  Elon Musk coming out, pointing out that Fauci's wife runs the bioethics board that controls
[20:54.200 --> 20:55.200]  what he can do.
[20:55.200 --> 20:59.560]  I mean, is this whole incestuous bio weapons program comes out?
[20:59.560 --> 21:01.200]  Looks like it's blown up in their face.
[21:01.200 --> 21:02.840]  Please continue, Dr. Boyle.
[21:02.840 --> 21:03.840]  Right.
[21:03.840 --> 21:12.480]  Again, one point to drive home for your audience to understand, Trump pulled us out of the
[21:12.480 --> 21:14.960]  WHO for good cause.
[21:14.960 --> 21:17.360]  I agree with that decision.
[21:17.360 --> 21:25.600]  One of the first steps Biden made as president was to put us back into the WHO and he appointed
[21:25.600 --> 21:34.880]  Tony Fauci as the US government's representative on the executive council of the WHO.
[21:34.880 --> 21:37.360]  Now think about that for a minute.
[21:37.360 --> 21:46.760]  That's where the WHO treaty and the WHO regulations are coming from, Tony Fauci and on that, we've
[21:46.760 --> 21:48.880]  discussed Fauci before.
[21:48.880 --> 21:55.160]  You can read Bobby Kennedy's book on the real Anthony Fauci, it's all in there.
[21:55.160 --> 22:04.800]  So it's clear what happened here is that Fauci and his ilk like Bill Gates, like Big Pharma,
[22:04.800 --> 22:15.240]  like the bio warfare industry, when they saw the opposition coming from American people
[22:15.240 --> 22:23.880]  and governors and other elected officials, decided to do an enron around all of us by
[22:23.880 --> 22:34.520]  going to the WHO and drafting these regulations and this treaty that will set up a worldwide
[22:34.520 --> 22:44.160]  scientific medical police state under the control of Tedros and Bill Gates and the bio warfare
[22:44.160 --> 22:50.560]  industry, Big Pharma and the Chinese communist government that gives a lot of money to the
[22:50.560 --> 22:52.160]  WHO.
[22:52.160 --> 22:59.840]  That is what is confronting us today, Alex, as citizens of the United States of America,
[22:59.840 --> 23:03.360]  we have to stop these WHO regulations.
[23:03.360 --> 23:11.240]  We must stop this WHO treaty if we want to live in freedom here in the United States.
[23:11.240 --> 23:18.160]  Again, you've read the treaty, you've read the regulations and that's what I've seen
[23:18.160 --> 23:21.160]  Congress people say the same thing you said, I've looked over it as well.
[23:21.160 --> 23:26.440]  It looks like the UN gives control of pandemic response, but then the UN, I saw their hearings
[23:26.440 --> 23:32.720]  three years ago before the pandemic was announced in December of 2019, the head of their vaccine
[23:32.720 --> 23:37.640]  program said we're just told by the Big Pharma what to say about these shots, we don't even
[23:37.640 --> 23:38.640]  test them.
[23:38.640 --> 23:43.280]  So the UN itself, if the UN will be in control under this treaty, who's in control of the
[23:43.280 --> 23:44.280]  UN?
[23:44.280 --> 23:51.640]  Well, you know, you get what you pay for, he who pays the piper calls the tune.
[23:51.640 --> 23:59.720]  I mean, the UN is a rotten corrupt and despicable organization.
[23:59.720 --> 24:05.400]  When I was the lawyer for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war on genocide
[24:05.400 --> 24:14.120]  against them, the United Nations, the European Union, its member states and Bill Clinton
[24:14.120 --> 24:21.360]  at UN headquarters in Geneva tried to carve up the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
[24:21.360 --> 24:28.720]  into two little three little bitty pieces of land, Rob Bosnia of their UN membership
[24:28.720 --> 24:37.400]  destroy their statehood under international law and subject 1.5 to 2 million more Bosnians
[24:37.400 --> 24:43.120]  to ethnic cleansing when we already had 2 million victims of ethnic cleansing.
[24:43.120 --> 24:44.680]  Now I stopped them.
[24:44.680 --> 24:45.920]  It never happened.
[24:45.920 --> 24:49.760]  Bosnia and Herzegovina is still there today.
[24:49.760 --> 24:57.120]  And they have the UN membership, but that's what they were going to do to the poor Bosnians.
[24:57.120 --> 25:00.240]  So you've lived the predatory nature of the UN.
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.000]  I want to get into all the other big subjects, but you're a UN insider, a guy that, you know,
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.360]  tried to reform him, but couldn't obviously, but this has been worked there.
[25:07.360 --> 25:11.520]  What is the UN now, basically a corporate front group of corporate fascists or what
[25:11.520 --> 25:13.200]  is it?
[25:13.200 --> 25:19.640]  I think corporate fascists is good description, certainly for the UN secretariat, right?
[25:19.640 --> 25:20.640]  I think that's a good description.
[25:20.640 --> 25:25.520]  Yes, so the general body is a debating club of no power, but the actual UN and the Security
[25:25.520 --> 25:27.800]  Council, that's fascist.
[25:27.800 --> 25:31.240]  Well, the secretariat, the bureaucracy, right?
[25:31.240 --> 25:37.520]  And then they control the specialized agencies like the WHO, sure.
[25:37.520 --> 25:39.520]  And we all know the WHO.
[25:39.520 --> 25:43.800]  Could the UN be reformed?
[25:43.800 --> 25:45.880]  I really don't know at this point.
[25:45.880 --> 25:54.080]  My assessment, Alex, was when I was at UN headquarters in Geneva and they were trying
[25:54.080 --> 25:59.000]  to destroy the Bosnians, a UN member state.
[25:59.000 --> 26:07.120]  It struck me that historically this was at the situation of the decline, the inevitable
[26:07.120 --> 26:14.520]  decline of the League of Nations, when Holly Salassie appeared in the exact same location
[26:14.520 --> 26:22.160]  I was and appealed for the League to save Abyssinia from Mussolini and his fascists
[26:22.160 --> 26:23.760]  and they did nothing.
[26:23.760 --> 26:29.080]  So I regret to say the UN is on decline.
[26:29.080 --> 26:33.000]  That's a great example of when the Ethiopian leader tried to stop that and I could have
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.960]  stopped World War II if they had done something then.
[26:36.960 --> 26:42.760]  It could have, sure, but they didn't and indeed, in the case of the Bosnians, it was far worse.
[26:42.760 --> 26:47.440]  They tried to get rid of us and I stopped them, yes, I did.
[26:47.440 --> 26:49.640]  And your own record doing that, you've done so many amazing things.
[26:49.640 --> 26:53.960]  I know when I talk about how you know all this, you just moved on to the next subject,
[26:53.960 --> 26:55.480]  but your knowledge is just incredible.
[26:55.480 --> 26:57.960]  I mean, it's amazing to be able to pick your brain.
[26:57.960 --> 27:00.280]  We got two minutes to break.
[27:00.280 --> 27:02.200]  What subjects do you want to go to next?
[27:02.200 --> 27:06.880]  Well, we can move on to Ukraine if you want to, sure.
[27:06.880 --> 27:07.880]  Let's do that.
[27:07.880 --> 27:10.360]  Give us a prelude of what's coming up.
[27:10.360 --> 27:17.160]  Well, if we don't stop Biden, we're going to have a direct war with Russia.
[27:17.160 --> 27:26.160]  Right now, there is an indirect war, a de facto state of war between the United States and
[27:26.160 --> 27:31.000]  Russia, even for Mr. Lavrov, as said that.
[27:31.000 --> 27:37.800]  So we're going to have to stop the Bidenites before they continue up this ladder of escalation.
[27:37.800 --> 27:46.840]  You have the list there, the con letter of escalation developed by for Rand and the Pentagon.
[27:46.840 --> 27:53.880]  And if you skip down just a little bit, you'll see we're at stage 20.
[27:53.880 --> 27:59.960]  The no nuclear use threshold, we're right there, peaceful, worldwide embargo.
[27:59.960 --> 28:00.960]  Right.
[28:00.960 --> 28:07.160]  That's exactly what we have today against the Russian Federation.
[28:07.160 --> 28:14.920]  Biden and the European Union member states are waging economic warfare against the Russian
[28:14.920 --> 28:16.420]  Federation.
[28:16.420 --> 28:24.200]  See, in my opinion, I think we're one step below the nuclear threshold there as identified
[28:24.200 --> 28:25.200]  by Herman.
[28:25.200 --> 28:27.520]  And that's what you said two months ago on the show, that's what Lavrov said yesterday.
[28:27.520 --> 28:31.280]  He said, we're entering the nuclear threshold, this needs to stop now.
[28:31.280 --> 28:32.280]  Right.
[28:32.280 --> 28:34.240]  It has to stop now.
[28:34.240 --> 28:41.560]  And yet you will see the Bidenites refuse, adamantly refuse to negotiate.
[28:41.560 --> 28:47.520]  That's the other day Putin said he will negotiate, Lavrov said they will negotiate the Bidenites
[28:47.520 --> 28:53.560]  refuse and of course Zelensky refuses, but he's our puppet Zelensky tells whatever.
[28:53.560 --> 28:59.680]  Well, let's talk about what comes next with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[28:59.680 --> 29:01.840]  There is a war on for your mind.
[29:01.840 --> 29:03.640]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[29:03.640 --> 29:05.840]  This is an information war.
[29:05.840 --> 29:09.960]  Info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[29:09.960 --> 29:15.800]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all
[29:15.800 --> 29:21.600]  using the terms that info wars has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations
[29:21.600 --> 29:23.200]  and we know how to beat them.
[29:23.200 --> 29:27.280]  But we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products and

[29:45.280 --> 29:49.080]  order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose.
[29:49.080 --> 29:50.960]  We are going to defeat the new world order.
[29:50.960 --> 29:51.960]  We're going over the top.
[29:51.960 --> 29:53.600]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[29:53.600 --> 30:00.080]  So please go to infowarstore.com and donate now.

[30:17.960 --> 30:19.560]  from the info wars store.
[30:19.560 --> 30:24.360]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[30:24.360 --> 30:27.080]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[30:27.080 --> 30:31.920]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[30:31.920 --> 30:36.640]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[30:36.640 --> 30:37.640]  shown.
[30:37.640 --> 30:41.920]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[30:41.920 --> 30:46.480]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[30:46.480 --> 30:51.600]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[30:51.600 --> 30:52.600]  like here in America.

[31:40.400 --> 31:44.360]  and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.

[32:39.960 --> 32:42.960]  tumor at 95% or humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[32:42.960 --> 32:45.640]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[32:45.640 --> 32:50.920]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling
[32:50.920 --> 32:51.920]  these.

[33:01.360 --> 33:14.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.520 --> 33:20.240]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[33:20.240 --> 33:22.360]  Do you want to stop tyranny?
[33:22.360 --> 33:24.440]  Well so does he.
[33:24.440 --> 33:29.240]  Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:29.240 --> 33:37.160]  Boy, folks are really waking up to the city lockdowns and the climate lockdowns that are
[33:37.160 --> 33:38.160]  being announced.
[33:38.160 --> 33:46.080]  The 15 minute cities, I said a very well-known podcaster texted me and asked, is this real?
[33:46.080 --> 33:47.080]  And yes, it's real.
[33:47.080 --> 33:51.000]  We've been covering it for years, but tomorrow I'm just going to open the show up no matter
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.600]  how big the news is with the 15 minute cities and the UN lockdowns, the climate lockdowns
[33:56.600 --> 33:57.600]  and all the rest of it.
[33:57.600 --> 34:02.120]  But we're talking to Dr. Francis A. Boyle right now who wrote the U.S. biological chemical
[34:02.120 --> 34:03.120]  weapons laws.
[34:03.120 --> 34:09.440]  It was the top UN war crimes prosecutor and more and who's the most accurate person predicting
[34:09.440 --> 34:15.960]  almost three years ago, starting in January of 2020, what was going to unfold and happen.
[34:15.960 --> 34:17.720]  So we were continuing on.
[34:17.720 --> 34:25.800]  We hit the break with Russia and this escalation ladder, a generalized scenario, the Rand Corporation
[34:25.800 --> 34:33.280]  and the Pentagon that were at point 20, what point 44 means and where this huge escalation
[34:33.280 --> 34:37.440]  is going and what the neocons and the crazy Democrats think they're doing.
[34:37.440 --> 34:38.440]  Please continue.
[34:38.440 --> 34:49.280]  Well, again, we saw this massive propaganda campaign by the Bidenites to bring Zelensky
[34:49.280 --> 34:57.640]  over here and try to get support from the American people in Congress for this existentially
[34:57.640 --> 35:02.760]  dangerous war against Russia that is going on right now.
[35:02.760 --> 35:13.360]  I teach the laws of war and I would say right now with Russia, we are in a de facto state
[35:13.360 --> 35:16.520]  of war with Russia.
[35:16.520 --> 35:23.720]  It is not yet a de jure state of war with Russia, but it's certainly a de facto and
[35:23.720 --> 35:29.800]  again, Foreign Minister Lavrov, who's a very experienced consummate diplomat, has said
[35:29.800 --> 35:31.440]  the same thing here.
[35:31.440 --> 35:34.840]  So it's extremely dangerous.
[35:34.840 --> 35:42.640]  Anything could set this off and then rather than de escalate the situation, Biden and
[35:42.640 --> 35:48.440]  the Democrats bring Zelensky over here to escalate.
[35:48.440 --> 35:53.960]  Well, this is like if imagine of Kennedy vacation in the US Virgin Islands for two weeks during
[35:53.960 --> 35:57.160]  the Cuban Missile Crisis, he'd be impeached.
[35:57.160 --> 36:02.520]  Can we move as you pushed four months ago to impeach Biden immediately for war crimes?
[36:02.520 --> 36:08.600]  Well, yes, that's true, but let's compare this to the Cuban Missile Crisis, because
[36:08.600 --> 36:19.520]  I think it's very instructive that for Russia, this is even more dangerous than the Cuban
[36:19.520 --> 36:28.800]  Missile Crisis in reverse, because in our case, Cuba was 90 miles south of Florida.
[36:28.800 --> 36:31.200]  This is right on their borders.
[36:31.200 --> 36:39.360]  And the second thing I think we need to consider is that Biden is no JFK.
[36:39.360 --> 36:47.680]  Whatever you think of JFK, he volunteered for combat during World War II and performed
[36:47.680 --> 36:53.000]  heroically, courageously, and was seriously injured.
[36:53.000 --> 36:59.920]  Well, Biden's done nothing with his career, but be on the payroll of there in Delaware
[36:59.920 --> 37:05.440]  of Wall Street and the banksters and everyone else who does their corporate headquarters
[37:05.440 --> 37:08.440]  in Delaware, because that's the most favorite.
[37:08.440 --> 37:13.320]  Kennedy engaged a Japanese destroyer with a small patrol boat and got his back broken.
[37:13.320 --> 37:15.600]  And we know the whole story, very heroic.
[37:15.600 --> 37:21.080]  And then, meanwhile, if we go up this chain of what's happening, it's very apocalyptic
[37:21.080 --> 37:23.960]  to have Biden vacationing while this is going on.
[37:23.960 --> 37:24.960]  Right.
[37:24.960 --> 37:32.920]  And you know, Kennedy tried to de-escalate the most of his advisors on the executive
[37:32.920 --> 37:39.960]  committee except for Adley Stevenson here in the state of Illinois and under Secretary
[37:39.960 --> 37:46.960]  of State, George Ball, who was a friend of mine, tried to restrain everyone else on
[37:46.960 --> 37:53.280]  the executive committee from invading Cuba that would have set off a nuclear war.
[37:53.280 --> 37:54.280]  That's right.
[37:54.280 --> 37:57.680]  LLM, Sir Curtis LeMay, all them wanted to go to full war.
[37:57.680 --> 37:58.680]  That's correct.
[37:58.680 --> 38:01.640]  And it would have very quickly become a nuclear war.
[38:01.640 --> 38:02.640]  Yes.
[38:02.640 --> 38:08.280]  Well, who's, who's, who's restrained on Biden, indeed, who's really home there with Biden?
[38:08.280 --> 38:14.280]  I regret to say, I think Biden is in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's.
[38:14.280 --> 38:15.280]  I agree.
[38:15.280 --> 38:18.000]  So let's go up this ladder here because you bring this up and now the Russians are bringing
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  up the ladder.
[38:19.000 --> 38:25.040]  So you've got one up to 20 peaceful and quotes worldwide embargo blockade.
[38:25.040 --> 38:30.080]  Then we move to local nuclear war, which Labirau that others are saying is next, then declaration
[38:30.080 --> 38:32.240]  of limited nuclear war.
[38:32.240 --> 38:37.880]  And then we've got local nuclear war, military, unusual, provocative, and significant counter
[38:37.880 --> 38:45.800]  measures, evacuation, 26 demonstration of attack on zone of interior.
[38:45.800 --> 38:49.760]  Well that we've kind of skipped ahead with all these cruise missile attacks inside Russia.
[38:49.760 --> 38:52.280]  How big of a provocation is that in the last month?
[38:52.280 --> 38:56.960]  Just like they've kind of skipped ahead here to internal provocations in Russia.
[38:56.960 --> 39:07.800]  Well, again, yes, it does appear they're trying to provoke Russia into a more substantial
[39:07.800 --> 39:10.280]  military action against them.
[39:10.280 --> 39:18.880]  We have to understand whatever the Ukrainian military is doing today has been green lighted
[39:18.880 --> 39:22.840]  by the Pentagon and the Biden administration.
[39:22.840 --> 39:31.720]  And all these attacks into Russia itself rely on US GPS coordination.
[39:31.720 --> 39:38.240]  So the Russians know this, they've even said this, that basically it's the Americans using
[39:38.240 --> 39:44.720]  the Ukrainians to engage in direct tax against Russia.
[39:44.720 --> 39:52.680]  And the Bidenites, if you read the news media, have made it clear that they don't believe
[39:52.680 --> 39:57.480]  that the Russians are serious about any of their red lines.
[39:57.480 --> 40:03.880]  And so they are going to keep pushing up this ladder of escalation, which makes it extremely
[40:03.880 --> 40:05.480]  existentially dangerous.
[40:05.480 --> 40:10.560]  So why would the Pentagon and NATO openly be running the attacks, coordinating them,
[40:10.560 --> 40:16.120]  and trying to escalate Russia to a full military commitment?
[40:16.120 --> 40:26.440]  The Pentagon believes we have escalation dominance at every ladder, at every rung of that ladder
[40:26.440 --> 40:28.880]  that we can control and dominate.
[40:28.880 --> 40:34.800]  So they're pushing and tricking the Russians into pulling into polling and invading Russia,
[40:34.800 --> 40:35.800]  but in reverse.
[40:35.800 --> 40:43.160]  Well, again, it's the lessons learned from the Cuban Missile Crisis, which I think were
[40:43.160 --> 40:45.280]  the wrong lessons.
[40:45.280 --> 40:50.720]  But that's by Thomas Schelling of Harvard ahead of me in the government department,
[40:50.720 --> 40:57.000]  his arms and influence, where Schelling talked about compelence, namely during the Cuban
[40:57.000 --> 41:04.920]  Missile Crisis, we had escalation dominance all up that ladder of escalation.
[41:04.920 --> 41:13.520]  And therefore, because of this escalation dominance at every stage, eventually we compelled
[41:13.520 --> 41:14.520]  Khrushchev to back down.
[41:14.520 --> 41:16.560]  But let's look at those maps.
[41:16.560 --> 41:18.000]  We totally destroy Russia.
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.760]  We just lose half our cities.
[41:19.760 --> 41:21.240]  There's a pyrrhic victory.
[41:21.240 --> 41:26.120]  So in their ladder of dominance, they win, but America gets destroyed.
[41:26.120 --> 41:28.160]  That is very sick.
[41:28.160 --> 41:37.960]  Well, I think they believe they can get the Russians to back down without coming to that.
[41:37.960 --> 41:47.160]  Again, when Khrushchev looked at the ICBM balance during the Cuban Missile Crisis, he
[41:47.160 --> 41:51.680]  concluded there was no way we could prevail here, and he backed down.
[41:51.680 --> 41:57.120]  So that's, I believe, the way the Pentagon is looking at now, from the perspective of
[41:57.120 --> 42:05.240]  Kahn's ladder of escalation, their doctrine of escalation dominance, and Schelling's game
[42:05.240 --> 42:06.240]  theory.
[42:06.240 --> 42:11.280]  So this is next level Russian roulette with the whole world?
[42:11.280 --> 42:12.280]  That's the way I see it.
[42:12.280 --> 42:21.120]  As I remember, at the very height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the CIA set up a U-2 over
[42:21.120 --> 42:25.760]  there to provoke them.
[42:25.760 --> 42:28.400]  The Soviets shot it down.
[42:28.400 --> 42:36.760]  And instead of overreacting, Kennedy continued with his back channel diplomacy with Khrushchev
[42:36.760 --> 42:43.920]  through his brother and ambassador, Joe Breeden, saying, quote, there's always some son of
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.880]  a bitch down the line who doesn't get the word, unquote.
[42:48.880 --> 42:55.560]  So Alex, in this game of Russian roulette, something can always go wrong.
[42:55.560 --> 42:57.400]  Someone does not get the word.
[42:57.400 --> 42:58.400]  That's right.
[42:58.400 --> 42:59.400]  Let's talk about how to end this peacefully.
[42:59.400 --> 43:00.400]  Right there.
[43:00.400 --> 43:02.240]  There is a war on for your mind.
[43:02.240 --> 43:04.040]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[43:04.040 --> 43:06.240]  This is an information war.
[43:06.240 --> 43:10.760]  M-Full Wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[43:10.760 --> 43:16.240]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all
[43:16.240 --> 43:22.040]  using the terms that M-Full Wars has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations
[43:22.040 --> 43:23.640]  and we know how to beat them.
[43:23.640 --> 43:24.960]  But we can't do it without funding.
[43:24.960 --> 43:29.640]  And we make it easy to fund with great products and power you and your immune system and your

[46:16.000 --> 46:21.600]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, it made
[46:21.600 --> 46:27.480]  any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support M-Full Wars despite the massive
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.960]  law fair being waged against M-Full Wars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign
[46:32.960 --> 46:37.840]  against M-Full Wars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that
[46:37.840 --> 46:42.540]  make their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps M-Full Wars on the
[46:42.540 --> 46:49.040]  air and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian
[46:49.040 --> 46:50.040]  oppression.
[46:50.040 --> 46:55.760]  Continue to do it, go to places like M-FullWarsStore.com, go to places like Save M-Full Wars, continue
[46:55.760 --> 47:02.040]  to keep M-Full Wars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[47:02.040 --> 47:14.640]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:14.640 --> 47:20.480]  Google his name, Dr. Francis A. Boyle, and find his dozens of amazing books, you really
[47:20.480 --> 47:21.480]  know how the world works.
[47:21.480 --> 47:24.920]  The last ten and a half minutes segment we have here on this Wednesday edition, I want
[47:24.920 --> 47:30.880]  to talk about the nature of the Anglo-American establishment and what they're going to do
[47:30.880 --> 47:35.040]  next, but I wanted to finish up with my questions with this.
[47:35.040 --> 47:38.540]  We look at this escalation ladder that we know the Pentagon still uses, we know the
[47:38.540 --> 47:43.400]  Rand Corporation developed and that now is being quoted in the news, once Dr. Boyle talked
[47:43.400 --> 47:48.520]  about it, we move up here from 1 to 20 where we're at right now, they're skipping ahead
[47:48.520 --> 47:54.680]  with some of the attacks inside Russia, 26, and we move up into formal declaration of
[47:54.680 --> 47:55.680]  general war.
[47:55.680 --> 47:58.400]  They're basically doing that now as Zelensky visiting.
[47:58.400 --> 48:06.880]  Slow motion counter property war, slow motion counter force war, constrained force reduction
[48:06.880 --> 48:11.800]  salvo, constrained disarming attack, oh we just got an attack to stop their offensive.
[48:11.800 --> 48:18.640]  Counter force with abundance attack, unmodified counter force attack, and now they're really
[48:18.640 --> 48:19.640]  bad ones.
[48:19.640 --> 48:28.160]  Slow motion and it goes on with augmenting disarming attacks, civilian devastation attack
[48:28.160 --> 48:33.960]  when they hit our cities, some other kinds of control general war, spasm of intense war,
[48:33.960 --> 48:37.680]  we just nuke everything, they nuke everything and it's just fire everything, total insanity,
[48:37.680 --> 48:40.480]  kind of end of the world as we know it.
[48:40.480 --> 48:44.240]  Most estimates even say a limited nuclear war will cause a breakdown of civilization
[48:44.240 --> 48:45.240]  and kill billions.
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.760]  A total nuclear war, I think probably 7 billion, there'll be a billion people left maybe.
[48:49.760 --> 48:53.280]  Dr. Boyle, your comments on this ladder of escalation.
[48:53.280 --> 49:00.320]  Alex, that's the Pentagon's war plan for Ukraine right now as we speak.
[49:00.320 --> 49:06.960]  I believe that's their draft war plan and that's what they plan to do there at the
[49:06.960 --> 49:11.440]  Pentagon and the Bidenites will sign off on it.
[49:11.440 --> 49:20.080]  Moving up those stages of escalation, pursuant to their theory of escalation dominance, that
[49:20.080 --> 49:26.640]  they have escalation dominance, until the Russians back down, that's the way they see
[49:26.640 --> 49:27.640]  it.
[49:27.640 --> 49:30.320]  Explain escalation dominance for folks that haven't studied this.
[49:30.320 --> 49:35.320]  In layman's terms, they believe every step of the escalation, quote, the US will be in
[49:35.320 --> 49:39.440]  charge and controlling it, even though it'll be totally destructive to both sides.
[49:39.440 --> 49:43.280]  They believe they're going to come out in the end on top, which is what Dr. Strangelub
[49:43.280 --> 49:48.080]  is all about based on some real events and some real battle plans of where the Pentagon
[49:48.080 --> 49:52.240]  and Kurtle, Salman, and Lemonser tried to push a nuclear war to Kennedy saying it'll
[49:52.240 --> 49:53.240]  be survivable.
[49:53.240 --> 49:57.040]  Yeah, we'll lose 30, 40 million Americans, but we'll win in the end.
[49:57.040 --> 49:59.560]  And he said, I'm not a mass murder.
[49:59.560 --> 50:02.160]  Alex, you're basically right.
[50:02.160 --> 50:08.120]  Again, I believe pursuant to their doctrine of escalation dominance, which goes back to
[50:08.120 --> 50:16.760]  Tom Schelling ahead of me at Harvard, that they believe they control every wrong of that
[50:16.760 --> 50:24.480]  ladder of escalation you see there by Khan, and that they believe that at some point,
[50:24.480 --> 50:27.760]  the Russians will back down and we will prevail.
[50:27.760 --> 50:32.640]  One of the Russians jump ahead, one of the Russians don't follow the ladder.
[50:32.640 --> 50:36.840]  Well, they very well might not, Alex.
[50:36.840 --> 50:45.360]  I really don't know, except my reading of the situation is that President Putin and
[50:45.360 --> 50:50.760]  not to defend Putin at all, I've been up against Putin, too.
[50:50.760 --> 51:01.000]  He's very cautious and moves one step at a time throughout this entire crisis, starting
[51:01.000 --> 51:10.440]  with the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Ukraine by Obama and Biden.
[51:10.440 --> 51:19.080]  Remember Obama put Biden in charge of the entire Ukraine project, and he has been in
[51:19.080 --> 51:22.600]  charge of it since then.
[51:22.600 --> 51:24.440]  How do we stop this?
[51:24.440 --> 51:32.080]  Well, I think, Alex, what we have to do is to go back to the pledge that Jim Baker gave
[51:32.080 --> 51:44.440]  to Soviet Commissar Gorbachev, namely that in return for Gorbachev agreeing to the reunification
[51:44.440 --> 51:51.240]  of Germany, NATO would not move even one inch to the east.
[51:51.240 --> 51:58.400]  That pledge was binding as a matter of international law, even though it wasn't in writing.
[51:58.400 --> 52:02.800]  And to his credit, Bush Sr. adhered to that pledge.
[52:02.800 --> 52:10.400]  It was then Clinton and the Democrats who came into power and wantonly violated that
[52:10.400 --> 52:11.400]  pledge.
[52:11.400 --> 52:19.120]  And let me point out here that the foreign policy guru and Stengali for the Democratic
[52:19.120 --> 52:26.560]  Party has been Brzezinski since the days of Jimmy Carter, and indeed the Jimmy Carter
[52:26.560 --> 52:35.240]  campaign when he was head of the trilateral commission there, paid for by David Rockefeller,
[52:35.240 --> 52:40.600]  and they co-opted Carter into the presidency.
[52:40.600 --> 52:48.360]  Then Bush Jr., under the influence of his neocons, publicly stated they wanted Ukraine
[52:48.360 --> 52:52.280]  and Georgia to join NATO.
[52:52.280 --> 53:01.160]  This precipitated the war by Georgia against Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia, and
[53:01.160 --> 53:11.400]  then the current crisis in Ukraine, Victoria Nuland, the infamous role that she played
[53:11.400 --> 53:15.280]  over there in promoting the coup d'etat.
[53:15.280 --> 53:20.520]  And now she is Biden's number three official in the State Department.
[53:20.520 --> 53:27.640]  So if you want proof that the neocons are in charge of what Biden's doing, Nuland is
[53:27.640 --> 53:28.640]  there.
[53:28.640 --> 53:33.200]  But why are we seeing the pope come out in the last six months three times, and even
[53:33.200 --> 53:38.000]  Kissinger three times, putting last week saying, we need a peace deal now, this is a nuclear
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  war, this is out of control, stop it.
[53:40.000 --> 53:46.520]  When even Kissinger, who is like the omnibudsman of their New World Order saying stop, is that
[53:46.520 --> 53:50.480]  some faint by him or does he really mean that, or why is he saying that?
[53:50.480 --> 53:58.480]  Well, again, I think it's because they have the same sources that I do and realize how
[53:58.480 --> 54:01.000]  existentially dangerous it is.
[54:01.000 --> 54:06.840]  But to get back to how to end it, then the United States government already promised
[54:06.840 --> 54:13.600]  that Ukraine would not join NATO and that Ukraine would remain neutral.
[54:13.600 --> 54:18.320]  And then they sent, and then they sent the Kamala Harris there two months ago to say,
[54:18.320 --> 54:22.640]  oh, they are going to join, which is another provocation.
[54:22.640 --> 54:24.200]  Of course, sure.
[54:24.200 --> 54:29.080]  That's why Zelensky came all the way over here, and they brought Zelensky over here
[54:29.080 --> 54:37.440]  and gave him Congress and all the mainstream news media to promote further escalation up
[54:37.440 --> 54:38.440]  that letter.
[54:38.440 --> 54:45.880]  But to get back to my point, it seems to me, looking at the situation, that if the United
[54:45.880 --> 54:54.080]  States government were to agree that Ukraine would not join NATO and could remain neutral,
[54:54.080 --> 54:55.080]  that would de-escalate.
[54:55.080 --> 54:58.600]  Well, that was Putin's only thing he asked for before he invaded.
[54:58.600 --> 54:59.600]  You're right.
[54:59.600 --> 55:05.280]  And as a matter of fact, I've read the two treaties that Russia tendered to the Biden
[55:05.280 --> 55:08.520]  administration and to NATO.
[55:08.520 --> 55:16.040]  And the core obligation they wanted was a commitment in writing, unlike this verbal commitment
[55:16.040 --> 55:22.320]  given to Gorbachev, that Ukraine would not join NATO.
[55:22.320 --> 55:30.120]  And yet, all the public sources indicate that the Bidenites refused, absolutely refused,
[55:30.120 --> 55:33.040]  to negotiate this core demand.
[55:33.040 --> 55:38.160]  So let's close on that gut level for your children and grandchildren, Dr. Boyle.
[55:38.160 --> 55:42.920]  I mean, a lot of mainline political analysts say, great, it's dangerous nuclear war, ever.
[55:42.920 --> 55:47.560]  I mean, what is your prognosis for the short and midterm right now?
[55:47.560 --> 55:53.760]  Well, Alex, that's why I drafted my bill of impeachment against Biden.
[55:53.760 --> 56:02.200]  Right now it is in circulation on Capitol Hill among the Republican House Freedom Caucus.
[56:02.200 --> 56:09.760]  One congressman I had a 30-minute discussion with, he agreed fully with my analysis of
[56:09.760 --> 56:18.320]  the situation, including the con ladder of escalation, and said he was inclined to introduce
[56:18.320 --> 56:22.080]  my bill of impeachment into Congress.
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.520]  So we'll have to see what happens after January 3.
[56:26.520 --> 56:33.080]  But I think if my bill, and there'll be other bills being of impeachment introduced against
[56:33.080 --> 56:39.040]  Biden, indeed, Biden has hired an entire team of lawyers to deal with these bills of impeachment.
[56:39.040 --> 56:46.960]  But if my bill is introduced and passed, I believe that will paralyze the Biden administration.
[56:46.960 --> 56:48.560]  They'll be dead in the water.
[56:48.560 --> 56:49.560]  Exactly.
[56:49.560 --> 56:52.840]  And Republicans can win major points and save the world, but they won't because they're
[56:52.840 --> 56:54.840]  being financed by the same corporations.
[56:54.840 --> 56:57.160]  I think they can survive a nuclear war.
[56:57.160 --> 57:00.880]  This is just total madness, because let's not blame it all on Democrats.
[57:00.880 --> 57:02.120]  I know you're not.
[57:02.120 --> 57:05.880]  The Republicans are just going along with this because they're bought off too.
[57:05.880 --> 57:11.520]  Well, there were large numbers of Republicans, and I'm a political independence, there were
[57:11.520 --> 57:16.080]  large numbers of Republicans who did not show up for these bills.
[57:16.080 --> 57:17.080]  No, no, no.
[57:17.080 --> 57:18.080]  I agree.
[57:18.080 --> 57:19.080]  The Republicans are by the Democrats.
[57:19.080 --> 57:22.320]  I'm just saying some of the Republican leadership's going along with this, because they could
[57:22.320 --> 57:23.800]  get the impeachment going right now.
[57:23.800 --> 57:28.000]  They have the House, and you know, Jim Jordan's saying, oh, we're thinking about hearings
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.320]  on big tech censorship.
[57:29.320 --> 57:30.320]  You're thinking about it?
[57:30.320 --> 57:31.320]  I mean...
[57:31.320 --> 57:32.320]  Right.
[57:32.320 --> 57:36.800]  No, I mean, this is long beyond the stage of thinking about anything.
[57:36.800 --> 57:42.160]  We have to have the House pass a bill of impeachment, send it right away to the Senate
[57:42.160 --> 57:43.160]  for a trial.
[57:43.160 --> 57:44.160]  Dr. Boyle, I know you're going to go.
[57:44.160 --> 57:45.160]  Two-minute break.
[57:45.160 --> 57:49.840]  Come back and finish up in closing comments, and we'll talk about your books.
[57:49.840 --> 57:54.520]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school, and they had great effects.
[57:54.520 --> 57:58.240]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.480]  And now, with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water, and the food, and the
[58:02.480 --> 58:07.400]  feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost
[58:07.400 --> 58:08.640]  our natural male potential.
[58:08.640 --> 58:11.040]  But these products work great for women as well.
[58:11.040 --> 58:13.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[58:13.040 --> 58:15.880]  It's the number one natural bestseller under another name.

[58:25.240 --> 58:26.480]  Be very safe with it.
[58:26.480 --> 58:29.760]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first, and take it before you go to bed at
[58:29.760 --> 58:30.760]  night.
[58:30.760 --> 58:32.240]  Don't do it during the day.

[58:53.960 --> 58:59.120]  of InfoWare's under a new brand name, InfoWare's Platinum.

[59:03.840 --> 59:08.880]  one bestsellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[59:08.880 --> 59:12.920]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've
[59:12.920 --> 59:18.800]  given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under
[59:18.800 --> 59:20.840]  other names.
[59:20.840 --> 59:25.680]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other
[59:25.680 --> 59:27.880]  major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[59:27.880 --> 59:32.440]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[59:32.440 --> 59:34.320]  We're talking about Payne MD.
[59:34.320 --> 59:37.000]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.880]  We're talking about 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[59:39.880 --> 59:41.480]  These things are incredible.
[59:41.480 --> 59:45.360]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less what you first do, and consult your health
[59:45.360 --> 59:51.360]  care provider, those are so powerful, get them at InfoWareStore.com.
[59:51.360 --> 59:57.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[59:57.640 --> 01:00:04.280]  It is such a blessing.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.040]  It is such an honor.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:12.960]  You've backed us to this point that we're now on air with you on Friday, December 23,
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:18.240]  2022, able to cover whatever we want, despite the fact that deep state is fighting around
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.240]  the clock.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.240]  Shut us down.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:26.080]  Well, I've talked a lot about Senator Frank Church's hearings in the late 1970s, and
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:31.960]  now suddenly Elon Musk is, that's a really positive good thing that's going on.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:37.960]  And on August 17, 1975, Senator Frank Church appeared on NBC's Meet the Press, an issue
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:43.680]  to start warning about a certain technology perfected by the intelligence community, which
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:48.160]  should be used by the U.S. government against its own citizens to create total tyranny.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:55.800]  He was talking about the NSA and the Spigreds, and now here it is.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:01.160]  It's only got, at the time I printed this off an hour ago, 809,000 views.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.440]  It needs a billion views, but we now know they spy on us.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.320]  We now know the FBI surveillance.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:13.080]  We now know they work against the elections and the American people for their aim.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.320]  It was their aim.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.680]  Human empowerment, space exploration, free energy, no, pedophilia, open borders, collapsed
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.760]  governments, Hollywood scum.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:33.320]  If good people were using this technology, I would oppose it because it could be turned
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.440]  for evil.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.720]  But they don't leave any question about their aims.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.560]  They don't leave any discussion about their end game.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.560]  They admit their whole plan is the end of our families and the end of the normal human
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:54.200]  operation so they can play God as mad scientist and program every facet of our lives.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:02:02.480]  So I say Fauci, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, King Charles, all of you, we've got your challenge.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.760]  We understand how real it is and we take the challenge and we tell you, you will destroy
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:12.600]  us or we will destroy you at Nuremberg, too, where you will pay for the crimes that you
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.600]  have committed.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:20.080]  So listeners, realize the power you have today and share the links to m4wars.com, forward
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:26.640]  slash show, demand a video and share this video everywhere you can of Senator Frank
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:32.160]  Church from the grave, exposing this incredible tyranny.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:36.760]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the enemy wishes this didn't exist.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.680]  Let me tell you this.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:49.000]  In the need to develop a capacity to know what potential enemies are doing, the United
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:58.240]  States government has perfected a technological capability that enables us to monitor the
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.040]  messages that go through the air.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:10.560]  These messages are between ships at sea, they could be between military units in the field.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:20.040]  We have a very extensive capability of intercepting messages wherever they may be in the airwaves.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:27.320]  Now that is necessary and important to the United States as we look abroad at enemies
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.740]  or potential enemies.
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.240]  We must know.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:37.600]  At the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around on the American people.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:42.720]  And no American would have any privacy left such as the capability to monitor everything,
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.760]  telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:55.360]  There would be no place to hide if this government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.720]  took charge in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:08.960]  given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:17.520]  And there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to combine together
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:22.800]  in resistance to the government no matter how privately it was done is within the reach
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:28.160]  of the government to know such is the capability of this technology.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.040]  Now why is this investigation important?
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.800]  I'll tell you why.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:36.040]  Because I don't want to see this country ever go across the bridge.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:43.160]  I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:48.120]  And we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:55.840]  operate within the law and under proper supervision so that we never cross over that abyss.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.240]  That's the abyss from which there is no return.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.800]  It's a post COVID world now.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.560]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.800]  There's a solution.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800]  The wellness company.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.080]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the chief scientific officer.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:18.080]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.560]  appears on demand.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:25.720]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies in home, in vitro diagnostics,
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:31.840]  laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:39.200]  your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post COVID syndromes, vaccine
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:46.560]  injury syndromes and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.120]  world that we're living in.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:54.880]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:20.160]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this special Friday
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.160]  edition.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:26.240]  I've been on with us for three, four months because he's been so incredibly busy already
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.920]  expanding his huge operation.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.040]  Tyler Bennett is a respected tax lawyer.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:37.120]  He's got hundreds of lawyers and CPAs and other crew working under him.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.880]  He's who gives me advice on my taxes, but he's not just here about taxes today.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:47.240]  Now you can protect yourself and why it's so critical in the last week of December to
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:50.840]  make decisions you may have forgotten about or not known about.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.360]  But I've been trying to get him on for four months.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:58.160]  He's been so busy with other companies and trust companies and things they were acquiring
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.160]  that he couldn't come on.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.160]  But he's finally here.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.000]  And I was talking to him last week and I said, please come on in January.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.080]  And he said, actually, I'll come on right now because your listeners need to know the
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.640]  last week of December is so key.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:12.600]  So we're going to get to that upfront by Christmas present to you.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.600]  And he's a great sponsor.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.800]  So you support the show, you save a lot of money.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.120]  It's so easy to do.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.120]  It's a 360 win.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.560]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.240]  But I wanted to get him on about taxes and the 70 plus thousand new IRS agents that Biden's
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.240]  is tired.
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.240]  He said, listen, that's fine.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.240]  I'll get into that.
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:34.640]  But let's talk about Sam Bakeman freed.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.360]  Let's talk about the economy.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.560]  Let's talk about these other big issues.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:44.400]  So he's got the inside baseball on that we're going to hit next segment and the 70 plus
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.040]  thousand new IRS agents and so much more.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:52.280]  So the easiest way to find them is jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:57.680]  It goes to their main website, American Tax Relief or their other side is even easier
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.680]  to remember.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.400]  We'll give that to you in a moment.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.000]  But regardless, they're great sponsors.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.320]  So please use the URL that takes you right to their site, jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:11.600]  So out of the gates, let's get right to all the new tax law changes.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.400]  The elites use, they don't want the public to know about the incredible things you can
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:20.120]  do at year end, so many people think it's too late to do that are such easy moves to
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:25.400]  make with a law firm behind them, meaning when you follow what they're saying and you
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:29.360]  have a letter from them and you do it, that means it's authorized, it's protected and
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:35.200]  they know you've got backing, which means his 70 plus thousand new IRS agents on average
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.760]  will move on to an easier target.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.720]  Tyler Bennett, is that an accurate statement?
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.320]  That is accurate, Alex.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.640]  And thanks for having me on again.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.480]  Merry Christmas to both you, your family and the viewers.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.160]  The thing is at the end of the year, right, Fortune 500 companies know this is the time
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:58.680]  to come up with deductions because after January 1st, any money you've spent is now in next
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.360]  year, not this year, right?
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:04.360]  So if you want to be able to take deductions for this year, you've got nine days before
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.960]  the end of the year to do it.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.600]  That's why it's crucial to act now.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:14.360]  So let's talk about Fortune 500 companies, wash sales, even in securities, everybody
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:18.720]  sells their stocks in December and buys it back in January so they can take a lot, excuse
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:24.000]  me, at the end of the year to take a loss that they can generate against their income.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.520]  Every December, that's what happens.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.840]  If you're in crypto, there is no reason not to be doing this because next year, this will
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.360]  no longer be legal to do, right?
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.440]  And so the laws are changing in 2023.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:38.120]  That's a huge change.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.920]  You've got to make sure that we take these deductions now.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.520]  Another example is for all the small business owners out there, if you have a flow through
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:50.160]  entity or anything like that, your last chance to make sure that you're able to take the
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:55.760]  20% flow through deduction, which is a 20% deduction of all your income that's qualified
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.120]  small business income, that's substantial, right?
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:03.760]  Is on, we have to make sure you are set up by that by the end of this year, otherwise
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:06.800]  you'll be setting it up for it next year, which is great, but we want to make sure we
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.680]  gave you all these savings this year, right?
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.680]  That's what it's all about.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:14.840]  So we got to act now while it's still 2022, before it's 2023.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:19.720]  Now here's another major thing is the IRS has been really gung-ho and you know this,
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:26.040]  you've read the news, you've heard that Uber drivers and people who sell stuff on eBay and
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:32.720]  even hell, if you had split dinner with your friends, we know that the IRS is going hardcore
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:38.760]  on the $600 requirement of money being transferred on any of these money apps or anything like
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.200]  that, Etsy, Venmo, PayPal, the like.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:48.960]  And the thing is, is just like the American government, you are guilty until proven innocent.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:55.360]  And if you make the wrong choice and say, hey, this is for my friends and it was actually
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:59.160]  something that you received payment for, well, now you've committed perjury, right?
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:03.880]  So the name of the game here is you cannot break the law.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.800]  That is never going to work in your favor.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.920]  What we can do is use the law towards our benefits to make sure you're paying the least
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:11.920]  amount of taxes.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.320]  And explain that to people.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.400]  When you have a real tax firm with real lawyers that don't just sit there and milk you like
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:21.360]  so many tax firms I've used before, that gives you the knowledge, cuts right to the chase,
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.200]  gives you a great deal, and then just basically gets paid a percentage of the savings, it's
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.560]  all done, it's all easy.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.960]  This is not rocket science.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.320]  The elites all use these rules for themselves.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.160]  They don't want the general public to have it, which is why they change the tax laws every
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.160]  couple of years.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.160]  And I did make a mistake.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.920]  And when I do it, I apologize.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.280]  I said 76,000.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:44.040]  I'm sorry, it's 87,000 new IRS agents.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.040]  I apologize.
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.040]  Keep going.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:50.520]  It's 87,000, Alex, that is correct.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:54.560]  And the thing is this is so you remember, we talked about this before, there's that box
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.800]  on your 1040 that says, do I have any digital assets?
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.760]  And they're including now commodities, gold and silver in this question as well.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:08.340]  Because they're realizing that a lot of people due to crypto and other means have been under
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.200]  reporting their income.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:15.640]  And what I am telling you is if you fall into this category, you stand to benefit a thousand
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:19.360]  percent by coming out of that hole yourself.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:23.240]  And we can make sure you're paying the least amount of taxes legally.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:28.080]  Even if the IRS uses one of these new 87,000 people to knock on your door, because when
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.480]  they knock on your door, they're going to hand you a business card and they're going
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.480]  to have a gun in their holster.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.080]  And at that point, you're already in trouble.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.600]  Folks that don't know, you go to these other big tax preparing places, they're literally
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.360]  screwing you on purpose.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.360]  They're not standing up.
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.040]  But a real tax firm like you does that.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.560]  It's so easy for basically almost everybody, whether it's somebody who's a billionaire
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.880]  or makes $50,000 a year, you need to know these tactics.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:54.920]  It makes me so upset that folks don't understand how easy this is to do.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.920]  That's right, Alex.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.960]  And of course, as we all know, this in this country, this was a system that was designed
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.800]  to keep the club, the rich elitists in power at the expense of everybody else, right?
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:11.480]  And knowledge, knowledge is the biggest thing between the upper class and everybody else.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:16.280]  So we're trying to spread that knowledge because the rules are out there for you to use.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:21.360]  It does not matter if you are a small mom and pop or a multi-billion dollar corporation.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:26.440]  There are tax rules and tax codes that you can use that make sure you're paying the least
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:30.680]  amount in taxes as possible because that is your right as a taxpayer.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:35.240]  And if you remember, we talked about before last year and the year before the IRS has
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:41.500]  made more money than ever before because post COVID, a lot of people started small businesses
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.320]  where they were wage earning employees before.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:48.240]  And now they're not privy to the amount of deductions that they can take.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.440]  And this is who I want, you guys right now that had small businesses that you started
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.840]  this year or last year, you overpaid the IRS.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.040]  Let's not make sure, let's make sure you don't overpay the IRS this year.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:04.600]  You got nine days to make sure that we're filing correctly, that we have the flow through
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.680]  and the entity set up if we need to separate the entities into a C corporation because
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.320]  you're making too much money or we need to do the 20% flow through.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:17.960]  These are all options available, but we need to take advantage of them now before 2023
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.680]  because in 2023, guess what?
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.840]  Then we'll be doing it for 2023, not this year.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:25.600]  So we got to act now because you stand to save a lot of money before the end of the
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.600]  year.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.320]  Again, folks, this is a sure win.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.280]  So many things out there that say they're sure wins are frauds.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:36.120]  If you know the tax law, have real tax lawyers that look at what you have and cut right to
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.240]  the best deal for you in almost every case, unless you're already being advised, great,
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.560]  or most people aren't, you're going to save money.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.760]  The Bible says the people perish for lack of knowledge and it really does go down to
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:52.000]  that and it makes me so frustrated that like, oh, if you have vitamin D, you're taking three
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.800]  times of your daily allowance, the studies show you almost can't get a viral infection.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:01.440]  Some studies say you can't, but it's like magic, but people just don't know what a
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:07.200]  sure thing vitamin D3 is or the sure thing of using the tax code that the system is using
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:10.640]  for itself doesn't want you to have.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.640]  Correct Alex.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:15.400]  And the thing is, like you said before, they make sure that they change the tax code.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.600]  Really it changes with the regime.
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.680]  So every four years or so, the tax code changes on average.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:25.360]  And when we're talking about overhauls of the tax code, they change everything.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.880]  So we haven't even seen the full ramifications of the Democrats tax overhaul.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:35.640]  The last overhaul was the Republican one, right, which is giving us all these options
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:41.960]  that we're able to use in grandfather UNs before Biden changes the law, which the acts
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:47.080]  are already in Congress and make the tax rates higher and make it harder for you to take
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.080]  deductions.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.080]  That's right.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.080]  Everybody should call your folks.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.520]  Everybody should talk to you and do a consultation.
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.520]  It's so important.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:59.520]  Go there now, ladies and gentlemen, jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:05.440]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.800]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.880]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.240]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.680]  Your ability to speak freely.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.640]  So they're going to go from Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon,
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.320]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.480]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.480]  all of this.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.480]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.760]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.920]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:37.400]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:41.080]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.760]  because of your past support.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.560]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:50.960]  free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.960]  on air.

[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:05.720]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing Info Wars, attacking myself and
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.720]  the crew and our other hosts?
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.560]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.280]  They know we're telling the truth.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.840]  They know we've got their number.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.600]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.360]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.480]  stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:31.520]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:40.200]  like preglonone and so much more to supercharge your body and to give your body the key elements
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.160]  and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.120]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:55.560]  This is Real Red Pill Plus, sold out for two years, 50% off at infowarstore.com.

[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.560]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.320]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.560]  This is an information war.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:11.360]  Info Wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago, and today, whether it's Donald
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:18.080]  Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that Info Wars
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:22.320]  has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320]  them.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.320]  But we can't do it without funding.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.840]  And we make it easy to fund with great products that empower you and your immune system and
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:29.840]  your family as well.

[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:38.360]  We're nonviolent.
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:41.320]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:46.760]  here, you are literally, nonviolently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose, punching

[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.640]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.640]  We're going over the top.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.280]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:59.160]  So please go to infowarstore.com and donate now, donate now, donate now, donate now.

[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.120]  Well, so do I.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:08.200]  And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist and I've
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.560]  got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:15.040]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:19.520]  And the good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.360]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.200]  to back down and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.880]  So please keep me on the field, keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:33.440]  great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:44.520]  fight, not part of it going towards product cost.

[01:19:52.760 --> 01:20:00.880]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:08.880]  Including a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:23.160]  Well, it's almost Christmas, 2022, almost at 23, hard to believe.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:29.000]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday, December 23rd, worldwide transmission.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.360]  Tyler Bennett's here, who's really a financial expert and amazing lawyer, and I want to get
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:38.280]  into the new developments that happened yesterday with him making bail and what that means is
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.920]  about to roll over on him.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:44.280]  So is his girlfriend and so much more finally flown back to the United States for the Bahamas.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:49.040]  I want to get into the rest of the economy and the Ukraine war and everything with Tyler
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.040]  Bennett.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:55.000]  But you need to go to jonestaxrelief.com or getataxlawyer.com.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.800]  It's GATL.com, GATL.com, just make sure you tell them Alex Jones sent you so we get the
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:12.200]  sponsorship and the support, GATL.com, 360 win or give them a call, 833-900-4285-833-900.

[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:22.320]  on, then find out what they can do for you and then sign up with them and it is a win-win
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:27.400]  across the board before we get into the whole situation with cryptocurrency and sandbake
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.080]  and free and the rest of it.
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:32.480]  What other services are you guys offering right now and why is the last few days in December
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.640]  so critical?
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:39.520]  So the last few days in December is critical because this is your last time to take any
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:43.320]  deductions that could be used for this year in 2022.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:49.320]  If you spend money on January 1st, even if it's for your business, that's 2023 deductions,
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.320]  right?
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.560]  If you want to be able to write off stuff in 2022, we need to make, especially if you
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.640]  already spent the money, we need to be able to make note of that and make sure we have
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:03.800]  it properly allocated and that your, first of all, your whole entire entity structure
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.200]  is the right way because-
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.480]  And by the way, here's an example.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.800]  I'm in personal bankruptcy because all the attacks and the rest of it and so I've had
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.920]  an outside great accounting firm to come in and they go, Mr. Jones, do you realize the
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:22.160]  last six, seven years when you use an American Express card for the company, for trips, hotels,
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:29.480]  flights and food and everything, do you realize that your accountants never counted that as
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:32.640]  a deduction and passed it on as a corporate draw to you?
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:38.560]  So we're now learning millions of dollars, millions of dollars on my American Express
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:42.600]  that I paid for was for trips and journalism and things we did because it wasn't just me,
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:46.880]  they had a bunch of cards under me and that's an example of me using a mainline accounting
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:50.920]  CPA firm that didn't even look at it and I just thought they would.
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.920]  You guys will.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.880]  That yes, that's a great example, Alex, because this happens to a lot of people is, hey, I've
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.000]  got a business but I end up using a different card that's not in the business name to use
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.600]  for business expenses.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.480]  That doesn't mean that it's no longer a business expense.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.960]  It needs to be properly accounted, right?
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.200]  And sometimes you have to go through the accounts and do what's called a forensic accounting
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:14.080]  on every single thing and make sure what is a business expense and what's not because
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:18.840]  I always go back to remember you're right as a taxpayer is to not pay a dime more than
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:23.920]  you owe and you only owe your income subtract your deductions and that's why the IRS made
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:27.640]  so much money last year because everyone did it wrong and overpaid.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:32.040]  Do not overpay the government, trust me, they will not have the same feelings towards
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.040]  you.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.040]  By the way, I'm interrupting but slow down.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.040]  I saw that head on a month ago.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.760]  The IRS made the most money last year.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.480]  Why is that?
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:42.640]  So the reason the IRS made the most money last year and they also made the most money
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:47.800]  the year before as well is because what happened in 2020 with the COVID disaster is a lot of
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:53.160]  people lost their employment, their W2 paying jobs, their salary jobs and they had to start
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:54.480]  a small business.
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:58.240]  And because of the lack of education, they were working a job their whole time.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.720]  They don't know what deductions they can now take as a small business owner.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:08.400]  And so that's why I am here is let me, listen, I don't care what industry you're in.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:12.280]  My accounting staff can figure out the maximum amount of deductions that you can take this
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:19.960]  year for 2022 so that you don't make 22 again the most profitable year for the IRS as well.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:22.960]  Because listen, they're going to get their money starting 23.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.720]  I was at the IRS conference two weeks ago.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:32.320]  I spoke to Commissioner Redding and I spoke to the Deputy Commissioner of Collections.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.920]  And here's exactly what they told me.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.360]  They said we made so much money last year that we really didn't have to focus on collections
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:44.800]  but in 2023, we're putting the hammer down and we are coming after everybody very hard.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:50.400]  We've hired 87,000 people and specifically they said they're going after the crypto people
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:58.000]  the hardest because they know that the whole DeFi ecosystem is kind of created on, you
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.160]  know, not paying taxes.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.920]  So because that is the case, that's the people they want to hit the hardest the first.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:08.200]  And if you are involved at all in crypto, listen, I am as well.
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:13.440]  And so I tell you this as a friend, if you're involved in crypto, what you need to do is
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:17.960]  yes, there's a box on the 1040 that says, do you have any crypto assets?
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.200]  You check yes, because even if you're not making any money, it doesn't matter because
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.560]  what the IRS is going to do when they find out that you do have those assets and you
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.280]  said no, you committed perjury because you signed that tax return.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:36.600]  And that carries a much heftier fine than, oh, I underported some income that I later
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:38.520]  you know, fixed the issue and paid tax.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:40.600]  And notice how that ties into the raising interest rates.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.240]  They're getting ready to hammer the little guy next year.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.240]  Correct.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.320]  And that is the secret hidden tax is when they raise interest rates, they make money
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:55.800]  more expensive, everybody's got less of it and your tax rate is still the same, meaning
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:01.280]  the brackets, which means even if you get a small inflation adjustment at work, that
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:06.080]  could put you up into the next tax bracket because they raise tax brackets 4% this year,
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.960]  but inflation is 8% on average.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:13.160]  So, so really you're getting taxed about half of the rate of inflation.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.160]  Incredible.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.760]  Everybody needs to go to JonesTaxRelief.com or call 833-904-285.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.760]  You need to go there.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:23.280]  If JonesTaxRelief.com is too long for you, it is GATL.com.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:28.720]  Get a tax lawyer.com, American Tax Relief is here with us.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.440]  I want to get into Sam Bateman-Freed and him making bail and all this next segment.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:39.080]  But what other services do you have for people that aren't in a rush, but should call you
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:42.840]  and who think they're a normal tax lawyer or they're normal CPAs, tell them because
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.560]  in my experience, they don't tell you any of this.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.560]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.240]  So, we do three things, the past, the present, and the future, right?
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.760]  The present is your current tax filings.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.280]  We make sure for this year, you're paying the least amount of tax possible, whether that
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:01.840]  means forming an entity for you, forming a trust for you, other sorts of entity options,
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:06.640]  corporations, because the corporate tax code is the lowest in the entire country.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:11.440]  You as an individual, me as an individual, we pay more in taxes than corporations.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.560]  So corporate vehicles are great.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.720]  That's something we can help you out with.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.600]  The future is what we do now.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.240]  That's called tax planning.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.960]  That's saying, hey, I made X amount of dollars this year.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.760]  I plan on making more than that next year, but I don't want to pay overpay on taxes.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:31.200]  So let's get you set up in the right entity structuring and deductions and likewise so
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.160]  that at the end of the year, and when you make those quarterly estimated tax payments,
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:37.880]  it's not breaking the bank.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.680]  And then the last thing, yeah, the last thing we do is the past, right?
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:46.640]  And this is just reality is there's a lot of people out there that are already in the
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:51.880]  situation where they owe the IRS or they owe the state government more than they can afford
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.080]  to pay back.
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:57.440]  And the thing is this, if you just give the IRS a call or give the state a call, they're
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.880]  going to have their hand out and say, well, you want to pay us, pay us in full.
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:04.680]  But the reality situation is you have to realize you're dealing with the collection agency.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.440]  The IRS is the largest collection agency in the world.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:11.880]  And you know, if you deal with a regular collection agency, they will take less than you owe.
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:15.080]  Now the thing is, is they know that you're a lay person and they won't tell you that
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.840]  and they won't talk to you, but when they talk to a lawyer, a professional, a tax professional
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:23.880]  that deals with the IRS in general, like we do, we will be able to negotiate that sum
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:24.880]  for you.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:29.200]  And a lot of times you're able to negotiate it on average, what, 80%?
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:33.200]  It depends on everyone's situation, but we have many cases where we're able to lower
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.800]  it 80%, if not even more.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.400]  I know a lot 90.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.400]  Yeah.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.400]  So folks, you're insane.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:44.400]  If you don't go to jonestatcherleaf.com or 833-904-285, my Chris is present to you and
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:45.400]  the broadcast.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.400]  We help the viewers.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.400]  It funds the show.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.400]  We promote freedom.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.400]  Win-win.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:52.080]  Tyler Bennett straight ahead with the FDX scandal and more.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:59.520]  Stay with us.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:05.400]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:10.760]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.880]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.680]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.840]  So they're going to go from Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:20.320]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:24.440]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.440]  all of this.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.760]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:29.760]  your support.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:32.880]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:37.360]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:41.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.680]  because of your past support.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:46.480]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:50.920]  every double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us

[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:05.640]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing Info Wars, attacking myself and
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.680]  the crew and our other hosts?
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:11.840]  Because they know we're pro-human, they know we're telling the truth, they know we've
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:12.840]  got their number.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:17.600]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.

[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:25.440]  stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:31.480]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:36.880]  like preglonone and so much more to supercharge your body.

[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:30.240]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to this Friday edition of the broadcast.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.520]  Tyler Bennett's been so busy the last four months, he hasn't been able to come on, but
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:39.680]  he's here with GATL, getattaxlawyer.com, you want to support us, you're taking the same
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:46.440]  URL, JonesTaxRelief.com or 833-904285, they're a great sponsor, they're great tax lawyers
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:50.840]  and CPAs, and they cut right the chase, they don't rope you along and get a bunch of money
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:54.160]  out of you, they look at what they can save you and try to get a percentage of that.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:58.480]  This is a total win, everybody should be calling him from somebody that works at a restaurant
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:03.240]  or somebody that owns a car dealership to somebody that's worth $100 million.
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.040]  Most people are getting bad advice.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.440]  Now, you've got your ear to the ground, you're involved in stuff all over the country, all
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:12.920]  sorts of trusts and businesses, you name it, and you've been saying a lot of things that
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:17.520]  I've been following that have really come true with the whole FTX and same bankman fried
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.120]  and all the rest of it.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:22.400]  So what do you make of that ongoing scandal, the latest developments?
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:27.440]  Okay, Alex, see this is where everything comes full circle, right?
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:30.720]  And as I was saying to you before, there's that box you have to check on the 1040, do
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:32.400]  you have crypto assets or not?
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.160]  Well, everybody already filled that out for last year and the year before.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:41.880]  And here's the thing is when FTX went down and Sam Bankman Fried went down with it and
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:47.440]  he was in jail in the Bahamas, the reason that he didn't want to go to the United States
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:53.600]  is because he knew that to get a deal there, he's going to have to spill the beans on everybody
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:57.000]  that invested and did not report their income to the IRS.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.480]  And so the IRS is going to have a list of everybody that is an American investor that
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:05.640]  invested in FTX and did not disclose that information.
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:12.520]  And so, if that may have happened to you, we need to get a handle on that and fix the
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:19.320]  problem first because if we go to the IRS and we say, listen, we made a mistake, but
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:23.560]  we realized that we misreported something and report it, that's going to be treated
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:29.040]  a heck of a lot nicer than if the IRS finds out that we have willfully neglected to tell
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.880]  them about income information and they come to our door with a gun.
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.280]  Now we've committed a felony.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:39.760]  So when FTX went down and Sam Bankman Fried, who just paid $250 million this morning to
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:42.760]  get bailed out after he just got extradited, right?
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.480]  That just happened right now.
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:50.360]  I guarantee you, Alex, before he was bailed out, he went into a Department of Justice
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:55.920]  office where there was the criminal investigation of the IRS, there was the FBI and more and
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:59.640]  they made a deal with him and they said, look, Sam, you're 30 something, you're going to
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:03.240]  get out of jail when you're 80 or you're going to spill the beans on everyone who's
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:08.720]  been illegally hiding money and laundering money in the Bahamas through FTX.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:14.400]  And so that's where it comes full circle because like I was telling everybody, you got to not
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:20.560]  lie on that form because now even if you have just one Bitcoin or something in FTX and they
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:24.880]  get the information that you had that and you wrote on the tax return that you do not
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.920]  have any digital assets, you've committed perjury, you see?
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:30.760]  So that is why it's important.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:35.000]  And here's the thing, you might be big in crypto and you might say, hey, you know what?
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.400]  I'm not touched by this because I didn't have anything in FTX.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.160]  I'm over at Binance.
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:42.720]  Well, this is all turning into a chain reaction.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:45.600]  Oh, they're already talking about it, dining the Binance head.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:54.480]  Oh, yes, because what happened was the Binance guy, Zhang, he had $2.1 billion investment
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:37:02.120]  in FTX and Sam Bankman Fried paid him that $2.1 billion in FTX's coin in their crypto
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.120]  coin.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:07.560]  And so that's what started the whole collapse is this Zang guy who owns Binance then sold
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:08.560]  it all.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.560]  Okay.
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.920]  And what that means is that opened up the DOJ's eyes to, okay, well, what's Binance
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:14.920]  doing now?
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:20.840]  And what they are alleging is Binance, specifically not only was laundering money for the Mexican
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:27.520]  drug cartels, but also was giving money to Iran past American sanctions.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.680]  So these are the kinds of things that you don't want your money involved with because
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.920]  these types of people are going to go down for major.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:35.920]  Well, that's right.
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:38.160]  And all these people always say go offshore.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.480]  And number one, I know I'm a target number one, I don't commit crimes.
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.480]  I know the system's corrupt.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.400]  It's like the mafio will break your legs.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:48.240]  The way to do it is use their laws and their tricks to minimize everything way down instead
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:53.320]  of running off to the Caribbean, which you look at it statistically only Mitt Romney's
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.680]  allowed to have $100 million tax free.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:02.400]  Nobody else is only the very top 10 of one tenth of a percent are allowed to do that.
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.120]  We're little slaves.
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:08.600]  We don't get to do that, but we do get to use the tax law that the minions of the global
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:11.040]  issues because they avoid most of it.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.920]  The ultra elite don't pay taxes.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:16.320]  The minions of the power elite write the law to mitigate it.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:17.920]  We're going to copy what they do.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:18.920]  That's what we do.
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:19.920]  Correct.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.840]  And here's the thing too, Alex is I'm shocked as Sam Bankman Fried had made some really
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:30.080]  stupid moves, including basing this organization in the Bahamas in the first place.
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:33.360]  The Bahamas is not the island to be in if you're trying to hide from the U.S. government
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.360]  because they will extradite you clearly and they will take your money.
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:42.760]  As we found out, they're too closely related to the United States banking system.
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:47.400]  If you wanted to truly get off the out of the United States is per view, we'd have to
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:51.440]  go to the Cook Islands or or Nevis or someplace like that, right?
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:54.000]  But you can't go to the Bahamas straight up.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.840]  That is, there is too much, well, they're a factor compliant down there.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:02.720]  Their banks report what your earnings are to the IRS.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.800]  And so it's just not going to work.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.440]  It was a bad, it was a poor move from the beginning.
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:12.880]  But listen, this guy, like I said, these crypto guys aren't necessarily financed people until
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:13.960]  they become it.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.680]  And so listen, he made that mistake a long time ago.
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:21.480]  Me and my accounts here were saying, why did he choose to build this empire in the Bahamas
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:27.280]  as opposed to St. Kitts or the Marshall Islands or the Cook Islands or any other side of your
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.920]  offshore image surreal business?
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:34.120]  But to run a Ponzi scheme in the Bahamas, that's almost satirical.
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:37.520]  It's just, it's crazy.
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:38.720]  It is crazy.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:41.840]  And listen, he was running a Ponzi scheme.
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:46.520]  So right, that's, listen, that's, that's horrible in its own right.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:50.200]  But the Bahamas in general, if you're going to go offshore, listen, we got better places
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:51.840]  for you to go offshore.
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:56.240]  Don't do not do not do what this man did because he's going to go to jail for a long
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:03.760]  time or what's also likely is the amount of people and the amount of money that he is
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.840]  going to end up fingering.
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:06.840]  That's very dangerous too.
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:10.880]  Because a lot of these crypto guys that end up caught like this, they end up dead.
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:17.000]  I was about to say, we've had four Russian crypto guys killed the last month and Sam
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.040]  Bankman freed, end up abstained.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.040]  Exactly.
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:27.000]  And that's my, that is, that's what I guess is my estimation here is in the next couple
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.640]  months we may see him at the end of a shoelace.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:34.320]  And of course, oh, he killed himself, but we really know that they had to keep him quiet
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.320]  right?
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.320]  Because he knew too much.
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:37.320]  And that's, that's, we'll see what happens.
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:43.040]  I wonder what the Las Vegas betting market will be on Sam Bankman freed and how soon
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:44.840]  until he's dead.
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:51.600]  Yeah, well, I would, I would take the bet on, on, on under rather than over on that one.
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:52.720]  Because yes, you're right.
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.000]  There's everybody else in that industry, even John McAfee, when he started speaking out
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:02.080]  about crypto assets and different governments involved, suddenly he ended up dead too.
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:08.120]  And so it's, it's, you know, there's a lot of power and especially in the international
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:12.880]  monetary system where crypto exists as this kind of what they call DeFi, right?
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.480]  Where they're trying to get around the centralized banks, get around the government.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:21.120]  Well, the real people that are, that are making lots of money from this are criminals, either
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:25.720]  war criminals or drug criminals or some kind of person like that, right?
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:29.840]  And so if you're making money off of those people, you're going to go down.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:34.400]  And the thing is this is here's why I'm warning everybody is if you're even just involved when
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:38.520]  this stuff goes down, you're not going to go down for those crimes and they're going
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:42.040]  to get you for under reporting that crypto income and lying on your tax return.
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:48.480]  So that, those are things we can solve now before the IRS sends their 87,000 people to
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:56.720]  go after everyone on San Bakeman Freedman's list because the thing is, is crypto is all
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:59.040]  based on blockchain.
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:03.860]  It doesn't matter that IRS, when I went to the IRS's conference, they know how crypto
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:05.320]  tumblers work.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:10.720]  They know how all sorts of crazy DeFi apps work that are able, that purport to be able
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:13.960]  to separate the source of the money from the person.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:16.280]  They already know how it works and they've got it figured out.
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:19.440]  You cannot outsmart City Hall basically, right?
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:21.320]  They've got all the money and the resources in the world.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:24.160]  You've got to use City Hall's own trap doors.
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:25.160]  That's exactly right.
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:27.440]  So we use City Hall's rules against them.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.680]  You're playing by the rules and you'll come out ahead.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:36.400]  All right, folks, you've got to go to the website, jonestaxrelief.com, jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.920]  We'll put the number up on screen for you as well.

[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.440]  The only way you lose is not contacting them.
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:44.440]  833-904-285.
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:48.200]  I want to thank all the viewers that have been supporting this sponsor and getting great
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:49.200]  results.
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:52.240]  I've got about 99% positive results from the sponsor.
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:53.240]  You can't ask for better.
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:54.240]  Stay with us.
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:43:00.240]  You want to beat the new world order?
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.240]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.240]  Well, so do I.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:07.960]  And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist and I've
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.200]  got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:14.720]  But, ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:18.720]  And the good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:22.920]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:23.920]  going to back down.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:25.880]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:27.800]  So please keep me on the field.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:30.960]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:33.080]  that will empower you and your family.

[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:52.480]  Now take action.
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:44:00.160]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:05.080]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:11.080]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:12.080]  world.
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:17.080]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:18.080]  deserve the credit.
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:22.880]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support Infowarsscore are the
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:25.600]  real reason we've had the success.
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:30.360]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war we've ever
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.360]  had.
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:37.720]  We're now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:41.680]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:44.520]  efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:45.520]  God bless you all.
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:46.520]  I salute you.
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:47.520]  I thank you.
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:52.840]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:53.840]  is happening.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:54.840]  The fight is my fight.
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:55.840]  It's your fight.
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:56.840]  It's our fight.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:57.840]  God bless you all.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:02.680]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:07.440]  effects and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:12.200]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:16.680]  factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:17.880]  natural male potential.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:20.240]  But these products work great for women as well.
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:22.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:25.080]  It's the number one natural best seller under another name.

[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:35.680]  Be very safe with it.
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:39.360]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:41.320]  Don't do it during the day.
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:44.000]  1776 testosterone boost.

[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:22.120]  They've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:27.960]  given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:28.960]  other names.

[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:37.080]  major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:41.640]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.

[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:46.200]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:49.080]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.

[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:54.520]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less what you first do and consult your health
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.800]  care provider because they're so powerful.

[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:16.600]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:25.960]  All right, hour number three is coming up.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:26.960]  It's Friday.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:33.000]  Christmas is just day and a half, two days away, and Tyler Bennett of American Tax Relief
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  is here with us.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  Be sure to go to jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.920]  That takes you right through the main site, and then they know that it comes from us.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:47.400]  The sponsorship, a win-win for everybody, can also go to the toll free number, 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.640]  You wanted to get into Kanye.
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.400]  He was on the show a few weeks ago, and a week before that, he was on with Tim Pool.
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:53.400]  We're not going to play the clip.
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.120]  Everybody probably saw it or heard about it.
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:00.640]  He said, I'm $50 million in the whole of the IRS, and they grabbed $75 million out of my
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:01.640]  account.
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:04.920]  Well, believe me, with him, it's not a joke.
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:05.920]  It's not a game.
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:07.760]  He's running his whole show.
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:11.800]  He fired his lawyers, everybody, and I get he's like, hey, I don't want lawyers controlling
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:14.160]  me, but he better get something he can trust.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:15.920]  I believe the ones that were running were bad.
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:20.040]  I've seen some of the text messages, but that doesn't mean they're all bad.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:23.160]  It's like, if I got to fly an airplane, I'm on a pilot, I get a pilot.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.280]  It doesn't mean some pilots are good, some are bad.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.280]  I got to eat my tooth worked on.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:27.280]  I don't like it.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:29.280]  I don't trust Dennis, so I'm just going to do it myself.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.360]  Sure, you can study for years and know it, but I've studied this stuff for years.
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.680]  I don't know 10% of what Tyler Bennett knows.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:36.680]  So I mean, I go to him.
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:37.680]  You got to go to your trust.
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:42.120]  But what would you say to Ye, I'll definitely send him this clip if he's not watching.
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.040]  He watches almost every day.
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:51.080]  Well, like I said, so the thing about the IRS is they will take full advantage of anybody
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:55.960]  they can and Kanye, Kanye, this is a great example because it's happening to you.
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:01.480]  They, you say the IRS is saying you owe 50 million, but they took 75 out of your bank
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:02.480]  account.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.480]  They levied 75.
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:05.400]  That's more than you even than they're saying you owe.
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.400]  Why?
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:11.040]  Because they can because you don't have the correct representation in your corner to make
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:15.960]  sure that they're not violating your rights, which they definitely are right now because
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:18.080]  the IRS is like any other bully.
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:23.400]  They can smell weakness, the second they smell as tiny bit, they're going to take full advantage.
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:28.520]  And so listen, it's still, they took that 75 million from you about a month ago.
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:31.800]  If you call me quick enough, we should be able to get that back without having to wait
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:32.800]  for a refund.
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:38.200]  Regardless, I can get that money back for you because they even said you don't even
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:39.200]  owe that much.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:44.040]  So I don't even think you owe 50 million, but we will find out what he said, what procedure
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:45.960]  do you think they use?
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:52.680]  Well, basically hearing what they said, what they did is they did a pre-assessment levy.
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:56.800]  And so this is what happens to big people that have lots of money.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:00.720]  So they're guessing, oh, we think it's 50, we're going to go ahead and charge you penalties
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:02.720]  and interest now.
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:09.120]  So, what happened is they have only found 50 that he owes so far and they're saying,
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:14.240]  we think you may or more, so we're going to charge you 75 and then see what the difference
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:15.240]  is.
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:18.120]  So is he guilty until proven innocent?
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:19.120]  Absolutely my friend.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:21.960]  So he has been proven, he is guilty until proven innocent.
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:26.480]  And the thing is, let's slow down, let's slow down because I'm talking like I'm five years
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:28.560]  old because I kind of am.
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:29.560]  Explain how the scam works.
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:30.560]  This is big.
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:31.560]  Explain it.
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:32.560]  Okay.
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:38.400]  So in a pre-assessment levy, the IRS decides that you owe money.
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:43.080]  Now they do not have an actual signed tax return from either you or them.
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:48.200]  Remember they can do a tax return too, this is before they've assessed you even assessment
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:50.840]  is when they say how much money you owe them.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:56.120]  So before they even have figured that out, they are seizing an even larger amount of
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:01.800]  money out of your bank account because they, you know, the argument goes, well, you might
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:06.480]  spend it or this and that, but whatever, they're taking money that you don't even technically
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:12.960]  legally owe yet until you sign that tax return or until they file an SFR for you or an assessment,
[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:13.960]  right?
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:18.640]  Because you only owe taxes after you sign the thing saying you owed those taxes or if
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:23.200]  the IRS audits you and says, hey, your numbers were wrong, you actually owe this before that
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.840]  happens, you actually don't owe anything.
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:31.400]  So right now they took $75 million before claiming that's what he owes, right?
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:36.680]  And yes, this is Kanye, it's very big numbers, but this happens from Kanye West all the way
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:43.920]  down to, you know, little guy on the street because if their IRS is in a situation where
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:48.800]  they realize they can take advantage of you and grab, you know, whatever they can, like,
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:53.120]  you know, maybe you have $20,000, $30,000 tucked away from your mother or something,
[01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:57.800]  but they realize that they, you have that they're going to grab it before they even
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:58.800]  decide.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:03.920]  So hypothetically, because I know it varies case to case, but give us a few hypotheticals.
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:10.600]  So hypothetical, for example, would be, this is the case that I saw was there was an elementary
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:16.320]  school in Illinois and private school and they were running money and it was a little
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:22.760]  bit of the, they get subsidies from the state and there's a certain amount of that's nonprofit,
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:23.760]  right?
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:31.120]  And so basically there was a disagreement between the government and the school over
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:33.320]  what was taxable income.
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:37.960]  And so what they did was they just backed up the last three years of all income they
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:44.120]  had made that was reported both on a 10, excuse me, 1120 for taxable income and on a 990,
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:46.080]  which is non-taxable income.
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:49.840]  And they grouped it all together and levied them for the entire amount.
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:54.080]  And then we had to go back in there and fill out the 990s and fill out the 1120.
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:58.480]  And as soon as you, I'm sorry to interrupt you, as soon as you got rid of his representation,
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:02.400]  which I'm sure wasn't perfect, he had reasons to, they went, we got this guy, let's get
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:03.400]  him.
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:07.120]  It's not that all representation is bad, he needs representation now.
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:08.760]  That's exactly what happened Alex.
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:12.640]  And I saw it happen and I was like, oh no, it's like I said, they smell, they're like
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:13.640]  sharks.
[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:16.960]  I tell you what, after the show, after the show, let's three-way, I'm gonna call them.
[01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:18.440]  All right, for sure.
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:22.960]  We can definitely help them out because they smell blood in the water, right?
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:26.040]  And blood on the leaves, that's the kind of song.
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:32.320]  They see the blood on the leaves and what they know is we've got an injured beast out
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:34.080]  here that we can take down.
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:39.000]  They're just like hunters, you know, and so they see the weakness and they will capitalize
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  on it.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.680]  So Kanye, let's not let them take an absurd amount of money from you.
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:49.040]  Let's put that money towards building yourself and your family better, right?
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:50.400]  Don't give it to the government.
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:52.440]  We know they don't have your best interest at heart.
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:53.440]  Give me a call.
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:55.480]  I can help you give back that 75 million.
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:59.120]  And I doubt that you're gonna end up paying the whole 50 million either because that's
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:02.440]  just a number they made up in the first place.
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:03.440]  Incredible.
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.040]  And I mean, you're so dead on about that.
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:08.840]  It's so painful that the Bible says that people perish for lack of knowledge and they've
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:12.440]  written it all for themselves to protect themselves, but then they screw everybody.
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:13.440]  Because I, I want to...
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:15.440]  That is exactly right.
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:16.440]  I went back and...
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:17.440]  That's...
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:18.440]  It's just crazy.
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:19.440]  I'm sorry.
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:20.440]  That's exactly right.
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:25.640]  You know, the Bible is the, you know, the source of knowledge, right?
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:32.960]  And it says right there in the Bible that without more knowledge, you are going to perish.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:35.320]  And here we see it happening in real life.
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:36.320]  This is a...
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:40.520]  The Kanye is very in your face example, but it happens all over the place.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.160]  That's why they're dumb out of schools down.
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:45.080]  It's why they're manipulating everything because the knowledge is all right there.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:46.320]  That's why I'm so frustrated.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:48.240]  I mean, it's all right there.
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:51.120]  Remember, knowledge is power.
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:55.880]  And in the absence of knowledge, dies democracy and your freedom.
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:59.280]  All right, Tyler, I want to hit one more story.
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:02.240]  I want to do five minutes the next hour with you and then we'll let you go because I know
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:06.920]  it's about to be Christmas weekend here, here on this Friday edition.
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:11.560]  But before I get to this Wells Fargo to pay 3.7 billion over consumer loan violations
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:15.680]  that affected millions of consumers, this is very IRS-esque.
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:17.520]  Just a corporation acting like the IRS.
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:20.600]  What other tidbits do you want to add in the last two and a half minutes?
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:31.360]  Well, so this is a great example of the nepotism that exists between the Fortune 500 companies,
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:33.400]  the banks and the IRS, right?
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:38.000]  I mean, the reality of the situation is when we look at it at large scale, the government
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.560]  needs these giant corporations to function, right?
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:48.440]  And in that regard, they don't operate on the same rules that me and you do, Alex or
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.440]  any of the listeners.
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:51.920]  People were here, we have to play by the rules.
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:59.200]  Wells Fargo, Chase, JP Morgan, all these companies and this happened time and time again.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:03.760]  They repeatedly get bailed out from the government and then they, you know, rake it over their
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:09.160]  customers and basically everybody loses except for the big dogs.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:14.080]  And so I'm here to prevent that because look, I'm wearing this shirt, you see this IR Internal
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:17.920]  Revenue Service, we've got what it takes to take what you've got.
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:19.600]  And that really sums it up.
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:25.040]  And especially when you throw into their cronies, the big banks that share information with
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:26.040]  the IRS, right?
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:30.360]  They use against you as well as now Venmo and PayPal and everybody else.
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:37.360]  So the thing is you have to remember that in the game of life, especially here in America,
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:40.240]  the government is out to get you, the big cats are out to get you.
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:44.240]  And if you don't cover your own behind, you're going to get punched in it.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:49.040]  And let's be clear, we have so many great listeners to get into the private Federal Reserve and
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:54.400]  you know, bonds and and and birth certificates and all this stuff, a lot of that's real.
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:58.240]  But the courts don't recognize that it doesn't go anywhere and people get a lot of trouble
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:56:59.240]  with it.
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:02.320]  You're not telling them stuff that's outside the law.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:05.040]  You're telling them the inside baseball of the power structure.
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:06.040]  Right, Alex.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:10.400]  And I'm glad I'm glad you brought that up because there are a lot of people out there
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:19.120]  that good citizens, smart people that think that the way out of the tax issue is to look
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:24.720]  up some, you know, inconsistency in law that some people have noticed and this and that.
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:26.120]  But you can't do that.
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.720]  They will have already adjudicated that and they'll send you to jail.
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:31.680]  You got to play inside City Halls rules.
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:34.960]  We use the IRS rules against them and that's how you win.
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:36.480]  That's how Jeff Bezos wins.
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:37.480]  That's how Elon Musk wins.
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:38.480]  And that's how you'll win too.

[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:27.320]  shown.
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:31.600]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
