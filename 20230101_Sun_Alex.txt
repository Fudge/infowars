[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.642]  If you think gun control or something like that is gonna change a terrorist's point of view, I think you're, like, out of your mind.
[00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:11.484]  You may think you've got me worried about what you're gonna do.
[00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:14.285]  Dude, you're about to find out what I'm gonna do.
[00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:16.265]  And that's gonna worry you a lot more.
[00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:21.507]  Lawdawg, you don't step aside, we'll tear you apart.
[00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:23.848]  You die first, get it?
[00:00:23.848 --> 00:00:29.110]  Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe, you understand me?
[00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.371]  He's bluffing, let's rush him.
[00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:30.471]  No!
[00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:33.055]  He didn't bluff.
[00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:34.917]  You're not as stupid as you look, Hank.
[00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:39.261]  Yeah, I don't understand the concepts of conversation of the gun culture.
[00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:43.486]  We've lived with guns since, what, the 7th century or something?
[00:00:43.486 --> 00:00:44.026]  I don't know.
[00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:49.812]  We all know that right now, guns is a code, it's a metaphor that disenfranchised white guys need.
[00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:51.353]  It makes them feel good because they're being proud of it.
[00:00:51.353 --> 00:00:52.755]  You can say what you want, I don't agree with that.
[00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:54.136]  There's a big difference between fantasy land...
[00:00:55.317 --> 00:00:57.378]  In reality, Fantasyland is what we do.
[00:00:57.378 --> 00:01:00.459]  Doing a movie, doing a television show, that's Fantasyland.
[00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.960]  And that's where that stuff belongs.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.183]  In reality, when we're dealing with things like terrorism and whatnot, we're all going to have different opinions on how to do it, how to deal with it.
[00:01:09.183 --> 00:01:13.505]  Mine happens to be that I think there's a very strong reason, Founding Fathers.
[00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:16.667]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.328]  Are you serious about that?
[00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:19.369]  Are you seriously?
[00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:41.703]  What?
[00:01:41.703 --> 00:01:42.824]  You're good with that?
[00:01:42.824 --> 00:01:44.984]  Oh my God.
[00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:46.525]  We had our Civil War.
[00:01:46.525 --> 00:01:55.929]  If that Second Amendment hadn't been there, those people would not have had the opportunity to do what they considered was defending their life, their way, their way of living.
[00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.869]  So, I agree with that.
[00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.552]  I think that's an important part of our existence, and it's basically that simple.
[00:02:05.552 --> 00:02:06.933]  InfoWars.
[00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:09.674]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:02:13.602 --> 00:02:15.723]  It's called the Great Reset.
[00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:17.424]  Tough guy.
[00:02:17.424 --> 00:02:18.565]  It's called the New World Order.
[00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:28.610]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and a universal basic income.
[00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.950]  That's everything.
[00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.051]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:37.334]  The whole world's gonna be about surveillance and control and then manipulating and tracking everything you do.
[00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:39.095]  It's all being officially announced.
[00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:40.316]  I've got articles everywhere.
[00:02:40.316 --> 00:02:42.397]  There are press releases saying it!
[00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.386]  And the crew asked me during the break, they go, are you alright?
[00:02:48.386 --> 00:02:49.887]  You really seem upset.
[00:02:49.887 --> 00:02:51.167]  Are you feeling okay?
[00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:53.008]  Atlanta's about to have to do their war.
[00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:55.389]  I mean, they're gonna starve a couple hundred million people to death.
[00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:56.750]  Yeah, I'm pretty freaked out, yeah.
[00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.350]  And this is real.
[00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.912]  This is not, this is not a freaking game to me, man.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.441]  Do you love your children that much?
[00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:12.763]  People are already starving to death by the hundreds of millions right now.
[00:03:12.763 --> 00:03:14.583]  You know, you'll never see it on the news.
[00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:15.884]  They're dying right now.
[00:03:15.884 --> 00:03:25.828]  They're in their freaking houses, starving to death, begging for God to help them, and no one's coming because God tells us to get up and take action, and then we don't do anything!
[00:03:25.828 --> 00:03:30.970]  And that paralyzes God!
[00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.830]  Yeah, God can do it.
[00:03:33.097 --> 00:03:36.378]  But God needs us to do it, because God's not free will.
[00:03:36.378 --> 00:03:41.460]  Once again, not for the first time, what has seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory has turned out to be true.
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.680]  True.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.700]  Yeah, I'm upset.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.341]  I'm really... I told you last night, I was like, what's wrong with you?
[00:03:46.341 --> 00:03:47.181]  I'm really freaked out.
[00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:48.742]  Oh my God, I'm really freaked out!
[00:03:48.742 --> 00:03:50.483]  I'm really freaked out!
[00:03:50.483 --> 00:03:53.864]  I'm really freaked out, you see, because this is real!
[00:03:53.864 --> 00:03:57.805]  The supply chain being cut off, the energy grid being cut off is real!
[00:04:00.902 --> 00:04:04.226]  And we're going into a time now where we're not gonna be on the air.
[00:04:04.226 --> 00:04:08.832]  I mean, if we don't back this off, if we don't get sane people to stop the globalists... Come here.
[00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.435]  We won't be here in six months.
[00:04:11.435 --> 00:04:11.756]  You won't.
[00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:25.408]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[00:04:25.408 --> 00:04:27.930]  InfoWars.com InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.212]  InfoWars.com InfoWars.
[00:04:30.212 --> 00:04:31.373]  You watch InfoWars?
[00:04:31.373 --> 00:04:32.274]  InfoWars.
[00:04:32.274 --> 00:04:34.716]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:35.357]  Alex Jones.
[00:04:35.357 --> 00:04:35.917]  Nice guy.
[00:04:35.917 --> 00:04:38.639]  You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.200]  Alex Jones.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.021]  Alex Jones.
[00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:40.902]  Alex Jones.
[00:04:40.902 --> 00:04:41.723]  Alex Jones.
[00:04:41.723 --> 00:04:42.463]  Alex Jones.
[00:04:42.463 --> 00:04:43.725]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[00:04:43.725 --> 00:04:44.886]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[00:04:44.886 --> 00:04:46.148]  They're playing this joke over here.
[00:04:46.148 --> 00:04:47.669]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.053]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:04:51.053 --> 00:04:52.995]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.138 --> 00:05:03.301]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:05.103]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[00:05:05.103 --> 00:05:07.165]  This is an information war.
[00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:11.870]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:20.821]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars has popularized.
[00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:24.703]  Because we understand the enemy's operations, and we know how to beat them.
[00:05:24.703 --> 00:05:26.263]  But we can't do it without funding.
[00:05:26.263 --> 00:05:31.946]  And we make it easy to fund, with great products that empower you and your immune system, and your family as well.
[00:05:31.946 --> 00:05:35.888]  You can also make straight donations at m4warrestore.com, clicking on the big red banner.
[00:05:35.888 --> 00:05:37.289]  A one-time, a recurring.
[00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.129]  But I'm asking you to take action.
[00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.950]  We're non-violent.
[00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:48.294]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[00:05:48.294 --> 00:05:50.615]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[00:05:50.615 --> 00:05:52.456]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[00:05:52.456 --> 00:05:53.577]  We're going over the top.
[00:05:53.577 --> 00:05:55.098]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[00:05:55.098 --> 00:05:58.099]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.324]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:33.324 --> 00:06:40.210]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.535]  Watching the vandalism of civilization, watching the purposeful destruction,
[00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:49.699]  Well, we couldn't have a more important, informative guest on today to cover the waterfront.
[00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:51.501]  He's Dr. Francis Boyle.
[00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:18.475]  He's an author, researcher, lawyer, took the special PhD, only one person gets a year at Harvard, that Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski took, that teaches them how the whole New World Order works.
[00:07:18.475 --> 00:07:22.979]  He was the top war crimes prosecutor, people like Slobodan Milosevic at the UN.
[00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:23.880]  He wrote the U.S.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.345]  Law on Chemical and Biological Weapons and contributed to the world law, and he's here to talk about
[00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:41.742]  The waterfront today, the huge escalation, as he pointed out, on the escalation ladder the Pentagon uses, the full-on total nuclear war.
[00:07:41.742 --> 00:07:50.427]  We'll also look at the gain of function coming out, the fact that it's now confirmed the deep state was censoring scientists and doctors and others that were exposing the truth.
[00:07:50.427 --> 00:07:51.087]  And we'll also
[00:07:52.148 --> 00:07:57.392]  Look at the poison COVID shots and so much more with him, the Twitter files.
[00:07:57.392 --> 00:07:58.413]  There's so much to cover.
[00:07:58.413 --> 00:08:02.196]  So I'm going to try to let Dr. Boyle start wherever he wishes.
[00:08:02.196 --> 00:08:04.538]  It's great to have him on with us here today.
[00:08:04.538 --> 00:08:08.221]  So, Dr. Boyle, thank you so much.
[00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:10.382]  Oh, thank you very much, Alex.
[00:08:10.382 --> 00:08:11.443]  Merry Christmas.
[00:08:11.443 --> 00:08:12.184]  Happy New Year.
[00:08:12.184 --> 00:08:17.368]  Happy holidays there to all your audience.
[00:08:17.368 --> 00:08:18.949]  I know you're not about being vindicated.
[00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:20.430]  You don't want the credit, but you also
[00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.173]  These folks know the gravitas, you're a serious guy.
[00:08:24.173 --> 00:08:40.408]  You were on the air in late January and early February 2020 on my show and other shows, predicting it was out of a lab, predicting the shots would be poisoned, predicting war would follow, predicting world ID cards, predicting the shots would cause mass death.
[00:08:40.408 --> 00:08:45.673]  So out of all the pantheon of great people, the Dr. Robert Malone's and the Dr. Michael, you know, Yee Dodds,
[00:08:46.354 --> 00:08:50.876]  You have been the most on target and the early bird in all this.
[00:08:50.876 --> 00:08:56.299]  So I know you want to get into the war in Ukraine and expanding and that existential threat.
[00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:56.980]  I want to hit that.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.701]  But first, total vindication, Dr. Boyle.
[00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:02.583]  It's like you had a crystal ball.
[00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:14.329]  Well, Alex, a lot of this credit goes to you because you're the only person in the mainstream news media that would let me talk about these things.
[00:09:15.646 --> 00:09:24.790]  I first blew the whistle on it on January 24, 2020, in a worldwide alert.
[00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:37.054]  The dangers here that COVID-19 was an offensive biological warfare weapon that had leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4.
[00:09:37.054 --> 00:09:44.177]  And then later on, on your program, I said that any frankenshots
[00:09:45.012 --> 00:10:08.488]  That big pharma developed here would be more dangerous than useless and then later on on your show I said messenger RNA is very powerful stuff to inject into your body and it could discombobulate your entire genetic system.
[00:10:08.488 --> 00:10:12.471]  Now I said that very early on as you correctly pointed out
[00:10:13.158 --> 00:10:19.664]  In early February to you and on InfoWars and some of your colleagues.
[00:10:19.664 --> 00:10:27.471]  So kudos to you and to InfoWars for letting me speak the truth to the American people.
[00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:34.478]  But how did you, I mean I know you wrote the bioweapons laws and were a top prosecutor at the UN, but just how did you nail it?
[00:10:34.478 --> 00:10:35.739]  So you totally nailed it.
[00:10:38.897 --> 00:10:41.078]  Well, we've discussed this before.
[00:10:41.078 --> 00:11:06.328]  I think the most important point now, from my perspective, are these proposed regulations by the World Health Authority and also the proposed pandemic treaty by the World Health Organization that are now under consideration over in Geneva.
[00:11:06.328 --> 00:11:07.909]  I have read both the
[00:11:09.247 --> 00:11:12.469]  Regulations and the treaty.
[00:11:12.469 --> 00:11:35.386]  And according to either one or both, they will establish a scientific and medical police state that will cover the entire world and that will usurp and negate the sovereignty of the United States of America
[00:11:36.318 --> 00:11:53.023]  As well as the sovereignty of the States of the Union under the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution and penetrate right down to our primary care physicians.
[00:11:53.023 --> 00:12:01.386]  You will have Dr. Tedros there, the WHO, telling our medical doctors how to treat us.
[00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:08.301]  This will be a one-way path to the cemetery for all Americans.
[00:12:08.301 --> 00:12:12.710]  And right now, we must get organized to defeat
[00:12:13.337 --> 00:12:22.904]  The WHO regulations and the WHO treaty on future... And let's be clear, you're a guy that writes U.S.
[00:12:22.904 --> 00:12:23.245]  and U.N.
[00:12:23.245 --> 00:12:23.825]  regulations.
[00:12:23.825 --> 00:12:26.207]  There couldn't be a better guest to describe this.
[00:12:26.207 --> 00:12:36.294]  You've read the treaty, you've read the regulations, and you're saying what we've been hearing is true, that it is a worldwide, biomedical, big pharma, corporate police state.
[00:12:36.294 --> 00:12:37.015]  That's correct.
[00:12:37.015 --> 00:12:37.896]  And as a matter of fact,
[00:12:39.342 --> 00:13:00.975]  Alex, I've researched, studied, and taught international organizations, starting from my student days at Harvard Law School up until today, beginning with the first Hague Peace Conference of 1899, up through and including the United Nations organization.
[00:13:01.568 --> 00:13:13.631]  You can read about this in my book, Foundations of World Order, Duke University Press, 1999, which was half of my PhD dissertation at Harvard.
[00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:18.792]  So yes, I've done this work professionally for all those years.
[00:13:18.792 --> 00:13:25.213]  Indeed, the most insidious part of the WHO tree, from my perspective,
[00:13:26.082 --> 00:13:42.315]  Uh, is that the concluding clause has been drafted so that it will come into effect immediately upon signature by Biden's delegate.
[00:13:42.315 --> 00:13:43.316]  Let me repeat that.
[00:13:43.316 --> 00:13:48.660]  It will come into effect immediately upon signature for Biden's delegate.
[00:13:49.401 --> 00:14:02.269]  Despite the requirements of the United States Constitution that all treaties must receive the advice and consent of the United States Senate.
[00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:11.154]  A clear-cut usurpation of our Constitution, as well as the 10th Amendment,
[00:14:11.804 --> 00:14:23.271]  Guaranteeing that all rights not delegated to the federal government reside in the hands of the states, the union, or the people.
[00:14:23.271 --> 00:14:40.402]  And so what will happen under this treaty and also under the regulations, people like Governor DeSantis, Governor Abbott, and others who do not accept the party line coming out of the CDC
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.541]  We'll be sidestepped and usurped.
[00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:44.482]  And that was my next question.
[00:14:44.482 --> 00:14:45.343]  We'll come back for a break.
[00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:51.747]  We'll get into the World Treaty and more than get into the war in Ukraine that's currently the big, obviously, the front-burner threat.
[00:14:51.747 --> 00:14:58.351]  But what do you make of the German Vice President saying, we need investigations, criminal investigations.
[00:14:58.351 --> 00:15:03.574]  The Supreme Court three days ago green-lighting criminal investigations in Florida.
[00:15:03.574 --> 00:15:06.436]  That's got to be encouraging.
[00:15:06.436 --> 00:15:06.796]  Right.
[00:15:06.796 --> 00:15:07.596]  I have read the
[00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:17.706]  Request for a grand jury that Governor DeSantis filed with the Florida Supreme Court.
[00:15:17.706 --> 00:15:24.015]  And then I have read the terms of reference given by the Florida Supreme Court.
[00:15:25.162 --> 00:15:39.669]  They are broad enough, in my opinion, to include indictments against everyone involved here for murder and conspiracy to commit murder in accordance with Florida law.
[00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:42.992]  And I certainly would encourage... Dr. Boyle, stay there.
[00:15:42.992 --> 00:15:44.233]  I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor.
[00:15:44.233 --> 00:15:54.742]  Let's come back with that, finish up with COVID, and then get into the World War III situation and that ladder of escalation you warned of two months ago on the show that we've now moved up several rooms on.
[00:15:54.742 --> 00:15:55.142]  Wow!
[00:15:55.142 --> 00:15:56.583]  Dr. Francis A. Boyle is our guest.
[00:15:56.583 --> 00:15:56.964]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.718 --> 00:16:01.360]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.202]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[00:16:03.202 --> 00:16:10.690]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:15.435]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[00:16:15.435 --> 00:16:18.098]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.643]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[00:16:24.643 --> 00:16:26.664]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[00:16:26.664 --> 00:16:28.485]  So please, keep me on the field.
[00:16:28.485 --> 00:16:33.689]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy, while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.
[00:16:33.689 --> 00:16:44.876]  InfoWarsTore.com for the best supplements and more, or just make a straight donation, big red banner at the top of InfoWarsTore.com, and that way all the money goes towards the fight, not part of it going towards product cost.
[00:16:45.256 --> 00:16:46.637]  I thank you all for your support.
[00:16:46.637 --> 00:16:51.061]  Please commit now to go to MFORESTORE.COM to get great products and make donations.
[00:16:51.061 --> 00:16:52.022]  I thank you for your support.
[00:16:52.022 --> 00:16:53.243]  Now take action!
[00:16:53.243 --> 00:16:55.985]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[00:16:59.585 --> 00:17:10.890]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.791]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[00:17:12.791 --> 00:17:14.252]  That's what they want to take away.
[00:17:14.252 --> 00:17:15.753]  Your ability to speak freely.
[00:17:15.753 --> 00:17:17.454]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:18.754]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[00:17:18.754 --> 00:17:20.135]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[00:17:20.575 --> 00:17:23.197]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but only 28 years.
[00:17:23.197 --> 00:17:25.399]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[00:17:25.399 --> 00:17:27.801]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:29.823]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[00:17:29.823 --> 00:17:36.769]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[00:17:37.409 --> 00:17:42.793]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[00:17:42.793 --> 00:17:51.740]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, for you to double your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:58.005]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:08.974]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[00:18:08.974 --> 00:18:18.119]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[00:18:18.659 --> 00:18:25.242]  We've gone right to the manufacturer, who are listeners, the owner's a fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail.
[00:18:25.242 --> 00:18:30.725]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[00:18:30.725 --> 00:18:32.265]  And not just under one name.
[00:18:32.265 --> 00:18:37.768]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:41.830]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.152]  We're talking about Pain MD.
[00:18:44.152 --> 00:18:46.834]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:49.696]  We're talking about 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:18:49.696 --> 00:18:51.498]  These things are incredible.
[00:18:51.498 --> 00:18:57.443]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your health care provider because they're so powerful.
[00:18:57.443 --> 00:18:58.523]  Get them at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:18:59.608 --> 00:19:04.152]  I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years, since high school, and they had great effects.
[00:19:04.152 --> 00:19:07.855]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:18.684]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[00:19:18.684 --> 00:19:20.026]  These products work great for women as well.
[00:19:20.646 --> 00:19:23.047]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[00:19:23.047 --> 00:19:25.527]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name.
[00:19:25.527 --> 00:19:31.329]  We got it discounted for 40% off InfoWarsTore.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.
[00:19:31.329 --> 00:19:33.569]  We've also got HGH Max Boost.
[00:19:33.569 --> 00:19:34.870]  Read all about it.
[00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.250]  Be very safe with it.
[00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.651]  I'd take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[00:19:39.651 --> 00:19:41.191]  Don't do it during the day.
[00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:44.192]  1776 testosterone boost.
[00:19:44.192 --> 00:19:45.272]  Totally incredible.
[00:19:45.272 --> 00:19:46.193]  Go read about them.
[00:19:46.193 --> 00:19:46.973]  Learn more about them.
[00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:52.274]  At InfoWarsStore.com in the InfoWars Platinum section.
[00:19:52.274 --> 00:20:01.096]  And you get 40% off on these already best-selling products under the new name InfoWars Platinum.
[00:20:01.096 --> 00:20:06.998]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:18.112 --> 00:20:24.058]  All right, Dr. Francis A. Boyle, author, researcher, man that wrote the U.S.
[00:20:24.058 --> 00:20:27.181]  Biological Chemical Weapons Law, former U.N.
[00:20:27.181 --> 00:20:30.884]  war crimes prosecutor, got caught off by the break.
[00:20:30.884 --> 00:20:40.334]  He was getting into the German vice president saying he wants an investigation of the shots, a criminal investigation launched by the state of Florida and more.
[00:20:41.479 --> 00:20:49.305]  And then finishing up with all the gain-of-function news and what's coming out and what he thinks the deep state's going to do now because they're being so exposed.
[00:20:49.305 --> 00:20:55.489]  Elon Musk coming out pointing out that Fauci's wife runs the bioethics board that controls what he can do.
[00:20:55.489 --> 00:21:01.053]  I mean, as this whole incestuous bioweapons program comes out, it looks like it's blown up in their face.
[00:21:01.053 --> 00:21:03.635]  Please continue, Dr. Boyle.
[00:21:03.635 --> 00:21:04.496]  Right.
[00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:09.840]  Again, one point to drive home for your audience to understand.
[00:21:10.583 --> 00:21:15.285]  Trump pulled us out of the WHO for good cause.
[00:21:15.285 --> 00:21:17.266]  I agree with that decision.
[00:21:17.266 --> 00:21:28.591]  One of the first steps Biden made as president was to put us back into the WHO and he appointed Tony Fauci as the U.S.
[00:21:28.591 --> 00:21:34.773]  government's representative on the executive council of the WHO.
[00:21:34.773 --> 00:21:36.294]  Now think about that for a minute.
[00:21:36.954 --> 00:21:43.678]  That's where the WHO treaty and the WHA regulations are coming from.
[00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:45.159]  Tony Fauci.
[00:21:45.159 --> 00:21:48.801]  And on that, we've discussed Fauci before.
[00:21:48.801 --> 00:21:53.903]  You can read Bobby Kennedy's book on the real Anthony Fauci.
[00:21:53.903 --> 00:21:55.104]  It's all in there.
[00:21:55.104 --> 00:22:00.067]  So it's clear what happened here is that Fauci and his ilk
[00:22:01.108 --> 00:22:23.144]  Like Bill Gates, like Big Pharma, like the biowarfare industry, when they saw the opposition coming from American people and governors and other elected officials, decided to do an Enron around all of us.
[00:22:23.824 --> 00:22:41.258]  By going to the WHO and drafting these regulations and this treaty that will set up a worldwide scientific medical police state under the control of Tedros and Bill Gates,
[00:22:42.618 --> 00:22:51.821]  And the biowarfare industry, big pharma, and the Chinese Communist government that gives a lot of money to the WHO.
[00:22:51.821 --> 00:22:59.783]  That is what is confronting us today, Alex, as citizens of the United States of America.
[00:22:59.783 --> 00:23:03.264]  We have to stop these WHA regulations.
[00:23:03.264 --> 00:23:10.266]  We must stop this WHO treaty if we want to live in freedom here in the United States.
[00:23:12.823 --> 00:23:15.260]  Again, you've read the treaty, you've read the regulations.
[00:23:16.807 --> 00:23:19.988]  And that's what I've seen Congress people say the same thing you said.
[00:23:19.988 --> 00:23:21.489]  I've looked over as well.
[00:23:21.489 --> 00:23:32.013]  It looks like the UN gives control of pandemic response, but then the UN, I saw their hearings three years ago before the pandemic was announced in December of 2019.
[00:23:32.013 --> 00:23:37.295]  The head of their vaccine program said, we're just told by the big pharma what to say about these shots.
[00:23:37.295 --> 00:23:38.675]  We don't even test them.
[00:23:38.675 --> 00:23:43.457]  So the UN itself, if the UN will be in control under this treaty, who's in control of the UN?
[00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.412]  Well, you know, you get what you pay for.
[00:23:49.412 --> 00:23:51.654]  He who pays the piper calls the tune.
[00:23:51.654 --> 00:23:58.961]  I mean, the UN is a rotten, corrupt, and despicable organization.
[00:23:59.577 --> 00:24:16.643]  When I was the lawyer for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war and genocide against them, the United Nations, the European Union, its member states, and Bill Clinton at UN headquarters in Geneva,
[00:24:17.361 --> 00:24:43.087]  Tried to carve up the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina into three little bitty pieces of land, rob Bosnia of their UN membership, destroy their statehood under international law, and subject 1.5 to 2 million more Bosnians to ethnic cleansing when we already had 2 million victims of ethnic cleansing.
[00:24:43.087 --> 00:24:44.688]  Now I stopped them.
[00:24:44.688 --> 00:24:45.588]  It never happened.
[00:24:46.101 --> 00:24:51.626]  Bosnia and Herzegovina is still there today, and they have their UN membership.
[00:24:51.626 --> 00:24:57.111]  But that's what they were going to do to the poor Bosnians.
[00:24:57.111 --> 00:24:59.513]  So you've lived the predatory nature of the UN.
[00:24:59.513 --> 00:25:07.281]  I want to get into all the other big subjects, but you're a UN insider, a guy that, you know, tried to reform it but couldn't, obviously, but did some good work there.
[00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:08.862]  What is the UN now?
[00:25:08.862 --> 00:25:11.825]  Basically a corporate front group of corporate fascists, or what is it?
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:19.962]  I think corporate fascists is a good description, certainly for the UN Secretariat, right?
[00:25:19.962 --> 00:25:20.882]  I think that's a good description.
[00:25:20.882 --> 00:25:28.604]  Yeah, so the General Body is a debating club with no power, but the actual UN and the Security Council, that's fascist.
[00:25:28.604 --> 00:25:31.164]  Well, the Secretariat, the bureaucracy, right.
[00:25:31.164 --> 00:25:37.466]  And then they control the specialized agencies like the WHO, sure.
[00:25:37.466 --> 00:25:39.627]  And we all know the WHO.
[00:25:39.627 --> 00:25:41.367]  Could the UN be reformed?
[00:25:43.957 --> 00:25:45.878]  I really don't know at this point.
[00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:50.800]  My assessment, Alex, was when I was at the U.N.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:57.303]  headquarters in Geneva and they were trying to destroy the Bosnians, a U.N.
[00:25:57.303 --> 00:26:04.006]  member state, it struck me that historically this was at the situation
[00:26:04.986 --> 00:26:23.716]  of the inevitable decline of the League of Nations when Haile Selassie appeared in the exact same location I was and appealed for the League to save Abyssinia from Mussolini and his fascists and they did nothing.
[00:26:23.716 --> 00:26:27.678]  So I regret to say the UN is on decline.
[00:26:28.959 --> 00:26:36.944]  That's a great example of when the Ethiopian leader tried to stop that, and that could have stopped World War II if they had done something then.
[00:26:36.944 --> 00:26:38.245]  It could have, sure.
[00:26:38.245 --> 00:26:38.965]  But they didn't.
[00:26:38.965 --> 00:26:42.727]  And indeed, in the case of the Bosnians, it was far worse.
[00:26:42.727 --> 00:26:45.069]  They tried to get rid of us.
[00:26:45.069 --> 00:26:46.349]  And I stopped them.
[00:26:46.349 --> 00:26:47.390]  Yes, I did.
[00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:48.410]  And you're on record doing that.
[00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:49.711]  You've done so many amazing things.
[00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:55.695]  I know when I asked you to talk about how you know all this, you just moved on to the next subject, but your knowledge is just incredible.
[00:26:55.695 --> 00:26:57.096]  I mean, it's amazing to be able to pick your brain.
[00:26:57.901 --> 00:27:00.125]  We got two minutes to break.
[00:27:00.125 --> 00:27:03.352]  What subject do you want to go to next?
[00:27:03.352 --> 00:27:06.738]  Well, we can move on to Ukraine if you want to, sure.
[00:27:06.738 --> 00:27:07.439]  Let's do that.
[00:27:07.439 --> 00:27:09.143]  Give us a prelude of what's coming up.
[00:27:11.471 --> 00:27:17.013]  Well, if we don't stop Biden, we're going to have a direct war with Russia.
[00:27:17.013 --> 00:27:27.057]  Right now, there is an indirect war, a de facto state of war between the United States and Russia.
[00:27:27.057 --> 00:27:30.938]  Even Foreign Minister Lavrov has said that.
[00:27:30.938 --> 00:27:33.619]  So we're going to have to stop the Bidenites.
[00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:46.753]  Before they continue up this ladder of escalation, you have the list there, the con letter of ladder of escalation developed by for Rand and the Pentagon.
[00:27:46.753 --> 00:27:51.918]  And if you skip down just a little bit, you'll see we're at stage 20.
[00:27:53.411 --> 00:28:00.379]  Oh, the no nuclear use threshold will rate their peaceful worldwide embargo.
[00:28:00.379 --> 00:28:00.699]  Right.
[00:28:00.699 --> 00:28:06.885]  That's exactly what we have today against the Russian Federation.
[00:28:06.885 --> 00:28:10.149]  Biden and the European Union member states
[00:28:10.849 --> 00:28:14.690]  And that's what you said two months ago on the show.
[00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.792]  That's what Lavrov said yesterday.
[00:28:17.792 --> 00:28:22.973]  He said, we're entering the nuclear threshold.
[00:28:22.973 --> 00:28:24.134]  This needs to stop now.
[00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.570]  Right.
[00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.131]  It has to stop now.
[00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:41.336]  And yet you will see the Bidenites refuse, adamantly refuse to negotiate.
[00:28:41.336 --> 00:28:44.499]  Just the other day, Putin said he will negotiate.
[00:28:44.499 --> 00:28:46.840]  Lavrov would say they will negotiate.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.541]  The Bidenites refuse.
[00:28:48.541 --> 00:28:50.723]  And of course, Zelensky refuses.
[00:28:50.723 --> 00:28:52.124]  But he's our puppet.
[00:28:52.124 --> 00:28:53.525]  Zelensky tells whatever.
[00:28:53.525 --> 00:28:56.427]  Well, let's talk about what comes next with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[00:28:59.585 --> 00:29:01.748]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:29:01.748 --> 00:29:03.550]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.613]  This is an information war.
[00:29:05.613 --> 00:29:10.299]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[00:29:10.299 --> 00:29:16.788]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[00:29:17.228 --> 00:29:17.988]  We're good to go.
[00:29:38.817 --> 00:29:46.726]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[00:29:46.726 --> 00:29:49.049]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[00:29:49.049 --> 00:29:50.891]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:52.032]  We're going over the top.
[00:29:52.032 --> 00:29:53.534]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[00:29:53.534 --> 00:29:56.618]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[00:30:00.012 --> 00:30:06.939]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[00:30:06.939 --> 00:30:12.825]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[00:30:12.825 --> 00:30:19.191]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[00:30:19.491 --> 00:30:26.719]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[00:30:26.719 --> 00:30:37.050]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:46.439]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[00:30:46.439 --> 00:30:53.026]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[00:30:53.026 --> 00:30:59.233]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[00:31:00.051 --> 00:31:07.717]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[00:31:07.717 --> 00:31:09.779]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:11.480]  They know we're telling the truth.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.042]  They know we've got their number.
[00:31:13.042 --> 00:31:17.766]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[00:31:17.766 --> 00:31:20.368]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds.
[00:31:20.888 --> 00:31:21.529]  We're good to go.
[00:31:37.025 --> 00:31:37.345]  Thank you.
[00:31:59.748 --> 00:32:02.791]  InfoWars' secret weapon is finally here.
[00:32:02.791 --> 00:32:11.137]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[00:32:11.137 --> 00:32:20.685]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[00:32:20.685 --> 00:32:26.149]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:28.851]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,
[00:32:29.071 --> 00:32:31.512]  We're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[00:32:31.512 --> 00:32:36.674]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[00:32:36.674 --> 00:32:39.055]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram, or the 20 milligram.
[00:32:39.055 --> 00:32:42.837]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[00:32:42.837 --> 00:32:45.498]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[00:32:45.498 --> 00:32:51.601]  These similar formulas, or the same formulas, sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[00:32:51.601 --> 00:32:55.962]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:55.962 --> 00:32:56.683]  A true 360 win.
[00:33:01.132 --> 00:33:05.735]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.735 --> 00:33:14.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.081]  Big Brother.
[00:33:16.081 --> 00:33:18.402]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:18.402 --> 00:33:20.164]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:22.245]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:22.245 --> 00:33:24.426]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:24.426 --> 00:33:29.089]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.207 --> 00:33:38.698]  Folks are really waking up to the city lockdowns and the climate lockdowns that are being announced.
[00:33:38.698 --> 00:33:39.639]  The 15-minute cities.
[00:33:39.639 --> 00:33:44.948]  I just had a very well-known podcaster text me and ask, is this real?
[00:33:45.993 --> 00:33:47.233]  And yes, it's real.
[00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:48.274]  We've been covering it for years.
[00:33:48.274 --> 00:33:57.656]  But tomorrow, I'm just going to open the show up, no matter how big the news is, with the 15-minute cities and the UN lockdowns, the climate lockdowns, and all the rest of it.
[00:33:57.656 --> 00:34:01.176]  But we're talking to Dr. Francis A. Boyle right now, who wrote the U.S.
[00:34:01.176 --> 00:34:12.339]  Biological Chemical Weapons Laws, was a top UN war crimes prosecutor and more, and who's the most accurate person predicting almost three years ago, starting in January of 2020,
[00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:15.900]  What was going to unfold and happen.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.660]  So we were continuing on.
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:37.306]  We hit the break with Russia and this escalation ladder, a generalized scenario, the Rand Corporation and the Pentagon that we're at point 20, what point 44 means and where this huge escalation is going and what the neocons and the crazy Democrats think they're doing.
[00:34:37.306 --> 00:34:37.886]  Please continue.
[00:34:40.441 --> 00:34:54.951]  Well, again, we saw this massive propaganda campaign by the Bidenites to bring Zelensky over here and try to get support from the American people in Congress.
[00:34:55.754 --> 00:35:02.639]  For this existentially dangerous war against Russia that is going on right now.
[00:35:02.639 --> 00:35:15.548]  I teach the laws of war and I would say right now with Russia, we are in a de facto state of war with Russia.
[00:35:16.508 --> 00:35:23.631]  It is not yet a de jure state of war with Russia, but it's certainly de facto.
[00:35:23.631 --> 00:35:31.393]  And again, Foreign Minister Lavrov, who's a very experienced consummate diplomat, has said the same thing here.
[00:35:31.393 --> 00:35:34.495]  So it's extremely dangerous.
[00:35:34.495 --> 00:35:37.256]  Anything could set this off.
[00:35:37.256 --> 00:35:41.057]  And then rather than de-escalate the situation,
[00:35:42.077 --> 00:35:48.321]  Biden and the Democrats bring Zelensky over here to escalate.
[00:35:48.321 --> 00:35:51.723]  Well this is like, imagine if Kennedy vacationed in the U.S.
[00:35:51.723 --> 00:35:56.906]  Virgin Islands for two weeks during the Cuban Missile Crisis, he'd be impeached.
[00:35:56.906 --> 00:36:01.469]  Shouldn't we move, as you pushed four months ago, to impeach Biden immediately for war crimes?
[00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.330]  Well, yes, that's true.
[00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:13.472]  But let's compare this to the Cuban Missile Crisis, because I think it's very instructive.
[00:36:13.472 --> 00:36:27.575]  For Russia, this is even more dangerous than the Cuban Missile Crisis in reverse, because in our case, Cuba was 90 miles south of Florida.
[00:36:28.656 --> 00:36:31.098]  This is right on their borders.
[00:36:31.098 --> 00:36:39.045]  And the second thing I think we need to consider is that Biden is no JFK.
[00:36:39.045 --> 00:36:52.338]  Whatever you think of JFK, he volunteered for combat during World War II and performed heroically, courageously, and was seriously injured.
[00:36:52.856 --> 00:37:15.533]  Well, Biden's done nothing with his career but be on the payroll there in Delaware of Wall Street and the banksters and everyone else who does their corporate headquarters in Delaware, because that's the most favorable... That's right, Kennedy engaged a Japanese destroyer with a small patrol boat and got his back broken, and we know the whole story, very heroic.
[00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:18.796]  And then meanwhile, if we go up this chain of what's happening,
[00:37:19.663 --> 00:37:23.241]  It's very apocalyptic to have Biden vacationing while this is going on.
[00:37:24.946 --> 00:37:29.948]  Right, and you know, Kennedy tried to de-escalate.
[00:37:29.948 --> 00:37:52.837]  Most of his advisors on the Executive Committee, except for Adlai Stevenson here in the state of Illinois, and Undersecretary of State George Ball, who was a friend of mine, tried to restrain everyone else on the Executive Committee from invading Cuba that would have set off a nuclear war.
[00:37:53.597 --> 00:37:57.518]  LLM and Sir Curtis LeMay, all of them wanted to go to full war.
[00:37:57.518 --> 00:37:58.499]  That's correct.
[00:37:58.499 --> 00:38:01.379]  It would have very quickly become nuclear war.
[00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:02.080]  Yes.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.200]  Well, whose restraint on Biden?
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.621]  Indeed, who's really home there with Biden?
[00:38:08.621 --> 00:38:14.563]  I regret to say, I think Biden is in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease.
[00:38:14.563 --> 00:38:14.803]  I agree.
[00:38:14.803 --> 00:38:19.004]  So let's go up this ladder here, because you bring this up and now even the Russians are bringing up the ladder.
[00:38:19.004 --> 00:38:20.305]  So you've got one up to 20.
[00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:24.970]  Peaceful, in quotes, worldwide embargo blockade.
[00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:29.375]  Then we move to local nuclear war, which Labyrinth and others are saying is next.
[00:38:29.375 --> 00:38:31.197]  Then declaration of limited nuclear war.
[00:38:31.197 --> 00:38:39.888]  And then we've got local nuclear war, military, unusual, provocative and significant countermeasures, evacuation.
[00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:45.701]  26th demonstration of attack on zone of interior.
[00:38:45.701 --> 00:38:49.723]  Well that we've kind of skipped ahead with all these cruise missile attacks inside Russia.
[00:38:49.723 --> 00:38:52.165]  How big a provocation is that in the last month?
[00:38:52.165 --> 00:38:55.707]  Just like they've kind of skipped ahead here to internal provocations in Russia.
[00:38:58.266 --> 00:39:10.231]  Well, again, yes, it does appear they're trying to provoke Russia into more substantial military action against them.
[00:39:10.231 --> 00:39:16.313]  We have to understand, whatever the Ukrainian military is doing today,
[00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:22.753]  Has been greenlighted by the Pentagon and the Biden administration.
[00:39:22.753 --> 00:39:31.677]  And all these attacks into Russia itself rely on US GPS coordination.
[00:39:31.677 --> 00:39:32.977]  So the Russians know this.
[00:39:32.977 --> 00:39:33.978]  They've even said this.
[00:39:34.998 --> 00:39:44.565]  Basically, it's the Americans using the Ukrainians to engage in direct attacks against Russia.
[00:39:44.565 --> 00:39:56.773]  And the Bidenites, if you read the news media, have made it clear that they don't believe that the Russians are serious about any of their red lines.
[00:39:57.373 --> 00:40:05.458]  And so they are going to keep pushing up this ladder of escalation, which makes it extremely existentially dangerous.
[00:40:05.458 --> 00:40:16.104]  So why would the Pentagon and NATO openly be running the attacks, coordinating them, and trying to escalate Russia to a full military commitment?
[00:40:16.104 --> 00:40:21.987]  The Pentagon believes we have escalation dominance at every rung of that ladder.
[00:40:26.511 --> 00:40:29.174]  That we can control and dominate.
[00:40:29.174 --> 00:40:34.701]  So they're pushing and tricking the Russians into pulling into Poland and invading Russia.
[00:40:34.701 --> 00:40:35.502]  But in reverse.
[00:40:36.894 --> 00:40:45.180]  Well, again, it's the lessons learned from the Cuban Missile Crisis, which I think were the wrong lessons.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:55.648]  But that's by Thomas Schelling of Harvard, a head of me in the government department, his arms and influence, where Schelling talked about compellence.
[00:40:55.648 --> 00:41:04.154]  Namely, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we had escalation dominance all up that ladder of escalation.
[00:41:04.754 --> 00:41:14.858]  And therefore, because of this escalation of dominance at every stage, eventually we compelled Khrushchev to back down.
[00:41:14.858 --> 00:41:16.478]  But let's look at those maps.
[00:41:16.478 --> 00:41:19.679]  We totally destroy Russia, we just lose half our cities.
[00:41:19.679 --> 00:41:21.200]  It's a Pyrrhic victory.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:26.002]  So, in their ladder of dominance, they win, but America gets destroyed.
[00:41:26.002 --> 00:41:26.862]  That is very sick.
[00:41:29.352 --> 00:41:37.876]  Well, I think they believe they can get the Russians to back down without it coming to that.
[00:41:37.876 --> 00:41:51.043]  Again, when Khrushchev looked at the ICBM balance during the Cuban Missile Crisis, he concluded there was no way we could prevail here, and he backed down.
[00:41:51.583 --> 00:42:05.913]  So that's, I believe, the way the Pentagon is looking at now, from the perspective of Kahn's ladder of escalation, their doctrine of escalation of dominance, and Schelling's game theory.
[00:42:05.913 --> 00:42:09.456]  So this is next level Russian roulette for the whole world?
[00:42:11.047 --> 00:42:12.088]  That's the way I see it.
[00:42:12.088 --> 00:42:25.742]  Yes, and remember, at the very height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the CIA set up a U-2 over there, over Soviet Union, to provoke them.
[00:42:25.742 --> 00:42:27.584]  The Soviets shot it down.
[00:42:28.294 --> 00:42:48.156]  And instead of overreacting, Kennedy continued with his back-channel diplomacy with Khrushchev through his brother and ambassador, Joe Breenan, saying, quote, there's always some son of a bitch down the line who doesn't get the word, unquote.
[00:42:48.816 --> 00:42:55.143]  So, Alex, in this game of Russian Roulette, something can always go wrong.
[00:42:55.143 --> 00:42:57.165]  Someone does not get the word.
[00:42:57.165 --> 00:42:57.686]  Well, that's right.
[00:42:57.686 --> 00:42:59.527]  Let's talk about how to end this peacefully.
[00:42:59.527 --> 00:43:02.170]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:03.972]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[00:43:03.972 --> 00:43:05.133]  This is an information war.
[00:43:06.014 --> 00:43:10.676]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[00:43:10.676 --> 00:43:19.879]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars has popularized.
[00:43:19.879 --> 00:43:23.540]  Because we understand the enemy's operations, and we know how to beat them.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.020]  But we can't do it without funding.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:30.322]  And we make it easy to fund, with great products that empower you and your immune system, and your family as well.
[00:43:30.802 --> 00:43:34.723]  You can also make straight donations at m4wrestore.com clicking on the big red banner.
[00:43:34.723 --> 00:43:36.123]  A one-time, a recurring.
[00:43:36.123 --> 00:43:37.984]  But I'm asking you to take action.
[00:43:37.984 --> 00:43:39.204]  We're non-violent.
[00:43:39.204 --> 00:43:47.126]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[00:43:47.126 --> 00:43:49.446]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[00:43:49.446 --> 00:43:51.286]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[00:43:51.286 --> 00:43:52.427]  We're going over the top.
[00:43:52.427 --> 00:43:53.927]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[00:43:53.927 --> 00:43:56.988]  So please go to m4wrestore.com and donate now.
[00:44:00.253 --> 00:44:07.456]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the right reviews.
[00:44:07.456 --> 00:44:18.461]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States, and it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already using.
[00:44:18.461 --> 00:44:27.044]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high quality supplements, and in some cases, even better.

[00:45:18.303 --> 00:45:19.704]  These are the very best.
[00:45:19.704 --> 00:45:22.186]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:22.706]  Well, guess what?

[00:45:43.195 --> 00:45:53.218]  The highest quality, directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50%, in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[00:45:53.218 --> 00:45:55.238]  InfoWars MD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:59.992 --> 00:46:20.599]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:34.245]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[00:46:34.245 --> 00:46:43.088]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[00:46:43.088 --> 00:46:49.511]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[00:46:49.611 --> 00:46:51.032]  So, continue to do it.
[00:46:51.032 --> 00:46:53.214]  Go to places like Infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:53.214 --> 00:46:55.316]  Go to the places like Save Infowars.
[00:46:55.316 --> 00:47:00.280]  Continue to keep Infowars alive, because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.062]  Just Google his name, Dr. Francis A. Boyle, and find his dozens of amazing books.
[00:47:19.062 --> 00:47:20.822]  You'll learn how the world works.
[00:47:20.822 --> 00:47:33.406]  The last ten and a half minute segment we have here on this Wednesday edition, I want to talk about the nature of the Anglo-American establishment and what they're going to do next, but I wanted to finish up with my questions with this.
[00:47:34.977 --> 00:47:44.200]  We look at this escalation ladder that we know the Pentagon still uses, we know the RAND Corporation developed, and that now is being quoted in the news once Dr. Boyle talked about it.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.822]  We move up here from 1 to 20 where we're at right now.
[00:47:47.822 --> 00:47:50.122]  We're skipping ahead with some of the attacks inside Russia, 26.
[00:47:50.122 --> 00:47:55.624]  We move up into formal declaration of general war.
[00:47:55.624 --> 00:47:58.245]  They're basically doing that now with Zelensky visiting.
[00:47:58.245 --> 00:47:59.326]  Slow motion, counter.
[00:48:00.816 --> 00:48:02.037]  Property war.
[00:48:02.037 --> 00:48:04.958]  Slow motion, counter force war.
[00:48:04.958 --> 00:48:07.739]  Constrained force reduction salvo.
[00:48:07.739 --> 00:48:09.480]  Constrained disarming attack.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.581]  Oh, we just got an attack to stop their offensive.
[00:48:11.581 --> 00:48:16.143]  Counter force with... Abundance attack.
[00:48:16.143 --> 00:48:18.224]  Unmodified counter force attack.
[00:48:18.224 --> 00:48:19.464]  And now the really bad ones.
[00:48:19.464 --> 00:48:29.049]  Slow motion... And it goes on with augmenting, disarming attack, civilian devastation attack, when they hit our cities.
[00:48:29.991 --> 00:48:32.912]  Alex, that's the Pentagon's war plan for Ukraine right now as we speak.
[00:49:00.487 --> 00:49:25.606]  I believe that's their draft war plan, and that's what they plan to do there at the Pentagon, and the Bidenites will sign off on it, moving up those stages of escalation, pursuant to their theory of escalation dominance, that they have escalation dominance, until the Russians back down.
[00:49:25.606 --> 00:49:26.667]  That's the way they see it.
[00:49:26.667 --> 00:49:29.249]  Explain escalation dominance for folks that haven't studied this.
[00:49:30.029 --> 00:49:35.010]  In layman's terms, they believe every step of the escalation, quote, the U.S.
[00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:39.392]  will be in charge and controlling it, even though it'll be totally destructive to both sides.
[00:49:39.392 --> 00:49:53.336]  They believe they're going to come out in the end on top, which is what Dr. Strangelove is all about, based on some real events and some real battle plans, of where the Pentagon and Colonel Suleiman Limitzer tried to push a nuclear war to Kennedy, saying it'll be survivable.
[00:49:53.336 --> 00:49:56.977]  Yeah, we'll lose 30, 40 million Americans, but we'll win in the end.
[00:49:56.977 --> 00:49:58.337]  And he said, I'm not a mass murder.
[00:50:00.663 --> 00:50:02.104]  Alex, you're basically right.
[00:50:02.104 --> 00:50:23.455]  Again, I believe, pursuant to their doctrine of escalation dominance, which goes back to Tom Schelling, a head of me at Harvard, that they believe they control every rung of that ladder of escalation you see there by Kant, and that they believe that at some point,
[00:50:24.451 --> 00:50:27.612]  The Russians will back down and we will prevail.
[00:50:27.612 --> 00:50:29.193]  What if the Russians jump ahead?
[00:50:29.193 --> 00:50:33.815]  What if the Russians don't follow the latter?
[00:50:33.815 --> 00:50:37.216]  Well, they very well might not, Alex.
[00:50:37.216 --> 00:50:51.902]  I really don't know, except my reading of the situation is that President Putin, and not to defend Putin at all, I've been up against Putin too, he's very cautious.
[00:50:52.848 --> 00:51:09.897]  And moves one step at a time throughout this entire crisis, starting with the overthrow of the democratically elected governor of Ukraine by Obama and Biden.
[00:51:09.897 --> 00:51:20.383]  Remember, Obama put Biden in charge of the entire Ukraine project, and he has been in charge of it since then.
[00:51:22.554 --> 00:51:25.598]  How do we stop this?
[00:51:25.598 --> 00:51:37.593]  Well, I think, Alex, what we have to do is to go back to the pledge that Jim Baker gave to Soviet Commissar Gorbachev.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:51.048]  Namely, that in return for Gorbachev agreeing to the reunification of Germany, NATO would not move even one inch to the east.
[00:51:51.048 --> 00:51:57.652]  That pledge was binding as a matter of international law, even though it wasn't in writing.
[00:51:58.272 --> 00:52:00.754]  And to his credit, Bush Sr.
[00:52:00.754 --> 00:52:02.775]  adhered to that pledge.
[00:52:02.775 --> 00:52:11.340]  It was then Clinton and the Democrats who came into power and wantonly violated that pledge.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:21.447]  And let me point out here that the foreign policy guru and Svengali for the Democratic Party has been Brzezinski.
[00:52:22.231 --> 00:52:39.558]  Since the days of Jimmy Carter, and indeed the Jimmy Carter campaign, when he was head of the Trilateral Commission there, paid for by David Rockefeller, and they co-opted Carter into the presidency.
[00:52:40.342 --> 00:52:52.109]  Then, Bush Jr., under the influence of his neocons, publicly stated they wanted Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO.
[00:52:52.109 --> 00:53:06.837]  This precipitated the war by Georgia against Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia, and then the current crisis in Ukraine, Victoria Nuland, the
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:15.184]  The infamous role that she played over there in promoting the coup d'etat.
[00:53:15.184 --> 00:53:20.447]  And now she is Biden's number three official in the State Department.
[00:53:20.447 --> 00:53:26.011]  So if you want proof that the neocons are in charge of what Biden's doing,
[00:53:27.152 --> 00:53:29.173]  Let me ask you this.
[00:53:29.173 --> 00:53:39.920]  Why are we seeing the Pope come out in the last six months three times, and even Kissinger three times, including last week, saying, we need a peace deal now, this is an elite nuclear war, this is out of control, stop it.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:49.427]  When even Kissinger, who is like the omnibudsman of their New World Order, is saying stop, is that some faint by him, or does he really mean that, or why is he saying that?
[00:53:51.707 --> 00:54:00.910]  Well, again, I think it's because they have the same sources that I do and realize how existentially dangerous it is.
[00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:14.493]  But to get back to how to end it, then, the United States government already promised that Ukraine would not join NATO and that Ukraine would remain neutral.
[00:54:14.493 --> 00:54:20.975]  And then they sent Kamala Harris there two months ago to say, oh, they are going to join, which is another provocation.
[00:54:22.654 --> 00:54:24.036]  Of course, sure.
[00:54:24.036 --> 00:54:27.400]  That's why Zelensky came all the way over here.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:38.713]  They brought Zelensky over here and gave him Congress and all the mainstream news media to promote further escalation up that ladder.
[00:54:38.713 --> 00:54:40.415]  But to get back to my point,
[00:54:41.235 --> 00:54:57.198]  It seems to me, looking at the situation, that if the United States government were to agree that Ukraine would not join NATO and could remain neutral, that would de-escalate... Well, that was Putin's only thing he asked for before he invaded.
[00:54:58.499 --> 00:54:59.160]  You're right.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:08.408]  And as a matter of fact, I've read the two treaties that Russia tendered to the Biden administration and to NATO.
[00:55:08.408 --> 00:55:22.240]  And the core obligation they wanted was a commitment in writing, unlike this verbal commitment given to Gorbachev, that Ukraine would not join NATO.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:25.243]  And yet all the public sources indicate
[00:55:25.783 --> 00:55:33.145]  That the Bidenites refuse, absolutely refuse to negotiate this core demand.
[00:55:33.145 --> 00:55:34.226]  So let's close on this.
[00:55:34.226 --> 00:55:38.107]  Gut level for your children and grandchildren, Dr. Boyle.
[00:55:38.107 --> 00:55:43.188]  I mean, a lot of mainline political analysts say greatest danger of nuclear war ever.
[00:55:43.188 --> 00:55:48.550]  I mean, what is your prognosis for the short and midterm right now?
[00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:52.951]  Well, Alex, that's why I drafted my bill of impeachment against Biden.
[00:55:53.593 --> 00:56:02.142]  Right now it is in circulation on Capitol Hill among the Republican House Freedom Caucus.
[00:56:02.142 --> 00:56:14.976]  One congressman I had a 30-minute discussion with, he agreed fully with my analysis of the situation, including the con ladder of escalation
[00:56:15.596 --> 00:56:22.002]  And said he was inclined to introduce my bill of impeachment into Congress.
[00:56:22.002 --> 00:56:26.386]  So we'll have to see what happens after January 3.
[00:56:26.386 --> 00:56:33.372]  But I think if my bill, and there'll be other bills of impeachment introduced against Biden.
[00:56:33.372 --> 00:56:38.437]  Indeed, Biden has hired an entire team of lawyers to deal with these bills of impeachment.
[00:56:38.917 --> 00:56:46.859]  But if my bill is introduced and passed, I believe that will paralyze the Biden administration.
[00:56:46.859 --> 00:56:48.800]  They'll be dead in the water.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:57.103]  Exactly, and Republicans can win major points and save the world, but they won't because they're being financed by the same corporations that think they can survive a nuclear war.
[00:56:57.103 --> 00:56:59.103]  This is just total madness.
[00:56:59.103 --> 00:57:00.824]  Let's not blame it all on Democrats.
[00:57:00.824 --> 00:57:02.164]  I know you're not.
[00:57:02.164 --> 00:57:04.905]  The Republicans are just going along with this because they're bought off to.
[00:57:06.792 --> 00:57:18.217]  Well, there were large numbers of Republicans, and I'm from a political independent house, there were large numbers of Republicans who did not show up for the... No, no, no, I agree the Republicans are better than the Democrats.
[00:57:18.217 --> 00:57:23.799]  I'm just saying some of the Republican leadership's going along with this, because they could get the impeachment going right now.
[00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:29.222]  They have the House, and you know, Jim Jordan's saying, oh, we're thinking about hearings on big tech censorship.
[00:57:29.222 --> 00:57:30.122]  You're thinking about it?
[00:57:30.122 --> 00:57:31.723]  I mean... Right.
[00:57:32.751 --> 00:57:36.735]  No, I mean, this is long beyond the stage of thinking about anything.
[00:57:36.735 --> 00:57:40.418]  We have to have the House pass a bill of impeachment.
[00:57:40.418 --> 00:57:42.980]  Send it right away to the Senate for a trial.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.181]  Dr. Boyle, I know you gotta go.
[00:57:44.181 --> 00:57:44.742]  Two-minute break.
[00:57:44.742 --> 00:57:46.203]  Come back and finish up with closing comments.
[00:57:46.203 --> 00:57:46.944]  We'll talk about your books.
[00:57:49.932 --> 00:57:54.455]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years, since high school, and they had great effects.
[00:57:54.455 --> 00:57:58.157]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[00:57:58.157 --> 00:58:08.984]  And now, with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[00:58:08.984 --> 00:58:10.345]  These products work great for women as well.
[00:58:10.945 --> 00:58:13.366]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[00:58:13.366 --> 00:58:15.828]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name.
[00:58:15.828 --> 00:58:21.651]  We got it discounted for 40% off at InfoWareStore.com under the label InfoWare's Platinum.
[00:58:21.651 --> 00:58:23.892]  We've also got HCH Max Boost.
[00:58:23.892 --> 00:58:25.193]  Read all about it.
[00:58:25.193 --> 00:58:26.554]  Be very safe with it.
[00:58:26.554 --> 00:58:29.976]  I'd take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[00:58:29.976 --> 00:58:31.497]  Don't do it during the day.
[00:58:31.497 --> 00:58:34.518]  1776 testosterone boost.
[00:58:34.518 --> 00:58:35.579]  Totally incredible.
[00:58:35.579 --> 00:58:36.499]  Go read about them.
[00:58:36.499 --> 00:58:37.300]  Learn more about them.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:38.200]  That's right.
[00:58:49.881 --> 00:58:59.045]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[00:58:59.045 --> 00:59:08.190]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:15.315]  We've gone right to the manufacturer, who are listeners, the owner's a fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail.
[00:59:15.315 --> 00:59:20.799]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[00:59:20.799 --> 00:59:22.340]  And not just under one name.
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:27.844]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[00:59:27.844 --> 00:59:31.907]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[00:59:32.347 --> 00:59:34.228]  We're talking about Pain MD.
[00:59:34.228 --> 00:59:36.908]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[00:59:36.908 --> 00:59:39.769]  We're talking about 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:59:39.769 --> 00:59:41.570]  These things are incredible.
[00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:47.492]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your health care provider because they're so powerful.
[00:59:47.492 --> 00:59:51.153]  Get them at InfoWorksStore.com.
[00:59:51.153 --> 00:59:57.075]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:02.593 --> 01:00:04.254]  It is such a blessing.
[01:00:04.254 --> 01:00:05.935]  It is such an honor.
[01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:08.017]  You've backed us to this point.
[01:00:08.017 --> 01:00:14.500]  But we're now on air with you on Friday, December 23rd, 2022.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:21.164]  Able to cover whatever we want, despite the fact that Deep State's fighting around the clock to shut us down.
[01:00:21.164 --> 01:00:27.508]  Well, I've talked a lot about Senator Frank Church and his hearings in the late 1970s, and now suddenly Elon Musk is.
[01:00:27.508 --> 01:00:30.050]  That's a really positive, good thing that's going on.
[01:00:31.877 --> 01:00:45.051]  And on August 17, 1975, Senator Frank Church appeared on NBC's Meet the Press and issued a stark warning about a certain technology perfected by the intelligence community which should be used by the U.S.
[01:00:45.051 --> 01:00:48.875]  government against its own citizens to create total tyranny.
[01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:52.940]  He was talking about the NSA and the spy grids.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:53.801]  And now here it is.
[01:00:55.717 --> 01:01:01.141]  It's only got, at the time I printed this off an hour ago, 809,000 views.
[01:01:01.141 --> 01:01:03.422]  It needs a billion views.
[01:01:03.422 --> 01:01:05.363]  But we now know they spy on us.
[01:01:05.363 --> 01:01:07.284]  We now know the FBI surveillance.
[01:01:07.284 --> 01:01:13.068]  We now know they work against the elections and the American people for their aim.
[01:01:13.068 --> 01:01:14.089]  And what is their aim?
[01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:15.210]  Human empowerment?
[01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:16.370]  Space exploration?
[01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:17.011]  Free energy?
[01:01:17.011 --> 01:01:17.331]  No!
[01:01:17.331 --> 01:01:18.332]  Pedophilia!
[01:01:18.332 --> 01:01:19.252]  Open borders!
[01:01:19.252 --> 01:01:20.373]  Collapsed governments!
[01:01:20.373 --> 01:01:23.695]  Hollywood scum!
[01:01:23.695 --> 01:01:25.136]  If good people
[01:01:27.773 --> 01:01:31.396]  We're using this technology.
[01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:35.320]  I would oppose it because it could be turned for evil.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.683]  But they don't leave any question about their aims.
[01:01:39.683 --> 01:01:42.506]  They don't leave any discussion about their endgame.
[01:01:42.506 --> 01:01:44.848]  They admit their whole plan.
[01:01:46.266 --> 01:01:54.149]  Is the end of our families and the end of the normal human operation, so they can play God as mad scientist and program every facet of our lives.
[01:01:54.149 --> 01:02:02.453]  So I say, Fauci, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, King Charles, all of you, we've got your challenge.
[01:02:02.453 --> 01:02:13.338]  We understand how real it is and we take the challenge and we tell you, you will destroy us or we will destroy you at Nuremberg too, but you will pay for the crimes that you have committed.
[01:02:14.577 --> 01:02:17.879]  So listeners, realize the power you have today.
[01:02:17.879 --> 01:02:32.048]  Share the links to mfulwords.com forward slash show and Mandop video and share this video everywhere you can of Senator Frank Church from the grave exposing this incredible tyranny.
[01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:37.411]  Here it is ladies and gentlemen, the enemy wishes this didn't exist.
[01:02:37.411 --> 01:02:40.654]  Let me tell you this, in the
[01:02:42.282 --> 01:02:48.609]  We need to develop a capacity to know what potential enemies are doing.
[01:02:48.609 --> 01:03:00.041]  The United States government has perfected a technological capability that enables us to monitor the messages that go through the air.
[01:03:01.843 --> 01:03:10.466]  These messages are between ships at sea, they could be between units, military units in the field.
[01:03:10.466 --> 01:03:19.968]  We have a very extensive capability of intercepting messages wherever they may be in the airwaves.
[01:03:19.968 --> 01:03:28.511]  Now that is necessary and important to the United States as we look abroad at enemies or potential enemies.
[01:03:29.656 --> 01:03:31.197]  We must know.
[01:03:31.197 --> 01:03:37.401]  At the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around on the American people.
[01:03:37.401 --> 01:03:42.705]  And no American would have any privacy left, such as the capability to monitor everything.
[01:03:42.705 --> 01:03:46.668]  Telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter.
[01:03:46.668 --> 01:03:49.810]  There would be no place to hide.
[01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:57.015]  If this government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever took charge in this country,
[01:03:58.015 --> 01:04:08.860]  The technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny.
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.922]  And there would be no way to fight back.
[01:04:11.922 --> 01:04:24.128]  Because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know.
[01:04:25.237 --> 01:04:28.118]  Such is the capability of this technology.
[01:04:28.118 --> 01:04:30.098]  Now, why is this investigation important?
[01:04:30.098 --> 01:04:31.559]  I'll tell you why.
[01:04:31.559 --> 01:04:36.180]  Because I don't want to see this country ever go across the bridge.
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:43.082]  I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America.
[01:04:43.082 --> 01:04:51.624]  And we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision.
[01:04:52.645 --> 01:04:55.667]  So that we never cross over that abyss.
[01:04:55.667 --> 01:05:00.170]  That's the abyss from which there is no return.
[01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:02.411]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[01:05:02.411 --> 01:05:06.414]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[01:05:06.414 --> 01:05:07.755]  There's a solution.
[01:05:07.755 --> 01:05:08.735]  The Wellness Company.
[01:05:08.735 --> 01:05:12.037]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[01:05:12.037 --> 01:05:19.242]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[01:05:19.502 --> 01:05:45.557]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[01:05:46.557 --> 01:05:47.157]  We're good to go.
[01:06:15.627 --> 01:06:21.771]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this special Friday edition.
[01:06:21.771 --> 01:06:29.717]  He hasn't been on with us for three, four months because he's been so incredibly busy already expanding his huge operation.
[01:06:29.717 --> 01:06:32.999]  Tyler Bennett is a respected tax lawyer.
[01:06:32.999 --> 01:06:37.122]  He's got hundreds of lawyers and CPAs and other crew working under him.
[01:06:37.122 --> 01:06:39.943]  He's who gives me advice on my taxes.
[01:06:39.943 --> 01:06:42.345]  But he's not just here about taxes today.
[01:06:42.345 --> 01:06:44.707]  Now you can protect yourself and why it's so critical.
[01:06:45.707 --> 01:06:53.278]  In the last week of December to make decisions you may have forgotten about or not known about but I've been trying to get him on for four months.
[01:06:53.278 --> 01:07:01.549]  He's been so busy with other companies and trust companies and things they were acquiring that he couldn't come on but he's finally here and I was talking to him last week and I said
[01:07:02.674 --> 01:07:03.954]  Please come on in January.
[01:07:03.954 --> 01:07:08.575]  And he said, actually, I'll come on right now because your listeners need to know the last week of December is so key.
[01:07:08.575 --> 01:07:12.476]  So we're going to get to that up front by Christmas present to you.
[01:07:12.476 --> 01:07:13.457]  And he's a great sponsor.
[01:07:13.457 --> 01:07:14.957]  So you support the show.
[01:07:14.957 --> 01:07:16.697]  You save him a lot of money.
[01:07:16.697 --> 01:07:18.038]  It's so easy to do.
[01:07:18.038 --> 01:07:18.978]  It's a 360 win.
[01:07:18.978 --> 01:07:22.499]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[01:07:22.499 --> 01:07:27.660]  But I wanted to get him on about taxes and the 70 plus thousand new IRS agents that Biden just hired.
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.340]  He said, listen, that's fine.
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:30.421]  I'll get into that.
[01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:31.241]  But let's talk about
[01:07:32.634 --> 01:07:34.496]  Sam Baikman freed.
[01:07:34.496 --> 01:07:36.257]  Let's talk about the economy.
[01:07:36.257 --> 01:07:38.519]  Let's talk about these other big issues.
[01:07:38.519 --> 01:07:40.621]  So, he's got the inside baseball on that.
[01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:47.026]  We're going to hit next segment and the 70 plus thousand new IRS agents and so much more.
[01:07:47.026 --> 01:07:52.291]  So, the easiest way to find them is jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:07:52.291 --> 01:07:54.973]  It goes to their main website, American Tax Relief, or
[01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:56.730]  Thank you for having me.
[01:08:14.455 --> 01:08:37.685]  Incredible things you can do at year-end that so many people think it's too late to do, that are such easy moves to make with a law firm behind them, meaning when you follow what they're saying and you have a letter from them and you do it, that means it's authorized, it's protected, and they know you've got backing, which means it's 70 plus thousand new IRS agents on average will move on to an easier target.
[01:08:37.685 --> 01:08:39.146]  Tyler Bennett, is that an accurate statement?
[01:08:40.564 --> 01:08:42.205]  That is accurate, Alex.
[01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:43.506]  And thanks for having me on again.
[01:08:43.506 --> 01:08:46.448]  Merry Christmas to both you, your family and the viewers.
[01:08:46.448 --> 01:08:59.817]  The thing is, at the end of the year, right, Fortune 500 companies know this is the time to come up with deductions because after January 1st, any money you've spent is now in next year, not this year.
[01:08:59.817 --> 01:09:00.277]  Right.
[01:09:00.277 --> 01:09:05.781]  So if you want to be able to take deductions for this year, you've got nine days before the end of the year to do it.
[01:09:05.781 --> 01:09:08.543]  That's why it's crucial to act now.
[01:09:08.543 --> 01:09:10.044]  So let's talk about Fortune 500.
[01:09:10.404 --> 01:09:10.604]  I think so.
[01:09:32.791 --> 01:09:33.291]  Right.
[01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:36.173]  And so the laws are changing in 2023.
[01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:38.034]  That's a huge change.
[01:09:38.034 --> 01:09:40.595]  We got to make sure that we take these deductions now.
[01:09:40.595 --> 01:09:43.697]  Another example is for all the small business owners out there.
[01:09:43.697 --> 01:09:46.338]  You have a flow through entity or anything like that.
[01:09:46.338 --> 01:09:56.743]  Your last chance to make sure that you're able to take the 20 percent flow through deduction, which is a 20 percent deduction of all your income that's qualified small business income.
[01:09:56.743 --> 01:09:58.044]  That's substantial.
[01:09:58.044 --> 01:09:58.224]  Right.
[01:09:58.944 --> 01:10:03.088]  Well, we have to make sure you are set up by that by the end of this year.
[01:10:03.088 --> 01:10:05.950]  Otherwise, you'll be setting it up for it next year, which is great.
[01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:09.012]  But we want to make sure we gave you all these savings this year.
[01:10:09.012 --> 01:10:09.533]  Right.
[01:10:09.533 --> 01:10:10.333]  That's what it's all about.
[01:10:10.333 --> 01:10:14.797]  We've got to act now while it's still twenty twenty two before it's twenty twenty three.
[01:10:14.797 --> 01:10:19.060]  Now, here's another major thing is the IRS has been really gung ho.
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:19.641]  And you know this.
[01:10:19.641 --> 01:10:20.261]  You've read the news.
[01:10:20.261 --> 01:10:26.906]  You've heard that Uber drivers and people who sell stuff on eBay and even hell, if you
[01:10:28.208 --> 01:10:29.449]  Split dinner with your friends.
[01:10:29.449 --> 01:10:39.058]  We know that the IRS is going hardcore on the $600 requirement of money being transferred on any of these money apps or anything like that.
[01:10:39.058 --> 01:10:43.141]  Etsy, Venmo, PayPal, the like.
[01:10:43.141 --> 01:10:48.806]  And the thing is, is just like the American government, you are guilty until proven innocent.
[01:10:48.806 --> 01:10:54.251]  And if you make the wrong choice and say, hey, this is for my friends and it was
[01:10:55.075 --> 01:11:12.569]  Actually something that you received payment for well now you've committed perjury right so the name of the game here is you cannot Break the law that is never going to work in your favor what we can do is use the law Towards our benefits to make sure you're paying the least amount of time explain that to people
[01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:27.874]  When you have a real tax firm with real lawyers that don't just sit there and milk you like so many tax firms I've used before, that gives you the knowledge, cuts right to the chase, gives you a great deal, and then just basically gets paid a percentage of the savings, it's all done, it's all easy, this is not rocket science.
[01:11:27.874 --> 01:11:30.255]  The elites all use these rules for themselves.
[01:11:30.255 --> 01:11:34.797]  They don't want the general public to have it, which is why they change the tax laws every couple years.
[01:11:34.797 --> 01:11:37.338]  And I did make a mistake, and when I do it, I apologize.
[01:11:38.079 --> 01:11:38.500]  I said 76,000.
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.346]  I'm sorry, it's 87,000 new IRS agents.
[01:11:40.346 --> 01:11:40.767]  I apologize.
[01:11:47.626 --> 01:11:50.348]  It's 87,000 Alex, that is correct.
[01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:58.734]  And the thing is, so you remember we talked about this before, there's that box on your 1040 that says, do I have any digital assets?
[01:11:58.734 --> 01:12:10.163]  And they're including now commodities, gold and silver in this question as well, because they're realizing that a lot of people, due to crypto and other means, have been under-reporting their income.
[01:12:10.163 --> 01:12:11.284]  And what I am telling you is if
[01:12:11.924 --> 01:12:27.580]  You fall into this category, you stand to benefit a thousand percent by coming out of that hole yourself, and we can make sure you're paying the least amount of taxes legally, then if the IRS uses one of these new 87,000 people to knock on your door.
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:34.026]  Because when they knock on your door, they're going to hand you a business card, and they're going to have a gun in their holster, and at that point you're already in trouble.
[01:12:34.386 --> 01:12:40.268]  Folks that don't know, you go to these other big tax preparing places, they're literally screwing you on purpose.
[01:12:40.268 --> 01:12:41.309]  They're not standing up.
[01:12:41.309 --> 01:12:42.990]  But a real tax firm like you does that.
[01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:49.852]  It's so easy for basically almost everybody, whether somebody's a billionaire or makes $50,000 a year, you need to know these tactics.
[01:12:49.852 --> 01:12:53.374]  It makes me so upset that folks don't understand how easy this is to do.
[01:12:54.761 --> 01:12:55.782]  That's right, Alex.
[01:12:55.782 --> 01:13:06.090]  And of course, as we all know, this in this country, this was a system that was designed to keep the club, the rich elitist in power at the expense of everybody else.
[01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:06.690]  Right.
[01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:11.434]  And knowledge, knowledge is the biggest thing between the upper class and everybody else.
[01:13:11.434 --> 01:13:16.277]  So we're trying to spread that knowledge because the rules are out there for you to use.
[01:13:16.277 --> 01:13:20.721]  It does not matter if you are a small mom and pop or a multi-billion dollar corporation.
[01:13:21.161 --> 01:13:30.544]  There are tax rules and tax codes that you can use that make sure you're paying the least amount in taxes as possible, because that is your right as a taxpayer.
[01:13:30.544 --> 01:13:44.228]  And if you remember, we talked about before, last year and the year before, the IRS has made more money than ever before, because post COVID, a lot of people started small businesses where they were wage earning employees before.
[01:13:44.228 --> 01:13:48.129]  And now they're not privy to the amount of deductions that they can take.
[01:13:48.129 --> 01:13:50.690]  And this is who I want you guys right now that had
[01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:55.673]  Small businesses that you started this year or last year, you overpaid the IRS.
[01:13:55.673 --> 01:13:58.976]  Let's make sure you don't overpay the IRS this year.
[01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:05.801]  You got nine days to make sure that we're filing correctly, that we have the flow-through and the entity set up.
[01:14:05.801 --> 01:14:11.024]  If we need to separate the entities into a C-corporation because you're making too much money, or we need to do the 20% flow-through.
[01:14:12.225 --> 01:14:19.588]  These are all options available, but we need to take advantage of them now before 2023, because in 2023, guess what?
[01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:21.989]  Then we'll be doing it for 2023, not this year.
[01:14:21.989 --> 01:14:26.791]  So we've got to act now because you stand to save a lot of money before the end of the year.
[01:14:26.791 --> 01:14:29.272]  Again, folks, this is a sure win.
[01:14:29.272 --> 01:14:31.473]  So many things out there that say they're sure wins are frauds.
[01:14:32.213 --> 01:14:42.038]  If you know the tax law, have real tax lawyers that look at what you have and cut right to the best deal for you in almost every case, unless you're already being advised grade, which most people aren't, you're going to save money.
[01:14:42.038 --> 01:14:45.540]  The Bible says the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.100]  And it really does go down to that.
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:56.685]  And it makes me so frustrated that like, oh, if you have vitamin D and you're taking, you know, three times your daily allowance, the studies show you almost can't get a viral infection.
[01:14:56.685 --> 01:14:57.866]  Some studies say you can.
[01:14:58.386 --> 01:15:08.961]  But it's like magic, but people just don't know what a sure thing vitamin D3 is, or the sure thing of using the tax code that the system is using for itself, but doesn't want you to have.
[01:15:10.282 --> 01:15:11.043]  Correct, Alex.
[01:15:11.043 --> 01:15:15.248]  And the thing is, like you said before, they make sure that they change the tax code.
[01:15:15.248 --> 01:15:16.570]  Really, it changes with the regime.
[01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:20.515]  So every four years or so, the tax code changes on average.
[01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:25.341]  And when we're talking about overhauls of the tax code, they change everything.
[01:15:25.341 --> 01:15:28.685]  So we haven't even seen the full ramifications of
[01:15:29.005 --> 01:15:30.846]  The Democrats' tax overhaul.
[01:15:30.846 --> 01:15:33.207]  The last overhaul was the Republican one, right?
[01:15:33.207 --> 01:15:47.654]  Which is giving us all these options that we're able to use and grandfather you in before Biden changes the law, which the acts are already in Congress, and make the tax rates higher and make it harder for you to take deductions.
[01:15:47.654 --> 01:15:48.075]  That's right.
[01:15:48.075 --> 01:15:49.475]  Everybody should call your folks.
[01:15:49.475 --> 01:15:52.437]  Everybody should talk to you and do a consultation.
[01:15:52.437 --> 01:15:53.937]  It's so important.
[01:15:53.937 --> 01:15:55.358]  Go there now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:55.358 --> 01:15:56.419]  Jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:15:59.497 --> 01:16:10.786]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:16:10.786 --> 01:16:12.667]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:16:12.667 --> 01:16:14.128]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:16:14.128 --> 01:16:15.649]  Your ability to speak freely.
[01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:17.351]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[01:16:17.351 --> 01:16:18.632]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[01:16:18.632 --> 01:16:20.033]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:16:20.453 --> 01:16:25.298]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[01:16:25.298 --> 01:16:27.680]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.702]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[01:16:29.702 --> 01:16:36.649]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:42.675]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[01:16:42.675 --> 01:16:51.624]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[01:16:51.624 --> 01:16:53.967]  1776 is the promo code.
[01:16:53.967 --> 01:16:57.891]  The destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[01:16:59.827 --> 01:17:06.700]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[01:17:07.489 --> 01:17:09.530]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:11.250]  They know we're telling the truth.
[01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:12.811]  They know we've got their number.
[01:17:12.811 --> 01:17:17.532]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:25.415]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[01:17:25.415 --> 01:17:35.798]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[01:17:36.803 --> 01:17:38.284]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:18:01.454 --> 01:18:03.235]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:18:03.235 --> 01:18:05.296]  This is an information war.
[01:18:05.296 --> 01:18:09.998]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:18:09.998 --> 01:18:16.461]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor Sanitz, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[01:18:16.921 --> 01:18:17.682]  We're good to go.
[01:18:38.496 --> 01:18:46.425]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[01:18:46.425 --> 01:18:48.747]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[01:18:48.747 --> 01:18:50.589]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:18:50.589 --> 01:18:51.731]  We're going over the top.
[01:18:51.731 --> 01:18:53.232]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[01:18:53.232 --> 01:18:56.276]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[01:18:59.155 --> 01:19:00.836]  You want to beat the New World Order?

[01:19:02.678 --> 01:19:10.764]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[01:19:10.764 --> 01:19:14.907]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[01:19:14.907 --> 01:19:17.570]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[01:19:19.451 --> 01:19:24.132]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[01:19:24.132 --> 01:19:26.133]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[01:19:26.133 --> 01:19:27.953]  So please keep me on the field.
[01:19:27.953 --> 01:19:33.174]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy, while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[01:19:52.725 --> 01:19:55.468]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[01:20:16.619 --> 01:20:23.864]  Well, it's almost Christmas 2022, almost to 2023, hard to believe.
[01:20:23.864 --> 01:20:28.988]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday, December 23rd, worldwide transmission.
[01:20:28.988 --> 01:20:35.573]  Tyler Bennett's here, who's really a financial expert and amazing lawyer, and I want to get into the new developments that happened yesterday with him.
[01:20:36.823 --> 01:20:37.103]  Thank you.
[01:20:53.377 --> 01:20:54.878]  GetaTaxLawyer.com.
[01:20:54.878 --> 01:20:57.540]  That's G-A-T-L dot com.
[01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.180]  G-A-T-L dot com.
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:03.583]  Just make sure you tell them Alex Jones sent you so we get the sponsorship and the support.
[01:21:03.583 --> 01:21:05.364]  G-A-T-L dot com.
[01:21:05.364 --> 01:21:06.345]  360WIN.
[01:21:06.345 --> 01:21:07.105]  Or give them a call.
[01:21:07.105 --> 01:21:07.205]  833-900-4285.
[01:21:07.205 --> 01:21:07.225]  833-900...
[01:21:12.088 --> 01:21:16.671]  There it is on screen, 4285, and it's a free consultation.
[01:21:16.671 --> 01:21:22.994]  Call in, tell them what's going on, then find out what they can do for you, and then sign up with them, and it is a win-win across the board.
[01:21:22.994 --> 01:21:33.020]  Before we get into the whole situation with cryptocurrency and Sam Bateman Freed and the rest of it, what other services are you guys offering right now, and why is the last few days of December so critical?
[01:21:34.577 --> 01:21:43.279]  So the last few days in December is critical because this is your last time to take any deductions that could be used for this year in twenty twenty two.
[01:21:43.279 --> 01:21:49.500]  If you spend money on January 1st, even if it's for your business, that's twenty twenty three deductions.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:49.900]  Right.
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:52.181]  So we want to be able to write off stuff in twenty twenty two.
[01:21:52.181 --> 01:21:55.562]  We need to make especially if you already spent the money.
[01:21:55.562 --> 01:22:00.983]  We need to be able to make note of that and make sure we have it properly allocated and that you're
[01:22:01.678 --> 01:22:06.702]  First of all, your whole entire entity structure is the right way because... And by the way, here's an example.
[01:22:06.702 --> 01:22:09.805]  I'm in personal bankruptcy because of all the attacks and the rest of it.
[01:22:09.805 --> 01:22:19.273]  And so I've hired an outside great accounting firm to come in and they go, Mr. Jones, do you realize the last six, seven years, when you use an American Express card for the company,
[01:22:20.290 --> 01:22:21.110]  We're good to go.
[01:22:35.993 --> 01:22:41.841]  Millions of dollars on my American Express that I paid for was for trips and journalism and things we did.
[01:22:41.841 --> 01:22:42.541]  It wasn't just me.
[01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:50.872]  They had a bunch of cards under me and that's an example of me using a mainline accounting CPA firm that didn't even look at it and I just thought they would.
[01:22:50.872 --> 01:22:51.493]  You guys will.
[01:22:52.965 --> 01:22:56.429]  Yes, that's a great example, Alex, because this happens to a lot of people.
[01:22:56.429 --> 01:23:02.535]  It's, hey, I've got a business, but I end up using a different card that's not in the business name to use for business expenses.
[01:23:02.535 --> 01:23:04.477]  That doesn't mean it's no longer a business expense.
[01:23:04.477 --> 01:23:06.939]  It needs to be properly accounted, right?
[01:23:06.939 --> 01:23:10.162]  And sometimes you have to go through the accounts and do what's called a forensic account.
[01:23:10.202 --> 01:23:11.742]  By the way, I'm interrupting, but slow down.
[01:23:11.742 --> 01:23:12.743]  I saw that headline a month ago.
[01:23:12.743 --> 01:23:14.263]  The IRS made the most money last year.
[01:23:14.263 --> 01:23:14.503]  Why is that?
[01:23:38.396 --> 01:23:54.410]  So the reason the IRS made the most money last year and they also made the most money the year before as well is because what happened in 2020 with the COVID disaster is a lot of people lost their employment, their W-2 paying jobs, their salary jobs, and they had to start a small business.
[01:23:54.410 --> 01:23:58.214]  And because of the lack of education, they were working a job their whole time.
[01:23:58.214 --> 01:24:02.637]  They don't know what deductions they can now take as a small business owner.
[01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:05.420]  And so that's why I am here is let me look.
[01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:18.887]  Listen, I don't care what industry you're in, my accounting staff can figure out the maximum amount of deductions that you can take this year for 2022 so that you don't make 2022, again, the most profitable year for the IRS as well.
[01:24:19.631 --> 01:24:23.093]  Because listen, they're going to get their money starting twenty three.
[01:24:23.093 --> 01:24:26.876]  I was at the IRS conference two weeks ago.
[01:24:26.876 --> 01:24:31.699]  I spoke to Commissioner Redding and I spoke to the deputy commissioner of collections.
[01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:33.900]  OK, and here's exactly what they told me.
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:38.684]  They said we made so much money last year that we really didn't have to focus on collections.
[01:24:38.684 --> 01:24:44.788]  But in twenty twenty three, we're putting the hammer down and we are coming after everybody very hard.
[01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:45.528]  We've hired eighty
[01:24:48.610 --> 01:25:00.119]  They said they're going after the crypto people the hardest because they know that the whole DeFi ecosystem is kind of created on, you know, not paying taxes.
[01:25:00.119 --> 01:25:04.843]  So because that is the case, that's the people they want to hit the hardest the first.
[01:25:04.843 --> 01:25:08.165]  And if you are involved at all in crypto, listen, I am as well.
[01:25:08.165 --> 01:25:12.449]  And so I tell you this as a friend, if you're involved in crypto, what you need to do is
[01:25:14.190 --> 01:25:17.911]  Yes, there's a box on the 1040 that says, do you have any crypto assets?
[01:25:17.911 --> 01:25:19.092]  You check yes.
[01:25:19.092 --> 01:25:21.993]  Because even if you're not making any money, it doesn't matter.
[01:25:21.993 --> 01:25:30.216]  Because what the IRS is going to do when they find out that you do have those assets and you said no, you committed perjury because you signed that tax return.
[01:25:30.216 --> 01:25:38.219]  And that carries a much heftier fine than, oh, I underreported some income that I later fixed the issue and paid tax on.
[01:25:38.219 --> 01:25:40.520]  And notice how that ties into their raising interest rates.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.661]  They're getting ready to hammer the little guy next year.
[01:25:43.678 --> 01:25:44.198]  Correct.
[01:25:44.198 --> 01:26:08.535]  And that is the secret hidden tax, is when they raise interest rates, they make money more expensive, everybody's got less of it, and your tax rate is still the same, meaning the brackets, which means even if you get a small inflation adjustment at work, that could put you up into the next tax bracket, because they raised tax brackets 4% this year, but inflation is 8% on average.
[01:26:08.535 --> 01:26:10.056]  So really, you're getting taxed
[01:26:11.157 --> 01:26:13.018]  About half of the rate of inflation.
[01:26:28.789 --> 01:26:42.408]  I want to get into Sam Bankman-Freed and him making bail and all this next segment, but what other services do you have for people that aren't in a rush but should call you and who think they're a normal tax lawyer or they're normal CPAs?
[01:26:42.408 --> 01:26:44.311]  Tell them, because in my experience, they don't tell you any of this.
[01:26:45.370 --> 01:26:46.210]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:26:46.210 --> 01:26:47.731]  So we do three things.
[01:26:47.731 --> 01:26:50.192]  The past, the present, and the future, right?
[01:26:50.192 --> 01:26:52.694]  The present is your current tax filings.
[01:26:52.694 --> 01:27:06.600]  We make sure for this year you're paying the least amount of tax possible, whether that means forming an entity for you, forming a trust for you, other sorts of entity options, corporations, because the corporate tax code is the lowest in the entire country.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.381]  You as an individual, me as an individual,
[01:27:08.661 --> 01:27:11.383]  We pay more in taxes than corporations.
[01:27:11.383 --> 01:27:13.404]  So corporate vehicles are great.
[01:27:13.404 --> 01:27:14.705]  That's something we can help you out with.
[01:27:14.705 --> 01:27:16.406]  The future is what we do now.
[01:27:16.406 --> 01:27:18.087]  That's called tax planning.
[01:27:18.087 --> 01:27:21.029]  That's saying, hey, I made X amount of dollars this year.
[01:27:21.029 --> 01:27:25.692]  I plan on making more than that next year, but I don't want to pay overpay on taxes.
[01:27:25.692 --> 01:27:36.259]  So let's get you set up in the right entity structuring and deductions and likewise, so that at the end of the year and when you make those quarterly estimated tax payments, it's not breaking the bank.
[01:27:40.545 --> 01:27:42.585]  The last thing we do is the past, right?
[01:27:42.585 --> 01:27:52.947]  And this is just reality is there's a lot of people out there that are already in the situation where they owe the IRS or they owe the state government more than they can afford to pay back.
[01:27:52.947 --> 01:27:59.788]  And the thing is this, if you just give the IRS a call or give the state a call, they're going to have their hand out and say, well, you want to pay us?
[01:27:59.788 --> 01:28:00.789]  Pay us in full.
[01:28:00.789 --> 01:28:02.089]  But the reality situation is
[01:28:02.429 --> 01:28:04.670]  You have to realize you're dealing with a collection agency.
[01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:07.350]  The IRS is the largest collection agency in the world.
[01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:11.872]  And you know if you deal with a regular collection agency, they will take less than you owe.
[01:28:11.872 --> 01:28:15.753]  Now the thing is, they know that you're a layperson and they won't tell you that and they won't talk to you.
[01:28:15.753 --> 01:28:24.595]  But when they talk to a lawyer, a professional, a tax professional that deals with the IRS in general like we do, we will be able to negotiate that sum for you.
[01:28:24.595 --> 01:28:26.956]  And a lot of times you're able to negotiate it on average, what, 80%?
[01:28:29.196 --> 01:28:35.378]  It depends on everyone's situation, but we have many cases where we're able to lower it 80%, if not even more.
[01:28:35.378 --> 01:28:36.739]  I know, a lot 90, yeah.
[01:28:36.739 --> 01:28:43.101]  So folks, you're insane if you don't go to jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285.
[01:28:43.101 --> 01:28:45.061]  My Christmas present to you and the broadcast.
[01:28:45.061 --> 01:28:46.202]  We help the viewers.
[01:28:46.202 --> 01:28:46.982]  It funds the show.
[01:28:46.982 --> 01:28:48.082]  We promote freedom.
[01:28:48.082 --> 01:28:48.623]  Win-win.
[01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:52.044]  Tyler Bennett straight ahead with the FDX scandal and more.
[01:28:52.044 --> 01:28:52.524]  Stay with us.
[01:28:59.446 --> 01:29:10.735]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:29:10.735 --> 01:29:12.636]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:29:12.636 --> 01:29:14.097]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:29:14.097 --> 01:29:15.598]  Your ability to speak freely.
[01:29:15.598 --> 01:29:17.300]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:18.581]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[01:29:18.581 --> 01:29:19.982]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:29:20.402 --> 01:29:25.246]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[01:29:25.246 --> 01:29:27.648]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[01:29:27.648 --> 01:29:29.650]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[01:29:29.650 --> 01:29:36.596]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[01:29:37.236 --> 01:29:42.640]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:51.566]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[01:29:51.566 --> 01:29:59.791]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[01:29:59.791 --> 01:30:04.374]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars?
[01:30:04.374 --> 01:30:06.656]  Attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[01:30:07.438 --> 01:30:09.498]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[01:30:09.498 --> 01:30:11.199]  They know we're telling the truth.
[01:30:11.199 --> 01:30:12.759]  They know we've got their number.
[01:30:12.759 --> 01:30:17.480]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:25.362]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[01:30:25.362 --> 01:30:35.764]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[01:30:36.812 --> 01:30:37.913]  InfowarsMD is finally here!

[01:33:27.083 --> 01:33:30.265]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this Friday edition of the broadcast.
[01:33:30.265 --> 01:33:32.888]  Tyler Bennett's been so busy the last four months he hasn't been able to come on.
[01:33:33.428 --> 01:33:37.150]  But he's here with G-A-T-L, getataxlawyer.com.
[01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:42.873]  If you want to support us, it takes you to the same URL, jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285.
[01:33:42.873 --> 01:33:45.455]  They're a great sponsor.
[01:33:45.455 --> 01:33:48.676]  They're great tax lawyers and CPAs, and they cut right to the chase.
[01:33:48.676 --> 01:33:51.198]  They don't rope you along and get a bunch of money out of you.
[01:33:51.198 --> 01:33:54.079]  They look at what they can save you and try to get a percentage of that.
[01:33:54.079 --> 01:33:55.240]  This is a total win.
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:34:01.463]  Everybody should be calling him, from somebody that works at a restaurant, to somebody that owns a car dealership, to somebody that's worth $100 million.
[01:34:03.044 --> 01:34:04.946]  Most people are getting that advice.
[01:34:04.946 --> 01:34:06.989]  Now, you've got your ear to the ground.
[01:34:06.989 --> 01:34:11.133]  You're involved with stuff all over the country, all sorts of trust and businesses and you name it.
[01:34:11.133 --> 01:34:16.779]  And you've been saying a lot of things that I've been following that have really come true with the whole FTX and St.
[01:34:16.779 --> 01:34:19.042]  Bankman fried and all the rest of it.
[01:34:19.042 --> 01:34:21.925]  So what do you make of that ongoing scandal and the latest developments?
[01:34:23.269 --> 01:34:23.769]  Okay, Alex.
[01:34:23.769 --> 01:34:27.271]  See, this is where everything comes full circle, right?
[01:34:27.271 --> 01:34:30.173]  And as I was saying to you before, there's that box you have to check on the 1040.
[01:34:30.173 --> 01:34:32.475]  Do you have crypto assets or not?
[01:34:32.475 --> 01:34:36.077]  Well, everybody already filled that out for last year and the year before.
[01:34:36.077 --> 01:34:43.321]  And here's the thing, is when FTX went down and Sam Bankman Freed went down with it, and he was in jail in the Bahamas,
[01:34:44.033 --> 01:34:56.943]  The reason that he didn't want to go to the United States is because he knew that to get a deal there he's going to have to spill the beans on everybody that invested and did not report their income to the IRS.
[01:34:56.943 --> 01:34:58.685]  And so the IRS is going to have a list
[01:34:59.265 --> 01:35:05.571]  Of everybody that is an American investor that invested in FTX and did not disclose that information.
[01:35:05.571 --> 01:35:13.857]  And so, if that may have happened to you, we need to get a handle on that and fix the problem first.
[01:35:13.857 --> 01:35:20.203]  Because if we go to the IRS and we say, listen, we made a mistake, but we realized that we
[01:35:21.194 --> 01:35:22.774]  Misreport something and report it.
[01:35:22.774 --> 01:35:31.796]  That's going to be treated a heck of a lot nicer than if the IRS finds out that we have willfully neglected to tell them about income information and they come to our door with a gun.
[01:35:31.796 --> 01:35:33.176]  Now we've committed a felony.
[01:35:33.176 --> 01:35:42.658]  So, when FTX went down and Sam Bankman-Fried, who just paid $250 million this morning to get bailed out after he just got extradited, right?
[01:35:42.658 --> 01:35:44.598]  That just happened right now.
[01:35:44.598 --> 01:35:48.239]  I guarantee you, Alex, before he was bailed out
[01:35:48.639 --> 01:35:56.873]  He went into a Department of Justice office where there was the criminal investigation of the IRS, there was the FBI, and more, and they made a deal with him.
[01:35:56.873 --> 01:35:57.775]  They said, look, Sam...
[01:35:58.413 --> 01:36:08.602]  You're 30-something, you're gonna get out of jail when you're 80, or you're gonna spill the beans on everyone who's been illegally hiding money and laundering money in the Bahamas through FTX.
[01:36:08.602 --> 01:36:26.037]  And so, that's where it comes full circle, because like I was telling everybody, you gotta not lie on that form, because now, even if you have just one Bitcoin or something in FTX, and they get the information that you had that, and you wrote on the tax return that you do not have any digital assets,
[01:36:26.457 --> 01:36:27.858]  You've committed perjury, you see.
[01:36:27.858 --> 01:36:30.558]  So that is why it's important.
[01:36:30.558 --> 01:36:32.179]  And here's the thing.
[01:36:32.179 --> 01:36:35.080]  You might be big in crypto and you might say, hey, you know what?
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.481]  I'm not touched by this because I didn't have anything in FTX.
[01:36:38.481 --> 01:36:40.021]  I'm over at Binance.
[01:36:40.021 --> 01:36:42.842]  Well, this is all turning into a chain reaction.
[01:36:42.842 --> 01:36:46.063]  Oh, they're already talking about indicting the Binance head.
[01:36:46.063 --> 01:36:46.663]  Oh, yes.
[01:36:46.663 --> 01:36:51.585]  Because what happened was the Binance guy, Zhang, he had
[01:36:52.966 --> 01:37:02.881]  2.1 billion dollar investment in FTX and Sam Bankman Freed paid him that 2.1 billion dollars in FTX's coin, in their crypto coin.
[01:37:02.881 --> 01:37:07.889]  And so that's what started the whole collapse is this Zang guy who owns Binance then sold it all.
[01:37:08.129 --> 01:37:08.749]  Okay.
[01:37:08.749 --> 01:37:14.792]  And so the thing is, is that opened up the DOJ's eyes to, okay, well, what's Binance doing now?
[01:37:14.792 --> 01:37:27.498]  And what they are alleging is Binance specifically not only was laundering money for the Mexican drug cartels, but also was giving money to Iran past American sanctions.
[01:37:27.498 --> 01:37:32.100]  So these are the kinds of things that you don't want your money involved with because
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:35.362]  These types of people are going to go down for major crimes.
[01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:56.414]  You look at it statistically, only Mitt Romney is allowed to have $100 million tax-free.
[01:37:56.414 --> 01:37:57.294]  Nobody else is.
[01:37:57.294 --> 01:38:02.196]  Only the very top ten of one-tenth of a percent are allowed to do that.
[01:38:02.196 --> 01:38:04.077]  We're little slaves.
[01:38:04.077 --> 01:38:04.798]  We don't get to do that.
[01:38:04.798 --> 01:38:11.020]  But we do get to use the tax law that the minions of the globalists use because they avoid most of it.
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:12.941]  The ultra-elite don't pay taxes.
[01:38:12.941 --> 01:38:16.203]  The minions of the power elite write the law to mitigate it.
[01:38:16.203 --> 01:38:17.824]  We're going to copy what they do.
[01:38:17.824 --> 01:38:18.324]  That's what we do.
[01:38:19.542 --> 01:38:19.982]  Correct.
[01:38:19.982 --> 01:38:23.064]  And here's the thing, too, Alex, is I'm shocked.
[01:38:23.064 --> 01:38:30.089]  Sam Bankman Freed made some really stupid moves, including basing this organization in the Bahamas in the first place.
[01:38:30.089 --> 01:38:32.830]  The Bahamas is not the island to be in if you're trying to hide from the U.S.
[01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:38.434]  government, because they will extradite you, clearly, and they will take your money, as we found out.
[01:38:38.434 --> 01:38:41.816]  They're too closely related to the United States banking system.
[01:38:42.476 --> 01:38:42.877]  I don't know.
[01:38:57.193 --> 01:38:59.774]  Well, they're FACTA compliant down there.
[01:38:59.774 --> 01:39:02.695]  Their banks report what your earnings are to the IRS.
[01:39:02.695 --> 01:39:04.816]  And so it's just not going to work.
[01:39:04.816 --> 01:39:07.317]  It was a bad, it was a poor move from the beginning.
[01:39:07.317 --> 01:39:13.839]  But listen, this guy, like I said, these crypto guys aren't necessarily finance people until they become it.
[01:39:13.839 --> 01:39:16.680]  And so, listen, he made that mistake a long time ago.
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:22.663]  Me and my accountants here were saying, why did he choose to build this empire in the Bahamas as opposed to St.
[01:39:22.663 --> 01:39:26.084]  Kitts or the Marshall Islands or the Cook Islands or any
[01:39:26.264 --> 01:39:34.173]  And again, it's fine if you're offshore if it's a real business, but to run a Ponzi scheme in the Bahamas, that's almost satirical.
[01:39:34.173 --> 01:39:37.236]  It's crazy.
[01:39:37.236 --> 01:39:44.063]  It is crazy, and listen, he was running a Ponzi scheme, so you're right.
[01:39:44.063 --> 01:39:46.265]  That's horrible in its own right.
[01:39:47.230 --> 01:39:51.655]  The Bahamas in general, if you're going to go offshore, listen, we got better places for you to go offshore.
[01:39:51.655 --> 01:39:56.700]  Do not do what this man did, because he's going to go to jail for a long time.
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:56.740]  Or...
[01:39:59.525 --> 01:40:05.670]  What's also likely is the amount of people and the amount of money that he is going to end up fingering.
[01:40:05.670 --> 01:40:10.975]  That's very dangerous too, because a lot of these crypto guys that end up caught like this, they end up dead.
[01:40:10.975 --> 01:40:20.042]  I was about to say, we've had four Russian crypto guys killed in the last month, and will Sam Bankman Freed end up Epstein'd?
[01:40:20.042 --> 01:40:20.583]  Exactly.
[01:40:20.583 --> 01:40:24.446]  That's what I guess is my estimation here.
[01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:29.552]  In the next couple months, we may see him at the end of a shoelace.
[01:40:29.552 --> 01:40:30.993]  And of course, oh, he killed himself.
[01:40:30.993 --> 01:40:34.456]  But we really know that they had to keep him quiet, right?
[01:40:34.456 --> 01:40:35.577]  Because he knew too much.
[01:40:35.577 --> 01:40:37.579]  And we'll see what happens.
[01:40:37.579 --> 01:40:43.824]  I wonder what the Las Vegas betting market will be on Sam Bankman Freed and how soon until he's dead.
[01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:51.297]  Yeah, well, I would take the bet on under rather than over on that one.
[01:40:51.297 --> 01:40:54.661]  Because yes, you're right, there's everybody else in that industry.
[01:40:54.661 --> 01:41:02.050]  Even John McAfee, when he started speaking out about crypto assets and different governments involved, suddenly he ended up dead too, you know?
[01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:02.911]  And so it's
[01:41:03.653 --> 01:41:16.576]  It's, you know, there's a lot of power and especially in the international monetary system where crypto exists as this kind of what they call DeFi, right, where they're trying to get around the centralized banks, get around the government.
[01:41:16.576 --> 01:41:25.158]  Well, the real people that are that are making lots of money from this are criminals, either war criminals or drug criminals or some kind of person like that.
[01:41:25.158 --> 01:41:25.658]  Right.
[01:41:25.658 --> 01:41:29.698]  And so if you're making money off of those people, you're going to go down.
[01:41:29.698 --> 01:41:31.999]  And the thing is, this is here's where I'm warning everybody is.
[01:41:32.299 --> 01:41:38.305]  If you're even just involved when this stuff goes down, you're not going to go down for those crimes.
[01:41:38.305 --> 01:41:42.009]  They're going to get you for underreporting that crypto income and lying on your tax return.
[01:41:42.009 --> 01:41:52.779]  So those are things we can solve now before the IRS sends their 87,000 people to go after everyone on Sam Baikman Friedman's list.
[01:41:52.779 --> 01:41:54.601]  Because the thing is, is
[01:41:55.393 --> 01:41:59.035]  Crypto is all based on blockchain.
[01:41:59.035 --> 01:42:00.816]  It doesn't matter.
[01:42:00.816 --> 01:42:05.299]  When I went to the IRS's conference, they know how crypto tumblers work.
[01:42:05.299 --> 01:42:13.865]  They know how all sorts of crazy DeFi apps work that purport to be able to separate the source of the money from the person.
[01:42:13.865 --> 01:42:16.226]  They already know how it works and they've got it figured out.
[01:42:16.226 --> 01:42:19.388]  You cannot outsmart City Hall, basically, right?
[01:42:19.388 --> 01:42:21.449]  They've got all the money and the resources in the world.
[01:42:21.449 --> 01:42:23.451]  You've got to use City Hall's own trapdoors.
[01:42:23.951 --> 01:42:25.272]  That's exactly right.
[01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:27.373]  So we use City Hall's rules against them.
[01:42:27.373 --> 01:42:30.054]  You're playing by the rules and you'll come out ahead.
[01:42:30.054 --> 01:42:30.835]  All right, folks.
[01:42:30.835 --> 01:42:35.117]  You've got to go to the website jonestaxrelief.com.

[01:43:02.393 --> 01:43:10.480]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.623]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[01:43:14.623 --> 01:43:17.286]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[01:43:19.167 --> 01:43:23.830]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:25.851]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[01:43:25.851 --> 01:43:27.673]  So please keep me on the field.
[01:43:27.673 --> 01:43:32.876]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[01:43:45.844 --> 01:43:47.085]  Please commit now to go
[01:43:47.185 --> 01:43:50.027]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalists.
[01:44:05.114 --> 01:44:11.536]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[01:44:11.536 --> 01:44:16.657]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[01:44:16.657 --> 01:44:18.377]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[01:44:18.377 --> 01:44:24.779]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[01:44:25.519 --> 01:44:30.944]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[01:44:30.944 --> 01:44:35.267]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[01:44:35.267 --> 01:44:44.515]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[01:44:44.515 --> 01:44:45.856]  God bless you all.
[01:44:45.856 --> 01:44:46.897]  I salute you.
[01:44:46.897 --> 01:44:47.858]  I thank you.
[01:44:47.858 --> 01:44:53.363]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[01:44:54.003 --> 01:44:55.344]  The fight is my fight.
[01:44:55.344 --> 01:44:55.965]  It's your fight.
[01:44:55.965 --> 01:44:56.705]  It's our fight.
[01:44:56.705 --> 01:44:59.107]  God bless you all.
[01:44:59.107 --> 01:45:02.169]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years, since high school.
[01:45:02.169 --> 01:45:03.671]  And they had great effects.
[01:45:03.671 --> 01:45:07.353]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[01:45:07.353 --> 01:45:18.182]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[01:45:18.182 --> 01:45:19.543]  These products work great for women as well.
[01:45:20.143 --> 01:45:22.564]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[01:45:22.564 --> 01:45:25.026]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name.
[01:45:25.026 --> 01:45:30.849]  We got it discounted for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.
[01:45:30.849 --> 01:45:33.090]  We've also got HGH Max Boost.
[01:45:33.090 --> 01:45:34.391]  Read all about it.
[01:45:34.391 --> 01:45:35.892]  Be very safe with it.
[01:45:35.892 --> 01:45:39.174]  Take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[01:45:39.174 --> 01:45:40.695]  Don't do it during the day.
[01:45:40.695 --> 01:45:43.716]  1776 testosterone boost.
[01:45:43.716 --> 01:45:44.777]  Totally incredible.
[01:45:44.777 --> 01:45:45.717]  Go read about them.
[01:45:45.717 --> 01:45:46.498]  Learn more about them.
[01:45:47.439 --> 01:45:48.800]  We're good to go.
[01:45:59.059 --> 01:46:08.245]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[01:46:08.245 --> 01:46:17.932]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[01:46:17.932 --> 01:46:28.959]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of Fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[01:46:29.719 --> 01:46:30.299]  Thanks for watching!
[01:47:01.184 --> 01:47:05.785]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:05.785 --> 01:47:18.727]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:18.727 --> 01:47:25.868]  Alright, hour number three is coming up.
[01:47:25.868 --> 01:47:26.588]  It's Friday.
[01:47:26.588 --> 01:47:29.989]  Christmas is just a day and a half, two days away.
[01:47:31.118 --> 01:47:33.740]  And Tyler Bennett of American Tax Relief is here with us.
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:35.121]  Be sure to go to jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:47:35.121 --> 01:47:39.064]  That takes you right to their main site, and then they know that it comes from us, the sponsorship.
[01:47:39.064 --> 01:47:40.165]  A win-win for everybody.
[01:47:40.165 --> 01:47:45.729]  You can also go to the toll-free number, 833-900-4285.
[01:47:45.729 --> 01:47:47.311]  833-900-4285.
[01:47:47.311 --> 01:47:48.592]  You wanted to get into Kanye.
[01:47:48.592 --> 01:47:52.495]  He was on the show a few weeks ago, and a week before that, he was on with Tim Poole.
[01:47:52.495 --> 01:47:53.235]  We're not going to play the clip.
[01:47:53.235 --> 01:47:55.077]  Everybody probably saw it or heard about it.
[01:47:55.077 --> 01:47:57.438]  He said, I'm $50 million in the hole of the IRS.
[01:47:58.439 --> 01:48:00.740]  And they grabbed 75 million out of my account.
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:04.861]  Well, believe me, with him, it's not a joke.
[01:48:04.861 --> 01:48:05.961]  It's not a game.
[01:48:05.961 --> 01:48:07.722]  He's running his whole show.
[01:48:07.722 --> 01:48:09.623]  He fired his lawyers, everybody.
[01:48:09.623 --> 01:48:13.604]  And I get he's like, hey, I don't want lawyers controlling me, but he better get somebody he can trust.
[01:48:14.184 --> 01:48:16.145]  I believe the ones that were running him were bad.
[01:48:16.145 --> 01:48:20.568]  I've seen some of the text messages, but that doesn't mean, like, they're all bad.
[01:48:20.568 --> 01:48:23.170]  It's like, if I've got to fly an airplane, I'm on a pilot, I get a pilot.
[01:48:23.170 --> 01:48:24.650]  It doesn't mean some pilots are good, some are bad.
[01:48:24.650 --> 01:48:30.354]  If I've got to get my tooth worked on, I don't, like, well, I don't trust Dennis, so I'm just going to do it myself.
[01:48:30.354 --> 01:48:33.356]  Sure, you can study for years and know it, but I've studied this stuff for years.
[01:48:33.356 --> 01:48:35.637]  I don't know 10% of what Tyler Bennett knows.
[01:48:35.637 --> 01:48:36.638]  So, I mean, I go to him.
[01:48:36.638 --> 01:48:37.538]  You've got to go to who you trust.
[01:48:37.538 --> 01:48:39.520]  But what would you say to Ye?
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:42.121]  I'll definitely send him this clip if he's not watching.
[01:48:42.121 --> 01:48:43.122]  He watches almost every day.
[01:48:44.676 --> 01:48:52.120]  Well, like I said, so the thing about the IRS is they will take full advantage of anybody they can.
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:56.342]  And Kanye, this is a great example because it's happening to you.
[01:48:56.342 --> 01:49:01.945]  You say the IRS is saying you owe $50 million, but they took $75 out of your bank account.
[01:49:01.945 --> 01:49:02.726]  They levied $75.
[01:49:02.726 --> 01:49:05.347]  That's more than they're saying you owe.
[01:49:05.347 --> 01:49:05.907]  Why?
[01:49:05.907 --> 01:49:06.808]  Because they can.
[01:49:06.808 --> 01:49:12.291]  Because you don't have the correct representation in your corner to make sure that they're not
[01:49:12.931 --> 01:49:15.613]  Violating your rights, which they definitely are right now.
[01:49:15.613 --> 01:49:19.535]  Because the IRS is like any other bully, they can smell weakness.
[01:49:19.535 --> 01:49:23.317]  The second they smell a tiny bit, they're gonna take full advantage.
[01:49:23.317 --> 01:49:28.500]  And so, listen, it's still, they took that $75 million from you about a month ago.
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:32.903]  If you call me quick enough, we should be able to get that back without having to wait for a refund.
[01:49:32.903 --> 01:49:35.965]  Regardless, I can get that money back for you because
[01:49:36.625 --> 01:49:42.349]  They even said, you don't even owe that much, so I don't even think you owe $50 million, but we will find out.
[01:49:42.349 --> 01:49:46.752]  From hearing what he said, what procedure do you think they used?
[01:49:46.752 --> 01:49:52.515]  Well, basically hearing what they said, what they did is they did a pre-assessment levy.
[01:49:52.515 --> 01:49:56.898]  And so this is what happens to big people that have lots of money.
[01:49:56.898 --> 01:50:01.281]  So they're guessing, oh, we think it's $50, we're going to go ahead and charge you penalties and interest now.
[01:50:02.894 --> 01:50:14.440]  No, so what happened is they have only found 50 that he owes so far, and they're saying, we think you may owe more, so we're going to charge you 75, and then see what the difference is.
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:17.501]  Wow, so that is guilty until proven innocent.
[01:50:17.501 --> 01:50:18.602]  Absolutely, my friend.
[01:50:18.602 --> 01:50:25.645]  So he is guilty until proven innocent, and the thing is... Okay, so let's slow down.
[01:50:25.645 --> 01:50:28.047]  Talk to me like I'm five years old, because I kind of am.
[01:50:28.047 --> 01:50:29.487]  Explain how this scam works.
[01:50:29.487 --> 01:50:30.128]  This is big.
[01:50:30.128 --> 01:50:30.528]  Explain it.
[01:50:31.849 --> 01:50:38.352]  Okay, so in a pre-assessment levy, the IRS decides that you owe money.
[01:50:38.352 --> 01:50:43.033]  Now, they do not have an actual signed tax return from either you or them.
[01:50:43.033 --> 01:50:44.974]  Remember, they can do a tax return too.
[01:50:44.974 --> 01:50:47.675]  This is before they've assessed you, even.
[01:50:47.675 --> 01:50:50.757]  Assessment is when they say how much money you owe them.
[01:50:50.757 --> 01:50:59.160]  So before they even have figured that out, they are seizing an even larger amount of money out of your bank account because they
[01:51:00.262 --> 01:51:00.662]  We're good to go.
[01:51:21.570 --> 01:51:22.670]  You actually owe this.
[01:51:22.670 --> 01:51:25.771]  Before that happens, you actually don't owe anything.
[01:51:25.771 --> 01:51:31.272]  So right now, they took $75 million before claiming that's what he owes, right?
[01:51:31.272 --> 01:51:32.853]  And yes, this is Kanye.
[01:51:32.853 --> 01:51:33.933]  It's very big numbers.
[01:51:33.933 --> 01:51:40.634]  But this happens from Kanye West all the way down to, you know, little guy on the street.
[01:51:40.634 --> 01:51:46.856]  Because if the IRS is in a situation where they realize they can take advantage of you and grab
[01:51:47.316 --> 01:51:49.379]  So hypothetically, give us a few hypotheticals.
[01:52:03.687 --> 01:52:04.088]  All right.
[01:52:18.923 --> 01:52:23.186]  They get subsidies from the state, and there's a certain amount that's non-profit, right?
[01:52:23.186 --> 01:52:33.232]  And so, basically, there was a disagreement between the government and the school over what was taxable income.
[01:52:33.232 --> 01:52:40.776]  And so what they did was, they just backed up the last three years of all income they had made, that was reported both on 1120 for taxable income,
[01:52:42.797 --> 01:52:49.760]  And on a 990, which is non-taxable income, and they grouped it all together and levied him for the entire amount.
[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:53.922]  And then we had to go back in there and fill out the 990s and fill out the 1120s.
[01:52:53.922 --> 01:53:02.886]  And as soon as Ye, I'm sorry to interrupt you, as soon as Ye got rid of his representation, which I'm sure wasn't perfect, he had reasons to, they went, we got this guy, let's get him.
[01:53:02.886 --> 01:53:05.647]  It's not that all representation is bad, he needs representation now.
[01:53:06.963 --> 01:53:08.644]  That's exactly what happened, Alex.
[01:53:08.644 --> 01:53:11.185]  And I saw it happen, and I was like, oh no.
[01:53:11.185 --> 01:53:13.167]  It's like I said, they smell, they're like sharks.
[01:53:13.167 --> 01:53:15.868]  I tell you what, after the show, after the show, let's three-way it.
[01:53:15.868 --> 01:53:17.389]  I'm gonna call him.
[01:53:17.389 --> 01:53:18.410]  All right, for sure.
[01:53:18.410 --> 01:53:22.792]  We can definitely help him out, because they smell blood in the water, right?
[01:53:22.792 --> 01:53:25.053]  And blood on the leaves.
[01:53:25.053 --> 01:53:26.014]  That's a kinase arm.
[01:53:26.014 --> 01:53:30.977]  They see the blood on the leaves, and what they know is, we've got an injured
[01:53:31.813 --> 01:53:32.413]  We're good to go.
[01:54:02.381 --> 01:54:04.823]  Incredible, and you're so dead on about that.
[01:54:04.823 --> 01:54:12.890]  It's so painful that the Bible says that people perish for lack of knowledge, and they've written it all for themselves to protect themselves, but then they screw everybody.
[01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:15.532]  That is exactly right.
[01:54:15.532 --> 01:54:16.753]  I went back and looked.
[01:54:16.753 --> 01:54:17.354]  It's just crazy.
[01:54:17.354 --> 01:54:19.035]  I'm sorry.
[01:54:19.035 --> 01:54:22.598]  That's exactly right.
[01:54:22.598 --> 01:54:25.600]  The Bible is the source of knowledge, right?
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:28.303]  And it says right there in the Bible that
[01:54:29.099 --> 01:54:32.923]  Without more knowledge, you are going to perish.
[01:54:32.923 --> 01:54:35.545]  And here, we see it happening in real life.
[01:54:35.545 --> 01:54:40.449]  The Kanye is a very in-your-face example, but it happens all over the place.
[01:54:40.449 --> 01:54:45.013]  That's why they're dumbing the schools down, it's why they're manipulating everything, because the knowledge is all right there.
[01:54:45.013 --> 01:54:45.974]  That's why I'm so frustrated.
[01:54:45.974 --> 01:54:48.917]  I mean, it's all right there.
[01:54:48.917 --> 01:54:55.363]  Remember, knowledge is power, and in the absence of knowledge dies democracy and your freedom.
[01:54:56.934 --> 01:54:59.376]  All right, Tyler, I want to hit one more story.
[01:54:59.376 --> 01:55:06.822]  I want to do five minutes of the next hour with you, and then we'll let you go, because I know it's about to be Christmas weekend here on this Friday edition.
[01:55:06.822 --> 01:55:17.411]  But before I get to this Wells Fargo to pay $3.7 billion over consumer loan violations that affected millions of consumers, this is very IRS-esque, just a corporation acting like the IRS.
[01:55:17.411 --> 01:55:21.154]  What other tidbits do you want to add in the last two and a half minutes?
[01:55:21.154 --> 01:55:24.197]  Well, so this is a great example of
[01:55:25.322 --> 01:55:33.525]  The, you know, the nepotism that exists between this Fortune 500 companies, the banks and the IRS, right?
[01:55:33.525 --> 01:55:37.346]  I mean, the reality of the situation is we look at it large scale.
[01:55:37.346 --> 01:55:40.547]  The government needs these giant corporations to
[01:55:41.367 --> 01:55:42.448]  Function, right?
[01:55:42.448 --> 01:55:49.150]  And in that regard, they are given, they don't operate on the same rules that me and you do, Alex, or any of the listeners.
[01:55:49.150 --> 01:55:51.711]  We're people, we're here, we have to play by the rules.
[01:55:51.711 --> 01:55:59.174]  Wells Fargo, Chase, JP Morgan, all these companies, and this has happened time and time again.
[01:55:59.174 --> 01:56:04.936]  They repeatedly get bailed out from the government and then they, you know, rake it over their customers and
[01:56:05.729 --> 01:56:09.073]  Basically, everybody loses except for the big dogs.
[01:56:09.073 --> 01:56:11.996]  And so I'm here to prevent that because look, I'm wearing this shirt.
[01:56:15.232 --> 01:56:19.556]  We've got what it takes to take what you've got, and that really sums it up.
[01:56:19.556 --> 01:56:30.647]  And especially when you throw into their cronies, the big banks that share information with the IRS, right, to use against you, as well as now Venmo and PayPal and everybody else.
[01:56:30.647 --> 01:56:35.872]  So the thing is, you have to remember that in the game of life, especially here in America,
[01:56:37.364 --> 01:56:44.488]  The government is out to get you, the big cats are out to get you, and if you don't cover your own behind, you're going to get punched in it.
[01:56:44.488 --> 01:56:58.957]  And let's be clear, we have so many great listeners that get into the private Federal Reserve, and you know, bonds, and birth certificates, and all this stuff, a lot of that's real, but the courts don't recognize it, it doesn't go anywhere, and people get in a lot of trouble with it.
[01:56:58.957 --> 01:57:04.681]  You're not telling them stuff that's outside the law, you're telling them the inside baseball of the power structure.
[01:57:05.726 --> 01:57:24.612]  Right, Alex, and I'm glad you brought that up because there are a lot of people out there, good citizens, smart people, that think that the way out of the tax issue is to look up some inconsistency in law that some people have noticed and this and that.
[01:57:24.612 --> 01:57:26.112]  But you can't do that.
[01:57:26.112 --> 01:57:28.693]  They have already adjudicated that and they'll send you to jail.
[01:57:28.693 --> 01:57:31.074]  You've got to play inside City Hall's rules.
[01:57:31.634 --> 01:57:34.839]  We use the IRS's rules against him and that's how you win.
[01:57:34.839 --> 01:57:36.342]  That's how Jeff Bezos wins.
[01:57:36.342 --> 01:57:37.403]  That's how Elon Musk wins.
[01:57:37.403 --> 01:57:38.465]  And that's how you'll win too.
[01:57:38.465 --> 01:57:40.047]  JonesTaxRelief.com.
[01:57:40.047 --> 01:57:40.708]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:40.708 --> 01:57:41.089]  Stay with us.
[01:57:41.089 --> 01:57:43.332]  I want to hit this big Wells Fargo news straight ahead.
[01:57:49.309 --> 01:57:50.950]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:52.811]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[01:57:52.811 --> 01:58:00.895]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[01:58:00.895 --> 01:58:05.037]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[01:58:05.037 --> 01:58:07.698]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[01:58:09.599 --> 01:58:14.262]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[01:58:14.262 --> 01:58:16.263]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[01:58:16.263 --> 01:58:18.084]  So please, keep me on the field.
[01:58:18.084 --> 01:58:23.307]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy, while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[01:58:49.702 --> 01:58:56.650]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[01:58:56.650 --> 01:59:02.537]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[01:59:02.537 --> 01:59:08.884]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[01:59:09.204 --> 01:59:16.432]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:59:16.432 --> 01:59:26.703]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[01:59:27.143 --> 01:59:36.127]  As for Vitamin C and Zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:59:36.127 --> 01:59:42.390]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:47.692]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com, where we promise our roasts
[01:59:52.206 --> 01:59:56.136]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
