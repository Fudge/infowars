[00:09.000 --> 00:36.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.000]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. It is already the 14th
[00:41.000 --> 00:49.520]  day of April, 2008. And we're going to be live here for the next three hours. Joining me
[00:49.520 --> 00:58.840]  in studio today is going to be Kurt Nemo of Infowars.com and TruthNews.com fame. He is
[00:58.840 --> 01:05.840]  visiting here at the headquarters here at the flagship in Austin, Texas, here in our
[01:05.840 --> 01:12.720]  tiny redoubt. He'll be joining us coming up in the middle of the second hour as we cover
[01:12.720 --> 01:20.960]  the latest news and take your phone calls. And then from 1.30 to 3.00 today in studio,
[01:20.960 --> 01:27.200]  former city council member in Austin, Texas, economist, author, documentary filmmaker George
[01:27.200 --> 01:33.040]  Humphrey will be joining us in studio to talk about the war, the economy, and a lot more
[01:33.040 --> 01:39.520]  with George Humphrey for an hour and a half because now we have a four hour show from
[01:39.520 --> 01:48.680]  11 a.m. until 3 p.m. Central Standard Time. And we will be taking your phone calls today
[01:48.680 --> 01:58.240]  as well in this first hour throughout the second, third, and fourth hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58.240 --> 02:08.640]  You can also call us at 512-646-5400. That is the studio line 512-646-5400. And I will
[02:08.640 --> 02:17.760]  air your calls here myself. Different ways to do that. Okay, yesterday I got into eugenics.
[02:17.760 --> 02:23.200]  I got into how they're admitting that their chemtrails sprang the population. I started
[02:23.200 --> 02:28.040]  getting into a story. The government is trying to wrap its mind around yours from the Washington
[02:28.040 --> 02:34.000]  Post, but I want to spend more time on that today as well about the total surveillance
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.120]  grid, not just scanning your face, scanning your license plate, scanning everything you
[02:39.120 --> 02:44.040]  buy and sell, building psychological databases and algorithms. That's already going on for
[02:44.040 --> 02:51.720]  at least a decade. But brain scanners. Now, these are already up in many airports. And
[02:51.720 --> 02:58.880]  they're now announcing it to the slaves. And so we'll be going over that today. Now, this
[02:58.880 --> 03:03.840]  is all a fraud. This is so they can claim the computer seizure terrorist. And they show
[03:03.840 --> 03:11.000]  some idiot jury, the brain pattern of an al-Qaeda. And it's over to the work camp you go because
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.320]  they're advertising on neocontalk radio as a talking point for five years that when we
[03:15.320 --> 03:20.880]  put Americans in camps, because they are secretly aiding al-Qaeda, if you protest the war that
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.160]  aids al-Qaeda, they say that's a cent com line. The military says that not the military men
[03:25.160 --> 03:30.320]  and women 70 plus percent of them know what's going on. But the brass says that criticizing
[03:30.320 --> 03:34.760]  government aids al-Qaeda because the government's fighting al-Qaeda hence criticize government
[03:34.760 --> 03:41.800]  aid al-Qaeda that you shouldn't have to pay for you in prison. And so the talking point
[03:41.800 --> 03:52.680]  is we need labor camps. Of course, the foolish, predominantly redneckian people that mean well
[03:52.680 --> 03:58.520]  and support all of this don't understand that you already compete with the prisons,
[03:58.520 --> 04:05.720]  Abu, with their 20 cents an hour jobs in the prison factories. But it doesn't matter just
[04:05.720 --> 04:09.400]  like with slavery, just like you competed with slaves and it drove down your wages.
[04:09.400 --> 04:14.440]  You still supported slavery of blacks because it made you feel like you were up the totem
[04:14.440 --> 04:19.960]  pole when in reality they got more calories to eat a day than you did on average according
[04:19.960 --> 04:28.040]  to historians. But feeling powerful is more important than being a slave, isn't it?
[04:28.040 --> 04:32.080]  But I'm going to get into illegal immigration first on the other side, some new shocking
[04:32.080 --> 04:38.920]  numbers for you. As we continue to track the criminal activities of the new world order,

[05:14.720 --> 05:23.320]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first

[07:55.560 --> 08:02.120]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:02.120 --> 08:12.400]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:12.400 --> 08:19.480]  Kurt Nemo to be in studio and yes we're going to go ahead and fire the webcam up early for
[08:19.480 --> 08:26.080]  all PrisonPlanet.TV members when he joins us in the middle of the next hour into the
[08:26.080 --> 08:31.720]  bottom of the third hour then George Humphrey joins us in studio. So from 12.30 until three
[08:31.720 --> 08:40.160]  o'clock today we are going to have the webcam for PrisonPlanet.TV members fired up with
[08:40.160 --> 08:49.760]  the document cam, video clip feeds, computer feeds so much more at PrisonPlanet.TV for
[08:49.760 --> 08:55.760]  members 15 since today and that goes to pay for the bandwidth and our whole IT infrastructure
[08:55.760 --> 09:03.120]  that we're trying to beef up and expand and make more redundant and versatile.
[09:03.120 --> 09:06.840]  Alright let me just go ahead and get into this first. Here's just a story out of the
[09:06.840 --> 09:14.600]  UK. Foreigners carry out one in every five killings in Britain. Police figures are revealed.
[09:14.600 --> 09:20.400]  Nice little headline. U.S. housing collapse spreads overseas. This type of news I have
[09:20.400 --> 09:29.360]  there on the economy. That is out of the international Herald Tribune. But let me first just play
[09:29.360 --> 09:36.880]  a clip from CBS News so we can critique it and analyze it. Illegal immigrant births at
[09:36.880 --> 09:44.240]  your expense. They finally tell the truth and they say that it's an estimated 300,000
[09:44.240 --> 09:50.520]  children of illegal immigrants born in the United States every year according to the
[09:50.520 --> 09:57.160]  Pew Hispanic Center. They give instant citizenship because they are born on U.S. soil which makes
[09:57.160 --> 10:03.920]  it easier for their parents to become U.S. citizens. Now the average hospital birth,
[10:03.920 --> 10:12.760]  just the cesarean section, they say cost $4,500. Well being that my wife said to have three
[10:12.760 --> 10:19.160]  of them, I know that we paid about $8,000 a piece for them. And I went this morning and
[10:19.160 --> 10:24.360]  because I'd seen this story this weekend, I went this morning and looked up average
[10:24.360 --> 10:30.520]  cost, just type average cost of cesarean into Google. And I came up with about $7,000 with
[10:30.520 --> 10:37.360]  complications. It could be $15,000. So as bad as you think this article is, it's probably
[10:37.360 --> 10:42.920]  double the amount of money and of course that's not counting the three-day on average hospital
[10:42.920 --> 10:50.800]  stay at about $6,000 a day there with all the medical care and tests and drugs that
[10:50.800 --> 10:59.680]  are given. But let's just go with their numbers. $4,500, $6,000 a day, three days. So we're
[10:59.680 --> 11:16.320]  talking very easily here, $20,000 plus, $20,000 times $300,000. What's $20,000 times $300,000?
[11:16.320 --> 11:22.440]  And then you get all of the illegal aliens who get on welfare and it's admitted, if you
[11:22.440 --> 11:27.040]  pull up the statistics, that the average illegal alien is on two different welfare systems
[11:27.040 --> 11:34.320]  that with fake identities, which the government does not check, now remember that when I had
[11:34.320 --> 11:39.400]  my finger flopping around on a piece of skin basically severed, that I kept watching illegal
[11:39.400 --> 11:45.640]  aliens for an hour go ahead of me with stomach aches, sprained ankles, they go to the emergency
[11:45.640 --> 11:50.880]  room for basic medical care because emergency rooms nationwide have been told by the federal
[11:50.880 --> 11:55.920]  government and the bureaucracies and they all take orders from the feds, make no mistake.
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.080]  In fact, that was finally in mainstream news last week that these fusion centers, these
[12:00.080 --> 12:05.680]  emergency management centers, as I've told you since 1999 when we discovered it, openly
[12:05.680 --> 12:10.160]  are federally run and your cities are federally run and they have CIA in them. Just like Jesse
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.560]  Ventura, you know, first week as governor, there's 23 members of CIA waiting for him
[12:14.560 --> 12:19.160]  to tell him how things work. That's who runs this country. They run the narcotics, they
[12:19.160 --> 12:24.920]  run it all. They rule. And as soon as we realize who the rulers are, then they've lost their
[12:24.920 --> 12:30.840]  defense and they're wide open. But as long as they have their cloaking devices up, they
[12:30.840 --> 12:39.840]  can continue to operate without being touched. And as soon as their other cloak of, oh, they're
[12:39.840 --> 12:45.280]  patriotic, they do it for America is gone. They can easily be removed from the power
[12:45.280 --> 12:53.080]  structure and the people can be returned to that. But that's how they operate. But I'm
[12:53.080 --> 12:58.880]  digressing and please don't email me saying, Oh, I hate the illegal aliens. Oh, you just,
[12:58.880 --> 13:07.360]  you just hate them. Well, let me tell you something. If I go to Mexico with my wife,
[13:07.360 --> 13:14.480]  I fly down to Mexico City a week before she's due and I check into a hotel and then when
[13:14.480 --> 13:20.840]  she water breaks, I drive into a hospital. They are going to slap bills on me and police
[13:20.840 --> 13:26.000]  will come in and will arrest the man when he doesn't have payment and will stick you in
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.360]  a jail where you don't get fed unless someone brings you food. And then they take your driver's
[13:32.360 --> 13:38.200]  license and info your passport and they run it. And then they have government systems
[13:38.200 --> 13:43.720]  that then find out who your family is and they call them up and say, we don't just want
[13:43.720 --> 13:49.600]  the money for the baby. We want 50 grand or Alex Jones. It never gets out of jail. Now
[13:49.600 --> 13:55.280]  I live on the border. I've lived next to Mexico. I've had it happen to me. I've seen it happen
[13:55.280 --> 14:02.120]  to friends. The Mordito, it means little bite. If you're dumb enough to go out of Mexico,
[14:02.120 --> 14:05.280]  they just pull you over and they laugh and they say, Hey, gringo with, you know, big
[14:05.280 --> 14:10.160]  gold teeth. And then they pull you out and they waddle around. And it's the classic
[14:10.160 --> 14:17.600]  art type of a corrupt cop. And they tell you, give me money. There's never a newscast
[14:17.600 --> 14:23.400]  about it. Never a criticism of Mexico's hatred of Americans. And that means Mexican Americans
[14:23.400 --> 14:28.080]  too. Blacks, it doesn't matter, particularly blacks or Native Americans. Oh man, their
[14:28.080 --> 14:39.080]  newscasts call natives names. Very primitive society. So they're very racist. And in a
[14:39.080 --> 14:43.720]  lot of respects, it's healthy. They know their family stick together and they got a lot of
[14:43.720 --> 14:48.320]  things that are more positive than what, you know, this modern society falling apart. But
[14:48.320 --> 14:56.440]  I mean, this is just the facts. So I'm sitting there and, and my dad shows up as I call him
[14:56.440 --> 14:59.720]  on the cell phone once at the hospital, and he's pacing back and forth. He's saying,
[14:59.720 --> 15:03.880]  Be patient, your finger will be okay. Because you do need to have that reattached. It's
[15:03.880 --> 15:07.960]  numb today because I had to wait for the illegal aliens to go first because that's where they
[15:07.960 --> 15:11.800]  get their medical checkups, where they get their medicine. Instead of going to a clinic
[15:11.800 --> 15:16.600]  or a doctor and paying 100 bucks, they go get the free emergency room. That's that's
[15:16.600 --> 15:22.840]  admitted. And I finally just walked up and I said, Listen, I got to have this reattached.
[15:22.840 --> 15:29.560]  It's all, it's all wrapped up, soaking, you know, huge bandages, soaking with blood dripping.
[15:29.560 --> 15:32.560]  And I had what the ambulance would give me. And I said, Can I at least have something
[15:32.560 --> 15:37.160]  so I don't drip on the floor with the blood? And then I got a little irritable and I said,
[15:37.160 --> 15:41.520]  Listen, get me a doctor out here right now. And I kind of use the forceful tone with
[15:41.520 --> 15:45.160]  them. They bring out the doctor and they go, Listen, we need a nerve specialist. That's
[15:45.160 --> 15:52.960]  who we've called to reattach that. And I said, Listen, that's a bunch of bull.
[15:52.960 --> 15:57.360]  I said, You reattach my finger right now. I go, Do you know who I am?
[15:57.360 --> 16:02.320]  And the lady said, Yes, I know who you are. The doctor. And I said, I am going to sue
[16:02.320 --> 16:06.720]  you and I'm going to make a big deal out of this. You reattach it. I'm going to go totally
[16:06.720 --> 16:11.880]  nuts on the radio. You're going to have a major malpractice suit. These illegal aliens,
[16:11.880 --> 16:15.960]  I know you've been told to serve them first. And I'm not knocking them in their wranglers
[16:15.960 --> 16:21.560]  and their cowboy ads. I mean, these were illegal aliens right over the border in the last year.
[16:21.560 --> 16:27.040]  I mean, they you can see the phases of illegals as they get naturalized as they kind of start,
[16:27.040 --> 16:31.040]  you know, wearing baseball caps and rock and roll shirts. But when they're first there,
[16:31.040 --> 16:36.640]  it's patched shirts, patched ranch, ranch, you know, type outfits. And I just, you know,
[16:36.640 --> 16:40.880]  started literally setting my jaw and clenching my teeth real quietly and saying, I put my
[16:40.880 --> 16:46.280]  finger on. So they took me back there and tried to make me take a tetanus shot in our
[16:46.280 --> 16:51.480]  fuse and they had to scrub it all out and then they reattached it and everything. But
[16:51.480 --> 17:01.200]  the point here is that I have lived it and you're going to live it too. You're going
[17:01.200 --> 17:06.520]  to live it too when you need to go to the emergency room and you're going to experience
[17:06.520 --> 17:11.400]  it. So it isn't just a 300,000. And by the way, it's more than that. It isn't just the
[17:11.400 --> 17:16.200]  20 something thousand dollars pre legal. It's all the health care. It's everything. It's
[17:16.200 --> 17:21.840]  consulate matriculas with a consulate matricula. They will give to anyone with it for $24 at
[17:21.840 --> 17:29.200]  the facilities. All Austin's got one, Chicago, Dallas, El Paso, New York, every major city,
[17:29.200 --> 17:35.920]  San Diego, LA, Sacramento, New Orleans, you name it. They've all last time I checked what
[17:35.920 --> 17:45.440]  there's over 60 consulate offices and they've got other sub offices. They call missions
[17:45.440 --> 17:52.720]  and they go get a consulate matricula. And by the way, groups, the state of Colorado
[17:52.720 --> 17:57.600]  did a study and went into this themselves. The leader of the Senate, remember we interviewed
[17:57.600 --> 18:02.360]  him, he got four consulate matriculas in one day. And then with that, you get a social
[18:02.360 --> 18:07.160]  security card. With that, you get bank accounts. With that, you get it all. I've told the story
[18:07.160 --> 18:11.280]  if I'm in the bank, they want three forms of ID for me. They're asking me 20 questions
[18:11.280 --> 18:16.600]  about six years ago and I'm watching illegal aliens at their own desk with their own service
[18:16.600 --> 18:22.920]  with nothing being given bank accounts. All they want is that paycheck from a company.
[18:22.920 --> 18:27.680]  So it's all selectively enforced. You need to understand that. If you're a black man,
[18:27.680 --> 18:34.240]  a white man, a Hispanic lady, if you're American, if you're a Chinese American, someone who's
[18:34.240 --> 18:41.260]  American happens to be a Chinese descent, you're a citizen, you are back of the line.
[18:41.260 --> 18:46.880]  But if you are a Latin American precious, but it's not just them, they're the majority,
[18:46.880 --> 18:54.880]  80 plus percent. Chinese fly in by the thousands every day. We've covered these reports and
[18:54.880 --> 18:59.680]  they go check into the hotel, water breaks, they drive right over next door and they have
[18:59.680 --> 19:05.440]  free healthcare and that baby's made a citizen and now the Chinese man and woman, they get
[19:05.440 --> 19:11.640]  or it could be Vietnamese, they all do it. If they could be Russian, they go and they
[19:11.640 --> 19:18.040]  are immediately put on welfare, immediately everything's paid for. And then now they get
[19:18.040 --> 19:24.640]  jobs in the Chinese or Russian community. Though it is admitted, we can pull these
[19:24.640 --> 19:30.760]  articles up that if you are of European descent, they enforce on you a lot stronger and it's
[19:30.760 --> 19:35.720]  hard for South Africans to get into the U.S., it's hard for Australians, it's hard for Brits.
[19:35.720 --> 19:40.120]  Again, they want to make America a third world country. So I'm going to continue breaking
[19:40.120 --> 19:47.480]  this down and then take your phone calls on this and a lot of other subjects, but yeah.
[19:47.480 --> 19:55.360]  There's already a group of people that gets free healthcare in this country.
[19:55.360 --> 20:00.440]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments? Do you realize that with all presently accepted
[20:00.440 --> 20:06.240]  methods you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive
[20:06.240 --> 20:11.360]  the treatment? Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning and the poisoning of your
[20:11.360 --> 20:18.240]  entire system are totally unnecessary? But now, it's cancer's turn to die with
[20:18.240 --> 20:24.960]  laced med inks, patented methodology. Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation,
[20:24.960 --> 20:30.920]  we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at
[20:30.920 --> 20:41.280]  our physician's office. Laser technology at its best. For more information, call 702-953-0267

[20:54.600 --> 21:01.880]  It is a big idea, a new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by
[21:01.880 --> 21:07.480]  a powerful world government. It's known as the Bilderberg Group. Could their objective
[21:07.480 --> 21:13.600]  be world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the
[21:13.600 --> 21:19.360]  birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is
[21:19.360 --> 21:27.240]  at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown
[21:27.240 --> 21:32.160]  wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[21:32.160 --> 21:36.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world. Most people have no idea. They're
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.240]  not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their
[21:39.240 --> 21:46.120]  after music. Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right

[24:06.640 --> 24:12.480]  The laws in this country are for us. The saps, bread, and train to think we're free
[24:12.480 --> 24:19.480]  weren't really slaves. In fact, I've got my mainstream newspaper today reporting a national
[24:21.960 --> 24:28.160]  study that the IRS doesn't go after the big tax quote cheats. They don't go after the
[24:28.160 --> 24:33.080]  big corporations that pay very little taxes. They don't go after the billionaires. They
[24:33.080 --> 24:37.760]  don't go after the people who are worth $100 million. They go after who the general public
[24:37.760 --> 24:44.760]  thinks is rich, people making $100,000, $200,000, $300,000 a year. Yeah, once you get up above
[24:46.680 --> 24:52.800]  about what is it, $10 million, then your taxes drop. And they've got systems where you don't
[24:52.800 --> 24:59.800]  have to pay that much taxes, and the IRS just leaves you alone. So see, it's only the average
[25:00.040 --> 25:07.040]  sap that puts up with police checkpoints. And I had callers calling in yesterday about,
[25:07.040 --> 25:11.600]  yeah, how they live in Arizona where the cops come to your door and knock on it and say,
[25:11.600 --> 25:17.400]  mind if we come in and inspect your guns? I mean, this country's far gone, folks. I
[25:17.400 --> 25:21.680]  know I keep saying that, but we're not going to get it back until we come to grips with
[25:21.680 --> 25:28.680]  just how far we've fallen. All right, here's CBS News, the above the law, godlike, illegal
[25:28.680 --> 25:35.680]  aliens who get the royal red carpet, $20,000 plus a piece free. Notice this newscast only
[25:37.520 --> 25:44.200]  focuses and tells you about the cesarean costing $4,000, which is not the case. It costs close
[25:44.200 --> 25:50.280]  to $8,000. So as bad as you think this report is, it is a complete whitewash. Here it is.
[25:50.280 --> 25:56.240]  Just last year, lawmakers proposed more than 1,500 new immigration laws. It's a very difficult
[25:56.240 --> 26:01.380]  issue, especially when children are American citizens, but their parents are not. Our national
[26:01.380 --> 26:07.880]  correspondent Byron Pitts has one family story as we begin our special series, Immigration
[26:07.880 --> 26:14.880]  Nation. It's 5 a.m. This woman's nine months pregnant, an illegal immigrant fearful of
[26:15.480 --> 26:21.640]  deportation. She's dropped off at a South Texas hospital to undergo a C-section. It's
[26:21.640 --> 26:28.640]  a $4,700 procedure that didn't cost her a dime. A healthy eight and a half pound baby
[26:30.200 --> 26:37.200]  boy born in America, his Mexican mother gives him an American name, Elliott. He's one of
[26:37.720 --> 26:44.320]  an estimated 300,000 children of illegal immigrants born in the U.S. every year. They're given
[26:44.320 --> 26:49.160]  instant citizenship, which makes it easier for their parents to become U.S. citizens
[26:49.160 --> 26:55.720]  because those babies can eventually sponsor their parents when they turn 21. As for Elliott's
[26:55.720 --> 27:02.480]  mother, no longer as fearful of deportation, she tells us her name, Fabiola, and her story.
[27:02.480 --> 27:08.000]  So your son is an American citizen. What does that mean to you?
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.160]  I'm glad he was born here. That's why I came here, so my children, my husband, and I could
[27:13.160 --> 27:14.720]  have a better life.
[27:14.720 --> 27:20.040]  Back in December when she was six months pregnant, Fabiola, her husband, and their two daughters,
[27:20.040 --> 27:26.400]  ages four and 11, crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico into the U.S. Once across, they walked
[27:26.400 --> 27:33.400]  for two hours in search of a better life and free medical care for their unborn child.
[27:33.560 --> 27:40.560]  Help me understand. Do many women in Mexico make the choice to have their children in the
[27:40.920 --> 27:41.920]  United States?
[27:41.920 --> 27:48.920]  Yes, I know people who have done that. Things are better in the U.S. because they help children
[27:49.320 --> 27:50.600]  so much more.
[27:50.600 --> 27:56.000]  It's a better life. American taxpayers help pay for. Take health care, for example. An
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.760]  estimated $1.1 billion per year for all undocumented men, women, and children.
[28:02.760 --> 28:06.720]  Joe Riley is the CEO of the McAllen Texas Medical Center.
[28:06.720 --> 28:12.080]  Stop right there. Back it up a little bit. We did the math. On average, a birth in a
[28:12.080 --> 28:18.080]  hospital from a cesarean is more than $20,000, counting three days in the hospital, a cesarean.
[28:18.080 --> 28:24.280]  You see, they played a statistical trick there. They said $4,500. They underestimated it,
[28:24.280 --> 28:31.280]  and then they counted the 300,000 times that. But when you do it 300,000 times 20,000,
[28:31.280 --> 28:38.280]  it's $6 billion, not the $1 billion in change they were saying, and that's not counting
[28:39.560 --> 28:44.400]  the welfare, the jails, the prisons.
[28:44.400 --> 28:47.840]  So now that myth about, oh, you're going to be paying a lot for your cabbage and for
[28:47.840 --> 28:53.320]  your strawberries, the vast majority of the illegals don't pick the strawberries, ladies
[28:53.320 --> 28:58.840]  and gentlemen. And a small percentage of what you pay for strawberries is the actual cost
[28:58.840 --> 29:04.760]  of growing them. The rest of it's delivering them to market, the marketing of it, the taxes.
[29:04.760 --> 29:11.760]  We're going to come back and play the rest of it. But citizens don't get free healthcare.
[29:12.000 --> 29:19.000]  Now all over the country, they've passed laws where illegals get more tax incentives, and
[29:19.360 --> 29:25.880]  where illegals and legals get more tuition than citizens, free tuition in many state
[29:25.880 --> 29:32.280]  schools. It's an incentive to bring them here, to break the back of the wages and make us
[29:32.280 --> 29:38.160]  a third world nation. The middle class is always the enemy of the elite, and they've
[29:38.160 --> 29:44.440]  done a fabulous job. The country is probably irreversibly damaged.
[29:44.440 --> 29:51.440]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:45.920 --> 33:49.680]  I was already going to be doing it today, but they're doing some maintenance right now expanding
[33:49.680 --> 33:53.520]  the lines up at the network, so they don't even have 1-800s right now. Well, that's good
[33:53.520 --> 34:00.880]  because we have a phone number here, 512-646-5400. I'm told Malcolm and Austin and others disagree
[34:00.880 --> 34:06.600]  with me, so we'll be going to their calls coming up here in a few minutes. Before I
[34:06.600 --> 34:11.280]  go any further with the illegal aliens overrunning us by design and getting everything free and
[34:11.280 --> 34:16.920]  handed to them on a silver platter as first-class, god-like citizens. I want to tell you about
[34:16.920 --> 34:23.840]  American Drug War, The Last White Hope. This is five years in the making by my good friend
[34:23.840 --> 34:32.720]  Kevin Booth. I consulted on this film. It was the winner best documentary at four consecutive
[34:32.720 --> 34:39.040]  festivals, all four he entered it in. He won some major festivals there in Los Angeles
[34:39.040 --> 34:46.280]  and other places around the country and the world and in England. Tommy Chong, the actor-comedian,
[34:46.280 --> 34:51.440]  interviewed from prison about John Ashcroft's Operation Pipe Dreams. Freeway Ricky Ross,
[34:51.440 --> 34:56.400]  known as the Walmart of Crack, was getting his cocaine from the CIA. Judge James Gray,
[34:56.400 --> 35:03.240]  a federal judge who supports legalization and taxing marijuana. Sheriff Joe Arpaio forces
[35:03.240 --> 35:09.320]  nonviolent drug offenders to live outdoors in 130-degree heat working as slaves. And then
[35:09.320 --> 35:13.320]  the key to this DVD that's been aired more than 50 times now in the last month and a
[35:13.320 --> 35:17.720]  half on Showtime, I mean this is a hot movie, one of the top documentaries out right now,
[35:17.720 --> 35:27.760]  is that this film is longer, this version, and there's three hours of extras on the DVD.
[35:27.760 --> 35:32.780]  So you're getting five hours on American Drug War, The Last White Hope, and I'm glad people
[35:32.780 --> 35:36.520]  are ordering this. We're selling a lot of these because you need to show this to your
[35:36.520 --> 35:40.800]  friends, your family, police officers, and your family. People that don't understand
[35:40.800 --> 35:45.640]  the big picture need to see this film. On the front it says, we have met the enemy and
[35:45.640 --> 35:50.360]  it's our own government. Any movie that features interviews with comedian Tommy Chong, former
[35:50.360 --> 35:54.400]  drug czar and the founder of the Blood Street Gang, is doing something right. The Austin
[35:54.400 --> 36:01.440]  Chronicle had to say about it. And this has got Tommy Chong talking about smoking pot
[36:01.440 --> 36:06.200]  with Schwarzenegger. And then as soon as Chong got busted, Robin Schwarzenegger became governor.
[36:06.200 --> 36:12.000]  Schwarzenegger wouldn't talk to him anymore. I mean it just goes on and on and on. Alex
[36:12.000 --> 36:21.120]  Jones, that's on the back, Alex Jones and Fun with Barry the Drugs are. Robert Steele,
[36:21.120 --> 36:27.880]  CIA officer about government drug dealing, Mike Rupert's in this. Ladies and gentlemen,
[36:27.880 --> 36:32.680]  this film goes on and on and on and on and on. And Kevin was going to make a government
[36:32.680 --> 36:37.840]  drug dealing film. And that's what he asked me to consult with him. And then about two
[36:37.840 --> 36:46.800]  years into the process, it turned into a mini series that was going to air on British television.
[36:46.800 --> 36:51.120]  And then Kevin decided to not do that deal. He wanted to make it be about his dad dying
[36:51.120 --> 36:55.200]  who then died three years ago and about how alcohol killed him. You know, then he went
[36:55.200 --> 37:01.160]  that angle of my gosh, 300 and some thousand people die of alcohol and nicotine each year.
[37:01.160 --> 37:06.560]  That's admitted and no one dies of marijuana. Well, why is this happening? And then he went
[37:06.560 --> 37:11.200]  that direction and then so really he was making like four or five films. It was his personal
[37:11.200 --> 37:17.000]  journey. His brother died from prescription drugs. His mother died from alcoholism. And
[37:17.000 --> 37:24.880]  so, uh, well, I'm already digressing. The point is you need American drug war 2495 everywhere
[37:24.880 --> 37:29.920]  else is 2995 everywhere else. It's only on Kevin's website. This thing doesn't hit stores
[37:29.920 --> 37:39.400]  till late May. We have it here first 2495 five hours. American drug war info wars dot

[37:55.000 --> 38:01.360]  sweet 100 Austin, Texas, seven, eight, seven, zero, four. We're also carrying a new video.
[38:01.360 --> 38:05.080]  We've got it, but it didn't even up on the shopping cart yet. But if you want to write
[38:05.080 --> 38:10.920]  to us, it'll be up the next week. If you want to write to us, you can get American drug
[38:10.920 --> 38:19.080]  war. It is on the shopping cart, by the way, but we just got in Washington. You're fired
[38:19.080 --> 38:23.520]  by just an amazing filmmaker, William Lewis. And that is available if you want to write
[38:23.520 --> 38:35.720]  to us at 3001 South Lamar, sweet 100 Austin, Texas, seven, eight, seven, zero, four. And
[38:35.720 --> 38:39.120]  there's a lot of other books and videos we're about to add to the cart. It'll be up there
[38:39.120 --> 38:41.720]  in the next day or two, but I'm just saying if you want it now, you can go ahead and write
[38:41.720 --> 38:45.120]  to us to get washed in your fire. Another amazing film. All right, I'm going to stop
[38:45.120 --> 38:49.640]  by laboring this and go to some of your calls after I finish up with the illegal aliens
[38:49.640 --> 38:55.920]  who are above the law. But everybody's above the law, but Americans, we are some of the
[38:55.920 --> 39:00.800]  most enslaved, most taxed, most surveilled, but we're arrogant idiots who think, myself
[39:00.800 --> 39:10.320]  included, who think, well, I thought that we were free. Now, I was just thinking, I mean,
[39:10.320 --> 39:14.520]  1999, Richard Grasso, head of the New York Stock Exchange, in front of AP and Reuters
[39:14.520 --> 39:19.800]  and scores of newspapers has a press conference with the head of the FARC, communist guerrillas,
[39:19.800 --> 39:25.320]  who control about half the cocaine production in Columbia and two other surrounding nations.
[39:25.320 --> 39:31.640]  We've got little pieces of those countries. And it was in the paper that, well, it's legal
[39:31.640 --> 39:37.920]  for foreign drug cartels to invest in the stock market. And Richard Grasso told him,
[39:37.920 --> 39:41.080]  you will invest with us or we're going to invade you. And they said, no. And one year
[39:41.080 --> 39:45.320]  later, they invaded. And seven years later, they finally killed the head of the FARC
[39:45.320 --> 39:50.640]  two months ago. They finally, the mafia, the mafia that runs our country, the mafia openly
[39:50.640 --> 40:06.640]  deals drugs. Our government openly launders drug money, openly. I'll never forget, I talked
[40:06.640 --> 40:11.240]  about this a few months ago, two months ago when they killed the head of the FARC drug
[40:11.240 --> 40:16.440]  dealing just continues, like sharks taste somebody replaces him. And I really posted
[40:16.440 --> 40:24.040]  on prisonplanet.com. No, no, it was info wars.com curtain memo posted, I sent him like five
[40:24.040 --> 40:29.000]  stories. One was AP, one was Reuters. And then one of them was narco news and another
[40:29.000 --> 40:38.680]  was some Colombian newspaper. No, it was Venezuela newspaper from like seven years ago. And
[40:38.680 --> 40:44.880]  all this happened. And in the comments, the sent com guys in there, they didn't counter
[40:44.880 --> 40:48.680]  Reuters or the photo of Richard Grasso hugging the head of the FARC and saying, invest your
[40:48.680 --> 40:53.240]  drugs with us. They just said, Oh, look at this leftist publication you you you put a
[40:53.240 --> 41:02.320]  link to. Oh, they're commies. When Grasso's publicly hugging him publicly saying it,
[41:02.320 --> 41:13.120]  it doesn't matter. You just deny it. You're shameful creatures. So see, everybody's above
[41:13.120 --> 41:21.360]  the law, but us, everybody gets a free pass and get out of jail card by American citizens.
[41:21.360 --> 41:25.440]  We've interviewed sheriffs. It's been in the news where they'll arrest a van full of 1520
[41:25.440 --> 41:30.240]  legal stacked on top of each other driving through Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina,
[41:30.240 --> 41:36.600]  upstate New York. I mean, I've seen Texas. I need to have a bunch of those sheriffs
[41:36.600 --> 41:42.040]  back on and they'll arrest them and then they'll call the INS and now ice and they'll
[41:42.040 --> 41:47.880]  say, let them go. We don't we don't deport. They can have marijuana. They can have forties
[41:47.880 --> 41:55.800]  of beer cases of beer everywhere. It's selectively enforced. They let them go. But let me tell
[41:55.800 --> 42:02.800]  you, you're a Hispanic American, like state Senator barrientos and you've had, you know,
[42:02.800 --> 42:08.040]  well, he had like a blood alcohol level of like 1.2 or something or 0.1 or whatever it
[42:08.040 --> 42:13.480]  is, very low. But it was like three beers. He goes to jail and I'm not saying he should
[42:13.480 --> 42:17.560]  get away with it. The point is you're a black guy, you're a white guy, you're a Mexican
[42:17.560 --> 42:21.280]  American, you know, they pull you over, you speak good English. Boom, baby, you're going
[42:21.280 --> 42:26.960]  to jail. You got money. We're going to suck some money off of you. But you're an illegal
[42:26.960 --> 42:31.760]  alien and I've talked to Austin cops. I pulled up at the office one night and there were
[42:31.760 --> 42:37.080]  two cop cars and one of my was not my employee. One of my contractors was here doing some
[42:37.080 --> 42:41.160]  internet work and he's in handcuffs and I walk up and the cops start freaking out back up.
[42:41.160 --> 42:45.680]  What do you think? Oh, it's Alex Jones. Hey, what's going on, Alex? The, you know, the
[42:45.680 --> 42:50.520]  highest ranking guy was a big black guy was a white lady. And no, it was a Hispanic lady
[42:50.520 --> 42:57.160]  and a white guy. And she was the one that first pulled in because he pulled into the
[42:57.160 --> 43:01.400]  office and she thought that he was evading her. It was suspicious that he turned in.
[43:01.400 --> 43:12.680]  Now there you turn into your office and he had an expired driver's license. And I
[43:12.680 --> 43:22.000]  walk up and black guy starts going, Hey, I'm retired in six months. I don't care. Hey,
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.480]  Alex, should I hear about my new rock band? I've just played up in New York, blah, blah,
[43:25.480 --> 43:28.920]  blah. Have you heard of them? And I'm going, Hey, how are you doing? He goes, Yeah, I've
[43:28.920 --> 43:32.800]  been watching you for years. And the other guy, the other white guy was, you know, somewhat
[43:32.800 --> 43:37.120]  nice. He was stuttering though when he talked to me. And here's the Hispanic woman taking
[43:37.120 --> 43:44.920]  the IT guy to jail. And I leave it to the car and I say, Hey, if he was any legal alien,
[43:44.920 --> 43:48.840]  you'd let him go and she got real mad and drove out. And the other two guys start laughing.
[43:48.840 --> 43:52.800]  They go, Yeah, they encourage us not to arrest the illegals because there's nothing they
[43:52.800 --> 43:57.720]  do anyways. The judge just lets them go or gives them a $50 fine. But, but we're, we
[43:57.720 --> 44:02.000]  get in trouble if we pull over a citizen and they don't. And I just said, that doesn't
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.880]  make you mad. And he goes, Yeah, it makes us mad. And both of them are telling me that
[44:04.880 --> 44:13.440]  they just go, Hey, see you later, man. Have a good one. Oh, yeah, I forgot the other part.
[44:13.440 --> 44:17.840]  My IT guy had gotten the door and it was at night. He'd opened up. So since he'd gotten
[44:17.840 --> 44:23.600]  the door open, they went ahead and walk through my office. I forgot that part. That's right.
[44:23.600 --> 44:29.080]  When I pull up, some of them are walking out of the front door of the office. And they
[44:29.080 --> 44:36.400]  said, Well, what I made a joke about criminal activity and I just, you know, I tried to
[44:36.400 --> 44:42.360]  laugh it off. I just can't handle it anymore. Folks, I'm total scum. I'm a scum filth slave.
[44:42.360 --> 44:48.320]  I'm just going to admit it. I am a pathetic scum piece of trash. All of us are. We are
[44:48.320 --> 44:56.800]  pathetic slave worms. And until we admit that we are worms who are selectively enforced
[44:56.800 --> 45:03.160]  on and who live on the lowest room of society, things are only going to get worse. I had
[45:03.160 --> 45:07.400]  a newscast. I didn't even play last week. It's not like I'm trying to bash the illegals
[45:07.400 --> 45:13.680]  where this white girl for history class was told to write an essay and read it. You know,
[45:13.680 --> 45:17.040]  everybody had to write an essay and said what they thought about illegal immigration. And
[45:17.040 --> 45:20.480]  so she came to school and she was supposed to do an essay and have a, and have a visual
[45:20.480 --> 45:26.760]  aid. And she had a sign saying illegal immigration is hurting America. And so 20 kids beat her
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.800]  up, bruises, scratch, little cuts all over. And the school just said, we're not going
[45:31.800 --> 45:35.440]  to do anything. Yes, they're allowed to beat her up basically. And they just said, that's
[45:35.440 --> 45:45.160]  how it is because only whites can commit racial crimes. Only whites are bad. Only whites
[45:45.160 --> 45:54.760]  can do wrong. Only whites are evil. Only. And I remember the illegal aliens beating
[45:54.760 --> 45:58.800]  people up the last three years at these rallies they have all over the country, pulling down
[45:58.800 --> 46:03.120]  American flags. I got video of them beating old women in the head with two by fours, blood
[46:03.120 --> 46:10.080]  squirting out. The police come and arrest the blacks and whites in Hispanics who are
[46:10.080 --> 46:17.840]  counter demonstrating because the establishment wants the illegal aliens. They get free healthcare.
[46:17.840 --> 46:24.680]  They get free welfare. They get everything. You get nothing slaves. Let's finish up with
[46:24.680 --> 46:33.520]  that newscast from where we're at the piece about the billions of dollars. Here it is.
[46:33.520 --> 46:40.240]  Public health care, for example, an estimated $1.1 billion per year for all undocumented
[46:40.240 --> 46:45.440]  men, women and children. Joe Riley is the CEO of the account. I mean, that is such
[46:45.440 --> 46:52.880]  a lie. $22,000. We did the math off public numbers. It's $22,000, some cases even more
[46:52.880 --> 46:59.800]  depending on the state, to have a cesarean. I know I've had to pay for three of them.
[46:59.800 --> 47:04.440]  The average three-day stay, a lot of you are nodding your heads. Yeah, you've had babies.
[47:04.440 --> 47:12.680]  You know that there's complications in a cesarean. It can even be even higher. They say 300,000
[47:12.680 --> 47:17.360]  women are having births. The average birth is about 10 grand. It's about 20 grand with
[47:17.360 --> 47:22.680]  a cesarean. So if you average it together, it's way more than a billion. It could be
[47:22.680 --> 47:27.200]  6 billion. It could be 4 billion. We don't know the exact number. But now they're saying
[47:27.200 --> 47:39.440]  all health care-free legals is $1.1 billion. When, if you paid for 300,000 women to have
[47:39.440 --> 47:45.680]  babies at 10 grand apiece without cesarean, some of them are. What they're saying, about
[47:45.680 --> 47:52.840]  45% of the births in this country are now cesarean. They like to quicken the process.
[47:52.840 --> 47:57.360]  And the point is, you're hearing a lot lower numbers here. We know it's many times higher
[47:57.360 --> 48:03.600]  than this. I mean, just the tax cost in California, it's been in the news. I've seen the number
[48:03.600 --> 48:09.400]  of 5 billion for illegal alien health care in a single year. Here it is.
[48:09.400 --> 48:15.640]  And children. Joe Riley is the CEO of the McAllen Texas Medical Center near the Texas-Mexico
[48:15.640 --> 48:22.680]  border. 40% of the children born here, nearly 2,400 last year, were the babies of illegal
[48:22.680 --> 48:26.320]  immigrants. Riley has seen and heard it all.
[48:26.320 --> 48:31.600]  Mother's about to give birth that walk up to the hospitals still wet from swimming across
[48:31.600 --> 48:37.600]  the river and in actual labor. But here to have a child in the U.S.
[48:37.600 --> 48:42.080]  McAllen, which is part of a large hospital system, like all hospitals, is mandated by
[48:42.080 --> 48:47.360]  law to treat all emergency room patients, not verify citizenship.
[48:47.360 --> 48:54.000]  We have uncompleted care of over $200 million last year. $200 million, yes.
[48:54.000 --> 49:02.400]  Let's stop. That proves their lie. 200 million in one small Texas town, McAllen's little.
[49:02.400 --> 49:09.640]  200 million in one town, and they're telling you it's only 1.1 billion. I mean, you see,
[49:09.640 --> 49:14.280]  how dumb do they think you are? So you think this is a piece being honest? No, it's a complete
[49:14.280 --> 49:15.280]  lie. Go ahead.
[49:15.280 --> 49:18.040]  You won't ever see again. Yes.
[49:18.040 --> 49:21.840]  It's not fair to the taxpayers. We have to foot the bill.
[49:21.840 --> 49:25.800]  This Congress has all but given up on comprehensive immigration reform.
[49:25.800 --> 49:30.920]  Stop right there. See their spin? Their spin is, oh, look, the illegals are getting all
[49:30.920 --> 49:39.600]  this free healthcare. The answer is legalize all of them and totally get rid of the border.
[49:39.600 --> 49:44.480]  I mean, that's like if you have a sprain ankle having both your legs cut off, your throat
[49:44.480 --> 49:50.440]  slit and 14 rounds popped into your head. But that's the logic. And there's yuppies and
[49:50.440 --> 49:55.960]  mindless fluoride drinkers out there watching this and they think, oh, man, I'm mad about
[49:55.960 --> 50:03.360]  this. I want reform. That's why it just hits over. Keep playing it. Just play it out to
[50:03.360 --> 50:04.600]  break.
[50:04.600 --> 50:10.280]  But lawmakers like Lamar Smith of Texas want to challenge the 14th Amendment, which guarantees
[50:10.280 --> 50:16.600]  U.S. citizenship to any child born in America. It seems fundamentally wrong that we ought
[50:16.600 --> 50:22.640]  to give the greatest honor our country can bestow citizenship to a child whose only connection
[50:22.640 --> 50:28.080]  to this country is that his or her mother came across the border illegally.
[50:28.080 --> 50:34.640]  Many Americans who struggle to take care of their own families think it is unfair that
[50:34.640 --> 50:39.080]  they should take care of a family and they're not U.S. citizens.
[50:39.080 --> 50:42.920]  I don't really understand the resentment.
[50:42.920 --> 50:47.440]  Stay there. Stay there. Hey, lady, if I try to come down to Mexico and have a kid, your
[50:47.440 --> 50:50.960]  cops will take me outside and beat me half to death and laugh at me while they scream
[50:50.960 --> 50:54.720]  gringo. So you shut up.
[50:54.720 --> 50:59.920]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror. Loose Change Final Cut, in-game blueprint
[50:59.920 --> 51:04.920]  for global enslavement. The true story of the Bilderberg group, the late-grade USA, America

[53:13.360 --> 53:17.600]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high speed internet connection gain instant
[53:17.600 --> 53:21.800]  access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe. And here's
[53:21.800 --> 53:27.120]  the best part, it's 100% legal. And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries

[54:13.760 --> 54:19.040]  Just go back to the ladies saying, I don't understand why they don't want to pay for
[54:19.040 --> 54:23.920]  my free health care. I'm just totally amazed that I...
[54:23.920 --> 54:28.680]  By the way, US newspapers like this. They like the federal funds. They put ads. They've
[54:28.680 --> 54:34.600]  been caught putting ads in Mexican newspapers to come up and have the babies. And I mean,
[54:34.600 --> 54:39.320]  it's a big joke. And then the whole family gets to move down here. I'll continue with
[54:39.320 --> 54:42.320]  it and then I'm going to go to Malcolm and others that are holding.
[54:42.320 --> 54:46.080]  It's not fair to the taxpayers. We have to foot the bill.
[54:46.080 --> 54:51.400]  This Congress has all but given up on comprehensive immigration reform. But lawmakers like Lamar
[54:51.400 --> 54:56.920]  Smith of Texas want to challenge the 14th Amendment, which guarantees US citizenship
[54:56.920 --> 54:59.720]  to any child born in America.
[54:59.720 --> 55:04.360]  It seems fundamentally wrong that we ought to give the greatest honor our country can
[55:04.360 --> 55:11.440]  bestow citizenship to a child whose only connection to this country is that his or her mother
[55:11.440 --> 55:13.720]  came across the border illegally.
[55:13.720 --> 55:20.240]  Many Americans who struggle to take care of their own families think it is unfair that
[55:20.240 --> 55:26.680]  they should take care of a family and they're not US citizens.
[55:26.680 --> 55:30.920]  I don't really understand the resentment, but I know that God will find a way to help
[55:30.920 --> 55:32.240]  them too.
[55:32.240 --> 55:37.800]  That's what Fabiola's doing for young Elliot, relying on her faith, her family, and the
[55:37.800 --> 55:42.560]  US government. Byron Pitts, CBS News, McAllen, Texas.
[55:42.560 --> 55:48.800]  There isn't a US government. Let's get that clear. There's private banking families that
[55:48.800 --> 55:53.560]  own our media, that own our military, and that poison the water and carry out eugenics
[55:53.560 --> 55:57.280]  operations against us.
[55:57.280 --> 56:02.960]  And they have always used divide and conquer, and they have brought in gigantic third world
[56:02.960 --> 56:11.600]  populations to blow out the economy, blow out the wages, break down the society.
[56:11.600 --> 56:14.800]  And that's what's happened, period.
[56:14.800 --> 56:20.320]  Now, I don't know what we're going to do as a society. I don't know how we're going to
[56:20.320 --> 56:22.000]  turn this around.
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.000]  Our government has paid for comic books and everything else in Mexico for 50 years, just
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.080]  like they radicalized the Muslims, and that's a historical fact, to quote counterbalance
[56:31.080 --> 56:37.240]  communism. They have radicalized the Mexicans in Mexico to where they hate this country.
[56:37.240 --> 56:42.880]  It is a national pastime. When this country was attacked on 9-11, L.A. Times and others
[56:42.880 --> 56:49.040]  reported that the week after, US team was down in Mexico playing them, and they were
[56:49.040 --> 56:53.800]  chanting Bin Laden, Bin Laden, Bin Laden Hurrah.
[56:53.800 --> 56:59.840]  Now, they thought Bin Laden attacked us. See, they don't understand the sophisticated game.
[56:59.840 --> 57:01.960]  US citizens don't either.
[57:01.960 --> 57:07.600]  This is a group that cheers al-Qaeda attacking us. Now, and it's perfect. They speak another
[57:07.600 --> 57:11.760]  language. The dumb yuppies don't know. The dumb yuppies can't even speak English. All
[57:11.760 --> 57:18.760]  they can do is act cool and strut around bulging their muscles out.
[57:18.760 --> 57:25.200]  And that's why it's all over, folks. The country is completely falling apart. The country is,
[57:25.200 --> 57:31.280]  and I mean, we have to recognize how bad it is. We're hearing hospitals are going bankrupt.
[57:31.280 --> 57:36.200]  States are going bankrupt. I mean, all the feds are always adding new taxes, new layers
[57:36.200 --> 57:41.380]  of bureaucracy, more cops outriding tickets. And I mean, it makes me mad when cops have
[57:41.380 --> 57:46.400]  a checkpoint and I drive up to it, and they're checking for IDs and insurance, and I see
[57:46.400 --> 57:50.840]  them waving illegals through. I mean, I get mad. I'm like, what's your problem, man? You
[57:50.840 --> 57:57.720]  let illegals go and they'll just be like, well, don't ask questions. I am asking questions.
[57:57.720 --> 58:05.400]  I have had enough. I don't get my bill of rights. I don't get my Constitution. I don't
[58:05.400 --> 58:13.200]  get anything. And the illegal aliens, they get everything. They get everything, and
[58:13.200 --> 58:18.800]  my family gets nothing. And then I get to be hated while I pay for their welfare and
[58:18.800 --> 58:22.960]  pay for their kids and pay for everything else. I get to go down to Mexico and get treated
[58:22.960 --> 58:31.720]  like dirt. I'm boycotting Mexico. I'm boycotting the whole thing. Boycotting Mexico.

[58:44.800 --> 58:52.720]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[58:52.720 --> 58:59.600]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[58:59.600 --> 59:05.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world
[59:05.000 --> 59:13.840]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[59:13.840 --> 59:19.560]  in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret
[59:19.560 --> 59:24.080]  that drives the entire new world order agenda. Builder Bird is making great progress for
[59:24.080 --> 59:27.160]  the world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all
[59:27.160 --> 59:31.200]  the money they need. They're after power. That's their after these years. Order in-game

[59:37.840 --> 59:47.160]  In-game, on prep for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[59:47.160 --> 59:59.480]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Government cover-ups. You
[59:59.480 --> 1:00:07.920]  want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live
[1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:14.400]  from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Well, I've been ranting about the fact that there's
[1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:25.040]  a red carpet for the illegal aliens from the entire planet. I mean, haven't the illegal
[1:00:25.040 --> 1:00:29.520]  aliens ever wondered why the government gives them a red carpet to put up billboards saying
[1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:35.560]  they're taking over the U.S. and free healthcare, free welfare, everything else? It's to help
[1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:40.280]  bring down the country. We've got Kurt Nemo joining us to talk about the war. They're
[1:00:40.280 --> 1:00:45.320]  beating the drums to go into Iran, claiming now that Iran's al-Qaeda, and now saying that
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:50.400]  they're going to shift the worldwide war on terror from al-Qaeda to Iran. Now, they already
[1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:54.400]  did that once. They shifted it and said, we're no longer worried about al-Qaeda. We're catching
[1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:58.440]  them. And now it's Saddam. And then after they were done with him, they said, now it's
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:03.800]  back to al-Qaeda, and now it's to Iran. So we'll be talking about that a lot more. And
[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:09.400]  George Humphrey joins us, too, in studio later. But right now, let's go to some of your calls.
[1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:16.280]  We're taking calls on my local in-studio line today, 512-646-5400. Let's talk to Malcolm
[1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:23.360]  in Austin, Texas, who disagrees. Thanks for holding Malcolm. Go ahead, Malcolm. You're
[1:01:23.360 --> 1:01:28.360]  on the air. Am I on now? Yes, you are. Okay. Hi. I love your show. I've tried to turn
[1:01:28.360 --> 1:01:32.320]  you on to some people. There are actually some listeners out there who claim that you're
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:38.600]  with Mossad. And my message to them goes, yeah, no. This is my message to these people
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:43.480]  if they say that you stutter when you talk about Israel. That's their claim. But my message
[1:01:43.480 --> 1:01:47.680]  is this, if you believe that Alex Jones is with Mossad, well, the Pope and the Dalai Lama
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:51.200]  just say a whole bunch of hostess Twinkies are now going to San Francisco to kill the
[1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:59.160]  mayor. So there. Anyway, I have two complaints and two questions for you. My first complaint
[1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:05.920]  regards you're saying that the central bankers are dumping the dollar to get the dollar down.
[1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:08.960]  And then, like a few minutes later, you're saying that the central bankers are dumping
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:13.480]  gold to send the price of gold down. Alex, you can't do both simultaneously because
[1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:21.240]  the dollar and the gold are opposed to each other price wise. Well, I've had on the gata
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:27.720]  group who's been in federal international court suing the central banks and we've had
[1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:33.280]  Nobel Prize winners on. We've had the head of the New York School of Economics on. We've
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:40.120]  had all these top economists on and whoever said that the laws of this rigged stock market
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:45.640]  and somewhat rigged and manipulated metals market and commodities, whoever said that
[1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:50.840]  you couldn't have that going on. The central banks, the IMF said last week they were going
[1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:57.520]  to dump more gold on the market to drive down gold. Yeah, but that would increase the value
[1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:01.880]  of the dollar if you do that. Okay. Well, you're not, you're not listening to what I'm
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:06.160]  saying. Okay. Look, fine. Believe what you want. Fine. I'm wrong. How's that sound?
[1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:11.640]  Okay. Well, Alex, Alex, before also you were talking about silver. Ted Butler and Jim
[1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:17.320]  Rogers did acknowledge that there is a huge amount of silver in China. They're just not
[1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:22.280]  selling it. So even though the price of silver, I've invested in metals and I've done very
[1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:27.480]  well. But the thing about it is there is a huge supply of silver in China. They just
[1:03:27.480 --> 1:03:33.680]  haven't dumped it yet. And Jim Rogers acknowledged that just to let you know. So you're saying
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:38.540]  silver is going to go down? I don't know. But what I'm worried about is if, when the
[1:03:38.540 --> 1:03:43.760]  AWACS plane was conveniently dropped off to China years ago with all that radar supply.
[1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:49.240]  And they didn't follow their standard operating procedure to trigger the acid baths that destroyed
[1:03:49.240 --> 1:03:55.720]  them, the codes. Right. Well, the price of silver magically went down. And I sort of,
[1:03:55.720 --> 1:04:00.680]  I mean, this is, there's some people out there in the metals markets who I've talked with.
[1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:05.560]  They think that there may be some kind of deal going on between the United States and
[1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:11.160]  China with, not just with them financing our debt by buying our bonds and stuff, but also
[1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:15.520]  with selling silver to keep the price low because silver is one of the oldest forms
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:20.640]  of money. And it's, some people also argue that it's sort of used as a choke collar
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:24.760]  to keep the price of gold down. Well, of course it is. Listen, I appreciate your call.
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:30.400]  Okay. Yeah. I'm not going to argue with people that the US government has a policy of a week
[1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:39.840]  dollar. They have stated that. And to say that I'm going to come back and break it down.
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:43.440]  But that's what all the experts have also said on this show. We'll be right back. Stay
[1:04:43.440 --> 1:05:09.800]  with us.
[1:05:09.800 --> 1:05:35.160]  We'll see you in the next one.
[1:05:35.160 --> 1:06:00.480]  We'll see you in the next one.
[1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:29.040]  We'll see you in the next one.
[1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:54.680]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that
[1:06:54.680 --> 1:07:20.400]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:48.400]  water.
[1:07:53.400 --> 1:08:01.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Yeah, I want to comment on some of the things that
[1:08:01.760 --> 1:08:11.240]  the caller from Austin, Texas was discussing. He was saying, which way is it? Do the people
[1:08:11.240 --> 1:08:19.920]  running the US financial system want a week dollar or a strong dollar? Well, they have
[1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:26.000]  been printing a lot of the dollars. They've been issuing a lot of liquidity and credit.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:36.800]  They have been doing things that have been driving down the value of the dollar. But
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:44.840]  then as gold rises up, I mean, this is subtle nuances here. They've got gold suppressed
[1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:56.240]  it. It's up today at 9,000 at 930 something. But they don't want it to be at parity to
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:09:05.000]  1980s highs of $2,300 plus. And so even though we see gold way up, it is still suppressed
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:12.240]  and the IMF and others have been caught selling gold to other member central banks at below
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:17.720]  cost many times. And so when a bunch of gold and billions of dollars of gold gets sold
[1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:27.960]  at below price, that drives down the price. That's the whole point. They are manipulating
[1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:33.360]  the market, just like they manipulate the CPI, just like they put out fake numbers
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:45.220]  on unemployment. When someone goes off of the unemployment rolls, they then count them
[1:09:45.220 --> 1:09:50.960]  as employed. So we're here having debates about the financial system going off of what
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:10:01.360]  they say. That's a little naive. But instead of debating all of this, gold was $260 an
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:10.640]  ounce five years ago and it's now $930 plus an ounce. Silver was $5 an ounce and now it's
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:21.360]  $19 an ounce. The dollar was the most powerful currency in the world. And it's now behind
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:30.120]  every major industrialized nation and dropping. So I don't even know what the debate is about.
[1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:39.560]  We know the policies of devaluing the dollar are being carried out. We know that the IMF
[1:10:39.560 --> 1:10:42.800]  and World Bank have come out and said they believe the dollar is going to go down substantially
[1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:50.120]  more in the next year. See, what happens is the Federal Reserve wants to keep inflation
[1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:55.760]  at least on the surface down domestically. And in congressional testimony, Bernanke says,
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:11:00.320]  well, inflation isn't too high domestically, which it really is. He lies and says it's
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:05.880]  at 6%. Last year he said it was at 2% when it's really at about 15 or higher. And so
[1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:14.240]  globally out in the world, gold really hasn't gone up that much. It's gone up here domestically.
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:19.600]  And so when they try to hammer gold down, they're doing that because it does tend to
[1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:26.200]  destroy confidence in not just the dollar, but other currencies. And so they don't want
[1:11:26.200 --> 1:11:32.160]  it to be an investment for everybody because there's so many futures contracts on it. There's
[1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:39.000]  so much leveraged investment involved in it. And it gets into a lot of other delicate complexities.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:48.680]  But next time we've got Bob Chapman, I'll have him explain it to you, caller. As for
[1:11:48.680 --> 1:11:55.720]  me having to spend time responding to, am I a Scientologist? Am I a Massad agent? Am
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:12:05.360]  I a Catholic agent? I stammer quite a bit when I get excited and I start talking about
[1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:10.320]  things. So for people to say, oh, listen to how Alex stammered right there, I stammer
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:17.960]  constantly when I get excited and got 10 points I want to make it. It's very frustrating.
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:24.000]  And I also get angry, not angry about myself individually. I enjoy being attacked. I like
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:30.880]  it. I like fighting with people. I like the fact at a sick level, there's lots of jealous
[1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:35.320]  do nothings who are mad at the fact that I work a lot more hours than they do and I'm
[1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:40.800]  a lot smarter than they are. And that, you know, when somebody hates me, I'll hate them
[1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:45.120]  right back. But at an intellectual level, I get very upset. You know, we all have mixed
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:51.280]  feelings about things because there is sodium fluoride in the water. It is retarding the
[1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:56.000]  average IQ levels of someone who drinks it. This is government studies by about 20 points
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:03.120]  on average. And we've posted those reports and played those congressional testimonies
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:14.280]  and we've done it all here. They are chem trailing us. They are engaging in mass eugenics.
[1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:18.080]  They are getting rid of our borders. The illegal aliens are getting free healthcare and free
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:24.680]  welfare as a supplement, as an incentive to come here and even greater numbers. But the
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:30.680]  government is building FEMA camps and there are groups that fight over whether it should
[1:13:30.680 --> 1:13:34.640]  all be about Catholics or all about Protestants and they all fight with each other. And that's
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:38.480]  all these groups do. They'll say New World Order in their writings, but that's about
[1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:43.680]  it. There's no political activism. There's no warning the general public. I mean, can
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:48.560]  you imagine somebody driving along, listening to this show for the first time in Austin,
[1:13:48.560 --> 1:13:57.840]  Texas on 1330 a.m. or 590 a.m. or 90.1 or 96.3 or somebody listening to the 2 a.m. stations
[1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:02.240]  and FM station we got in upstate New York or the two stations we've got in Ohio or three
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:07.480]  stations we've got in Illinois or a station in Florida or two stations in California and
[1:14:07.480 --> 1:14:15.080]  Needles and also one that goes into San Diego or all the other affiliates in Montana, Wyoming,
[1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:25.320]  Idaho. I mean, they're driving along in their cars and they're hearing people call up and
[1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:33.560]  say, I don't think you're an agent. Well, A, I'm not an agent, but B, it doesn't matter.
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:39.720]  What are you going to do about the things I talk about?
[1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:43.720]  Agents don't get on air and tell you you have personal power. Agents don't get on air and
[1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:47.640]  say we have a chance to defeat the New World Order. Agents don't get on air and say you're
[1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:53.440]  all leaders, get involved, pick an issue, any issue. Agents get on air and say we all
[1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:58.320]  need to unify. We all need to go follow this group. We all need to have this or that. We
[1:14:58.320 --> 1:15:04.920]  all need to, you know, that's what agents or control freaks always do. Agents don't say
[1:15:04.920 --> 1:15:13.400]  start your own group, you know, be nonviolent. I mean, look at the fruits literally. I had
[1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:19.400]  with this radio show because of my listeners taking action. Everybody I talked to in the
[1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:24.280]  movement says, you know, it's unanimous. Alex Jones has woken up more people than anybody
[1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:29.320]  else. Alex Jones has brought in the mighty harvest. Alex Jones has the fruit on the
[1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:35.120]  tree. Now, sometimes I think maybe the fruit isn't good because everybody that calls me
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:41.080]  up or sends me a letter or an email says you woke me up, but now I know you're evil. See,
[1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:44.840]  they don't have any logic there. And so I start thinking, man, maybe I wake everybody
[1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:50.560]  up and then I just hand them over to all the bottom feeding crazies who are all in factionalized
[1:15:50.560 --> 1:15:55.520]  infighting because that's how society works. Let me, let me give all the people out there
[1:15:55.520 --> 1:15:59.160]  that are mad that you're not the big leader and that you're mad that you don't have the
[1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:05.760]  millions of listeners and all of this. Let me give you a few tips. When you make money
[1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:10.040]  off a book you sell or something, don't take a vacation, hire people, write a better book,
[1:16:10.040 --> 1:16:22.080]  make a better video. Or let me give you a tip. Spend time empowering people and having
[1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:28.360]  a message about information and things that are happening and inform them about the grid
[1:16:28.360 --> 1:16:34.560]  and how the world works and what the systems are doing. People want different subjects,
[1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:39.760]  different guests, different info. That's what makes a popular radio show and effective
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:47.720]  as well. If you perseverate on one subject over and over and over and over and over and
[1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:52.920]  over and over and over and over again, it, it, it, it doesn't garner large audiences.
[1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:59.920]  And I'm also trying to give you a little bit of a tip there. I mean, if we wake up the
[1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:03.720]  public to the fact that eugenics is being carried out against us and we're being poisoned
[1:17:03.720 --> 1:17:07.320]  and we can give them the documents and the facts and the info, they're going to wake
[1:17:07.320 --> 1:17:13.920]  up and the new order is going to fall. But if we start instead of starting in square
[1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:22.240]  A and go to square Z with people and immediately get into the most esoteric things or interlocking
[1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:27.720]  secret societies and different global mafias, you are not going to defeat the new world
[1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:35.440]  order. You see, there's an attack profile of divide and conquer that the new world order
[1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:40.640]  has where they, when you read Cointel Pro, you can go read the thousands of pages that
[1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:46.440]  were declassified. It was how to go get groups to fight with each other. I mean, I used
[1:17:46.440 --> 1:17:52.520]  the example of the Black Panthers in Chicago and Detroit and other play LA, New York, DC.
[1:17:52.520 --> 1:17:58.080]  They'd go to them and they'd, they'd, they'd infiltrate with a, with a, you know, well-spoken
[1:17:58.080 --> 1:18:04.160]  blacks on the payroll and they'd say, you know, brother, what an ishmael. He won't
[1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:09.200]  talk about how it's this and we need to radicalize things and, you know, we need to start robbing
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:13.880]  banks instead of feeding the homeless and we need to get radical and get violent and,
[1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:18.280]  and then that would immediately create division and then they'd have fights over the violent
[1:18:18.280 --> 1:18:22.160]  split-off groups and then the violent split-off group would be run by a fed and then they
[1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:27.800]  would not bust the violent group. They'd go bust all the peaceful people. So A, I love
[1:18:27.800 --> 1:18:30.960]  how in the message boards there's always, we need to start killing these people and
[1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:35.880]  start hanging them and start murder them and we'll go track their IPs, their blocked IPs,
[1:18:35.880 --> 1:18:43.240]  but we've learned that their IPs that, you know, clusters of feds are using, where they're
[1:18:43.240 --> 1:18:49.760]  coming from. I mean, there's feds out there doing that. So look, we're having an effect
[1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:54.280]  educating people, one person at a time, just teaching them that there is a box you're in,
[1:18:54.280 --> 1:18:58.600]  get outside the box, that there is a paradigm control, that there's stuff going on you don't
[1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:03.400]  know about, that there's a world out there outside of television and church, that, that
[1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:07.400]  there are elites, that they are carrying out programs and then I've always been successful
[1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:11.480]  because I've just said, don't believe me, go look at what I'm claiming, go look at what
[1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:19.880]  I'm saying and then we get people to go out and take action on their own and, and that's
[1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:25.000]  what's most effective. That's an attack that isn't organized that the new old order can't
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:30.440]  compute for and can't deal with and can't infiltrate. You think they can infiltrate
[1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:36.360]  30 million people putting up Ron Paul signs? No, they don't have that many agents. They're
[1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:41.800]  defenseless against us. They're defenseless against everything we're doing as long as
[1:19:41.800 --> 1:19:48.120]  it's uncoordinated and multifaceted lone wolf guerrilla information warfare attacks. Launch
[1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:57.040]  info war now, defeat the enemy. It is a big idea, a new world order. In the near future,
[1:19:57.040 --> 1:20:03.680]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Bilderberg, put their objective
[1:20:03.680 --> 1:20:09.840]  being world domination. For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the
[1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:15.600]  birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is
[1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:23.480]  at hand. For the first time in history, the elites plan for world government is blown
[1:20:23.480 --> 1:20:28.400]  wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:20:28.400 --> 1:20:32.200]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.

[1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:55.240]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[1:22:55.240 --> 1:23:00.160]  disease such as cancer or diabetes? Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat,
[1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:04.360]  what we drink, the environment and our high stress lifestyles. It's these choices that
[1:23:04.360 --> 1:23:09.120]  cause decreased energy, weight gain and eventually disease. The easiest way to reduce disease
[1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:14.320]  causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water. At SnyderHealth.com we offer
[1:23:14.320 --> 1:23:19.040]  a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization

[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:26.440]  It's really elementary. We need to be unified as a movement against tyranny, but be diverse.
[1:24:26.440 --> 1:24:32.720]  And anybody that tries to get us to end fight with each other, those are the agents. Or
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:36.920]  more often than not, they've engineered us to be end fighters, they've engineered us
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:47.720]  to be small minded. It's how we've been trained. So most of them aren't even agents. So stay
[1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:54.960]  focused on the message. Most anti-neural water groups are neurotic weirdos who can't
[1:24:54.960 --> 1:25:01.280]  ever even cover an issue or a new story to warn the public because they're too busy obsessing
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:07.200]  on how only they know the secret key. All right, let's go ahead and talk to Betsy in
[1:25:07.200 --> 1:25:09.040]  Florida. You're on the air. Betsy, welcome.
[1:25:09.040 --> 1:25:15.440]  Hi, Alex. Thank you. I'm a longtime subscriber to Prison Planet TV. Very much enjoy it.
[1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:16.440]  Thank you for the support.
[1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:24.920]  I also, I wanted to give people something positive. I followed you for a long time,
[1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:29.480]  and we've been doing a lot of things here in Panama City. First of all, my husband is
[1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:36.160]  the mayor of Callaway, and one of the things that we had going here was we lived near an
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:41.680]  Air Force base, and the military was trying to control our development here. Their excuse
[1:25:41.680 --> 1:25:48.840]  was that they needed to control what was developed because of the airspace and so forth, and
[1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:54.440]  my husband supported an effort with another mayor here to fight the military on that and
[1:25:54.440 --> 1:26:01.880]  they want because they wanted to make the other city see that once the military had
[1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:05.800]  control of that, they'd have control of other things, too.
[1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:06.800]  Absolutely.
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:15.080]  Yeah. I also started my own newsletter, which I just, I paid for myself. I published it.
[1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:21.440]  I use some of your material as my sources, got that out there. That's a very easy thing
[1:26:21.440 --> 1:26:25.360]  to do with the way computers are now. You can email it to people or mail it.
[1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:31.360]  Exactly. Just wake people up. Just start attacking the Info War. Just get in there with your
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:35.520]  weapons and just get in there and go after the New World Order.
[1:26:35.520 --> 1:26:43.280]  Another thing that people can do, which I did, I went on a speech circuit myself. I got
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:49.840]  myself on the agenda for every city council meeting in the area and just spoke against
[1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:55.960]  the New World Order and just told people about the Real ID Act and all the other things
[1:26:55.960 --> 1:27:00.480]  and what was coming in the future and what was already on the law books that I quoted
[1:27:00.480 --> 1:27:05.760]  and so forth. Usually what happened was the city council members didn't care, but the
[1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:09.760]  people in the audience were very interested and very supportive.
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:14.840]  Absolutely. All over the country, people are going to city council meetings. That's where
[1:27:14.840 --> 1:27:21.520]  you find the people that care and are involved and it's having a giant effect. Again, you're
[1:27:21.520 --> 1:27:27.880]  the perfect example of what we need here with the weapons that we have in the Info War.
[1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:32.880]  You are taking action. You are out there getting the job done and I salute you, Betsy.
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:38.920]  Thank you. I do have one question though, Alex. I know that for the coming time, especially
[1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:43.120]  when there's an economic downturn, you're suggesting people move out in the country
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:48.080]  to be more independent. My question is, we're in a situation where we can't move out of
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:54.840]  the city and we do own our home and our property. We're trying to grow our own food and stuff,
[1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:59.120]  but what do you suggest for people like us? What more can we do? I'm worried our property
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:03.040]  taxes will go up or something.
[1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:07.000]  I'm not saying everybody should move to the country. I'm saying that's an option if you
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:13.040]  can find the right place. I mean, it's good to even have 5, 10, 20 acres, 50, 60 miles
[1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:18.560]  from where you live in case there is a complete depression. If you've got a mobile home or
[1:28:18.560 --> 1:28:22.360]  something else, you can go out there with your storeable food and basically wait it
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:32.760]  out. I mean, if we do have a depression, it will unravel into war in the streets overnight.
[1:28:32.760 --> 1:28:38.200]  And so we will have a complete unraveling of society. Even the federal government has
[1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:46.080]  said that's a danger. And so I'm just saying that if there's a breakdown and there's riots
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:52.840]  or burning, I mean, look, I wouldn't live in Los Angeles. I wouldn't live in East LA.
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:57.280]  I wouldn't live in Southern LA. I wouldn't live in New York City. I wouldn't live in
[1:28:57.280 --> 1:29:03.080]  the middle of Chicago. It's just those big urban centers are time bombs. They're also
[1:29:03.080 --> 1:29:11.640]  big terror attacks, big terror attack targets, just waiting to happen or bird flu attacks.
[1:29:11.640 --> 1:29:16.880]  I mean, if you're living out in the country, it's a very low probability that the feds
[1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:20.360]  are going to release the plague or whatever they're going to do in your area. You're going
[1:29:20.360 --> 1:29:24.720]  to be able to lock down and stay safe. But if you're in a major city, you may be there
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:29.160]  when the spray planes fly over and spray the city. So there's just no telling when
[1:29:29.160 --> 1:29:34.000]  these psychopaths running things. Just statistically, it's safer to live in the country. We're going
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:40.720]  to come back, take more calls than Kurt Nemo is going to be in studio. Stay with us.
[1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:48.320]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:55.440]  In fact, rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on
[1:29:55.440 --> 1:30:00.800]  world health is staggering. We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals
[1:30:00.800 --> 1:30:05.960]  each day. The human body is amazing and efficient in design. But because of the polluted world
[1:30:05.960 --> 1:30:11.720]  in which we live is unable to remove all toxins. The solution detoxification integrated with

[1:31:54.400 --> 1:31:59.000]  in a pH-balanced alkaline environment. But as you know, most people are overly acidic
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:04.640]  due to stress, acidic diet and lack of exercise. pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance
[1:32:04.640 --> 1:32:08.960]  and perfect health as well as prevention of disease. People who alkalize the water they
[1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:14.080]  drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and loss of weight. It was intended
[1:32:14.080 --> 1:32:18.360]  for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people
[1:32:18.360 --> 1:32:23.600]  are overly acidic. The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[1:32:23.600 --> 1:32:27.920]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:33.640]  it. Do your part. Alkalize and supercharge your body now. Alcovision plasma pH drops
