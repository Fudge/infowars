[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:39.300]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:39.300 --> 00:46.380]  hard to believe ladies and gentlemen that it's already December 1st 2014 I'm
[00:46.380 --> 00:51.900]  your host Alex Jones we're going to open the phones up today to continue the
[00:51.900 --> 01:01.740]  discussion that we had yesterday on the Sunday broadcast what is your line in the
[01:01.740 --> 01:11.420]  sand and then once that line is crossed what is your response to the
[01:11.420 --> 01:17.540]  tyranny because so many of those voices that are perpetually calling for some
[01:17.540 --> 01:21.500]  type of violent overthrow of the government never have a plan they just
[01:21.500 --> 01:26.300]  say you should go out and do it or I should go out and do it and then
[01:26.300 --> 01:35.360]  meanwhile we have the social engineers pretty much perpetually trying to
[01:35.360 --> 01:41.860]  foam in a mindless communist style French Revolution style rioting burning
[01:41.860 --> 01:49.460]  raping in the street type operation so we need to have a big discussion about
[01:49.460 --> 01:54.860]  what is your line in the sand and then what are you doing to stop that line
[01:54.860 --> 01:59.060]  from being crossed politically economically with the power you have
[01:59.060 --> 02:05.340]  what are the different tools we have short of violence the social engineers
[02:05.340 --> 02:09.780]  want to build up their police state have it go out and start abusing the public
[02:09.780 --> 02:15.460]  foment the worst elements of society to legitimize the police state and then
[02:15.460 --> 02:25.500]  play the two sides off against each other that's the bottom line so how do we
[02:25.500 --> 02:29.580]  educate the public about this manipulation about this conspiracy and
[02:29.580 --> 02:35.260]  how do we try to thwart it well about half the public just watches television
[02:35.260 --> 02:40.140]  all day and doesn't care what planet they're on the numbers show that but a
[02:40.140 --> 02:45.700]  good 20 30% are concerned are somewhat awake and are somewhat involved they
[02:45.700 --> 02:50.260]  just need to be encouraged and empowered and then you've got folks that need to
[02:50.260 --> 02:55.980]  be targeted peacefully to be awakened and warned about what they're part of in
[02:55.980 --> 03:03.220]  corporate governance in government governance in police and in law we
[03:03.220 --> 03:08.340]  need to force a major debate about all this and really make people have a
[03:08.340 --> 03:12.700]  private discussion and a public discussion about what's their line in the
[03:12.700 --> 03:18.380]  sand what do they stand for what orders will they follow what orders won't they
[03:18.380 --> 03:24.500]  follow do they believe that they should follow any order and if so do they know
[03:24.500 --> 03:31.860]  about the Nuremberg precept of just following orders doesn't cut it what I'm
[03:31.860 --> 03:36.100]  getting at here is that there is an attempt to foment civil unrest Obama is
[03:36.100 --> 03:40.660]  set to meet on Ferguson they have NFL players doing the hands up now when they
[03:40.660 --> 03:49.060]  make a touchdown saying don't shoot the evil isn't the deadly vaccines the evil
[03:49.060 --> 03:54.780]  isn't the open borders and the free welfare to bankrupt the nation the evil
[03:54.780 --> 03:59.300]  isn't half the black people aboard it before they're born the one evil is this
[03:59.300 --> 04:08.100]  brown gentleman being shot in Ferguson two weeks after I cut a video warning of
[04:08.100 --> 04:12.820]  the Pentagon preparing for a black race war that I believe the Justice
[04:12.820 --> 04:18.140]  Department would trigger not a hard prediction and you've now seen it begin
[04:18.140 --> 04:25.980]  to unfold it's very frustrating to know how the script reads and to see
[04:25.980 --> 04:32.260]  government provocateurs trying to radicalize every group they can and
[04:32.260 --> 04:35.540]  trying to divide and conquer it's very sad we're gonna break it all down get into

[08:42.860 --> 08:47.380]  and values those are all under attack by multinational anti-free market
[08:47.380 --> 08:51.740]  corporations who are establishing an anti-human world government where the
[08:51.740 --> 08:56.100]  general population will be replaced by machines and that's only in a phase to
[08:56.100 --> 09:00.940]  make us obsolete ahead of making us vestigial ceremonial so that the
[09:00.940 --> 09:06.980]  population can be forcibly reduced that's the big eugenics global governance
[09:06.980 --> 09:16.700]  end of the rat hole bottom of the rabbit hole plan that is a public plan by the
[09:16.700 --> 09:24.380]  UN social engineers and their modern techno priest the transhumanist who put
[09:24.380 --> 09:29.140]  out a pop version of transhumanism saying it will empower the public when in
[09:29.140 --> 09:33.660]  truth it is beyond Sauron's ring how it will take us into the darkness and
[09:33.660 --> 09:40.100]  their bind us to use that allegory I want to get into Obama attempting to
[09:40.100 --> 09:49.460]  foment with Al Sharpton MSNBC and others racial division and civil unrest in
[09:49.460 --> 09:56.540]  this country is a political diversion we have predicted this two weeks before
[09:56.540 --> 10:05.580]  mr. Brown was shot dead in Ferguson I shot a special report and we wrote an
[10:05.580 --> 10:13.380]  article predicting we'll put that up on screen for folks predicting stage race
[10:13.380 --> 10:19.460]  riots in America with the headline army training to fight blacks special
[10:19.460 --> 10:29.420]  emergency alert so the Justice Department goes in and foments while at
[10:29.420 --> 10:33.060]  the same time then sending the police and military out to deal with what they
[10:33.060 --> 10:37.780]  have fomented flashback us army training to fight black Americans doomsday
[10:37.780 --> 10:44.060]  disneyland facility used as practice ground for civil unrest November 26 is
[10:44.060 --> 10:50.380]  when we republished that but if you go back to the article we flashback that
[10:50.380 --> 10:56.100]  last week you can see that was first published July 17th as timestamp 2014
[10:56.100 --> 11:06.980]  if you go to the YouTube video beneath it you can see the company itself putting
[11:06.980 --> 11:12.100]  out the promo video and if they and then if you go below that video you can see
[11:12.100 --> 11:16.580]  the special report that I filed and what's the title of that one I forget I
[11:16.580 --> 11:21.380]  believe it's a special report army trains to fight there it is army trains to
[11:21.380 --> 11:25.500]  combat black Americans you can click on that on YouTube show folks the timestamp
[11:25.500 --> 11:36.540]  that is July 17th 2014 and it's a 29 minute report now there's some other
[11:36.540 --> 11:41.300]  news I covered in there but I'm very tempted at the bottom of the hour to
[11:41.300 --> 11:45.060]  play this report again show that people can really hear it and see it in
[11:45.060 --> 11:50.300]  context and understand that there are foreign interests that control the
[11:50.300 --> 11:54.060]  countries of the private Federal Reserve they need to get the police and
[11:54.060 --> 11:59.540]  military who are loyal Americans on average as bad as the police are around
[11:59.540 --> 12:04.260]  the country they're more informed and more loyal and more awake than the
[12:04.260 --> 12:09.820]  general public in my research on the street and in the numbers so that's why
[12:09.820 --> 12:13.500]  I criticized the police and some departments are completely criminal
[12:13.500 --> 12:17.460]  other departments are pretty good overall the larger issue is they're being
[12:17.460 --> 12:23.180]  globalized they're being standardized they're being overtaken right now just
[12:23.180 --> 12:28.740]  like Hitler took over the military in 1933 in Germany in Deutschland if
[12:28.740 --> 12:32.300]  somebody could have reached out to the military and the police before all that
[12:32.300 --> 12:37.060]  happened 20 million Germans might not have been killed and tens of millions
[12:37.060 --> 12:46.820]  of others but Germany's mistake cost them 21 million people look it up and it
[12:46.820 --> 12:50.740]  was the military too late they tried to stop the Nazi Party well what we have
[12:50.740 --> 12:54.740]  is a globalist party that doesn't get in trouble because they've got the big
[12:54.740 --> 12:58.500]  accounting firms and the lawyers and the law firms and they have all these
[12:58.500 --> 13:01.620]  degrees of separation they fence their corruption through all these
[13:01.620 --> 13:05.580]  international agreements and bodies and boards and no one ever takes
[13:05.580 --> 13:09.060]  responsibility for what they've done
[13:13.860 --> 13:18.380]  and the globalists are trying to make the police and the governing class a new
[13:18.380 --> 13:22.900]  sub-class that's above the general public that has special rights kind of
[13:22.900 --> 13:30.300]  like local petty nobility or something this is the attempt and people see that
[13:30.300 --> 13:35.660]  corruption they see that above the law haughtiness and arrogance in the feds
[13:35.660 --> 13:40.460]  and in many police departments and they see the corruption and the government
[13:40.460 --> 13:48.820]  drug dealing and they see the rich being above the law and and it makes the
[13:48.820 --> 13:56.380]  public angry but when I ask what is your line in the sand the system wants to
[13:56.380 --> 13:59.480]  just make it about the police that's what Obama's doing that's what the
[13:59.480 --> 14:06.860]  Justice Department's doing local police state county and city so that the feds
[14:06.860 --> 14:11.260]  can be the saviors by federalizing when the feds themselves have gone under
[14:11.260 --> 14:16.700]  UNESCO and the UN and unionization and agenda 21 and under these treaties
[14:16.700 --> 14:20.900]  they've already federalized most the police and have given them the training
[14:20.900 --> 14:26.620]  and created the culture that the public hates and their answer is more
[14:26.620 --> 14:34.780]  federalization to counter that so when MSNBC and CNN I covered this yesterday
[14:34.780 --> 14:43.740]  Time magazine's headline when it's time to riot or a time for rioting will pull
[14:43.740 --> 14:47.660]  the actual headline out I'm going for memory and then CNN goes this is
[14:47.660 --> 14:52.260]  legitimate demonstration you know burning things down is is demonstrating
[14:52.260 --> 14:57.900]  really beating up a woman just because she's white and she works at Papa John's
[14:57.900 --> 15:03.260]  making $12 an hour that's legitimate because she tries to cook pizzas for the
[15:03.260 --> 15:09.220]  community walking traffic and attacking whites and their vehicles just like we
[15:09.220 --> 15:14.420]  saw in the LA riots now happening again that's a good thing that's legitimate the
[15:14.420 --> 15:26.060]  media the controlled globalist run media is trying right now to foment a race
[15:26.060 --> 15:32.220]  war there's the headline Ferguson in defense of rioting we have a 45 minute
[15:32.220 --> 15:36.220]  video of nothing but white people's cars being stopped in st. Louis and Missouri
[15:36.220 --> 15:45.020]  by mobs of black people and I mean I'm otherwise the police just stand back and
[15:45.020 --> 15:50.300]  let this go on it's not like they're just blocking traffic so the cars can't go
[15:50.300 --> 15:54.900]  by they're taunting there they're getting in the people's faces they're
[15:54.900 --> 15:58.860]  screaming at them just because they're white I mean imagine seeing a mob of
[15:58.860 --> 16:05.220]  white people going into an area and blocking the cars of black people this
[16:05.220 --> 16:10.340]  is cuckluck's clan type behavior and I'm just glad I mean of a group of white
[16:10.340 --> 16:14.100]  people Hispanics black whatever they try to block my car I'm gonna get in their
[16:14.100 --> 16:17.900]  face and there's videos of me getting in people's face not because I'm a tough
[16:17.900 --> 16:24.180]  guy you are trying to enslave me and oppress me by by by blaming me just
[16:24.180 --> 16:28.740]  because of my skin color for something that happened and now you've got the NFL
[16:28.740 --> 16:31.460]  players you know putting their hands up when they make a touchdown I mean this
[16:31.460 --> 16:35.980]  is really being pushed by the system we don't have rights to not be spied on by
[16:35.980 --> 16:39.300]  the NSA they're trying to take our second amendment they're poisoning us all
[16:39.300 --> 16:43.460]  for the vaccines in the GMO all this is happening to you no matter what color
[16:43.460 --> 16:49.420]  you are but they don't want us realizing foreign banks have signed us on to
[16:49.420 --> 16:54.980]  $2,000 trillion was 1.5 quadrillion the Wall Street Journal and others
[16:54.980 --> 16:59.940]  reported now it's two quadrillion in derivatives over a hundred times all
[16:59.940 --> 17:04.780]  the real wealth in the world none of it's even our debt our debts 19 trillion
[17:04.780 --> 17:09.820]  they've signed us on to $2,000 trillion well the US has signed on now it was 60
[17:09.820 --> 17:13.820]  something now it's a hundred trillion of that the IMF and World Bank and the
[17:13.820 --> 17:19.220]  Davos forum says that's our debt that these bankers created to tie us to it
[17:19.220 --> 17:24.420]  and our politicians have been controlled we should all be focused on the
[17:24.420 --> 17:27.980]  criminal mega banks that aren't free market that are shutting down the real
[17:27.980 --> 17:32.340]  banks and credit unions and our industry and trying to pass laws where mom and
[17:32.340 --> 17:37.100]  pops can't operate this is about a monopoly of control to dominate the
[17:37.100 --> 17:42.580]  future and now Obama to hold Ferguson meeting at White House and to plan the
[17:42.580 --> 17:47.260]  press conferences you name it and to meet with elected officials in law
[17:47.260 --> 17:52.380]  enforcement so they're just going to hype this like like this is the biggest
[17:52.380 --> 17:57.980]  issue in the world and you know it's legitimate what's going on to hope this
[17:57.980 --> 18:01.700]  goes on all over the country and they've got Democratic Party operative
[18:01.700 --> 18:05.700]  groups you can read the signs who puts them out socialist communist groups out
[18:05.700 --> 18:13.980]  there fomenting it in all 50 states to make political change be about racial
[18:13.980 --> 18:19.340]  division that's classic Balkanization the opposite of what will actually bring
[18:19.340 --> 18:24.860]  society together and fix things Obama to discuss efforts to improve nationwide
[18:24.860 --> 18:31.300]  law enforcement post Ferguson see the feds are gonna fix it with more armored
[18:31.300 --> 18:36.260]  vehicles and more checkpoints and more tasers and more threat continuum shoot
[18:36.260 --> 18:39.980]  people at the drop of a hat and then when the cops do that oh my gosh more
[18:39.980 --> 18:45.860]  federalization to answer I told you back in July exactly what was coming and
[18:45.860 --> 18:50.900]  now it's happening and also tells you they're gonna turn their FBI informants
[18:50.900 --> 18:55.460]  and operatives and dirty tricks people lose on the real media on the
[18:55.460 --> 19:00.140]  libertarian media on the Tea Party and it's going on hardcore infiltration of
[19:00.140 --> 19:06.300]  organizations attacks sabotage dirty tricks stuff being made up I expect this

[25:17.940 --> 25:24.100]  tries to forcibly inject me or my family I'm done they get on the news and I've
[25:24.100 --> 25:27.300]  read the news articles here on air every year in August when they lie
[25:27.300 --> 25:31.740]  everybody's in every local paper I see it's all over the country vaccines are
[25:31.740 --> 25:35.700]  safe and effective in there are no side effects under sore arm and it's
[25:35.700 --> 25:41.180]  outrageous to say so and that's the law you must take them well there's
[25:41.180 --> 25:45.140]  literally hundreds and hundreds of bad side effects there is no law you got to
[25:45.140 --> 25:52.020]  take them they lie to you in a wall of fraud so what's my line in the sand gun

[26:02.980 --> 26:08.220]  that wants to be totalitarian and authoritarian to the max that the former
[26:08.220 --> 26:11.940]  head of the NSA William Benny said that on the show it's about social control
[26:11.940 --> 26:15.700]  about suppressing free speech and they've got the Justice Department through
[26:15.700 --> 26:20.260]  the FBI on record now trying to infiltrate every political group in the
[26:20.260 --> 26:24.500]  country to destabilize them and try to stir up violence and infighting that's
[26:24.500 --> 26:29.100]  illegal and it's illegal to have the IRS going after the Tea Party and pro-life
[26:29.100 --> 26:34.620]  groups come on FBI you know it's illegal so you have special units where you go
[26:34.620 --> 26:40.860]  out and hire miscreant mentally ill borderline personality disorders and
[26:40.860 --> 26:50.100]  psychopaths as informants to go around doing God knows what it's incredible and
[26:50.100 --> 26:53.540]  they've got compartmentalized FBI right next to them investigating bank robberies
[26:53.540 --> 26:57.780]  and kidnappings that are good men and women wake up and to cry what's going on
[26:57.780 --> 27:05.100]  in your own agency don't be part of this Sydney Morning Herald flu vaccine
[27:05.100 --> 27:09.460]  death toll rises in Italy the number of people who've died in Italy after being
[27:09.460 --> 27:13.780]  administered the flu vaccine made by Swiss pharmacological company Norvatis
[27:13.780 --> 27:19.860]  has risen to 13 the Italian medical agency has warned against panic and
[27:19.860 --> 27:23.540]  stress there's not proof yet that it was the vaccine that led to the deaths
[27:23.540 --> 27:29.500]  however it is banned two batches of the product called flu aid as a
[27:29.500 --> 27:34.380]  precautionary measure pending further studies this is the standard boiler plate
[27:34.380 --> 27:39.100]  that they put out whenever there's vaccine deaths if there's a thousand
[27:39.100 --> 27:44.260]  deaths they'll say it's five and then they'll say but we don't know it's the
[27:44.260 --> 27:52.620]  vaccine let me explain something there is a global long-term program with
[27:52.620 --> 27:58.980]  sterilants you name it in the vaccines they now have social control vaccines
[27:58.980 --> 28:03.380]  that aren't even vaccines they are nanotech viruses they had for over a
[28:03.380 --> 28:07.500]  decade they're now quote testing it on the troops as I warned they would five
[28:07.500 --> 28:11.500]  years ago in the special peace brain-eating vaccines just type that
[28:11.500 --> 28:16.580]  in you see the 10-minute video report and now they're quote testing them on
[28:16.580 --> 28:19.980]  depressed troops oh you'll never be depressed again because the live
[28:19.980 --> 28:28.060]  virus artificially created it is nanotech goes in and eats receptors in
[28:28.060 --> 28:33.420]  the brain associated with euphoria religious experiences and also with
[28:33.420 --> 28:41.180]  depression and you aren't going to be upset anymore because you're going to be
[28:41.180 --> 28:46.740]  basically a passive robot now they're already injecting the veterans with this
[28:46.740 --> 28:51.940]  and it's beyond the science fiction movie going on at the VA right here in
[28:51.940 --> 28:58.620]  Austin they call it an anti-stress vaccine and there's a whole family of
[28:58.620 --> 29:02.700]  them I read I forget the name of the book I made a movie out of it a decade
[29:02.700 --> 29:05.700]  ago everyone saw the movie I just couldn't believe when I the movie came
[29:05.700 --> 29:09.140]  out it was like a B movie had some big actors but I didn't forget the book I
[29:09.140 --> 29:13.860]  want to look it up guys look up science fiction book where viruses are used for
[29:13.860 --> 29:19.180]  social control to re-engineer brains and then I went and saw the new born movie
[29:19.180 --> 29:28.100]  couple years ago and in that that they use viruses to make them superman to eat
[29:28.100 --> 29:31.020]  areas of the brain that would have inhibition so you know they can bench
[29:31.020 --> 29:35.100]  press a thousand pounds which they can actually do you can take a guy that can
[29:35.100 --> 29:38.780]  bench press 300 pounds have a virus eat areas of the brain that have inhibition
[29:38.780 --> 29:41.980]  governor control and you can bench press a thousand pounds that's just an
[29:41.980 --> 29:48.460]  example of virus technology in the brain we'll be right back stay with us we're

[37:19.180 --> 37:26.580]  dystopic technological technocracy that is designed to capture harness mutate
[37:26.580 --> 37:37.740]  and finally destroy humanity it is 100% pure unadulterated death and
[37:37.740 --> 37:43.060]  destruction you wonder why serial killers like to grab little kids and
[37:43.060 --> 37:49.860]  torture them for months things that are just the most horrible dark energy
[37:49.860 --> 37:54.780]  anyone could imagine and it's so alien people hear about it and they just turn
[37:54.780 --> 38:02.780]  away imagine that times a billion imagine that energy manifests through robot
[38:02.780 --> 38:10.860]  armies and Skynet technology it is going to take its time bringing us down and
[38:10.860 --> 38:16.900]  making us beg to be destroyed and enslaved because the true bottom of the
[38:16.900 --> 38:25.580]  rat hole the true bottom of Satan's pit is that the system wants us with free will
[38:25.580 --> 38:33.300]  though drugged and dazed to stumble and worship the evil as if it's the solution
[38:33.300 --> 38:40.660]  and it's the idol and to fall to our knees and embrace it before our free will
[38:40.660 --> 38:48.980]  is sucked out of us and our souls basically de-magnetized to goodness our
[38:48.980 --> 38:56.540]  souls wiped and turned to that satanic energy
[39:00.140 --> 39:03.340]  that's where we're going
[39:03.340 --> 39:14.980]  just as sure as the Sun came up this morning on this planet on this planet
[39:14.980 --> 39:19.540]  remember that there's a whole universe around us but the system wants us to
[39:19.540 --> 39:22.620]  think it's only what's on that television set only what's on the nightly
[39:22.620 --> 39:27.660]  news what the talking heads says when we know these talking heads work for
[39:27.660 --> 39:32.140]  institutions that have made the decision that you're not even conscious and that
[39:32.140 --> 39:35.980]  you're an animal and that you don't have a right to any freedom or any future and
[39:35.980 --> 39:39.980]  so they're going to dumb you down and give you false maps of the world so that
[39:39.980 --> 39:44.780]  you become a joke and a failure so you'll time and time again come to them
[39:44.780 --> 39:51.220]  for empowerment no one can deny that the welfare state the way it's done by the
[39:51.220 --> 39:57.780]  West is meant to enslave just as the welfare state and the company store and
[39:57.780 --> 40:04.380]  sharecropping or the reservation with Native Americans or the plantation is
[40:04.380 --> 40:13.020]  designed to have you totally dependent on the master but this master doesn't
[40:13.020 --> 40:19.620]  want you to pull a plow or to cut the wheat or to tend the cattle this master
[40:19.620 --> 40:29.660]  wants you in agonizing anguish and pain gibbering after its flame like a moth
[40:29.660 --> 40:39.380]  believing that oblivion in evil is your empowerment when the answer to all our
[40:39.380 --> 40:46.340]  problems is waiting right there but we have to with free will take it and make
[40:46.340 --> 40:51.740]  the spiritual decision first that I want to be good I want to be enlightened I
[40:51.740 --> 40:55.780]  want to be informed I want to know how the world really works I asked the
[40:55.780 --> 40:59.500]  creator of the universe in these incredible odds were up against to give
[40:59.500 --> 41:11.020]  me the providence to have the prescience or what the Bible calls discernment so
[41:11.020 --> 41:23.060]  that I might survive to bring aid to others and the world knows the devil
[41:23.060 --> 41:30.700]  knows that you have a good heart so you will be falsely convicted by the angel
[41:30.700 --> 41:37.540]  of light that masquerades as an angel by the culture to tell you how you're bad
[41:37.540 --> 41:42.940]  and how you're guilty and how your little sins make you imperfect and make
[41:42.940 --> 41:46.900]  you bad so you couldn't dare go speak at the front of the church you couldn't
[41:46.900 --> 41:51.060]  dare call in to talk radio you couldn't dare start a radio show you couldn't
[41:51.060 --> 41:54.500]  dare try to help somebody else or tell somebody when they're doing something
[41:54.500 --> 42:00.140]  destructive because after all you're not perfect see how that works how they
[42:00.140 --> 42:08.100]  guilt everyone oh you're racist accept Obamacare oh maybe your forebearers had
[42:08.100 --> 42:17.260]  slaves maybe why 2% of the country had slaves you're bad you have to have guilt
[42:17.260 --> 42:21.060]  not to go help other people that are less advantaged and actually help them
[42:21.060 --> 42:24.260]  yourself that's how you really help somebody by bringing them into your
[42:24.260 --> 42:29.540]  society and teaching them and lifting them up rising tide raises the ships all
[42:29.540 --> 42:36.500]  ships as Kennedy rightfully said no no no you do what Al Gore says what Bill
[42:36.500 --> 42:41.820]  Clinton says what Rachel Maddow says what Barack Obama says what Al
[42:41.820 --> 42:48.020]  Sharpton says what Jesse Jackson says and when you do what they say now you've
[42:48.020 --> 42:54.140]  been forgiven by the high priest you've come and made sacrifice to them you've
[42:54.140 --> 42:59.540]  not owned guns you've accepted higher taxes you've gotten in line with the
[42:59.540 --> 43:08.660]  party line to feel like you belong and so you've been sanctified in your little
[43:08.660 --> 43:15.540]  collectivist progressive cult that's not even a real progressive cult it's a
[43:15.540 --> 43:22.540]  eugenics scientifically written planned neoliberal anti-human super fascistic
[43:22.540 --> 43:32.300]  mind-controlled cornucopia of anti-human venom then you got the
[43:32.300 --> 43:38.020]  Republicans run by the very same special interest trying to dance on our
[43:38.020 --> 43:43.740]  political graves trying to make sure that no opposition can form through the
[43:43.740 --> 43:51.700]  Americana movement of true free market populism constitutional ideas common
[43:51.700 --> 43:57.460]  sense that people are desperate for like a diver whose air is run out racing to
[43:57.460 --> 44:01.380]  the top is desperate for the surface or a fish out of water is desperate for the
[44:01.380 --> 44:06.740]  sea it's there and the whole system is designed to turn it around and act like
[44:06.740 --> 44:13.340]  people that want basic freedom or weirdos are dangerous or bad the people
[44:13.340 --> 44:19.300]  that get upset and say I'm not a slave are weird and aggressive show me one
[44:19.300 --> 44:25.620]  mammal that you're trying to enslave or drag off that won't fight but we're
[44:25.620 --> 44:30.860]  trained to go along with it but see I'm not going to fight mindlessly just
[44:30.860 --> 44:37.580]  burning things down I'm not gonna fight shooting up a police station I'm going
[44:37.580 --> 44:41.020]  to fight by warning people and showing them what's happening and doing what the
[44:41.020 --> 44:51.780]  enemy wants I am not going to sit there and play games and and and follow the
[44:51.780 --> 44:58.260]  template that they've put out because the thing that the enemy wants us to do
[44:58.260 --> 45:04.820]  is to just be involved in a bunch of mindless mob rule hyped up garbage that
[45:04.820 --> 45:11.900]  the globalist can direct what they don't want the polar opposite is for us to
[45:11.900 --> 45:17.940]  reach out to government reach out to the police reach out to the agencies
[45:17.940 --> 45:22.180]  reach out to the corporations reach out with our dollars with what we purchase
[45:22.180 --> 45:28.220]  and what we support reach out with our speech to others reach out to the media
[45:28.220 --> 45:32.540]  and support media that you think is promoting freedom fight media that
[45:32.540 --> 45:36.900]  isn't using the First Amendment and I know what I'm saying is common sense
[45:36.900 --> 45:46.820]  but it's a revolutionary idea to just tell it like it is and expose the larger
[45:46.820 --> 45:50.460]  paradigm alright here's the toll free number we're opening the phone systems
[45:50.460 --> 45:56.620]  up what is your line in the sand and what are you doing to try to stop that
[45:56.620 --> 46:00.300]  line from being crossed because people talk about oh I'll get violent if they
[46:00.300 --> 46:04.780]  keep pushing you should be doing everything you can peacefully to fix
[46:04.780 --> 46:09.260]  things to try to stop it from getting violent and I'll assure you a lot of you
[46:09.260 --> 46:14.540]  out there that won't get politically involved or won't try to wake people up
[46:14.740 --> 46:20.100]  who are just preparing for violence when it comes time you're not going to defend
[46:20.100 --> 46:24.420]  yourself in almost every case you're not going to do it wisely or you're going to
[46:24.420 --> 46:28.700]  do it at some target that doesn't hurt the new world order and actually
[46:28.700 --> 46:40.100]  empowers their system most violent revolutions fail or create something
[46:40.100 --> 46:45.980]  worse that's a well-known fact in history most renaissance revolutions
[46:45.980 --> 46:54.380]  renaissance systems of freedom most velvet revolutions most revolutions of
[46:54.380 --> 47:00.060]  ideas that are better than the oppressive system those are successful
[47:00.060 --> 47:08.100]  historically and those are what the system is scared of it doesn't matter if
[47:08.100 --> 47:11.300]  you're in government or in the corporate system or the private sector or a
[47:11.300 --> 47:16.540]  retiree or black or white or old or young or Hispanic the new world order
[47:16.540 --> 47:20.620]  once you broke they want you under government health care control they
[47:20.620 --> 47:32.740]  want to run your life they hate your free will they crave control and they hate
[47:32.740 --> 47:39.740]  warriors even if they direct our warriors to carry out evil wars they hate
[47:39.740 --> 47:45.740]  the men that are willing to go out and do it these globalist absolutely have
[47:45.740 --> 47:52.300]  disdain for you because they are such craven scum and that's why they target
[47:52.300 --> 47:57.580]  you with deadly time released bio weapons in the vaccines that's why they
[47:57.580 --> 48:01.260]  target you when you get out with extrajudicial garbage to strip you of
[48:01.260 --> 48:05.540]  your rights and I'll tell the police something if the globalist hate fighting
[48:05.540 --> 48:14.780]  men do you think they like you they hate you just as much or more and you are
[48:14.780 --> 48:20.060]  being targeted as well and the police know that instinctively doesn't matter
[48:20.060 --> 48:23.220]  they try to hire cops and aren't the sharpest knives in the drawer the
[48:23.220 --> 48:29.740]  experience of real life and experiencing real evil and experiencing human
[48:29.740 --> 48:36.140]  nature and being forced into stressful situations over and over again every day
[48:36.140 --> 48:45.380]  brings police up to a level of seasoning and hardening that makes them absolute
[48:45.380 --> 48:49.220]  threats to the new world order because if we ever take the states or the federal
[48:49.220 --> 48:53.020]  government back it'll be the police that are going and arresting when the
[48:53.020 --> 48:57.060]  grand juries indict people like Henry Kissinger and others and so they want

[56:25.340 --> 56:29.740]  unemployment and so all the system has is just go go right to tribalism right to
[56:29.740 --> 56:34.740]  racism and they also know that the middle class is is fed up and scared of the
[56:34.740 --> 56:38.940]  system so they want the middle class to come begging and accept the
[56:38.940 --> 56:44.140]  militarization of police and the whole domestic spy grid in the name of stopping
[56:44.140 --> 56:49.740]  rioting and looting that's why I ask what's your line in the sand I mean I
[56:49.740 --> 56:52.500]  don't support the guy that reportedly shot the police station because he was
[56:52.500 --> 56:57.300]  mad about open borders and shot up the Mexican consulate I think that's pretty
[56:57.300 --> 57:01.620]  much terrorism just like shooting at fire department people's terrorism folks
[57:01.620 --> 57:04.740]  at what you're saying blacks are terrorists well this guy that shot up the
[57:04.740 --> 57:08.980]  police department was white as a you know driven snow is that because I'm
[57:08.980 --> 57:14.260]  against white people no because shooting up the police stations a bad idea and it
[57:14.260 --> 57:20.580]  makes political speech look bad when you tie it to it you ought to bomb all
[57:20.580 --> 57:24.060]  these police departments with news and information and talking to people and
[57:24.060 --> 57:27.660]  showing them the plan to federalize them and take their liberties and take their
[57:27.660 --> 57:31.420]  family's bank accounts and take their pensions we ought to bomb the country
[57:31.420 --> 57:37.620]  with truth and liberty and renaissance and freedom not with beating up imagine
[57:37.620 --> 57:41.420]  if two white guys were beating up a black lady at Papa John's because a white
[57:41.420 --> 57:46.140]  person had been shot months before I mean it would be incredible racism on the
[57:46.140 --> 57:51.660]  news and it would it and it would be you've got anti-white garbage going on
[57:51.660 --> 57:56.140]  now in Missouri it's disgusting and the police are standing down because they've
[57:56.140 --> 58:00.420]  been told by the feds let it get going or the feds will indict you they're
[58:00.420 --> 58:04.380]  telling cops you do anything to somebody who's black and Ferguson who's breaking
[58:04.380 --> 58:11.780]  the law you're gonna get indicted by Al Sharpton the attorney general again I
[58:11.780 --> 58:14.060]  just want to plug at the end of the hour because I've barely talked about this

[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:42.540]  simple I've been talking about it for an hour really trying to warn people
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:47.420]  Obama and Sharpton and the rest of the socialist globalist crowd are trying to
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:52.060]  hype this up the NFL's hyping it up when they're not promoting taking your guns

[01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:02.500]  the sand and what are you doing to stop that line being crossed and if it does
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:06.780]  all kick off and we can't fix things how do you expect this civil war to go I'm
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:10.180]  gonna tell you at the bottom of the hour remind me guys to do it how I think if
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:14.700]  things go bad what it's gonna look like one prime scenario there's a lot of
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:18.960]  scenarios I'm gonna tell you how I think this is all gonna go down and what my
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:28.420]  FBI CIA defense intelligence Navy intelligence special forces major
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:36.180]  generals retired top analyst top economist I'm gonna tell you what the
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:41.100]  grid looks like and why elites have all been hauling butt to the countryside and
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:47.340]  digging in let's talk to George in Connecticut George you're on the air
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:52.980]  hi Alex I think we should bombard just about every institution we're involved
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:58.260]  with or near everything from the Knights of Columbus to churches to the police
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.620]  put it put things flyers on their car basically showing them that the Rand
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:09.180]  Corporation that basically this is a communist Illuminati takeover give them
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:14.180]  give them information like on me major Jordan's diaries most people forgot
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:18.340]  about this guy he basically uncovered how we were basically funding the the
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:23.020]  communists and giving them all the secrets of and the and the supplies for
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:26.380]  building the bomb and everything that's all been declassified by the way the
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:30.780]  Wall Street Journal about a decade ago had the headline and was also the New
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:37.940]  York Times that the McCarthy was right in that it really was all true and the
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:41.580]  Pentagon was ordered with the Carnegie Endowment to literally create the Soviet
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:47.540]  Union right and then then give them maybe pass out CDs with that that on
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:50.860]  because there's interviews with major Jordan's diaries that they can they can
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:56.420]  listen to but pass out CDs with that on the best enemies people can or money
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:01.820]  can buy by by Anthony Sutton things like that so it really wakes people up and
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:06.580]  then the great and the financial financing communists while through
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:10.940]  people like the skull and bones through Charlotte Issa be when you make all those
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:14.260]  connections and see they're all connected in with with the secret
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:20.180]  societies the bankers and that one of the things I mean I wish I could ask you
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:24.380]  but this is one of the topics is how they basically were using Hitler setting
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:29.580]  him up as a boogeyman so they could give the a smoke screen for 70 years for all
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:33.740]  the communists and all the various groups absolutely 100% the Carnegie
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:38.100]  Endowment the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation this is in you know number
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.340]  one New York Times best-selling history books that won the Pulitzer Prize since
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.780]  couple of them won the Pulitzer Prize two of them IBM and the Holocaust and
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:49.820]  one other shears rise and fall the third Reich it's more than two Pulitzer
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:54.380]  Prize winning books off the Nuremberg documents our government with the
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:04:00.180]  British government created financed and then double-crossed Hitler Hitler was
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:04.340]  told the West was going to act like I'll talk about at the bottom of the
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.940]  hour because I promise to get to other points but because this ties into the
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:12.700]  master plan it is on record folks that Hitler was told he could have Czech
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:21.340]  Slovakia and France and all these other places and he was a terrible guy the
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:27.100]  point is and then he turned in took over those areas the French stood down the
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:32.060]  French didn't fight the Blitzkrieg was a joke it was just given to him French
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.540]  collab I mean Hitler a few days after the invasion was in Paris parading with
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:41.140]  French police holding the crowds back it was like handing keys over and they'd
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:44.820]  paid them all off and put the French military in control that most the
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:49.540]  Germans pulled out on back to Germany and then they set Hitler up and double
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:53.300]  crossed it so you're absolutely right I mean it goes to the mindset of these
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:59.620]  globalist how dangerous they are just like they created al-Qaeda when you're
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:06.380]  out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but if the

[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:08.740]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:15.900]  well we predicted it with precision back on July 17th of this year with an
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:19.980]  article and a special emergency alert that the federal government the justice
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:24.620]  department the criminally occupied seized government it's not our government
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:28.940]  folks it's totally legitimate sold out to foreign interest shining secret foreign
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:36.300]  treaties the president's implementing outside of law tax increases open borders
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:42.580]  UN gun treaties and cutting off our energy supplies internet regulations
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:47.780]  they're just seizing power and that's not Alex Jones saying that now it's
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:53.260]  crowd hammer and it's Jonathan Turley the big liberal professor saying Obama
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:59.820]  has tripled the abuses of Bush this is happening so what are they gonna do well
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:03.620]  there's a lot of false flags they're gonna pull but the big one we can see the
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:07.820]  preparations for is race war in this country and they've got it primed that
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:12.980]  the next time out of millions of cops and 307 million Americans that a black
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:17.420]  person gets shot questionably by the police and there's a lot of cases where
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:21.620]  there's bad shootings by the police that the whole country will go up in flames
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:28.820]  basically and they're fanning the flames so I'm asking the question what is your
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:33.140]  line of the sand is there a legitimate revolution how do you fight a modern
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:36.940]  globalist tyranny you expose the Federal Reserve as a foreign private bank and
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:40.580]  not federal you expose that they've been taking over the states you expose that
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:45.420]  they've signed us on to derivatives that aren't our debt you expose that
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:49.420]  America has been conquered by globalists but at the bottom of the hour
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:53.060]  I'll break down when I think the Civil War if it happens if we can't stop it
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:10:01.060]  we'll look like so what is your line of the sand and am I wrong to say it's
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:04.740]  bad to shoot at firefighters for no reason or to shoot up the Mexican
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:12.820]  consulate because you're against open borders that only makes the cause of
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:19.740]  freedom look bad the system wants us to violently revolt because then they could
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:25.300]  shut off debate and the system is moving the internet kill switches all of it
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:29.420]  into place and announcing the internet kill switch now and government
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:33.460]  break-ins are happening now they're gearing up they're moving on all fronts
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:40.020]  this is an incredible time to be alive let's go to your phone calls let's go
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:45.100]  to Nicholas in Missouri listening on the free iPhone app you can find an info
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:50.100]  wars.com for slash show thanks for calling Nicholas no problem Alex thanks
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:53.460]  for taking my call I just want to say that my line of the sand was crossed
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:59.420]  even before I was born I was born into a Latter-day Saint family homeschool
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:06.620]  anti TV learn how to shoot weapons but you know before a puberty stocking food
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:12.020]  you know just keeping informed and I want to those people yesterday who were
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:17.580]  calling in saying that my line of the sand is when they come take people to
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:21.620]  the camp you think they're gonna like to skip over your house like what if the
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:25.620]  Civil War that you're talking about and everybody's talking about happens today
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:32.820]  or too unorganized we need to organize we need to form some sort of you know
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:39.420]  just local level and then get it bigger because it is coming and they do have
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:46.740]  time on their side and if it happened today it would be a slaughter the point
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:51.140]  I'm getting at and you make a you know excellent point getting the organization
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:56.660]  is that if you try to organize something peaceful that's large the infiltrators
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:00.740]  and the infighters come out of the woodwork and if you let them into your
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:05.740]  organization they quickly then start making stuff up start trying to sabotage
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:09.580]  start trying to get you to do something wrong start implying what you're doing
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:13.300]  is criminal to set you up then you find out they're actually connection to the
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:19.860]  feds we've had this happen a couple times I mean this is not a game folks and
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:25.380]  what I'm getting at is there are more ways than just a shooting war with this
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:30.140]  because the average person even in the government believes they're carrying out
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:34.380]  a legitimate function they don't realize the government's been compromised and
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:38.420]  taken over that's why we have to point out it's unconstitutional it's illegal
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:43.020]  it doesn't protect us it's wrong you were spying on us without warrants
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:46.580]  non-terror related you are trying to get our guns
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:51.220]  Obamacare was a massive screw job government has a seven percent approval
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:56.660]  rating that's a government that's illegitimate right there so what I'm
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:00.620]  saying is there's a lot of positive things happening and a huge awakening
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:06.460]  across the political spectrum that's why the system wants a smoke screen of race
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:11.860]  war to try to lead to a civil war so they can then stage some terror attacks
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:17.740]  and say the Liberty Movement did it the reason I don't think this guy that shot
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.980]  up the police station the Mexican consulate and the federal building was
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:26.940]  a staged event is they weren't waiting to jump on it instantly he was killed
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:32.980]  quickly and it just you learn how to see these things it doesn't fit in with the
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:39.460]  MO a sandy hook we caught Bloomberg a day before sending out the email saying
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:45.140]  prepare to activate our program for a mass shooting to use the crisis to restrict
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:50.740]  guns and they implemented they're on the streets operatives and their mayors and
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:58.060]  and other operatives in every city to get to to hit the bricks I mean we're
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:02.260]  catching them folks we're really catching them when they pull stuff off
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:10.060]  what do you say to that no I totally agree it's just I mean you scream it all
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:15.180]  the time boy are people gonna take you know what and I think nine percent of
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:20.020]  people in this country will take you know death I mean that's just what it comes
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:26.980]  down to we need to continue awakening people we need to just organize and I
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.340]  mean I know if it's real hard because once you get big enough like you know
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:34.740]  occupy you know you do get the feds in there and they do crumble it like they
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:39.540]  have the tea party I remember going in Utah to the grass root tea parties back
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:45.860]  in 0809 and they just turn it into a corporate I know it's a lot different
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:48.940]  that's how they took that over because you couldn't get anybody to call for
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:53.140]  violence or communism or killing police or you know throwing mall off cocktails
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:57.980]  so what they do with the Democrats is they created Occupy knowing there was
[01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:01.860]  anger at corruption in Wall Street they didn't want to be legitimate reform the
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:06.700]  Federal Reserve or get rid of it they wanted it to be communism's the answer
[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:12.620]  you know capitalism caused the Wall Street crisis no crony insider basically
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:18.220]  fascist capitalism or or insider rigged capitalism caused it so the
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:22.940]  Democrats in the Soros group promoted Occupy got a bunch of people out there
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:26.140]  that were legitimately angry but when the Democrats couldn't turn into a
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:32.100]  political army they flushed it 36 cities was at 37 and one night were rated
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:36.700]  viciously by the police under federal control because again the feds won't
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:41.780]  come after your city and call your racist or whatever if you let them be in
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:48.540]  command that's how this works and it was leaked by which he leaks the FBI
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:54.580]  confirmed it was accurate the FBI had snipers there waiting for the order to
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:16:00.140]  kill all the Occupy leaders nonviolent and and they were given a
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:09.300]  presidential authorization to murder all the leaders now you think about that
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:14.100]  and they didn't do it this time they were seeing what the FBI would do when
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:18.060]  they dispatched their sniper teams and you know what they follow the orders they
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:23.620]  dispatch sniper teams to 30 plus cities and trained guns on the Occupy useful
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:27.420]  idiots on average and we're prepared to kill them and when I went around to
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:33.500]  occupy events with my you know in the Fed rallies I did three in Texas their
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.300]  grass roots like me we're like yeah yeah fellow reserve we should get rid of it
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:40.900]  but their leaders were all snarling Ford Foundation commies and they knew
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.500]  exactly what they were doing so those with me the leaders are gonna be
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:48.260]  snipered it was leaders in Occupy that they didn't control so you want to know
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:53.740]  what happens in a civil war when the globalist launch there they're not a
[01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:58.460]  long knives putch I'll talk about it coming up appreciate your call Nicholas
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:04.340]  wild man in Texas you're on the air thank God bless your brother appreciate
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:09.940]  everything appreciate you my line was drawn I mean I've been upset for
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:15.740]  outraged at the establishment for years since I've watched the steel mills go
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:21.900]  down stuff like that and but my line was drawn when my wife died of ALS she she
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:28.540]  was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre in 2010 and February they rediagnosed her with
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:35.820]  ALS and she passed away Memorial Day of 2013 and she was 53 years old and I took
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:39.820]  care of her here in my house and I watched her go downhill and I took off
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:43.140]  work so I could take care of it because I wouldn't put her in a home but she was
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:48.780]  she was could not bear children and she was lived in North Korea or not North
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:53.820]  Korea I'm sorry South Korea for our dad was in the military and so she got all
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:57.660]  these inoculations back then when she was a child she was actually kicked out
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:02.380]  of South Korea because of some stuff she was pretty wild but she was my co-
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:07.980]  partner while man while woman anyway so when that happened I started
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:12.180]  investigating what she had trying to figure out what she had and then Sandy
[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:18.460]  Hook came about and that's incidentally how I found you are in force and I'm
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:22.540]  an agreeing with you I don't want to do anything violent I don't think that would
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:26.940]  be the answer right at this point I won't become violent till they try to come
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:31.780]  take me to some camp or put me somewhere where one of my grandkids or
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:36.620]  somebody where we're not supposed to be here's the problem they are gonna lose
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:40.900]  a peaceful revolution with us of ideas so they're gonna try to give the orders
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:45.340]  to the police and the social workers that will cause good men to start fighting
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:50.860]  and you've hit the nail directly on the head here I started the broadcast with
[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:56.660]  the city morning Harold flu's vaccine death toll rises in Italy to 13 I
[01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:02.300]  guarantee it's a lot higher than that ladies and gentlemen ALS Lou Gehrig's
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:06.900]  Guillain beret you can look at the numbers they try to hide them but it is
[01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:10.980]  tens of thousands of percentage higher when Lou Gehrig had Lou Gehrig's it was
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:17.100]  so rare it didn't have a name now I go in restaurants I see people kids are
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:21.540]  shaking young women are shaking half the women it seems I know I've got like
[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:27.820]  colon cancer lung cancer young people I mean I go see kids at sporting events
[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:31.420]  they look like they've been hit by a mutation ray and the line in the sand
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:34.740]  hairs I'm gonna skip this network break this is so so important to call her don't
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:41.260]  hang up wild man is that it's all find the cure for ALS it's all find the cure
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:46.540]  for breast cancer why never discussion of why is it exponentially rising well
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:51.220]  glyphosates grow breast cancers and grow prostate cancers and it's in every
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:56.740]  water supply in the country every water supply is contaminated everyone well
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:03.700]  water aquifer city water it's full of it estrogen that's what glyphosate is
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:10.980]  chemical estrogen to kill plants and it bio accumulates you wonder why men look
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:14.940]  like women are fat no matter how much the exercise you want to know why men's
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:19.580]  genitals are shriveling and women's are getting growing larger because you're
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:27.300]  basically on steroids you're on a stair all it's all a sick joke in the
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.780]  eco science written by the White House science are laughing at you and your
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:34.420]  family and I can hear how much you loved your wife sir it makes me want to
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:38.420]  throw up to think about all the things they're doing to us we are seen as a
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:43.740]  scourge by the elite we're being soft killed the problem is if they give 40
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:51.900]  homeless people a flu vaccine in one Czech Republic or one Polish homeless
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:21:00.580]  center and 22 of them die type in 20 I think was 22 20 20 homeless die after
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:08.140]  flu shot in one facility now see that's a batch a little too strong you're meant
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:12.180]  to go off and die 20 years later you're meant to crawl off and die five years
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:19.940]  later I mean I know all these veterans people who have served three tours five
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:24.380]  tours 10 tours I mean more there it is London telegraph homeless people died
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:31.180]  after bird flu vaccine trial in Poland what's the number that died 21 people
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:36.420]  died okay I said 22 pretty good memory that was from 2008 I think another
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:41.620]  article said like 25 once at 22 that's why I'm saying that but 21 excuse me now
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:50.020]  they tell the doctors now if somebody collapses in the hospital we've got to
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:54.980]  admit it's the vaccine hope it happens that night and usually you put your 18
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:58.500]  month old Billy or Jenny down they say I love you daddy I love you mommy you
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:01.180]  read them books they're running around you wake up in the morning and they
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:04.700]  don't talk for a couple days and they got a fever and then afterwards they're
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:09.980]  gone they've been wiped it was just meant to brain damage them the auto
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:13.700]  immune response and I was on the elliptical last week it made me so
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:19.380]  angry they had a woman on CBS morning show whatever those are the national
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:23.980]  show I'm to be monitoring that level of transmission all the hype and product
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:28.260]  placement and they had this woman on I was reading the teleprompter you know
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:34.300]  reading the closed captioning I didn't have the audio on and it was like she
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:37.780]  was happy she was 40 their their daughter was three life was she was a
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:41.620]  beautiful woman and you know she was an fitness you know enthusiast and had a
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:46.340]  great corporate job and it was that you know there's good-looking happy woman
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:51.900]  with her child and living the dream and then something happened and certainly
[01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:55.300]  her feet were numb and her hands were numb and then it got worse and then now
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:58.500]  she's got a tracheotomy on breathing machine and it shows her sitting there
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:05.460]  and she'll be dead soon and I went brain inflammation from vaccines and they cut
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:10.860]  to a CAT scan a brain scan going they don't know why ALS is up and what's
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:16.420]  causing the inflammation here on the brain that causes the brain damage and
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:23.060]  they never said but I'll bet you my right hammer 100% if I could talk to that
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:26.660]  woman if I took screenshots on my phone it's actually on my phone if you go
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:30.300]  through them from like a week ago and we maybe have somebody find that episode
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:37.020]  and contact that woman I bet ten thousand dollars like I want to fly her
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:39.900]  here and pay her to come as I know they may be politically correct don't want
[01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:43.340]  to admit it because you're supposed to be cheerful and just let them kill you
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:48.700]  I guarantee you he took a flu shot or a guard of silver something because I've
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:53.900]  seen it thousands of times mystery illness paralyzing kids in Columbia mystery
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:57.900]  illness could paralyzing kids in Mexico mystery illness paralyzing kids in

[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:31.200]  women really sick that's immoral we'll grab women off the streets and sterilize
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:38.100]  them but we won't want to soft kill them Fox News mom blames daughters

[01:24:51.340 --> 01:25:00.100]  and I one of the last times I was in there on the show he goes yeah no you're
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:04.580]  right I took the flu shot and my hands and feet were numb for three months and
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:11.380]  I went to the doctor and he said no you have Gion beret from the shot and then
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:17.140]  I'm told every week by people he just trashes me all because one time I was
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:21.420]  behind the stage and he knows Joe Rogan too and we're back there and we're arguing
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:25.500]  about JFK and Joe kind of got in his face in front of his wife and man he got
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:30.140]  really upset kind of ran out so so he does he didn't want to believe JFK was
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:35.740]  killed by more than one person and he also knows he got Gion beret that luckily
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:40.620]  went away may come back see if you just get your hands and feet numb oh well
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:46.900]  that's all right huh how about being on the breathing machine hmm so they call

[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:55.780]  disorders you and I are being murdered and by the way you know how this works
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:59.740]  there's probably a cop listening to us right now in Kansas City or Oklahoma
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:07.500]  City or Chicago or somewhere else around the country and they're thinking this
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.460]  guy's extreme and isn't as bad as he says and that cop's wife's gonna take
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:17.220]  their son in for a shot next week and Bobby or David or you know whatever his
[01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:21.140]  name is is gonna have a convulsion at night and maybe have blood come out of
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:25.460]  his nose and then the CPS is gonna come and ask the officer did you shake your
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:31.100]  kid and he's gonna say no and then your son's gonna be in diapers for the rest
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:35.860]  of his life he was catching a football a year and a half old he's gonna sit
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:41.300]  there and yell at you with autism thousands of times a day for the rest
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:46.660]  of your life because you believed in the satanic devil system and people don't
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:50.140]  care they'll still bring their kids in there and they'll line them up and take
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:53.780]  those shots all day long and then I'm the bad guy for not believing in the
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:59.900]  system it's not that vaccines couldn't be somewhat safe for an effective if
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:03.780]  there's a deadly pathogen out there and you can attenuate it it's proven it can
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:08.060]  teach your body how to beat it just like eating local honey with allergies did
[01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:14.500]  better for me than Claren or be pollen locally that's an inoculation the old
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:18.180]  timers said you're allergic to something eat more of it they used to make
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:23.540]  grass tea you know if folks had hay fever they take the stuff out of the
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:29.820]  fields brew it up and you take it that vaccination isn't just 500 years old
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:33.100]  from the smallpox vaccine they invented in England it's thousands of years old
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:39.940]  I believe in it this isn't vaccines ladies and gentlemen this is social
[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:46.580]  engineering and this is a real man who called in his wife died slowly painfully

[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:16.980]  heart the CPS went and reported that they take little black kids to pesticide
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:20.500]  facilities where they test drugs and pesticides and how the seven-year-old
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:23.820]  fought for his life and tried to break out so they strapped a little black boy
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:30.860]  down and fed him pesticide intervenously until he died and no one got in
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:36.440]  trouble now if I saw people right and over that I might join him but they
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:41.780]  better be tearing the people that did it limb from limb do you understand that

[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:34.340]  going to adulterate the food and medicine with sterilants and what they

[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:06.060]  today you name it but they're always white washes like is it ethical that
[01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:13.660]  they take kids that don't have age and test drugs on them you mean cancer drugs
[01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:18.400]  that kill them a lot of times I don't know is it ethical to give a rat
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:23.540]  chemotherapy test it no it's not much less a little kid but black folks want
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:27.580]  to get mad it's usually black folks they grab for whatever reason that just
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:31.020]  people don't believe the black mamas they came into the one black lady in the
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:33.940]  Newark Daily News article and she said we're gonna take your two-year-old and
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:38.020]  and and and but if you agree to let us have the seven-year-old and don't buck
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:41.780]  it you can keep your two-year-old and they took her seven-year-old son and
[01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:45.900]  they strapped him down and they murdered him and nobody's coming to save him
[01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:51.420]  Al Sharpton's not gonna say one stinking word because he works for the Federal
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:58.180]  Bureau of Investigation and you're not gonna hear one stinking word out all
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:02.540]  the racist communists out there running the demonstrators and running them all
[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:05.900]  off cocktails you're not gonna hear nothing because the average person's a
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:10.380]  coward and they love this system they love being part of it they love having
[01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:14.580]  those dead kids on their soul now they're in the news saying kill kids up
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:18.380]  to age five they've got the different pediatric journals saying kill them up

[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:36.940]  born you're gonna hear anything about black kids being used for medical
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:42.420]  experiments no they get sanctioned for that just like when I was on CNN I said
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:46.420]  why don't you look into Prozac type drugs doubling and tripling quadripling
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:51.220]  suicide mass murder suicide pills what about bunch of your sponsors Eli Lilly
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:57.820]  and others ooh they cut off that third segment real quick but I'm not a hero

[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:10.220]  pesticides and the vaccines and the GMO I mean they feed GMOs different types to
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:16.020]  guinea pigs and stuff within a few months they can't even walk straight you
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:20.180]  know how tough we are how tough our liver is how tough our gallbladder is how
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:24.420]  tough our bodies are to take all this so hey you think it's a joke just get ready

[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:48.700]  skin's gonna blacken and cracks of blood by the way this all sounds scary you
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:53.660]  should be scared because there's real monsters that run this civilization and
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:57.460]  they count on you being naive and not admitting it and not knowing it well
[01:36:57.460 --> 01:37:03.380]  okay then don't believe me you eat GMO you drink fluoride water you drink high
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:10.100]  fructose corn syrup you listen to the White House regulations are saying that
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:14.140]  nobody should get sunlight period you listen to him hell next will tell you
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:19.900]  don't need oxygen you believe in this system you do whatever it says then I
[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:27.100]  don't believe a word of it look at the CNS news article from those evil racist
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:30.140]  conservatives it's always those evil racist conservatives that put out
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:34.260]  headlines like New York City 78 percent of abortions were black and Hispanic
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:45.620]  babies but you know why I don't want to kill all the black babies because I'm a
[01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:51.500]  racist cracker ass just like the some of the thugs were saying you tell Alex I'm
[01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:58.100]  coming for him you tell him I'm telling you car he's a sellout because he wants
[01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:03.060]  everybody to be free and doesn't think we should kill babies see how that works
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:10.940]  that's how sick all this is all right I said I'd get into how they carry out a
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:14.660]  civil war and how I think it would run full if we don't beat it I promise I'll
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:18.420]  do today after next hour I just need to get refocusing to write some notes it's
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:21.940]  such a heavy subject I kind of don't get into it because it takes a lot of brain
[01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:25.180]  power to fluently break down the different angles of it but I will do
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:28.620]  today after you punch me in the nose I'm gonna go back and let wild man finish
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:38.620]  in Texas and try to hurry through these calls but it's very touching to me my
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:50.620]  gosh I know personally almost everyone I know tell stories about their son their
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:53.860]  daughter their father their mother their brother their sister about a third of the
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:58.340]  time it's veterans they know good friends of theirs that could run 20 miles
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:02.700]  with a pack on their back and you know special forces you name it and then
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:06.140]  they're in a wheelchair and can't wipe their own rear end and they think it's
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:11.060]  for the vaccines because he finally builds up you take that final shot out of
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:15.420]  the hundreds they give you if you're in the military and how the military when
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:18.500]  they started saying it might be the vaccines tried to even not even give a
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:24.660]  VA treatment it's just everybody I know they're killing us but we're all
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:28.260]  isolated we're all by ourselves so so we talk about what's your line of the
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:33.740]  sand I think we're coming to it here it's medical tearing it's the sneaking
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:39.820]  creepy hand of GMO in the food in the water in the vaccines they're hitting
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:47.060]  us and laughing at us and writing books about it I think it was BBC and also a
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:55.260]  wired magazine the shot is a serviceman seated having brain surgery they kind of
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:59.100]  lean you back like in a space chair and they've got metal rods holding the
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:03.700]  brain and they've got the top of his head chopped off you know the top cone the
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:08.540]  skull and they're in his brain placing chips so he won't have PTSD anymore the
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:15.300]  article was about brain chips help the troops not be depressed headline you know
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:19.260]  troops may deserve too many tears and been given deadly drugs and vaccines you
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:23.180]  know turn into basically robots to control them to end their emotions but
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:26.420]  then buried that article and several others it's like but the really
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:31.780]  promising thing is vaccines that go in and change the chemistry of the brain
[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:37.220]  to where you don't get upset anymore there it is the military's building

[01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:59.780]  just another one about it we're talking about the end of free will here we're
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:03.340]  talking about a science fiction movie I know I just keep saying that all this
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:07.380]  other stuff is window dressing and Bella Melinda Gates are coming out with the
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:13.260]  UN with not dozens but hundreds of vaccines in corn in water melons in
[01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:20.220]  food that pollinates and will spread to other plants in the same family to where
[01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:23.580]  you cannot escape them and if you know they're publicly saying that they're
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:27.180]  already jacking with everything the reason they haven't released super hard
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:31.140]  core stuff yet that isn't soft kill is because they want to make sure it
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:36.220]  doesn't blow back on them so they're looking for the treatments or cures to
[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:40.620]  everything they're doing and I'm not trying to be doom and gloom this is
[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:47.060]  happening this is going on Wildman please continue or finish your point yeah
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:51.180]  the thing is the way I'm finding back is I'm spreading that word about info
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:56.500]  wars I became a member and signed on and then the day after you up to 20 people
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:42:07.260]  could be on your your sign on I mean with you a guy at Texas Roadhouse he
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:10.700]  blows up balloons for little kids he listens to y'all family couldn't afford
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:14.180]  it so I gave it to him too but I give it to everybody I'm giving it to over 40
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:18.900]  50 people people on the phone in other states far away and I and my wife passed

[01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:52.140]  month membership because bandwidth and infrastructure we started that site 15
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:58.780]  years ago was super expensive and sometimes we lost money because we were
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:03.900]  charging too little now bandwidth has gone down so much we can pay for the
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:11.340]  cameras the reporters and the infrastructure with a 595 membership
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:16.420]  that 20 people can use just don't use a username passcode that you have for
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:19.900]  other stuff then it's totally safe create an original username and passcode

[01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:22.180]  in the sand hey Alex well actually my lines in the sand are the usual what
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:28.540]  you'd be forced incarceration in a death camp force vaccination of murder and a
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:36.020]  needle beyond that looking at the solution for our predicament here which
[01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:40.580]  is getting worse and worse and worse down to a point where we're not going to
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:47.500]  have the the freedom left or be allowed to actually have a voice anymore and
[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:52.660]  exposing these evil doers here Alex Nicholas a few calls ago he'd actually
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:58.300]  mentioned organization and that's really the next step that we have to go to we
[01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:01.940]  have excellent broadcasters such as yourself there we have excellent
[01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:06.660]  researchers all throughout this country people who have already gone over the
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:11.900]  line put their lives in danger by exposing to the best of their ability
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:17.180]  what these these bastards are doing to not only us in this country but around
[01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:22.060]  the world we need to have a day and we have me to have days following Alex
[01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:28.180]  where we have an organization that goes national and then global of these
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:33.700]  researchers these broadcasters actually giving seminars simultaneously across
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:39.740]  the country in the cities and the towns and the out-of-doors to actually do
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:43.820]  what they've been doing and that is exposing the evil and I agree and we
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:48.540]  need people that are prominent who love liberty to help organize and fun things
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:52.340]  and create different initiatives and we need initiatives of like fact sheets
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:57.180]  that you know boil down why things are happening what we're facing we've got
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:48:03.380]  to do that I cannot do it I have maxed out what I can do maxed out funding wise
[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:08.180]  you name it I'm doing everything I can just to raise the alarm it is up to the
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:12.060]  American people the problem is so many wealthy people and successful people that
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:16.980]  don't like what's happening still don't see themselves as leaders or they're so
[01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:21.900]  selfish the globalists are good at keeping it comfortable in the areas
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:27.540]  where the wealthy are so that they never get involved and so if if wealthy and
[01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:31.060]  serious people don't start getting involved don't start their own talk
[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:35.540]  shows don't start really getting aggressive with reality and what's
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:38.580]  happening we're gonna lose everything good to hear from you Pete and Indiana
[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:43.020]  Pete you're on the air go ahead hi Alex hey listen I wanted to start off with
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:51.180]  November 22nd 1963 George Bush senior CIA claiming not to have been in Dallas
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:57.180]  for the event the big event is what they call which what they called it later on
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:02.980]  through his you know dealings and the Warren Commission how many people were
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:07.500]  advanced in their positions due to their involvement the work in mission
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:14.660]  Gerald Ford for example then you know his presidency and then Bill Clinton and
[01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:23.660]  then of course GW Bush and and and and he never he and nor Dick Cheney after
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:29.780]  serving two terms in office never showed up for the GOP convention why would that
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:38.980]  be hmm and now we're hearing signs or hearing you know the the rumor that you
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:44.060]  know Jeb Bush is going to go for 2016 that's right it's up on drugsreport.com
[01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:49.140]  conservatives moved to thwart Jeb they're really trying to push Jeb Bush
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:54.060]  Rick Perry leads in some of the major polls but conservative leaders gang up
[01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:58.740]  to block Jeb Bush say he opposes Reaganism that's actually true not that
[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:03.580]  Reagan was perfect but boy a lot better than the Bushes and just I mean another

[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:16.740]  cop really killed him in cold blood and the witnesses said that I genuinely
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:21.780]  think that the jury the grand jury would have indicted him but the story didn't
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:25.540]  add up there's there's I mean it's like Zimmerman and Trayvon I mean Zimmerman
[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:30.700]  was obviously an idiot looking for trouble but Trayvon was banging his

[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:40.820]  racist and killed him it doesn't mean that you randomly white people you know
[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:44.140]  at Wendy's need to be targeted I mean I'll assure you the average white person
[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:49.860]  that I know can't even fight their way out of a wet paper bag they're not and
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:57.100]  they're certainly not willing to kill black people I mean here's the deal if
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:04.020]  I got on TV and I talked like that they would send people after me and and I
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:07.940]  wouldn't be on air very long I just don't know how those fair con gets away
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:12.420]  with that because he does have a lot of followers and by the way Liz fair con
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:16.620]  said nice things about me so that's pretty weird he liked it when I said you
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:21.620]  try to take our guns 1776 will commence again well that's legitimate when you
[01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:24.580]  try to take a general right away from the public the government is illegitimate
[01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:31.100]  at that point and every time tries to enslave so maybe fair con really believes
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:34.740]  what he's saying and I guess he went through a lot of racism growing up in
[01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:40.380]  New York so maybe he's just mad I mean my issue is I've dealt with racist black
[01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:47.260]  people growing up in Dallas I bet money I bet money because I've read about fair
[01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:49.940]  con I didn't hear any stories about him being racially attacked when he was a
[01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:56.020]  kid I bet money Lewis fair con has not been attacked one one hundredth racially
[01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:59.860]  as much as I've been I mean sure not allowed to go in hotels or restrooms and
[01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:03.540]  that's terrible that's horrible that's much worse overall but when it comes to
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:07.460]  I'm gonna beat your head in cracker I mean I I mean I've been in a bunch of
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:11.060]  fights with racist black people that said they were attacking me for no reason
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:15.260]  but that I was 170 pounds and they were 230 pounds and they wanted to beat up a
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:23.300]  white person and I but I don't didn't just hate black people because there's
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:28.700]  racist black people out there any more than black people shouldn't blame white
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:34.980]  people for the Klan it's just so frustrating to hear Lewis fair con up
[01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:42.020]  there saying that and look I don't want violence in a revolution but it does
[01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:44.900]  come down to the point where a shooting war will start and I'll talk about it
[01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:51.220]  next hour I promise and it will cause the police not to come out of their
[01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:55.020]  police departments and it'll set up checkpoints and then that'll be the new
[01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:58.980]  way of life in America and secret police out disappearing people and it will
[01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:04.260]  corrupt the police more in response to the Civil War and then they'll bring in
[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:08.500]  the UN forces and the corporate forces and the mercenaries behind them she
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:17.180]  that's really the plan so Lewis fair con is right that you will see a complete
[01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:22.100]  hands-off attitude towards black people if black people started going after the
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:25.060]  police but see that's already going on that's why crimes so high in those
[01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:27.740]  areas because the cops don't want to respond they don't want to be called
[01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:32.220]  racist or get shot at so it'll make the black community much worse let me tell
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:35.700]  you the average cop is like a social worker they do not want to hurt black
[01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:43.820]  people or anybody else we'll be back thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live

[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:30.420]  think about talking about a civil war and how it can start how will unfold what
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:33.500]  the globalists are gonna pull what their master plan is one of their prime
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:36.060]  plans I'm gonna do that in the next segment and continue with your calls

[02:00:56.180 --> 02:01:00.940]  let's talk to Mark in New Jersey what's your line in the sand my line in the
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:06.500]  sand Alex is definitely the camp I grew up outside of the Philadelphia
[02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:12.180]  Pennsylvania in a Jewish neighborhood and I had a lot of elderly Jewish
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:21.060]  neighbors who were survivors of the death camps in in Poland and in Germany one
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:27.220]  couple my next neighbors they were in doc house and he used to always tell me he
[02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:30.620]  would tell the kids in the neighborhood we would be playing outside and he would
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:36.220]  call us over and let us know two things that we always had to remember never get
[02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:41.100]  on trains when the government tells you and when they tell you to load up on the
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:49.420]  truck never do that they said he would always say they'll tell you you know it's
[02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:53.980]  pretty much they'll tell you that taking somewhere safe or it's time to work to
[02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:59.420]  help with the war and next thing you know you're in line to get gas him and
[02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:05.380]  his wife both escaped and actually he taught me to always pray to God for
[02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:13.420]  timing apparently him and his wife when they were they were 16 in the camp guard
[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:20.260]  turned away for a second and they made it through a fence and got away well that
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:28.500]  said he also warned me the signs of what it would look like when society was
[02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:32.620]  falling back into that that rut and when I call it the right one these globalists
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:37.020]  you know it's time to this happens in every culture over and over again I
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:42.740]  mean we know I mean this is a syndrome of evil that takes place that in the
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:46.580]  Soviet Union it's happening in Venezuela and it's really because there's an
[02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:50.580]  elite appetite to round up to control people the weatherman that the trained
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:55.740]  Obama on record in court admitted they had a plan to put 50 million Americans
[02:02:55.740 --> 02:03:02.020]  in forced labor camps and kill half of us I mean it's just so diabolical people
[02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:07.540]  can't wrap their minds around it and they're not going to call them camps
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:11.940]  they're going to call them emergency centers remember that TV piece on the
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:16.580]  clergy response teams where the preacher says on NBC do what's required of you go
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:20.380]  to the facility take the shots you know go to the center they've got the
[02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:26.020]  preachers ready for this and that why would they be building these FEMA
[02:03:26.020 --> 02:03:29.180]  camps and training for this if they weren't planning something that's my
[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:35.460]  point always said that it would happen after the generation of the world were
[02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:42.100]  to people die often here we are here we are again you know there's a handful of
[02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:48.540]  them left and you know unfortunately nobody listens to them well I wouldn't
[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:51.780]  want to be a communist or Nazi survivor and see the cameras the black
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:57.260]  uniforms the spying the checkpoints again a horrible police state coming from
[02:03:57.260 --> 02:04:01.700]  the globalist but they want us to blame the police to play into a war with them
[02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:05.540]  which is self-fulfilling instead of educating the police but now with
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:09.620]  Ferguson and all this see it legitimizes the federalization and notice
[02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:14.700]  Obama is out saying we need to talk about federalization feds reaching out
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:19.860]  that we print that article you had up earlier that's that's his solution when
[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:24.540]  federalization is what helped do this in the beginning I appreciate your call

[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:45.580]  face that the Democratic Party and the establishment media is trying to cause a
[02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:49.260]  race war in this country I got stacks of reports of whites being beaten to death
[02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:53.540]  with hammers in Missouri and people being robbed women being attacked I mean

[02:07:58.340 --> 02:08:26.820]  Freedom!
[02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:33.820]  you are receiving this transmission. You are the Resistance. Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:37.820]  Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:43.820]  So President Obama is to hold meetings at the White House and then with leaders around the country,
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:48.820]  including law enforcement, headline Time Magazine, has Obama saying,
[02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:52.820]  the answer is strengthening federal ties with local law enforcement.
[02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:57.820]  Obama to discuss efforts to improve nationwide law enforcement post Ferguson.
[02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:02.820]  We see ran corporation globalization of the police in the response.
[02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:08.820]  We see the welfare state. We see the media hyping a racial response
[02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:14.820]  and shooting at the firefighters now being called legitimate by Time Magazine.
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:18.820]  The headline, rioting is legitimate.
[02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:23.820]  We see an in saying this is peaceful, this is good, beat somebody in the head with a hammer until they die because they're white.
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:25.820]  It's loving.
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:27.820]  Headline, Ferguson in defensive rioting.
[02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:31.820]  Attack a woman at Papa John's because she's white. It's legitimate.
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:34.820]  Being white is inherently evil.
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:38.820]  That'll get whites to be racist and get into their own group under the government's wings.
[02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:43.820]  And then of course the blacks are under the social welfare net under the same wings.
[02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:50.820]  And the mama bird of the new world order vomits the same poison down daily to everyone's open beaks.
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:55.820]  That's what's really happening here. I want to continue with your phone calls.
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:10:01.820]  We've got a clip of Lewis Faircombe. We're going to play again in a moment where he basically says if they kill one of us,
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:08.820]  well, if one of them starts dying, they'll want to come to the table and give us some of our own land.
[02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:12.820]  And I guess that's the nation of Islam wanting its own piece of the country.
[02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:17.820]  And down the road under UN Balkanization, you'll have a North American super union,
[02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:20.820]  but you will have like French Montreal broke off.
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:25.820]  You'll have subgroups because the globalists want mega regions to get rid of old countries
[02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:31.820]  and then break those into sub-ethnic groups under the larger continental government.
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:34.820]  This is the grand strategy of Balkanization.
[02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:37.820]  Like breaking Iraq in three parts. That's pretty much been done.
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:43.820]  Breaking Syria in two parts. That's been done. Breaking Libyan in two parts. That's been done.
[02:10:43.820 --> 02:10:47.820]  But then putting it into larger super unions, that's why they want this.
[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:49.820]  Here is the Lewis Faircon piece.
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:11:03.820]  Now as long as they kill us and go to Wendy's and have a burger and go to sleep, they're going to keep killing us.
[02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:18.820]  But when we die and they die, then soon we're going to sit at a table and talk about retired.
[02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:27.820]  We want some of this earth, but we'll tear this damn country up.
[02:11:27.820 --> 02:11:36.820]  I mean, what is Lewis Faircon thinks really going to happen if a civil war starts?
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:43.820]  He better be hiding down in the Caribbean where he is most of the time. I'll tell you that right now.
[02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:48.820]  And I don't want any fight with Lewis Faircon.
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:51.820]  We can pull the numbers. They vary, but these are well known numbers.
[02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:54.820]  Anybody can look these up from the Justice Department.
[02:11:54.820 --> 02:12:06.820]  Rural blacks in predominantly black rural areas have about the same crime rate as rural white areas.
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:11.820]  But black urban areas have the highest crime rates in the country.
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:27.820]  The undisputed Dallas, Chicago, areas in New York, Harlem, areas of LA, and the black on black crime depending on the state.
[02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:37.820]  But it's around 15 times white on black, 15 times.
[02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:42.820]  So see, why isn't Faircon talking about that?
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:47.820]  I've heard the new Black Panther Party out of Houston. We've had one of the guys on say, don't loot and kill in the black neighborhood.
[02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:52.820]  Go do it to whites. What an evil statement. How about you don't do it to anybody?
[02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:56.820]  Because we're just human beings.
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:13:06.820]  Depending on where you're at in the country, but in the urban areas, black on white crime because of that advice is 8 to 12 times higher than white on black crime.
[02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:08.820]  Just look it up.
[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:21.820]  So see, going out and killing whites actually just makes the whites scared and get more guns and then not know if somebody hates them because they're white.
[02:13:21.820 --> 02:13:24.820]  Same thing with the police.
[02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:30.820]  And so it's a self-fulfilling prophecy of killing each other. What did Bob Marley say?
[02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:35.820]  I forget the name of the song. We play it as bumper music.
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:39.820]  They want us to go on killing one another. Top ranking is the song.
[02:13:39.820 --> 02:13:43.820]  Maybe we can go out with a minute of top ranking.
[02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:46.820]  We go out to break here.
[02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:51.820]  I want human communities to excel and be successful.
[02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:59.820]  I agree with Lewis Faircon that blacks should shop in black owned stores and have their own banks and try to pool money and resources together.
[02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:09.820]  Because the black economy was so vibrant, it was outpacing white economies in many areas of the nation because what does it kill you makes you stronger.
[02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:22.820]  Segregation was evil, but the oppression, the naked open, not creeping, but naked oppression of black people in many areas of this country, it made them strong.
[02:14:22.820 --> 02:14:24.820]  Just like lifting weights makes you strong.
[02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:29.820]  If you're not lifting weights, you've got flabby muscles. We're going to wear nice suits. We're going to have nice hotels.
[02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:32.820]  We're going to have nice restaurants.
[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:40.820]  And of course, back in that day, when whites started wanting to hear jazz and go hear black music at the black clubs, they said, hey, listen, how about you get your butt out of here?
[02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:43.820]  You're not welcome here. Now that later changed.
[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:48.820]  But there was a lot of self-segregation going on as well later.
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:54.820]  Man, they brought in the great society within 10 years. Those black areas were wastelands.
[02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:58.820]  And Hurcan talks about the welfare state and not being on it.
[02:14:58.820 --> 02:15:00.820]  So a lot of people attack Louis Hurcan.
[02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:03.820]  I mean, I think a lot of what Louis Hurcan says is true and is accurate.
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:12.820]  And then he'll say horrible stuff about how these stores with these Asians and whites in your area, they're in there using you.
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:17.820]  Well, go open your store and go shop there then.
[02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:24.820]  Now, the reason I air Louis Hurcan is notice Louis Hurcan is saying the same thing Al Sharpton is saying right now, basically.
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:27.820]  Same thing MSNBC is saying. Same thing CNN is saying.
[02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:33.820]  Why would Louis Hurcan and CNN be saying that basically what's going on is legitimate?
[02:15:33.820 --> 02:15:37.820]  Why would Time Magazine, who's got it out for everybody?
[02:15:37.820 --> 02:15:43.820]  I mean, really an evil organization just flooding the world with disinformation.
[02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:50.820]  Why would they say rioting is legitimate?
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:58.820]  Well, yeah, if some pharmaceutical company puts a thing on the market that kills a million kids over 10 years and gets caught and they don't get in trouble, I'm not calling for it myself.
[02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:05.820]  But you know what? I'm going to say, hey, that's what you get if that CEO gets found, you know, not doing too well and their building gets taken out.
[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:08.820]  Because you know what? You attacked everybody.
[02:16:08.820 --> 02:16:14.820]  But running around clubbing some white guy coming out of his job at 1 a.m. in St. Louis with a hammer to death.
[02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:22.820]  Man, that's just flat out cold-blooded premeditated murder and is racially motivated and is disgusting.
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:32.820]  So you've got the whole provocateur system and you've got CNN agreeing with MSNBC and Louis Fairkind and the White House doing it.
[02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:35.820]  And I'm telling you, the whole thing is suspicious.
[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:38.820]  They want to start a civil war in this country.
[02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:48.820]  As I said back in July, two weeks before Mr. Brown was killed in Ferguson, that video is on infowars.com.
[02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:52.820]  The Pentagon is training at big facilities to take on blacks.
[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:58.820]  Where were the black leaders when we put the video out showing them training to only fight black crowds?
[02:16:58.820 --> 02:17:00.820]  Because they know the game plan.
[02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:05.820]  Stir them up, then sit in the military. Stir the people up, sit in the military.
[02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:07.820]  It's 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:11.820]  And let me tell you what civil war will look like. There's different scenarios.
[02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:15.820]  So anything I say is not going to be one-tenth as complex as the reality.
[02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:17.820]  But here's the plan.
[02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:22.820]  The National Stabilization Police Force for the United States, they've had around since the 80s,
[02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:31.820]  upmitted every year by the Rand Corporation, is the adopted federalization, globalization plan for America with checkpoints,
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:36.820]  national ID cards, no basic freedom, being disappeared by secret police.
[02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:40.820]  I mean, it is an indictment. Go read the plan.
[02:17:40.820 --> 02:17:42.820]  That's how I know all this stuff because it's written down.
[02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:46.820]  They think you're so stupid and I'm so stupid, they just admit all this.
[02:17:46.820 --> 02:17:49.820]  There's different ways they can trigger it.
[02:17:49.820 --> 02:17:53.820]  But what they're clearly going to do is open the borders, flood the country with illegals,
[02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:57.820]  give them welfare, flaunt it in everybody's face,
[02:17:57.820 --> 02:18:04.820]  simultaneously hype up police shootings of blacks, legitimize rioting and burning,
[02:18:04.820 --> 02:18:08.820]  have Democratic party groups go in and lead as provocateurs, the teams,
[02:18:08.820 --> 02:18:11.820]  but then they don't set them up and send them to jail like the FBI normally does.
[02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:15.820]  They let them do it.
[02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:19.820]  Have the NFL get involved, promote it. That starts to blow up.
[02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:22.820]  Then you start getting counterrevolution.
[02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:28.820]  Some out of work ex-con white guy goes and shoots the Mexican consulate up in Austin last Friday.
[02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:33.820]  But if there's not enough of that going, well, then the globalist outside Merck Group,
[02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:39.820]  corporate group could be ATF FBI like last time with German intelligence, blows up the federal building,
[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:43.820]  blames the guy that didn't want to go along with it as the Patsy.
[02:18:43.820 --> 02:18:45.820]  I don't want to blow up the daycare center.
[02:18:45.820 --> 02:18:50.820]  I've talked to the folks involved, talked to police, the ones they didn't kill.
[02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:55.820]  We're going to go out to break, and I'm going to come back and break down how they're going to trigger a civil war,
[02:18:55.820 --> 02:18:59.820]  why they want it, and why it's one of the only cards they've got.
[02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:04.820]  That, and I've said, New King, Chicago, and here it is, Oprah Studios, Sears Tower,
[02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:08.820]  we're targeted in terrorist truck bomb attack.
[02:19:08.820 --> 02:19:13.820]  That's just some of what's coming up in another plan to fly hijack more airplanes.
[02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:15.820]  Only one problem.
[02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:18.820]  Our own government funded the ISIS group.
[02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:21.820]  We'll be back.
[02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.820]  Break it up.
[02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:25.820]  Top Rankin.
[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:30.820]  Did you really mean what you said?
[02:19:30.820 --> 02:19:33.820]  Yeah, Farrakhan, who are you really working for?
[02:19:33.820 --> 02:19:38.820]  Or they told you, play ball, huh?
[02:19:38.820 --> 02:19:41.820]  Oh, did you mean what you said?
[02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:43.820]  Are you?
[02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:45.820]  How are you?
[02:19:45.820 --> 02:19:47.820]  We'll be right back, folks. I'm Alex Jones.

[02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:33.820]  Hey, Boomer. I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:35.820]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:37.820]  It's the cleanest best water ever.
[02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:40.820]  It's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff
[02:20:40.820 --> 02:20:42.820]  and leaves only pure, delicious water.

[02:20:57.820 --> 02:21:01.820]  Wood disaster is so powerful, it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics,
[02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:06.820]  economic meltdowns, and violent food riots, all at the same time.
[02:21:06.820 --> 02:21:09.820]  NASA has already set the countdown timer,
[02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:13.820]  and right now, the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:19.820]  Former CIA director James Woolsey says two-thirds of the U.S. population could perish.
[02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:23.820]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:26.820]  The world's economy will be wiped out. Mass riots will follow.
[02:21:26.820 --> 02:21:28.820]  Ancient diseases will reemerge.

[02:24:34.820 --> 02:24:41.820]  I walk a road, horizons change, the tournaments begun.
[02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:45.820]  Either have a system based in liberty or one based in tyranny.
[02:24:45.820 --> 02:24:50.820]  And there is no bottom to tyranny. It just gets worse and worse.
[02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:57.820]  In the courts of the Crimson King.
[02:24:57.820 --> 02:25:00.820]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment. What is your line in the sand?
[02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:04.820]  Getting back into what revolution, civil war could look like.
[02:25:04.820 --> 02:25:13.820]  They want a mindless, misdirected, pointless, easy to discredit, racially based rebellion or revolution in this country
[02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:20.820]  to trigger the revolution right as they know that public anger is cresting to divide the people.
[02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:24.820]  That's A.
[02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:29.820]  B, then if it's directed at the rank and fall police that are compartmentalized and don't know what's going on,
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:37.820]  it will then turn the police into that domestic army that sees the American people as the enemy in general.
[02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:39.820]  But that's not enough.
[02:25:39.820 --> 02:25:42.820]  You don't just want to turn the police mainly against blacks.
[02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:49.820]  You then want to carry out terrorist attacks around the United States that are either provocateur,
[02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:55.820]  but that's usually not big enough where you find some mentally ill person and wind them up to go shoot up the police department,
[02:25:55.820 --> 02:25:58.820]  a.k.a. Austin last week.
[02:25:58.820 --> 02:26:01.820]  That's usually not enough. So you need a big truck bomb.
[02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:08.820]  You need to have a federal or globalist operation do it to then demonize, talk radio, free speech,
[02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:12.820]  the Tea Party Liberty Movement that is threatening the establishment.
[02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:15.820]  We know the MO. We know what they're preparing for.
[02:26:15.820 --> 02:26:19.820]  We know while the Pentagon's been training lately to take on inner city blacks,
[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:25.820]  the real training long term is around attacking state houses.
[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:29.820]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act 2007.
[02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:31.820]  We read it on air.
[02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:35.820]  This was bipartisan. Bush was in then.
[02:26:35.820 --> 02:26:38.820]  It openly said.
[02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:44.820]  Prepared for insurrections, riots, uprisings, including by states and governors.
[02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:50.820]  They're going to announce gun confiscation, bail ins, taking money on your bank accounts.
[02:26:50.820 --> 02:26:53.820]  Let's say governors start saying, no, we're not going to do that.
[02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:55.820]  We're not going to let the TSA grow people in Texas.
[02:26:55.820 --> 02:26:57.820]  This happened three years ago.
[02:26:57.820 --> 02:27:01.820]  Obama came out and said F-16s are standing by to force an air embargo.
[02:27:01.820 --> 02:27:05.820]  No aircraft will be allowed to enter that area. Controlled airspace.
[02:27:05.820 --> 02:27:08.820]  Texas will be cut off.
[02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:12.820]  A similar naval blockade started the Civil War.
[02:27:12.820 --> 02:27:14.820]  And it came out in the Dallas Morning News.
[02:27:14.820 --> 02:27:18.820]  You can look it up that F-16s were readied.
[02:27:18.820 --> 02:27:21.820]  You're not going to let us grab the people in the state house flying them
[02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:26.820]  or having their daughters groped and all that was getting real bad to see how far they could push.
[02:27:26.820 --> 02:27:30.820]  They backed off quite a bit because it was a catalyst and we were winning.
[02:27:30.820 --> 02:27:34.820]  Drugs leading the charge and then fall wars.
[02:27:34.820 --> 02:27:38.820]  Big national story every week for years.
[02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:39.820]  The outrageous.
[02:27:39.820 --> 02:27:42.820]  Remember, they would lie and say, we don't grope kids. We don't touch you.
[02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:45.820]  We don't save naked pictures. Of course, all of it came out.
[02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:50.820]  And the lawsuits over them.
[02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:53.820]  So that's the plan.
[02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:57.820]  How do you maneuver a country of $315 million to fight with each other
[02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:01.820]  and to not come together against the banks that are running the country into the ground?
[02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:03.820]  How do you do that?
[02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:08.820]  You make the police the enemy while giving them training and orders
[02:28:08.820 --> 02:28:11.820]  that will cause people to hate the police.
[02:28:11.820 --> 02:28:16.820]  While the mainstream media runs endless reports showing bad examples of police
[02:28:16.820 --> 02:28:20.820]  and hyping it up, they don't attack anybody else in government.
[02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:22.820]  You ever notice that?
[02:28:22.820 --> 02:28:26.820]  They'll attack a politician if they don't like them, but they won't attack institutions.
[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:28.820]  They won't attack the vaccines.
[02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:30.820]  They won't attack the prison system.
[02:28:30.820 --> 02:28:31.820]  They won't attack.
[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:33.820]  But oh, you want to hate the government?
[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:39.820]  Let's hate the cops.
[02:28:39.820 --> 02:28:41.820]  And then the cops are all being hated.
[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:45.820]  So they go, fine, I'll pull them over and beat them up and forget it.
[02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:47.820]  Five years till I get out of this place anyway.
[02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:52.820]  I'm sick of it and they're getting us to fight with each other like fools.
[02:28:52.820 --> 02:28:57.820]  And that's why I harp on this, I hammer on this over and over again
[02:28:57.820 --> 02:29:02.820]  because it's their main goal.
[02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:04.820]  So they can stir up racial riots.
[02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:07.820]  They'll get that going as a rollout of the police state.
[02:29:07.820 --> 02:29:11.820]  Then they'll have some terror attacks.
[02:29:11.820 --> 02:29:17.820]  The Army War College says they believe that the Tea Party will link up with Al Qaeda.
[02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:20.820]  Now, everybody knows that the Tea Party is Islamophobic.
[02:29:20.820 --> 02:29:21.820]  That's ridiculous.
[02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:24.820]  It's like saying Superman will marry Lex Luthor.
[02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:27.820]  But they nevertheless say that in their training, so that's probably what'll happen.
[02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:35.820]  They'll vaporize a major city with a nuke and say that Colonel Such-and-Such joined ISIS secretly
[02:29:35.820 --> 02:29:38.820]  and was able to smuggle the nuke out and hit us.
[02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:40.820]  That's why everyone's got to be under surveillance now.
[02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:42.820]  And he was a Tea Party-er as well.
[02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:45.820]  He liked Ronald Reagan.
[02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:48.820]  And then Obama can come out and say, I'm not going to put up with any of this.
[02:29:48.820 --> 02:29:51.820]  I'm Lauren. I'm trying to arrest you people. Stay with us.
[02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:58.820]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:02.820]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[02:30:02.820 --> 02:30:04.820]  And I got to tell you, it's my family.
[02:30:04.820 --> 02:30:06.820]  It's all the blessings of liberty that our forebears secured.
[02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:10.820]  And it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[02:30:10.820 --> 02:30:16.820]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered
[02:30:16.820 --> 02:30:19.820]  to any of the nutraceuticals at infowarslife.com.
[02:30:19.820 --> 02:30:23.820]  I'm talking about silver bullet, loyal silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:25.820]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:29.820]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:31.820]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price,
[02:30:31.820 --> 02:30:36.820]  we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:39.820]  But if you get four bottles, we're going to give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[02:30:39.820 --> 02:30:41.820]  I don't know how long this special will run.
[02:30:41.820 --> 02:30:44.820]  But if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:49.820]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like silver bullet and others at infowarslife.com
[02:30:49.820 --> 02:30:52.820]  by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:56.820]  Again, this is Alex Jones wishing you all a blessed and happy Thanksgiving
[02:30:56.820 --> 02:30:58.820]  and thanking you all for your support of freedom.
[02:30:58.820 --> 02:31:00.820]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:31:00.820 --> 02:31:04.820]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:09.820]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:16.820]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:31:16.820 --> 02:31:22.820]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[02:31:22.820 --> 02:31:25.820]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:25.820 --> 02:31:31.820]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:38.820]  BiOPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.
[02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:41.820]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:46.820]  The ultimate value cutting-edge trailblazing game changer that also supports the InfoWars.
[02:31:46.820 --> 02:31:54.820]  Secure your DNA force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:54.820 --> 02:32:19.820]  DNA force from InfoWarslife.
[02:32:25.820 --> 02:32:31.820]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:31.820 --> 02:32:35.820]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:37.820]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:37.820 --> 02:32:42.820]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds,
[02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:45.820]  is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[02:32:45.820 --> 02:32:46.820]  But for how long?
[02:32:46.820 --> 02:32:53.820]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[02:32:53.820 --> 02:32:58.820]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:33:12.820 --> 02:33:16.820]  It's important to understand, continuing my breakdown of how they're trying to stage
[02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:20.820]  global civil war, not just here in the U.S.,
[02:33:20.820 --> 02:33:27.820]  that there are times in history where the major social engineers
[02:33:27.820 --> 02:33:31.820]  in Europe, particularly with the Rothschilds and others,
[02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:37.820]  would set up multi-decade-long plans to get a major war triggered.
[02:33:37.820 --> 02:33:44.820]  At the same time, they'd have revolutions inside the countries during those wars as well,
[02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:52.820]  and out of that crisis, consolidate the power of the state, expand it, or overthrow it sometimes.
[02:33:52.820 --> 02:33:59.820]  In fact, sometimes if you read some of the writings that are out there of things that happened hundreds of years ago,
[02:33:59.820 --> 02:34:04.820]  they wouldn't know exactly which way they'd go or which side they were going to join,
[02:34:04.820 --> 02:34:13.820]  just that they were initiating the crisis and had their people in place to capitalize from it.
[02:34:13.820 --> 02:34:18.820]  It's kind of like you'll have dolphins swirling around in circles to get a bunch of fish together
[02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:24.820]  so they can eat them, and then you get a bunch of seabirds show up and capitalize on what's already happening.
[02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:27.820]  Don't let a good crisis go to waste. This is how this stuff works,
[02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:34.820]  and people need to start thinking like that and understand the bigger picture is what I'm saying.
[02:34:34.820 --> 02:34:40.820]  So once they start a race war, set off a weapon, truck bomb a building,
[02:34:40.820 --> 02:34:49.820]  have a bunch of simultaneous gun attacks on government buildings, some real, some staged, some provocateur,
[02:34:49.820 --> 02:34:53.820]  that will cause copycats to then start attacking.
[02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:57.820]  That will put the country into a total hysteria mode,
[02:34:57.820 --> 02:35:00.820]  and then the entire apparatus that was set up to supposedly fight Al Qaeda,
[02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:08.820]  who our government now publicly runs, will be inverted onto the American people ourselves.
[02:35:08.820 --> 02:35:12.820]  So legitimize the use of the police state to fight Al Qaeda.
[02:35:12.820 --> 02:35:19.820]  The whole time it's really for the Tea Party, gun owners, libertarians, returning veterans, people that aren't criminals.
[02:35:19.820 --> 02:35:26.820]  Legitimize the use of the police state against unruly rioters who are allowed to infiltrate the protesters
[02:35:26.820 --> 02:35:32.820]  and shoot at police and firefighters and say all these horrible things and beat people to death with hammers.
[02:35:32.820 --> 02:35:36.820]  And you have the establishment media come out and legitimize it, hoping it gets out of hand,
[02:35:36.820 --> 02:35:45.820]  hoping people feel like it's morally good to go out and do this as the police stand down in Missouri and other cities.
[02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:53.820]  See? But there's not full federalization because a lot of places the cops are going and grabbing the criminals and stopping them quickly.
[02:35:53.820 --> 02:35:58.820]  Well, Obama's answer is we better federalize everybody so that doesn't happen.
[02:35:58.820 --> 02:36:03.820]  See, the globalists aren't in full control yet. They're trying to manage these crises.
[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:07.820]  They're trying to stir them up.
[02:36:07.820 --> 02:36:14.820]  But after they stage terror attacks and blame on the Liberty Movement,
[02:36:14.820 --> 02:36:19.820]  they'll then come in with Internet kill switches. They'll come in and when they have the moral high ground,
[02:36:19.820 --> 02:36:28.820]  you'll file federal lawsuits on talk show hosts and harass people and turn loose their COINTELPRO FBI informants on the media.
[02:36:28.820 --> 02:36:36.820]  This has all been announced. Media matters. It's said they infiltrate and overthrow news organizations.
[02:36:36.820 --> 02:36:45.820]  And then they'll just turn loose the hit teams to start killing the opposition.
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:51.820]  And then people will either try to flee the country.
[02:36:51.820 --> 02:37:00.820]  But chances are, see, the globalists now have their internal checkpoints where you'll be disappeared when you try to fly out of the country and try to get across the border.
[02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:10.820]  So will they let opposition flee or will that opposition stand and fight once all this kicks off?
[02:37:10.820 --> 02:37:17.820]  And it could turn if they go to this. The reason it's a very dangerous gamble and gambit is if in one city,
[02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:26.820]  the police, when they go to round up some preacher or talk show host or leader or congressman or judge and the cops go,
[02:37:26.820 --> 02:37:35.820]  we're throwing people in the backs of trucks and shooting them if they don't come out and we're throwing prominent people and I'm not doing this.
[02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:41.820]  Then they announce why the police chief and the mayor of this city are involved in insurrection. Send in the army.
[02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:47.820]  What do you think happens when the army shows up and then the army says, no, see, that's why I got to reach the police now, the military now,
[02:37:47.820 --> 02:37:51.820]  because it could backfire and does a lot of times in history.
[02:37:51.820 --> 02:37:54.820]  In fact, about half the time they try this, it fails.
[02:37:54.820 --> 02:38:01.820]  And we've been there, Jack McLean, the police officer, former cop of the year in Phoenix, found out about the new order plan,
[02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:06.820]  wrote free pamphlets for the police, tens of millions were handed out, Operation Vampire Killer 2000.
[02:38:06.820 --> 02:38:13.820]  Look what that did, explaining to police what was happening. And as they saw it happened, because most departments, it hadn't happened yet,
[02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:17.820]  it was like prophecy. Wow, this guy said decades ago, this what happened, it's now happened.
[02:38:17.820 --> 02:38:23.820]  There's the power in that we know the plan, even though it's nothing special, it's all there.
[02:38:23.820 --> 02:38:30.820]  We decompartmentalize the public and the police and others.
[02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:38.820]  The average person does not want to be part of tyranny, and they will actually then have the moral courage to say no.
[02:38:38.820 --> 02:38:45.820]  Operation Vampire Killer 2000, American police action plan for stopping world governance rule.
[02:38:45.820 --> 02:38:52.820]  Police against the new world order.
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:58.820]  He's got an updated version, I know we did a few years ago.
[02:38:58.820 --> 02:39:05.820]  An old Jackson, not in good health these days with a neurological type stuff, he's a good guy, we got to get him back on sometime.
[02:39:05.820 --> 02:39:10.820]  What were, oh he passed away, there you got to even know that. No one even told me that.
[02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:18.820]  I mean, I am in such a fog covering news that I didn't know he died. John Harmer, you told me he died?
[02:39:18.820 --> 02:39:23.820]  Why did nobody tell me this? Double check it.
[02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:28.820]  I knew he was real sick. Maybe he's alive, I don't know, they just told me that.
[02:39:28.820 --> 02:39:30.820]  There's folks here in the office saying it's true.
[02:39:30.820 --> 02:39:34.820]  It's true, why wasn't I told? When did this happen?
[02:39:34.820 --> 02:39:37.820]  I don't know, I'll find out.
[02:39:37.820 --> 02:39:42.820]  This year, it just shows, I'm like in a fog of just covering news, that's another thing.
[02:39:42.820 --> 02:39:49.820]  I'm so focused on the new world order, that's why I hate this, that I don't get to see my family hardly, I'm just busy all the time.
[02:39:49.820 --> 02:39:55.820]  And then people I've known forever, how did that information not even get to me?
[02:39:55.820 --> 02:40:05.820]  Well anyways, long story short as I keep saying, they want to create a crisis to get us all fighting with each other.
[02:40:05.820 --> 02:40:13.820]  Then they want to stage terror attacks, the globalists, the technocrats, to be blind on the liberty movement, their real enemy.
[02:40:13.820 --> 02:40:22.820]  They have Americans fighting with each other so much during that period that the public is so scared because of the riots and the terror attacks and the war.
[02:40:22.820 --> 02:40:27.820]  I mean Russia's getting ready for war, the West is moving weapons into their border trying to destabilize Russia.
[02:40:27.820 --> 02:40:32.820]  And I'm not saying Russia is not a corrupt operation, but they're not offensive.
[02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:41.820]  Our government, run by globalists, is starting a war and turning Al Qaeda under the name ISIS and IS loose all over the Middle East.
[02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:45.820]  I mean this is the craziness in China threatening war with Japan and vice versa.
[02:40:45.820 --> 02:40:59.820]  The whole world lining up for the type of stuff we saw in World War I and World War II that was riots and revolutions and assassinations and overthrows and you name it.
[02:40:59.820 --> 02:41:16.820]  And in that crisis, they will try to play the American people off against the police to militarize the police, to break the police and to have them beg for outside assistance, first federal and military, then foreign.
[02:41:16.820 --> 02:41:24.820]  And that is the plan of the Rand Corporation and Henry Kissinger and there's documents that they've given speeches and I've quoted those documents to you on air.
[02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:27.820]  This is going on. This is a real plan.
[02:41:27.820 --> 02:41:31.820]  Now are they going to implement this plan? I don't know.
[02:41:31.820 --> 02:41:41.820]  But they've implemented most of it already and so the plan is there. The plan is taking place.
[02:41:41.820 --> 02:41:47.820]  And Paul Watson now has an article with the video. Can you guys get this and get it queued up? Make sure there's no cussing.
[02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:58.820]  I want to show this guy. Black scream, kill the white people before brutal murder of Zermer Begic.
[02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:03.820]  Video shot the immediate aftermath of the murder of Bosnian immigrant. Well, he had a lot to do with slavery.
[02:42:03.820 --> 02:42:07.820]  Never had slavery over there except feudalism, white slaves.
[02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:16.820]  In St. Louis, features a local resident revealing how blacks had chanted F the white people, kill the white people before the brutal hammered attack, which took his life.
[02:42:16.820 --> 02:42:25.820]  I wonder how Time Magazine feels saying that riots are legitimate in their headline and I guess you're not going to get, you don't care.
[02:42:25.820 --> 02:42:31.820]  Well, as Farrakhan's saying, if whites don't feel safe to go out and get a hamburger, if they start dying, they'll pull up.
[02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:36.820]  Really, you think this guy from Bosnia probably doesn't even speak English. You think he'll pull up Farrakhan?
[02:42:36.820 --> 02:42:41.820]  You think he knows about black history here? You think he cares?
[02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:47.820]  Black history in Africans might as well be the other side of the planet to somebody from Bosnia.
[02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:53.820]  But don't worry, he's white and he got his head beat in.
[02:42:53.820 --> 02:43:00.820]  The video clip shows a local resident filming the scene of the distance as emergency personnel attempt to give Begic CPR.
[02:43:00.820 --> 02:43:10.820]  Arrest them all. He stayed sadding. And of course, it's a white kid right after black people running up and down the street yelling,
[02:43:10.820 --> 02:43:14.820]  after the white people, kill the white people. This is what we have. It's got a bunch of cussing.
[02:43:14.820 --> 02:43:16.820]  The video just went live on infowars.com.
[02:43:16.820 --> 02:43:21.820]  And let's show TV viewers a photo of the white sacrifices.
[02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:29.820]  You got these black communist agitator professors saying it was a ritualized murder of brown.
[02:43:29.820 --> 02:43:39.820]  I don't know if that was a ritualized murder. There was a lot of questions, but this, you kill the white people, that is a ritualized murder.
[02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:47.820]  And it's a good thing you found an immigrant, because I don't care if you're a bobble, white people or black people or Mexicans or what,
[02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:54.820]  are you rump around my truck? And you think you're going to pull me out and beat my brains out? You're going to meet something.
[02:43:54.820 --> 02:43:59.820]  Because I'm an old man. I'm not going to get out and get in the knockdown drag out.
[02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:03.820]  I'm really an old man, but I feel a little 40 compared to what I felt when I was 18.
[02:44:03.820 --> 02:44:15.820]  I'm going to, I'm going to let you talk to somebody.
[02:44:15.820 --> 02:44:24.820]  His last name is Kalishnikov. But that's why, though, you see this go on in urban areas where the general public's not armed.
[02:44:24.820 --> 02:44:29.820]  Or when you see the racial attacks of that, but every day in Austin, it's done to hippies and yuppies and trendies.
[02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:38.820]  I mean, you're walking around looking trendy and going, that's what, you know, predators are looking for.
[02:44:38.820 --> 02:44:43.820]  And there's more of the attacks coming out. And we have videos of whites and their cars being stopped.
[02:44:43.820 --> 02:44:48.820]  This is what they're trying to go on. This is a race war. This is exactly what we predicted.
[02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:53.820]  And it's so we don't come together against the tyranny. This is how they try to start the revolution.
[02:44:53.820 --> 02:45:01.820]  This is how they bring in the federalization. This is how they distract from Obama's executive rule with Obamacare open borders,
[02:45:01.820 --> 02:45:07.820]  shutting off the power plants, putting our troops under foreign control, all this outrageous stuff.
[02:45:07.820 --> 02:45:16.820]  Look at this kicking at the window. And look, that's a white guy out there as a trendy MSNB, probably a provocateur.
[02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:22.820]  I notice it's a bunch of white trendies trying to stir up the black folks, too.
[02:45:22.820 --> 02:45:26.820]  I mean, this whole urban thug culture just spread to every race and every group.
[02:45:26.820 --> 02:45:30.820]  I mean, I'm sorry, I say I wouldn't get it. I mean, let me tell you, come up here kicking my window.
[02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:35.820]  I'm going to stomp the living dead. I am so sick of thugs. It's like that police riot.
[02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:40.820]  We're trying a bunch of motorcyclists, we're cops. And it was the cop drivers, cop motorcyclists,
[02:45:40.820 --> 02:45:43.820]  trying to beat up this family and knocking their window out.
[02:45:43.820 --> 02:45:47.820]  What's going to happen with some off-duty cops flipping out in a motorcycle gang and that guy?
[02:45:47.820 --> 02:45:55.820]  I mean, you do that in Texas, you're going to get filled full of lead. I'm just sick of gang mentality.
[02:45:55.820 --> 02:46:04.820]  And yeah, as they're gang wolf mentality, wolf pack mentality in some police departments, you bet there are.
[02:46:04.820 --> 02:46:12.820]  You see a bunch of cities get burned down whenever that white kid son of a police officer begs for daddy for 15 minutes
[02:46:12.820 --> 02:46:26.820]  while they beat his brains out. Thomas Kelly. I was upset about that because it was video of it and we knew what they did.
[02:46:26.820 --> 02:46:32.820]  Has the state tried to hire a bunch of thugs? Yes. Are they trying to convert the police departments over to dangerous organizations?
[02:46:32.820 --> 02:46:37.820]  Yes. Are police departments fundamentally over time corrupt in history? Yes.
[02:46:37.820 --> 02:46:42.820]  We all know that about Mexico. Why do we debate it up here?
[02:46:42.820 --> 02:46:49.820]  The system, though, wants to scapegoat the police as the cause of all problems and it's a plan, folks.
[02:46:49.820 --> 02:46:53.820]  I know I keep repeating myself.
[02:46:53.820 --> 02:46:57.820]  Some of the articles up on infowars.com, and I'll go back to your calls.
[02:46:57.820 --> 02:47:09.820]  So we have to stop the Civil War. We have to start, stop the race war, the systems trying to start that will be followed by a staged terror attacks that they claim the right wing carried out to counter.
[02:47:09.820 --> 02:47:15.820]  In fact, they could even bomb blacks and try to get that going again and claim, you know, the new clan did it or something like that.
[02:47:15.820 --> 02:47:21.820]  They got a lot of scenarios going, but we've been predicting it. You see it unfolding.
[02:47:21.820 --> 02:47:29.820]  Black Scream killed the white people before brutal murder of Zemmer Begic.
[02:47:29.820 --> 02:47:33.820]  Gas headed below $2 a gallon in southern U.S.
[02:47:33.820 --> 02:47:38.820]  Rand Paul Slam has been gauzy covered up. That's some of the news up on infowars.com.
[02:47:38.820 --> 02:47:48.820]  Obama is spending his afternoon focusing on Ferguson. Again, make it all about racial division and all about legitimizing violence.
[02:47:48.820 --> 02:47:51.820]  Or while he calls for calm, his surrogates say it's okay.
[02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:56.820]  Instead of his real agenda, see, overall it's just a smokescreen for that.
[02:47:56.820 --> 02:48:00.820]  But it enters into the Civil War sector.
[02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:04.820]  We're going to go to your phone calls briefly, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:49:12.820 --> 02:49:17.820]  Well, they didn't tell me in this memo, so they had to put it back up for now.
[02:49:17.820 --> 02:49:19.820]  I need it in the memo.

[02:51:51.820 --> 02:52:01.820]  Have you ever heard of a Ghost 80% AR-15 rifle?
[02:52:01.820 --> 02:52:04.820]  I was over at my buddy Mark's house the other night and there he was in the shop
[02:52:04.820 --> 02:52:08.820]  working around his new toy, a Ghost 80% AR-15.
[02:52:08.820 --> 02:52:12.820]  He said he bought it from Guns80.com because they've got a great deal right now.
[02:52:12.820 --> 02:52:15.820]  And he just wanted to experience building his own firearm.
[02:52:15.820 --> 02:52:20.820]  And you know Mark, he doesn't want a lot of unnecessary red tape attached if you know what I mean.
[02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:22.820]  He said he had to pay no DROS fees.
[02:52:22.820 --> 02:52:24.820]  There was no 10-day waiting period.
[02:52:24.820 --> 02:52:26.820]  He said he can register it as a pistol if he wants.
[02:52:26.820 --> 02:52:31.820]  The best part, it's 100% legal in most states if it's completed by the owner.
[02:52:31.820 --> 02:52:34.820]  Hey, it looks like a pretty easy project to me.
[02:52:34.820 --> 02:52:38.820]  So I just went to Guns80.com myself and ordered mine.

[02:54:31.820 --> 02:54:34.820]  It's why Obama wants to make it the main focus.
[02:54:34.820 --> 02:54:37.820]  It's just so stupid.
[02:54:37.820 --> 02:54:40.820]  Then there's comments like, good, let the blacks and whites kill each other.
[02:54:40.820 --> 02:54:42.820]  Then America will belong to the Latinos.
[02:54:42.820 --> 02:54:46.820]  How about it belongs to people that want private property and prosperity and freedom
[02:54:46.820 --> 02:54:49.820]  and we unify around ideas, not what color we are.
[02:54:49.820 --> 02:54:52.820]  But see, the globalists don't want that. They want to be race, race, race, race.
[02:54:52.820 --> 02:55:01.820]  While the feds take in a record 300 and how many zeros is that?
[02:55:01.820 --> 02:55:05.820]  I can't even read that.
[02:55:05.820 --> 02:55:13.820]  Ponzi, Treasury issues one trillion in new debt in eight weeks to pay old debt.
[02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:16.820]  And the daily Treasury statement that was released Wednesday afternoon
[02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:18.820]  as Americans were preparing to celebrate Thanksgiving revealed,
[02:55:18.820 --> 02:55:23.820]  the US Treasury has been forced to issue one trillion, 400 billion,
[02:55:23.820 --> 02:55:28.820]  965 million in new debt since fiscal year 2015 started just eight weeks ago
[02:55:28.820 --> 02:55:32.820]  in order to raise the money to pay off Treasury securities that were maturing
[02:55:32.820 --> 02:55:34.820]  and to cover deficit spending by the government.
[02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:42.820]  During those eight weeks, Treasury took in 341 billion,
[02:55:42.820 --> 02:55:49.820]  591, 341 trillion.
[02:55:49.820 --> 02:55:50.820]  They're jumping in my ear.
[02:55:50.820 --> 02:55:52.820]  Can I hear you guys on air?
[02:55:52.820 --> 02:55:55.820]  It probably sounds like I'm the nuttiest guy on the planet.
[02:55:55.820 --> 02:55:58.820]  You guys keep jumping in my ear and then I'm responding back to you.
[02:55:58.820 --> 02:55:59.820]  Just overcorrection.
[02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:02.820]  I don't mind if you guys actually correct me on air.
[02:56:02.820 --> 02:56:05.820]  We've been through this a lot. Just do it on air.
[02:56:05.820 --> 02:56:08.820]  Just do it.
[02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:09.820]  It's all right.
[02:56:09.820 --> 02:56:11.820]  Go ahead and talk on air right now. Go ahead.
[02:56:11.820 --> 02:56:13.820]  Here, Nico, say hi to folks.
[02:56:13.820 --> 02:56:14.820]  Hey, everybody.
[02:56:14.820 --> 02:56:15.820]  There really are people in there.
[02:56:15.820 --> 02:56:18.820]  Folks think I'm hearing voices or something.
[02:56:18.820 --> 02:56:20.820]  What is that number? How many zeros?
[02:56:20.820 --> 02:56:26.820]  1, 100,000, 100,000 million, 10 million, 100 million.
[02:56:26.820 --> 02:56:27.820]  It's billions.
[02:56:27.820 --> 02:56:33.820]  341 billion, 591 million in revenue.
[02:56:33.820 --> 02:56:38.820]  That was a record for the period before October 1st, 25th.
[02:56:38.820 --> 02:56:41.820]  You understand? They bring in 300-something billion,
[02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:45.820]  but issue a trillion in fake debt in less time.
[02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:48.820]  It's just your tax money doesn't go to pay off debt.
[02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:50.820]  It doesn't go to run the country.
[02:56:50.820 --> 02:56:54.820]  It's just there to control you socially so that General Electric and Google
[02:56:54.820 --> 02:56:57.820]  and the other Fortune 100 are basically tax exempt
[02:56:57.820 --> 02:57:01.820]  so they can buy up everything because you can never accrue any wealth.
[02:57:01.820 --> 02:57:03.820]  It's what the death tax is about.
[02:57:03.820 --> 02:57:07.820]  It's what it's all about.
[02:57:07.820 --> 02:57:09.820]  Let's go to Clarence in Oklahoma.
[02:57:09.820 --> 02:57:11.820]  What's your line in the sand, Clarence?
[02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:15.820]  My line in the sand, Alex, was when I woke up
[02:57:15.820 --> 02:57:18.820]  and everybody knows anybody that loves liberty,
[02:57:18.820 --> 02:57:21.820]  their line in the sand is crossed as soon as they wake up and realize
[02:57:21.820 --> 02:57:24.820]  that our liberties are being taken away from us.
[02:57:24.820 --> 02:57:25.820]  No, I agree.
[02:57:25.820 --> 02:57:28.820]  But what's the line in the sand for violence?
[02:57:28.820 --> 02:57:32.820]  For violence is just like our founding fathers' defense.
[02:57:32.820 --> 02:57:34.820]  When you come to say, I'm going to take your guns
[02:57:34.820 --> 02:57:36.820]  and I'm going to forcefully take them,
[02:57:36.820 --> 02:57:40.820]  well, just like nature, every animal has the right to defend itself.
[02:57:40.820 --> 02:57:41.820]  I'm going to defend myself.
[02:57:41.820 --> 02:57:45.820]  And I think that was the key about our American Revolution,
[02:57:45.820 --> 02:57:49.820]  unlike the French Revolution, where we defended ourselves
[02:57:49.820 --> 02:57:50.820]  and then we went after them and said,
[02:57:50.820 --> 02:57:52.820]  no, you will no longer do this.
[02:57:52.820 --> 02:57:55.820]  That was the first shot heard around the world.
[02:57:55.820 --> 02:57:56.820]  That's right.
[02:57:56.820 --> 02:57:57.820]  And they were coming to take the guns.
[02:57:57.820 --> 02:57:59.820]  They've been abusing people.
[02:57:59.820 --> 02:58:00.820]  They were organized.
[02:58:00.820 --> 02:58:02.820]  They were exposing the tyranny and they won.
[02:58:02.820 --> 02:58:08.820]  But burning down black churches is not the type of group we want to join.
[02:58:08.820 --> 02:58:10.820]  That's why the government's behind this revolution.
[02:58:10.820 --> 02:58:16.820]  That's why state-run media, CNN, MSNBC, Time Magazine are pushing it.
[02:58:16.820 --> 02:58:19.820]  It's because it's all the establishment has while they rob us
[02:58:19.820 --> 02:58:22.820]  of trillions of dollars every few months.
[02:58:22.820 --> 02:58:24.820]  Trillions every few months.
[02:58:24.820 --> 02:58:26.820]  They just hope we all kill each other.
[02:58:26.820 --> 02:58:30.820]  So some Bosnian that doesn't even speak English gets his head clubbed in
[02:58:30.820 --> 02:58:34.820]  by a group of racist blacks basically following what Lewis Farrakhan told him to do.
[02:58:34.820 --> 02:58:35.820]  Overdrive coming up.
[02:58:35.820 --> 02:58:37.820]  I'm going to do a little bit more to take your calls.

[02:59:10.820 --> 02:59:15.820]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:59:15.820 --> 02:59:20.820]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:59:20.820 --> 02:59:24.820]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:59:24.820 --> 02:59:27.820]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[03:00:10.820 --> 03:00:14.820]  Fix Bayonets. We are now entering Overdrive.
[03:00:14.820 --> 03:00:19.820]  With your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:19.820 --> 03:00:23.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:23.820 --> 03:00:27.820]  Shock study. Poor kids in Baltimore have it worse than those in Nigeria.
[03:00:27.820 --> 03:00:39.820]  A global survey of 15 to 19-year-olds living in vulnerable cities show that social support and outlook are driving factors in health outcomes.
[03:00:39.820 --> 03:00:43.820]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[03:00:43.820 --> 03:00:47.820]  Let's go to Endigo from Colorado. Thanks for holding. You're on the air.
[03:00:47.820 --> 03:00:52.820]  Hey, Alex. I have a great solution I want to talk about, but I will say that the work I do...
[03:00:52.820 --> 03:00:57.820]  No need to screen the call. You're on air right now. Go ahead and give us your solution.
[03:00:57.820 --> 03:01:05.820]  Sure. Well, I came up with a concept for an app over the weekend to bypass the police state to make it irrelevant.
[03:01:05.820 --> 03:01:09.820]  I think how the best way to fight it is to make it irrelevant and to empower the militia.
[03:01:09.820 --> 03:01:17.820]  Basically, how it works is you're facing home invasion, for example, by an assailant with one single...
[03:01:17.820 --> 03:01:22.820]  Just one single assailant, then you'll say enemy hostile 01 into your phone.
[03:01:22.820 --> 03:01:27.820]  It's the voice-activated feature. App users in the area are alerted to the situation.
[03:01:27.820 --> 03:01:30.820]  They're given temporarily the GPS location of the phone.
[03:01:30.820 --> 03:01:37.820]  My pitch, I guess, is for those in the body armor and second amendment looking for dates to be a local hero
[03:01:37.820 --> 03:01:44.820]  or publicity for crowdfunding ops, you'd be glad to know that Sheepdog app will be free of charge for use.
[03:01:44.820 --> 03:01:49.820]  Basically, libertarians are always called racists and they don't help people.
[03:01:49.820 --> 03:01:56.820]  The reality is they're always itching to clean up crime and there's not really a way of organizing for that to happen.
[03:01:56.820 --> 03:02:01.820]  So there's this huge misunderstanding about what libertarians want and what they can do.
[03:02:01.820 --> 03:02:07.820]  And centralization is the huge issue if people are concerned about privacy with apps and all that.
[03:02:07.820 --> 03:02:14.820]  The NSA that they have to be worried about.
[03:02:14.820 --> 03:02:18.820]  It's very interesting. You want to write up that plan and actually try to codify it.
[03:02:18.820 --> 03:02:24.820]  Look, the system doesn't want us videotaping things because they want to be able to spin things when they need to
[03:02:24.820 --> 03:02:28.820]  and then release the video when it goes along with the official story.
[03:02:28.820 --> 03:02:34.820]  So there is a double edge to Big Brother and that's why they only want the system to have dash cams, you name it.
[03:02:34.820 --> 03:02:36.820]  Everyone should carry a camera with them.
[03:02:36.820 --> 03:02:40.820]  And now with even the cheapest smartphones having decent cameras, there's no excuse.
[03:02:40.820 --> 03:02:46.820]  And videotape an ice sunset, videotape a cool car, videotape other things.
[03:02:46.820 --> 03:02:51.820]  Get yourself in the habit of taping things so you're quick on the draw.
[03:02:51.820 --> 03:02:57.820]  Okay, let's go to Brian in Virginia. What's your line in the sand?
[03:02:57.820 --> 03:03:05.820]  My line in the sand has been very much right of self-defense.
[03:03:05.820 --> 03:03:11.820]  And all the common core stuff that's being forced upon children.
[03:03:11.820 --> 03:03:16.820]  Very, very good friend of mine. She will not put her kids in public school.
[03:03:16.820 --> 03:03:18.820]  Why? Because she thinks common core is a terrible idea.
[03:03:18.820 --> 03:03:19.820]  That's how you change it.
[03:03:19.820 --> 03:03:22.820]  You say no to the lunches, they start removing the federal lunches.
[03:03:22.820 --> 03:03:24.820]  You know, the garbage they're putting out.
[03:03:24.820 --> 03:03:27.820]  You don't like GMO? Don't buy it. There'll be a market for non-GMO.
[03:03:27.820 --> 03:03:30.820]  You don't like public schools? Get your kids out. I agree.
[03:03:30.820 --> 03:03:35.820]  If you remove your compli- a lot of the system requires compliance.
[03:03:35.820 --> 03:03:39.820]  If you don't give them compliance, say you take your money out of the bank,
[03:03:39.820 --> 03:03:44.820]  say you don't comply with things, then the system, if you nullify it,
[03:03:44.820 --> 03:03:49.820]  then the system kind of shuts down on itself and it's like, well, now what do we do?
[03:03:49.820 --> 03:03:54.820]  I agree. And tomorrow we're going to open the phones up again, interspersed with more news.
[03:03:54.820 --> 03:03:59.820]  Dealing with what's your line in the sand, but also what are solutions?
[03:03:59.820 --> 03:04:02.820]  How do we change things? Because as negative as this show sounds sometimes,
[03:04:02.820 --> 03:04:04.820]  look at how awake people are.
[03:04:04.820 --> 03:04:06.820]  Look at how this show is seen as mainstream now.
[03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:11.820]  Because people have come a long way to realize that we really are in deep straights.
[03:04:11.820 --> 03:04:15.820]  And it's not negative to admit we're in trouble. It's positive.
[03:04:15.820 --> 03:04:20.820]  That's how we hit bottom and start swimming back up to the top.
[03:04:20.820 --> 03:04:29.820]  Also, I'd like to speak with one of your reporters or somebody offline about the Stingray system and the DRT system.
[03:04:29.820 --> 03:04:32.820]  Well, do you have some intel for us on it?
[03:04:32.820 --> 03:04:34.820]  I used to work with those systems, as a matter of fact.
[03:04:34.820 --> 03:04:37.820]  Well, good. Let me give you Miquel Falen. He's been on top of that.
[03:04:37.820 --> 03:04:44.820]  John Harmon, will you get this gentleman's information and then give it to Miquel Falen, who I've called you in T-minus 5 minutes.
[03:04:44.820 --> 03:04:47.820]  Great job with the crew. Sorry, the other callers. Thanks for putting up with me today, folks.
[03:04:47.820 --> 03:04:52.820]  And I'll be back tomorrow. Lord willing, 11 a.m. Central Standard Time.
[03:04:52.820 --> 03:04:55.820]  Great job with the crew. And I want to thank all you the listeners out there.
[03:04:55.820 --> 03:05:08.820]  Don't forget biggest sale ever at Enforce.
