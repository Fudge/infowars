[00:00:05.987 --> 00:00:10.829]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:12.429]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:13.970]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.151]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:22.233]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.220]  Here we are, my friends.
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.742]  It is Friday, the 20th day of July, 2012.
[00:00:46.742 --> 00:01:10.155]  And if you look at the full spectrum of information unfolding right now, 100% chance that the mass murder committed in the suburb of Denver, Colorado, right next to Littleton and Columbine, was a false flag mind control event.
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:26.147]  Of course, my quotes are on record from back in earlier in this month when I put a review out, what, three weeks ago or so, of The Dark Knight.
[00:01:26.147 --> 00:01:38.093]  And in that, I basically break down the fact that it is a weaponized propaganda psychological warfare system with subliminals commanding people.
[00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:51.984]  To be in fear of terrorism, but also generating feelings of terror as a Hegelian dialectic event.
[00:01:51.984 --> 00:01:57.230]  Now that nine minute analysis is up at Infowars.com right now.
[00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.252]  Now yesterday,
[00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:07.491]  The makers of the film ordered the video taken down, even though we used the trailer, small clips, it's all fair use.
[00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:08.952]  We're analyzing it.
[00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:10.272]  They ordered it taken down.
[00:02:10.272 --> 00:02:14.255]  Now normally, the computers would do that instantly when a video came up.
[00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:24.322]  If it really had copyrighted material, it's already set in the YouTube systems to recognize it, and automatically your video never goes live because it says copyright claim.
[00:02:27.645 --> 00:02:33.811]  We counter-filed and the block was taken off so the video is available right now.
[00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:37.455]  Paul Watson wrote an article that was up at 6 a.m.
[00:02:37.455 --> 00:02:38.536]  Eastern this morning.
[00:02:40.748 --> 00:03:04.522]  That was the first article to predict that Bloomberg, Chuckie Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and the usual suspects would come out and call for restricting the Second Amendment further, as they've done in Chicago and New York with total bans, thus creating hellish crime waves that dwarf what happened even on a weekly basis in Denver.
[00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:08.565]  There are more deaths in Chicago every week than what just died in the suburb of Denver.
[00:03:10.504 --> 00:03:17.266]  And sure enough, those reports have all now come out as the establishment calls for it.
[00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:38.573]  ABC News, the New York Times, Bloomberg himself, Bloomberg Publication, all the usual suspects, people that want to run your life, people that want to make you defenseless, so that somebody dressed up, by the way, in a Bane outfit, that's what he was wearing, a gas mask, came in there, and of course, in so many of these shootings, they're wearing masks.
[00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:43.188]  And then they find the drug-addled suspect later, just like Sirhan.
[00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:46.631]  Sirhan, that's even mainstream news at the RFK shooter.
[00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:57.240]  The police's own report said he didn't shoot him, wasn't the same caliber, they held his hand down, and it was his, quote, security detail behind him that shot Robert F. Kennedy in the back.
[00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:01.313]  And that's London Telegraph, Associated Press, Reuters, LA Times.
[00:04:01.313 --> 00:04:02.675]  That's now admitted.
[00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:05.901]  Sirhan Sirhan's lawyers are trying to get him out of prison with that defense.
[00:04:05.901 --> 00:04:07.644]  So this stuff goes on.
[00:04:07.644 --> 00:04:09.346]  They've got drugs they can give you.
[00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:13.120]  Which make you close to 100% suggestible.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:21.048]  In fact, you've seen this in the news where they've got flowers down in South America that you can give somebody and tell them, you know, put your hand in the meat grinder.
[00:04:21.048 --> 00:04:22.449]  Drown your baby.
[00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:29.416]  In fact, I've got to get with my riders and have them explain that they've got drugs that make you, they say, 100% suggestible.
[00:04:29.416 --> 00:04:32.319]  I mean, not everybody's susceptible to this stuff.
[00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.000]  Some people have different effects with different drugs.
[00:04:34.977 --> 00:04:36.057]  But the point is, it's close to 100%.
[00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:41.280]  The military, it's declassified, uses this and then programs.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.682]  Or they just drug somebody and then tell them they did the shooting and have them all set up.
[00:04:45.682 --> 00:04:48.723]  Columbine, we know, was a false flag.
[00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:52.445]  I'd say 100% false flag, and I'll explain why on the other side.
[00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:57.547]  You see, even if this was just an organic shooter, they were mass-programmed by the culture.
[00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:01.290]  That sells all this.
[00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.811]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:09.211]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.

[00:05:32.238 --> 00:05:35.399]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:38.781]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:42.923]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:05:42.923 --> 00:05:45.664]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.

[00:08:28.553 --> 00:08:33.054]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to another worldwide edition of InfoWars.
[00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.035]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.035 --> 00:08:39.957]  It is Friday, the 20th day of July 2012.
[00:08:39.957 --> 00:08:47.219]  Charlie Daniels, who was already scheduled, country music legend, has been speaking out against the police state and the U.N.
[00:08:47.219 --> 00:08:52.761]  gun treaty, as well as Obamacare, is scheduled to be joining us coming up a little bit later in this hour.
[00:08:54.442 --> 00:09:04.333]  And normally I would just cancel guests after the big news with the Batman massacre, but he'll actually be able to obviously comment on this as well.
[00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:08.238]  Also in news, it may even be on InfoWars Nightly News tonight, but it'll be on the Sunday show.
[00:09:08.238 --> 00:09:09.479]  Dave Mustaine is here in town.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:19.848]  Staying with me while we do some research and things and so we're gonna have a big news making interview with Dave Mustaine As well coming up for you throughout the weekend.
[00:09:19.848 --> 00:09:23.591]  Okay There is so much to cover right now.
[00:09:23.591 --> 00:09:31.137]  I Don't just get on air and say something's a false flag a self-inflicted wound a staged event I
[00:09:34.329 --> 00:09:36.590]  Because not all events are staged.
[00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:44.172]  But when you have the UN Treaty set to be signed in the next week or two, Obama's not been clear.
[00:09:44.172 --> 00:09:47.073]  He said late July, early August.
[00:09:47.073 --> 00:09:51.694]  And they're talking about even if Congress doesn't ratify it, they're going to try to implement it somehow.
[00:09:51.694 --> 00:09:52.994]  It's just the right thing to do.
[00:09:52.994 --> 00:09:55.295]  Even though Congress won't do it, I'm going to implement it.
[00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:57.015]  Kind of like he's done with carbon taxes.
[00:09:57.015 --> 00:10:02.377]  There are only a couple votes shy in the Senate of being able to ratify the UN
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:10.444]  Small arms ban treaty that even Forbes admits registers all your guns and then allows for confiscation.
[00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:24.973]  I had Bob Dacey in yesterday reading from the UN and from the treaty writers of how they would implement and what it meant and saying in those documents that videos up at Infowars.com, the history of UN gun control, gun restrictions is the name of the video.
[00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:32.711]  That they say at the end, we're going to use this as an arms treaty, so it's legally binding, to go after individual firearms.
[00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:38.595]  So you've got that coming up in the next two weeks.
[00:10:38.595 --> 00:10:45.360]  Just like they were trying to pass more gun bans in 99, and then magically Columbine happens in April.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.042]  One week before the votes.
[00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:49.623]  We're talking miles from where this happened.
[00:10:51.756 --> 00:10:53.476]  You've got all the other issues.
[00:10:53.476 --> 00:10:55.637]  The guy's always wearing a mask.
[00:10:55.637 --> 00:11:00.078]  Whether it's these staged events the Russian government's been caught doing to bring in police state shootings.
[00:11:00.078 --> 00:11:06.340]  You have somebody drugged up, your people do the shooting, then they disappear, then they grab the patsy.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.160]  The patsy's drugged out of their mind.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:19.683]  Or sometimes, just like the underwear bomber was gotten on a plane by the State Department, that's C-SPAN, that's the Undersecretary of State admitting an unnamed agency told us give him a visa, even though you didn't have a passport, get him on the plane.
[00:11:22.401 --> 00:11:26.843]  We had a witness, day one, Kurt Askel, the lawyer, who saw this happen.
[00:11:26.843 --> 00:11:32.927]  And then a month after he told us here on the air, and broke that, it got confirmed.
[00:11:32.927 --> 00:11:35.668]  Underwear bomber, gotten on the plane by British intelligence.
[00:11:35.668 --> 00:11:37.889]  Head of the 7-7 bombing, a SWAT.
[00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:40.631]  On record MI6, London Telegraph, Fox News.
[00:11:40.631 --> 00:11:43.752]  Amarillo Lockheed, number three in Al-Qaeda, hanging out with the Pentagon.
[00:11:43.752 --> 00:11:45.013]  Fox News, AP, Reuters.
[00:11:47.088 --> 00:11:51.452]  My point is, is that I worked with Watson right before we went live on air.
[00:11:51.452 --> 00:12:07.747]  We're doing another article right now, breaking down the 10 points that directly link this to false flag.
[00:12:07.747 --> 00:12:08.828]  Because there's at least 10 of them.
[00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:14.149]  This is where the shadow government is based, is in and around Denver.
[00:12:14.149 --> 00:12:16.030]  They control the police there.
[00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.653]  Harrison Kleibold of Columbine reportedly got 127 bombs.
[00:12:19.653 --> 00:12:20.774]  That's CBS News.
[00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:22.595]  Look it up.
[00:12:22.595 --> 00:12:25.037]  Into the building that day, the school was half empty.
[00:12:25.037 --> 00:12:27.259]  The police stood down.
[00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:29.361]  The police didn't respond for hours.
[00:12:29.361 --> 00:12:31.783]  People reported up to four different shooters.
[00:12:31.783 --> 00:12:34.605]  They wouldn't release the tape for over a year and only released selected clips.
[00:12:34.605 --> 00:12:35.706]  I know they were wearing masks.
[00:12:36.533 --> 00:12:41.856]  They shot a video of attacking the school months before that was school-sponsored.
[00:12:41.856 --> 00:12:44.337]  Their parents were both in high-level black ops.
[00:12:44.337 --> 00:12:48.579]  They were both on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:49.740]  It all had the same MO.
[00:12:51.795 --> 00:12:53.375]  Of a black op, of a staged event.
[00:12:53.375 --> 00:13:08.039]  And remember, Sirhan Sirhan, the LAPD and the coroner said didn't shoot RFK and it did come out who shot him with his security detail, who was known CIA, who'd been assigned to the detail that day, behind him with a different caliber.
[00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:10.120]  The audio acoustics, all of it, the witnesses.
[00:13:11.482 --> 00:13:13.983]  Saran Saran was given an amnesic.
[00:13:13.983 --> 00:13:26.305]  They give you an amnesic just like Baroness Vanderloob, who supposedly firebombed the Reichstag, February 27th, 1933, to bring in martial law in Germany.
[00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:29.886]  He was found naked and drugged and didn't know if he'd set fire to the building.
[00:13:29.886 --> 00:13:33.147]  Like he was going to run around the Capitol building and set more than 14 fires in it.
[00:13:33.147 --> 00:13:35.607]  And Herman Goering, though, don't worry, caught him and stopped him.
[00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:39.108]  The big hero, who later came out and declassified documents with the one behind it.
[00:13:40.148 --> 00:13:45.534]  They just finally released the investigations that happened during Nuremberg.
[00:13:45.534 --> 00:13:48.277]  Those have been classified, but a lot of authors and researchers already knew.
[00:13:48.277 --> 00:13:50.019]  A few years ago, they released those.
[00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:54.264]  The point is, Hitler started World War II with Poland.
[00:13:54.264 --> 00:13:56.227]  Mainline textbooks just say, oh, he just attacked Poland.
[00:13:56.227 --> 00:13:59.250]  No, actually, he attacked military bases along the border.
[00:14:00.251 --> 00:14:12.620]  His own military bases dressed up prisoners as Polish troops and his German troops shot him up and then shot newsreel footage and said Poland had attacked Germany with their World War One, pre-World War One military.
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.062]  It was horse-drawn carriages and guys with swords.
[00:14:16.062 --> 00:14:17.323]  Yeah, right.
[00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:22.106]  Most powerful military in the world at that time was German military built in secret pretty much.
[00:14:22.106 --> 00:14:24.188]  Secret rearmament rolled out
[00:14:25.967 --> 00:14:35.378]  Taking Danzig and other areas that have been taken by France at the end of World War I, and then they go into Poland and split it up with Uncle Joe Stalin.
[00:14:35.378 --> 00:14:41.726]  All done by a fake news story and shooting a few real people and then saying that they had attacked.
[00:14:41.726 --> 00:14:44.469]  Okay, that's how this is done.
[00:14:44.469 --> 00:14:45.890]  But so you can have a good patsy,
[00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:54.772]  Like what you had with Giffords and Judge Roll who were investigating, we've now confirmed, Fast and Furious.
[00:14:54.772 --> 00:14:56.772]  They were going to come out bipartisan together.
[00:14:56.772 --> 00:14:58.213]  They've got to be dealt with.
[00:14:58.213 --> 00:15:07.595]  Out comes a guy who was admittedly taking hallucinogens every day for years, hanging out with weird people, and had disappeared and told people he was under mind control.
[00:15:07.595 --> 00:15:10.276]  He shows up and shoots two people.
[00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:11.836]  They try to link it to the Tea Party.
[00:15:11.836 --> 00:15:13.437]  Then it turns out he was a
[00:15:14.801 --> 00:15:25.570]  Out of his mind person who was a Democrat but that's again ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:32.535]  We're now being told by ABC and others oh he could be a Democrat or no he's Tea Party and within hours we predicted this.
[00:15:32.535 --> 00:15:38.560]  Paul Watson wrote an article this morning that's linked up on the right hand side of DrugsReport.com right now.
[00:15:42.472 --> 00:15:59.205]  Dark Knight shooting to be exploited for political grist, and then over the next few hours, AP, Reuters, CNN, Bloomberg, all of them coming out saying Obama and Romney both need to call to restrict guns.
[00:15:59.205 --> 00:16:02.908]  By the way, Romney has supported that in the past.
[00:16:02.908 --> 00:16:10.714]  Now he says he doesn't, but now they're saying maybe this will give them the political courage to restrict people's Second Amendment.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.542]  There's our article to be exploited for political grist under it.
[00:16:17.542 --> 00:16:20.764]  ABC News?
[00:16:20.764 --> 00:16:23.426]  Right underneath that.
[00:16:23.426 --> 00:16:25.467]  Already linking Tea Party.
[00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:26.949]  But backtracks now.
[00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:28.189]  Turns out he's a Democrat.
[00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.730]  Breitbart.
[00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.050]  Shooter.
[00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.451]  May be registered Democrat.
[00:16:30.451 --> 00:16:30.871]  CNN.
[00:16:30.871 --> 00:16:33.313]  Piers Morgan calls for gun control.
[00:16:33.313 --> 00:16:34.034]  Bloomberg.
[00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:37.396]  What are Obama and Romney going to do about guns?
[00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:43.961]  Not about a totally sick society.
[00:16:45.848 --> 00:16:47.768]  That we see.
[00:16:47.768 --> 00:16:49.509]  And by the way, the London Telegraph got it right.
[00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:52.309]  They had a 12-month-old baby in there.
[00:16:52.309 --> 00:16:55.930]  They had little kids in there, six-year-olds in there, four-year-olds in there.
[00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.651]  A 12-year-old got shot and killed.
[00:16:58.651 --> 00:17:02.152]  The shooter reportedly shot a baby at point-blank range.
[00:17:02.152 --> 00:17:06.653]  All of this right before the treaty that's stalling in the Senate.
[00:17:06.653 --> 00:17:09.734]  Obama's about to sign it, and now he gets to be the hero.
[00:17:09.734 --> 00:17:11.214]  And by the way, don't worry.
[00:17:12.301 --> 00:17:29.467]  Don't worry, I have a guy like, dressed up like Bane, shows up and does all this, shooting, imitates scenes from 1986 Batman comic book, where a guy in a mask like Bane shows up and shoots a bunch of people at a movie theater, and then they blame Batman.
[00:17:29.467 --> 00:17:31.848]  Oh, and see the movie's now being blamed.
[00:17:31.848 --> 00:17:34.349]  Obama leads prayer moment of silence.
[00:17:35.546 --> 00:17:38.287]  Supporters chant, four more years.
[00:17:38.287 --> 00:17:40.567]  Yes, this is the false flag rollout.
[00:17:40.567 --> 00:17:43.488]  And if you don't believe it, I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you.
[00:17:43.488 --> 00:17:55.932]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a nine and a half minute video up at InfoWars.com where I predicted Obama would do something like this.
[00:17:57.119 --> 00:17:57.780]  It's incredible.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.942]  Charlie Daniels joins us right now.
[00:17:59.942 --> 00:18:11.975]  Normally we'd be talking about the new film that he narrates that is now available at InfoWars.com, InfoWarshop.com, that Chuck Huntersey made with Charlie Daniels, country music legend.
[00:18:11.975 --> 00:18:16.020]  Behold a pale horse, and it gets into UN Agenda 21 and all this, but
[00:18:18.857 --> 00:18:30.247]  I tell you, out of the gates, even Rush Limbaugh has said before, every time they want to pass a gun control bill, two weeks before they wanted to pass an assault weapons ban again, we had the Columbine event that was really shady.
[00:18:30.247 --> 00:18:33.109]  Charlie Daniels, and we're going to skip this break, folks.
[00:18:33.109 --> 00:18:34.430]  Charlie Daniels joining us.
[00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:46.020]  Charlie, what is your initial take on the tragedy and now people seizing on it like Bloomberg and others saying, ban our guns so we'll be helpless when crazy men who think they're cartoon characters dress up and shoot people?
[00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:55.509]  Well, the whole thing is, as you well know, is that people, I have, I'm 75 years old.
[00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:58.151]  I got my first gun when I was 12 years old.
[00:18:58.151 --> 00:19:00.653]  I have owned guns all of my life.
[00:19:00.653 --> 00:19:03.215]  All the people I know have owned guns.
[00:19:03.215 --> 00:19:04.916]  My family owns guns.
[00:19:04.916 --> 00:19:06.498]  My wife owns guns.
[00:19:06.498 --> 00:19:08.439]  My neighbors owns guns.
[00:19:08.439 --> 00:19:12.783]  None of us have ever done anything, even pointed one at anybody.
[00:19:13.383 --> 00:19:17.446]  The people that do it are the problem, not the guns.
[00:19:17.446 --> 00:19:20.748]  You want to do gun control, start with the Department of Justice.
[00:19:20.748 --> 00:19:23.270]  Well, look at the guy who shot the Congresswoman and others.
[00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:27.352]  He was a big Democrat who dressed up like women, and then we got the blame for that.
[00:19:27.352 --> 00:19:29.373]  And now this guy they're saying is a Democrat.
[00:19:29.373 --> 00:19:31.575]  What is up with these Democrats going around shooting people?
[00:19:32.048 --> 00:19:32.689]  Well, I don't know.
[00:19:32.689 --> 00:19:35.252]  I can't figure out what difference it makes to a guy who's a Democrat or a Republican.
[00:19:35.252 --> 00:19:36.654]  He's a damn nut.
[00:19:36.654 --> 00:19:36.994]  I agree.
[00:19:36.994 --> 00:19:38.496]  That's the bottom line of the thing.
[00:19:38.496 --> 00:19:39.958]  He probably had no business on the street.
[00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:42.080]  He had no business with a gun.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.966]  The thing is, my gosh, man, this is just so damn racist.
[00:19:46.966 --> 00:19:48.488]  What are you going to do then?
[00:19:48.488 --> 00:19:49.890]  Give him a ban and butcher knives?
[00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:54.332]  Uh, I mean, you know, people that are violent are going to be violent.
[00:19:54.332 --> 00:19:57.354]  These people that have these guns are not supposed to have them now.
[00:19:57.354 --> 00:19:59.455]  They get them by illegal means.
[00:19:59.455 --> 00:20:02.036]  Get the illegal means taken care of.
[00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:03.677]  Do away with that.
[00:20:03.677 --> 00:20:08.980]  Get these people off the street that are selling guns to these thugs and these gang members and these crazy people.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:16.244]  Make everybody who gets a gun do the same thing that I had to do when I got mine and when I got my carry permit that I had to take.
[00:20:16.824 --> 00:20:24.706]  I had to take a written examination, I had to take a background examination, and I had to shoot the gun to prove I knew how to do it.
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:31.347]  Well, no matter what restrictions we... I'm a law-abiding citizen, you know, rather than somebody walking up somewhere on the street corner and buying a gun.
[00:20:31.347 --> 00:20:32.988]  That's where your problem is.
[00:20:32.988 --> 00:20:34.928]  Gun control is not going to stop that.
[00:20:34.928 --> 00:20:36.828]  What's wrong with law?
[00:20:36.828 --> 00:20:39.669]  The people that are causing the trouble are not the law-abiding citizens.
[00:20:41.857 --> 00:20:48.601]  Charlie Daniels is our guest and I want to get someone to hold a pale horse and obviously have you back later because all this is breaking now.
[00:20:48.601 --> 00:20:53.064]  What do you make of the fact that two weeks before Obama is set to sign the U.N.
[00:20:53.064 --> 00:21:02.831]  treaty that they don't have the votes in the Senate to get, magically this happens and magically it happens right down the street from Columbine.
[00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:09.035]  I mean this is, I'll just tell you, this stuff only seems to pop up when they can't get their restrictions of our rights passed.
[00:21:09.884 --> 00:21:12.306]  I don't know if there's any correlation there or not.
[00:21:12.306 --> 00:21:15.428]  I wouldn't want to go through saying that, you know, to say there was.
[00:21:15.428 --> 00:21:18.311]  I don't know about that, but these things that happen.
[00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:32.842]  I had a radio, we're playing in Littleton, Colorado in August, and I had a promotion interview scheduled there for this morning, and of course we can't figure out if they canceled it out, actually, because they just went through this Columbine thing not long ago.
[00:21:32.842 --> 00:21:34.824]  It's pretty fresh in their mind.
[00:21:34.824 --> 00:21:37.526]  And this thing, you know, these people,
[00:21:38.331 --> 00:21:41.134]  Get these guns by illegal means.
[00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:44.398]  The people who buy the guns illegally are no trouble.
[00:21:44.398 --> 00:21:54.470]  I would like to see a statistic done on how many crimes are committed by people who own their guns legally as opposed to the people who get their guns they're not own legally.
[00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.472]  Now this guy could have got them legally.
[00:21:56.472 --> 00:21:56.912]  I don't know.
[00:21:56.912 --> 00:21:58.955]  I just saw a picture of it pop up on TV here.
[00:21:59.855 --> 00:22:03.196]  Uh, but he's, you know, he's obviously mentally unbalanced.
[00:22:03.196 --> 00:22:08.617]  You don't go kill all these people and hurt all these people, unless you're mentally unbalanced.
[00:22:08.617 --> 00:22:10.298]  Those people are around.
[00:22:10.298 --> 00:22:11.578]  Get them out of society.
[00:22:11.578 --> 00:22:17.279]  How much trouble has that guy been in that shot Gabby, what's her name, the Senate congressman out there?
[00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:19.100]  These people need to be off the streets.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:25.647]  And the thing is you cannot, if you try to do anything to them now you're violating their civil rights.
[00:22:25.647 --> 00:22:28.931]  Look at the people we're letting walk across the line.
[00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:31.574]  We don't know who's coming across the line in Mexico.
[00:22:31.574 --> 00:22:33.056]  We have no idea.
[00:22:33.056 --> 00:22:36.720]  And yet the same people who want to control guns are not willing to control the border.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.321]  Well, Charlie, let me say this.
[00:22:38.321 --> 00:22:39.481]  I mean, I agree with you.
[00:22:39.481 --> 00:22:58.969]  If Obama would ship guns to Mexico, more than 10,000, and hand grenades you can't buy at a gun shop, and CBS and others have reported the memos that it was to blame the Second Amendment, if that's killed thousands in Mexico, hundreds here, the FBI even admits, then why wouldn't they stage something like this shooting if they would stage Fast and Furious to try to get our guns?
[00:22:59.389 --> 00:23:07.715]  Well I, you know, I'm not going there because I mean it's just like that's something you can prove and unless it is proven it's just conjecture.
[00:23:07.715 --> 00:23:09.497]  Let's stick with the facts right now.
[00:23:09.497 --> 00:23:11.638]  I've got to stick with the facts.
[00:23:11.638 --> 00:23:11.839]  Sure.
[00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:14.821]  And, you know, I mean the facts are bad enough.
[00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:22.146]  I don't, I don't discount, I do honestly think that perhaps the curious thing was done to try to
[00:23:23.675 --> 00:23:25.816]  Try to facilitate gun control in this country.
[00:23:25.816 --> 00:23:27.056]  I do believe that.
[00:23:27.056 --> 00:23:30.017]  I believe that there is a big thing afoot to do that.
[00:23:30.017 --> 00:23:32.878]  I'm going to tell you what's a fact.
[00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:40.501]  There was a time when I've called both of my Senators' offices about this United Nations situation we're getting into.
[00:23:40.501 --> 00:23:43.982]  Both of their offices claim that they are against it.
[00:23:43.982 --> 00:23:46.723]  But my problem is I don't trust them anymore.
[00:23:46.723 --> 00:23:49.304]  I don't trust either one of them when it comes down to voting.
[00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:56.719]  I mean, we had a congressman who went totally against his constituency and voted for the health care bill and didn't run again.
[00:23:56.719 --> 00:23:57.499]  He has disappeared.
[00:23:57.499 --> 00:23:59.300]  Nobody even knows where he is.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:07.546]  I mean, I guess his wife knows where he is, but he's not making any kind of public appearance because he knows that they're protecting him about that.
[00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:14.691]  What's going to happen if our senators go into a session and vote to ratify this thing?
[00:24:15.467 --> 00:24:16.728]  I mean, what are we going to do about it?
[00:24:16.728 --> 00:24:17.668]  What can we do about it?
[00:24:17.668 --> 00:24:19.629]  That's the point we've come to in this country.
[00:24:19.629 --> 00:24:22.910]  They are no longer our representatives.
[00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:31.014]  We need some people who represent us, who represent our feelings, who will call a spade a spade and jump in and say, look, this is stupid.
[00:24:31.014 --> 00:24:32.595]  Let's do something about gun control.
[00:24:32.595 --> 00:24:37.177]  Let's go into these neighborhoods where these guys are standing on the corner selling them.
[00:24:37.177 --> 00:24:38.237]  Let's go bust these guys.
[00:24:38.237 --> 00:24:39.598]  Let's take them out of society.
[00:24:39.598 --> 00:24:40.639]  Let's send them up.
[00:24:40.639 --> 00:24:42.399]  Let's get the child molesters off the street.
[00:24:42.399 --> 00:24:42.960]  Let's do this.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.480]  Let's do that.
[00:24:45.191 --> 00:24:45.671]  Yes, sir.
[00:24:45.671 --> 00:24:48.673]  Charlie Daniels, what about arresting the Attorney General?
[00:24:48.673 --> 00:24:50.473]  Or what about prosecuting him?
[00:24:50.473 --> 00:24:53.755]  I mean, what do you do when you know the Attorney General's been caught lying?
[00:24:53.755 --> 00:24:56.296]  You know they ordered the guns shipped into Mexico.
[00:24:56.296 --> 00:24:58.677]  The memos are there to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:24:58.677 --> 00:25:06.100]  What do you do when the President is a criminal and has announced that the United Nations and NATO controls our military now?
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.662]  What do you do when they put us under U.N.
[00:25:08.662 --> 00:25:10.283]  control and U.N.
[00:25:10.283 --> 00:25:17.889]  gun control treaties that even Forbes Magazine admits will allow them to register and even confiscate our guns?
[00:25:17.889 --> 00:25:24.333]  You know, like I say, the only hope we got right now is our representatives.
[00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:25.714]  They're no longer representative.
[00:25:25.714 --> 00:25:27.996]  That's the stupid part about this whole thing.
[00:25:27.996 --> 00:25:32.860]  We keep sending people to Congress and the Senate just because they bring a few dollars to our state.
[00:25:33.678 --> 00:25:36.020]  You know, because, well, they got this highway paid.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:36.721]  They did that.
[00:25:36.721 --> 00:25:37.502]  They did this.
[00:25:37.502 --> 00:25:38.242]  They did that.
[00:25:38.242 --> 00:25:41.726]  They sell us out every day.
[00:25:41.726 --> 00:25:46.250]  And until we do something about that, these people have control of our lives.
[00:25:47.395 --> 00:25:52.118]  People like Eric Holder has control of our lives.
[00:25:52.118 --> 00:25:54.960]  The man is a loose cannon.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.381]  He's dangerous.
[00:25:56.381 --> 00:26:05.306]  These people have something to do with the quality of our lives and we keep sending the same bunch of idiots back up there time after time.
[00:26:05.306 --> 00:26:06.267]  Look at California.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.082]  There's a microcosm of what's going to happen to this country.
[00:26:10.082 --> 00:26:12.523]  They keep sending the same guys to Sacramento.
[00:26:12.523 --> 00:26:15.305]  They keep getting the same dead blame results.
[00:26:15.305 --> 00:26:16.386]  The state's going broke.
[00:26:16.386 --> 00:26:20.908]  The cities are filing bankruptcy and they keep doing the same thing.
[00:26:20.908 --> 00:26:24.350]  Everybody thinks that they can keep their piece of the pie.
[00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.972]  You know, if I had my way, everybody that works would pay.
[00:26:27.972 --> 00:26:31.575]  If it was 10 cents, they would pay income tax.
[00:26:31.575 --> 00:26:33.556]  Everybody needs a dog in this fight.
[00:26:34.398 --> 00:26:37.220]  Everybody needs to understand what's going on in this country.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.061]  This country is going broke.
[00:26:39.061 --> 00:26:40.182]  This country is broke.
[00:26:40.182 --> 00:26:45.165]  This country is teetering on the edge of falling off of a very deep cliff.
[00:26:45.165 --> 00:26:48.708]  And people will not accept that until after it happens.
[00:26:48.708 --> 00:26:53.791]  And then the biggest thing you're going to hear when Obamacare comes in full blown, I didn't know it was going to be like this.
[00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:57.374]  Well, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, you know, wait and see what I'm telling you.
[00:26:58.163 --> 00:26:59.444]  It's going to be that way.
[00:26:59.444 --> 00:27:02.545]  And when the economy polls, well, why did they let this happen?
[00:27:02.545 --> 00:27:04.006]  They didn't let this happen.
[00:27:04.006 --> 00:27:05.046]  We let this happen.
[00:27:05.046 --> 00:27:08.488]  We put the way this happened by putting the wrong people in office.
[00:27:08.488 --> 00:27:11.570]  And people, whoever you vote for, go out and vote.
[00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:17.873]  But seriously, seriously, consider not yourself, but your children and your grandchildren.
[00:27:17.873 --> 00:27:22.295]  Because if we're fixing to put something on their back, they're absolutely not going to be able to dig out the money.
[00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:29.114]  Charlie Daniels, yes sir, I'm just listening to you here.
[00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:30.915]  You are absolutely on target.
[00:27:30.915 --> 00:27:34.719]  The new film that you're in exposes the UN global takeover.
[00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:36.180]  It's Behold the Pale Horse.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.783]  It's available right now at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:27:38.783 --> 00:27:41.345]  I hope people get it and get it out to people.
[00:27:41.345 --> 00:27:45.169]  They can also find it on some of the other great websites, but it's just now officially
[00:27:45.989 --> 00:28:04.520]  Coming out you were gracious to join us for about 30-45 minutes Just about a month or so ago, and it's been really great having you on with us I know you've got a run here pretty quick today But I'd like to have you back up the next few weeks to talk about the film in detail itself That's just so amazing, but just in a few minutes.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.421]  We have left Charlie.
[00:28:05.421 --> 00:28:07.342]  What can you tell people about behold a pale horse?
[00:28:09.005 --> 00:28:11.145]  Well, it's something I think people need to see.
[00:28:11.145 --> 00:28:15.226]  I mean, there's a lot that's going on below the surface here.
[00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:22.128]  The scope of what's happening is not just this country.
[00:28:22.128 --> 00:28:24.688]  The scope of what's happening is international.
[00:28:24.688 --> 00:28:28.969]  There are a lot of powerful people around the world that are involved in what's happening to us.
[00:28:28.969 --> 00:28:34.650]  The UN thing, all the things that are going on, on an international scale.
[00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:35.771]  And people need to know about it.
[00:28:35.771 --> 00:28:37.911]  The Bible says, my people perish from a lack of knowledge.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:46.004]  I think we should take this knowledge where we can find it, and the old pale horse is a good place to start.
[00:28:46.004 --> 00:28:46.604]  It certainly is.
[00:28:46.604 --> 00:28:49.646]  We're going to have to fight even harder for the Second Amendment.
[00:28:49.646 --> 00:28:59.351]  Bottom line, what do you think of them exploiting it within hours, calling for restrictions of our rights to protect ourselves from maniacs like this guy, like ghouls?
[00:28:59.351 --> 00:29:05.494]  We have Bloomberg and CNN and ABC and all of them saying that they want Obama to basically try to take our guns.
[00:29:06.152 --> 00:29:08.534]  We'll consider it as far as it's the same people.
[00:29:08.534 --> 00:29:10.015]  But let me tell you what else.
[00:29:10.015 --> 00:29:11.716]  It's the same people out here.
[00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:19.842]  I've been on my Twitter this morning, and the first thing I said was we're going to hear from the gun control people.
[00:29:19.842 --> 00:29:21.583]  They're going to start howling and they did, of course.
[00:29:22.163 --> 00:29:27.269]  But you'd be surprised at the people that are saying, you know, that are against that.
[00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:30.272]  The people that are recognizing it for what it is.
[00:29:30.272 --> 00:29:34.937]  People in this country are not that dumb, for the most part, when it comes to that.
[00:29:34.937 --> 00:29:38.340]  I know people in my part of the country are not that dumb.
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.122]  They know what this is.
[00:29:40.122 --> 00:29:40.983]  They understand what it is.
[00:29:40.983 --> 00:29:43.526]  But the same thing, it's just the same old song.
[00:29:43.626 --> 00:29:47.391]  Well it makes you want to go out and get guns knowing there's maniacs out there.
[00:29:47.391 --> 00:29:48.353]  Charlie Daniels.
[00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:50.335]  Let me say bye to you right now.
[00:29:50.335 --> 00:29:50.896]  Amazing.
[00:29:50.896 --> 00:29:52.298]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.298 --> 00:29:54.822]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.822 --> 00:29:57.485]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.684 --> 00:30:02.905]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:30:02.905 --> 00:30:04.406]  What does freedom mean to you?
[00:30:04.406 --> 00:30:05.307]  The freedom to choose?
[00:30:05.307 --> 00:30:06.268]  The freedom to vote?
[00:30:06.268 --> 00:30:07.268]  The freedom to worship?
[00:30:07.268 --> 00:30:09.490]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:14.974]  My friends at eFoodsDirect are celebrating freedom this month while helping you take control of your greatest dependency, food.

[00:31:01.377 --> 00:31:05.919]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:06.840]  Number one.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.261]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:10.261 --> 00:31:11.122]  Number two.
[00:31:11.122 --> 00:31:16.004]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:16.004 --> 00:31:16.765]  It's true.
[00:31:16.765 --> 00:31:21.307]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:21.627 --> 00:31:22.448]  Number 3.
[00:31:22.448 --> 00:31:26.031]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:26.031 --> 00:31:29.955]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:29.955 --> 00:31:30.736]  Number 4.
[00:31:30.736 --> 00:31:33.519]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:36.862]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:37.182 --> 00:31:42.106]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:42.106 --> 00:31:47.170]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:51.353]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.353 --> 00:31:53.135]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:53.135 --> 00:31:57.738]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:03.274 --> 00:32:07.237]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:07.237 --> 00:32:16.104]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:16.104 --> 00:32:20.727]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:20.727 --> 00:32:31.556]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:32.176 --> 00:32:41.679]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:41.679 --> 00:32:47.101]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:47.101 --> 00:32:54.604]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:54.604 --> 00:32:57.005]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:40.129 --> 00:33:45.536]  Obviously, we are going to open the phones up for police.
[00:33:45.536 --> 00:33:46.918]  I'd like to hear from police.
[00:33:46.918 --> 00:33:49.141]  I'd like to hear from private investigators.
[00:33:49.141 --> 00:33:56.351]  I'd like to hear from psychologists out there about the fact that we know that there is subliminal programming in movies.
[00:33:56.351 --> 00:33:57.232]  And I said that
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:14.708]  Almost a month ago, that this Dark Knight film, from the script I'd seen, which was an early script, everything I said in my spoiler was accurate, except that they changed, they shot multiple endings, and didn't have Batman die at the end of this, though he almost did.
[00:34:14.708 --> 00:34:27.314]  But as they say, the legend ends, and they hyped this up just to an incredible extent, to where when you're sitting there in these movies with grown men now, they ooh and ah, like it is the greatest moment of their life.
[00:34:28.697 --> 00:34:34.480]  They don't ooh and aah when they do good in business or raise their children well or see a new baby born.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:41.723]  The men that I've seen, it's not bad to go see a fantasy movie if it isn't laced with propaganda and if you don't suspend disbelief and believe it's real.
[00:34:41.723 --> 00:34:53.488]  The most important thing I can say is that the Daily Mail and others are reporting that witnesses thought the shooting was part of the film.
[00:34:54.758 --> 00:35:16.316]  Now imagine, there's a guy running around with a gas mask on, playing the part of Bane, in a black outfit, we're told, and there's smoke in there, to confuse people, classic PSYOP, and starts shooting people, and they think it's part of a publicity stunt, or others said they thought it was the film.
[00:35:19.648 --> 00:35:38.934]  And you see all the iconography here of the dark night, it rises, this happens at the midnight showing of the dark night, miles from Columbine, miles, right in that area, where we know the police stood down and covered up other shooters, where we know
[00:35:40.083 --> 00:35:51.930]  That both these supposed shooters, Harris and Kleibold, had parents deep inside shadow government, at the Air Force, in secret weapons development, and in mind control.
[00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.931]  Their parents were both in black ops.
[00:35:54.931 --> 00:35:55.732]  Super secret.
[00:35:55.732 --> 00:35:59.694]  The real capital, the real government, is in and around Denver and in Colorado Springs.
[00:36:02.895 --> 00:36:08.420]  The Denver Airport, the underground bases, and it keeps happening there because they control the locals.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:14.165]  You've got the gun control treaty coming up that's on a razor's edge whether it's going to pass or not in the Senate.
[00:36:14.165 --> 00:36:18.910]  You've got Obama needing this as a new campaign stunt.
[00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:23.994]  This is when this stuff happens and now a guy shows up in a mask so no one knows who it really was.
[00:36:25.089 --> 00:36:35.300]  And then they find someone, and here it is, and I said this this morning to Paul Watson, I said, I called him and I said, good job getting the first article out saying they're going to blame the Second Amendment, which they then did an hour later.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:44.871]  But I said, you watch, he's going to be connected to government operations and universities, just like Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, was in CIA programs.
[00:36:44.871 --> 00:36:46.213]  That's LA Times, by the way.
[00:36:47.918 --> 00:36:52.462]  Sirhan Sirhan, the LAPD said he didn't shoot and it was another shooter.
[00:36:52.462 --> 00:36:53.963]  And now that's come out.
[00:36:53.963 --> 00:36:55.925]  He was drugged with an amnesic.
[00:36:55.925 --> 00:36:58.167]  They can give you an amnesic and you don't know who you are.
[00:36:58.167 --> 00:37:08.135]  This is out of Yahoo News.
[00:37:08.135 --> 00:37:11.198]  Suspect was neuroscience, brain science.
[00:37:12.862 --> 00:37:18.104]  20 years ago they had chips they can put your brain in literally, well 30 years ago with rats and cockroaches.
[00:37:18.104 --> 00:37:28.188]  They could remote control rats with a brain chip and make them go to the bathroom, make them stand up on their back legs, make them go any direction they wanted.
[00:37:28.188 --> 00:37:32.490]  Suspect was neuroscience PhD student.
[00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:36.451]  Photo released.
[00:37:36.451 --> 00:37:40.533]  University of Colorado, via ABC, whatever that means.
[00:37:42.489 --> 00:37:49.412]  Colorado shooting suspect James Holmes was in the process of withdrawing from the doctorate program in neuroscience.
[00:37:49.412 --> 00:37:55.655]  Just like Kaczynski was in a doctorate program in similar areas and was in CIA mind control experiments.
[00:37:55.655 --> 00:37:56.996]  I forgot that part.
[00:37:56.996 --> 00:37:57.516]  Don't believe me?
[00:37:57.516 --> 00:37:58.337]  Just look it up, media.
[00:37:59.088 --> 00:38:05.154]  At the University of Colorado Denver, according to University Spokesman Dan Myers, Holmes began the program last year.
[00:38:05.154 --> 00:38:14.022]  This photo obtained by ABC News reportedly shows 24-year-old Holmes, Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said Holmes' apartment is booby-trapped.
[00:38:14.022 --> 00:38:14.682]  Remember in L.A.
[00:38:14.682 --> 00:38:18.486]  a few years ago, last year they blew up a house they claimed had explosives in it?
[00:38:18.486 --> 00:38:21.068]  The new thing is they just blew up the house then claim all the evidence is in there.
[00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:23.630]  A maze of flammable devices.
[00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:28.514]  It could take hours or days for authorities to disarm them.
[00:38:28.514 --> 00:38:35.899]  And again, you've got an anti-Wall Street guy, Bain, in it, who has this clash with police, who tries to bring down the, you know, the market.
[00:38:35.899 --> 00:38:36.780]  He's an evil type.
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.562]  The Joker was an evil libertarian type, so he does evil stuff.
[00:38:40.222 --> 00:38:44.624]  Of course, that guy ended up dying, probably suicide.
[00:38:44.624 --> 00:38:47.446]  You see, when I go into a movie, I am awake.
[00:38:47.446 --> 00:38:49.247]  I don't suspend disbelief.
[00:38:49.247 --> 00:38:53.089]  And when something has got subliminals and conditioning in it, I become physically nauseated.
[00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:54.190]  Paul Watson does as well.
[00:38:55.123 --> 00:38:56.925]  So it's work to go to a movie.
[00:38:56.925 --> 00:39:00.229]  When I go to a movie, I'm scanning, I'm watching, I'm seeing stuff other people aren't seeing.
[00:39:00.229 --> 00:39:02.551]  When I watch television, it's the same way.
[00:39:02.551 --> 00:39:03.452]  It's exhausting.
[00:39:03.452 --> 00:39:11.301]  It's why I don't watch television very often unless, you know, or I'll watch mindless comedies or old action movies when I'm on the treadmill or something.
[00:39:12.751 --> 00:39:22.916]  The one time I'm able to suspend disbelief is when I am on the treadmill jogging, and then I'll catch myself actually being programmed when I fall into that place.
[00:39:22.916 --> 00:39:24.697]  That's why people think about this.
[00:39:24.697 --> 00:39:26.358]  You ever see your children watching television?
[00:39:26.358 --> 00:39:32.461]  You're like, hey, hey, and they're just like... Literally, you go into a near-sleep state.
[00:39:32.461 --> 00:39:33.882]  This is a scientific fact.
[00:39:33.882 --> 00:39:34.342]  Just look it up.
[00:39:35.967 --> 00:39:40.068]  That brainwaves are lower during television watching or video games for that matter.
[00:39:40.068 --> 00:39:43.669]  In fact, you go even deeper in there because you're concentrating only on that.
[00:39:43.669 --> 00:39:47.090]  You get locked in on it.
[00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:51.631]  Almost like you get hypnotized when you know you're really attracted to a woman and you start looking into her eyes.
[00:39:51.631 --> 00:39:56.372]  She starts looking into your eyes and you start drifting in.
[00:39:56.372 --> 00:39:57.572]  It's that snake eyes.
[00:39:59.482 --> 00:40:00.723]  I don't know.
[00:40:21.534 --> 00:40:26.857]  So I was able to come out and do that, and they had the video taken down yesterday.
[00:40:26.857 --> 00:40:28.018]  We did a counterclaim.
[00:40:28.018 --> 00:40:30.599]  There's always these fake copyright claims everywhere.
[00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:32.720]  But normally, it's automated.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.822]  It happens the day your video comes out, usually right as it comes out.
[00:40:35.822 --> 00:40:43.306]  The automated bots that they run see it, and then they're automatically filed in to the system as affiliates of YouTube, and they take it down.
[00:40:45.282 --> 00:40:50.885]  They're so quick now, a lot of times your video goes live, but never actually posts, and it says copyright.
[00:40:50.885 --> 00:40:54.968]  I mean, right as your video goes up, it'll say zero views, psh, copyright, and who said it?
[00:40:54.968 --> 00:41:03.253]  I interviewed Joe Rogan, his voice has been encoded by them, and boom, BentPixel says I can't have this.
[00:41:03.253 --> 00:41:11.398]  We had to call them up, they said, yeah, that's YouTube's system, we're having to unsubscribe with them because they're not implementing it correctly.
[00:41:11.398 --> 00:41:13.880]  Not in the case with my analysis of the Dark Knight.
[00:41:14.821 --> 00:41:22.088]  It happened weeks and weeks after I put it out, the night before it came out, on the eve of it showing at midnight all across the country.
[00:41:22.088 --> 00:41:24.511]  Guys, will you put InfoWars up on screen for me?
[00:41:24.511 --> 00:41:26.353]  Thank you.
[00:41:26.353 --> 00:41:27.394]  Actually, I can do it.
[00:41:27.394 --> 00:41:28.635]  We can just show people right here.
[00:41:28.635 --> 00:41:30.036]  Thank you.
[00:41:30.036 --> 00:41:32.118]  Let me just go over this for you.
[00:41:32.118 --> 00:41:37.624]  Warner Brothers censors reviews critical of Dark Knight Rises just before release.
[00:41:39.639 --> 00:41:44.501]  That was basically an update on Aaron's article that went up at about 7 o'clock yesterday.
[00:41:44.501 --> 00:41:47.462]  Before this even happened, we pointed out we were being censored.
[00:41:47.462 --> 00:41:55.965]  Alex Jones Review has been blocked inside the United States on copyright claims filed by Warner Brothers.
[00:41:55.965 --> 00:41:59.086]  And again, that was just reposted, so they may have taken it down again.
[00:41:59.086 --> 00:42:02.487]  Bankers declare US and Europe conquered.
[00:42:02.487 --> 00:42:03.048]  Oh, I know why.
[00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:05.235]  It's not refreshed.
[00:42:05.235 --> 00:42:07.396]  I pulled up an earlier version I hadn't closed.
[00:42:07.396 --> 00:42:08.677]  That's why it said that.
[00:42:08.677 --> 00:42:09.417]  There it is.
[00:42:09.417 --> 00:42:15.399]  TSA continues to break the law, ignores court demand on naked body scanners.
[00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:21.862]  Death-obsessed culture, not gun rights to blame for Batman shooting.
[00:42:21.862 --> 00:42:25.443]  Second Amendment foe Bloomberg exploits Colorado.
[00:42:25.443 --> 00:42:29.285]  Flashback, Alex Jones predicted Dark Knight Rise would cause terror.
[00:42:32.462 --> 00:42:33.831]  And it continues.
[00:42:33.831 --> 00:42:34.375]  Horrible.
[00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:35.060]  Warner Brothers.
[00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:44.652]  Pair Dark Knight Rises with trailer of gangster shoot-up movie theater, which studio didn't take down until I complained.
[00:42:44.652 --> 00:42:46.213]  That's from Deadline Hollywood.
[00:42:46.213 --> 00:42:48.554]  See, this is all a psy-op, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:48.554 --> 00:42:51.595]  And I said this morning there are going to be copycats and they've got police.
[00:42:51.595 --> 00:42:53.795]  They've cancelled the premiere in Paris.
[00:42:53.795 --> 00:42:56.076]  They're cancelling premieres all over.
[00:42:56.076 --> 00:42:58.357]  In New York, they've got to have police guarded.
[00:42:58.357 --> 00:43:00.078]  Oh, but people said it's just a movie.
[00:43:00.078 --> 00:43:02.078]  There's no power in a movie.
[00:43:02.078 --> 00:43:03.999]  Alex, it's not conditioning anybody.
[00:43:04.699 --> 00:43:07.680]  Folks, I know brainwashing when I see it.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:15.642]  Your subconscious mind, you can debate, is hundreds, some say even a thousand times more powerful.
[00:43:15.642 --> 00:43:22.263]  Intuition is just the mega-computer that is your electrochemical brain that can pick up on things.
[00:43:22.263 --> 00:43:22.603]  Okay?
[00:43:22.603 --> 00:43:23.504]  It's called the gut.
[00:43:23.504 --> 00:43:24.584]  It's really the supercomputer.
[00:43:27.657 --> 00:43:29.158]  But that's where your adrenals are based.
[00:43:29.158 --> 00:43:33.260]  So when your brain's worried about something, you feel it in your stomach, you feel it in your spine.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:39.103]  Because your brain continues down through your spine and into the ganglia in your stomach.
[00:43:40.677 --> 00:43:42.598]  The brain is system-wide.
[00:43:42.598 --> 00:43:46.039]  It's like brachiosaurus had a brain in its head and a brain in its back.
[00:43:46.039 --> 00:43:50.820]  It's really, we've got, the brain is our nerve endings throughout our body.
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:56.742]  Your eyes are brain nerve stocks that grew out during embryonic development.
[00:43:56.742 --> 00:43:59.783]  Your brain is hooked into everything in your body.
[00:43:59.783 --> 00:44:04.265]  That's why you get a tingle when you know something's dangerous, something's bad, or you don't trust somebody.
[00:44:05.871 --> 00:44:09.995]  So I've got my supercomputer aimed at this trailers and I just said, that's it.
[00:44:09.995 --> 00:44:11.176]  It's Occupy Wall Street.
[00:44:11.176 --> 00:44:12.517]  It's going to try to cause riots.
[00:44:12.517 --> 00:44:16.220]  It's going to try to demonize people that protest tyranny.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.663]  By the way, we shot like 35 minutes to cut it down to nine minutes.
[00:44:19.663 --> 00:44:21.705]  People say, oh, Alex ought to have a better teleprompter.
[00:44:21.705 --> 00:44:23.006]  Alex ought to have better writers.
[00:44:23.006 --> 00:44:25.889]  This is right out of my mind and research.
[00:44:25.889 --> 00:44:31.454]  You know what Rob Jacobson who put together our Dark Knight, Secrets of Dark Knight leaked piece?
[00:44:32.864 --> 00:44:40.627]  He's back there right now because I said it's probably going to stage mass shootings and it's going to be a prelude to real terror attacks.
[00:44:40.627 --> 00:44:44.589]  And then he kind of gauged it himself and didn't put that in there.
[00:44:44.589 --> 00:44:46.790]  And at the time I said, why didn't you put it in there?
[00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:47.970]  And he goes, well, what if it doesn't happen?
[00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.111]  And I said, look, you've got to count on me.
[00:44:50.111 --> 00:44:51.472]  Put it out.
[00:44:51.472 --> 00:44:53.833]  Just like I said, machete would cause machete attacks.
[00:44:53.833 --> 00:44:57.114]  It actually caused more than 10, but they were kept very quiet in the news.
[00:44:59.022 --> 00:45:02.945]  There were racial attacks out in Southern California that day and the day after.
[00:45:02.945 --> 00:45:17.915]  But, listen, the issue here is, ladies and gentlemen, is that he's back there right now, not just getting the predictions I made, but he's back there right now going and getting, you know, the clips we didn't use to show you.
[00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:20.136]  But the point is, they're about to pass the U.N.
[00:45:20.136 --> 00:45:21.537]  treaty.
[00:45:21.537 --> 00:45:23.479]  It's on the razor's edge if they can get it or not.
[00:45:24.489 --> 00:45:30.273]  All of this is, the whole world is a stage and they're mass programming people.
[00:45:30.273 --> 00:45:35.596]  They had a Batman comic where a Bane character shoots up a movie theater and blames it on Batman in 85.
[00:45:35.596 --> 00:45:37.037]  That's up at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:45:40.842 --> 00:45:48.905]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, it happened right next to Columbine, which, if I had to go over that, they brought in 127 propane bombs.
[00:45:48.905 --> 00:45:49.826]  Everybody stood down.
[00:45:49.826 --> 00:45:51.066]  The police were told to stand down.
[00:45:51.066 --> 00:45:52.347]  Half the school was empty.
[00:45:52.347 --> 00:45:54.148]  None of the cops' kids were there that day.
[00:45:54.148 --> 00:45:55.748]  People were told, don't go to school that day.
[00:45:55.748 --> 00:45:59.670]  Harrison Kleibold had made a movie how they were going to kill everybody, sponsored by the school.
[00:46:00.879 --> 00:46:04.001]  That's how they got him to come take part of the drill they thought they were taking part of.
[00:46:04.001 --> 00:46:05.142]  There were other shooters.
[00:46:05.142 --> 00:46:07.844]  It was confirmed the SWAT team shot at least two of the kids.
[00:46:07.844 --> 00:46:10.686]  That's Rocky Mountain News, now defunct.
[00:46:10.686 --> 00:46:13.348]  All of, I have the editor on about this.
[00:46:13.348 --> 00:46:16.010]  This whole, that was a setup.
[00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:22.014]  Columbine was a setup to pass a bunch of gun control legislation, but it failed 12 years ago, 1999, on Hitler's birthday.
[00:46:26.195 --> 00:46:38.005]  Now it's happened again with a guy in a advanced Department of Defense, because that's who, I went and looked it up, that's who funds this program at Denver there, Neuroscience Brain Interface.
[00:46:38.005 --> 00:46:47.173]  Theodore Kaczynski was in MKUltra, a volunteer in a PhD program similar to that at Berkeley.
[00:46:47.173 --> 00:46:47.914]  Look it up!
[00:46:49.787 --> 00:46:51.368]  Was it Berkeley or was it Princeton?
[00:46:51.368 --> 00:46:53.429]  Look it up, LA Times.
[00:46:53.429 --> 00:46:55.290]  I've seen this before.
[00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:57.572]  I know what it looks like.
[00:46:57.572 --> 00:47:00.513]  And my gut says, staged.
[00:47:00.513 --> 00:47:00.914]  Staged.
[00:47:00.914 --> 00:47:02.835]  My gut is 100%.
[00:47:02.835 --> 00:47:03.936]  Staged.
[00:47:03.936 --> 00:47:04.816]  Staged.
[00:47:04.816 --> 00:47:05.977]  There it is, Washington Times.
[00:47:05.977 --> 00:47:06.437]  The U.N.
[00:47:06.437 --> 00:47:12.181]  is coming for your guns on the heels of all of this.
[00:47:12.181 --> 00:47:14.582]  God help us.
[00:47:14.582 --> 00:47:15.843]  God help us.
[00:47:17.898 --> 00:47:20.182]  Coming up when I start the next hour, I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[00:47:20.182 --> 00:47:22.606]  I'm going to hear from police, psychologists, military.
[00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:24.109]  I mean, do you disagree with me?
[00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.169]  800-259-9231.
[00:47:24.169 --> 00:47:24.209]  800-259-9231.
[00:47:32.878 --> 00:47:36.140]  Let's go to a few clips from the nine and a half minute video I put out.
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.820]  Secrets of the Dark Knight leaked.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:39.841]  It's now a flashback at Infowars.com.
[00:47:39.841 --> 00:47:43.683]  Flashback Alex Jones predicted Dark Knight Rise would cause terror.
[00:47:43.683 --> 00:47:47.625]  I want to give a most valuable player in the fight for liberty award to Watson.
[00:47:47.625 --> 00:47:52.347]  He's already written like four articles a day and is in there like a literal Hydra of resistance against tyranny.
[00:47:52.347 --> 00:48:00.431]  He's pulling out a bunch of my quotes predicting this.
[00:48:00.431 --> 00:48:01.191]  Let's go ahead.
[00:48:03.066 --> 00:48:08.268]  Let's go ahead and go to the first of the leaked Dark Knight Rises.
[00:48:08.268 --> 00:48:18.251]  Here it is.
[00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:22.713]  One of the most anticipated movies in a long time is about to come out.
[00:48:22.713 --> 00:48:24.813]  The Dark Knight Rises.
[00:48:24.813 --> 00:48:32.376]  Get ready because we are going to leak, spoil, and decode the new Batman film that's coming out.
[00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:41.293]  We're gonna get into the meaning behind the meaning, the secrets behind the secrets.
[00:48:41.293 --> 00:48:48.698]  But first understand, this is one of the most successful propaganda franchises out there selling tyranny.
[00:48:49.912 --> 00:49:00.356]  For all of you that say it's just a movie, for more than 50 years the Department of Defense has paid and financed for most major action films.
[00:49:00.356 --> 00:49:08.200]  They all have a unified propaganda message, selling you on the idea that you're powerless.
[00:49:09.147 --> 00:49:17.311]  And that you can't protect yourself, only shadowy groups, by violating your rights and liberties, can keep you safe.
[00:49:17.311 --> 00:49:29.577]  Throughout the Batman franchise, any vigilantes, other than Batman, are powerless, pathetic, fat, stupid, or psychopathic.
[00:49:29.577 --> 00:49:35.940]  To understand the conclusion of the Dark Knight series, we first have to go back to the beginning.
[00:49:37.273 --> 00:49:56.451]  In Batman Begins, a secret society known as the League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul, played by Liam Neeson, seeks to put a poisonous psychotropic drug in the water supply to drive Gotham, the archetypal New York, into total insanity.
[00:49:56.451 --> 00:49:59.974]  Then he will bring order out of the chaos.
[00:49:59.974 --> 00:50:01.455]  And as all informed people know,
[00:50:02.461 --> 00:50:08.423]  Governments have been fluoridating water supplies for more than 60 years, causing brain damage and cancer.
[00:50:08.423 --> 00:50:10.904]  Alright, so we see here in the first... Now that's just the intro.
[00:50:10.904 --> 00:50:20.767]  When we come back, I'm gonna get to the real meat of it, where I talk about how it's a psychological assault to create the fear of terrorism, and how people are paralyzed in their movie seats, being assaulted.
[00:50:20.767 --> 00:50:29.170]  And literally, they sat there, paralyzed as he went around shooting people, or whatever really happened, thinking that it was part of the movie.
[00:50:30.356 --> 00:50:32.116]  Or not wanting to have their treat.
[00:50:32.116 --> 00:50:36.358]  Oh my gosh, this is so special to be here for this big event.
[00:50:36.358 --> 00:50:43.099]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this has PSYOP written up one side and down the other, and it's right in a key globalist corridor.
[00:50:43.099 --> 00:50:48.621]  Remember, if they'd staged Fast and Furious to get your guns, would they stage this?
[00:50:48.621 --> 00:50:52.942]  Have they grabbed a mental patient who they had in the psych warfare program, drugged up,
[00:50:54.244 --> 00:50:56.444]  Who's now been part of that program to take the fall?
[00:50:56.444 --> 00:50:59.985]  I mean, you couldn't write a script this good.
[00:50:59.985 --> 00:51:01.925]  This is... Oh, man.
[00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:07.106]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:51:07.106 --> 00:51:16.448]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over six years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.

[00:53:55.117 --> 00:54:14.855]  Now we've got to have police inside of all the movie theaters.
[00:54:14.855 --> 00:54:18.499]  Now we've got to have metal detectors at the malls and body scanners.
[00:54:18.499 --> 00:54:20.821]  You know, the government and Homeland Security has been calling for that.
[00:54:22.523 --> 00:54:27.567]  Because, you know, you're not even safe going to see a Batman movie.
[00:54:27.567 --> 00:54:30.930]  Nobody is safe.
[00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:34.774]  Unless the government's there to keep us safe and take all of our rights away.
[00:54:36.755 --> 00:54:39.056]  The total free number to join us, and we'll just open it up to everybody.
[00:54:39.056 --> 00:54:41.516]  I just want to hear from psychologists, police, military.
[00:54:41.516 --> 00:54:46.577]  I mean, does anybody buy this, that it's right outside Columbine High School again?
[00:54:46.577 --> 00:54:49.578]  I mean, just miles from it.
[00:54:49.578 --> 00:54:57.020]  That it's a week and a half, two weeks out from Obama saying he's going to sign the treaty, but they've only got a few votes they need in the Senate to restrict our guns.
[00:54:58.137 --> 00:55:00.519]  I mean, does anybody doubt what's happening?
[00:55:00.519 --> 00:55:12.628]  And then it's a guy in a mask who's in a government-funded, at the University of Denver, brain interface neuroscience PhD student.
[00:55:12.628 --> 00:55:16.190]  I mean, it's always the same.
[00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:18.652]  It's always the same.
[00:55:18.652 --> 00:55:19.873]  There's no end to any of this.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:26.921]  I mean, I remember telling Watson this morning, I said, you watch, he's going to be connected to some government program like Harrison Kleibold.
[00:55:26.921 --> 00:55:31.403]  I mean, why does it always have to be the same thing?
[00:55:31.403 --> 00:55:37.964]  I mean, Jared Lee Loeffner, I didn't want to believe that was an inside job, and now we've talked to the federal informants.
[00:55:37.964 --> 00:55:40.225]  It's come out they were investigating Fast and Furious.
[00:55:40.225 --> 00:55:47.367]  I mean, who wants to believe they ship almost 20,000 guns and hand grenades to Mexico, and the memos come out that they were going to blame the Second Amendment with it.
[00:55:47.367 --> 00:55:48.147]  They got caught!
[00:55:48.147 --> 00:55:51.128]  They drug somebody up,
[00:55:52.554 --> 00:56:01.001]  Who mom ain't seen in weeks and has disappeared and is dropping out, who's in a government-funded mind control program.
[00:56:01.001 --> 00:56:03.283]  They have the real shooters go in and do it.
[00:56:03.283 --> 00:56:05.005]  They said there were multiple shooters.
[00:56:05.005 --> 00:56:08.688]  People don't even know, you know, that it's real because they're so mind-controlled.
[00:56:08.688 --> 00:56:15.293]  Again, that's the mind control of just movies, that they're sitting there watching and thinking it's the movie so glued to it.
[00:56:15.293 --> 00:56:19.157]  Because those of us that are conscious and aren't set to go into suspended disbelief,
[00:56:20.745 --> 00:56:25.708]  We look at other people that are zombies watching television, and it's like, hey, hey Bob!
[00:56:25.708 --> 00:56:28.490]  And he's watching the football game, let's go get some more beer or whatever.
[00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:32.252]  And they're like, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[00:56:32.252 --> 00:56:33.613]  That's what it's like!
[00:56:33.613 --> 00:56:36.574]  But this is even deeper with drugs.
[00:56:36.574 --> 00:56:39.836]  It's a standard MO.
[00:56:39.836 --> 00:56:47.541]  At the Reichstag, at some of the Russian events, at other events, is that you have the drugged up patsy, like Sirhan Sirhan, RFK shooting,
[00:56:49.537 --> 00:56:51.559]  This is exactly what I thought would come out of it.
[00:56:51.559 --> 00:57:07.610]  I knew the way they were hyping it with the police and the military and terrorism and just watching it, that this is a major rollout for PSYOP, probably for staged terror attacks and other things to start unfolding.
[00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:09.912]  Definitely more shootings at movie theaters.
[00:57:09.912 --> 00:57:13.535]  And then again, oh, I'm scared to go to the movie theater, even though statistically
[00:57:14.462 --> 00:57:18.884]  You know, you've got a better chance of being run over today driving down the highway, or you've got a better chance of being struck by lightning.
[00:57:18.884 --> 00:57:21.585]  Still, it's there, it's happening.
[00:57:21.585 --> 00:57:24.966]  Gotta have police, gotta have TSA style at the prom.
[00:57:24.966 --> 00:57:29.687]  You know, they've got TSA at proms in New Mexico because terrorists might strike.
[00:57:29.687 --> 00:57:30.848]  And the new terrorists are...
[00:57:32.185 --> 00:57:32.845]  White males!
[00:57:32.845 --> 00:57:34.206]  We've seen that rolled out.
[00:57:34.206 --> 00:57:34.926]  You know, the branding.
[00:57:34.926 --> 00:57:36.747]  It's not Al Qaeda now, it's the white male.
[00:57:36.747 --> 00:57:39.629]  And here it is, and it's all part of this fantasy land.
[00:57:39.629 --> 00:57:45.272]  And even if he wasn't an official mind control victim, he's somebody in neurosciences.
[00:57:45.272 --> 00:57:50.354]  I mean, anybody tells you some of those psychiatrists and people are the nuttiest folks around.
[00:57:50.354 --> 00:57:52.695]  Got nuts running the insane asylum.
[00:57:52.695 --> 00:57:54.396]  Got the inmates running the asylum.
[00:57:54.396 --> 00:57:55.497]  Literally.
[00:57:55.497 --> 00:58:00.339]  I'll bet your bottom dollar, even if he is under mind control, which he probably is, that he's on Prozac-type drugs.
[00:58:00.339 --> 00:58:01.460]  Watch, that's going to come out later.
[00:58:03.135 --> 00:58:07.236]  And... I mean, it just fits the standard MO 110%.
[00:58:07.236 --> 00:58:13.538]  It's the same story with John Lennon.
[00:58:13.538 --> 00:58:18.499]  Oh, if I could tell you the stuff I knew about John Lennon.
[00:58:18.499 --> 00:58:23.560]  I think I'll just shut up right there.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:26.241]  John Lennon was killed by a mind control assassin.
[00:58:26.241 --> 00:58:27.001]  Okay?
[00:58:27.001 --> 00:58:30.962]  And I've talked to people, not just the evidence that proves it on the surface, I mean, I've talked to people
[00:58:33.527 --> 00:58:34.148]  That we're there.
[00:58:34.148 --> 00:58:36.011]  Okay, I'm gonna shut up right there.
[00:58:36.011 --> 00:58:37.954]  I'm gonna shut up right there.
[00:58:37.954 --> 00:58:38.795]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:58:38.795 --> 00:58:44.304]  Stay with us.
[00:58:44.304 --> 00:58:48.270]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.653 --> 00:58:57.157]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:58:57.157 --> 00:58:59.559]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:58:59.559 --> 00:59:08.665]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:08.665 --> 00:59:12.128]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:59:12.128 --> 00:59:13.789]  There's no priming required.
[00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:16.071]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[00:59:16.071 --> 00:59:17.772]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce
[00:59:17.912 --> 00:59:18.552]  We're good to go.
[00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:48.112]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[00:59:48.112 --> 00:59:49.274]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:49.274 --> 00:59:50.416]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.383 --> 01:00:11.206]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.206 --> 01:00:12.787]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.787 --> 01:00:14.349]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:18.531]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:24.155]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.155 --> 01:00:28.258]  Well, they've got calls to put naked body scanners in the shopping malls.
[01:00:28.258 --> 01:00:35.003]  Because there might be a shooter, even though Kurt Nemo just posted an article breaking down the statistics.
[01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:41.036]  Something to keep in mind is hysterical gun grabbers attack the Second Amendment.
[01:00:41.036 --> 01:00:48.283]  You've got a better chance of being run over by a out-of-control pumpkin truck than you do.
[01:00:48.283 --> 01:00:49.524]  I'm gonna go over this a little bit later.
[01:00:49.524 --> 01:00:53.368]  If you just joined us, ladies and gentlemen, this is totally staged.
[01:00:54.591 --> 01:00:56.832]  It's just, it's a no-brainer.
[01:00:56.832 --> 01:01:06.936]  You add all of it together in the end, the tragic shooting, the 14 dead now they're saying, baby shot at point-blank range, Bloomberg within hours saying, turn in your guns.
[01:01:06.936 --> 01:01:10.677]  But he's gonna hire some more government people with guns to keep you safe.
[01:01:10.677 --> 01:01:11.637]  It's just disgusting.
[01:01:11.637 --> 01:01:12.678]  And now we're not talking about
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:27.388]  The implosion in Europe financially, we're not talking about Fast and Furious, or Obama rolling out the Hugo Chavez talk saying that if you own a business you didn't do it, it belongs to the state.
[01:01:27.388 --> 01:01:35.953]  Now we're all busy sitting here talking about this shooting and there's the calls by the New York Times.
[01:01:35.953 --> 01:01:36.993]  Do something Romney!
[01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.134]  Do something Obama!
[01:01:38.134 --> 01:01:40.495]  Restrict those guns!
[01:01:40.495 --> 01:01:44.198]  So we can live in crime infested areas like Chicago and New York where they have banned them.
[01:01:45.066 --> 01:01:45.326]  Hello, Alex.
[01:01:45.326 --> 01:01:48.388]  You know, back in the 30s and 40s, Hollywood was riddled with communists.
[01:01:48.388 --> 01:01:50.950]  By the early 50s, they'd pretty much driven them all out.
[01:02:09.485 --> 01:02:17.593]  But in the early 60s, they all filtered back in again, and that's when we started seeing the glorification of drugs, the glorification of sex, the glorification of violence.
[01:02:17.593 --> 01:02:23.659]  And as each century has gone by, it's gotten to the extreme now, where it's Katy barred the door, they can show anything.
[01:02:23.659 --> 01:02:28.023]  And one guy wrote a while back, and he said that, what we call,
[01:02:28.556 --> 01:02:29.556]  We all know Alex, that
[01:02:54.008 --> 01:03:05.875]  You look at the communist goals, communist rules for revolution, they said get control of the media and steer it to where we're at now, where they can use an excuse to keep more and more control over us.
[01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:17.923]  And this guy may be a part of a plan, or he could just be a typical kook on the street caused by our culture, but either way they're using us to push the communist goals, to disarm us, to put us into a world government.
[01:03:20.319 --> 01:03:23.941]  Well, there's no doubt that what you're seeing is absolutely on target, John.
[01:03:23.941 --> 01:03:25.542]  Thank you for the call.
[01:03:25.542 --> 01:03:27.244]  David in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:03:27.244 --> 01:03:28.645]  Welcome.
[01:03:28.645 --> 01:03:29.385]  Thank you.
[01:03:29.385 --> 01:03:35.989]  I just wanted to say, the Denver Airport mural, kind of like an exact sequence of events?
[01:03:35.989 --> 01:03:37.070]  Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.
[01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:41.813]  Folks, we actually have video of it in the computer file that McBrain shot.
[01:03:41.813 --> 01:03:47.217]  It is a guy in a trench coat with a breathing apparatus on his face, like Bain, shooting a bunch of little kids.
[01:03:48.989 --> 01:03:51.470]  And there's a giant underground base right underneath it.
[01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:55.392]  We've talked to the police that were there during the construction.
[01:03:55.392 --> 01:04:05.677]  There's a giant underground prison and relocation center right under it, the shadow government's base there, and they have murals showing everything that's happened so far, yes.
[01:04:05.677 --> 01:04:06.098]  And why?
[01:04:06.098 --> 01:04:14.342]  Because they're into the occult, and the Illuminists believe you must show someone what you're going to do first before you do the actual act.
[01:04:14.342 --> 01:04:15.842]  They call that lesser magic.
[01:04:15.842 --> 01:04:16.563]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:04:17.682 --> 01:04:26.889]  Yeah, and it's the exact sequence that comes out later in the mural is the burning of the guns and destroying of the guns and disarmament.
[01:04:26.889 --> 01:04:27.470]  You know, you're right.
[01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:29.031]  I even forgot about that.
[01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:31.073]  Guys, can we pull our video of the mural?
[01:04:31.073 --> 01:04:33.074]  I think it's in the computer system.
[01:04:33.074 --> 01:04:34.275]  We'll try to have that when we come back from break.
[01:04:34.275 --> 01:04:34.676]  Stay there.
[01:04:34.676 --> 01:04:36.837]  I want you to elaborate on that.
[01:04:36.837 --> 01:04:37.438]  That's what I mean.
[01:04:37.438 --> 01:04:39.119]  It's just totally staged.
[01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:41.701]  And then they have, this is all a ritual.
[01:04:41.701 --> 01:04:44.203]  And then later in the mural, yeah, they take the guns.
[01:04:44.203 --> 01:04:45.725]  This is all a giant
[01:04:46.445 --> 01:04:57.815]  Giant ritual because they had a trailer before showing the audience being shot up right before this happened They had a 1985 comic with the exact same thing happening in Batman.
[01:04:57.815 --> 01:04:58.775]  It's all in your face.
[01:04:58.775 --> 01:05:00.437]  This is mind control Hope you enjoy it
[01:05:01.923 --> 01:05:03.243]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.243 --> 01:05:08.825]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:05:08.825 --> 01:05:13.847]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:05:13.847 --> 01:05:14.307]  It's true.
[01:05:14.307 --> 01:05:17.128]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:05:17.128 --> 01:05:18.869]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:05:19.409 --> 01:05:24.630]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:31.752]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:05:31.752 --> 01:05:32.872]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:32.872 --> 01:05:39.214]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:05:39.554 --> 01:05:42.735]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:42.735 --> 01:05:44.956]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:05:45.896 --> 01:05:46.096]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:05:46.096 --> 01:05:49.537]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:05:49.537 --> 01:05:51.278]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:03.061]  Let me ask you a question.

[01:06:06.404 --> 01:06:07.425]  The freedom to worship?

[01:08:11.422 --> 01:08:13.022]  You want answers?
[01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:14.943]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.943 --> 01:08:18.743]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.743 --> 01:08:24.445]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.445 --> 01:08:35.667]  They're saying that the Colorado shooter, just miles from Columbine, that shooting happened right before they were trying to pass anti-gun legislation, they're saying, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:48.358]  That he kicked in the big metal doors, which anyone that's been around these modern theaters, and it was a modern one, knows, you're not gonna kick one of those down without a battering ram.
[01:08:48.358 --> 01:09:01.847]  But he knocks it down, he's wearing a mask, and now they've found him, and lo and behold, he was in a government-funded brain research program as a PhD student.
[01:09:03.769 --> 01:09:08.811]  In neurosciences, that is being reported right now.
[01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:13.812]  Isn't that just interesting?
[01:09:13.812 --> 01:09:20.754]  He was a neuroscience PhD student, just like Theodore Kaczynski when he got recruited into MKUltra.
[01:09:20.754 --> 01:09:23.255]  Oh, you didn't know that's in the LA Times, the Unabomber?
[01:09:24.639 --> 01:09:26.941]  Was in the MKUltra Mind Control Program?
[01:09:26.941 --> 01:09:28.201]  Oh, but never mind that.
[01:09:28.201 --> 01:09:43.891]  Or Tim McVeigh's doctor from the time he was captured until he was executed was Jollien West, who just died two years ago, who was the number 200 Dr. Ewing Cameron, the head of MKUltra, who admittedly kidnapped thousands of children and reprogrammed them with new personalities.
[01:09:43.891 --> 01:09:46.093]  That's History Channel.
[01:09:46.093 --> 01:09:48.514]  They had him in Maryland, also up in Toronto.
[01:09:48.514 --> 01:09:50.336]  Big mind control bases.
[01:09:50.336 --> 01:09:52.337]  That's declassified.
[01:09:54.096 --> 01:09:59.578]  But the fact that, oh, his number two was McVeigh's doctor all those years.
[01:09:59.578 --> 01:10:00.838]  Nothing to see here.
[01:10:00.838 --> 01:10:03.039]  Move along.
[01:10:03.039 --> 01:10:07.081]  Or that Harris and Kleibold were connected to similar programs.
[01:10:07.081 --> 01:10:10.082]  And that whole story, and people reporting multiple shooters.
[01:10:10.082 --> 01:10:18.445]  And now we have the Denver airport that has murals about underground bases and a big Bane character with a breathing mask, a gas mask on.
[01:10:19.713 --> 01:10:29.616]  Killing children with a machine gun and a sword, and then next to the mural, it shows guns being destroyed after that.
[01:10:29.616 --> 01:10:30.336]  They love it.
[01:10:30.336 --> 01:10:40.059]  They love throwing it in your face over and over and over and over again.
[01:10:43.436 --> 01:10:50.522]  Of all the places it could happen, right by Columbine, another guy in a black trench coat wearing a Bain breathing mask.
[01:10:50.522 --> 01:10:51.363]  Oh, but he's wearing a mask.
[01:10:51.363 --> 01:10:52.243]  We don't know.
[01:10:52.243 --> 01:10:53.945]  Again, this is standard black op.
[01:10:53.945 --> 01:10:54.865]  You send in your team.
[01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:57.030]  This even came out.
[01:10:57.030 --> 01:11:00.092]  I said this about the attacks in India.
[01:11:00.092 --> 01:11:01.453]  Remember that a few years ago?
[01:11:01.453 --> 01:11:03.355]  And I said those guys weren't Muslim extremists.
[01:11:03.355 --> 01:11:04.616]  They look like they're on drugs.
[01:11:04.616 --> 01:11:12.482]  In a few videos, it turned out they were on PCP-LSD and had injectors just whacked out of their minds, landed in boats.
[01:11:12.482 --> 01:11:15.724]  And the head of Indian security said it was staged by the West.
[01:11:15.724 --> 01:11:17.425]  He got killed that day.
[01:11:17.425 --> 01:11:20.248]  And then it came out in the news later.
[01:11:20.968 --> 01:11:32.878]  In the Chicago Tribune and other papers, that indeed a CIA operative had been running the attacks in India to be blamed on Muslim extremists.
[01:11:32.878 --> 01:11:34.900]  I mean, this is literally the Manchurian candidate.
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:37.202]  You seen the remake of that with Denzel Washington?
[01:11:37.202 --> 01:11:39.183]  Folks, that isn't fiction.
[01:11:39.183 --> 01:11:45.168]  That's fiction showing you what's really going on.
[01:11:45.168 --> 01:11:47.791]  I can tell you that people very close to John Lennon
[01:11:49.121 --> 01:11:50.442]  There's a lot you don't know about that.
[01:11:50.442 --> 01:11:58.528]  And not just the fact that the person that was under my control that did it was programmed by the catcher in the rye and so was the shooter of Reagan.
[01:11:58.528 --> 01:12:01.670]  I mean, folks, this is programming.
[01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:04.492]  They've had for hundreds of years, a flower, that was in the news.
[01:12:04.492 --> 01:12:05.653]  In fact, I forget the name of it.
[01:12:05.653 --> 01:12:08.775]  Will you guys type in drug that makes you do whatever you're told?
[01:12:08.775 --> 01:12:17.022]  Drug that makes you helplessly, I mean, they say 100% of people that are given this drug, scopolamine out of the flower, there it is.
[01:12:17.904 --> 01:12:24.047]  That you tell them, stick your hand in the blender, chop your baby up with a meat cleaver, jump off that cliff, give me all your jewelry.
[01:12:24.047 --> 01:12:25.487]  You do it.
[01:12:25.487 --> 01:12:34.251]  Well, yeah, that's just what drug dealers and criminals can do, blowing some of this in your face.
[01:12:34.251 --> 01:12:35.311]  This is what they do.
[01:12:35.311 --> 01:12:37.612]  Sirhan Sirhan was on an amnesiac.
[01:12:37.612 --> 01:12:38.332]  That's come out.
[01:12:38.332 --> 01:12:40.914]  The LAPD said he didn't shoot JFK.
[01:12:40.914 --> 01:12:41.714]  RFK, excuse me.
[01:12:43.163 --> 01:12:45.944]  So, right as they want to pass the U.N.
[01:12:45.944 --> 01:12:56.008]  treaty, right as they don't have two votes they need in the Senate, right as all this happens, right as the campaign heats up, and they're now saying this is going to be Obama's new campaign, he's praying for those killed.
[01:12:56.008 --> 01:12:59.529]  Fourteen dead now, including a baby shot right in the face.
[01:12:59.529 --> 01:13:04.271]  And Kurt Nemo breaks down the statistics that one of the lowest forms of death is mass shooting.
[01:13:04.271 --> 01:13:06.292]  He has the numbers up there.
[01:13:06.292 --> 01:13:09.813]  Kurt might just change that headline to like, you know, give a better chance of dying from
[01:13:10.888 --> 01:13:15.092]  You know, an infection in a hospital hundreds of times better than dying in a mass shooting.
[01:13:15.092 --> 01:13:17.774]  I don't know, but the statistics are very important though.
[01:13:17.774 --> 01:13:18.574]  Good job on that.
[01:13:18.574 --> 01:13:20.456]  Now, I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:13:20.456 --> 01:13:24.640]  I already went to a couple.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:36.630]  But remember, eight federal agencies, eight federal agencies, eight, eight federal agencies, FBI, ATF, you name it, together,
[01:13:37.392 --> 01:13:48.220]  knowingly shipped guns upwards of 20,000 hand grenades over three years to Mexico to blame the second amendment that came out in the ATF memos.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:53.224]  I saw them two and a half years ago raiding gun shows and stuff for no reason and setting people up with fake IDs.
[01:13:53.224 --> 01:13:56.827]  Oh, uh, you know, have an illegal go up and buy a gun with a fake ID.
[01:13:56.827 --> 01:13:59.729]  The private seller sells it to them and they go to jail.
[01:14:01.499 --> 01:14:03.199]  The system plays on this ignorance.
[01:14:03.199 --> 01:14:05.840]  And I said, look, they're saying restrict guns because of Mexico.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:06.700]  They're staging this.
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:07.701]  This is staged.
[01:14:07.701 --> 01:14:08.581]  Boom, it all came out.
[01:14:08.581 --> 01:14:15.122]  Because I had sources inside the DEA, like Celica Still.
[01:14:15.122 --> 01:14:16.403]  I mean, we're on record, folks.
[01:14:16.403 --> 01:14:17.803]  We're on record with this.
[01:14:17.803 --> 01:14:26.265]  Now, generally, all I knew with this Dark Knight thing was Bain was seen, you know, fighting the government, anti-Wall Street.
[01:14:26.265 --> 01:14:28.766]  That's the way to demonize protesters.
[01:14:28.766 --> 01:14:30.166]  The same guy that wrote The Dark Knight.
[01:14:32.062 --> 01:14:38.787]  Rises, you know, it puts together the Call of Duty stuff where the new bad guy coming out in the new one is an anti-government type.
[01:14:38.787 --> 01:14:40.288]  I mean, this is what they're doing.
[01:14:40.288 --> 01:14:49.434]  This is the message being sold to create this illusion that we're under real terror attacks and mass shootings when it's not really happening.
[01:14:49.434 --> 01:14:55.098]  There it is, the most dangerous drug in the world, Devil's Breath, chemical from Colombia, can block free will, wipe memory, and even kill.
[01:14:57.978 --> 01:15:00.321]  Yeah, you say, go in there and shoot all these people and you go do it.
[01:15:00.321 --> 01:15:00.562]  Oh, but, uh...
[01:15:13.277 --> 01:15:14.137]  Nothing to worry about here.
[01:15:14.137 --> 01:15:17.279]  I mean, it's always the same MO, but they don't ever trust these guys to do that.
[01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:35.489]  They put on a mask, the operative goes and kills people, then they have the person blasted out of their mind, like the shooter with Congresswoman Giffords, who, you know, dressing up as women, taking hallucinogens every day, disappearing for months, and then goes and shoots people about to expose Fashion Furious in a bipartisan move.
[01:15:35.489 --> 01:15:40.632]  Because Giffords was pro-Second Amendment, we've confirmed, through investigative journalists, Wayne Matchett and others,
[01:15:42.631 --> 01:15:44.892]  He said this before it even came out, and then it came out in the news.
[01:15:44.892 --> 01:15:46.533]  It's just amazing.
[01:15:46.533 --> 01:15:50.956]  I want to go to another clip from the video, leaked Dark Knight Rises.
[01:15:50.956 --> 01:15:53.537]  Now understand, I came in here and shot it for 35 minutes.
[01:15:53.537 --> 01:15:55.378]  Rob Jacobson cut it down to about nine and a half.
[01:15:55.378 --> 01:16:04.043]  He's in there right now, from the same shoot, going back into the video where he cut it saying, oh, what if it doesn't happen?
[01:16:04.043 --> 01:16:07.364]  Where I talked about this could cause mass shootings, mass riots.
[01:16:07.364 --> 01:16:08.425]  I believe it's a trigger.
[01:16:08.425 --> 01:16:10.126]  Look, I know when something's a trigger.
[01:16:11.178 --> 01:16:13.120]  What do I say at the intro of the video?
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:18.304]  This is high-tech brainwashing and propaganda.
[01:16:18.304 --> 01:16:21.827]  Again, if movies don't have power, why are they posting guards all the movie theaters?
[01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:27.272]  Because there may be some copycats here.
[01:16:27.272 --> 01:16:30.735]  Let's go ahead and... That's why advertising's powerful.
[01:16:30.735 --> 01:16:32.597]  That's why you have billboards and ads.
[01:16:32.597 --> 01:16:35.780]  Because we are social creatures.
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:38.022]  We do get conditioned, especially when we're unconscious.
[01:16:39.888 --> 01:16:42.062]  All subliminals do is make me physically ill.
[01:16:42.062 --> 01:16:43.229]  They do not work on me anymore.
[01:16:46.482 --> 01:16:52.546]  Makes me ill because I'm watching it, my brain's picking it up, and the conscious is trying to analyze it from that data well.
[01:16:52.546 --> 01:16:56.028]  And, you know, it's like a computer with the pinwheel of death or something.
[01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:58.690]  It's just like, you know, Danger Will Robinson.
[01:16:58.690 --> 01:17:02.212]  And I saw these trailers and went and found out what the movie's about, and I'm like, look out.
[01:17:02.212 --> 01:17:07.375]  Here's where I talk about a Galean dialectic problem reaction solution, false flag.
[01:17:07.375 --> 01:17:11.878]  And people helplessly in the theater being conditioned in a mass mind control event.
[01:17:11.878 --> 01:17:13.319]  This is mind control.
[01:17:13.319 --> 01:17:15.140]  These films are mind control.
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:15.521]  Here it is.
[01:17:16.121 --> 01:17:18.404]  Not just these Batman films.
[01:17:18.404 --> 01:17:33.040]  Every one of these films has terrorists blowing up major cities constantly to create the psychological illusion that there's big sharks out there that want to eat you and there's terrorists under every table that want to attack you and your family.
[01:17:33.661 --> 01:17:37.003]  And you notice at the end of Jaws, the shark has been killed.
[01:17:37.003 --> 01:17:38.244]  He's been defeated.
[01:17:38.244 --> 01:17:41.706]  But still, the beaches remained empty.
[01:17:41.706 --> 01:17:44.447]  You are being subconsciously programmed.
[01:17:44.447 --> 01:17:57.935]  When you go in one of these movies and just turn yourself over to it and suspend a disbelief, you become a willing victim to have your mind literally programmed in that key fear state.
[01:17:57.935 --> 01:18:02.638]  Because when the mind is in that fear state, it is wide open to be reprogrammed.
[01:18:03.218 --> 01:18:06.680]  And now in the new film, we see the football game blown up.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.681]  We see the police helpless.
[01:18:09.681 --> 01:18:22.288]  If the state doesn't take every right we've got, and turn our children against us, and set up highway checkpoints, and launch 30,000 armed drones, and listen to our phone calls, then none of us are safe.
[01:18:22.288 --> 01:18:29.472]  Because the non-existent threat of Osama Bin Laden, and Al-Syedah, and Bane are gonna get us.
[01:18:31.021 --> 01:18:40.349]  The key to understanding why the social engineers want males in an arrested development junior high mentality state is simple.
[01:18:40.349 --> 01:18:54.821]  Through thousands of films and video games, we are bombarded with the idea that threats always come in the form of a giant evil monster or terrorist who openly announces themselves.
[01:18:54.821 --> 01:18:57.203]  Not through slow cultural death.
[01:18:58.223 --> 01:19:11.153]  And men are presented with an idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Herculean figure, or somebody like Batman, defeating the enemy all by themselves because the public is powerless.
[01:19:11.153 --> 01:19:14.655]  That's why now when I talk to so many men, they say, oh, you're such a hero.
[01:19:14.655 --> 01:19:16.276]  You go out and confront politicians.
[01:19:16.276 --> 01:19:18.618]  You go out and, you know, fight for freedom.
[01:19:18.618 --> 01:19:19.799]  I'm glad you're there.
[01:19:19.799 --> 01:19:20.560]  What do you mean?
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.021]  I'm just an average person like you.
[01:19:22.935 --> 01:19:25.880]  We're not fighting big green Martians from Mars.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.563]  But again, what does this do?
[01:19:27.563 --> 01:19:36.117]  A guy dressed up like Bane shows up and kills a bunch of people who's in a government-sponsored university brain-neuro-interface system.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:42.545]  Perfect cover for their operatives to get to him, to drug him up, to play the part of the patsy.
[01:19:42.545 --> 01:19:44.467]  That's how these M.O.s work.
[01:19:44.467 --> 01:19:51.473]  And then now they're blurring it all together, where people again see these movies as even more, more real.
[01:19:51.473 --> 01:19:52.734]  All of this to get the U.N.
[01:19:52.734 --> 01:19:53.435]  Treaty passed.
[01:19:53.435 --> 01:19:55.157]  It's all about global governments.
[01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:57.879]  It's all an exercise in mind control.
[01:19:57.879 --> 01:19:58.920]  Your call's coming up.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:19:59.441]  Stay with us.

[01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:37.053]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:20:37.053 --> 01:20:42.857]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:20:42.857 --> 01:20:46.499]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:46.499 --> 01:20:49.221]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:49.221 --> 01:20:54.284]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:20:57.126 --> 01:21:01.269]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:01.269 --> 01:21:04.672]  Do you fear losing your home and being on the street?
[01:21:04.672 --> 01:21:05.793]  Can't happen to you?
[01:21:05.793 --> 01:21:07.314]  Well, think again.
[01:21:07.314 --> 01:21:11.717]  Millions of honest, hardworking Americans have had their homes stolen by the banks.
[01:21:11.717 --> 01:21:12.518]  There is an answer.
[01:21:13.098 --> 01:21:16.099]  The answer is MortgageEndgame.com.

[01:21:29.902 --> 01:21:30.962]  Paid off your home?
[01:21:30.962 --> 01:21:33.263]  Forget about getting your original paperwork.
[01:21:33.263 --> 01:21:34.983]  On time every month with your payments?
[01:21:34.983 --> 01:21:36.123]  It doesn't matter.
[01:21:36.123 --> 01:21:39.304]  Your title is likely clouded and nobody knows who owns your home.
[01:21:39.744 --> 01:21:41.164]  You are not alone.

[01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:05.930]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:08.031]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:22:08.943 --> 01:22:17.907]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:22:17.907 --> 01:22:22.829]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:22:23.462 --> 01:22:34.834]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

[01:22:42.521 --> 01:22:46.827]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:22:46.827 --> 01:22:50.431]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:22:50.431 --> 01:22:57.701]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:22:57.701 --> 01:22:58.962]  Protect your immune system.
[01:22:58.962 --> 01:23:00.004]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:23:00.584 --> 01:23:08.929]  We all know there are secrets behind closed doors in every relationship, and one of the biggest is that men are losing libido, or sexual desire, especially if you're a man over 40.
[01:23:08.929 --> 01:23:11.511]  The problem could be declining testosterone levels.
[01:23:11.511 --> 01:23:14.732]  Remember, it's testosterone that makes a man a man in every way.
[01:23:14.732 --> 01:23:16.273]  That's why we created TGen.
[01:23:16.273 --> 01:23:20.796]  TGen is an all-natural formula with ingredients proven to boost your own testosterone.
[01:23:21.036 --> 01:23:25.540]  Optimum testosterone levels mean better mood, energy, and of course, better sex life.

[01:23:33.186 --> 01:23:33.366]  800-577-8644.
[01:23:33.366 --> 01:23:34.447]  TGen works, or you simply don't pay.
[01:23:34.447 --> 01:23:35.588]  For your 30-day free trial, call 800-577-8644.
[01:23:35.588 --> 01:23:35.628]  800-577-8644.
[01:23:47.298 --> 01:23:50.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, it's being reported here that the Gangster Squad
[01:24:11.971 --> 01:24:18.811]  A trailer was playing showing people being shot in a movie theater from behind the screen as it happened.
[01:24:22.461 --> 01:24:26.663]  And now, notice this is set in Gotham, which is supposed to be New York.
[01:24:26.663 --> 01:24:32.186]  I said that before and somebody sent me an email or a comment saying, oh no, it's Chicago.
[01:24:32.186 --> 01:24:32.886]  No, no, no.
[01:24:32.886 --> 01:24:37.169]  Gotham, the creator of Batman has said, you can look it up on Wikipedia, is New York.
[01:24:37.169 --> 01:24:40.370]  That's how dumb these comic book people are, some of them.
[01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:48.855]  Again, nothing against comic books unless you act like it's real and you're a full-grown man and you can't take criticism of it and the fact that it's being used as a vehicle to propagandize.
[01:24:49.335 --> 01:24:50.716]  You say it's just a movie.
[01:24:50.716 --> 01:24:53.279]  It's just a movie because you're like a child.
[01:24:53.279 --> 01:24:56.121]  This isn't just a movie.
[01:24:56.121 --> 01:24:57.362]  This is propaganda.
[01:24:57.362 --> 01:24:58.724]  This is conditioning.
[01:24:58.724 --> 01:25:02.227]  The messages in these films are put there by the Department of Defense.
[01:25:02.227 --> 01:25:03.088]  It's paid for.
[01:25:03.088 --> 01:25:05.630]  It's on record.
[01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:08.853]  This is about collapsing society right as it's happening.
[01:25:09.827 --> 01:25:10.447]  Listen to this.
[01:25:10.447 --> 01:25:24.131]  Notice, the commissioner is in Batman, now the commissioner from New York, with the mayor, who wants guns banned nationwide, and who's calling for gun control, is saying, I'm going to protect movie theaters in New York from the Joker.
[01:25:24.131 --> 01:25:34.294]  See, they're merging reality and unreality at the subconscious level now, with the conscious, where people now are being taught, oh no, it's real, you could die.
[01:25:34.294 --> 01:25:37.395]  Oh, it's so exciting when you go see Batman.
[01:25:37.395 --> 01:25:38.335]  PC Kelly.
[01:25:39.599 --> 01:25:40.820]  Police Commissioner.
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:41.581]  Oh wow.
[01:25:41.581 --> 01:25:43.183]  Colorado movie theater shooting.
[01:25:43.183 --> 01:25:45.445]  Suspect claimed to be Batman Nemesis the Joker.
[01:25:45.445 --> 01:25:45.666]  Really?
[01:25:45.666 --> 01:25:48.369]  He was dressed up in all black with a gas mask on.
[01:25:48.369 --> 01:25:50.651]  I thought that's Bane.
[01:25:50.651 --> 01:25:59.461]  Newark Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the gunman, suspected of attacking the crowded movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, resembled Batman's arch-villain.
[01:25:59.461 --> 01:26:00.602]  And I was going to be in Colorado.
[01:26:01.383 --> 01:26:02.884]  Right now, but I canceled the trip.
[01:26:02.884 --> 01:26:03.865]  That's really weird.
[01:26:03.865 --> 01:26:06.066]  Somebody's on here saying Obama was in Colorado.
[01:26:06.066 --> 01:26:08.188]  Guys, can you look and see if Obama was in Colorado yesterday?
[01:26:08.188 --> 01:26:10.009]  Just type in News, Obama, Colorado.
[01:26:10.009 --> 01:26:10.409]  Click News.
[01:26:10.409 --> 01:26:12.711]  I want to see.
[01:26:12.711 --> 01:26:15.272]  We have some information.
[01:26:15.272 --> 01:26:20.936]  Again, this is New York inserting itself for like this illusion that the mafia police of New York are somehow actually fighting villains.
[01:26:20.936 --> 01:26:22.917]  Man, this is total mind control.
[01:26:22.917 --> 01:26:24.038]  Most of it is public.
[01:26:24.038 --> 01:26:26.179]  It clearly looks like a deranged individual.
[01:26:26.179 --> 01:26:28.261]  He has his hair painted red and he was the Joker.
[01:26:29.648 --> 01:26:31.029]  Obviously the enemy of Batman.
[01:26:31.029 --> 01:26:34.611]  This is the police commissioner like it's a cartoon.
[01:26:34.611 --> 01:26:40.595]  You can see how they wrote this in PsyOps to even merge it like the commissioner's fighting the Joker.
[01:26:40.595 --> 01:26:45.518]  When I first read this, I thought this has got to be a hoax, but no, it's CBS AP.
[01:26:45.518 --> 01:26:49.800]  And they've got the police out everywhere at the movie theaters protecting you from the Joker.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:55.284]  And the police chief saying it like he's fighting the Joker.
[01:26:55.284 --> 01:26:55.844]  Oh my God.
[01:26:55.844 --> 01:26:57.185]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:26:58.297 --> 01:27:02.158]  Again, for two years the beaches were almost empty after Jaws came out in 75.
[01:27:02.158 --> 01:27:03.959]  This is the mind control.
[01:27:03.959 --> 01:27:06.399]  This is what I covered earlier.
[01:27:06.399 --> 01:27:07.900]  We have some common information.
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:09.060]  Most of it is public.
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:10.701]  It clearly looks like a deranged individual.
[01:27:10.701 --> 01:27:12.881]  This is what he's saying, like he's on the run.
[01:27:12.881 --> 01:27:14.041]  He has his hair painted red.
[01:27:14.041 --> 01:27:15.542]  He said he was the Joker.
[01:27:15.542 --> 01:27:16.682]  Obviously the enemy of Batman.
[01:27:16.682 --> 01:27:18.743]  This is quotes by the police commissioner.
[01:27:18.743 --> 01:27:24.885]  Kelly said in a news conference afternoon, I've been to urban warfare drills where they blow up a bus or a police car.
[01:27:24.885 --> 01:27:25.925]  You've seen it in Road to Tyranny.
[01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:38.525]  And then the mayor announces they were hit by terrorists with the army, and they put it on the news, and then the next day in the paper, it says terrorists hit Belton, and then later at the end, it's like, but it was only a drill.
[01:27:38.525 --> 01:27:51.910]  It's to have that subconscious effect as a simulant that real terrorists are hitting, but to make it even more, they add a little shooting onto it, and then they come out and now Gotham actually is fighting the Joker and is going to protect you.
[01:27:53.365 --> 01:27:59.302]  Instead of Kony, who'd been dead for five and a half years, now they have to invade all of Africa for a dead guy.
[01:27:59.302 --> 01:28:00.365]  And now the invasion happened.
[01:28:02.674 --> 01:28:04.554]  Just like they have the simulant Bin Laden.
[01:28:04.554 --> 01:28:07.495]  Bin dead probably before 9-11, certainly right after.
[01:28:07.495 --> 01:28:08.435]  Kidney failure.
[01:28:08.435 --> 01:28:10.596]  But he's this boogeyman who's gonna get you.
[01:28:10.596 --> 01:28:20.898]  And then they kill him, but the body's thrown in the ocean, and then that whole... I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is... This is because... And you as a radio listener, as somebody who's informed, you're like, this sounds crazy.
[01:28:20.898 --> 01:28:23.278]  Yeah, but you... Talk about your neighbors.
[01:28:23.278 --> 01:28:25.359]  I go see these action-adventure movies.
[01:28:25.359 --> 01:28:27.579]  I go out with the crew, maybe every few months one comes out.
[01:28:27.579 --> 01:28:28.939]  We go watch them.
[01:28:28.939 --> 01:28:31.980]  I mean, I like an action-adventure movie, but we go to analyze them and write a review.
[01:28:33.197 --> 01:28:46.588]  I mean, I sit there while grown men, and I've been there at the hospital, you know, and my wife's having kids, and in the next room they're having a kid, and the dad's not even that excited to see their newborn baby.
[01:28:46.588 --> 01:28:49.691]  And I'm like, oh my gosh, it's so incredible, oh!
[01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:55.155]  I've heard only those same sounds at the Avengers with grown men going, oh, ooh!
[01:28:55.155 --> 01:29:00.380]  It's just stupid guys in little outfits fighting, but it's like, oh, this is manliness, they're little children.
[01:29:01.442 --> 01:29:06.466]  And they get very upset when you talk about their video games or their movies or any of this.
[01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:08.427]  All the real world's going on all around you.
[01:29:08.427 --> 01:29:11.689]  And the cops are actually dressed like Bane and acting like Bane.
[01:29:11.689 --> 01:29:14.511]  And notice Cobra Commander, how he dressed.
[01:29:14.511 --> 01:29:17.133]  That's now the police SWAT team uniform in the 80s.
[01:29:17.133 --> 01:29:19.055]  That was Department of Defense funded.
[01:29:19.055 --> 01:29:21.476]  And you all know you wanted to be the villain.
[01:29:21.476 --> 01:29:22.497]  It's all conditioning.
[01:29:22.497 --> 01:29:23.838]  I'm going to go to your calls when we come back.
[01:29:27.506 --> 01:29:29.287]  This is all going megaviral right now.
[01:29:29.287 --> 01:29:31.289]  The articles are all at Infowars.com.
[01:29:31.289 --> 01:29:36.153]  I shot a video breaking some of this down this morning.
[01:29:36.153 --> 01:29:38.194]  But this is all just off the chart.
[01:29:38.194 --> 01:29:42.177]  I'm going to try to give a focused three-minute bullet point on the other side.
[01:29:42.177 --> 01:29:46.581]  And I want the YouTube guys to grab this and put it up.
[01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:48.842]  When we come back, then I'm going right to your calls.
[01:29:48.842 --> 01:29:51.244]  Stand by.
[01:29:51.244 --> 01:29:52.645]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.645 --> 01:29:54.147]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.170 --> 01:29:57.842]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.875 --> 01:30:07.357]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:30:07.357 --> 01:30:09.778]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:30:09.778 --> 01:30:18.882]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:18.882 --> 01:30:22.323]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:30:22.323 --> 01:30:24.004]  There's no priming required.
[01:30:24.004 --> 01:30:26.285]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[01:30:26.285 --> 01:30:28.786]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:30:29.906 --> 01:30:31.367]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:30:31.367 --> 01:30:32.788]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:30:32.788 --> 01:30:35.969]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:30:35.969 --> 01:30:39.351]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:30:39.351 --> 01:30:43.493]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:30:43.493 --> 01:30:46.214]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:30:46.214 --> 01:30:47.795]  It's what my family uses.
[01:30:47.795 --> 01:30:51.117]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:30:51.117 --> 01:30:56.360]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:31:00.544]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[01:31:00.544 --> 01:31:06.069]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:06.069 --> 01:31:10.413]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:10.413 --> 01:31:16.159]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:16.159 --> 01:31:21.464]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:21.764 --> 01:31:22.585]  Number 3.
[01:31:22.585 --> 01:31:26.167]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:26.167 --> 01:31:30.090]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:30.090 --> 01:31:30.890]  Number 4.
[01:31:30.890 --> 01:31:33.652]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:33.652 --> 01:31:36.995]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:37.315 --> 01:31:42.258]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:42.258 --> 01:31:47.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:51.482]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.482 --> 01:31:53.283]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:03.456 --> 01:32:11.563]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[01:32:11.563 --> 01:32:15.647]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[01:32:52.774 --> 01:32:54.595]  It's mind control.
[01:32:54.595 --> 01:32:55.775]  Mind control.
[01:32:55.775 --> 01:33:03.757]  Corruption of your thoughts.
[01:33:03.757 --> 01:33:08.339]  Destruction of your soul.
[01:33:08.339 --> 01:33:09.539]  Mind control.
[01:33:09.539 --> 01:33:11.340]  It's mind control.
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:13.060]  Corruption of your thoughts.
[01:33:23.217 --> 01:33:33.388]  Alright, I want to recap what we're facing here and then we're going to go right to your phone calls.
[01:33:33.388 --> 01:33:35.210]  Here's the bottom line, the timing.
[01:33:45.185 --> 01:33:54.371]  A week and a half, two weeks before Obama is set to sign the UN treaty that he's very close to being able to ratify, that is right on the razor's edge of being ratified by the Senate.
[01:33:54.371 --> 01:33:55.952]  They only need a few votes.
[01:33:55.952 --> 01:34:04.398]  That magically, to register and then even ban many of our firearms, even Forbes reports that, magically this happens.
[01:34:05.933 --> 01:34:21.181]  Then you add on top of that the fact that this happened right outside Columbine with that extremely suspicious event that had globalist operations written all over it, where you had 127 propane bombs placed in the building.
[01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:52.394]  You had Harrison Kleibold saying they would do it, no one stopping them, making a movie about doing it, at the school that aired, half the people not being in the school, none of the police children being in the school, the SWAT teams admittedly killing two of the kids, that came out in local newspapers, all sorts of weirdness, multiple shooters, the fact that happened a few weeks before they were trying to re-up gun control legislation, all of this happening.
[01:34:56.553 --> 01:35:05.194]  Now, we're sitting here watching all of this unfold.
[01:35:05.194 --> 01:35:23.778]  And we now have, this is definitely a sign off, we now have CBS News coming out and reporting with the police commissioner, which is Gotham, New York, that we believe he's the Joker and we're going to keep you safe.
[01:35:23.778 --> 01:35:25.758]  To just mix reality with fantasy.
[01:35:27.165 --> 01:35:33.512]  And the entire film, as I said, is a giant psy-op to prepare you for terrorism.
[01:35:33.512 --> 01:35:38.178]  Police Commissioner Kelly, Colorado Movie Theater, shooting suspect claimed to be Batman Nemesis the Joker.
[01:35:40.199 --> 01:35:50.169]  New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the gunman's suspected of attacking a crowd of movie theater in Aurora, Colorado resembled Batman, Archville, and the Joker at the time of the shocking attack.
[01:35:50.169 --> 01:35:51.710]  Now listen to how he says this.
[01:35:51.710 --> 01:35:52.892]  We have some information.
[01:35:52.892 --> 01:35:53.632]  Most of it's public.
[01:35:53.632 --> 01:35:56.035]  It clearly looks like a deranged individual.
[01:35:56.035 --> 01:35:57.196]  He had his hair painted red.
[01:35:57.196 --> 01:35:59.138]  He was the Joker.
[01:35:59.138 --> 01:36:00.239]  Obviously the enemy of Batman.
[01:36:00.239 --> 01:36:00.840]  These are quotes.
[01:36:01.977 --> 01:36:06.838]  So they're just, again, the whole movie's about the cops, the NYPD was involved, it's all about how they're heroes.
[01:36:06.838 --> 01:36:10.739]  I mean, this is so in your face when they just blur it all.
[01:36:10.739 --> 01:36:19.142]  Kelly said at a news conference afternoon, this is a test for the new civilization where they just blur movies with reality.
[01:36:19.142 --> 01:36:22.703]  I mean, this is a new level of mind control we're witnessing.
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.701]  Kelly said the NYPD is stepping up security at movie theaters around
[01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:41.368]  That the mechanical shark was out there.
[01:36:41.368 --> 01:36:43.990]  He had a better chance of being struck by lightning twice in one year.
[01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:47.432]  Five shark deaths worldwide a year on average from great whites.
[01:36:47.432 --> 01:36:51.675]  Imagine now when there's real attacks at the theaters by the very villains.
[01:36:51.675 --> 01:36:59.680]  And then the police chief and the police commissioner comes out and says we're gonna have checkpoints everywhere and all the rest of which they already have to keep you safe from the Joker.
[01:37:02.193 --> 01:37:03.354]  I mean, don't people see this?
[01:37:03.354 --> 01:37:12.979]  I mean, I learned this again watching them do drills in Seattle and in Belton, Texas and other areas where they blow stuff up and announce it was real.
[01:37:14.758 --> 01:37:19.580]  And then maybe at the end of an hour-long thing, saying, by the way, this was just a drill, or at the bottom of the article.
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:23.402]  I mean, just really, and I was there when the mayor did it in Belton.
[01:37:23.402 --> 01:37:25.604]  He was all smiling, all wild-eyed.
[01:37:25.604 --> 01:37:27.004]  We've been hit by terrorists.
[01:37:27.004 --> 01:37:27.865]  It's really been horrible.
[01:37:27.865 --> 01:37:32.787]  And I'm sitting there with the cops all smiling, and they had kids with their fake guts blown out and stuff.
[01:37:32.787 --> 01:37:39.451]  And locals were showing up, and the Army was holding them back, going, oh, I can't tell you what's happening with smoking vehicles.
[01:37:39.451 --> 01:37:41.732]  And the military came over to me and said, get out of here.
[01:37:42.796 --> 01:37:45.898]  They were running a PSYOP on the town.
[01:37:45.898 --> 01:37:48.260]  That's what this is, folks.
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:56.085]  Again, you know it's staged, not just by where it happened, the timing of it, but by the way they respond.
[01:37:56.085 --> 01:38:04.832]  Already with their statements early this morning, all rolling out with press conferences about, yeah, he's the Joker, Batman's enemy, we'll keep you safe.
[01:38:04.832 --> 01:38:06.313]  I'll hit any minute.
[01:38:06.313 --> 01:38:10.476]  I'm just reading you quotes, ladies and gentlemen, and this is how unconscious the public is.
[01:38:12.859 --> 01:38:15.342]  I'm shaking right now.
[01:38:15.342 --> 01:38:15.863]  Wow.
[01:38:15.863 --> 01:38:24.613]  Kelly said the NYPD is stepping up security at movie theaters around the city after suspect James Holmes walked into the Colorado movie theater during midnight showing.
[01:38:24.613 --> 01:38:29.039]  No, he kicked down the door of the new Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises, an open fire killing 12 people.
[01:38:29.039 --> 01:38:30.701]  Now they're saying 14 and injuring dozens more.
[01:38:32.028 --> 01:38:45.196]  Police commissioner, just like in the movie, there's a police commissioner, called, and again, it's New York, but again, because it's Batman and Gotham's New York, they're responding like it's real in the middle of it.
[01:38:45.196 --> 01:38:47.857]  He talked about the Joker.
[01:38:47.857 --> 01:38:51.800]  There's an individual, the Joker, the enemy of Batman, right there.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:52.680]  We're on the lookout.
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:54.561]  We've got extra officers out there.
[01:38:54.561 --> 01:38:58.624]  The Joker, yes, we're dealing with him right now, Gotham.
[01:38:58.624 --> 01:39:00.505]  I am the commissioner, Ray Kelly.
[01:39:04.022 --> 01:39:10.803]  Police Commissioner Ray Kelly called the shooting horrendous and said the NYPD is working to keep moviegoers safe.
[01:39:10.803 --> 01:39:25.886]  As a precaution against copycats and the rise of comfort levels among movie patrons in the wake of the horrendous shooting in Colorado, the New York City Police Department is providing coverage at theaters where The Dark Knight Rises is playing in five boroughs, Kelly said.
[01:39:25.886 --> 01:39:27.927]  Everybody said again, we have some information.
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:30.020]  Most of it public.
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:32.881]  It clearly looks like a deranged individual.
[01:39:32.881 --> 01:39:35.041]  He had his hair painted red.
[01:39:35.041 --> 01:39:36.741]  He said he was the Joker.
[01:39:36.741 --> 01:39:39.002]  Obviously, the enemy, a Batman.
[01:39:39.002 --> 01:39:42.863]  Kelly said in a news conference afternoon.
[01:39:42.863 --> 01:39:52.484]  But don't worry, extra officers are out there to keep you safe from Bane, the Joker, and any other dangerous... And oh, ooh, now it's even selling out more.
[01:39:52.484 --> 01:39:55.305]  It's so fun to go, maybe you'll get shot at it.
[01:39:56.021 --> 01:39:57.342]  You know, forget Scratch and Sniff.
[01:39:57.342 --> 01:40:02.045]  You know, they had that, uh, movies in the 70s where you scratched it and smelled it.
[01:40:02.045 --> 01:40:03.186]  Hey, you never know!
[01:40:03.186 --> 01:40:06.909]  A guy will pop out in a Bane outfit or Joker outfit and shoot ya!
[01:40:06.909 --> 01:40:09.230]  Oh, but movies aren't powerful!
[01:40:09.230 --> 01:40:10.231]  Oh, no!
[01:40:10.231 --> 01:40:10.751]  Oh, no!
[01:40:10.751 --> 01:40:13.353]  There's nothing going on here!
[01:40:13.353 --> 01:40:15.855]  He was just in the neuroscience department there.
[01:40:15.855 --> 01:40:17.476]  Department of Defense funded.
[01:40:17.476 --> 01:40:22.219]  Just follows the exact MO of Reagan.
[01:40:22.219 --> 01:40:22.600]  RFK.
[01:40:24.269 --> 01:40:26.151]  John Lennon.
[01:40:26.151 --> 01:40:26.751]  On and on.
[01:40:26.751 --> 01:40:31.455]  Oh, here's Russia Today, which is based on the Russian government.
[01:40:31.455 --> 01:40:33.217]  Bus bombing.
[01:40:33.217 --> 01:40:37.500]  Does Iran really need to attack Israeli tourists?
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:38.381]  And then it goes on.
[01:40:38.381 --> 01:40:41.644]  I actually have the article here.
[01:40:41.644 --> 01:40:47.249]  It's another RT article saying that the other bombing in Europe was a false flag.
[01:40:47.249 --> 01:40:49.751]  Guys, just reprint that for me or I'll never be able to find it.
[01:40:51.238 --> 01:40:55.501]  The point is, this stuff is really happening.
[01:40:55.501 --> 01:41:05.688]  And even if it was some guy on Prozac or something who was in a fantasy land, and that's maybe a 5% chance out of 100, it's still mind control because this is this culture.
[01:41:05.688 --> 01:41:07.189]  And it's not just Alex Jones saying that.
[01:41:09.574 --> 01:41:21.960]  Psychologists, writers, they're out there in the London Telegraph, you name it, saying it's the culture of death, the culture of sadism that people think is so cool, the simulated murders, the violent video games, where people don't have a compulsion against it.
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:25.122]  Folks used to throw up if they saw violence.
[01:41:25.122 --> 01:41:28.383]  Both my grandfathers didn't like violence because they'd really seen violence.
[01:41:28.383 --> 01:41:33.966]  Especially my grandfather that, you know, was flying around in World War II.
[01:41:33.966 --> 01:41:36.187]  He wouldn't tell you war stories, none of those guys would.
[01:41:37.861 --> 01:41:45.745]  They didn't like... I mean, if they saw violence or blood dripping out of somebody's mouth in a movie, my grandfather would grab my dad by the hand and take him out.
[01:41:45.745 --> 01:41:47.566]  It wasn't because he couldn't handle it.
[01:41:47.566 --> 01:41:49.126]  It was because it was real.
[01:41:49.126 --> 01:41:51.968]  Violence wasn't a joke.
[01:41:51.968 --> 01:41:55.870]  But see, all these other people like death, carnage, murder, it's so much fun.
[01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:59.371]  People sit there and giggle and laugh in movies when kids are being tortured.
[01:41:59.371 --> 01:42:00.232]  I've seen it myself.
[01:42:02.827 --> 01:42:08.330]  When I went and saw Natural Born Killers when it first came out, the audience was laughing and getting off on it.
[01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:09.871]  And I wasn't sophisticated enough then.
[01:42:09.871 --> 01:42:18.735]  I was just in college to understand that this was saying violence on TV as he sensitized this and made it sick.
[01:42:18.735 --> 01:42:22.437]  That's what Oliver Stone was saying was, look how sick this is.
[01:42:22.437 --> 01:42:24.558]  Look how in your face this is.
[01:42:24.558 --> 01:42:26.259]  Look at how they think it's funny.
[01:42:26.259 --> 01:42:31.021]  Look at how the media exacerbates this and pushes this culture.
[01:42:31.021 --> 01:42:31.902]  I thought, oh my God.
[01:42:32.992 --> 01:42:35.814]  I was projecting the people liking it onto the movie.
[01:42:35.814 --> 01:42:40.738]  It was the people that didn't get the movie.
[01:42:40.738 --> 01:42:44.521]  The movie was saying this is wrong.
[01:42:44.521 --> 01:42:55.489]  And boy, these folks that are into violence, they love it when it happens to other people until it happens to them and they cry like little babies.
[01:42:55.489 --> 01:42:57.931]  Yeah, this is a new RT.
[01:42:57.931 --> 01:43:01.654]  If you type false flag into Google News, into NSA News,
[01:43:03.191 --> 01:43:05.455]  And click it, it's the top link, or at least it was this morning.
[01:43:05.455 --> 01:43:07.098]  There's a whole bunch of false flag news.
[01:43:07.098 --> 01:43:09.261]  Not, not web news.
[01:43:09.261 --> 01:43:09.942]  False flag.
[01:43:09.942 --> 01:43:12.867]  And it's RT and it'll come up.
[01:43:12.867 --> 01:43:14.190]  Thank you.
[01:43:14.190 --> 01:43:14.891]  Already have that one.
[01:43:18.562 --> 01:43:20.323]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:43:20.323 --> 01:43:22.425]  I've been ranting enough here.
[01:43:22.425 --> 01:43:31.251]  It's just that this is so, again, for people that are childlike and don't understand how this works, for somebody who researches this, you know it when you see it.
[01:43:31.251 --> 01:43:38.115]  I mean, I saw the trailer and said, look out, it's a galleon dialectic, getting you ready for terror and creating the illusion that there is all this terror.
[01:43:38.115 --> 01:43:39.256]  And now they've rolled it out.
[01:43:39.256 --> 01:43:48.302]  And the way New York and others are announcing it, the way Obama is already seizing on it and calling for our guns, the way his surrogates, Bloomberg, ABC and others are, we're in deep trouble.
[01:43:49.563 --> 01:43:51.706]  You've got the British imported globalist.
[01:43:51.706 --> 01:43:58.274]  I don't think it's British, but just against, you know, Piers Morgan with all his activities in England and operative calls for more gun control.
[01:43:58.274 --> 01:44:00.496]  How about you get, you know, how about this Piers Morgan?
[01:44:00.496 --> 01:44:01.938]  How about you get out of my country, punk?
[01:44:02.833 --> 01:44:10.295]  You don't come to my country and get on my news, CNN Pentagon News, and tell me to take my guns, okay?
[01:44:10.295 --> 01:44:13.296]  You like being a little disarmed coward with bodyguards?
[01:44:13.296 --> 01:44:14.016]  Good.
[01:44:14.016 --> 01:44:15.376]  Get out of my country.
[01:44:15.376 --> 01:44:16.516]  Move to North Korea.
[01:44:16.516 --> 01:44:21.758]  Get out of here, you jellyfish, soft-lying scumbag parasite.
[01:44:21.758 --> 01:44:24.418]  You are a joke, and you have almost no viewers.
[01:44:24.418 --> 01:44:26.119]  You are a joke!
[01:44:26.119 --> 01:44:27.019]  You are a joke!
[01:44:28.906 --> 01:44:30.987]  Just get out of my country!
[01:44:30.987 --> 01:44:31.648]  You filth!
[01:44:31.648 --> 01:44:34.230]  And you and your scumbag murderous UN!
[01:44:34.230 --> 01:44:36.451]  Yeah, you don't want to have their guns taken, do you?
[01:44:36.451 --> 01:44:38.752]  You just want my guns taken so you can have your way!
[01:44:38.752 --> 01:44:41.574]  You're an authoritarian pig posing as a liberal!
[01:44:41.574 --> 01:44:43.315]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal!
[01:44:43.315 --> 01:44:45.116]  You're no liberal!
[01:44:45.116 --> 01:44:48.058]  Stop taking names like liberal!
[01:44:48.058 --> 01:44:48.959]  I'm a liberal!
[01:44:48.959 --> 01:44:49.959]  I want freedom!
[01:44:49.959 --> 01:44:51.000]  That's liberal!
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.042]  Not you, maggot!
[01:44:54.042 --> 01:44:55.283]  Get out of my country!
[01:44:57.930 --> 01:45:01.633]  Dave in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:45:01.633 --> 01:45:03.855]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you.
[01:45:03.855 --> 01:45:04.435]  Go ahead.
[01:45:04.435 --> 01:45:10.521]  Yeah, I got a show that's on Science Channel called Dark Matters.
[01:45:10.521 --> 01:45:14.164]  I don't know if you've ever heard of it or seen it.
[01:45:14.164 --> 01:45:18.647]  This week's episode happens to be about breathwashing.
[01:45:18.647 --> 01:45:24.112]  I don't know what it's going to entail or what's going to be on it, but it looks like it might be of interest.
[01:45:27.045 --> 01:45:37.148]  Well, look, mind control is real, and we know what it looks like, and generally, I forget which one of Hera's, but one was an Air Force scientist in secret weapons, the other was in psych warfare.
[01:45:37.148 --> 01:45:49.793]  And it's like the same thing, Kaczynski's in psych warfare, volunteer for MKUltra, Real Mind Control, LA Times, you name it, I think other publications as well.
[01:45:49.793 --> 01:45:52.854]  Alexander Cockburn wrote the article for LA Times, that's how good my memory is on that.
[01:45:54.076 --> 01:46:02.338]  And then it turns out he's in a PhD Brain Interface Neurological System and all that stuff's from the Department of Defense.
[01:46:02.338 --> 01:46:04.819]  I mean, it's just always the same.
[01:46:04.819 --> 01:46:05.899]  It's always the same.
[01:46:05.899 --> 01:46:10.620]  They use these programs at universities as hatcheries for mind control.
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:11.861]  I mean, that's where they get them.
[01:46:11.861 --> 01:46:20.143]  I mean, it's just like, it's like, it's like McVeigh had the famous mind control doctor for a decade before they executed him.
[01:46:20.143 --> 01:46:20.963]  Jolly and left.
[01:46:22.912 --> 01:46:27.876]  I mean, how obvious, sir, how obvious is it that they're having the U.N.
[01:46:27.876 --> 01:46:29.257]  treaty in the next two weeks?
[01:46:29.257 --> 01:46:30.158]  How obvious is that?
[01:46:30.158 --> 01:46:34.041]  This is all just making me sick.
[01:46:34.041 --> 01:46:37.624]  All my friends are aware how much of this is really tearing into me.
[01:46:37.624 --> 01:46:45.189]  But the whole show, Dark Math, I can't even watch it most of the time because it's pretty squeamish.
[01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:46.210]  Sir, I'll have to look into it.
[01:46:46.210 --> 01:46:47.491]  I appreciate your call.
[01:46:47.491 --> 01:46:49.353]  Let's go to Kenneth in Kansas here on the air.
[01:46:51.266 --> 01:46:53.787]  Hey Alex, this is Change the Channel, Kenneth Webb.
[01:46:53.787 --> 01:46:56.529]  Hey buddy, hadn't heard from you in a while.
[01:46:56.529 --> 01:46:57.309]  How you doing?
[01:46:57.309 --> 01:46:58.590]  I'm doing good, doing good.
[01:46:58.590 --> 01:47:02.772]  I just wanted to touch base a little bit about the shooting.
[01:47:02.772 --> 01:47:05.493]  You know, my condolences go out to the family.
[01:47:05.493 --> 01:47:18.580]  It's a tragedy and all of that, but at the same time, you know, I was reading through a lot of threads, comment threads, and you know, the Second Amendment, anti-Second Amendment nuts out there are just going off about it, that this is proof
[01:47:19.318 --> 01:47:22.579]  That, you know, that we need to ban guns and all of this.
[01:47:22.579 --> 01:47:46.143]  And as I'm going through there, I see a video there of a surveillance camera down in Florida, where there's old timers in there and in the internet cafe, and an armed guy comes in there, one with a gun and the other one with a baseball bat, smashes the computer, throws the gun up, and this old timer comes out with a little .25 or something like that, wounds
[01:47:46.963 --> 01:47:55.554]  The one guy I mean it's all happened within like 10 seconds and these both of these guys are running out the door he locks the door you know until the police get there.
[01:47:55.554 --> 01:48:03.103]  Now I've seen that videos on InfoWars the other day and I forget the exact name but it was basically
[01:48:04.690 --> 01:48:07.292]  You know, man defeats robbers with a gun.
[01:48:07.292 --> 01:48:09.113]  I forget the statistic.
[01:48:09.113 --> 01:48:10.554]  I think it's 24 times?
[01:48:10.554 --> 01:48:12.716]  Or is it 21 times?
[01:48:12.716 --> 01:48:16.699]  More often, guns are used to stop crimes than they're used to end crimes.
[01:48:16.699 --> 01:48:18.240]  Look, the system knows that.
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.001]  But, I mean, what do you think about the timing of this?
[01:48:20.001 --> 01:48:23.163]  If they would stage Fast and Furious, it's real simple.
[01:48:23.163 --> 01:48:27.547]  If they would stage Fast and Furious, why wouldn't they stage this?
[01:48:27.547 --> 01:48:28.287]  Oh, definitely.
[01:48:28.287 --> 01:48:28.728]  Definitely.
[01:48:28.728 --> 01:48:31.490]  It's kind of, you know, it's a little strange that this
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:43.943]  This guy's got like a bulletproof vest on, all of this, and you know, it's like he's coming in there to do all of this, but then he just gets captured peacefully by the police.
[01:48:43.943 --> 01:48:45.604]  There you go, same M.O.
[01:48:45.604 --> 01:48:48.345]  They always get, oh my gosh, this is so insane.
[01:48:48.345 --> 01:48:52.166]  It's important at this time that we embrace that Second Amendment.
[01:48:52.166 --> 01:48:57.287]  I mean, think about if that old timer would have been in there, or some, you know, armed citizens would have been in there.
[01:48:57.287 --> 01:48:58.808]  I mean, people could have been saved.
[01:49:01.704 --> 01:49:03.164]  That's another great point.
[01:49:03.164 --> 01:49:12.986]  They had another shooting in Colorado, that church, but the guy could only shoot one person before the woman who had a concealed carry, who was there as security, pulled her gun and shot him.
[01:49:12.986 --> 01:49:14.366]  Remember that case?
[01:49:14.366 --> 01:49:21.288]  A couple years ago and it got almost no attention because she stopped him dead in his tracks.
[01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:27.029]  And that's why I think people really need to embrace the Second Amendment instead of trying to, you know, fight it.
[01:49:27.859 --> 01:49:28.820]  All of this.
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:32.122]  I did a video about it, about guns and gun control.
[01:49:32.122 --> 01:49:38.206]  I've been doing a lot of that lately because there's a lot of this stuff going down and people are like, we don't need guns and all of that.
[01:49:38.206 --> 01:49:42.729]  And I'm like, well, the world was not a peaceful place before we had guns.
[01:49:42.729 --> 01:49:45.291]  I mean, people were stabbing each other, killing each other.
[01:49:45.291 --> 01:49:46.612]  You ban guns now.
[01:49:46.612 --> 01:49:48.113]  And you know, who's going to have the guns?
[01:49:48.113 --> 01:49:48.713]  The criminals.
[01:49:48.713 --> 01:49:49.253]  That's logic.
[01:49:52.278 --> 01:50:03.625]  Well, what do you think about the weird way the New York Commissioner, knowing that it's all based, you know, in iconography with New York Commissioner up there, announcing it like, yes, we know it's the Joker, the enemy of Batman.
[01:50:03.625 --> 01:50:05.266]  These are quotes.
[01:50:05.266 --> 01:50:07.087]  And we're going to protect you from them.
[01:50:07.087 --> 01:50:09.168]  And now the public's like, protect me from the Joker.
[01:50:09.168 --> 01:50:11.709]  I mean, it's like children.
[01:50:11.709 --> 01:50:14.771]  Now we've got to probably have body scanners because of Bane.
[01:50:14.771 --> 01:50:19.093]  I was thinking TSA at the movie theaters.
[01:50:19.093 --> 01:50:21.615]  I mean, it's ridiculous that these are adults.
[01:50:22.418 --> 01:50:25.159]  And it also is an identifier of where the public is.
[01:50:25.159 --> 01:50:29.659]  I mean, that we actually, people buy this stuff and go along with it.
[01:50:29.659 --> 01:50:40.661]  They take something with huge hype like a movie and then, and again, they have somebody go in, shoot the people, grab the drugged up, uh, you know, neuroscience, uh, guy who's been missing for a while.
[01:50:40.661 --> 01:50:42.082]  It fits the entire MO.
[01:50:42.082 --> 01:50:47.082]  But I mean, look, they're trying to pass the UN Treaty right now to get our guns.
[01:50:47.082 --> 01:50:48.263]  Look at the timing!
[01:50:48.263 --> 01:50:50.303]  It's outside Columbine!
[01:50:50.583 --> 01:50:59.628]  Where we know they controlled the authorities and covered up, at bare minimum, that the SWAT team killed not one, but two of the kids, and the hundreds of bombs and all the rest of it.
[01:50:59.628 --> 01:51:02.369]  That was a government op, period.
[01:51:02.369 --> 01:51:04.430]  Healthy soils grow healthy plants.
[01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:08.112]  So before you plant your survival garden this year, is your soil healthy?

[01:53:30.988 --> 01:53:32.229]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:36.752]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:53:36.752 --> 01:53:42.516]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:53:42.516 --> 01:53:46.118]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:53:46.118 --> 01:53:48.940]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:53.843]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:54:07.446 --> 01:54:33.835]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
[01:54:37.538 --> 01:54:42.041]  Look for breaking news with Dave Mustaine over the weekend.
[01:54:42.041 --> 01:54:44.183]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:54:44.183 --> 01:54:45.464]  Megadeth.
[01:54:45.464 --> 01:54:49.006]  I'll be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:54:49.006 --> 01:54:50.367]  Central.
[01:54:50.367 --> 01:54:52.029]  Got a whole other hour plus coming up.
[01:54:52.029 --> 01:54:54.150]  A lot of other news.
[01:54:54.150 --> 01:54:57.172]  Ladies and gentlemen, I tell you what I really think, okay?
[01:54:57.172 --> 01:55:00.215]  And I think this was a staged event.
[01:55:00.215 --> 01:55:02.676]  In fact, I know it was.
[01:55:02.676 --> 01:55:04.598]  My gut tells me it was a staged event.
[01:55:06.676 --> 01:55:16.540]  Of course he was in some advanced mind interface computer system and I test that stuff out on the people that are in the PhD programs.
[01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:26.204]  I've seen it over and over again, not just with the Unabomber being in a CIA program as a PhD, MKUltra, but so many others.
[01:55:26.204 --> 01:55:36.068]  They would use doctor programs and psychologists, the CIA would, with people's young children and then say, let us, you know, your child has problems, let us commit them.
[01:55:37.148 --> 01:55:40.889]  And then they would even stage their deaths and take the kid and reprogram them.
[01:55:40.889 --> 01:55:42.750]  This is on History Channel.
[01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:44.930]  This is mainline, this is declassified.
[01:55:44.930 --> 01:55:48.711]  Look up Dr. Ewing Cameron.
[01:55:48.711 --> 01:55:54.693]  I've studied it so I know what it looks like, and then I know for some of the general public, they're like, well, how do you know?
[01:55:54.693 --> 01:55:58.454]  Of course, actually, almost everybody I see out there is going, no, no, no.
[01:55:58.454 --> 01:56:00.034]  I mean, yeah, they're about to try to pass the U.N.
[01:56:00.034 --> 01:56:00.254]  thing.
[01:56:00.254 --> 01:56:01.155]  They can't.
[01:56:01.155 --> 01:56:02.295]  Obama was right on it.
[01:56:04.163 --> 01:56:15.808]  You know, the way that they were hyping this in the Dark Knight Rises, all of this just makes my head spin, quite frankly.
[01:56:15.808 --> 01:56:17.129]  They are coming after our guns.
[01:56:17.129 --> 01:56:26.073]  You've noticed the last three weeks, I've just been Second Amendment, Second Amendment, Second Amendment, because the analysis has been done by the Washington Times, by even Forbes.
[01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:39.233]  We've had our expert, Bob Dacey, probably one of the best out there as he researches it constantly, New American, Second Amendment writer, he writes for New America on that, and on SPP, and I mean, they plan to take our guns.
[01:56:39.233 --> 01:56:44.594]  And this may create copycats, that's the thing, that's mind control.
[01:56:44.594 --> 01:56:56.557]  The fact that movies can make people do this and the police know there may be copycats, that's actually not fear-mongering to have some police out, or at least have people on the lookout, because you probably will have copycats.
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:01.041]  Of the staged event.
[01:57:01.041 --> 01:57:02.763]  It's called priming the pump.
[01:57:02.763 --> 01:57:06.927]  Now, if they try to keep them out there permanently, that was the excuse to take over.
[01:57:06.927 --> 01:57:10.690]  Just like they're saying, TSA, to be at movie theaters and shopping malls.
[01:57:10.690 --> 01:57:12.852]  That news is six years old, they wanted that.
[01:57:12.852 --> 01:57:14.033]  And now it's happening.
[01:57:14.033 --> 01:57:15.614]  Now they're at the shopping malls.
[01:57:15.614 --> 01:57:20.298]  Two years ago, the new TSA PSAs show them at shopping malls and football games.
[01:57:20.298 --> 01:57:25.163]  Our TSA, our TSA, the globalist TSA, is going to England to grope them.
[01:57:27.051 --> 01:57:28.932]  It's all happening.
[01:57:28.932 --> 01:57:34.033]  Or you can't go to a movie theater, because villains will pop out.
[01:57:34.033 --> 01:57:36.454]  Oh man, I tell you, this is just so sophisticated.
[01:57:36.454 --> 01:57:40.715]  This is so sophisticated.
[01:57:40.715 --> 01:57:42.636]  And I've witnessed it over and over again.
[01:57:42.636 --> 01:57:50.218]  You're at these events, you learn about them, and they announce a real terror attack in Belton, and then the next day say it wasn't real, and then nobody gets in trouble for that?
[01:57:50.218 --> 01:57:52.219]  I mean, I have witnessed them do this.
[01:57:53.328 --> 01:57:59.956]  Remember to support us also, our sponsors, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, 15-day free trials every single night.
[01:57:59.956 --> 01:58:01.758]  We're trying to build our organization.
[01:58:01.758 --> 01:58:05.762]  We're expending the capital we have, so we need more capital to come in.
[01:58:05.762 --> 01:58:13.872]  We need to be strong going into the face of this, having George Soros and White House groups with actual White House staff saying, we need to be shut down, we need to have our funding cut.
[01:58:15.316 --> 01:58:17.937]  They're coming after us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:17.937 --> 01:58:19.157]  We are the tip of the spear.
[01:58:19.157 --> 01:58:22.758]  I more and more agree with Joseph Farrow that they're just coming after us.
[01:58:22.758 --> 01:58:24.018]  So, we're here for you.
[01:58:24.018 --> 01:58:27.298]  We got a good chance of beating them, because we understand their game plan.
[01:58:27.298 --> 01:58:29.619]  We're gonna go right at them.
[01:58:29.619 --> 01:58:32.039]  So, PrisonPlanet.tv, got a 15-day free trial.

[02:00:06.721 --> 02:00:11.584]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.584 --> 02:00:13.164]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.164 --> 02:00:14.725]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.725 --> 02:00:18.907]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.907 --> 02:00:24.590]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.590 --> 02:00:34.656]  Alright, we're into hour number three.
[02:00:36.212 --> 02:00:37.853]  And I was just talking to CJ in there.
[02:00:37.853 --> 02:00:38.934]  I said, what's your concern here?
[02:00:38.934 --> 02:00:48.361]  He goes, the moment I saw this staged, how it was the premiere, how it's going to just make them, you know, basically sell more tickets, how we saw the pre-hype.
[02:00:48.361 --> 02:00:52.384]  And he said, it's only a matter of hours till the firefighters get into his computers.
[02:00:52.384 --> 02:00:59.870]  And just like when Richard Poplosky killed those three cops, he was a white supremacist who was constantly attacking me everywhere.
[02:01:01.158 --> 02:01:12.083]  That calling for violence against me we later discovered and they have the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, local writer, within one hour of them getting his computer.
[02:01:12.083 --> 02:01:14.244]  Come out and say he did it for Alex Jones.
[02:01:15.930 --> 02:01:20.094]  Turned out his computer had thousands, I saw the court records, I made them all retract.
[02:01:20.094 --> 02:01:24.658]  Thousands of websites he'd visited, including Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:01:24.658 --> 02:01:29.542]  I mean, my website's bigger than MSNBC and CNBC.com combined.
[02:01:29.542 --> 02:01:32.184]  I mean, gee, do you think somebody might have visited it?
[02:01:32.184 --> 02:01:38.390]  So, every time Nightline, every time anybody's here, they say, you're going to cause violence.
[02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.971]  I'm like, really?
[02:01:39.949 --> 02:01:40.209]  Really?
[02:01:40.209 --> 02:01:41.450]  I need to be shut down because of that?
[02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:43.031]  I'm going to talk about it after the break.
[02:01:43.031 --> 02:01:44.793]  Let's just go to your calls right now.
[02:01:44.793 --> 02:01:53.860]  And absolutely, when they get into those computers, it is a very good chance that I'm going to be blamed for this.
[02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:55.081]  And I'm not looking forward to it.
[02:01:55.081 --> 02:01:56.382]  It's happened a whole bunch.
[02:01:56.382 --> 02:01:58.944]  They tried to blame me for the Gifford stuff until it came out.
[02:01:58.944 --> 02:02:00.585]  He was a big Democrat.
[02:02:00.585 --> 02:02:01.686]  He liked to dress up as a woman.
[02:02:01.686 --> 02:02:02.547]  I'm not saying he's bad.
[02:02:02.547 --> 02:02:03.328]  He liked to do that.
[02:02:03.328 --> 02:02:07.431]  I mean, the point is, is that, you know, he's a guy who hated Republicans and dressed up as a woman.
[02:02:08.499 --> 02:02:11.261]  I'm not responsible for that, okay?
[02:02:11.261 --> 02:02:13.343]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Colorado.
[02:02:13.343 --> 02:02:14.223]  Robert, you're on the air.
[02:02:14.223 --> 02:02:15.424]  Welcome.
[02:02:15.424 --> 02:02:17.866]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[02:02:17.866 --> 02:02:20.148]  I'm a little bit dry right now, if you can bear with me.
[02:02:20.148 --> 02:02:21.329]  I've been up all night.
[02:02:21.329 --> 02:02:24.091]  People have been calling me all night long.
[02:02:24.091 --> 02:02:28.974]  I used to be a former A6 driver 27 years ago.
[02:02:28.974 --> 02:02:32.337]  My new Eric Harris's father, he was an F4 Phantom driver.
[02:02:33.484 --> 02:02:45.602]  Um, the Columbine situation, uh, I had guys that I knew, young guys, uh, when they were on the SWAT team, and uh, they were already stacked to go in 20 minutes after that shooting.
[02:02:45.602 --> 02:02:47.705]  And they were told to stand down.
[02:02:47.705 --> 02:02:47.946]  Alright?
[02:02:48.905 --> 02:02:51.886]  And they weren't allowed to breach Columbine for five hours afterwards.
[02:02:51.886 --> 02:02:53.126]  No, that came out in the news.
[02:02:53.126 --> 02:02:55.966]  I interviewed the editor of the Rocky Mountain News.
[02:02:55.966 --> 02:03:00.807]  It was in the news that the police shot some of the kids and that there were other shooters inside.
[02:03:00.807 --> 02:03:06.649]  I mean, well, I don't know what police it was, but it wasn't SWAT because I knew I knew two guys were on SWAT.
[02:03:06.649 --> 02:03:07.529]  They're my personal friends.
[02:03:07.529 --> 02:03:09.789]  They were they never even fired a shot that day.
[02:03:09.789 --> 02:03:11.190]  They were already stacked.
[02:03:11.190 --> 02:03:15.130]  They were stacked 10 deep to go in 20 minutes after that thing happened.
[02:03:15.130 --> 02:03:17.471]  And they were told to stand down and back off.
[02:03:17.771 --> 02:03:18.571]  I guess so.
[02:03:18.571 --> 02:03:20.612]  More people could bleed to death that way, I guess.
[02:03:20.612 --> 02:03:22.873]  A higher death number for Clinton.
[02:03:22.873 --> 02:03:26.595]  I don't know, but this kind of reminded me what went down last night.
[02:03:26.595 --> 02:03:29.516]  Like I said, I've been up for almost 22 hours, so I'm a little groggy.
[02:03:29.516 --> 02:03:32.558]  But, like I said, I'm a former A6 driver.
[02:03:32.558 --> 02:03:38.800]  I know, trust me, your whole 9-11 scenario is correct.
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:43.702]  I was involved in the FAA for many years out in Denver.
[02:03:43.702 --> 02:03:43.983]  Yes.
[02:03:45.916 --> 02:03:46.877]  I don't know.
[02:03:46.877 --> 02:03:49.099]  There's not really a deep underground base there.
[02:03:49.099 --> 02:03:55.564]  There's a terminal station that'll take you out to Cheyenne Mountain and out to Buckley.
[02:03:55.564 --> 02:03:56.886]  That's basically where they run.
[02:03:56.886 --> 02:03:59.628]  There's a lot of rail tracks under the ground.
[02:03:59.628 --> 02:04:02.931]  The whole airport's really a physical disaster when you get underneath it.
[02:04:03.931 --> 02:04:07.774]  I was involved at TSA at its inception.
[02:04:07.774 --> 02:04:10.776]  Massive criminal corruption from the beginning.
[02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:17.440]  There were guys that, one guy was the Federal Security Director, who was a former Lieutenant Colonel.
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:20.702]  He was already sucking down one retirement check.
[02:04:20.702 --> 02:04:24.924]  And then he got another one for just being the FSD, Federal Security Director, for five years.
[02:04:24.924 --> 02:04:27.046]  And he made $185,000 a year and sucked down 90% of that pension.
[02:04:31.078 --> 02:04:32.940]  Well, I tell you what, stay there.
[02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:34.041]  Don't hang up.
[02:04:34.041 --> 02:04:47.912]  Robert, I want to come back and get your take on what happened last night, because you've already talked about Columbine, which CBS News reported there was 127 bombs they brought inside in front of the police that morning, and then the school's half empty.
[02:04:47.912 --> 02:04:50.034]  But there's nothing to worry about, nothing suspicious.
[02:04:50.034 --> 02:04:50.435]  Stay there.
[02:04:50.435 --> 02:04:56.340]  I want to come back and get your take, sir, on what happened last night, because you were saying you had similar concerns.
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:57.461]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:05:02.216 --> 02:05:07.718]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:05:07.718 --> 02:05:10.119]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:05:10.119 --> 02:05:19.221]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:19.221 --> 02:05:22.683]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:05:22.683 --> 02:05:24.343]  There's no priming required.
[02:05:24.343 --> 02:05:26.624]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:05:26.624 --> 02:05:29.125]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:05:30.205 --> 02:05:31.726]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:05:31.726 --> 02:05:33.147]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:05:33.147 --> 02:05:36.308]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:05:36.308 --> 02:05:39.690]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:05:39.690 --> 02:05:43.832]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:05:43.832 --> 02:05:46.574]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:05:46.574 --> 02:05:48.134]  It's what my family uses.
[02:05:48.134 --> 02:05:51.456]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:05:51.456 --> 02:05:56.719]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[02:06:12.182 --> 02:06:16.242]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[02:07:01.816 --> 02:07:03.097]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:03.097 --> 02:07:08.682]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:07:08.682 --> 02:07:13.707]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:07:13.707 --> 02:07:18.752]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:07:19.272 --> 02:07:24.496]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:07:24.496 --> 02:07:26.797]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:07:26.797 --> 02:07:31.600]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:32.721]  And here's the best part.
[02:07:32.721 --> 02:07:35.803]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:07:35.803 --> 02:07:39.426]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:07:39.426 --> 02:07:42.608]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:07:42.608 --> 02:07:44.829]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:07:44.829 --> 02:07:45.750]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:07:49.392 --> 02:07:52.355]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:07:52.355 --> 02:07:58.461]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:07:58.461 --> 02:08:03.526]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:08:03.526 --> 02:08:10.153]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:10.153 --> 02:08:13.136]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.983 --> 02:08:30.866]  Okay, we're taking your phone calls and then I'm going to talk about the fact that the Democratic Party and others that are collaborators with the globalists in the UN are openly saying they want to restrict our gun rights now and want the UN treaty signed to restrict our rights.
[02:08:30.866 --> 02:08:35.727]  To kill opposition, they said, don't worry, it doesn't take your rights, don't run, we're your friends.
[02:08:35.727 --> 02:08:36.608]  Everything's fine.
[02:08:36.608 --> 02:08:38.728]  Hands up, though.
[02:08:38.728 --> 02:08:41.308]  Well, now they're just moving forward to want to ban our guns.
[02:08:41.308 --> 02:08:42.909]  So, here you have it.
[02:08:42.909 --> 02:08:43.389]  It happened.
[02:08:45.287 --> 02:08:48.488]  But there are a lot of mainstream articles saying, hey, we have a very violent culture.
[02:08:48.488 --> 02:08:54.711]  We have a lot of violence in the movies, a lot of glorification of it, and the studies show that's what's really causing this.
[02:08:54.711 --> 02:08:57.653]  Yes, it's not the guns killing people.
[02:08:57.653 --> 02:09:00.734]  It's the fact that I would not want to be a police officer nowadays.
[02:09:00.734 --> 02:09:02.555]  You know, we see a lot of bad cops now.
[02:09:03.865 --> 02:09:05.547]  There's a lot of good ones as well.
[02:09:05.547 --> 02:09:07.269]  A lot of good ones, because I meet them and talk to them.
[02:09:07.269 --> 02:09:09.090]  But there are a lot of bad ones.
[02:09:09.090 --> 02:09:12.073]  Because the system wants corrupt people and thugs in there.
[02:09:12.073 --> 02:09:15.517]  And they've got a bigger pool from this degenerating culture.
[02:09:15.517 --> 02:09:16.618]  It's not just here.
[02:09:16.618 --> 02:09:23.065]  All over the world, the test scores, the health, the work ethic, the families, it's all disintegrating.
[02:09:25.438 --> 02:09:28.860]  What's upstanding today is just average 50 years ago.
[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:36.144]  I mean, people are lazy, they're stupid, they're not paying attention, and they're downright evil.
[02:09:36.144 --> 02:09:48.591]  And I'm not talking about everybody, but the percentage of slobs, the percentage of people that don't know how to do... I mean, look, compared to my dad, I don't know how to fix anything.
[02:09:48.591 --> 02:09:51.273]  Compared to his dad, he doesn't know how to fix a lot of stuff.
[02:09:53.593 --> 02:09:56.797]  I mean, it's just, people are getting dependent.
[02:09:56.797 --> 02:09:58.519]  And we're getting specialized, too.
[02:09:58.519 --> 02:09:59.701]  We're only good at certain things.
[02:10:02.423 --> 02:10:05.904]  It's a very scary scenario, that's all I can say.
[02:10:05.904 --> 02:10:11.386]  And you know the TSA, they're saying TSA-type checkpoints now to be everywhere to stop mass shootings.
[02:10:11.386 --> 02:10:16.187]  Which, statistically, Kurt Nemo's got a great article up there at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:16.187 --> 02:10:28.051]  Statistically, well he's got the numbers, you've got a very much better chance of just rare forms of death than you do from mass shootings.
[02:10:28.051 --> 02:10:28.851]  I mean, shootings!
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:31.704]  Is way down the line.
[02:10:31.704 --> 02:10:33.027]  Most years it's like number 10, 11, 12, 13.
[02:10:35.652 --> 02:10:38.814]  It varies year to year in the World Almanac.
[02:10:38.814 --> 02:10:51.781]  And guys, will you pull up causes of death, number one cause of, or like top causes of unnatural death, and just, I mean, I forget the exact search that'll pull it up, but just watch.
[02:10:51.781 --> 02:10:54.582]  Just like I know on average there's five great white deaths a year.
[02:10:54.582 --> 02:10:57.804]  Sometimes there's two, sometimes there's seven, but on average it's five.
[02:10:57.804 --> 02:11:00.566]  Total shark attacks, it's about a dozen every year.
[02:11:00.566 --> 02:11:01.006]  Sometimes big,
[02:11:02.947 --> 02:11:05.255]  Makos, elite people occasionally, or um...
[02:11:07.199 --> 02:11:09.819]  Big tigers sometimes have a little snack.
[02:11:09.819 --> 02:11:11.900]  Tigers will actually eat you.
[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:14.040]  A great white bites you and almost always lets go.
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:18.041]  A tiger or a mako will actually take you in and have a snack.
[02:11:18.041 --> 02:11:29.783]  In fact, sometimes they like you rotten, so they'll take you and cram you under some mangroves, wait till you get a little bit more tasty, kind of like a crocodile will do, and then come back later for the delicious snack.
[02:11:29.783 --> 02:11:35.544]  But there's some amazing videos on YouTube of guys hand-feeding giant tiger sharks, like 14 feet long.
[02:11:36.604 --> 02:11:38.786]  And they go there every day and bring tourists.
[02:11:38.786 --> 02:11:40.528]  It's in the Caribbean, I forget where.
[02:11:40.528 --> 02:11:45.154]  And they hand-feed these giant... And they're like dogs.
[02:11:45.154 --> 02:11:47.196]  They come over and wag their tails, get all excited.
[02:11:47.196 --> 02:11:49.859]  The guys are sitting there hand-feeding them.
[02:11:49.859 --> 02:11:53.343]  The point is, is that I'm digressing and I guess there is no point.
[02:11:56.269 --> 02:12:00.713]  That mass shootings are incredibly rare.
[02:12:00.713 --> 02:12:05.857]  And when you have mass shootings that aren't staged, they get no attention.
[02:12:05.857 --> 02:12:09.901]  Like, there's actually been mass shootings in Virginia and other areas of police.
[02:12:09.901 --> 02:12:19.790]  And boy, let me tell you, when somebody goes in a police station and shoots ten cops and kills four or five of them, like they did in Fairfax County, Virginia, it didn't get any attention.
[02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:20.590]  Because that was real.
[02:12:21.604 --> 02:12:27.009]  And they don't want real, again, you know when it's staged because of the hype.
[02:12:27.009 --> 02:12:30.171]  You know by the propaganda and the way it's pushed.
[02:12:30.171 --> 02:12:38.759]  And that's the coup de grace or the cherry on top, that's the plastic cherry on top, is that
[02:12:42.264 --> 02:12:44.065]  Is the response, the timing, the U.N.
[02:12:44.065 --> 02:12:45.325]  treaty, all of it.
[02:12:45.325 --> 02:12:46.466]  It's fake.
[02:12:46.466 --> 02:12:47.646]  It's classic.
[02:12:47.646 --> 02:12:48.267]  The M.O.
[02:12:48.267 --> 02:12:53.249]  is, this guy was drugged, we know from other Manchurian candidates, probably didn't even do the shooting.
[02:12:53.249 --> 02:12:55.411]  Has been probably tortured off and on for months.
[02:12:55.411 --> 02:12:56.071]  He's disappeared.
[02:12:56.071 --> 02:12:57.152]  Hadn't talked to mommy.
[02:12:57.152 --> 02:12:59.833]  He's in this big neurological brain interface Ph.D.
[02:12:59.833 --> 02:13:00.273]  program.
[02:13:00.273 --> 02:13:01.974]  That's classically where they get him.
[02:13:01.974 --> 02:13:02.895]  He disappears.
[02:13:02.895 --> 02:13:04.756]  I'm going to go to Robert here in just a minute.
[02:13:05.556 --> 02:13:07.700]  Talking to myself here, I realize I gotta shut up.
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:08.642]  It's just so incredible.
[02:13:08.642 --> 02:13:12.570]  I mean, I'm trying to give you all the data points of why I know this is staged.
[02:13:12.570 --> 02:13:14.814]  I mean, it's just hundreds of them.
[02:13:14.814 --> 02:13:14.934]  And...
[02:13:17.247 --> 02:13:18.887]  50 most common causes of death.
[02:13:18.887 --> 02:13:20.328]  Yeah, but that's got natural ones.
[02:13:20.328 --> 02:13:21.769]  Cardiovascular disease.
[02:13:21.769 --> 02:13:22.229]  That's okay.
[02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.650]  Keep going.
[02:13:22.650 --> 02:13:23.470]  It's fine.
[02:13:23.470 --> 02:13:24.431]  Infectious disease.
[02:13:24.431 --> 02:13:24.871]  Stroke.
[02:13:24.871 --> 02:13:26.712]  Low respiratory tract infection.
[02:13:26.712 --> 02:13:28.153]  Respiratory disease.
[02:13:28.153 --> 02:13:28.493]  AIDS.
[02:13:28.493 --> 02:13:30.834]  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
[02:13:30.834 --> 02:13:31.775]  Tuberculosis.
[02:13:31.775 --> 02:13:32.455]  Malaria.
[02:13:32.455 --> 02:13:34.376]  Lung cancer.
[02:13:34.376 --> 02:13:35.657]  Diabetes.
[02:13:35.657 --> 02:13:36.677]  Suicide.
[02:13:36.677 --> 02:13:38.338]  Oh yeah, especially if you're in the military.
[02:13:38.338 --> 02:13:41.000]  Stomach cancer.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:41.760]  And it just goes on.
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:42.200]  Keep going.
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:43.001]  We're going to find the guns.
[02:13:43.683 --> 02:13:48.907]  I think guns are the 10th, 11th, or 12th, depending on the year, it varies, of unnatural.
[02:13:48.907 --> 02:13:51.248]  These are medical things.
[02:13:51.248 --> 02:13:57.792]  The search is causes of unnatural death.
[02:13:57.792 --> 02:14:06.879]  And it's going to be automobile accidents, and then it's going to be hospitals with bad prescriptions, and then it's going to be hospital infections.
[02:14:07.921 --> 02:14:08.821]  Look these up, folks.
[02:14:08.821 --> 02:14:11.762]  This is what I do all day, is study statistician numbers.
[02:14:11.762 --> 02:14:13.643]  Because I want to know real reality.
[02:14:13.643 --> 02:14:16.163]  Okay, let's... I'm going to shut up here.
[02:14:16.163 --> 02:14:17.244]  We got law in Colorado.
[02:14:17.244 --> 02:14:19.584]  That might be one of the We Are Change guys I know.
[02:14:19.584 --> 02:14:20.885]  But let's finish up with Robert.
[02:14:20.885 --> 02:14:23.565]  Robert, you're saying you're formerly in the military.
[02:14:23.565 --> 02:14:25.086]  You know a lot of the guys are on the SWAT team.
[02:14:25.606 --> 02:14:26.826]  Like I said, I've been up all night.
[02:14:26.826 --> 02:14:28.907]  I got a cousin named Al, too, and we were talking about this all night.
[02:14:28.907 --> 02:14:30.068]  I'm almost 50, so I'm an old-timer.
[02:14:49.727 --> 02:15:00.392]  We used to take our boys to that theater a couple years ago when they were really young, still in high school, and there was a heavy police presence always at that theater, alright?
[02:15:00.392 --> 02:15:05.854]  Every premiere night through Thursday, Friday, Saturday, there was always a heavy police presence.
[02:15:05.854 --> 02:15:10.036]  So, you know, we were talking this morning about it, and I said, where were the cops at?
[02:15:10.973 --> 02:15:15.076]  You know, there were always at least eight Aurora cops in the city.
[02:15:15.076 --> 02:15:16.658]  This is one of those mega theaters.
[02:15:16.658 --> 02:15:19.880]  Whenever I go to one of those, any night of the week, there's at least two cops.
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:23.864]  But if you go on a premiere night, there might be five or six, like you said.
[02:15:23.864 --> 02:15:34.392]  Oh, there's always not even that because, you know, it's predominantly, let me put it this way, it's predominantly in a black neighborhood and there's always shootings that go down up there.
[02:15:34.392 --> 02:15:35.894]  All right.
[02:15:35.894 --> 02:15:36.034]  And,
[02:15:36.810 --> 02:15:40.131]  When I found this out, when I'm looking at this, I'm like, wait a minute.
[02:15:40.131 --> 02:15:43.332]  You know, this couldn't have possibly happened the way it said it did.
[02:15:43.332 --> 02:15:54.614]  And then now I come to find out the shooter, who's a white guy, who apparently lives in a predominantly black apartment complex, very close to this, and is booby trapped.
[02:15:54.614 --> 02:15:56.355]  Now, what are the odds of that?
[02:15:56.355 --> 02:15:59.275]  And he tells the police that it's booby trapped.
[02:15:59.275 --> 02:16:04.077]  And then his mother comes out and says, well, I knew my son was going to do that.
[02:16:04.077 --> 02:16:05.437]  This makes no sense to me, Alex.
[02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:11.291]  What about him being in a, because I've been to these different university departments at UT and others.
[02:16:11.291 --> 02:16:13.532]  Over 90% of them are funded by the Department of Defense.
[02:16:13.532 --> 02:16:14.912]  We're looking into it now.
[02:16:14.912 --> 02:16:21.555]  Preliminary, this program he was part of was an advanced DARPA-funded mind interface.
[02:16:21.555 --> 02:16:23.256]  In fact, guys, put that article back up for me.
[02:16:23.256 --> 02:16:24.256]  It's out of the Associated Press.
[02:16:24.256 --> 02:16:25.617]  It's also on Yahoo!
[02:16:25.617 --> 02:16:26.457]  Program.
[02:16:26.457 --> 02:16:29.878]  That's exactly where they recruit the patsies out of.
[02:16:29.878 --> 02:16:31.159]  I mean, I've seen this before.
[02:16:32.638 --> 02:16:53.905]  I'm a black man, so I'm just saying, why would a white guy be living in a predominantly black apartment complex and then go into a predominantly black theater and shoot people up?
[02:16:53.905 --> 02:16:57.807]  Maybe this could be what you're saying about, you know, the race thing that's coming down here too.
[02:16:57.807 --> 02:16:58.947]  You know, the provocateur for this.
[02:17:01.988 --> 02:17:17.698]  Oh wow, they start exactly, because I gotta tell you, I just looked at the Trayvon Martin thing, and the Zimmerman deal, opened and looked at it, and it turned out they knew, his head was bashed in, his nose was broken, he went out and said, what are you doing?
[02:17:17.698 --> 02:17:22.621]  And Martin beat him up, had split, white guys, black guys kill each other, whatever.
[02:17:22.621 --> 02:17:27.544]  The point is, this stuff goes on, and then they did all that, and then the Justice Department tried to hype it.
[02:17:28.590 --> 02:17:35.214]  And then MSNBC edited the tape to say he's a black guy, get him, when the full tape is like, well, what color is he?
[02:17:35.214 --> 02:17:36.214]  Well, I think he's black.
[02:17:36.214 --> 02:17:40.157]  I mean, the whole thing was a psyop, and you're right.
[02:17:40.157 --> 02:17:46.460]  Oh, and wow, they are saying that this, so you're saying you live in the area, and I know some of the victims were black.
[02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:52.024]  Oh my gosh, if they come out with that angle, holy mackerel, when they get into his computers, because we know.
[02:17:53.084 --> 02:17:56.367]  Oh man, it could be that.
[02:17:56.367 --> 02:17:59.789]  Let me chime in on Trayvon Martin for a minute.
[02:17:59.789 --> 02:18:05.573]  I lived in Florida too, and I was stationed down there.
[02:18:05.573 --> 02:18:13.439]  You said you grew up in Dallas, which is bad enough, but I mean, Florida is a really redneck, racist area to live in.
[02:18:14.850 --> 02:18:16.232]  You know, I don't know.
[02:18:16.232 --> 02:18:17.713]  You know, him and the kid got into it.
[02:18:17.713 --> 02:18:24.401]  My whole point with Trayvon Martin is, if you wouldn't have put yourself in that position, you wouldn't have had to shoot that kid.
[02:18:24.401 --> 02:18:25.983]  Why would you follow that boy?
[02:18:25.983 --> 02:18:26.744]  Why would you follow him?
[02:18:26.744 --> 02:18:31.589]  Well sure, my point is we know the government, the media took it and tried to get a race conflict going.
[02:18:32.199 --> 02:18:33.920]  That's my point.
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:35.041]  Yes, exactly.
[02:18:35.041 --> 02:18:35.842]  That's what I'm trying.
[02:18:35.842 --> 02:18:36.563]  You know what?
[02:18:36.563 --> 02:18:40.246]  And we've got this programmed media here in town.
[02:18:40.246 --> 02:18:41.607]  This is FEMA Region 8.
[02:18:41.607 --> 02:18:43.328]  This is your default capital right here.
[02:18:43.328 --> 02:18:44.029]  You know where this is.
[02:18:44.029 --> 02:18:45.250]  This is Crystal Palace, baby.
[02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:47.271]  This is it.
[02:18:47.271 --> 02:18:50.854]  Why do you think it happened literally right down the road from Columbine?
[02:18:50.854 --> 02:18:52.415]  I mean, how suspicious is that?
[02:18:52.415 --> 02:18:53.656]  And then right before the U.N.
[02:18:53.656 --> 02:18:54.917]  treaty?
[02:18:54.917 --> 02:18:57.500]  Well, really, it's not down the road from Columbine.
[02:18:57.500 --> 02:18:57.940]  It's about
[02:18:58.482 --> 02:19:02.565]  You know, you grew up in Dallas, so I figured it's from Dallas to Plano.
[02:19:02.565 --> 02:19:06.667]  But it's about 30, Littleton's about 35 miles from where this happened.
[02:19:06.667 --> 02:19:14.272]  But this is six miles away from Buckley Air, no, five miles, not even five, four miles away from Buckley Air Force Base.
[02:19:14.272 --> 02:19:14.833]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:19:15.817 --> 02:19:19.658]  I don't trust anything that happened out here the last night.
[02:19:19.658 --> 02:19:23.459]  I think this whole thing was staged and planned.
[02:19:23.459 --> 02:19:25.240]  The guys don't get gas masks.
[02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:26.620]  Where are you going to get a gas mask from?
[02:19:26.620 --> 02:19:28.681]  Where are you going to get tear gas canisters?
[02:19:28.681 --> 02:19:30.002]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:19:30.002 --> 02:19:33.142]  And then you have a booby-trapped house.
[02:19:33.142 --> 02:19:33.843]  The house.
[02:19:33.843 --> 02:19:37.764]  And then the guy says, well, I booby-trapped my house so the police can't get in it.
[02:19:38.183 --> 02:19:38.703]  Who does that?
[02:19:38.703 --> 02:19:42.786]  And they always do that so only the feds can get in and find what they want.
[02:19:42.786 --> 02:19:43.967]  Wow, really great points.
[02:19:43.967 --> 02:19:45.988]  Thank you so much, Robert.
[02:19:45.988 --> 02:19:48.670]  Law from Colorado, you're up next.
[02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:49.610]  I think I know Law.
[02:19:49.610 --> 02:19:50.571]  This is very interesting.
[02:19:50.571 --> 02:19:51.432]  His name is Law.
[02:19:51.432 --> 02:20:00.818]  You can see Luke on his shoulders bullhorning Chris Matthews in the extras of the Obama deception after they attacked me with a knife and cut my bullhorn.
[02:20:02.332 --> 02:20:03.633]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:03.633 --> 02:20:09.216]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:09.216 --> 02:20:14.238]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:14.238 --> 02:20:14.718]  It's true.
[02:20:14.718 --> 02:20:19.261]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:20:19.801 --> 02:20:25.025]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[02:24:09.139 --> 02:24:15.420]  I hurt myself today.
[02:24:15.420 --> 02:24:19.701]  I hurt myself today.
[02:24:19.701 --> 02:24:21.081]  See if I still feel.
[02:24:21.081 --> 02:24:24.181]  See if I still feel.
[02:24:24.181 --> 02:24:26.022]  I focused.
[02:24:26.022 --> 02:24:26.962]  I focused.
[02:24:28.141 --> 02:24:29.562]  On the pain.
[02:24:29.562 --> 02:24:31.424]  The only thing.
[02:24:31.424 --> 02:24:34.807]  The only thing that's real.
[02:24:34.807 --> 02:24:36.668]  The needle tears a hole.
[02:24:36.668 --> 02:24:40.091]  The needle tears a hole.
[02:24:40.091 --> 02:24:42.093]  The old familiar sting.
[02:24:42.093 --> 02:24:45.375]  The old familiar sting.
[02:24:45.375 --> 02:24:46.857]  I try to kill it.
[02:24:46.857 --> 02:24:50.720]  Try to kill it all away.
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:51.981]  But I remember.
[02:24:51.981 --> 02:24:55.544]  But I remember everything.
[02:24:56.909 --> 02:25:01.433]  What have I become?
[02:25:01.433 --> 02:25:03.454]  My sweetest friend.
[02:25:08.955 --> 02:25:13.777]  And you could have it all.
[02:25:13.777 --> 02:25:18.498]  My empire of dirt.
[02:25:18.498 --> 02:25:21.079]  I will let you in.
[02:25:21.079 --> 02:25:24.020]  I will make you hurt.
[02:25:38.729 --> 02:25:48.694]  All these people that sell their souls to control others and study the science of the mind and use it to shudder intellects instead of empowering humanity.
[02:25:48.694 --> 02:25:53.357]  They do rule an empire of dirt.
[02:25:53.357 --> 02:25:56.839]  And that's why they try to hype up evil and ugliness is so beautiful.
[02:25:56.839 --> 02:26:01.441]  They're trying to turn our atmosphere politically, spiritually into what they are.
[02:26:01.441 --> 02:26:03.042]  It is a kingdom of psychopaths.
[02:26:05.103 --> 02:26:06.824]  And they are reporting multiple shooters.
[02:26:06.824 --> 02:26:08.025]  That got, uh, corrected.
[02:26:08.025 --> 02:26:13.129]  Uh, they are reporting he went through a theater door that, by the way, are hinged to open out.
[02:26:13.129 --> 02:26:14.370]  Have giant metal hinges.
[02:26:14.370 --> 02:26:17.612]  You can't... They're sunk into the doors.
[02:26:17.612 --> 02:26:19.293]  There's giant metal around them.
[02:26:19.293 --> 02:26:20.814]  It's not like it's going this way.
[02:26:20.814 --> 02:26:23.536]  It goes this way only.
[02:26:23.536 --> 02:26:25.938]  It would take a gorilla to get through that.
[02:26:25.938 --> 02:26:27.239]  Oh, but he kicked it in!
[02:26:27.239 --> 02:26:28.860]  Oh, really?
[02:26:30.362 --> 02:26:34.343]  Really, I've tried to knock down a big door, getting sick of it being locked, a big wooden door.
[02:26:34.343 --> 02:26:36.084]  Let me tell you, it's hard.
[02:26:36.084 --> 02:26:39.064]  It's hard when you've got a couple locks in wood.
[02:26:39.064 --> 02:26:47.367]  Not going through metal, it takes a battering ram.
[02:26:47.367 --> 02:26:51.248]  I'm tempted to... It's so weird, I was looking to be in Colorado at this time, but I didn't go.
[02:26:51.248 --> 02:26:54.588]  Let's go ahead and talk to Law in Colorado.
[02:26:54.588 --> 02:26:56.449]  Is this Law, the We Are Changer?
[02:26:57.608 --> 02:26:58.389]  Hello, Alex.
[02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:59.870]  Why, yes it is, my friend.
[02:26:59.870 --> 02:27:00.610]  How are you?
[02:27:00.610 --> 02:27:01.031]  I'm good.
[02:27:01.031 --> 02:27:03.373]  What do you make of all this?
[02:27:03.373 --> 02:27:05.254]  Well, this is very interesting.
[02:27:05.254 --> 02:27:10.278]  Everything on our end definitely indicates a false flag type attack.
[02:27:10.278 --> 02:27:12.460]  I sent some info to your tipster, guys.
[02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:22.848]  A guy named Bill Warner out of Sarasota, Florida, reports that the black, the James Holmes, the shooter, was actually a member of the Black Block.
[02:27:22.848 --> 02:27:27.112]  And whether or not that's the truth or not, when I look at the picture of this guy,
[02:27:28.098 --> 02:27:28.378]  I think so.
[02:27:44.392 --> 02:27:50.315]  I was assaulted by the black bloc, which really is the federal bloc in most cases, when I was at Denver with you guys.
[02:27:50.315 --> 02:27:54.077]  They would come up and slap me in the back and punch me and then laugh about it.
[02:27:54.077 --> 02:27:57.039]  Of course, you were there when we had them cutting our microphones with knives.
[02:27:57.039 --> 02:27:58.199]  That was MSNBC.
[02:27:58.199 --> 02:28:01.881]  But yeah, he does look familiar, doesn't he?
[02:28:01.881 --> 02:28:03.642]  Yeah, this guy definitely does.
[02:28:04.655 --> 02:28:07.576]  We, you know, there's no coincidence these things are happening.
[02:28:07.576 --> 02:28:11.376]  We just had Chertoff in town and we hit him pretty hard.
[02:28:11.376 --> 02:28:13.957]  I think you guys even put the video up about it.
[02:28:13.957 --> 02:28:21.358]  And of course, Chertoff was talking about all the terror possibilities in local and, you know, in your local areas.
[02:28:21.358 --> 02:28:29.500]  And the Denver Post actually put out an article here and basically talking about the terror watch guy here talking, speaking,
[02:28:30.180 --> 02:28:42.406]  That he knew of Al-Qaeda activity here in Aurora, and it's certain that Al-Qaeda had told its members via websites to go to the U.S., buy guns, and go into shopping malls, churches, and synagogues and start shooting.
[02:28:42.406 --> 02:28:58.413]  Yeah, exactly, so they're getting ready for the churches, the movie theaters were some of the targets, and then magically this guy, who is in an advanced Department of Defense funded program in PhD level for brain interface neuroscience,
[02:28:59.862 --> 02:29:05.265]  But the guy's wearing a mask, but now it's him, we're told, and we're all supposed to believe this.
[02:29:05.265 --> 02:29:05.746]  Right.
[02:29:05.746 --> 02:29:09.048]  I mean, it's pretty absurd.
[02:29:09.048 --> 02:29:12.069]  We can definitely see the patterns of what's going on here.
[02:29:12.069 --> 02:29:17.773]  The Black Bloc, these guys are connected to the radical anti-imperialist movement.
[02:29:17.773 --> 02:29:19.354]  We've had problems with them in the past.
[02:29:20.575 --> 02:29:27.303]  They flew in the Black Block in 99 to Seattle with government aircraft and put them in a police-controlled area.
[02:29:27.303 --> 02:29:29.506]  They were publicly working for the feds.
[02:29:29.506 --> 02:29:31.628]  That's on record.
[02:29:31.628 --> 02:29:35.573]  I've had Black Block on the street when I don't have a camera walk over and say, we're going to kill you.
[02:29:35.573 --> 02:29:37.335]  And I go, you work for the government.
[02:29:37.335 --> 02:29:38.317]  They're like, you bet we do.
[02:29:39.699 --> 02:29:48.965]  And one of our guys was in Chicago during the protests a couple months ago, and he saw the people running the marches up there were the Denver Black Rod.
[02:29:48.965 --> 02:29:50.707]  The very people we were doing battle.
[02:29:50.707 --> 02:29:51.547]  Amazing!
[02:29:51.547 --> 02:29:52.948]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.948 --> 02:29:55.470]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.470 --> 02:29:58.152]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.981 --> 02:30:18.448]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:30:18.448 --> 02:30:23.150]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:27.212]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[02:30:27.816 --> 02:30:35.899]  It also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your Silver Solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:30:35.899 --> 02:30:43.863]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:30:43.863 --> 02:30:53.447]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:30:54.227 --> 02:30:58.149]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:30:58.149 --> 02:31:02.151]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:31:02.151 --> 02:31:03.392]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:31:03.392 --> 02:31:04.892]  What does freedom mean to you?
[02:31:04.892 --> 02:31:05.793]  The freedom to choose?
[02:31:05.793 --> 02:31:06.753]  The freedom to vote?
[02:31:06.753 --> 02:31:07.754]  The freedom to worship?
[02:31:07.754 --> 02:31:09.715]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?

[02:32:16.929 --> 02:32:22.111]  At Infowars.com, its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:32:22.111 --> 02:32:23.811]  There's no priming required.
[02:32:23.811 --> 02:32:26.092]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[02:32:26.092 --> 02:32:28.753]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:32:28.753 --> 02:32:31.173]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:32:31.173 --> 02:32:32.614]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:32:32.614 --> 02:32:35.775]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:32:35.775 --> 02:32:39.156]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:32:39.156 --> 02:32:43.097]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:32:43.277 --> 02:32:46.038]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:32:46.038 --> 02:32:47.599]  It's what my family uses.
[02:32:47.599 --> 02:32:50.900]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:32:50.900 --> 02:32:56.743]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[02:32:58.184 --> 02:32:59.304]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:32:59.304 --> 02:33:02.245]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:41.098 --> 02:33:45.606]  Ladies and gentlemen, you'd better believe that I'll be on the nightly news tonight with Darren McBrain.
[02:33:45.606 --> 02:33:51.397]  Also, some of the InfoWars reporters are here being interviewed for jobs.
[02:33:51.397 --> 02:33:52.779]  They're going to be on the nightly news tonight.
[02:33:54.445 --> 02:33:58.066]  And I'll be breaking down the latest at 7 o'clock central.
[02:33:58.066 --> 02:34:03.307]  If you haven't gotten a 15-day free trial at PrisonPlanet.tv, it takes about a minute to sign up.
[02:34:03.307 --> 02:34:09.589]  Just create a username and passcode that you don't use for anything else and then you can share it because you can be logged in.
[02:34:09.589 --> 02:34:12.690]  Six people can be logged in with the same username and passcode at once.
[02:34:13.610 --> 02:34:17.133]  That's six memberships for $5.95 a month.
[02:34:17.133 --> 02:34:18.054]  Okay?
[02:34:18.054 --> 02:34:19.915]  We haven't run ads explaining that.
[02:34:19.915 --> 02:34:30.123]  I've been doing that the last few years because finally we've gotten better and better servers to where before if I gave out, you know, too many basically free memberships, it would bog the site down.
[02:34:30.123 --> 02:34:35.388]  Now we've just put so much money into it and put the IT into it that it works like a charm, knock on wood.
[02:34:37.995 --> 02:34:40.638]  There are 17 years of my films up there.
[02:34:40.638 --> 02:34:42.701]  Well, first of all, May was like 16 years ago.
[02:34:42.701 --> 02:34:45.645]  There's 16 years of TV shows, films up there.
[02:34:45.645 --> 02:34:50.230]  We've had the site nine and plus years since April of nine years ago.
[02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:52.173]  So, a little more than nine years.
[02:34:52.173 --> 02:34:56.438]  There's the daily radio show with streaming video, InfoWars Live, the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:57.579 --> 02:35:09.547]  And then there's the nightly news, and then there's all the special alerts, everything else, my book, Paul Watson's book, a whole bunch of other documentaries we've been authorized to post there, where filmmakers contacted us to want to premiere films there.
[02:35:09.547 --> 02:35:13.129]  It's incredible, and you're supporting the front lines of the info war.
[02:35:13.129 --> 02:35:18.172]  Because I don't care if the Washington Post comes out and attacks me or the New York Times.
[02:35:18.172 --> 02:35:22.795]  And I want to say this before I go back to calls, because we need to be prayed for here.
[02:35:22.795 --> 02:35:25.977]  When Richard Plosky in Pittsburgh
[02:35:27.406 --> 02:35:31.447]  Killed three cops in cold blood, the former Marine did.
[02:35:31.447 --> 02:35:33.207]  They didn't blame the Marine Corps.
[02:35:33.207 --> 02:35:34.988]  By the way, I don't think they should have.
[02:35:34.988 --> 02:35:39.129]  They didn't blame, uh, no, they blame me.
[02:35:39.129 --> 02:35:48.471]  Within one hour of arrest, when he gave himself up, I don't ever get this, you like, kill three people and you're not gonna keep killing, or I mean, you know, it's just, it's so weird.
[02:35:48.471 --> 02:35:56.273]  He kills three cops because he's drunk, he's got two pit bulls, his mother says get rid of them, they're defecating and urinating everywhere, he's passed out,
[02:35:58.049 --> 02:36:01.971]  Cops will tell you the most dangerous thing is a domestic dispute.
[02:36:01.971 --> 02:36:05.713]  She calls the cops to throw him out because he bows up to her.
[02:36:05.713 --> 02:36:10.596]  But she doesn't tell him, by the way, he's waiting with a semi-automatic AK-47.
[02:36:10.596 --> 02:36:14.018]  So the three cops come walking up, and he just kills all three of them.
[02:36:19.079 --> 02:36:30.122]  And then one hour after he's in custody, the computers, the first thing they're thinking about is go in there and say he did it for Alex Jones, he was a fan of Alex Jones.
[02:36:30.122 --> 02:36:37.745]  Now, we were able to get his handle and find out who he was from his other public postings on a bunch of other sites where he was attacking me.
[02:36:37.745 --> 02:36:41.306]  Oh, he was a white supremacist showing off his tattoos and stuff.
[02:36:41.306 --> 02:36:44.927]  For whatever reason, a lot of the white supremacists really hate us because we don't get into a bunch of race stuff.
[02:36:46.443 --> 02:36:50.346]  And you know, don't make our religion attacking Israel all day.
[02:36:50.346 --> 02:36:58.891]  And he was all over the web for years saying I was the most evil person basically on the planet.
[02:36:58.891 --> 02:37:05.456]  So I contacted five or six newspapers and I said, I don't want to have to sue you and I'm not litigious, but I'm going to have to.
[02:37:05.456 --> 02:37:08.157]  You're telling police he killed people for me.
[02:37:08.157 --> 02:37:10.899]  That's very dangerous.
[02:37:10.899 --> 02:37:11.740]  And you have no proof.
[02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:13.181]  And they all posted retractions.
[02:37:15.509 --> 02:37:18.310]  And I had some of the editors call me and they said, well, what do you want us to do?
[02:37:18.310 --> 02:37:25.753]  And I said, you better do a big one, not a little retraction, a whole article retracting this, because I'm going to have to sue you.
[02:37:25.753 --> 02:37:37.697]  I don't like getting lawyers and suing people, but I'm going to have to come after you and have to win because, you know, the guys are white supremacists who basically, you know, in some cases called for violence against us and said I was going to get mine and all this stuff.
[02:37:37.697 --> 02:37:38.918]  And then the first thing
[02:37:40.796 --> 02:37:45.562]  The people running that police department did, when they got in there, was blaming on Alex Jones.
[02:37:45.562 --> 02:37:52.791]  And they had the local Southern Poverty Law Center connected guy write an article by that evening saying it was basically connected to me.
[02:37:54.983 --> 02:38:13.879]  This has happened a bunch of times, when Nightline, when MSNBC, when CNN, when any of them, when New York Magazine, Rolling Stone, London Guardian, Associated Press, Reuters, Syndicated Radio, Extra, Hard Copy over the years.
[02:38:13.879 --> 02:38:18.664]  It's always, when they sit down, CBS News was here a few weeks ago.
[02:38:19.494 --> 02:38:21.499]  What do they say to me?
[02:38:21.499 --> 02:38:24.826]  Are you worried what you're saying is going to cause some violence?
[02:38:24.826 --> 02:38:28.113]  Gee, our country being imploded by foreign bankers.
[02:38:28.113 --> 02:38:29.556]  All of our liberties under attack.
[02:38:30.646 --> 02:38:33.749]  I mean, you know, the founders actually went out and started, you know, getting violent.
[02:38:33.749 --> 02:38:35.450]  I'm not calling for violence.
[02:38:35.450 --> 02:38:41.935]  In fact, I'm an info warrior trying to use the pen, which is mightier than the sword.
[02:38:41.935 --> 02:38:45.318]  History shows why it's the First Amendment and the backup's the second.
[02:38:45.318 --> 02:38:46.679]  So, no.
[02:38:46.679 --> 02:38:48.661]  I'm the opposite of that and everyone knows it.
[02:38:48.661 --> 02:38:50.102]  So, stop trying to blame me.
[02:38:50.102 --> 02:38:53.445]  And I had the Secret Service show up here a couple of times.
[02:38:53.445 --> 02:38:58.329]  I've had the FBI show up and go, do you support this person on your website calling for the death of this cop?
[02:38:59.315 --> 02:39:01.436]  And I'm like, no.
[02:39:01.436 --> 02:39:03.717]  Well, why did you have moderators remove it?
[02:39:03.717 --> 02:39:05.838]  I didn't know they removed it.
[02:39:05.838 --> 02:39:09.140]  But they remove any calls for violence.
[02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:12.762]  Then I get attacked and I'm censoring.
[02:39:12.762 --> 02:39:15.923]  And I said, so stop implying I'm involved in violence.
[02:39:15.923 --> 02:39:21.586]  You know, the FBI killed Terrence Yakey, the cop that was exposing the fact that the FBI was involved in Oklahoma City.
[02:39:21.586 --> 02:39:23.067]  You want to talk about that?
[02:39:23.067 --> 02:39:26.629]  You want to talk about the fact, you know, don't try to set me up, okay?
[02:39:27.642 --> 02:39:34.067]  Because I know how the system works, and don't think just because you get 90% stage convictions or whatever, that you're going to get away with this.
[02:39:34.067 --> 02:39:37.190]  The point is, is that we've got the New World Order circling around us.
[02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:38.230]  Let me tell you something.
[02:39:38.230 --> 02:39:46.597]  They have the White House Transition Chief of Staff and others publicly running ThinkProgress, funded by George Soros and the Democratic Party.
[02:39:46.597 --> 02:39:53.943]  I mean, these are people that actually set policy for Obama, are calling for our funding to be cut off and for us to be shut down.
[02:39:54.983 --> 02:40:01.831]  Media matters that says they'll infiltrate alternative media, and we're listed by them, and destroy them from within.
[02:40:01.831 --> 02:40:09.160]  I have to worry new people I'm hiring, and they're all nice folks, but I have to sit there and look at them and go, is this an infiltrator?
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:12.124]  Okay, that's the world I live in.
[02:40:12.124 --> 02:40:13.926]  But who knows what an infiltrator can do?
[02:40:14.830 --> 02:40:17.472]  Plant child porn on computers.
[02:40:17.472 --> 02:40:19.012]  Plant drugs.
[02:40:19.012 --> 02:40:24.155]  Plant hacked material on our computers.
[02:40:24.155 --> 02:40:27.657]  Claim we've got national security information.
[02:40:27.657 --> 02:40:30.839]  Again, we could be shut up any time, so pray for us.
[02:40:30.839 --> 02:40:31.840]  Spread the word.
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:44.367]  Let me tell you, when the White House control groups come out and call for us to be shut down, and say Drudge has to be dealt with because he's supporting us as well, and oh my gosh, Drudge is funding them by linking to them.
[02:40:49.531 --> 02:40:51.151]  I guess he's funding us today, linked to us.
[02:40:51.151 --> 02:40:55.513]  No, it's because we said, watch, they're going to come out and blame the Second Amendment.
[02:40:55.513 --> 02:40:58.053]  And then an hour later, our article was proven right and triplicate.
[02:40:58.053 --> 02:40:58.934]  I mean, it's not hard.
[02:40:58.934 --> 02:41:01.194]  We said, hey, the sun's going to come up this morning.
[02:41:01.194 --> 02:41:02.415]  And we were the first to put it out.
[02:41:02.415 --> 02:41:08.296]  So we're the, I mean, you know, we're hardworking idiots over there with the George Soros group.
[02:41:08.296 --> 02:41:09.737]  That's what's happening here.
[02:41:09.737 --> 02:41:12.717]  We've got support, dozens of legs of support.
[02:41:12.717 --> 02:41:17.139]  You can't just chop one out from under us as if you're just going to threaten Drudge.
[02:41:17.139 --> 02:41:18.459]  And then Drudge isn't going to link to us.
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:25.106]  My gut, and I said this to Farroff here, I said I bet I'm going to get more links now that they're threatening him to stop linking to us.
[02:41:25.106 --> 02:41:26.107]  Don't you get it?
[02:41:26.107 --> 02:41:28.049]  We're not here to be pushed around anymore.
[02:41:28.049 --> 02:41:29.731]  Do you understand that?
[02:41:29.731 --> 02:41:30.992]  I understand the threat.
[02:41:30.992 --> 02:41:34.175]  I understand the danger we're in.
[02:41:34.175 --> 02:41:36.278]  But who knows who they're going to blame when this comes out.
[02:41:37.830 --> 02:41:40.051]  Who knows?
[02:41:40.051 --> 02:41:41.652]  I hope they don't blame us.
[02:41:41.652 --> 02:41:45.615]  They're already blaming the Second Amendment, which is everybody, which is your right, so they are blaming us.
[02:41:45.615 --> 02:41:48.617]  They're blaming me, they're blaming you, they're blaming everybody.
[02:41:48.617 --> 02:41:51.839]  They're saying our guns that keep us safe.
[02:41:51.839 --> 02:41:59.224]  I feel really good that some of my crew here has concealed carry, who statistically are the most law-abiding people out there, and have been trained and everything.
[02:41:59.224 --> 02:42:03.006]  I feel so good knowing there's some heaters floating around in here.
[02:42:04.946 --> 02:42:08.308]  Because if somebody's really crazy and wants to do something, there's nothing you can do to stop them.
[02:42:08.308 --> 02:42:10.710]  Unless you've got a gun, that's your only hope.
[02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:13.532]  I feel really good knowing that.
[02:42:13.532 --> 02:42:16.694]  I feel really good that I know how to use a gun.
[02:42:16.694 --> 02:42:19.496]  And I mean I know how to use them good.
[02:42:19.496 --> 02:42:24.840]  I know how to relax if I need to and hit the target.
[02:42:27.210 --> 02:42:28.151]  That's the great part about the gun.
[02:42:28.151 --> 02:42:35.315]  You don't have to get all... You don't have to get all Ben Grimm or, you know, the Hulk out crazy to stomp somebody like you do when, you know, some big guy's coming down on you.
[02:42:35.315 --> 02:42:37.556]  You gotta... You don't get mad and do it.
[02:42:37.556 --> 02:42:39.518]  With a gun, it's just all real calm.
[02:42:39.518 --> 02:42:40.378]  You gotta defend yourself.
[02:42:40.378 --> 02:42:42.399]  It's just easy as pie.
[02:42:42.399 --> 02:42:44.721]  And that is such a satisfying feeling.
[02:42:44.721 --> 02:42:48.663]  And they want to take that satisfying feeling away.
[02:42:48.663 --> 02:42:54.547]  It's satisfying to have an instant access pistol safe in every bedroom in my house.
[02:42:54.547 --> 02:42:55.888]  And to have one right up by the front door.
[02:42:57.540 --> 02:43:04.825]  Or I can just reach right over and hit the code and in a second have my firearm right there ready to defend my family.
[02:43:04.825 --> 02:43:05.786]  They want to take that away.
[02:43:05.786 --> 02:43:09.008]  They want to make me a slave like there are in all these other countries.
[02:43:09.008 --> 02:43:11.049]  And they're attacking all of us right now with this.
[02:43:11.049 --> 02:43:15.212]  When they get into his apartment, that is guaranteed some little cache of setups.
[02:43:15.212 --> 02:43:16.593]  This whole thing stinks.
[02:43:16.593 --> 02:43:18.415]  It's going to be bad.
[02:43:18.415 --> 02:43:21.297]  And I don't know who they're going to blame, but I got a good idea.
[02:43:22.284 --> 02:43:27.687]  And perhaps talking about it will make them think they can't get away with it, but I've been through this repeatedly.
[02:43:27.687 --> 02:43:34.451]  Within one hour, three dead cops, they're blaming me, came out in court.
[02:43:34.451 --> 02:43:38.394]  All it was is what we found publicly and got the retractions with before it came out in court.
[02:43:38.394 --> 02:43:42.896]  It was all, get Alex Jones, and violence is the answer, Alex Jones is wrong.
[02:43:42.896 --> 02:43:45.458]  Oh yeah, that's what he said on our site.
[02:43:45.458 --> 02:43:49.040]  Violence is the answer, Alex Jones is wrong, and Alex Jones is gonna get his.
[02:43:49.517 --> 02:43:51.498]  And then I get the blame!
[02:43:51.498 --> 02:43:56.559]  I get the blame, because I'm saying don't go out and kill cops, and then I get the blame!
[02:43:56.559 --> 02:43:59.960]  No, I don't deserve the blame, and I'm not taking it!
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:02.820]  And the Second Amendment isn't taking it either!
[02:44:02.820 --> 02:44:05.921]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in California.
[02:44:05.921 --> 02:44:07.402]  Why am I the first target, folks?
[02:44:07.402 --> 02:44:09.542]  Because they're scared of us, that's why.
[02:44:09.542 --> 02:44:11.863]  James in California, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[02:44:12.924 --> 02:44:16.106]  Hey Alex, it's a pleasure to be able to speak with you finally.
[02:44:16.106 --> 02:44:17.706]  My name is James Martinez.
[02:44:17.706 --> 02:44:23.810]  I am the protege and former work colleague of Walter Boward, who wrote the book Operation Mind Control.
[02:44:23.810 --> 02:44:42.459]  And before his death, I kind of took over all his work, but I wanted to say to you and commend you for touching the dirtiest, ugliest truth that is actually going on, and that is the harvesting and manufacturing of children for use for operations all over the world.
[02:44:43.015 --> 02:44:44.336]  You're precisely right.
[02:44:44.336 --> 02:44:49.718]  I mean, I know you're not the world's expert on this, and I don't think anybody is, but it is going on.
[02:44:49.718 --> 02:44:51.618]  It is real.
[02:44:51.618 --> 02:45:05.064]  And that particular kind of center point there that's happening is why we're in the position that we're in, because it is... There's a book that was written by Ralph Metzner.
[02:45:05.064 --> 02:45:07.485]  It's called The Roots of War and Domination.
[02:45:07.485 --> 02:45:10.006]  He's a psychiatrist, and I've interviewed him.
[02:45:10.911 --> 02:45:19.238]  I know him quite well, but it really actually goes into the pathology of the people at the very top that harvest these children and do this stuff.
[02:45:19.238 --> 02:45:26.964]  No, no, that's what CIA mind control was all about, was people that like to abuse children got congressional funding.
[02:45:27.665 --> 02:45:32.488]  To do it under national security, and it's a guild.
[02:45:32.488 --> 02:45:45.096]  There's lots of sadists and control freaks and just mercenaries that make up different cadres, but as you get higher up the pyramid, the only people that want to betray countries and be evil is they are these demon creatures.
[02:45:45.096 --> 02:45:54.363]  I mean, they might as well be demons who like hurting children, and everywhere, everywhere you find the New World Order, you find the abuse of innocent children.
[02:45:54.363 --> 02:45:56.124]  It is just so hellish.
[02:45:57.327 --> 02:45:58.387]  You're dead on.
[02:45:58.387 --> 02:46:01.648]  So, congrats for you for having the courage to bring that up.
[02:46:01.648 --> 02:46:03.909]  Well, sir, it's not the courage, it's survival instinct.
[02:46:03.909 --> 02:46:07.590]  I mean, we've got to face the whole truth and make preparation for it.
[02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:12.451]  And, you know, that's all this comes down to is that I have committed to go all the way.
[02:46:12.451 --> 02:46:13.431]  And it's the only way.
[02:46:13.431 --> 02:46:16.352]  I mean, people think you go along with this, you survive.
[02:46:16.352 --> 02:46:17.752]  No, you don't.
[02:46:17.752 --> 02:46:20.313]  I mean, sir, pediatric cancer is up over 10,000%.
[02:46:22.315 --> 02:46:24.157]  If you look at major studies.
[02:46:24.157 --> 02:46:26.819]  Many cancers in adults, 2,000, 3,000 percent.
[02:46:26.819 --> 02:46:28.260]  Diabetes, several thousand percent.
[02:46:28.260 --> 02:46:28.840]  Type 2.
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:31.102]  They're killing us, sir.
[02:46:31.102 --> 02:46:32.183]  We're already dead.
[02:46:32.183 --> 02:46:36.287]  I mean, I'm not gonna... I mean, there's no hope but to beat them.
[02:46:36.287 --> 02:46:38.148]  God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[02:46:38.148 --> 02:46:40.851]  We're taking calls again on the shooting mainly.
[02:46:40.851 --> 02:46:42.212]  Jim Innovato, you're on the air.
[02:46:42.212 --> 02:46:42.632]  Go ahead.
[02:46:42.632 --> 02:46:45.675]  Hello, Alex.
[02:46:45.675 --> 02:46:46.155]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:46:46.155 --> 02:46:47.916]  Welcome.
[02:46:47.916 --> 02:46:49.218]  Dude, man, this whole thing is, uh...
[02:46:50.216 --> 02:46:51.276]  It's really tragic, man.
[02:46:51.276 --> 02:46:52.537]  I have kids, I have family.
[02:46:52.537 --> 02:46:59.059]  I imagine myself being in the movie theater watching a movie and having this happen to me and my family.
[02:46:59.059 --> 02:47:00.760]  Very scary situation.
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:01.620]  Well, that's it.
[02:47:01.620 --> 02:47:09.523]  I'm going to start carrying a little... I've got a bunch of small handguns.
[02:47:09.523 --> 02:47:12.424]  With the crime increasing and everything, everybody's just got to start packing.
[02:47:12.424 --> 02:47:13.004]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:47:14.182 --> 02:47:33.070]  Um, I noticed on my Yahoo News, uh, I don't know, you didn't really mention this yet, but, uh, you know how you guys were saying that, uh, that one caller, uh, that was, uh, 50-year-old guy that was, um, ex-military or whatever, he was saying that it's within, like, four miles or whatever of the, uh, Air Force Base?
[02:47:33.070 --> 02:47:39.373]  Well, uh, Yahoo News is reporting that, um, some of the people that were shot inside the movie theater were U.S.
[02:47:39.373 --> 02:47:40.153]  military members.
[02:47:41.864 --> 02:47:42.485]  I don't know.
[02:48:00.748 --> 02:48:01.729]  We'll make other U.S.
[02:48:01.729 --> 02:48:04.752]  military members think, well, why not confiscate guns?
[02:48:04.752 --> 02:48:07.474]  Because look at what's happening to our own military members.
[02:48:07.474 --> 02:48:10.157]  Oh, the military's being targeted all over the U.S.
[02:48:10.157 --> 02:48:12.679]  by weirdo shooters the government knows fully about.
[02:48:12.679 --> 02:48:15.102]  They're protecting, quote, Muslim extremists.
[02:48:15.102 --> 02:48:16.143]  Thank you, good point.
[02:48:16.143 --> 02:48:16.963]  Yeah, no, no.
[02:48:16.963 --> 02:48:18.505]  They're reporting multiple shooters.
[02:48:18.505 --> 02:48:21.708]  It was reported on the local news.
[02:48:21.708 --> 02:48:24.591]  We've confirmed this, but we're going to dig it out and do an article on it.
[02:48:25.171 --> 02:48:26.531]  Here's an email from Greg.
[02:48:26.531 --> 02:48:28.652]  I was watching the Colorado News Feeds all morning.
[02:48:28.652 --> 02:48:29.532]  Yeah, so were we.
[02:48:29.532 --> 02:48:40.135]  They did an interview with a guy who was in Theater 9, and he stated that someone during the movie took a phone call, got out of his seat, and went to the emergency door Holmes came through.
[02:48:40.135 --> 02:48:45.756]  He said he appeared to do something at the door, as well as gesture to someone outside the theater.
[02:48:45.756 --> 02:48:49.077]  I believe he said Holmes came through five or ten minutes later.
[02:48:49.077 --> 02:48:52.838]  Well, that's like major government connections to
[02:48:54.687 --> 02:49:01.291]  The whole Helter Skelter cult and Charlie Manson and the fact that they wanted to cause this big race war and all this stuff.
[02:49:01.291 --> 02:49:03.192]  I'm telling you folks, this is crazy.
[02:49:03.192 --> 02:49:04.773]  This devil cult.
[02:49:04.773 --> 02:49:07.715]  I believe he said Holmes came through five or ten minutes after.
[02:49:07.715 --> 02:49:11.017]  I have not heard anything about that after that.
[02:49:11.017 --> 02:49:12.998]  I mean, look.
[02:49:12.998 --> 02:49:13.799]  The whole thing.
[02:49:13.799 --> 02:49:18.181]  It makes me sick to sit here and watch this happen.
[02:49:19.599 --> 02:49:23.502]  I'm going to shoot a special video right after the show that will go up on Infowars.com.
[02:49:23.502 --> 02:49:26.704]  We've got all the breaking news right there on the site right now.
[02:49:26.704 --> 02:49:29.025]  Dan in Virginia, you're on the air, sir.
[02:49:29.025 --> 02:49:31.046]  Go ahead.
[02:49:31.046 --> 02:49:32.247]  Hey, Alex.
[02:49:32.247 --> 02:49:35.289]  Yes, sir.
[02:49:35.289 --> 02:49:37.291]  You just covered what I was going to go after.
[02:49:37.291 --> 02:49:39.392]  Those doors all open to the outside.
[02:49:39.392 --> 02:49:40.833]  There's no way you can kick your way in.
[02:49:43.351 --> 02:49:44.972]  Like I said, he had to have help.
[02:49:44.972 --> 02:49:46.553]  This reeks of an inside job.
[02:49:46.553 --> 02:49:47.293]  You're absolutely right.
[02:49:47.293 --> 02:49:48.514]  I'm going to go see this movie this weekend.
[02:49:48.514 --> 02:49:49.054]  But I'm not going alone.
[02:49:49.054 --> 02:49:49.935]  You know what I mean?
[02:49:49.935 --> 02:49:51.976]  I'll be at the range in the morning.
[02:50:14.431 --> 02:50:17.052]  Well, I mean, what do you think about the timing of the U.N.
[02:50:17.052 --> 02:50:19.832]  treaty in a week and a half, two weeks?
[02:50:19.832 --> 02:50:21.053]  Oh, man.
[02:50:21.053 --> 02:50:23.753]  This is perfect timing.
[02:50:23.753 --> 02:50:24.534]  Two weeks?
[02:50:24.534 --> 02:50:29.055]  They're saying they need two votes in the Senate, they didn't have it, and now it looks like they're going to get it.
[02:50:29.055 --> 02:50:31.195]  Can you believe it?
[02:50:31.195 --> 02:50:36.117]  Well, I'm going to be making free phone calls when I get done with you.
[02:50:36.117 --> 02:50:39.558]  And they're going right to the Hill.
[02:50:39.558 --> 02:50:40.138]  Alright, good.
[02:50:40.138 --> 02:50:40.598]  Anything else?
[02:50:41.769 --> 02:50:43.250]  I've got a question for you.
[02:50:43.250 --> 02:50:44.390]  Okay.
[02:50:44.390 --> 02:50:53.473]  I'm also going to take a day off and I'm going to the Hill to deliver the internment and army manual to my two senators and my congressman.
[02:50:53.473 --> 02:50:55.814]  You think I'm going to get out of the building okay?
[02:50:55.814 --> 02:51:02.636]  Oh yeah, no no, you should bring all those documents to him and say, you know this is going on, now I want answers!
[02:51:02.636 --> 02:51:03.857]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:51:03.857 --> 02:51:05.357]  What does freedom mean to you?
[02:51:05.357 --> 02:51:06.258]  The freedom to choose?
[02:51:06.258 --> 02:51:07.198]  The freedom to vote?
[02:51:07.198 --> 02:51:08.198]  The freedom to worship?
[02:51:08.198 --> 02:51:10.139]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[02:51:10.399 --> 02:51:15.847]  My friends at eFoods Direct are celebrating freedom this month while helping you take control of your greatest dependency, food.

[02:52:02.041 --> 02:52:06.803]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:52:06.803 --> 02:52:08.904]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:52:09.831 --> 02:52:18.796]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:52:18.796 --> 02:52:23.699]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:52:24.349 --> 02:52:35.722]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:52:35.722 --> 02:52:42.731]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:52:43.391 --> 02:52:47.693]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:52:47.693 --> 02:52:51.294]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:52:51.294 --> 02:52:58.556]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:52:58.556 --> 02:52:59.837]  Protect your immune system.
[02:52:59.837 --> 02:53:00.857]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:53:01.724 --> 02:53:03.205]  Are you storing food?
[02:53:03.205 --> 02:53:09.370]  Prepared families are storing food for months and years, but only have enough fuel stored for days or weeks.
[02:53:09.370 --> 02:53:13.814]  Stretch your fuel storage by harnessing the power of the sun with the Sun Oven.
[02:53:13.814 --> 02:53:20.339]  Food can be baked, boiled or steamed at temperatures of 360 to 400 degrees with the power of the sun.
[02:53:20.339 --> 02:53:23.242]  You can use the sun for 50 to 80 percent of your cooking.
[02:53:23.582 --> 02:53:26.684]  Allowing you to preserve your fuel storage for rainy days.
[02:53:26.684 --> 02:53:30.626]  Sun-baked foods stay moister and have less shrinkage and do not burn.
[02:53:30.626 --> 02:53:33.308]  Sun-baked roasts are tastier and more succulent.
[02:53:33.308 --> 02:53:36.690]  And sun-baked bread has unparalleled taste and texture.
[02:53:36.690 --> 02:53:40.832]  Water can be heated in a sun oven for purification or personal hygiene.
[02:53:40.832 --> 02:53:45.254]  For the past 26 years, sun ovens have been proudly made in the U.S.
[02:53:45.254 --> 02:53:45.895]  They're durable.
[02:53:46.215 --> 02:53:50.601]  Have a long life and come with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.
[02:53:50.601 --> 02:53:52.924]  Don't be fooled by cheap imitations.
[02:53:52.924 --> 02:53:57.250]  For a discount coupon, visit sunoven.com forward slash radio.
[02:53:57.250 --> 02:53:59.634]  That's sunoven.com forward slash radio.
[02:54:25.924 --> 02:54:31.687]  By the way, we've confirmed there were military personnel inside the theater when this event took place.
[02:54:31.687 --> 02:54:33.388]  This false flag.
[02:54:33.388 --> 02:54:39.611]  And let me tell you, if you don't know that's what all the signs say, you're dumber than a box of rocks.
[02:54:39.611 --> 02:54:43.233]  Gunman kills 12 in Denver shooting at Batman movie.
[02:54:43.233 --> 02:54:43.973]  This is Reuters.
[02:54:43.973 --> 02:54:44.633]  It's up to 14 now.
[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:50.601]  He looked like he was in the military or like he was a SWAT person.
[02:54:50.601 --> 02:54:53.922]  So he just kind of blended in with the chaos of the crowd.
[02:54:53.922 --> 02:54:55.943]  People thought he was probably like a cop or something.
[02:54:55.943 --> 02:54:59.344]  Witness Jennifer Seeger told NBC's Today.
[02:54:59.344 --> 02:55:01.545]  That's what a bunch of other witnesses say.
[02:55:01.545 --> 02:55:03.186]  And people thought it was part of the movie.
[02:55:03.186 --> 02:55:04.186]  They kept sitting there.
[02:55:04.186 --> 02:55:06.267]  Because they're in suspended disbelief.
[02:55:06.267 --> 02:55:06.927]  It's their movie.
[02:55:06.927 --> 02:55:07.687]  Nothing's gonna wreck it.
[02:55:07.687 --> 02:55:13.089]  Even the bullet going into their baby's head.
[02:55:13.089 --> 02:55:15.630]  There are going to be other days for politics, I think.
[02:55:16.874 --> 02:55:27.436]  And this day, for prayer and reflection, while he has his surrogates out demonizing the Second Amendment, Obama told supporters at a previously scheduled campaign event in Fort Myers, Florida, that he cut short to address the shooting.
[02:55:27.436 --> 02:55:31.137]  Oh, just like Bush on 9-11 with the pet goat.
[02:55:31.137 --> 02:55:33.118]  You know them by the script.
[02:55:33.118 --> 02:55:34.598]  The scripting is the evidence.
[02:55:34.598 --> 02:55:44.160]  If you believe that they've got a few votes they need to get that treaty that Obama says he's going to sign, and this happens right before,
[02:55:45.796 --> 02:55:51.459]  And it happens right in the same quadrant of the secret government area of Denver.
[02:55:51.459 --> 02:55:59.904]  Dear Columbine, if you think all that happened on accident, ladies and gentlemen, you are insane.
[02:55:59.904 --> 02:56:01.965]  This is a big deal, folks.
[02:56:01.965 --> 02:56:03.766]  This is a big deal.
[02:56:03.766 --> 02:56:06.507]  Let's go to Neil in North Carolina.
[02:56:06.507 --> 02:56:08.508]  You're on the air, Neil.
[02:56:08.508 --> 02:56:09.109]  Hey, Alex.
[02:56:09.109 --> 02:56:09.649]  How you doing?
[02:56:10.595 --> 02:56:11.335]  Oh, pretty good.
[02:56:11.335 --> 02:56:13.216]  It looks bad though, I tell you.
[02:56:13.216 --> 02:56:16.877]  This looks like some of those staged Russian shootings they've done to get a police state.
[02:56:16.877 --> 02:56:19.578]  Looks like that same kind of model.
[02:56:19.578 --> 02:56:20.179]  I got you.
[02:56:20.179 --> 02:56:21.179]  I got a couple things.
[02:56:21.179 --> 02:56:23.740]  I know I got a short period of time.
[02:56:23.740 --> 02:56:31.783]  First off, I'm active duty military and I'm currently stationed in North Carolina.
[02:56:31.783 --> 02:56:35.164]  And you got a lot of supporters out here, man.
[02:56:35.164 --> 02:56:39.526]  I ordered the paint stencil and
[02:56:40.909 --> 02:56:48.272]  125 bumper stickers and 400 cards, and they've been getting passed out like candy on Halloween, man.
[02:56:48.272 --> 02:56:52.934]  We've got a lot of stuff like that at cost at InfoWarshop.com for new listeners.
[02:56:52.934 --> 02:56:54.815]  Very effective to wake people up.
[02:56:54.815 --> 02:56:58.896]  What's your take on this shooting?
[02:56:58.896 --> 02:57:00.837]  I'm actually originally from Colorado.
[02:57:00.837 --> 02:57:07.940]  I was in Colorado when Columbine happened, and I don't know, like everyone's been saying, it's pretty convenient timing.
[02:57:10.544 --> 02:57:12.524]  It's, uh, yeah.
[02:57:12.524 --> 02:57:13.425]  I don't know.
[02:57:13.425 --> 02:57:17.145]  It always happens right before a key gun control bill.
[02:57:17.145 --> 02:57:17.525]  Always.
[02:57:17.525 --> 02:57:19.126]  Exactly.
[02:57:19.126 --> 02:57:23.647]  I mean, this is really obvious.
[02:57:23.647 --> 02:57:25.307]  Two more things, Alex.
[02:57:25.307 --> 02:57:29.028]  I actually sent some pictures of my truck.
[02:57:29.028 --> 02:57:32.048]  I painted my truck all up with Infowars.com.
[02:57:32.048 --> 02:57:33.929]  Like I said, I've been handing that stuff out.
[02:57:33.929 --> 02:57:35.129]  What email did you send it to?
[02:57:35.129 --> 02:57:38.010]  We'll post it if you want.
[02:57:38.010 --> 02:57:39.390]  Kurt Nemo, I think, your editor.
[02:57:40.208 --> 02:57:45.170]  Alright, resend it to Showtips or create a group at PlanetInfoWars.com.
[02:57:45.170 --> 02:57:47.411]  That way we see everything and don't miss it.
[02:57:47.411 --> 02:57:49.292]  But great job, buddy.
[02:57:49.292 --> 02:57:52.093]  So you say a lot of folks are waking up in your area?
[02:57:52.093 --> 02:58:03.458]  Oh yeah, I've been... I've probably actively witnessed 75 people I've talked to get on the website at least and it's all over my truck so I'm sure a few more people are getting into it.
[02:58:03.458 --> 02:58:08.621]  And are they telling you later it's waking them up or they're confirming or they're clicking with the info?
[02:58:09.574 --> 02:58:18.816]  Some people are having a hard time finding certain resources, and I've been kind of trying to guide them through where to find certain information.
[02:58:18.816 --> 02:58:19.756]  Well, good job, brother.
[02:58:19.756 --> 02:58:20.337]  God bless you.
[02:58:20.337 --> 02:58:20.837]  Keep it up.
[02:58:20.837 --> 02:58:21.657]  Pray for this country.
[02:58:21.657 --> 02:58:23.137]  Pray for the world.
[02:58:23.137 --> 02:58:31.519]  Bottom line, this tragedy is going to be used to take our liberties, and it's a cultural mind control that causes people to get into this type of violence.
[02:58:31.519 --> 02:58:34.520]  Even mainline psychologists are saying that, so the word's getting out.
[02:58:34.520 --> 02:58:37.441]  I'll be live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:37.441 --> 02:58:38.621]  A lot of breaking news.
[02:58:39.321 --> 02:58:41.144]  We'll be coming out at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:41.144 --> 02:58:41.725]  Watch the site.
[02:58:41.725 --> 02:58:42.866]  More coming up.
