[00:00.000 --> 00:13.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.200 --> 00:41.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:41.480 --> 00:49.400]  here we are my friends it is Friday the 20th day of July 2012 and if you look at
[00:49.400 --> 00:57.880]  the full spectrum of information unfolding right now 100% chance that
[00:57.880 --> 01:04.480]  the mass murder committed in the suburb of Denver Colorado right next to
[01:04.480 --> 01:12.400]  Littleton and Columbine was a false flag mine control event of course my
[01:12.400 --> 01:20.880]  quotes are on record from back in earlier in this month when I put a review
[01:20.880 --> 01:27.760]  out what three weeks ago or so of the dark night and in that I basically
[01:27.760 --> 01:34.200]  break down the fact that it is a weaponized propaganda psychological
[01:34.200 --> 01:42.000]  warfare system with subliminals commanding people to be in fear of
[01:42.000 --> 01:51.240]  terrorism but also generating feelings of terror as a Hegelian dialectic event
[01:51.240 --> 01:57.720]  now that nine-minute analysis is up at info wars.com right now now yes
[01:57.720 --> 02:05.040]  yesterday the makers of the film ordered the video taken down even though we use
[02:05.040 --> 02:09.680]  the trailer small clips it's all fair use we're analyzing it they ordered it
[02:09.680 --> 02:13.720]  taken down now normally the computers would do that instantly when a video
[02:13.720 --> 02:17.640]  came up if it really had copyrighted material it's already set in the YouTube
[02:17.640 --> 02:22.520]  systems to recognize it and automatically your video never goes live
[02:22.520 --> 02:30.320]  because it says copyright claim we counter filed and the and the block was
[02:30.320 --> 02:35.080]  taken off so the video is available right now Paul Watson wrote an article
[02:35.080 --> 02:42.240]  that was up at 6 a.m. Eastern this morning that was the first article to
[02:42.240 --> 02:49.160]  predict that Bloomberg, Chuckie Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and the and the usual
[02:49.160 --> 02:52.960]  suspects would come out and call for restricting the Second Amendment further
[02:52.960 --> 02:56.640]  as they've done in Chicago and New York with total bans thus creating hellish
[02:56.640 --> 03:04.640]  crime waves that dwarf what happened even on a weekly basis in Denver. There
[03:04.640 --> 03:08.200]  are more deaths in Chicago every week than what just died in the suburb of
[03:08.200 --> 03:15.840]  Denver and sure enough those reports have all now come out as the
[03:15.840 --> 03:20.920]  establishment calls for ABC news the New York Times Bloomberg himself
[03:20.920 --> 03:25.800]  Bloomberg publication all the usual suspects people that want to run your
[03:25.800 --> 03:29.960]  life people that want to make you defenseless so that somebody dressed up
[03:29.960 --> 03:35.360]  by the way in a bane outfit that's what he was wearing a gas mask came in there
[03:35.360 --> 03:39.680]  and and of course when so many of these shootings they're wearing mask and then
[03:39.680 --> 03:44.240]  they find the drug-addled suspect later just like Sirhan Sirhan that's even
[03:44.240 --> 03:48.080]  mainstream news at the RFK shooter the police's own report said he didn't
[03:48.080 --> 03:51.880]  shoot him wasn't the same caliber they held his hand down and it was his quote
[03:51.880 --> 03:58.440]  security detail behind him that shot Robert F. Kennedy in the back and that's
[03:58.440 --> 04:02.920]  London Telegraph Associated Press Reuters LA Times that's now admitted Sirhan
[04:02.920 --> 04:06.560]  Sirhan's lawyers are trying to get him out of prison with that defense so so
[04:06.560 --> 04:11.440]  this stuff goes on they've got drugs they can give you which make you close to
[04:11.440 --> 04:14.320]  a hundred percent suggestible that you've seen this in the news where they've
[04:14.320 --> 04:18.040]  got flowers down in South America that you can give somebody and tell them you
[04:18.040 --> 04:23.440]  know put your hand in the meat grinder drown your baby in fact I've got to get
[04:23.440 --> 04:27.880]  with my riders and have them explain that they've got drugs that make you they
[04:27.880 --> 04:30.920]  say a hundred percent suggestible I mean not everybody's susceptible to this
[04:30.920 --> 04:35.440]  stuff some people have different effects with different drugs but the point is
[04:35.440 --> 04:39.640]  it's close to a hundred percent the military it's declassified uses this
[04:39.640 --> 04:43.320]  and then programs or they just drug somebody and then tell them they did
[04:43.320 --> 04:48.720]  the shooting and have them all set up Columbine we know was a false flag I'd
[04:48.720 --> 04:52.680]  say a hundred percent false flag and I'll explain why on the other side you see
[04:52.680 --> 04:56.800]  even if this was just an organic shooter they were mass programmed by the
[04:56.800 --> 05:03.400]  culture that sells all this sick of the globalist you Genesis control freaks

[08:49.800 --> 08:55.600]  joining us coming up a little bit later in this hour and normally I would just
[08:55.600 --> 08:59.320]  cancel guest after the big news with the Batman massacre but he'll actually be
[08:59.320 --> 09:05.880]  able to obviously comment on this as well also in news it may even be on
[09:05.880 --> 09:09.120]  info wars nightly news tonight I'll be on the Sunday show Dave Mustain is here
[09:09.120 --> 09:13.480]  in town staying with me well we do some research and things and so we're gonna
[09:13.480 --> 09:18.520]  have a big newsmaking interview with Dave Mustain as well coming up for you
[09:18.520 --> 09:27.080]  throughout the weekend okay there is so much to cover right now I don't just
[09:27.080 --> 09:30.760]  get on air and say something's a false flag a self-inflicted wound a staged
[09:30.760 --> 09:38.960]  event because not all events are staged but when you have the UN treaty set to
[09:38.960 --> 09:45.400]  be signed in the next week or two Obama's not been clear he said late July
[09:45.400 --> 09:49.000]  early August and they're talking about even if Congress doesn't ratify
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.800]  they're gonna try to implement it somehow it's just the right thing to do
[09:52.800 --> 09:55.880]  even though Congress won't do it I'm gonna implement it like he's done with
[09:55.880 --> 10:01.040]  carbon taxes there only a couple votes shy in the Senate of being able to
[10:01.040 --> 10:08.240]  ratify the UN small arms ban treaty that even forms admits registers all your
[10:08.240 --> 10:12.640]  guns and then allows for confiscation I had Bob Desi and yesterday reading from
[10:12.640 --> 10:16.680]  the UN and from the treaty writers of how they would implement and what it meant
[10:16.680 --> 10:21.880]  and saying in those documents that videos up at info wars.com the history
[10:21.880 --> 10:26.960]  of UN gun control gun restrictions is the name of the video that they say at
[10:26.960 --> 10:30.960]  the end we're going to use this as an arms treaty so it's legally binding to
[10:30.960 --> 10:37.320]  go after individual firearms so you've got that coming up in the next two weeks
[10:37.320 --> 10:42.840]  just like they were trying to pass more gun bans in 99 and then magically
[10:42.840 --> 10:48.640]  Columbine happens in April one week before the votes we're talking miles
[10:48.640 --> 10:54.360]  from where this happened you've got all the other issues the guys always
[10:54.360 --> 10:57.760]  wearing a mask whether it's these staged events the Russian government's been
[10:57.760 --> 11:01.240]  caught doing to bring in police state shootings you have somebody drugged up
[11:01.240 --> 11:06.400]  your people do the shooting then they disappear then they grab the Patsy the
[11:06.400 --> 11:09.920]  Patsy's drugged out of their mind or sometimes just like the underwear bomber
[11:09.920 --> 11:12.920]  was gotten on the plane by the State Department that's that's c-span that's
[11:12.920 --> 11:16.200]  that's the undersecretary of state admitting an unnamed agency told us
[11:16.200 --> 11:22.640]  give him a visa even though you never passport get him on the plane we had a
[11:22.640 --> 11:27.360]  witness day one Kurt Askel the lawyer who saw this happen and then a month
[11:27.360 --> 11:33.240]  after he told us here on the air and broke that it got confirmed underwear
[11:33.240 --> 11:36.880]  bomber gotten on the plane by British intelligence head of the 7-7 bombing a
[11:36.880 --> 11:41.760]  SWAT on record MI6 London telegraph Fox News and we're on a lockie number three
[11:41.760 --> 11:47.160]  in Al Qaeda hanging out cigarette dependent on Fox News AP Reuters my
[11:47.160 --> 11:51.520]  point is is that I worked with Watson right before we went live on air we're
[11:51.520 --> 12:03.560]  doing another article right now breaking down the 10 points that directly link
[12:03.560 --> 12:11.200]  this to false flag because there's at least 10 of them and this is where the
[12:11.200 --> 12:15.120]  shadow government is based is in and around Denver they control the police
[12:15.120 --> 12:20.480]  there Harrison Clybold of Columbine reportedly got 127 bombs that's CBS news
[12:20.480 --> 12:25.440]  look it up into the building that day the school was half empty the police
[12:25.440 --> 12:30.640]  stood down the police didn't respond for hours people reported up to four
[12:30.640 --> 12:33.560]  different shooters they wouldn't release the tape for over a year and only
[12:33.560 --> 12:38.080]  released selected clips and they were wearing masks they'd shot a video of
[12:38.080 --> 12:42.560]  attacking the school months before it was school sponsored their parents were
[12:42.560 --> 12:47.680]  both in high-level black ops they were both on serotonin reuptake
[12:47.680 --> 12:53.680]  inhibitors it all had the same MO of a black off of a staged event and remember
[12:53.680 --> 12:59.320]  sir and sir hand the LAPD and the coroner said didn't shoot RFK and it did
[12:59.320 --> 13:04.240]  come out who shot him with his security detail who was known CIA who'd been
[13:04.240 --> 13:08.440]  assigned to the detail that day behind him with a different caliber the audio
[13:08.440 --> 13:14.080]  acoustics all of it the witnesses sir and sir hand was given an amnesiac they
[13:14.080 --> 13:18.280]  give you an amnesiac just like Baroness Mander van der Loeb who supposedly
[13:18.280 --> 13:26.400]  firebomb the Reichstag February 27th 1933 to bring in martial law in Germany he
[13:26.400 --> 13:30.000]  was found naked and drugged and didn't know if he'd set fire to the building like
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.040]  he was gonna run around the Capitol building and set more than 14 fires in
[13:33.040 --> 13:35.840]  it and Herman Göring though don't worry caught him and stopped him the big
[13:35.840 --> 13:40.240]  hero who it later came out declassified documents with the one behind it they
[13:40.240 --> 13:44.960]  just finally released the investigations that happened during
[13:44.960 --> 13:48.040]  Nuremberg those have been classified but a lot of authors and researchers already
[13:48.040 --> 13:52.480]  knew few years ago they released those the point is Hitler started World War
[13:52.480 --> 13:56.280]  2 with Poland mainline textbooks just say oh he just attacked Poland don't
[13:56.280 --> 14:01.680]  actually attack military bases along the border his own military bases dressed
[14:01.680 --> 14:06.440]  up prisoners as Polish troops and his German troops shot him up and then shot
[14:06.440 --> 14:10.160]  newsreel footage and said Poland it attacked Germany with their World War
[14:10.160 --> 14:15.260]  1 pre-World War 1 military was horse-drawn carriages and guys with
[14:15.260 --> 14:19.120]  swords yeah right those powerful military in the world at that time was
[14:19.120 --> 14:26.280]  German military built in secret pretty much secret rearmament rolled out taking
[14:26.280 --> 14:30.200]  Danzig and other areas that had been taken by France at the end of World War
[14:30.200 --> 14:35.840]  1 and then they go into Poland and split it up with Uncle Joe Stalin all done
[14:35.840 --> 14:41.080]  by a fake news story and shooting a few real people and then saying that they
[14:41.080 --> 14:47.200]  had attacked hey that's how this is done but so you can have a good patsy like
[14:47.200 --> 14:52.400]  what you had with Giffords and Judge Rohl who were investigating we've now
[14:52.400 --> 14:56.360]  confirmed fast and furious they were going to come out bipartisan together
[14:56.360 --> 15:00.800]  they've got to be dealt with out comes a guy who was admittedly taking hallucinogens
[15:00.800 --> 15:05.920]  every day for years hanging out with weird people and had disappeared and told
[15:05.920 --> 15:10.520]  people he was under mind control he shows up and shoots two people they try
[15:10.520 --> 15:15.360]  to link it to the tea party then it turns out he was a out of his mind
[15:15.360 --> 15:21.640]  person who was a Democrat but that's again ladies and gentlemen
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.960]  we're now being told by ABC and others oh he could be a Democrat or no he's tea
[15:29.960 --> 15:35.400]  party and within hours we predicted this Paul Watson wrote an article this
[15:35.400 --> 15:40.480]  morning that's linked up on the right hand side of drudgereport.com right now
[15:41.680 --> 15:47.560]  dark night shooting to be exploited for political grift and then over the next
[15:47.560 --> 15:56.840]  few hours AP Reuters CNN Bloomberg all of them coming out saying Obama and
[15:56.840 --> 16:00.680]  Romney both need to call the restrict guns by the way Romney has supported that
[16:00.680 --> 16:05.880]  in the past now he says he doesn't but but now they're saying maybe this will
[16:05.880 --> 16:12.600]  give them the political courage to restrict people's second amendment
[16:14.200 --> 16:20.880]  there's our article to be exploited for political grift under ABC news right
[16:20.880 --> 16:27.320]  under needs that already linking tea party but backtracks now turns out he's
[16:27.320 --> 16:31.400]  a Democrat Breitbart shooter may have be registered Democrat CNN Pierce Morgan
[16:31.400 --> 16:37.480]  calls for gun control Bloomberg what are Obama Romney going to do about guns not
[16:37.480 --> 16:49.040]  about a totally sick society that we see and by the way the London Telegraph got
[16:49.040 --> 16:53.960]  it right they had a 12-month-old baby in there they had little kids in there
[16:53.960 --> 16:57.120]  six-year-olds in there four-year-olds in there a 12-year-old got shot and killed
[16:57.120 --> 17:03.240]  he's the shooter reportedly shot a baby at point blank range all of this right
[17:03.240 --> 17:08.560]  before the treaty that's stalling in the Senate Obama's about to sign it and now
[17:08.560 --> 17:13.280]  he gets to be the hero and by the way don't worry don't worry I have a guy
[17:13.280 --> 17:19.120]  like dressed up like Bane shows up and does all this shooting imitate scene
[17:19.120 --> 17:25.440]  from 1986 Batman comic book where a guy in a mask like Bane shows up and shoots
[17:25.440 --> 17:29.920]  a bunch of people at a movie theater and then they blame Batman oh and see the
[17:29.920 --> 17:36.040]  movies now being blamed Obama leads prayer moment of silence supporters
[17:36.040 --> 17:40.960]  chant for more years yes this is the false flag rollout and if you don't
[17:40.960 --> 17:45.160]  believe it I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you ladies and gentlemen we have a
[17:45.160 --> 17:54.800]  nine and a half minute video up at info wars.com where I predicted Obama would
[17:54.800 --> 17:59.800]  do something like this it's incredible Charlie Daniels joins us right now
[17:59.800 --> 18:04.040]  normally we'd be talking about the new film that he narrates is now available
[18:04.040 --> 18:09.640]  at info wars.com info or shop.com that Chuck undersea made with Charlie
[18:09.640 --> 18:15.040]  Daniels country music legend behold a pale horse and it gets into UN agenda
[18:15.040 --> 18:20.880]  21 and all this but I tell you out of the gates even Rush Limbaugh has said
[18:20.880 --> 18:23.960]  before every time they want to pass a gun control bill two weeks before they
[18:23.960 --> 18:28.160]  wanted to pass an assault weapons ban again we had the Columbine event that
[18:28.160 --> 18:32.560]  was really shady Charlie Daniels and we're gonna skip this break folks
[18:32.560 --> 18:37.480]  Charlie Daniels joining us Charlie what is your initial take on the tragedy and
[18:37.480 --> 18:41.920]  now people seizing on it like Bloomberg and others saying ban our guns so we'll
[18:41.920 --> 18:45.560]  be helpless when crazy men who think their cartoon characters dress up and
[18:45.560 --> 18:53.040]  shoot people well yeah the whole thing isn't it as you well know is that people
[18:53.040 --> 18:58.480]  I have I'm 75 years old I got my first gun when I was 12 years old I have on
[18:58.480 --> 19:05.040]  guns all my life all the people I know have on guns my family owns guns my
[19:05.040 --> 19:11.360]  wife owns guns my neighbors owns guns none of us have ever done anything even
[19:11.360 --> 19:17.440]  pointed one in anybody the people that do it are the problem not the guns the
[19:17.440 --> 19:21.440]  gun you want to do gun control start with this apartment just look at the guy
[19:21.440 --> 19:25.000]  who shot the congresswoman others he was a big Democrat who dressed up like
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.520]  women and then we got the blame for that and now this guy there's saying is a
[19:28.520 --> 19:32.120]  Democrat what is up with these Democrats going around shooting people well
[19:32.120 --> 19:35.480]  I can't figure out what it makes the guy's Democrat or Republican he's a
[19:35.480 --> 19:39.480]  damn nut I agree that's the bottom line of the thing he probably had no business
[19:39.480 --> 19:45.360]  on the street he had no business with a gun the thing is my gosh man that this
[19:45.360 --> 19:51.480]  is just so downright stupid we're gonna do that and put your knives I mean you
[19:51.480 --> 19:55.440]  know people that are violent are going to be violent these people that have these
[19:55.440 --> 19:59.800]  guns are not supposed to have them now they get them by illegal means get the
[19:59.800 --> 20:04.920]  illegal means taken care of do away with that if these people off the street
[20:04.920 --> 20:07.800]  they're selling guns of these thugs and these gang members and these crazy
[20:07.800 --> 20:13.280]  people make everybody who gets a gun do the same thing that I had to do when I
[20:13.280 --> 20:18.320]  got mine when I got my career permit that I had to take take a examination I
[20:18.320 --> 20:21.760]  had to take a written examination I had to take a background examination and I
[20:21.760 --> 20:25.040]  had to take I had to shoot the gun to prove on you how to do it well a matter
[20:25.040 --> 20:29.840]  of honor citizens you know what rather than and then somebody walking up some
[20:29.840 --> 20:33.800]  on the street corner by the gun that's where your problem is gun control is
[20:33.800 --> 20:37.720]  not going to stop that what's going to allow me these people are causing the
[20:37.720 --> 20:43.560]  trouble are not the law about each citizen Charlie Daniels is our guest and
[20:43.560 --> 20:46.280]  I want to get summoned to behold a pale horse obviously have you back later
[20:46.280 --> 20:50.400]  because all this is breaking now what do you make of the fact that two weeks
[20:50.400 --> 20:54.320]  before Obama is set to sign the UN treaty that they don't have the votes of
[20:54.320 --> 20:59.880]  the Senate to get magically this happens and magically it happens right down the
[20:59.880 --> 21:05.800]  street from Columbine I mean this is a boy just tell you this stuff only seems
[21:05.800 --> 21:10.200]  to pop up when they can't get their restrictions of our rights passed I don't
[21:10.200 --> 21:13.600]  know if there's any correlation here or not I would want to go through saying
[21:13.600 --> 21:17.840]  that you know to say there was I don't know about that but these things that
[21:17.840 --> 21:21.840]  happen I had a radio we're playing a little in Colorado and in August and I
[21:21.840 --> 21:25.320]  had a promotion interview scheduled there for this morning and of course we
[21:25.320 --> 21:30.400]  can't they are they cancel it out actually because but because of they had
[21:30.400 --> 21:34.040]  they just went through this combine thing no longer it's pretty fresh in your mind
[21:34.040 --> 21:41.640]  and this thing you know these people get these guns by illegal means the people
[21:41.640 --> 21:46.360]  who buy the guns legally are no trouble I would like to see a statistic done on
[21:46.360 --> 21:52.480]  how many crimes are committed by people who own their guns legally as opposed to
[21:52.480 --> 21:55.440]  the people who get their guns they're not on leaving on this guy could have got
[21:55.440 --> 22:00.360]  them legally I don't know I just saw picture of it pop up on TV here but he's
[22:00.360 --> 22:04.240]  you know he's obviously mentally unbalanced you don't go kill all these
[22:04.240 --> 22:08.720]  people or all these people mentally unless you're mentally unbalanced those
[22:08.720 --> 22:13.040]  people are around get them out of society how much trouble in that guy but in
[22:13.040 --> 22:17.760]  that shot Gabby what's your name you sent me congressman out there these people
[22:17.760 --> 22:22.760]  need to be off the streets and the thing is you cannot if you try to do
[22:22.760 --> 22:26.240]  anything to them now you're violating your civil rights look at the people
[22:26.240 --> 22:30.280]  we're letting walk across the line we don't know who's coming across the line
[22:30.280 --> 22:35.160]  in Mexico we have no idea and yet the same people who want to control guns are
[22:35.160 --> 22:38.800]  not willing to control the border well Charlie let me say this I mean I agree
[22:38.800 --> 22:43.000]  with you if Obama would ship guns to Mexico more than ten thousand and hang
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.200]  grenades you can't buy the gun shop and CBS and others have reported the memos
[22:47.200 --> 22:50.680]  that it was to blame the Second Amendment if that's killed thousands of
[22:50.680 --> 22:54.640]  Mexico hundreds here the FBI even admits then why wouldn't they stage
[22:54.640 --> 22:58.400]  something like this shooting if they would stage fast and furious to try to
[22:58.400 --> 23:02.560]  get our guns well I died you know I'm not going there because I mean it's
[23:02.560 --> 23:06.520]  dislike that's that's something they prove unless it is proven it's just
[23:06.520 --> 23:12.160]  conjecture let's stick with facts right now I go stick with the fact and and you
[23:12.160 --> 23:18.720]  know with I mean the facts are bad enough I don't I don't discount I do
[23:18.720 --> 23:23.840]  honestly think that the fast and furious thing was done to try to try to
[23:23.840 --> 23:28.120]  facilitate gun control in this country I do believe that I believe that there is a
[23:28.120 --> 23:33.160]  big thing of put to do that I'm gonna tell you what's the fact there was a
[23:33.160 --> 23:37.240]  time when I've called both of my Senators offices about this United
[23:37.240 --> 23:42.680]  Nations situation because you get into both of their offices claim that they
[23:42.680 --> 23:47.280]  are against it but my problem is I don't trust them anymore I don't trust either
[23:47.280 --> 23:51.640]  one of them when he comes down the boat I mean we had a congressman who went
[23:51.640 --> 23:56.200]  totally against his constituency and voted for the health care bill and didn't
[23:56.200 --> 24:00.160]  run again he's disappeared nobody even knows where he is I mean I don't I guess
[24:00.160 --> 24:03.400]  his wife knows where he is but nobody's not making any kind of public comparison
[24:03.400 --> 24:07.680]  up because he knows that they've permitted taking him about that what's
[24:07.680 --> 24:14.880]  gonna happen if our senators go into a session and vote to ratify this thing I
[24:14.880 --> 24:18.440]  mean what are we gonna do about what can we do about it that's the point we've
[24:18.440 --> 24:23.400]  come to in this country they are no longer our representatives we need some
[24:23.400 --> 24:28.040]  people who represent us who represent our feelings who will call state of spade
[24:28.040 --> 24:32.560]  and jump in and say look it's stupid let's do something about that control
[24:32.560 --> 24:36.360]  let's go into these neighborhoods where these guys stand on the corner selling
[24:36.360 --> 24:40.280]  them let's go bust these guys let's take them out of society let's send them up
[24:40.280 --> 24:43.920]  let's get the child molesters off the street let's do this let's do that let's
[24:43.920 --> 24:47.880]  do something sensible yes sir Charlie Daniels what about arresting the
[24:47.880 --> 24:51.680]  Attorney General or what about prosecuting him I mean what do you do when
[24:51.680 --> 24:54.640]  you know the Attorney General's been caught lying you know they ordered the
[24:54.640 --> 24:58.840]  gun shipped into Mexico the memos are there to blame the Second Amendment what
[24:58.840 --> 25:02.640]  do you do when the president is a criminal and has announced that the
[25:02.640 --> 25:07.120]  United Nations and NATO controls our military now what do you do when they
[25:07.120 --> 25:12.440]  put us under UN control and UN gun control treaties that even Forbes
[25:12.440 --> 25:17.240]  magazine admits will allow them to register and even confiscate our guns
[25:17.240 --> 25:24.920]  you know it's like I say they only hope we got right now as you know representative they no longer
[25:24.920 --> 25:29.000]  represented that's the stupid part about this whole thing we keep sending people
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.800]  to Congress and decided just because they bring a few dollars to our state you
[25:33.800 --> 25:37.320]  know because they well they got this highway pay they did that they did this
[25:37.320 --> 25:44.120]  they did that they sell us out every day and until we do something about that
[25:44.120 --> 25:49.720]  these people have control of our lives people like like Eric Holder has
[25:49.720 --> 25:56.960]  control of our lives the man is a loose cannon he's dangerous and with big
[25:56.960 --> 26:01.720]  people have something to do with with the quality of our lives and we keep
[26:01.720 --> 26:05.560]  sending the same bunch of idiots back up there time after time looking at
[26:05.560 --> 26:10.320]  California there's a microcosm of what's gonna happen to this country they keep
[26:10.320 --> 26:15.360]  sending the same guys to Sacramento they can get the same deadline results the
[26:15.360 --> 26:19.800]  state's going broke the cities are falling back and they keep doing the
[26:19.800 --> 26:24.600]  same thing everybody thinks that they can keep their peace of the pie you know
[26:24.600 --> 26:30.040]  if I had my way everybody that works would pay if it was 10 cents they would
[26:30.040 --> 26:35.400]  pay in contracts everybody needs a dog in this fight everybody needs to
[26:35.400 --> 26:39.160]  understand what's going on in this country this country is going broke this
[26:39.160 --> 26:43.520]  country is broke this country is teetering on the edge of falling off of a
[26:43.520 --> 26:48.760]  very deep cliff and people will not accept that until after it happens and
[26:48.760 --> 26:52.640]  then the biggest thing you're gonna hear when Obamacare comes in full bones I
[26:52.640 --> 26:56.320]  didn't know it was gonna be like this well I wasn't I wasn't you know wait and
[26:56.320 --> 27:00.600]  see what I'm telling you it's gonna be that way and when the economy goes
[27:00.600 --> 27:04.560]  well why did they let this happen they didn't let this happen we let this
[27:04.560 --> 27:09.840]  happen we just happen to put the wrong people in office and people whoever you
[27:09.840 --> 27:15.160]  vote or go out and vote and put seriously seriously consider it's not
[27:15.160 --> 27:18.800]  yourself but your children and your grandchildren because we're fixing to put
[27:18.800 --> 27:21.920]  something on their back and they're absolutely not gonna be able to dig out
[27:21.920 --> 27:29.520]  Monday Charlie Daniels yes sir I'm just listening to you here you are you're
[27:29.520 --> 27:34.520]  absolutely on target the new film that you're in exposes the UN global takeover
[27:34.520 --> 27:39.320]  it's behold a pale horse it's available right now at info wars at shop commo
[27:39.320 --> 27:42.600]  people get it and get it out to people they can also find it on some of the
[27:42.600 --> 27:47.280]  other great websites but it's just now officially coming out you were gracious
[27:47.280 --> 27:52.120]  to join us for about 3045 minutes just about a month or so ago and it's been
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.000]  really great having you on with us I know you've got a run here pretty quick
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.560]  today but I'd like to have you back up the next few weeks to talk about the
[27:59.560 --> 28:04.480]  film in detail itself that's just so amazing but just in a few minutes
[28:04.480 --> 28:09.120]  we have left Charlie what can you tell people about the hold a pale horse well
[28:09.120 --> 28:13.000]  it's something I think people need to see I mean there's a lot that's going on
[28:13.000 --> 28:21.360]  below the surface here that it's the scope of what's happening is not just
[28:21.360 --> 28:25.160]  this country this couple what's happening is international there are a lot of
[28:25.160 --> 28:29.440]  powerful people around the world they're involved in what's happened to us the UN
[28:29.440 --> 28:35.320]  thing all the things that is going on on international scale and people need to
[28:35.320 --> 28:39.960]  know about the Bible says my people perish lack of knowledge I think we
[28:39.960 --> 28:44.280]  stick this knowledge where we can find it in both pale horses a good place to
[28:44.280 --> 28:48.640]  start it certainly is we're gonna have to fight even harder for the Second
[28:48.640 --> 28:53.240]  Amendment bottom line what do you think of them exploiting it within hours
[28:53.240 --> 28:57.320]  calling for restrictions of our rights to protect ourselves from maniacs like
[28:57.320 --> 29:02.080]  this guy like ghouls we have Bloomberg and singing in and ABC and all of them
[29:02.080 --> 29:06.240]  saying that they want Obama to basically try to take our guns well
[29:06.240 --> 29:10.200]  consider the source it's the same people but let me tell you what helps it's the
[29:10.200 --> 29:15.880]  same people out here I've been on my Twitter this morning and they you know
[29:15.880 --> 29:18.480]  the first thing I said was we're going to hear from them we're on here from the
[29:18.480 --> 29:23.280]  gun control people I'm going to start howling in ADS course but you'd be
[29:23.280 --> 29:27.360]  surprised that the people that are saying you know that are against that the
[29:27.360 --> 29:31.400]  people that are Rick recognizing it for what it is people in this country are
[29:31.400 --> 29:35.600]  not that dumb for the most part when it comes to that other people in my
[29:35.600 --> 29:41.120]  country are not that dumb they know what this is they understand what it but
[29:41.120 --> 29:45.200]  the same thing it's just the same old song well it makes you want to go out and
[29:45.200 --> 29:49.040]  get guns don't when there's maniacs out there Charlie Daniels let me say bye to

[33:39.440 --> 33:46.320]  obviously we are going to open the phones up for police I'd like to hear from
[33:46.320 --> 33:49.680]  police I'd like to hear from private investigators I'd like to hear from
[33:49.680 --> 33:54.920]  psychologists out there about the fact that we know that there is subliminal
[33:54.920 --> 34:00.200]  programming in movies and I said that almost a month ago that this dark night
[34:00.200 --> 34:04.640]  film from the from the script I'd seen which was an early script everything I
[34:04.640 --> 34:08.800]  said my spoiler was accurate except that they changed they shot multiple
[34:08.800 --> 34:14.800]  endings and didn't have Batman die at the end of this though he almost did but
[34:14.800 --> 34:19.960]  as they say the legend ends and they hyped this up just to an incredible extent
[34:19.960 --> 34:24.280]  when you're sitting there in these movies with grown men now they do an
[34:24.280 --> 34:29.920]  awe like it is the greatest moment of their life they don't do an awe when
[34:29.920 --> 34:34.560]  they do good in business or raise their children well or see a new baby born the
[34:34.560 --> 34:38.200]  men that I've seen it's not bad to go see a fantasy movie if it isn't laced with
[34:38.200 --> 34:41.960]  propaganda and if you don't suspend disbelief and believe it's real the most
[34:41.960 --> 34:50.520]  important thing I could say is that the Daily Mail and others are reporting that
[34:50.520 --> 34:55.700]  witnesses thought the shooting was part of the film now imagine there's a guy
[34:55.700 --> 34:59.000]  running around with a gas mask on playing the part of Bane in a black
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.880]  outfit we're told and there's smoke in there to confuse people classic sigh up
[35:04.880 --> 35:12.480]  and starts shooting people and they think it's part of a publicity stunt or
[35:12.480 --> 35:21.760]  others said they thought it was the film and you see all the iconography here of
[35:21.760 --> 35:27.520]  the dark night it rises this happens at the midnight showing of the dark night
[35:27.520 --> 35:36.080]  miles from Columbine miles right in that area where we know the police stood
[35:36.080 --> 35:41.920]  down and covered up other shooters where we know that both these supposed
[35:41.920 --> 35:46.480]  shooters Harrison Clybald had parents deep inside shadow government at the
[35:46.480 --> 35:52.600]  Air Force in secret weapons development and in mind control their parents were
[35:52.600 --> 35:58.120]  both in black ops super secret the real capital the real government is in and
[35:58.120 --> 36:04.800]  around Denver and in Colorado Springs the Denver Airport the underground bases
[36:04.800 --> 36:08.760]  and it keeps happening there because they control the locals you've got the
[36:08.760 --> 36:12.240]  gun control treaty coming up that's on a razor's edge whether it's gonna pass or
[36:12.240 --> 36:18.320]  not in the Senate you you've got Obama needing this is a new campaign stunt
[36:18.320 --> 36:23.080]  this is when this stuff happens and now a guy shows up in a mask so no one knows
[36:23.080 --> 36:27.680]  who it really was and then they find someone and here it is and I said this
[36:27.680 --> 36:31.400]  this morning to Paul Watson I said I called him and I said good job getting
[36:31.400 --> 36:33.680]  the first article out saying they're gonna blame the Second Amendment which
[36:33.680 --> 36:37.400]  they then did an hour later and I said you watch he's gonna be connected to
[36:37.400 --> 36:41.540]  government operations and universities just like Theodore Kaczynski the
[36:41.540 --> 36:48.960]  unabomber was in CIA programs that's LA Times by the way sir hands sir hand the
[36:48.960 --> 36:53.240]  LAPD said he didn't shoot and it was another shooter and now that's come out
[36:53.240 --> 36:57.400]  he was drugged with an amnesiac they can give you an amnesiac and you know who
[36:57.400 --> 37:12.840]  you are this is out of Yahoo news suspect was neuroscience brain science 20
[37:12.840 --> 37:16.720]  years ago they had chips they can put your brain literally well 30 years ago
[37:16.720 --> 37:20.600]  with rats and cockroaches they could they could remote control rats with the
[37:20.600 --> 37:23.680]  brain chip and make them go to the bathroom make them stand up on their
[37:23.680 --> 37:30.580]  back legs make them go any direction they wanted suspect was neuroscience PhD
[37:30.580 --> 37:41.800]  student photo released University of Colorado via ABC whatever that means
[37:41.800 --> 37:46.960]  Colorado shooting suspect James Holmes was in the process of withdrawing from
[37:46.960 --> 37:51.280]  the doctorate program in neuroscience just like Kaczynski was in a doctorate
[37:51.280 --> 37:56.440]  program in similar areas and was in CIA mind-control experiments I forgot that
[37:56.440 --> 38:00.280]  part don't believe me just look it up media at the University of Colorado
[38:00.280 --> 38:04.320]  Denver according to University spokesman Dan Myers Holmes began the program last
[38:04.320 --> 38:09.400]  year this photo obtained by ABC News reportedly shows 24-year-old Holmes Aurora
[38:09.400 --> 38:14.280]  police chief Dan Oates said Holmes apartment is booby-trapped remember in
[38:14.280 --> 38:17.640]  LA few years of you last year they blew up a house they claimed to have
[38:17.640 --> 38:20.360]  explosives in it the thing is they just blow up the house then claim all the
[38:20.360 --> 38:25.520]  evidence is in there a maze of flammable devices it could take hours or days for
[38:25.520 --> 38:30.480]  authorities to disarm them and again you've got an anti Wall Street guy
[38:30.480 --> 38:35.040]  Bain in it who has this clash with police who tries to bring down the you know
[38:35.040 --> 38:38.960]  the market he's an evil type the Joker was an evil libertarian type so he does
[38:38.960 --> 38:44.880]  evil stuff of course that guy ended up you know dying probably suicide you see
[38:44.880 --> 38:49.400]  when I go into a movie I am awake I don't suspend disbelief and when
[38:49.400 --> 38:52.480]  something has got subliminals and conditioning and I become physically
[38:52.480 --> 38:57.240]  nauseated Paul Watson does as well so it's work to go to a movie when I go to
[38:57.240 --> 38:59.960]  a movie I'm scanning I'm watching I'm seeing stuff other people aren't seeing
[38:59.960 --> 39:03.880]  when I watch television it's the same way it's exhausting it's why I don't
[39:03.880 --> 39:09.280]  watch television very often unless you know or I'll watch mindless comedies or
[39:09.280 --> 39:13.280]  old-action movies when I'm on the treadmill or something like the one time
[39:13.280 --> 39:17.880]  I'm able to suspend disbelief is when I am on the treadmill jogging and and then
[39:17.880 --> 39:21.800]  I'll catch myself actually being programmed and and you know when I fall
[39:21.800 --> 39:25.440]  into that place that's why people think about this you ever see your children
[39:25.440 --> 39:30.880]  watching television you're like hey hey and they're just like literally you go
[39:30.880 --> 39:36.360]  into a near sleep state this is a scientific fact look it up that brain
[39:36.360 --> 39:39.960]  waves are lowered during television watching or video games for that matter
[39:39.960 --> 39:43.720]  if you go even deeper in there because you're concentrating only on that you
[39:43.720 --> 39:48.920]  get locked in on it almost like you get hypnotized when you know you're really
[39:48.920 --> 39:52.200]  attracted to a woman and you start looking into her eyes she starts looking
[39:52.200 --> 40:01.200]  into your eyes you start drifting in it's that snake eyes my car in the jungle
[40:01.200 --> 40:07.520]  book hmm that's what they're doing they're hypnotizing you and when I saw
[40:07.520 --> 40:11.400]  the trailers I said a month ago I said I gotta try to find a spoiler a script I
[40:11.400 --> 40:14.880]  made some calls found a bunch of different spoilers called some Hollywood
[40:14.880 --> 40:18.520]  contacts who actually get films early and get to see them and they said yeah
[40:18.520 --> 40:23.080]  that's basically the plot no no this is the real spoiler so I was able to come
[40:23.080 --> 40:27.200]  out and do that and and they had the video taken down yesterday we did a
[40:27.200 --> 40:30.840]  counter claim there's always these fake copyright claims everywhere but but
[40:30.840 --> 40:34.640]  but normally it's automated it happens the day your video comes out usually
[40:34.640 --> 40:39.120]  right as it comes out the automated bots that you know that they run see it and
[40:39.120 --> 40:42.760]  they're automatically filed in to the system as affiliates of YouTube and they
[40:42.760 --> 40:48.480]  take it down they're so quick now a lot of times your video goes live but but
[40:48.480 --> 40:51.720]  but never actually post and it says copyright I mean right as your video
[40:51.720 --> 40:58.160]  goes up it'll say zero views copyright and who said it I interviewed Joe Rogan
[40:58.160 --> 41:02.840]  his voice has been encoded by them and boom bent pixel says I can't have this
[41:02.840 --> 41:06.240]  we had to call them up they said yeah that's YouTube system we're having to
[41:06.240 --> 41:09.560]  un you know unsubscribe with them because they're not implementing it
[41:09.560 --> 41:15.280]  correctly not in the case with my analysis of the dark night it happened
[41:15.280 --> 41:19.760]  weeks and weeks after I put it out the night before it came out on the eve of
[41:19.760 --> 41:23.800]  it showing at midnight all across the country guys we put in full wars up on
[41:23.800 --> 41:28.520]  screen for me thank you actually I can do it we can just show people right here
[41:28.520 --> 41:34.000]  thank you let me just go over this for you Warner Brothers censors reviews
[41:34.000 --> 41:41.480]  critical of dark night rises just before release that was basically an update
[41:41.480 --> 41:44.920]  on Aaron's article that went up at about seven o'clock yesterday before this
[41:44.920 --> 41:49.000]  even happened we pointed out we were being censored Alex Jones review has
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.040]  been blocked inside the United States on copyright claims filed by Warner
[41:54.040 --> 41:58.200]  Brothers and again that was just repossessed they may have taken it down
[41:58.200 --> 42:04.640]  again bankers declare US and Europe conquered oh I know why that's it's not
[42:04.640 --> 42:08.480]  refreshed I pulled up a earlier version I hadn't closed that's that's why it said
[42:08.480 --> 42:13.480]  that there it is TSA continues to break the law ignores court demand on naked
[42:13.480 --> 42:19.720]  body scanners death obsessed culture not gun rights to blame for Batman
[42:19.720 --> 42:26.640]  shooting second amendment foe Bloomberg exploits Colorado flashback Alex Jones
[42:26.640 --> 42:34.640]  predicted dark night rise would cause terror and it continues horrible Warner
[42:34.640 --> 42:40.600]  Brothers paired dark night rises with trailer of gangster shoot-up movie
[42:40.600 --> 42:45.400]  theater which studio didn't take down until I complained that's from deadline
[42:45.400 --> 42:49.320]  Hollywood see this is all a scythe ladies and gentlemen and I said this
[42:49.320 --> 42:52.240]  morning they're gonna be copycats and they've got police they've canceled the
[42:52.240 --> 42:56.720]  premiere in Paris they're canceling premieres all over in New York they've
[42:56.720 --> 43:00.720]  got to have police guarded oh but people said it's just a movie there's no power
[43:00.720 --> 43:06.520]  in a movie Alex it's not conditioning anybody folks I know brainwashing when
[43:06.520 --> 43:11.920]  I see it your subconscious mind you can debate is hundreds some say even a
[43:11.920 --> 43:18.080]  thousand times more powerful intuition is just the mega computer that is your
[43:18.080 --> 43:23.600]  electrochemical brain that can pick up on things okay it's called the gut it's
[43:23.600 --> 43:29.400]  really the supercomputer but that's where your adrenals are based so when
[43:29.400 --> 43:32.000]  you're when your brains worried about something that you feel at your stomach
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.080]  you feel it your spine because there's your brain continues down through your
[43:36.080 --> 43:42.720]  spine and into the ganglia and your stomach the brain is system-wide it's
[43:42.720 --> 43:46.080]  like break your source had a brain in its head and the brain in its back it's
[43:46.080 --> 43:51.200]  really we've got the brain is our nerve endings throughout our body your eyes
[43:51.200 --> 43:57.200]  our brain nerve stocks that grew out during embryonic development your brain
[43:57.200 --> 44:01.760]  is hooked into everything in your body that's why you get a tingle when you
[44:01.760 --> 44:06.200]  know something's dangerous something's bad or you don't trust somebody so I've
[44:06.200 --> 44:10.080]  got my supercomputer aimed at this trailers and I just said that's it it's
[44:10.080 --> 44:14.040]  Occupy Wall Street it's gonna try to cause riots it's gonna try to demonize
[44:14.040 --> 44:18.560]  people that protest tyranny by the way we shot like 35 minutes to cut it down to
[44:18.560 --> 44:21.560]  nine minutes just people say oh Alex ought to have a better teleprompter
[44:21.560 --> 44:25.960]  Alex ought to have better writers this is right out of my mind and research you
[44:25.960 --> 44:30.240]  know what Rob Jacobson who put together our dark night the secrets of dark night
[44:30.240 --> 44:36.320]  leaked peace he's back there right now because I said it's probably gonna stage
[44:36.320 --> 44:40.880]  mass shootings and and it's gonna be a prelude to real terror attacks and then
[44:40.880 --> 44:45.600]  he kind of gauged it himself and didn't put that in there and I am and at the
[44:45.600 --> 44:47.720]  time I said why didn't you put in there and he goes well what if it doesn't
[44:47.720 --> 44:52.040]  happen and I said look you've got a count on me put it out just like I said
[44:52.040 --> 44:55.720]  machete would cause machete attacks it actually caused more than 10 but they
[44:55.720 --> 45:00.440]  were kept very quiet in the news there were racial attacks out in Southern
[45:00.440 --> 45:06.760]  California that day and the day after but listen the issue here is ladies and
[45:06.760 --> 45:10.480]  gentlemen is that he's back there right now not just getting the predictions I
[45:10.480 --> 45:15.560]  made but he's back there right now going and getting you know the clips we
[45:15.560 --> 45:21.600]  didn't use to show you but the point is they're about to pass the UN Treaty it's
[45:21.600 --> 45:27.400]  on the razor's edge if they can get it or not all of this is the whole world is
[45:27.400 --> 45:30.960]  a stage and they're their mass programming people they had a Batman
[45:30.960 --> 45:34.600]  comic where a Bane character shoots up a movie theater and blames it on Batman in
[45:34.600 --> 45:43.160]  85 that's up at info wars.com right now again ladies and gentlemen it happened
[45:43.160 --> 45:47.080]  right next to Columbine which if I had to go over that they they brought in a
[45:47.080 --> 45:51.200]  127 propane bombs everybody stood down the police were told to stand down half
[45:51.200 --> 45:54.480]  the school was empty none of the cops kids were there that day people were
[45:54.480 --> 45:57.840]  told don't go to school that day Harrison Clybold had made a movie how they
[45:57.840 --> 46:01.600]  were gonna kill everybody sponsored by the school that's how they got them to
[46:01.600 --> 46:04.200]  come take part of the drill they thought they were taking part of there were
[46:04.200 --> 46:07.560]  other shooters it was confirmed the SWAT team shot at least two of the kids
[46:07.560 --> 46:12.320]  that's Rocky Mountain News now defunct all of I have the editor on about this
[46:12.320 --> 46:18.400]  this whole that was a setup Columbine was a set up to pass a bunch of gun
[46:18.400 --> 46:25.200]  control legislation but it failed 12 years ago 1999 on Hitler's birthday
[46:25.320 --> 46:30.680]  now it's happened again with a guy in a advanced Department of Defense because
[46:30.680 --> 46:34.280]  that's who I went and looked it up that's who funds this program at Denver
[46:34.280 --> 46:40.520]  there neuroscience brain interface Theodore Kaczynski was in MK ultra a
[46:40.520 --> 46:49.880]  volunteer in a PhD program similar to that at Berkeley look it up that
[46:49.880 --> 46:55.680]  Berkeley or was it Princeton look it up LA Times I've seen this before I know
[46:55.680 --> 47:02.360]  what it looks like and my gut says staged stage my gut is a hundred percent
[47:02.360 --> 47:10.160]  staged staged there it is Washington Times the UN is coming for your guns on
[47:10.160 --> 47:18.920]  the heels of all of this God help us God help us coming up when I start the next
[47:18.920 --> 47:22.520]  hour I'm gonna go to your phone calls we're from police psychologist military
[47:22.520 --> 47:27.080]  I mean you disagree with me eight hundred two five nine nine two three one
[47:27.080 --> 47:34.120]  eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one let's go to a few clips from
[47:34.120 --> 47:37.880]  the nine and a half minute video I put out secrets of the dark night leaked it's
[47:37.880 --> 47:41.160]  now a flashback at info wars dot com flashback Alex Jones predicted dark
[47:41.160 --> 47:46.080]  night rise would cause terror I want to give a most valuable player in the fight
[47:46.080 --> 47:49.240]  for Liberty Award to Watson he's already written my four articles a day and is
[47:49.240 --> 47:52.760]  in there like a literal hydra of resistance against tyranny's pulling out a
[47:52.760 --> 47:56.640]  bunch of my quotes predicting this
[47:59.640 --> 48:07.480]  let's go ahead let's go ahead and go to the first of the leaked dark night rises
[48:07.480 --> 48:21.840]  here it is one of the most anticipated movies in a long time is about to come
[48:21.840 --> 48:28.840]  out the dark night rises get ready because we are going to leak spoil and
[48:28.840 --> 48:38.440]  decode the new Batman film that's coming out we're gonna get into the meaning
[48:38.440 --> 48:43.180]  behind the meaning the secrets behind the secrets but first understand this is
[48:43.180 --> 48:50.080]  one of the most successful propaganda franchises out there selling tyranny for
[48:50.080 --> 48:55.200]  all of you that say it's just a movie for more than 50 years the Department of
[48:55.200 --> 49:01.520]  Defense has paid and financed for most major action films they all have a
[49:01.520 --> 49:08.520]  unified propaganda message telling you on the idea that you're powerless and
[49:08.520 --> 49:15.000]  that you can't protect yourself only shadowy groups by violating your rights
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.720]  and liberties can keep you safe throughout the Batman franchise any
[49:19.720 --> 49:27.400]  vigilantes other than Batman are powerless pathetic fat stupid or
[49:27.400 --> 49:33.960]  psychopathic to understand the conclusion of the dark night series we
[49:33.960 --> 49:40.560]  first have to go back to the beginning in Batman begins a secret society known
[49:40.560 --> 49:47.640]  as the League of Shadows led by Rosal ghoul played by Liam Neeson seeks to
[49:47.640 --> 49:53.040]  put a poisonous psychotropic drug in the water supply to drive a Gotham the
[49:53.040 --> 49:58.600]  archetypal New York into total insanity then he will bring order out of the
[49:58.600 --> 50:03.600]  chaos and it's all informed people know governments have been fluoridating
[50:03.600 --> 50:08.640]  water supplies for more than 60 years causing brain damage and cancer all right
[50:08.640 --> 50:12.080]  so we see here now that's just the intro we come back I'm against the real
[50:12.080 --> 50:15.840]  meat of it where I talk about how it's a psychological assault to create the

[54:19.240 --> 54:23.360]  and Homeland Security has been calling for that because you know you're not
[54:23.360 --> 54:31.880]  even safe going to see a Batman movie nobody is safe unless the government's
[54:31.880 --> 54:37.520]  there to keep us safe and take all of our rides away the toll-free number to
[54:37.520 --> 54:39.560]  join us and we'll just open it up to everybody I just want to hear from
[54:39.560 --> 54:43.480]  psychologists police military I mean does anybody buy this that it's that it's
[54:43.480 --> 54:48.680]  that it's right outside Columbine high school again I mean just miles from it
[54:48.680 --> 54:53.480]  that it's a week and a half two weeks out from Obama saying he's gonna sign the
[54:53.480 --> 54:56.760]  treaty but they've only got a few votes they need in the Senate to restrict our
[54:56.760 --> 55:02.040]  guns I mean does anybody doubt what's happening and then it's guy in a mask
[55:02.040 --> 55:08.800]  who's in a government funded at the University of Denver brain interface
[55:08.800 --> 55:18.960]  neuroscience PhD stood it's always the same it's always the same there's no
[55:18.960 --> 55:23.760]  end to any of this I mean I remember telling Watson this morning I said you
[55:23.760 --> 55:26.600]  watch he's gonna be connected to some government program like Harrison Clyde
[55:26.600 --> 55:33.440]  bold I mean why does it always have to be the same thing this is I mean Jared Lee
[55:33.440 --> 55:36.320]  Loeffner I didn't want to believe that was an inside job and now we've talked
[55:36.320 --> 55:39.960]  to the federal informants it's come out they were investigating fast and furious
[55:39.960 --> 55:43.960]  I mean who wants to believe they ship almost 20,000 guns and hang grenades to
[55:43.960 --> 55:47.160]  Mexico and the memos come out they were gonna blame the Second Amendment with it
[55:47.160 --> 55:54.480]  they got caught they drug somebody up who mama ain't seen in weeks and has
[55:54.480 --> 56:00.440]  disappeared and is dropping out who's in a government funded mind control program
[56:00.440 --> 56:04.040]  they have the real shooters go in and do it they said there were multiple
[56:04.040 --> 56:07.400]  shooters people don't even know you know that it's real because they're so
[56:07.400 --> 56:10.920]  mind-controlled again that's the mind control of just movies that they're
[56:10.920 --> 56:15.720]  sitting there watching and thinking it's the movie so glued to it because those
[56:15.720 --> 56:20.960]  of us that are conscious and aren't set to go on a suspended disbelief we look
[56:20.960 --> 56:25.080]  at other people that are zombies watching television it's like hey hey Bob
[56:25.080 --> 56:28.120]  is watching the football game look you know let's go get some more beer or
[56:28.120 --> 56:34.240]  whatever they're like hey hey hey hey that's what it's like but this is even
[56:34.240 --> 56:41.720]  deeper with drugs it's a standard MO at the Reichstag at some of the Russian
[56:41.720 --> 56:45.960]  events and other events is that you have the drugged up Patsy like sir hand sir
[56:45.960 --> 56:51.960]  hand RFK shooting this is exactly what I thought would come out of it I knew the
[56:51.960 --> 56:57.240]  way they were hyping it with the police and the military and terrorism and just
[56:57.240 --> 57:03.960]  watching it that this is a major rollout for Psiop probably for stage terror
[57:03.960 --> 57:09.000]  attacks and other things to start unfolding definitely more shootings at
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.480]  movie theaters and then again oh I'm scared to go to the movie theater even
[57:12.480 --> 57:16.080]  though statistically you know you got a better chance of being run over today
[57:16.080 --> 57:18.480]  driving on the highway or you got a better chance to be start my lightning
[57:18.480 --> 57:24.280]  still it's there it's happening gotta have police gotta have TSA style at the
[57:24.280 --> 57:28.480]  prom you know they've got TSA at proms in New Mexico because just terrorists
[57:28.480 --> 57:33.800]  might strike and the new terrorists are white males we've seen that rolled out
[57:33.800 --> 57:37.760]  deal the branding it's not al-qaeda now it's the white male and here it is and
[57:37.760 --> 57:42.320]  it's all part of this fantasy land and even if he wasn't an official mind
[57:42.320 --> 57:46.280]  control victim he's somebody in neuroscience is I mean anybody tells
[57:46.280 --> 57:50.440]  you some of those psychiatrists and people the nuttiest folks around got
[57:50.440 --> 57:55.480]  nuts running the insane asylum got the inmates running the asylum literally I'll
[57:55.480 --> 57:58.520]  bet your bottom dollar even if he is under mind control which he probably is
[57:58.520 --> 58:05.480]  that he's on Prozac type drugs watch that's gonna come out later and I mean
[58:05.480 --> 58:13.760]  it just fits the standard MO 110% it's the same story with John Lennon oh if I
[58:13.760 --> 58:19.240]  could tell you the stuff I knew about John Lennon I think I'll just shut up
[58:19.240 --> 58:27.160]  right there John Lennon was killed by a mind control assassin okay and I've
[58:27.160 --> 58:30.280]  talked to people not just the evidence that proves it on the surface I mean I've
[58:30.280 --> 58:36.160]  talked to people that we're there okay I'm gonna shut up right there I'm gonna
[58:36.160 --> 58:41.200]  shut up right there all right we'll be right back stay with us

[1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:32.800]  because there might be a shooter even though Kurt Nemo just posted an article
[1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:37.760]  breaking down the statistics something to keep in mind is hysterical gun
[1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:42.480]  grabbers attack the Second Amendment you've got a better chance of being run
[1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:48.880]  over by a out-of-control pumpkin truck than you do I'm gonna go over this a
[1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:52.840]  little bit later if you just joined us ladies and gentlemen this is totally
[1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:58.520]  staged and it's just it's a no-brainer you add all of it together in the end
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:03.280]  the tragic shooting the 14 dead now they're saying baby shot at point blank
[1:01:03.280 --> 1:01:07.800]  range Bloomberg within hours saying turn in your guns but he's gonna hire some
[1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:11.800]  more government people with guns keep you safe it's just disgusting and now
[1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:17.160]  we're not talking about the implosion in Europe financially we're not talking
[1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:22.720]  about fast and furious or Obama rolling out the Hugo Chavez talk saying that if
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:28.120]  you own a business you didn't do it it belongs to the state now we're all
[1:01:28.120 --> 1:01:34.800]  busy sitting here talking about this shooting and there's the calls by the
[1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:40.560]  New York Times do something Romney do something Obama restrict those guns so
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:43.760]  we can live in crime infested areas like Chicago and New York where they have
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:47.600]  banned them and that had the highest crime rates in the country let's go to
[1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:52.680]  John in Texas John what is your gut on this whole thing two weeks before the
[1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:56.360]  gun control treaty and right down the street from Columbine that was a
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:02.880]  completely staged event hello Alex hey you know back in the 30s and 40s
[1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:07.800]  Hollywood referral with communists by there by the early 50s they pretty much
[1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:12.000]  driven them all out but in the early 60s they all filled her back in again and
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:15.280]  that's when we started seeing the glorification of drugs the glorification
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:19.240]  of sex the glorification of violence and as each century has gone by it's
[1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:24.120]  gotten to the extreme now whereas Katie barred a door to show anything and one
[1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:29.280]  guy wrote a while a while back and he said that what we call cultural
[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:32.680]  entertainment today is akin to the Roman Empire really much difference
[1:02:32.680 --> 1:02:36.600]  sexual effects the way they are that's it they created death of Seth's culture
[1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:39.960]  they got a bunch of psychologists saying that today even in England they've got
[1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:44.600]  articles like the Telegraph saying death obsessed culture that's what's causing
[1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:48.920]  this senseless type stuff and that's why we need our guns more than ever to
[1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:54.360]  protect ourselves from these demons and we all know Alex that you look at a
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:58.520]  communist goals communist rules for evolution they said get control of the
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:03.160]  media and stare to this where we're at now where they keep more use of the
[1:03:03.160 --> 1:03:08.520]  excuse keep more and more control over us and this guy may be a part of a plan
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:13.640]  or he could just be a typical cool kind of street caused by our culture but either
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:16.680]  way they're using this to push the communist goals the disarmamentists
[1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:21.440]  to put this into a world government well there's no doubt that what you're
[1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:26.080]  saying is absolutely on target John thank you for the call David in New
[1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:31.120]  Jersey you're on the air welcome thank you I just want to say on the Denver
[1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:36.960]  Airport mural kind of like exact sequence of events yeah I hadn't thought of that
[1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:40.560]  folks show the we actually have video of it in the computer file that the
[1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:44.720]  McBrain shot it is a guy in a trench coat with a breathing apparatus on his
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:49.640]  face like Bain shooting a bunch of little kids and then and there's a giant
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:53.240]  underground base right underneath it we've talked to the police that were
[1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:57.760]  there during the construction there's a giant underground prison relocation
[1:03:57.760 --> 1:04:01.040]  center right under it the shadow government space there and they have
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:06.440]  murals showing everything that's happened so far yes and why because they're
[1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:10.720]  into the occult and the and the alumnus believe you must show someone what
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:15.280]  you're going to do first before you do the actual act they call that lesser
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:20.080]  magic I'm sorry go ahead yeah and it's the exact sequence that comes out later
[1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:25.800]  in the mural is the burning of the guns and destroying of the guns disarmament
[1:04:25.800 --> 1:04:30.600]  you know you're right I even forgot about that guys can we pull our video of
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:33.800]  the mural I think it's in the computer system we'll try to have them we come
[1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:37.520]  out for breaks stay there I want you to elaborate on that that's what I mean it's
[1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:42.200]  just totally staged and then they have this is all a ritual and then later in
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:47.760]  the mural yeah they take the guns this is all a giant giant ritual because they
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:52.520]  had a trailer before showing the audience being shot up right before this
[1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:57.880]  happened they had a 1985 comic with the exact same thing happening in Batman it's
[1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:03.080]  all in your face this is mind control hope you enjoy it hi this is Alex Jones

[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:21.080]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:28.400]  Alex Jones they're saying that the Colorado shooter just miles from
[1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:32.600]  Columbine that shooting happened right before they were trying to pass anti-gun
[1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:38.480]  legislation they're saying ladies and gentlemen that he kicked in the big
[1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:42.640]  metal doors which anyone that's been around these modern theaters and it was
[1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:46.400]  a modern one knows you're not gonna kick one of those down without a battering
[1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:53.040]  ram but he knocks it down he's wearing a mask and now they found him and lo and
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:09:00.600]  behold he was in a government-funded brain research program as a PhD
[1:09:00.600 --> 1:09:10.760]  student in neurosciences that is being reported right now isn't that just
[1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:18.440]  interesting he was a neuroscience PhD student just like Theodore Kaczynski when
[1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:22.400]  he got recruited into MKUltra oh you didn't know that's in the LA Times that
[1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:27.560]  the the unabomber was in the MKUltra mind control program oh but never mind
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:31.280]  that or Tim McVeigh's doctor from the time he was captured until he was
[1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:35.120]  executed was jolly and Wes who just died two years ago who was the number 200
[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:40.480]  Dr. Ewing Cameron the head of MKUltra who admittedly kidnapped thousands of
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:46.160]  children and reprogrammed them with new personalities that's history channel they
[1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:50.960]  had him in Maryland also up in Toronto big mind control basis that's that that
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:57.760]  that's declassified but the fact that oh his number two was McVeigh's doctor all
[1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:04.440]  those years nothing to see here move along or that Harris and Clybald were
[1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:09.000]  connected to similar programs and that whole story and people reporting
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:12.920]  multiple shooters and now we have the Denver Airport that has murals about
[1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:17.720]  underground bases and a big Bane character with a breathing mask a gas
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:24.360]  mask on killing children with a machine gun and a sword and then next to the
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:30.720]  mural it shows guns being destroyed after that they love it they love
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:43.960]  throwing it in your face over and over and over and over again of all the
[1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:47.680]  places it could happen right by column by another guy in a black trench coat
[1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:52.400]  wearing a Bane breathing mask oh but he's wearing a mask we don't know again
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:57.480]  this is standard black op you send in your team this even came out I said this
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:02.280]  about the attacks in India remember that a few years ago and I said those guys
[1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:05.280]  weren't Muslim extremists they look like they're on drugs in the few videos
[1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:11.120]  turned out they were on PCP LSD had injectors just whacked out of their minds
[1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:15.320]  landed in boats and the head of Indian security said it was staged by the West
[1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:21.720]  he got killed that day and then it came out in the news later in the Chicago
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:27.600]  Tribune other papers that indeed a CIA operative had been running the attacks
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:33.800]  in India to be blamed on Muslim extremists this I mean this is literally
[1:11:33.800 --> 1:11:36.680]  the Manchurian candidate you seen the remake of that with Denzel Washington
[1:11:36.680 --> 1:11:41.120]  folks that in that in fiction that's fiction showing you what's really going
[1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:49.800]  on I can tell you that people very close to John Lennon there's a lot you don't
[1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:53.760]  know about that and not just the fact of the person was under mind control that
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:57.840]  did it was programmed by the catcher in the rye and so was the shooter of Reagan
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:03.280]  I mean folks this is programming they've they've had for hundreds of years a
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:06.560]  flower that was in the news fact I forget the name but we guys type in drugs
[1:12:06.560 --> 1:12:10.600]  that makes you do whatever you're told drug that makes you helplessly I mean
[1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:14.600]  they they say a hundred percent of people that are given this drug
[1:12:14.600 --> 1:12:19.200]  scapala mean out of the flower there it is that there that you tell them stick
[1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:22.640]  your hand the blender chop your baby up with a meat flavor jump off that cliff
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:28.080]  give me all your jewelry you do it well yeah that's that's just what drug dealers
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:35.080]  and criminals can do blowing some of this in your face this is what they do
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:39.600]  sir hand sir hand was on an amnesiac that's come out the LAPD said he didn't
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:46.840]  shoot JFK RFK excuse me so right as they want to pass the UN treaty right as
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:50.800]  they don't have two votes they need the Senate right as all this happens right
[1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:54.000]  as the campaign heats up and they're now saying this is gonna be Obama's new
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.960]  campaign he's praying for those killed 14 dead now including a baby shot right
[1:12:57.960 --> 1:13:01.720]  in the face and curtain him up breaks down the statistics that one of the
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:06.760]  lowest forms of death is mass shooting yes the numbers up there Kurt might just
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:10.840]  change that headline to like you know give a better chance of dying from you
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:14.840]  know an infection in a hospital hundreds of times better than dying of mass
[1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:18.480]  shooting I don't mean the statistics are very important though good job on that
[1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:25.960]  now I'm gonna go to your phone calls already went to a couple but remember
[1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:33.200]  eight federal agencies eight federal agencies eight eight federal agencies
[1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:39.800]  FBI ATF you name it together knowingly ship guns upwards of 20,000
[1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:45.320]  hang grenades over three years to Mexico to blame the second amendment that came
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:50.320]  out in the ATF memos I saw him two and a half years ago raiding gun shows and
[1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:54.000]  stuff for no reason and setting people up with fake IDs oh you know having
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:59.240]  legal going by gun with a fake ID the private seller sells it to him and they
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:03.920]  go to jail the system plays on the significance and I said look that you
[1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:06.960]  know they're saying restrict guns because of Mexico they're staging this this is
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:11.640]  staged boom it all came out because I had sources inside the DEA like Celica
[1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:19.640]  still I mean we're on record folks we're on record with this now generally with
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:24.920]  all I knew with this dark night thing was Bain was seen you know fighting the
[1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:29.120]  government anti Wall Street that's what a demonized protesters are the same guy
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:35.080]  that wrote the dark night rises you know it puts together the call of duty stuff
[1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:38.960]  where the new bad guy coming out the new one is an anti government type I mean
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:42.480]  this is what they're doing this is the message being sold to create this
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:46.880]  illusion that we're under real terror attacks and mass shootings when it's not
[1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:51.240]  really happening there it is the most dangerous drug in the world devil's
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:55.440]  breath chemical from Colombia and block free will white memory and even kill
[1:14:55.440 --> 1:15:00.480]  it's capolamine often blowing the faces of victims and added to drinks with
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:04.440]  admittance victims are like zombies coherent but with no free will yeah you
[1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:13.520]  say go in there and shoot all these people and you go do it oh but nothing
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:16.440]  to worry about it it's always the same MO but they don't ever trust these guys
[1:15:16.440 --> 1:15:20.400]  to do that they put on a mask the operative goes and kills people then
[1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:25.720]  they have the person blasted out of their mind like the shooter with a
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:29.160]  congresswoman Giffords who you know dressing up as women taking elucid
[1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:32.960]  engines every day disappearing for months and then goes and shoots people
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:36.240]  about to expose fashion furious and a bipartisan move because Giffords was
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:39.880]  pro-second amendment we've confirmed through investigative journalists Wayne
[1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:44.320]  Baxter and others he said this before it even came out and then it came out in
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:49.280]  the news and it's just amazing I want to go to another clip from the video
[1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:52.400]  leaked dark night rises I understand I came in here and showed up with 35
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:55.920]  minutes Rob Jacobson cut it down to about nine and a half he's in there
[1:15:55.920 --> 1:16:02.440]  right now from the same shoot going back into the video where I were he cut it
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:05.600]  saying oh what if it doesn't happen I talked about this could cause mass
[1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:09.800]  shootings mass riots I believe it's a trigger look I know when something's a
[1:16:09.800 --> 1:16:13.920]  trigger what do I say at the end for the video this is this is high-tech
[1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:20.160]  brainwashing and propaganda again if movies don't have power why are they
[1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:25.440]  posting guards all the movie theaters because there may be some copycats here
[1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:31.160]  let's go ahead and that's why advertising is powerful it's why you
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:36.720]  have billboards and ads because we are social creatures we do get conditioned
[1:16:36.720 --> 1:16:41.760]  especially when we're unconscious all subliminals do is make me physically ill
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:45.040]  they do not work on me anymore
[1:16:45.680 --> 1:16:49.640]  makes me ill because I'm watching it my brain's picking it up and the consciousness
[1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:53.880]  trying to analyze it from that data well and you know it's like a computer with
[1:16:53.880 --> 1:16:56.720]  the pin with the pinwheel of death or something it's just like you know
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:17:00.520]  Danger Will Robinson and I saw these trailers and went and found out what
[1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:03.680]  the movie is about I'm like look out here's where I talk about a galleon
[1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:08.480]  dialectic problem reaction solution false flag and people helplessly in the
[1:17:08.480 --> 1:17:12.640]  theater being being conditioned in a mass mind control event this is mind
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:17.720]  control these films are mind control here it is not just these Batman films
[1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:23.520]  every one of these films has terrorist blowing up major cities constantly to
[1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:28.280]  create the psychological illusion that there's big sharks out there that want
[1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:32.400]  to eat you and there's terrorists under every table that want to attack you and
[1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:37.360]  your family and you notice at the end of Jaws the shark has been killed he's been
[1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:43.520]  defeated but still the beaches remained empty you are being subconsciously
[1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:48.840]  programmed when you go in one of these movies and just turn yourself over to it
[1:17:48.840 --> 1:17:53.920]  and suspended disbelief you become a willing victim to have your mind
[1:17:53.920 --> 1:17:59.080]  literally programmed in that key fear state because when the mind is in that
[1:17:59.080 --> 1:18:04.440]  fear state it is wide open to be reprogrammed and now in the new film we
[1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:10.880]  see the football game blown up we see the police helpless if the state doesn't
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:15.440]  take every right we've got and turn our children against us and set up highway
[1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:20.600]  checkpoints and launch 30,000 armed drones and listen to our phone calls then
[1:18:20.600 --> 1:18:25.840]  none of us are safe because the non-existent threat of Usama bin Laden
[1:18:25.840 --> 1:18:33.240]  and Al C. I. Ada and Bain are gonna get us the key to understanding why the
[1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:37.000]  social engineers want males in an arrested development junior high
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:43.920]  mentality state is simple through thousands of films and video games we
[1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:49.880]  are bombarded with the idea that threats always come in the form of a giant
[1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:55.720]  evil monster or terrorist who openly announces themselves not through slow
[1:18:55.720 --> 1:19:01.440]  cultural death and men are presented with an idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger the
[1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:07.160]  Herculean figure or somebody like Batman defeating the enemy all by
[1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:12.320]  themselves because the public is powerless that's why now when I talk to
[1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:16.200]  so many men they say oh you're such a hero you go out and confront politicians
[1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:20.080]  you go out and you know fight for freedom I'm glad you're there what do you
[1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:22.320]  mean I'm just an average person like you
[1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:27.720]  I'm fighting big green Martians from Mars but again what does this do a guy
[1:19:27.720 --> 1:19:30.600]  dressed up like Bain shows up and kills a bunch of people who's in a
[1:19:30.600 --> 1:19:38.160]  government-sponsored university brain neuro interface system perfect cover
[1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:42.120]  but their operatives to get to him to drug him up to play the part of the
[1:19:42.120 --> 1:19:45.920]  patsy that's how these emos work and then now they're blurring it all together
[1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:52.200]  where people again see these movies as even more more real all of this to get
[1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:55.840]  the UN treaty passed it's all about global governments it's all of an
[1:19:55.840 --> 1:20:01.160]  exercise in mind control your calls coming up stay with us

[1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:16.720]  trailer was playing showing people being shot in a movie theater from behind
[1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:25.840]  the screen as it happened and now notice this is set in Gotham which is supposed
[1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:30.200]  to be New York I said that before and somebody sent me an email or a comment
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:35.320]  saying oh no it's Chicago no no Gotham the creator of Batman has said you can
[1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:39.400]  look it up on Wikipedia is New York that's how dumb these comic book people
[1:24:39.400 --> 1:24:42.600]  are some of them again nothing against comic books unless you act like it's
[1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:46.760]  real and you're a full-grown man and you can't take criticism of it and the fact
[1:24:46.760 --> 1:24:50.440]  that it's being used as a vehicle to propagandize you say it's just a movie
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:56.360]  it's just a movie because you're like a child this isn't just a movie this is
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:25:01.040]  propaganda this is conditioning the messages in these films are put there by
[1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:06.840]  the Department of Defense it's paid for it's on record this is about collapsing
[1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:11.960]  society right as it's happening listen to this notice the commissioner is in
[1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:15.960]  Batman now the commissioner from New York with the mayor who wants guns banned
[1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:20.280]  nationwide and who's calling for gun control is saying I'm gonna protect movie
[1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:27.040]  theaters in New York from the Joker see they're merging reality and unreality at
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:31.240]  the subconscious level now with the conscious where people now are being
[1:25:31.240 --> 1:25:36.360]  taught oh no it's real you could die oh it's so exciting when you go see Batman
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:43.600]  he see Kelly police commissioner oh wow Colorado movie theater shooting suspect
[1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:46.720]  claimed to be Batman nemesis the Joker really he was dressed up in all black
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:51.680]  with a map with a gas mask on I thought that's Bane Newark police commissioner
[1:25:51.680 --> 1:25:56.200]  Ray Kelly said the gunman suspected of attacking the crowded movie theater in
[1:25:56.200 --> 1:26:00.080]  Aurora, Colorado resembled Batman's arch villain and I was gonna be in
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:04.200]  Colorado right now but I canceled the trip that's really weird somebody's
[1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:07.360]  not just saying Obama was in Colorado guys can you look at see if Obama was in
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:11.720]  Colorado yesterday just type it news Obama Colorado click news I want to see
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:17.400]  we have some information again this is New York inserting itself for like this
[1:26:17.400 --> 1:26:20.520]  illusion that the mafia police of New York or some are actually fighting
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:24.360]  villains man that this is total mind control most of it is public it clearly
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:27.960]  looks like a deranged individual he has his hair painted red and he was the
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:32.600]  Joker obviously the enemy of Batman this is this is the police commissioner
[1:26:32.600 --> 1:26:38.080]  like it's a cartoon you can see how they wrote this in Psyops to even merge it
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:41.640]  like the commissioners fighting the Joker when I first read this I thought
[1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:46.360]  this has got to be a hoax but no it's see it CBS AP and they've got the police
[1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:50.520]  out everywhere at the movie theaters protecting you from the Joker and the
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:56.480]  police chief saying it like it's like he's fighting the Joe my god I mean this
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:27:01.240]  is incredible again for two years the beaches were almost empty after Jaws
[1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:06.480]  came out in the 75 this is the mind control that's what I covered earlier we
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:09.640]  have some common information most of it is public it clearly looks like a
[1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:12.200]  deranged individual this is what he's saying like they're like he's on the
[1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:16.160]  run he has his hair painted red he said he was the Joker obviously the enemy of
[1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:19.440]  Batman this is quotes by the police commissioner Kelly said the news
[1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:23.680]  conference afternoon I've been to urban warfare drills where they blow up a bus
[1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:27.800]  or a police car you've seen it in road to tyranny and then the mayor announces
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:31.840]  they were hit by by terrorists with the army and they put it on the news and the
[1:27:31.840 --> 1:27:36.520]  next day in the paper it says terrorists hit melted and then later at the end
[1:27:36.520 --> 1:27:41.040]  it's like but it was only a drill it's to it's to have that subconscious effect
[1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:45.320]  as a simulant that real terrorists are hitting but to make it even more they
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:50.080]  add a little shooting on to it and then they come out and now Gotham actually is
[1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:55.240]  fighting the Joker and is going to protect you instead of Coney who'd been
[1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:58.840]  dead for five and a half years now they have been made all of Africa for a dead
[1:27:58.840 --> 1:28:04.480]  guy and now the invasion happened just like they have the simulant bin Laden
[1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:08.920]  been dead probably before 9-11 certainly right after kidney failure but he's this
[1:28:08.920 --> 1:28:12.200]  boogeyman who's going to get you and then they they kill him at the body
[1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:16.600]  thrown in the ocean and then that holds I mean ladies and gentlemen this is this
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:20.160]  is because and you as a radio listener is somebody who's informed you're like
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:24.640]  this sounds crazy yeah but you talk about your neighbors I go see these action
[1:28:24.640 --> 1:28:27.640]  adventure movies I go out with the crew maybe every few months one comes out we

[1:28:55.240 --> 1:28:59.160]  a stupid guys little outfits fighting but it's like oh this is manliness

[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:07.840]  video games or their movies or any of this all the real world's going on all
[1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:11.320]  around you and the cops are actually dressed like Bane and acting like Bane

[1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:49.440]  weeks before obama is set to sign the un treaty that he's very close to being
[1:33:49.440 --> 1:33:53.880]  able to ratify that is right on the razor's edge of being ratified by the
[1:33:53.880 --> 1:33:59.320]  Senate they only need a few votes that magically to register and then even ban
[1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:06.640]  many of our firearms even forms reports that magically this happens then you add
[1:34:06.640 --> 1:34:12.960]  on top of that the fact that this happened right outside Columbine with
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:17.280]  that extremely suspicious event that had globalist operations written all over
[1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:25.160]  it where you had 127 propane bombs placed in the building you had Harrison
[1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:29.840]  Clybold saying they would do it no one stopping on making a movie about doing
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:35.720]  it at the school that aired half the people not being in the school none of
[1:34:35.720 --> 1:34:40.480]  the police children being in the school the SWAT teams admittedly killing two of
[1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:45.040]  the kids that came out local newspapers all sorts of weirdness multiple
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:48.240]  shooters the fact that happened a few weeks before they were trying to re-up
[1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:54.360]  gun control legislation all of this happening
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:35:08.360]  now we're sitting here watching all of this unfold and we now have this is
[1:35:08.360 --> 1:35:15.000]  definitely a sigh up we now have CBS news coming out and reporting with the
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:21.320]  police commissioner which is Gotham New York that we believe he's the Joker and
[1:35:21.320 --> 1:35:28.080]  we're gonna keep you safe to just mix reality with fantasy and the entire film

[1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:45.120]  Joker New York police commissioner Ray Kelly said the gunman's suspected
[1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:48.320]  attacking crowd of movie theater in Colorado resembled Batman Archville on
[1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:52.200]  the Joker time of the shocking attack now listen now he says this we have some
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:56.120]  information most of its public it clearly looks like a deranged individual he
[1:35:56.120 --> 1:36:00.360]  had his hair painted red he was the Joker obviously the enemy of Batman these
[1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:05.320]  are quotes so they're just again the whole movie's about the cops the NYPD was
[1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:09.000]  involved it's all about how they're heroes I mean this is so in your face
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:14.240]  when they just blur at all Kelly said at a news conference afternoon this is a
[1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:19.720]  test for the new civilization where they just blur movies with reality that I
[1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:25.000]  mean this is a new level of mind control we're witnessing Kelly said the NYPD is
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.760]  stepping up security at movie theaters around the city after James Holmes because
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:32.120]  now Batman villains are gonna be attacking during the movie you see this
[1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:36.400]  is this is this is now creating I mean you think Jaws keeps people out of the
[1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:40.680]  ocean for years after it came out believe that the mechanical shark was
[1:36:40.680 --> 1:36:43.400]  out there we had a better chance of being struck by lightning twice in one
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:47.960]  year five shark deaths worldwide a year on average from great whites imagine now
[1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:51.880]  when there's real attacks at the theaters by the very villains and then the
[1:36:51.880 --> 1:36:54.920]  police chief and the police commissioner comes out and says we're gonna
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:36:58.400]  have checkpoints everywhere and all the rest of which they already have to keep
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:05.520]  you safe from the Joker I mean don't people see this I mean I learned this
[1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:10.400]  again watching them do drills in Seattle and in Belton Texas and other areas
[1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:15.760]  where they blow stuff up and announce it was real and then maybe at the end of an
[1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:18.800]  hour-long thing say by the way this was just a drill or at the bottom of the
[1:37:18.800 --> 1:37:23.040]  article I mean just really and I was there when the mayor did it in
[1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:27.320]  Belton he was all smiling a wild-eyed we've been hit by terrorists it's really
[1:37:27.320 --> 1:37:30.880]  been horrible and I'm sitting there with the cops all smiling and they had kids
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:34.240]  with their fake guts blown out and stuff and locals were showing up in the
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:37.800]  army was holding them back going oh I can't tell you what's happening with
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:42.920]  smoking vehicles and I and the military over to me and said get out of here they
[1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:49.240]  were running a Psyop on the town that's what this is folks again you know it
[1:37:49.240 --> 1:37:54.720]  staged not just by where it happened the timing of it but by the way they
[1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:59.720]  respond already with their statements early this morning all rolling out with
[1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:03.680]  press conferences about yeah he's the Joker Batman's enemy we'll keep you

[1:38:16.520 --> 1:38:20.000]  NYPD is stepping up security at movie theaters around the city at per suspect
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  James Holmes walked into the Colorado movie theater during midnight showing
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:27.480]  no he kicked down the door of the new Batman movie the dark night rises and
[1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:32.240]  open fire killing 12 people another saying 14 and injuring dozens more police
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:35.240]  commissioner just like in the movie there's a police commissioner called
[1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:39.840]  and it's New York but but but again because it's Batman and Gotham's New
[1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:45.920]  York they're responding like it's real in the middle of it he talked about the
[1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:52.280]  Joker there's an individual the Joker the enemy Batman right there we're on the
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:56.640]  lookout we're like extra officers out there the Joker yes we're we're dealing
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:04.720]  with him right now Gotham I am the commissioner Ray Kelly police commissioner
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:08.480]  Ray Kelly called the shooting horrendous and said the NYPD is working to keep
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:13.960]  moviegoers safe as a precaution against copycats and the rise of comfort levels
[1:39:13.960 --> 1:39:18.160]  among movie patrons in the wake of the horrendous shooting in Colorado the New
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:22.040]  York City Police Department is providing coverage at theaters where the dark
[1:39:22.040 --> 1:39:27.240]  night rises is playing in five boroughs Kelly shit everybody said again we have
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:31.640]  some information most of it public it's clearly looks like a deranged
[1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:37.360]  individual he had his hair painted red he said he was the Joker obviously the
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:43.360]  enemy of Batman Kelly sat in a news conference afternoon but don't worry
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:48.560]  extra officers are out there to keep you safe from Bain the Joker and any other
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:53.560]  dangerous crime and oh now it's even selling out more and it's so fun to go
[1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:57.640]  maybe you'll get shot at it you know forget scratching sniff you know they
[1:39:57.640 --> 1:40:02.600]  had that movies in the 70s where you scratched it and smelled it hey you
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:06.680]  never know a gal pop out in a Bain outfit or Joker outfit and shoot you oh
[1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:13.600]  but movies aren't powerful oh no oh no there's nothing going on here he was
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:18.480]  just in the neuroscience department their Department of Defense funded just
[1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:27.680]  follows the exact MO of Reagan RFK John Lennon on and on oh here's Russia today
[1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:34.560]  which is based on the Russian government bus bombing does Iran really need to
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:41.720]  attack Israeli tourists and then it goes on I actually have the article here it's
[1:40:41.720 --> 1:40:47.400]  another RT article saying that the other bombing in Europe was a false flag guys
[1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:51.560]  just reprint that for me arm or I'll never be able to find it now the point
[1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:58.840]  is this stuff is really happening and even if it was some guy on Prozac or
[1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:02.600]  something who was in a fantasy land and that's maybe a 5% chance out of a
[1:41:02.600 --> 1:41:06.160]  hundred it's still mind control because this is this culture and it's not just
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:09.200]  Alex Jones saying that
[1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:13.000]  psychologists writers they're out there the London Telegraph you name it saying
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:17.280]  it's the culture of death the culture of sadism that people think so cool the
[1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:20.600]  simulated murders the violent video games where people don't have a
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:25.440]  compulsion against it folks used to throw up if they saw violence both my
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:28.000]  grandfathers didn't like violence because they'd really seen violence
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  especially my grandfather that you know was flying around in World War two he
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:39.280]  wouldn't tell you war stories none of those guys would they didn't like I mean
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:42.600]  they saw violence or blood dripping out of somebody's mouth in a movie my
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:46.280]  grandfather would grab my dad by the hand and take him out it wasn't because
[1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:52.240]  he couldn't handle it it was because it was real violence wasn't a joke but see
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:55.440]  all these other people like just your death carnage murder it's so much fun
[1:41:55.440 --> 1:41:59.480]  people sit there and giggle and laugh in movies when kids are being tortured I've
[1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:05.000]  seen it myself when I went and saw natural-born killers when it first came
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:08.800]  out the audience was laughing and getting on getting off on it and I wasn't
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:13.600]  sophisticated enough then I was just in college to understand that this was
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:19.720]  saying violence on TV as he sensitized this and made it sick that's what Oliver
[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:24.800]  Stone was saying was look how sick this is look how in your face this is look at
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:29.560]  how they think it's funny look at how the media exacerbates this and pushes
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:34.960]  this culture that I thought oh my god I was projecting the people liking it on
[1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:41.560]  to the movie it was the people that didn't get the movie the movie was saying
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:46.760]  this is wrong and boy these folks that are into violence they love it when it
[1:42:46.760 --> 1:42:51.320]  happens other people till it happens to them and they cry like little babies
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:59.920]  yeah this isn't it this is a new RT that just if you type false flag into
[1:42:59.920 --> 1:43:05.160]  Google news into NSA news and click it it's the top link or at least it was this
[1:43:05.160 --> 1:43:09.760]  morning there's a whole bunch of false flag news not not web news false flag
[1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:16.800]  and it's our team it'll come up thank you already have that one

[1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:27.400]  that this is so again for people that are childlike and don't understand how
[1:43:27.400 --> 1:43:31.400]  this works for somebody who researches this you know it when you see it I mean
[1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:35.040]  I saw the trailer and said look out it's a galleon dialectic getting you ready
[1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:38.320]  for terror and creating the illusion that there is all this terror and now
[1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:41.120]  they've rolled it out and the way New York and others are announcing it the
[1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:45.400]  way Obama is already seizing on it and calling for our guns the way a surrogates
[1:43:45.400 --> 1:43:50.440]  Bloomberg ABC and others are we're in deep trouble you've got the British
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:55.000]  imported globalist I think it's British but just against you know Pierce Morgan

[1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:10.240]  ahead yeah I got a show that's going science channel called dark matters I
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:16.640]  don't know if you ever heard of it or this week's episode happens to be about
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:21.760]  breath washing I don't know what it's gonna entail or what's gonna be on it
[1:45:21.760 --> 1:45:28.840]  but it looks like it might be of interest well look my control is real and
[1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:33.440]  we know what it looks like and generally I forget which one I hair is but one was
[1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:40.040]  an Air Force scientist in secret weapons the other was in psych warfare and it's
[1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:44.920]  like the same thing because then skis in psych warfare a volunteer for MK ultra
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:49.240]  real mind control LA times you name it oh I think other publications as well
[1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:52.640]  Alexander Cochran wrote the article for LA times that's how good my memory is on
[1:45:52.640 --> 1:46:00.520]  that and then it turns out he's in a PhD brain interface neurological system and
[1:46:00.520 --> 1:46:03.640]  all that stuff's funded Department of Defense I mean it's just always the same
[1:46:03.640 --> 1:46:08.680]  it's always the same they use these programs at universities as hatcheries
[1:46:08.680 --> 1:46:13.160]  for mind control I mean that's where they get them I mean it just like it's like
[1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:19.400]  McVeigh had the famous mind control doctor for a decade before they executed
[1:46:19.400 --> 1:46:27.000]  Jolly and West I mean how obvious sir how obvious is it that they that they're
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:31.960]  having the UN treaty in the next two weeks how obvious is that this is all
[1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:37.040]  just making me all my friends are aware how much of this is really not parent
[1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:41.200]  into me but the whole show dark math I can't even watch it most of the time
[1:46:41.200 --> 1:46:46.000]  because it makes it pretty squeamish all but it's all sir I'll have to look into
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:51.280]  it I appreciate your call let's go to Kenneth and Kansas here on the air hey
[1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:54.920]  Alex has a change the channel Kenneth where hey buddy hadn't heard from you
[1:46:54.920 --> 1:46:59.640]  while are you doing I'm doing good doing good I just want to touch base a
[1:46:59.640 --> 1:47:05.000]  little bit about the about the shoot you know my condolences go out to the
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:09.320]  family it's a tragedy and all of that but at the same time you know it's
[1:47:09.320 --> 1:47:14.120]  reading through a lot of threads comment threads and you know the the second
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:17.720]  amendment anti-second amendment nuts out there just going off about it that
[1:47:17.720 --> 1:47:23.160]  this is proof that you know that we need to ban guns and all of this and as I'm
[1:47:23.160 --> 1:47:27.680]  going through there I'll see a video there of surveillance camera down in
[1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:34.080]  Florida where it's old timers in there and in the internet cafe and armed guy
[1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:40.200]  comes in there with one with a gun and other with a baseball bat smashes the
[1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:44.800]  computer throws the gun up there's no time it comes out with a little 25 or
[1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:49.640]  something like that wounds the one guy I mean it's all happened within like 10
[1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:53.840]  seconds and these both of these guys are running out the door he locks the door
[1:47:53.840 --> 1:47:57.720]  you know until the police get there I've seen that video was on info or is the
[1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:06.200]  other day I forget the exact name but it was basically you know man defeats
[1:48:06.200 --> 1:48:12.800]  robbers with gun I forget the statistic I think it's 24 times is it 21 times more
[1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:17.320]  often guns are used to stop crimes than they're used in crimes look the system
[1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:20.160]  knows that but but I mean what do you think about the timing of this and they
[1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:24.360]  would stage fast and furious it's real simple if they would stage fast and
[1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:29.680]  furious why wouldn't they stage this oh definitely definitely it's kind of you
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:34.640]  know it's a little strange that this guy's got like a bulletproof vest on
[1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:38.920]  all of this and you know it's like he's coming in there to do all of this but
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:44.400]  then he just gets captured peacefully by the police it seems like there you go
[1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:50.320]  same MO they always get oh my gosh this is so insane important at this time that
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:53.640]  we can base that second amendment I mean think about if that old timer would
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:57.280]  have been in there or some you know armed citizens would have been in there I
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:03.720]  mean people could have been saved that's another great point they had they had
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:07.800]  another shooting in Colorado that church but the guy can only shoot one person
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:12.160]  before the woman who had a concealed carry who was there as security pulled
[1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:15.720]  her gun and shot him remember that case a couple years ago they got almost no
[1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:22.080]  attention because she stopped him dead in the tracks you know and that's I think
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:26.280]  people really need to embrace the second amendment instead of trying to you
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:31.800]  know fight it and all of this I did a video about it about guns and gun
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:34.680]  control been doing a lot of that lately because there's a lot of this stuff
[1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:38.600]  going down and and people like we don't need guns and all of that and I'm like
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:43.200]  well the world was not a peaceful place but we had guns I mean people were
[1:49:43.200 --> 1:49:47.320]  stabbing each other killing each other you ban guns now and you know who's
[1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:53.320]  gonna have the guns the criminals it's that's logic well what do you think
[1:49:53.320 --> 1:49:56.120]  about the weird way the New York Commissioner knowing that it's all
[1:49:56.120 --> 1:50:00.520]  based you know in iconography with New York Commissioner up there announcing
[1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:04.600]  it like yes we know it's the Joker the enemy of Batman these are quotes and

[1:50:53.320 --> 1:50:57.000]  at their minimum that the SWAT team killed not one but two of the kids and
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:01.840]  the hundreds of bombs and all the rest of it that was a government op period

[1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:36.840]  blood on my blade the master taught me in the spring of twenty five but I am
[1:54:36.840 --> 1:54:42.200]  still alive look for breaking news with a Dave Mustaine over the weekend I was
[1:54:42.200 --> 1:54:50.520]  leaving at that mega death I'll be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. central got a
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:54.840]  whole another hour plus coming up a lot of other news ladies and gentlemen I
[1:54:54.840 --> 1:55:00.720]  tell you what I really think okay and I think this was a staged event in fact I
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:07.680]  know it was my gut tells me it was a staged event of course he was in some
[1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:13.400]  advanced mind interface computer system and that and they test that stuff out
[1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:18.040]  on the people that are in the PhD programs I've seen it over and over again
[1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:25.120]  not just with the unabomber being in a CIA program as a PhD MK ultra but so many
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:31.000]  others I they would use doctor programs and psychologists the CIA would with
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:35.320]  people's young children and then say let us you know your child has problems let
[1:55:35.320 --> 1:55:39.960]  us commit them and then they would even stage their deaths and take the kid and
[1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:44.000]  reprogram them this is on history channel this is mainline here this is
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:50.880]  declassified look up dr. Ewing Cameron just I've studied it so I know what it
[1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:53.800]  looks like and then I know for some of the general public they're like well
[1:55:53.800 --> 1:55:57.880]  how do you know of course actually almost everybody I see out there is going
[1:55:57.880 --> 1:56:01.640]  no no no I mean yeah they're about to try to pass the UN thing they can Obama was
[1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:09.600]  right on it you know the way that they were hyping this in the dark night
[1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:16.640]  rises all of this just makes my head spin quite frankly they are coming after
[1:56:16.640 --> 1:56:20.040]  our guns you've noticed the last three weeks I've just been second amendment
[1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:24.480]  second amendment second amendment because the analysis has been done by the
[1:56:24.480 --> 1:56:29.880]  Washington Times by even Forbes we've had our expert Bob Daisy probably one of
[1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:33.160]  the best out there as he researches it constantly new American second amendment
[1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:37.280]  writer he writes for new America on that and on SPP and I mean they plan to take
[1:56:37.280 --> 1:56:44.640]  our guns and this may create copycats that's the thing that's mind control the
[1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:48.840]  fact that movies can make people do this and the police and no there may be
[1:56:48.840 --> 1:56:52.400]  copycats that's actually not fear-mongering to have some police out
[1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:58.400]  or at least have people on the lookout because you probably will have copycats
[1:56:58.400 --> 1:57:03.680]  of the of the staged event it's called priming the pump now if they try to keep
[1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:07.360]  them out there permanently that was the excuse to take over just like they're
[1:57:07.360 --> 1:57:11.520]  saying TSA to be at movie theaters and shopping malls that news is six years
[1:57:11.520 --> 1:57:15.040]  old they wanted that and now it's happening now they're at the shopping
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:19.560]  malls two years ago the new TSA PSA's show them at shopping malls and football
[1:57:19.560 --> 1:57:27.080]  games our TSA our TSA the globalist TSA is going to England to grope them it's
[1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:34.520]  all happening or you can't go to a movie theater as villains will pop out oh man I
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:40.880]  tell you this is just so sophisticated this is so sophisticated and I've

[1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:47.360]  about them and they announce a real terror attack in Belton and in the next
[1:57:47.360 --> 1:57:50.760]  day say it wasn't real and then nobody gets in trouble for that I mean I have

[2:00:37.800 --> 2:00:42.680]  I said what's your concern here he goes moment I saw this staged how it was the
[2:00:42.680 --> 2:00:45.840]  premiere how it's going to just make them you know basically sell more
[2:00:45.840 --> 2:00:50.200]  tickets how we saw the pre-hype and he said it's only a matter of hours so the
[2:00:50.200 --> 2:00:54.240]  firefighters get into his computers and just like when Richard Poplowski killed
[2:00:54.240 --> 2:00:59.280]  those three cops he was a white supremacist who was constantly attacking
[2:00:59.280 --> 2:01:03.560]  me everywhere that calling for violence against me we later discovered and they
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:08.640]  had the Southern Prairie Law Center ADL local writer within one hour of them
[2:01:08.640 --> 2:01:16.400]  getting his computer come out and say he did it for Alex Jones turned out his
[2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:19.600]  computer at that because I saw the court records had I made them all retract
[2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:23.640]  thousands of websites he'd visited including infowars.com and prison
[2:01:23.640 --> 2:01:30.000]  planet.com I mean my website's bigger than MSNBC and CNBC.com combined I mean
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:35.280]  gee do you think somebody might have visited it so every time nightline every
[2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:40.120]  time anybody's here they say you're gonna cause violence I'm like really really
[2:01:40.120 --> 2:01:43.160]  I need to be shut down because of that I'm gonna talk about after the break let's
[2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:46.260]  just go to your calls right now and I absolutely when they get into those
[2:01:46.260 --> 2:01:54.200]  computers it is a very good chance that I'm gonna be blamed for this and I'm not
[2:01:54.200 --> 2:01:57.360]  looking forward to it it's happened a whole bunch they tried to blame me for
[2:01:57.360 --> 2:02:01.200]  the Giffords stuff until it came out he was a big Democrat we'd like to dress up
[2:02:01.200 --> 2:02:04.560]  as a woman I'm not saying he's bad he liked to do that I mean the point is is
[2:02:04.560 --> 2:02:07.440]  that you know he's a guy who hated Republicans and dressed up as a woman
[2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:12.640]  I'm not responsible for that okay let's go ahead and talk to Robert in
[2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:18.320]  Colorado Robert you're on the air welcome hey thank you Alex I'm a little
[2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:22.200]  big draw here right now if you can bear with me I've been up all night people
[2:02:22.200 --> 2:02:29.320]  calling me all night long I used to be a former a6 driver 27 years ago my new
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:36.520]  Eric Harris's father who's an F4 Phantom driver the Columbine situation I had
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:42.600]  guys that I knew young guys when they were on the SWAT team and they were
[2:02:42.600 --> 2:02:46.120]  already stacked to go in 20 minutes after that shooting and they were told to
[2:02:46.120 --> 2:02:50.880]  stand down all right and they weren't allowed to breach Columbine for five
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:54.360]  hours afterwards no that came out in the news I interviewed the editor of the
[2:02:54.360 --> 2:02:58.360]  Rocky Mountain news it was in the news that the police shot some of the kids
[2:02:58.360 --> 2:03:02.920]  and there were other shooters inside I mean I don't know what police it was
[2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:07.240]  but it wasn't SWAT because I knew I knew two guys were on SWAT to my personal
[2:03:07.240 --> 2:03:10.720]  friends they were they never even fired a shot that day they were already stacked
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:14.920]  they were stacked 10 deep to go in 20 minutes after that thing happened and
[2:03:14.920 --> 2:03:19.300]  they were told to stand down and back off I guess some more people could bleed
[2:03:19.300 --> 2:03:23.600]  to death that way I guess a higher death number for Clinton I don't know but this
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:27.400]  kind of reminded me what went down last night I like I said I've been up for
[2:03:27.400 --> 2:03:32.280]  almost 22 hours I'm a little groggy but like I said I'm a former A6 driver I
[2:03:32.280 --> 2:03:40.000]  know trust me your whole 9-11 some scenarios correct I was in involved in
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:46.840]  the FAA for many years out in Denver yes there I don't know it's not real
[2:03:46.840 --> 2:03:50.600]  there's not really a deep underground base there there there's a terminal
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:55.720]  station that'll take you out to Cheyenne Mountain and out to Buckley that's
[2:03:55.720 --> 2:03:59.680]  basically where they run they there's a lot of rail tracks on the ground the
[2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:03.600]  whole airport's really a physical disaster when you get underneath it I
[2:04:03.600 --> 2:04:09.760]  was involved at TSA and its inception massive criminal corruption from the
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:15.080]  beginning there were guys that one guy was the federal security director who
[2:04:15.080 --> 2:04:18.400]  was a former lieutenant lieutenant colonel he had already he was already
[2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:22.360]  sucking down one retirement check and then he got another one for just being
[2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:26.920]  the FSD federal security director five years and he sucked down and he made
[2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:32.400]  $185,000 a year and sucked down 90% of that pension well I tell you what stay

[2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:05.400]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[2:07:05.400 --> 2:07:09.360]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that
[2:07:09.360 --> 2:07:13.200]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[2:07:13.200 --> 2:07:16.760]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[2:07:16.760 --> 2:07:20.680]  and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from
[2:07:20.680 --> 2:07:25.200]  Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[2:07:25.200 --> 2:07:30.120]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food

[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:58.560]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:02.800]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[2:08:02.800 --> 2:08:07.680]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[2:08:07.680 --> 2:08:15.200]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network okay
[2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:18.680]  we're taking your phone calls and then I'm going to talk about the fact that the
[2:08:18.680 --> 2:08:22.400]  Democratic Party and others that are collaborators with the globalist in the
[2:08:22.400 --> 2:08:27.680]  UN are openly saying they want to restrict our gun rights now and want the
[2:08:27.680 --> 2:08:32.440]  UN treaty signed to restrict our rights to kill opposition they said don't worry
[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:36.400]  it doesn't take your rights don't run where your friends everything's fine
[2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:41.040]  hands up though well now they're just moving forward to want to ban our guns
[2:08:41.040 --> 2:08:46.840]  so here you have it it happened but there are a lot of mainstream articles
[2:08:46.840 --> 2:08:49.520]  saying hey we have a very violent culture we have a lot of violence in the
[2:08:49.520 --> 2:08:54.080]  movies a lot of glorification of it and the studies show that's what's really
[2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:58.840]  causing this yes it's not the guns killing people it's the fact that I would
[2:08:58.840 --> 2:09:02.320]  not want to be a police officer nowadays you know we see a lot of bad cops
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:06.800]  now there's a lot of good ones as well a lot of good ones because I made them and
[2:09:06.800 --> 2:09:10.640]  talk to them but there are a lot of bad ones because the system wants corrupt
[2:09:10.640 --> 2:09:15.000]  people and thugs in there and they've got a bigger pool from this degenerating
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:20.400]  culture it's not just here all over the world the test scores the health the
[2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:26.960]  work ethic the families it's all disintegrating what's upstanding today is
[2:09:26.960 --> 2:09:32.720]  just average 50 years ago I mean people are lazy they're stupid they're not
[2:09:32.720 --> 2:09:36.800]  paying attention and they're downright evil and I'm not talking about
[2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:43.000]  everybody but the percentage of slobs the percentage of people that don't know
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:47.920]  how to do I mean look compared to my dad I don't know how to fix anything
[2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:54.240]  compared to his dad he doesn't know how to fix a lot of stuff I mean it's just
[2:09:54.240 --> 2:09:58.760]  people are getting dependent and we're getting specialized to where we're only
[2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:06.280]  good at certain things it's a very scary scenario that's all I can say and you
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:09.880]  know the TSA they're saying TSA type checkpoints now to be everywhere to
[2:10:09.880 --> 2:10:14.040]  stop mass shootings which statistically Kurt Nemo's got a great article up
[2:10:14.040 --> 2:10:17.880]  there at info wars calm statistically well he's got the numbers you've got a
[2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:27.560]  very much better chance of just rare forms of death than you do from mass
[2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:33.200]  shootings I mean shootings is way down the line most years it's like number 10
[2:10:33.200 --> 2:10:40.360]  11 12 13 it varies year to year in the world almanac and in guys will you pull
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:47.120]  up on causes of death number one cause of or like top causes of unnatural death
[2:10:47.120 --> 2:10:51.640]  and just I mean I forget the exact search it'll pull it up but just watch
[2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:54.880]  just like I know on average there's five great white deaths a year sometimes
[2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:58.600]  there's two sometimes there's seven but on average it's five total shark attacks
[2:10:58.600 --> 2:11:04.440]  it's about a dozen every year sometimes hand big makos elite people
[2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:10.640]  occasionally or big tigers sometimes have a little snack tigers will actually
[2:11:10.640 --> 2:11:15.560]  eat you a great white bite you and almost always let's go a tiger or a
[2:11:15.560 --> 2:11:19.480]  mako will actually take you in have a snack like sometimes they like you're
[2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:23.400]  rotten so they'll take you and cram you under some mangroves wait till you get
[2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:27.040]  a little bit more tasty kind of like a crocodile will do and then come back
[2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:32.960]  later for the delicious snack but some amazing videos on YouTube of guys hand
[2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:37.760]  feeding giant tiger sharks like 14 feet long and they go there every day and
[2:11:37.760 --> 2:11:42.280]  bring tourists it's in the Caribbean I forget where and they hand feed these
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:11:47.240]  giant and they're like dogs that come over and wag your tails gal excited the
[2:11:47.240 --> 2:11:52.280]  guys are sitting there hand feeding them the point is is that I'm digressing and
[2:11:52.280 --> 2:12:00.920]  I guess there is no point that mass shootings are incredibly rare and when
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:06.120]  you have mass shootings that aren't staged they get no attention like there's
[2:12:06.120 --> 2:12:10.320]  actually been mass shootings in Virginia and other areas of police and boy let me
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:13.280]  tell you when somebody goes in a police station and shoots 10 cops and kills four
[2:12:13.280 --> 2:12:18.120]  or five of them like they did in Fairfax County Virginia it didn't get any
[2:12:18.120 --> 2:12:24.680]  attention because that was real and they don't want real again it's you know
[2:12:24.680 --> 2:12:29.160]  when it's staged because of the hype you know by the propaganda and the way it's
[2:12:29.160 --> 2:12:35.600]  pushed and that's the the the coup de gras or the cherry on top that's the
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:44.520]  plastic cherry on top is that it is is the response the timing the UN treaty all
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:49.920]  of it it's fake it's classic the MO is this guy was drugged we know from other
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:53.840]  Manchurian candidates probably didn't even do the shooting has been probably
[2:12:53.840 --> 2:12:57.200]  tortured off and on for months he's disappeared hadn't talked to mommy he's
[2:12:57.200 --> 2:13:01.040]  in this big neurological brain interface PhD program that's classically where
[2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:05.800]  they get him he disappears I'm gonna go to Robert here in just a minute talking
[2:13:05.800 --> 2:13:09.160]  to myself here realize I gotta shut up it's just so incredible I'm trying to
[2:13:09.160 --> 2:13:13.000]  give you all the data points of why I know this is staged I mean it's just
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:19.120]  hundreds of them and 50 most cause 50 most common causes of death yeah but
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:22.960]  that's got natural ones cardiovascular disease that's okay keep going it's fine
[2:13:22.960 --> 2:13:27.160]  infectious disease stroke low respiratory tract infection respiratory
[2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:32.200]  disease AIDS chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tuberculosis malaria
[2:13:32.200 --> 2:13:38.720]  lung cancer diabetes suicide oh yeah especially for the military stomach
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:44.200]  cancer and it just goes on keep going we're gonna find the guns I think guns
[2:13:44.200 --> 2:13:48.400]  are the 10th 11th or 12th depending on the year it varies of unnatural it's
[2:13:48.400 --> 2:13:57.240]  easy these are medical things the the search is causes of unnatural death and
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:14:04.400]  it's gonna be automobile accidents and then it's gonna be hospitals with bad
[2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:09.040]  prescriptions and it's gonna be hospital infections look these up folks this is
[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:13.120]  what I do all day study statistician numbers I want to know real reality
[2:14:13.120 --> 2:14:17.480]  okay let's let's just I'm gonna shut up here we got law in Colorado that might
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:21.120]  be one of the we are change guys I know but let's finish up with Robert Robert
[2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:24.240]  you're you're saying you're formerly in the military you know a lot of the guys
[2:14:24.240 --> 2:14:27.760]  are on the SWAT team at Columbine people just joined us in the last segment you
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:32.000]  were talking about the fact that yeah the whole thing was really spooky but
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:36.840]  but continuing what's your take on what happened there in Colorado last night at
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:41.960]  the premiere of the dark night rises like I said I've been up all night I got a
[2:14:41.960 --> 2:14:46.480]  cousin named Al too and we were talking about this all night and he I'm almost
[2:14:46.480 --> 2:14:53.280]  50 someone old-timer we used to take our boys to that theater a couple years
[2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:57.240]  ago when they were really young still in high school and there was a heavy police
[2:14:57.240 --> 2:15:02.320]  presence always at that theater all right every premiere night through Thursday
[2:15:02.320 --> 2:15:06.480]  Friday Saturday and said there was always a heavy police presence so you
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:11.040]  know we were talking this morning about it said well where were the cops at you
[2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:15.520]  know there were always at least eight Aurora cops and see that yeah this is
[2:15:15.520 --> 2:15:18.840]  one of those mega theaters whenever I go to one of those any night of the week
[2:15:18.840 --> 2:15:22.080]  there's at least two cops but if you go on a premiere night there might be five
[2:15:22.080 --> 2:15:27.400]  or six like you said oh there's always not even that because you know it's
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:30.240]  predominantly let me put it this way it's predominantly in a black
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:34.680]  neighborhood and there's always shootings that go down up there all right
[2:15:34.680 --> 2:15:40.520]  and when I found that when I'm looking at this might wait a minute you know this
[2:15:40.520 --> 2:15:44.720]  couldn't possibly happen the way it said it did and then now I come to find out
[2:15:44.720 --> 2:15:49.440]  the shooter who's a white guy who apparently lives in a predominantly black
[2:15:49.440 --> 2:15:55.400]  apartment complex very close to this and it's booby trapped now what are the odds
[2:15:55.400 --> 2:15:59.600]  of that and he tells the police that that it's booby trapped and then his
[2:15:59.600 --> 2:16:04.600]  mother comes out and says well I knew my son was gonna do that this makes no
[2:16:04.600 --> 2:16:08.840]  sense to me Alex what about him being in a because I've been to these different
[2:16:08.840 --> 2:16:12.680]  university departments at UT and others over 90% of them were funded by
[2:16:12.680 --> 2:16:16.200]  Department of Defense and we're looking into it now preliminary this program he
[2:16:16.200 --> 2:16:22.280]  was part of was an advanced DARPA funded mind interface in fact guys put that
[2:16:22.280 --> 2:16:25.160]  article back up for me it's out of the Associated Press is also on Yahoo
[2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:30.160]  program that's exactly where they recruit the patsies out of I mean I've
[2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:38.440]  seen this before prize me because what I'm saying is the M.O. makeup it doesn't
[2:16:38.440 --> 2:16:43.240]  fit what would be an actual random shooter you know I'm saying why would
[2:16:43.240 --> 2:16:47.000]  I'm a black man some I'm just saying why would a white guy be living in a
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:52.400]  predominantly black apartment complex and then go into a predominantly black
[2:16:52.400 --> 2:16:55.560]  theater and shoot people up maybe this could be what you're saying about you
[2:16:55.560 --> 2:16:58.960]  know the race thing that's coming down here too you know the proof of the
[2:16:58.960 --> 2:17:04.280]  provocative the provocateur for this but I would they start exactly because I
[2:17:04.280 --> 2:17:07.960]  got to tell you I just looked at the Trayvon Martin thing and the Zimmerman
[2:17:07.960 --> 2:17:12.360]  deal open and looked at it and then it turned out they knew his head was
[2:17:12.360 --> 2:17:17.400]  bashed in his nose was broken he went out and said what are you doing and
[2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:21.680]  Martin beat him up had split they mean you know white guys black guys kill
[2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:25.280]  each other whatever the point is this stuff goes on and then they did all
[2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:30.360]  that and then the Justice Department tried to hype it and then MSNBC edited
[2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:34.480]  the tape to say he's a black guy get him when the full tape is like well well
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:38.480]  what color is he well I think he's black I mean the whole thing was a Psyop and
[2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:43.080]  you're right if oh and wow they are saying that this but so you're saying
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:47.000]  you live in the area and I know some of the victims were were black oh my gosh
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:50.440]  if they if they come out with that angle holy mackerel when they get into his
[2:17:50.440 --> 2:17:56.800]  computers because we know oh man it could be that let me let me let me let me
[2:17:56.800 --> 2:18:02.160]  chime on Trayvon Trayvon Martin for a minute I lived in Florida too and we
[2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:07.080]  now was stationed down there and I did not you know it's it's you know you
[2:18:07.080 --> 2:18:11.600]  said you grew up in Dallas which is bad enough but I mean Florida's a really
[2:18:11.600 --> 2:18:16.840]  red-naked racist area to live in and you know I don't know you know him and the
[2:18:16.840 --> 2:18:20.480]  kid got into it my whole point with Trayvon Martin is if you wouldn't have
[2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:24.600]  put yourself in that position you wouldn't have to shoot that kid well
[2:18:24.600 --> 2:18:28.920]  why would you follow that boy well sure my point is we know the government the
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:34.120]  media took it and tried to get a race conflict going that's my point yes
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:37.920]  exactly that's what I'm trying you know what and we've got this this this
[2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:42.240]  programmed media here in town this is FEMA region 8 this is your default

[2:18:55.040 --> 2:18:59.440]  really it's not down the road from Columbine it's about you know you you

[2:25:46.960 --> 2:25:55.440]  humanity they do rule an empire of dirt and that's why they try to hype up evil
[2:25:55.440 --> 2:25:59.280]  and ugliness is so beautiful they're trying to turn our atmosphere politically
[2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:05.440]  spiritually into what they are it is a kingdom of psychopaths and they are
[2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:09.960]  reporting multiple shooters that got corrected they are reporting he went
[2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:13.960]  through a theater door that by the way or hinge to open out have giant metal
[2:26:13.960 --> 2:26:18.920]  hinges you can't they're sunk into the doors there's giant metal around it
[2:26:18.920 --> 2:26:23.920]  it's not like it's going this way it goes this way only it would take a
[2:26:23.920 --> 2:26:30.680]  gorilla to get through that oh but he kicked it in oh really oh really I've
[2:26:30.680 --> 2:26:34.280]  tried to knock down a big door getting sick of it being locked a big wooden door
[2:26:34.280 --> 2:26:39.600]  and we tell you it's hard it's hard you got a couple locks in wood not going
[2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:43.360]  through metal it takes a battering ram
[2:26:46.840 --> 2:26:50.200]  I'm tempted it's so weird I was looking to be in Colorado at this time but didn't
[2:26:50.200 --> 2:26:56.040]  go let's go ahead and talk to law in Colorado is this is this law the we are
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:27:01.360]  changer hello Alex why yes it is my friend how are you I'm good what do you
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:06.080]  make of all this well this is very interesting everything on our end
[2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:11.880]  definitely indicates a false flag type attack I sent some info to your tips to
[2:27:11.880 --> 2:27:17.800]  guys a guy named Bill Warner out of Sarasota Florida reports that the black
[2:27:17.800 --> 2:27:23.280]  the James Holmes the shooter was actually a member of the black block and
[2:27:23.280 --> 2:27:27.280]  whether or not that's the truth or not when I look at the picture of this guy
[2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:32.440]  he looks really familiar and we spent you know good couple months down at
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:36.920]  Denver Occupy basically fighting off the intelligence agencies and trying to
[2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:42.520]  wake everybody up to how they control it and the anarchist black block had taken
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:46.800]  over Occupy immediately I was assaulted by the black block which really is the
[2:27:46.800 --> 2:27:50.640]  federal block in most cases when I was at Denver with you guys they would come
[2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:54.440]  up and slap me in the back and punch me and then laugh about it of course you
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:58.080]  were there when we had him cutting our microphones with knives that was MSNBC
[2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:02.400]  but yeah it's pretty he does look familiar doesn't he yeah this guy
[2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:07.560]  definitely does we you know there's no coincidence these things are happening
[2:28:07.560 --> 2:28:12.120]  we just had Chertoff in town and we hit him pretty hard I think you guys even
[2:28:12.120 --> 2:28:16.200]  put the video up about it and of course Chertoff was talking about all the
[2:28:16.200 --> 2:28:21.520]  terror possibilities in local and you know in the in your local areas and the
[2:28:21.520 --> 2:28:26.400]  Denver Post actually put out a an article here and basically talking about
[2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:33.160]  the terror watch guy here talking speaking that he knew of al-Qaeda activity
[2:28:33.160 --> 2:28:37.080]  here in Aurora and it's certain that al-Qaeda had told its members via
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:41.040]  websites to go to the US buy guns and go into shopping malls churches and
[2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:44.440]  synagogues and starts yeah exactly so they're guessing get ready for the
[2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:49.200]  churches the movie theaters were some of the targets and then magically this guy
[2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:56.440]  who is in an advanced Department of Defense funded program in PhD level for
[2:28:56.440 --> 2:29:02.000]  brain interface neuroscience but but the guy's wearing a mask but now it's him
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:06.680]  we're told and then we're all supposed to believe this right I mean it it's
[2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:12.880]  pretty absurd we could definitely see the patterns of what's going on here we
[2:29:12.880 --> 2:29:17.280]  this the black block these guys are connected to the radical anti-imperialist
[2:29:17.280 --> 2:29:21.000]  movement we've had problems with them in the past the barb and mark they flew
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:25.720]  in the black block in 99 to Seattle on with government aircraft and put them in
[2:29:25.720 --> 2:29:29.800]  a police-controlled area they were publicly working for the feds that's on
[2:29:29.800 --> 2:29:34.200]  record yeah I've had a block on the street when I don't have a camera walk
[2:29:34.200 --> 2:29:37.400]  over and say we're gonna kill you and I go you work for the government they're
[2:29:37.400 --> 2:29:42.520]  like you bet we do and one of our guys was in Chicago during the protests a
[2:29:42.520 --> 2:29:46.920]  couple months ago and he saw the people running the marches up there were the
[2:29:46.920 --> 2:29:52.000]  Denver Black Cron the very people we were doing that amazing we're on the

[2:34:54.800 --> 2:34:59.240]  full wars live the Alex Jones show and then there's the nightly news and then
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:02.840]  there's all the special alerts everything else my book Paul Watson's book a
[2:35:02.840 --> 2:35:06.560]  whole bunch of other documentaries we've been authorized to post there for
[2:35:06.560 --> 2:35:10.280]  filmmakers contact us to one of premier films there it's incredible and
[2:35:10.280 --> 2:35:15.160]  you're supporting the front lines of the info war because I don't care of the
[2:35:15.160 --> 2:35:18.720]  Washington Post comes out and attacks me at the New York Times and I want to say
[2:35:18.720 --> 2:35:22.880]  this before I go back to calls because we need to be prayed for here when
[2:35:22.880 --> 2:35:29.800]  Richard ploskey and Pittsburgh killed three cops and cold blood the former
[2:35:29.800 --> 2:35:33.980]  Marine did they didn't blame the Marine Corps by the way I don't think they
[2:35:33.980 --> 2:35:40.600]  should have they didn't blame no they blame me within one hour of arrest when
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:44.480]  he gave himself up I'll never get this you like kill three people and you're
[2:35:44.480 --> 2:35:48.800]  not going to keep killing it or I mean you know it just sits so weird he kills
[2:35:48.800 --> 2:35:52.800]  three cops because he's drunk he's got two pit bulls his mother says get rid
[2:35:52.800 --> 2:35:58.560]  of him they're defecating and urinating everywhere he's passed out cops will tell
[2:35:58.560 --> 2:36:02.800]  the most dangerous thing is a you know domestic dispute she calls the cops to
[2:36:02.800 --> 2:36:06.960]  throw him out as he bows up to her but she doesn't tell him by the way he's
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:12.880]  waiting with a semi-automatic AK-47 so the three cops come walking up and he
[2:36:12.880 --> 2:36:21.200]  just kills all three of them and then one hour after he's in custody the
[2:36:21.200 --> 2:36:25.320]  computers the first thing they're thinking about is go in there and say
[2:36:25.320 --> 2:36:31.160]  he'd get it for Alex Jones he was a fan of Alex Jones now we were able to get
[2:36:31.160 --> 2:36:34.760]  his handle and find out who he was from his other public postings on a bunch of
[2:36:34.760 --> 2:36:39.280]  other sites where he was attacking me oh he was a white supremacist showing off
[2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:43.360]  his tattoos and stuff whatever reason a lot of the white premises really hate
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:47.120]  us because we don't get in a bunch of race stuff and you know don't make our
[2:36:47.120 --> 2:36:53.480]  religion attacking Israel all day and he was all over the web for years saying
[2:36:53.480 --> 2:37:00.680]  I was the most evil person basically on the planet so I contacted five or six
[2:37:00.680 --> 2:37:03.600]  newspapers and I said I don't want to have to sue you and I'm not litigious
[2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:08.240]  but I'm going to have to you're telling police he killed people for me that's
[2:37:08.240 --> 2:37:15.760]  very dangerous and you have no proof and they all posted retractions and I had
[2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:18.600]  some of the editors call me and I they said what do you want to do and I said
[2:37:18.600 --> 2:37:22.680]  you better do a big one not a little retraction a whole article retracting this
[2:37:22.680 --> 2:37:26.800]  because I'm going to have to sue you that they I don't like getting lawyers
[2:37:26.800 --> 2:37:30.280]  ensuing people but I'm gonna have to come after you have to win because you
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:34.400]  know the guys the white supremacist who basically you know in some cases called
[2:37:34.400 --> 2:37:37.880]  for violence against us that I was gonna get mine and all this stuff and then
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:43.560]  the first thing the people running that police department did when they got in
[2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:47.040]  there was blaming on Alex Jones and they had the local Southern Poverty Law
[2:37:47.040 --> 2:37:51.840]  Center connected guy write an article by that evening saying it was basically
[2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:58.280]  connected to me this has happened a bunch of times when Nightline when MSNBC
[2:37:58.280 --> 2:38:06.400]  when CNN when any of them went when New York magazine Rolling Stone London
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:12.720]  Guardian Associated Press Reuters syndicated radio extra hard copy over
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:19.640]  the years it's always when they sit down CBS News was here a few weeks ago what
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:23.400]  what do they say to me are you worried what you're saying is gonna cause some
[2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:28.480]  violence gee our country being imploded by foreign bankers all of our
[2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:32.400]  liberties under attack I mean you know the founders actually went out and
[2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:36.520]  started you know getting violent I'm not calling for violence in fact I'm I'm an
[2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:42.520]  info warrior trying to use the pen which is minor than the sword history shows
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:47.520]  what's the first amendment and the backups the second so no I'm the opposite
[2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:52.240]  of that and everyone knows it so stop trying to blame me and I had the secret
[2:38:52.240 --> 2:38:55.120]  service show up here a couple times I've had the FBI show up and go do you
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:38:58.680]  support this person on your website calling for the death of this cop and
[2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:04.520]  I'm like no well why did you have moderators remove it I didn't know they
[2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:10.080]  removed it but they remove any calls for violence then I get attacked and I'm
[2:39:10.080 --> 2:39:16.840]  censoring and I said so stop implying I'm involved in violence you know the FBI
[2:39:16.840 --> 2:39:20.520]  killed Terrence Yeakey the cop that was exposing that the fact that the FBI was
[2:39:20.520 --> 2:39:23.560]  involved in Oklahoma City you want to talk about that you want to talk about
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:28.880]  the fact you know don't try to set me up okay because I know how the system works
[2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:31.920]  and don't think you just because you get 90% stage convictions or whatever
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:35.800]  that you know you're gonna get away with this the point is is that we've got the
[2:39:35.800 --> 2:39:38.580]  new world order circling around us let me tell you something they have the
[2:39:38.580 --> 2:39:43.280]  White House transition chief of staff and others publicly running think
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:47.880]  progress funded by George Soros and the Democratic Party I mean these are
[2:39:47.880 --> 2:39:52.360]  people that actually set policy for Obama are calling for our funding to be
[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:56.640]  cut off and for us to be shut down media matters that says they'll infiltrate
[2:39:56.640 --> 2:40:01.440]  our alternative media and and we're listed by them and destroy them from
[2:40:01.440 --> 2:40:06.440]  within I have to worry new people I'm hiring and they're all nice folks but I
[2:40:06.440 --> 2:40:09.720]  have to sit there and look at them and go is this an infiltrator okay that's
[2:40:09.720 --> 2:40:16.080]  the world I live in that who knows what an infiltrator could do plant child
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:24.360]  porn on computers plant drugs plant hacked material on our computers claim
[2:40:24.360 --> 2:40:29.760]  we've got national security information again we could be shut up any time so
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:33.400]  pray for us spread the word but let me tell you when the White House control
[2:40:33.400 --> 2:40:39.400]  groups come out and call for us to be shut down and say drudge has to be dealt
[2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:43.640]  with because he's supporting us as well and oh my gosh drudge is funding them by
[2:40:43.640 --> 2:40:51.880]  linking to him it guess he's funding us today linked to us no it's because we
[2:40:51.880 --> 2:40:55.880]  said watch they're going to come out and blame the Second Amendment and then an
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:40:59.040]  hour later our article was proven right and triple can I mean it's not hard we
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:02.160]  said hey the Sun's gonna come up this morning and we were the first to put it
[2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:07.080]  out so we're the funny you know we're hard-working idiots over there with a
[2:41:07.080 --> 2:41:11.760]  George Soros group that's what's happening here we've got support dozens of
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:15.800]  legs of support you can't just chop one out from under us and as if you're just
[2:41:15.800 --> 2:41:20.160]  gonna threaten drudge and then drudge isn't gonna link to us my gut and I
[2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:22.560]  said there's a fair offer I said I bet I'm gonna get more links now that they're
[2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:27.800]  threatening it but don't you get it we're not here to be pushed around any
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:32.120]  more do you understand that I understand the threat I understand the danger we're
[2:41:32.120 --> 2:41:40.280]  in but who knows who they're gonna blame when this comes out who knows I hope
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:43.240]  they don't blame us they're already blaming the Second Amendment which is
[2:41:43.240 --> 2:41:46.680]  everybody which is your right so they are blaming us they're blaming me they're
[2:41:46.680 --> 2:41:50.520]  blaming you they're blaming everybody they're saying our guns that keep us
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:54.880]  safe I feel really good that some of my crew here has concealed carry who
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:41:58.360]  statistically are the most law-abiding people out there and have been trained
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:02.880]  at everything I feel so good knowing there's some eaters floating around in
[2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:06.960]  here because if somebody's really crazy and wants to do something there's
[2:42:06.960 --> 2:42:09.880]  nothing you're gonna do to stop them unless you've got a gun that's your only
[2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:16.280]  hope I feel really good knowing that I feel really good that I know how to use
[2:42:16.280 --> 2:42:23.640]  a gun and I mean I know how to use them good I know how to relax if I need to
[2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:28.800]  and hit the target it's a great part about the gun you don't have to get all
[2:42:28.800 --> 2:42:32.840]  you don't have to get old Ben Grimm or you know the Hulk doubt crazy to stomp
[2:42:32.840 --> 2:42:35.480]  somebody like you do when you know some big guys coming down on you got a
[2:42:35.480 --> 2:42:40.000]  little get mad and do it with a gun it's just all real calm you got to defend
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:44.920]  yourself it's just easy as pie and that is such a satisfying feeling and they
[2:42:44.920 --> 2:42:50.120]  want to take that satisfying feeling away it's satisfying to have an instant
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:55.400]  access pistol safe in every bedroom my house and to have one right up by the
[2:42:55.400 --> 2:43:00.480]  front door or I can just reach right over and hit the code and in a second
[2:43:00.480 --> 2:43:05.560]  have my firearm right there ready to defend my family they want to take that
[2:43:05.560 --> 2:43:08.600]  away they want to make me a slave like there aren't all these other countries
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:11.760]  and they're attacking all of us right now with this when they get into his
[2:43:11.760 --> 2:43:15.840]  apartment that is guaranteed some little cache of setups this whole thing
[2:43:15.840 --> 2:43:20.520]  stinks it's gonna be bad and I don't know who they're gonna blame but I got a
[2:43:20.520 --> 2:43:24.400]  good idea and perhaps talking about it'll make them think they can't get
[2:43:24.400 --> 2:43:29.040]  away with it but I've been through this repeatedly within one hour of three dead
[2:43:29.040 --> 2:43:35.960]  cops they're blaming me came out in court all it was what we found publicly
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:39.400]  and got the retractions with before it came out in court it was all get Alex
[2:43:39.400 --> 2:43:43.440]  Jones and violence is the answer Alex Jones is wrong oh yeah that's what he
[2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:48.360]  said on our site violence is the answer Alex Jones is wrong and Alex Jones is
[2:43:48.360 --> 2:43:53.600]  gonna get his and then I get the blame I get the blame because I'm saying don't
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:58.320]  go out and kill cops and then I get the blame no I don't deserve the blame and
[2:43:58.320 --> 2:44:03.120]  I'm not taking it and the second amendment it and taking it either let's go
[2:44:03.120 --> 2:44:07.640]  ahead and talk to James in California why am I the first target folks because
[2:44:07.640 --> 2:44:11.200]  they're scared of us that's why James in California thanks for holding her on
[2:44:11.200 --> 2:44:15.720]  the air go ahead hey Alex it's a pleasure to be able to speak with you
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:20.000]  finally my name is James Martinez I am the protege and former work colleague of
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:25.480]  Walter boward who wrote the book operation mind control and before his
[2:44:25.480 --> 2:44:29.920]  death I kind of took over all his work but I wanted I wanted to say to you and
[2:44:29.920 --> 2:44:37.040]  commend you for touching the dirtiest ugliest truth is actually going on and
[2:44:37.040 --> 2:44:41.880]  that is the harvesting and manufacturing of children for use for operations all
[2:44:41.880 --> 2:44:46.040]  over the world you're precisely right I mean I know you're not the world's
[2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:52.360]  expert on this I don't think anybody is but it is going on it is real and that
[2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:58.560]  particular kind of center point there that's happening is why we're in the
[2:44:58.560 --> 2:45:03.040]  position that we're in because it is that there's a book that was written by a
[2:45:03.040 --> 2:45:07.480]  Ralph Metzner it's called that the roots of war and domination
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:13.000]  psychiatrist and I've interviewed him and I know him quite well but it really
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:17.560]  actually goes into the pathology of the people at the very top that harvest
[2:45:17.560 --> 2:45:21.880]  these children and do this stuff that no no that's what CIA mind control was all
[2:45:21.880 --> 2:45:28.000]  about was people that like to abuse children got congressional funding to do
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:33.760]  it under national security and it's it's a guild there's lots of status and
[2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:37.960]  control freaks and just mercenaries that make up different cadres but as you get
[2:45:37.960 --> 2:45:42.280]  higher up the pyramid the only people that want to betray countries and be
[2:45:42.280 --> 2:45:47.080]  evil is they are these demon creatures and they might as well be demons who
[2:45:47.080 --> 2:45:51.800]  like hurting children and everywhere everywhere you find the new world order
[2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:56.640]  you find the abuse of innocent children it is it is just so hellish
[2:45:56.640 --> 2:46:01.280]  you're dead on so congrats for you probably the courage to bring that up
[2:46:01.280 --> 2:46:04.400]  well sir it's not the courage it's survival instinct I mean I've we've
[2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:08.280]  got to face the whole truth and make preparation for it and and you know
[2:46:08.280 --> 2:46:12.080]  that's all this comes down to is that I have committed to go all the way and
[2:46:12.080 --> 2:46:16.400]  it's the only way I mean people think you go along with this you to survive no
[2:46:16.400 --> 2:46:22.680]  you don't I mean sir pediatric cancer is up over 10,000 percent if you look at
[2:46:22.680 --> 2:46:26.760]  major studies many cancers in an adults two thousand three thousand percent
[2:46:26.760 --> 2:46:31.720]  diabetes several thousand percent type two they're killing us sir we're already
[2:46:31.720 --> 2:46:35.760]  dead we're I mean I'm not gonna I mean if there's no hope but to beat them I
[2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:39.400]  bless you and I appreciate your call we're taking calls again on the shooting
[2:46:39.400 --> 2:46:46.080]  mainly Jim and Nevada you're on the air go ahead hello Alex go ahead sir
[2:46:46.080 --> 2:46:52.080]  welcome dude man this whole thing is really tragic man I have kids I have
[2:46:52.080 --> 2:46:56.400]  family I imagine myself being in the movie theater watching a movie and this
[2:46:56.400 --> 2:47:01.840]  happened to me and my family and very scary situation well that's it I'm gonna
[2:47:01.840 --> 2:47:07.520]  start carrying I'm gonna start carrying a little I've got a bunch of small
[2:47:07.520 --> 2:47:11.560]  handguns I mean with the crime increasing and everything everybody just
[2:47:11.560 --> 2:47:17.480]  got to start packing I'm sorry go ahead I know this is my Yahoo news I don't know
[2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:21.640]  you didn't really mention this yet but you know how you guys were saying that
[2:47:21.640 --> 2:47:27.760]  but at one caller that was a 50-year-old guy that was ex-military or
[2:47:27.760 --> 2:47:30.760]  whatever he was saying that it's within like four miles or whatever of the
[2:47:30.760 --> 2:47:37.400]  Air Force Base well Yahoo news is reporting that some of the people that
[2:47:37.400 --> 2:47:42.840]  were shot inside the movie theater were US military members then they released
[2:47:42.840 --> 2:47:48.680]  on the press conference they said that 71 people were victims a lot of
[2:47:48.680 --> 2:47:53.560]  victims and I was thinking if some of them were US military members and this
[2:47:53.560 --> 2:47:59.320]  new gun treaty things coming up maybe some things like this these kinds of
[2:47:59.320 --> 2:48:04.400]  attacks will make other US military members think well why not confiscate
[2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:07.200]  guns because look at what's happening to our own our own military
[2:48:07.200 --> 2:48:10.920]  members there been military has been targeted all over the US by a weirdo
[2:48:10.920 --> 2:48:14.200]  shooters the government knows fully about their protecting quote Muslim
[2:48:14.200 --> 2:48:18.000]  extremists thank you good point yeah no no they're reporting multiple
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:22.760]  shooters it was reported on the local news and we've confirmed this but we're
[2:48:22.760 --> 2:48:26.760]  gonna dig it out and like do an article on it here's an email from Greg I was
[2:48:26.760 --> 2:48:30.240]  watching the Colorado news feeds all morning yes over we did an interview
[2:48:30.240 --> 2:48:34.080]  with a guy who was in theater nine and he stated that someone during the

[2:54:34.800 --> 2:54:41.160]  what all the signs say you're dumber in the box of rocks gunman kills 12 in
[2:54:41.160 --> 2:54:47.440]  Denver shooting at Batman movie this is Reuters it's up to 14 now he looked like
[2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:51.760]  he was in the military or like he was a SWAT person so he just kind of blended
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:55.480]  in with the chaos of the crowd people thought he was probably like a cop or
[2:54:55.480 --> 2:55:00.040]  something witness Jennifer Seeger old NBC's today that's what a bunch of other
[2:55:00.040 --> 2:55:04.080]  witnesses say and people thought it was part of the movie they kept sitting there
[2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:07.520]  because they're in suspended disbelief it's their movie nothing's gonna wreck
[2:55:07.520 --> 2:55:11.320]  it even the bullet going into their baby's head
[2:55:12.240 --> 2:55:17.800]  there are going to be other days for politics I think in this day for prayer
[2:55:17.800 --> 2:55:20.600]  and reflection while he has his surrogates out demonizing the Second
[2:55:20.600 --> 2:55:24.200]  Amendment Obama told supporters that a previously scheduled campaign event in
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:28.160]  Fort Myers Florida but you cut short to address the shooting oh just like Bush
[2:55:28.160 --> 2:55:34.080]  on 9-11 with the pet goat you know them by the script the scripting is the
[2:55:34.080 --> 2:55:39.560]  evidence you believe that they've got a few votes they need to get that treaty
[2:55:39.560 --> 2:55:46.280]  that Obama says he's gonna sign and this happens right before and it happens
[2:55:46.280 --> 2:55:51.600]  right in the same quadrant of the secret government area of Denver they're
[2:55:51.600 --> 2:55:58.600]  Columbine if you think all that happened on accident ladies and gentlemen you are
[2:55:58.600 --> 2:56:05.840]  insane this is a big deal folks this is a big deal let's go to Neil in North
[2:56:05.840 --> 2:56:12.600]  Carolina you're on the air Neil oh pretty good it looks bad though I tell
[2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:15.360]  you it looks this looks like some of those stage Russian shootings they've
[2:56:15.360 --> 2:56:20.360]  done to get a police state looks like that same kind of model I got you I got
[2:56:20.360 --> 2:56:26.660]  a couple things I know I got a short period of time first off I'm active duty
[2:56:26.660 --> 2:56:32.440]  military and I'm currently stationed in North Carolina and you got a lot of
[2:56:32.440 --> 2:56:42.280]  supporters out here man I ordered the paint stencil and 125 bumper stickers
[2:56:42.280 --> 2:56:47.640]  and 400 cards and they've been getting passed out like candy on Halloween man

[2:56:51.920 --> 2:56:55.600]  listeners very effective to wake people up what what's your take on this
[2:56:55.600 --> 2:57:01.760]  shooting I was I'm actually originally from Colorado I was in Colorado when
[2:57:01.760 --> 2:57:06.760]  Columbine happened and I don't know like like everyone's been saying it's
[2:57:06.760 --> 2:57:15.480]  pretty convenient timing it's yeah I don't know it always happens right before a
[2:57:15.480 --> 2:57:22.520]  key gun control bill always exactly hmm I mean this is really obvious
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:30.200]  two more things Alex actually sent some pictures of my truck I painted my truck
[2:57:30.200 --> 2:57:34.040]  all up with info wars.com like I said I've been handing that stuff out what

[2:58:01.960 --> 2:58:05.040]  people are getting into it and are they telling you later it's waking them up

[2:58:22.600 --> 2:58:27.440]  bottom line this tragedy is is is going to be used to take our liberties and it's
[2:58:27.440 --> 2:58:31.200]  a cultural mind control that causes people to get into this type of violence
[2:58:31.200 --> 2:58:34.760]  even mainline psychologists are saying that so the words getting out I'll be
