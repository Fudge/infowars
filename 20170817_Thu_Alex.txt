[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:23.000]  It's 8.17.17.
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.000]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's already Thursday, the 17th day of August.
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  2017, we're going to be live here for the next four hours as we are every weekday.
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.000]  Central Standard Time coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.000]  I am in Seattle, Washington.
[00:40.000 --> 00:46.000]  In studio in Austin, Texas, we have Gary Haven, entrepreneur, billionaire,
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  creator of Curves, private pilot, investigative journalist, filmmaker, you name it.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  We also have Olin Shroyer writing Shotgun today, and then we have a full slate.
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  We have Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign in studio today,
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  coming up in the third and fourth hour.
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  We have Pastor Rodney Howard, who's part of the religious council that goes and prays with Trump,
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  who first reported a month ago the plan in Congress where they are telling Congress,
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  get behind us, we're going to kill him,
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  and we're going to basically kill anybody else that doesn't get in line with the military coup.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  Well, the military is not on the side of the globalist,
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  but they're selling the hoax that Trump is going down.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  So that's all coming up.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  They're also selling a hoax that I said,
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  Starlet'sville never happened, or it was all actors, or the Jews did it.
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.000]  I never said that.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  I talked about leftist groups, black leftist groups, Jewish leftist groups.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  All have been caught doing false flags.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  All have been caught posing as Nazis.
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  At other events to get the race garbage going.
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.000]  And coming up, I'm going to show a whole bunch of mainstream news articles confirming all of that,
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  because it's not about defending myself.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  It's about showing how mainstream media lies.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  They say, I said Jews were actors and did Starlet'sville, and it was fake.
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  Never said that.
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  I said 18 years ago, I'd been at events, and out of many groups I saw of leftist out there.
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  Sometimes I saw folks that were later connected to the ADL,
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  Southern Primary Law Center, and others, and that's been in the news.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  Just this year, they caught Jewish organizations and Jewish individuals that were leftist,
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  staging attacks on Jews in Israel and in the U.S. to blame the right wing,
[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  to blame Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  That's Jerusalem Post.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  The major Jewish publications, leftist groups, had to apologize to President Trump earlier this year
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  when the Jewish sinners were getting attacked, the bomb threats, the gravestones getting overturned.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  His first speech to Congress, he had to say, oh, I'm really concerned about this,
[02:43.000 --> 02:50.000]  because they'd said he was behind it, and then it turned out it was fake as Trump had said he thought it was.
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.000]  So there is some real Nazis out there, but the media is hyping it up and driving it to create a societal collapse.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  Look at the headlines we've got out today on some of the live streams.
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  Here they are.
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.000]  Trump to step down.
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  It's not true, but the media is basically beating the drum towards that direction.
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.000]  Fake news.
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  So there's two can fight at that game, put out a headline like that with a question mark.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  It's not fake, but it basically goes in the line of the mainstream media and then discredit the line.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.000]  Here's another one.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  A stock market to crash.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  Well, the stock markets weigh up, but if the globalists have their way, the stock market is going to crash.
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  But here's the real headline that we put out today.
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  MSM pushes plan to kill President Trump.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  And that was, of course, the former deputy head of the CIA and former deputy head of the FBI,
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  Phil Mudd, last week on CNN saying there is a plan to kill him and we're going to kill him, they said.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  Wow, the arrogance.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  Just like CNN USA Today, once allies, CEO abandoned Trump.
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.000]  And then they say, hear that three people died in the riots in Charlottesville, which it was actually one.
[04:01.000 --> 04:07.000]  The mysterious helicopter situation, though, they don't want to debate that, but they just insert their fake news.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  Let me translate for you this news headline right here from USA Today.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  Trump disbands counsel as CEOs continue to flee.
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  And then they go on to cheerlead.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  They hope the collapse of the economy.
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.000]  He's having to disband these councils because they're targeting all the CEOs and threatening them to go after them.
[04:26.000 --> 04:36.000]  The globalists are if they don't disband and then getting them to one by one resign to make President Trump look weak and then hurt the economy.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  So there's Trump working around the clock to resuscitate with defibrillators our economy.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  He's got us back from the dead thanks to your exuberance and action listeners.
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.000]  And now they're just desperately trying to crash the economy as fast as they can.
[04:50.000 --> 05:16.000]  We'll be back with Gary Haven, Owen Schreuer and more.
[05:16.000 --> 05:24.000]  It's available at mforwardstore.com.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  I want to get your reviews on what you have to say.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  For me, it's been a crow.
[05:29.000 --> 05:35.000]  Mycozx, antifungal, antifungus, anti yeast, get it today, limited around.
[05:35.000 --> 05:36.000]  It'll be months until we get more.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  mforwardstore.com, forwardslife.com, our triple A, two, five, three, one, three, nine.
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  I can't support an organization that didn't fight harder.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  Look at the response we're getting.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  We were changed the world together.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  You are the Info War.
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000]  God bless you all.
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.000]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste
[05:57.000 --> 05:59.000]  is now back in stock at mforwardstore.com.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.000]  Research across the board is clear.
[06:01.000 --> 06:04.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream
[06:04.000 --> 06:06.000]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[06:06.000 --> 06:10.000]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[06:14.000 --> 06:17.000]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[06:17.000 --> 06:21.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[06:21.000 --> 06:25.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times
[06:25.000 --> 06:28.000]  to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  due to requests from lifters who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong
[06:40.000 --> 06:41.000]  for some of their children.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  We've created the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint-free.
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  and more at infowarslife.com
[06:49.000 --> 06:53.000]  and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  Number one, when you choose auto-ship before checkout,
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  when you sign up for auto-ship because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  Just go to infowarshore.com, select your favorite product or products.
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  Click on auto-ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win,
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  and with the new auto-ship feature at infowarshore.com, this is a sure win.
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  10% off on auto-ship.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  Win, win, win at infowarshore.com.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[07:50.000 --> 08:09.000]  All out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live, worldwide transmission.
[08:14.000 --> 08:22.000]  It is 81717 on this Thursday transmission, and we have got quite a global transmission for you.
[08:22.000 --> 08:33.000]  We have in studio in Austin, Texas, billionaire, patriot, researcher, filmmaker, Gary Haven, pilot,
[08:33.000 --> 08:40.000]  investigative journalist with our team, Joe Biggs, and Michael Zimmerman helped expose the child kidnapping rings in Haiti
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.000]  that were later six months confirmed in Associated Press Report.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  Flew in there just one day after the hurricane.
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  He's going to be riding a shotgun for the next three, four hours.
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  We have Owen Schreuer, of course, co-hosting with us as well with breaking news and analysis.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  There's been another car run over some people in Barcelona, Spain.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  We hope that's a jihadi event, and our prayers go out to...
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  We hope it's not a jihadi event. We hope that that's not...
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  I mean, we hope nobody's been hurt, period, but obviously we will learn more as this unfolds.
[09:08.000 --> 09:17.000]  We're going to get several people from the president's Evangelical Prayer Council on today.
[09:17.000 --> 09:24.000]  One of them is Romero Pena, who's friends with Gary Haven to get into what Trump's really like behind the scenes,
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.000]  his true relationship with Christ, some pretty amazing testimony that you're going to get exclusively here.
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  And this just happened this way. This was already set up a week ago.
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, who was in Congress a month ago,
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  and they told him there's a plan to physically kill the president.
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  First, they said physically remove him, but now he's talked to him again.
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  They said, no, kill him. He's been visited by the Secret Service again,
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.000]  but the Secret Service hasn't visited Phil Mudd, former Deputy Director of the CIA
[09:54.000 --> 10:02.000]  and former Director of the FBI, Deputy Director, saying last week the deep state is getting ready to kill Trump.
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.000]  So that's really the big news here. They're trying to make Trump stand down.
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  They're trying to make Trump back off. They're trying to make Trump basically step down, threatening his family.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  You name it, we have that inside intel.
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  So I have the headline out there today, Trump to step down,
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  only if you're hoaxed into submitting to it, or only if he can be broken, which I don't see happening,
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  as long as our prayers and action continue.
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  We also, again, have them trying to push the stock market crash,
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  trying to bully all these CEOs into not bringing jobs back,
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  because that'll kill globalism if the American recovery actually happens.
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  So this is an amazing time to be alive, but we do have mainstream media
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  openly announcing and pushing plans to kill the president just to make everybody think, hey, he's done.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  If they're on TV saying his whole economic council just collapsed,
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  and if they're on TV saying they're going to kill him, he must be on his way out.
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  This is mind control by a very weak, evil, twisted, out-of-control group.
[10:59.000 --> 11:06.000]  So I'm going to walk through key intel on this in this hour that I'm going to turn it over,
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  even though wild horses can't drag me away.
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  I'm listening every minute to not the second string, but the real new first string of people like Owen Schreuer
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.000]  and David Knight getting back to town today, and of course, Gary Haven coming in and so many others,
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  because it's the great minds out there like them, and you, the listeners and viewers,
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  are going to help us turn this around.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  So tell us some of your observations, some of your views, and some of what's coming up,
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  Gary Haven and Owen Schreuer back in the ATX.
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  Hey, Alex, good to see you.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  I got to tell you, you're not very good at taking a vacation.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  I want you to jump in yesterday, but I'm glad you're here.
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  We're living in a very interesting time right now.
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  I want to talk today about the process that we've gone through for these Antifa,
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  for the people that want chaos, and what they've accomplished, because it's astounding.
[11:56.000 --> 12:02.000]  And we need to warn your listeners and the American people, the ones that still are capable of thought,
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  on how to respond to this thing.
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  And so I'm looking forward to talking to Matt today with some great guests with you and, of course, with Owen.
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.000]  Alex, one thing that I'm noticing, and that's kind of been on my radar, is the line that's being drawn in the media right now,
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  where it's becoming more clear and present every day.
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  Who's real? Who's genuine? Who wants to get down to the truth? Who wants to report the truth?
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  Who wants to know what's actually going on?
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  And who's just going to repeat talking points? Who's just going to virtue signal?
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  Who's going to literally lie on camera? Who's just going to read a teleprompter?
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  The line has been clearly drawn to me now, especially after what happened in Charlottesville,
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  people saying, Trump never condemned, Trump never condemned.
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.000]  Okay, you're fake news. It's gotten really easy.
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.000]  That's right. And it's biblical, even if you don't believe in the Bible or history or God.
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  When things get down to the line, good and evil become very, very clear.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  The demarcations become extremely clear.
[13:02.000 --> 13:08.000]  And, you know, it's one of the other big points I was going to get to that's in my notes that Gary just separately just brought up,
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  is I have so many clips.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  I don't even know if we have time to get to these, but I'm going to try after the half hour mark.
[13:14.000 --> 13:21.000]  We have MSNBC promotes anti-for-violence and says it's good attack people go out and attack Trump supporters.
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  So, again, first they label you alt-right, then they have a little Nazi rally and attach them to people,
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  then they attach it to Trump, then they attach it to everybody else and dehumanize us. That's a Nazi tactic.
[13:32.000 --> 13:39.000]  And then CNN, promoting this fascist anti-fab, George Soros funded a group.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  We don't just say George Soros does George Soros that.
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  That's who's been funding anti-fab since I first covered them here in Seattle in 1999.
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  So we're going to be getting to how they're promoting violence and how they're setting the stage for real civil war in America
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  because they can't win and they're going around to all the reporters and all the Fox News people.
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  And I mean, I got these calls months ago, people said, well, say who? Well, you know, it's off the record calls.
[14:03.000 --> 14:10.000]  And there's a thin veil of the threat, but it's, they're going to take Trump down.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  And if you don't step aside during it, they're going to take you down.
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  You need to be in this for a long haul, Alex, and be a survivor and be smart.
[14:16.000 --> 14:22.000]  You need to turn Trump loose. Look, you've done a lot. You probably got him elected. People really respect you.
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  But this is the right thing to do, Alex. And so if you don't want something to happen to you and your family,
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  and you know, things can go a lot better for you in your life, you already see what we can do to you.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  So don't make us, well, you want to live, don't you?
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  And that's basically word for word. I've got about five of those calls from high-level folks.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  Oh, by the way, Alex, we can make it even easier for you.
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.000]  So we can either give you a carpet of gold or a carpet of death.
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  You know what? I choose honor. I choose George Washington. I choose ramming speed.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  I choose total commitment, and I've never been so alive.
[14:54.000 --> 15:01.000]  So yes, my wife, some of my children may be on vacation right now, but I am not on vacation.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  I'm working 18 hours a day. I woke up in the middle of the night last night wanting to work because things are so serious.
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.000]  I'm going to skip this network break, the only one today, so that we have time now to get into the main body of what I'm about to cover.
[15:13.000 --> 15:21.000]  We are at a historic crossroads, and the men are being separated from the people that want to serve the establishment.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  And if you think giving into these bullies now is going to advance you and your family, you're crazy.
[15:26.000 --> 15:34.000]  Just having Trump in for seven months has turned the economy back on and has panicked the globalist and has put fear into the social engineers.
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.000]  And the damage we've done to them will last a lifetime. There's no reversing our huge gains.
[15:40.000 --> 15:50.000]  So don't let them ever demoralize you, but they've gone to the next level of deception, the next level of fake news.
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  And so the first thing I want to cover right now is a giant hoax.
[15:55.000 --> 16:05.000]  It's the hoax that Jews staged the Charlottesville crisis and that I said actors carried it out.
[16:05.000 --> 16:10.000]  That is a total incomplete hoax, that is a total incomplete line.
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  And I've covered this the last few days, but I saw a video clip from my friend Joe Rogan, who I've known 19 years,
[16:15.000 --> 16:22.000]  who will say anytime they call me a racist, that he's never heard me say anything racist and he knows I'm not.
[16:22.000 --> 16:32.000]  But Joe's a smart guy, but he went off ABC, NBC, CBS, the headlines saying Alex Jones says Jewish actors carried out Charlottesville.
[16:32.000 --> 16:42.000]  Never said anything like that. I spent an hour covering black people, white people, Hispanics, Jewish people, all leftist, all over the world,
[16:42.000 --> 16:50.000]  dressing up like Nazis, staging events, death-threading Jewish centers, calling in bomb threats,
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.000]  knocking over Jewish headstones and cemeteries, doing things like this.
[16:56.000 --> 17:07.000]  And I covered real events and were Texas Monthly covered that there had been the FBI setting up fake KKK groups and getting them to go out and carry stuff.
[17:07.000 --> 17:16.000]  The Southern Parvy Law Center set up the southern area of the United States, all sorts of white supremacist groups like Elohim City that was involved in Oklahoma City bombing.
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.000]  So provocaturing is something that's known.
[17:20.000 --> 17:27.000]  Okay, and Joe properly points out, you know, the government wanted to stage terror attacks of Operation Northwoods to get us into war with Cuba and the Soviet Union.
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  So anything is possible.
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.000]  So he kind of uses a rebuke of me as a way to get real issues out.
[17:33.000 --> 17:42.000]  But what Joe's doing, and I sent him a message this morning, I hope to talk to him today, is he's being hoaxed by mainstream news of the headline,
[17:42.000 --> 17:51.000]  Jones Says Actors Did Charlotteville, because even if you read the text of what I said, edited together deceptively, I said 18 years ago,
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  I'd gone out and protested KKK and Aryan Nations groups.
[17:55.000 --> 18:05.000]  And later it did come out that there were Southern Parvy Law Center and leftist groups and some folks from Jewish groups that had infiltrated those and were basically part of those.
[18:05.000 --> 18:12.000]  And using the promotion of that as a way to get people to believe that the white supremacist threat is much bigger than it is.
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  So the Southern Parvy Law Center and ADL could get more funding.
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  Now that's a real paradigm, something real that's been happening.
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  But what they do is they misrepresent.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  I believe Charlottesville happened.
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  But notice how they put you on the defensive.
[18:26.000 --> 18:27.000]  They're the liars.
[18:27.000 --> 18:28.000]  They're the fake news.
[18:28.000 --> 18:37.000]  Then your friends pick it up, meaning well, buy into the hoax, because who would write in Newsweek that Alex Jones says Jewish Actors stayed Charlottesville?
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.000]  I mean, who would ever?
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  It must be true, right?
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  It'd be like if they said the president died or the president was going to step down.
[18:43.000 --> 18:44.000]  It must be true.
[18:44.000 --> 18:45.000]  Or the stock market's going to crash.
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.000]  It must be true.
[18:46.000 --> 18:47.000]  Or Iraq has WMDs.
[18:47.000 --> 18:48.000]  It must be true.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  Or Saddam Hussein's bashing little baby's brains out in incubators.
[18:51.000 --> 18:52.000]  It must be true.
[18:52.000 --> 18:53.000]  You saw a little girl testify.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  That wasn't true.
[18:55.000 --> 19:04.000]  So, but I don't blame Joe because he very nicely covers it and says, you know, Alex, I can't believe he thinks this, but you know, it's basically crazy.
[19:04.000 --> 19:20.000]  No, what's crazy is the media took what I said in a long form discussion, just like they could take what I just said in the last five minutes and edit it to where I'm saying that Easter bunnies or possums carried out the attacks in Charlottesville.
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.000]  Now, were the feds involved, provocaturing the leadership, ordering a stand down?
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.000]  Has that come out?
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  Yes, we have articles and video on infowars.com.
[19:28.000 --> 19:29.000]  Was there manipulation?
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  Are they using the antifa, funded to come in violent, to escalate things?
[19:33.000 --> 19:34.000]  That's admitted.
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  Let's kill their mics for a moment.
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  So, so we're walking through all of this.
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  We're going over all of this.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  And this is what I really said.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  Not what the Austin American Statesman said.
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  Not what the New York Times said.
[19:48.000 --> 19:55.000]  But notice they all followed the group funded by George Soros, mainly, and the Democratic Party and Podesta.
[19:55.000 --> 20:03.000]  And that's media matters run by David Brock that has admitted Democratic Party propaganda arm that's been given hundreds of millions of dollars to put out this info.
[20:03.000 --> 20:11.000]  So they put out the talking point of edited talking points, but at least admit I was saying 18 years ago, some Jews dressed up as Nazis.
[20:11.000 --> 20:19.000]  And then they project that onto something modern and new. And so instead of getting mad at fake news, we just adopt it.
[20:19.000 --> 20:23.000]  And then I respond and say, I'm not racist to their fake announcements.
[20:23.000 --> 20:34.000]  When I was a few days ago showing Reuters Associated Press and other publications with Jewish individuals who were leftist caught staging attacks on Jews to blame Trump.
[20:34.000 --> 20:44.000]  Remember the headline Trump says false flag being carried out by leftist Jews. And then it turned out he was right. And Trump was given an apology, not by those publications, but by American Jewish organizations.
[20:44.000 --> 20:52.000]  So this is leftist terrorizing Jews to keep them under control funded by a Nazi collaborator, George Soros.
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  He's the Nazi. He collaborated with the Nazis. He wants to overthrow Israel, not me.
[20:57.000 --> 21:05.000]  We're going to go back to our guest host in a moment, but let's play the Joe Rogan piece right now and I'll come back and go over a few more of the points.
[21:05.000 --> 21:12.000]  I mean, the need for everything to be conspiracy is a real problem. It's a real problem for a lot of people.
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  The need to know that they're right about things is a real problem.
[21:16.000 --> 21:30.000]  You know, the not admitting that you don't really know part is a problem because until you until I'm absolutely certain that what you're saying, like, I have to know when I'm talking to you.
[21:30.000 --> 21:41.000]  If you say I'm absolutely 100% positive that if I like this paper on fire, it'll burn 100%. If this is regular paper, I have a regular fire, I'm 100% positive.
[21:41.000 --> 21:48.000]  I have to hear you say, I have to know that that's how you really are operating.
[21:48.000 --> 21:59.000]  So if you're telling me it's 100% that Kennedy's driver shot him, dude, it's 100%. You watch the video, it's 100% Kennedy's driver shot him, or any kind of crazy conspiracy like that.
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  As soon as you say you know for sure, it's like, God damn, man.
[22:02.000 --> 22:03.000]  It's a huge weakness.
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  You know for sure that it wasn't a plane that hit the Pentagon. You know for sure? How do you know for sure?
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  Right. I agree with you completely.
[22:10.000 --> 22:11.000]  You know for sure.
[22:11.000 --> 22:17.000]  And if everyone agrees, like, I always get freaked out when, like, everybody agrees on everything. I feel like I'm going to cult.
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  Yeah, it gets super culting.
[22:19.000 --> 22:20.000]  Yeah.
[22:20.000 --> 22:26.000]  On both sides, as being a skeptical person, like, there's a lot of people that are skeptics that they'll look at things even like Operation Northwood.
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  So they'll be like, well, that's just, it did no big deal.
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  Like, they were planning on killing Americans.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  They were going to arm Cuban friendlies and have them attack Guantanamo Bay.
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  They were trying to get us to go to war with Cuba, and they were going to manipulate us.
[22:39.000 --> 22:44.000]  They were going to blow up a drone jetliner and blame it on Cuba so we'd be outraged.
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  We want to go over and kick Cuba's ass.
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  Who knows? Countless thousands of American lives, for sure.
[22:50.000 --> 22:57.000]  Because, you know, you're talking about 1961 or two or whatever it was when Kennedy vetoed the ****.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  They're signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They were really going to do this.
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.000]  Like, anybody who doesn't look at that and get disturbed, this is from the Freedom of Information Act.
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.000]  That's not a conspiracy.
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.000]  The problem with the really wacky conspiracies like, you know, Kennedy's driver shot him or, you know,
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  that goes deep as you want.
[23:13.000 --> 23:17.000]  The really wacky ones distract from the real ones.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  They mask it. It makes it so nothing means anything.
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  You know, like, Alex Jones was saying something **** crazy today.
[23:23.000 --> 23:28.000]  Like, there's Jewish actors pretending to be Nazis in Charlottesville.
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  Like, these guys had tattoos of swastikas on their chest.
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  That's not a ****. It's not a Jewish person because you're not supposed to get tattooed.
[23:36.000 --> 23:37.000]  Right, exactly.
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  It's not a **** actor.
[23:38.000 --> 23:42.000]  Once you tattoo a swastik on your chest, that you're not acting anymore, right?
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  You've committed to a team.
[23:43.000 --> 23:44.000]  Jesus Christ.
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  Like, that's like one of the biggest steps I can possibly think of as a human being.
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  Yeah.
[23:49.000 --> 23:55.000]  Is to go to a tattoo parlor and be like, give me the **** craziest one.
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.000]  So, the social engineers have a problem.
[23:58.000 --> 24:05.000]  This year, they caught leftist Jewish individuals staging attacks, staging attacks on Jewish
[24:05.000 --> 24:13.000]  centers, on cemeteries, hundreds and hundreds of death threats, attacks on dormitories, poop
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.000]  swastikas.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  It's been rough.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  At first, they said that Trump was behind it all.
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  He even responded to it in his first address to Congress.
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  And it turned out Trump was right.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  It was coming from leftist trying to frame him.
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.000]  So, we know there's a lot of government groups, ADL, Southern Primary Law Center, FBI that
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  infiltrate and wind up that is provocateur real Nazi groups.
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  But I believe Charlottesville happened.
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.000]  I believe Nazi groups are real in many cases and I've decried them.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  But the media has a problem.
[24:43.000 --> 24:49.000]  MSM has been so discredited with the babies and incubators in Iraq and the WMDs and Operation
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  Northwoods and the rest of it.
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  They've got to engage in deeper fake news.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  So, what they've said in the last four days is that I said Charlottesville didn't happen.
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.000]  It was all actors.
[24:59.000 --> 25:00.000]  I'm going to watch out.
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  They'll edit that together and put that out as quotes.
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.000]  Seriously, that's how bad they are.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  They're saying, basically, I said Charlottesville didn't happen.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  It was all Jewish actors.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  I did not say that.
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000]  There have been many cases of folks of every religious background group that are leftist,
[25:13.000 --> 25:18.000]  including Jews, that have been caught infiltrating and even running white supremacist groups
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  and KKK groups and provocaturing them.
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  That's just the fact, Breitbart's probably written 200 articles on it the last couple
[25:24.000 --> 25:25.000]  of years.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  We've written countless articles, Texas Monthly, The New York Times.
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  But my good friend, Joe Rogan, I don't blame him.
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  He got hoaxed into it because it was in ABC News, NBC News, Newsweek.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  Alex Jones says that it was actors in Charlottesville posing as Nazis and Charlottesville basically
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.000]  didn't happen.
[25:41.000 --> 25:42.000]  I didn't say that.
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  You actually read what the Southern Poverty Law Center and what the ADL and what the folks
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.000]  over at Media Matters, funded by George Soros said, is they actually said, Jones said 20
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  years ago and 18 years ago, he would go out and see folks and they took it out of context.
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.000]  I said, didn't even, quote, look like an Aryan, look like, you know, Seinfeld or something,
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.000]  dressed up as Nazis.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  And then it would come out later than indeed it was leftist posing.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  So that's what was said.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  And people know that I don't support George Soros.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  That's a Nazi collaborator that funds Media Matters and these very groups that try to
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  imply I'm somehow a Nazi.
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  But that's why they've got to call everybody a Nazi but themselves because that's who they
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.000]  are.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  And then they hope that even smart people like Joe Rogan, one of the smartest guys I know,
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  is busy, got family, got a busy life, got an incredibly popular show.
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.000]  And he just sees headlines that I'm saying Charlottesville was all actors.
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  And then for the rest of my life, I'll be hearing you said Charlottesville didn't exist
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  because media lied about it.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  That's the media's problem.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  My listeners know the truth.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  They understand what's really going on.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  And they're aware of the facts.
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.000]  But if you want to look at Southern Barbery Law Center and other groups actually running
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  Elohim City that carried out the Oklahoma City bombing attack, that's been in major
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.000]  newspapers.
[26:58.000 --> 26:59.000]  That's come out in lawsuits.
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.000]  That's in Freedom Information Act request from then Deputy Attorney General at the time,
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.000]  Eric Holder.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  I mean, this is the truth.
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  Most of these events are provocative, wound up mentally ill people they're using to do
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  it.
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.000]  But something like Operation Northwoods, that is a purely synthetic event where they were
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  going to completely stage the terror attacks to bring us to war.
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  But as Joe said, that got vetoed.
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  But I've had media say, I'm a conspiracy theorist about that.
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.000]  The reality is you can't deny that we've got the CNN and MSNBC clips we're going to play
[27:34.000 --> 27:42.000]  today that are up on infowars.com where they are openly talking about how they need more
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.000]  violence against Trump supporters and period because we've got to be intimidated and bullied
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  into submission.
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  So first, Hillary calls us the alt-right.
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.000]  She defines reality.
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.000]  Then she brings in, you know, through the provocative groups, all these other organizations with
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  the antifa to come in and attack everybody.
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  It blows up and then they claim it's our fault.
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  This is how they're trying to undermine our open and free society.
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.000]  It's a fact.
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  They're calling for the president to be killed on CNN.
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.000]  Why is that not bigger news when the former deputy director of the CIA, Phil Mudd, calls
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  for his death?
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  And high-level members of Congress are saying they're shopping the idea of killing the president.
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  That's the atmosphere we're in right now.
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.000]  That's the countercoup by the globalists trying to take back the free and open election we
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.000]  had, federalize the elections, have new elections, and have the Democratic Party be made the single
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  one party of the future.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  They have announced this in their main publications.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  This is really happening.
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.000]  But instead of saying I'm right, strawmen are created of things I've never said, editing
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  together what I've said to deceive people.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  I'm not the person they've strawmanned.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  I'm the person who I am that you watch and you listen.
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.000]  And I'm honored to be here at the center of the debate because I'm hitting the barbed
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  wire every day because it's the right thing to do to expose these globalists.
[29:05.000 --> 29:11.000]  Gary Haven in studio in Austin, Texas, Owen Troyer, I want to get your break down, man.
[29:11.000 --> 29:15.000]  Well, I'm not surprised the media is gaslighting Trump all day long and they're gaslighting
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.000]  you all day long.
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.000]  They want to poke you, they want to intimidate you, they want to try to stop you from covering
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  real news, just like they want to stop Trump from his agenda.
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  Yeah, when we get back from the break, I want to show some of the evidence that there are
[29:29.000 --> 29:33.000]  actors that are participating in this event.
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  So, part of what they claimed you said is actually factual.
[30:03.000 --> 30:14.000]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  to this formula for over 10 years.
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  It's available at informerstore.com.
[30:18.000 --> 30:19.000]  We also have free shipping.
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  Order $50 or more and 10% off.
[30:21.000 --> 30:24.000]  You sign up for auto-ship additionally on top of that.
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  Please, we only have a limited supply of this.
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  I want to get your reviews on what you have to say.
[30:29.000 --> 30:56.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.000]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[30:58.000 --> 31:01.000]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:01.000 --> 31:07.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:07.000 --> 31:12.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[31:12.000 --> 31:16.000]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[31:16.000 --> 31:20.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family,
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[31:24.000 --> 31:29.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:29.000 --> 31:32.000]  or avoid most toxic effects to themselves.
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  The general public doesn't.
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[31:44.000 --> 31:48.000]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:48.000 --> 31:55.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at M4warStore.com
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.000]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[32:22.000 --> 32:25.000]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[32:25.000 --> 32:31.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[32:31.000 --> 32:38.000]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view,
[32:44.000 --> 32:46.000]  to any optimum health regimen.

[32:54.000 --> 33:14.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.000 --> 33:24.000]  You know what's amazing?
[33:24.000 --> 33:35.000]  MSM is actually pushing the hoax that Jews, hosing as actors, staged the Charlottesville attack
[33:35.000 --> 33:41.000]  that killed one lady, two officers, state troopers died in a mysterious helicopter accident,
[33:41.000 --> 33:45.000]  and they're acting like it's the end of the world, the end of our economy, the end of Trump,
[33:45.000 --> 33:50.000]  the end of everything, like five billion people died.
[33:50.000 --> 33:56.000]  Like America is now Hitler, because a bunch of anti-fascum were marched in to be violent,
[33:56.000 --> 34:04.000]  and a bunch of globalists managing and manipulating adjaprop-confused white nationalists clashed.
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  The leftists attacked them.
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.000]  That's not endorsing the white nationalists to say the leftists attacked them.
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  It's endorsing reality and simply reporting on it.
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  And then President Trump comes out and covers it properly and talks about how it's being used for division
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  and says, come together, and they say, once allies, CEOs abandon Trump.
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  They say it's the end of the economy.
[34:26.000 --> 34:32.000]  Everyone's turning against him, and they have no proof, no one to quote, no facts in USA Today.
[34:32.000 --> 34:33.000]  More fake news.
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  Might as well say Trump was assassinated.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  Might as well say Trump is going to step down tomorrow.
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  Might as well say the Easter Bunny's real.
[34:39.000 --> 34:40.000]  But I'll tell you what's real.
[34:40.000 --> 34:46.000]  They're trying to crash our stock market because they know it's economic results of the free market
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  that trump their globalism, pun intended.
[34:50.000 --> 34:58.000]  And they know that mainstream media is openly promoting and normalizing the idea of a violent, bloody coup
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.000]  against President Trump and his supporters.
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  We are in wild, wild territory right now.
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  Incredible territory.
[35:07.000 --> 35:14.000]  Now, we're going back to Gary Haven and, of course, Owen Schreuer in a moment to talk about this.
[35:14.000 --> 35:20.000]  But first off, a lot of people say, man, Alex, what's it like to have Newsweek run the hoax headline
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  that you say Jewish actors stayed Charlottesville?
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  What's that like?
[35:23.000 --> 35:28.000]  Well, it's like when I said Hillary's responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of people,
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  including children, and she personally is responsible.
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  They edited that together with other comments to say that I said she killed people under a pizza place.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  It's not my fault Fox News edited that together.
[35:38.000 --> 35:39.000]  It's not my fault.
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  That's their fault.
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.000]  They're scum.
[35:41.000 --> 35:42.000]  That's why they're fake news.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  Just like that was Megan Kelly.
[35:44.000 --> 35:51.000]  Just like they're saying that Trump never repudiated on Saturday, never repudiated on Sunday,
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  never repudiated it on Tuesday.
[35:54.000 --> 36:00.000]  He repudiated it perfectly, beautifully with love and unity and truth and exposing the whole thing.
[36:00.000 --> 36:04.000]  And they just keep saying he never repudiated it, just like he repudiated David Duke in the 90s.
[36:04.000 --> 36:13.000]  And in the 2000s, and in 2014, and in 2015, and in 2016, and finally in 2016, he repudiated him so many times.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  One day, it was on a weekend, they said repudiate him.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  He didn't repudiate.
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  And they went, oh my God, you didn't show up repudiated.
[36:19.000 --> 36:20.000]  You must support him.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  So they repudiated it dozens of more times.
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  One time, three, four times in one press conference.
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  And a couple minutes after he repudiated it, they said, you never repudiated.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.000]  They said, you're crazy.
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  You're fake news.
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.000]  First time he said that, I just repudiated it again.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  But see, they're editing it.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  They're taking the live press conference and editing it to keep asking the question, why won't you repudiate?
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.000]  Why won't you repudiate?
[36:41.000 --> 36:49.000]  And at a certain point, I'm watching a Nazi collaborator like George Soros, a literal Nazi collaborator who's overthrown over 100 countries,
[36:49.000 --> 36:56.000]  funded the Arab Spring, funded radical Islam to take over, scourged to Muslims, Christians, Jews, you name it,
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  literally declared an enemy of the state of Israel, literally.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  That's Reuters, declared an enemy of the state in Eastern Europe.
[37:03.000 --> 37:08.000]  And groups he funds edit stuff together, but I'll give it to Media Matters.
[37:08.000 --> 37:14.000]  And David Rock, at least they took my real quotes and kind of cut them down where I said, I've been to KKK events.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  I protested and to Aryan Nations events.
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  I protested.
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.000]  Those videos are public online and said, you're big, fat, federal agents, you know, look at you.
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  You're Hispanic.
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  What are you doing in a KKK outfit?
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  Look at you.
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  You don't look like, you know, you're, you're people say, well, what's a Jew look like?
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  Well, they can look like, you know, anybody.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  There's black Jews, white Jews, Asian Jews, whatever anybody can convert.
[37:34.000 --> 37:40.000]  But a classic, you know, Ashkenazi, Russian Jew features, you know, like you have it in encyclopedia.
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  You know, people have features.
[37:41.000 --> 37:46.000]  It's okay to point out people's features, you know, like some Scandinavians are six and a half feet tall.
[37:46.000 --> 37:55.000]  The point is, is it came out that they were indeed leftist from the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups in those Nazi groups that I protested.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  It turned out specifically I was right.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  We've been showing news articles the whole time, but they don't show you the news articles.
[38:02.000 --> 38:08.000]  They edit together two, three words here, four, five words there, put them together and then put that out.
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  But I don't care.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  It doesn't hurt me.
[38:11.000 --> 38:24.000]  I on purpose said all that Sunday, knowing they would do that, knowing it would be all over the newspapers so that then the listeners would end up hearing the truth about the leftist that are staging events.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  But they didn't fully stage Charlottesville.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  They came in and provocateur it.
[38:28.000 --> 38:38.000]  They do have these crisis actors, which they hire for these drills, which then get hired as well on to be leaders of the Antifa.
[38:38.000 --> 38:46.000]  My second police state film shows them being trained on the news as actors, as roleplayers, so it's not illegal.
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  They tell them, oh, we're training you to be actors for a zombie scene.
[38:50.000 --> 38:56.000]  Or we're training you to be actors for a riot scene, a movie, wink, wink, because it's illegal to do that otherwise.
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.000]  And then they go out and they attack Seattle and make the good protesters look bad.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  I have it all on video in a two-hour film.
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  It's free.
[39:04.000 --> 39:16.000]  The amount of evidence we have, and there's Mexicans and Germans and Jewish groups and Chinese people, everybody that are leftists going and posing and being part of this destabilization.
[39:16.000 --> 39:25.000]  But the media takes the one part about leftist Jews being caught staging events, which is Reuters, which is Washington Post, which is Associated Press.
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  And they misrepresent what I said to say it was Charlottesville to then cause the crisis.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  The truth is, one of the organizers does have connections to the FBI and CIA.
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  So does the mayor.
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  And I've had former high-level CIA on Dr. Steve Pachining.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  Blowing the whistle, he can't give you classified info.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  But he basically said they are from his sources.
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.000]  Just like he's given us intel on air before that ends up coming out later.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  He can't give us the classified stuff.
[39:51.000 --> 39:59.000]  He's got all the connections, but he can give you a basic approximation because he used to run regime change teams, overthrow governments himself.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  And people go, well, then he must be bad.
[40:01.000 --> 40:09.000]  No, he's working for America to expose it right now and telling you they're trying to implode the economy to stop Trump and to stop you.
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  The stakes have never been higher.
[40:10.000 --> 40:16.000]  Now, Gary Haber is going to be hosting the rest of the transmission. I'm just coming on to get all this covered here today.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  I've got them left doing fake crying.
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  I've got them calling for violence. I've got it all.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  But before we go to Gary and Owen Shroyer, we're chomping at the bet right now.
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  We have some of the biggest, no, these are the biggest sales you've ever had.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  They're going to have to end Sunday.
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  I said for the rest of the month, but we're going to have some new specials because we're selling out a bunch of stuff.
[40:34.000 --> 40:41.000]  I could bring back some of last month's John Oliver specials, making fun of him, him demonizing us.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  But a lot of that stuff came back in.
[40:43.000 --> 40:48.000]  So I brought those specials back along with the 1776 specials combined.
[40:48.000 --> 40:54.000]  That's called the Buzzfeed specials where they tested our products, found out they were the cleanest, best, lowest priced out there.
[40:54.000 --> 41:00.000]  It was just incredible how their actual report blew up in their face in ways they couldn't even understand.
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.000]  So to celebrate how the enemy's attacks are turned against them by the good Lord,
[41:04.000 --> 41:09.000]  we have brain force, our amazing Neutropic, 1776, 55% off.
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.000]  We have X2, the good halogen, 1776, 55% off.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  Oil of oregano, 1776.
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  Biotrusillinium, 1776.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  66% off on colloidal silver.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  That's going to have to stop very soon.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  That is about to sell out at $9.95.
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.000]  We have the amazing bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  The bee pollen.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  And the concentrated chicken bones, bone broth concentrated.
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.000]  Just amazing what it does for stamina, energy, bones, collagen.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  It really is the super food that's been sold out for months and months.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  That's back in stock and strawberry and chocolate flavor.

[42:13.000 --> 42:17.000]  But we are tirelessly, fearlessly in the face of the enemy.
[42:17.000 --> 42:22.000]  And we have so much coming up today with the pastor that was told their plan to kill Trump by Congress.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  He got visited by the Secret Service.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  In fact, they confirmed, no, it's physical.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  They're planning to kill him.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  Pastor, he's going to be joining us.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  Rodney Howard Brown.
[42:32.000 --> 42:46.000]  And also, we're going to have the senior pastor of Trump's prayer group also join us as friends with Gary Haven to talk about the inside scoop in real private meetings that he's going to just tell you now.
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  We know he has the authorization to do this, but it's happening about Trump's real relationship with Christ.
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  Powerful information.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  This is a fight between good and evil.
[42:53.000 --> 42:59.000]  Gary Haven, again, author, filmmaker, researcher, rescue pilot, you name it, with Owen Schreuer.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  You've heard the breakdown.
[43:01.000 --> 43:02.000]  You've seen the layout here.
[43:02.000 --> 43:03.000]  You said, going to break.
[43:03.000 --> 43:11.000]  Hey, Alex, it's true you didn't say Jewish actor staged Charlottesville, but we do have crisis actors clearly confirmed.
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.000]  Now we've done videos on this from other events around the country confirmed as actors.
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  They're part of the event.
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  So Gary Haven, let's talk about that.
[43:20.000 --> 43:21.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[43:21.000 --> 43:34.000]  We need to really kind of break this down so that the American people can see the truth because you're certainly not getting that from the emotional and frenzied media that's out there.
[43:34.000 --> 43:40.000]  There's a lot of evidence that this was designed, that this chaos was designed.
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.000]  And I tell you what, it's been amazingly effective.
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.000]  I've been astounded as I've watched this unfold.
[43:47.000 --> 43:52.000]  But we know that there were crisis actors involved in this thing.
[43:52.000 --> 43:57.000]  In zero hedge, for example, here's an article today.
[43:57.000 --> 44:15.000]  Now the discovery of Craig list ad posted last Monday, almost a full week before the Charlottesville protests is raising new questions over whether paid protesters were sourced by Los Angeles based public relations firm specializing in innovative events to serve as agitators and counter protests.
[44:15.000 --> 44:18.000]  And your listeners can go to the website of this company.
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  It's called crowdsomedemand.com.
[44:21.000 --> 44:28.000]  And they're going to find that they were hiring people paying them $25 an hour to agitate.
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  And so here's the evidence.
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  And this isn't unusual.
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.000]  This is usually available between all of you guys.
[44:36.000 --> 44:37.000]  Click on talent.
[44:37.000 --> 44:38.000]  Click on talent.
[44:38.000 --> 44:39.000]  You can see photos of these people.
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  And then our reporters days ago, I know I saw this money when I left.
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  Well, we're actually syncing up photos.
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  Millie Weaver and Gavin had already shown this to me.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  Gavin Wentz were showing people from other events with the actors.
[44:51.000 --> 44:52.000]  It's them.
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.000]  They're there.
[44:53.000 --> 44:54.000]  Yes.
[44:54.000 --> 45:01.000]  So now you're part about actors, which I think they took and they stretched into this old information that was inaccurate.
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  Well, the part about the actors is valid.
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.000]  Nothing is important.
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.000]  It helps us to understand that there are people who are actually planning these events.
[45:10.000 --> 45:19.000]  There were about a thousand protesters and only about a hundred were white supremacists and the other hundred were the Antifa and the Black Lives Matter.
[45:19.000 --> 45:27.000]  So a couple hundred people, many of whom were paid actors, had a script to play that has led into this thing.
[45:27.000 --> 45:37.000]  And if you look at Trump's words that he said when he first condemned it, which really began as firestorm, you know, this is pretty lame.
[45:37.000 --> 45:41.000]  We condemn the firestorm over this is pretty late.
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  I think his words are very, very accurate.
[45:43.000 --> 45:50.000]  We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.
[45:50.000 --> 46:03.000]  And the term on many sides is what the left or what the people that are motivated to benefit from this chaos they've created have hung onto.
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  It's amazing.
[46:05.000 --> 46:12.000]  You watch the late night news and the people that are attacking Trump over those words.
[46:12.000 --> 46:18.000]  You have a really good friend who's a former state delegate in Virginia.
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  Now, I spent some time with him on the phone last night.
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  He's a never-trumper.
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.000]  And he's articulate, bright, and I listened to his side of the argument.
[46:27.000 --> 46:36.000]  And it's amazing the emotion that people are having over Trump's statement and the fact that he said on many sides.
[46:36.000 --> 46:45.000]  And, you know, when people start feeling they stop thinking and across the spectrum, you have just absolute frenzy going on right now.
[46:45.000 --> 46:52.000]  So what is the goal here, they, and the goal is, is that you create order out of chaos.
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.000]  You acquire power by creating chaos.
[46:55.000 --> 47:03.000]  And I'm afraid that this movement to create these events, you know, that summer of rage was kind of late in coming.
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  Boy, they have hit home run now.
[47:05.000 --> 47:08.000]  We are in for some real problems in this country.
[47:08.000 --> 47:24.000]  And so it's so important, Alex, that people like you and me are able to talk some reasoning into what's happened here so that the majority of American people who don't want violence, who stand against racism.
[47:24.000 --> 47:29.000]  You know, and as a Christian, you know, I'm commanded to love people and to tell the truth.
[47:29.000 --> 47:39.000]  And when you look at the violence that's being perpetrated and the myth and the attacks on the president and anybody who defends the president, and that's another thing they've accomplished.
[47:39.000 --> 47:49.000]  They've been able to take, you know, the term white supremacist and convert it to white nationalist and then, inclusively, anybody that's a Trump supporter becomes a white supremacist.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  Anybody that wants to build control.
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  That's what this is. Not only were there actors there, and then that's what I said is they ship in a bunch of actors.
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  They do this at every event. I've been there. I've covered it from Seattle to Austin.
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  There it is in the news. There it is mainstream media. There they are advertising.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  There's the photos of the actors. And I go, it's crazy.
[48:07.000 --> 48:18.000]  Sometimes there's even people that are clearly Jewish and it comes out there Jewish later, 18 years ago, at the events in the Southern Prairie Law Center, running Elohim City, the big white supremacist compound in Oklahoma.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  And again, they then distort that. But think about this. We know it's synthetic.
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.000]  Are there some real white supremacists there? Are there some real, you know, anti-father? Absolutely.
[48:27.000 --> 48:36.000]  But the orchestration, the police stand down and the media hype, like this is the end of the world and it's just so incredible.
[48:36.000 --> 48:46.000]  And America is so racist and America is so bad when gays are being thrown off buildings every day in the Middle East and women are slaves by the, you know, 500 million of them.
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  That's okay. But oh my gosh, Trump said many sides. You had anti-fum.
[48:51.000 --> 49:00.000]  Show up beating people with clubs and throwing balloons full of feces at people and talking about trying to inject folks with HIV blood.
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  And they're basically devil worshipers. Have you ever gone to an anti-faith event?
[49:04.000 --> 49:10.000]  They got devil tattoos. They're screaming they love Satan. They're just running around, literally saying, Hail Satan.
[49:10.000 --> 49:18.000]  They have like, like green skin. They never get out in the sun. These are soulless evil minions with a few actors controlling them.
[49:18.000 --> 49:25.000]  And they're bullying everyone on CNN and MSNBC saying we're allowed to be violent. We're going to hit you in the head with a bike lock.
[49:25.000 --> 49:28.000]  It's good because you're a Nazi. And that's the alchemy.
[49:28.000 --> 49:34.000]  First you get a few Nazis. Then you call them white nationalists. Then you connect them to anybody that's a Trump supporter.
[49:34.000 --> 49:42.000]  And then by extension, Michael Moore and Po Talk of Southern Poverty Slime Center go on MSNBC and say, quote,
[49:42.000 --> 49:49.000]  He's a white supremacist. He supports Nazis when they're the ones funded by an admitted Nazi collaborator.
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.000]  And Arnold Schwarzenegger gave $100,000 to some nebulous group we've ever heard of. Probably not even true.
[49:55.000 --> 50:03.000]  Because of the hate when his dad was a Nazi, he said he loved Hitler, a rolling stone, and the guys an anti-American pig.
[50:03.000 --> 50:11.000]  But it doesn't matter. The Southern Poverty Law Center gives him awards when he wears SS officer belt buckles on TV shows just six months ago.
[50:11.000 --> 50:18.000]  He reportedly, people I know that know him, wears Nazi uniforms on holidays, SS uniforms in his house.
[50:18.000 --> 50:24.000]  And that's even been in the news. Literal Nazis are okay, but we fight Nazis, so we're bad.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  We'll be right back with Gary Haven. We'll get Owen Shroyer's take on this.
[50:27.000 --> 50:34.000]  But I'm going to introduce Pastor coming up here, Rodney Howard Brown, because here's the big news.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  They got you going with all this faux outrage, all this made up stuff.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  They're getting ready on the news saying we're going to kill the president. We're moving to killing.
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  We're CIA. We're FBI. Why are they doing that?
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  They want to normalize it when they blow his head off that it was completely normal.
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.000]  And they want to normalize it to their head teams that they must really be powerful if they can stay it in public.
[50:53.000 --> 51:00.000]  You want to save money in a place that gives you growth, control and certainty without stock market risk or tax risk,
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.000]  and you want guarantees and you want it all tax-free. That's a tall order.
[51:04.000 --> 51:09.000]  But you can get all of that with properly designed participating whole life insurance.
[51:09.000 --> 51:12.000]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead. That's true.
[51:12.000 --> 51:17.000]  But you can have tax-free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.

[53:53.000 --> 54:17.000]  You know, this is just astounding. I want to go to Alan Schroyer and Gary Haven are about to take over the full transmission today.
[54:17.000 --> 54:30.000]  Because I get so much knowledge, I'm not bragging, it's actually like torture, that I remember the Christus actor companies in New York, in DC, in LA, in Seattle, in Minnesota, it's got a big one.
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  And then I've seen the same people around the country that have physically attacked me and others for over a decade.
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.000]  And these are all washed up wannabe actors who also happen to be communists.
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  And then they know you're not supposed to say you're a communist, so they call themselves Antifa.
[54:43.000 --> 54:52.000]  They're openly funded by George Soros. They're on CNN, MSNBC saying we're going to be violent. CNN says yes, go out, attack any Trump supporter.
[54:52.000 --> 54:59.000]  They want civil war. And then there are websites advertising, hey, we have Christus actors ready to go.
[54:59.000 --> 55:06.000]  And I just mentioned this on Sunday and mentioned a smattering of examples from over the years. And the media just misrepresented it.
[55:06.000 --> 55:14.000]  But then I totally missed the point of going in, Millie Weaver and Gavin too, they had all this stuff on Sunday, we're going to post it.
[55:14.000 --> 55:20.000]  Maybe they did, but it's like we already know this, so we just kind of just say it to everybody.
[55:20.000 --> 55:32.000]  Even though we have the total bombshell proven that it's a billionaire CEO, cool cat, you know, rescue pilot, I'm not kissing his butt, he's an amazing guy, coming in and going, hey, let's settle down, here's the Christus actors.
[55:32.000 --> 55:39.000]  Alex, hold on, Alex, you're actually right. Let's see, they just had the Jewish part in there to try to discredit us.
[55:39.000 --> 55:50.000]  So, so, Owen Schreuer, Gary Haven, this segment and the next for the pastor joins us. How huge is this? We need to make a big deal out of this that they did bring actors.
[55:50.000 --> 55:59.000]  Which again, I just go with my spirit, my gut, I just tell the truth, and then don't worry about it, then the enemies on attacks always turn against them because now they've attacked so big saying I'm lying about actors,
[55:59.000 --> 56:04.000]  but then they're admitting they had actors. This is another victory, Gary Haven.
[56:04.000 --> 56:11.000]  Well, Alex, I think there's plenty of evidence here that they've brought in actors and that they continue to do that on all these events.
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  You know, the design here is to create chaos.
[56:15.000 --> 56:31.000]  And right now, you know, yeah, 100 neo-Nazi white supremacists and 100 Antifa, and this story now is dominated the media all week. It's put the president in a horrible position.
[56:31.000 --> 56:40.000]  You know, I thought one of the most astounding things I've ever seen was the press event that Donald Trump held the other day for infrastructure.
[56:40.000 --> 56:49.000]  We're going to show a clip of that in a moment. Here's the sitting president in the United States and a group of reporters having a verbal battle.
[56:49.000 --> 56:55.000]  I can't remember my entire life ever that disrespect, that level of disrespect.
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.000]  And Trump went on the attack and it was extraordinary to watch.
[57:00.000 --> 57:10.000]  We'll play the next segment because we're about to go to break, but let me raise this then. Again, even zero hedges, a headline isn't strong enough and ours isn't.
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.000]  Why was this group hiring $25 an hour people a few weeks ago for the event?
[57:15.000 --> 57:27.000]  They say we will send anti-protesters to cause crises. They were using the words, we need to go back to that website we showed, where they said basically we will stir up an event.
[57:27.000 --> 57:35.000]  We will cause a crisis. I forget the exact word they were using. They admit to going and basically causing the riot right there.
[57:35.000 --> 57:42.000]  And again, as patriots, we all just know this, so we don't even make a big deal out of this, Gary. Owen?
[57:42.000 --> 57:50.000]  Well, let's remember too that you had Project Veritas release videos, Aaron Black admitting that he caused violence at the Chicago Trump rally.
[57:50.000 --> 58:02.000]  You have Bob Kramer saying he talks to Hillary Clinton about street agitation. You had Scott Fovall talking about he looks for mentally ill people on the street to go out and do these things.
[58:02.000 --> 58:08.000]  So the amazing thing to me about all this coverage saying that you're insane for insinuating there's actors, well, how is that insane?
[58:08.000 --> 58:14.000]  That's been going on for years. This is a tactic as old as Nazis. I mean, Hitler burned his own eyes.
[58:14.000 --> 58:23.000]  Really, I agree. And here's what's crazy. You guys showed the one spot on their site earlier. I want to find that again, where it actually says we'll go agitate, we'll stir it up, we'll destabilize.
[58:23.000 --> 58:44.000]  It actually says we'll send in our actors for Agaprop. Oh, it was to agitate. They actually stay in there. I mean, this is sensational.
[58:54.000 --> 59:03.000]  And since then, people are beating down our doors wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue. Research across the board is clear. In fact, it's certified.
[59:03.000 --> 59:08.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[59:08.000 --> 59:15.000]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[59:15.000 --> 59:23.000]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[59:23.000 --> 59:29.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[59:29.000 --> 59:36.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver and more.
[59:36.000 --> 59:46.000]  Learn more about InfoWarsLife Super Blue toothpaste at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[59:46.000 --> 59:51.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  Gary's right if they've gotten people in a hysterical mindset and then the thinking process shifts off at most people.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  I've been hooked up to an EKG before just as the test of mine goes up when I get agitated. I'm kind of a weird duck also.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  I get really focused when I'm very calm. Like I was driving three or four hours yesterday or more just to go to Mount Rainier and I didn't talk very much the whole time I was driving.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  Well, the family was talking but I get in this agitated state when my brain speeds up because it's just what Gary Haven was saying.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  You've got the president going four trillion stock market, four hundred billion new jobs, million and a half new jobs and they're just going, you'll never get it through.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  We're going to fail. If you do the tax cuts and healthcare appeal, you'll never make it.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  And it's like a 20 minute press conference and they're frothing.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  Like he's a convicted child murderer and the parents are in the court and the bailiffs happen to stop them.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  I mean, because you have frothing cowardly nobody media hired by foreign globalist that have failed and have lost and are doubling down with fake news and have hit the president with everything they've got and nothing's working.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  And they want to bully his supporters and they want to bully other, you know, never Trumpers to feel like they're part of the winning team and see we're right.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  Trump's bad. These are losers. These are followers. These are cowards.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  These are people that go along with CNN saying we're going to kill Trump soon with CIA former deputy directors on.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  You people are idiots. You're not part of the power structure. You're going to cry out to Christ.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  If Trump ends up getting killed later when the globalists come down on us and God judges us.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  This was the reprieve. You were given everything, economy, control of the border, sovereignty, decency, love, all of it flooding back in because Trump said we're bringing Christ back in.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  We're bringing God back in. We asked for the Providence. We're going to release the secret technologies and the globalists are screaming, going, no, no, no, they want to steal that birthright of America.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  And now if you can get all the rhinos and neocons and fake liberals to buy into the con game, buy into the system and be the schmucks, then we're going to have this reprieve taken.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  Gary Haven, Owen Schroer, I think there's no doubt of this.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  Well, what I don't understand is since when is the left beyond reproach? How come all of a sudden you have the right getting blamed for neo-Nazis, Nazis, KKK.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  And the left's allowed to beat people up and kill the president because they set themselves up.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  For months. They're doing this for months, Alex. Antifa's been brutalizing things. I mean, look at the women's march. Look at the Black Lives Matter march in Dallas.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  Well, yeah, years. Okay. That's true, too. CNN, when cops get killed, say, well, cops are bad. They deserve to die.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  But you've seen them say, you know, well, more cops are going to die because you're bad people.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  And most police departments are rolling over. I mean, let me tell you, they haven't put a dent in Trump yet, but you're right. Haven's right.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  This is getting subtraction because of weak-mindedness from literal, Soros-funded cop-killing groups.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  Yeah, you know, they use, if you speak up and tell the truth, then they use ridicule. Then they try to twist your words. They lie by omission.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  They have a real strategy here. You know, Alex, I think we haven't mentioned this yet. It's important. This young woman that died, it is a tragedy.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  You know, I thought her mother who spoke and gave the eulogy was an amazing woman. I don't know if you saw that or not, but really an honorable woman.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  She's amazing. We're waiting yesterday, yes.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  Yeah. So, you know, but you can't let that terrible tragedy keep you from being able to speak truth about what happened here.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  And the media has been very successful at holding that up and saying that you can't talk about Antifa.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  And that's where the violence started, by the way. Antifa attacked the people. And Millie, with her great report, by the way, demonstrated that.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  And saying that is racist now, saying that is evil, saying reality is evil.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Yep, we have to be able to talk about it. We can't be shouted down or ridiculed or whatever, particularly right now because they are really mounting a successful challenge to Trump's presidency over a few words that he chose.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  It's just amazing to me.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  Well, I think it's amazing that, to get back to what I was saying, that the right, quote unquote, the right is having to apologize for things that were created by the left, Nazis, socialists, left, KKK, Democrats, left.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  But they failed in their mind control before. The hoax isn't completely working. It can fade again.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  We have to stand against the peer pressure and tell our friends, our family, everyone, that it's total hype and mind control. Let's come back, introduce the pastor that was the witness to the coup plot against the president with the latest developments.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  And I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody and you can't support an organization that didn't fight harder. Look at the response we're getting.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  We were changing the world together. You are the info war. God bless you all.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other super food ingredients known for cleansing and super charging the body at the same time.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist. We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support caveman is finally back at the info war store.

[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans. We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  dropped by the site today order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  Then Pastor Roman Pena good friends with Gary Haven also part of the same prayer council National Prayer Council President Trump is also going to be joining us. I'm on the road in Seattle. The crew is in Austin, Texas.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  Again Gary Haven is their researcher filmmaker founder of curves billionaire entrepreneur their co host Owen shroyer. I cannot and I'm going to turn the interview over now so they have more time. I cannot express to you the razor's edge we're on right now.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  Mr Brown, who famously is there with his hands laying on the president a few months ago and the media demonized it, went to Congress the day after that and was told by high level Congressman they're preparing a coup and overthrow outside of impeachment.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  And then he got visited by the Secret Service and he reportedly went back and talked to the source they said no we mean a physical removal. Well we have the former head of the CIA Brennan who's a lobbyist admittedly converted to radical Islam saying you better shut your mouth and watch your mouth.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  We have Schumer saying we have seven ways of Sunday to take you out on CNN as well. And you have Brennan coming out four days after Brown was on the show and saying it's true at the Aspen Institute with Wolf Blitzer and the former head of National Intelligence.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  Clapper that we are preparing outside of normal areas outside the Constitution to remove the president suddenly get ready both parties are going to do it prepare yourself in the next two months.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  Now that was three weeks ago. We're getting close to a month out from when they say they're going to be done. And that's why you see the operatives on the Economic Council leaving him.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  It's why you see this whole hoax that he's a racist and never decried David Duke never decried the events in Charlotte.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  That's why we now know crisis actors were hired according to Democrats themselves and sent there to stir up the fight we're not defending the white supremacists either we're saying it's a staged event.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  This is their move there they're getting ready to try to hurt him in the eyes of the public enough to when they killing or drug him and say he's collapsed that people just buy into it somehow and then you'll all feel disillusioned and you as his listeners his supporters Christians and others will be so demonized.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  That you can be the new Jews in America because that's what they've done Hillary creates all right nine 10 months ago then she connects it to all conservatives all Christians then because it's her term the Democrats created.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  They can now define all right as the white supremacist even though it's a tiny minority probably 100 white nationalists there.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  Maybe five or six idiot KKK morons but it doesn't matter the president says come together love each other I decried the white supremacist they don't care they're going to beat this drum ahead of the big event show we need to pray here today not just cover this info.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  Now after he was again on they had Al Gorgon the late late show and say we're getting ready to take him out the next few months both parties let's work together then they had Phil mud.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  Who helped John Wilkes Booth kill our other Republican president Abraham Lincoln he's from Virginia we trace his lineage it's crazy his name in the Latin even means the man of the swamp so a man of the swamp related to the guy reportedly killed Lincoln or helped John Wilkes Booth killing he was convicted of it.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  Is on CNN as the former deputy director of the CIA and basically covert action killing people he's not a pencil pusher and former deputy director of the FBI he sell both seats works for the Democrats.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  He is Mueller's best friend basically he said we're getting ready to kill him.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  Okay, so they're now on TV a week ago saying we're going to killing.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  So talk about the pastor what he told you being confirmed we're going to go to the pastor here in a moment and but I wanted to play a mud here saying this just a week ago here it is.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  What was your response Phil mud a couple surprises let me give you one bottom line as a former government official government's going to kill this guy.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  He defends Vladimir Putin their State Department and CIA offers are coming home and at Langley and at foggy bottoms CIA and state they're saying this is how you defend us.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  Phil before I meant I want to ask you a question but Phil just to reiterate obviously when you're talking about killing you're using that as a metaphor you're not.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  What I'm saying is government people talk about the deep state when you disrespect government officials who've done 20 or 30 years they're going to say really you send the Vladimir Putin sends officers home and you support him before you support.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  I just want to underline.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  Trump signed the sanctions it's all lies he didn't even say that about Putin just it's lying to the public they say of nothing but disrespect for you they're not going to stop lying.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  So Pastor Rodney Howard Brown thank you so much sir for joining us I'm going to give you the floor now please take over with your co host in the next 40 minutes or so.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  And that of course is Gary Haven and Owen shroyer but thank you for being the watchman on the wall that really as you signaled this then in the days that followed the damn broke this is so biblical.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  I really want to hear your teaching sir take over.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  Well first of all thanks for having me on again I just got back from a trip to Asia was in India Sri Lanka and Hong Kong and everybody was so excited about the president.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  You know they not everybody watches the BBC and CNN but there were many Christians they're praying people have joined the initiative to pray for the president.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  You know what I always say it's a miracle that Donald Trump made it to the White House.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  And of course he's there he's undoing the agenda of the globalist and so they're so upset.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  First of all the Russian narrative comes you know it's on everything Russia Russia now of course that whole thing is unwinding.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  And they're finding out that Russia had nothing to do with the with the with Trump getting elected it was actually the American people.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  So now of course they stirring up all this other nonsense now trying to get racism going get a race war get what we call an American spring going.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  And then it was actually supposed to start on the 2nd of July.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  So they're actually running late.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  But I tell you I believe it's going to fail because I don't believe the polls or anybody that says that the president is lost his support.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  I believe the president's support has grown.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  The American people are not stupid.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  They seem through the lies of the mainstream media that has now been what people don't understand when the president made the statement about Charlottesville.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  And he talked about both sides.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  People don't understand that Antifa was co-opted and so was Black Lives Matter was co-opted.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  And so and there's probably people inside the Ku Klux Klan that have been co-opted.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  All of this stuff is probably a CIA operation anyway to try to get a massive uprising going on in America get a race war going get a civil war going.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  But I tell you we are praying and I believe it's not going to happen.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  And I believe what they think is going to happen is going to backfire on them.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  It's going to backfire on the media.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  It's going to backfire on every plan.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  What the way we're praying that God would unravel every plan of the enemy and pull the wheels off of Ferris chariots that God would wreak havoc in the camp of the enemy that he would turn on themselves like a dog on its own tail.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  And that God is the church is going to wake up and the preachers need to excuse me Alex the preachers need to grow a pair and stand up in the pulpit and call a spade a spade and say it just like it is.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  And draw a line in the sand and tell the devil you're not going to have America.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  God has heard our prayer.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  He gave us Donald J. Trump as a last minute reprieve and I don't believe God answers prayer by settling out to be set back.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  And so I understand the plan to take him out but they're not going to succeed.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  Not on our watch.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  And we're not going quietly into history.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  They're smoking some incredibly bad weed if they think we're going quietly into history.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  I'm going to skip this break so you have even more time this year on fire and it's total truth.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  And I had absolutely forgotten that Soros and all of them announced and spent hundreds of millions that July 2nd the new revelation was coming.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  They were going to start race wars in America and they think we're so stupid that it all fizzled out but then it finally happened on Soros' birthday.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  They've announced it all and then there's new levels of lying they're putting out against all of us.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  But as you said you're right there's providence here so please continue.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  I am going to leave now.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  I'm going to be interrupting.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  I want the other co-hosts to jump in but keep laying out what you're saying because what you're saying is what's in my heart.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  What's intellectual I understand.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  But also folks I know in the Pentagon people I know that have been high level CIA State Department not just Pachennic.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  They're saying exactly what you're saying and naming names.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  It's criminal elements of the CIA.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Not the whole CIA but the deep state leftist and they are so angry because he's turning the economy around.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  The blessings are coming back in when he on January 20th asked for God to come back into America and providence and they use the name Jesus Christ.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  I mean this is powerful and this is clearly a spiritual war because they hate Christians.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  That's why they fund Orthodox Islam to attack Christians.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  So you've got 10 minutes to break or 12 minutes to break and we've got the crew here lay out Pastor Brown what we're facing and then please give people your website so people can learn more about your powerful teaching.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  You'll be here with us till 40 after but you can stay longer too.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  We've got another member of your great international and national organizations that also praise with Trump.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  Mr. Pena joining us but please continue.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  Okay so here's what they're trying to do.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  Obviously they're trying to label everybody as a wide extremist as a racist.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  Our church here in Tampa is totally integrated.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  We have every tribe and tongue.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  We've been working in the inner city of Tampa.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  The church is 20 years old.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  I can go anywhere in the inner city and the people love us because they know how we've helped them and what we're doing.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  So the fact of the matter is this what they want to try to do is go from what they call alt-right and KKK, white supremacists and then label Christians.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  Conservative Christians are going to fit the bill too.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  So this is like a almost like a Salem witch trial where they're going to go on this hunt.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  You know they first of all want to take out the president because he actually speaking on behalf of the people and I didn't see anything wrong with what the president said.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  On his first statement or even his second statement.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  I can't believe how the media would take everything and just twist it.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  So this is obviously a concerted effort of the media coming together with one purpose and one goal to just label the president and try to put pressure on him to just quit throwing the towel.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  But Mr. President if you are watching or listening don't stop.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  The American people are behind you and here's the thing.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  In the 1700s if you go back and look at England in the mid 1700s about 1740 1750 the UK was in the biggest upheaval.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  The whole of the country was everybody was drinking.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  There were drunkards from the royal family all the way down.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  The British people had a bad name on the continent in the rest of Europe.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  If you mentioned that you were British they would almost like you know spit.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  It was a bad name all the music all the plays all the poems had with foul language course.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  The penal code was so strict because of the crimes were so bad human slavery was at an all time high.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  But then God sent a revival that started with the Wesley Brothers that actually shook across England and actually jumped jumped across the pond.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:58.000]  That really caused the first great awakening in America with people like George Whitfield and Jonathan Edwards and Peter Cartwright.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:07.000]  The city of Boston only had 25,000 people in the population at the time and they would preach and the crowds would come.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  And there was opposition of course people would actually moon them.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  They would urinate in their direction but the city had to pass a law that no one could sit in the trees.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  Because as they preached the power of God would fall and people would fall out of the trees under the power.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  So that's what shook early America and even coming to the 1800s in Cambridge, Kentucky when 25,000 people gathered.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  The city of Lexington only had 1800 people in the population but 25,000 people gathered.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  So God sent a great awakening in the 1700s and the 1800s and America was in an upheaval.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  You know before the foundation of this land you had 13 rebel colonies.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  But God brought this nation together as one nation under God.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  Yes there was a problem.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  Yes there was a problem with slavery and all that kind of stuff.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  But through divine providence this became a nation woven together by the hand of God.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  And I'm not saying that America is being innocent because as you and I know that America has been God hijacked from the foundation of our Federal Reserve.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  And then the IRS that polices the American people all the way down through the years.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  How they took over the education.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  How they begin to dumb down the people.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  How they even took over the seminaries and they begin to take the word of God and make it of none effect.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  Basically denying the virgin birth, denying the resurrection and taking the power of God away from the churches.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  This was all a planned design that took place many, many years ago.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  Then you saw prayer taken out of schools.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  Then you saw the 10 commandments taken from the courthouses.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  So we have a whole generation now that have been raised up that have no fear of God.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  And they've been pumping the filth through Hollywood, through television, through everything possible.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  And entertainment basically to put the people into the trunks that they end right now.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  And you could see with NBC and ABC and CNN and all of these news agencies that basically are controlled by the same people that are basically pumping night and day.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  I was walking through the airport in Hong Kong and there was CNN and I could read the ticket tape and everything was just attacking Trump night and day, night and day.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  So they're on an agenda right now.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  But I believe that we are going to see divine intervention and I believe with all my heart that God is going to shake America from the White House to every house.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  From sea to shining sea, from Maine to the Keys to San Diego to Seattle, across the great state of Alaska.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  The Hawaiian chain to the island nation of Guam, American Samoa to Puerto Rico.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  That God is not finished with America.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  I don't care what the media says.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  I don't care what the papers say.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  I don't care what they try to stir up in our ineffective Congress or even our Senate where that the whole place has been bought and is under the control of a cabal that basically runs the show.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  But God put an outsider in to give America one last opportunity.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  And I believe that we are going to see another great spiritual awakening.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  That's why they're so upset.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  That's why they're trying to do everything that they can.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  And they just label, if you don't agree with them, then you must be a racist.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  Well, guess what?
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  We're not racists.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  We love God and we love people.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  We love people of every tribe and every tongue.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  And so God is moving in our land.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  I have a Bible school here.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  We've had 500 students here this morning and I addressed them.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  I spoke about some of these things, the place when people understand and we have every tribe and tongue in our Bible school.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  So God is raising up an army of men and women that will not compromise, that will not sit with one foot in the world and one foot in the kingdom of God.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  God's raising up preachers that are not worried about their tax exempt status, that will boldly speak out from the pulpits of the land and that will say exactly what needs to be said.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  And I feel it's happening, Alex.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  I feel God is doing that and we are seeing a ground swell.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  I believe there are more that are with us than are with them.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  These people are a minority that make the biggest amount of noise and try to act out like a majority.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  And that's not the case.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  So I believe we're going to see the hand of God intervening in our nation and I understand the plan to take to remove the president.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  But you know, when I launched that prayer initiative, we literally have thousands of people now that have gone to our website, revival.com,
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  and signed up on the president prayer initiative that are praying around the clock.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  When I walked into a church in Hong Kong, a Chinese lady grabbed me and she said,
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  I signed up. I signed up. I'm praying for the president.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  So people all over the world are praying for America, praying for our president and praying that God intervenes as he has in the 1700s and the 1800s,
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  that he does it one more time that God intervenes in our country.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  So I see all the stuff happening, but I have great excitement in myself, in my spirit, to believe that God has heard our cry and that he is intervening.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  And I believe that all these plans of the enemy that God is going to pull the rugs from underneath them.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  And whatever they set up, if they dig a ditch for us, they're falling at themselves.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  So I know that's maybe a little bit of a different side from what some people would expect or want to hear, but that's what I feel right down in my deepest part of my heart.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  Hello Pastor, this is Gary Haven. We finally got Alex to get out and go on vacation. I got to tell you, amen.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  You know, the only hope that we have ultimately, because this is a spiritual battle,
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  you know, the enemy is doing everything he can to still kill and destroy this country.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  And you're right about everything you said. I got to tell you, it was almost like a prayer for 10 minutes, listening to you.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  You know, one of my best friends is Pastor Romero Pena. He's on the Trump's Advisory Committee.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  So I get to spend time with him almost daily to get the inside.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  We're going to have him on here as a guest in a bit. And he's going to tell us about Trump's spirituality.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  And I think he's going to say that Trump's a baby Christian, but he's a Christian.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  And he knows God has put him in this place and this time for this purpose and understands that.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  And he is one of the first presidents in memory to have a spiritual advisory committee,
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  a group that he met with very early in his presidency, so that he's sure to hear what God would have for him.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  And you know, the truth is such a fragile thing right now.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  You know, what you witness on your trip on the TV screen is what we've seen all this week.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  It is the truth being twisted and distorted, omitted in a way that I've never seen before.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  I've been an observer of this for a long, long time. We have got the truth on our side.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  We have to be bold about it. And I got to tell you, your 10 minutes there was articulate and bold and amazing.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  And I want to commend you for that. And it encourages everybody else, you know, people that are afraid of being ridiculed
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  or made fun of because they're standing up for the truth. It just so happens that right now,
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  the truth is that we have a good man in a White House who's trying to do the right thing by the American people
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  in a system that has been stolen from us, a system that has been bought and paid for.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  You know, either side of the aisle, it's not a Republican or Democrat thing.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  These people are beholden to the moneyed interest.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  And, you know, I made a movie. I don't know if you got to see it.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  I forget. And the bylaw in the movie was they've stolen our country and it's time to take it back.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  And I believe that right now they have stolen our country and they're getting more violent, more dishonest,
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  particularly this last week than they've been a long, long time.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  We have got to recognize this. And by the way, the only hope, and I completely agree with this, is Jesus,
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  the author of truth. We have got to come together. You know, I spent a lot of time in Haiti last year.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  I actually lived there six weeks flying search and rescue in save the lives of dozens of, guess what, black Haitians.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  So I've got the credentials that people can't criticize me and call me a racist.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  And, you know, we love these people. And by the way, you're South African.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  I've been to Joburg a couple of times. It's really scary that they're going to try to repeat here in America what they've done in South Africa.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  Why don't you tell us a little bit about what's going on there and how we can avoid that?
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  Well, what's happening in South Africa right now, you, first of all, the borders are open.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  So unofficial population is just about a hundred million.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  And we heard that right from the inside of the headquarters in Pretoria that does all the census.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  They said we can't announce it, but there's a hundred million people.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  So you've got all the Nigerians that have come down, the Zambians, many, many from Central and North Africa.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  We'll be right back with more on the Alex Jones Show. Gary Haven, Owen Stroyer, Pastor Roddy Brown with us.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:03.000]  Research across the board is clear. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.

[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:17.000]  If you would, please continue us about the South African version because it may very well be a preview of what's going to happen here in this country.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  Okay, so now you have this influx of everybody coming down, taking the jobs of the black South Africans and they start to kill one another,
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  what's called xenophobia.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  So it's black on black violence in the townships where they're killing Nigerians, killing, you know, all the foreigners that they feel they're taking their jobs.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  But then you've got this group of people that feel like the white farmers need to pay for their sins.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  So they're going from farm to farm, killing, it's almost genocide at this juncture right now.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  I mean, basically they'll come to a farm.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  I mean, these are wealthy farmers that have had the farms for hundreds of years.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  They'll come right onto the property.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  They'll grab the man.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  They'll cut his eyelids off so he can't close his eyes.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  They'll rape his wife.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  They'll kill his kids in front of him and then kill him.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  And just leave, they don't steal anything.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  They just come and murder.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  It's a genocide that's taking place right now because they feel like they need to purge the land from all the things that have happened in history.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  And of course, what people don't understand that all this agenda, this is all an agenda that's been laid out a long, long time ago.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  You cannot do what you're doing.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  The cabal that runs the planet cannot do what it's doing if the people are unified.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  So what they do is they'll come in and cause the problem.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  I saw the problem now just in Hong Kong between political groups that are even dividing the churches.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  So you can see that taking place even in India now.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Pastor Brown, Pastor Brown, I can't help it.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  This is so powerful.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  I hope you'll come back and join us more often.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  I know you travel the world in such an amazing job and my crew's here co-hosting, but I just can't be drug away.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  Specifically, you've covered the positive global awakening without the enemies coming in against the spirit of God.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  But specifically, can you get into how the Secret Service visited you but won't visit the former CIA deputy director that said they're preparing to kill the president
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  or the former director that said they're preparing to remove him?
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  Can you talk about after you warned the world they came and visited you and then I read that you talked to Congress again.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  I wanted to confirm that.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  It's only read in a newspaper.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  You have to check those obviously and because they lie so much and that you did confirm that they were saying it was physically removed.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  IE, physical coup. Can you just speak to those things?
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  Yeah. First of all, I never talked to Congress again because I got the story right the first time.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  When the Secret Service called us was due to somebody reporting us to Washington, D.C., probably a disgruntled minister.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  That's how things go.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  So anyway, they called the office here and I was in two meetings a day and I said, listen, come to my office.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  Come meet with me.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  So they arrived, walked in the main Secret Service guy, two other guys with him that he was training and I showed them.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  I've got a lot of animals in my office because I'm a hunter.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  So they looked, they saw my elephant and everything and we were laughing and we sat down.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  He opened up a folder and he said, so who's the Congressman?
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  And I said, I can't tell you that.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  I started to laugh and he said, well, you said, we need to know the Congressman.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  I said, absolutely not.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  I said, I'll tell you everything he said.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  And I said that I was told that the talk on the Hill was that the President would be removed physically in the next two months.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  And I used the terminology that was told to me by the Congressman.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  He said, well, we need to know who the Congressperson is.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  I said, I'm sorry, sir.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  I can't tell you.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  You're probably going to have to subpoena me and then I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that junk shop.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  Probably pull a Hillary Clinton at that time.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  But the fact of the matter is I said, if you boys are doing your job, then you already know why you come here.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  And bother me about it.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  I felt that then he tried to insinuate that I was trying to draw people to my website.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  I said, go to ranking.com.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  My website's been in the top 200,000 websites in the world for 15 years.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  What are you talking about?
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  I said, I'm trying to get people to pray and get people to my website.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  What weed are you smoking?
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  Anyway, it worked out.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  Let's talk about this briefly before your colleague joins us because this is so incredible.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  They're already in the news and they're going to remove him.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  You say this, then right after you say it, they go on the news and say they're getting ready to remove him physically outside of impeachment.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  Now they say they're going to kill him, which totally vindicates you.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  But then they tried to spin it like you were bad.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  This is this upside down world.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  Why do you think suddenly the former director of national intelligence, the former head of the CIA, the former deputy head all said they're going to remove him or kill him?
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  And Al Gore said he'd be removed the next two months as well.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  They all said exactly what you said.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  I've talked to members of Congress too.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  They're calling them up, telling them you better get in line.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  You better not back Trump or we'll get you too.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  I've gotten these phone calls and of course they're in confidence.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  You can't say there's an intimidation campaign going on.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  Now you see it a month in after your warning, the gear up for the demonization and the civil unrest.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  So let's speak to why you think they came out right after you spoke this and clearly now you've been proven right.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  What do we do next?
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  Obviously prayer is paramount, but in the information war, call Congress, call C-SPAN, call talk radio.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  I mean, what do we do spread this live interview right now or the videotape interview of this?
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  I mean, what do we do temporarily?
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  And I agree.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  It's all about spirit and God and the rest will happen.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  But specifically, why did they do this?
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  Right after you said it, A, B, what do we do?
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  What's coming next?
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  Look, they were here for about 15 minutes.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  Then he realized it was a nothing burger and then they left.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  I haven't heard back from them again.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  And even if they can't take them again, I wouldn't tell them who the Congress person is.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  I've had people try to guess, but they must just keep guessing.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  The fact of the matter is this, that like you said, they have not investigated the other people or gone to them,
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  but they just try to basically intimidate.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  Maybe they thought that I was a pastor who's just going to roll over, but they picked on the wrong person.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  I don't play by that game.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  So, you know, Alex, I'm a radical.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  I mean, I believe in the Constitution, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  We start gun clubs in churches.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  I give away AR-15s on a Sunday morning.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  So maybe I'm going to run a different kind of a church.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  I'm not sure that even some of the other men that are on the council would even do stuff like that.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  But I know what America is about.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  And, you know, I grew up-
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  I understand you're victorious.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  God's a victorious spirit.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  So here we are.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  The enemy wants to stay on their platforms.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  They're going to kill the president.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  But they don't want us on our platforms to prepare the people to say no and know how much danger he is in.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  Can you speak to that specifically and just what it's like to be praying with him?
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  And we have another pastor coming on who prays with him routinely and what you think about, you know, the spirit of Trump
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  and why God's chosen him right now to be in this key position and the great courage he has with what's happened to his family, him.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  I mean, I don't want to just sit here and talk about how great he is, but he is in the lion's den right now.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  This is such an incredible moment.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  Please continue.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  I think the fact of the matter is this that, you know, they're going to try everything to try to stop him because he's already wrecking the agenda.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  Basically, he allowed to finish his first term.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  He was set the globalist agenda back 30 to 40 years.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  I mean, that's what's going on here.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  That's why you see the same people of the GOP that are attacking him, the same people like Lindsey Graham and John McCain
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  and all of the, and Mittens Romney and all of the other people, the same people, the same media that was attacking him.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  So what I want to say to Christians, obviously you need to pray.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  The best thing to do, I know when you sit down to pray over your food, bless your food, ask God to bless your food and then pray for the president.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  That'll at least be three times a day that you can do that.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  Then call your congressman and call your senator and tell them, we just want you to know that we support our president.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  Because they need to give from you.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  What I've learned is a lot of the people up on the hill, they get the information from the news media.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  Well, the news media is going to put a spin and a bias and an agenda.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  So they need to give from the American people.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  And I tell you, these people are in for a shock because not only will he succeed in what he's doing,
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  but he will win the second term and it will be by landslide.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  Because by that time we would have already cleared out all the fake people that voted in this last election that gave Hillary the popular vote,
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  which was really bogus in any way, shape or fashion, that you look at it.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  Look, everybody has to stand up.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  You know, if we don't hang together, we'll hang separately.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  And if people just leave this thing alone and you think it will all sort itself out, it won't.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  We need to pray like it all depends on God and then we need to get up and go like it all depends on him.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  The president is a man that has asked for prayer.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  He, and I'll say this, he's been in five hour prayer meetings with people just praying.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  I even asked people, so does he sit on his phone when he's, they said there's no phone around him.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  He just with his head bowed and as people pray, he's a very humble man when it comes to the things of God.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  And I could tell you the way that he responded to us when we walked into the Oval Office.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  My jaw dropped open, Alex. Listen.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  I mean, basically the president said that here were people representing the real power, the power of God.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  That's what he said when we walked into the office.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  So I don't care what the media say.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  God has put the president in this position.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  He came up against all odds with all of the other horses that were being backed where they said he would never win anyone.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  And now they're trying to remove him from office.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  But I believe if the people, the American people, the same people that voted for him, voted him office, please do not listen to the media.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  Do not listen to CNN.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  Don't listen even to Fox.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  I beg you, please do not listen to these people.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  They've been co-opted and they're pumping an agenda.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  I'm just telling you right now, you know in your gut feeling, that's why you backed the president when he was running against all odds,
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  against every lie, against $2 billion thrown at him.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  He still succeeded.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  And so to every American, to every patriot, to every person, even if you're American living in another country,
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  find out where your congressperson is, call them and tell them.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  We just want you to know that we backed the president and you better back him.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  Otherwise we're going to remove you in 2018 or 2020.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  It's time.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  It's time now to draw a line in the sand.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  And if they want to fight, we'll take the fight to whatever level needs to happen.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  Pastor, those are powerful words, well spoken.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  We really appreciate having you today.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  I think you've been very informative and really shown the true hope, which is this is a spiritual battle.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  And those of us that have Judeo-Christian worldview need to never forget that and to take it to prayer.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  So thank you very much.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  Good talking with you.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  Our next guest is Pastor Romero Pena, and I've got to do a little disclosure here.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  He's one of my best friends.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  He also happens to be on President Trump's Spiritual Advisory Committee, as well as President Trump's Hispanic Advisory Committee.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  So he gets a double bite of the apple.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  He's at the White House probably on a monthly basis.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  And he's been sharing with me the true spirit of the president.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  And I think it's a window into who this man is that right now we all need to be aware of and perhaps reminded of.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  Romero, glad to have you join us today.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  Thank you, Gary.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  It's a real honor to be with you and with Alex.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  Well, Alex was really curious when I brought you up the other day.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  He wanted to know the heart of President Trump.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  And I kind of quoted you on that.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  He's a baby Christian, but he knows that he has been put in this position by God himself for this point in time.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  Would you share your personal experience with the president and his heart?
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  Sure, I'd be happy to.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  I met him in July of last year, last summer, when he became the candidate for the GOP.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  When I was asked to join about 15 leaders from 12 states, national Hispanic leaders, to form the Hispanic Advisory Council.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  And I was honored to do so.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  The Lord already impressed upon my heart that God had chosen him. A dear friend of mine, Lance Wall, now got a revelation of Isaiah 45.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  You're probably familiar with that 45th chapter of Isaiah speaks of the king who the Lord chose Cyrus and say he's my chosen.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  He's my anointed.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  And this is the 45th president.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  I won't go into that, but it's just how I got clarity in my heart by reading Isaiah 45 that Donald Trump really was a Cyrus coming up with God's hand on him.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  So when I met him, he came into the room that we're sitting in his boardroom in Trump Tower in New York.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  And I was asked to open the meeting in prayer.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  The media was there for that very beginning part by 40 or 50 members that were standing behind me.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  I was facing the president, like the candidate at the time and in the middle of the table.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  And he sat down across from me in the facilitator.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  A good friend of mine, Jenny Corn said, Pastor Benia, would you open this in prayer?
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  So I said, she told me she was going to ask.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  So I did and I prayed and I prayed like I normally pray.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  I didn't do anything fluffy or religious sounding.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  I just prayed and asked God to open the heavens and pour out his spirit over our gathering there.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  And as soon as I said, amen, he looked up at me and said, that was great.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  Let's start with introductions. Who are you?
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  And the reason I think he did that is because the spirit of God fell in the room as I was praying.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  And this is a man that can pick up on the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  When the anointing of God's spirit comes into a room or manifests, I have seen him perk up, listen,
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  pay attention, even take notes.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  And so that's a discerning, I know some will say highly subjective perspective,
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  but you know, I've been a pastor for nearly 35 years and I think he would have a hard time.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  He's not trying to do a put on here or act spiritual all of a sudden because it's been in multiple contexts
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  that I've seen him just respond when the Spirit of the Lord is moving or somebody's giving him a word
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  that really is great counsel or wisdom and he just perks up and tends to really pick up on the Spirit of the Lord.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  So I introduced myself, we went around the room, the meeting was dismissed.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  We had a great meeting. He was very thoughtful. He was a great listener.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  He took careful notes for about an hour and a half with 15 people.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  And that was my first experience with him.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  I've had several since then over the last year, 13 months.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  One more remarkable one was a private dinner in the White House on the evening before he gave the executive order on the Johnson amendment.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  It was privileged to sit at his table. There were only five tables. It was a very small group.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  And his attentiveness, his responsiveness to the clergy that were around the table.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  If I told you who was around that particular table with Paul White, his senior pastoral advisor, they're all national leaders.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  I tell people I felt like a mule at the Kentucky Derby.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  But they were really great leaders and everyone just commented what a great listener he is.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  And so there's no doubt in my heart that he is committed to the Lord and doing the best he can before God.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  This is Pastor Romanio Peña. He is joining us today.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  And normally we would be going to break right now, but because this information is so key and because our guests are so intelligent.

[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  Now going back to Pastor Pena, you're shedding a light on President Trump that the media doesn't talk about, that nobody really talks about.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  And that's the spiritual side. And you said something to me that I could relate to that you don't really see from all humans.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  Unfortunately, you talked about the presence of the Holy Spirit. There is a presence that people can feel.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  It makes the hair on the back your neck stand up. It gives you tingles. It makes you feel like there's something out there that's better than you.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  There's something out there that unites all of us. And you're saying that President Trump is tapping into that.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  I believe he is. And I think whether I haven't discussed that with him, but it's something I've definitely personally observed.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  That when the Lord is speaking and giving what I would call Godly counsel, whatever the source, he picks up on it and he lights up and responds.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  And it becomes very attentive. And he's done that. I've seen him do that on several occasions. And whether he understands what's happening or not,
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  I don't know because I haven't discussed it. I'm just telling you what I personally observed. And he definitely responds when the Spirit of the Lord is speaking, moving in prayer times.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  I've seen him just open his palms up just like toward the, you know, on his lap or kind of midsection of his body, open his palms to receive what's happening, what's being prayed.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  And that's a very kind of organic, natural, normal kind of response to kind of receive what's being prayed. And I've seen him do that.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  And what he understands about that, I don't know, but I do know he does pick up on the presence of the Lord and I've seen it personally.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  You and I have had a lot of discussions about Trump's steps forward, maybe one back. Do you have an opinion on why he seems to tolerate people around him that tend to perhaps be from, you know, the globalist community or the banking community?
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  What are your thoughts on that? Do you feel like that maybe he's just trying to find his way right now?
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  Well, I think he is building more relationships and probably he ever has right now. And I think he, my assumption, my guess would be that he is testing the waters with people and trying to get the best wisdom and insight he can, whatever the source might be.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  He has a good nose for talent. And when somebody is really talented in a specific area, he wants to know what they have to say.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  Now, whether that's a good source or not, I think he eventually figures out and acts, responds accordingly. But I think he's so open to wisdom and good counsel, he's trying to get it from whatever source.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  And, you know, you and I might differentiate who we want to listen to, but because of some, you know, experiences or ideas we have about the world. But I think he's just so wide open to getting the very best information, the very best counsel from what is normally seen as just the most talented people and the natural, if you will.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  And I think it explains the broad spectrum of people that he's surrounded himself with. And other than that, that's about all I'd say about that.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  I want to take that a step further because I agree with you. And that is his strategy. You know, you got to put the best people in there, even people that know the ins and outs of stuff that might be globalist just to show them the way, as Gary just said.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  But I want to take that a step further. How is he putting up with all of, in my opinion, libel and slander against him and his family every day, calling him a racist, accusing him of things? How does he put up with that? How does he tolerate that?
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  Well, it's interesting. I think one of the great things that bullies him and lifts him up is all people that are praying for him. He's told me the most, the five most important words he ever hears is, are, I am praying for you.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  And I think it is the prayers of the saints, people that are lifting him up, that understand how dire things are, how important it is to pray for him. I think that's what's helping him and giving him the emotional and spiritual strength he needs to tolerate constant attack.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  So, you know, I have posted several videos from the White House begging people, pray for the president, pray for the president. He wants it, he acknowledges it, and again, he says those are the five most important words he ever hears, I am praying for you.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  There was even a campaign of people sending him postcards just to tell him that they're praying for him. And I would encourage people to do that again, even if you do it once a week, once a month, whenever, sending that note.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  I think that's what's supporting him and lifting him up right now. Otherwise, I personally don't know how somebody doesn't just completely wither under the barrage of any attack that he's under.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  Had difficulty to get to ask you, Romero. Do you personally know Pastor Rodney Brown?
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  I shook his hand. I think at the White House, I don't have a relationship with him. I heard the last just seven or eight minutes of his commentary in the interview. I'm sorry, I missed the rest of it. It sounded just tremendous, but no, I do not know him personally.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  Yeah, you want to go and watch that. It was pretty amazing. It was almost like a prayer for 15 or 20 minutes as he was doing his discourse on what was happening there.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  Amazing guy. You should reach out to him. And I know you do a lot of public speaking. You and I have been on Jim Baker program countless times, kind of talking about how things work. Really great to see you.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  I'm sure this weekend you and I are going to go find a quiet place and talk about this crazy week. Any last comments on this crazy week?
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  Well, I don't think I could get started and we'd go off to the races. There's too many, too many topics, too many issues. But let me, a last comment I would make is to thank you personally, Gary. Thank you, Alex, your whole team. Thank you for what you're doing.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  Thank you for being wonderful patriots. Thank you for speaking the truth. Thank you for your courage. And I've added Alex to my prayer list as well.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  So the Lord would protect you and his angels to surround you and that more people would tune in and listen. God bless you both.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  Thank you, Romero. And thanks for all the good work you do. And we will be back in a few minutes.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  Let's go.
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000]  Let's go.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  The formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products. And this part is most important. The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard. That means it's clean. That means it's pure.
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:48.000]  You're finding the tip of the spear in the info war. That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:21.000]  Roger Stone is about to be in studio breaking down his latest intel. But I wanted to make a point here before I got out of here. And we also may have a video. I did a little undercover video yesterday getting people to sign a petition to remove George Washington from the dollar bill.
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  So we may have that as well as another Easter egg that we found out. But I wanted to just have this conversation with you before I got out of here, Gary. With all of these people protesting removal of these statues, this that or the other thing, it's all going on.
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  I don't want to go to civil war over Confederate statue. Honestly, that's not something I want to go to a civil war over. These are local communities. If they want to remove the statue legally, then okay, you're going to do that.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  But that's not what's happening. There is no debate. There is no conversation. And it just got me thinking. The real political debate that we need to be having right now is conservatism versus progressing.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  What areas should we be? Okay, here's an area where we can be progressing right now. Humanity is ready to progress over here. Here's an area over here. Well, let's still let's conserve this thing. We're not ready to, but we don't get that debate. We don't have that political debate. We just have, we get drugged through the mud of racism or we get drugged through the mud of Nazi or we get drugged through the mud of Russia, all this fake news.
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  Humanity, we, you know, us as Americans, we're not even able to have that higher intellectual debate of conservatism versus progressivism.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  Yeah, I agree with you. On the statue issue, you know, communities, unless it's a federal park, communities ought to have the right to say what stays up and what doesn't.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  You know, revisionist history, by the way, which is rampant right now, kind of my hobby is going back over looking for true history. It's a fascinating thing to do.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  That's where the real history is.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  Oh, it's amazing. And we could have a week of shows about that.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  And that's part of the problem is these people don't know history.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  Yeah, and, you know, they just, they've been spoon fed the, you know, the politically correct version. That's what's going on with this as well.
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  You know, when Trump was defending in that press conference over the infrastructure, he was saying what's going to be next, the George Washington statues. And guess what?
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  It was 100% right.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  That happened, happened literally the next day.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  So, you know, communities should have the right to make that kind of decision and hopefully they'll make it thoughtfully and not so stupidly that it seems to have occurred.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  You know, I think what you're going to find, Owen, is that every democratic community across America is going to have no statues other than, you know, the politically correct ones.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  Maybe there'll be statues of Hillary.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  Oh, Bill Clinton and Robert Byrd statues, you know, Robert Byrd has like dozens of streets named after him in West Virginia and statues.
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  A KKK member.
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  Yeah.
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  But no one's protesting that statue.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  Who really, if you look at it as accomplishments, it looks like Hillary's accomplishment.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  Nothing did he really do for state of West Virginia.
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  And yet they're honoring him as if he's some big hero.
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  You know, that guy stayed in that office for like the 50 years.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  It's amazing.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  They had to roll him into the building and yet they were continuing to elect him.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  You know, I think what we've got to do right now is we've got to really take a stand about the media.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  And Trump did a pretty interesting job in that press event.
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  He shouted back, you are fake news over and over.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  Pointed him to.
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  Is it the you people?
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  And I got to tell you, as unpleasant as that was, I think we thinking people have to.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  America loves it.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  America loves it when he points to the fact because that's who's really dividing us.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  I mean, ultimately, we should all be able to unite behind the CNNs of the world, the MSNBCs of the world, all these people spreading fake news.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  Because even the protesters when I go out on the street and talk to these people, they know CNN and MSNBC is fake news.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  So I'm like, well, then why do you believe what they say?
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  And it's, you know, and it's easy.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  People are lazy.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  We're all lazy.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  That's exactly right.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  We don't want to do the investment to think critically or to do our research.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  And again, that's a great reason, Owen, that you're here and Alex in this program is you help people wrestle with the truth.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  And I tell you, sometimes that truth is unpleasant.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  But if we're going to save our country from the globalist and the diminishing of our country, we're going to have to fight for the truth.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000]  I think we all have to have a mantra.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  I do not watch fake news.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  Deny it every time you can.
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  Just unplug it.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  Just completely remove yourself from that spectrum.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:37.000]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:23.000]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:45.000]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:46.000]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:06.000]  It's Roger Stone.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:21.000]  I haven't seen the liberal media freaking out this bad since Trump won the election and this might be even worse because now instead of almost breaking out into tears, Van Jones did break out into tears and it looked like Anderson Cooper and Don Lemonhead were trying to hold them back.
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:29.000]  Even Jimmy Fallon put his show on hold to give an anti-Trump editorial and Jimmy Kimmel is saying that he needs to go.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000]  What did the president do?
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  You're wondering to cause all this grief and to cause people to call for his impeachment.
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  Well, when he denounced the horrible and deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend, he said that both sides were violent and that both sides were causing problems.
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000]  Well, how dare you, Mr. President?
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  Please repeat that horrible statement that you made on Saturday, Mr. President.
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  That is endorsing the neo-Nazi white supremacist KKK and Adolf Hitler himself.
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  I brought it. I brought it. I brought it. As I said on, remember the Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.000]  It has no place in America and then I went on from there.
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  Now here's the thing as to, excuse me, excuse me, take it nice and easy. Here's the thing, when I make a statement I like to be correct.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  I want the facts. This event just happened. In fact, a lot of the event didn't even happen yet as we were speaking.
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  This event just happened. Before I make a statement, I need the facts. So I don't want to rush into a statement.
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  So making the statement when I made it was excellent. In fact...
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  Oh, it was excellent, huh? Oh, it's this.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  Charlotteville's victim's mother thanks Trump for words of comfort. The mother of the 32-year-old woman who was killed Saturday in a car-ramming attack during violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, thanked President Trump for offering words of comfort and for condemning the violence.
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:02.000]  Quote, thank you President Trump for those words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  Susan Brough, mother of Heather Hayer said in a statement after President Trump called out white supremacists and other hate groups during a press conference Monday afternoon.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  So the poor mother of this girl who was murdered thanked President Trump for denouncing the violence.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  But let's check in and see what CNN had to say about President Trump's statements.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  We normally start off the broadcast saying good evening, but tonight there doesn't seem to be much that is good about this evening because a few hours ago the President of the United States revealed so clearly who and what he really is.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  Today the President of the United States ripped open wounds that have barely begun healing in Charlottesville on a subject race that has tormented this country from the very beginning and nearly torn it apart more than once.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  He ripped open these wounds so he could show the world that he did not make a mistake on Saturday when he spoke words that were ill-considered, untrue and insensitive.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  What exactly is untrue about his statement? Let's check in with Don Lemon and see what he thinks.
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  This is a sad moment for the country and I think it was an awful moment for the person who is supposed to represent the highest office of the land.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  I mean today you saw the real Donald Trump proving all of his critics right in that moment. Everyone was sitting there watching saying here we go, his true colors are coming out.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  These people are more upset with what President Trump said about the event than they are about the girl getting murdered by that psychotic lunatic who ran into that crowd with his car.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  Tell us what you really think of Antifa, Don, the leftist terrorist organization which dresses up like ISIS and then riots every time a conservative speaker is invited to a college campus.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  Mark Dice, media analyst, social critic, political activist and author. He appears in several groundbreaking documentary films including A Visible Empire and The 9-11 Chronicles and was featured on the history channels decoded.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  The newest book is the Bilderberg group, Fact and Fiction. That's got to be interesting. Mark, welcome to the Infowars program. I'm Gary Haven and I've got Roger Stone sitting here. What say you?
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  You know, never before has Alex Jones' Infowars operation been more appropriately named because we're in an information war and as we've all been watching for the last couple days they've ramped it up into levels that are really beyond Orwellian.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:34.000]  And of course they're trying to stoke the fears. Literally glorifying leftist terrorist Antifa. CNN is now literally a terrorist propaganda network. The network itself, their anchors Chris Cuomo is glorifying Antifa on Twitter.
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  This is astonishing and of course they're trying to hype up the anti-Trump fever that we saw brewing last summer when events in Chicago were canceled due to violence, when we saw peaceful Donald Trump supporters being attacked unprovoked, unprovoking their attackers in San Jose and in other cities.
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  We're entering into some dangerous, dangerous territory. So it's glad to be with you guys. I think that Infowars doing such a fantastic operation. And again, never before has the name of this network really been more appropriate because this is an Orwellian information war that we have to win.
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  Well, Mark, I follow your tweets avidly on Twitter. You're a real truth teller. And I'm glad to be with you today. We really are in a Kafkaesque-like moment. I mean, it's truly Alice in Wonderland when the President of the United States speaks an obvious truth, which is to say that violence when condoned or advocated or perpetrated by anyone on the left or the right is wrong.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  And he is slammed for saying that. As if because of history, some people should get a pass while others don't. It's like saying up is down and down is up. It's a moment of true insanity.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  It's beyond bizarre. It would be as if you were brought your wife's girlfriend to a nice restaurant and in the middle of dinner, you're like, you know, this food really sucks. And she'd be like, you know, and you're like, well, this restaurant, this restaurant sucks. And she'd be like, well, what restaurant are you talking about?
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  You didn't name the restaurant specifically. You weren't really clear about what it was you were saying. You know, it's absurd to nitpick and mince his words about his statement, which he made right after the horrific event happened, right? As really one of the details were still emerging about what it was that happened when that psycho ran into that crowd with his car.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  And not only are they just, you know, upset nitpicking him. I mean, I haven't seen them this upset literally since the election. This is perhaps even worse because more dangerous because they're literally trying to brand all Trump supporters as little SS officers, supporters of Adolf Hitler.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  And unfortunately, they want to see more events like we saw where innocent people were being attacked at Trump events just for wearing red MAGA hats. This is, this is incredible. This is really, every time I think that they can't sink any lower, they do, but now we're into just dangerous territory.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  It became laughable about the Russia conspiracy theories. Really, it was almost dying down. It was almost dead. And then they found one little thread to pull on and that was Donald Trump's juniors meeting with someone from Russia.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  They hyped that up for a few days. That died down because it's another nothing burger. Then Paul Manafort had, as being investigated, that's died down. I mean, what did he do?
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  Maybe miss a checkbox on one of his tax forms? I mean, whatever it is that he allegedly did has no direct connection to the campaign.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  This investigative creep has now veered so far off the rails that it's going into just people's personal finances, no relations to this campaign.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  I can't believe that CNN, that these improv pundits, and that's what they are. It's as if you're at an improv comedy show where people give the comedians a topic to talk about, and then they have to make it funny.
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:17.000]  They have to entertain the audience. And that's what the people on CNN, MSNBC, all these, the big three ABC, NBC, CBS, they're improv pundits because they're given a topic they know nothing about.
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  They have a role to play. They have to act it out and try to convince the audience that what they're saying is legitimate. And it's dangerous at this point.
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:47.000]  I've been in the audience on those shows, and of course they hold up the sign that says laugh or clap. And that's what the audience does, and it's about as genuine as being obedient to a sign.
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  They try to stick something to Trump, and they've had to move through all of these events that you just went through. They've been unsuccessful in getting anything to stick, but what they had been successful with is keeping us from talking about the real criminals, the real crimes.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  You know, I have a lot of experience in Haiti where I saw firsthand the Clinton Foundation get away with stealing literally billions of dollars from the poorest to the poor.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:34.000]  And not only was that not being covered, but the people that were going to testify against them. One of them just a few weeks ago was suicided on the Saturday before he was to talk on Tuesday.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  But there's just so many real things going on. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, for example, that they have been successful in filling the news cycle.
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:52.000]  There's only so many minutes a day of news. Successfully filling the news cycle so that they've provided cover for so many things.
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  Seth Rich, the DNC, claiming that it was Russia when they had actually discovered they released it. So you've got to give them credit. Even though we're frustrated and kind of chattering, trying to defend Trump all day long, they have been able to move through the news cycles one after the other and provide cover for the real criminals out there.
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  And it's sad that we have to keep fighting back and keep debunking them on a daily basis. I mean, these allegations that Trump is a racist, let alone a white supremacist supporter, they've been so absurd, they've been debunked for literally decades.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  I mean, Trump's own inner circle. I mean, you know, Rogers worked with them. You guys know this. Amarosa, his promoted black women to positions of power within his organizations. It's so insane because the people who actually know him, the people who've worked with him,
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:19:04.000]  just shaking their head at this. But unfortunately, you have the public who the general public, the general liberals who've just tuned out, are so easily manipulated by this. And now they're not only trying to paint all Trump supporters, you know, to alt-right and racist white supremacists,
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  they're doing the same thing with anybody who is concerned about censorship on the internet. As you guys know, there's some protests that were planned. I don't know. I think some of them have been canceled due to security concerns.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  Protesting Google's censorship regarding the firing of that engineer over his memo, which laid out some basic biological and sociological facts about men and women in a very calm tone. And now they're painting those protesters as being the same people who gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia for the alt-right march. It's so insane.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  Well said, Mark. Taking a break now, we'll be back in a few.

[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:19.000]  Alright, I'm Roger Stone with Gary Heaven. We're here on the Alex Jones show with our guest Mark Dice. Gary, you had another question from Mark?
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:29.000]  Yeah, Mark, I just want to thank you for the great work you're doing. I just happened to have you pop up on my internet last night and watch you.
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  Here you are today in front of me and I get to talk with you. Really great job. People that want to get in touch with you can do it through.
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  This is probably the easiest website I've ever seen, markdice.com.
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  And that takes me directly to my YouTube channel. You know, I'm on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter. YouTube is kind of my primary platform where on almost a daily basis I just debunk the fake news.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:00.000]  Many of my videos are getting more viewers literally than CNN has and that's why they're trying to shut down YouTubers.
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  As you guys may have seen, they've been demonetizing news channels like mine, controversial videos, and they just may have kicked a bee's nest because just last week they demonetized Diamond and Silk's channel.
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  They're the two hilarious black sisters that give commentary on the news and support Donald Trump.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  I love them.
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  They're absolutely hilarious. They become a YouTube sensation, internet sensation. President Trump noticed them during the campaign.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  They came out to events and so YouTube demonetized their channel by 95% last week.
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  Same thing they've done to mine. Same thing they've done to anyone.
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  Trying to prevent them from becoming full-time YouTubers or full-time news commentators.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  And so they have just demonetized, taken away the income of one of, if not the most favorite channel of the President of the United States, of two women who just a week earlier were invited to a meeting with the Department of Labor or the Department of Commerce
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  to talk about developing their business as part of a program to help minority business owners.
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  Let me say, Mark, I see this attack on Diamond and Silk as strictly what it is, racism.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  They're being attacked because they're black and therefore Donald Trump. It's outrageous.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  Where are the faux tears now of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson and Black Lives Matter?
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  Why aren't they standing up for Diamond and Silk? It just shows you how fraudulent the whole thing is.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  Yeah, any black conservative gets attacked. It just comes with the territory.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  Yeah, there was a teenager, a young teenager, I can't remember his name, who was denouncing Barack Obama, making YouTube videos, and then supports President Trump.
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  And there were large portions of people online that were trying to hunt him down and find out where he works and threatening to come and attack him, assault him at his place of employment.
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  And where's the ACLU? Where's Al Sharpton protecting these people? You're right.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  Ben Carson's home was just vandalized yesterday. It's so absurd.
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  And so it's so important that on a daily basis, info wars and everybody just continues to stay vigilant.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  And I see these attacks. They're not demoralizing the base. They're not demoralizing us at all.
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  We're getting more involved because we see what's at risk here. And so we're paying attention.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:33.000]  We're following the news. We're studying history. We're on a daily basis combating this insane terrorist propaganda that they're putting out.
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  And everything so far is only backfired. They said that Trump wasn't going to win. He won.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  They said he, you know, he hates every single thing that they've done is only turned out to be wrong.
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  And we can use it to ridicule them to show people why they should never watch CNN, MSNBC, any of these major broadcast networks.
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  Their audiences are dwindling. You know, if you look at their ratings compared to, you know, in the 80s and 90s,
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  I mean, we had major network television shows that would get a quarter of the entire television audience watching one particular show.
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  25% of all people watching television would watch one particular show.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:20.000]  Now there are tens of thousands of YouTube channels with 100,000 subscribers, thousands with a million subscribers.
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Info Wars, everybody is now fractionalized.
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  And so these major networks are panicking because they don't have the influence that they once did.
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  And that's why they're really coming after all of us trying to hurt us financially, hurting Diamond and Silk financially,
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  trying to hurt Alex, trying to hurt me, to really shut us down because they are scared of us because we're so effective.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  I think that's exactly right. I mean, what's interesting about watching all these talking heads is how completely fraudulent it is.
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  And these are people acting like they're upset.
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:04.000]  A greater concern to me, however, are members of the White House staff, members of the administration,
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  who are now telling reporters on a background basis how upset they are with the president and his comments and how inappropriate this is.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:22.000]  I guess the moral of this story is if you hire gutless, moderate Republicans, don't be surprised when they act like gutless, moderate Republicans.
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  The people who work for the president are doing them a disservice. He deserves better.
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  Mark, thanks for joining us today. People can find you at markdice.com.
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  We're on the march. You're doing a great job at this. Thank you.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:30:01.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:37.000]  mforestore.com, mforeslife.com, our triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9. I cannot tell something unless it helps somebody.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:41.000]  And you can't support an organization that didn't fight harder. Look at the response we're getting.
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:46.000]  They were changed the world together. You are the info war. God bless you all.
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:55.000]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:01.000]  That's right. Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.

[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:15.000]  And let me tell you something. It is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:25.000]  That's what I'm talking about. And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:34.000]  Harvest Right Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:42.000]  Now, that's what I call the miracle of food preservation. Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:59.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:08.000]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:22.000]  In the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war. Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:37.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:46.000]  Anthroplex has turned so many heads today, it's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:23.000]  Welcome back. I'm Roger Stone. I'm here with Gary Heaven, sitting in for Alex Jones. We've got Mark Dice still with us on the line.
[02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:37.000]  We were talking about the faux outrage that has been manifested by the political establishment in this country while they try yet again to undo what was done at the ballot box last November.
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:47.000]  That's what this is really about. There has been, since election day, a consistent effort to destabilize and delegitimize the Trump presidency.
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  Russia didn't work. The Russian collusion, delusion turned out to be a dud. No smoke, no fire, no crime, and no cover-up.
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:11.000]  So now we've now moved back to race-baiting as an attempt to destabilize our president. But you would expect that the president could at least command the loyalty of the men and women that he has appointed to high office.
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  At least command the loyalty of those around him. Joining us now is Alex Jones himself. Alex, welcome to your show.
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:40.000]  I sell receptions. Is that good here? Can you hear me? Yes, indeed. The reason I called in is, I mean, that's from the bottom of my heart. I admire Mark Dice so much. I admire you, Roger, so much. I admire Gary Haven so much.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  And I've never been somebody that's just about openly on air saying how much I admire somebody, but I want everybody to understand something. We are at a total war against pure evil. And I was sitting here having lunch with my family, listening with a mere piece to you guys.
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:35:02.000]  And I had to call in just to say this, that some of us have had our differences, like Mark and I in the past. Both of us were probably wrong. Seven or eight years ago, we were fighting over stupid stuff.
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:13.000]  But now, at a spiritual level, we are up against pure evil that wants to end our free will, totally break up our families and enslave our society. And I just can't help.
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:27.000]  I'm just calling to say this, you know, it sounds cheat-cheesy. A feeling of strong kinship with you guys and strong kinship with black patriots and Hispanic patriots and white patriots and Asian patriots who want free market, who want true justice,
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:37.000]  who want true Western civilization, slash renaissance, slash the best attributes of every culture, and to know we're up against scientific, conscious, evil.
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:46.000]  And I was going to call in just to make the point that what you just said, the Russian narrative was a fraud from the beginning. It's dead. They rode the horse till it were rotten.
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:57.000]  So now they've got the race-based, and we look at it, it's a total hoax because they have nothing, and it just symbolizes how nasty they are. And they're not insane.
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  They are conscious. It's in the WikiLeaks. They said, America's coming together. They want free market. What do we do? And it's top professors advising Hillary, and they say, make them desperate.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  Keep them alone. Break up everything. Make them poor. And rarely in history do you have choices between something so good, this and this new American Revolution,
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:29.000]  and something so bad, pure globalism, that is beyond anything Hitler ever dreamed of, and is literally about bondage and evil and social control and domination.
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  And so this is the maximum push of peer pressure to make weak-minded people turn against Trump, turn against this renaissance. They are all over the news trying to kill the recovery.
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  They are all over the news trying to kill the economy. They are so pissed that people get it, and there's 4 trillion in the stock market, and on all this other great news, 400 billion in new jobs, 1.5 million new jobs.
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  And they keep saying failure, failure. They were kissing at him, like a movie, the media, like snakes kissing, like nothing I've ever seen going, you'll never get shared.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:08.000]  You'll never get shared at best back share. And he finally goes, one person has an infrastructure. He goes, the last question. People want to play that.
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  So it's the last part of the 20-minute press conference. And the guy goes, you didn't get tax cuts, and you didn't get the other stuff, and you didn't get Obamacare appeal.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  You never get it. He's like betting against America, betting against everything, just with executive power.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  He has turned it all around with us, believing and investing and understanding and getting involved. And it's so epic that I cannot believe how real this is.
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  And in our lifetime, we are witnessing such a clear, cut choice, and it's beyond, it's a thousand times one of my football team to win and sudden death overtime, you know, for games I watched.
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  In the bleachers, I mean, I've been at Super Bowl games back when I was like 18 years old, you know, paying $500 a ticket, you know, watching sudden death overtime games.
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  Everything mattered. My team won, and when they did, I thought I was in heaven. This is a thousand times that. This is the real game for my children, your children, and all of us that are in this fight.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  It's so precious what all of us are doing, not to recognize ourselves great, but to realize we are the opposition, and to recognize our listeners, and to recognize how incredibly important this is.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  I see the strength of Roger, I see the strength of Gary, or I see the strength of David Knight, the strength of somebody like Mark Dyson, which is stronger and stronger and stronger.
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  It makes me feel strong, and it's just, it's so good to understand that spiritually, we're not envious, hateful people that we've thrown off the spirit of the world, we're not perfect, and then literally it is the spirit of Christ that is going to defeat the enemy.
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:48.000]  I just feel such kinship to all of you and the listeners that I just wanted to call in and tell you guys how much I love you, and how much I appreciate you, because gosh, we're up against evil.
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  But you know what? We're going to come through this together, and here in that pastor last hour, in his spirit, both pastors, Pastor Pinion and Pastor Brown, this is so real, and you see people bullied by the world, bullied by peer pressure, believing they're on the real team.
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  People in Seattle, 99% come over, tell me they love me, probably 400 people, who I came to go down the street, but I've had three, four people walk over, one out of 100 literally, and go, F.U. Alex Jones, we hate you, and point at me in public when I'm walking down the street with mine, like it hurts me, like their peer pressure hurts me, and I realize they're slaves.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  Thank God we're not like them. Thank God that we're not total slaves that actually care about peer pressure and things. We have an inner compass, an inner compass of justice, not that we're good. We realize we're falling in wicked, but we want to be with God.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  We want to be good, and that's the difference. I just want to say, this is an epic time. We need to pray for justice, pray for truth, come together. I've never been a racist person, but I've been tribal, and I've been sick of people telling me I'm racist, and I've had thoughts that aren't good.
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  But I want to say this. This has helped me transcend completely any classism or racism I had. I'm tired of being brought up in Dallas. I've been told I was racist, told I was bad, physically attacked because who I was, I have transcended it completely because I'm not going to be part of the enemy who claims they're trying to transcend racism when they're the ones pushing.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:24.000]  If we all have souls, we all are made by the Creator, we're all brothers and sisters, and I want everybody to know, no matter what color they are, I love you. I don't even hate Islam except it was created by the evil to oppress people. I love the people. I hate their system of control.
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  And I just want to say I love you guys, and I appreciate you and take over. Sorry, I'm always calling in. I just, the broad guess is so powerful, and the spirit of God being risen up against the enemy as the full spirit of evil rises up for every action or as an opposite equal reaction.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  And we can all feel it. It is so electrical, and we are now all literally that stay the course for truth and justice and say no to the peer pressure. Every level we go up like a game, but it's the real world.
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  Those are facsimiles copying reality. We become even stronger, and it's not a power trip. It's humbling. These evil people are looking for power. They have no idea. They're just tuning into God. There's so much power. You'll be completely humbled.
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  So back to Mark Dyson, you guys, amazing job. It's amazing listening to you, and it's amazing knowing we have Niko and the rest of the great crew that put up with me and so much and worked so hard.
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  Everybody in the whole office, to bring you this transmission, this is truly beautiful, and it's history happening, and I didn't come up with emporers on my own. I just literally was spiritual.
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  This whole fight has been preparing us every way, and every level we go up, God gives us even more strength to face the enemy. And every time we come through, even if we're defeated individually, it's part of a larger plan and know that God is God, not the God of this world, the devil.
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  That's you great American patriots and great humans. I love you guys. I just want to let you know that.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  Thank you, Alex. Now I think it would probably be a terrific time to point out to you that we don't have George Soros writing big checks in the background.
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  We don't get big money from the Ford Foundation or the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  We have to count on you and keep the doors open and to realize the expansion that Alex Jones has in mind. I ask you to go to the Info Wars store now.
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:18.000]  Now, some of you may recently have seen the attack on the Info Wars store by Ben Smith's Buzzfeed.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  By the way, if you're interested in funny cat videos, that is the best place to go.
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  But I want to thank the folks at Buzzfeed because we actually had a substantial uptick in our sales at Info Wars as patriots found us and found these terrific products.
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  No product will go online at the Info Wars store that hasn't been rigorously tested and where we don't have hundreds and in many cases, thousands of testimonials of satisfied patriots.
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  So you've got a $17.76 special now at the store and these prices blow my mind.
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:43:01.000]  Brainforce, by which I would not be able to do this show right now, 55% off $17.76.
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:07.000]  This stuff is terrific in terms of helping you with your focus and to kind of gather your mental energy.
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  Survival Shield X2, again, 55% off at $17.76.
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  Secret 12, 55% off. These are the very best of the best products at the site.
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:27.000]  Silver Bullet, 66% off, only $9.95.
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:34.000]  So do yourself a favor, do us a favor, do the freedom movement a favor.
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  If we're not here, there will be no voice in opposition to what the CNNs and the MSNBCs and the networks are saying.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  So support us with your dollars and we will support you with the truth.
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  Gary?
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:52.000]  Yeah, Mark, we're glad you stayed with us.
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.000]  Alex called in and had to share that with you.
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:02.000]  I'll tell you what, I'm honored to have the words said about me. How do you feel about that?
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:09.000]  It's been an honor to watch Alex's operation grow from just a website back in 2005 when I discovered it.
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:19.000]  That was streaming the radio show to, you know, kind of an early YouTube channel with Alex just broadcasting with a black curtain in the back to now what InfoWars is today.
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:25.000]  A full blown, fully functioning, you know, global media operation with reporters and contributors.
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:33.000]  The best guests, the best reporters I've seen his crew grow over the years and he's got such a great team now.
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:40.000]  So let's face it, they want InfoWars shut down and they want Alex Jones dead or in jail and that's not an exaggeration.
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  And that's why BuzzFeed did some testing on the InfoWars supplements.
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:52.000]  They were hoping to find that they were being falsely advertised, hoping to turn that over to the FDA, hoping to get Alex indicted.
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  And they are trying and hoping, praying to their Lord Lucifer to shut down InfoWars.
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:09.000]  It's important that everybody watch, everybody's back. It's great to be a part of the InfoWars family to see Alex's operation grow from just a small website to what it is today.
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:16.000]  And, you know, it's incredible to see the mainstream media now almost every day attacking Alex.
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:24.000]  So that's when you know that he's doing the right thing is when these liberal comedian propagandists like Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel are attacking him.
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:31.000]  You know then that Alex is doing the right things. You know, it's great to be a part of the team and we have to just keep going.
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:36.000]  And like when you're going to be physically fit, you want to stay healthy. It's not just going to the gym once in a while.
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  You have to do it consistently. You can take a couple days off to recover and relax and, you know, get re-energized.
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:47.000]  We've got to come back into it. And so, Alex, I hope you enjoy your vacation.
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:54.000]  And for all of us, you know, the listeners, the crew, you know, we're all, we must remain in this fight full-time.
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:46:01.000]  We can't do it. We can't cut loose just yet. So it's great to be with you guys. Always good to be a part of the team.
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:09.000]  And I like your gym analogy being the founder of the largest fitness franchise in the world. You're talking my language.
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:16.000]  Mark, thanks for being here. MarkDice.com. Watch his videos, guys. They're great. We appreciate it, Mark. God bless.
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:19.000]  I appreciate you guys. God bless.
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:28.000]  You know what's amazed me, Gary, is the large number of reporters that have contacted me in the last 72 hours asking me the same question over and over again.
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  How badly has the President hurt himself? Don't you think this is the end? How debilitating is this?
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:44.000]  They really don't understand that the President actually just helped himself. He just reinforced for his base that he's not going to be pushed around anymore.
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:53.000]  Let's review exactly what happened. You had this horrific event in Charlottesville, smelling more and more every day like a false flag.
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:47:02.000]  Sure, there may have been a few legitimate Klansmen and neo-Nazis sprinkled around throughout the demonstration,
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  but more and more with the revelations about the Craigslist ad hiring actors and the suspicious background of Jason Kessler, who's a white supremacist who only a few months ago seemed to be a Barack Obama supporter and protesting with Occupy.
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:29.000]  This is beginning to smell very bad, like a put up job, a get prop, a provocation as an attack point for the President.
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  The President comes out immediately and he forcefully denounces bigotry and hatred, but that's not good enough for his critics.
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  He hasn't been specific enough, so the next day he comes out and he denounces white supremacists. Absolutely, white supremacists are evil and they should be denounced.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:48:07.000]  But then when he goes one step further and tells an eternal truth that hate and violence and bigotry are wrong on the left or the right and that black lives matters has vicious thugs who are perpetrating violence,
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:16.000]  well then all of a sudden all hell is broken loose and the President is a racist. This is part and parcel of this simple fact.
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  The President will never please his critics. Nothing he says will be good enough.
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  But the Trump world, Trump America, the people who voted for him, they are stronger now for the President than they have ever been.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  It is reflected in every poll where if you look at those who voted for Hillary Clinton, she's actually lost strength.
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  Many of her voters say they wouldn't do it again, whereas Donald Trump's intensity among Republican primary voters, among Republican voters, higher than it has ever been, higher even than in the closing days of the campaign.
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  Has the President been hurt, Gary? Absolutely not. The President is stronger than ever and he's ready for the struggle.
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  You know, Roger, those are great words. It's interesting. It's like he wants to be liked and you know him quite well.
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:18.000]  I really would encourage him to realize that he ain't going to be liked by these people. So just go ahead and embrace that.
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  Just be a truth teller and be bold. Do you think he's going to finally just throw his hands up and just do and say what he needs to say
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  without trying to have people around him that may garner him some acceptance?
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:40.000]  Yeah, it's very hard for people who have not spent any time with him to understand him. He really is an easygoing good guy.
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  He's funny. He's fun to be with. He uses self-deprecating humor. This is not a guy who's intense. This is a guy who it's great to hang out with.
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:50:00.000]  And yeah, in the beginning he reached out to Al Gore. He reached out to the Reverend Al Sharpton. He posited that maybe Hillary shouldn't be prosecuted for many crimes.
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  He put out the olive branch. What did he get? He got the olive branch slapped out of his hands. I think unfortunately he's going to have to learn the hard way.
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:18.000]  I think now at this point he has learned the hard way. His opponents are intractable. They will never give up until they drive him from office.
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:25.000]  They are not going to drive him from office because we aren't going to allow it.
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  We'll be back in a moment.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  Music
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  Do you trust our economy? How about our banking system? Our president has stated we are sitting on a bubble right now and that when the Fed raises interest rates, bad things are going to happen.
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:51:06.000]  Well, the Fed is raising rates here and now. There has never been a better time to turn your IRA or 401K into physical gold or silver with GSI exchange.

[02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:08.000]  Good afternoon and welcome to Alex Jones in Info Wars. Sitting in for Alex today, Gary Haven and Roger Stone. We've had a great program today, haven't we, Roger?
[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:16.000]  Excellent. Excellent. Great to be here. I echo what Alex says. If there's any guys I want to be in the bunker with, it's you guys.
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:30.000]  We may be in a bunker if the sink continues to heat up. What we've been talking about today is this event this last Saturday, which was a terrible tragedy for the young woman.
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:46.000]  How much more to it than the fake media has talked about. Roger, who is a friend of President Trump, knows that the president has been emboldened by this.
[02:54:46.000 --> 02:55:02.000]  He's done his best to honor the poor woman that died and to speak against the violence. Violence on all sides, by the way. And for that, he's taken great criticism and those of us that still have the ability to think critically.
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:18.000]  Roger, I would say that substance has been sacrificed on the altar of symbolism. And we're now in a situation where anything meaningful is just thrown over symbolism and cast away.
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  We're not able to have an intelligent conversation about the real events. We're being shouted down. The president's being shouted down.
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  That press conference that the president did the other day was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen, the disrespect from the media.
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  But then the courage, he was in their face, pointing his finger, calling them fake news. So I commend his boldness. And I'm ashamed of the media and their disrespect for the president.
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:59.000]  Yeah, I love the way he cuts them off and says, please, wait a minute. They would never treat Barack Obama this way, not in a million years.
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:14.000]  The open disdain, the hatred of the press corps, the working press is just palpable and it's there for everybody to see. I'll think the president made one other key point, which is to say, okay, you want to tear down statues of Robert E. Lee.
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  You want to tear down statues of Jefferson Davis. George Washington was a slave owner. What about the memorials and statues of him? Would we tear those down also?
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  To which one of the leading Black Lives Matters radicals said immediately, yes, absolutely. Not happening.
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:46.000]  Although I've been thinking of trying to find a statue of the well-known racist, bigot, Democrat President Woodrow Wilson. I'd like to help tear that down.
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  This is an absurdity. This is political correctness run amok. And Donald Trump's had enough. He's fed up with it.
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:57:10.000]  And I really think he has re-energized his base and the fault lines here are clear. They're trying to make this another John McCain situation or another Mexico is importing their rapists.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:19.000]  That's when they all said, Trump is done. He's finished. He's going to crash. No, on the contrary, the president, in my opinion, Gary, will only emerge stronger.
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:30.000]  Roger, I hope you're right. My concern is that they, being leftists, the purveyors of chaos, have had a hell of a week.
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:42.000]  I mean, they dominated the media and all of the nighttime comedians have gone after Trump over, as you said, a lack of a couple of words.
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  So they've really gained a lot of power this week. I think they're going to be encouraged. And we're going to see this summer of rage continue and perhaps even escalate.
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  And I tell you, it's so important that people like us who can explain things truthfully, rationally, are having an opportunity to share with the average American who believes in this country the truth so that they can defend our sovereignty and our Constitution and our freedom.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:24.000]  Gary, I couldn't agree with you more and we are here at the tip of the spear. Thank you very much for joining us for the Alex Jones show.
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:41.000]  After being sold out, not a group you developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:51.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[02:58:51.000 --> 02:59:03.000]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:07.000]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:14.000]  Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:17.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:23.000]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:30.000]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:38.000]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:44.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:55.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:55.000 --> 03:00:02.000]  Welcome back. You've got Roger Stone and Gary Hevins sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:21.000]  Without any question, the most momentous, perhaps, week so far of the Trump presidency, those who seek to undermine him, those who paddled on and on about a recount, who wanted to say, well, the popular vote was won by Hillary.
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  And then they wanted a special briefing for the Electoral College about the Russian interference in our election that failed.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:39.000]  This is just the next in the long succession of attempts to undermine the president and undo what was done at the ballot box last year.
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:43.000]  The elites cannot get over the fact that they lost.
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  You would think, given the fact to a certain extent, they have used their superior knowledge of the Washington system to still get many of the things that they want, that they would realize that, as with Ronald Reagan,
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:01:03.000]  they're just going to have to settle in for eight years of a reform agenda that they can only attack on the edges.
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:17.000]  But no, unsatisfied with the fact that globalists now control the Trump State Department under Rex Tillerson, who is essentially, I hate to say it, but the puppet of Condoleezza Rice.
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:32.000]  No, the left is still unsatisfied. They want it all back, and they want to remove our president, either in the short term, through an uprising, which Alex Jones, based on his sources, has been reporting on
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:51.000]  and predicting for months, or by propping up phony crimes, trumped up crimes, if you will, by Mr. Mueller, as a pretext for an impeachment that would take place if the Democrats win the House in 2018.
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  So I think what we see here, Gary, is the left's short term plan to get rid of Trump, their long term plan to get rid of Trump, but one thing is clear.
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:11.000]  They have no interest in compromise or progress or the good of the country. They're only interested in the removal of our president.
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  And Roger, the best offense, let me rephrase that, the best defense is a great offense. I really have been looking for Trump to go on the offense, the Justice Department, for example.
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  When you've got just such an array, the pay to play with the Clinton Foundation, and of course, I have personal experience with how they've stolen, the Clinton's have stolen billions from the poor Haitian people.
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:03:02.000]  You've got the uranium purchase where Hillary is the head of the State Department, approves a sale, and then millions of dollars will funnel back into the Clinton Foundation. That is so obvious.
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:25.000]  I'm frustrated and I'm hoping that the Justice Department will finally get busy and they can overwhelm the news cycle with all of the appropriate charges that this Russian collusion thing will be appropriated to the level it should be, which is nonsense.
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:30.000]  Do you think that we're going to see a Justice Department begin to do its job in this country?
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  Well, I'm hopeful. I must ask you, Gary, I'm not really sure what Jeff Sessions is doing over there. Is he asleep? Perhaps he's asleep.
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  We have now from the FISA court absolute proof that the Obama administration illegally, unconstitutionally, surveilled at least 30,000 Americans. Clapper, Brennan, Rice, Jared, Obama, where are the indictments? Jeff Sessions, somebody wake him up. Where are the indictments? You don't win this game on defense. You're absolutely right.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  Well, I hope that we can encourage the president to order his Justice Department. You know, my concern and I think the only thing that explains it is the deep state has the ability to record everything and what they don't record, they can fabricate.
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:31.000]  Maybe Mr. Sessions is simply afraid that the retaliation is going to be too great for him to step out and do his job.
[03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  Well, I hope Spring's eternal for our attorney general. I hope somebody will wake him up.
[03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:13.000]  It's available at mforestore.com. We also have free shipping. Ordered $50 or more and 10% off. You can sign up for auto ship additionally on top of that. Please.

[03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:20.000]  Ah, yes. Hello everyone. Anthony Kumi here for infowars.com. You know, I come in here every couple of weeks. I love doing this. Come in every two weeks or so. And I always think we've finally reached the pinnacle of insanity in this country.
[03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:35.000]  I thought this weeks ago. And then I come back and there's something else. And I come back again. Got even crazier. I'm like, alright, we've had to have reached the absolute peak of insanity in this country.
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:09:04.000]  Nope. No, we haven't. I have to, I have to believe this now is the peak of insanity. There is a mad Nazi frenzy going on in this country. Oh my God. Speak your peace in defiance of anything that the progressive left has put out there.
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:24.000]  And oh my God, you're now a Nazi. Remember the quaint times when we were racists? Remember just being called a racist and you're like, ah, at first it was like, oh no, I'm a racist. Ah, let's change the discussion now from whatever we were talking about to me defending myself against being called a racist.
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:40.000]  Because, you know, the argument was going much too well. And then racist got to the point where they called everyone a racist. So we finally all just went, all right, all right, I'm a racist. Anyway, here's what I was saying.
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:10:05.000]  Now, ah, we've graduated. We've graduated. Where's our cap and gown? We've gone from racist. Now we're Nazis. We in this country are losing our collective minds. And I just, I'm flabbergasted on a daily basis.
[03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  The president of the United States is being called at the very least a Nazi sympathizer, if not a complete Nazi. In case you didn't know, there's a guy in there called Donald Trump. He's the president.
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:36.000]  Not a different Donald Trump. This is the same Donald Trump we have seen in the public eye for a good, I gotta say, 45 years. Years, people. 45 years. We have seen Donald Trump as a contractor, a builder in New York City.
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  We've seen him battle politicians over real estate and casinos in Atlantic City. I remember this my entire life growing up in New York, seeing Donald Trump as a public figure. Then he goes into showbiz.
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:11:08.000]  He gets himself a reality show and he's on television. He's marrying people. His weddings are our news. All this has happened over the course of a good 45 years that Donald Trump has been in the public eye in this country.
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:22.000]  In all of those years, I have never heard him called a Nazi. A Nazi. We're actually using Nazi here in 2017.
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:39.000]  It never mind like racist and all the other things he's been called. I will give you kind of a womanizer over the course of the years. Man, that guy just loves him some pretty blonde women. I'll give you that.
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:56.000]  I won't give you what they say. He's sexually assaulting people. But I will give you the fact that he does like a pretty girl. In all the years, we've seen this at 70 years old.
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:09.000]  He's decided he's going to become a national socialist. It's so preposterous that it's laughable. It's laughable.
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:28.000]  Of course, we know what happened down there in Charlottesville. We had a group unite the right. They go down there. They're protesting the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue, which is the new rave.
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:46.000]  It's all in vogue now to just get rid of American history. Unite the right goes down there. And of course, Antifa, the darlings of the left, Antifa, the wonderful Nazi killers that they are.
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:58.000]  They go down into them in a little bit. They go down there also to, you know, protest, to peacefully protest things that they don't agree with in this country.
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:06.000]  Because we all have the right to peacefully protest, assemble, speak our mind. It's part of our constitutional right.
[03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:20.000]  Number one, it's the biggie. Number one, freedom of speech and expression, right to assemble, repress all that happy stuff that we say we understand and enjoy in this country.
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:26.000]  And some people are just trying their damnedest to rip it out from under us.
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:46.000]  So these two groups who despise each other go down there and a riot ensues, fights, assaults, a maniac gets in his car, runs people over, killing a young woman, injuring 19 others.
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:58.000]  Donald Trump, our president, Donald Trump, gets on the news immediately and denounces everything that happened. He denounces the racism, the bigotry.
[03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:10.000]  He denounces the violence, the destruction of property, the lawlessness. All of this was denounced. I denounce you. He denounced it.
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:20.000]  Immediately, without any knowledge yet of the principal players, obviously the Nazis aren't fighting each other.
[03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:33.000]  There's got to be someone else there that they're fighting. So he denounced everybody down there that was causing a problem and killing people and assaulting and destroying property.
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  Was that good enough? Was that good enough? Oh, right. No, it wasn't good enough. Not good enough. Why? Because it wasn't concise enough.
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:55.000]  It was vague. No, because Donald Trump said it. Because Donald Trump said it. That's why it wasn't good enough.
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:15:10.000]  So a couple of days later, after all the hoopla in the lying media, he gets back out there and directly denounces the KKK, white supremacy, and Nazis.
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:28.000]  Again, Nazis. I can't believe we're saying Nazis in 2017. So that was good enough, though, right? Wasn't that... Oh, right. No. No, it wasn't good enough.
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:36.000]  Why? Because he didn't include enough people. He included too many people. Oh, that's right, because it's Donald Trump.
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:16:02.000]  Can we all see this? Is it that hard to visualize what's going on here that no matter what this guy does or says, the maniacal, insane, emotional group of children that are the progressive left will absolutely despise anything that comes out of this man's mouth?
[03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:21.000]  Is anybody not seeing this at this point? Because if you're not, I would definitely get checked out. I'd get a CAT scan on my head and see if there's a mass in there that's keeping you from distinguishing things that are right in front of your face.
[03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:36.000]  Because this is what is happening. And then you go to the lying news in their subsequent broadcast to his denouncing these groups, and they actually say he never denounced them.
[03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:56.000]  They actually say that he supports white supremacy and the KKK? What is this? The 30s? A couple of rednecks with the stars and bars on their shirt?
[03:16:56.000 --> 03:17:12.000]  And then guys waving swastika flags? Let me tell you something. I don't think I've seen one of these guys on a soapbox in a town or a city extolling the amazing national socialism.
[03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:25.000]  Little pamphlets. Hi, have I told you about national socialism? Well, let me tell you how it would work here in our society and how it would better everyone's life. Here, take a pamphlet. National socialism was first.
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:44.000]  That would be a Nazi. An idiot waving a swastika flag at another idiot waving a hammer and sickle flag are not Nazis and communists. They're idiots. And they're just there to fight each other.
[03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:59.000]  They're cosplaying. It's like Comic-Con. It's Comic-Con. That's what it is. Comic-Con. They're dressing in costumes and battling each other because they watched Braveheart.
[03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:17.000]  And they want to battle each other with sticks. And the media is getting so carried away with it and telling people that we have a problem in this country with Nazis?
[03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:34.000]  I'll tell you the hardest time I ever had with Nazis in the United States. Playing Castle Wolfenstein. It's one of my favorite video games. Oh, those Nazis are crazy in that game. Crazy! But they're on my computer. It's a video game.
[03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:51.000]  Out in real life, I haven't seen many Nazis. And I haven't seen really many problems with real, I'm talking real Nazis. Not crazy people waving different flags and calling themselves Nazis or communists and Tifa.
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  Alt-right. Whatever labels you want to put on these people that are committing assaults, violence, destruction of property, I don't care what you want to label them. As long as you know what they really are.
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:26.000]  Morons. Morons that are putting giant distractions in the way of advancing what we're doing or trying to do here in the United States of America. Getting people jobs, making our borders secure, keeping people safe from terrorism, internal or external.
[03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:41.000]  But the media, they run on a crazy Nazi frenzy. We'll be back in a matter of moments. Don't you go anywhere. Anthony Kumiya in at infowars.com.
[03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:58.000]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos. Those times may be near. Think about it, our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea. Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:13.000]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long term outages from a single cyber attack. When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency. That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.

[03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:46.000]  Today I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA forces finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:55.000]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for auto ship to receive out of stock products at DNA force. And we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:21:03.000]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game changer like DNA force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:12.000]  The secret behind DNA force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ-10, systematic enzymes, NAR-lipolic acid, BiOPQQ and many others.
[03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:21.000]  BiOPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies. And just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.

[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:59.000]  Wonderful. Thank you, Anthony Kumi, and at Infowars.com. I want to thank Alex Jones for the opportunity. I love doing this program.
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:11.000]  The Antifa. Anti-fascists. That's what it is. I guess the anti is anti and the fa is fascist. They should take the anti off and just call themselves fa.
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:23.000]  Because they are fascists. They really are the definition of what fascism it was, is, and always will be, denying people of their rights.
[03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:35.000]  That's what they do. We've heard Donald Trump get crucified for saying that both sides in Charlottesville were responsible for the violence that happened,
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:46.000]  meaning the Nazis and the Antifa. Well, Antifa has said, hey, we only went there because Nazis were there.
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:57.000]  If they weren't there, there wouldn't have been a fight. Well, the Nazis, the right, the unite the right people got a permit and wanted to march.
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  Antifa came in as agitators. This is how I see it. I don't care what the sides stand for, la, la, la, don't care.
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:12.000]  I'm talking about the basic right to assemble that is God given to every American here in this country.
[03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:16.000]  You have the right to assemble, the right to free speech, the right to protest.
[03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:26.000]  When you have Antifa then swooping in and inciting violence in order to shut this down, there's your problem.
[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:32.000]  And now, for people that don't think that happens, they have done this consistently for quite a while.
[03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:39.000]  Ann Coulter, supposed to speak out at UC Berkeley, shut down because Antifa started violence.
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:54.000]  Milo, Milo Yiannopoulos, supposed to speak on college campuses, shut down because of Antifa violence and destruction of property to deny Milo his right to free speech.
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:28:10.000]  Gavin McInnis at NYU, Antifa shows up, incites violence. They shut it down, denying Gavin McInnis the right to speak and denying the people the right to hear him speak.
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:15.000]  This is their tactic. This is what they do.
[03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:33.000]  So when you look at Charleston and you see this horrific sight, a bunch of Nazis and they got tiki torches and they're marching and they're chanting their slogans that racist, terrible, anti-Semitic.
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:39.000]  Oh my God, you know what? They absolutely have the right to do that.
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:54.000]  I have read so many tweets on Twitter from people that believe, they believe they do not have the right to even speak publicly because they have been deemed Nazis.
[03:28:54.000 --> 03:29:00.000]  What they're saying is hate speech and hate speech has no place in our country.
[03:29:00.000 --> 03:29:03.000]  The First Amendment does not defend hate speech.
[03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:07.000]  Well, first of all, what's the criteria for hate speech? You're the ones making it up.
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:16.000]  You could call anything hate speech and then swoop in and deny people the right that they are given by God Almighty.
[03:29:16.000 --> 03:29:23.000]  It's insane the ignorance that people have of this amazing Constitution of ours.
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:38.000]  Be back in a matter of moments. Don't go anywhere. Anthony, call me in at infowars.com.
[03:29:54.000 --> 03:30:04.000]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[03:30:04.000 --> 03:30:15.000]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep in bare arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Red Coast.
[03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:20.000]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[03:30:20.000 --> 03:30:27.000]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:33.000]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on. It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:39.000]  It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:42.000]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston.
[03:30:42.000 --> 03:30:50.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:30:50.000 --> 03:30:56.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:30:56.000 --> 03:31:05.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure ground-breaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:12.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:12.000 --> 03:31:20.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects to themselves.
[03:31:20.000 --> 03:31:22.000]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:22.000 --> 03:31:26.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:26.000 --> 03:31:30.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:30.000 --> 03:31:37.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:37.000 --> 03:32:01.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then FullWarStore.com.
[03:32:07.000 --> 03:32:09.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:32:09.000 --> 03:32:13.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[03:32:13.000 --> 03:32:19.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:28.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[03:32:28.000 --> 03:32:36.000]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:32:36.000 --> 03:32:39.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[03:32:39.000 --> 03:32:49.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and in FullWarsLife.com.
[03:32:49.000 --> 03:32:56.000]  News, analysis, reports. It's the Alex Jones show.
[03:32:56.000 --> 03:33:02.000]  And now your host, Anthony Kumia.
[03:33:02.000 --> 03:33:08.000]  Thank you. Thank you, Anthony Kumia and Infowars.com.
[03:33:08.000 --> 03:33:16.000]  Oh my God, the whole hubbub about what happened down there in Charlottesville.
[03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:24.000]  It started because of the statues, the removal of Confederate war monuments.
[03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:34.000]  Yeah, the Confederates in the Civil War, their monuments need to be taken down. That's what some people are saying.
[03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:42.000]  And that seems to be the crux of this whole thing. People go down to defend the statues.
[03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:47.000]  And other people come down because they don't want the statues there, they want them removed, so they battle.
[03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:57.000]  And we've seen scenes like this here. This is old Johnny Reb in memory of all the Confederate soldiers that were killed during the Civil War.
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:34:08.000]  And there they go. This is so Lord of the Flies, just this frenzy of hate.
[03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:19.000]  It's really ISIS-like, ripping down monuments, stepping on it, getting rid of history, the history of this country, good, bad or indifferent.
[03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:29.000]  It is the history of this country. And monuments are there to commemorate, not necessarily glorify, but to remind us,
[03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:37.000]  a constant reminder of things we went through during our history to get where we are right now.
[03:34:37.000 --> 03:34:44.000]  I honestly believe these commemorations are very important to this country.
[03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:54.000]  And we need to remember where we came from, the good of it and the bad of it in order to keep moving forward in a good direction
[03:34:54.000 --> 03:34:57.000]  and make this country as good as we can make it.
[03:34:57.000 --> 03:35:02.000]  But some people see them as hate statues.
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:09.000]  Oh my God, they must be eliminated. I don't want to see it. Don't let me see it.
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:17.000]  It's astounding how sensitive the left can be when it comes to people just speaking.
[03:35:17.000 --> 03:35:24.000]  Pictures, things they see in movies and TV, they get triggered so easily.
[03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:33.000]  And these monuments, you look at it, all of a sudden I'm walking in Washington, D.C., I turn my head, oh my God, take it away.
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:39.000]  They lose their minds and need them removed from their sight.
[03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:43.000]  Is that a good thing? Does that make sense?
[03:35:43.000 --> 03:35:49.000]  I submit to you, no. I think it's mental. I think it's crazy.
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:57.000]  These are a few stories I found today alone, just in a few minutes.
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:36:01.000]  Because the frenzy is on. The frenzy is on.
[03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:09.000]  Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson Honors, pulled from New York City Church and colleges Hall of Fame,
[03:36:09.000 --> 03:36:14.000]  bust of Confederate generals to come down at Bronx Community College.
[03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:20.000]  Canadian retailer removes Confederate plaque from Montreal flagship store.
[03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:27.000]  Canadians? A Facebook Bands White Nationalist over hate speech.
[03:36:27.000 --> 03:36:34.000]  Antifa, the entire state of Virginia is named after a slave trader.
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  I kid you not, they apparently want the entire state of Virginia renamed.
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:44.000]  Because it's racist.
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:50.000]  Leader of Boston Group calls for renaming of Faneuil Hall.
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:59.000]  The iconic Faneuil Hall of Boston, Massachusetts, they want that renamed now,
[03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:08.000]  because I guess Faneuil was some type of racist or slave trader or what have you, back in the 1700s.
[03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:14.000]  So now, in 2017, we have to change the name.
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:20.000]  Apple denounces neo-Nazi as Spotify Bands White Power Tracks.
[03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:27.000]  De Blasio, that's our lovely mayor here in New York, plans to take down New York City's hate symbols.
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:31.000]  And then this one. And by the way, this is just this morning.
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:33.000]  I just rattled through and found a few.
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:41.000]  I'm sure I missed hundreds more around the country where these people want all these monuments and whatnot removed.
[03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:54.000]  Hamilton Star, you know, that amazing Broadway musical, Hamilton, about Alexander Hamilton, you know, played by black people.
[03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:59.000]  I swear to you, I wouldn't kid. It's astounding.
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:05.000]  We hear no cries of cultural appropriation when that happens.
[03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:11.000]  But if a girl wears hoop earrings, apparently she might as well be a slave owner.
[03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:22.000]  Actor Leslie Odom Jr. says public statues should not be erected to inspire, they should be erected to inspire us to teach us and give us hope.
[03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:28.000]  But if they no longer do so, communities can decide that they don't want them anymore. Communities can decide?
[03:38:28.000 --> 03:38:36.000]  Communities or a few hundred rabble rousers that want their way or no way.
[03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:41.000]  Even when it comes to statues of America's founding fathers.
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:46.000]  Leslie Odom Jr. open to removal of Washington and Jefferson statues.
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:55.000]  Yes, people. Yes. The things we were just moments ago joking about are coming to fruition.
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:39:01.000]  We joked about perhaps having to dynamite Mount Rushmore.
[03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:12.000]  Because some of the faces on there are people that, oh boy, I don't know, racists, slave traders and whatnot.
[03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:18.000]  So we were joking about this, but they're serious.
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:28.000]  They're absolutely serious about eliminating any sign of the people that built this country.
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:38.000]  That came up with the rules and laws that we call the Constitution, the protection of our rights.
[03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:46.000]  All those people were so evil that we need to remove every indication that they ever existed.
[03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:51.000]  Does that sound good to you? It does sound very good to me.
[03:39:51.000 --> 03:40:00.000]  I know damn well they will not stop. This isn't something that people stop doing.
[03:40:00.000 --> 03:40:05.000]  You never hear of an organization, regardless of their platform, that goes,
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:11.000]  well, did you see this, Bob? They just gave in to our intimidation.
[03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:18.000]  Oh, good. All right, pack everything up. We're done here. Sell the place. Sell our stationery with our letterhead on top,
[03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:26.000]  because our mission is done here. It never happens. They absolutely go, what can we screw up next?
[03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:29.000]  We got them on the run. Let's come up with something else.
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:34.000]  If you appease these people, they go to the next thing, and the next thing,
[03:40:34.000 --> 03:40:41.000]  until everything you find you cherish is gone.
[03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:46.000]  And then you go, what happened? What happened to everything? They will not stop.
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:58.000]  These statues, it's a symptom. It's a symptom of the hatred of our society and what made this country great.
[03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:06.000]  A sense of pride in our nation, morality, ethics, family,
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:14.000]  all the things that made this country amazing over the course of the 200 and some odd years that we've been here,
[03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:21.000]  are bad now and need to be removed. It's gotten insane.
[03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:29.000]  So I came up with a few things last night, I think, that I think are appropriate.
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:37.000]  There's a statue. There are a few monuments in this country. As we speak, monuments in this country to a man
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:45.000]  that was directly responsible for killing 268 American soldiers.
[03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:51.000]  And there are statues and monuments to this man in this country.
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:57.000]  And no one is trying to have that taken down. And I'm not talking Confederate soldiers.
[03:41:57.000 --> 03:42:05.000]  I'm talking statues and monuments to a man that was directly responsible for killing 268 American soldiers.
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:10.000]  And you can find monuments to this man. His name, Sitting Bull.
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:24.000]  You might remember him. He was responsible for the little big horn battle with George Armstrong Custer,
[03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:32.000]  Custer's last stand, wiped out 268 men, including the old general himself.
[03:42:32.000 --> 03:42:39.000]  We were at war with the Indian nation. Just like people say we were at war with the Confederates.
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:42.000]  Why do we have his statue? Why do we have Confederate statues?
[03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:50.000]  We're at war with the Indians. During a battle, American soldiers were killed by this man we were at war with.
[03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:56.000]  Why, then, is there a statue of Sitting Bull, a guy that fought America?
[03:42:56.000 --> 03:43:00.000]  There it is. There is Tatanka, Sitting Bull.
[03:43:00.000 --> 03:43:06.000]  And there are amazing carvings of his face on mountain sides and whatnot.
[03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:13.000]  And no one clamoring to have that taken down. No one clamoring. Why?
[03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:18.000]  Oh, why am I asking why? Of course I know why. Stop.
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:23.000]  Because he's not white. That must be it. It's the only thing I could think of.
[03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:31.000]  Falls into the same criteria as any Confederate soldier would at the time at war with the U.S.
[03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:36.000]  But for some reason, we'll keep that up there.
[03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:43.000]  I've also heard, hey, these statues, we should take them and put them in a museum.
[03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:48.000]  Put them in a museum where people could see them without them being glorified outside.
[03:43:48.000 --> 03:43:55.000]  Let me tell you something. I think where a statue is, when it was placed, what it says, how it's posed,
[03:43:55.000 --> 03:44:01.000]  when it was put there, why it was put where it is, all of that is in context.
[03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:06.000]  And if you want to actually learn about something and get some knowledge as to our history
[03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:11.000]  and why this guy is even a statue and what, that's how you should do it.
[03:44:11.000 --> 03:44:18.000]  You should be able to interpret it yourself in why it was placed there.
[03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:23.000]  It's not all of a sudden, you don't walk up to a Confederate war statue and go, oh, cool.
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:30.000]  I'm now a Confederate. It's to educate. These things are artwork.
[03:44:30.000 --> 03:44:37.000]  They're works of art. Somebody's expression. Someone's interpretation of a moment in history.
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:41.000]  And you always hear the progressives trying to defend their artwork.
[03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:46.000]  Remember Pisschrist? A crucifix upside down in a jar of urine.
[03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:51.000]  And the defense from the left that came out defending that.
[03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:55.000]  They're works of art. I defy anybody to tell me different.
[03:44:55.000 --> 03:45:02.000]  And put them in a museum. Why? So they could then be put in the context to leave had a great line.
[03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:07.000]  He goes, yeah, you'd walk in and it would just say museum of hate, museum of hate.
[03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:17.000]  And you'd walk in with already this bias of what this is with someone else's interpretation of what these statues are about.
[03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:22.000]  Someone else's narrative of why they're in this museum.
[03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:33.000]  Instead of you being given the opportunity to interpret for yourself what these works of art are around our country.
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:44.000]  But again, the worst thing the left can ever believe, think or see are people making up their own minds.
[03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:58.000]  Are people listening to other people speak giving a debate and then coming out with some kind of conclusion based on mutual respect and dialogue.
[03:45:58.000 --> 03:46:08.000]  Oh, the left hates that. They want to tell you what you should or shouldn't see, hear or say.
[03:46:08.000 --> 03:46:13.000]  We're living in a country right now that is under such a cloud of fear.
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:22.000]  I have never seen people more petrified at speaking out on on issues that we see in the news every day.
[03:46:22.000 --> 03:46:31.000]  Could you imagine like I can't imagine because I have this awesome job, but I can't imagine going to an office.
[03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:40.000]  Sitting with my colleagues and not being able to discuss my point of view on things like Charlottesville.
[03:46:40.000 --> 03:46:45.000]  Things like the statues being taken down, Trump's policies, immigration.
[03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:56.000]  Imagine all day you got to keep that bottled up because you're afraid someone's going to hear you and run to HR and now you're fired because of your ideology.
[03:46:56.000 --> 03:47:02.000]  Anthony, that can't possibly happen. We live in America.
[03:47:02.000 --> 03:47:12.000]  Oh, yeah. Tell that guy at Google. Tell that gentleman that decided he was going to put his thoughts to paper, virtual paper.
[03:47:12.000 --> 03:47:17.000]  Mind you, it is 2017. We don't have flying cars, but we do have virtual paper.
[03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:30.000]  Put his thoughts to paper and say, hey, in my experience in this job, I have found this to be true of men and women in my occupation.
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:34.000]  Here's my opinion written down. I hope you enjoy it.
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:41.000]  Next thing we see, he's got the box with his plant and his nameplate and he's like, what?
[03:47:41.000 --> 03:47:45.000]  But I was just explaining.
[03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:55.000]  I have a job in this industry. I think I'm qualified to have an opinion about, yep, you are sexist.
[03:47:55.000 --> 03:47:58.000]  You are obsolete.
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:04.000]  We have ventured so far into the Twilight Zone.
[03:48:04.000 --> 03:48:07.000]  I don't know if there's any way back.
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:17.000]  Like I said, I enjoy the hell out of coming here on a biweekly basis to rant and rave.
[03:48:17.000 --> 03:48:22.000]  But every time I come back, it's gotten crazier.
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:25.000]  It's just gotten crazier.
[03:48:25.000 --> 03:48:29.000]  So where does it end? Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?
[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:35.000]  I thought with the election of Donald Trump, we would start seeing that pendulum swing back.
[03:48:35.000 --> 03:48:42.000]  But the progressives, I love that word, progressives, it's as if we're progressing.
[03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:47.000]  If it's such great wordplay, they progress things.
[03:48:47.000 --> 03:48:51.000]  They're progressive, open, open to different ideology.
[03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:57.000]  Really, are you? But they've gotten worse.
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:48:59.000]  They've gotten worse.
[03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:02.000]  They won't let this president do anything he wants to do.
[03:49:02.000 --> 03:49:07.000]  Whatever he says is poison coming out of his mouth.
[03:49:07.000 --> 03:49:16.000]  We can see and we have seen unemployment go down to record levels in probably almost, what, 20 years?
[03:49:16.000 --> 03:49:18.000]  15, 20 years?
[03:49:18.000 --> 03:49:22.000]  We've also seen the stock market in record territory.
[03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:27.000]  We've seen people confident in small businesses, hiring people.
[03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:31.000]  There is an element of pride coming back.
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:34.000]  We saw what he did in North Korea.
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:36.000]  Why isn't the news talking about that?
[03:49:36.000 --> 03:49:43.000]  When they were all over Donald Trump about his tough talk to Kim Jong-un,
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:47.000]  we heard, this is terrible. It's going to get us into a war.
[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:50.000]  Why would a president talk like this?
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:55.000]  Kim Jong-un actually comes out and tells everyone,
[03:49:55.000 --> 03:49:58.000]  hey, yeah, I'm not going to do that whole Guam thing.
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:01.000]  Yeah, I'm going to kind of lay off on that.
[03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:03.000]  What do you think did that?
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:09.000]  The policies of decades of appeasing this maniac with money?
[03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:15.000]  No, tough talk, pride in nation, strength in your nation.
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:20.000]  You won't hear a peep from the media giving anything to Donald Trump
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:25.000]  about him standing down on that whole issue.
[03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:30.000]  It's so obvious I'm dumbfounded when people don't see it.
[03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:34.000]  They're staring right at it. They have sight, yet they do not see.
[03:50:34.000 --> 03:50:37.000]  Anthony Kumi at infowars.com will be right back.
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:47.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:51:07.000 --> 03:51:10.000]  It was meant to be a harmless process, peroxide.
[03:51:10.000 --> 03:51:15.000]  Extendivite 7 herbs has a job to strengthen the organs and circulatory highway.

[03:54:34.000 --> 03:54:41.000]  and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand selected for their oral health benefits.

[03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:35.000]  Oh my goodness, something's happening today quickly. Radio personality suspended without pay amid controversy.
[03:55:35.000 --> 03:55:50.000]  A radio personality from WHLM, he went to the rally down there in Charlottesville and posted a video of neo-Nazis marching with tiki torches,
[03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:57.000]  and apparently on his Twitter page he supported the alt-right, so he got fired. Well, he's suspended.
[03:55:57.000 --> 03:56:03.000]  By the way, I've been in broadcasting so many years. Let me fill you in on a little secret.
[03:56:03.000 --> 03:56:12.000]  Suspension means fired, fired, so fired. We're going to suspend him until the internal investigation,
[03:56:12.000 --> 03:56:18.000]  when we will deem if they're already going, oh, pack your bags. So fired.
[03:56:18.000 --> 03:56:25.000]  So this guy went somewhere and took a video and fired, fired, so fired.
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:34.000]  How about this? Georgia Judge suspended for comparing removal of Confederate monuments to ISIS actions.
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:46.000]  I think a lot of people, when they saw the statue of Johnny Reb being taken down by Vandals, there it is,
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:59.000]  I think a lot of people made that kind of comparison to ISIS. We have seen ISIS knocking down Christian monuments in the Middle East
[03:56:59.000 --> 03:57:08.000]  and stomping on them, knocking down tombstones, anything that isn't Islamic, they come through like locusts.
[03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:19.000]  And it was very similar to watch, but just saying it, just saying it, and a judge gets suspended.
[03:57:19.000 --> 03:57:30.000]  This is America. This is the leftist version of the United States of America, where you are not allowed to speak your mind.
[03:57:30.000 --> 03:57:42.000]  You are not allowed to have an opinion that varies from the left, because the second you do, they will find a way to get you fired,
[03:57:42.000 --> 03:57:48.000]  sully your reputation, that's what they do.
[03:57:48.000 --> 03:58:01.000]  Airbnb is saying that they are going to fight anybody that they consider a Nazi from using any of their properties.
[03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:04.000]  Do they do this for Black Lives Matter? Do they do this for Antifa?
[03:58:04.000 --> 03:58:11.000]  And Apple, of course, announces neo-Nazis as Spotify bands, white power tracks. I don't even know what that is.
[03:58:11.000 --> 03:58:19.000]  Thanks for joining me, Anthony Comea, here at Infowars.com. We'll see you in a couple of Thursdays. Have a pleasant rest of your day.
