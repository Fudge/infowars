[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:19.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:19.000 --> 00:37.000]  welcome. It is already the 1st of May, 2008. We've got George Humphrey, economist, successful
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  businessman, former Austin City Council member, author, documentary filmmaker, anti-new-world
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  recruiter, crusader, joining us in one hour and 30 minutes for an hour in studio. George
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  Homebase is in Austin, but he's gone half the year, so when we've got him in town, we want
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.000]  to go ahead and bring him in as much as possible. So he'll be jumping in to talk about some of
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  the current events and things that are happening with us in an hour and a half. Tim Ball, top
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  scientist, climatologist, expert on water. What's really happening with water globally?
[01:08.000 --> 01:16.000]  And in short supply, both salt and fresh water. Very important information coming up in two
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  hours and 30 minutes from now. And then, for the last hour and a half of the four-hour
[01:23.000 --> 01:30.000]  transmission, Professor Michael Chasodowski will join us to break down all the indicators.
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.000]  Are the globalist, the global crime syndicate, are they planning to attack Iran? Is that really
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.000]  in the offing? And what does he think of the three presidential candidates? What does he think
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.000]  about this particular dog and pony show? I mean, to see our movement sucked into placing bats
[01:47.000 --> 01:55.000]  on three ponies in a rigged race here when they're all bought and paid for by the same
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.000]  individuals, it's really comical. But we will look at that a little bit coming up with
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  Professor Chasodowski in the last hour and a half of this worldwide broadcast today.
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  So in an hour and a half, we have George Humphrey, and coming up in two and a half hours, we
[02:12.000 --> 02:21.000]  have Tim Ball, and then we have Michelle Chasodowski joining us from Canada. Now, let me get into
[02:21.000 --> 02:27.000]  the news. In the next hour and a half, I am going to cover the news on this broadcast.
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  You can read everything that we're about to cover or link through to the stories, government
[02:32.000 --> 02:48.000]  legislation documents, at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com are two twin flagship websites.
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  You can also visit our auxiliary websites, which are also excellent, have a lot of their
[02:54.000 --> 03:03.000]  own original news, truthnews.us, infowars.net, jonesreport.com, Ron Paul, warroom.com. I
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  know I'm forgetting some, but they're all excellent. Okay, here is some of the news I have in front
[03:10.000 --> 03:18.000]  of me today. Elidas Blueprint for World Government revealed, one of the former heads of Kissinger
[03:18.000 --> 03:25.000]  and Associates has written the book Super Class, a fawning in your face declaration of war
[03:25.000 --> 03:31.000]  on humanity and freedom. Super Class, the global power elite and the world they are
[03:31.000 --> 03:38.000]  making, and it's by David Rothkoff, and he says in here, they're going to take over the
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  internet, just exactly as I told you, I'm only reading their published documents. Again,
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.000]  I'm not special. I'm not smart. Everyone will marvel. I told you six years ago exactly how
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  they're going to shut the web down. They're now beginning that operation. He says you'll
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  have no free speech. He says there'll be a global police state to control you and your
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  family so you can't struggle, and he lasts directly at you. And salon.com is reporting
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  on it, fawning and worshiping. And Paul Watson has written a detailed story where in your
[04:09.000 --> 04:17.000]  face, he explains that they rule and that the United States and every other nation is
[04:17.000 --> 04:26.000]  already basically gone and that all power is in their hands. And he says that they're
[04:26.000 --> 04:33.000]  going to use the militarized police. He doesn't even claim it's to fight real terror to
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.000]  basically knock your teeth out. You want to live in bondage? He says you're going to.
[04:41.000 --> 04:50.000]  And this ninny chicken neck has armies of militarized police that will do whatever he
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  says. We'll be right back.
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[04:59.000 --> 05:04.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by powerful world government.
[05:04.000 --> 05:10.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new
[05:15.000 --> 05:23.000]  world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  and you will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  They're after power. That's their affidavit.

[05:59.000 --> 06:02.000]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[06:02.000 --> 06:07.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[06:07.000 --> 06:11.000]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[06:11.000 --> 06:17.000]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[08:45.000 --> 08:50.000]  But then whenever we have a guest in studio multiple times weekly, we also fire it up.
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.000]  The G. Edward Griffin video, the hour and a half interview we have with him, just amazing.
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.000]  And by the way, that's up on YouTube now. It's obviously in higher quality for prisonplanet.tv members.
[09:01.000 --> 09:10.000]  But we hope everybody goes and checks out the YouTube video of that just to get a look at the amazing quality of how the video is coming out.
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  Okay, here's the news I have. Some of the news I want to cover.
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  Alita's blueprint for world government revealed. New book superclass says that they're going to have a police state and we're going to have no freedom
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  and that it's a global dictatorship by a technocracy working for the Rockefellers.
[09:25.000 --> 09:34.000]  So just stated, open, guys giving interviews and it's just, yeah, shut up. We rule you.
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.000]  And they even laugh. They say, look at the general public. They can't even understand what I'm saying right now.
[09:39.000 --> 09:46.000]  I mean, they openly say to people that are aware of them, well, what do you expect? The public's brainwashed, brain dead idiots. We rule.
[09:46.000 --> 09:53.000]  Look, try to warn them. Look at them. They don't even listen to you.
[09:53.000 --> 10:00.000]  I'm so tired of being on radio interviews and they go, Mr. Jones, believe there's elite groups and that they're setting up a world government
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  and they all just laugh and I've got hundreds of C-SPAN newscast and hundreds of thousands of books really written by the people
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  and all their documents and all their statements and you try to show it to the yuppies and they just kind of laugh.
[10:12.000 --> 10:21.000]  No one's over me. I rule everything. There's no electronic voting machine fraud. There's no problem. The dollar's not devalued. Just shut up.
[10:21.000 --> 10:27.000]  Well, that was two years ago, three years ago you were saying that. Now you're not, but you're saying, oh, it's being devalued,
[10:27.000 --> 10:33.000]  but don't worry, the bankers are going to fix it. They have a plan, yes, to make it even worse.
[10:33.000 --> 10:40.000]  Oh, it doesn't matter. You'll just have to have everything you have taken, don't you? That's what it has to happen.
[10:40.000 --> 10:47.000]  And still you won't care. So, okay, fine. You win. You get what you want. You get to be a slave.
[10:47.000 --> 10:54.000]  But there is a minority of us that don't want to be slaves and don't want to be poisoned and have eugenics operations carried out against us
[10:54.000 --> 11:01.000]  and who aren't cynical and think that life is nothing but a joke. No, you and I, we've been through that and this is not our game.
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  So let us stop talking falsely now. The hour's getting late.
[11:06.000 --> 11:13.000]  So this scumbag, elitist blueprint for world government reveal. We'll cover that. Elitist blueprint for world government reveal.
[11:13.000 --> 11:21.000]  Bush planning to attack Iran this year. Ray McGovern, a prominent former CIA analyst to Reagan and Bush senior, their top analyst as U.S. president towards Bush.
[11:21.000 --> 11:34.000]  He's planning to wage a military attack on Iran this year. Also, the environmentalists are now saying, I'm not kidding, cut down trees to save the earth that they're creating carbon dioxide.
[11:34.000 --> 11:48.000]  You cannot make this insanity up. They now want to put out millions of vacuum cleaners the size of phone booths to suck up carbon dioxide at a cost of 5.6 trillion.
[11:48.000 --> 11:57.000]  And they've got everyone convinced that it's a deadly toxic waste and now they're saying cut down trees. You cannot make it up.
[11:57.000 --> 12:06.000]  We're going to cover that. These people, it's just, oh my God. I mean, the establishment knows they're taxing the life gas, the main base life gas.
[12:06.000 --> 12:13.000]  Oxygen is secondary to life on the planet. Life would go on. Plant life without oxygen. It wasn't here first.
[12:13.000 --> 12:27.000]  But without CO2, it's all over and they know that so they can tax it and have their little mindless followers believe anything.
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  This is out of the Detroit Free Press.
[12:32.000 --> 12:46.000]  Dads had his son taken because just wait till we read this article. Boy kidnapped by CPS for accidental hard cider order.
[12:46.000 --> 12:56.000]  They were at the baseball game and the, that doesn't matter. I'll get to it later. It just gets me so upset I can hardly talk.
[12:56.000 --> 13:05.000]  Economist coming. Economic shocks could spark depression. That's mainstream news. We'll be playing a clip of that.
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  Big business, big winner at security and prosperity partnership, North American Union meeting.
[13:10.000 --> 13:18.000]  BBC shows engages in chaotic, rambling 9-11 truth debunk fest.
[13:18.000 --> 13:28.000]  UN official again calls for study of neocons role in 9-11 attacks.
[13:28.000 --> 13:38.000]  That is just some of what we have. We have White House officials defending secretly paid propagandist on the news by the Pentagon saying it's absolutely appropriate.
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.000]  But it was done secretly and they held out that they were not on the payroll. You guys are something else.
[13:44.000 --> 13:50.000]  Secret wiretap warrants double since 9-11. Non-terror related of course.
[13:50.000 --> 13:57.000]  FDA report shows quote problems at Merck vaccine plant. This is out of the Philadelphia news. Then you read the problems.
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  Yeah, suck the pain off your house. Give you a permanent orange afro.
[14:01.000 --> 14:09.000]  Military propaganda pushed me off TV. Another report getting into the fake propaganda on news.
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  So a new Florida law would grant cops right to impound cars playing loud music.
[14:14.000 --> 14:23.000]  And that ties into this. You got the people walking around saying lemonade, lemonade, beer, drinks.
[14:23.000 --> 14:30.000]  Yeah, I'll take a Coke and one of those lemonade. And of course the little spy was there to watch.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  And as soon as the top was cracked and as soon as the boy took one drink, police were there in minutes.
[14:35.000 --> 14:42.000]  Child was taken freaking out and just, you know, just, just, just understand when I say there's spies everywhere,
[14:42.000 --> 14:49.000]  little tattletales, scum, fluoride brains. When they do autopsies on the little rod holes on their brains,
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  they're mentally retarded. Just all they know is tattle, call police.
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  They just want to have somebody in a uniform, tell them good job. They just want to direct someone.
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.000]  And they're just everywhere spying constantly, constantly watching.
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  I mean, you put your kids in the car. It could be below zero winner.
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.000]  You jump out of the car to run to your mailbox 10 feet. You're going to have police come to your house.
[15:13.000 --> 15:19.000]  The old lady's looking up the window. She watches the CPS glorification shows. She's going to call the police.
[15:19.000 --> 15:28.000]  You pull up at Walmart in Chicago and it's, you know, below zero. There's teenage kids in the car.
[15:28.000 --> 15:35.000]  There's a two year old in the back seat and you jump out, lock the car with your key, walk 10 feet,
[15:35.000 --> 15:41.000]  throw $8 and change into the Salvation Army. You will be arrested within seconds.
[15:41.000 --> 15:49.000]  Your child will be taken and you will be prosecuted.
[15:49.000 --> 16:00.000]  Everything. One chicken dies. You don't notify the government within 24 hours. You don't pay for the $10 tag on a $3 chicken.
[16:00.000 --> 16:08.000]  $1,000 a day fines. They're going to take your property, but the big chicken factories, they don't have any of the regulations on them.
[16:08.000 --> 16:20.000]  Just total control. A battery falls out of a toy in your backyard. Five years in prison. Inspectors in your backyard without warrants.
[16:20.000 --> 16:28.000]  Millions and millions of new guilds of quasi police everywhere. Total domination.
[16:28.000 --> 16:36.000]  I'm not joking. This is the stated plan. Do nothing, dumb down, lazy scum.
[16:36.000 --> 16:44.000]  So there's not going to be any real jobs anymore. And so it's going to be you in the prison or you being the slave or you doing community service every day
[16:44.000 --> 16:53.000]  because you've got so many violations. Everything you do surveilled, nothing but stupid, stumbling, nobodies who would have been nothing in life,
[16:53.000 --> 17:03.000]  who can't even clean toilets or change a tire, stomping around in black uniforms, ordering you around, watching your every move.
[17:03.000 --> 17:16.000]  Just waiting. White glove inspection. The entire world, a giant surveillance prison where everything you do is criminal so they can get you in the system.
[17:16.000 --> 17:29.000]  You think I'm joking? The degenerate David Rothkopf is openly saying this in his book.
[17:29.000 --> 17:40.000]  Remember the good old days and over 300,000 cops and if your house got robbed, your car got robbed, they'd come out or if you got mugged,
[17:40.000 --> 17:49.000]  the police would come and take it serious. You get mugged now, they don't come. Your car gets robbed, they don't come 9 times out of 10.
[17:49.000 --> 17:59.000]  Now they're not writing tickets. They're not doing paperwork. You get 2 million cops and you get mugged, nothing happens.
[17:59.000 --> 18:07.000]  But your child takes one sip of hard lemonade and they're gone.
[18:07.000 --> 18:14.000]  Doesn't matter if you're a top archaeologist, one of the top archaeologists in the United States who doesn't drink,
[18:14.000 --> 18:21.000]  who has no criminal record, doesn't even have speeding tickets. Doesn't matter. They didn't tell you it was alcoholic.
[18:21.000 --> 18:31.000]  They say you should have known. You should have read the label. You should have known, boy.
[18:31.000 --> 18:39.000]  We'll cover that article later and I see these stories every single day.
[18:39.000 --> 18:47.000]  First, we're going to confiscate your car under asset forage and seizure if you got drugs in it.
[18:47.000 --> 18:55.000]  Then it's, oh, you just got cash, no drugs, no cash, no judge, no jury, no arrest, no nothing. We just take it.
[18:55.000 --> 19:06.000]  That's admitted. Highway robbery, it's all it is, bandits. Cops ought to start to do that. I'll start wearing bandit mask.
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.000]  I guess they do wear black ski mask, so no big deal.
[19:10.000 --> 19:18.000]  And then it's, oh, if you solicit a prostitute, you know, you pull up at a red light and this good-looking woman says,
[19:18.000 --> 19:24.000]  hey, baby, you want to have some fun and you're weak and make a mistake or say, yeah, get in the car or, hey, well, you know,
[19:24.000 --> 19:30.000]  you want to go out on a date? Not defending that. The point is your car's gone. Your name's in the paper.
[19:30.000 --> 19:39.000]  But see, that's not enough. Now you're playing loud music. We're going to seize your car all under admiralty.
[19:39.000 --> 19:54.000]  Don't worry, though. You don't win, police. Your masters have already implanted you with your death. You think you win, you lose.
[19:54.000 --> 20:01.000]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments? Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods,
[20:01.000 --> 20:07.000]  you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[20:07.000 --> 20:15.000]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[20:15.000 --> 20:24.000]  But now it's cancer's turn to die with laced med inks, patented methodology. Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,

[20:54.000 --> 20:59.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[20:59.000 --> 21:04.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group. Could their objective be world domination?
[21:09.000 --> 21:15.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[21:15.000 --> 21:22.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[21:35.000 --> 21:39.000]  They have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[23:44.000 --> 23:53.000]  We're in a no-holds bar information war. Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[24:14.000 --> 24:27.000]  Okay, we're back live here. Let me just get into this article right now. Because this isn't just about the police or the corrupt semi-laws.
[24:27.000 --> 24:41.000]  It isn't just about the destruction of due process or people not being reasonable. It is about a population, a large segment of the population that loves tattling, loves reporting, loves making things up,
[24:41.000 --> 24:52.000]  loves ruining people's lives, and then it's about a system of police, doctors, nurses who love persecuting people.
[24:52.000 --> 25:05.000]  This is out of the Detroit Free Press. Hard lemonade, hard price. So before I read this, I remember when this first came out four or five years ago,
[25:05.000 --> 25:14.000]  I have a vague memory of being at a party, and I remember, I didn't want to drink, so there was a big tub of soft drinks, and I pulled one out.
[25:14.000 --> 25:20.000]  They had like a black label and a yellow lemon on it. I thought, oh, lemonade. And I pop it open and drink, and I go, oh, that tastes bad.
[25:20.000 --> 25:29.000]  And then I read, oh, it's got alcohol in it. You know, 5% alcohol. It's like a beer. And I remember throwing it away.
[25:29.000 --> 25:37.000]  And, but that doesn't matter. I mean, right here in Texas, I don't know if they changed the law, but if your parents want to give you beer at a restaurant,
[25:37.000 --> 25:44.000]  at least they could in the past. In Italy, in Europe, they have beer out of vending machines. You know, kids drink water, down, wine, and beer,
[25:44.000 --> 25:53.000]  and they actually have less alcoholism now. Kind of like Amsterdam has less drug use because the drugs are legal and it's looked down upon.
[25:53.000 --> 26:01.000]  And only the idiot Americans come and use it because they think they're getting away with something. But hard lemonade, hard price.
[26:01.000 --> 26:09.000]  Dad's oversight at Tiger's Game lands son in foster care.
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  If you watch much television, you're probably heard of the product called Mike's Hard Lemonade.
[26:14.000 --> 26:26.000]  And if you ask Christopher Ratt, Rate, and his wife, how they lost custody of their seven-year-old son, the short version is nobody in the Rate family watches much television.
[26:26.000 --> 26:34.000]  I've never, I don't watch a lot of TV, but I haven't watched hardly any in about three years, but I've never seen a hard lemonade at it.
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  It doesn't matter. It's like, oh, you're guilty. You didn't know the product.
[26:38.000 --> 26:55.000]  The way police and child protective workers figure it, Rate should have known that what a park vendor handed over when Rate ordered lemonade for his boy three Saturdays ago contained alcohol.
[26:55.000 --> 27:08.000]  And Rate's ignorance justified placing young Leo in foster care. Even in hindsight, the decision seems a bit idiotic.
[27:08.000 --> 27:15.000]  Rate is a tenured professor. See, imagine the poor family or normal blue collar folks or even white collar folks. It's over.
[27:15.000 --> 27:26.000]  But because he's a well-known famous archeologist, oh, maybe, oh, and Mr. Rate doesn't even drink, and we watch the surveillance tapes.
[27:26.000 --> 27:40.000]  Rate is a tenured professor of classic archeology at the University of Michigan, which means that on any given day, he's more likely to be excavating ancient burial sites in Turkey than watching Dancing with the Stars, or even the History Channel, for that matter.
[27:40.000 --> 27:52.000]  The 47-year-old academic says he wasn't even aware alcoholic lemonade existed when he and Leo stopped at a concession stand on the way to their seats in Section 114.
[27:52.000 --> 27:59.000]  And they went back and asked the guy, we're going to get Mr. Rate on. They went back and asked, did he order lemonade? Did you give him that?
[27:59.000 --> 28:14.000]  Yeah, I did. I don't know why. I never drunk it, never purchased it, never heard of it. Rate of Ann Arbor told me sheepishly, oh, sheepishly, you went to the slaughter well, didn't you?
[28:14.000 --> 28:23.000]  Last week, and it is certainly not what I expected when I ordered lemonade for my seven-year-old.
[28:23.000 --> 28:31.000]  But it wasn't until the top of the ninth inning that a part security guard noticed the bottle in the young Leo's hand.
[28:31.000 --> 28:36.000]  You know, this is an alcoholic beverage the guard asked the professor.
[28:36.000 --> 28:42.000]  See, everything's all heightened, spying on everyone, looking for terrorists, checkpoints, military out front, searching bags.
[28:42.000 --> 28:55.000]  And so you've got all this all jacked up, truck drivers, people with their motorboats on the lake, teachers, hundreds of thousands of executives and preachers and all these people just, oh, kind of, everywhere, terrorist.
[28:55.000 --> 29:02.000]  But then they're all trained, they go to tattletale meetings and learn how to watch, and they say, we're fighting terror and crime, and then they're going to find crime.
[29:02.000 --> 29:10.000]  They want to report something, they want to get somebody, they want to find something, they want to accept the illegal aliens, and you can report them and the cops won't come.
[29:10.000 --> 29:16.000]  Hey, there's a vanload of 15 illegal aliens, they got little babies in their arms without safety seats.
[29:16.000 --> 29:24.000]  The cops won't pull them over and won't stop them, because, again, that's against globalist policy.
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  It's all selectively enforced.
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  But when we get back, we'll tell you what they did to the little kid.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  Oh, yeah, they tortured him.
[29:31.000 --> 29:44.000]  Oh, for his safety, though, gotta freak out and act like something real big happened and call ambulances and stick needles in him, and then it turned out there was no alcohol in his blood.
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[29:48.000 --> 29:54.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:54.000 --> 30:01.000]  Greetings, my name is Dr. Viewle Von Schacht with the White Paper Chronicles from the main polluted stream media.
[30:01.000 --> 30:06.000]  I'm here to expose a fraud and an all-around un-American stinker.
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  His name is Steve Schenck, his radio show called Fearless Radio.
[30:10.000 --> 30:19.000]  He says, solution to all the craziness in America is just get independent and healthy, so you can be fearless of all of the scary stuff you're not supposed to know about.
[30:19.000 --> 30:24.000]  Stay away from this stinker on website efoodsdirect.com.
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  I warned you, don't do efoodsdirect.com.
[30:28.000 --> 30:33.000]  Don't dial 800-605-5868 for this dangerous program.
[30:33.000 --> 30:36.000]  800-605-5868.
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  You've heard what happens to a brain on drugs?
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  Can you imagine what happens to a brain that has been shanked?
[30:42.000 --> 30:43.000]  This is Steve.

[33:05.000 --> 33:12.000]  You think the government and their minions care about the fact you're innocent?
[33:12.000 --> 33:18.000]  Didn't they care about the fact that you've done nothing wrong?
[33:18.000 --> 33:20.000]  There's two million cops.
[33:20.000 --> 33:24.000]  They're creating scores of new bureaucracies every day.
[33:24.000 --> 33:31.000]  Whole new classes of social workers with law enforcement and semi-law enforcement power.
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.000]  They're here to eat out your substance as the Declaration of Independence says.
[33:36.000 --> 33:38.000]  They're here to take your children.
[33:38.000 --> 33:41.000]  They're here to find and feed you.
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  They're here to tie you down for the elite.
[33:44.000 --> 33:45.000]  The elite don't need your money.
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  It's not about revenue generation.
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  That's only to fund their dogs.
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  That's only to feed their dogs.
[33:53.000 --> 33:54.000]  Their warhounds.
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  Their hellhounds.
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  Their predator class.
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.000]  It's about tying you down, getting you in the system.
[34:04.000 --> 34:10.000]  And by the way, I'm not just picking and choosing cases where a woman pulls up, locks the car with three of her kids in it,
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  walks 10 feet and throws change in.
[34:12.000 --> 34:17.000]  It was all on surveillance camera and they CPS her kids.
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  I'm not just talking about things like that.
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.000]  I know right here in Austin, middle class, middle class families, I hear about it all the time.
[34:26.000 --> 34:33.000]  It didn't matter if they're at the park or at school in front of 20, 30, 40, 50 people.
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  Even if it happens at school and the child falls off of monkey bars and breaks their finger,
[34:38.000 --> 34:45.000]  or breaks their arm like happened to all of us, you go to the hospital and you at least get a CPS interrogation and visit.
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  They at least drag your child behind closed doors and say, does mommy touch you?
[34:50.000 --> 34:51.000]  Does daddy touch you?
[34:51.000 --> 34:52.000]  Do they hit you?
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  You think they provide, quote, counseling in the schools?
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  Oh, because of all the suicides when the fed started death education in 1990, teaching the kids how to commit suicide,
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  just like the DARE program, taught them how to use drugs, drug use exploded, suicide exploded.
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  They know what they're doing, not the idiot psychologist or the idiot cop.
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  They're compartmentalized.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  Globalists openly call them idiots.
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  They think they're actually helping.
[35:17.000 --> 35:25.000]  But that social workers in there, that's all that psychologist is, and they're there to get dirt on your family.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  That's like the Inquisitor.
[35:27.000 --> 35:38.000]  That's like how they used in the old world the confessing to the priest to get the data, to get the info that was going on in the town, the city as a form of intelligence.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  And it's the same thing here.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  And then you wonder why the SWAT team hits you.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  You wonder why they come and grab your kids.
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.000]  You wonder why that happens because they interview your children every day without you even ever knowing about it.
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.000]  They even tell you, don't tell your parents.
[35:53.000 --> 36:00.000]  They have, quote, law enforcement class in sixth, seventh and eighth grade across the nation, depending on which school district it is.
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  Generally, it's the eighth grade.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  Seventh is actually the most popular.
[36:04.000 --> 36:14.000]  For entire semester with a federal deputized local deputy, local sheriff's deputy deputized, having them write essays on you and your life and the guns you've got.
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  This country so far gone.
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  We're in such a East German society.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  It's mind blowing.
[36:22.000 --> 36:29.000]  Let's admit how far we've fallen.
[36:29.000 --> 36:36.000]  Let's admit to ourselves what we have become in this nation.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  Now let's go back to the latest story today.
[36:39.000 --> 36:45.000]  Hard lemonade, hard price, dad's oversight at Tiger's Game Land, son in foster care.
[36:45.000 --> 36:52.000]  Well known archaeologist, 47 years old.
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  Says I like a lemonade and they give him a bottle and I've done this myself.
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  The hard lemonade doesn't look like it's alcoholic.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  But see the line comes in now.
[37:02.000 --> 37:09.000]  They grab the kid crying, driving him an ambulance with sticking needles and IVs in him.
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  Get him there, sending him to the ER.
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  There's nothing wrong with the kid.
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.000]  It admits here.
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.000]  And when they finally drew his blood, zero alcohol.
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  He didn't like the taste of it and set it down.
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  Zero, zero.
[37:26.000 --> 37:31.000]  And then the cops are in the record going, well, he said he felt bad, which turns out's a lie.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  So they had to, oh my God, you attacked your son with alcohol.
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  No ambulances, oh my God.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  Stick him in an ambulance, stick needles in him.
[37:40.000 --> 37:47.000]  Oh my, oh you, arrest the father, take the child.
[37:47.000 --> 37:52.000]  But then the article says they were doing their duty.
[37:52.000 --> 37:59.000]  Like the Dallas police pulling over more than 2,000 vehicles and throwing bags of chalk on the back and taking the Corvettes.
[37:59.000 --> 38:09.000]  And taking the Mercedes and oh, then getting them for themselves at auctions where no one else bit.
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  It's so good.
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.000]  It's free.
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.000]  It's, our government's good.
[38:14.000 --> 38:25.000]  Don't talk about our good officers like that.
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  Now that's the type of thing we were dealing with.
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.000]  So let me finish the article.
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.000]  So they give, he asked for him to eliminate, he ordered lemonade.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  And they even later asked the vendor and they said, yeah, that's what he ordered, lemonade.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  I gave him that.
[38:42.000 --> 38:49.000]  And that matter.
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  You know, this is an alcoholic beverage to guard as the professor.
[38:53.000 --> 38:54.000]  You've got to be kidding.
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  Rate replied.
[38:55.000 --> 39:02.000]  He asked for the bottle, but the security guard snatched it back before rate could examine the label.
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.000]  Yeah, you can't interact with a slave or be really got a zero tolerance.
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  You heard about the 911 attacks.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  I've been given any terror training.
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.000]  I got, I'm gonna find somebody like the air marshals have been ordered to just report innocent people every day.
[39:17.000 --> 39:18.000]  They have a quota.
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  There's over a million people on the terror database now.
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  Your five year old takes a picture in an airport for the rest of your life.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  You're in a terror database.
[39:27.000 --> 39:36.000]  An hour later, rate was being interviewed by Detroit police officer at Children's Hospital where a physician at the
[39:36.000 --> 39:42.000]  com com comical apart clinic had dispatched Leo by ambulance.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  Oh, so they always nitty and exaggerate everything.
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.000]  So they feel good about their tyranny after a cursory exam.
[39:49.000 --> 39:57.000]  Leo betrayed no symptoms of an aviation, but the physician and the police officer from the substation suggested ER visit because
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.000]  they're doctors after the boy admitted he was feeling a little nauseated.
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  That's a lie.
[40:01.000 --> 40:08.000]  By the way, we later found out the comic here park cop estimated that Leo had drunk about 12 ounces of the hard lemonade,
[40:08.000 --> 40:15.000]  which is 5% alcohol, but an ER resident who drew Leo's blood less than 90 minutes after.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  He and his father were escorted from their seats detected.
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.000]  No trace of alcohol and it would have been there if he had any completely normal appearing.
[40:25.000 --> 40:26.000]  The resident wrote in his report.
[40:26.000 --> 40:32.000]  He is cleared to go home, but it would be two days before the state of Michigan allowed rates.
[40:32.000 --> 40:41.000]  Wife, UM architecture professor Claire Zimmerman to take her son home and nearly a week before rate was permitted to move back
[40:41.000 --> 40:45.000]  into his own house and they're now still under observation.
[40:45.000 --> 40:51.000]  No judge, no jury, no due process, no indictment just being spied on by pedophiles.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  That's generally who runs it.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  Go check it out for yourself.
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  And if you think nothing is so ludicrous could happen to your family,
[40:58.000 --> 41:03.000]  maybe you should pay a little less attention to who's getting booted from dancing with the stars.
[41:03.000 --> 41:10.000]  A little more attention to how the state agency responsible for protecting Michigan's children is going about its work doing their duty.
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  Almost everyone.
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  Chris rate met that night.
[41:17.000 --> 41:21.000]  They took Leo away.
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  Conceded the state was probably overreacting.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  Now they got to have kids to fly out to Saudi.
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.000]  You know what a seven year old white child's worth.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  They sympathetic cop.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  Oh, they're always real sympathetic.
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.000]  We got to do this to you and jab needles in him and freak him out, but I'm real sorry about it.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  Go ahead and get on the train now.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  How about you start saying no?
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  How about you start not being freaks?
[41:48.000 --> 41:51.000]  The sympathetic cop who interviewed rate.
[41:51.000 --> 41:52.000]  Oh, good cop, bad cop.
[41:52.000 --> 41:58.000]  And his son at the hospital said he was convinced what happened had to be an accident.
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.000]  But the supervisor was insisting the matter be referred to child protective services.
[42:03.000 --> 42:13.000]  And rate thought that the two child protective workers who came to take Leo away seem more annoyed with the police than with him.
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  This is so unnecessary.
[42:14.000 --> 42:20.000]  One told rate before driving away with his son.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  But there was really nothing any of them could do.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  They all said, that's right.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  We just have to follow all these criminal orders.
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  They were just adhering to protocol following orders.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  It actually says that there's no judge, no jury, no law.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  They just made these family courts 60 years ago for eugenics.
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  They were eugenics court.
[42:37.000 --> 42:47.000]  I have in in game eugenics court film footage.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  That was family court.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  Family court was decided he would be sterilized or every child would be taken.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  See, it's new.
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  We didn't have it before.
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  We didn't have a federal reserve.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  We didn't have an income tax for the private bankers.
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.000]  We didn't have this.
[43:00.000 --> 43:05.000]  We didn't have state police who were federally chartered in the mid 1930s under
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  martial law reorganization.
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  War Powers Act 1933.
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.000]  Read it for yourself.
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.000]  And I know a lot of police don't like this, but they still do it.
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  Doing their duty.
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  Just adhering to protocol following orders.
[43:25.000 --> 43:26.000]  There's no judge, jury.
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  I mean, if somebody's hurting a kid, there's criminal charges.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  We didn't need CPS before.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  And I'm so sick of all the CPS propaganda always on the news.
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  Always how they love you.
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  Always Department of Justice own numbers.
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.000]  And I haven't looked these numbers up in seven plus years.
[43:44.000 --> 43:47.000]  I remember it was on the cover of Time Magazine in 2000.
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  The shame of foster care.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  I've seen state numbers that are higher, but I haven't seen it.
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.000]  It was five times more likely to be abused in their custody.
[43:56.000 --> 43:59.000]  Where do you think pedophiles get jobs?
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.000]  Let me just, you think all pedophiles just run around in raincoats outside
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  school yards?
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.000]  Some of them do, but the smart ones, they go join CPS.
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.000]  Or the others are menly ill who were severely beaten as children.
[44:13.000 --> 44:18.000]  I went to college around some of them and you'd be out drinking beer or out
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.000]  getting pizza and you'd invite some girls along.
[44:22.000 --> 44:23.000]  Your friend would bring some.
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  And most of them were going to be social workers and they would just get this
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  crazy look in their eyes and go, you know, my father abused me.
[44:29.000 --> 44:34.000]  And I'm going to wait to get these bad parents that are abusing their children.
[44:34.000 --> 44:40.000]  It was like a movie, but you look at them going, this person's mentally ill.
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  So that's what you've got.
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.000]  You've got people that are out to quote, punish mommy and daddy.
[44:45.000 --> 44:49.000]  And that's you because you're their mommy, you're their daddy.
[44:49.000 --> 44:53.000]  Daddy died in a car wreck or daddy was an alcoholic or daddy's in prison.
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.000]  But you know, you're, you're that mother and father when they're at your door.
[44:57.000 --> 45:05.000]  And you're, you're the mommy and daddy and you're going to pay or it's a pedophile.
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  And it comes out every day, but it's in the back of the paper.
[45:07.000 --> 45:12.000]  I see it all the time where they catch the CPS workers making videos doing it.
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.000]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[45:16.000 --> 45:17.000]  I'm tired of you.
[45:17.000 --> 45:22.000]  You're a filthy degenerate scumbag cancer.
[45:22.000 --> 45:29.000]  And in the 1930s, all across the U.S., 34 states set up family courts to carry out quote, racial hygiene.
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.000]  Read their charters.
[45:32.000 --> 45:39.000]  And they'd call in the mother, 20 year old single mother and just being a single mother.
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.000]  They take your kid to an orphanage, they do medical experiments on them, sterilize them, didn't matter.
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  Sterilize you.
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  No due process, no nothing.
[45:48.000 --> 45:49.000]  And so that's same.
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  Everything is eugenics.
[45:51.000 --> 45:52.000]  Do you understand?
[45:52.000 --> 45:59.000]  I had the head for the state of Texas who writes the policy testifying before the legislature.
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  And representative of Susanna Hupp says, why are more than two thirds of foster children on psychotropic drugs?
[46:06.000 --> 46:11.000]  And he said, they have bad genes. They come from a bad gene pool.
[46:11.000 --> 46:12.000]  They never genetically tested them.
[46:12.000 --> 46:13.000]  There's no proof.
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  They just make it up.
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  Oh, we, we, we poison two thirds of the kids because they have a bad gene pool.
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.000]  That's in in game.
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  It's all eugenics.
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  Well, it's a regulation.
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  They put sodium fluoride in my round rock or Austin water.
[46:31.000 --> 46:37.000]  Doesn't matter if all the studies say it literally gives me a 20 point IQ reduction.
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  It's, it's a protocol.
[46:41.000 --> 46:48.000]  You understand me?
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  But there was really nothing for them to do.
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.000]  They all said they were just following and hearing a protocol and following orders.
[46:53.000 --> 47:00.000]  And so what had begun following orders from the CPS and the security guard.
[47:00.000 --> 47:08.000]  And so what had begun as a outing to a ballpark ended with Leo crying himself to sleep in front of a television inside child protective services building.
[47:08.000 --> 47:14.000]  And rate and his wife standing on the sidewalk outside wondering when they'd seen her little boy again.
[47:14.000 --> 47:22.000]  Now, you know what happens if you're some poor little kid who's got poor white trash parents that stand around in the waiting room going, we didn't do nothing.
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  Don't do that.
[47:24.000 --> 47:29.000]  Well, they take that boy in the back and have their way with them because they know that nobody's going to believe that boy.
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.000]  Nobody's going to stop them.
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  And they do it every day.
[47:34.000 --> 47:35.000]  It's going on right now.
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  Thousands of places right now.
[47:40.000 --> 47:41.000]  A vain rescue mission.
[47:41.000 --> 47:49.000]  Child protective services in the unit of the Michigan Department of Human Services responsible for intervening when someone suspects a child is being abused, neglected or endangered.
[47:49.000 --> 47:56.000]  Its powers include the authority to remove children from their homes and transfer them to foster parents who answer only to the state.
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.000]  Oh, really? No judge, no jury, no due process, no indictment, no warrant.
[48:01.000 --> 48:02.000]  It's just made up.
[48:02.000 --> 48:09.000]  Hey, I'm a big fat pedophile that likes to nilly around and rape kids.
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  I'm responsible to no one.
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  I'm God.
[48:14.000 --> 48:27.000]  By law, CPS officials are forbidden to discuss the particulars of any investigation.
[48:27.000 --> 48:33.000]  And it just goes on from there.
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  Oh my God, I can't read anymore.
[48:35.000 --> 48:40.000]  I actually just, it's all over, man.
[48:40.000 --> 48:46.000]  Look at this.
[48:46.000 --> 48:54.000]  New Florida law would grant cops right, would grant them, see it's all imperial, to impound cars playing loud music.
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.000]  A new law for vote, final vote next month with grant police.
[48:58.000 --> 49:04.000]  The authority to impound vehicles and found playing their stereo is too loud.
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  And it goes on from there.
[49:06.000 --> 49:13.000]  Not surprisingly, the law has proven controversial. See, it starts out with, you got drugs in your car, they take it.
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  Now, then it's, you hired a prostitute, they take it.
[49:16.000 --> 49:17.000]  Now loud music.
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.000]  Now hadn't paid your fines.
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.000]  And all over the country, now they take your tax money and put in the front page of the local papers.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  Randomly, people that hadn't paid parking tickets.
[49:28.000 --> 49:39.000]  All about the big brother world, all about the state intimidating and bossing you around and dominating you and controlling you and just with no due process.
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  Now again, I keep making this point the last few weeks, every hour on the hour.
[49:43.000 --> 49:50.000]  I want to explain to the FBI, to the police, to the CPS workers, to all of you that serve this system.
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  You're under eugenics attack too.
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  Just because you say you're not, because you haven't done the research, doesn't make it go away.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  I have all the documents, I've had all the scientists and doctors on.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  We've made the films, we put links to it.
[50:01.000 --> 50:18.000]  Let me tell you again, they're putting a host, hundreds of different cancer viruses, DNA oppressors, cancer triggers, sterilization compounds in your shots, in your water, in your food.
[50:18.000 --> 50:28.000]  The GMO corn, the GMO potatoes that have been on store shelves for a decade plus, kill all the rats that eat it.
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  They're spraying us, we're together.
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  Do you understand?
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  They're setting up a tyrannical world government.
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.000]  It's all public, but you're not going to see it on the nightly news.
[50:42.000 --> 50:47.000]  And we come back, a top globalist has openly stated it all.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  Do you understand?
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  Do you understand?
[50:51.000 --> 51:20.000]  Do you read me?

[54:39.000 --> 54:44.000]  Again, just instead of denying me, cops driving along, find out who you work for.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  Find out how sophisticated they are.
[54:47.000 --> 54:52.000]  Find out how serious they are in their operations.
[54:52.000 --> 54:58.000]  David Rockefeller, four years ago, wrote his autobiography and in it,
[54:58.000 --> 55:04.000]  he openly says that he has worked his entire life to destroy U.S. sovereignty and set up world government.
[55:04.000 --> 55:11.000]  There are hundreds of these books, a new book out by Mr. Bobbitt, the nephew of LBJ,
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  another top globalist at University of Texas.
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  He's also a law professor at another school and he writes policy and he said,
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  get rid of the Constitution, get rid of our liberties and freedoms.
[55:22.000 --> 55:25.000]  He said it in the statesman and they put an image of a burning Constitution
[55:25.000 --> 55:30.000]  and they said the good guys are forgetting rid of freedom and our country.
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  So, I've already covered that in detail.
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.000]  Now, here is the newest one today.
[55:38.000 --> 55:46.000]  Now, this is super class, the global power elite and the world they are making.
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.000]  Now, I would add Ron Paul's new book, Manifesto of Liberty is number one on Amazon
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  by the way, we sell it at infowars.com.
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  Hope you'll get it there, support us as well.
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  But see, his book is number one.
[55:57.000 --> 56:01.000]  See, we are waking up and I don't think super class will do too well, but they don't care.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  This is for elitist by elitist.
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  Super class, the global power elite and the world they are making.
[56:08.000 --> 56:11.000]  infowars.com, prisonpundit.com, article by Paul Watson.
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  You can see the cover of the book on the site.
[56:15.000 --> 56:21.000]  And it has a map on the front that says Bilderberg, Bohemian Grove,
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  all these different interlocking power groups.
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.000]  You can watch a video of him saying Bohemian Grove is one of the key meeting houses
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  where they make decisions.
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  Of course, I have National, I have the New York Times saying it doesn't exist
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  when I made it up.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  But see, that's a nod to the yuppies.
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  They tell the yuppies this doesn't exist, you're not allowed to admit it exists,
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  you're a slave and they go, I self censor, I am your minion.
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.000]  It does not exist.
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  I have to act mainline and cool.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  That's how I climb the ladder.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  I am your slave.
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.000]  And then they publicly to themselves say, okay, we run everything.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  You see how they do that?
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  They say FEMA camps don't exist and then by the way, we're building them everywhere
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  and we're going to put you in them.
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  Elitist blueprint for world government revealed.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  And it has a picture of all these elitist groups on a map.
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.000]  Laying on the map is one of those little worlds that's on a key chain,
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  little plastic globes with a key.
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  They have the key to world government.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  And we have excerpts of it.
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  They say they're going to shut down the web and only let you have subdomains on corporate websites
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  where there'll be no free speech.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  He says that to quote counter anti globalists that they're going to quote take our free speech.
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  He goes on to say that they are setting up global police systems to crack down on liberty.
[57:33.000 --> 57:39.000]  He says that nation states are almost basically gone already and they're going to quote have global government,
[57:39.000 --> 57:43.000]  but that they call it global governance and interconnectivity and integration
[57:43.000 --> 57:47.000]  because the public gets too upset about this and understand under the global government,
[57:47.000 --> 57:48.000]  you don't vote.
[57:48.000 --> 57:49.000]  You don't have rights.
[57:49.000 --> 57:50.000]  You don't have freedom to understand that.
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  You know, all these liberals and people have been taught.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  Well, it's a global community.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  All of us together at global democracy.
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  You know, McCain call it.
[57:58.000 --> 58:01.000]  They call it a democracy, but you don't get a vote in it.
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.000]  You get rapid reaction trips killing you.
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.000]  You understand that?
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  And everywhere the UN goes, they rape and kill children.
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  It's a pedophile army.
[58:11.000 --> 58:12.000]  By the way, I'm not joking.
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  He says 6,000 European men work together.
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  And folks, if you're not into men, you're not in the club.
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  Let me just add that little point.
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  And I'm not attacking gay people out there.
[58:23.000 --> 58:26.000]  I'm not saying you're all part of it, but this group is predominantly.
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.000]  Well, look at Caligula.
[58:27.000 --> 58:28.000]  Look at Nero.
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  It is a homosexual death cult.
[58:31.000 --> 58:32.000]  We'll be right back.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:44.000 --> 58:47.000]  It is a big idea.
[58:47.000 --> 58:49.000]  A new world order.
[58:49.000 --> 58:54.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[58:59.000 --> 59:02.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[59:05.000 --> 59:10.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:13.000 --> 59:18.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:25.000 --> 59:26.000]  Most people have no idea.
[59:26.000 --> 59:27.000]  They're not after money.
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.000]  They have all the money they need.
[59:28.000 --> 59:29.000]  They're after power.
[59:29.000 --> 59:30.000]  Yes, they're after music.
[59:30.000 --> 59:35.000]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com
[59:35.000 --> 59:39.000]  or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[59:39.000 --> 59:42.000]  In-game blueprint for global enslaved.
[59:42.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  You have been warned.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  Really, the best way to describe the new world order gang is devil force.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  And whether you believe in a physical devil or not,
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  I mean, they act like it.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  The average, the love of power, the love of killing innocents,
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  the love of poisoning the public, the power trip of it all.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  I mean, think, what would the ultimate control freak do?
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  They would seek to take control of education, dump everybody down,
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  and then take control of your health,
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  and poison you and limit your lifespan in the name of saving the Earth,
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  which they've been pushing for 100 years under their eugenics operation.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  Let me go ahead and just read this article in its entirety,
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  and I hope you get this out to everyone.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  But I would tell Paul, go ahead and add quotes from David Rockefeller's last biography,
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  where he admits he wants to destroy the U.S.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  Go ahead and add some Carol quickly quotes,
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  because I want him to understand this is a unified front.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  And I want the police and bureaucrats to know that in force all this,
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  you're destroying your entire future.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  I mean, you are, when you stab us and beat us and imprison us,
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  you're imprisoning yourself.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Just know that.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  That's why they tried to make us immoral and evil and petty
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  so they could create the force they needed to carry this out.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  Very scientifically done, you've got to hand it to them.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  Nobody said they weren't smart.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  Elidas Blueprint for World Government revealed a new book written by a leading globalist,
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Luminary provides a blueprint for how 6,000 elitists
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  plan to completely end national sovereignty,
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  impose a system of global governance,
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  and how they will deal with an international network of people that resist their agenda.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  The book is super class, The Global Power Elite,
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  and the world they are making by David Rothkoff.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  And it goes on.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  It is a manifesto for how the elite plan to shape the course of the planet
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  and impose a new world order while combating the inevitable, quote,
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  global network of anti-globalists who will rise up against it.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  The author of the book, David J. Rothkoff,
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  And we had, of course, the hearings, the church hearings in the 70s
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  about where they bought their documents out, where they planned world government,
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  plan to get rid of the family, total eugenics, staging wars, staging starvation.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  There is, of course, Senators ahead of the committee,
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  film online on Google, testimony, you can go watch it all.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  It's diabolical.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  The author of the book, David J. Rothkoff,
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  and has previously served as the deputy undersecretary of commerce
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  for international trade during the administration of Bill Clinton
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  before he became managing director of Kissinger and Associates in January of 1996.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  Absolutely key grip there.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  So he's a head guy at three major nexus points.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  This is a top guy.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  This is a guy, a manager for the Rothschild, Rockefeller,
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  Saxe-Coburg, Gotha, Crime, Axis,
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  and don't give me they don't run things.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  I mean, I remember articles 10 years ago saying Rothschilds didn't exist,
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  that they never existed and it was made up.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Blood and Guardian headline,
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  McCann accused of accepting improper donations from Rothschilds.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  A salon.com review alarmingly details the brazen premise of Rothkoff's book.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  A global elite now run the planet and have usurped the power of national governments
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  while ensuring laws constrained by borders are all but obsolete.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  So they are lawless, understand?
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  More laws on us, total regulation and control, control freak bureaucrats on our back,
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  but for him, nothing, for them, nothing.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  Each one of them is one in a million.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  This is a quote.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  They number 6,000 on the planet of six billion.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  They run our governments, our largest corporations,
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  the powerhouses of international finance, the media, world religions,
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  and from the shadows, the world's most dangerous criminal and terrorist organizations.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  This is just like Gary Hart coming out and saying at the US stage is the terror attacks.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  And then we got him on tape to admit it again.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  He comes out and says, yeah, Ben Laden's, he's one of us.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  I'm going to read the rest of this when we get back.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  And then they laugh and say, but you slaves don't read.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:51.640]  Rice Day.
[1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:56.680]  Terror Storm, a history of government sponsor terror, loose change final cut, in game blueprint
[1:04:56.680 --> 1:05:01.660]  for global enslavement, the true story of the Bilderberg group, the late great USA, America,
[1:05:01.660 --> 1:05:03.160]  Freedom to Fascism.

[1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:55.800]  Hi, my name's Don Wiskinen. For over seven years I've been telling people about CardiBite.
[1:06:55.800 --> 1:06:59.200]  Here's Dr. John Matz and a naturopathic doctor in his views on CardiBite.
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:03.400]  I would like to thank you, Don, for making my job so much easier, because your products
[1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:07.320]  just make it so simple, right? To fool around with a lot of exotic things that don't work.
[1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:11.200]  We can just put them on CardiBite and things start to work almost right away. Not bad. Dozens
[1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:15.840]  of, dozens of patients with heart problems who have corrected them. And what it's doing,
[1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:19.720]  there's so much garlic in there that has a yeast killing effect. That yeast is a big
[1:07:19.720 --> 1:07:24.200]  problem in the gut. It pushes the liver heart. It also has metal chelating effect. And most
[1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:28.160]  of the other herbs in there I find that strengthen the arteries. They help to neutralize free
[1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:32.720]  radicals. Your remedy is as close to what we do in our program as you can get as far
[1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:37.040]  as one supplement goes. It's working on the gut. It's working on the liver. It's working
[1:07:37.040 --> 1:07:44.480]  on the arteries. What more can you ask for? To learn more, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit
[1:07:44.480 --> 1:08:02.960]  our website at heartdrop.com. That's H-E-A-R-T-D-R-O-P.com.
[1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:07.160]  You know, while we're on this subject, I forgot to tell John during the break, queue up the
[1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:13.200]  last minute or two of that Gary Hart confrontation, because he said, they pull out the letter
[1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:16.480]  at the point where they pull out the letter and they say, you wrote this letter to the
[1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:22.480]  leaders of Iran saying the U.S. would stage terror attacks as a pretext for war. And he
[1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:27.600]  says, no, I didn't. And then he goes on to say, what I did was write a letter to them
[1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:31.880]  and publish it in the Huffington Post saying that our government will stage terror attacks
[1:08:31.880 --> 1:08:36.320]  as a pretext to attack them. See, it's all double think. It's all, they have hundreds
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:39.680]  of different programs. It's well known as Del Fathers, variants of that, where they
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:46.520]  say, we're not putting a toll road on Mopac. We're putting a toll road on Mopac. It's all
[1:08:46.520 --> 1:08:51.680]  psychological warfare. So we're going to play that. Let's go ahead and play that now. Then
[1:08:51.680 --> 1:08:56.360]  I'll get back into a latest blueprint for world government reveal, where he says bin Laden
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:02.160]  is one of us. I mean, you see the arrogance or Hart writes a letter saying we stage attacks,
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:06.320]  do what we say. And then we confronted domestically where he doesn't want that information out.
[1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:11.600]  He says, I didn't say that. The whole clip's 10 minutes long. He says, I never called for
[1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:16.120]  a world government. I called for a world government. I never said new world order. I only said
[1:09:16.120 --> 1:09:21.880]  I wanted a new world order. Go go watch the whole clip. I mean, it is a education in how
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:27.560]  they operate. But it's because we're so weak minded. This has happened. We've been trained.
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:33.160]  Our ancestors would go into rages and stuff like this, not us. Once you train yourself
[1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:37.800]  to accept lies, it's like a little mental tricky play or Orwell called it double think
[1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:44.680]  or crime stop. Google those terms and learn them and learn the control you're under.
[1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:49.200]  Let's go ahead and play Gary Hart. Recently wrote a letter to the president of Iran in
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:54.640]  which you urged him to study the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which we now know was a staged event
[1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:59.760]  used to justify war with Vietnam. And you also raised the question, does America provoke
[1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:05.440]  both publications? Sir, was this not an album? I have the letter right here, sir, if you
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:11.160]  want to read it. I have it on me right here. Sir, I mean, that's mainstream media. It's
[1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:17.600]  been published in many publications. Do you deny writing that letter? Stop right there.
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:21.720]  On the video, you can see it. He denies it. He said, I didn't write that letter. And then
[1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:27.600]  he pulls it out and says, sir, I have it. And Hart says, do you have it signed? And he looks
[1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:33.120]  totally guilty and then has this demonic smile. I mean, he looks at something out of a Clive
[1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:38.440]  Barker movie. Well, they are. These are crazed killers, folks. You realize who Gary Hart is?
[1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:45.440]  He's a top strategist. He wrote the Homeland Security plan. He predicted the 9 11 attacks
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:51.720]  before they happened. Of course he did. Now, now listen to him. Listen to how he denies
[1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:57.360]  it and then admits it. Again, these are deceptive creatures back to it. Publications. Do you
[1:10:57.360 --> 1:11:02.440]  deny writing that letter, sir? Do you deny anything? I don't even see a letter. You said,
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:09.960]  I can read it to you right now. Okay. You said, presuming that you are not actually ignorant
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:15.940]  enough to desire war with the United States, you might be well advised to read the history
[1:11:15.940 --> 1:11:20.840]  of the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor in 1898 and the history of the Gulf
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:26.840]  of Tonkin. I'm sorry. That was a blog on Novington Post. I did not literally write a letter.
[1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:33.640]  It was a mock letter. Sorry. Okay. Sir, was this not an outright threat? Failed in double
[1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:39.040]  speak that the United States could stage an event to go to war with Iran? No. No? Then
[1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:46.400]  well, what I was tongue-in-cheek saying was that we have an administration in Washington
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:56.280]  that is dying for a reason to bomb Iran. And so in a mock blog letter to the Iranian government,
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:12:01.000]  the president of the Iranian government. Hit pause. Back it up a minute. It's not called
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:06.360]  a mock letter. He's trying to back up his previous line. It's called a open letter,
[1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:13.600]  a public letter, and you know full well, it was a public notice on a website receiving
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:20.320]  about a million visitors a day and then put in major newspapers. It was a open letter,
[1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:25.240]  kind of like when you're going to see somebody's property or when you've declared adverse possession.
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:31.160]  You've got to put a notice in. These vampires have very strange rules. They follow ancient
[1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:38.520]  Roman civil law and they always tell you what they're going to do. Repeatedly. Let's go
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:46.080]  back to it. I did not literally write a letter. It was a mock letter. Sorry. Okay. Well, sir,
[1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:50.480]  was this not an outright threat? Failed in double speak that the United States could
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:59.280]  have staged an event to go to war with Iran? No. Well, what I was tongue-in-cheek saying
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:06.720]  was that we have an administration in Washington that is dying for a reason to bomb Iran. And
[1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:13.880]  so in a mock blog letter to the Iranian government, not the president of the Iranian government,
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:19.360]  I just simply said, unless you people want to be bombed, you better be careful about
[1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:25.520]  cross-border incursions. And I think I explicitly said, keep the Republican Guard or the Revolutionary
[1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:32.200]  Guard or whatever it's called. Away from the Iraqi border, I was trying to communicate
[1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:38.440]  to the American people what our own government was trying to plan. And that was to find a
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:44.800]  reason for bombing Iran. And I was simply saying, in effect to the American people through
[1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:55.640]  this mock letter, be very careful about this administration creating a USS Maine incident
[1:13:55.640 --> 1:14:01.480]  or a Gulf of Tonkin incident that would justify bombing Iran. That's all.
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:08.440]  Okay. We are change.org. Infowars.com. You can go watch the whole video. So they said,
[1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:12.400]  sir, you were telling them that the U.S. government could stage a Gulf of Tonkin or
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:19.680]  USS Maine. No, that's not what I said. What I said was is they could stage a Gulf of Tonkin
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:25.080]  or USS Maine. That's all Delphi technique. You can go take it. A lot of corporate groups
[1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:30.320]  put it out. It'll pay thousands of dollars just for the short course. There's even clips
[1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:36.960]  of it online. You notice Mayor Koch did that with me. They will correct minutia, correct
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:41.680]  you repeatedly, twist things, change meanings to get you off balance. It's all for the
[1:14:41.680 --> 1:14:45.800]  public. The main Delphi technique is to say, we're having a public meeting to hear what
[1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:49.320]  you want. And then everybody comes to the meeting and says, we don't want to hand our
[1:14:49.320 --> 1:14:53.240]  water district over to some German company and have them double prices. And then at the
[1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:56.400]  end of the meeting, no matter 500 people say they don't want it, they go, we've heard what
[1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:03.160]  you want it. And we've heard now that you want the German company to take over. And
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:08.840]  then everybody just kind of goes, huh? I mean, it's just, they use techniques on you. And
[1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:15.080]  I personally have had enough of it. Now, let me get back into superclass. The reason I
[1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:19.640]  played that heart there is because that's what this guy is saying. It's all veiled.
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:24.920]  He said in the letter, this is to the Iranian government. And then the, we are changes. Oh,
[1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:29.480]  you wrote it to augment energy. And he said, no, the Iranian government. Okay, the president
[1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:38.080]  isn't the government. Again, playing semantical games, but they don't, that's meant for a
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:43.240]  foreign government. That's meant for governments that know. I mean, it isn't just Iran saying
[1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:48.360]  9 11's an inside job. It's the former Italian president for seven years or former intelligence
[1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:55.000]  chief, German, former minister of defense, members of parliament, US congressman, state
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:16:00.880]  senators on and on and on. I mean, it's former CI section chief of Europe, Bill Christensen.
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:07.800]  You realize what a CI section chief of Western Europe is? That's the most important position
[1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:20.360]  as a section chief, Bill Christians. Do you understand it's an inside job? That's what
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:24.400]  they do. They just throw it in your face. They know the whole world knows. So it's like,
[1:16:24.400 --> 1:16:28.120]  yeah, you better do what we say. We're going to stage something you think is 80% of the
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:32.600]  people in the US don't want a war that we won't stage something and have one with you.
[1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:40.880]  It says it in clear writing. And then Hartwood Doublespeak says, I didn't say that we'd stage
[1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:48.080]  an attack. I said we'd stage an attack. You realize they still have news articles saying
[1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:52.560]  the Bilderberg group doesn't exist. While this guy is in salon magazine bragging about
[1:16:52.560 --> 1:17:02.800]  how Bilderberg and how Bohemian Grove run it all over gay porn stars and fine wines.
[1:17:02.800 --> 1:17:06.280]  They run the world. I mean, it's just, it's unbelievable. Who could have thought up our
[1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:15.280]  planet would be run by these people? I mean, it's like David from on video running up.
[1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:22.760]  He literally ninny over and start slapping at the camera. I mean, just literally ninnying
[1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:28.960]  around. Can't we beat these people? Do we have to all be their slaves? A bunch of ninnying
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:36.280]  chicken necks with all our men following their orders, doing whatever they say? Why? Because
[1:17:36.280 --> 1:17:44.520]  they're private bankers and own everything. I'm sick of it. Let me read with this enemy
[1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:51.920]  of America had to say. We find this disgusting quote. Each one of them is one in a million.
[1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:57.440]  They number 6000 on a planet of six billion. They run our governments, our largest corporations,
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:03.920]  the power houses of international finance, the media, world religions, and from the shadows,
[1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:09.800]  the world's most dangerous criminal and terrorist organizations. They are the global superclass
[1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:17.760]  and they are shaping the history of our time. States the promo for the book. This just and
[1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:24.800]  he goes on to say some have been lied and is among us knowing that the maybe 20,000
[1:18:24.800 --> 1:18:30.600]  people are going to read this book. You'll try to tell your neighbor and they'll go books.
[1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:35.160]  I don't read them. You're some kind of weirdo. You know, there are cases I see all the time
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:39.680]  where they call SWAT teams on people was occasions in Indiana. I saw one in Georgia
[1:18:39.680 --> 1:18:43.800]  a few months. I see them all the time. It's always the same MO. You'll have some guy owns
[1:18:43.800 --> 1:18:47.720]  a pool cleaning company or guy who owns a construction company. They're usually upper
[1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:51.720]  middle class. You know, they'll be in a five bedroom house or wife kids and they'll go
[1:18:51.720 --> 1:18:54.760]  over and tell the neighbors we're about to have a depression, better buy storeable foods
[1:18:54.760 --> 1:19:00.120]  and some firearms. The neighbors think it's illegal. Call the cops and the cops go ahead
[1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:05.400]  and respond to that and go ahead and SWAT team them and say we found 25 guns and 10,000 rounds
[1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:12.600]  of ammo. And the news goes, Oh my God, a devil arsenal. And then they later let the guy go
[1:19:12.600 --> 1:19:17.480]  and nothing happens. But it's on the news that hardcore criminal had storeable foods
[1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:25.920]  and 25 guns. You go show your neighbor this, this guy's book. They'll think you're been
[1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:37.880]  logged and you'll go, Hey, this guy says that globalists are setting up a government using
[1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:41.720]  terror. Well, you're going to terror me. You're going to terror. I mean, folks, I've talked
[1:19:41.720 --> 1:19:47.480]  to people, but you're not, you're not a terrorist. Are you? Well, you're talking about terror.
[1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:55.680]  This kid's in the backyard playing alone. Call CPS. It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:19:55.680 --> 1:20:01.880]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government. It's known as the Builder
[1:20:01.880 --> 1:20:09.440]  Bird. Both their objective being world domination. For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:09.440 --> 1:20:14.440]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:22.920]  80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world
[1:20:22.920 --> 1:20:27.840]  government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world
[1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:32.040]  order agenda. Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government. Most people
[1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:35.200]  have no idea they're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after

[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:54.240]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods. I have been waiting patiently for the government
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:57.920]  and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing
[1:22:57.920 --> 1:23:02.480]  the world in the last 50 years. For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food
[1:23:02.480 --> 1:23:06.400]  than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with us. In the U.S.
[1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:10.040]  commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't
[1:23:10.040 --> 1:23:14.200]  be available for another four to five months. It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and
[1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:17.440]  many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped
[1:23:17.440 --> 1:23:22.400]  exporting certain commodities altogether. Remember our trade deficit? Trillions of dollars
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:26.000]  have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:30.640]  at any price. By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step
[1:23:30.640 --> 1:23:33.920]  in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:45.960]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit us at www.readyreservefoods.com,
[1:23:45.960 --> 1:24:01.760]  1-800-453-2202.
[1:24:01.760 --> 1:24:17.560]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board, and let this train keep on riding, riding
[1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:19.560]  on board.
[1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:40.000]  It never ceases to amaze me that we could have such horrible, wicked people running
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:51.240]  our lives, bragging and laughing at us, doing whatever they want to us, killing us in stage
[1:24:51.240 --> 1:24:58.680]  terror attacks and bio weapons operations. But we still follow their orders, we do what
[1:24:58.680 --> 1:25:03.280]  they tell us to do. We get in line, we submit to it because they give us petty power, and
[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:07.200]  so as long as we get to have our petty power, so what if we die of bio weapons they've been
[1:25:07.200 --> 1:25:12.400]  planted in, and so what? So what if they destroy our dollar and our savings? So what if they
[1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:20.240]  destroy our future and our country? That doesn't matter, it's good to be a slave, you know.
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:25.360]  The threadbare notion that Rothkopf's book is a critical and impartial investigation of
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:29.840]  the global elite can be rejected out of hand by just looking at the author's biography
[1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:35.760]  and reality, he is a cherished leader, the head of Kissinger Associates, that's the
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:41.880]  very tip top. Throughout the book, Rothkopf fawns over the global elite of which he too
[1:25:41.880 --> 1:25:50.320]  is a member. The Salon Review notes his palpable thrill at recognizing CEOs, oil company executives
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:55.320]  and Harvard professors on his way to a fondue restaurant, and the globalist enclave of
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:26:00.920]  Davos, Switzerland as his obsession with listing every banal achievement of each elitist he
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:22.720]  speaks with. By the way, he says that here, we have all that. It's disgusting. And they
[1:26:22.720 --> 1:26:26.240]  know that it's going to get worse and worse for us, he talks about that, so that's why
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:30.400]  we all got to be tracked and traced so we can be shut down. Your car won't start, we'll
[1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:43.640]  get in the taxi, won't be able to follow them, won't be able to do anything. Huge development
[1:26:43.640 --> 1:26:50.320]  in the news just happened. I have to suspend everything right now. Get the Deborah Jean
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:27:01.160]  Palfrey interviews ready. I think I interviewed her three, four times. She's dead. Oh man.
[1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:05.200]  They thought he might shoot his mouth off, so he ended up having that heart attack up
[1:27:05.200 --> 1:27:14.080]  in Colorado at Vale. Fox News, Florida police believes suicide victim is DC Madame. Deborah
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:18.320]  Jean Palfrey, the 52-year-old woman known as the DC Madame. By the way, she said on
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:23.840]  air she would never commit suicide. She said on air that even if she was convicted, she'd
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:30.480]  never give up. And I guarantee you she was getting ready to release some names. They're
[1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:35.000]  probably going to kill people around her who they think she may have talked to now. Look
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:39.480]  for a string of suicides there. Deborah Jean Palfrey, the 52-year-old woman known as the
[1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:44.400]  DC Madame, is believed to have committed suicide at her mother's home in a trailer park in
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:50.640]  the Tampa area, Tarpon Springs, police told Fox News.com. Palfrey was found guilty on
[1:27:50.640 --> 1:27:57.400]  April 15 by a DC grand jury, a jury of racketeering and money laundering related to her operation
[1:27:57.400 --> 1:28:03.960]  of a house of prostitution. Palfrey had threatened to reveal the names of her clients, many
[1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:08.400]  believed to be high-profile and business figures. She said that it was Dick Cheney, but that
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:11.880]  she wasn't ready to openly say it. She said on air, probably Cheney, but I'm not ready
[1:28:11.880 --> 1:28:17.680]  to say that yet. Well, you should have, hun. God, they killed her, boy. She's kind of like
[1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:23.880]  that Palestinian activist about to get his doctorate, trying to bring food and books
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:27.840]  to Palestinian children. They cut him open, all over his body, tortured the hell out of
[1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:34.880]  him and drowned him with duct tape all over him, tied up. And Austin police are good boys.
[1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:44.680]  They said he killed himself. Good boys. You did your job. Now take your vaccine. Your
[1:28:44.680 --> 1:28:52.000]  government loves you. Palfrey was found guilty on April 15 of a DC jury. Many believed to
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:57.400]  be high-profile political and business figures. The prosecutors went forward with her case.
[1:28:57.400 --> 1:29:08.880]  She did. 1956 to 2008 was former owner of Pamela Martin and Associates. The United States
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:13.080]  government alleges it was a prostitution service in DC. She was charged with operating a house
[1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:18.000]  of prostitution. Palfrey claims the services were offered were legal. She has been nicknamed
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:28.280]  a DC madam by the news media. She was found guilty by a DC jury on all counts. She committed
[1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:33.840]  suicide on May 1. She, by the way, is the high-stay Tana Coley to have them all. Bath
[1:29:33.840 --> 1:29:41.640]  on mat, please. Well, wonder if she shot herself in the back of the head a couple of times.

[1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:38.160]  but build to destroy. You play with my world. I got your little toy. You put a gun in my
[1:33:38.160 --> 1:33:45.160]  hand. And you hide from my eyes. And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
[1:33:58.040 --> 1:34:04.040]  Well, I could you just evolve. Yeah, these old men that run the New World Order. You
[1:34:04.040 --> 1:34:11.040]  lie in D.C. Gary Reb gets a Pulitzer Prize for exposing the fact that CIA brings in narcotics
[1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:17.880]  and they double tapped him in the head and said it was a suicide. They killed this local
[1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:23.880]  Palestinian activist, cut him all up, duct taped him, slaughtered him and said it was
[1:34:23.880 --> 1:34:27.560]  a suicide. We talked to people, you know, the people that washed his body at the Muslim
[1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:32.440]  Center and been tortured and cut to pieces. And we also know people at TV stations that
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:35.560]  heard the live feeds. When the cops phished him out, they said, oh, this guy's been murdered,
[1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:42.200]  all cut up, hands, legs bound. George Humphries in the studio with us in now, Florida. Police
[1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:47.960]  believe suicide victim is D.C. Madam. She had said on this show that, oh, Dick Cheney
[1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:51.120]  could have been one of my clients, but I'm not going to release that information. I'm
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:55.260]  going to go and fight this in court. And she threatened to release the names of the hundreds
[1:34:55.260 --> 1:34:59.440]  of big clients she had in D.C. And man, they went ahead and convicted her and there's no
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:03.240]  doubt they've murdered her on air in several interviews. And we have a small staff, but
[1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:06.760]  we're going to dig it out. Our listeners can go into the three interviews we had with her.
[1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:10.080]  We had the last one about a month ago. I'm going to air that in the last 30 minutes of
[1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:18.240]  the show today. She was just absolutely clear. I will never commit suicide. I will fight
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:22.280]  this. If I'm convicted, I will not commit suicide. I will never kill myself. And she
[1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:27.200]  made that clear repeatedly. So listeners, go into the YouTube videos, the audios out
[1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:30.840]  there on the web, help us find it, call them to the show, tell us where it is. I got John
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:34.200]  Harmon trying to find it. I think it's the last interview. I got people at the office
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:39.080]  trying to find it. I mean, I want to say again, I am not going to kill myself. I am not going
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:44.480]  to kill myself. George Humphrey, former city council member, economist, author, documentary
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:50.120]  filmmaker. I've been fighting the new old order for 15 plus years. Debra Jean Palfrey,
[1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:54.280]  we just learned right at the end of the last segment is dead. Thanks for coming in.
[1:35:54.280 --> 1:36:00.400]  As always, it's great to be here. For those of you who are afraid to get involved in the
[1:36:00.400 --> 1:36:04.600]  fight against the new world order, because you might be ostracized or you might lose
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:12.160]  some friends, get over it. There are so many vibrant, wonderful, alive people. And just
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:17.280]  in this light, just come into Alex's office. This is the star command. The energy here
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:26.080]  is so great. Alex, it is just such a pleasure to be here. Your passion for life, your passion
[1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:31.720]  for life is so wonderful. You know, sometimes you yell and scream and turn people off. But
[1:36:31.720 --> 1:36:34.760]  you know what? After they listen to you, they get into it.
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:38.360]  Well, people, I mean, people do instinctively know that I'm telling them the truth and they
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:43.760]  check out the facts. And I love life so much. I'm willing to give mine up for other people.
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:47.320]  Well, first of all, you're not going to be giving your life up. You're creating more
[1:36:47.320 --> 1:36:52.880]  life. And by, you know what? There is no defense against the new world order. The only way
[1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:58.440]  to deal with this is to go forward, tell the truth, not be afraid. For those of you who
[1:36:58.440 --> 1:37:03.040]  are out there, there's nothing. I mean, you know, yeah, there are things to be afraid
[1:37:03.040 --> 1:37:07.960]  of, but don't be afraid. If we have it in our intention that we're going to win this
[1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:13.800]  thing, that we're going to turn this country around, is that we're going to restore the
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:18.280]  Constitution and the Republic. And I'm not talking about a utopia. We restore a good
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:24.840]  school system. So we restore the environment. If we restore positive relationships between
[1:37:24.840 --> 1:37:31.000]  the police and the people, and the police actually become peace officers, when we become,
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:35.920]  when we have sovereignty in our country again, we close our borders and we take care of our
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:41.160]  own people. When we start manufacturing in this country again, these are things worth
[1:37:41.160 --> 1:37:42.160]  fighting for.
[1:37:42.160 --> 1:37:45.280]  I want to get into the positive. Yeah, I want to get into the positive area, but I know
[1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:50.640]  that Deborah Jean Palfrey would want us to expose the fact she was murdered. She in fact,
[1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:54.920]  she said to me privately and I know on air that if she committed suicide, it was murder.
[1:37:54.920 --> 1:37:59.920]  She was murdered. She did not kill herself. And I'm telling you, I will never kill myself.
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:03.200]  And look, I'm not afraid of him killing me, but I am afraid of them shooting me in the
[1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:07.120]  back of the head, blowing my brains all over the walls and my family's out of town sometime
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:10.600]  and saying I committed suicide. And I'm going to ask the Austin police or they kill me in
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:15.040]  New York or anywhere else or any other patriot, please don't frame us. I mean, they hit men
[1:38:15.040 --> 1:38:19.000]  come and kill us and then you go along with it. I mean, that is so disgusting, George.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:28.080]  Yeah, absolutely. And I love your bravery. And the fact is to be alive is to fight evil.
[1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:33.720]  And when these son of a guns do stuff like this and they've been doing it for such a
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:38.720]  long time, I mean, they've been doing it for centuries. And just in the last 15 or 20 years,
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:45.120]  you know, Waco, Oklahoma City, TWA flight 800, you know, the list goes on and on. It's
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:51.000]  cold blooded murder. And to be alive is to be in what's in India. They called Dharma
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:58.400]  right action. We have to stand up shoulder to shoulder and not ask or petition, but demand
[1:38:58.400 --> 1:39:03.920]  justice. And just like that fellow, that that fellow who was killed here in Austin not too
[1:39:03.920 --> 1:39:08.120]  long ago, he was a member, he was a Palestinian. I don't know all the facts on that, but I
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:12.760]  have friends who are very good friends of his and they said absolutely 100% he was
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:20.600]  murdered. Oh, no, I mean, they fished him out with just tortured to death and bound hands,
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:24.720]  legs, mouth and the, and the first Austin police. Yeah, it was murdered in the higher
[1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:30.880]  ups. I mean, God, this is, you know, if you, if you have this, there is forensic evidence.
[1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:35.880]  You can't tie your hands up and duct tape yourself and do things like that. So it's
[1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:40.680]  pretty clear that there was foul play and murder on this. And the fact that there is
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:46.560]  not marching in the street, that there is not, that there is just not massive response
[1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:53.480]  to this, to this massive injustice, to this murder, to it's the same thing as King Edward
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:58.680]  the first when he was killing the Scots back in the late 1200s. You know, we need people
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:05.080]  who are brave hearts, people like, you know, people like Alex Jones, but and as importantly
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:11.200]  to the people who are listening to this, have a brave heart and together we can stop this
[1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:15.480]  thing. Well, I want to be clear, George, it's with me, it's not even bravery at my instinctive
[1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:21.400]  spiritual, whatever core I can't control myself. I hate bullies. I hate corrupt tyrants. I
[1:40:21.400 --> 1:40:26.720]  mean, the sterilization, the murder of Africans and Latin Americans and us and all the eugenics
[1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:31.400]  they carry out against us. I mean, they hate life. They, they revel in hurting innocence.
[1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:37.360]  Well, as you probably know, Mahatma Gandhi is one of my heroes and I've spent a lot
[1:40:37.360 --> 1:40:42.880]  of time in India, but even Mahatma Gandhi, who was the king, the prince of nonviolent
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:48.400]  sex, it is better to go to war with a gun in your hand to defend your country than to
[1:40:48.400 --> 1:40:53.560]  be a coward and say you believe in nonviolent civil disobedience. We have to have courage
[1:40:53.560 --> 1:40:58.160]  to stand up against these rascals. Now, it's more sophisticated. I mean, I mean, I'm not
[1:40:58.160 --> 1:41:01.760]  saying you're wrong, but that's one section. It's kind of like the Bible says a time to
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:06.120]  live a time to die a time to fight a time to sew a time to read. You know, you've got
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:09.840]  to know when it's time to hold them know when to fold them know when to walk away know when
[1:41:09.840 --> 1:41:14.040]  to run. I mean, when it was them peacefully being beaten by the British troops, that woke
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:17.080]  up people like George Arwell. He went back and wrote books about it. Right. You know,
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:23.080]  he was one of those folks guys. You know, there's a time for that when they're provocaturing.
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:25.680]  That's why we don't go out and stage terror attacks because they have to do it to blame
[1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:29.640]  it on us. But if they are trying to put us on flatback trucks, take us to FEMA camps,
[1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:33.440]  the preachers are all over saying, turn your guns and go to the camp, take the shot. Then
[1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:39.720]  you don't have a choice. Yeah. Well, by then it's too late and one now is the time we have
[1:41:39.720 --> 1:41:46.240]  the beauty of a little bit of time right now to organize and to first of all to educate
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:53.160]  ourselves. Number one, number two is to create community and and and reaching out to to dozens
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:59.120]  and dozens of other people who feel the same way that you do. And then to take steps to
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:03.640]  get into the government to get to your city council members to get to your county commissioners,
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:08.680]  to talk to your sheriff, to talk to people who are in other positions of power and to
[1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:18.680]  demand not ask, but to demand true justice and to stop this unbelievable, just unbelievable
[1:42:18.680 --> 1:42:25.680]  slave mentality that we are experiencing. Let me talk to John real fast as the network
[1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:30.040]  selectively erases about one out of 20 of my shows and some glitch. Tell me Murphy's
[1:42:30.040 --> 1:42:34.840]  law that that last interview isn't erased. You got it. Good. Are you listening to it?
[1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:41.080]  Does she say that I won't commit suicide? We have that. Can you cue that up place? Oh,
[1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:47.160]  he's transferring it over. Oh, God, I just it's getting so obvious, George. I mean,
[1:42:47.160 --> 1:42:52.840]  it just I've been obvious for for the last 20 years. I mean, it just gets more and more
[1:42:52.840 --> 1:42:59.360]  and more and more and more obvious. The Palestinian schoolteacher, Mr. Hamid. Yeah. No criminal
[1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:04.520]  record been wounded over there protesting in Palestine, giving him school books. Oh,
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:09.080]  he was beloved. No, no. But I've now talked to his neighbors. I've now talked to people
[1:43:09.080 --> 1:43:12.840]  that knew him, talked to his best friend, his treasure. There were Israelis running
[1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:16.880]  around with machine guns talking to neighbors. They wanted him to know they were there. This
[1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:20.080]  is in the weeks before he was killed. Well, I mean, my God, are they going to have like
[1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:25.000]  Israelis shoot me in my yard in front of witnesses? And then the media will say I killed myself.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:29.200]  I mean, how what does it take? Well, they caught they caught a truckload of Israelis
[1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:34.480]  the day after 9 11 in Ohio with plans to blow up a nuclear power plant down in Florida.
[1:43:34.480 --> 1:43:38.040]  They also caught some in Tennessee that caught in Mexico City. And they were here without
[1:43:38.040 --> 1:43:43.800]  permits. They they were on illegal passports. And lo and behold, they got a free trip back
[1:43:43.800 --> 1:43:50.360]  to lovely Israel. Friends, you know, I am not for or against any of the religions. I'm
[1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:55.600]  a friend to all of them and I'm open to Israel. But you know, if you don't understand is that
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:44:01.200]  the Mossad controls this country. It's just a fact. And unless we boot the son of a guns
[1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:05.720]  out, they're going to continue to play their games. Well, I mean, killing people in Austin,
[1:44:05.720 --> 1:44:10.880]  it's just it's out of control. Yeah, it's it's that's why I got death threats that
[1:44:10.880 --> 1:44:15.520]  night. And they went in on my Wikipedia and said I committed suicide on my Wikipedia.
[1:44:15.520 --> 1:44:20.640]  Yeah, you know that for the last 10 12 years, I've been talking to you about the most, you
[1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:25.840]  know, we've been talking together about the Mossad and how unbelievably powerful they
[1:44:25.840 --> 1:44:31.000]  are. No, no, I have never debated. Yeah, you've never debated it. I'm just simply not my
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:35.760]  myopically. Yeah, because a lot of people that are it's easy to get off on a tangent
[1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:40.960]  and think that somebody's anti Jewish or anything like that. And also gives our enemies ways
[1:44:40.960 --> 1:44:44.440]  to twist. Yeah, it's effective just to get the message out about the new order. But since
[1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:47.440]  we bring that up, I want to get back to her. And if it was Eskimos, we'd be saying the
[1:44:47.440 --> 1:44:52.360]  same thing. And the fact is, it's this one group of people from this one, one nation
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:56.440]  and and they have inordinate power in our country. And what they're doing is that they're
[1:44:56.440 --> 1:45:01.600]  just sucking this country dry. Well, I want to expand on that. It's like a people know
[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:07.600]  my analogy on this. So if you have five guys at Robin Bank, okay, and one of them's a German,
[1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:11.680]  one of them's a Jew, one of them's an Italian, one of them's an Eskimo, like you said, one
[1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:21.040]  of them's a Kibler Elf. It doesn't it doesn't give any one group cover to say there are
[1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:26.480]  other groups in the hierarchy. I mean, I mean, how do you square this? And I've got text
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:29.880]  Mars come in tomorrow. I'm going to bring this up to him. He focuses mainly on Israel
[1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:36.160]  now. I think that's important work. I've also got Michael Hoffman on for two hours Friday.
[1:45:36.160 --> 1:45:39.440]  Yeah, focusing on that. I mean, we're bringing these subjects that we always have had text
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:44.200]  Mars. And we've always had and I've always had you on. Yeah, there's no censorship as
[1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:49.200]  others have claimed. I just have a wide show absolutely that that covers a huge spectrum.
[1:45:49.200 --> 1:45:53.880]  But I want to be key. I mean, I want to be very specific on this key point. How do you
[1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:58.320]  square the eugenicists? Because I don't talk. I mean, well, people say that I talk about
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:03.560]  Nazis all the time. Prescott Bush was a Nazi. The Bush senior did run the eugenics program.
[1:46:03.560 --> 1:46:10.360]  They did sign China on for IMF World Bank money to do that. They're they do love Arnold.
[1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:14.240]  So so all I've ever pointed out, and there are people who love Hitler, they email me,
[1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:18.200]  they post the message board, they say, don't talk about Hitler. He was good. I know too
[1:46:18.200 --> 1:46:22.200]  much history. I'm not even talking about skewed histories. I mean, the real history. I mean,
[1:46:22.200 --> 1:46:26.360]  Lord Milner wrote that they set Hitler up out of England to tear Europe up. He didn't
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:32.200]  know that he was a wind up toy. They put the the the communists in all these top globalists
[1:46:32.200 --> 1:46:36.640]  write books. And later they get declassified or in policy reports or Carnegie Endowment
[1:46:36.640 --> 1:46:41.280]  documents that they are in control of all the groups, just like this top globalist puts
[1:46:41.280 --> 1:46:46.120]  a book out saying we run all the major groups. So so then it doesn't even become about this
[1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:52.600]  group or that group, just the entire power structure is run. But is Israel hyper dominant?
[1:46:52.600 --> 1:46:57.880]  Is it one of the top three, you know, all penultimate? It's like co equal power with
[1:46:57.880 --> 1:47:04.280]  the the British Anglo-American power axis, which is basically Rothschild run. Is that
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:10.160]  merged in with this whole I mean, it's an amalgamation of this Germanic death cult Illuminati, whatever,
[1:47:10.160 --> 1:47:14.200]  which goes back to Kabbalah itself and that back to Egypt. And we've had the top experts
[1:47:14.200 --> 1:47:20.880]  like Hoffman on about this. And so for me, it's that it's that Egyptian dark magic system,
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:23.440]  whether you believe that or not, that's what they believe George Humphrey.
[1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:28.040]  Well, you've brought up just a ton of issues and we just don't have the time to go into
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:31.400]  it and being very articulate. But I mean, I'm not supposed to talk about
[1:47:31.400 --> 1:47:36.040]  how Hitler did did satanic rituals when it's admitted. I'm not supposed to say that there's
[1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:40.120]  a cult going on a Bohemian Grove. There's cults all over. And that's my point is that
[1:47:40.120 --> 1:47:44.720]  there's more to it. Yeah, you know, there's another level. I mean, why did Henry Ford,
[1:47:44.720 --> 1:47:49.800]  why did the IBM, why is IBM funding all this now when they were Nazis? I'm just saying
[1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:55.160]  why did the Zionist fund Hitler and do deals with him? You see, I'm saying there's there's
[1:47:55.160 --> 1:47:59.480]  another level. Oh, there's so many, there's so many levels.
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:05.920]  And that's why information is so important and just to keep digging and digging and digging.
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:11.760]  And again, I don't care whether they're Eskimos or, you know, from, but yeah, but specifically,
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:16.720]  yeah, it is, it is true to say that the Nazis almost over through the U.S. in the thirties
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:20.160]  and Smedley Butler, two tongue congressional medal, honor winner went public and exposed
[1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:26.760]  it. But, but that wasn't the Nazis. That was the Anglo-American eugenicist, which the Rothschilds
[1:48:26.760 --> 1:48:31.360]  contribute to. That's what I'm saying is that Hitler, the evidence is, was a grandson of
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:34.600]  a Rothschild. Well, they're saying there's there's another level here, George. Well,
[1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:40.480]  they're collectivist, whether they're communist or fascist or they're collectivist. And no
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:46.240]  matter what the name is that there are these group of people who want to centralize power
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:52.440]  under their chosen people and to control us. And that's why we're here. That's why we're
[1:48:52.440 --> 1:48:55.960]  fighting this stuff. That's why we're exposing it's true, whether it's the Zionist or the
[1:48:55.960 --> 1:49:00.480]  Nazis or the British royal family, they all believe they have the super genes. They're
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:05.000]  the master race. They, Old Testament, we need to go in and commit genocide to take over
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:10.880]  the promised land. And, and just like exactly that's what we're dealing with here.
[1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:19.520]  Well, that, I mean, that's why we're here. And I'll tell you what, with this radio interview
[1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:23.120]  that you have on this woman, I think it's really going to put a good spin on. And I
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:28.760]  sure hope that we can get some national publication on this thing because she just like John Tower.
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:32.880]  John Tower was killed. You know, that's one of the things that most people in Texas are
[1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:33.880]  not aware.
[1:49:33.880 --> 1:49:34.880]  They blew his plane up.
[1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:37.880]  They sure did. And they blew his buddy's plane up two days before. I mean, this guy
[1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:47.080]  is a 24 year old, 24 year senior U.S. Senator and he, and he was absolutely assassinated
[1:49:47.080 --> 1:49:51.440]  and it got three minutes on national news and it was put away. You know, most Texans
[1:49:51.440 --> 1:49:57.400]  have no idea that their own United States Senator was assassinated. Just like most people
[1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:01.960]  in Minnesota don't know that Paul Wellstone was assassinated. Friends, you know, as,
[1:50:01.960 --> 1:50:06.800]  as Alex is saying, this stuff is very, very, very serious. You know, they've got the velvet
[1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:11.600]  glove on and, but they're, they're starting to take the velvet glove off and it's time
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:12.800]  to wake up to this.
[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:16.000]  Well, I just want to say this. We need to list all the globalists, have their names
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:20.760]  out there so they can be punished for what they've done. And, you know, they're losing
[1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:24.160]  their soft power. And there was a reason they're older, more sophisticated British
[1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:27.920]  ancestors had soft power. You guys really want to get into a hot war. It's not going
[1:50:27.920 --> 1:50:29.840]  to be pretty.
[1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:32.760]  So Alex, do you think we're going to bomb Iran in the next couple of weeks?
[1:50:32.760 --> 1:50:36.320]  I don't know. I've got a guest actually coming up in the fourth hour to talk about that,
[1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:40.760]  but let's get your take on the other side. Debra Jean Palfrey, the DC madam said here
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:44.600]  that she would ever commit suicide that if she dies, they would murder her. Well, they've
[1:50:44.600 --> 1:50:51.360]  murdered her. We're going to have got that audio coming up. Stay with us.
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:55.440]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:51:00.240]  sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern
[1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:04.560]  history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:08.360]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:12.880]  a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the info

[1:51:53.760 --> 1:51:58.320]  the high price of gasoline. It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor even though we're
[1:51:58.320 --> 1:52:02.880]  paying record prices at the pump. I have run across a company called SFR who has developed
[1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:08.160]  two products that improve gas mileage. Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean
[1:52:08.160 --> 1:52:13.320]  your injection system, protect a complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new
[1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:17.960]  engine condition, improving mileage and only one tank full. Protect a engine treatment not
[1:52:17.960 --> 1:52:22.440]  only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine. Let's face it. With the
[1:52:22.440 --> 1:52:26.480]  high price of gasoline, it's time to take action. Purchase a protective fuel system
[1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:33.280]  treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.

[1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:56.800]  they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper. They swear an oath to
[1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:01.960]  follow it and then they reject it. That was their employment document. They haven't followed
[1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:06.880]  it. Congressman, Senators, you're fired. Washington, you're fired. I think it's the next freedom
[1:53:06.880 --> 1:53:11.200]  to fascism. Washington, you're fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our
[1:53:11.200 --> 1:53:15.360]  current political system and it gives a voice to Americans across the country. Washington,
[1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:19.560]  you're fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster, the
[1:53:19.560 --> 1:53:24.680]  president's illegal spy program in essay data mining, FISA secret court, the illegal wiretapping
[1:53:24.680 --> 1:53:28.720]  of millions of Americans and the last seven years of terror related spy bills, how they
[1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:33.320]  affect you and what you can do about it. Washington, you're fired captures the spirit and zest
[1:53:33.320 --> 1:53:38.120]  of an old fashioned Boston Tea Party. Ken Williams describes the film as a rabble rousing call
[1:53:38.120 --> 1:53:42.720]  to arms. We invite you to make the change with us. Help take back our government now.

[1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:50.760]  have a plan to take back our government. Please visit takebackwashington.com.
[1:53:50.760 --> 1:54:02.120]  We're going to get into Iran. We're going to do that in the next segment. This is a short
[1:54:02.120 --> 1:54:10.360]  segment right now with George Humphrey, fairlove.com, filmmaker, multi-time author. But right now,
[1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:15.320]  I want to play Deborah Jean Palfrey. This is her on the show. What was the date on this,
[1:54:15.320 --> 1:54:22.920]  John? The last interview with her March 13th. Oh, eight. So this is recent. Yeah. This is
[1:54:22.920 --> 1:54:27.400]  like a month and a half ago and it's now May 1st and she's really committed suicide on
[1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:32.920]  May 1st. And folks, they've got a microwave residence systems where mama's out. She's
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:36.760]  with mama. They hit her for 10 seconds. She's dead. They got stuff where they can walk up
[1:54:36.760 --> 1:54:40.920]  and pat you on the shoulder and you're dead. They got little bit of microdarts that dissolve.
[1:54:40.920 --> 1:54:44.920]  You think a mosquito bite you and you die. They had that 30 years ago. They had declassified
[1:54:44.920 --> 1:54:50.120]  in the 70s by the 50s, fast acting cancers that kill you in a month. I mean, they have
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:55.160]  got it all. Let's go ahead and play the clip of her that clearly murdered ladies and gentlemen.
[1:54:55.160 --> 1:54:59.560]  Here it is. Well, the fact that you're so visible really protects you going on Larry King and other
[1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:03.960]  big shows. But you want to put it on record that you're not planning to commit suicide?
[1:55:03.960 --> 1:55:09.240]  No, I'm not planning to commit suicide. I'm planning to go into court on April 7th. Indeed,
[1:55:09.240 --> 1:55:15.800]  we do have the trial and I plan on defending myself vigorously and I plan on exposing the government
[1:55:17.720 --> 1:55:23.080]  in ways that, you know, I do not think they want me to expose them. I want them to explain to me
[1:55:23.080 --> 1:55:28.280]  in open court why they came after me. How does the FBI do this? They know you had a bunch of,
[1:55:28.280 --> 1:55:33.240]  you know, government and cabinet and White House and Defense Department people and they don't go
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:37.960]  after any of them. They go after you and then instead of just dropping and leaving you alone,
[1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:44.760]  they've made a huge mess out of this because what I think happened is that they used me.
[1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:48.600]  I was a hunting ground. I keep using that term because I think it's so applicable. I was a
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:53.560]  hunting ground. They thought I had something perhaps. They were watching me for years. Again,
[1:55:53.560 --> 1:55:56.760]  they were not watching me for a few months. They were watching me for anywhere from two and a half
[1:55:56.760 --> 1:56:03.160]  to six years. I was a very routine person. All of a sudden, here I go and I abruptly quit the
[1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:07.720]  business. Now, if you're watching me from afar, this could be very, in a very Hoover-esque like
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:12.680]  fashion. This could be very alarming. She shuts down the business. She's selling her house. She's
[1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:17.640]  moving. Oh my God, what's going on? They've come flying out here to California and it was
[1:56:17.640 --> 1:56:23.880]  tipped off by the way by a wire transfer from my bank. That's right. That's why I spy on everybody.
[1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:29.400]  Final segment with our guest, she's the DC Madame Jean Palfrey. We'll be right back. This goes deep.
[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:34.920]  It does go deep and at the end of the show today, I'm going to air the whole interview. It's about
[1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:39.320]  20 minutes long and over the next few weeks, I will air the other two lengthy, hour-long
[1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:44.520]  interviews with Deborah Jean Palfrey unless the network's erased them again, but not John's fault
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:50.120]  though. I mean, so much is going on. So much is happening and I think in that same interview,
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:53.960]  see if you can find it, John. He's just a superstar. He does job at 10 guys. See if you
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:56:59.800]  can find it where I said, you know, Dick Cheney and she says, maybe Dick Cheney and she had said,
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:03.320]  I'm going to release the big names of your hypocrites and send me to jail and I guarantee
[1:57:03.320 --> 1:57:07.400]  you they had her house bug. They had her phone bug. They had her mom's house bug. They use your
[1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:11.080]  cell phone to listen to even when it's off. And the minute she said, I'm going to go public,
[1:57:11.080 --> 1:57:16.120]  the minute she said that, that's the type of thing that we get a helicopter to come in here
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:20.040]  and shoot rockets into this office. And it wouldn't matter what the, what the people across the
[1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:24.200]  street saw. The government does stuff like that. Say if Palfrey, this is kind of dangerous stuff
[1:57:24.200 --> 1:57:30.280]  out here. This is what will get me killed if anything ever does. Palfrey calls here, decides
[1:57:30.280 --> 1:57:35.480]  to go on air with the big names. Okay. They would have a hit team in route to kill her.
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:38.360]  And they were unable to kill her before she went on the show and they'd gun her down.
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:41.800]  What do you matter? They'd say a gang did it. They would cut the power off at my office.
[1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:47.000]  And then if I had been told by her what it was, they would just run over me in the street,
[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:50.840]  you know, cops jump out black uniforms, shoot me, wouldn't matter. The news would say I shot
[1:57:50.840 --> 1:57:56.120]  myself in the front parking lot. They don't care anymore. George Humphrey. Well, it must be remembered
[1:57:56.120 --> 1:58:00.760]  this is going way, way, way back. It's, it's pretty evident that they did the same thing to
[1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:05.160]  Marilyn Monroe is that she was having a lot of trouble and she was going to go public. And now
[1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:11.400]  there's a black and white film that's a commit confirmed with a man. Sodomizer. Yeah. And also
[1:58:11.400 --> 1:58:14.360]  they're using that to blackmail the candidates that there are several women that have been
[1:58:14.360 --> 1:58:20.760]  associated with Bill Clinton who also arc-asided themselves. So this is nothing new and it just
[1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:26.600]  but it's, it's today and it's right now and it needs to stop. Well, the Arkinsides, I mean,
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:34.440]  they cut your arms, legs and head off and say you killed yourself. Yeah. You are listening to GCN.

[1:58:49.720 --> 1:58:56.760]  world government. It's known as the builder bird. But their objective being world domination. For
[1:58:56.760 --> 1:59:02.600]  thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[1:59:02.600 --> 1:59:07.080]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:10.040 --> 1:59:15.480]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[1:59:39.960 --> 1:59:49.160]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:59:55.720 --> 2:00:04.760]  Government coverups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:00:04.760 --> 2:00:15.960]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:33.000]  Debra Jean, pal, free headline prisonplanet.com exclusive DC.
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:38.440]  Madam predicted she would be suicided. Rape beating, maiming, disfigurement, and more than
[2:00:38.440 --> 2:00:43.320]  like we murder. Disguise in the form of just another jailhouse accident or suicide would
[2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:49.080]  await me. So not only did she say here that they might kill her or that she would never
[2:00:49.080 --> 2:00:54.680]  commit suicide. She said it in writings. You've taken into custody. My physical safety most
[2:00:54.680 --> 2:00:59.880]  probably my very life would be in jeopardy. She wrote in 91. Okay, it just goes on folks.
[2:00:59.880 --> 2:01:05.080]  Bottom line. She and I want the government to know.
[2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:09.960]  I know you got the phones all tapped. So it doesn't matter. You have recordings of it.
[2:01:11.800 --> 2:01:16.760]  She never told me that she had sex with Dick Cheney. She implied that to the media. She implied
[2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:20.040]  that here. She said she might bring it out if they didn't leave her alone. It was hypocritical.
[2:01:20.840 --> 2:01:23.800]  We know there's already senators and other people she was with in the heads of, you know,
[2:01:23.800 --> 2:01:31.720]  agencies. But you know that she sent women to it's just unbelievable. So we just played that clip
[2:01:31.720 --> 2:01:34.920]  before earlier. We'll play more of the interview coming up. George, I want to get into Iran and
[2:01:34.920 --> 2:01:39.480]  a bunch of other issues, but this is big. This is breaking. Also want to talk about this globalist
[2:01:39.480 --> 2:01:43.880]  writing a big book, former head of Kissinger Associates has very high power, as you know,
[2:01:43.880 --> 2:01:47.240]  saying, yeah, we run things. We're going to take the internet away from you. Just as I said,
[2:01:47.240 --> 2:01:50.840]  they went with internet to the ways they're going to do it. We're going to take your freedoms. We're
[2:01:50.840 --> 2:01:55.560]  militarizing the police. We're getting rid of the US global government. It's already here.
[2:01:55.560 --> 2:02:00.760]  There's nothing you can do about it. 6,000 of us rule you. It's all over. You want to comment on that?
[2:02:02.280 --> 2:02:06.920]  I could talk all day and all tomorrow and for the next week about what you're talking about.
[2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:11.880]  I want to thank you for having G Edward Griffin on your show the other day,
[2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:17.720]  and he was here in town the other day, and he is another fine, fine gentleman who is talking about
[2:02:17.720 --> 2:02:26.040]  and informing people in very, very intelligent and clear ways about the reality of what is going on
[2:02:26.040 --> 2:02:31.480]  and providing us, just like you are, ways that we as individuals, instead of feeling
[2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:37.640]  disempowered or disconnected, can make a difference. One thing that is so important
[2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:43.160]  is that each and every person listening is a part of this puzzle, and either you're part of the
[2:02:43.160 --> 2:02:47.880]  solution or part of the problem, and every person listening, no matter what your race, your color,
[2:02:47.880 --> 2:02:53.480]  or how much money you got in your pocket, you can and will make a difference, and we have to come
[2:02:53.480 --> 2:03:00.600]  together right now. They always talk about the Mayan calendars 2012, and I don't know how much
[2:03:00.600 --> 2:03:06.440]  stock I put into that. It's a nice symbology, but if you look at the Gregorian, the changes
[2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:12.840]  that Pope Gregory made, 2012 is right now. We're right in the middle of it on a symbolic level.
[2:03:12.840 --> 2:03:20.600]  The Shinola has hit the fan, folks. Hillary Clinton running for president says that she's
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:27.640]  the peace candidate, but that she wants to up the war in Afghanistan. We just had more casualties
[2:03:27.640 --> 2:03:35.240]  in Iraq this last month than we have for last year. It is very, very obvious that the crazies
[2:03:35.240 --> 2:03:41.000]  that are controlling the White House right now are doing everything that they can to create a
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:46.760]  situation in which we go in right now in the next couple of weeks in Bob Moran. I don't think it's
[2:03:46.760 --> 2:03:53.480]  going to happen because I don't even think that they're insane minds that they're going to do it
[2:03:53.480 --> 2:03:58.360]  because they don't have the troops, and even if you level Tehran, they're not going to give up,
[2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:05.720]  and Tehran is a very, very different deal. It's three times larger than Iraq. There's many more
[2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:10.680]  people in their Persians instead of Arabs, and they're much better educated people, and there
[2:04:10.680 --> 2:04:17.960]  would, there is no way in the world. And besides that, both China and Russia, both China and Russia,
[2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:24.600]  both of which have the big one, have been getting real, real close with Tehran in the last year
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:31.800]  and a half. And I'll tell you what, Putin is an amazing guy. He is really standing up to push
[2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:36.680]  these last, these last couple years. Even though the Carnegie Endowment on peace basically runs
[2:04:36.680 --> 2:04:43.000]  Russia, I think there's another level to it. There's levels within levels. Say what? On my streams,
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:46.840]  we're going to just continue at infowars.com. We'll be right back for everybody else in three minutes.

[2:05:49.400 --> 2:05:53.800]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease,
[2:05:53.800 --> 2:05:58.920]  such as cancer or diabetes? Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink,
[2:05:58.920 --> 2:06:03.640]  the environment, and our high stress lifestyles. It's these choices that cause decreased energy,
[2:06:03.640 --> 2:06:08.680]  weight gain, and eventually disease. The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by
[2:06:08.680 --> 2:06:14.520]  drinking alkaline ionized water. At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers

[2:08:00.600 --> 2:08:08.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:08:08.840 --> 2:08:18.280]  Look at the size of that thing. Cut the chatter red too. Lock your ex foils in attack position
[2:08:18.280 --> 2:08:23.960]  when I cut across their axes and draw their fire. Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting the new
[2:08:23.960 --> 2:08:28.840]  world order. They're killing us left and right, but they're getting exposed all over the world.
[2:08:28.840 --> 2:08:39.160]  Major issues are developing everywhere. News is coming in so fast. Brandy
[2:08:39.160 --> 2:08:52.040]  Britton found dead in her Baltimore home. Brandy Britton, she worked for Palfrey.
[2:08:52.040 --> 2:09:00.280]  No, I know. Oh my God. The lady that worked that we called to set up the interview that worked for
[2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:09.000]  Palfrey's dead. They killed her. I mean, they'll be killing all her girls. They'll be shooting
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:14.200]  them, throwing them off bridges in the cowardly yuppies out here. They'll say, oh no, it's quite
[2:09:14.200 --> 2:09:20.920]  normal. Brandy Britton found dead in her Baltimore home. Alexis is sophisticated, refined, educated,
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:27.240]  and articulate. This may be Dick Cheney's girl. God, man. She has two bachelors of science.
[2:09:27.240 --> 2:09:30.600]  I just said earlier in the last hour, get ready for them to kill a bunch of people.
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:37.080]  Remember Jack Ruby is that six or seven of the girls who worked in his strip club
[2:09:37.640 --> 2:09:43.480]  mysteriously suicide themselves within a year after the Kennedy assassination. So again,
[2:09:43.480 --> 2:09:49.400]  this is nothing new. This is one more part in the chain of the evil that is going on.
[2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:54.360]  And I really appreciate what you're doing, Alex. But she'd been convicted. I guarantee you, she
[2:09:54.360 --> 2:09:57.160]  was trying to get out of the country, keep her mouth shut. I guess they just got to tie up loose
[2:09:57.160 --> 2:10:02.520]  ends. I wonder how many girls they're going to kill. Jeez, man, they're so evil. But to them,
[2:10:02.520 --> 2:10:08.280]  it's war. I mean, they kill a million Iraqis. Why not kill these girls? Alexis is sophisticated,
[2:10:08.280 --> 2:10:11.160]  refined. Oh, by the way, you think you're going to get away with this? You're all losing your
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:14.440]  pension funds. They're going to take everything you got. By giving into these guys, you let them
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:19.080]  win. They're going to have their way with you now. I am just blown away right now. Let me read
[2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:24.280]  this. Alexis is sophisticated, refined, educated, and articulate. She has two bachelor's degrees
[2:10:24.280 --> 2:10:29.480]  of science, one in biology and the other in sociology. She is holds a PhD from an elite
[2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:40.920]  university. Oh, yeah, she killed herself a few months ago. That's right. Yeah, that's right.
[2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:44.200]  Same thing. They're getting rid of the loose ends. And this is the one that Palfrey was
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:53.400]  hinting was with Cheney. We'll see what happens. You know, I've forgotten about her killing
[2:10:53.400 --> 2:10:57.960]  herself in suspicious circumstances. Well, I know you've had Kathy O'Brien on your show before.
[2:10:57.960 --> 2:11:02.920]  Yes. And Kathy O'Brien for 15 years has been talking about this in her book,
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:06.840]  Transformation Over America. Yeah, Cheney likes women. He's one of the few in the guild, you know,
[2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:12.840]  that's, you know, he won't touch men. No, he likes to rape women and break their jaws.
[2:11:12.840 --> 2:11:15.720]  This is his favorite thing, reporting according to her.
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:20.680]  And for those of you who have not read the book, Transformation Over America,
[2:11:20.680 --> 2:11:24.280]  it is one of the saddest books that you will ever read, but it is one of the most
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:27.400]  education. And by the way, when I snuck in the grove, I didn't believe, and then I got other
[2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:31.480]  pieces later. What she's saying fits with stuff that only you'd have to be in there to know.
[2:11:32.440 --> 2:11:37.320]  And at the, you know, I've been at the grove also, and you know that little hotel right outside
[2:11:37.320 --> 2:11:41.400]  there, that's where they keep all the prostitutes that they used to bring in there. And then they
[2:11:41.400 --> 2:11:45.080]  would snuff. In Monterey, the little town right outside. Yeah, and they would keep them there,
[2:11:45.080 --> 2:11:50.440]  and then when they got too old, they'd snuff them. You know, I mean, this, this is, unfortunately,
[2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:57.960]  it's, it's, it's sad, but it's true. And the fact is that this is the only radio station that I
[2:11:57.960 --> 2:12:02.520]  show that I know that is talking about this stuff as clearly, and there's a few others,
[2:12:02.520 --> 2:12:05.320]  you know, that are doing it. And I really appreciate it. But they mainly obsess on one
[2:12:05.320 --> 2:12:10.040]  issue or the other. Well, you know, anybody who has the courage to talk about this stuff is,
[2:12:10.040 --> 2:12:14.680]  is, you know, it's just got tremendous courage because the truth has to come out.
[2:12:14.680 --> 2:12:20.040]  Well, here's the deal. These same guys are the ones who are genetically modifying everything,
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:24.920]  already giving rise to super bacteria, super viruses. They're the ones causing so much destruction,
[2:12:24.920 --> 2:12:30.360]  super weapons. And in their writings, they say we are nihilistic, we are destructive,
[2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:36.600]  we are killers. Well, they're vampires. They have a vampire. They have separation consciousness,
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:41.160]  and they believe that the only way they get power is by taking the energy or the power of
[2:12:41.160 --> 2:12:46.040]  somebody else. And quite clearly, anybody who really is in connection with source or God,
[2:12:46.040 --> 2:12:51.160]  or whatever you want to call it, the creative energy knows that there is infinite source out
[2:12:51.160 --> 2:12:56.120]  there and there's infinite, you know, prosperity and health and love for these people. Damn that
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:13:00.840]  up. They hold it all. Absolutely. And what they are doing is that they're doing everything they
[2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:07.000]  can through the food, through our education system, through the media to cut us off from the
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:14.200]  reality that we are divine beings, that we are spiritual beings having a human experience,
[2:13:14.200 --> 2:13:19.240]  and they want us to believe that we're human beings having an occasional spiritual experience.
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:24.760]  And through the change of the food, through the fluoride, through the chemtrails,
[2:13:24.760 --> 2:13:30.600]  through the insane television set, through this insanity with football, and I love football,
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:36.360]  but this constant destruction of the consciousness of the people of this world, not just in the
[2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:40.920]  United States, but throughout this whole world, they are making the people slaves,
[2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:46.280]  and they're doing a heck of a good job at it. Absolutely. We're not going to take it. I mean,
[2:13:46.280 --> 2:13:52.840]  you know, the tide has changed. They know it. They can feel it. The momentum has changed. People,
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:58.520]  you know, 15 years ago, you talk about this stuff, and people, they look at you, you're crazy. 10
[2:13:58.520 --> 2:14:04.680]  years ago, they'd get in your face and be so mad. Now, wherever I go, ever I go, people are coming
[2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:09.400]  and talking to me. They're sharing information. They're bringing me stories. They're sharing
[2:14:09.400 --> 2:14:15.320]  this information with their friends and their family, and because we have the objective information
[2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:21.640]  and because we are supporting the universal law that all human beings are part of this creation,
[2:14:21.640 --> 2:14:26.760]  and that this world, and this culture, and this thing called our Constitutional Republic,
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:32.920]  are worth preserving. They are. I actually had my news article in here that Paul Watson wrote
[2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:37.400]  about this top globalist head of the Kissinger Group, where he just comes out and he admits
[2:14:37.400 --> 2:14:44.040]  everything, but it was here in my stack. But while I'm finding that, one example of how
[2:14:44.040 --> 2:14:50.120]  this huge awakening is taking place is Ron Paul's book comes out today and is number one on Amazon.
[2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:53.880]  By the way, we sell it at InfoWars if you want to support us to have the book there discounted
[2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:59.960]  with some other things. But, you know, I'm so freaked out by what's happening, so focused,
[2:14:59.960 --> 2:15:05.000]  really. Not even freaked out, isn't the word, so focused. Now, I get more and more focused every day
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:08.040]  that I don't even spend time plugging my books and videos and things we sell.
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:12.280]  A, that supports us, but B, more importantly, these are powerful films, whether it's Washington,
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:17.880]  You're Fired, that we carry discounted, or this is even available yet until the end of the month,
[2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:21.880]  but it's available here. We have it, American Drug War that I consulted on that I'm in,
[2:15:21.880 --> 2:15:24.040]  exposing how they bring the drugs in and how it's all a big scam.
[2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:33.800]  And this is starting to come out. This is starting to happen. Here is the story,
[2:15:33.800 --> 2:15:37.720]  Elita's Blueprint for World Government Revealed. I'm going to put this up on
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:43.320]  the document cam for everybody. And you can see the cover of the book here. If you're watching on
[2:15:43.320 --> 2:15:53.000]  www.prisonplanet.tv right now, you can see the cover of the book and it's got the globe with a
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:59.160]  key attached to it. Hard to talk and run the studio here. I'm getting better at it though.
[2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:06.280]  Super Class is the name of the book. And this is the head of Kissinger Associates,
[2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:11.160]  one of the head guys at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, which causes war. And in here,
[2:16:11.160 --> 2:16:15.160]  they just come right out and say, we're taking your freedom. We're going to take the web.
[2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:18.760]  We're going to take your property. We're going to rule you. We're going to get rid of your
[2:16:18.760 --> 2:16:24.840]  country. He's due process. And he goes and gives interviews basically saying, but it's a good idea
[2:16:24.840 --> 2:16:30.040]  because we're the 6,000 experts and we know best. Show your comments on David Rothkoff.
[2:16:31.800 --> 2:16:39.880]  This is just one more of dozens and dozens of examples going back to Adam Weishoff in 1776,
[2:16:39.880 --> 2:16:46.120]  going through Marx and Engels, going through Albert Pike, going through Lenin and Stalin,
[2:16:46.120 --> 2:16:53.720]  and going through all the socialists and the communists and the collectivists and now what
[2:16:53.720 --> 2:16:58.680]  we call the ultra-capitalists, which are not capitalists all the time. They're monopoly
[2:16:58.680 --> 2:17:04.760]  capitalists and it's a cabal of people. Kissinger has been, we've got dozens and dozens of things
[2:17:04.760 --> 2:17:11.640]  from Rothschild and Kissinger and from the Rockefeller saying the exact same thing.
[2:17:13.800 --> 2:17:20.040]  I became aware of this not only in my mind and my intellect, but my heart and my whole being
[2:17:20.840 --> 2:17:28.360]  15 years ago. And so I am fully aware of this. And the fact is, is that these people are living
[2:17:28.360 --> 2:17:34.120]  in separation consciousness. They consider human life to be trivial. They consider only
[2:17:34.120 --> 2:17:39.240]  theirs themselves and their own family to be of value. And that's a key point. Once you can
[2:17:39.240 --> 2:17:44.680]  decide to kill a million Iraqis, bomb them, once Madeline Albright in an NBC interview can say,
[2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:48.840]  yeah, 700,000 dead Iraqi kids in the last... Was it worth it? And she said, yep.
[2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:53.880]  It's worth it. But if it's her kids, she's not going to say that. And see, they tell us there's
[2:17:53.880 --> 2:17:58.200]  no morals. They tell us nothing matters. They tell us they don't have to follow the rules, but we do.
[2:17:58.840 --> 2:18:03.400]  This is just an elitist argument they use. They're absolute scum. And here's the deal.
[2:18:03.400 --> 2:18:09.800]  I want the viewers to know this. It's either us or them. And here's the problem. A normal person,
[2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:14.600]  a good person, loves other people, does some wrong things, gets competitive, but feels guilty
[2:18:14.600 --> 2:18:19.160]  about it, has that connection to everybody else, understands we're all interconnected. That's why
[2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:22.120]  you don't want to do something bad to somebody. It's because you feel like you're doing it to
[2:18:22.120 --> 2:18:27.640]  yourself because in the law of the universe you are. But these people are a cancer. They grow.
[2:18:27.640 --> 2:18:32.440]  They control. They metastasize. They think they're winning. They're really an anathema. They're really
[2:18:32.440 --> 2:18:38.040]  a malfunction. They're really like any matter in the rest of this universe. And to them,
[2:18:38.040 --> 2:18:42.120]  I mean, it means nothing to kill people. It means nothing to kill women. It means nothing to rape
[2:18:42.120 --> 2:18:48.120]  children. To them, raping a child is like eating a hamburger. It's an inanimate object for them.
[2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:53.800]  It's screaming. It's pain. It's about their power. And they've just convinced you and conned you to
[2:18:53.800 --> 2:18:59.160]  not care. And they've shown you and glorified murderers and torturers on TV so you would fantasize
[2:18:59.160 --> 2:19:04.520]  along with them so you would accept their activities to make our atmosphere the way their
[2:19:04.520 --> 2:19:09.640]  atmosphere is. You see, they are seducing us all into evil because they need to have us go along
[2:19:09.640 --> 2:19:14.200]  with it to be able to carry it out. And so this is life and death. All of you out there watching
[2:19:14.200 --> 2:19:18.920]  need to know this is absolute life and death. They are coming down. They are poisoning you.
[2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:22.600]  They are carrying out eugenics against you. And we're going to just keep talking during this
[2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:26.680]  four minute break if you're an info wars.com listener or if you're watching us right now
[2:19:26.680 --> 2:19:32.920]  on prisonplanet.tv. We'll be back in four minutes on the main radio networks. Stay with us. Last

[2:19:48.600 --> 2:19:53.880]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future,
[2:19:53.880 --> 2:19:59.640]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Builder Bird.
[2:20:00.600 --> 2:20:05.960]  Could their objective be world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:20:06.600 --> 2:20:12.600]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[2:20:12.600 --> 2:20:20.840]  of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government
[2:20:20.840 --> 2:20:26.200]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:20:26.200 --> 2:20:29.960]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.
[2:20:29.960 --> 2:20:33.160]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. Yes,

[2:21:52.440 --> 2:21:58.520]  long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely

[2:22:51.640 --> 2:22:57.080]  deficiency. That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling, because fruits and
[2:22:57.080 --> 2:23:01.880]  vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than have heated. The

[2:23:46.440 --> 2:23:59.400]  There's a woman in the street. She's got a baby in her hand. She wants another hit.
[2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:40.440]  Final segment with George Humphrey. Then we're going to get into some really serious issues
[2:24:40.440 --> 2:24:48.040]  with global water, the climate, what's happening, and then we've got Professor Michelle Chasadoski
[2:24:48.040 --> 2:24:52.360]  on his view. Will we be attacking Iran? What's the globalist next move? What does he think of the
[2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:58.520]  three major candidates? And I'm going to air in the last 30 minutes to the Barbra Jean Palfrey
[2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:04.120]  clip. One of the girls that worked for her that reportedly was visiting with somebody at the
[2:25:04.120 --> 2:25:18.360]  White House. She killed herself, especially now Deborah Jean Palfrey, who said she would never
[2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:24.040]  kill herself is dead. We've got about four minutes left and other things you think need
[2:25:24.040 --> 2:25:27.640]  to be covered. Other things we should go over George Humphrey. Well, I think the most important
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:33.480]  thing is that the people who are listening to this show are committed to the Republic.
[2:25:33.480 --> 2:25:37.560]  They're committed to peace. They're committed to justice. They're committed to doing things the
[2:25:37.560 --> 2:25:46.200]  right way into their families. And to do so, we have to go from fear consciousness to a consciousness
[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:52.520]  that being totally aware of your own personal power. Because no matter how much information you
[2:25:52.520 --> 2:25:57.320]  know, if you consider yourself, if you think of yourself a victim, if you keep watching the
[2:25:57.320 --> 2:26:02.840]  television, if you keep believing the race between McCain and Hillary and Obama is the real thing,
[2:26:02.840 --> 2:26:09.720]  if you keep watching about whether Bernanke is raising or lowering, and I follow the economics
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:17.160]  all day long, but the whole situation out there is an illusion. And if we really want to restore
[2:26:17.160 --> 2:26:23.160]  this country, if we want to clean up this environment, we have to come together in groups. We have to
[2:26:23.160 --> 2:26:29.560]  create community. And even though there's more people in this world than there ever has been,
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:34.920]  there's less and less community. There's more and more fear. As the kids are, you know,
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:41.000]  spending so much time going on my space in the computer, you know, they're meeting people
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:45.240]  through the computer instead of just walking down the street and meeting their neighbors.
[2:26:45.240 --> 2:26:52.280]  And we have to realize that God did not, does not, and did not create junk. Each and every one of us
[2:26:52.280 --> 2:27:00.200]  is a powerful, powerful soul. And that this day and time in this moment is key in the evolution
[2:27:00.200 --> 2:27:05.880]  of this world. And who knows what the results are. If we continue to be victims, if we continue to
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:10.360]  be slaves. Well, I want to be clear. Yes. You need to choose to be in control of your own destiny,
[2:27:10.360 --> 2:27:14.200]  which is what God, the credit of the universe, and even if you don't believe in God, everybody knows
[2:27:14.760 --> 2:27:18.920]  you should be in control of your own destiny. The New Order lies and says it's all science,
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:22.520]  it's all chemicals. You have no free will. That's bull. They know you've got free will.
[2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:27.400]  Yeah. They want to create a materialistic, secular agency where they program us. But,
[2:27:27.400 --> 2:27:31.160]  but that's the key here. Even if they kill me or set me up or put me in prison or do that,
[2:27:31.160 --> 2:27:34.920]  which you're not going to do, which they're not going to pray for us. The point is,
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:40.440]  is that we win because we made the decision to put ourself in the way of the fist and we know
[2:27:40.440 --> 2:27:45.640]  striking us down will make us more powerful than they can possibly imagine. And they know that.
[2:27:45.640 --> 2:27:49.960]  Okay. They know that. They're afraid it'll come out that Cheney's got, you know, hookers. Yeah.
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:53.560]  And that's why they're having to kill these women. The point is they, they are scared.
[2:27:53.560 --> 2:27:57.640]  They are weak. They are bad. And in Cheney's old news now, I mean, I mean, yeah, they're
[2:27:57.640 --> 2:28:01.720]  moving on. They're just cleaning up some loose ends. Yeah, they're just cleaning up loose ends.
[2:28:01.720 --> 2:28:05.720]  And, you know, who's taking Cheney's position? Who knows? But the point is,
[2:28:05.720 --> 2:28:11.400]  is that they're out there and we can't keep focusing on them. We have to create our own
[2:28:11.400 --> 2:28:16.520]  communities, our own economies. We have to take care of our health. We have to do the
[2:28:16.520 --> 2:28:20.760]  things to make ourselves healthy. Exactly. I don't obsess on them. I think they're pathetic.
[2:28:20.760 --> 2:28:26.200]  They're scum, but, but I live, I don't fight them because I hate them or that's 25% of it.
[2:28:26.200 --> 2:28:32.520]  75% of it is my love of everybody else because I love happy people. I love humanity. I love beauty.
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:37.320]  But see, they're greedy. They're envious. They're hateful, but we, we're opposite. We need to work
[2:28:37.320 --> 2:28:41.800]  together. And that doesn't mean going and joining one group. That means just having a better attitude,
[2:28:41.800 --> 2:28:45.960]  realizing we're going to win, realizing that, you know, if they, if they nuke us tomorrow,
[2:28:45.960 --> 2:28:50.120]  we still won because they're losers to begin with. Only a loser would want to go do all these
[2:28:50.120 --> 2:28:57.640]  horrible, evil things. Well, Alex, I really, as always, I always energized by coming around here.
[2:28:57.640 --> 2:29:03.000]  I love you, man. You are so cool. I get energized around you, George. You're, you're absolutely
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:09.160]  the best. And for the people listening, support Alex by his tapes, by his books, listen to them,
[2:29:09.160 --> 2:29:14.520]  tell your friends, and we need to create that critical mass. We're getting closer and closer
[2:29:14.520 --> 2:29:18.840]  to every one of you. One of you listening, maybe the one that pushes it over the edge. And if every
[2:29:18.840 --> 2:29:24.280]  one of you will just go to one of your friends today and bring the subject up, just talk to them.
[2:29:24.280 --> 2:29:31.320]  Commit. Yes. Create a larger and larger awareness of what's going on and realize that we're going
[2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:34.680]  to win this thing. We're going to restore it in the public. George on freefarerlove.com. Thank you,
[2:29:34.680 --> 2:29:41.640]  sir. I love you, my brother. Let's see you in here. See ya. We're on the march, the empires on the run.

[2:31:52.840 --> 2:31:57.160]  that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the
[2:31:57.160 --> 2:32:01.880]  water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into
[2:32:01.880 --> 2:32:07.480]  the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to
[2:32:07.480 --> 2:32:13.480]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and

[2:33:58.840 --> 2:34:01.800]  It lead us blueprint for a world government revealed
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:06.280]  Superclass the global power elite and the world they are making
[2:34:07.400 --> 2:34:10.920]  And it's all admitted that they're taking our liberties destroying our countries
[2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:13.800]  Transferring those powers to a private global government
[2:34:13.800 --> 2:34:15.960]  That they're going to use a police state to control us
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:18.760]  That they're going to shut down the free internet exactly as internet too
[2:34:18.760 --> 2:34:22.200]  Says they will exactly as I've told you because I'm going out their own policy reports
[2:34:23.240 --> 2:34:30.360]  By David Rothkopf and this fellow of course heads up Kissinger Associates
[2:34:30.360 --> 2:34:31.880]  Carnegie Endowment for Peace

[2:34:36.840 --> 2:34:40.600]  The church committee got their own documents how they start wars fun Hitler
[2:34:40.600 --> 2:34:44.680]  Always trying to destroy things and the head of the council on farm relations recently
[2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:52.840]  Republished a club of Rome report from 1992 1993 put it out last year where he said
[2:34:52.840 --> 2:34:56.600]  Oh global warming is not man-made and it's not real but we're going to use it as a unifying
[2:34:56.600 --> 2:35:02.680]  Effect so that the state directed by us can quote wage war against humanity making humans
[2:35:02.680 --> 2:35:05.640]  The enemy they mean the predator class against us the enemies
[2:35:05.640 --> 2:35:11.560]  And now they want to put up 5.6 billion dollars in quote phone booth size
[2:35:11.560 --> 2:35:17.640]  Scrubbers that suck up deadly co2 they've now listed the UN as a toxic chemical
[2:35:19.080 --> 2:35:24.520]  Totally ridiculous like listing H2O or salt as a deadly weapon or oxygen for that matter
[2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:30.520]  And he says in there but we're not just going to use terrorism as a way to wage war on the
[2:35:30.520 --> 2:35:35.880]  population this is the head of the CFR our real government he says we will use global warming
[2:35:35.880 --> 2:35:40.600]  1993 and then of course going back to the club of Rome in 68 it's all in my film

[2:36:00.680 --> 2:36:06.600]  what's going on and I thought I would get to Timothy F. Ball on he's a PhD retired university
[2:36:06.600 --> 2:36:11.720]  professor and global warming skeptic he heads the natural resources stewardship project and
[2:36:11.720 --> 2:36:15.880]  formerly head of the activist organization friends of science which was funded by energy
[2:36:15.880 --> 2:36:23.160]  companies that's what that's what we see here out of the good old folks at wikipedia and the
[2:36:23.160 --> 2:36:29.960]  Rockefellers are trying to basically fire Rex Tillerson of ExxonMobil because he won't join along
[2:36:29.960 --> 2:36:34.680]  hey I'm not funded by ExxonMobil let me just tell you something I know carbon dioxide is what plants
[2:36:34.680 --> 2:36:41.000]  breathe I know it's been 14 times higher in the last 200 000 years I know that it makes more oxygen
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:45.720]  that we breathe and they've got a new environmental group today that says cut down trees that they're
[2:36:45.720 --> 2:36:51.480]  creating CO2 which they do excel CO2 as well as oxygen they're now saying kill the trees these people
[2:36:51.480 --> 2:36:57.080]  at the low level are cult members at the highest levels because they want a global tax that is
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:37:03.240]  stated we sued and got the SPP documents last year from the BAMP Canada 2006 North American
[2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:08.280]  Union meeting and it said it's a fraud but that they want to use it as a way to tax us
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:14.840]  and he's an amazing background he's called the water man he's an expert on global water an expert
[2:37:14.840 --> 2:37:23.160]  on what's really happening with CO2 thank you for coming on professor Timothy F. Ball well thanks
[2:37:23.160 --> 2:37:28.040]  kindly for the opportunity and I just just a little comment Shakespeare said even the devil
[2:37:28.040 --> 2:37:35.640]  can use the scriptures in his arguments exactly yeah he he well well the bible says he poses as a
[2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:40.840]  angel of light you just heard my rant I've never talked to you before I did hear you on coast coast
[2:37:40.840 --> 2:37:46.760]  I am what's your take I mean first off boil it down why are they pushing a global warming scam
[2:37:47.480 --> 2:37:52.600]  what's the truth what's the real science and and then let's get into water and is it really
[2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:59.800]  scarce like they're trying to fear longer now okay in some in some areas the water is short
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:06.040]  but they're they're usually self-inflicted wounds for example municipalities using water
[2:38:06.040 --> 2:38:12.440]  as a loss leader to attract industry and not really taking into account the cost of delivery and
[2:38:12.440 --> 2:38:20.200]  dealing with the the sewage waste so there are some small areas but but overall it's not a problem
[2:38:20.200 --> 2:38:26.760]  not one that the technology isn't available to resolve but with regard to the the climate
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:32.120]  change issue Alex it's you mentioned the delimits to growth club of Rome and so on and of course
[2:38:32.120 --> 2:38:39.240]  out of that era came a guy named Marie Strong and Marie Strong said that the problem for the
[2:38:39.240 --> 2:38:44.920]  planet of the industrialized nations and isn't our responsibility to get rid of them and I want
[2:38:44.920 --> 2:38:49.080]  the listeners to think about how would you go about shutting down an industrialized nation
[2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:55.080]  and if you you could if you think about the the nation like an engine you can squeeze the fuel
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:39:00.680]  line it'll stop the engine but if you did that there'd be immediate reaction and you know what
[2:39:00.680 --> 2:39:04.920]  you gotta do is look at the gas prices going up in the reaction to that but you couldn't you
[2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:11.640]  couldn't achieve the same thing by plugging the exhaust if you plug up the exhaust of a car it'll
[2:39:11.640 --> 2:39:18.360]  stop and if you can show that the exhaust of the industrialized nations is killing the planet
[2:39:19.080 --> 2:39:25.480]  um then you effectively could shut that down and you can tax it you can regulate it you can say
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:32.280]  how big your house is and they state it's a fraud they know it's a fraud uh please continue but but
[2:39:32.280 --> 2:39:37.400]  I wanted to use one example here if you give people the scientific name of water dihydrogen
[2:39:37.400 --> 2:39:43.480]  monoxide 99 of people on the street and I've done this and I've seen it done on television
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:49.800]  you walk up and say did you hear about the date the dihydrogen monoxide problem uh or you know
[2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:54.520]  did you hear about the spill or just say should we ban it they'll say absolutely it's water folks
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:40:00.600]  and that's his asinine is saying that carbon dioxide is a toxic waste when am I correct in
[2:40:00.600 --> 2:40:07.400]  saying it is the main life gas because oxygen came later on this planet correct well that's right
[2:40:07.400 --> 2:40:13.880]  that you you uh without the uh plants you have no oxygen and the plants need to co2 to survive
[2:40:14.440 --> 2:40:20.600]  and um and of course at at 385 parts per million which is the current level that's the lowest level
[2:40:20.600 --> 2:40:27.240]  in in the um six billion year history of the earth exactly the earth is starved for carbon dioxide
[2:40:27.240 --> 2:40:31.800]  and their studies on desertification every we need more we should have factories making it
[2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:39.000]  well in in fact uh it is being used commercially that uh in greenhouses they're pumping in up to
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:44.200]  a thousand and twelve hundred parts per million and achieving four times the yield and what this
[2:40:44.200 --> 2:40:49.720]  indicates is the plants which evolved over the last 300 million years uh when the average
[2:40:49.720 --> 2:40:54.360]  atmospheric level was between a thousand and twelve hundred parts per million that that's the
[2:40:54.360 --> 2:41:00.840]  level that they function best at so at 385 they're essentially malnourished and of course Al Gore
[2:41:00.840 --> 2:41:06.360]  and the gang want to reduce that level even even more and at 250 parts per million the plants start
[2:41:06.360 --> 2:41:10.440]  to die now i want to stop you got no plants you got no oxygen you got no life on the planet i want
[2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:14.680]  to stop you now now that you know they can claim that we're all paid by the cable or elves to say
[2:41:14.680 --> 2:41:22.040]  this folks you don't need to believe us oxygen carbon dioxide water and sunlight are the four
[2:41:22.040 --> 2:41:27.160]  ingredients that you have to have for life it has been now i'm going for the mainline science
[2:41:27.160 --> 2:41:31.960]  you're the expert professor but i've read all the studies 14 times higher carbon dioxide
[2:41:31.960 --> 2:41:37.000]  plants live longer grow faster healthier than they put out more oxygen they've done studies
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:43.560]  showing that animals mammals insects we want more oxygen i want more oxygen i don't want these control
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:51.960]  freaks taxing my air and claiming that life-giving gas is devil poison yeah that's exactly right and
[2:41:51.960 --> 2:41:56.280]  of course uh you know you you go to the football game and one of the players sitting on the sideline
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:42:00.840]  but getting extra oxygen so they can perform better and by the way one of the things that's
[2:42:00.840 --> 2:42:06.120]  the greenhouse and and also research but people i sure would it so all the different plants they've
[2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:12.680]  studied uh they also use less water when the co2 levels are higher um because uh that you've seen
[2:42:12.680 --> 2:42:16.600]  the studies about how have you seen the studies about how and now they're proving this with the
[2:42:16.600 --> 2:42:22.040]  core samples of the things they've done with the robots the rovers that mars lost its atmosphere
[2:42:22.040 --> 2:42:26.040]  with the same thing that's happening here i guess these bastards want us to lose our atmosphere
[2:42:26.840 --> 2:42:31.560]  well it it certainly appears that way and and they're i guess um you know one of the things
[2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:37.320]  that underlies so much of this is that there's a very deep anti-humanism in the whole environmental
[2:42:37.320 --> 2:42:42.840]  movement you know if we could just get the people off the planet it would be a great place to live
[2:42:42.840 --> 2:42:47.720]  and um you you see this uh little things trickle out every once in a while for example the green
[2:42:47.720 --> 2:42:52.920]  peace report on global warming they said the co2 is is added to the atmosphere naturally and
[2:42:52.920 --> 2:42:58.600]  unnaturally and you say well what do you mean by unnatural well of course what they mean is humans
[2:42:58.600 --> 2:43:04.440]  and say well if if what we're doing is unnatural then that makes us unnatural and um so you see
[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:09.400]  this very deep-seated anti-humanism in in all of this are you kidding sir i've been to the meetings
[2:43:09.400 --> 2:43:14.600]  where every professor there walks around saying everyone needs to die and i have their graduate
[2:43:14.600 --> 2:43:20.040]  papers from their students saying all humans must be killed i mean this is a vicious cult
[2:43:20.040 --> 2:43:26.680]  and they all work and have access to bio weapons labs well and of course at the uh that's at the
[2:43:26.680 --> 2:43:32.040]  very basic level but at the intervening intervening level of course the the idea is to take control
[2:43:32.040 --> 2:43:36.200]  of the economy and take control of everything i mean if you look at what al gore is doing where
[2:43:36.200 --> 2:43:41.000]  he's going out telling you'll co2 is a is a pollutant it's a problem we got to get rid of it we got
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:45.640]  to reduce it oh and by the way one of the ways we can do it is carbon credits which is absolute
[2:43:45.640 --> 2:43:50.040]  rubbish doesn't reduce them at all he then turns around and sets up a company and makes money off
[2:43:50.040 --> 2:43:56.120]  of it now i i don't know how you look at that but uh it appears that that might sound like fraud
[2:43:56.120 --> 2:44:03.080]  well i i'm exactly i'm waiting for him to say dihydrogen monoxide yeah yeah there's two things
[2:44:03.080 --> 2:44:09.240]  about that by the way that and it is a wonderful exercise it plays on two things that these people
[2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:15.160]  exploit one is humans people there are people's fear we have natural fears of all certain things
[2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:19.000]  and and they're exploiting that all the sky is going to fall the world's going to come to an end
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:23.160]  and you know and and then the emotional words that get in there all the children are going to die
[2:44:23.160 --> 2:44:28.520]  there's going to be no future the planet the grandchildren and so on so and and michael kright
[2:44:28.520 --> 2:44:32.760]  wrote about that superbly how they do that in his book state of fear but the other thing that
[2:44:32.760 --> 2:44:39.240]  they're exploiting is lack of knowledge so you can throw out that scientific definition of water
[2:44:39.240 --> 2:44:44.360]  but because people don't know it then they automatically assume well because of the way
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:49.560]  you're doing it the way you're phrasing the question uh this must be something uh deadly
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:54.920]  and it's that the lack of knowledge that these people are exploiting and it can't be about
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:44:59.800]  doc doc doc hold on for me because since you mentioned that it's actually known as the dihydrogen
[2:44:59.800 --> 2:45:05.240]  monoxide hoax again that's water ladies and gentlemen the dihydrogen monoxide hoax involves
[2:45:05.240 --> 2:45:10.360]  listing negative effects of water under unfamiliar scientific names then asking individuals to help
[2:45:10.360 --> 2:45:15.880]  control the seemingly dangerous substance caused by most people known through the world as monoxide
[2:45:15.880 --> 2:45:19.960]  as part of the name of the poisonous gas the hoax is designed to illustrate how the lack of
[2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:25.480]  scientific knowledge and the exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced fears dihydrogen monoxide
[2:45:25.480 --> 2:45:30.040]  shortened to dhmo is a scientific name for water that while technically correct is almost ever
[2:45:30.040 --> 2:45:35.880]  employed now this this is a wikipedia propaganda piece that i just noticed this wasn't here yesterday
[2:45:35.880 --> 2:45:40.600]  i just clicked on this from wikipedia and suddenly they changed it i guess to counter me as i did a
[2:45:40.600 --> 2:45:47.480]  show about it yesterday but no that's it's not using the it's not twisting it you can go out and say
[2:45:47.480 --> 2:45:54.360]  should we ban dihydrogen monoxide and most people will say yes okay without even listing bad effects
[2:45:54.360 --> 2:45:59.880]  so so see they're very upset that we're showing their fraud now go ahead yeah well and and of
[2:45:59.880 --> 2:46:04.520]  course i said it is that exploitation of lack of knowledge and and but but just to look at the
[2:46:04.520 --> 2:46:08.920]  co2 thing for a second first of all um you know the idea is out there that it's the most important
[2:46:08.920 --> 2:46:14.120]  greenhouse gas it isn't water vapors by far the most important greenhouse gas it's what the co2 is
[2:46:14.120 --> 2:46:20.520]  less than four percent but one of the one of the base the basic assumption they make in their theory
[2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:27.880]  is that oh if co2 co2 traps heat so if if co2 in the atmosphere increases and it will because humans
[2:46:27.880 --> 2:46:33.160]  are producing more then the temperature will increase that's fundamental to their theory
[2:46:33.160 --> 2:46:40.040]  the problem is the evidence shows exactly the opposite that the ice core record of 420 000 years
[2:46:40.040 --> 2:46:46.600]  shows that temperature changes before co2 co2 does not drive temperature it follows what 700
[2:46:46.600 --> 2:46:52.760]  years after on average but there's about an 800 year lag but that can be as low as as 80 year lag
[2:46:52.760 --> 2:46:56.920]  and um you know one of the reasons they've stopped talking about global warming and started talking
[2:46:56.920 --> 2:47:02.200]  about climate change is because we've got this they've got this problem that since 2000 the global
[2:47:02.200 --> 2:47:07.080]  temperature has been declining that's because the sun the sun has now started cooling yeah exactly
[2:47:07.080 --> 2:47:12.280]  but the co2 continues to go up so they've got this great problem of evidence that completely
[2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:18.680]  contradicts what they're arguing well they simply shift the goalpost absolutely please continue
[2:47:19.720 --> 2:47:25.720]  well what i'm what i'm saying is is that they've shifted the goalpost from uh from global warming
[2:47:25.720 --> 2:47:31.320]  and now it's climate change well uh you know you've only got to look at any brief period
[2:47:31.320 --> 2:47:36.360]  you know that the climate change is dramatically all the time so well why did then are the public
[2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:43.320]  caught up in that the fundamental western view of the world is what is called the uniformitarian
[2:47:43.320 --> 2:47:50.280]  view that is that change is very gradual over long periods of time it goes back to darwin and to
[2:47:50.280 --> 2:47:57.400]  charles liel the geologist and so on and and darwin needed a much older world for his evolutionary
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:03.080]  theory to occur so he does okay with it changes gradual over long periods of time that's built
[2:48:03.080 --> 2:48:09.000]  in now so if you if you assume in your in your education that change is gradual and then suddenly
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:13.480]  somebody oh here's a sudden change oh if that's not natural that must be something those humans
[2:48:13.480 --> 2:48:17.480]  are doing and this is the game that's being played and again we're not well i mean i'm not
[2:48:17.480 --> 2:48:23.400]  going to debate about darwin the point is this is a guy 170 years ago coming up with this stuff 150
[2:48:23.400 --> 2:48:30.600]  years ago and uh now everything he quotes said the world works this way they then build all
[2:48:30.600 --> 2:48:34.920]  reality around that it's like saying the earth is still the center of the universe because we now
[2:48:34.920 --> 2:48:41.880]  know that actually evolutionary changes are fast they're sudden yep exactly and one of the examples
[2:48:41.880 --> 2:48:47.560]  of that is and i've looked at all the textbooks in north america and in europe and they most of them
[2:48:47.560 --> 2:48:53.400]  are still telling the students of the earth's orbit around the sun is a fixed elliptical orbit
[2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:59.960]  in fact it isn't fixed at all the orbit changes every single year and it goes from almost circular
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:06.840]  as it is now to extreme ellipse as it was just 22 000 years ago and the change is caused by the
[2:49:06.840 --> 2:49:12.600]  gravitational pull of the planet jupiter and and so people say well oh that's new information
[2:49:12.600 --> 2:49:18.280]  no it isn't we've known that information for 150 years yet we're still telling our students that
[2:49:18.280 --> 2:49:24.120]  the orbit of the earth is fixed and unchanging and and we've got this throughout our system
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:30.360]  that our view of the world is wrong and and yet it's built right into our science um professor
[2:49:30.360 --> 2:49:35.960]  something i just noticed here they admit that water is life-giving and oxygen is life-giving
[2:49:35.960 --> 2:49:41.000]  but they play it down on wikipedia about carbon dioxide and describe it as some type of devil
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:45.560]  weapon i bet soon they're going to say water's evil i mean i'm not kidding i think the public
[2:49:45.560 --> 2:49:52.280]  will buy that water is a toxic devil weapon well i i i don't they'll pick on anything to achieve
[2:49:52.280 --> 2:49:56.920]  their goals and of course wikipedia and the way that that is manipulated with with people like
[2:49:56.920 --> 2:50:02.440]  william connelly and these other people that go in there and put in their view of the science in
[2:50:02.440 --> 2:50:07.080]  the minute you try to correct it it's immediately corrected back but you know you know you know
[2:50:07.080 --> 2:50:12.120]  people you know that this is now the number one reference source and it's absolute crap
[2:50:12.120 --> 2:50:16.840]  go ahead yeah exactly what of course what they did was they made sure that if you put in something
[2:50:16.840 --> 2:50:22.840]  like say uh ocean currents the first source that comes up on google is the wikipedia source they've
[2:50:22.840 --> 2:50:27.960]  arranged that and when i talk to high school students how many of you use wikipedia well all
[2:50:27.960 --> 2:50:33.960]  the ads go up and i said how many of you are aware that um it can be changed by anybody
[2:50:33.960 --> 2:50:39.160]  that you can go in and edit it but there are groups of people who monitor it and make sure
[2:50:39.160 --> 2:50:44.440]  that only their information what they want out there stay there stay there timothy f ball give
[2:50:44.440 --> 2:50:52.360]  us some of his websites books materials amazing older i book it is a big idea a new world order
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:59.640]  in the near future earth is dominated by a powerful world government it's known as the builder bird
[2:50:59.640 --> 2:51:06.040]  group but their objective being world domination for thousands of years their dark order grew
[2:51:06.680 --> 2:51:12.120]  now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream of exterminating 80
[2:51:12.120 --> 2:51:20.360]  percent of humanity is at hand for the first time in history the elite's plan for world
[2:51:20.360 --> 2:51:25.480]  government is blown wide open you will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order
[2:51:25.480 --> 2:51:30.120]  agenda the older bird is making great progress for the world government most people have no idea
[2:51:30.120 --> 2:51:34.200]  they're not after money they have all the money they need they're after power that's after easy

[2:54:24.840 --> 2:54:30.120]  believe me and nothing to do with the earth and all the science shows lowest level of carbon
[2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:36.840]  dioxide ever is what plants breathe then they make oxygen as the byproduct for us this symbiosis is
[2:54:36.840 --> 2:54:42.200]  what lets us live we're healthier when there's more oxygen but i think they're going to start
[2:54:42.200 --> 2:54:47.160]  swatting many of you if you're found to have oxygen at your house and i'm not even joking i think
[2:54:47.160 --> 2:54:51.320]  you know that'll be like we're looking for oxygen he had one kilo of it it was a devil
[2:54:51.320 --> 2:55:00.440]  i mean they i guess uh professor dr timothy f ball phd um i i guess it's that the public has
[2:55:00.440 --> 2:55:05.800]  been so dumb dumbed down by public education but a lot of people aren't buying this now so as you
[2:55:05.800 --> 2:55:10.360]  said now it's just climate change and they're going to order our lives and tell us how to live
[2:55:10.360 --> 2:55:14.760]  and what to do because they're the guardians of the earth and by darn it humans are evil and
[2:55:14.760 --> 2:55:20.200]  we have to exterminate the majority of you and this is for your own good well and and of course
[2:55:20.200 --> 2:55:24.760]  one of the things people forget is that part of the the limits to growth and and the club of Rome
[2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:30.440]  was the whole thing about overpopulation and they made that a big issue and and of course
[2:55:30.440 --> 2:55:36.840]  it was al gore that was that organized the uh the conference on population in in Egypt Cairo
[2:55:36.840 --> 2:55:42.360]  Egypt a few years ago and of course the question you're going to ask is well uh who are you going
[2:55:42.360 --> 2:55:47.960]  to eliminate which groups are you going to get rid of and uh the fact is the world isn't overpopulated
[2:55:47.960 --> 2:55:53.480]  at all you can you can put the world population into surprisingly small areas in very comfortable
[2:55:53.480 --> 2:55:59.080]  conditions you can also build you can also build upwards and besides world population is going to
[2:55:59.080 --> 2:56:03.560]  plane off at eight and a half billion the unit mids and then it's going to start dying uh because
[2:56:03.560 --> 2:56:09.320]  once you industrialize you have an average of about 1.6 children well exactly and and countries
[2:56:09.320 --> 2:56:14.680]  that are already experiencing that italy is offering a financial reward for any couple that
[2:56:14.680 --> 2:56:21.320]  has a third child russia germany yep japan china where they try to deal with the population problem
[2:56:21.320 --> 2:56:28.040]  they've created the situation now where there's an absolute shortage of women well well sir one
[2:56:28.040 --> 2:56:33.000]  family per one child per family sir they're trying to corner the market on water grab it double the
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:38.360]  price tell you it's because it scares fresh water uh they're trying to do all of this right now
[2:56:38.360 --> 2:56:42.120]  how do we stop them because they're having governors announced it corporations announced
[2:56:42.120 --> 2:56:47.160]  it i mean it's a full court press this is the new tyranny how do we stop it well i think that
[2:56:47.160 --> 2:56:52.360]  there's a several things going on first to understand the change um as follows a sawtooth
[2:56:52.360 --> 2:56:57.880]  pattern that is that somebody starts raising questions about what's going on and then very
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:02.440]  gradually more and more people get on to it and programs like yours that bring it to attention
[2:57:02.440 --> 2:57:07.080]  and then all of a sudden uh overnight the change will occur i mean if you look at uh
[2:57:07.080 --> 2:57:12.680]  that uh smoking and and so on for a long time people quite then suddenly bang and now it's
[2:57:12.680 --> 2:57:18.040]  completely unacceptable almost to smoke and and so there that that's what you have to
[2:57:18.600 --> 2:57:23.160]  realize these things take time and the worst getting out there the second thing is of course
[2:57:23.160 --> 2:57:29.160]  that the um the mother nature is doing a great job by cooling the earth down and then and making all
[2:57:29.160 --> 2:57:34.120]  of their predictions look absolutely foolish and why is it that every time they have a big
[2:57:34.120 --> 2:57:40.200]  global warming summit they have record cold weather and it's blizzarded out well yeah it's
[2:57:40.200 --> 2:57:47.000]  wonderful yeah i like that and and um the uh so you you've got the um the fact that the uh the
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:53.160]  earth is cooling the other thing that's happening is that already some of their policies uh that
[2:57:53.160 --> 2:57:59.160]  have been implemented and and only the the more extreme ones are leaking havoc well about yeah
[2:57:59.160 --> 2:58:06.200]  the ethanol thing for example um and by the way that's that's being aggravated by cool weather
[2:58:06.200 --> 2:58:10.360]  as the southern hemisphere has been cooling for 20 years yeah that's right in fact we've had bad
[2:58:10.360 --> 2:58:15.320]  crops the last four years because of record cooling stay there stay there doctor professor
[2:58:15.320 --> 2:58:23.000]  top expert on climate water ice i mean his bio is 85 million miles long um but uh we'll be right

[3:00:42.520 --> 3:00:47.640]  are kind of like mal's little red book youth brigades i mean they say this uh they're already
[3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:52.680]  in austin popping tires of suv's i pulled up to zilker parker my kids last week take them on
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:00:57.400]  the train when i took off thursday and uh i noticed that there were a couple suv's had their tires
[3:00:57.400 --> 3:01:02.520]  popped so i i was driving a smaller suv it might have been seen as holy because it was japanese
[3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:06.840]  but i went and parked it you know down a little bit so they wouldn't pop my tires i saw the nerdy
[3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:12.040]  wells walking around engaging in their religious ceremony uh they burned down things burned down
[3:01:12.040 --> 3:01:17.320]  ski resorts you name it but they don't care about genetic engineering open air species testing
[3:01:17.320 --> 3:01:23.560]  things that are causing problems no it's all about harassing people they can't wait and the new green
[3:01:23.560 --> 3:01:29.240]  brigades are already being released professor you want to talk about that and by the way i've
[3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:34.440]  written about uh in the articles in canada free press that your listeners can look at
[3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:41.160]  but um one uh the um the whole environmental movement uh we needed we needed that it was
[3:01:41.160 --> 3:01:45.720]  it we needed change we needed to look at things differently but what happens with these things
[3:01:45.720 --> 3:01:51.160]  alexis that um the special interest groups and extremists grab these things and they
[3:01:51.160 --> 3:01:56.520]  explode on for their own person yeah for their own personal ends now the i when you asked me
[3:01:56.520 --> 3:02:01.240]  about how is this kind of how can we slow this down the role of the extremists which i've struggled
[3:02:01.240 --> 3:02:05.560]  with all of my career is they're at you see what what's the purpose of them it's hard like we you
[3:02:05.560 --> 3:02:10.600]  know we got rid of the mosquitoes would the world come to an end you know and and what i've realized
[3:02:10.600 --> 3:02:15.000]  is the role of the extremists is to to find the limits for the rest of us i mean if you think
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:19.720]  about feminism for example yeah it was needed there's still some changes needed but the majority of
[3:02:19.720 --> 3:02:25.000]  women were saying well how far do we go with this and then some women did silly things and the
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:28.840]  majority said no no that's going too far now we're losing more than we're gaining but that's
[3:02:28.840 --> 3:02:33.960]  precisely what's happened with this environmental thing that yeah we need to care the care about
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:38.920]  the planet we need to understand and we need to live in harmony with nature and everything else
[3:02:38.920 --> 3:02:43.640]  but now these people are just taking it beyond and they're using it for their own personal
[3:02:43.640 --> 3:02:49.880]  and political gains and um of course that will also feed back on them as we were talking before
[3:02:49.880 --> 3:02:56.280]  the break about uh about the uh rising food prices and and the damage that's being done
[3:02:56.280 --> 3:03:02.360]  and by the way there's another aspect to this uh paul dresen's written a book called eco imperialism
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:08.600]  and it's this is the imposition of these ecological values of these extremists on the developing
[3:03:08.600 --> 3:03:13.720]  country yeah i mean doc doc this is their excuse to run our lives and have corporate communism
[3:03:13.720 --> 3:03:17.480]  where they corporatize our wealth i had nobel prize winner joseph tickles on last week and he
[3:03:17.480 --> 3:03:22.920]  said yeah the neo fascist corporatized everything at the top and they give us socialism but only
[3:03:22.920 --> 3:03:30.120]  as a conduit to suck our goods and our resources and our labor out of us and uh they use these
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:34.200]  front groups i mean look that's all that's happening in anwar uh atlantic richfield
[3:03:34.200 --> 3:03:38.680]  executives i've had them on they found more oil than saudi arabia we're not allowed to have it
[3:03:38.680 --> 3:03:43.560]  because there's too much oil it's meant to create artificial scarcity the cartels doing it with the
[3:03:43.560 --> 3:03:48.600]  oil companies they're not letting us have the oil i mean does anybody think anybody cares about
[3:03:48.600 --> 3:03:53.480]  a few million hippies and sandals they're not stopping us having that oil the oil companies
[3:03:53.480 --> 3:03:59.160]  have got too much oil and they've created artificial scarcity see they want you to believe it's the
[3:03:59.160 --> 3:04:04.440]  idiot environmentalist go ahead exactly and that that's the interesting thing about it the paradox
[3:04:04.440 --> 3:04:10.520]  that it's to the benefit of the oil companies and the extreme environmentalists to have a shortage
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:15.080]  it suits both their ends for different reasons and i couldn't agree with you more
[3:04:15.080 --> 3:04:19.720]  and but you know nothing just to give you another example of how they exploit listen doc doc i've
[3:04:19.720 --> 3:04:25.160]  been interrupting you a lot i just so interesting i'm gonna try to stick a rubber ball in my mouth
[3:04:25.160 --> 3:04:29.000]  after this quick break and then you've got the floor for the 20 minutes we've got left
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:33.480]  you can just talk about whatever you want but i want to shatter paradox because i know exxon
[3:04:33.480 --> 3:04:37.800]  mobile and others have been forced for decades to actually fund the environmental people they
[3:04:37.800 --> 3:04:41.880]  call them wackos they're not wackos they're getting power they're getting money now they're getting
[3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:52.600]  guns and they're coming for us it is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is

[3:08:17.160 --> 3:08:22.360]  need to look at all the resources and and get a good handle on those and that's at nrsp.com
[3:08:23.080 --> 3:08:28.600]  i also helped set up and then advised the friends of science group at friendsofscience.org

[3:08:35.160 --> 3:08:41.160]  basis for canada free press i was doing an article for 17 years for farmers in a magazine called
[3:08:41.160 --> 3:08:45.960]  country guide and then i guess i got politically incorrect and they let me go but the farmers

[3:09:12.520 --> 3:09:16.680]  well of course what what they what they've done is they take the moral high ground and and so when
[3:09:16.680 --> 3:09:20.920]  people like me stand up and and try to argue you know you say what they they can look down on you
[3:09:20.920 --> 3:09:26.120]  say well you're not green you don't care and um and anybody that dares to question and i think
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:30.600]  that's one of the frightening things is it's vast segments of the society that are bullied into
[3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:35.880]  silence by these people and uh you see i see what the politicians i mean behind the fence they'll
[3:09:35.880 --> 3:09:40.280]  say to you yeah we agree with you we know we know what the science is saying and so on but we
[3:09:40.280 --> 3:09:46.280]  don't show anything that to suggest that we're not totally environmental they also lie they also
[3:09:46.280 --> 3:09:54.200]  lie of green they also lie they say no scientist on earth yeah believes it's not real we have 2000
[3:09:54.200 --> 3:09:58.840]  and then it just turns out they just put people's names on it yeah well of course that's the numbers
[3:09:58.840 --> 3:10:05.320]  game and it is a consensus thing and and the consensus is not a scientific fact and um it is
[3:10:05.320 --> 3:10:11.400]  but consensus works in politics and the number by the way that they use is the 2500 people of the
[3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:17.400]  ipcc this intergovernmental panel on climate change and the guy that was responsible for setting that
[3:10:17.400 --> 3:10:23.000]  up was the guy i mentioned earlier morris strong and he's he's there with george soros and all of
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:29.320]  those people and he set up the united nations environmental program in which they defined
[3:10:29.320 --> 3:10:33.880]  that they can if they're going to study climate they can only look at human effects on climate
[3:10:33.880 --> 3:10:39.000]  ignore what natural climate is and only look at the human portion well how can you possibly know
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:43.000]  whether humans are having effect if you don't know how the climate change is naturally but that's
[3:10:43.000 --> 3:10:49.640]  their mandate and of course with the authority of the un and the and and uh strong is is been on
[3:10:49.640 --> 3:10:55.400]  is on record as they chose to un because he could he could appoint the people he wanted he could get
[3:10:55.400 --> 3:10:59.960]  all the money he wanted he had no control he didn't have to run for election or anything else
[3:10:59.960 --> 3:11:10.600]  and the ipcc is the 2500 but up to 2500 alex 1900 of them are not looking at climate change in
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:15.480]  science they're looking at okay let's accept that humans are causing it and what are the impacts
[3:11:15.480 --> 3:11:20.280]  going to be exactly the meeting was about what they were going to do about man made global warming
[3:11:20.280 --> 3:11:26.840]  it wasn't a scientific treatise and manifesto and declaration of the of of fact and then
[3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:31.320]  thousands of them have been associated with this and other programs have come public and said
[3:11:31.320 --> 3:11:36.440]  i didn't agree to all this i didn't i just was invited and paid and flown there and they put
[3:11:36.440 --> 3:11:42.600]  my name on this exactly and and a lot of them have quit over it and but that's where the consensus
[3:11:42.600 --> 3:11:49.560]  number comes from and by the way um of of of the 2500 less than 300 were involved in the actual
[3:11:49.560 --> 3:11:56.360]  science and to show you how political it is the the mandate or their rules say that you publish
[3:11:56.360 --> 3:12:04.280]  the summary first you put that out to the public the summary is the political statement the stats
[3:12:04.280 --> 3:12:08.760]  summary then goes back to the scientists and said okay make sure your science report agrees with
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:13.800]  what we put out as the summary so it's like an executive writing a a summary and saying to the
[3:12:13.800 --> 3:12:18.920]  employees write a report that agrees with my summary that's how they've written the rules
[3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:24.920]  well that's why i tell my accountant hey this is how many taxes i owe make sure it make sure all
[3:12:24.920 --> 3:12:31.240]  the accounting you do matches that but exactly and so this this is what they've done and and and
[3:12:31.240 --> 3:12:37.080]  it's through that un and the ipcc and of course then the specific focus on co2 which we already
[3:12:37.080 --> 3:12:43.320]  talked about to to bring these things down and within those reports by the way they leave out and
[3:12:43.320 --> 3:12:47.720]  and their computer models and and and of course these are the same models that can't tell you
[3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:51.720]  what the weather is going to be like 10 days from now and yet they're quite certain that what's
[3:12:51.720 --> 3:12:58.040]  going to happen 50 and 100 years from now and it's all based on computer models but in those
[3:12:58.040 --> 3:13:03.800]  computer models they leave out huge parts of of what we know that's right these aren't even the
[3:13:03.800 --> 3:13:09.160]  classic models these are it's been admitted fixed models where they build it for the result they want
[3:13:09.800 --> 3:13:14.120]  yep and and of course one of them as we already mentioned they build in the fact that if the
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:19.560]  co2 increases the temperature will go up yet all of the natural evidence shows us that it's exactly
[3:13:19.560 --> 3:13:26.520]  the other way around but the temperature increases before the co2 but so every time you look at something
[3:13:26.520 --> 3:13:32.760]  you can see how they've manipulated to achieve the result that they want and so it's it's literally
[3:13:32.760 --> 3:13:38.120]  garbage in garbage out and i mentioned already the one about the orbit of the earth around the sun
[3:13:38.680 --> 3:13:43.480]  and none of that that's called the melancholy melancholy effect none of that is included in
[3:13:43.480 --> 3:13:48.200]  their climate models yet every single year the orbit's different and that changes the climate
[3:13:48.200 --> 3:13:53.960]  and alex only got to think about is just 22 000 years ago which is something even humans can get
[3:13:53.960 --> 3:14:00.040]  their mind around 22 000 years ago all of canada and a portion of the u.s was covered with an ice
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:05.080]  sheet larger than the current Antarctic ice sheet oh i know there's giant glacial rocks right here in
[3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:11.960]  texas up there exactly yeah and that ice sheet by the way melted in about 5000 years tell me where
[3:14:11.960 --> 3:14:17.480]  the heat came from to melt that ice that the hiberian maxim came from the sun yeah exactly
[3:14:17.480 --> 3:14:21.960]  well of course they ignore the sun they say oh no this they look in the textbooks it tells you
[3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:28.200]  it's a solar constant it's anything but constant i know they just lie it's incredible they say the
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:34.040]  sun never changes when when that's the oldest thing studied the egyptians put on their walls
[3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:39.720]  that the sun changed yeah i mean everybody knows the sun heats up and cools down and expands
[3:14:39.720 --> 3:14:45.720]  and contracts and throws off different coriolis uh uh uh you know super ejections energies yep
[3:14:45.720 --> 3:14:50.840]  exactly and and of course one of the one of the things that we know about is that that the global
[3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:56.280]  temperature varies with the number of sunspots basically when there's more sunspots the earth
[3:14:56.280 --> 3:15:01.080]  is warmer when there's less the earth is cooler and by the way we've had no sunspots for over a
[3:15:01.080 --> 3:15:04.680]  year now which is why we've got cold temperatures which for those that don't know those are huge
[3:15:04.680 --> 3:15:11.480]  explosions and those are those are huge uh ejections coming off of it that are so powerful
[3:15:11.480 --> 3:15:16.840]  that when our astronauts are in space and one goes off they have to come back down out of orbit
[3:15:16.840 --> 3:15:21.960]  or they have to get behind the water tanks yeah exactly they've got to be protected from it well
[3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:28.120]  we've got the earth magnetic field is protecting us and of course we can that we but i've had the
[3:15:28.120 --> 3:15:32.440]  other scientists on about how even the particles from the sun you know not just the radiation the
[3:15:32.440 --> 3:15:37.960]  particles come in and then those form clouds and it's just exactly yeah that's the point that's
[3:15:37.960 --> 3:15:42.680]  the cosmic theory of of spence mark but you see the reason they said okay yeah there's a high
[3:15:42.680 --> 3:15:47.080]  correlation between sunspots and global temperature but what's the mechanism well we don't know the
[3:15:47.080 --> 3:15:52.120]  mechanism so we're going to ignore it and and so they left that out of their computer models but
[3:15:52.120 --> 3:15:55.880]  here's another big one doctor i want to get your take on this and i'm sort of moving so fast you're
[3:15:55.880 --> 3:15:59.960]  just amazing i gotta get you up for two hours in their futures we can really break this down
[3:15:59.960 --> 3:16:07.320]  uh for the last uh 20 years all the planets their moons uh have been melting liquid moon
[3:16:07.320 --> 3:16:12.200]  uh moons that were ice or liquid they admit the whole solar system was heating and i brought that
[3:16:12.200 --> 3:16:17.960]  up to david rothschild who ran the uh you know new york live earth thing a few months ago last year
[3:16:17.960 --> 3:16:22.200]  and he said well that's because jupiter and saturn are closer to the sun and i said no they're not
[3:16:22.200 --> 3:16:27.560]  he said no they are closer to the sun and and either is he that dumb the guy's worth billions
[3:16:27.560 --> 3:16:33.320]  or does he think my audience is so dumb he could just bluff well exactly and that goes back to the
[3:16:33.320 --> 3:16:38.520]  thing that i said to you about they they uh they work on you people's lack of knowledge
[3:16:38.520 --> 3:16:42.840]  but every once in a while they get caught in these lies and that's an example well for those
[3:16:42.840 --> 3:16:50.440]  that don't know professor uh he is is jupiter closer to the sun than the earth no but see rothschild
[3:16:50.440 --> 3:16:57.240]  just says you're wrong yeah well with what are we the fourth planet out from the sun yeah it goes
[3:16:57.240 --> 3:17:03.400]  only three inside of us isn't it no you know jupiter's much further out yeah it's third rock
[3:17:03.400 --> 3:17:10.920]  it's uh it's mercury earth earth mars and then you get the gas giants yeah you go exactly exactly
[3:17:10.920 --> 3:17:17.080]  and and of course the fact that the the mars polar ice cap is melting when there's no snow
[3:17:17.080 --> 3:17:22.520]  greenhouse gases there it's clearly related to the oh by the way uh i'm not attacking robert
[3:17:22.520 --> 3:17:27.960]  kennedy jr but we brought up to him uh in a video interview he said well why are you saying global
[3:17:27.960 --> 3:17:33.800]  warming you know we gotta have global tax uh you know mars's ice caps are melting at a couple miles
[3:17:33.800 --> 3:17:39.800]  a year just incredible pace and he said there's no ice cap on mars and just laughed at us i mean
[3:17:39.800 --> 3:17:45.160]  it's got huge ice caps yeah well exactly but you see this is the game and i'll give you another
[3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:49.720]  example of how they do it you keep hearing about the arctic ice and of course the polar bears and
[3:17:49.720 --> 3:17:53.560]  all of that and by the way the polar bear numbers are increasing dramatically and i'll come to that
[3:17:53.560 --> 3:17:58.600]  in a minute they show film of it on an iceberg and say look they're gonna die they can't swim
[3:17:58.600 --> 3:18:04.360]  when they swim 200 miles and kill belugas well exactly and i flew search and rescue in the arctic
[3:18:04.360 --> 3:18:09.640]  and i've seen polar bears up to 180 miles offshore and one of the reasons they're good swimmers is
[3:18:09.640 --> 3:18:14.040]  because um they've got two furs they've got the short fur close to their body that keeps the heat
[3:18:14.040 --> 3:18:19.560]  in so efficiently by the way that they don't even show up on infrared cameras but also
[3:18:19.560 --> 3:18:25.880]  the long fur is hollow and the sunlight hits that and goes down into the body to heat the body
[3:18:25.880 --> 3:18:31.640]  but because it's hollow that long fur allows them to float very easily incredible creatures
[3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:38.680]  yeah exactly they adapted to the environment but but the point about the arctic ice is you see
[3:18:38.680 --> 3:18:42.520]  most of the people have no idea what the arctic ocean looks like or how big it is
[3:18:43.080 --> 3:18:48.040]  and so they can play on that they're for most people the arctic arctic ocean is just a line
[3:18:48.040 --> 3:18:52.760]  across the top of the map on the school wall it's always breaking it's always being replenished by
[3:18:52.760 --> 3:18:59.160]  rain and then breaking off yeah but you know how much uh the arctic uh in the arctic um
[3:18:59.160 --> 3:19:05.720]  about 16 million square kilometers of ice forms every year every winter that's the amount that's
[3:19:05.720 --> 3:19:13.320]  up there right now and every summer 10 million square kilometers of that melts now that's an area
[3:19:13.320 --> 3:19:20.520]  equal to the us melts every single summer in fact 10 million square kilometers of ice melts in about
[3:19:20.520 --> 3:19:27.240]  150 days and yet they tell you oh no it's more melting this year than last year and the way
[3:19:27.240 --> 3:19:32.280]  they played the game is they said oh well more melted this year uh than last year an area the
[3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:37.720]  size of texas well of course they know everybody thinks old texas that's big but actually stay
[3:19:37.720 --> 3:19:45.000]  there let's talk about this fraud let's talk about the fraud in the final segment absolute scam

[3:22:50.520 --> 3:22:56.440]  know most people are overly acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise ph balance is
[3:22:56.440 --> 3:23:01.160]  the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease people

[3:23:11.240 --> 3:23:16.760]  most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment
[3:23:16.760 --> 3:23:21.640]  fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it

[3:24:52.040 --> 3:24:58.040]  is the environment um continuing sir in closing with yeah just use one of their big lies we'll
[3:24:58.040 --> 3:25:03.080]  have you back for their thousands of lies about how they point at glaciers and go look it's collapsing
[3:25:03.080 --> 3:25:09.000]  oh it's dying and then the water there's clips falling well that's always happened but the
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:13.400]  public can't find the us on a map of not being mean it's just true they don't know who the
[3:25:13.400 --> 3:25:17.800]  vice president is so they believe the earth is it's over polar bears are drowning they can't
[3:25:17.800 --> 3:25:23.640]  swim we're all dead uh you've got the floor in the last four minutes you know and and of course
[3:25:23.640 --> 3:25:29.400]  the the glacier issue and it speaks to the one that al gore knows is critical because if you say
[3:25:29.400 --> 3:25:34.440]  to people well what's wrong with global warming uh all you hear about is good is that uh it's
[3:25:34.440 --> 3:25:39.480]  negative it's bad but for for a great many things it's a positive thing in fact when the world is
[3:25:39.480 --> 3:25:45.080]  warmer generally the flora and the fauna are better off and so you really push them on it and
[3:25:45.080 --> 3:25:50.920]  then they'll say oh well then the sea level is going to rise and that's why so much of gore's movie
[3:25:50.920 --> 3:25:56.760]  is with that the computer generated oh here's the sea level flooding new york and florida and so on
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:26:03.080]  and because he knows that that that's a huge concern to people um but it it really is is um
[3:26:03.080 --> 3:26:09.800]  absolute nonsense um it i mean first of all for Antarctica you got three types of ice down there
[3:26:09.800 --> 3:26:14.600]  they never distinguished between them when they put out the stories you got the the actual ice cap
[3:26:14.600 --> 3:26:19.880]  itself which is actually increasing in size not decreasing the south pole has been cooling
[3:26:19.880 --> 3:26:24.280]  since they've been keeping temperatures they're not warming and then you've got around the edge
[3:26:24.280 --> 3:26:30.120]  you've got what they call shelf ice that is as the big glacier pushes out into the ocean these flat
[3:26:30.120 --> 3:26:35.880]  tabular ice sheets form and of course they are pushed up and down by the tides and the waves and
[3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:41.480]  so on and eventually they break off and then you hear oh here's another big iceberg breaking off
[3:26:41.480 --> 3:26:46.680]  and this is global warming and i've got one record from a sailing ship back in the 1840s
[3:26:46.680 --> 3:26:52.680]  of an ice island 100 miles long and 40 miles wide and the ship sailed around it to measure it
[3:26:52.680 --> 3:26:57.880]  and um that was long before there was any human global warming and then you've got the sea ice
[3:26:57.880 --> 3:27:03.400]  forming around Antarctica which is different again and it goes from about two million square
[3:27:03.400 --> 3:27:10.440]  kilometers in the summer out to about 15 million square kilometers in the winter time and so it's
[3:27:10.440 --> 3:27:16.040]  a constant change and that's the the key issue that they play on and they're doing it with the
[3:27:16.040 --> 3:27:20.920]  glaciers we're monitoring we're only monitoring about 10 percent of the world's alpine glaciers
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:27.240]  50 percent of them are advancing 50 percent of retreating uh because glaciers are as much about
[3:27:27.240 --> 3:27:31.880]  the amount of snowfall that's occurring as they are about the temperature but they pick on the
[3:27:31.880 --> 3:27:36.200]  ones that are retreating and say oh here's the proof of it and it's definitely do the warming
[3:27:36.200 --> 3:27:42.440]  go gorg did it with Kilimanjaro and and and of course there's been no global warming around
[3:27:42.440 --> 3:27:49.080]  there is all the temperature record show well i mean i mean to make it simple it it rains and then
[3:27:49.080 --> 3:27:55.400]  it piles up and then the glaciers push out towards the water they pile up and then slough off and
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:28:00.840]  that and that both of the artyx the Antarctic and the arctic north and south are actually getting
[3:28:00.840 --> 3:28:06.920]  bigger right now uh just from uh the surveys that have been done and that's an admitted fact but it
[3:28:06.920 --> 3:28:10.760]  doesn't matter uh they'll just run around fear monitoring i mean take Greenland with all those
[3:28:10.760 --> 3:28:15.560]  aircraft uh that were like you know that were left in world war two and now they're 50 60 100
[3:28:15.560 --> 3:28:22.120]  feet depending on the area under ice yeah yeah and and and of course the sea level thing you see
[3:28:22.120 --> 3:28:27.080]  if you melt what what happened with that originally Alex was that the scientists said okay if we melt
[3:28:27.080 --> 3:28:31.320]  the Greenland and Antarctica how much water is created and they simply added that to this
[3:28:31.320 --> 3:28:37.320]  the current sea level but the the problem with that is that most of that ice is already below sea
[3:28:37.320 --> 3:28:43.400]  level so it wouldn't add to the sea level at all it would simply occupy the space that's occupied
[3:28:43.400 --> 3:28:49.560]  by the ice so the only part that would add to sea level is the part that's above current sea level
[3:28:49.560 --> 3:28:54.760]  but then there's other adjustments go on because the land rises and falls so you can stand for
[3:28:54.760 --> 3:28:59.800]  example you can stand on the Gulf Coast of Mexico down there in texas and you the sea level seems
[3:28:59.800 --> 3:29:03.640]  to be changing but is it because the sea level is going up and down or because the land's going
[3:29:03.640 --> 3:29:09.000]  up and down in the case of the Gulf of Mexico the land is sinking so it appears that the water's
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:12.920]  coming in oh that's the sea level's rising is due to global warming no it isn't because the land's
[3:29:12.920 --> 3:29:18.520]  going down so everywhere you see this kind of misinformation sir where can we read more your

[3:33:02.600 --> 3:33:06.280]  hour in the near future we've only got it for about 15 minutes 20 minutes right now
[3:33:07.640 --> 3:33:11.160]  because in the last five minutes i'm going to play some excerpts of interviews with debauging
[3:33:11.160 --> 3:33:17.320]  palfry the dc madame who said she'd never commit suicide even if she was convicted she's now been
[3:33:17.320 --> 3:33:22.840]  murdered clearly reportedly uh she was about to release the fact that she had uh sent girls to
[3:33:22.840 --> 3:33:27.080]  with some high-ranking white house folks she never said who on air never told me privately that's
[3:33:27.080 --> 3:33:30.920]  kind of thing i wouldn't want to know about it being on air because you get killed no hit teams
[3:33:30.920 --> 3:33:35.320]  at my house please uh this is just horrible what happened we'll play some of that in the last five
[3:33:35.320 --> 3:33:42.520]  minutes but professor tostadosky as in a canadian economist he heads up global research he is a
[3:33:42.520 --> 3:33:47.160]  professor of economics university of auto what you're asking is taught as visiting professor at
[3:33:47.160 --> 3:33:52.360]  academic institutions in western europe latin america in southeast asia he has acted as an
[3:33:52.360 --> 3:33:55.640]  economic advisor to governments and developed countries has worked as the consultant for
[3:33:55.640 --> 3:34:00.280]  international organizations including the u n development fund the african development bank
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:05.080]  the united nations african institute of economic development the united nations population fund
[3:34:05.080 --> 3:34:09.160]  i mean it goes on and on for 10 years but uh very well known and we'll tell you about some of his
[3:34:09.160 --> 3:34:14.600]  books and materials like america's war on terrorism while we've got you today sir i want to just try
[3:34:14.600 --> 3:34:20.920]  to get boiled down answers and pick your brain we appreciate you coming on but first off are they
[3:34:20.920 --> 3:34:27.400]  going into iran uh rama govern cia analysts is saying he thinks so they're saber rattling or is that
[3:34:27.400 --> 3:34:32.520]  off the table like jimmy carter says and then secondarily where do you think the economy's
[3:34:32.520 --> 3:34:39.640]  going with the international order that's b and then c um of the three presidential candidates
[3:34:39.640 --> 3:34:45.400]  i know it's all theater but there's different fishers and different camps in the new world order
[3:34:45.400 --> 3:34:50.120]  who do you think's behind who i know that's a lot in 20 minutes but um you've got the field sir
[3:34:50.120 --> 3:34:57.400]  well uh alex is the great it's just great to be on on your program and uh these are of course far
[3:34:57.400 --> 3:35:05.240]  reaching questions i'll i'll try to address the the crucial question will the war with iran occur
[3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:12.360]  i've been uh looking at this issue for the last oh i would say more than five years certainly
[3:35:12.360 --> 3:35:20.600]  uh those war preparations started up in 2003 uh with uh tyrant which was called theater iran near
[3:35:20.600 --> 3:35:28.120]  term uh those were war scenarios right after the the invasion of iraq um and uh there's been a
[3:35:28.120 --> 3:35:34.840]  military buildup uh from uh from that period onwards uh and it's only i would say in the last
[3:35:34.840 --> 3:35:40.840]  year that the mainstream press has actually addressed the issue of uh of these war preparations
[3:35:40.840 --> 3:35:49.560]  now uh i think one has to analyze this very carefully uh first of all uh war preparations
[3:35:50.360 --> 3:35:57.160]  directed against the country do not signify necessarily that the war will occur uh their
[3:35:57.160 --> 3:36:03.560]  number factors the ability of the country to defend itself against foreign aggression in
[3:36:03.560 --> 3:36:09.640]  this case the united states nato and israel we know that's the alliance um it's military
[3:36:09.640 --> 3:36:16.760]  capabilities to defend itself uh in other words it's uh air defense system it's uh capabilities
[3:36:16.760 --> 3:36:25.640]  to retaliate that means this it's missile ballistic system which which um uh iran has and in fact uh
[3:36:25.640 --> 3:36:32.360]  even recent military exercises have demonstrated that these capabilities are significant uh
[3:36:32.360 --> 3:36:40.280]  thirdly uh it it's a country of six sixty million people with compulsory conscription um which means
[3:36:40.280 --> 3:36:49.400]  that overnight it can mobilize several million um um uh land forces uh soldiers i'm not suggesting
[3:36:49.400 --> 3:36:56.920]  that they are as as advanced or as sophisticated as the u.s military but um bear in mind the
[3:36:56.920 --> 3:37:04.280]  geography uh basra is right on the iranian border and so the moment uh and and that's
[3:37:04.280 --> 3:37:11.160]  i again the media is going to go completely wild all over iraq yes absolutely that's exactly
[3:37:11.160 --> 3:37:16.440]  what will happen they'll cross the border and they'll ransack all the military installations
[3:37:16.440 --> 3:37:23.720]  whether even if they're not even if uh and and of course the the the u.s uh the u.s military
[3:37:23.720 --> 3:37:30.120]  in iraq in iraq doesn't control the the the terrain it doesn't control the country so imagine what
[3:37:30.120 --> 3:37:36.440]  would happen if you have uh just a couple of hundred thousand iranian troops cross the border
[3:37:36.440 --> 3:37:45.960]  into iraq that would be absolute chaos it would mean immediate escalation uh and uh and the joint
[3:37:45.960 --> 3:37:52.280]  chiefs of staff know that they know that they that that the u.s military cannot handle it
[3:37:52.280 --> 3:37:58.680]  you you have of course admiral fallon was was fired for having more or less said that
[3:37:59.240 --> 3:38:05.080]  but if you look at at if you look at at the statements of of the new um uh chairman of
[3:38:05.080 --> 3:38:10.200]  joint chiefs of staff admiral michael mullen he says pretty much the same thing and and what's
[3:38:10.200 --> 3:38:17.640]  very significant is that when admiral michael mullen was appointed to uh to head to as the head
[3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:23.080]  of the joint chiefs of staff back in october of last year the first thing he made he the first
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:31.080]  thing he said he said it outright uh and and and he didn't say it in any different way to to uh to
[3:38:31.080 --> 3:38:40.040]  fallon uh he said the risks could be very very high when a conflict um and uh uh we have to be
[3:38:40.040 --> 3:38:45.640]  incredibly thoughtful about the potential of getting into a conflict with a third country
[3:38:45.640 --> 3:38:49.880]  in that part of the world and that those were his words and they were published in the israeli
[3:38:49.880 --> 3:38:56.840]  press and i presume that they were also published in the in the quoted in the u.s press so that this
[3:38:56.840 --> 3:39:05.080]  this consensus within the the u.s armed forces for an attack on iran hello i don't i don't believe
[3:39:05.080 --> 3:39:11.480]  it's as straightforward as what some people suggest and the fact that admiral fallon has
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:18.280]  been dumped as as commander of of uh of central command which of course is a very important
[3:39:18.280 --> 3:39:26.360]  key position uh that doesn't necessarily change uh the the situation on the ground in in iraq now
[3:39:26.360 --> 3:39:31.000]  now let me just add a little question here we have sabir brazinski coming out last year telling
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:36.120]  congress uh look for a false flag attack stage by the military by our government then we have gary
[3:39:36.120 --> 3:39:39.960]  hart writing a letter to tehran saying our governmental stage attacks you better watch it
[3:39:39.960 --> 3:39:43.800]  or a few days ago he told we are changed new york that indeed that the government may stage
[3:39:43.800 --> 3:39:49.000]  something now he's an insider he went he helped write homeland security clearly involved in 911
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:55.160]  why are we now seeing this split or is this a real split well i think it's certainly a split
[3:39:55.160 --> 3:40:02.200]  within the establishment i mean brazinski doesn't necessarily represent different different uh power
[3:40:02.200 --> 3:40:08.360]  lobbies than than than the neocons he's a i think he he's certainly a person who has a little bit
[3:40:08.360 --> 3:40:16.280]  more sense and he believes in diplomacy and i i mean under the circumstances i think brazinski
[3:40:16.280 --> 3:40:24.120]  is a is a is a certainly a a positive um what he says is positive i i i don't doubt that
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:31.640]  brazinski still believes in u.s. um dominance at the global level as as his publications suggest
[3:40:31.640 --> 3:40:34.920]  so bottom line what do you think is going to happen you're saying there's an internal fight
[3:40:34.920 --> 3:40:41.960]  uh do you think they'll stage some provocation i the problem is that you have people who are not
[3:40:42.520 --> 3:40:48.120]  always staying in their minds and you have a command structure within the armed forces
[3:40:48.760 --> 3:40:55.320]  so that ultimately even uh it's not really the military that that calls the shots it's the
[3:40:55.320 --> 3:41:02.360]  civilians okay so that the orders will come from dick cheney most probably and his his advisors
[3:41:02.360 --> 3:41:08.360]  as president bush will sign whatever they stick in front of him and you could very well have
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:13.720]  a situation which could get completely out of hand why does israel want this knowing that
[3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:19.400]  even if the the the u.s. has said if iran defends itself in any way that will be seen as the greatest
[3:41:19.400 --> 3:41:25.160]  crime in galactic history and that they'll have to be nuked and so i guess israel wants fall out
[3:41:25.160 --> 3:41:31.320]  and and they just they just love it well israel is also israel has been involved in advanced
[3:41:31.320 --> 3:41:41.640]  war preparation since 2000 and uh 2004 uh stockpiling uh they've stockpiling tactical nuclear weapons
[3:41:41.640 --> 3:41:46.840]  their own nuclear weapons the bunker busters are the people running our society just bored and they
[3:41:46.840 --> 3:41:51.000]  just they just they just want to see mushroom clouds i mean i guess it's like hitler just
[3:41:51.000 --> 3:41:54.920]  wanted to have a war is it just is it just is it just come down to that that these are guys
[3:41:54.920 --> 3:42:00.600]  that think it's tough to start wars well i mean the issue with the issue with nuclear weapons
[3:42:00.600 --> 3:42:08.760]  is that the whole the whole nuclear doctrine has changed dramatically uh since uh since 2002
[3:42:08.760 --> 3:42:13.800]  with a nuclear posture review which states essentially that nuclear weapons are harmless to
[3:42:13.800 --> 3:42:19.880]  the surrounding civilian population that goes into all the handbooks of the military and it and
[3:42:19.880 --> 3:42:25.880]  now they've been reclassified and approved by the u.s. senate for use in the conventional war
[3:42:25.880 --> 3:42:33.000]  theater and now we learn that in 1959 the joint chiefs wanted to attack uh china during a taiwan
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:38.280]  crisis and i and they said in those documents now released last week that oh these are just
[3:42:38.280 --> 3:42:43.720]  like iron bombs we ought to use these in every conflict just as a conventional weapon and isan
[3:42:43.720 --> 3:42:51.400]  howe had to say no that radiates people yeah but i mean it sure is now that policy i mean that
[3:42:51.400 --> 3:42:56.680]  policy is here now well the thing is that with the tactical nuclear weapons has been a lot of
[3:42:56.680 --> 3:43:04.920]  propaganda uh by the pentagon to present these mini nukes is something different from a from a
[3:43:04.920 --> 3:43:12.600]  regular thermonuclear bomb which they're not they have less explosive capacity between one third
[3:43:12.600 --> 3:43:18.680]  and six times a hiroshima bomb um and they don't airburst let me stop you they generally aren't
[3:43:18.680 --> 3:43:25.080]  airburst and so when a hydrogen weapon goes off in contact with the soil and surrounding metals
[3:43:25.080 --> 3:43:30.280]  it creates thousands of times the fallout so they're actually more dirty from what i've seen
[3:43:30.280 --> 3:43:37.960]  well i mean that again that that issue is is probably uh debatable i agree uh what the what the
[3:43:38.520 --> 3:43:44.760]  the pentagon scientists are saying is that the tactical nuclear weapons weapons because the
[3:43:44.760 --> 3:43:49.480]  bunker buster bombs they explode on the ground but then when you look more carefully at the
[3:43:49.480 --> 3:43:55.960]  small print they say 20 feet on the ground not 20 feet on the ground is probably uh you know uh
[3:43:55.960 --> 3:44:01.560]  the size of your of a of a two-story you know it's a three-story house so you could well imagine
[3:44:02.040 --> 3:44:08.840]  uh that that um everything will simply explode a big crater is formed and and and of course you
[3:44:08.840 --> 3:44:14.120]  have radioactive fallout you can't avoid that that's the worst time when it has when it detonates
[3:44:14.120 --> 3:44:21.800]  on the ground absolutely absolutely but the thing is uh i i think that what we have are
[3:44:21.800 --> 3:44:28.520]  decision makers which are the victims of their own uh lives and propaganda that they ultimately even
[3:44:28.520 --> 3:44:35.640]  believe that a nuclear device a nuclear weapon is a some kind of a humanitarian bomb and then
[3:44:35.640 --> 3:44:41.400]  they go along with that because it's they have a bunch of scientists at the at the research labs and
[3:44:41.400 --> 3:44:47.400]  in uh texas in california who say well yeah go ahead and use them because they're safe for the
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:52.600]  surrounding civilian population and incident by the way this is a major shift in their mindset
[3:44:52.600 --> 3:44:58.040]  because until 10 years ago they admitted du was deadly poison and killed the troops now they just
[3:44:58.040 --> 3:45:03.080]  threw all their real research out and said it's it's good for you i mean it's it's a craziness
[3:45:03.080 --> 3:45:09.240]  is now uh go ahead well yeah i i mean i think it goes back even further because i i recall
[3:45:09.240 --> 3:45:14.840]  all when i started researching this i i went in and looked at truman's diary before they dropped
[3:45:14.840 --> 3:45:24.520]  the the nuclear uh the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nakasaki and in in truman's um radio address i
[3:45:24.520 --> 3:45:32.440]  think it was it was on the day that they bombed nakasaki eighth or ninth of august 1945 uh he
[3:45:32.440 --> 3:45:41.960]  said he confirmed that um the first atomic bomb was dropped on hiroshima a military base
[3:45:42.520 --> 3:45:48.680]  and that it was because we wanted to save the life the lives of innocent innocent civilians
[3:45:48.680 --> 3:45:55.960]  unquote incredible propaganda uh and i either truman was was poorly briefed as to as to where
[3:45:55.960 --> 3:46:01.080]  the bomb would be dropped all that he went along all that he was plain ignorant of the geography
[3:46:01.080 --> 3:46:08.200]  of japan or a combination of that but but the whole notion of collateral damage has been has
[3:46:08.200 --> 3:46:15.640]  been ingrained in us a nuclear weapons policy right i think right from the beginning just amazing
[3:46:15.640 --> 3:46:19.320]  i mean we all know that targeted civilians and we all know it was a terror weapon and they'd already
[3:46:19.320 --> 3:46:24.760]  tried to surrender but yeah truman spins it in a radio address of don't worry we bomb the military
[3:46:24.760 --> 3:46:30.040]  not the people and it's a tiny bomb anyways it's no big deal it was a friendly thing to do i want
[3:46:30.040 --> 3:46:33.560]  to carry you through the break and just continue broadcasting during the break so we have time
[3:46:33.560 --> 3:46:37.880]  here to cover some of the other issues bottom line in your gut i know you don't want to be wrong but
[3:46:37.880 --> 3:46:41.160]  you know they just said we're sending a carrier not to threaten them but let them know we're
[3:46:41.160 --> 3:46:46.120]  serious more double speak do you think they're going to hit iran do you agree with rama govern
[3:46:46.120 --> 3:46:52.200]  and others uh do we get to that after the break now or no i mean i mean we're not going to take
[3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:58.520]  a break just just just tell me oh okay well i i'm not i'm not i personally uh if i look at the
[3:46:58.520 --> 3:47:06.840]  various um countervailing uh forces i would say uh that there are many factors which go against the
[3:47:06.840 --> 3:47:13.240]  war in in iraq i tend to agree on iran uh but i think it's lessening i i think it's lessening
[3:47:13.240 --> 3:47:16.520]  you know i said they probably weren't going to hit them two years ago and got called out
[3:47:16.520 --> 3:47:22.120]  that i wasn't you know the you know the expert uh but but but they could still stage something
[3:47:22.120 --> 3:47:26.680]  couldn't they do well absolutely now that you mentioned the issue of the false flag attack
[3:47:26.680 --> 3:47:33.080]  uh sort of second 9 11 now the second 9 11 has been announced by dick chenney uh quite a few
[3:47:33.080 --> 3:47:39.560]  years ago he said that uh he said there's going to be a second 9 11 and i'm absolutely convinced
[3:47:39.560 --> 3:47:45.320]  that if there is a second 9 11 iran will be behind it so they've already planned that scenario
[3:47:45.320 --> 3:47:51.080]  and the pentagon then released there were some documents leased to the washten post by and where
[3:47:51.080 --> 3:47:58.040]  they said that the second 9 11 would be both an opportunity which would be uh an opportunity a
[3:47:58.040 --> 3:48:04.120]  pretext of an opportunity which is lacking i'm i'm quoting from the document so that the the
[3:48:04.120 --> 3:48:11.480]  false flag uh attack on on a u.s city which would be an intelligence operation is there
[3:48:11.480 --> 3:48:17.720]  the problem is that there are too many people that that and people in high places that know
[3:48:17.720 --> 3:48:25.480]  that 9 11 is uh uh is uh is an inside job and uh what is the establishment but i could
[3:48:26.040 --> 3:48:30.760]  go ahead it could backlash i mean it could backlash well exactly what is the establishment
[3:48:30.760 --> 3:48:37.320]  going to do now the jessie ventura and willy nelson and and best actors 2008 and all these
[3:48:37.320 --> 3:48:42.760]  scientists and ca section chief bill christiansen and then the former italian president in german
[3:48:42.760 --> 3:48:48.200]  former german defense minister and and the poll showing the majority know it's an inside job
[3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:52.760]  are you saying we have effectively at least partially taken their tool a false flag and
[3:48:52.760 --> 3:48:58.920]  broken it in front of their faces well it's a bit it's a bit like crying wolf huh uh you know
[3:48:58.920 --> 3:49:05.240]  there's been so many um terror alerts and terror that they've been of course we had the london
[3:49:05.240 --> 3:49:10.440]  bombings then we had the liquid bomb attack and we know we know that the liquid bomb attack was
[3:49:10.440 --> 3:49:17.000]  was a was a fake because the the alleged hijackers didn't have passports and tickets to board the
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:21.880]  plane as was revealed actually in in a i think it was newsweek that revealed it in the small
[3:49:21.880 --> 3:49:27.080]  print yeah they have they have so overdone it all that it's obvious to everybody well it's not
[3:49:27.080 --> 3:49:32.200]  obvious to everybody because you still have you you know you've got cnn you've got fox news which
[3:49:32.200 --> 3:49:39.720]  and the bbc which will which will tell us otherwise but again it people in in high office in the u.s
[3:49:39.720 --> 3:49:47.720]  congress them the increasing numbers of people who are who are what you know what what uh the u.s
[3:49:47.720 --> 3:49:54.120]  administration calls top officials because they have these top-off exercises anti-terror exercises
[3:49:54.120 --> 3:49:59.560]  where they have uh you know people from the municipalities the the federal the state governments
[3:49:59.560 --> 3:50:08.040]  the involved in scenarios and and uh i think there are lots of people who are extremely skeptical
[3:50:08.040 --> 3:50:15.320]  uh on the on the on 9 11 okay professor certainly very skeptical on on the on iran as well

[3:54:11.800 --> 3:54:19.160]  minutes of deborah jean palfrey uh on my show uh in the well just back in mid marge she was killed
[3:54:19.160 --> 3:54:24.600]  murdered uh the disinfo agents are now saying they've confirmed that she hung herself uh
[3:54:25.240 --> 3:54:29.480]  they they murdered her and this is how they do it and they killed one of the girls she had it
[3:54:29.480 --> 3:54:33.160]  was reportedly hooked in with the winehouse and they'll probably kill more of these women
[3:54:33.160 --> 3:54:37.240]  and they could cut their heads off and on tv and have guys in black uniforms do it and the
[3:54:37.240 --> 3:54:41.560]  public would say it was done by the easter bunny if the media told them so here's this poor lady
[3:54:41.560 --> 3:54:46.040]  right now i'm going to come back and go into overdrive on the info wars dot com audio streams
[3:54:46.600 --> 3:54:51.240]  so let's go ahead and go to this well look i mean she's already dropped the atomic bomb on
[3:54:51.240 --> 3:54:57.640]  them she's already released the numbers yeah yeah i have and uh and i and and and not to
[3:54:57.640 --> 3:55:03.160]  be concerned i have no intention of letting anyone buy me off or make any kind of a deal with me
[3:55:03.160 --> 3:55:07.080]  and you're not planning to commit suicide and i'm not planning to commit suicide either
[3:55:07.720 --> 3:55:11.160]  the fact that you're so visible really protects you going on larry king and other big
[3:55:11.720 --> 3:55:15.400]  shows uh but you want to put it on record that you're not planning to commit suicide
[3:55:15.400 --> 3:55:21.080]  no i'm not planning to commit suicide i'm planning to go into court on april seventh if indeed we do
[3:55:21.080 --> 3:55:27.560]  have the trial and i plan on defending myself vigorously and i plan on exposing the government
[3:55:27.560 --> 3:55:34.280]  uh in ways that you know i do not think they want me to expose them i want them to explain to me
[3:55:34.280 --> 3:55:39.960]  in open court why they came after me i mean how would you not know that was chaining uh and and
[3:55:39.960 --> 3:55:46.280]  you know how do we know that brandy uh britain one of your girls uh who committed suicide didn't
[3:55:46.280 --> 3:55:52.280]  commit suicide well we don't know about that there's two schools of thoughts one says yes one says no
[3:55:52.280 --> 3:55:56.840]  but regarding dick chaney he very possibly could have used the service i don't remember him i'm
[3:55:56.840 --> 3:56:03.560]  sure he used an alias um after all he probably would not have used the service once he became
[3:56:03.560 --> 3:56:08.920]  vice president that's pretty obvious and became very well known but uh in the middle eight nineties
[3:56:08.920 --> 3:56:13.560]  as he faded off the radar screen and during the clinton years uh you know i could have
[3:56:13.560 --> 3:56:21.800]  sent easily a 25 26 28 year old woman we hired age 23 and up uh who would have had no you know who
[3:56:21.800 --> 3:56:27.160]  would have been 18 years of age when he was the secretary of defense back in the late eighties
[3:56:27.160 --> 3:56:32.840]  in the early nineties and to be honest with you uh she wouldn't have recognized him but why is his
[3:56:32.840 --> 3:56:40.600]  name coming up well you know uh there are people who claim that uh Wayne Mattson who claims he has
[3:56:40.600 --> 3:56:45.960]  sources confirming it these sources are not coming forward though well i know why if it's true boy
[3:56:45.960 --> 3:56:51.720]  this is dangerous uh what were the circumstances that make people question uh brandy britain's
[3:56:51.720 --> 3:56:59.480]  death well you know people say that she was a very upbeat person a very positive person uh
[3:56:59.480 --> 3:57:05.720]  that she was going into court she was ready to fight him uh that she absolutely uh was not going
[3:57:05.720 --> 3:57:12.920]  to give in and all of a sudden uh the i think a few days before she committed uh before she
[3:57:12.920 --> 3:57:17.720]  was to go to trial she committed suicide and her family members her friends say that this was
[3:57:17.720 --> 3:57:24.840]  extremely abnormal she was not in the frame of mind to commit suicide uh you know that perhaps she
[3:57:24.840 --> 3:57:30.440]  knew something there's been a lot of speculation about that she had very little to lose she wasn't
[3:57:30.440 --> 3:57:35.480]  going to go to jail she was charged on a prostitution case she'd been busted but i guess she was
