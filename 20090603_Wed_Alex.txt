[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:31.600]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones

[00:39.960 --> 00:45.280]  well he's probably gonna be announcing he's running for governor again here on
[00:45.280 --> 00:51.200]  this radio show today coming up in two hours best-selling author political
[00:51.200 --> 00:55.680]  activist all-around interesting character friends of Willie Nelson Jesse Ventura
[00:55.680 --> 01:00.080]  and many others that's all I got to know Jesse Ventura and the discovery was
[01:00.080 --> 01:06.320]  already aware of my work Kiki Friedman will be in studio today with us we'll
[01:06.320 --> 01:11.560]  talk about a host of issues coming up in two hours and I've never had him on
[01:11.560 --> 01:17.360]  the show before but I found out that he is a listener and he is Steve Voss my
[01:17.360 --> 01:22.280]  favorite patriot musician you hear some of his little clips of some of his music
[01:22.280 --> 01:26.280]  here some of the bumper music but we'll be playing a few of his songs in their
[01:26.280 --> 01:31.400]  entirety coming up in the final hour today because music's a great way to
[01:31.400 --> 01:35.720]  reach out to people and a great way to get your message across and I've also
[01:35.720 --> 01:43.040]  decided to add Steve Voss's new greatest hits album several other albums he's
[01:43.040 --> 01:50.480]  done to the info wars.com video slash bookstore slash music shop slash info
[01:50.480 --> 01:57.160]  wars gear where you can get great colors show your colors with pride the

[02:05.800 --> 02:18.240]  coming up today I am going to at the bottom of this hour get into part two of
[02:18.240 --> 02:25.480]  the cyber security bill and exactly what it will do and what it will set up so
[02:25.480 --> 02:38.200]  that is coming up in about 30 minutes more and more I realize that of the
[02:38.200 --> 02:44.960]  thousands and thousands of wonderful outspoken prominent filmmakers authors
[02:44.960 --> 02:55.760]  statesmen researchers fighting globalization fighting the New World Order
[02:56.880 --> 03:05.440]  that this radio show and my websites and what we do encompasses the largest and
[03:05.440 --> 03:14.720]  most effective operation against the globalist. Ron Paul is kind of a
[03:14.720 --> 03:20.240]  different animal he is a statesman politician congressman and overall that
[03:20.240 --> 03:28.040]  movement has energized people to basically then kind of use Ron Paul as a
[03:28.040 --> 03:38.960]  gateway to discover what we do and it's a symbiotic relationship but overall this
[03:38.960 --> 03:47.360]  radio show my films the work we do is the most effective biggest voice against
[03:47.360 --> 03:53.840]  the globalist and that is an incredible responsibility. More and more I am crushed
[03:53.840 --> 04:01.280]  by the responsibility I am humbled I am
[04:01.280 --> 04:13.840]  chastened I am steeled I am braced buffeted by that responsibility and by
[04:13.840 --> 04:19.720]  the fact that we've done a lot of good we've been very very effective in any
[04:19.720 --> 04:27.960]  ways but also I've made a lot of mistakes and I'm certainly not perfect but
[04:27.960 --> 04:32.680]  I'll tell you this I am trying the best I can I am trying to be the best leader
[04:32.680 --> 04:36.280]  I can I am trying to make the best decisions I'm trying to bring you the
[04:36.280 --> 04:40.600]  most accurate information I'm trying to take all the intensifying attacks from
[04:40.600 --> 04:48.600]  every quarter and put a good face on it and move forward. We have a lot of
[04:48.600 --> 04:54.160]  important news it's very important on the eugenics front the economy a lot more

[04:57.800 --> 04:59.800]  us

[07:09.960 --> 07:13.880]  it does the ones who truly understand self-reliance are those who've
[07:13.880 --> 07:18.320]  experienced the devastation of a midwest ice storm tornadoes floods or the

[08:00.120 --> 08:09.040]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:09.040 --> 08:36.200]  one of the favorite accusations of people is to
[08:36.200 --> 08:44.400]  say that Alex Jones exaggerates that Alex Jones is is painting things in a
[08:44.400 --> 08:53.800]  worse light than it is I don't know I saw mainstream government press
[08:53.800 --> 08:59.720]  releases and I saw corporate jockeying statements and documents two and a half
[08:59.720 --> 09:05.240]  years ago that they were planning to bankrupt Chrysler and GM at least perhaps
[09:05.240 --> 09:12.800]  Ford and sell it off to China India Brazil and Europe and Russia and I got on
[09:12.800 --> 09:17.640]  air and I said this is the plan and I said during the economic implosion that
[09:17.640 --> 09:23.600]  will start in 2008 and run through 2012 and exactly what we said has now happened
[09:23.600 --> 09:33.480]  I mean I was just going off what they said they were gonna do and it's like
[09:33.480 --> 09:39.000]  this on hundreds and hundreds of issues almost everything we talk about here
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.560]  ends up being worse when it actually happens than we originally said
[09:43.560 --> 09:48.000]  everything we say is one to happen happens and then even more horrible
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.840]  things happen on top of it we have a criminal illegitimate rogue government
[09:53.840 --> 09:58.560]  a planetary government operating in the open you can watch European Union
[09:58.560 --> 10:02.800]  parliament meetings you can read ran corporation documents we play the clips
[10:02.800 --> 10:07.600]  here we post the documents at info wars.com and prison planet.com where
[10:07.600 --> 10:11.080]  they brag we're already under global governance and that they're going to
[10:11.080 --> 10:16.720]  expand it and mop up the final pockets of resistance and that they will use
[10:16.720 --> 10:22.520]  financial terrorism and economic terrorism and pharmacological terrorism
[10:22.520 --> 10:28.520]  and physical terrorism and famine and war and it's all out on the open in the
[10:28.520 --> 10:35.960]  scholarly volumes. Meanwhile the average American the average European has no
[10:35.960 --> 10:40.720]  idea this is even going on or if the Europeans go and vote down the expansion
[10:40.720 --> 10:44.600]  of EU power destroying our liberties and freedoms the EU parliament just says we
[10:44.600 --> 10:49.040]  don't care we're doing it anyways. Britain has sworn not to sign on to
[10:49.040 --> 10:52.360]  the treaty without a vote and then they've just gone ahead and by fiat done
[10:52.360 --> 10:57.240]  it and the news admits yes we're under EU regulation and control and there's
[10:57.240 --> 11:02.760]  nothing you can do about it. Ireland says no so their government moves to go
[11:02.760 --> 11:07.520]  ahead and start implementing the Treaty of Lisbon
[11:09.840 --> 11:16.400]  without getting the people to approve it that is tyranny plain and simple the
[11:16.400 --> 11:22.200]  government is illegitimate it's out of control when we have private banks that
[11:22.200 --> 11:26.360]  have stolen 14.8 trillion that numbers a month old every few months we get new
[11:26.360 --> 11:31.320]  numbers in seven months they stole 14.8 trillion and I know I make that point at
[11:31.320 --> 11:37.400]  nauseam because it's devastating that's more than the GDP that's a trillion
[11:37.400 --> 11:42.720]  800 billion more than the GDP in half a year
[11:46.640 --> 11:55.080]  they are going for broke and as if it's couldn't get any more ridiculous I'm
[11:55.080 --> 12:01.120]  driving in to work this morning listening to one of the local talk
[12:01.120 --> 12:06.800]  stations and a caller calls in and talks about how blacks continue to be
[12:06.800 --> 12:17.960]  killed shot in the back homeless blacks retarded blacks autistic blacks blacks
[12:17.960 --> 12:22.080]  in their cars at night and there's always an excuse for why it happens and
[12:22.080 --> 12:25.800]  and the squad car videos always malfunction then we always find out oh
[12:25.800 --> 12:29.360]  it didn't malfunction there is a surveillance camera and they say oh but
[12:29.360 --> 12:32.840]  he had a gun then you read the news article closely at the bottom it says
[12:32.840 --> 12:41.040]  no officers thought he reached for a gun just just deception and then another
[12:41.040 --> 12:45.600]  and then the host start making jokes saying oh oh prison planet oh the
[12:45.600 --> 12:50.520]  government wants to kill the blacks and clear reference to me and then another
[12:50.520 --> 12:58.320]  caller calls in and says well they do put all the Planned Parenthood in the
[12:58.320 --> 13:04.000]  minority neighborhoods and all prison planet calm yes they want to kill all
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.960]  the blacks Planned Parenthood wants to get you listen it's not funny it's on
[13:09.960 --> 13:15.000]  record that Margaret Sanger gave awards to Hitler got awards from Hitler that
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.480]  Hitler quoted her in speeches I mentioned the eugenicist above her in mind
[13:19.480 --> 13:24.760]  comp my struggle it is a fact the Cold Springs Harbor Research Institute run
[13:24.760 --> 13:29.200]  by IBM then and run by IBM and the federal government today and the human
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.520]  genome is for eugenics on record to figure out how to kill race specifically
[13:34.520 --> 13:43.240]  each and every one of us on record currently and you got people that think
[13:43.240 --> 13:47.960]  it's funny this isn't funny that we're being gang raped by offshore banks that
[13:47.960 --> 13:52.880]  they've stolen 14.8 trillion it isn't funny they got abortion mills in every
[13:52.880 --> 14:00.320]  black and Hispanic area of the country it isn't funny that all of this is going
[14:00.320 --> 14:06.240]  on you see these good old boys think they're part of the system they think
[14:06.240 --> 14:09.480]  they're the winners they think they're protected from all of this and then I
[14:09.480 --> 14:13.480]  heard a woman calling right after them going yeah I think we got too many
[14:13.480 --> 14:17.360]  minorities and she was serious she said I'm glad they're killing them you see
[14:17.360 --> 14:24.400]  that stupid fat soccer mom thinks she's part of the establishment she's a
[14:24.400 --> 14:28.160]  eugenicist you can run into them I get their emails and their calls and I've
[14:28.160 --> 14:31.760]  had them snidely say stuff to me you know if you go to a school function or
[14:31.760 --> 14:37.840]  something they say well there are too many people Alex well listen here know
[14:37.840 --> 14:44.240]  it all control freak kill yourself then don't sit there in the minority
[14:44.240 --> 14:48.000]  neighborhoods and tell 17-year-old pregnant girls if you'll have an
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.120]  abortion we'll drop this marijuana charge on you and that's what goes on
[14:52.120 --> 14:59.040]  coast-to-coast I got one of the news today and I don't like them killing all
[14:59.040 --> 15:04.120]  the poor whites kids either you see once you accept that humans are bad and
[15:04.120 --> 15:07.400]  we're a parasite that's that's the conventional knowledge even heard
[15:07.400 --> 15:12.760]  Ventura say that the other day on the show once you accept that you accept
[15:12.760 --> 15:22.280]  total and complete absolute despotism and tyranny the truth is they're blocking
[15:22.280 --> 15:28.160]  the clean technologies that could allow populations to continue to grow and that
[15:28.160 --> 15:32.400]  we could be colonizing space and giving humans goals things that humans need in
[15:32.400 --> 15:36.480]  societies instead the elites have decided to mesmerize the population with
[15:36.480 --> 15:43.680]  entertainment and incrementally with soft kill weapons camouflage through the
[15:43.680 --> 15:50.000]  military industrial big pharma medicine complex soft kill almost all of us that
[15:50.000 --> 15:56.440]  are alive today and it's already going on hardcore and I'm sorry this hidden
[15:56.440 --> 16:01.320]  thumbs suckin UT football I'm sorry it's not thumbs suckin riding around your
[16:01.320 --> 16:07.840]  motorcycle acting tough I'm sorry it isn't the you know image of strutting
[16:07.840 --> 16:12.360]  around the bar acting manly if you're a real man you got a gut up and face the
[16:12.360 --> 16:19.040]  facts of what we're in and deal with it but as the elites say you won't deal
[16:19.040 --> 16:23.200]  with it so you deserve to die well listen I don't deserve to die and my
[16:23.200 --> 16:27.160]  family doesn't deserve to die and there's a lot of dumbed-down poisoned
[16:27.160 --> 16:30.640]  stupid people out there who don't deserve to die and the evil that's being
[16:30.640 --> 16:35.200]  set up is going to lead lead to the irrevocable destruction of our species
[16:35.200 --> 16:40.640]  the damaging of it bare minimum is already going on and I'm not putting up
[16:40.640 --> 16:48.120]  with it I'm not going along with this science experiment you got me now that
[16:48.120 --> 16:54.920]  leads me to this next point earth
[16:54.920 --> 16:59.640]  2100 the end of civilization this reportedly has been airing in multiple
[16:59.640 --> 17:06.240]  parts on ABC I've seen clips of it and for some reason our terrible dish
[17:06.240 --> 17:09.760]  network here in the office doesn't pick up ABC but I need listeners to tape this
[17:09.760 --> 17:13.720]  if you have it and mail it to us that's a request or I'll find out how to buy it
[17:13.720 --> 17:18.000]  because I want to cover this or somebody get it up on YouTube because just in the
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.520]  promo videos we've seen in little clips we've seen it is admitting that their
[17:22.520 --> 17:26.720]  chemtrailing is for our own good admitting that mass plagues are going to
[17:26.720 --> 17:30.960]  wipe out most of us world government is the only answer to the extinction of
[17:30.960 --> 17:36.760]  human species see they tell you they take your own self-preservation your own
[17:36.760 --> 17:40.280]  survival instinct and they tell you we've got to kill off most the other
[17:40.280 --> 17:45.320]  people or you're not going to survive they turn your own survival instinct in
[17:45.320 --> 17:54.120]  on itself like a scorpion sting itself and that's why they teach in Europe and
[17:54.120 --> 17:58.160]  the United States and Australia all over the world wherever it's IMF World Bank
[17:58.160 --> 18:03.040]  funded they teach in the public schools in the fifth sixth seventh grade
[18:03.040 --> 18:07.800]  spaceship or lifeboat and it's a situational ethics game where they go
[18:07.800 --> 18:10.920]  there's ten of you the class breaks up in two or three groups and there's eight
[18:10.920 --> 18:14.600]  to ten needs lifeboat or spaceship they call it eat you know there's two
[18:14.600 --> 18:19.560]  different games they play or they say we've crashed in the mountains and the
[18:19.560 --> 18:24.400]  plane and everybody we've got to eat each other so who lives and who dies and
[18:24.400 --> 18:28.360]  they have the kids go through situational ethics and learn to not think
[18:28.360 --> 18:33.680]  outside the box and think of solutions that will save everybody they teach you
[18:33.680 --> 18:37.960]  that survival is deciding who dies and then the teacher tells you who we need
[18:37.960 --> 18:42.800]  we need a policeman we need an administrator we need this we need that
[18:42.800 --> 18:46.840]  but we don't need this and we don't need that and then the kids decide who to
[18:46.840 --> 18:52.240]  exclude from the group and who dies and they have shows like survivor and all
[18:52.240 --> 18:55.840]  of this if you're really on an island you work together as a team if you want
[18:55.840 --> 18:59.840]  to survive and thrive you don't all screw the smartest and the best that's
[18:59.840 --> 19:03.920]  what those games teach you we gang up on the smartest and the best and we push

[25:12.400 --> 25:16.040]  America's richest people met to discuss ways of tackling a disastrous
[25:16.040 --> 25:19.760]  environmental social and industrial threat and as Richard in Haas head of
[25:19.760 --> 25:24.160]  the CFR writes they will use phony environmentalism and phony terrorism as
[25:24.160 --> 25:29.920]  the two different pincers to control society this is neo-surfdom this is
[25:29.920 --> 25:35.240]  neo-futilism by King's 600 years ago in England in France had to keep the
[25:35.240 --> 25:39.840]  people at subsistence starvation level because they didn't want them debasing
[25:39.840 --> 25:45.080]  the forest of the wildlife and hurting the environment they had to be called
[25:45.080 --> 25:52.640]  that's all this is that's all this is and a lot of experts and sociologists and
[25:52.640 --> 25:58.200]  economists are pointing this out now on mainstream news China India Mexico 100
[25:58.200 --> 26:03.680]  plus of the third world nations zero emissions cuts only the West so we lose
[26:03.680 --> 26:08.680]  our industry it moves to the third world with no controls boost emission levels
[26:08.680 --> 26:15.400]  and then we all pay taxes that's all it is a total and complete scam that's
[26:15.400 --> 26:21.600]  their recovery now you talk to the average yuppie the average person with a
[26:21.600 --> 26:25.040]  college degree and they've all been taught humans are bad we got to get rid
[26:25.040 --> 26:28.080]  of people they don't know they're taking part of that when they shoot their
[26:28.080 --> 26:34.760]  kid up with vaccines every couple days it's all fun going into the death camp
[26:34.760 --> 26:39.360]  but the whole country the whole world is a prison planet death camp here is
[26:39.360 --> 26:46.800]  earth 2100 the end of civilization to change the future first you have to
[26:46.800 --> 26:50.880]  imagine it well we are breaking down the elites real blueprint for the future
[26:50.880 --> 26:54.720]  they don't put it all in one place but they do put it all in different white
[26:54.720 --> 26:59.280]  papers and we put it together this is their baloney future if you don't give
[26:59.280 --> 27:04.440]  into them and their control here it is in my life I've seen New York City under
[27:04.440 --> 27:10.200]  full quarantine the Midwest overrun devastated by pests plague sweep across
[27:10.200 --> 27:14.840]  California and then what happened next was something none of us saw coming it
[27:14.840 --> 27:19.840]  became a race against time to save our future to even have a future it's the
[27:19.840 --> 27:25.680]  year 2100 and I survived to change the future first you have to imagine it
[27:25.680 --> 27:32.880]  Tuesday at 9 8 central on ABC a two hour global television event earth 2100
[27:32.880 --> 27:37.320]  okay and we've seen clips of this in fact you can go to the site ABC News and
[27:37.320 --> 27:42.400]  watch them and they admit we're gonna spray the atmosphere with chemtrails to
[27:42.400 --> 27:47.560]  save the earth to make it cool off now we've had the climatologist we've had
[27:47.560 --> 27:55.000]  the meteorologist on the secret cloud seeding program now declassified Obama's
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.600]  talked about it but they're only declassifying a little bit of it to
[27:58.600 --> 28:03.360]  introduce it to the slaves admits they've been spraying since 1992 all over
[28:03.360 --> 28:09.520]  the world and it heats the planet up the rays go through it and then bounce back
[28:09.520 --> 28:14.600]  up and get trapped it is a greenhouse gas causing particulate why are they
[28:14.600 --> 28:18.160]  terraforming the earth well it's a national security state you know why
[28:18.160 --> 28:22.200]  did the United States government detonate over 200 high-powered hydrogen
[28:22.200 --> 28:26.400]  bombs in the upper atmosphere blowing holes in the ozone layer great
[28:26.400 --> 28:32.160]  documentary narrated by William Shatner called Trinity about that and it'll show
[28:32.160 --> 28:38.720]  them detonating the nukes in the atmosphere why are they genetically
[28:38.720 --> 28:42.720]  engineering and splicing every major food crop why are they when they know
[28:42.720 --> 28:46.840]  that it's killing the rats and other rodents that they tested on why are they
[28:46.840 --> 28:50.640]  doing all of this well we know they're eugenicists so we know it's to get rid
[28:50.640 --> 28:58.320]  of the population we know it's to test things this is the only issue we can
[28:58.320 --> 29:03.200]  talk about so demyre you know running around ruling that states have a right
[29:03.200 --> 29:07.080]  to ban the second amendment and now if federal court has ruled that I've got
[29:07.080 --> 29:16.320]  that wall street journal in my stack today it's all happening I mean I could
[29:16.320 --> 29:25.640]  talk all day about how the bankers are robbing us but in the final equation we
[29:25.640 --> 29:29.720]  have a global elite who are eugenicists who believe they want to set up a world
[29:29.720 --> 29:33.400]  government to forcibly call us and they're now finishing the final touches
[29:33.400 --> 29:38.400]  on our world government and the public's running around thinking they're still in

[36:26.520 --> 36:29.880]  good thing for the earth there's too many people anyways and you don't care
[36:29.880 --> 36:34.440]  about your neighbor and when you're being drug off they don't care about you and
[36:34.440 --> 36:39.080]  remember it was ABC news right after 9-11 and the height of the fear that ran a
[36:39.080 --> 36:42.600]  five-part series that they announced was real every night and at the end of the
[36:42.600 --> 36:47.200]  show they would announce it was a simulation of smallpox killing millions
[36:47.200 --> 36:52.280]  of Americans in dark winter and martial law and police state and troops firing on
[36:52.280 --> 36:57.840]  US citizens I mean do you not see that for over a decade the military has been
[36:57.840 --> 37:01.840]  training to engage the American people and that cities and towns have become
[37:01.840 --> 37:06.440]  federalized and they've swollen the numbers of paramilitary SWAT teams and
[37:06.440 --> 37:11.960]  auxiliary SWAT teams openly training them to engage the American people the
[37:11.960 --> 37:16.800]  military industrial complex the Patriot Act all of it openly being announced
[37:16.800 --> 37:24.440]  that it will be used and is being used against the people this is not your
[37:24.440 --> 37:31.600]  grandpa's army this is not your grandpa's or your uncle's Marine Corps this has
[37:31.600 --> 37:35.600]  been set up and prepared for us the American people and the people the
[37:35.600 --> 37:39.080]  world and the military starting to get wise to it and the police are starting
[37:39.080 --> 37:43.600]  to get wise to it and it's very sophisticated how the media puts out
[37:43.600 --> 37:47.760]  all these videos of cops stopping ambulances with pregnant women and cops
[37:47.760 --> 37:51.320]  stopping people with an 80-year-old who later died in the back of the car one
[37:51.320 --> 37:56.320]  mile from the hospital the media is playing this and encouraging this and
[37:56.320 --> 38:01.400]  the police are backing up their officers by design to convert them to nothing but
[38:01.400 --> 38:06.480]  mad dogs so the public will then hate them and the police will then hate the
[38:06.480 --> 38:10.680]  public and nothing but scum will be in the departments and then they can play
[38:10.680 --> 38:14.760]  us all off against each other I don't want that to happen I don't enjoy
[38:14.760 --> 38:18.480]  getting up here and going over the hundreds of news articles every day
[38:18.480 --> 38:23.360]  where police are absolutely out of control and I'll tell you this the
[38:23.360 --> 38:27.560]  citizens are out of control the society's out of control when you've got
[38:27.560 --> 38:31.520]  50 plus million dead babies because people kill their own kids their own
[38:31.520 --> 38:38.840]  future their own treasure because they're too lazy to use contraception and
[38:38.840 --> 38:43.320]  because they're too lazy to admit it's a baby that's out of control and even if
[38:43.320 --> 38:47.400]  you don't believe in God and karma or your report you so you better believe in
[38:47.400 --> 38:51.320]  the law of the universe and we've done a lot of bad things we've become decadent
[38:51.320 --> 38:56.600]  and sullen and weak myself included and now we're going into bondage every time
[38:56.600 --> 39:00.440]  people stop being involved in society every time people lose their morals and
[39:00.440 --> 39:04.280]  decide there's no morals except for eugenics and there's too many of us
[39:04.280 --> 39:09.880]  that's the new morals bad things happen and it's and I'm here trying to get
[39:09.880 --> 39:13.960]  people to believe in themselves and believe in humanity and believe in
[39:13.960 --> 39:19.720]  going to the next level and colonizing space and I believe that we can take
[39:19.720 --> 39:23.240]  control of our lives and I believe we can educate the police and military and
[39:23.240 --> 39:27.160]  government bureaucrats who don't see the big picture who are being manipulated
[39:27.160 --> 39:31.480]  and fill that vacuum in their hearts and souls people are empty they're not
[39:31.480 --> 39:35.160]  happy because they don't understand their human destiny they don't understand
[39:35.160 --> 39:38.640]  what reality is really like and how it's always a struggle just to survive and
[39:38.640 --> 39:42.920]  have freedom they think it is dancing with the stars and who marries a
[39:42.920 --> 39:48.960]  millionaire and all this crud they don't understand what human destiny really is
[39:48.960 --> 39:54.000]  a struggle against good and evil all of us alive one time on this planet
[39:54.000 --> 40:03.640]  deciding which side we're on will will serve good or evil so I beg you out
[40:03.640 --> 40:07.480]  there every single man woman and child of you listening I beg of you to learn
[40:07.480 --> 40:12.200]  about eugenics I beg of you to learn about IBM and Microsoft and how all the
[40:12.200 --> 40:17.840]  big corporations in the US the fortune 20 are all founded and funded and run
[40:17.840 --> 40:22.320]  for and by eugenics they don't believe in free market they believe in monopoly
[40:22.320 --> 40:27.040]  and they want monopoly so they can carry out their eugenics you know I just
[40:27.040 --> 40:31.920]  played that end of civilization clip where they admit they're going to chem
[40:31.920 --> 40:35.960]  trail us to save us because if they don't spray the atmosphere with a secret
[40:35.960 --> 40:39.680]  program and if they don't reduce our numbers the earth is going to die
[40:39.680 --> 40:45.640]  absolute total bull and then this article billionaire club and bid to curb
[40:45.640 --> 40:49.440]  overpopulation times of London ABC news they all reported it
[40:49.440 --> 40:52.760]  America's richest people meant to discuss ways of tackling a disastrous
[40:52.760 --> 40:56.880]  environmental social and industrial threat one-child policies for America
[40:56.880 --> 41:02.000]  you name it as they're now announcing on national news I told you two years ago
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.360]  in in game they were they're not doing it and it goes on to say why all the
[41:05.360 --> 41:09.800]  secrecy they wanted to speak rich to rich without worrying anything they said
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.600]  when end up in the newspapers painting them as an alternative world government
[41:13.600 --> 41:17.240]  he said oh because there is already in a world government they just didn't want
[41:17.240 --> 41:21.560]  to be known as an alternative world government all right once a month we
[41:21.560 --> 41:28.080]  have a sponsor on the show Marty Schachter who's a world war two chemical
[41:28.080 --> 41:34.240]  Corvette started it with his father in 1947 that is 60 plus years ago ladies
[41:34.240 --> 41:41.480]  and gentlemen and he has on an organic soap company before organic soap was
[41:41.480 --> 41:47.200]  cool it's certified California organic the highest standard and speaking of
[41:47.200 --> 41:50.640]  not being under the eugenics chemical weapon attack they know they take the
[41:50.640 --> 41:54.720]  byproducts of petrochemical the junk they can't sell and they put it in your
[41:54.720 --> 41:59.600]  in the perfumes and soaps and the detergents and well Marty's got high
[41:59.600 --> 42:04.800]  quality soaps at 85% off because he didn't do all the big advertising and
[42:04.800 --> 42:09.320]  because it's factory direct directly to you so I wanted to bring Marty up for a
[42:09.320 --> 42:12.280]  few minutes we'll get back into this and break down the casual society control
[42:12.280 --> 42:16.360]  grid Marty great to have you on my friend oh it's always a pleasure talking to you
[42:16.360 --> 42:21.760]  and your listeners Alex it's the highest peak of our month is getting
[42:21.760 --> 42:26.080]  acquainted with you and we missed you last month hopefully we'll get to get to
[42:26.080 --> 42:30.320]  know you and talk to you more this month absolutely Marty I hadn't had any on one
[42:30.320 --> 42:34.360]  about a month and a half you know side issue but I want to get into the soap
[42:34.360 --> 42:40.760]  but it all ties into that governments Hitler was into mind war eugenics war
[42:40.760 --> 42:44.200]  the British were into it the US was into it till he got embarrassed out of it
[42:44.200 --> 42:48.960]  the emperor took US and British troops and did eugenics experiments on them you
[42:48.960 --> 42:55.680]  were over there in the liberation of Japan eugenics I mean I see the
[42:55.680 --> 42:59.800]  chemicalization of everything part of the eugenics I know it is have you ever
[42:59.800 --> 43:06.120]  looked into Margaret Sanger and the Colgate Foundation and all that no yeah
[43:06.120 --> 43:11.200]  it's it's it's it's pretty hardcore well regardless tell us what on record the
[43:11.200 --> 43:16.200]  detergents and toxic subs are doing to us well first of all the chemicals are
[43:16.200 --> 43:23.160]  toxic they got it doesn't take much to pick up a bar of zest or dove or dial
[43:23.160 --> 43:29.040]  for Irish spring and read the side panel of all the chemicals that are in there a
[43:29.040 --> 43:33.840]  drugstore cannot even interpret them because some of them are completely
[43:33.840 --> 43:38.360]  made up and fictitious one of the main ingredients they're putting into our
[43:38.360 --> 43:43.360]  products is sodium chloride and you would think oh sodium chloride must be a
[43:43.360 --> 43:49.760]  little cleaner no sodium chloride is table salt now would you wash your face
[43:49.760 --> 43:55.040]  your body your baby with table salt this is what they put in there but why would
[43:55.040 --> 44:01.240]  they use table salt because it's a filler it's a weight enhancer because it
[44:01.240 --> 44:07.240]  only costs maybe a penny a pound and it's it's in there as low as the cost
[44:07.240 --> 44:13.640]  factor and this is what we feel that with one free phone call to us you could
[44:13.640 --> 44:21.880]  end your exposure to 17,000 toxic chemicals and junk science and household
[44:21.880 --> 44:27.400]  cleaning products and we guarantee that our guarantee is satisfaction guaranteed
[44:27.400 --> 44:33.120]  or double your dirt back explain some of the chemicals that are in the soaps and
[44:33.120 --> 44:37.160]  hair care products and all the crud people use I know I washed my hair after
[44:37.160 --> 44:43.600]  lunch this morning with Calvin shampoo but we feel only four products that we
[44:43.600 --> 44:52.080]  manufactured since since 1947 62 years of going down the drain we've been doing
[44:52.080 --> 44:57.840]  that we basically our basic products are coconut oils of the highest grade we
[44:57.840 --> 45:03.880]  call it USP grade which means United States pure vegetable oils that are
[45:03.880 --> 45:09.320]  compounded from various vegetables blended together we don't use perfumes
[45:09.320 --> 45:14.680]  which are toxic they burn the skin they stink up the towels they think up the
[45:14.680 --> 45:20.600]  room they stink up the walls and everything attributed to it don't need
[45:20.600 --> 45:28.000]  it we use fruit juices orange juice coconut juice lemon juice all these are
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.800]  juices for fruits just to give it a little aroma in the product but it
[45:32.800 --> 45:37.440]  doesn't stay on your skin it doesn't stay on your towels it doesn't stay in the
[45:37.440 --> 45:42.800]  air it's gone we feel that's the future even though it's from the 19th and
[45:42.800 --> 45:48.560]  early 20th century we're very stubborn here very old-fashioned and very
[45:48.560 --> 45:52.480]  conservative well that explains how the globalist reengineers society
[45:52.480 --> 45:58.800]  everything was real and pure until the 30s and 40s and 50s when they took
[45:58.800 --> 46:03.360]  mainly all the German chemical combinations because they were the
[46:03.360 --> 46:07.680]  masters of that as you know Marty and chemicalized everything they just took
[46:07.680 --> 46:12.600]  over the entire industry exactly the first company to do that was Lever
[46:12.600 --> 46:17.360]  Brothers which is an English company not an American company when they
[46:17.360 --> 46:23.040]  discovered the formulas that Nazi Germany was using in not making soap but
[46:23.040 --> 46:29.560]  making and you use that new word called detergent detergents are not so they're
[46:29.560 --> 46:34.800]  chemicals many of them toxic well the formulas came when they invaded the
[46:34.800 --> 46:40.840]  country got all their literature and files they were very adept in keeping
[46:40.840 --> 46:46.960]  everything and writing and say hey here we can make a cleaning product and maybe
[46:46.960 --> 46:52.320]  cost a couple of pennies a pound and we don't need soap anymore forgetting the
[46:52.320 --> 46:57.040]  pollution factor forgetting the toxic factor beginning all these factors long
[46:57.040 --> 47:02.360]  with claims and we can promote it with advertisement we can brainwash the people
[47:02.360 --> 47:06.400]  we can hypnotize the people this is what's happening right now with Proctor
[47:06.400 --> 47:10.440]  with Lever with Colgate and another dozen chemical companies that are
[47:10.440 --> 47:15.560]  promoting chemicals for the households to use who don't know any better so we're
[47:15.560 --> 47:20.480]  not here to sell anything we're going to educate the consumer so they have a
[47:20.480 --> 47:25.240]  freedom of choice to buy something that's twice as good that won't pollute
[47:25.240 --> 47:30.920]  they won't burn they will clean twice as good as Proctor in fact until about five
[47:30.920 --> 47:36.320]  six years ago Marty you only sold to big hospitals and finer hotels factory
[47:36.320 --> 47:41.760]  direct and Genesis got you to advertise factory direct to the general public so
[47:41.760 --> 47:45.160]  tell folks about some of the packages you've got from the tote bag sampler to
[47:45.160 --> 47:49.600]  the bigger supplies and how much they're gonna save but we go directly for the
[47:49.600 --> 47:53.600]  consumer they say well I could read your literature we send the free catalogs out
[47:53.600 --> 47:59.240]  but we want them to try the product so at our cost we put together what we call
[47:59.240 --> 48:08.080]  a one to two month supply kit or a bag of a tote bag of laundry soap and bath
[48:08.080 --> 48:14.680]  soap and hair soap and dish soap weighs out about six pounds cost $20 most likely
[48:14.680 --> 48:20.280]  no tax if it's out of California where we get in tax to death air in California
[48:20.280 --> 48:25.920]  that is and that'll give you a hook that'll get you to try the product then
[48:25.920 --> 48:30.400]  you want to save a big money I mean we talked about thousands of dollars a
[48:30.400 --> 48:34.920]  year and getting products that are so much superior to what you're using now

[54:41.720 --> 54:47.720]  I got no friends cuz I read the papers there can't be a thing
[54:47.720 --> 55:02.720]  oh that's true feeling mean no actually in the face of all the attacks and lies
[55:02.720 --> 55:15.200]  incredible disinformation I go through I turn into a nicer and nicer guy
[55:15.200 --> 55:20.360]  because I know it's human nature they know not what they do a lot of these
[55:20.360 --> 55:23.180]  folks that attack me aren't just government operatives or just info
[55:23.180 --> 55:34.160]  agents they didn't have great parents like I did they didn't have a lot of
[55:34.160 --> 55:40.520]  experiences I did to bring me to the point I'm at but I do have to answer
[55:40.520 --> 55:43.440]  some of the charges occasionally that I'm gonna get back into the eugenics news
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.560]  the police stay control grid coming up next hour and open the phones up as
[55:47.560 --> 55:54.840]  well I kept getting emails about this in the last few months and I thought it
[55:54.840 --> 56:01.240]  was a joke so I ignored it but it seems to have picked up steam and so I guess
[56:01.240 --> 56:07.800]  I might as well at least chime in on it it just really gets ridiculous and this
[56:07.800 --> 56:13.320]  is the type of stuff that discredits us this is why mainstream people laugh
[56:13.320 --> 56:17.760]  when they hear you question the government because the media is smart
[56:17.760 --> 56:22.720]  they focus in on the out-and-out kooks the out-and-out nuts the people they're
[56:22.720 --> 56:27.680]  just saying absolutely insane ridiculous things to make the rest of us who
[56:27.680 --> 56:31.240]  were questioning the official government story that's almost always a lie or at
[56:31.240 --> 56:36.960]  least partially alive it's always spent at least look stupid they do this guilt
[56:36.960 --> 56:39.880]  by association and you know none of us are perfect so I try not to be
[56:39.880 --> 56:47.120]  judgmental but it there are tens of thousands of sites or pages that come
[56:47.120 --> 56:56.120]  up saying I'm Bill Hicks and people actually believe it I mean big websites
[56:56.120 --> 57:01.000]  have it up and have our pictures side-by-side and really say I'm Bill
[57:01.000 --> 57:11.240]  Hicks and you know it's it's almost crazy to come on air and say I'm not Bill
[57:11.240 --> 57:17.160]  Hicks and in a way it only encourages it just like to come on air and say I'm not
[57:17.160 --> 57:21.600]  a reptoid because people blow up videos of me where there's two-point light in
[57:21.600 --> 57:25.000]  front of me and you know that puts to the image of two lights on each side of my
[57:25.000 --> 57:28.960]  eyes it makes it look like I have cat's eyes anybody in a studio looks like that
[57:28.960 --> 57:33.360]  with two-point lighting in the front classic three-point lighting and it's
[57:33.360 --> 57:38.520]  total schizophrenia and I don't work for the Vatican and I don't work for
[57:38.520 --> 57:42.680]  conservative groups and I don't work for any of this I'm just I'm the real deal
[57:42.680 --> 57:47.680]  and people just can't believe I'm the real deal well look at the fruits look
[57:47.680 --> 57:51.560]  how many people we've woken up and energized most the people that attacked
[57:51.560 --> 57:58.160]  me admit I woke them up and the reason I bring this up is the
[57:58.160 --> 58:03.880]  establishment is to blame for a lot of this because they have lied about so
[58:03.880 --> 58:10.400]  many things and been caught lying about so many things and been caught doing so
[58:10.400 --> 58:18.720]  many crazy things that then people will believe anything but I'm not gonna
[58:18.720 --> 58:24.160]  belabor it I just need to answer it on record and say that no I'm 35 years old
[58:24.160 --> 58:29.600]  and I was born in Parkland Hospital in Dallas Texas and I am not Bill Hicks
[58:29.600 --> 58:34.680]  Bill Hicks did not stage his death that's a very mean thing to say I've
[58:34.680 --> 58:37.840]  even talked to some of his family you know I know I'm a Bill really did die

[1:00:00.200 --> 1:00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:19.640]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:23.200]  Alex Jones
[1:00:23.200 --> 1:00:31.040]  I am going live at prisonplanet.tv simulcastic with the syndicated radio
[1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:36.800]  transmission T-minus seven minutes 25 seconds stay with us for that kinky
[1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:40.080]  freedman set to announce he's running for governor when he's in studio at least
[1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:43.640]  that's whatever my producer we'll see we'll talk about it that's coming up
[1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:51.160]  musician best-selling author that's how I met Jesse Ventura so separately I
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:54.520]  guess that's not how I met Willie Nelson Willie Nelson I ran into it a movie
[1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:59.480]  showing and then he contacted us but regardless a nice guy and we'll debate
[1:00:59.480 --> 1:01:03.600]  what the next gubernatorial run in Texas is gonna look like that should be
[1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:09.120]  interesting coming up next hour I also have a bunch of other important news
[1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:19.920]  that I'm going to be going over in this hour you know I I always get around to
[1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:25.160]  doing what I say I'm gonna do it just sometimes takes me longer you know because
[1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:30.000]  there's so many things to deal with in life but I have decided that I'm gonna
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:35.960]  start doing more special presentations kind of like I did an hour on FEMA camps
[1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:42.400]  a few months ago detailing all the facts and and the reality of them and I did a
[1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:46.800]  little bit of a breakdown yesterday for about 30 minutes I guess counting the
[1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:53.560]  ads about 25 minutes or so on the cashless society control grid and how
[1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:57.560]  that ties into cybersecurity and this big announcement and I'm gonna do
[1:01:57.560 --> 1:02:02.920]  eugenics updates as well more and more at least once a week I'm gonna tackle one
[1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:08.920]  subject with the detailed full spectrum breakdown of it and this is very hard for
[1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:15.240]  me to do because I literally can write hundreds of pages of notes if I don't
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:19.440]  stop and then I want to back up each statement I make with articles and
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:25.680]  documents then I just kind of get overwhelmed and it is neurotic you know I
[1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:29.080]  should just cover basic facts and not to make it too complex or too detailed
[1:02:29.080 --> 1:02:33.600]  just I want people to see the full spectrum of this the establishments on
[1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:37.080]  records saying they designed all this and set all this up and that it's all
[1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:41.760]  standardized and integrated but it's not enough to just read the quotes where they
[1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:49.560]  admit they're setting it up one needs to see it for themselves to really grasp
[1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:54.600]  it I guess that's what on the Isle of Patmos when the Apostles said that you
[1:02:54.600 --> 1:02:59.920]  know he wondered at the beast he couldn't describe it and it really is
[1:02:59.920 --> 1:03:06.440]  wonderment it's like trying to describe a Colorado mountain vista with all of
[1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:10.040]  its beauty with the Rocky Mountains its sunset in front of you how do you describe
[1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:14.720]  the rabbit that runs out on a grassy plane below you and elk a mile away and
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:19.560]  and and the feeling of the cold wind and the smell of evergreen and the crunch of
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:23.280]  gravel under your feet and the first planets and stars blinking into sight
[1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:28.680]  as nightfall comes and and and popcorn clouds I mean how would you do that well
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:33.560]  how would I describe this scene of Hades that I'm witnessing all the torments
[1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:39.080]  and enslavement and child kidnapping and genetic engineering and nightmares and
[1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:44.520]  pain and enslavement and barbarism and the plans future plans and folding and
[1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:48.960]  different different principalities in the New World Order bidding for control
[1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:52.680]  and this survival of the fittest with the most pure evil and wicked and
[1:03:52.680 --> 1:03:58.040]  cunning gets into the seat of power I mean how do I describe that I certainly
[1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:02.960]  can't describe a beautiful Colorado vista looking off the Rocky Mountains with
[1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:12.160]  ice blue lakes beneath looking like something out of Valhalla how do I
[1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:21.360]  describe that that Norse heaven well how do I describe this New World Order hell
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:27.520]  it can't be done so don't ever accuse me of saying things are worse than they
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:32.360]  really are it's so incredibly wicked I can't even describe it it's all the
[1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:38.200]  billions of sins and corruptions and lust and avarice woven together with a
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:47.240]  spirit an idea a life force a system living death released upon humanity but
[1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:53.000]  I will do my best in the coming days and weeks and months to have my testament
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:56.960]  on record of who this enemy is because who knows how long any of us have in

[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:55.480]  you just go info wars.com and check it out I'm wearing another one of our
[1:08:55.480 --> 1:09:00.920]  designer t-shirts worst president ever with George W. Bush on one side and right
[1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:06.360]  under it the other side of his face is a Barack Obama until now info wars.com
[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:11.040]  and on the back it says don't be a sucker info wars.com this will wake up a
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:15.000]  Republican or a Democrat you go to him and you say look have you seen all these
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:18.880]  members of Congress Republican and Democrat Ron Paul a Republican many
[1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:24.160]  other Democrats say foreign banks now rule America and dominate every facet
[1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:30.640]  of our lives and then you can break the conditioning literally having a
[1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:34.480]  discussion about this the left won't hate you the right won't hate you it will
[1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:38.320]  neutralize with a simple picture because most of the public is it like a
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:43.000]  second or third grade childlike level and you can like a storybook maybe I
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.800]  should write a children's book for adults you know for the general public who
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:50.400]  were kind of at that level where where it's a parable about how there's a good
[1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:54.160]  cop and a bad cop but kind of put it in a fairy tale situation and then you learn
[1:09:54.160 --> 1:09:58.600]  at the end that both guys were bad and that they were running a scam and that

[1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:31.520]  control grid and and and just use that new announcement this new cabinet level
[1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:35.360]  position under the White House not just an example of federalization and
[1:12:35.360 --> 1:12:38.920]  federal takeover and control but admitting everything will be wiretap
[1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:42.160]  which it already is this just expands it and admitting that so they can kill
[1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:50.600]  switch everything I want to I want to go over that today and tie it in to the
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:56.200]  whole eugenics situation but in the interest of time as we do have Steve
[1:12:56.200 --> 1:13:03.080]  Voss coming up and kinky Friedman in studio I want to go ahead run through
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:11.440]  some of the news that we have here here's my Wall Street Journal article
[1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:16.600]  stack of stuff just gets bigger and bigger here in a first high court
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:24.720]  affirms gun rights now remember we heard that June 27 2008 it was another
[1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:27.280]  Wall Street Journal I printed this this morning there's another Wall Street
[1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:35.040]  Journal dealing with how so do my oars rulings where she has said in previous
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:39.960]  federal courts that that's the one I want where she says yes you have a right
[1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:44.360]  for us to take your guns you have a right to join the military that is the
[1:13:44.360 --> 1:13:47.600]  second amendment no one is allowed to own guns the attorney general has that
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:53.200]  opinion Eric Holder the president as a state senator and US senator held that
[1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:57.000]  opinion that's on record it's not our opinion they've introduced bills to
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:01.760]  massively restrict the second amendment here's a Bloomberg I have on it but this
[1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:06.520]  doesn't really get into Sotomayor it says headline Chicago law banning hand
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:13.160]  guns in city upheld by court and the Wall Street Journal articles good as it
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:18.040]  gets into Sotomayor and then enlist all her activities a Chicago ordinance
[1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:22.960]  banning handguns and automatic weapons within city limits was upheld by the US
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:27.040]  Court of Appeals panel which rejected a challenge by the National Rifle
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:30.800]  Association the unanimous three judge panel ruled today that the US Supreme
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:35.640]  Court decision last year which recognized individual right to bear arms
[1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:39.160]  under the US Constitution second amendment didn't apply to states and
[1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:44.600]  municipalities and that's the Supreme Court ruling was five to four very very
[1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:48.080]  narrowly for the second amendment and I read the statements of the court which
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:52.680]  were added into precedent and I argued with some of the pro-gun groups and I
[1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:56.760]  said this is the consistent thing George W. Bush said and what Hangar
[1:14:56.760 --> 1:15:01.280]  Control Incorporated says they're saying oh you have a right second amendment if
[1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:05.000]  you're in the military but we have a right to ban your guns and I kept
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:08.760]  warning people this is what you're now going to see and now they've had states
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:13.680]  ruling this way cities ruling this way counties ruling this way and see the
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:17.480]  federal government's only there to protect the Bill of Rights and to have a
[1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:20.480]  Navy and defend the borders and to coin the money and they don't do any of those
[1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:24.560]  things are supposed to this is one issue where the states do not have a right to
[1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:32.600]  restrict the second amendment they have no right this is a federal right and it
[1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:35.720]  is also reserved to the states but when the states try to go after that or the
[1:15:35.720 --> 1:15:39.040]  feds do it's no one boy and I've read the anti-federalist papers the federalist
[1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:44.520]  papers I have read scores of books on the real second amendment and that is the
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:49.440]  facts anybody tells you something else they're a liar a Chicago ordinance
[1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:53.840]  banning handguns and automatic weapons within city limits was upheld by the US
[1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:57.480]  Court of Appeals panel which rejected a challenge the National Rifle Association
[1:15:57.480 --> 1:16:01.000]  the unanimous three judge panel ruled today the US Supreme Court decision
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:04.720]  last year which recognized an individual right to bear arms under the US
[1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:08.600]  Constitution second amendment didn't apply to states and municipalities the
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:13.880]  Supreme Court has rebuffed request to apply the second amendment the states
[1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:19.680]  US Circuit Court Frank Esther Brooke wrote up holding lower court decisions
[1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:24.440]  last year to throw out suits against Chicago and its suburb of Oak Park
[1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:29.960]  Illinois in Fairfax Virginia based NRA sued municipalities in June of 2008
[1:16:29.960 --> 1:16:34.240]  one day after the US Supreme Court decision the district of Columbia versus
[1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:39.360]  Heller struck down the handgun ban in the US Capitol District encompassing
[1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:42.680]  Washington it was seen this thing's making it sound reasonable they've got
[1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:46.640]  basically all guns banned in Chicago and if you can go pay for a special permit
[1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:51.720]  and jump through a bunch of hoops you can own one a rifle it was a total gun
[1:16:51.720 --> 1:16:56.360]  ban in DC for all intents and purposes but act like it was just handguns we
[1:16:56.360 --> 1:16:59.840]  clearly disagree with the court's conclusion representative of the NRA
[1:16:59.840 --> 1:17:04.640]  attorney William N. Howard a partner in Chicago's freeborn in Peters LLP so to
[1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:10.680]  tell of an interview the next step will be an appeal to the Supreme Court he
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:15.640]  recognized this may not be the end of litigation Ginny Hoyle a spokeswoman for
[1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:19.520]  the city of Chicago law department said acknowledging the likelihood the NRA
[1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:22.800]  would seek further review we're certainly prepared for that if it happens
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:27.160]  we're prepared to aggressively defend our ordinance because Chicago is mafia
[1:17:27.160 --> 1:17:32.200]  dawn daily run and when the mafia comes in and robs a bank they say get your
[1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:35.640]  hands up they make the security guard the American people drop their guns I
[1:17:35.640 --> 1:17:40.120]  mean Hitler took the people's guns Blacksworth couldn't own guns Native
[1:17:40.120 --> 1:17:43.520]  Americans couldn't own guns when you're gonna enslave somebody and muscle them
[1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:46.840]  and push them around you want them disarmed so you have to come to the
[1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:50.800]  mafia for protection which is the police and the government see they want to be
[1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:54.680]  able to oppress you and you can't resist them and they want crime to explode as
[1:17:54.680 --> 1:17:57.720]  their own white papers admit so there needs to be more and more cops more and
[1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:02.600]  more control to then feed off that larger crime system and basically tax the
[1:18:02.600 --> 1:18:06.600]  criminals so they want a big healthy crime syndicate to scare the sucker
[1:18:06.600 --> 1:18:10.880]  public into submitting to them and have a big healthy criminal system that they
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:14.320]  can suck off of as well so they suck off the criminals and they suck off the
[1:18:14.320 --> 1:18:20.400]  slaves the second amendment adopted in 1791 as part of the bill of rights the
[1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:23.520]  second amendment reads in its entirety a well-regulated militia being necessary
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:26.040]  the security of a free country and the right of the people keep their arms
[1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:29.400]  shall not be in French and heller the high court struck down the Washington
[1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:33.720]  32 year old gun law which barred most residents the city from owning handguns
[1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:38.400]  and required that all legal farms be kept unloaded and either disassembled or
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:42.280]  under trigger lock six residents have challenged the law saying they wanted
[1:18:42.280 --> 1:18:45.520]  firearms available in their homes for self-defense yeah people they got raped
[1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:51.200]  and robbed so there you go I told you what the Supreme Court ruling would do
[1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:55.880]  I've I read it and it says you got a right to the second amendment and then
[1:18:55.880 --> 1:18:59.320]  they say we're gonna define what second amendment means second amendment means
[1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:05.860]  we come and you hand your guns over period you have a right to turn your
[1:19:05.860 --> 1:19:09.320]  guns over because it says we have a right to ban whenever we want oh yeah
[1:19:09.320 --> 1:19:13.720]  you got a right but we got a right to ban it that's just like the United
[1:19:13.720 --> 1:19:18.520]  Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights articles 1 through 30 or is it
[1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:24.160]  31 an article 29 30 state oh all these great rights we just said you have that
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:28.920]  we say we give you you in doesn't give you anything you got to take it as a free
[1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:37.400]  person your red blood your guts gives you freedom they say in there in that
[1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:43.400]  piece of legislation that Obama's got introduced that they're gonna ban most
[1:19:43.400 --> 1:19:47.880]  the guns so this is happening this is going on and and in the articles of the
[1:19:47.880 --> 1:19:55.200]  UN charter of Declaration of Human Rights 29 and 30 it says all these rights
[1:19:55.200 --> 1:20:01.960]  don't count if we say they don't so it's no rights at all this is Alex Jones for

[1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:33.560]  you understand is recapping part one and getting into part two is that
[1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:38.480]  everything is globally standardized through the OECD the organization of
[1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:42.280]  economic cooperative development through the IMF the World Bank through
[1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:47.840]  treaties through NATO and of these dozens and dozens of groups there's less
[1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:52.720]  than 50 big powerful global groups they're all chaired by less than a
[1:25:52.720 --> 1:26:01.360]  hundred people and they all interlock on the different boards you know the heads
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:04.520]  of the Bilderberg group will be some of the head people on trilateral commission

[1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:38.000]  Davos and others it's the same crew the same people and they want the same thing
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:43.760]  eugenics now before I get into the cashless grid remember this story from
[1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:48.320]  a week or two ago and ABC News reported it first and said yes secret meeting of
[1:26:48.320 --> 1:26:53.240]  the world elite to carry out eugenics but they said it's a good thing billionaire
[1:26:53.240 --> 1:27:03.240]  club and bid to curb overpopulation through a world government and it has to
[1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:08.880]  be secret they say for your own good and it's Bill Gates it's David Rockefeller
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:13.080]  it's Warren Buffett it's Michael Bloomberg it's Oprah Winfrey Ted Turner
[1:27:13.080 --> 1:27:20.240]  all the usual suspects and they met at Rockefeller University president's
[1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:27.080]  private home Paul nurse and listen anytime you cover these anytime they
[1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:30.480]  have these meetings that's all they talk about how do we get world government
[1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:35.520]  world taxes and so how do we stage pandemics to get a control grid and
[1:27:35.520 --> 1:27:39.520]  it's sad we got to kill everybody but how do we do it you know Bill Joy of
[1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:43.000]  Sun Microsystems I always plug key things that are well known there's
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:49.040]  thousands things we could plug April issue 2000 of wired magazine why the
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:54.160]  future doesn't need us and he said I went to a top-tech private conference with
[1:27:54.160 --> 1:28:01.400]  200 top-tech leaders sworn to secrecy so I can't say the names this is the guy
[1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:05.360]  worth four billion bucks at that time you know owns one of the biggest
[1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:10.480]  infrastructure companies out there for IT Sun Microsystems and he says it was
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:14.920]  very upsetting it was how do we kill everybody or do we just call most of
[1:28:14.920 --> 1:28:18.240]  the people and then let them be entertained by the new technocracy and
[1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:25.880]  the elites leaning towards killing everybody and then he goes on to quote
[1:28:25.880 --> 1:28:30.280]  Theodore Kaczynski why did Kaczynski this this this professor this doctor
[1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:36.600]  admitted LA Times reports CIA operative he quits runs to the bush and starts
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:41.520]  bombing people for a decade bombing key and people over key
[1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:46.120]  technocracies I'm not defending what he did but that's a real
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:50.360]  environmentalist Kaczynski said my god they're planning to create a total grid
[1:28:50.360 --> 1:28:54.720]  create a new species of humanoids what the elites say they're doing merging
[1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:58.680]  with cybernetics and getting rid of most of us he said I gotta I gotta go kill
[1:28:58.680 --> 1:29:09.880]  these people I mean I go down the line and then you've got all the other
[1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:13.400]  transhumanist and I don't mean the general transhumans they always email me
[1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:17.000]  go how dare you say we're bad you know I'm blind and I want to have sight that's
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:24.440]  that you're not really a transhumanist Julian Huxley the brother of Aldous
[1:29:24.440 --> 1:29:31.680]  Huxley the head of the United Nations UNESCO department first general of it
[1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:38.560]  secretary general of it said that eugenics got a bad name with Hitler going
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:43.320]  too far too quickly we're gonna call the transhumanism the issue is Ray Kurz
[1:29:43.320 --> 1:29:47.040]  well in all them say the same crap how most of us are about to be wiped out
[1:29:47.040 --> 1:29:51.120]  we're gonna break all this down when we get back and get into the control grid

[1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:31.240]  system yesterday I explained how they get us to opt into the matrix how they
[1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:36.520]  make it entertaining the new Xbox scans your body 360 and you get to scan real
[1:33:36.520 --> 1:33:41.400]  objects and live in the fantasy world and it's better than the real world and
[1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:45.640]  and the kids don't talk to each other anymore they just sit there texting and
[1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:50.000]  adults don't communicate anymore and and massive television watching causes
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:53.960]  Alzheimer's and destroys language abilities literally hundreds and hundreds
[1:33:53.960 --> 1:34:01.160]  of studies on record reporting this and there's a global standardized world ID
[1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:05.760]  system not just a national ID through real ID there's a global treaty signed in
[1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:11.360]  2000 Australia by UN signatories including the United States and even if
[1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:14.320]  Congress doesn't ratify this stuff it's all standardized and done by the
[1:34:14.320 --> 1:34:20.360]  bureaucracies and they brought in the system so we now have a hemispheric ID
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:24.160]  card we've seen the radio and TV ads and print ads about oh go right through
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:29.480]  airports inside the US we accept the hemispheric cards if you're flying from
[1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:34.600]  Dallas to LA it doesn't matter if you're not leaving the US have this federal
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:39.160]  hemisphere card and you'll go to the front of the line and then see their
[1:34:39.160 --> 1:34:42.760]  feds are saying you'll have to have that card soon but they're getting people to
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:47.840]  opt in they're beta testing it they're they're they're fine-tuning it now you
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:51.160]  got to have a passport to go to Mexico or go to Canada they got to have it to
[1:34:51.160 --> 1:34:55.240]  come here now you get thumbprinted and face scanned randomly when you leave the
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:34:58.920]  US even if you're a citizen all the foreigners coming in have to do it and
[1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:02.400]  so in treaty agreements you go to England or Germany or anywhere in the
[1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:06.080]  world that signed on to these agreements that's most the West some of the
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:11.080]  third world they digitally take a photo they digitally thumbprint when you leave
[1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:16.720]  and I want to get to this exhibit first you know one of our employees the
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:20.640]  school in Hayes County tried to steal her eight-year-old daughter because she
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:25.720]  was wearing shorts had little bruise on her leg that made that news and they
[1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:29.360]  admit that you know Walmart employees are told if a parent grabs their kid and
[1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:33.520]  speaks to them loudly that that's a crime that your kid has to be taken I got
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:37.320]  the CPS manual given to my employee saying if you raise your voice we're
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:41.680]  gonna take your child official state manual I mean you talk about police
[1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:45.560]  state raise your voice now we take your kid but the cops can shoot you in the
[1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:52.280]  back in taser you and it's no big deal see how the state can have all this
[1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:56.480]  authority but parents can't have any and then society breaks down which then
[1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:00.440]  means there needs to be more federal control it's the only strong man it's
[1:36:00.440 --> 1:36:04.360]  the only thing that can is mayor daily the mob boss the son of the most famous
[1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:08.160]  mob boss in US history he wants your guns because he's gonna make you love
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:13.000]  him he's gonna take care of you well one of the guys that works here in the
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:16.760]  office brought this in and and we were already aware of this going on nationwide
[1:36:16.760 --> 1:36:20.960]  with the chips program with the masons put it on all these other groups doing
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:26.000]  it all federally funded they get grants to do this but McGruff the crime dog is
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:30.040]  directly federally funded and through the national ad council they're running
[1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:35.920]  national TV ads showing in red and black uniforms the new Obama armies doing
[1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:40.120]  military drills and saying this is my uniform this is what I wear and they're
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:44.160]  gonna march out across America and already are knocking on doors to canvas
[1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:48.440]  whether you support Barack Obama or not they have a little GPS separate from the
[1:36:48.440 --> 1:36:55.240]  census and they mark down of your friend or foe that in the free society and so
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:37:01.760]  under the national ad council elementary schools public schools head start which
[1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:05.960]  they advertise for blue collar white collar oh it's free health care and we
[1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:09.720]  have a mobile van that helps your kids you know even if you're paying at the
[1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:13.720]  daycare you know they still bring head start in without asking you and CPS is
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:18.160]  there and under head start now you get three CPS visits a year well here's what
[1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:22.320]  the kids get they get a little little badge to feel like they're a little
[1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:26.760]  stuzzy tattletale with McGruff the crime dog this is the casual society

[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:36.440]  to public school kids under another program here in Austin where they give
[1:37:36.440 --> 1:37:40.720]  you $200 if you turn in your parents that's the highest bonus if you write a
[1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:46.480]  report on what's in the medicine cabinet or are they smoking marijuana and then
[1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:51.200]  I have a mainstream news article today where the judges are saying we'll let you

[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:37.200]  tissue samples out of their mouth right now because we want you to think that we
[1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:43.800]  got their DNA this way that's why all over the country Tennessee Texas you name
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:48.320]  it a California they have thumb scanners and hand scanners in the car and when
[1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:51.280]  they pull you over for a traffic ticket or a checkpoint they say we need to run
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:54.680]  your your your scan here at the checkpoint people go there's even YouTube
[1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:58.920]  videos this way go I got a camera what do you want to take my fingerprints we
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:02.880]  got to make sure you're not wanted this in the fake ID guilty until proven
[1:40:02.880 --> 1:40:05.800]  innocent now what did they do to this little girl we've got her name and her
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:10.520]  little slave card this is what happens when you're when you're in and in
[1:40:10.520 --> 1:40:17.440]  preschool now McGruff safe kids total ID system help take a bite out of crime
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:20.400]  hey McGruff how about you stop the CIA shipping in heroin and cocaine and
[1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:25.480]  running child kidnapping ranks and it's a little girl she's got blonde hair and
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:29.360]  blue eyes oh you can see that little slave card CPS is slipping through this
[1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:34.640]  right now looking for any reason I'm sorry I've been for everybody and look
[1:40:34.640 --> 1:40:39.520]  biometrics they had her scan this was anklets and they put her digital image
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:44.360]  of her little fingers they've now got them all and she'll be trained in public
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:47.920]  schools nationwide over half of them now make you thumb print to buy and sell
[1:40:47.920 --> 1:40:52.440]  Austin make sure you use thumb prints to get your food to get your school books
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:57.000]  you have to do it Europe's implemented the same system Australia total slave but
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:04.400]  don't worry everybody's a slave now okay so this is all kept by the feds and
[1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:08.640]  by McGruff the child kidnapping dog he goes out and sniffs out the blonde hair
[1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:14.640]  blue-eyed kids looks like he found one and of course they want the dental chart
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:22.460]  they need to know everything when they're trafficking your kids now again the
[1:41:22.460 --> 1:41:25.760]  average idiot cops that are there taking this information they think they're
[1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:30.360]  doing good and helping but as the founding fathers said the road to hell is
[1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:35.000]  paid with good intention so there's your little biometric ID card slave card has
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:38.720]  nothing to do with keeping your kids safe everything to do with enslaving
[1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:42.000]  them that's why they've been lying for 36 years and telling you the blood was
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:46.440]  with a health department and a health test and sending it off to a federal
[1:41:46.440 --> 1:41:53.720]  depository at the eugenics bank at cold springs harbor now mainstream news that's
[1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:57.320]  the incredible thing we're on record about everything five six seven eight
[1:41:57.320 --> 1:42:01.960]  nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen years ago back I've been trying to dig
[1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:05.800]  around and find myself fifteen years ago in front of the county commissioners in
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:11.160]  city council a year plus before I got on air I was going down and talking about
[1:42:11.160 --> 1:42:14.520]  this the city council and they wouldn't give me citizens communications time or
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:18.360]  they'd cut me short so I went to an access TV show we ought to find those
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:27.320]  fifteen year old let me see nineteen ninety three ninety four right out of
[1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:34.080]  high school we ought to find those to put those up on YouTube okay this is part
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:36.960]  two I may go into part three and four on this because just covering that took
[1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:41.120]  so much time and this is the tip of the iceberg in fact I clean the studio the
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:45.760]  other day it's in one of those folders see of Duke and find the CPS folder that
[1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:50.160]  had all the stuff in it from her case with the little booklet from the state
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:53.200]  that says if you raise your voice we will take your children now there's no
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:58.800]  law that raising your voices they don't care these are child molestation rings
[1:42:58.800 --> 1:43:03.000]  and I don't care if you can't handle that last week I played congressional
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:07.360]  hearings where they admit they run child kidnapping rings in fact Google Google
[1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:12.000]  three thousand children missing in CPS custody in Florida three P three thousand
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:17.320]  children in in government custody missing in Florida CNN show them right now
[1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:21.120]  and they find them in Saudi Arabia and Thailand and Israel they find them in
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:25.040]  Eastern Europe they find them in snuff films they blow their heads off they
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:30.720]  enslave them show them three thousand children
[1:43:31.680 --> 1:43:37.440]  and that's just a missing children's try a try CPS lost they have a different
[1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:40.640]  name in Florida it's like family services family services loses three
[1:43:40.640 --> 1:43:48.120]  thousand children Florida it'll be 2004 I mean you can't make up the magnitude
[1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:58.520]  of their evil yeah or maybe thousands of children maybe the headline then you'll
[1:43:58.520 --> 1:44:03.040]  you'll say three thousand in the article turned out it was actually five
[1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:10.360]  thousand I remember that headline I'm sitting here looking at it we'll find it
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:15.760]  in a break all right so this is all part of the grid this is this is what they
[1:44:15.760 --> 1:44:20.360]  want to do to everybody with this giant control grid and there's federal funds
[1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:25.520]  served out with bounties on the kids they kidnap so they want to control your
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:30.680]  mobility track everywhere you go make you have a internal national ID to travel
[1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:35.080]  over state-to-state borders homeland security is on record saying that land
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:41.640]  of the free home of the brave the census program was to be every 10 years going
[1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:45.560]  back to Mount Sinai and then the Bill Wright's Constitution to enumerate how
[1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:50.320]  many members of the House representatives your state gets according to
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:54.000]  population now it's going to be a yearly and then a monthly census the
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:57.840]  American survey census there's a bunch of different variants they ask what guns
[1:44:57.840 --> 1:45:01.480]  do you own what are your stocks and bonds name them what type of toilet do you
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:05.600]  have what where do your children go to school what is your income and they say
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:09.720]  under threat of arrest if the answer this I thought you had a fifth amendment
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:15.080]  but you do it's all color of law fraud they have the US code by the first
[1:45:15.080 --> 1:45:18.920]  question about your names and who lives there and then they have a dotted line
[1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:21.480]  and under that's all the other questions just like there's no law to take
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:25.280]  vaccines and that's what this global cybersecurity grids about they say oh
[1:45:25.280 --> 1:45:29.280]  we're going to surveil the entire internet to tell if there's any outbreaks
[1:45:29.280 --> 1:45:33.680]  out there from chatter or up up ticks and people buying flu medicine for your
[1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:38.280]  safety and oh we have been able to shut the web down to protect it if al-qaeda
[1:45:38.280 --> 1:45:41.640]  attacks it and then all the Pentagon admits they've been attacking their own
[1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:47.840]  computer systems in the past as a pretext basically fear monger the
[1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:50.800]  government into giving them all this and J. Rockefeller is on record saying we
[1:45:50.800 --> 1:45:53.800]  would have been better off without ever having an internet the newspapers the
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:57.640]  mainstream media are dying they have to shut it down bring in net neutrality
[1:45:57.640 --> 1:46:03.800]  bring in a gelded castrated as the New York Times said safer gate kept gate
[1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:09.280]  keeper kept internet without people like Alex Jones so they have the census
[1:46:09.280 --> 1:46:13.640]  getting everybody's data into the grid GPS in your front doors the Department
[1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:17.280]  of Homeland Security reports saying environmental activists conservatives
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:21.840]  gun owners liberals conservatives Ron Paul supporters libertarians Bob Barr
[1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:27.600]  supporters people that talk a lot about the Constitution now there's the story
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:32.440]  out of Florida to say three thousand like I said control F 3000 on that
[1:46:32.440 --> 1:46:37.200]  article I want them to say it that's the right one control F 3000 it should be
[1:46:37.200 --> 1:46:43.000]  on there um want people to see this and know it's a living in denial as they
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:49.960]  watch out there again one of the biggest things is surveillance blimps at at
[1:46:49.960 --> 1:46:53.720]  hundred thousand feet being tethered that's MSNBC Associated Press that's
[1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:58.120]  Bob Woodward secret Pentagon technology he brags about that once they get a
[1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:04.560]  heat resonance of your body type and double ID that with a face scanning
[1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:08.680]  camera on the ground they can now track you anywhere and everywhere you go with
[1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:12.960]  these surveillance blimps where one blimp can surveil an average sized state
[1:47:12.960 --> 1:47:16.400]  and Homeland Security's now got them in place over the entire United States they
[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:20.720]  report they also have the face-scanning cameras on the polls the license plate
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:24.440]  reading cameras which then police and government bureaucrats according to the
[1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:27.680]  Orange County Register and other publications are above the law over a
[1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:31.480]  million people now in California the article two years ago said 990 something
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:35.920]  thousand over a million people are above the law they can DUI run through
[1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:40.360]  checkpoints run through toll roads they have special plates that the cameras
[1:47:40.360 --> 1:47:43.120]  can't read and that when police get behind them they're not allowed to pull
[1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:46.600]  over and they're not allowed to run their plates so not only will we be
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:51.160]  discriminated against slaves anti-war you can't fly if you have bad credit
[1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:55.920]  they're announcing you won't be able to fly no judge no jury if you're on a no
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:48:00.400]  fly list you won't be able to own guns no judge no jury no arrest no due process
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:03.600]  they just put you on that over a million one hundred thousand Americans on that
[1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:08.880]  growing carbon taxes will categorize and register everything you buy everything
[1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:13.200]  you sell everything you do with RFID smart chips to track the history of your
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:16.920]  purchasing any black market or underground economy will be a felony
[1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:21.520]  paying somebody cash to mow a lawn paying somebody to paint your house
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:26.520]  selling an old car to a buddy you'll still have cash it's globally standardized
[1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:31.640]  under the new announced global bank of the world with a global tax where they
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:35.000]  set the interest rates and world currency but you'll have to thumb print and
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:40.160]  face scan into the system for the global graduated sales tax when you pay with
[1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:43.240]  cash or that will be a felony I told you that ten years ago from federal
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:47.600]  documents that's now openly being announced and pushed
[1:48:49.480 --> 1:48:53.840]  now the most important point I made yesterday I want to recap is make money
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:57.200]  as you build the grid there's a few thousand globalist companies with Carl
[1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:02.240]  all group and Ted Turner and the Clintons and the Bushes and the and the
[1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:08.480]  royal family and England and the Dutch royalty and the and the bin Laden's are
[1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:12.880]  heavy in it owning the red light camera companies Lockheed Martin the Defense
[1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:18.760]  Department giving domestic contracts cities and counties of the police threat
[1:49:18.760 --> 1:49:23.440]  matrix grid integration centers the threat fusion centers federally run big
[1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:27.480]  hundred million dollar contracts even in middle-sized towns and cities and
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:31.920]  counties billion dollar contracts in New York and Boston two billion dollar
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:36.960]  contract in Boston that I saw just for cameras and the smart grid alone this is
[1:49:36.960 --> 1:49:42.080]  a total web and then that money goes to the politicians who go in a revolving
[1:49:42.080 --> 1:49:46.600]  door in and out of government that's what this tyranny is all about so they get
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:52.880]  rich off of selling the security grid to the Pentagon this dominated the world
[1:49:52.880 --> 1:49:58.480]  under North com now dominates the United States and just like in Fallujah and
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:01.520]  Iraq they thumb print you when you go in and out of the city and if you're caught
[1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:05.080]  without the ID or you lie when they thumb print you later they kill you on the
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:11.320]  spot that's that was on NBC news one week before he retired Tom Brokaw bragged
[1:50:11.320 --> 1:50:16.000]  and said he was glad I have the video clip they said they kill anyone who
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:20.400]  doesn't have a proper ID well that will be the system here announced and you'll
[1:50:20.400 --> 1:50:23.480]  be biometrically scanned everywhere to buy and sell biometrically scanned by
[1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:27.880]  police all being announced biometrically scanned by food they're starting it out
[1:50:27.880 --> 1:50:31.840]  with video games alcohol cigarettes minors but it's to go global this is
[1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:37.680]  all admitted by the big consortiums they're gonna have debtor prisons not
[1:50:37.680 --> 1:50:41.000]  just that you can't travel will be on a no-fly list if you have bad credit they
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:46.680]  are going to force you to work in federal programs if you have debt they
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:50.680]  want to take over with the national animal ID system and the premises ID

[1:56:31.400 --> 1:56:35.480]  coming this is the control grid shutting down and controlling over-the-counter
[1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:41.000]  vitamins making them prescription codex element areas the biometrics as I
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:45.400]  mentioned getting the school kids to all do it the DNA of the blood the NSA with
[1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:51.960]  warrantless wiretapping of the entire population cyber security again we keep
[1:56:51.960 --> 1:56:57.960]  mentioning that term that's just the feds by law going even to even small IT
[1:56:57.960 --> 1:57:02.720]  companies and smaller parts of the infrastructure and by law putting their
[1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:07.360]  machinery in and making you wire your machinery to it and they pay you to do
[1:57:07.360 --> 1:57:11.440]  it like a telecommunications act of 96 paid to do this for the phone companies
[1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:16.640]  and then the power quote to shut the web off during emergencies for all of our
[1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:24.200]  safety that's the headlines with Obama that way they can also cover up torture
[1:57:24.200 --> 1:57:27.100]  when they want to they can shut down the alternative media that is kicking the
[1:57:27.100 --> 1:57:32.320]  butt of the mainstream media I already mentioned CPS now there's a lot of good
[1:57:32.320 --> 1:57:38.480]  news to go over with this control grid and that is that we've said no to the
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:41.880]  national ID real ID act but the feds just ignore it and go ahead with the
[1:57:41.880 --> 1:57:45.240]  atmosphere ID card and say you better have this when you're at the airport
[1:57:45.240 --> 1:57:48.440]  even if you're not leaving the US you're gonna be treated better if you have this
[1:57:48.440 --> 1:57:52.200]  card and they tell folks that are on no fly list oh if you go through the
[1:57:52.200 --> 1:57:55.640]  background check even though you have no criminal record and we're just saying
[1:57:55.640 --> 1:57:59.200]  it's a mistake that you're on this the only way to get off is to apply for a
[1:57:59.200 --> 1:58:03.200]  hemispheric ID and then magically when you get the hemisphere North American
[1:58:03.200 --> 1:58:14.280]  Union ID when you magically get that card you then suddenly get to fly so see
[1:58:14.280 --> 1:58:17.560]  they put everybody on the list making you a criminal and then if you act we
[1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:21.200]  yes to being treated like a criminal oh we give you your privileges back that

[2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:11.200]  if I lose then I you know then I come back but this time I think may be
[2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:15.000]  different well yeah yeah that's on by anis I'm we're actually on some of their
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:19.160]  stations well I mean I mean they can't really can they legally have you not
[2:01:19.160 --> 2:01:22.640]  write a humor column or you know make a living while I'm running for governor I
[2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:25.840]  don't understand that they're just worried that the elections commission can
[2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:28.240]  come after him but I believe you have your first amendment I believe you should
[2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:32.360]  be able to have a radio show or there you go you know write books whatever no
[2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:35.000]  but let's get this out of the way first we'll talk about all the big news you've
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:40.960]  got last time you were on couple years ago my dad said that one of his professors
[2:01:40.960 --> 2:01:46.760]  that was also one of his advisors was your dad Tom Friedman and that they
[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:51.320]  that he had been in World War two in some of the same squadrons with my
[2:01:51.320 --> 2:01:55.520]  grandfather Jerry Jones as we were just talking about that during the break and
[2:01:55.520 --> 2:01:59.360]  what a small world it is and then my dad was digging through storage and found
[2:01:59.360 --> 2:02:04.040]  some more of their their flight school annuals and all that stuff and saw your
[2:02:04.040 --> 2:02:07.440]  dad in there so what a small world tell us about your dad it is well I'll tell
[2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:14.720]  you Tom was a navigator in World War two flew the B-24 the the liberator also
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:18.600]  known as the flying coffin flying coffin his plane was called the I've had it and
[2:02:18.600 --> 2:02:25.760]  there were 10 men on the plane Tom was the oldest he was 23 years old and he
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:29.600]  flew 35 missions over Germany that's makes him qualifies him for the lucky
[2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:34.280]  bastards club that's way over catch 22 so did he volunteer to go past the 22 I
[2:02:34.280 --> 2:02:40.480]  don't think that a choice that that's my my understanding of it but you know as
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:45.960]  Audie Murphy says I'm Audie Murphy Ronald Reagan and John Wayne spent the war
[2:02:45.960 --> 2:02:50.720]  in Hollywood and guys like Audie Murphy and then those that didn't come back
[2:02:50.720 --> 2:02:58.120]  fought to buy the freedom that the rest of us cherish and abuse well you know I'm
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:02.080]  not big on the Texas worship club but I am proud of our state and look at Audie
[2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:05.960]  Murphy from Texas so many other people I've talked to a lot of you know old
[2:03:05.960 --> 2:03:09.600]  veterans from the Army Rincor they say that the best soldiers come from Texas
[2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:13.840]  yeah I've been reading a lot about Audie and that appears to be true and you
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:18.000]  know Audie was rejected by every branch of the service he was not he was too
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  small he was five foot five and weighed 110 pounds and so forth and but it
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  didn't take long to see what he was really made of and there's a great
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:31.880]  story we should have told this well I did it quickly but it was Audie when Audie
[2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:36.840]  was fighting in France and he woke up one night in the forest and his hair was
[2:03:36.840 --> 2:03:39.600]  frozen to the ground and they told him you're in charge the officer has been
[2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:44.600]  killed he only had 18 men to man the front lines and he gets up there it's
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:49.840]  outside of a little village in France and there's 250 snow-caped clap clad
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:55.080]  Germans with six tanks round of the corner and Audie told all his men to
[2:03:55.080 --> 2:03:59.240]  go into the to the forest and he fought them off himself he jumped on top of the
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:04.880]  only tank destroyer that he had which was on fire and held held them all off and
[2:04:04.880 --> 2:04:08.760]  he was on the phone calling in artillery and they said Audie how close are the
[2:04:08.760 --> 2:04:15.000]  crouch and he says hold on a minute I'll let one of the bastards speak to you ten
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:19.440]  yards away yeah anyway he killed like a hundred hundred and fifty of them and for
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:23.400]  that he won the the Medal of Honor well that's certainly a fighting spirit he
[2:04:23.400 --> 2:04:27.240]  not only had a lot of courage he also was charmed yeah he was he was very
[2:04:27.240 --> 2:04:34.800]  lucky but he represents just just a greatness in this country that and I'm
[2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:38.760]  sure Audie would say that the young generation has it that you know they're
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:44.000]  that if the chips were really down they would deliver to absolutely or it's my
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:48.320]  like Chuck Yeager from West Virginia will be right back with a true Texas
[2:04:48.320 --> 2:04:53.480]  original kinky Friedman and we will get into his run for governor and a lot more

[2:08:16.920 --> 2:08:19.880]  grandpa were in the war together so I ought to be nice to him anyways but he's
[2:08:19.880 --> 2:08:24.880]  flying me with cigars during the breaks listen now now I wish I had a cigar an
[2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:29.280]  official cigar just just made Raleigh Jones with me on it but I think he

[2:08:41.560 --> 2:08:45.480]  message to young people and cigars are good for you and they help you live
[2:08:45.480 --> 2:08:49.320]  longer and if there's any research done on it you'll see that that the people
[2:08:49.320 --> 2:08:53.960]  that smoke cigars like Winston Churchill let live to be 90 you know Mark Twain
[2:08:53.960 --> 2:08:59.000]  Thomas Edison George Burns George Burns there's lots of examples of it but
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:04.400]  basically I've been against these smoking bands and and I just don't think
[2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:10.240]  it's it's on American for one thing and for another they're always saying you
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:13.080]  know there they are a bunch of hall monitors Alex there they're hall
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:16.240]  monitors control freaks that's all they are and they're saying we're doing it for
[2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:20.640]  your health kinky we're doing it for your health and the truth is there are six
[2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:28.680]  countries in this world I'll name them Israel Japan Spain Portugal Italy and
[2:09:28.680 --> 2:09:34.280]  France all of them have a higher smoking per capita than the United States of
[2:09:34.280 --> 2:09:39.160]  America and all of them have longer life expectancy than the United States of
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:43.920]  America yeah I've seen those statistics how do the French drink and smoke and
[2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:48.960]  everything here's here's what I conclude speaking English is killing us
[2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:54.400]  oh my god so I mean really like TV is killing us I tell you America should be
[2:09:54.400 --> 2:09:59.560]  that Alex Jones restaurant no smoking right next door kinky kinkies cafe
[2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:04.400]  smoking allowed that's the way America ought to be that would be the easy you
[2:10:04.400 --> 2:10:07.600]  know American way to go but we don't do it you know it's killed these restaurants
[2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:11.960]  and bars it's killed every mom and pop place Alex yes it has that's the people
[2:10:11.960 --> 2:10:15.680]  stay home and and smoke because you know smokers are guys or whatever instead of
[2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:19.240]  going to some bar and now they have the cops coming in hotel bars when people
[2:10:19.240 --> 2:10:22.720]  are staying their businessmen and arresting them for three bears what
[2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:26.280]  happened if you were governor that would not happen we have to kill all that
[2:10:26.280 --> 2:10:30.480]  officer that would not happen yeah that that's that was the low point it really
[2:10:30.480 --> 2:10:35.080]  was bad it's it's a terrible use of law enforcement to tell a little old lady
[2:10:35.080 --> 2:10:39.680]  that she's got to move from this park bench to this park bench if she's gonna
[2:10:39.680 --> 2:10:43.120]  smoke her cigarette and law enforcement knows this I mean you know that they
[2:10:43.120 --> 2:10:47.920]  don't want to do that but they have to investigate some wing nut that reports
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:52.200]  you're smoking on the show here you've got a guest smoking on the show and they
[2:10:52.200 --> 2:10:56.280]  got to send somebody out here to check it out and and that too is just just a
[2:10:56.280 --> 2:10:58.720]  way you want to break the Austin ordinance on air and smoking here we
[2:10:58.720 --> 2:11:03.120]  certainly could wouldn't bother me I mean what would happen really I don't think
[2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:07.240]  anything will happen SWAT teams might come try it or not go ahead sure we'll
[2:11:07.240 --> 2:11:10.000]  give it a shot oh now we're being really rebellious and landed the free home of
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:14.320]  the brave god I'll tell you Alex we're risk takers just thank god it's not a
[2:11:14.320 --> 2:11:18.760]  Cuban he's firing up here we'd really be arrested this is a Cuban that's the
[2:11:18.760 --> 2:11:27.600]  inside joke yeah but we didn't it's a gift even was a gift Alex I want to give
[2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:31.360]  you these this is brand new teachers for kinky bumper stickers oh great because
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:35.320]  you are a teacher and I'll tell you what you've taught and I don't want to put you
[2:11:35.320 --> 2:11:41.040]  up in a pedestal here anything I just you have taught people not to trust their
[2:11:41.040 --> 2:11:45.320]  government as much as they blindly have been doing for the past few decades and
[2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:49.720]  people are getting the message and I'll tell you Barbara Jordan who's a
[2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:54.520]  personal hero of mine Barbara Jordan's grandfather you know she was a
[2:11:54.520 --> 2:11:59.080]  congressman from from Texas as close to a statesman as Texas has had in modern
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:03.120]  days her grandfather owned a junkyard in Houston and he told Barbara when she
[2:12:03.120 --> 2:12:08.800]  was five years old love humanity but don't trust him that is the true message
[2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:13.120]  of Jesus that's what he said and getting into politics I see exactly what
[2:12:13.120 --> 2:12:16.640]  he's talking about that you know socrates lost the election you know
[2:12:16.640 --> 2:12:22.320]  Jesus lost the election the crowd said free Barabas killed Jesus well that's
[2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:24.960]  what my mother said to me she came down and visited when we're down at the
[2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:29.480]  beach this weekend for my daughter's birthday and she pointed out she said
[2:12:29.480 --> 2:12:32.800]  it's taking me this many years to figure out not everybody's nice not
[2:12:32.800 --> 2:12:36.880]  everybody had nice upbringing or nice parents they're just a lot of bad people
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:39.560]  out there there's also a lot of good people but good people are always
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:43.360]  gullible and and don't realize they got to stand up and fight or the bad guys
[2:12:43.360 --> 2:12:47.560]  are gonna win that's absolutely true and and the a great example of that is the
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:52.600]  Democrats of Texas I mean I'm running in the Democratic primary but but I would
[2:12:52.600 --> 2:12:56.640]  say that if the Democrats nominate their usual establishment candidate that they
[2:12:56.640 --> 2:13:01.080]  always do a generic establishment candidate they will be just another
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:05.960]  loss they will continue the 18 year losing streak of not having one
[2:13:05.960 --> 2:13:11.320]  statewide race going Democratic and I'm saying all they need is common sense
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:15.920]  they need an old-school guy like me that has common sense that is practical I
[2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:20.480]  don't want to fall on my sword just to make a point I want to win so we're
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:24.960]  showing the Democrats we're offering an option a new model for the Democratic
[2:13:24.960 --> 2:13:29.240]  Party which includes libertarians independence and many many Republicans
[2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:34.400]  welcoming them all over now you ran as an independent last that's right and
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:38.720]  are you running as a Democrat because I guess having the machine will help you
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:43.160]  somehow you know Alex I listened to your pal Jesse Ventura who I admire very
[2:13:43.160 --> 2:13:47.160]  much and I listened to the people that ran Jesse's campaign and they told me
[2:13:47.160 --> 2:13:52.120]  what works in Minnesota will work in Texas human nature and the truth is
[2:13:52.120 --> 2:13:57.480]  we're not in Minnesota Toto that's the truth Texas is very different there's
[2:13:57.480 --> 2:14:00.480]  more people in Houston than there are in Minnesota this was eight years later you
[2:14:00.480 --> 2:14:04.440]  know he had the CIA two weeks into office 23 of them visiting to find out how
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:08.680]  he won and the system's done a lot try to stop independence since then oh there's
[2:14:08.680 --> 2:14:12.480]  no question I we did the spiritually correct thing because I felt that the
[2:14:12.480 --> 2:14:15.120]  Democrats were getting too close to the Republicans there wasn't much
[2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:19.000]  difference between the two and and the truth is what has made the Democrats
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  great over the past century is populism is they stood up for the people against
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:27.840]  these big corporations and special interest which is what you're doing
[2:14:27.840 --> 2:14:32.040]  whether you like it or not you're a Democrat well I understand that we
[2:14:32.040 --> 2:14:34.400]  didn't have parties at first in this country and they are always
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:39.400]  interchanging Republican Democrat what it means you are for controlling the
[2:14:39.400 --> 2:14:42.560]  borders how is that gonna fit into the Democratic Party when we know what
[2:14:42.560 --> 2:14:46.400]  Democrats is actually popular but the party leadership won't do anything about
[2:14:46.400 --> 2:14:51.480]  it well I would say that a lot of my views are libertarian yeah I mean I
[2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:56.120]  want to miss the border another is toll roads I want to roll back all toll
[2:14:56.120 --> 2:15:00.200]  roads get rid of all of them and pay for them with casino gambling that has
[2:15:00.200 --> 2:15:05.080]  never been tried in any state that would work the lottery boy the more I
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:08.880]  read about the lottery we are getting we're getting hoes so bad on the Texas
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:13.280]  lottery I was in the Austin Airport two weeks ago and this guy Larry Throm came
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:18.080]  up to me and gave me his card very nice guy he's the executive CFO of the Dallas
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:21.840]  Independent School District before that he was a CFO of the Austin
[2:15:21.840 --> 2:15:25.840]  Independent School District so I asked Larry Larry is there any evidence that
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:29.800]  this money going to the lottery is coming to education as it's supposed to do
[2:15:29.800 --> 2:15:33.000]  you see any evidence of that he says no I don't see any because there isn't any
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:36.720]  he's and his what about all the weird scandals with the lottery well there
[2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:39.600]  you go they fired the last three directors you know and paid them off big
[2:15:39.600 --> 2:15:44.240]  bucks very in rapid succession all the problem with a lottery is it's owned by
[2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:48.080]  an Italian corporation and we go through G tech that's the way we do this thing
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:52.840]  and the Georgia lottery is owned by the state of Georgia and that's why the
[2:15:52.840 --> 2:15:56.600]  Georgia lottery sends every kid with a B average in high school to college free
[2:15:56.600 --> 2:16:00.800]  for four years in Georgia and this year for the first time Georgia University
[2:16:00.800 --> 2:16:04.160]  University of Georgia has two road scholars no other institution in the
[2:16:04.160 --> 2:16:07.960]  country has them they're from the Hope Scholarship which comes right out of
[2:16:07.960 --> 2:16:12.880]  the Georgia lottery Georgia I think is number 18 or 19 in education in the
[2:16:12.880 --> 2:16:15.880]  whole time how did that scam work how does the lottery money not get to
[2:16:15.880 --> 2:16:19.160]  education well here's how I guess is Don Carly only runs a lot of no no here's
[2:16:19.160 --> 2:16:22.680]  how it happens Rick Perry and the powers it be put it right into the education
[2:16:22.680 --> 2:16:27.160]  fund general fund and then they take it out when they need it for highways or
[2:16:27.160 --> 2:16:31.800]  for other things they can always get money and and this fund as Alex Jones
[2:16:31.800 --> 2:16:35.880]  would tell you if you really trust the government and you think they're totally
[2:16:35.880 --> 2:16:40.640]  honest great I most people no longer do they're taking this money they're
[2:16:40.640 --> 2:16:44.360]  fleecing it lobbyists and politicians are taking that money and using it for
[2:16:44.360 --> 2:16:49.920]  their own cause and it never never never gets to long to talk more well I'm
[2:16:49.920 --> 2:16:53.960]  gonna talk more about your policies and also your your gubernatorial campaign
[2:16:53.960 --> 2:16:57.320]  site but what about Rick Perry did you see in the newspaper where he was the
[2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:03.560]  first US statesman ever first high-level politician to admit he went to the
[2:17:03.560 --> 2:17:06.720]  Bilderberg Group meeting was in the Dallas Morning News which by the way is
[2:17:06.720 --> 2:17:09.560]  a violation of the Logan Act you can't go to a private meeting to discuss
[2:17:09.560 --> 2:17:15.560]  policy which they admit they do there and he's so arrogant he admitted that he
[2:17:15.560 --> 2:17:21.360]  did that I mean his governor would you call for investigation of that or try
[2:17:21.360 --> 2:17:27.240]  to stop that well I I think Rick Perry has look he's a guy who's great at
[2:17:27.240 --> 2:17:31.160]  jumping in front of parades Alex you know very well we've never heard a
[2:17:31.160 --> 2:17:35.280]  whimper from Rick about states rights or about libertarianism or anything until
[2:17:35.280 --> 2:17:39.680]  I got popular with any jumped in front of the teabag parade yes yes and he is
[2:17:39.680 --> 2:17:43.240]  better friends with the German government with the European governments and
[2:17:43.240 --> 2:17:47.320]  with the Mexican government then he is with the people of Texas and he likes
[2:17:47.320 --> 2:17:50.960]  being governor and that's where the story ends he and Kay Bailey are have been
[2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:54.680]  in the hands of big but well she is on the Bilderberg steering committee you
[2:17:54.680 --> 2:17:58.920]  talk about big evil offshore banks that are raping this country were 14.8
[2:17:58.920 --> 2:18:03.840]  trillion she is on the steering committee and then now she reportedly
[2:18:03.840 --> 2:18:08.320]  brought him in what are those two doing are they staging something to to split
[2:18:08.320 --> 2:18:11.560]  up vote to stop you or something I mean what what's going on there because we
[2:18:11.560 --> 2:18:14.280]  know these two are working together well and they act like they're fighting on
[2:18:14.280 --> 2:18:17.840]  the surface let's get those Barbies out of here is what I say you know they're
[2:18:17.840 --> 2:18:21.760]  both former cheerleaders you knew that didn't you yeah we are yeah we don't
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:26.520]  need more cheerleader before you did you know there were hall monitors yes so
[2:18:26.520 --> 2:18:30.120]  these are little tattletales yeah they are and now and I think the state's
[2:18:30.120 --> 2:18:34.320]  tired of man I think you've got a huge amount of disgruntler Republicans for
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:38.080]  all I know you might be one of those folks but people who at one time believed
[2:18:38.080 --> 2:18:42.080]  in either Rick or Kay and now they don't and I'll tell you what when Rick and Kay
[2:18:42.080 --> 2:18:46.080]  turn around after this bloodbath that's coming this two locomotives colliding
[2:18:46.080 --> 2:18:49.640]  you know they're gonna find all the wrong the Ron Paul people are gonna be
[2:18:49.640 --> 2:18:55.000]  on they're all gonna be kinky Democrats well I know this kinky I agree with you
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:58.600]  on about 80% of the stuff you do and that's that's that's as much as I agree
[2:18:58.600 --> 2:19:02.120]  with my wife so I mean that's you know not bad but but but at the same time I
[2:19:02.120 --> 2:19:05.000]  know you're better than these establishment candidates kinky Friedman a
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:10.560]  million times better than K. Belly Hutchinson the cheerleader Bilderberg
[2:19:10.560 --> 2:19:15.360]  group steering committee member I mean top globalist top corrupt new world
[2:19:15.360 --> 2:19:19.800]  order and then Rick Perry the toady of the group I certainly hope you kick
[2:19:19.800 --> 2:19:25.880]  their butts we intend to what's the battle plan to get that done well for
[2:19:25.880 --> 2:19:29.880]  one thing we're just just ending the exploratory phase we're very soon gonna
[2:19:29.880 --> 2:19:33.760]  jump full into this thing pull the trigger and part of that is gonna be
[2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:37.240]  going out on a listening tour where I can sharpen my listening skills Alex
[2:19:37.240 --> 2:19:43.200]  which do need some sharpening and meet the teachers meet the the county chairs
[2:19:43.200 --> 2:19:49.040]  you know meet the people in places where Democrats fear to tread go and
[2:19:49.040 --> 2:19:52.360]  that's the Obama strategy actually he was going on a 50-state strategy
[2:19:52.360 --> 2:19:55.920]  everybody told him you can't win Virginia you can't stay there gotta break
[2:19:55.920 --> 2:19:58.760]  let's come back here more about your strategy more about the websites kinky
[2:19:58.760 --> 2:20:03.200]  Friedman.com linked up on info wars Ted Anderson listeners of the network are
[2:20:03.200 --> 2:20:06.560]  familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit
[2:20:06.560 --> 2:20:10.400]  spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that
[2:20:10.400 --> 2:20:13.920]  some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can
[2:20:13.920 --> 2:20:17.560]  remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small
[2:20:17.560 --> 2:20:21.240]  portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit
[2:20:21.240 --> 2:20:24.640]  spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure
[2:20:24.640 --> 2:20:28.880]  deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:32.800]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[2:20:32.800 --> 2:20:36.600]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[2:20:36.600 --> 2:20:40.760]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability I
[2:20:40.760 --> 2:20:45.240]  recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned
[2:20:45.240 --> 2:20:48.880]  into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been driven
[2:20:48.880 --> 2:20:53.520]  by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for more

[2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:19.920]  well he is a Texas original as I said earlier Kingie Freedman is our guest in
[2:24:19.920 --> 2:24:24.160]  studio running for governor and he's the only chance you've got to not have
[2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:28.800]  pay belly Hutchinson or Rick Perry the two cheerleaders and the only question is
[2:24:28.800 --> 2:24:33.200]  which one of them is more Nelly than the other but you know that's fine you know
[2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:37.120]  the issue is is that Kingie Freedman is the real deal and his daddy was up there
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:41.160]  in the airplanes of my granddaddy over Europe and World War two that that's a
[2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:45.040]  small world of I keep going back to what my dad called him said yeah you know you
[2:24:45.040 --> 2:24:47.520]  know they were in some of the same squadrons and things in Europe that was
[2:24:47.520 --> 2:24:52.880]  really wild small world he learned that from your dad when he was at UT as a my
[2:24:52.880 --> 2:24:56.640]  dad's professor but again teachers for kinky is one of the bumper stickers
[2:24:56.640 --> 2:25:00.960]  kinkyfreedman.com how do people they're out there listening all across Texas and
[2:25:00.960 --> 2:25:03.200]  it's pretty clear you're gonna run you're gonna run we can tell you're running
[2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:07.400]  how do they get some of these bumper stickers well kinkyfreedman.com just go
[2:25:07.400 --> 2:25:11.880]  to that and order them and and by the way last time I don't know how many do we
[2:25:11.880 --> 2:25:17.360]  have Jewford over 70,000 small donations to the campaign contributions we had
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:21.320]  more than any other can weigh more than any other candidate and we were doing
[2:25:21.320 --> 2:25:27.520]  something that Obama did successfully and Ron Paul did successfully and I I
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:30.280]  think it's the people that are gonna make the differences I don't think it's
[2:25:30.280 --> 2:25:33.760]  the money I think it's it's really the people being the lifeblood of politics
[2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:40.440]  absolutely specifically getting into this campaign you were making some great
[2:25:40.440 --> 2:25:44.840]  points during that last break we should have that on air behind the scenes you
[2:25:44.840 --> 2:25:48.040]  were breaking down I was saying Democratic Party how are they how are
[2:25:48.040 --> 2:25:53.640]  they taking your run in the party instead of an independent well I it's
[2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:57.640]  early days to tell many statewide Democrats are embracing me and saying
[2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:00.320]  it's great this is what you should have done last time and they're right I
[2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:05.560]  should have because I would be the governor but the Democratic establishment
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:10.160]  is tough Alex a lot of them have been presided over so many losses now for 18
[2:26:10.160 --> 2:26:14.000]  years ever since Ann Richards that they're used to falling on their swords
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:18.560]  you know they're used to being purists and purists just don't get it done and
[2:26:18.560 --> 2:26:25.240]  I'll give you an example why I like a common-sense old-school pragmatic
[2:26:25.240 --> 2:26:30.760]  approach to things is that I'm I'm a Democrat but I'm also a Texan by that
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:37.480]  I mean I'm a libertarian I'm a populist you look at if this had been five years
[2:26:37.480 --> 2:26:40.320]  ago we would have thought libertarians or creeps they're weirdos you know they
[2:26:40.320 --> 2:26:44.000]  just a fringe I'd say Texas is most Texans are libertarian they've done
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:47.520]  national studies and over over 50% of Americans when asked libertarian
[2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:52.000]  questions in a blind study right then identify as libertarians look at the
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:55.280]  Ron Paul revolution and I agree with you they're gonna support you over Perry
[2:26:55.280 --> 2:26:59.200]  and Kbelly Hutchinson a heartbeat and I'll tell you something else it's not
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:02.680]  about big government or small government it's about it's about efficient
[2:27:02.680 --> 2:27:07.200]  government that's what it's about and and Ron Paul was the only one I know who
[2:27:07.200 --> 2:27:13.080]  called this this a financial economic disaster two years ago right he's he
[2:27:13.080 --> 2:27:17.440]  said that everybody said he's crazy this George Bush the NBA from Harvard never
[2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:23.080]  saw it coming Obama never saw it coming Ron Paul did see it coming and the
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:27.440]  Ron Paul people I feel a real affinity for them and Ron Paul also said the way
[2:27:27.440 --> 2:27:30.440]  this bailout was gonna happen was gonna make it worse and now the head of the
[2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:34.800]  World Bank had to come out two days ago and say we are basically screwed so we
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:38.800]  certainly need you as governor here in Texas instead of Perry I mean look at
[2:27:38.800 --> 2:27:44.280]  Perry saying we might succeed spinning the national movement for states rights
[2:27:44.280 --> 2:27:48.680]  it's not secession into something like secession so we could be demonized then
[2:27:48.680 --> 2:27:52.280]  later they said are you serious he said no I was just joking I mean it's like
[2:27:52.280 --> 2:27:56.880]  you said he is he is jumping you know on the states rights bandwagon when he
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:27:59.880]  won't even protect the border except secession might be a good idea because
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:04.040]  we get rid of Rick Perry you know that might be the only way well he'd be here
[2:28:04.040 --> 2:28:07.520]  for life if we don't get rid of him I mean he will if he's as lucky as he's
[2:28:07.520 --> 2:28:11.600]  been he will be the Hugo Chavez of Texas and he'll be the governor for life it's
[2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:15.560]  really sad Alex because I can't think of one I mean I'll challenge Rick Perry to
[2:28:15.560 --> 2:28:19.320]  a tequila drinking contest I'll do anything to get this man to interact
[2:28:19.320 --> 2:28:23.360]  with the people of Texas just a little bit and I can't think of one thing he's
[2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:26.360]  done for the people what about more debate ten years shouldn't we have five
[2:28:26.360 --> 2:28:29.800]  or six debates instead of one Jesse told you what happened he said kinky had
[2:28:29.800 --> 2:28:32.640]  trouble with his debate there he said but he had trouble with his first debate
[2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:36.200]  but there were 15 more of them and he got better and better as it went as he
[2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:41.160]  caught on to it because guys like Perry they're slick man Kay Bailey they've
[2:28:41.160 --> 2:28:44.240]  got political operative experts sure they do that are you know trying to make
[2:28:44.240 --> 2:28:48.680]  you look stupid and things that's right so so we welcome as many debates as we
[2:28:48.680 --> 2:28:52.000]  can you wonder why Rick Perry won't even go to a basketball game because he gets
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:57.080]  booed he won't take questions from people calling in on the show and and you
[2:28:57.080 --> 2:28:59.880]  know an example of what he did you know he lives in a house that we're paying
[2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:04.200]  ten thousand bucks a month for right now every month the taxpayers are that's a
[2:29:04.200 --> 2:29:07.800]  political statement Mike Huckabee the governor of Arkansas when that mansion
[2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:11.800]  was being remodeled he moved a double wide onto the grounds and he moved his
[2:29:11.800 --> 2:29:15.240]  family in there and that was his office he worked out of there that's a
[2:29:15.240 --> 2:29:19.920]  political statement to a good one and it's just incredible I know why do we
[2:29:19.920 --> 2:29:24.120]  let him get away with I mean even if that was just political hype by Huckabee
[2:29:24.120 --> 2:29:29.200]  still he need to do that Perry just doesn't care Perry likes to shop in
[2:29:29.200 --> 2:29:33.040]  Europe he likes to be governor he likes to wear nice clothes live in a silk
[2:29:33.040 --> 2:29:38.600]  underwear house no and you know what you know what he knows how to play the
[2:29:38.600 --> 2:29:42.640]  system he knows how to game the system and and that's the end of point is I
[2:29:42.640 --> 2:29:47.120]  don't know anybody Alex I know you I know Jewford I know the people can't
[2:29:47.120 --> 2:29:49.600]  you freeman stay there we got a break we're gonna come right back talk about

[2:33:56.760 --> 2:33:59.960]  your passion for saving animals in that big event that's coming up
[2:33:59.960 --> 2:34:03.080]  happy to i just had one flash i wanted to suggest you what do you think about
[2:34:03.080 --> 2:34:07.480]  the idea of administering the tax test to let to the legislature
[2:34:07.480 --> 2:34:10.920]  of the governor doing that when i'm governor i think it's a good idea but
[2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:14.040]  why don't you explain that to people you know it's a tax test that we take here
[2:34:14.040 --> 2:34:17.800]  in texas that is a narrow band of knowledge that you learn
[2:34:17.800 --> 2:34:22.120]  and everything is determined from that and uh most states have that now
[2:34:22.120 --> 2:34:26.280]  and what this really does is it's the opposite of education education should
[2:34:26.280 --> 2:34:30.760]  teach kids to think on their own so instead i run into a teacher in san
[2:34:30.760 --> 2:34:33.560]  atone who says i'm a world history teacher they've already told me
[2:34:33.560 --> 2:34:36.600]  go easy on greece and roam don't cover them much because they're not on the test
[2:34:36.600 --> 2:34:39.160]  this year well how can you teach world history without
[2:34:39.160 --> 2:34:42.280]  greece and roam it's the foundation to understand
[2:34:42.280 --> 2:34:46.680]  how society works yeah so anyway enough of that
[2:34:46.680 --> 2:34:50.520]  what we're gonna discuss alex well no i wanted you to plug the event the musical
[2:34:50.520 --> 2:34:53.720]  event the musical event we're having is a benefit for utopia animal rescue

[2:35:57.400 --> 2:36:00.680]  no i have two dogs no more that's it that's no more
[2:36:00.680 --> 2:36:04.520]  and i have three children it is a three-ring circus now if i had a ranch
[2:36:04.520 --> 2:36:06.840]  i'm thinking about trying to move out to some property just so things aren't so
[2:36:06.840 --> 2:36:10.120]  crazy but three kids and two dogs you can move out to the hill country and
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:13.640]  there goes the neighborhood exactly uh...
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:16.760]  no you're you're a big success story now i'm telling you that uh... the people
[2:36:16.760 --> 2:36:18.280]  i've talked to have really
[2:36:18.280 --> 2:36:21.640]  whatever attitude they had about you and i had the same credibility
[2:36:21.640 --> 2:36:25.480]  hump to get over which is you know basically
[2:36:25.480 --> 2:36:29.080]  the democrats and republicans last time because i was an independent always
[2:36:29.080 --> 2:36:29.800]  said
[2:36:29.800 --> 2:36:32.680]  where's the substance is he serious is he this and that
[2:36:32.680 --> 2:36:35.880]  and for fundraising it was tough and uh...
[2:36:35.880 --> 2:36:39.000]  now i see as a democrat uh... most of that has gone away and i am being a
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:41.880]  little more serious and more thoughtful you were saying during the break the
[2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:46.040]  key here is the establishment democrats i like you but statewide they love you
[2:36:46.040 --> 2:36:51.240]  that's right the establishment i would say the far left bloggers and they are
[2:36:51.240 --> 2:36:54.920]  they're sniping at me while i'm sniping at rick perry here i am attacking rick
[2:36:54.920 --> 2:36:57.800]  perry and i look around and the people that are attacking me
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:00.760]  are the democrats instead of them attacking rick perry
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:03.640]  well that is because you are an outsider if they weren't attacking you and i've
[2:37:03.640 --> 2:37:05.240]  seen i've seen in the press
[2:37:05.240 --> 2:37:08.360]  then i would say oh and i'm not for kinky freedman i mean that's really kind of
[2:37:08.360 --> 2:37:12.280]  the bonafide seal of approval when you really see
[2:37:12.280 --> 2:37:15.480]  well on old world war two saying when you're over the target you get the
[2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:16.280]  flag
[2:37:16.280 --> 2:37:19.240]  yeah and if they were praising you i'd go i don't know
[2:37:19.240 --> 2:37:22.520]  and and we have things as you know now nationally
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:25.880]  everybody knows about the state school cock fights human cock fights and
[2:37:25.880 --> 2:37:27.240]  corpus christie where they
[2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:30.760]  had a couple kids i wanted to ask you about that all the sexual abuse of the
[2:37:30.760 --> 2:37:33.640]  kids the state police texas rangers are to stop it
[2:37:33.640 --> 2:37:36.520]  they get shut down what would you do as governor texas youth commission
[2:37:36.520 --> 2:37:38.360]  well i'll tell you something alex
[2:37:38.360 --> 2:37:41.080]  uh... this is the heart of the problem since rick perry's done basically
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:42.440]  nothing in my opinion
[2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:46.760]  the bad thing that he's done is he's used a spoil system for appointing people
[2:37:46.760 --> 2:37:49.800]  a political spoil system and what he does is
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:53.720]  he appoints people in six-year terms mostly so if he appoints you because
[2:37:53.720 --> 2:37:56.840]  you're one of his uh... and they don't have campaign guys
[2:37:56.840 --> 2:38:00.040]  uh... and you don't really care too much about the state school situation your
[2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:01.880]  rubber stamp or rick perry
[2:38:01.880 --> 2:38:05.320]  uh... what happens is when you go into a mental hospital if you've ever been to
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:08.680]  any of these uh... nursing homes or anything like the hellish institution
[2:38:08.680 --> 2:38:11.320]  you know where abuse is going on everybody knows it
[2:38:11.320 --> 2:38:14.680]  it's like a boil on your hand the janitor knows it the director knows it
[2:38:14.680 --> 2:38:17.960]  no heads ever old for this nobody's been fired
[2:38:17.960 --> 2:38:21.320]  what perry has done with these appointments in criminal justice and i'll
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:25.480]  tell you another one is a man named tim cole who died he was a rapist
[2:38:25.480 --> 2:38:30.200]  accused of being a rapist thirteen years he died in prison this is lubbock
[2:38:30.200 --> 2:38:35.000]  uh... the now now the innocence project has cleared him with dna not the state of
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:38.520]  texas but the innocence project some college kids
[2:38:38.520 --> 2:38:42.440]  cleared this guy and the real rapist has confessed so now that
[2:38:42.440 --> 2:38:46.520]  uh... that uh... timothy cole is dead he's been exonerated totally his family's
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:51.000]  been uh... reimbursed so forth and and and this is a failure this is not a
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  success story how many tim cole's are there in the system they show dna
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:58.120]  testing show about a third of people are or innocent they end up test
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:02.440]  oh yeah and in nebraska and dna their death row several years ago they had nine
[2:39:02.440 --> 2:39:06.520]  people on it five could not possibly have committed the crime at which point
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:08.920]  the governor said this is a charade
[2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:12.680]  you know we can't do this so i call upon it will see i was always for the death
[2:39:12.680 --> 2:39:15.480]  penalty and i'm surfing rubbing i was always for it
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:19.640]  until i realized yeah i mean it was on tv you catch the guy it's clear they did
[2:39:19.640 --> 2:39:21.800]  it this guy grab a little kid raped him and killed him
[2:39:21.800 --> 2:39:26.760]  kill him i for an eye that makes sense but the government the system so corrupt
[2:39:26.760 --> 2:39:30.760]  that they send so many innocent people to death or into you can't trust it
[2:39:30.760 --> 2:39:34.120]  the system is so broke it does so much more damage
[2:39:34.120 --> 2:39:37.000]  well i mean what's the old saying of here's here's here's a solution guilty
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:39.960]  men go free you know better than one innocent man
[2:39:39.960 --> 2:39:44.600]  well people who are christians have to have to define what that means
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:48.520]  what it means to be a christian so say i do something terrible like you described
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:52.360]  do we want to kill him or are we doing the same or do we want to put him away
[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:55.800]  where he'll never never never see the light of day
[2:39:55.800 --> 2:39:59.800]  but we will not kill him and uh... frankly you know i hate for you to have to
[2:39:59.800 --> 2:40:02.840]  hear this from a jew but uh... but that's who you heard it from the first
[2:40:02.840 --> 2:40:05.800]  time but uh... that if you're a christian
[2:40:05.800 --> 2:40:08.520]  you really don't want to be a part of the system that's killing people
[2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:11.560]  particularly innocent people i believe not i'm not a
[2:40:11.560 --> 2:40:14.360]  bleeding heart liberal it's saying a half of these people are innocent
[2:40:14.360 --> 2:40:17.640]  i'm saying that if some are innocent and we're killing them
[2:40:17.640 --> 2:40:21.080]  uh... we're gonna stop that we'll see that's my issue i'm actually for the
[2:40:21.080 --> 2:40:24.280]  death penalty if it could be done right now it can't be but i mean what about
[2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:27.640]  houston and dallas and i can't be it can be done as well as we run the post
[2:40:27.640 --> 2:40:31.000]  officer as well as the wall that's going up between mexico and texas
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:35.080]  uh... that whatever the feds do cannot be done whatever the government does
[2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:37.480]  will not be that's what i was going to say it
[2:40:37.480 --> 2:40:41.960]  is that i mean i know you've heard about houston and dallas with the cops all
[2:40:41.960 --> 2:40:45.960]  over the family and throw a bag of chalk in the back and then seize the car
[2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:48.920]  saying it's drugs i mean how did the police i don't know they're not all that
[2:40:48.920 --> 2:40:52.280]  bad and it's city by city you got bad cities and good
[2:40:52.280 --> 2:40:55.480]  cities on average but i don't know cops in austin aren't
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:40:58.920]  planning drugs and i know of but in dallas npr even report the police
[2:40:58.920 --> 2:41:03.400]  admitted they frame thousands i mean here here's one solution
[2:41:03.400 --> 2:41:06.600]  get a guy like kinky freedman in his governor who doesn't owe anybody and
[2:41:06.600 --> 2:41:09.640]  doesn't know anybody okay and i appoint a guy like racehorse
[2:41:09.640 --> 2:41:14.040]  hains to uh... head up an abuse commission
[2:41:14.040 --> 2:41:17.400]  and this is a legacy for a guy like racehorse in other words he doesn't need
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:21.000]  to do it he's got plenty of money he believes in justice
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:25.400]  so he goes case by case all through death row all through texas youth commission
[2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:28.440]  through all of it and empower these people i don't want to commission giving
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:32.440]  me a report i want some powerful people jim hightower
[2:41:32.440 --> 2:41:36.520]  is a man who believes in the people in the poor people
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:40.280]  he's a unabashed champion for working families now a guy like that
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:43.160]  is not going to be stealing money you won't catch him in a scandal
[2:41:43.160 --> 2:41:46.840]  taking money he really cares about his job rick perry
[2:41:46.840 --> 2:41:50.840]  has appointed people that are going to leave a very long nike footprint on the
[2:41:50.840 --> 2:41:56.200]  forehead of texas well absolutely i mean you know love kinky freedman or
[2:41:56.200 --> 2:41:59.640]  hating folks and i love him uh... we need to get him elected governor because
[2:41:59.640 --> 2:42:03.960]  of the other choices we have uh... i mean if ron paul was running for governor
[2:42:03.960 --> 2:42:07.400]  i'm sorry kinky had to go with ron paul but but but you know because i mean i'm
[2:42:07.400 --> 2:42:09.640]  a hundred percent with him or i'd say ninety nine percent
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:13.640]  but i mean you are a good genuine real guy who wants to do good and wants to
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:17.880]  follow bill writes a constitution and you've got the establishment democrats
[2:42:17.880 --> 2:42:21.080]  against you the people love you and i've seen the the numbers out there
[2:42:21.080 --> 2:42:24.280]  uh... how do folks get you elected as governor how do we ensure you do run i
[2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:26.760]  mean i could tell you're fired up you're gonna run aren't you
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:30.440]  yeah yeah uh... it's it's almost a done deal and
[2:42:30.440 --> 2:42:33.640]  and the reason is that i know i can excite the grassroots
[2:42:33.640 --> 2:42:37.160]  and that's where the democrats have lost ever since and richards they have failed
[2:42:37.160 --> 2:42:40.440]  to excite the grassroots so the libertarians and the independence
[2:42:40.440 --> 2:42:45.080]  just stay home this time the kinky democrat idea the year of the kinky
[2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:48.840]  democrat would be it'd be like a reagan democrat except going the other way
[2:42:48.840 --> 2:42:52.840]  reagan democrat voted republican the kinky democrat
[2:42:52.840 --> 2:42:56.120]  votes democratic in the democratic primary which by the way alex is very
[2:42:56.120 --> 2:43:00.760]  easy to do it's an open primary you can be a republican you can say you know
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:04.200]  i've had a with these two barbie's spending all this money attacking each
[2:43:04.200 --> 2:43:08.040]  other for what they both in politics their whole adult lives
[2:43:08.040 --> 2:43:10.760]  you know they've got nothing fresh or new to offer
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:13.720]  uh... will vote for kinky will be kinky democrats
[2:43:13.720 --> 2:43:17.320]  you know as much as i don't like rick perry and he's been on the show before
[2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:22.040]  by the way as much as i don't like him i really don't like kbelly hutchinson i
[2:43:22.040 --> 2:43:25.640]  mean she really is a completely fake person
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:29.800]  i mean she is i mean at least perry's got some personality and and and i mean
[2:43:29.800 --> 2:43:34.680]  with her this really is a power hungry crone
[2:43:34.680 --> 2:43:38.920]  rick is a you know i do think he's a nice guy would say is clueless
[2:43:38.920 --> 2:43:41.640]  as far as the people are concerned he's had plenty of time now he's had nine
[2:43:41.640 --> 2:43:44.280]  years right he's moved us i think from
[2:43:44.280 --> 2:43:49.320]  49th to 48th in education and in that time which one do you dislike more
[2:43:49.320 --> 2:43:53.000]  policy-wise or just the whole i'm not a good politician but i but a good
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:55.400]  politician would tell you that we don't look ahead of that we're just trying to
[2:43:55.400 --> 2:43:58.920]  win the primary here because i know that if i can win the primary
[2:43:58.920 --> 2:44:03.400]  i can be the governor that i'm sure of absolutely and the democrats ran weak
[2:44:03.400 --> 2:44:08.760]  candidates last time yeah and and uh... you know i mean i i i tell you i fell
[2:44:08.760 --> 2:44:11.800]  under jesse ventures orbit there and there's a lot of wisdom
[2:44:11.800 --> 2:44:15.240]  that those people in minnesota have uh... but but the
[2:44:15.240 --> 2:44:18.520]  honest to god truth is there's more democrats in the state than there are
[2:44:18.520 --> 2:44:21.320]  republicans right now the latest gallup polls show that
[2:44:21.320 --> 2:44:24.280]  and if you have the independence and the libertarians to that
[2:44:24.280 --> 2:44:27.240]  well it's a slam dunk i mean we will beat the republicans
[2:44:27.240 --> 2:44:31.000]  but we'll only do it with a guy like me who is a who has a
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:35.320]  common sense old school guy your only problem is going to be all people are
[2:44:35.320 --> 2:44:38.200]  already finding out obama is going back on his promises
[2:44:38.200 --> 2:44:41.080]  and that that democratic support may be eroding
[2:44:41.080 --> 2:44:43.960]  by two thousand and ten some of us don't think it's going to be
[2:44:43.960 --> 2:44:46.600]  uh... i mean like you said the first time in decades
[2:44:46.600 --> 2:44:49.720]  uh... or half a century texas is more democrats in the bubble bomb is not a
[2:44:49.720 --> 2:44:51.640]  couple of really good things one of them
[2:44:51.640 --> 2:44:54.920]  he's made people believe that their vote matters that their vote could count you
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:44:57.560]  know he did bring in a lot of new voters alex i can't tell you how many people
[2:44:57.560 --> 2:45:00.840]  i talked to who supported me and just concluded that there was no way i could
[2:45:00.840 --> 2:45:03.320]  win and the vote would very foolish vote yeah
[2:45:03.320 --> 2:45:06.520]  lots of those folks in this time i think they may take it all right let me throw

[2:46:18.280 --> 2:46:20.840]  this comment that i had the last two elections
[2:46:20.840 --> 2:46:26.120]  i wrote in jesse's name for president well you know we've asked vinter to run
[2:46:26.120 --> 2:46:30.120]  for president i know and uh... and and run for senate and you know he's just
[2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:34.280]  so sick of the whole system he's running off and hiding in mexico surfing and
[2:46:34.280 --> 2:46:37.880]  and uh... i don't blame him i don't blame him a bit but but james i appreciate
[2:46:37.880 --> 2:46:39.880]  your call let me get a comment from kinky on that
[2:46:39.880 --> 2:46:44.280]  well i mean that's what's so nasty about politics you are waiting into a cesspool
[2:46:44.280 --> 2:46:47.160]  yeah well uh... jesse did some very good things in minnesota
[2:46:47.160 --> 2:46:50.760]  uh... he was one of the architects of uh... minnesota care
[2:46:50.760 --> 2:46:53.960]  which made them number one in health care coverage
[2:46:53.960 --> 2:46:57.080]  alex do you know where texas ranks in health care coverage would you like to
[2:46:57.080 --> 2:47:00.440]  hazard a guess i believe we're one of the worst
[2:47:00.440 --> 2:47:03.960]  no we're not we are fiftieth we're dead last
[2:47:03.960 --> 2:47:07.560]  fiftieth in health care coverage i mean that
[2:47:07.560 --> 2:47:11.000]  if i was a member of the media i would kind of i'd be concerned about that
[2:47:11.000 --> 2:47:13.800]  about the lottery uh... about the border
[2:47:13.800 --> 2:47:17.000]  uh... about every time you turn around you see a toll road and
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:20.920]  by the way uh... don't ask for who the road tolls it tolls for rick perry and
[2:47:20.920 --> 2:47:25.080]  his cronies well never stops tolling well that's why perry should be impeached
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:27.880]  he keeps saying he's against the toll roads of special interest
[2:47:27.880 --> 2:47:32.600]  he's the guy vetoing vetoing vetoing vetoing the legislature i mean this
[2:47:32.600 --> 2:47:37.720]  guy is an outrageous deceiver well he plays the system well alex
[2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:41.160]  he plays it beautifully and uh... bernie madoff would have been a good governor
[2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:44.360]  by that standard he really knows the ins and outs of the system too
[2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:47.880]  so people wonder can kinky govern you know does he know this stuff
[2:47:47.880 --> 2:47:51.240]  yeah i know this stuff i know that no governor has ever run the schools or the
[2:47:51.240 --> 2:47:54.760]  prisons or the highways we only had one governor who knew how to plan a
[2:47:54.760 --> 2:47:58.200]  highway you know who that was it's a trivia question
[2:47:58.200 --> 2:48:01.320]  and richards no other governor knows how to do that
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:05.480]  but they appoint people and perry has appointed the wrong people
[2:48:05.480 --> 2:48:09.400]  he's appointed the kind of people that made louisiana a corrupt cesspool for
[2:48:09.400 --> 2:48:13.080]  the past century politically well that's the problem of the corruption like
[2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:16.360]  they have in mexico and north korea once it gets in place it's very hard to
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:20.040]  dislodge and it's going to seed right now and we just got no common sense
[2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:23.000]  we're as far as this casino gambling is going
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:26.280]  we're building roads in louisiana right now we're building public schools in
[2:48:26.280 --> 2:48:29.720]  louisiana i mean why aren't we more concerned with
[2:48:29.720 --> 2:48:33.080]  getting the money back here for our own economy in texas
[2:48:33.080 --> 2:48:37.800]  well i'm no big fan of uh... gambling but it's it'll save galveston but but
[2:48:37.800 --> 2:48:41.560]  well certainly what it used to be there but but i mean the whole issue is
[2:48:41.560 --> 2:48:44.120]  that why do you have a state running and i think the state
[2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:46.440]  should get out of the lottery and if people want to have that stuff that's
[2:48:46.440 --> 2:48:49.880]  their business well it certainly shouldn't be a foreign corporation texas
[2:48:49.880 --> 2:48:52.360]  has leaned on foreign corporations for the toll roads
[2:48:52.360 --> 2:48:54.520]  we defer everything if we do build a fence there
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:57.640]  with mexico what's probably a foreign corporation that's going to have to
[2:48:57.640 --> 2:49:02.760]  to run it that's just ridiculous i mean we either do it ourselves or don't do it
[2:49:02.760 --> 2:49:05.560]  yeah the you know the crazy thing is you've talked about how the the
[2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:09.400]  lotteries run by an italian company i had the chronicle come out and say it's
[2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:11.800]  not true that cintra is spanish
[2:49:11.800 --> 2:49:16.360]  cintra on record is a spanish company i mean the level of disinformation i've
[2:49:16.360 --> 2:49:19.320]  spoken with elliott shaffley who i believe is a senate
[2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:23.560]  uh in the legislature he's a liberal el paso guy's a very good guy but he was
[2:49:23.560 --> 2:49:26.760]  in on the meeting with the cintra guys and he says they asked cintra in the
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:31.160]  last 50 years the last five years of the 50 year lease the last five years
[2:49:31.160 --> 2:49:34.360]  what would it cost the texan to drive 10 miles say
[2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:37.400]  and the cintra boys said well that'll take some time to compute
[2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:41.400]  and they said we've got time tell us and they computed it and they figured it
[2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:44.760]  out in the last five years of the lease with cintra
[2:49:44.760 --> 2:49:48.920]  it will cost the texan 15 bucks to drive 10 miles
[2:49:48.920 --> 2:49:52.280]  that's the deal rick perry's offering us well i saw the paper admitting that it
[2:49:52.280 --> 2:49:55.400]  was 160 something dollars i forget the exact amount
[2:49:55.400 --> 2:49:59.960]  to drive from austin to dallas and back i mean that turns your car
[2:49:59.960 --> 2:50:03.800]  into a taxi cab alex we are no longer the minority what we're saying is
[2:50:03.800 --> 2:50:07.400]  is believed by the majority of the people
[2:50:07.400 --> 2:50:11.480]  okay they agree with us it's just a question of getting them excited getting

[2:57:53.720 --> 2:57:59.640]  go to the bar to go have a beer they don't have one beer they go to the bar and they have three or
[2:57:59.640 --> 2:58:04.920]  four and they get and they drive home but they don't have at the majority of the people won't

[3:09:10.360 --> 3:09:13.400]  Steve Voss he's i'm into familiar with his work for probably
[3:09:13.400 --> 3:09:19.960]  10 11 12 years he's got quite a few great albums many of them have made national charts
[3:09:20.520 --> 3:09:26.520]  that because his music is anti-globalist anti-new-old-order pro america the establishment has tried to
[3:09:27.320 --> 3:09:33.960]  shut him down but unsuccessfully and you know you've probably heard part of this song played
[3:09:33.960 --> 3:09:37.560]  his bumper music and a few of his other songs played here but today we're going to play with
[3:09:37.560 --> 3:09:41.160]  his permission a couple of them in fact let's keep rolling with renegades right now if we can

[3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:21.000]  dot com's the website s t e v v a u s dot com boss is spelled v a u s dot com and i really think
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:27.240]  of this song as the patriot anthem of when it comes to heroes renegades are mine and it wasn't
[3:10:27.240 --> 3:10:32.600]  for the renegades people saying no to king george the third no to slavery and no to tyranny and
[3:10:32.600 --> 3:10:39.480]  no to big brother we would have no freedom and no to the soviets and that's what we're facing here
[3:10:39.480 --> 3:10:48.600]  today in fact crank this part up right here where are the renegades in the world today
[3:10:48.600 --> 3:11:00.760]  who are the renegades in the world today thank god for the renegades and the lives they leave

[3:11:29.720 --> 3:11:36.440]  to have you on with us sir i'm a huge fan of you and you are certainly a very talented musical renegade
[3:11:38.040 --> 3:11:43.080]  i'll play that just sing what's on my heart and it's a pleasure to be on with you i've heard
[3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:48.840]  your name for a long time and i just i consider real honor to be able to share the air with you
[3:11:49.560 --> 3:11:55.320]  well it's good to have you here with us tell us about yourself and kind of your saga your story
[3:11:55.320 --> 3:12:00.280]  of success and how they tried to shut you down and the rest of it and and then what your perspective
[3:12:00.280 --> 3:12:08.840]  is on what's happening in the world today my son the patriotic music star
[3:12:09.720 --> 3:12:18.680]  a two uh i live in southern california most of the time and uh i got so then frustrated with
[3:12:18.680 --> 3:12:24.360]  you know illegal streaming across the border and that was the year the riots in los angeles and
[3:12:24.360 --> 3:12:30.760]  and all that kind of stuff and you know i got to a point where i couldn't sit silently anymore
[3:12:31.480 --> 3:12:40.440]  and so i wrote a song from my heart called we must take america back and it just it lit a
[3:12:40.440 --> 3:12:48.920]  firestorm when people heard it uh it kind of kind of tripled out there on its own and uh
[3:12:48.920 --> 3:12:53.960]  uh all of a sudden one of the record companies out there wanted to put it out on a record
[3:12:53.960 --> 3:13:03.480]  and uh make it available nationally and oh and i was right you know it was zooming up the charts
[3:13:03.480 --> 3:13:10.600]  uh got to number 56 or 52 on the billboard country charts and it was the most requested song in the
[3:13:10.600 --> 3:13:15.560]  nation on country radio the first few weeks it was out but then a funny thing happened
[3:13:15.560 --> 3:13:21.960]  some of the most powerful some of the most influential country radio stations in the
[3:13:21.960 --> 3:13:27.400]  big city said hey look we don't care where it is on the charts we don't care how many requests
[3:13:27.400 --> 3:13:34.920]  we get for it we're not going to play it because we don't agree with it and that was the end of
[3:13:34.920 --> 3:13:41.080]  my rca career they cancelled my tour took the record out of the stores told radio stations
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:47.160]  to stop playing it and i'll tell you what that lit my fire more than it had ever been lit before
[3:13:47.160 --> 3:13:51.160]  i immediately bootlegged the record started selling it myself out of the trunk of my car
[3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:58.360]  touring on my own and uh haven't stopped since well i know the patriot movement also heard
[3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:01.960]  your story when that happened they also got it out to folks and then the music's just gotten
[3:14:01.960 --> 3:14:06.760]  better and better over the years so here's another case point example of where you're
[3:14:06.760 --> 3:14:11.400]  winning in the free market system of ideas and they start cheating because you're making
[3:14:11.400 --> 3:14:15.640]  touchdowns and kicking their butt same things happen to us we've had every one of our major
[3:14:15.640 --> 3:14:21.080]  videos is number one on google and number one on yahoo and they always ban it always cancel it
[3:14:21.080 --> 3:14:26.920]  always try to block it and that's because in the in the war of ideas people who really stand for
[3:14:26.920 --> 3:14:31.320]  the bill of rights the constitution we're in the right we have the people support the people are
[3:14:31.320 --> 3:14:36.440]  sick of this crap and then meanwhile we have billy ray siris with his daughter who plays the

[3:25:22.840 --> 3:25:26.600]  being censored that's what that's what we've got to get this material and get it out to people
[3:25:26.600 --> 3:25:30.840]  because it is being censored what is it about this music that's scaring the establishment
[3:25:30.840 --> 3:25:36.600]  just good old-fashioned patriotic uh you know information now we see offshore banks stealing
[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:44.920]  tens of trillions now we see obama youth brigades now we witness uh a federal court ruling there's
[3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:53.880]  no right to own guns yesterday i mean things are really going downhill fast yep and i consider this
[3:25:53.880 --> 3:25:59.640]  you know to be uh the soundtrack for the new declaration of independence that we need you
[3:25:59.640 --> 3:26:04.360]  know music is such a powerful thing and some people don't realize i say oh you know it's just
[3:26:04.360 --> 3:26:08.680]  music whatever more important than i spend my money on books or whatever it is but you know
[3:26:08.680 --> 3:26:14.680]  think about music it's how you learn to abc's is how soldiers went into battle in the old days
[3:26:14.680 --> 3:26:19.720]  music is powerful and somehow gets past the logic in the brain and goes straight to people's heart
[3:26:19.720 --> 3:26:24.360]  so this music isn't just for your listeners to have but for them to share with other people
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:30.760]  because this is a powerful weapon in the war well it certainly is and we're just glad you're out
[3:26:30.760 --> 3:26:38.280]  there are are you planning uh any more albums in the future working on a couple new things uh you
[3:26:38.280 --> 3:26:42.600]  know it's it's always a matter of juggling what i can afford to do these aren't these things are
[3:26:42.600 --> 3:26:48.120]  not inexpensive to produce because i do them the same way that they do records in Nashville
[3:26:48.120 --> 3:26:54.040]  we spend money and we get it right uh and i got a family to feed and uh a roof to keep over the
[3:26:54.040 --> 3:26:58.600]  head so balancing act and then i'm out there touring sometime i'm going to be down somewhat

[3:29:07.720 --> 3:29:11.960]  in there and one of the sales guys in the back office does some keyboard work that's what you
[3:29:11.960 --> 3:29:17.240]  hear in the obama deception and stuff and that's because we don't sell enough to have the composed
[3:29:17.240 --> 3:29:22.360]  music in the films and you listen to the soundtracks on in-game and on terror storm they blow away the

[3:33:18.280 --> 3:33:47.120]  And that is not the Star Spangled Banner, but I decided to come back in with Talk Radio.
[3:33:47.120 --> 3:33:50.960]  But yeah, not just the big, mainline, fake conservative talk show host, but all the little
[3:33:50.960 --> 3:33:57.140]  local host and patriot host, that's where I first really heard about the New World
[3:33:57.140 --> 3:33:58.140]  Order.
[3:33:58.140 --> 3:34:01.960]  I mean, I'd grown up reading Nundair College Conspiracy Gary Allen and knew about the New
[3:34:01.960 --> 3:34:09.800]  World Order somewhat, but when I really tuned in and heard Raleigh James when I was a senior
[3:34:09.800 --> 3:34:14.560]  in high school, here in Austin on Radio, when she was talking about all sorts of new
[3:34:14.560 --> 3:34:23.560]  war activity, really a great thing because Talk Radio has more time to expand ideas,
[3:34:23.560 --> 3:34:25.000]  not just little soundbites.
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:26.400]  And Steve Voss is our guest.
[3:34:26.400 --> 3:34:29.400]  Again, we have specials up on infowars.com.
[3:34:29.400 --> 3:34:34.400]  I hope people will get both of his albums, or they can buy them individually, and you
[3:34:34.400 --> 3:34:42.160]  can also do a combo and get both of them and then get my CD with the music of two of my
[3:34:42.160 --> 3:34:46.040]  films by Graham Reynolds for absolutely free.
[3:34:46.040 --> 3:34:52.080]  And we have a discount where you can get the music of my films by Graham Reynolds at a
[3:34:52.080 --> 3:34:55.520]  discount when you get it with one of Steve Voss's albums as well.
[3:34:55.520 --> 3:34:57.520]  So that's up on infowars.com.
[3:34:57.520 --> 3:35:01.440]  You can also go to stevevoss.com and I get his DVDs.
[3:35:01.440 --> 3:35:07.840]  I keep calling them DVDs because I'm a filmmaker and I'm always thinking about DVDs.
[3:35:07.840 --> 3:35:08.840]  CDs!
[3:35:08.840 --> 3:35:12.120]  Man, I tell you, sometimes I get something in my head and I just can't get it out.
[3:35:12.120 --> 3:35:13.120]  It's out of my head.
[3:35:13.120 --> 3:35:17.560]  Going back to Steve Voss, Steve, the country is really in real peril now.
[3:35:17.560 --> 3:35:21.360]  I mean, we knew a long time ago that globalism and corruption and government corruption was
[3:35:21.360 --> 3:35:22.360]  out of control.
[3:35:22.360 --> 3:35:29.080]  Now, the dollars plunging, GMs being federalized and bankrupt, Chrysler's been sold to the
[3:35:29.080 --> 3:35:34.280]  Bilderberg Group, owned Fiat, they're openly announcing world government, openly announcing
[3:35:34.280 --> 3:35:40.600]  a bank of the world we'll pay our carbon taxes to, openly announcing FEMA camps for
[3:35:40.600 --> 3:35:41.600]  our safety.
[3:35:41.600 --> 3:35:45.720]  I mean, this is even starting to freak me out and I've been expecting all this to happen.
[3:35:45.720 --> 3:35:46.720]  What about you?
[3:35:46.720 --> 3:35:50.320]  You know, I go back to the basics.
[3:35:50.320 --> 3:35:58.800]  It's like we keep drifting farther and farther away from what this country's founders envisioned
[3:35:58.800 --> 3:36:00.960]  and intended.
[3:36:00.960 --> 3:36:06.400]  And you know, it's incremental, I suppose you could say, over the last 20 years or so,
[3:36:06.400 --> 3:36:12.280]  but now the slippery slope, my God, you know, we're just zooming down it faster than, you
[3:36:12.280 --> 3:36:14.520]  know, we can even comprehend.
[3:36:14.520 --> 3:36:20.480]  And I just pray every single night that people wake up and say, wait a minute, this isn't
[3:36:20.480 --> 3:36:21.480]  right.
[3:36:21.480 --> 3:36:22.480]  This isn't America.
[3:36:22.480 --> 3:36:25.520]  We got to do something about it.
[3:36:25.520 --> 3:36:26.520]  Absolutely.
[3:36:26.520 --> 3:36:31.140]  And they love to say it's anti-military, but it's not anti-military.
[3:36:31.140 --> 3:36:38.840]  And you have 70 plus percent of the donations given by the troops to Ron Paul, not to other
[3:36:38.840 --> 3:36:41.120]  candidates.
[3:36:41.120 --> 3:36:45.880]  And you have Ron Paul speaking out against all these urban warfare drills, Northcom announcing
[3:36:45.880 --> 3:36:47.800]  they're going to police the American people.
[3:36:47.800 --> 3:36:51.320]  You know, the troops don't want to do this.
[3:36:51.320 --> 3:36:53.600]  And I know the people don't want this.
[3:36:53.600 --> 3:36:59.080]  Where do you see this country going if we don't energize a mass awakening and a realization
[3:36:59.080 --> 3:37:01.320]  that we're going down the tubes towards tyranny?
[3:37:01.320 --> 3:37:05.360]  Hell in a hand basket.
[3:37:05.360 --> 3:37:08.120]  I mean, it's as simple as that.
[3:37:08.120 --> 3:37:12.720]  You know, they, now they're floating this idea of adding a value added tax to pay for
[3:37:12.720 --> 3:37:19.000]  healthcare and, you know, federal control of virtually everything you can imagine.
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:23.960]  I mean, I think the folks in Texas have the right idea and I'm going to give serious thought
[3:37:23.960 --> 3:37:27.640]  to moving down there, not just coming down there to sing because they're talking about,
[3:37:27.640 --> 3:37:31.120]  you know what, maybe we're going to back out of this thing being part of the United States
[3:37:31.120 --> 3:37:32.960]  of America.
[3:37:32.960 --> 3:37:35.240]  We are in deep, deep trouble, folks.
[3:37:35.240 --> 3:37:37.840]  I mean, I'm not chicken little thing in the sky is falling.
[3:37:37.840 --> 3:37:40.440]  All you got to do is read even the mainstream press.
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:44.240]  And if you don't realize we're in deep trouble, then you need to get your eyes checked.
[3:37:44.240 --> 3:37:46.280]  Well, you're right.
[3:37:46.280 --> 3:37:51.560]  You know, what's happening is we need the states to declare sovereignty and reconstitute the
[3:37:51.560 --> 3:37:53.520]  federal government.
[3:37:53.520 --> 3:37:55.400]  And we have to succeed.
[3:37:55.400 --> 3:38:02.360]  And I, the globalists are in control, as you know, Steve, of the Congress and both major
[3:38:02.360 --> 3:38:04.760]  political parties.
[3:38:04.760 --> 3:38:06.720]  And people think, oh, I want free healthcare.
[3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:08.440]  That won't be free healthcare.
[3:38:08.440 --> 3:38:13.440]  That will be just like they take a $1 from the states and send 30 cents back on average,
[3:38:13.440 --> 3:38:16.480]  33 cents back on average with strings attached.
[3:38:16.480 --> 3:38:20.880]  They are coming in with all these strings attached to control our lives.
[3:38:20.880 --> 3:38:22.120]  This is going to be eugenics.
[3:38:22.120 --> 3:38:24.160]  This is going to be government control.
[3:38:24.160 --> 3:38:27.240]  This is going to be paid for government abortions.
[3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:31.320]  And I've got an article here with a judge saying, I'll give you probation if you get
[3:38:31.320 --> 3:38:32.320]  sterilized.
[3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:36.440]  This is government eugenics health care that I cover in my film Endgame.
[3:38:36.440 --> 3:38:39.800]  You don't want the government in control of something like this.
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:42.520]  They can use it as a tool to control people.
[3:38:42.520 --> 3:38:44.240]  They already are.
[3:38:44.240 --> 3:38:50.360]  Yeah, it's, it's absolutely frightening, you know, in my simplistic view, I think we
[3:38:50.360 --> 3:38:56.120]  need to go back to the old, old days of, you know, citizen lawmakers that go and, you know,
[3:38:56.120 --> 3:39:01.000]  serve a term for, for two years or six years, then they go home and go back to their farm.
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:04.760]  You know, we got to get back to basics and common sense here.
[3:39:04.760 --> 3:39:10.040]  The only piece I find in all of this, the only thing that gives me comfort is we have
[3:39:10.040 --> 3:39:15.640]  a farm out in the hinterlands of Virginia that is a long time before anybody can find
[3:39:15.640 --> 3:39:17.800]  it, let alone try and take control of it.
[3:39:17.800 --> 3:39:22.840]  And you know, that's our safety valve, you know, because I'm not real optimistic at this
[3:39:22.840 --> 3:39:27.120]  point that even if everybody wakes up tomorrow, that we're going to be able to fight the forces
[3:39:27.120 --> 3:39:28.120]  that are in charge.
[3:39:28.120 --> 3:39:29.400]  Well, I agree with you.
[3:39:29.400 --> 3:39:30.880]  Here's the problem.
[3:39:30.880 --> 3:39:34.600]  Earlier before you were on, I covered the cybersecurity grid.
[3:39:34.600 --> 3:39:38.360]  They admit their thumb print and biometrically the kids in school without even asking the
[3:39:38.360 --> 3:39:43.560]  parents, they got face scanning cameras, license plate reading cameras, North American Union
[3:39:43.560 --> 3:39:50.760]  hemispheric travel passes, no fly list for gun owners, no guns for people on no fly list.
[3:39:50.760 --> 3:39:55.640]  They've got the National Animal Identification System where they bully you into signing your
[3:39:55.640 --> 3:39:58.840]  rights away, $1,000 a day fines.
[3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:04.160]  If you don't report everything to the government, $20 tags for $5 chickens, but then Tyson's
[3:40:04.160 --> 3:40:09.480]  exempt from that, bankrupting everything, bureaucrats arresting Amish for selling cheese
[3:40:09.480 --> 3:40:14.360]  and milk to other Amish, arresting Amish for not getting license plates now, arresting
[3:40:14.360 --> 3:40:18.400]  people selling eggs and watermelons without a permit on the side of the highway.
[3:40:18.400 --> 3:40:20.520]  I mean, Steve, I'm sure you know about this.
[3:40:20.520 --> 3:40:25.960]  They are coming after the farms and ranches and they're doing it in Europe too and Australia
[3:40:25.960 --> 3:40:30.800]  and the feds are using surveillance satellites with the new environmental laws in these cities
[3:40:30.800 --> 3:40:36.600]  and towns where you can't build on your own property to go, oh, you built a shed and a
[3:40:36.600 --> 3:40:42.560]  SWAT team comes and arrests you, I mean, they are coming after your farm in Virginia.
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:44.600]  They'll get there sooner or later.
[3:40:44.600 --> 3:40:47.880]  You know, the thing that scares me more than anything, I'm sure you saw the story a couple
[3:40:47.880 --> 3:40:53.080]  of days ago on WorldNet Daily about the folks that were hosting a Bible study out here in
[3:40:53.080 --> 3:40:54.080]  San Diego.
[3:40:54.080 --> 3:40:55.080]  That happened in Fred.
[3:40:55.080 --> 3:41:00.200]  Yeah, and the government comes out and says, well, you need a permit to do this.
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:01.920]  You need a permit to gather.
[3:41:01.920 --> 3:41:03.560]  You can't have 10 people in your house.
[3:41:03.560 --> 3:41:07.640]  That first time I saw that was about 10 years ago in Denver and then now they're saying
[3:41:07.640 --> 3:41:10.760]  not just Christians, rabbis can't have meetings at their houses.
[3:41:10.760 --> 3:41:13.680]  I mean, this is a right of assembly first amendment.
[3:41:13.680 --> 3:41:15.560]  Yeah, tell folks about that.
[3:41:15.560 --> 3:41:21.120]  Oh, God, you know, it was folks with a Bible study right here in San Diego and somebody
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:24.960]  from zoning shows up the front door and says, well, are you having these gatherings?
[3:41:24.960 --> 3:41:25.960]  Are you saying amen?
[3:41:25.960 --> 3:41:27.960]  Are you reading from the Bible and all that stuff?
[3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:31.440]  And they were going to tell them they had to get a conditional use permit or a major
[3:41:31.440 --> 3:41:35.600]  use permit, something like that was going to cost tens of thousands of dollars.
[3:41:35.600 --> 3:41:39.280]  Well the defecation hit the rotary oscillator on that one because people found out thanks
[3:41:39.280 --> 3:41:44.440]  to WorldNet Daily and then it made it into the local papers here and the county is back
[3:41:44.440 --> 3:41:45.440]  down.
[3:41:45.440 --> 3:41:48.440]  But I think it's just the tip of the iceberg.
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:51.840]  The other thing that concerns me greatly is the fact that you look at the numbers of how
[3:41:51.840 --> 3:41:56.000]  the Muslim population of the United States is growing.
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:01.400]  And now we've got President Barack Hussein Obama saying, well, you know, we really are
[3:42:01.400 --> 3:42:03.840]  one of the largest Muslim countries in the world.
[3:42:03.840 --> 3:42:07.840]  I mean, my God, have we lost our bearings so badly?
[3:42:07.840 --> 3:42:10.080]  I guess for now the answer is yes.
[3:42:10.080 --> 3:42:13.240]  Well, by the way, Steve, I never even got to this.
[3:42:13.240 --> 3:42:20.680]  Kurt Nemo did a story this morning with just the headline from the ABC News article where
[3:42:20.680 --> 3:42:27.040]  Obama begins to announce his Muslim roots, not even saying it was good or bad.
[3:42:27.040 --> 3:42:31.440]  We just stated that he denied all these roots that were public and said it was a conspiracy
[3:42:31.440 --> 3:42:34.240]  theory whether it's good, bad or indifferent.
[3:42:34.240 --> 3:42:37.720]  And then now he's using it saying, yeah, I'm basically a Muslim.
[3:42:37.720 --> 3:42:39.040]  We know he went to Muslim schools.
[3:42:39.040 --> 3:42:42.680]  His dad was a Muslim with Odinga, his cousin.
[3:42:42.680 --> 3:42:49.320]  They told him in Senate letterhead, go ahead and contest the election and engage in violence.
[3:42:49.320 --> 3:42:54.460]  I mean, Obama really is a terrorist in every sense of the word and I don't think he's really
[3:42:54.460 --> 3:42:57.560]  quote a Muslim, I think he uses that, he's a chameleon.
[3:42:57.560 --> 3:43:00.280]  He really works for offshore banks to take over this country.
[3:43:00.280 --> 3:43:06.680]  But all these commenters in the article were telling me that I was making this up when
[3:43:06.680 --> 3:43:10.160]  all I was doing was, because I called Kurt this morning and asked him to do a story
[3:43:10.160 --> 3:43:11.160]  and he did.
[3:43:11.160 --> 3:43:16.000]  When all we were doing was, I'm looking for the article, was pointing out what he said
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:17.000]  in speeches.
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:21.840]  It's like he introduces all this gun control legislation, the most draconian ever.
[3:43:21.840 --> 3:43:27.120]  We list the gun bills and people send me threatening emails saying you're a liar, there's no gun
[3:43:27.120 --> 3:43:28.120]  bills.
[3:43:28.120 --> 3:43:30.720]  Can you comment on that?
[3:43:30.720 --> 3:43:35.920]  Only that some people are so damn blind because they don't want to see, you know.
[3:43:35.920 --> 3:43:42.280]  The facts are the facts and you know, regardless of what we think about Barack Hussein Obama,
[3:43:42.280 --> 3:43:47.040]  the fact is that he's taken this country towards socialism or Marxism, whatever color
[3:43:47.040 --> 3:43:52.560]  you want to call it, and it's so far from what the founders intended for this country,
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:55.320]  it ought to scare us all to death.
[3:43:55.320 --> 3:43:59.080]  And notice the deeper they get us down this road, Steve Voss, it only gets worse.
[3:43:59.080 --> 3:44:02.280]  Their solutions always only make it worse.
[3:44:02.280 --> 3:44:06.880]  Yeah, you know, but they're going to give us all health care and they're going to manage
[3:44:06.880 --> 3:44:07.880]  it.
[3:44:07.880 --> 3:44:10.920]  I've never seen a single thing the government has managed that they've done right.
[3:44:10.920 --> 3:44:14.200]  So that's another thing that should have you scared not only for yourself, but for
[3:44:14.200 --> 3:44:18.440]  your family and kids, and you know, come in full circle here.
[3:44:18.440 --> 3:44:23.640]  I mean, that's why people like you, Alex Jones, and people like me, Steve Voss, not to inflate
[3:44:23.640 --> 3:44:29.480]  our importance, but you know, people need to rally around the sources of real information,
[3:44:29.480 --> 3:44:32.440]  the people that are encouraging freedom and independence and liberty.
[3:44:32.440 --> 3:44:38.680]  You know, you've got to support these people because they're right.
[3:44:38.680 --> 3:44:39.680]  Absolutely.
[3:44:39.680 --> 3:44:41.440]  Look at this, folks.
[3:44:41.440 --> 3:44:46.600]  The emergence of Obama's Muslim roots, now they denied all this, said it was a lie, attacked
[3:44:46.600 --> 3:44:49.200]  anybody that covered it.
[3:44:49.200 --> 3:44:52.520]  And then he goes and gives speeches saying, I have a Muslim upbringing.
[3:44:52.520 --> 3:44:53.640]  I have Muslim roots.
[3:44:53.640 --> 3:44:57.360]  I'm your friend when he's in Muslim countries.
[3:44:57.360 --> 3:45:01.920]  And then we write a story about it called the emergence of Obama's Muslim roots info
[3:45:01.920 --> 3:45:09.440]  wars.com with links to ABC news, world net daily, times of London online.
[3:45:09.440 --> 3:45:13.880]  And a bunch of an Obama's own organizing for America.
[3:45:13.880 --> 3:45:19.520]  We link directly to Obama's own statements and they they comment in our article that
[3:45:19.520 --> 3:45:26.800]  we're making this up if it weren't so sad, it'd be hysterical.
[3:45:26.800 --> 3:45:28.000]  It'd be a great comedy.
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:29.640]  You know, you make a film about that.
[3:45:29.640 --> 3:45:30.640]  I'll tell you what.
[3:45:30.640 --> 3:45:32.240]  Well, it goes further here.
[3:45:32.240 --> 3:45:38.320]  You know, you know, he writes about how it is a Wahhabi variety.
[3:45:38.320 --> 3:45:41.920]  It's the majority Muslim Sunni out of Saudi Arabia.
[3:45:41.920 --> 3:45:47.040]  And you know, he walks up and fully bowels to the Saudi King and then says, well, I was
[3:45:47.040 --> 3:45:48.040]  too tall.
[3:45:48.040 --> 3:45:49.040]  Well, the Saudi King's almost as tall as him.
[3:45:49.040 --> 3:45:52.120]  He says, well, I was picking something up off the floor and then later they admit, okay,
[3:45:52.120 --> 3:45:53.200]  he was bowing.
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:45:59.360]  We haven't had a president ever in our history bow a complete bow.
[3:45:59.360 --> 3:46:01.760]  They might have shaken a woman's hand or something and done like that.
[3:46:01.760 --> 3:46:05.960]  You know, disrespectful, completely bow.
[3:46:05.960 --> 3:46:11.640]  And you know, the point is, is that this guy is just a complete political whore.
[3:46:11.640 --> 3:46:14.000]  He bows to everybody.
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:15.160]  He does that.
[3:46:15.160 --> 3:46:19.480]  And you know, now he's out continuing his apology tour.
[3:46:19.480 --> 3:46:20.480]  Everything we've ever done.
[3:46:20.480 --> 3:46:21.560]  Well, we're sorry that we did this.
[3:46:21.560 --> 3:46:22.560]  We should do that.
[3:46:22.560 --> 3:46:24.600]  When does anybody ever apologize to us?
[3:46:24.600 --> 3:46:30.680]  And frankly, even if they did, we should be the last country in the world apologizing.
[3:46:30.680 --> 3:46:36.440]  You know, the greatest example of freedom and the power of the people, we've got nothing
[3:46:36.440 --> 3:46:37.920]  to apologize for.
[3:46:37.920 --> 3:46:43.440]  The only thing we've got to apologize for in my mind, Steve Voss, is for letting internationalists
[3:46:43.440 --> 3:46:47.600]  use this country's money and wealth to fund their IMF and World Bank takeovers of the
[3:46:47.600 --> 3:46:48.600]  planet.
[3:46:48.600 --> 3:46:52.840]  But we've been used, you know, I want a mosquito comes and sucks blood out of you to fly off
[3:46:52.840 --> 3:46:58.360]  to, you know, be able to produce its protein eggs, you know, female mosquitoes are the
[3:46:58.360 --> 3:47:00.400]  ones that drink blood.
[3:47:00.400 --> 3:47:05.960]  It's not the host fault that it gave some blood to the mosquito that the mosquitoes
[3:47:05.960 --> 3:47:06.960]  out there biting people.
[3:47:06.960 --> 3:47:10.520]  We need to blame the parasites of the new world order, not the host.
[3:47:10.520 --> 3:47:14.920]  But at the same time, I would blame a lot of the American people for buying into big
[3:47:14.920 --> 3:47:18.480]  government and going along with this, because there are a lot of people that go along with
[3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:19.480]  this, Steve.
[3:47:19.480 --> 3:47:24.520]  No doubt about it because, you know, we're, we're in the age of the gimme government.
[3:47:24.520 --> 3:47:27.640]  And you know, if you promise enough to enough people, then they're going to support you.
[3:47:27.640 --> 3:47:33.120]  And, you know, kind of lay rose petals in the path for you to travel down.
[3:47:33.120 --> 3:47:35.960]  We've been too trusting and we've been too greedy.
[3:47:35.960 --> 3:47:39.480]  And we need to get back to the hard scrabble life where we're, you know, blood, sweat and
[3:47:39.480 --> 3:47:45.360]  tears and work for what we need and not look for a handout.
[3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:46.360]  Yeah.
[3:47:46.360 --> 3:47:47.360]  Well, there is no free lunch.
[3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:50.160]  Anything that's supposedly free comes with strings attached.
[3:47:50.160 --> 3:47:53.480]  Let's go ahead and talk to Hondo in California, you're on the air with Steve Voss.
[3:47:53.480 --> 3:47:54.480]  Go ahead.
[3:47:54.480 --> 3:47:55.480]  Hi there.
[3:47:55.480 --> 3:47:57.200]  I'm so glad to hear Steve again.
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:01.640]  I used to hear him on a show called, I think it was called Radio Free America.
[3:48:01.640 --> 3:48:07.040]  It was with Chuck Harder about 14 years ago, and he used to use Steve Voss's music for
[3:48:07.040 --> 3:48:08.040]  his bumper music.
[3:48:08.040 --> 3:48:09.480]  No, I remember Chuck Harder.
[3:48:09.480 --> 3:48:10.480]  I remember Chuck Harder.
[3:48:10.480 --> 3:48:11.480]  When did that guy?
[3:48:11.480 --> 3:48:12.480]  Yeah.
[3:48:12.480 --> 3:48:13.480]  I remember.
[3:48:13.480 --> 3:48:14.480]  Yeah, Chuck.
[3:48:14.480 --> 3:48:17.920]  Chuck was one of the guys that really launched the music in the beginning.
[3:48:17.920 --> 3:48:22.480]  He heard the story about RCA and had me on numerous times.
[3:48:22.480 --> 3:48:23.480]  I heard you all the time.
[3:48:23.480 --> 3:48:28.240]  And I used to listen to that music about six years ago, I started searching for it on the
[3:48:28.240 --> 3:48:29.240]  internet.
[3:48:29.240 --> 3:48:31.000]  But I couldn't remember exactly what the name was.
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:34.320]  I tried a bunch of different versions, and I think I called you Steve something else.
[3:48:34.320 --> 3:48:39.080]  Then I said, I think it was D-O-U-S or B-B-O-X.
[3:48:39.080 --> 3:48:40.080]  I couldn't remember.
[3:48:40.080 --> 3:48:42.120]  Anyway, let me tell you how you spell it, folks.
[3:48:42.120 --> 3:48:43.120]  It's V-A-U-S.
[3:48:43.120 --> 3:48:51.960]  Steve, V-A-U-S, Voss, you can get his two latest CDs, one of his new music, one of his greatest
[3:48:51.960 --> 3:48:58.200]  hits available at infowars.com, can't forget infowars.com, or Steve, Voss.com.
[3:48:58.200 --> 3:48:59.200]  Anything else?
[3:48:59.200 --> 3:49:03.200]  I just wondered, whatever happened to Chuck Harder, is that story ever going to be told?
[3:49:03.200 --> 3:49:10.120]  Chuck Harder bought a little old hotel that he broadcast out of, then he had health problems.
[3:49:10.120 --> 3:49:14.760]  I talked to him a few times and then lost touch.
[3:49:14.760 --> 3:49:18.680]  Does anybody know if he's okay or how he's doing in Florida?
[3:49:18.680 --> 3:49:24.200]  I've talked to him or emailed him maybe six or eight weeks ago, and his health problems
[3:49:24.200 --> 3:49:28.680]  have continued, and he's had some personal difficulties, but he's still got the fire
[3:49:28.680 --> 3:49:29.680]  in his belly.
[3:49:29.680 --> 3:49:30.680]  Good.
[3:49:30.680 --> 3:49:35.440]  So, Chuck Harder, I need to get, that's an idea.
[3:49:35.440 --> 3:49:42.400]  In fact, Steve, can you shoot over to Rob D, just the letter D, Rob D, at infowars.com.
[3:49:42.400 --> 3:49:47.640]  The Chuck Harder email, I want to see if I can twist Chuck's arm to get him on there
[3:49:47.640 --> 3:49:53.120]  here and maybe get him some support, because he's somebody early on that was on hundreds
[3:49:53.120 --> 3:49:59.200]  of radio stations that the media ignored, that was instrumental in the resistance movement
[3:49:59.200 --> 3:50:00.960]  to this tyranny we've got today.
[3:50:00.960 --> 3:50:03.040]  We owe so much to Chuck Harder.
[3:50:03.040 --> 3:50:05.320]  Yeah, and I'll send that to Rob.
[3:50:05.320 --> 3:50:06.320]  Okay, thank you.
[3:50:06.320 --> 3:50:10.120]  Just a few minutes ago, send Rob the link to that YouTube video I was talking about.
[3:50:10.120 --> 3:50:11.120]  Good.
[3:50:11.120 --> 3:50:12.120]  Yes, we did find that.
[3:50:12.120 --> 3:50:15.440]  We did find that, and folks who just go to SteveVoss.com and see that, during the break
[3:50:15.440 --> 3:50:21.280]  we'll pop it up on screen for folks to see the URL and the address in the YouTube video
[3:50:21.280 --> 3:50:22.280]  itself.
[3:50:22.280 --> 3:50:23.840]  Yeah, here it is.
[3:50:23.840 --> 3:50:32.800]  Rabbi Bernstein expands lawsuit because Township won't let them have meetings in their house.
[3:50:32.800 --> 3:50:36.920]  And I'm just making the point, it's Christians, it's Muslims, it's Jews, it's, you don't have
[3:50:36.920 --> 3:50:43.640]  free speech in America, and these cities want you to be 501C3, too, wave all your rights,
[3:50:43.640 --> 3:50:49.040]  be part of the clergy response teams, be government approved, I mean it just goes on and on the
[3:50:49.040 --> 3:50:50.800]  takeover of our society.
[3:50:50.800 --> 3:50:56.200]  SteveVoss is our guest, I'm Alex Jones, our websites are prisonplanet.tv, jonesreport.com,
[3:50:56.200 --> 3:50:57.200]  infowars.net.
[3:50:57.200 --> 3:51:01.520]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[3:51:01.520 --> 3:51:05.880]  Ah, springtime, now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs
[3:51:05.880 --> 3:51:08.680]  away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[3:51:08.680 --> 3:51:13.320]  The answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[3:51:13.320 --> 3:51:17.840]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP
[3:51:17.840 --> 3:51:19.200]  to kill parasites.
[3:51:19.200 --> 3:51:23.960]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant
[3:51:23.960 --> 3:51:27.760]  to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[3:51:27.760 --> 3:51:30.800]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[3:51:30.800 --> 3:51:35.200]  Our natural insecticides work in the home on plants and in your garden, killing pests
[3:51:35.200 --> 3:51:39.800]  mechanically not with poisons, so pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm
[3:51:39.800 --> 3:51:41.680]  your children or pets.
[3:51:41.680 --> 3:51:47.280]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas, roaches, crickets and more,
[3:51:47.280 --> 3:51:51.560]  and save enough to use on your pets, ridding them of fleas and other pests.

[3:52:02.240 --> 3:52:07.600]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:07.600 --> 3:52:14.280]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:52:14.280 --> 3:52:15.600]  just as well funded.
[3:52:15.600 --> 3:52:20.720]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:20.720 --> 3:52:22.240]  of the American people.
[3:52:22.240 --> 3:52:26.600]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:26.600 --> 3:52:31.720]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:31.720 --> 3:52:38.240]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.240 --> 3:52:41.800]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.800 --> 3:52:48.680]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:52:48.680 --> 3:52:54.280]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super-high
[3:52:54.280 --> 3:52:56.880]  quality at presentplanet.tv.
[3:52:56.880 --> 3:53:02.080]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:53:02.080 --> 3:53:05.560]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[3:53:05.560 --> 3:53:09.440]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[3:53:09.440 --> 3:53:11.040]  than when drinking the water?
[3:53:11.040 --> 3:53:14.880]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed
[3:53:14.880 --> 3:53:15.880]  into the skin.
[3:53:15.880 --> 3:53:20.520]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to
[3:53:20.520 --> 3:53:25.920]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[3:53:25.920 --> 3:53:27.080]  algae, and fungus.
[3:53:27.080 --> 3:53:31.920]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever
[3:53:31.920 --> 3:53:32.920]  comes first.
[3:53:32.920 --> 3:53:37.080]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:53:37.080 --> 3:53:39.120]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[3:53:39.120 --> 3:53:40.120]  What about you?

[3:55:48.240 --> 3:55:51.200]  great music as well discounted out of the gates.
[3:55:51.200 --> 3:55:55.440]  Let's take two final calls for Steve Voss, Jim in Ohio, Jim you're on the air.
[3:55:55.440 --> 3:55:56.440]  Hello?
[3:55:56.440 --> 3:55:57.960]  Yes Jim, go ahead.
[3:55:57.960 --> 3:56:01.400]  Hey, thanks for a great job you did on that eugenics today, that was super, but the question
[3:56:01.400 --> 3:56:05.040]  I have for you is, why do you think the unions have stood up across the country about the
[3:56:05.040 --> 3:56:08.600]  fact that they shipped all the jobs out and called a big boycott for a whole day across
[3:56:08.600 --> 3:56:10.320]  the country?
[3:56:10.320 --> 3:56:11.820]  Say that again?
[3:56:11.820 --> 3:56:16.360]  The unions across the country, they shipped all the jobs out overseas to get rid of everything.
[3:56:16.360 --> 3:56:20.440]  So I have the unions took a day and just, you know, so we're going to take a whole day
[3:56:20.440 --> 3:56:23.280]  and boycott the whole nation, drive, do nothing.
[3:56:23.280 --> 3:56:28.000]  The unions have been bought off by the globalists, that's why they support GM being cut up in
[3:56:28.000 --> 3:56:33.840]  pieces and sold to China, Russia, and Brazil, publicly, it's gone, and we're going to pay
[3:56:33.840 --> 3:56:38.480]  the money to have it shipped out under the stimulus package rules and World Trade Organization
[3:56:38.480 --> 3:56:39.480]  rules.
[3:56:39.480 --> 3:56:44.920]  We, part of all of our industry that has any federal money in it, has to be internationalized.
[3:56:44.920 --> 3:56:47.080]  It can't be for the nation state.
[3:56:47.080 --> 3:56:51.520]  Globalism is designed to destroy sovereign nations and transfer power to third world
[3:56:51.520 --> 3:56:53.800]  countries and control by the globalist.
[3:56:53.800 --> 3:56:55.640]  I appreciate your call Jim.
[3:56:55.640 --> 3:57:00.000]  Comments on that Steve Voss, I mean, they are just wrecking everything by design right
[3:57:00.000 --> 3:57:01.000]  now.
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  They are.
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:06.880]  And again, I'm a black and white.
[3:57:06.880 --> 3:57:08.880]  Your phone's cutting out again.
[3:57:08.880 --> 3:57:09.880]  Start over.
[3:57:09.880 --> 3:57:14.200]  I said, I'm, I'm a black and white guy and try and reduce things to simple terms.
[3:57:14.200 --> 3:57:17.640]  It's about freedom, liberty, independence in this country.
[3:57:17.640 --> 3:57:22.040]  If we don't get back to constitutional values, we're screwed.
[3:57:22.040 --> 3:57:26.440]  And every time we let bailouts happen, it goes to offshore banks or pays to move the
[3:57:26.440 --> 3:57:28.080]  companies offshore.
[3:57:28.080 --> 3:57:30.640]  So they said, oh, you got to save GM and Chrysler.
[3:57:30.640 --> 3:57:31.640]  It isn't saving them.
[3:57:31.640 --> 3:57:33.720]  It's paying the globalists to take it.
[3:57:33.720 --> 3:57:35.280]  Just totally criminal.
[3:57:35.280 --> 3:57:37.000]  Let's talk to Ivan in Texas.
[3:57:37.000 --> 3:57:38.000]  Last caller.
[3:57:38.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  You're on the air with Steve Voss.
[3:57:39.000 --> 3:57:40.000]  Go ahead.
[3:57:40.000 --> 3:57:41.000]  Hey, how are you doing?
[3:57:41.000 --> 3:57:42.000]  Alex.
[3:57:42.000 --> 3:57:43.000]  Good morning.
[3:57:43.000 --> 3:57:44.000]  I saw the Obama deception.
[3:57:44.000 --> 3:57:45.000]  It's a pretty good movie.
[3:57:45.000 --> 3:57:49.120]  And I think it's waking a lot of people up, but the only thing that I had to say was,
[3:57:49.120 --> 3:57:52.880]  I think a lot of people really understand like the full, the full picture because the
[3:57:52.880 --> 3:57:56.160]  other day somebody asked me, Hey, do you think Obama's a communist?
[3:57:56.160 --> 3:58:01.680]  And I'm like, Hey, that's not the point because communism, globalism and fascism all come from
[3:58:01.680 --> 3:58:02.680]  Hegelian philosophy.
[3:58:02.680 --> 3:58:07.200]  And I want to know if your readers, if your listeners know about Hegelian philosophy.
[3:58:07.200 --> 3:58:08.200]  Yes.
[3:58:08.200 --> 3:58:09.320]  We know about the Hegelian dialectic.
[3:58:09.320 --> 3:58:10.400]  I'm out of time.
[3:58:10.400 --> 3:58:11.400]  That's what Steve's saying.
[3:58:11.400 --> 3:58:16.800]  Boil it down to, you know, black and white, liberty versus tyranny and all big forms of
[3:58:16.800 --> 3:58:21.400]  government, communism, socialism, fascism, black uniforms, surveillance cameras, slave
[3:58:21.400 --> 3:58:26.760]  camps, liberty, swimming pools, happy kids, lots of money and liberty and freedom.
[3:58:26.760 --> 3:58:28.400]  You just got to keep it.
[3:58:28.400 --> 3:58:30.920]  Steve Voss, it's been great having you on, my friend.
[3:58:30.920 --> 3:58:32.960]  Let's do it again.
[3:58:32.960 --> 3:58:33.960]  Thanks.
[3:58:33.960 --> 3:58:34.960]  You bet.
[3:58:34.960 --> 3:58:35.960]  God bless you, sir.
[3:58:35.960 --> 3:58:36.960]  We'll talk to you very, very soon.
[3:58:36.960 --> 3:58:37.960]  And give me that email and check harder.
[3:58:37.960 --> 3:58:40.840]  Retransmission starts now with key info at infowars.com.
[3:58:40.840 --> 3:58:41.840]  Spread the word.
[3:58:41.840 --> 3:58:44.840]  You are listening to GCN.
[3:58:44.840 --> 3:58:51.640]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:51.640 --> 3:58:56.080]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:58:56.080 --> 3:58:57.080]  this summer.
[3:58:57.080 --> 3:59:00.760]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:59:00.760 --> 3:59:05.520]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:59:05.520 --> 3:59:06.760]  allows you to have.
[3:59:06.760 --> 3:59:07.760]  It's true.
[3:59:07.760 --> 3:59:11.920]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:59:11.920 --> 3:59:15.960]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:59:15.960 --> 3:59:18.440]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:59:18.440 --> 3:59:22.000]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[3:59:22.000 --> 3:59:25.640]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[3:59:25.640 --> 3:59:30.480]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:59:30.480 --> 3:59:34.880]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solution from Science, a long time
[3:59:34.880 --> 3:59:36.040]  sponsor of ours.
