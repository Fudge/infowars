[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:26.520]  all right folks we are live I am Jason Burma sitting in for Alex Jones this
[00:26.520 --> 00:32.120]  afternoon and to kick it off we have to talk about these July 4th parades now
[00:32.120 --> 00:38.440]  there were several where 9-11 true was representing however one gentleman with
[00:38.440 --> 00:44.100]  an info wars banner on his car I got it ripped off by the media was hassled
[00:44.100 --> 00:48.560]  beyond belief we're gonna play the NBC affiliate clip in just a moment and this
[00:48.560 --> 00:53.560]  is a lot like when they tried to pin they said he hit people with his car and
[00:53.560 --> 00:58.120]  then he was causing a raucous give me a break the guy was in a parade trying to
[00:58.120 --> 01:01.840]  expose the truth to the masses trying to let people know about info wars calm
[01:01.840 --> 01:05.320]  they said he was screaming out of synodies when in actuality he was playing
[01:05.320 --> 01:10.160]  an Alex Jones rant from about two years ago I believe it was a January 2007
[01:10.160 --> 01:15.080]  we're gonna play that as well I think it has freedom in the title the feeling of
[01:15.080 --> 01:18.760]  freedom that's what it's about folks it's about freedom it's about fighting
[01:18.760 --> 01:22.400]  tyranny it's about exposing the true terrorists and that's what this
[01:22.400 --> 01:26.600]  gentleman was doing and of course he's going to be demonized in the media about
[01:26.600 --> 01:30.680]  it it's just like they said oh 9-11 truthers like to attack half retarded
[01:30.680 --> 01:35.480]  girls in wheelchairs and it goes to trial and there's a small retraction and
[01:35.480 --> 01:40.000]  nobody pulls back nobody says hey it looks like he was set up I mean can you
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.880]  imagine being set up for assaulting a young girl with cerebral palsy in a
[01:45.880 --> 01:50.880]  wheelchair and then she wheels up to the podium in a Girl Scout outfit with a
[01:50.880 --> 01:55.680]  puppy you can't make this insanity up so let's just go to the clip right now we
[01:55.680 --> 01:58.920]  got a ton of news for you we're gonna be talking about the Senate blocking the
[01:58.920 --> 02:01.600]  audit the Fed bill we're going to be talking about the new work mayor that
[02:01.600 --> 02:06.040]  is encouraging snitches to turn in gun owners for a thousand dollars a pop all
[02:06.040 --> 02:09.600]  that stuff coming up but let's go to the clip right now
[02:09.600 --> 02:13.400]  I did the end of blue when I saw 9-11 equals inside jobs because I found it so
[02:13.400 --> 02:19.240]  offensive and Independence Day tradition in Columbus ends with some violence and
[02:19.240 --> 02:24.000]  a protester in jail good evening I'm John Softlet and I'm Lee Mills on the day
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.760]  we celebrated the founding of our nation one man found himself behind bars and
[02:28.760 --> 02:34.040]  busy 15s Chris Papps reports and here comes another unit from the Ryle Fire
[02:34.040 --> 02:38.120]  Department every year the Columbus 4th of July parade attracts about 10,000
[02:38.120 --> 02:45.360]  people all right and one of those people this year is now the talk of the town
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.840]  the first 90 minutes of the parade was just like any other until a protester
[02:49.840 --> 02:53.580]  who designed his own float somehow entered the procession screaming at the
[02:53.580 --> 02:56.240]  crowd through speakers on the roof
[03:10.080 --> 03:14.280]  the car managed to make it through the entire parade following this road to the
[03:14.280 --> 03:18.200]  center of town at the end of the route the crowd began to boo the man stopped
[03:18.200 --> 03:22.320]  the car and that's when it got ugly the man who police say is 31 year old Mark
[03:22.320 --> 03:26.600]  Spindler of Beaver Dam further taunted the onlookers until a few men ran out
[03:26.600 --> 03:31.200]  from the crowd and began tearing the signs off his car one said 9-11 equals
[03:31.200 --> 03:36.720]  inside job another read America you're all slaves he held a camera the entire
[03:36.720 --> 03:40.800]  time recording at all I believe everyone is right freedom of speech but I do not
[03:40.800 --> 03:45.120]  believe that you have the freedom to come to a peaceful gathering and try to
[03:45.120 --> 03:50.960]  start something very ugly which I believe was his intentions in Columbus
[03:50.960 --> 03:57.360]  Chris Papst NBC 15 news to start something very ugly like people thinking
[03:57.360 --> 04:02.040]  for themselves like people being exposed to the truth it's unfortunate that the
[04:02.040 --> 04:05.160]  truth isn't always pretty ma'am but he wasn't there to start something he was
[04:05.160 --> 04:09.520]  there to open up minds and again they you know they're saying all these bad
[04:09.520 --> 04:13.360]  things about him I'm glad he had a camera because that is the new weapon in
[04:13.360 --> 04:17.000]  the info war we need to get that video footage as this guy sits and rots in
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.600]  jail I wouldn't be surprised if the authorities took that video and erased
[04:22.600 --> 04:28.880]  it it happens more often than not more often than not folks and and again you
[04:28.880 --> 04:33.640]  know this happened in Tacoma Park Maryland 4th of July parade they've got

[08:27.520 --> 08:30.640]  tell that the gentleman that they were accusing of yelling through a bullhorn
[08:30.640 --> 08:35.480]  was actually a tape of Alex Jones from a couple years ago on the I can feel the
[08:35.480 --> 08:39.120]  freedom rant and they've got to pull it back up after that power outage that
[08:39.120 --> 08:43.880]  literally just happened 10 seconds ago I want to talk about some of the other

[09:03.640 --> 09:06.920]  all right let's hit the clip
[09:06.920 --> 09:26.800]  I literally
[09:26.800 --> 09:39.440]  when passion and desire I can literally taste it as my teeth clench and lock
[09:39.440 --> 09:48.040]  together I can feel my ancestors victories against tyranny and the great
[09:48.040 --> 09:57.240]  battles they fought the struggles of the species everything it is to the human I
[09:57.240 --> 10:07.600]  can feel it coursing through my very bones my heart my guts the sinews in my
[10:07.600 --> 10:18.840]  forearms my fists that are cracked and arthritic burn with power all of you
[10:18.840 --> 10:27.400]  have that same human spark your destiny is to build your destiny is to
[10:27.400 --> 10:40.320]  create your destiny is to be free free a bondage free of lesser men's control and
[10:40.320 --> 10:46.960]  I want you to stand up I want you to get focused and I want you to stop being
[10:46.960 --> 10:54.480]  afraid of turning your own personal destiny and the power that God has put
[10:54.480 --> 11:01.640]  in each of us we are literally made in the image of the creator of the
[11:01.640 --> 11:08.360]  universe you realize that's why the New Old Order hates you that's why the devil
[11:08.360 --> 11:15.400]  hates you and that's why they're so afraid of us we are literally not even
[11:15.400 --> 11:21.760]  at embryonic form of what humanity is going to become we have not even become
[11:21.760 --> 11:28.560]  larva yet ladies and gentlemen and every ounce of my being only wants to see
[11:28.560 --> 11:37.840]  the species do well and to grow and to turn into what we are to become all of
[11:37.840 --> 11:44.240]  our trials all of our tribulations everything we are and you look at who
[11:44.240 --> 11:48.440]  our heroes are today basketball players football players things that mean nothing
[11:48.440 --> 11:53.880]  today it'll mean even less tomorrow or next year no longer is it the people
[11:53.880 --> 11:56.960]  that stand up against tyranny to the heroes no longer is it the people that
[11:56.960 --> 12:03.200]  save burning children from a building no longer is it individuals who invent
[12:03.200 --> 12:09.120]  incredible new technologies no longer they know how to take your heroes and
[12:09.120 --> 12:13.160]  give you false heroes they know how to punch your buttons and manipulate you
[12:13.160 --> 12:18.760]  and it's time that you literally break out of that cage it's time for you to
[12:18.760 --> 12:22.600]  bust out and break out like the Incredible Hulk it's time to get wild
[12:22.600 --> 12:49.600]  there's nothing that can stop us you can break through the New World Order right
[12:49.600 --> 13:10.280]  now you can stop being a slave just to kiss away all these people that hate
[13:10.280 --> 13:14.760]  beauty all these people that hate strength all these people want to turn
[13:14.760 --> 13:22.840]  you in a pile of stupid dull-eyed weakness they make me sick everything in
[13:22.840 --> 13:31.360]  me wants life and green fields and happiness running over
[13:31.360 --> 13:35.880]  I don't know about you folks but I can definitely feel the freedom that is one
[13:35.880 --> 13:40.840]  of the classic Alex Jones rants and that was was playing over this guy's loud
[13:40.840 --> 13:46.040]  speaker as he drove through with info bombs literally on his car and let me
[13:46.040 --> 13:48.480]  just read you some of the article and this is gonna be posted over at
[13:48.480 --> 13:53.720]  prismplanet.com and prismplanet.tv shortly the man who police say is 31
[13:53.720 --> 13:57.600]  year-old Mark Spindler of Beaver Dam further taunted the onlookers until a
[13:57.600 --> 14:01.960]  few men ran out from the crowd and began tearing the signs off of his car once
[14:01.960 --> 14:06.440]  in 9-11 equals an inside job another read America you are slaves he held a
[14:06.440 --> 14:09.920]  camera the entire time recording at all so you see if the camera does actually
[14:09.920 --> 14:15.240]  come out he won't be taunting anybody it'll just be you know angry ignorant
[14:15.240 --> 14:20.040]  people running up to a car tearing things down that they have no idea what
[14:20.040 --> 14:23.280]  it's about none and that's if it's not the media or the police themselves
[14:23.280 --> 14:27.080]  because they often like to get involved such as when Alex Jones was bullhorning
[14:27.080 --> 14:33.080]  MSNBC over in Denver and the guy from MSNBC just comes right up to the bullhorn
[14:33.080 --> 14:36.800]  doesn't matter how much it costs doesn't matter it's not his property snip snip
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.440]  Alex Jones is no longer allowed free speech and that's how it works and then
[14:41.440 --> 14:45.520]  they always try to slander the individual at the end it's not bad enough that
[14:45.520 --> 14:49.160]  they ripped the signs down that they arrested him that they acted like his
[14:49.160 --> 14:53.280]  overlords now they're going to say he endangered innocent people police said
[14:53.280 --> 14:59.200]  spin spinler hit two people with his car and nearly hit others who had to dive
[14:59.200 --> 15:03.000]  out of the way as he tried to escape he was arrested a short time later in
[15:03.000 --> 15:09.320]  charge with second-degree reckless endangerment and disorderly con folks
[15:09.320 --> 15:13.280]  give me a break first of all this guy didn't try to hit anybody if somebody
[15:13.280 --> 15:17.160]  jumped out in front of his car which is probably the case he obviously was going
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.240]  probably five or ten miles an hour or he would have been charged with some kind
[15:21.240 --> 15:24.760]  of an assault chart see if you hit people with your car it's not just reckless
[15:24.760 --> 15:28.280]  endangerment it's assault so the guy obviously didn't hit anybody with his
[15:28.280 --> 15:33.920]  car it's absolutely a hundred and ten percent ridiculous so go check it out
[15:33.920 --> 15:38.640]  it's over info wars dot com right now and remember like I said over in uh in
[15:38.640 --> 15:42.400]  Maryland right outside of DC I mean this this truck is decked out see there's
[15:42.400 --> 15:45.560]  power in numbers folks this guy went out of the loan of course he's going to be
[15:45.560 --> 15:49.680]  targeted of course he's going to be scapegoated in this truck that they had
[15:49.680 --> 15:53.960]  however there's about a half a dozen people inside the truck whether it be
[15:53.960 --> 15:57.880]  in the bed of the front seat and then it's also got other people next to it
[15:57.880 --> 16:01.960]  with the signs I encourage people to take a look at that it was out of Tacoma
[16:01.960 --> 16:06.400]  Park at the 4th of July parade and the group consisted of about 30 activists
[16:06.400 --> 16:09.600]  again power in numbers I'm not discouraging what this guy did because
[16:09.600 --> 16:13.320]  when you're the only info warrior out there you know take up arms take up
[16:13.320 --> 16:17.720]  action that's the way to do it but when you do have you know a dozen two dozen
[16:17.720 --> 16:21.920]  three dozen people it's a lot harder for the police to set you up you see with
[16:21.920 --> 16:26.280]  with German Gary Talis for instance they didn't want to show any of the
[16:26.280 --> 16:29.560]  videotapes the woman that went down to the police station with and they didn't
[16:29.560 --> 16:33.960]  want to hear her testimony whatsoever they tried to set him up beyond belief
[16:33.960 --> 16:39.440]  and even though they had the gentleman who assaulted him his wife and the girl
[16:39.440 --> 16:44.000]  with cerebral palsy who they said was assaulted in a wheelchair testify against
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.440]  him as well as secret service agents and police guess what he beat it because
[16:48.440 --> 16:53.800]  he didn't assault a girl in a wheelchair the notion is absolutely
[16:53.800 --> 16:59.560]  ridiculous and ludicrous and ludicrous all right I'm gonna jump stories right
[16:59.560 --> 17:04.320]  now to the headliner over at prisonplanet.tv and prisonplanet.com
[17:04.320 --> 17:08.760]  we're gonna have Larry Pratt of gun owners of America on in about 43 minutes
[17:08.760 --> 17:14.240]  to discuss this latest development from the Newark mayor the Newark mayor is
[17:14.240 --> 17:19.440]  now offering a thousand dollars for people to snitch out illegal guns so if
[17:19.440 --> 17:22.200]  you're in somebody's home you see a gun you think it might be illegal you tell
[17:22.200 --> 17:25.880]  the police and here's the thing you're taking the word of a criminal let me
[17:25.880 --> 17:30.840]  repeat that you're taking the word of a criminal who is out to get money a
[17:30.840 --> 17:35.280]  thousand dollars a shot I mean come on he turns in ten people that's a 10g I
[17:35.280 --> 17:38.760]  mean you could probably turn in ten people in a week ten thousand dollars
[17:38.760 --> 17:42.160]  isn't a a shabby paycheck for a week believe me I don't make ten thousand
[17:42.160 --> 17:45.560]  dollars a week I'm gonna make anywhere near that it would make me turn my head
[17:45.560 --> 17:49.800]  and think and you know the majority of these people that get turned in are
[17:49.800 --> 17:53.600]  going to have a legal firearms now I wonder if that's really going to stop
[17:53.600 --> 17:56.600]  them from paying these people off because they like the fact even if it's a
[17:56.600 --> 18:00.680]  legal firearm now they say oh we have probable cause or we have a warrant we
[18:00.680 --> 18:03.640]  need to come into your home what are their infractions do you have is their
[18:03.640 --> 18:10.200]  other contraband here I believe this is a this is from Paul Joseph Watson we're
[18:10.200 --> 18:13.720]  gonna be playing the audio clip on the other side of this this segment the
[18:13.720 --> 18:17.640]  mayor of Newark New Jersey is offering a thousand dollars to anybody who
[18:17.640 --> 18:22.120]  anonymously anonymously provides information on quote-unquote illegal
[18:22.120 --> 18:26.480]  guns in the city in a video on posted on the city of Newark webpage we're gonna
[18:26.480 --> 18:30.920]  play that the honorable Cory A. Booker declares guns on the streets are
[18:30.920 --> 18:37.080]  unacceptable and he is offering a cash incentive for snitches now let's I mean
[18:37.080 --> 18:40.240]  can you imagine the budget first of all it's Newark New Jersey it's not as hard
[18:40.240 --> 18:44.360]  as everybody thinks it is I've been to Newark I mean it's not you know Daisy's
[18:44.360 --> 18:48.160]  rainbows and leprechauns I mean there is some crime there but it's not as bad as
[18:48.160 --> 18:53.720]  this guy's making it out to be and let's say they take out 50 guns $50,000 I
[18:53.720 --> 18:57.360]  mean that's gonna add up pretty quick there's probably a number of illegal
[18:57.360 --> 19:01.280]  weapons out in Newark New Jersey but the point is this is an excuse for police
[19:01.280 --> 19:06.120]  to come into your home even if they are legal firearms I mean how is the average
[19:06.120 --> 19:09.800]  Tom Dick or Harry going to be able to distinguish what is a legal firearm and
[19:09.800 --> 19:14.920]  what is an illegal one they're obviously not going to be able to however
[19:14.920 --> 19:18.400]  there is a very obvious a problem with the mayor's program how will the snitches
[19:18.400 --> 19:22.560]  tell the difference and here it is between an illegal and legal gun oh how
[19:22.560 --> 19:27.880]  will they do that see they won't it's blanket coverage of people with firearms
[19:27.880 --> 19:32.520]  and I'm gonna guess when these people snitch them out see they know this nine
[19:32.520 --> 19:35.840]  out of ten times it's going to be a legal firearm so they'll be able to track
[19:35.840 --> 19:39.600]  trace and database you further and say oh this guy's got a gun but they won't be
[19:39.600 --> 19:42.680]  able to take it you know and then they won't have to pay out that big prize but
[19:42.680 --> 19:45.120]  if they get one out of ten right a thousand dollars for a criminal hang
[19:45.120 --> 19:48.640]  they're all four so we're gonna play that clip coming up it's the Alex Jones show

[26:07.440 --> 26:13.600]  clip I'm Mayor Corey Booker and I like so many in our city are just saying
[26:13.600 --> 26:17.480]  enough we have had a significant reduction in shootings in our city but
[26:17.480 --> 26:21.760]  it is still too many there are a small group of people in our city that think
[26:21.760 --> 26:26.840]  they can walk around with guns it is unacceptable but we can't just wish this
[26:26.840 --> 26:31.880]  will stop we can't just hope this will stop we as individuals have to do
[26:31.880 --> 26:35.920]  something about it so we have a program in our city right now that's completely
[26:35.920 --> 26:42.760]  anonymous and we will give you cash a thousand dollars to anyone who calls our
[26:42.760 --> 26:47.160]  anonymous tip line give us the information about who is carrying a gun if
[26:47.160 --> 26:51.320]  we don't even have to have a conviction we arrest that individual and simply get
[26:51.320 --> 26:56.960]  that gun off the streets you call back get your second group of digits go to a
[26:56.960 --> 27:01.440]  bank or send somebody to a bank and they will give you a thousand dollars in
[27:01.440 --> 27:08.480]  cash no question asked this is the best program in the country a quick thousand
[27:08.480 --> 27:14.240]  dollars if you know somebody carrying a legal gun give us the information and
[27:14.240 --> 27:21.320]  get the money one thousand dollars we cannot afford to have one more person
[27:21.320 --> 27:27.120]  in our city shot we cannot afford to have one more such crime happen to
[27:27.120 --> 27:32.960]  devastate families to rip the fabric of our community I won't accept it we're
[27:32.960 --> 27:36.960]  getting so much better and driving the rate of shootings down in our city all
[27:36.960 --> 27:40.240]  right let's pull this right now now if you notice he starts out with saying oh
[27:40.240 --> 27:46.560]  shootings have gone down no kidding see they always want to you know step
[27:46.560 --> 27:50.760]  aside from the fact that oh crime is down and shootings are down but now we're
[27:50.760 --> 27:54.320]  gonna take it to the next level we're going to take legal guns and that's what
[27:54.320 --> 27:57.360]  this is notice he says we don't have to have a conviction will still give you a
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.320]  thousand dollars we just have to have that gun well we know that the police and
[28:01.320 --> 28:06.560]  the ATF are gun grabbing you know they will take whatever they can get we're
[28:06.560 --> 28:09.600]  coming in your house and don't think that if they go into a house the gun is
[28:09.600 --> 28:13.280]  registered and they find something else that that family or that person isn't
[28:13.280 --> 28:16.960]  going to be charged with that crime you can bet your sweet bottom they will be
[28:16.960 --> 28:22.720]  okay this is again databaseing those that have firearms they want to know who
[28:22.720 --> 28:28.360]  has the guns because let's be honest folks let's let's just sit here and be
[28:28.360 --> 28:33.600]  honest in Newark New Jersey if you're driving down it's pretty easy to spot the
[28:33.600 --> 28:38.960]  gangbangers it's pretty easy to spot the drug dealers how about the police do a
[28:38.960 --> 28:42.800]  little something called detective work you see somebody who looks like a
[28:42.800 --> 28:46.680]  criminal who might be selling a little blow on the streets keep tabs on that
[28:46.680 --> 28:51.160]  person that person may have an illegal firearm and then you are actually doing
[28:51.160 --> 28:56.640]  a public service see you're serving the public you're a peace officer you're not
[28:56.640 --> 29:00.560]  some jackbooted thug that's ready to kick down grandma's door because she has a
[29:00.560 --> 29:05.160]  shotgun in her closet and that's what essentially this is how are they supposed
[29:05.160 --> 29:10.960]  to know what guns are legal and illegal and they set it up so nice and simple
[29:10.960 --> 29:15.200]  for the criminal snitch if you give them that that number and they just get
[29:15.200 --> 29:18.720]  that gun off the street they don't even need a conviction we will then call you
[29:18.720 --> 29:23.280]  back with a code number you walk right down to the bank and it's a G in your
[29:23.280 --> 29:27.320]  pocket well isn't that lovely on the other side I'm gonna be playing this
[29:27.320 --> 29:30.440]  Ron Paul clip but I'm also gonna be talking about John Boehner during the
[29:30.440 --> 29:35.240]  break I was over in the coffee room he was on the floor talking about him
[29:35.240 --> 29:39.400]  being on a plane and actually receiving a note from the stewardess's and pilot

[33:01.240 --> 33:03.240]  I
[33:18.400 --> 33:20.400]  We're gonna jump to this one
[33:21.640 --> 33:26.080]  He's on the judge in the Palatino show talking about the economy and a lot of other issues
[33:26.080 --> 33:33.600]  over I really just want to focus on this gun grabbing for a moment how are they
[33:33.600 --> 33:38.200]  supposed to know whether a gun is illegal see that's the trick they don't
[33:38.200 --> 33:41.280]  want to know if the guns legal they could care less they want to see what
[33:41.280 --> 33:46.080]  part of the populace is armed because if they want to go after criminals and
[33:46.080 --> 33:51.240]  they want to take their guns away and they could do it again it is not hard
[33:51.240 --> 33:57.120]  to spot the group on the street corner that's selling crack to the kids it is
[33:57.120 --> 34:03.240]  not hard to go to a destitute a neighborhood and see where the crime
[34:03.240 --> 34:07.440]  is where the violence is I'm sure they got robberies every day in Newark, New
[34:07.440 --> 34:13.160]  Jersey okay those are the people that need to have their guns taken away well
[34:13.160 --> 34:16.560]  how do you take their guns away well you convict them of the crimes they commit
[34:16.560 --> 34:21.080]  and you convict them by doing police work you don't go to criminals and that's
[34:21.080 --> 34:24.560]  what they're doing they're going to be going to criminals and other you know
[34:24.560 --> 34:28.120]  low-level minded people who think that this is a good program but mostly
[34:28.120 --> 34:33.560]  criminals who want to snitch each other out and in a lot of cases these lower
[34:33.560 --> 34:37.200]  level criminals who are going over to you know an overboss or their larger
[34:37.200 --> 34:40.400]  drug dealer or their connection some of those guns are probably legal as well
[34:40.400 --> 34:44.640]  and they're just gonna run them right in they want that thousand dollars folks
[34:44.640 --> 34:48.040]  so this is just nightmarish and this shows the tattletale society that's
[34:48.040 --> 34:50.680]  being built and you're going to see it more and more and more and it's not
[34:50.680 --> 34:54.800]  just going to be for guns it's gonna be your kids ratting you out because you
[34:54.800 --> 34:58.920]  have three bags of garbage this week and you're not being environmentally
[34:58.920 --> 35:06.400]  friendly we need eco officers eco officers and at the break I was just
[35:06.400 --> 35:11.000]  touching on John Boehner and we played a lot of those clips on on my program like
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.520]  a week and a half ago and on the Alex Jones show where he was talking for over
[35:14.520 --> 35:18.880]  an hour and a half about this health care bill which they stuck 300 pages in
[35:18.880 --> 35:24.520]  at the last minute posted at 3 a.m. and then didn't have a physical copy
[35:24.520 --> 35:28.680]  literally would not allow a physical copy of the bill to be seen until it was
[35:28.680 --> 35:33.720]  already past 219 to 212 and Boehner sitting there talking about how he
[35:33.720 --> 35:37.480]  fell asleep on a plane and he woke up and there was a note there signed by the
[35:37.480 --> 35:41.920]  captain and the stewardess thank you for standing up for our rights thank you for
[35:41.920 --> 35:46.720]  trying to stop socialized health care and up for the past couple days now I've
[35:46.720 --> 35:50.720]  been working on the Obama deception to by going through footage and whatnot to
[35:50.720 --> 35:53.440]  try to figure out you know what clips we're gonna actually put into the movie
[35:53.440 --> 35:57.360]  and by the way folks a lot of people are asking you why I'm not doing my show
[35:57.360 --> 36:00.520]  five nights a week it's because I have to work on my own film and believe it or
[36:00.520 --> 36:05.000]  not it's actually very tough to do a entire movie essentially by yourself and
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.520]  right now I am the only one working on it so this is really freeing me up
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.360]  another four or five hours a day to work on the picture and it's coming along
[36:12.360 --> 36:15.520]  great I can't wait to put out invisible Empire but right now I'm taking a step
[36:15.520 --> 36:19.880]  back and I'm helping out with the Obama deception to and I'm watching Gibbs the
[36:19.880 --> 36:24.600]  press secretary being questioned about this health care reform bill and he's
[36:24.600 --> 36:27.680]  sitting there laughing as he says yeah of course we're gonna have to cut
[36:27.680 --> 36:31.600]  benefits somebody's cell phone goes off and it's a big joke oh yeah there will
[36:31.600 --> 36:35.680]  be sacrifices that have to be made and there will be given takes which means
[36:35.680 --> 36:40.920]  less for us and more for them and more socialized forced health care and you
[36:40.920 --> 36:44.520]  know you'll have your little medical van you can go to it's not gonna help you
[36:44.520 --> 36:49.400]  it's going to poison you as they say oh take the WHO swine flu vaccine shot it's
[36:49.400 --> 36:53.400]  mandatory as they make makeshift vaccination centers at your kids school
[36:53.400 --> 36:59.040]  that's the plan that's the open plan by Catherine Sibelis the head of health
[36:59.040 --> 37:02.360]  and human services the Bilderberg broad as I like to call her she's been there
[37:02.360 --> 37:07.440]  last couple years and she is frothing at the mouth frothing at the mouth to
[37:07.440 --> 37:11.440]  start injecting your kids with poison and then you with poison when you come to
[37:11.440 --> 37:15.640]  pick them up do you get it that's why they're having it as a school they're
[37:15.640 --> 37:19.680]  going to get the kids first and the parents next and then in Canada because
[37:19.680 --> 37:22.360]  they don't think that they're gonna be able to get the 18 to 30 year old crowd
[37:22.360 --> 37:25.640]  because they can put the vaccination centers on college campuses all they
[37:25.640 --> 37:29.240]  want kids aren't gonna go to it you know they're a little too busy and probably
[37:29.240 --> 37:31.920]  a little too smart to think yeah I'm actually gonna get swine flu I mean it
[37:31.920 --> 37:35.200]  was hyped out of control so how are they gonna get those how are they gonna get
[37:35.200 --> 37:39.200]  that 18 to 30 crowd and watch when this comes to this country they're going to
[37:39.200 --> 37:44.880]  make makeshift vaccination centers outside of bars now I can't even tell you
[37:44.880 --> 37:47.760]  how dangerous this is on the level that you shouldn't be injecting somebody
[37:47.760 --> 37:51.440]  with a shot while their blood is thinned out because they're they have a high
[37:51.440 --> 37:54.200]  alcohol content and they don't know what's going on you think this is gonna
[37:54.200 --> 37:57.880]  stop them from sticking people in the arm no they're gonna do it with a smile
[37:57.880 --> 38:01.800]  on their face hey you're gonna need that swine flu vaccine you're getting
[38:01.800 --> 38:06.320]  somebody with like and just totally wasted has 15 drinks under their belt
[38:06.320 --> 38:11.840]  okay and roll on my sleeve I mean that's how sick it is that's the new
[38:11.840 --> 38:16.840]  health care in this country and across the world for this quote-unquote new
[38:16.840 --> 38:21.200]  world order which they are erecting we're gonna get into the g8 climate bill
[38:21.200 --> 38:25.880]  all that stuff in the next three hours but I want to play this Ron Paul clip
[38:25.880 --> 38:29.440]  right now from Judge and Napolitano and like I said we're going to have Larry
[38:29.440 --> 38:35.440]  Pratt on to discuss this disgusting Newark mayor's proposal a thousand dollars
[38:35.440 --> 38:39.760]  a gun all right let's hit the Ron Paul clip in America today
[38:39.760 --> 38:44.640]  congressman Ron Paul joins us from our nation's capital congressman Paul
[38:44.640 --> 38:50.520]  welcome back to freedom watch thank you judge good to be with you what what is
[38:50.520 --> 38:58.280]  the status of your bill which now has a huge number well more than half I think
[38:58.280 --> 39:04.960]  of co-sponsors in the house to regulate the Fed what is its status in the Senate
[39:04.960 --> 39:10.600]  well in the house we have 250 co-sponsors and 80 Democrats so we're
[39:10.600 --> 39:14.960]  doing very well of course in the Senate we don't have as many members just a
[39:14.960 --> 39:21.160]  few but Jim DeMent is doing a tremendous job over there and try to attach it last
[39:21.160 --> 39:27.040]  week now that was denied on a technicality but that is just a facade
[39:27.040 --> 39:31.360]  because the technicalities are always ignored for things that they want this
[39:31.360 --> 39:36.240]  means they don't want it and this is their organized effort now to stop us
[39:36.240 --> 39:39.200]  but we're not going to be stopped it's just going to energize everybody at the
[39:39.200 --> 39:45.120]  grassroots because the grassroots are for this that's why we have 250 co-sponsors
[39:45.120 --> 39:50.480]  and as you just described in your opening statement this whole idea that the
[39:50.480 --> 39:54.320]  Fed created the problem that we have created a bubble and then we're going
[39:54.320 --> 39:59.440]  to give him give the Fed more power it it makes no sense any place anybody can
[39:59.440 --> 40:02.960]  figure out how this could happen it would be in Washington DC you know
[40:02.960 --> 40:07.040]  something creates a problem so we get them promoted what are the powers that
[40:07.040 --> 40:15.120]  be afraid of that might be revealed if and when the Fed has audited I think
[40:15.120 --> 40:20.020]  the biggest thing is the cronyism you know who got the benefits who really
[40:20.020 --> 40:27.000]  got some of these Fed Federal Reserve funds as well as tarp funds and I don't
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.800]  think they want people to know about it and also for me internationally I'd
[40:31.800 --> 40:34.920]  like to know what they're doing internationally what kind of agreements
[40:34.920 --> 40:39.400]  they have with international banks with other governments and also what they
[40:39.400 --> 40:42.340]  do in the gold market how they manipulate the value of the dollar by
[40:42.340 --> 40:48.680]  manipulating gold prices so there is just so much that that we can learn but
[40:48.680 --> 40:52.280]  the truth is when people ask me exactly what are you going to find the whole
[40:52.280 --> 40:56.280]  point is we don't know exactly what we're going to find but we know one
[40:56.280 --> 40:59.680]  thing they're going to dig their heels in they're going to do everything in the
[40:59.680 --> 41:04.680]  world to prevent this bill from passing I hope that you find that the public
[41:04.680 --> 41:10.440]  recognizes that since the Fed began its secretive and monopolistic ways of
[41:10.440 --> 41:16.560]  regulating our monetary policy and our money supply in 1913 that the value that
[41:16.560 --> 41:20.440]  the dollar has lost about 95 percent of its buying power wouldn't it be
[41:20.440 --> 41:25.080]  wonderful if people discovered that found it out we all know it already and
[41:25.080 --> 41:31.200]  decided to get rid of the Fed well I think this is the first major step of
[41:31.200 --> 41:34.840]  course we have more co-sponsors on this bill not because we pick in the
[41:34.840 --> 41:39.240]  position exactly what we should replace it with but everybody agrees we need to
[41:39.240 --> 41:43.680]  know what they're doing whether you believe in a monitorist approach a
[41:43.680 --> 41:49.280]  Keynesian approach or a hard-money approach the American people now want us
[41:49.280 --> 41:55.400]  to find out what's going on they want transparency and that to me is a good
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.840]  time for us to find out what is happening but like you say when we
[41:59.840 --> 42:02.920]  discover what's really been going on I think the American people are going to
[42:02.920 --> 42:06.040]  demand the next step they're going to demand honest money it's happened many
[42:06.040 --> 42:12.080]  times over history usually when you have the vote by the general public on
[42:12.080 --> 42:16.320]  honest money sound money hard money versus paper the people always vote for
[42:16.320 --> 42:21.520]  sound money because it makes so much sense you're dogged indefatigable
[42:21.520 --> 42:28.080]  tireless effort to expose this monster is so so revealing and so rewarding of
[42:28.080 --> 42:34.080]  your own personal understanding of how our economic society works it's amazing
[42:34.080 --> 42:39.040]  to me the number of people from all across the political spectrum of every
[42:39.040 --> 42:45.080]  type of political ideology imaginable in the House of Representatives that is now
[42:45.080 --> 42:50.040]  in favor of this what what frustrates me is that the structure of the House of
[42:50.040 --> 42:54.320]  Representatives starting with Mrs. Pelosi and going to Congressman Frank gives
[42:54.320 --> 42:59.040]  such extraordinary power to individual human beings who have positions of
[42:59.040 --> 43:03.040]  hierarchy in the House that they can frustrate what has now become the
[43:03.040 --> 43:09.680]  overwhelming majority will of members of the House yeah I think this is it's a
[43:09.680 --> 43:14.160]  great but I give credit to the grassroots and I think we get the kind of
[43:14.160 --> 43:18.600]  government that we deserve and I think that if the grassroots America wake up
[43:18.600 --> 43:23.920]  they can change government I mean the system still works to that degree it's
[43:23.920 --> 43:28.840]  getting on shaking grounds but it will work if the American people really wake
[43:28.840 --> 43:32.880]  up and demand changes the members of most of the part of members of Congress
[43:32.880 --> 43:37.880]  are decent people and they like their job so if they like their job and the
[43:37.880 --> 43:41.920]  American people say look you can't have a job unless you do our bidding that
[43:41.920 --> 43:45.440]  means we know we need to get this thing under control that to me is a healthy
[43:45.440 --> 43:48.840]  sign this morning the House of Representatives Committee on oversight
[43:48.840 --> 43:54.120]  and government reform issued about a hundred and ten page report which
[43:54.120 --> 43:59.520]  basically told us what we already knew a Peter Schiff who will be on in just a
[43:59.520 --> 44:07.400]  few moments predicted before September of 08 that the housing crisis would
[44:07.400 --> 44:12.880]  cause this recession Tom Woods has a catalog this outlined it will also be
[44:12.880 --> 44:17.400]  on in a few minutes brilliantly in his book meltdown but it's it's astonishing
[44:17.400 --> 44:21.680]  to me that some aspect of the Congress has finally acknowledged that the
[44:21.680 --> 44:27.320]  government was behind the housing crisis that the Community Reinvestment Act of
[44:27.320 --> 44:32.600]  77 forced banks to loan monies in neighborhoods and at amounts where the
[44:32.600 --> 44:36.360]  banks would not do it if they were permitted to be motivated by just the
[44:36.360 --> 44:41.280]  free market that Fannie and Freddie were willing to take all the bad mortgages and
[44:41.280 --> 44:45.200]  all the bad loans that the government encouraged the banks to make that the
[44:45.200 --> 44:48.760]  Bush administration ordered the Department of Housing and Urban
[44:48.760 --> 44:53.720]  Development to make available a hundred and fifty thousand mortgages with zero
[44:53.720 --> 44:57.920]  money down which as you know congressmen in some states isn't even considered a
[44:57.920 --> 45:03.240]  purchase it's considered a lease I'm sort of stunned that anybody in the
[45:03.240 --> 45:08.440]  government now admits this but I'm not expecting that to change their ways are
[45:08.440 --> 45:14.800]  you no I think the leadership still likes those programs the basic flaw is the
[45:14.800 --> 45:18.360]  easy money the easy credit and lower than market interest rates that causes the
[45:18.360 --> 45:23.120]  difficulties but then when you add on to the CRA and these other government
[45:23.120 --> 45:27.440]  programs dictating the terms they literally encourage at the threat of
[45:27.440 --> 45:33.880]  punishment if you do not make these bad loans so that's like pouring
[45:33.880 --> 45:37.960]  gasoline on a fire made the made the bubble grow that much bigger and finally
[45:37.960 --> 45:43.400]  you know it burst so yes and what are we doing now we're trying to bail that
[45:43.400 --> 45:51.080]  system out we reignite that whole process and I just see that it'll be
[45:51.080 --> 45:56.360]  totally totally impossible for them to achieve any any recovery and what
[45:56.360 --> 46:01.080]  they're doing here all right I mean that really does show how they destroyed us
[46:01.080 --> 46:07.280]  by design let me say it again destroyed us by design destroyed the economy by
[46:07.280 --> 46:13.400]  design destroying the dollar right now by design destroying the housing market
[46:13.400 --> 46:19.360]  by design even the Palatano mainline Fox News guy I mean Alex is Adam on the
[46:19.360 --> 46:24.320]  program now is coming full circle and saying yes it is the government yes it
[46:24.320 --> 46:28.280]  does transcend left and right yes the Bush administration was part of this
[46:28.280 --> 46:34.400]  yes this is a long-standing program to gut this country and you notice that the
[46:34.400 --> 46:38.240]  mainstream media the majority of it ninety nine point nine nine nine nine
[46:38.240 --> 46:44.240]  nine percent is not even talking about this federal reserve audit what so ever
[46:44.240 --> 46:49.880]  it's like it doesn't exist you say it again it's like it doesn't exist the one
[46:49.880 --> 46:55.160]  time you see it on CNBC the one time the guy says well if they are at the Fed
[46:55.160 --> 46:59.000]  well the economy will collapse and the dollar will collapse and we'll go into
[46:59.000 --> 47:03.440]  utter chaos so there can't be any accountability and then Ben Bernackie a
[47:03.440 --> 47:11.080]  week and a half later on the floor says the same exact thing after lying about
[47:11.080 --> 47:14.320]  how great is website well we have a website and that boy that website has
[47:14.320 --> 47:18.520]  come leaps and bounds in the last year and it's done so well and all the
[47:18.520 --> 47:22.920]  answers are on that website meanwhile when Senator Bernie Sanders asked him
[47:22.920 --> 47:25.240]  where the money went and he says go to the website
[47:25.240 --> 47:29.800]  Sandra says it's not on the website and Bernackie says you can't see it and then
[47:29.800 --> 47:34.880]  he toes the same exact line a week and a half ago when he says if you are at the
[47:34.880 --> 47:38.200]  Fed well that'll just collapse the economy and you're essentially letting
[47:38.200 --> 47:41.800]  Congress take over the Federal Reserve and it'll be a congressional takeover
[47:41.800 --> 47:46.240]  no it's called checks and balances Congress is supposed to be checking on
[47:46.240 --> 47:50.240]  the executive and legislative branch unfortunately the Federal Reserve is a
[47:50.240 --> 47:54.480]  private out-of-control organization and they know it so they kind of scoff and
[47:54.480 --> 47:59.680]  laugh at the entire idea and we're gonna play a senator Jim DeWitt
[47:59.680 --> 48:04.360]  DeMant and there's a story over at info wars.com prisonplan.com right now
[48:04.360 --> 48:08.360]  about this but we're gonna play the video of him discussing this audit the
[48:08.360 --> 48:13.360]  Fed bill trying to get it as an amendment and getting it shot down in the

[54:57.320 --> 55:02.320]  powered businessmen and he's joking about how unemployment is going to shoot
[55:02.320 --> 55:06.960]  through the roof all the way up through 2010 and he's got a positive outlook on
[55:06.960 --> 55:10.120]  it that's when the growth will start that's when the economy will recover

[55:50.960 --> 56:00.440]  dot com that's h o m e g a i n dot com go visit right now all right us consumers
[56:00.440 --> 56:07.360]  fall behind on loans at record let me say again at record pace this is out of
[56:07.360 --> 56:12.600]  Reuters this is off a newswire when we knew the economy was bad and we knew
[56:12.600 --> 56:15.720]  people were losing their homes and we knew people couldn't make their car
[56:15.720 --> 56:20.280]  payments and we knew the government was socializing health care as more and more
[56:20.280 --> 56:25.120]  people had to give up their health care because jobs aren't offering as benefits
[56:25.120 --> 56:30.360]  anymore forget about it and number two most people can't afford it soaring u.s.
[56:30.360 --> 56:34.120]  unemployment in a shrinking economy drove delinquencies on credit card debt and
[56:34.120 --> 56:38.480]  home equity loans to all-time highs let me say to get all-time highs in the
[56:38.480 --> 56:42.240]  first quarter as a record number of cash-strapped consumers fell behind on
[56:42.240 --> 56:47.880]  their bills delinquencies on value of all-car debt soared to a record six point
[56:47.880 --> 56:52.760]  six oh percent from five point five two percent in the fourth quarter so more
[56:52.760 --> 56:58.120]  than one percentage point it has gone up the american bankers association said
[56:58.120 --> 57:03.040]  late payments on home equity loans rose three point five two percent from three
[57:03.040 --> 57:08.600]  point zero three percent and on home equity lines of credit climbed to one
[57:08.600 --> 57:12.360]  point eight nine percent from one point four six percent a broader gauge
[57:12.360 --> 57:16.040]  showing late payments on eight categories of loans rose for a fourth
[57:16.040 --> 57:23.520]  straight quarter that's a full year every quarter for a full year late
[57:23.520 --> 57:28.080]  payments are on the rise edging up to a three point two three percent from three
[57:28.080 --> 57:32.240]  point two to the rate actually understates consumer pain because it
[57:32.240 --> 57:38.080]  excludes credit cards so these they're low balling you while they tell you
[57:38.080 --> 57:42.000]  yeah the economy is in the crapper and you don't think the economy's in the
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.000]  crapper well this one is out of the washington business journal economist
[57:46.000 --> 57:52.280]  fdic gearing up for bank closures the federal deposit insurance corp is

[1:00:33.180 --> 1:00:37.600]  new work mayor offering thousand dollars essentially the criminals and snitches
[1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:42.320]  you say again essentially the criminals and snitches to try to rat out gun owners
[1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:48.200]  and they say it's for illegal guns how is a criminal slash snitch going to know
[1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:51.800]  when somebody has a legal or illegal firearm and you notice when you listen
[1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:54.920]  to the clip the guy says well we don't actually have to convict anybody for you
[1:00:54.920 --> 1:00:58.440]  to get your money we just have to arrest them and take their gun we arrest them
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:02.240]  and take their gun you're good for a G buddy that's the way we should roll in
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:07.600]  America I want to just slightly touch on this topic before we get into the gun
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:12.560]  rights with Larry Pratt no one's really talking about this g8 I tried to switch
[1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:16.400]  on all these news networks yesterday and get live g8 coverage it wasn't
[1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:20.640]  anywhere I was checking wasn't on c-span one wasn't on c-span two was barely
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:25.280]  covered on Fox News barely covered on CNN just a little 30 second or 90 second
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:31.120]  blurbs and the big thing since they really did pass their global currency
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:36.000]  basically letting the IMF and Federal Reserve print their SDR units and no
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:40.360]  longer having to back them with the dollar as the World Reserve currency
[1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:43.440]  that standard drawing rights units and they have something else I was a couple
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:46.960]  weeks ago I'm a little rusty folks they had a different type of loan out there
[1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:52.320]  that is not dollar alone either meanwhile you had Brazil Russia India and
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:58.200]  China meet about three four weeks ago and openly state they want to get rid of
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:01.360]  the dollars as the World Reserve currency and they're also going to be
[1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:04.680]  discussing that at this g8 I'm sure it's already been discussed the media is
[1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:07.480]  just not reporting on it yet and the reason I'm going to talk about the
[1:02:07.480 --> 1:02:11.800]  climate bills and the global warming targets is because we did pass this
[1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:15.440]  ridiculous climate bill on this country people still don't understand what this
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:20.240]  energy bill means but it means horrific consequences for you and yours the
[1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:25.560]  highest tax increase ever you not being allowed to use as much energy as you
[1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:30.640]  once did you're going to be paying more or less let me say it again paying more
[1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:36.520]  or less and they're saying well we were the g8 nations are to cut carbon
[1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:41.640]  emissions by 80% by 2050 now if you listen to any of my programs most
[1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:46.280]  of this is on the weight of us it's on our shoulders the United States's
[1:02:46.280 --> 1:02:50.200]  shoulders the numbers are ridiculous most of these countries aren't going to
[1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:53.760]  have to be reducing their carbon emissions by 80% or 50% they're just
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:56.120]  going to claim that they're developing nations and they can't do so because they
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:03:02.040]  know it's all a joke carbon footprint give me a break meanwhile globalists
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:06.600]  like George Moonby odd he's on one of the heads of the Guardian one of the
[1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:11.160]  disgusting journalists out there that loves to attack 9-11 truth he's saying
[1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:15.520]  that to stop oil coal and electricity companies inserting their views into the
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:20.800]  media by stealth we need to make blog commentators accountable so what this
[1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:24.080]  really means is they want to go after free speech they want to go after
[1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:29.040]  bloggers and sites like info wars and prison planet they could care less
[1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:32.960]  about the industry sneaking their views in through blogs that happens all the
[1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:37.160]  time there there are actual things are snuck in through the media because they
[1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:44.360]  own the media general electric owns NBC this is a big conglomerate and the way

[1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:01.280]  world order he wrote an entire book about it it's either a book or an
[1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:04.440]  extensive paper I remember reading the thing I couldn't believe it because this
[1:04:04.440 --> 1:04:09.320]  guy again doesn't want the truth to come out he wants global governance and he
[1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:14.120]  wants you to believe that the boogeyman is out there the carbon dioxide boogeyman

[1:08:17.040 --> 1:08:21.960]  very proud of gun owners of America and we're streaming live right now over at
[1:08:21.960 --> 1:08:26.280]  prisonplanet.tv I just want to play this amazing clip of the mayor actually
[1:08:26.280 --> 1:08:30.040]  admitting yeah you know shootings are down and gun deaths are down but we want
[1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:33.720]  to take them down even further and we don't even need a conviction if we get a
[1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:38.840]  gun off the street we'll give you a thousand dollars anonymously hit it
[1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:44.040]  hi I'm Mayor Cory Booker and I like so many in our city are just saying enough
[1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:48.240]  we have had a significant reduction in shootings in our city but it is still
[1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:52.160]  too many there are a small group of people in our city that think they can
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:57.000]  walk around with guns it is unacceptable but we can't just wish this
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:02.040]  will stop we can't just hope this will stop we as individuals have to do
[1:09:02.040 --> 1:09:05.520]  something about it so we have a program in our city right now that's
[1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:12.240]  completely anonymous and we will give you cash a thousand dollars to anyone who
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:17.200]  calls our anonymous tip line give us the information about who is carrying a gun
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:20.960]  if we don't even have to have a conviction we arrest that individual and
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:25.960]  simply get that gun off the streets you call back get your second group of
[1:09:25.960 --> 1:09:31.040]  digits go to a bank or send somebody to a bank and they will give you a thousand
[1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:37.200]  dollars in cash no question asked this is the best program in the country a
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:43.160]  quick thousand dollars if you know somebody carrying a legal gun give us
[1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:50.640]  the information and get the money one thousand dollars we cannot afford to have
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:55.920]  one more person in our city shot we cannot afford to have one more such
[1:09:55.920 --> 1:10:01.840]  crime happen to devastate families to rip the fabric of our community I won't
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:06.520]  accept it we're getting so much better and driving the rate of shootings down
[1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:11.440]  in our city but now I'm offering you a thousand dollars for a little bit of
[1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:17.080]  information to help us keep our city and our communities even more safe step up
[1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:24.240]  stand up let's get these guns off our street a thousand dollars thank you and
[1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:28.080]  I mean you really have to watch the video to appreciate that he's got the money in
[1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:32.560]  his hand just feeling it out thrown in their face and like I said what type of
[1:10:32.560 --> 1:10:36.760]  low-life criminal isn't gonna want that thousand dollars they're going to report
[1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:41.480]  anybody and everybody they suspect of having a firearm illegal or not and
[1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:45.480]  then this will give the police the probable cause to go into your home
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:50.440]  illegally search it for other contraband and arrest you for that and
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:53.640]  probably take your gun even if it's if it's legal they've done it before they'll
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:59.320]  do it again Larry Pratt what's your take well it's a really slick plan if you
[1:10:59.320 --> 1:11:05.720]  like the way they did business in Nazi Germany or in Soviet Union or in
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:13.920]  Castro's Cuba it's a surefire plan to make sure that nobody trusts anybody
[1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:19.480]  that it's impossible to conspire against the government even politically let
[1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:25.560]  alone any other way because you you may be talking to a snitch that's going to
[1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:32.800]  turn you in and the I guess the other thought that comes to my mind in addition
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:42.480]  to the totalitarian outrageousness of that mayor's views is that he is and no
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:49.560]  doubt a typical product of government schooling and probably has no idea that
[1:11:49.560 --> 1:11:58.240]  the term militia in our Constitution and in our Bill of Rights that term had 150
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:05.840]  years of very clear settled meaning and that was that every free man between
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:12.240]  certain ages had to have a military toward the end in the beginning of the
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:18.600]  early Republican period have a military rifle and not to have one under
[1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:27.240]  colonial law would get you a fine so here he wants to pay the opposite he
[1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:34.440]  wants to pay a bounty for snitching out when somebody has a gun which under the
[1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:39.920]  Constitution he's supposed to have especially if it's today's battle rifle
[1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:45.840]  there's no question that that's what every male free male in this country
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:51.920]  should have in his possession and here you've got this nut that assumes that
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:57.240]  somehow the criminals are going to be flummoxed by a plan which as you point
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:13:03.440]  out the ones that will really game this plan are the criminals exactly that's
[1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:06.400]  exactly what I'm saying the people that are going to be turning people in our
[1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:10.000]  low-level drug dealers they're the ones that actually would hold up a convenience
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:13.800]  store and let's be honest we're not advocating criminals to have guns on the
[1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:18.760]  streets especially you know handguns and whatnot while they deal drugs but if
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:22.800]  the police wanted to do something called detective work and their jobs they
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:26.000]  know where these neighborhoods are they know where the drugs are being dealt
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.240]  they know where the illegal firearms are being brandished on the streets why
[1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:34.800]  not follow the criminals why take criminals words for it and then go into
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:39.800]  law-abiding citizens homes searching for quote-unquote illegal firearms when
[1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:43.240]  again they have to take a criminals word for it that that firearm is illegal in
[1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:47.680]  the first place another cheaper way to accomplish what what he's really
[1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:52.640]  accomplished what he says he's trying to do which is to lower crime he puts it in
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:58.200]  terms of getting guns off the street and that's going to happen when hell freezes
[1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:03.320]  over but the question has always been and it never seems to occur to these
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:10.680]  folks who feel the way the mayor does is that criminals break laws and they're
[1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:15.480]  always going to have guns but if you if he were to take a completely different
[1:14:15.480 --> 1:14:22.800]  tact and he were to say okay I just want every citizen to come in here show
[1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:27.080]  valid drivers license and we're going to give you a permit to carry a concealed
[1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:34.800]  firearm and happy hunting tell the criminals their day has come now that
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:39.480]  would work that has worked in jurisdictions it may not be I'm trying
[1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:46.920]  to be as outrageous as the mayor but that very kind of policy has worked in
[1:14:46.920 --> 1:14:52.320]  the jurisdictions that say you know what the good guys by definition are good
[1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:58.080]  guys they ought to have a gun if they want one because that way when the cops
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:02.560]  can't get there in time which is usually what's going to happen then they'll be
[1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:07.320]  able to take care of themselves and if it's a really good day a robbery gone
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:12.880]  right means a dead crook and you know I'd like you to really elaborate on the
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:17.880]  point that this is a modern-day Stasi snitch force and really to put people in
[1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:21.080]  fear that they don't know who they're associating with they don't know who
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:24.680]  they're talking to because I see guns is the first step and the next step is
[1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:28.480]  going to be oh you know their carbon footprint is too much we have to be the
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:33.080]  ecological police or they're not going along with the National Service program
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:40.240]  or like in San Francisco they either are or about to implement an ordinance that
[1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:45.400]  will have the trash police that may be their actual name but that's what they
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:53.000]  are going around to see in your trash to make sure that your news papers are in
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:58.240]  one container in your glasses and another and blah blah blah blah boy down
[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:02.800]  the line and of course all this costs a lot of money and it never occurs to them
[1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:09.840]  that money is one way that you register an objective reading of carbon footprint
[1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:14.880]  and if it costs more money to recycle maybe recycling is actually counter
[1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:20.000]  productive there's a great program about that I don't necessarily always agree
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:23.560]  with a pen and teller but they have a program on showtime where they really
[1:16:23.560 --> 1:16:27.440]  go over the farce that is the recycling industry and how much power that they
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:31.560]  have to put into recycle this stuff look I'm not against the environment a lot of
[1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:34.800]  people try to read this is oh he wants to pollute the earth I just don't want
[1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:39.280]  everything I do track trace and database when it comes to my garbage thank
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:43.360]  you now now we're coming back full circle and you're talking about this
[1:16:43.360 --> 1:16:49.920]  snitch issue in general and it is something that will infect every area
[1:16:49.920 --> 1:16:56.760]  of life and it would be something that would accompany I'm afraid another
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:17:01.920]  development that is already well underway if somebody can get a thousand
[1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:05.160]  bucks just for turning you in and getting you arrested as the mayor said
[1:17:05.160 --> 1:17:11.840]  not even convicted at least presumably in the court you had a shot at due
[1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:18.040]  process an attorney expert witnesses against them the government has the
[1:17:18.040 --> 1:17:23.720]  burden of proof on it which is an extremely significant matter all that
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:30.160]  goes away if it's snitch power instead of jury power and we have seen that
[1:17:30.160 --> 1:17:35.840]  happen in a series of steps taken by the federal government done happily our
[1:17:35.840 --> 1:17:41.440]  friends at the NRA have been oblivious to and supported the the beginning of it
[1:17:41.440 --> 1:17:45.920]  was an oh seven when a measure passed the Congress without a recorded vote
[1:17:45.920 --> 1:17:51.800]  because the NRA was supporting a an anti-gun bills submitted by Carolyn
[1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:57.680]  McCarthy are unarguably one of the leading anti-gunners in the Congress and
[1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:04.800]  this measure provides for the barring of gun ownership to anybody with a
[1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:08.920]  medical record that might suggest that they might be a danger to self or
[1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:13.640]  others no trial none of the due process in other words the smith snitch
[1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:19.520]  mentality and in this case the snitch even inadvertently unawares is your
[1:18:19.520 --> 1:18:24.680]  shrink your social worker the school nurse that puts you on riddle in
[1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:31.640]  whatever that indicates that you might be somebody that might be a problem they
[1:18:31.640 --> 1:18:35.800]  don't have to bother going to court now and they love targeting veterans of all
[1:18:35.800 --> 1:18:40.200]  people you know we're in iraq you serve two and a half years you suffer from
[1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:44.960]  ptsd no gun for you yeah and it started with the veterans but the way and we
[1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:51.120]  for that reason labeled it the veterans disarmament act but it was not
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:56.120]  intended adjust for them it simply didn't have the money in the bill to
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:19:01.160]  provide for everybody else that's going to get zapped by this thing well guess
[1:19:01.160 --> 1:19:09.800]  what the socialist in chief got that big bailout measure passed and in it was
[1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:16.240]  twenty billion big ones for comp putting into a uniform computer system all of
[1:19:16.240 --> 1:19:21.320]  the medical records in the entire country and what we're fighting over right
[1:19:21.320 --> 1:19:25.520]  now in the national health care nationalized medicine system is whether
[1:19:25.520 --> 1:19:31.000]  or not you have to submit your medical information when your doctor would have
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:35.240]  to submit it so they're kind of closing the loop on us folks with their trying
[1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:38.600]  to build this smart grid i see commercials for it every single day
[1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:42.200]  every single day i see a commercial how great the smart grid is going to be how
[1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:44.960]  all your health records are going to be on this grid how they're going to use it
[1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:48.680]  to fight terror and crime you see biometric scans of people it is
[1:19:48.680 --> 1:19:53.680]  happening there are so many nexus points with this one point of a thousand

[1:20:10.600 --> 1:20:14.440]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about performing gold and
[1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:18.280]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[1:20:18.280 --> 1:20:21.840]  our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of

[1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:15.240]  that I think all of us would like to see the Obama deception completely
[1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:19.040]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American
[1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:24.200]  people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if
[1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:28.520]  you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who
[1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:33.880]  is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[1:22:33.880 --> 1:22:40.400]  that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government

[1:24:12.840 --> 1:24:18.280]  you know I just want to give out one other just scenario I came up with over
[1:24:18.280 --> 1:24:24.320]  the break that just shows how flawed and ridiculous this program is now I'm a
[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:28.840]  criminal I'm a drug dealer I'm a gun dealer I'm going around and selling
[1:24:28.840 --> 1:24:32.880]  weapons now I'm thinking to myself man I'm not making enough on these weapons
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:38.120]  sales why don't I catalog my clientele so I'll sell a gun for between three and
[1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:42.320]  six hundred dollars knowing it's illegal I'll then go give that gun to
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:46.520]  somebody then turn them in and make another thousand dollars on it and I'm
[1:24:46.520 --> 1:24:50.920]  anonymous so this guy who gets his gun taken away never even gets to face his
[1:24:50.920 --> 1:24:54.260]  accuser essentially the end of habeas corpus if you're going to do this
[1:24:54.260 --> 1:24:58.160]  randomly a gun dealer could be just turning in his clientele again and again
[1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:02.040]  again now does that really keep guns off the street no the supplier is still
[1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:05.240]  there and maybe he doesn't run in all of his clientele because some of them are
[1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:08.480]  repeat customers and it's not business savvy for him to turn them in for a
[1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:12.440]  thousand dollars but the lower level customers it's more than business savvy
[1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:15.840]  for him and that's just one of the many things that is wrong with this bill on
[1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:19.920]  top of creating this this next stasi force and like we said you know it
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:23.440]  starts with guns and then they're the environmental police and this really is
[1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:27.160]  the nexus point I mean Newark New Jersey is a city center I'm sure that they
[1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:30.880]  have a city year group that's now funded by America or one of these national
[1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:35.120]  commercials and that is the next step in snitch services they're going to be
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:40.520]  going door-to-door on September 11th this year to try to recruit you into this
[1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:46.440]  civil service corps meanwhile HR 1444 is out there and they literally say they
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:51.240]  are putting out committees or national service for everybody including baby
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:54.680]  boomers baby boomers get their own section I mean I don't know about you
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:58.280]  Larry but I don't think that we need 60 year old women and men in city year
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:06.040]  jackets as the new stasi force that's the idea is to have neighborhoods full of
[1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:10.920]  watchful eyes after all if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear
[1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:18.280]  and that is probably one of the really most infamous lies that we get from the
[1:26:18.280 --> 1:26:24.520]  statist types you'll notice that they want the sheep to be transparent they
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:29.560]  want to put chips in us but do we know their bank accounts do we know there
[1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:34.480]  where their kids go to school do we know where they live no I don't think so in
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:40.240]  fact in some cases it's actually illegal to disclose some of that kind of
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:45.720]  information about public officials we've seen we've seen the hypocrisy of
[1:26:45.720 --> 1:26:52.760]  transparency with newspapers who from time to time go on a let's tell the
[1:26:52.760 --> 1:26:58.520]  world including especially stalkers and other criminals who the people are with
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:04.040]  concealed carry permits want to know where dr. Smith lives that might have a
[1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:12.360]  bunch of pain pills in his house well here it is so in Virginia this was done
[1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:16.800]  some time ago and list of all the concealed carry holders were was
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:22.400]  published in a newspaper in Fredericksburg and the retaliation was
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:28.880]  swift and I thought rather clever and effective it wasn't more than a week or
[1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:35.720]  so before online was the social security number name and address and I'm not
[1:27:35.720 --> 1:27:40.400]  sure what other personal information about the folks at the newspapers the
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:45.120]  editor of the report whatever that had published all this information all of a
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:51.120]  sudden there was an outrage why what are they doing don't they have any
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:58.760]  respect for privacy they got the point they didn't ever agree that they got
[1:27:58.760 --> 1:28:03.440]  the point but they've kept their hands off the list since then well the point
[1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:07.000]  is who watches the watchman who is big brother to big brother there is no
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:10.760]  oversight and these guys get it's it's like this Federal Reserve situation the
[1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:14.560]  Federal Reserve causes the crash of the economy and then we're going to give them
[1:28:14.560 --> 1:28:20.120]  new sec type powers to oversee themselves and you know I like I said I
[1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:24.920]  just read this one fdic gearing up for bank closures yet they're going to cut
[1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:28.280]  out the banks that aren't playing ball they're going to shut down the good
[1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:32.160]  banks while they can contain their monopoly and we're seeing this over and
[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:37.560]  over and over again in every facet of our lives well we also see when
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:42.440]  socialists make decisions regarding businesses and I didn't want to say
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:48.440]  business decisions because that might imply that they had a business logic we
[1:28:48.440 --> 1:28:53.440]  can see what was done when General Motors recently wanted to locate in a I
[1:28:53.440 --> 1:29:00.680]  forget they was national but a city in Tennessee and the socialist in chief the
[1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:06.720]  new chairman of the board of government motors said no and the reason was because
[1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:12.080]  there wouldn't be union employees in that state and because the carbon
[1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:16.160]  imprint just wouldn't be acceptable in that location well if you look at
[1:29:16.160 --> 1:29:19.880]  Chrysler for instance they're taking this opportunity to distribute it
[1:29:19.880 --> 1:29:23.160]  throughout North America for their little North American Union yes now we're
[1:29:23.160 --> 1:29:26.800]  going to have two plants in Canada and one in Mexico and there's only going to
[1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:30.400]  be four in the United States making seven total but this will make friends

[1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:57.240]  vernacchi last week it's on the website no it's not but you know Congress would
[1:33:57.240 --> 1:34:00.320]  take over and it would just crash the dollar in the economy if we were
[1:34:00.320 --> 1:34:04.880]  audited if we're audited it ends at all so again they are fighting this tooth and
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:09.720]  nail and the media is just zip shut they don't want to talk about it and if
[1:34:09.720 --> 1:34:13.040]  they do talk about it on a rare occasion it's in a negative light let's hit the
[1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:19.760]  clip I have another amendment I have been informed by them that the majority
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:25.760]  plans to block consideration of this amendment which is number 1367 regarding
[1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:30.560]  the transparency at the Federal Reserve I would none nonetheless like to take a
[1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:38.480]  few moments to discuss it if if that is without objection with them thank you the
[1:34:38.480 --> 1:34:43.960]  Federal Reserve the unelected unelected central bank of the United States enjoys
[1:34:43.960 --> 1:34:49.600]  a monopoly over the flow of our money and credit but has never been completely
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:55.360]  transparent and accountable to Congress since its creation in 1913 since
[1:34:55.360 --> 1:35:02.440]  1913 our dollar has lost more than 95% of its purchasing power my amendment is
[1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:06.320]  called the Federal Reserve Sunshine Amendment and it is modeled after
[1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:11.520]  legislation sponsored by Representative Ron Paul of Texas in the House and our
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:16.520]  colleague Senator Sanders of Vermont here in the Senate this amendment amends
[1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:23.640]  section 714 of title 31 of the US code to remove existing restrictions on how
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:28.280]  the government accounting office can audit the Federal Reserve with these
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:34.360]  limitations gone the Fed's discount window operation funding facilities open
[1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:38.880]  market operations in agreements with foreign central banks and governments
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:44.360]  would all be finally open to congressional oversight the government
[1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:49.520]  accounting office would be required to audit the Fed by the end of 2010 and to
[1:35:49.520 --> 1:35:54.840]  report its findings to Congress every dollar created by the Fed has an effect
[1:35:54.840 --> 1:35:59.480]  on the value of the dollars in our pockets in bank accounts we need to pay
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:03.520]  more attention to the effect of Washington decisions whether fiscal
[1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:09.280]  policy made by Congress or monetary policy made by the Fed they all are
[1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:14.680]  ultimately born by the American people the Federal Reserve will create and
[1:36:14.680 --> 1:36:19.520]  disperse trillions of dollars in response to our current financial crisis
[1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:24.680]  Americans across the nation regardless of their opinion on the bailout want to
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:29.400]  know where the money has gone exactly how much has been spent and what
[1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:34.760]  collateral has been taken in return that is why you see so much bipartisan
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:40.000]  support in the House in Bernie Sanders and Jim DeMint being on the same side in
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:45.680]  the Senate inflation is a hidden tax and we unfortunately forget about it too
[1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:50.640]  often when we are debating spending bills here in Congress our fiscal actions
[1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:56.560]  higher deficits increase long-term debt entitlement obligations will
[1:36:56.560 --> 1:37:00.520]  necessarily need to be paid for by printing new money or borrowing more
[1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:06.280]  money from an increasingly skeptical world either option results in higher
[1:37:06.280 --> 1:37:10.600]  interest rates for consumers in a devaluing of the dollars they have
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:15.360]  already earned and saved allowing the Fed to operate our nation's monetary
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:21.680]  system in almost complete secrecy leads to abuse inflation in a lower quality of
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:26.680]  life for every American unfortunately the majority has decided to use a
[1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:31.280]  procedural tactic to block a vote on this amendment by invoking something
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:36.600]  called rule 16 this is a rule that prevents policy being added to spending
[1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:42.520]  bills the majority claims that we do not legislate on appropriation bills of
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:47.160]  course that is false in fact there are already rule 16 violations in the bill
[1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:52.880]  we're trying to amend we also saw this majority airdrop the cash for clunkers
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:57.560]  program into the recent supplemental appropriation bill the majority may
[1:37:57.560 --> 1:38:01.520]  claim that this amendment is not relevant to the underlying bill but in
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:05.320]  fact there are already provisions in this bill related to the government
[1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:09.440]  accounting office audits so this language is quite appropriate on this
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:13.520]  bill the legislation has already received the support of more than one
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:17.520]  half of the House of Representatives within a few short months of its
[1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:23.080]  introduction it's time for the Senate to show its support Mr. President I would
[1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:29.840]  like to ask the majority leader again to allow a vote on amendment 1367 regarding
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:34.280]  a GAO audit of the Federal Reserve
[1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:39.880]  censure from Nebraska all right let's pull it up right now I mean again he's
[1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:43.960]  telling the truth there they are operating in secrecy they do want to shoot
[1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:47.000]  this down he's one of the few senators and again Bernie Sanders is the
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:51.480]  independent you know and he's joining of course as he can see that this is a
[1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:55.400]  false left-right paradigm that the Federal Reserve is outside of government
[1:38:55.400 --> 1:38:59.160]  and that this is a tax on the people through inflation by the way the new
[1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:03.720]  buzzword or buzz terminology that's being used on these 24-hour news work is
[1:39:03.720 --> 1:39:09.400]  second stimulus package we need a second stimulus you know the 15 plus
[1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:13.040]  trillion dollars that they just gave away to the banks isn't enough and they
[1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:18.480]  still say oh it was only 750 billion read the Bloomberg reports understand it's
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:21.800]  much much more and they're gonna do it again they're gonna do it as many times
[1:39:21.800 --> 1:39:26.440]  as they can before they completely abysserate the dollar and this country
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:29.120]  folks all right I'm gonna go to your calls in just a moment but I want to

[1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:43.840]  normal all does it's just a man men are some however they do it they re they're
[1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:50.720]  reclassifying any pocket knife they can open with one hand as it was played yeah
[1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:54.000]  no I know what you're talking about that is a eight out of ten pocket knives will
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:57.760]  be banned and we did report on that like three to four weeks ago you're telling
[1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:01.080]  me it's in its final stages right now it's in the final stages right now you
[1:41:01.080 --> 1:41:06.880]  anyone can go to uh... w w w dot uh... knife rights dot org and break your
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:12.360]  senator the only way they can stop as if they vote to not find it otherwise

[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:19.160]  the old-time book knife is considered switchblade because you can hold it by
[1:41:19.160 --> 1:41:20.760]  the blade and drop it
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:23.720]  and that's called gravity and it's absolutely ridiculous i mean even
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:27.440]  knives i used to cut ropes with i live out in the country folks are now going
[1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:31.760]  to be classified as illegals little three-inch blades are going to be
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:35.840]  classified as illegal go check it out for yourselves is a great world net daily
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:39.640]  article about a month ago about this subject thank you so much let's go to
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:42.640]  mike in chicago mike you're online
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:45.320]  yes and how are you
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:46.920]  uh... i i have
[1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:51.040]  something and i know you guys mention that over the years but people really
[1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:54.840]  you know their short-term memory goes back to monday and that's about it
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:41:58.720]  when we talk about this whole economic collapse one of the things that seems
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:01.680]  to be ignored or at least avoided or or whatnot
[1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:05.760]  uh... is the fact that we would be industrialized on bill clinton's i'm after
[1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:09.680]  yes so i mean if people really want to put this in perspective to see that
[1:42:09.680 --> 1:42:10.880]  this is
[1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:14.800]  by design i mean they are doing this we were the industrialized
[1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:16.000]  under bill clinton
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:20.520]  it wasn't you know well let me say this and further deindustrialized by the
[1:42:20.520 --> 1:42:23.720]  bush administration in two thousand and four when they passed cap to the central
[1:42:23.720 --> 1:42:27.800]  american free trade agreement absolutely absolutely by doing so they cut the whole
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:31.160]  bottom of our economy out and it's just been draining ever since
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:34.680]  i mean it's not that these guys are are any different it's
[1:42:34.680 --> 1:42:37.640]  how is it any different if you're on the left side of a train or the right side
[1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:38.840]  of the train
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:40.680]  if the destination to say
[1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:43.800]  and if i'm going from my home to chicago and you're on the left side of the
[1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:47.120]  train and i'm on the right why there is no difference we're going in the same
[1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:48.760]  direction no matter what
[1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:53.000]  they bring in some issues but the train ever turns there's no intersections we
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:54.520]  don't cross track
[1:42:54.520 --> 1:42:57.640]  we don't go anywhere we go straight ahead and they just keep giving us a
[1:42:57.640 --> 1:43:04.840]  different figure had to blame things on exactly you know it is over again the
[1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:08.840]  last vestige of industry that we had in this country was the car industry and it
[1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:13.640]  is over with it is a publicly gone gutted it is for a north american union at
[1:43:13.640 --> 1:43:18.120]  this point they are they are deindustrializing this country at a rate
[1:43:18.120 --> 1:43:22.040]  that and it's over there's no benefits packages we don't make anything anymore
[1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:25.880]  it's dead it's dead as a door now i thank you for the call and i you know i was
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:28.440]  going through again stuff for the obama deception too
[1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:32.200]  and if you don't have the obama deception yet folks if you don't have a hard
[1:43:32.200 --> 1:43:34.680]  copy now is the time to get one
[1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:38.360]  okay this this movie has been seen by tens of millions of people right now
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:42.120]  waking up people at an alarming rate getting them hip to what the federal
[1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:45.880]  reserve is introducing them to the builder group letting them know what
[1:43:45.880 --> 1:43:49.800]  these climate bills are really about the obama deception such an important film
[1:43:49.800 --> 1:43:53.160]  go to info wars dot com and get it right now but in my research for
[1:43:53.160 --> 1:43:57.160]  obama deception too i'm watching again this gibbs press conference
[1:43:57.160 --> 1:44:00.360]  and one of the reporters is asking him about his
[1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:04.520]  anti illegal immigration stance and he says well you know obama said that he
[1:44:04.520 --> 1:44:07.800]  was going to enforce the rules that were on the books
[1:44:07.800 --> 1:44:10.920]  why isn't he doing that and it's basically he gets blown off in its
[1:44:10.920 --> 1:44:14.680]  politics as usual because he says one thing to get elected
[1:44:14.680 --> 1:44:18.360]  and does another you know he talked about the north american union and putting
[1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:21.720]  a stop to the spp agreements and then dobs had to call him out
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:24.760]  in his first hundred days and say he's done nothing of the sort he's moving
[1:44:24.760 --> 1:44:27.320]  forward with it just like the president before him
[1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:31.000]  and the president before him because this is a globalist
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  agenda has nothing to do with republican or democrat they are controlled
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:39.400]  by the same people we literally do not have elections anymore they are
[1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:44.360]  selections all right let's go to let's see we're on john in california john
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:48.760]  you're on the air oh hi jason good to talk to you
[1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:52.280]  uh... today's show all you just uh... had this is about the second amendment
[1:44:52.280 --> 1:44:55.560]  gun confiscation uh... you just had commercial about front
[1:44:55.560 --> 1:44:59.480]  site you had the uh... the gentleman on from uh... gun owners
[1:44:59.480 --> 1:45:03.320]  die org yep uh... you just talked about the uh...
[1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:05.880]  mayor from newark doing what he's going to do
[1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:10.440]  uh... we know so to my or is coming up next week and let's just stop so to my
[1:45:10.440 --> 1:45:14.440]  or she wrote an entire book called america's deadly obsession
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:17.800]  where she tries to make the argument that the second amendment the second
[1:45:17.800 --> 1:45:22.040]  amendment actually excludes us from having guns and only the military is
[1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:24.280]  supposed to have guns an entire book about it
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:27.640]  i was going to say that i have not heard anything about that book except on
[1:45:27.640 --> 1:45:30.280]  info wars yeah no one else it's it's a total
[1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:34.360]  blackout no one else wants to mention that she's a council member on loraza it
[1:45:34.360 --> 1:45:37.560]  was okay to bring up the believes in grove because most people don't know
[1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:40.760]  what it is and really the only person that took it seriously
[1:45:40.760 --> 1:45:43.960]  was steven colbert and he runs a comedy show let me repeat that steven
[1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:47.400]  colbert the only person to actually report on that legitimately he runs
[1:45:47.400 --> 1:45:50.760]  a comedy show but they don't want to touch the fact that she is a council
[1:45:50.760 --> 1:45:55.320]  member on loraza a group about race a literal racist organization not just
[1:45:55.320 --> 1:45:58.760]  a member a council member on that and they don't want to bring up the fact
[1:45:58.760 --> 1:46:02.440]  that she wrote a book called america's deadly obsession where she wants your
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:06.200]  guns she's a supreme court justice that's what they're trying to prop her up as
[1:46:06.200 --> 1:46:10.520]  she wants your guns go ahead right and this is this is this is the kind of
[1:46:10.520 --> 1:46:12.520]  summary question i'm i'm asking you
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:18.680]  they've given all this uh... what what's your kind of overall take on where
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:22.600]  you think this is headed with a second and like i want to take this front
[1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:26.600]  site course but i'm sitting here thinking
[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:29.720]  you know by the time i get there and i take it
[1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:34.200]  and i get my handgun i'm not gonna have my handgun listen take the course
[1:46:34.200 --> 1:46:37.000]  we gotta fight this thing we can't allow them to have one of their little
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:40.680]  supreme court decisions of five to four in favor of taking guns and that's what
[1:46:40.680 --> 1:46:43.880]  it'll be that's what they're gearing up they're trying to put a total gun grab
[1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:47.640]  around there and once she's in they'll probably make her the spectacle or the
[1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:51.720]  scapegoat of why americans can no longer have guns well so tomorrow came in and
[1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:54.680]  she made such a compelling argument their book was so good and
[1:46:54.680 --> 1:46:59.240]  you know her judgment is just and they'll do it wwe style like they do with
[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:03.160]  all of these bills or all or all these decisions
[1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:07.800]  that you know affect us for instance when they took away our maranda rights and
[1:47:07.800 --> 1:47:12.040]  they did that folks they they basically ruled that you no longer need
[1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:15.720]  a lawyer you no longer need a lawyer present to be interrogated by police
[1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:19.160]  and it can be held up in a courtroom and they can deny you that lawyer
[1:47:19.160 --> 1:47:21.960]  and then they use some double-speak and say well it's not really denial of a
[1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:25.000]  lawyer but it was a five before decision so you'll start seeing it in the
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:27.800]  media and they're not going to keep quiet about it there's going to be
[1:47:27.800 --> 1:47:31.800]  probably some kind of an event where you know well we'll look at the
[1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:36.200]  what was it the uh i forget which school it was that that uh gentleman shot up
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:40.360]  recently like last year and they'll look at this james von bran case
[1:47:40.360 --> 1:47:43.400]  and they're just gonna say you know we can't have guns or we've got to ban the
[1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:47.400]  majority of guns and she's going to be the poster woman for this she's going
[1:47:47.400 --> 1:47:50.760]  to be the figurehead that they point to and say so do my orders in here
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:53.800]  and she's doing the right thing for this country she's taking away the guns we
[1:47:53.800 --> 1:47:56.840]  can't allow it to happen we can't allow that five to four
[1:47:56.840 --> 1:48:00.200]  wwe decision that is in the midst i mean first they have to
[1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:03.160]  actually get her in and i think they're going to have no problem with that i
[1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:06.040]  think she's going to be confirmed i don't see them throwing her out i
[1:48:06.040 --> 1:48:08.680]  can't remember the last time that they actually propped up a supreme court
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:11.800]  justice and didn't allow them in i think roberts was the last one that they
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:15.640]  approved right yes judge and the you know the only
[1:48:15.640 --> 1:48:19.400]  thing that i saw roberts get asked about was that was legitimate was joe
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:22.280]  biden asking him if that he would be for the mandatory
[1:48:22.280 --> 1:48:26.120]  chipping of american citizens and of course he said no but you mark my words
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:29.400]  in 10 to 15 years if it comes down to it he'll vote yes
[1:48:29.400 --> 1:48:32.600]  so you know again we just have to keep battling this stuff just because
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:36.040]  bad legislation and bad supreme court decisions seem to be
[1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:39.080]  on the horizon doesn't mean you shouldn't take that course i should take that
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:43.000]  course i mean i can barely fire a weapon i fired off some shotguns and
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:46.440]  and some uh you know some rifles in my day but i've never actually fired a
[1:48:46.440 --> 1:48:49.160]  pistol and that's something i should learn how to do but then again i'm in
[1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:52.200]  new york there's no way i'm gonna get a conceal and carry permit and the same
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:54.680]  thing in new jersey you know we discussed that with larry pratt it is so
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:58.920]  difficult for you to get a conceal and carry permit in those two places
[1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:01.960]  it's almost impossible i mean you can be a former police officer you can be a
[1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:04.920]  former security guard you can be a former military person
[1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:08.760]  and it's still almost impossible so there's gun restrictions all over the
[1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:10.840]  country and they're going to try to expand on that
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:14.440]  and especially with this gun grabber america's deadly obsession
[1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:18.520]  if you don't believe me go type it in you can buy the book off of amazon i
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:20.200]  thank you for the call we're gonna come back
[1:49:20.200 --> 1:49:23.400]  take even more callers hit up some of these other news stories that we haven't

[1:49:27.640 --> 1:49:31.080]  no kidding it's not even a debate they're having this in the uk now
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:34.520]  that they're also torturing people just like we do in guantanamo bay and we do
[1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:37.960]  it up abu grave well british people do it too you see
[1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:41.400]  they're our main ally on this and they're saying oh no they haven't tortured

[1:49:44.440 --> 1:49:47.880]  of course they do human rights watch this pakistani intelligence officials
[1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:52.360]  have confirmed torture took place with full knowledge of british agents

[1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:11.320]  revamped in the eighties through the cia when they were when they were running
[1:50:11.320 --> 1:50:16.360]  covert programs with islamic militants and osama bin laden
[1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:19.800]  open history folks in fact the president of pakistan

[1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:28.440]  and hannity calls him a nut job well at least hannity played the clip
[1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:31.480]  you know because i didn't see it all over the mainstream media i saw it on one
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:35.320]  area and of course it was poo pooed oh no bin laden would never work with the
[1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:39.480]  united states he openly worked with the united states the bin laden family
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:44.360]  gets tons of military industrial complex contracts the pakistani isi

[1:52:12.920 --> 1:52:18.360]  just as well fun the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama
[1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:21.000]  is working for the best interest of the american people
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:25.480]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election
[1:52:25.480 --> 1:52:29.720]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:52:29.720 --> 1:52:35.720]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:40.600]  that's fascism it's not about left or right it's about a one world government
[1:52:40.600 --> 1:52:45.560]  this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told

[1:53:35.080 --> 1:53:38.440]  possible side effects i find that if you're going to take something that is
[1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:42.440]  you're trading one problem for five or six other problems that to me doesn't
[1:53:42.440 --> 1:53:46.840]  make sense in using something that is natural that is absorbed into the body
[1:53:46.840 --> 1:53:49.800]  particularly because in a liquid form i think is the best way to go

[1:54:25.320 --> 1:54:29.800]  perhaps there's not a better film out there that really exposes the pakistani isi
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:34.680]  working with the cia working with the massage then the film fabled enemies
[1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:38.520]  that i produced last year released in september it really shows the
[1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:43.320]  international intelligence op that was 9-11 it exposes the players
[1:54:43.320 --> 1:54:48.520]  it's got joe biden in it bo dedal uh michael j springman
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:52.680]  who uh again was the head of the visa department in saudi arabia who went
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:57.160]  public and said hey this is a cia front for us to funnel in islamic
[1:54:57.160 --> 1:55:01.960]  militants from all over the region through a covert program with their asset
[1:55:01.960 --> 1:55:05.640]  osama bin laden we also have synthia mckinney in this picture
[1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:09.080]  recently placed in jail by israelis and then released
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:13.240]  fired upon last year by her boat was bumped and fired upon
[1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:16.840]  seven years after 9-11 the supposed mastermind behind the attacks is still
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:20.520]  at large it's almost eight years now folks and the nation is entrenched in
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:23.400]  multiple wars in the middle east not going anywhere this is about a
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:27.000]  eurasian union over there it has been lobbed in the evil behind the attack
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:30.600]  or a mere frontman in a larger picture a bogeyman
[1:55:30.600 --> 1:55:33.400]  we are told we are fighting a war on terror and that the terrorists hate us
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:35.960]  for our freedoms if that is the case why do our
[1:55:35.960 --> 1:55:38.760]  leaders take more and more of those freedoms away
[1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:42.520]  every single day and remember it's only continued
[1:55:42.520 --> 1:55:46.600]  through this obama administration perhaps no better illustration
[1:55:46.600 --> 1:55:50.600]  than saying that bush's retroactive immunity does exist
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:54.280]  and that at nt and all these other telecom companies are allowed to spy on
[1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:57.720]  the american people that's right track trace and database everything you do
[1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:00.840]  on the internet everything you do on your cell phone
[1:56:00.840 --> 1:56:03.960]  and we can't do anything about it that's what people don't understand
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:07.400]  you're already being tapped through everything you do on the web
[1:56:07.400 --> 1:56:10.840]  everything you do on the phone came out a month ago
[1:56:10.840 --> 1:56:14.040]  that your iphone every time it does that little collapsing you know
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:17.480]  how cool your iphone is it does that little collapse it takes a picture and
[1:56:17.480 --> 1:56:21.000]  it puts it into a temporary folder that can be accessed
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:25.160]  via the web or wireless signals that's not science fiction
[1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:28.600]  that's fact folks all right let's continue to go through the calls
[1:56:28.600 --> 1:56:34.680]  dan in washington dan you're online oh hi i was uh just calling the report in
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:37.960]  and i had called the uh mayor's office in newark
[1:56:37.960 --> 1:56:41.560]  and asked how i could get my thousand dollar reward for turning a young
[1:56:41.560 --> 1:56:44.360]  person in and they sent me to the 800 number
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:48.280]  that was busy so i called back again and acted all excited so they put me
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:51.800]  through to one of their representatives and i had a talk
[1:56:51.800 --> 1:56:55.080]  with him and he explained the program and it was really quite alarming
[1:56:55.080 --> 1:57:01.640]  how noxious noxious the program is and what they do is they can
[1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:05.960]  uh basically you turn someone in and if there's a conviction or a crime
[1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:09.960]  they give you a pin number and you go to a bank that they tell you to go to
[1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:13.800]  and you get a reward it's all anonymous there's no repercussions
[1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:18.760]  there's a you can text the report in facts report and you can give it over
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:22.680]  the phone it's really quite amazing how you can go and just give any
[1:57:22.680 --> 1:57:26.920]  information get a pin number and you said text in fact does that mean that they
[1:57:26.920 --> 1:57:30.760]  text or fax you back your confirmation number or do they can you give them an
[1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:33.080]  email or something you don't even have to physically talk to somebody is what
[1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:36.600]  you're telling me so yeah you can text um uh hey
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:41.080]  check both that text side again hang on we have it up online here hang on
[1:57:41.080 --> 1:57:44.840]  sure but but my question is when they when you
[1:57:44.840 --> 1:57:48.040]  talk to these guys are they texting you at back so you physically don't have to
[1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:50.840]  talk to anybody in other words that confirmation code they give you will they
[1:57:50.840 --> 1:57:55.480]  text that back to you as well yeah actually it was uh we had it it was
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:58:01.400]  text to 274 637 and that leads to a company called
[1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:05.080]  tipsoft and you know by the way that this
[1:58:05.080 --> 1:58:08.680]  company isn't doing it for free this is also a private organization that's
[1:58:08.680 --> 1:58:12.280]  going to be benefiting from this as well you know so who's paying for this
[1:58:12.280 --> 1:58:16.120]  it's the taxpayers they can't just give a thousand dollars out for every gun
[1:58:16.120 --> 1:58:19.960]  you know they don't magically have like a bucket of money no that comes from you
[1:58:19.960 --> 1:58:24.040]  you're the reason that they have stasi forces because you're paying your taxes

[2:03:39.880 --> 2:03:43.160]  nice so i'm calling in to report on something i did
[2:03:43.160 --> 2:03:47.640]  i went to a planned parenthood yesterday just to ask them questions about you
[2:03:47.640 --> 2:03:50.840]  know how everything works and to get quote unquote educated
[2:03:50.840 --> 2:03:54.360]  and um they were trying to push like birth control on me and they were saying
[2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:57.560]  that it would be good for me because it would be good for a complexion even
[2:03:57.560 --> 2:04:01.160]  though i have a clear face no pimples and that it would prevent
[2:04:01.160 --> 2:04:05.240]  sys and i was just checking everything out and there was a lot of teenagers in
[2:04:05.240 --> 2:04:09.000]  there and they had like mtv plane and it was just really shocking to me
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:12.520]  well they try to make it as hip and comfortable as possible as they try to
[2:04:12.520 --> 2:04:16.680]  promote eugenics to the youth and you know i remember uh
[2:04:16.680 --> 2:04:19.160]  as a kid actually one of the girls that i saw at this wedding
[2:04:19.160 --> 2:04:22.760]  she was on birth control solely for her complexion
[2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:27.640]  if you will back when she was 14 or 15 years old it's amazing to me
[2:04:27.640 --> 2:04:31.320]  what they will push on young women in this country
[2:04:31.320 --> 2:04:35.160]  yeah so i mean it was just pretty scary to confirm everything i've been hearing
[2:04:35.160 --> 2:04:39.080]  on the show and you know we we are telling the truth here and it is
[2:04:39.080 --> 2:04:42.280]  unfortunate that an organization that tries to parade around
[2:04:42.280 --> 2:04:44.840]  as you know social help for those that need it
[2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:48.040]  are nothing but dirty eugenics and they really are out there
[2:04:48.040 --> 2:04:51.320]  to depopulate this this world that's what this is
[2:04:51.320 --> 2:04:55.160]  it's eugenics it's depopulation it's control we back after this it's the

[2:08:20.200 --> 2:08:26.840]  it's right here alex jones endgame i i can't even go over everything that is
[2:08:26.840 --> 2:08:29.480]  in this picture for the new world order a world
[2:08:29.480 --> 2:08:32.840]  government is just the beginning once in place they can gauge in their plan to
[2:08:32.840 --> 2:08:36.600]  exterminate 80 percent of the world's population while enabling the elites to
[2:08:36.600 --> 2:08:39.800]  live forever with the aid of advanced technology and
[2:08:39.800 --> 2:08:42.760]  there was just a story in mainstream media yesterday about this pill that
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:47.240]  they were giving rats and they were living uh up to nine to 14 percent
[2:08:47.240 --> 2:08:50.680]  longer um life extensions out there
[2:08:50.680 --> 2:08:54.280]  uh it's tough to find on the web but i i've seen
[2:08:54.280 --> 2:08:57.960]  numerous mainstream articles stories papers
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:02.040]  all about life extension technology and i might even disagree a little bit here
[2:09:02.040 --> 2:09:05.800]  first of all we are under the new world order program right now whether we have
[2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:09.800]  full global governance or their apex of what they want
[2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:13.080]  the top of the pyramid whether that's built or not is almost a moot point
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:16.600]  because i don't think that they need that global government to kill 80
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:23.320]  percent of us i mean they have 4.9 billion swine flu vaccines ready to go
[2:09:23.320 --> 2:09:26.920]  and a population that is just so brain dead they're willing to take it
[2:09:26.920 --> 2:09:30.680]  you know again i'm at this wedding and you know the the person that's got
[2:09:30.680 --> 2:09:33.720]  getting married her dad is you know one of the top

[2:09:50.280 --> 2:09:54.440]  a ton of amish people side point all of a sudden i see a golf cart

[2:09:58.920 --> 2:10:01.880]  to the golf cart guy in the golf cart waves back i'm driving so i'm not paying
[2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:04.920]  that much attention like who's that and he's like that's the chief of police
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:08.680]  and i turn over and he's in full uniform he's on duty
[2:10:08.680 --> 2:10:11.400]  and i'm like well what's he doing in a golf cart he's like well he actually

[2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:18.840]  and he's not allowed to operate the police of vehicles anymore
[2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:22.280]  and i'm like i'm blown away i've got my little handy cam
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:25.160]  i decide to tape it because i don't think anybody's going to believe me
[2:10:25.160 --> 2:10:29.320]  so i go to the wedding and i'm uh telling mr k that's what we'll call him
[2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:33.240]  mr k about this and he says he doesn't know anything about it he's on the
[2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:36.360]  board blah blah blah i show him the video tape
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:39.320]  now he's paying attention you know because of you know i'm the crazy guy

[2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:01.720]  it looks like he didn't know about it now mr s
[2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:04.760]  should know about it because he's on the uh... the board and he's a nice enough
[2:11:04.760 --> 2:11:08.280]  guy he's an ex superintendent of the schools who's very good to me as a child
[2:11:08.280 --> 2:11:12.760]  everything else now mr s is all log into the bottom of this
[2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:16.760]  by wedding day by wedding day i was a nut again
[2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:19.480]  because he was riding around supposedly
[2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:24.920]  um... putting out fliers for the july 4th thing for non-parking i didn't see
[2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:28.120]  one flyer in this guy's hand i saw him four separate times while i was there

[2:11:31.640 --> 2:11:36.040]  and they said no there were no dwis and now i'm the crazy guy again
[2:11:36.040 --> 2:11:38.840]  and you know again i heard it from my brother so i wanted to confirm it i go
[2:11:38.840 --> 2:11:43.480]  back to my hometown i get it confirmed by five separate people that he had dwis
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:47.640]  that just shows you the amount of willful willful ignorance and
[2:11:47.640 --> 2:11:51.080]  cover up in a small town he knows this guy has dwis
[2:11:51.080 --> 2:11:54.920]  uh... one of the guys i talked to went to the board meeting and screamed about it
[2:11:54.920 --> 2:11:58.280]  as they kind of just laughed at him uh... it's okay we have a chief of police
[2:11:58.280 --> 2:12:02.440]  that's a drunk now how can a drunk a guy with two dwis
[2:12:02.440 --> 2:12:05.160]  rightfully pull somebody over and do the same to him
[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:10.280]  doesn't make a lot of sense you know i i i mean i i had a great time out there
[2:12:10.280 --> 2:12:16.280]  but just the level of corruption and just the the loops that people are willing
[2:12:16.280 --> 2:12:19.720]  to spin in to make their logic seem correct
[2:12:19.720 --> 2:12:23.960]  okay to make their viewpoint seem right you know another couple of my really
[2:12:23.960 --> 2:12:26.920]  good friends one of them works in the albany plaza
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:30.200]  she works basically with the entire local government there
[2:12:30.200 --> 2:12:34.120]  she works with brian strad this connect to the mayor's wife
[2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:37.160]  who's heavy heavy into the pharmaceutical industry i learned as well yeah
[2:12:37.160 --> 2:12:39.880]  she's gonna love it when we all take those swine flu vaccinations because
[2:12:39.880 --> 2:12:42.040]  they're going to make a buttload of money
[2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:45.480]  anyway i mentioned her i'm like well what about this connect to the mayor
[2:12:45.480 --> 2:12:48.920]  who wanted to declare martial law and get rid of the police department they
[2:12:48.920 --> 2:12:52.280]  acted like they'd never heard of it i had to bring up the article and show them
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:55.240]  and i'm like well can you hook me up with with strad and can you get them on
[2:12:55.240 --> 2:12:58.200]  the program i would love to be a well i really can't do that
[2:12:58.200 --> 2:13:02.920]  you know that might cost me my job and it's just so sad to me
[2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:06.360]  that you know they're willing to live in their little world she's a very good
[2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:09.720]  person lover to death her and her husband are good people
[2:13:09.720 --> 2:13:14.040]  but they still work for the system the husband's a little more informed i mean
[2:13:14.040 --> 2:13:17.240]  he's listening to this program he's listening to
[2:13:17.240 --> 2:13:21.400]  you know other alternative radio he is checking out info wars dot com and
[2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:25.240]  prism planet dot tv for information but at the same time he doesn't get it all
[2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:28.920]  he gets some of it you know for instance we were talking about robotics and this
[2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:32.440]  is something that i wanted to bring up before i go to our next caller we're
[2:13:32.440 --> 2:13:37.880]  going to go to terry rob rick and more in just a moment robot learns to smile
[2:13:37.880 --> 2:13:41.640]  and frown it's right here for prism planet dot tv and yes that is
[2:13:41.640 --> 2:13:46.360]  albert einstein right here i've been harping on the robo penguin which by
[2:13:46.360 --> 2:13:49.560]  the way i i brought up at the wedding it didn't exist i had to show a video of it
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:52.760]  and even when i showed the video of it you sure that's not cg i'm like no that
[2:13:52.760 --> 2:13:57.240]  is really the robo penguin from festo look they have a stingray
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:14:03.000]  look i i showed them the robo fish the carp technology ai it's here robot
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:06.520]  learns to smile and frown a hyper realistic
[2:14:06.520 --> 2:14:09.960]  einstein robot at the university of california sandiego
[2:14:09.960 --> 2:14:13.800]  has learned to smile and make facial expressions
[2:14:13.800 --> 2:14:19.640]  through a process of self guided self guided learning the uc sandiego
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:23.480]  researchers used machine learning to empower the robots to learn and make
[2:14:23.480 --> 2:14:27.640]  more realistic facial expressions as far as we know no other research group
[2:14:27.640 --> 2:14:30.920]  has used machine learning to teach a robot to make realistic facial
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:34.200]  expressions now there is hands and robotics out here in austin texas
[2:14:34.200 --> 2:14:38.280]  actually while they're doing a similar program i don't know if it's as far
[2:14:38.280 --> 2:14:41.320]  advanced as this
[2:14:41.320 --> 2:14:47.480]  however and they have a built philip k dick the science fiction author and
[2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:50.920]  they're trying to make him more hyper realistic it looks incredible
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:54.520]  you can type joey chaos into youtube and you can watch this as well
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:14:58.360]  and when joey chaos can't answer a question for example he can answer a
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:01.080]  lot of questions but i think they ask me about mcdonald's
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:04.680]  and he doesn't know much about mcdonald's so he says well
[2:15:04.680 --> 2:15:08.840]  although we are not as advanced as the robots in blade runner
[2:15:08.840 --> 2:15:12.760]  if you look at the 70s a super computer filled up an entire room
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:16.360]  and that same amount of processing power is now available
[2:15:16.360 --> 2:15:19.720]  in something that is handheld makes a great point there
[2:15:19.720 --> 2:15:23.800]  so he's saying look i may be in the first stages of being
[2:15:23.800 --> 2:15:28.280]  an artificially intelligent android but give me 10 years and wait till you see
[2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:31.640]  how advanced we are and this is the public stuff so
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:35.080]  you know i i just like to keep keep people in the loop about technology
[2:15:35.080 --> 2:15:39.160]  especially when this technology is being used for warfare
[2:15:39.160 --> 2:15:44.600]  we've got the ripsaw which is a tank that has a 25 caliber weapon on it
[2:15:44.600 --> 2:15:49.720]  we have the xm 25 which is a gun for soldiers let me say this again a gun
[2:15:49.720 --> 2:15:53.720]  for soldiers that has a microchip in every single bullet
[2:15:53.720 --> 2:15:58.520]  and they can see through walls okay this is just like the eraser
[2:15:58.520 --> 2:16:01.960]  with Arnold Schwarzenegger a movie that came out 15 years ago
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:05.320]  they can see through walls they have a heat signature on their target
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:09.960]  they then can shoot around buildings or through buildings because it's guided
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:13.800]  by microchip technology and then this 25 caliber weapon
[2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:19.160]  after it hones in on its target explodes within three meters of the target
[2:16:19.160 --> 2:16:22.440]  killing everybody around and that's what's available today
[2:16:22.440 --> 2:16:25.880]  in the public eye let's not forget the story just last week
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:28.760]  where they had to admit that hitler had a stealth bomber
[2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:32.280]  i know all of you out there think that stealth technology was something
[2:16:32.280 --> 2:16:35.960]  that just came into being in the late 80s early 90s and we saw it
[2:16:35.960 --> 2:16:43.000]  in the first gulf war no hitler had one and it just came out a week ago
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:47.240]  you don't think that they can hide things you don't think that it's compartmentalized
[2:16:47.240 --> 2:16:50.920]  you don't think secrets are kept you got another thing common folks
[2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:55.240]  just type it in hitler stealth bomb did an entire history channel special on it
[2:16:55.240 --> 2:16:59.720]  we took that from the nazis that's how crazy things are and they're showing
[2:16:59.720 --> 2:17:04.600]  you smiling robots in the public eye can you imagine
[2:17:04.600 --> 2:17:07.960]  what are in the depths of the underground bases at u.s military
[2:17:07.960 --> 2:17:11.800]  facilities can you imagine what raytheon lockheed maron and all these
[2:17:11.800 --> 2:17:15.240]  other military industrial goons are really working on
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:19.640]  it's almost beyond imagination and a couple of these
[2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:25.160]  uh uavs and uh ground vehicles if you will are now being controlled by
[2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:30.280]  literal xbox controllers they're trying to get human beings
[2:17:30.280 --> 2:17:34.120]  to disassociate themselves with the enemy dehumanize the enemy
[2:17:34.120 --> 2:17:37.960]  to a screen where they take an xbox controller
[2:17:37.960 --> 2:17:44.680]  and actually carry out executions again this is reality this is now all right
[2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:48.920]  let's take some callers let's go to terry in indiana terry online
[2:17:48.920 --> 2:17:53.000]  hey jesson thanks for taking my call great job you guys are doing
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:56.600]  i have a couple of quick comments and then i have a question for you
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:01.640]  sure uh my comments are my first one is um i don't know what's wrong with the
[2:18:01.640 --> 2:18:05.240]  american people uh i mean you can you can see any
[2:18:05.240 --> 2:18:10.200]  type of article anywhere uh online and go to the comment section
[2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:14.040]  and they're going back and forth you know the left right thing
[2:18:14.040 --> 2:18:18.600]  as usual and you can interject in there talk about the cf for our trilateral
[2:18:18.600 --> 2:18:22.760]  commission uh everything give them references leave links
[2:18:22.760 --> 2:18:26.840]  and they'll just ignore you and just keep on arguing with one another
[2:18:26.840 --> 2:18:29.880]  it's it's amazing the brainwashing that's been gone
[2:18:29.880 --> 2:18:34.280]  that's going on in this country and and the fellow african-americans
[2:18:34.280 --> 2:18:41.240]  oh i we're almost hopeless i mean it's like obama has just
[2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:46.040]  i don't know what he's done to them he can do no wrong he's a savior
[2:18:46.040 --> 2:18:49.320]  it's repulsive well let me say this man they're using
[2:18:49.320 --> 2:18:54.360]  they're using obama right now and his image in the african-american and minority
[2:18:54.360 --> 2:18:57.880]  communities to try to promote this city year whereas hitler
[2:18:57.880 --> 2:19:01.080]  you know went after the youth that was blonde haired and blue eyed
[2:19:01.080 --> 2:19:04.520]  obama and his administration really it's the globalist the globalists have
[2:19:04.520 --> 2:19:08.200]  decided to harness the power of minorities and those who are poor and
[2:19:08.200 --> 2:19:11.000]  african-americans if you watch these city year commercials
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:15.400]  most of them are minority kids and sometimes they blatantly say in fact
[2:19:15.400 --> 2:19:18.440]  we may have to pull it up and play it in the program that if you're a person of
[2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:21.160]  color how could you not join city year
[2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:24.200]  i mean i i i'm sitting there my jaw on the floor
[2:19:24.200 --> 2:19:27.800]  as this young african-american kid is saying if you're a person of color you
[2:19:27.800 --> 2:19:33.240]  need to join city year i mean oh my god listen i'm gonna hold you over terry i'm

[2:22:15.480 --> 2:22:19.720]  deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the best
[2:22:19.720 --> 2:22:23.400]  interest of the american people while obama's already fudging
[2:22:23.400 --> 2:22:27.960]  yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical

[2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:52.040]  these guys out of office or something because i mean we can't have taxation
[2:24:52.040 --> 2:24:54.840]  without representation how are they representing us
[2:24:54.840 --> 2:24:58.040]  if they're not even reading the bills that they're they're passing
[2:24:58.040 --> 2:25:01.720]  well i agree with you it's just so corrupt now how do you stop the leviathan
[2:25:01.720 --> 2:25:05.480]  how do you stop the monster is there a candidate that you can get behind is
[2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:08.840]  there a candidate that can run and win i mean if you look at somebody who had
[2:25:08.840 --> 2:25:12.520]  the most written name recognition out of any non-political figure
[2:25:12.520 --> 2:25:16.680]  it was cindy shehan and she ran up against uh nancy polosi and the media
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:20.600]  just totally stopped covering her acted like she didn't exist didn't mention her
[2:25:20.600 --> 2:25:24.440]  run for congress she was still able to get just under 20 percent but not able
[2:25:24.440 --> 2:25:27.800]  to win so the real question is can we hold them accountable
[2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:31.160]  this is taxation without representation and to me it was encouraging
[2:25:31.160 --> 2:25:35.560]  watching uh bainer john bainer on a c span earlier talking
[2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:39.400]  about how he fell asleep on a plane and the entire crew had signed a letter to
[2:25:39.400 --> 2:25:41.720]  him encouraging him to keep fighting this health
[2:25:41.720 --> 2:25:45.320]  care bill and again how is it that we can pass a bill
[2:25:45.320 --> 2:25:51.960]  that has 300 pages added to it at 3 a.m before it goes before the house and
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:56.920]  then they can't provide a physical copy of the bill for them to read
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:00.040]  before they actually vote on it it's high treason and i couldn't agree more
[2:26:00.040 --> 2:26:05.640]  thank you very much terry let's go to rob in texas rob you're online
[2:26:05.640 --> 2:26:09.400]  yes afternoon jason how are you all pretty good
[2:26:09.400 --> 2:26:14.280]  i'd like to discuss the gun control initiatives please do one of the one of
[2:26:14.280 --> 2:26:16.840]  the things that i've noticed um
[2:26:16.840 --> 2:26:22.120]  minneapolis i lived up to minnesota for 14 years before i moved back to texas
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:28.040]  and i had a my carry permit up there and their murder rates in minneapolis
[2:26:28.040 --> 2:26:31.400]  were at an all-time high they even had the name murder
[2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:36.360] apolis at one point and i was just reading a couple weeks ago
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:41.880]  that there had been a total of five maybe six murders in minneapolis this year
[2:26:41.880 --> 2:26:45.000]  that's not so bad i mean it's not the best thing in the world but five or six
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  isn't isn't that bad no it's great compared to their old
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:55.400]  numbers by this by mid-summer 2003 2004 they had 90
[2:26:55.400 --> 2:27:00.280]  some odd murders wow and i can't help but think that the
[2:27:00.280 --> 2:27:04.280]  63 000 carry permits that have been issued up there
[2:27:04.280 --> 2:27:08.120]  has something to do with that i would have to agree 110 percent and i remember
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:11.800]  you know watching dateline um as a youngster probably about 10 years ago
[2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:14.280]  when jesse ventura was in the governorship and they were trying to
[2:27:14.280 --> 2:27:17.320]  demonize him for having a concealed weapon on his
[2:27:17.320 --> 2:27:20.200]  persons meanwhile the guy is an ex navy seal
[2:27:20.200 --> 2:27:25.240]  who would be more qualified to carry a concealed weapon
[2:27:25.240 --> 2:27:30.120]  than the governor of the state who is an ex navy seal and they were trying to
[2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:33.960]  take away his gun i mean it is unbelievable
[2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:40.280]  how people will do mental gymnastics to try to demonize the second amendment
[2:27:40.280 --> 2:27:43.640]  i don't understand it it's just beyond comprehension
[2:27:43.640 --> 2:27:48.120]  um i'll tell you what it is it's the powers that being know that an armed
[2:27:48.120 --> 2:27:51.880]  populace is a dangerous populace when you're trying to impose tyranny so
[2:27:51.880 --> 2:27:55.880]  they're trying to get those guns out of our hands before they go full force

[2:34:02.600 --> 2:34:05.640]  much mindless sports talk that i had to go through

[2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:27.480]  it or have some kind of a loony theory where you want to just you know
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:30.840]  eviscerate an entire ethnic group because that's what it comes down to when
[2:34:30.840 --> 2:34:34.040]  you hear callers like the previous one and it's just
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:37.640]  disgusting to me let's go back to jim in washington jim you
[2:34:37.640 --> 2:34:41.160]  said you had an idea yeah well i thought there might be a
[2:34:41.160 --> 2:34:44.920]  a double whammy way to get alexa a little bit of much
[2:34:44.920 --> 2:34:48.840]  much needed vacation time and to bring in a little mind info wars dot com and i
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:52.680]  kind of got the idea from uh... all the uh... frontside advertising and what
[2:34:52.680 --> 2:34:56.440]  you guys did with that ebay auction for the attorney crusher one i thought it
[2:34:56.440 --> 2:34:57.400]  might be
[2:34:57.400 --> 2:35:01.160]  uh... an interesting thing if you guys could set up an ebay auction to do like
[2:35:01.160 --> 2:35:04.920]  a day at the range with alex jones at frontside or something like that maybe
[2:35:04.920 --> 2:35:09.400]  they either a week you know i don't know if uh... alex jones would be down
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:12.840]  with uh... being around guns in a fan that paid to be there but
[2:35:12.840 --> 2:35:17.640]  you know that's not a bad that's that's not that's not necessarily a bad idea
[2:35:17.640 --> 2:35:20.600]  maybe we could have a dinner with alex jones it really be up to alex i mean
[2:35:20.600 --> 2:35:25.320]  alex is is really kind of an introvert when it comes down to it a i have to
[2:35:25.320 --> 2:35:28.680]  beg to drag him out to a ufc event or to
[2:35:28.680 --> 2:35:31.800]  you know a bar from hanging out with my buddies and it's it's a rare occasion i
[2:35:31.800 --> 2:35:32.920]  mean i do work here
[2:35:32.920 --> 2:35:36.680]  seven days a week in fact i got a little itchy just being back in new york for
[2:35:36.680 --> 2:35:40.280]  five days and not being in the office i mean i come here on weekends man this
[2:35:40.280 --> 2:35:43.400]  is my home and i don't know if he would go over something like that but i do
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:46.280]  think that's a good idea i think somebody would pay up to five to ten
[2:35:46.280 --> 2:35:50.200]  grand to hang out with alex jones for a day but i mean look how often he takes
[2:35:50.200 --> 2:35:52.760]  off i mean i think the last time i subbed in for the show
[2:35:52.760 --> 2:35:57.080]  was probably over a month ago and he'll be back tomorrow he's just taking this
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:36:00.600]  day off to spend some time with his kids some much deserved time
[2:36:00.600 --> 2:36:03.880]  and i gotta tell you you know i i got to hang out with my little niece
[2:36:03.880 --> 2:36:08.040]  and uh... she's four years old right now and it was just a i needed it
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:11.400]  it was so nice to spend a day with a toddler that loves you
[2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:14.520]  and uh... i can understand why he's take that time off i don't know if he'd be
[2:36:14.520 --> 2:36:16.520]  taking it off to make a profit because oh
[2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:19.960]  well god forbid we make a profit here we try to turn around
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:24.040]  you know we just i think we made it official and we did get the area next
[2:36:24.040 --> 2:36:27.560]  door and we are going to be working on building a tv studio there so hopefully
[2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:31.000]  within the next six to twelve months we have yet another program for people to
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:35.960]  watch maybe uh... a weekend and more news type program a different type of format
[2:36:35.960 --> 2:36:39.640]  than this actually anchors sitting there in the background you'll see the news
[2:36:39.640 --> 2:36:43.000]  story and will play the clips from there and wear a suit you know i won't be
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:47.080]  rocking my affliction t-shirts and really try to bring it to the next level
[2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:50.840]  so i think that is a good idea and i'll pass along anything else
[2:36:50.840 --> 2:36:54.680]  oh nothing i just heard him uh... talking about how he would reminisce
[2:36:54.680 --> 2:36:58.200]  about uh... shooting and losing his losing his edge and how he kind of
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:37:01.080]  wanted to get back into it and how he just started the uh... the new ad
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:04.440]  campaigns with the front side guys and i just thought it'd be a good good way
[2:37:04.440 --> 2:37:06.600]  for him to get a little trigger time
[2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:09.320]  all right jim i thank you for the call there's a great video out there of
[2:37:09.320 --> 2:37:12.440]  alex shooting one of these little p-shooter shotguns when the dick
[2:37:12.440 --> 2:37:15.960]  cheney incident happened and that was the first time that i'd ever seen alex
[2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:19.320]  jones i think the first and only time i had seen alex jones actually fire a
[2:37:19.320 --> 2:37:21.720]  weapon and if you haven't seen that that was a big hit
[2:37:21.720 --> 2:37:25.800]  on youtube i think it happened like three two or three years ago when that
[2:37:25.800 --> 2:37:31.720]  story was big let's go to david in florida david you're online
[2:37:31.720 --> 2:37:35.640]  i think it's great show today thank you well one thing i wanted to mention
[2:37:35.640 --> 2:37:39.640]  uh... and i haven't heard on your show and kind of perplexed as why not but
[2:37:39.640 --> 2:37:43.880]  uh... there's a budo and a david frost interview
[2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:49.080]  uh... we've played it happened right before her death on december 27 2007
[2:37:49.080 --> 2:37:53.240]  she mentions in that just sort of haphazardly that oh yeah by the way
[2:37:53.240 --> 2:37:56.440]  that's when that's when bin laden died well let me take it let me take it a
[2:37:56.440 --> 2:38:00.040]  step further she doesn't just mention that bin laden died she mentions that
[2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:03.080]  bin laden was murdered and we have played that not only on the i played on the
[2:38:03.080 --> 2:38:06.200]  alex jones show sitting in that played it probably half a dozen times
[2:38:06.200 --> 2:38:10.680]  on my program the info warrior but she mentions that the guy that killed him
[2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:14.200]  is a man named omar sayid shake now who is
[2:38:14.200 --> 2:38:17.560]  omar sayid shake let's take it back a second this is the guy that was
[2:38:17.560 --> 2:38:20.920]  supposedly responsible for the daniel pearl murder
[2:38:20.920 --> 2:38:24.200]  the guy who cut off daniel pearls head now what was daniel pearl in the middle
[2:38:24.200 --> 2:38:28.120]  east doing well he was trying to find out the funding of these quote unquote
[2:38:28.120 --> 2:38:31.880]  radical islamic groups that funded nine eleven
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:36.040]  now the other interesting thing about omar sayid shake the supposed murderer
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:38.600]  of bin laden and the supposed murderer of daniel pearl
[2:38:38.600 --> 2:38:43.480]  is that he was on an isi payroll and was a multiple intelligence agent he wasn't
[2:38:43.480 --> 2:38:47.560]  just working for the isi in fact he funneled a hundred thousand dollars
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:51.560]  uh... through general mahmoud Ahmed the then head of the isi
[2:38:51.560 --> 2:38:55.880]  to muhammad adha just before the attacks but nobody wants to talk about that
[2:38:55.880 --> 2:38:58.600]  isn't that weird it's very strange
[2:38:58.600 --> 2:39:03.400]  yeah it's very strange i'm funny too is up really regarding that last
[2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:05.960]  call that was uh... racial
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:07.320]  uh...
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:10.520]  it's very funny that there's five hundred forty five people basically in
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:13.560]  washington call the shot they just got an email this today
[2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:15.560]  versus three hundred million
[2:39:15.560 --> 2:39:17.400]  if you look at it the
[2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:20.360]  you know cuz you look at the the two houses of congress and then uh... you
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:23.400]  know the congress the senate and uh... the judges raise five hundred forty five
[2:39:23.400 --> 2:39:27.160]  people versus but i also think it's even more than that i'm not saying it's
[2:39:27.160 --> 2:39:30.120]  relative to the three hundred million people but the state senators actually
[2:39:30.120 --> 2:39:31.240]  do get a lot done and
[2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:33.920]  i mean that's where barack obama was spawned from was the state senate
[2:39:33.920 --> 2:39:34.720]  remember he gave
[2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:37.880]  a keynote address at the two thousand and four democratic
[2:39:37.880 --> 2:39:41.000]  uh... national convention without actually being a real senator he was a
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:42.240]  state senator which is
[2:39:42.240 --> 2:39:45.440]  kinda on the level playing field as a congressman but continue
[2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:46.160]  uh...
[2:39:46.160 --> 2:39:47.400]  the thing is that
[2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:50.320]  evil intention people organize
[2:39:50.320 --> 2:39:53.920]  and what we're doing here i mean you you provide a great service of a great
[2:39:53.920 --> 2:39:56.520]  program of informing people but i think
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:01.160]  what needs to occur is the next step where we actually organize more
[2:40:01.160 --> 2:40:04.440]  and actually go and take our country back i mean one of the things that we
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:07.480]  will keep here is the is the complacency or the
[2:40:07.480 --> 2:40:10.280]  low intellectual capacity the americans actually
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:14.600]  confront evil which i think is a bigger bigger part in the intellectual side of
[2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:15.080]  it
[2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:16.040]  uh...
[2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:19.560]  we need to actually confront the evil and organize you know do that by
[2:40:19.560 --> 2:40:24.080]  organizing more i think what we have to do is we have to support organizations
[2:40:24.080 --> 2:40:28.440]  uh... like campaign for liberty by running for for office and whether that be
[2:40:28.440 --> 2:40:30.520]  city councilman or local mayor
[2:40:30.520 --> 2:40:33.560]  or congressman or state senator like i just discussed
[2:40:33.560 --> 2:40:36.280]  and if you can't run for office support the person
[2:40:36.280 --> 2:40:39.360]  that can that listen they're in fear of ron paul
[2:40:39.360 --> 2:40:42.400]  and campaign for liberty even though ron paul we played a clip earlier says
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:45.240]  that the american people get the government that they deserve one
[2:40:45.240 --> 2:40:46.280]  fortunately
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:48.800]  eighty ninety percent of the american people don't even know what the three
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:52.280]  branches of government are and aren't interested in the government whatsoever
[2:40:52.280 --> 2:40:53.680]  and then that ten percent
[2:40:53.680 --> 2:40:55.240]  that kind of ten to twenty percent
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:40:58.920]  that kind of play spectator sports with it with government half of them are
[2:40:58.920 --> 2:41:03.320]  still stuck in this left right paradigm so we have to break through
[2:41:03.320 --> 2:41:06.760]  i saw something great while i was in new york it was the wednesday house of
[2:41:06.760 --> 2:41:08.240]  commons and i thank you for the call
[2:41:08.240 --> 2:41:10.400]  where gordon brown
[2:41:10.400 --> 2:41:11.400]  and cameron
[2:41:11.400 --> 2:41:16.440]  are like wwe fighting if you've never seen a house of commons it's here and
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:19.200]  they actually get to ask each other questions and people cheer
[2:41:19.200 --> 2:41:20.880]  it's almost
[2:41:20.880 --> 2:41:24.480]  a cool thing in the fact that they have to respond to all their constituents
[2:41:24.480 --> 2:41:27.160]  whether it's fake or not or whether it's scripted or not
[2:41:27.160 --> 2:41:30.920]  so they're throwing out insult after insult on each other but they're not
[2:41:30.920 --> 2:41:34.840]  talking about the policies whatsoever they're just saying that their policy is
[2:41:34.840 --> 2:41:35.640]  bad
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:39.440]  my policy is good your policy is bad
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:40.840]  my policy is good
[2:41:40.840 --> 2:41:44.320]  so there's a third party now it's called the liberal democrats
[2:41:44.320 --> 2:41:47.560]  and finally uh... the head of liberal democrats it's a very small party gets
[2:41:47.560 --> 2:41:51.320]  to stand up and say his piece and what does he say he says well perhaps the
[2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:54.520]  reason that you guys are throwing insults at one another
[2:41:54.520 --> 2:41:56.560]  fighting like
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:41:57.520]  just
[2:41:57.520 --> 2:42:00.120]  nonsensically not talking about the topics
[2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:03.600]  is the fact that you guys are in on it together and he says why don't you go
[2:42:03.600 --> 2:42:05.720]  take another cruise together
[2:42:05.720 --> 2:42:08.320]  and i'm just like wow that is top-notch we got
[2:42:08.320 --> 2:42:11.200]  we gotta find that clip i don't think it's on the youtube yet it was from
[2:42:11.200 --> 2:42:13.680]  last week's house of commons like i said
[2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:17.600]  it means that we need to do a story on it on prison planet and uh... info wars
[2:42:17.600 --> 2:42:18.320]  because
[2:42:18.320 --> 2:42:21.280]  in that session again it should have been reported all over it wasn't and you
[2:42:21.280 --> 2:42:24.840]  know i went to the guardian i went to the telegraph i tried to see any story on
[2:42:24.840 --> 2:42:28.200]  it they just want to make it appear as though it didn't happen
[2:42:28.200 --> 2:42:31.080]  they don't want you to know that they're in on together that they take cruises
[2:42:31.080 --> 2:42:31.800]  together
[2:42:31.800 --> 2:42:35.280]  that they're good friends behind the scenes that the establishment runs
[2:42:35.280 --> 2:42:35.920]  both
[2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:36.760]  puppets
[2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:37.960]  that's the real deal
[2:42:37.960 --> 2:42:42.640]  anti-federalist in georgia you are on the line sir
[2:42:42.640 --> 2:42:45.240]  you're going to be missing a late night
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:47.120]  uh... thanks man appreciate it
[2:42:47.120 --> 2:42:49.040]  uh... when
[2:42:49.040 --> 2:42:53.040]  uh... like i was telling the other other uh... caller i will be back for a
[2:42:53.040 --> 2:42:58.040]  weekly show a wrap-up show after alex's show from six to nine central time
[2:42:58.040 --> 2:43:01.520]  and uh... hopefully after i get done with invisible empire i will be returning
[2:43:01.520 --> 2:43:02.520]  to five nights
[2:43:02.520 --> 2:43:06.080]  a week i gotta tell you it's really been a blessing in disguise for me because
[2:43:06.080 --> 2:43:09.160]  i was able to finalize the first third of my script i mean i have a rough
[2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:12.480]  outline i obviously have all the clips i've been doing all the research but to
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:14.600]  finalize a third of my script
[2:43:14.600 --> 2:43:17.840]  and really only have two-thirds of my script to finalize to go
[2:43:17.840 --> 2:43:20.880]  is just not you know this is a process for me
[2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:23.600]  and the last movie i don't get as much help
[2:43:23.600 --> 2:43:26.640]  essay and alex jones i work in the office you know alex has
[2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:30.000]  two video editors that are working for him and milling through stuff i have to
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:31.720]  do all that stuff myself
[2:43:31.720 --> 2:43:34.880]  so you know in order to step back and i mean i can't even tell you i come in
[2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:35.800]  here early
[2:43:35.800 --> 2:43:39.480]  uh... usually around the beginning of the alex jones show i used to try help
[2:43:39.480 --> 2:43:42.520]  to help produce that because i was also producing my own radio show so it was
[2:43:42.520 --> 2:43:43.920]  advantageous for me
[2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:45.400]  to go through routers
[2:43:45.400 --> 2:43:49.720]  the guardian the telegraph msnbc fox news all that and get my stories ready
[2:43:49.720 --> 2:43:50.760]  for my show
[2:43:50.760 --> 2:43:53.600]  that was coming up and i would give alex all the pertinent stories that i
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:55.040]  thought that he would want to cover
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:43:57.560]  so then i would also leave in the middle of the day
[2:43:57.560 --> 2:44:01.880]  go back let my dogs out come back and i would only get here a couple hours
[2:44:01.880 --> 2:44:04.880]  uh... before my show and sometimes there'd be such breaking news i'd have
[2:44:04.880 --> 2:44:07.880]  to go to the news wires instead of working on my film so i was kind of
[2:44:07.880 --> 2:44:10.640]  falling behind and now i'm just full force
[2:44:10.640 --> 2:44:13.600]  totally ready to go can't wait to finalize the second two-thirds of the
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:15.120]  script i have time to
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:18.640]  take off and do interviews for my film i'll be doing that and
[2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:21.120]  think a week and a half i think i take off from the nineteenth
[2:44:21.120 --> 2:44:24.000]  to the uh... twenty six though ten days from now on spending a week in
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:24.960]  california
[2:44:24.960 --> 2:44:28.640]  and i will be back after the release of invisible empire five nights a week so
[2:44:28.640 --> 2:44:30.200]  you can be assured
[2:44:30.200 --> 2:44:33.640]  cool cool i'm uh... can't wait to see it i got a couple issues i want to talk
[2:44:33.640 --> 2:44:34.600]  about today
[2:44:34.600 --> 2:44:35.680]  sure
[2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:39.240]  the first to download here if anybody seen this last week's episode of the
[2:44:39.240 --> 2:44:41.800]  tv show called well wars
[2:44:41.800 --> 2:44:43.880]  now but uh...
[2:44:43.880 --> 2:44:45.200]  though uh...
[2:44:45.200 --> 2:44:47.640]  it's interesting that uh...
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:51.920]  when the captain ends up getting shot in this episode by a
[2:44:51.920 --> 2:44:54.000]  japanese wailing boat
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:55.840]  and what we've got the claim
[2:44:55.840 --> 2:44:58.680]  and uh... but the interesting part about it was there was a woman on the
[2:44:58.680 --> 2:45:01.680]  ship who had been injured and they handed her a list
[2:45:01.680 --> 2:45:04.680]  and the list at thirty three things to do
[2:45:04.680 --> 2:45:07.480]  uh... i think the ship that they're on is called the steve irwin while you're
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:09.280]  on the steve irwin
[2:45:09.280 --> 2:45:13.080]  and i can't remember thirty why thirty three and i looked into out the green
[2:45:13.080 --> 2:45:15.520]  text mars lately so i'm a little
[2:45:15.520 --> 2:45:18.120]  inundated with his symbolism and uh...
[2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:20.600]  i thought well there that number comes again these guys are on the black
[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:22.880]  pirate ship they're all dressed in plaque
[2:45:22.880 --> 2:45:25.680]  they're claiming to be environmentalist god knows that they're open the wheels
[2:45:25.680 --> 2:45:26.500]  or not
[2:45:26.500 --> 2:45:30.080]  and sure enough this guy hands her a sheet with thirty three on it and i thought
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:33.160]  it was a met interesting how do you think he's a sonic i mean is he openly
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:35.520]  wearing mason pins and things like that
[2:45:35.520 --> 2:45:37.720]  uh... he's not openly wearing
[2:45:37.720 --> 2:45:41.600]  uh... but you know why thirty three why not thirty one why not thirty four why
[2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:45.080]  not ten things to do while you're on the boat you know i hear you man and it is
[2:45:45.080 --> 2:45:47.960]  interesting but you know one of the things that i was doing uh...
[2:45:47.960 --> 2:45:48.960]  for my movie
[2:45:48.960 --> 2:45:53.480]  is uh... the last third really does into the secret societies and that aspect of
[2:45:53.480 --> 2:45:55.280]  a bohemian grove and beyond
[2:45:55.280 --> 2:45:58.560]  so i decided to pick up one of the books that we carry here at info wars it's
[2:45:58.560 --> 2:46:00.240]  called proofs of the conspiracy
[2:46:00.240 --> 2:46:03.720]  and this is an insider from the late seventeen hundreds who
[2:46:03.720 --> 2:46:07.000]  you know is totally pro-mason i mean he loves the masons
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:10.760]  and he is on up on apologetic about that but he shows the different sex
[2:46:10.760 --> 2:46:12.480]  and schools of masonry
[2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:15.680]  and all all this stuff how it's spread throughout europe and then he gets into
[2:46:15.680 --> 2:46:18.120]  the illuminati again as an insider
[2:46:18.120 --> 2:46:21.280]  and how they would recruit people on how this organization actually came into
[2:46:21.280 --> 2:46:21.920]  being
[2:46:21.920 --> 2:46:24.560]  and i can't tell you how vital this book has been
[2:46:24.560 --> 2:46:28.400]  i'm only about uh... one-third to one-four through and i'm just highlighting
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:29.000]  stuff
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:32.600]  then i may or may not use for the picture but i encourage people to go check
[2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:35.800]  that out because i have some really good friends that are masons
[2:46:35.800 --> 2:46:38.320]  and you know i obviously inundated them
[2:46:38.320 --> 2:46:42.600]  with my opinions on masonry and secret societies before they joined
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:44.240]  but they ended up joining anyway
[2:46:44.240 --> 2:46:46.920]  and i don't think that they're bad people because of it and i don't think
[2:46:46.920 --> 2:46:47.560]  that they're
[2:46:47.560 --> 2:46:50.600]  you know working for somebody and now they're going to betray me because i i
[2:46:50.600 --> 2:46:52.160]  don't necessarily agree with
[2:46:52.160 --> 2:46:53.880]  you know what the masons do so i would
[2:46:53.880 --> 2:46:57.120]  i would suggest go check out proofs of conspiracy because it is a first-hand
[2:46:57.120 --> 2:47:00.080]  account it's not a second or third-hand account or somebody doing
[2:47:00.080 --> 2:47:04.080]  you know studies of other masons as an actual mason it's a little bit tough to
[2:47:04.080 --> 2:47:06.240]  read because a lot of it's in old english
[2:47:06.240 --> 2:47:10.000]  but it is just an excellent book proofs of conspiracy go check it out at info
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:11.040]  wars dot com
[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:15.880]  right now i thank you for the call mat in california mat you're online
[2:47:15.880 --> 2:47:20.360]  yes that they don't have a big family i'm a big fan of your show
[2:47:20.360 --> 2:47:22.640]  how are the talk about uh...
[2:47:22.640 --> 2:47:25.280]  we're talking about before about robot
[2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:26.480]  and uh...
[2:47:26.480 --> 2:47:28.720]  i'm going to get into that
[2:47:28.720 --> 2:47:32.320]  the japanese really uh... they are way way ahead
[2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:35.400]  of anything
[2:47:35.400 --> 2:47:37.560]  they've shown the media over here
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:40.120]  uh... if you guys have heard of the uh...
[2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:43.440]  uh... robot suit that they've developed and uh... i think they're going to be
[2:47:43.440 --> 2:47:44.720]  kind of pushing this
[2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:47.240]  in the new g i'd go movie coming out
[2:47:47.240 --> 2:47:50.160]  if i haven't seen the robot suit out of japan
[2:47:50.160 --> 2:47:52.080]  but i have seen the uh...
[2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:56.240]  the exoskeleton that they have for u s soldiers if you just type in u s soldier
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:47:57.480]  exoskeleton
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:47:59.400]  you basically hop into this thing
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:04.120]  and it's easier on your legs so you're able to all run faster walk longer
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:08.160]  without getting tired and i think you can lift uh... up to ten times what you
[2:48:08.160 --> 2:48:09.600]  would normally be able to
[2:48:09.600 --> 2:48:10.600]  with these
[2:48:10.600 --> 2:48:13.760]  with these metal apparatus is that are essentially you know you hold on to two
[2:48:13.760 --> 2:48:17.000]  bars here and then they have like the hand things that that are there and you
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:21.280]  pull down on them and it makes you ten times stronger and ten times more durable
[2:48:21.280 --> 2:48:24.760]  and that's again something that's now years old and on the public market
[2:48:24.760 --> 2:48:28.680]  uh... you know the big dogs they're being used in the middle east right now to
[2:48:28.680 --> 2:48:29.840]  carry equipment
[2:48:29.840 --> 2:48:31.600]  uh... the robo snake
[2:48:31.600 --> 2:48:35.120]  the robo snake is now going to be planting bombs and doing surveillance for
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:36.200]  the massage
[2:48:36.200 --> 2:48:39.000]  so again this is an international intelligence thing
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:42.400]  there are different flavors of it all over the world
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:46.760]  to me it's obvious that they're suppressing some of this technology again
[2:48:46.760 --> 2:48:49.960]  when the stealth bomber was created by the nazis let's repeat that when the
[2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:53.760]  stealth bomber was recreated by the nazis in the public doesn't know about it
[2:48:53.760 --> 2:48:54.520]  for another
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:56.400]  we didn't know the nazis created it
[2:48:56.400 --> 2:49:01.120]  until seventy years from when they did we just found out about it last week
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:05.560]  can you imagine what they have you know in these underground facilities in top
[2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:09.240]  secret facilities i mean it has to be mind-blowing
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:13.840]  also uh... and i was i was thinking more about what you're saying about the
[2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:15.880]  drone
[2:49:15.880 --> 2:49:18.040]  i'm wondering if they could even apply this
[2:49:18.040 --> 2:49:21.400]  who even liked the uh... the honda humanoid for example
[2:49:21.400 --> 2:49:23.680]  they could deploy these uh... honda humanoid
[2:49:23.680 --> 2:49:25.000]  well eventually sure
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:27.600]  well right now you know about the honda humanoid
[2:49:27.600 --> 2:49:31.080]  but you know about the honda humanoid that is now being controlled by uh... thought patterns
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:31.740]  right
[2:49:31.740 --> 2:49:34.800]  so in other words they have that little and i think it's called as a mall for
[2:49:34.800 --> 2:49:35.800]  something like that
[2:49:35.800 --> 2:49:39.160]  it's it's the one by honda it's a little robot it's it stands about this big you
[2:49:39.160 --> 2:49:40.920]  can watch them break dance or whatever
[2:49:40.920 --> 2:49:42.560]  but they've set it up so
[2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:46.280]  you know they put these big like helmet type thing on a person and then that
[2:49:46.280 --> 2:49:48.800]  person thinks i want to move my right hand
[2:49:48.800 --> 2:49:50.600]  and then it moves its right hand
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:49:53.760]  and then that person thinks well i want to move my left arm and it moves its
[2:49:53.760 --> 2:49:54.560]  left arm
[2:49:54.560 --> 2:49:56.960]  i mean the person doesn't actually have to think about it
[2:49:56.960 --> 2:49:59.120]  for it to happen this is technology
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:02.400]  now this is not science fiction that's what i have to explain to people
[2:50:02.400 --> 2:50:06.240]  not science fiction we are in a period of time
[2:50:06.240 --> 2:50:10.480]  where nanotechnology is real where artificial intelligence is real
[2:50:10.480 --> 2:50:14.080]  where xbox is gearing up to put a live
[2:50:14.080 --> 2:50:17.680]  motion capture voice recognition camera
[2:50:17.680 --> 2:50:21.520]  in millions of homes for christmas project natal
[2:50:21.520 --> 2:50:24.520]  something that will be hooked into the internet twenty four seven unless you

[2:50:28.280 --> 2:50:32.440]  again voice recognition face recognition motion
[2:50:32.440 --> 2:50:35.160]  recognition don't believe me just type it into
[2:50:35.160 --> 2:50:38.360]  they're proud of it they think it's the best thing since breakfast

[2:55:05.560 --> 2:55:10.120]  bullets fly all right we are back see alex joneshaw and jason bernie sitting
[2:55:10.120 --> 2:55:12.600]  in and you know one of the stories that i just
[2:55:12.600 --> 2:55:16.680]  totally and completely forgot about because it's a day ago and the media
[2:55:16.680 --> 2:55:21.400]  doesn't follow up on big stories like this is that dhs through drills let me
[2:55:21.400 --> 2:55:24.280]  say this again dhs through drills was able to get
[2:55:24.280 --> 2:55:30.680]  bombs into 10 separate buildings really so dhs and government agencies through
[2:55:30.680 --> 2:55:34.120]  drills are able to plant bombs in buildings weird
[2:55:34.120 --> 2:55:38.360]  huh sounds a lot like 9 11 but if you bring that up if you say that they were
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:43.320]  running drills on 9 11 or they were redoing security
[2:55:43.320 --> 2:55:46.200]  remember while they're redoing security what better opportunity to run a
[2:55:46.200 --> 2:55:50.200]  drill to put explosives in that they think are not real they think they're
[2:55:50.200 --> 2:55:53.960]  mock explosives they think they're dummy detonators
[2:55:53.960 --> 2:55:58.360]  than to run drills and do so and again we find in bombs in any other buildings
[2:55:58.360 --> 2:56:02.760]  by al-qaeda or extremist groups like in the dhs reports
[2:56:02.760 --> 2:56:06.440]  no it's the government that is able to get
[2:56:06.440 --> 2:56:09.560]  explosives into buildings and that's why we're going to play this clip coming up
[2:56:09.560 --> 2:56:13.400]  at the 30 after break it's a long clip so we're going to wait but
[2:56:13.400 --> 2:56:17.640]  a lot of people of you are aware that niles harriett along with uh
[2:56:17.640 --> 2:56:20.920]  and niles harriett is overseas by the way along with richard gauge and steven
[2:56:20.920 --> 2:56:23.560]  jones have uncovered the fact that unexploded
[2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:27.400]  thermite has been discovered or thermate has been discovered in the rubble at
[2:56:27.400 --> 2:56:31.800]  the world trade center and of course this would explain why world
[2:56:31.800 --> 2:56:35.880]  trade center 1 2 and 7 fell into their own footprint at almost free fall
[2:56:35.880 --> 2:56:40.040]  speed because there were explosives in the buildings
[2:56:40.040 --> 2:56:44.600]  and remember world trade center building 7 would not have been able to be rigged
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:49.640]  for demolition unless it was done by intelligence
[2:56:49.640 --> 2:56:54.040]  or the u.s government well that sounds ludicrous jason why is that
[2:56:54.040 --> 2:56:57.640]  well you know not only did it have the largest cia base
[2:56:57.640 --> 2:57:00.920]  outside of langley virginia you think that the cia
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:04.760]  might conduct surveillance on the building where their largest
[2:57:04.760 --> 2:57:08.920]  offices in the middle of manhattan in the world trade center complex
[2:57:08.920 --> 2:57:11.480]  hmm the department of defense was there
[2:57:11.480 --> 2:57:15.160]  the securities and exchange commission was there the irs was there
[2:57:15.160 --> 2:57:19.320]  the office of emergency management was there and let's not forget the largest
[2:57:19.320 --> 2:57:25.720]  secret service office in the world was there
[2:57:25.720 --> 2:57:30.040]  and again the media spins it like oh oh this is dangerous terrorists can get
[2:57:30.040 --> 2:57:34.440]  bombs in buildings no the government posing as other
[2:57:34.440 --> 2:57:37.240]  government officials can get bombs into buildings and you can
[2:57:37.240 --> 2:57:40.680]  bet that's what they did it's not like they just walked in as some you know joe
[2:57:40.680 --> 2:57:44.680]  schmo with a pizza no they probably had
[2:57:44.680 --> 2:57:48.200]  you know identification that said no i'm part of a government organization
[2:57:48.200 --> 2:57:51.480]  and then they said well they were able to get into bathrooms even when they were
[2:57:51.480 --> 2:57:55.160]  locked see what what they did and by the way i had a long
[2:57:55.160 --> 2:57:58.440]  discussion with my friend who worked security at jfk and
[2:57:58.440 --> 2:58:01.160]  leguardia airport for years after 9 11
[2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:04.200]  um he almost went to iraq they didn't end up taking him but he was a u.s
[2:58:04.200 --> 2:58:08.360]  military guy and he explained exactly what they did
[2:58:08.360 --> 2:58:14.040]  to me or yesterday to me years ago he said what they do is they smuggle in
[2:58:14.040 --> 2:58:18.040]  different parts and they hit you so hard that you can only catch
[2:58:18.040 --> 2:58:22.120]  so many people so a lot of people get through with these parts of explosives
[2:58:22.120 --> 2:58:25.720]  and then there's somebody else who comes in with no explosives
[2:58:25.720 --> 2:58:29.240]  with nothing whatsoever he knows where to go and then he will assemble the
[2:58:29.240 --> 2:58:32.120]  explosive somewhere else mainly in a bathroom
[2:58:32.120 --> 2:58:35.880]  and these guys were able to trick other employees to open up bathrooms for them
[2:58:35.880 --> 2:58:38.280]  so that they could put these explosives together back
[2:58:38.280 --> 2:58:43.320]  after this is the alex joneshow

[2:59:56.280 --> 3:00:00.840]  alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:00:17.720 --> 3:00:21.800]  now there's just so many stories out there that it's almost impossible to
[3:00:21.800 --> 3:00:25.960]  even cover them all in a four hour time period in fact yesterday
[3:00:25.960 --> 3:00:30.120]  alex wanted to cover the fact that the pope again called for a new world order
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:33.240]  you know the new world order that doesn't exist again
[3:00:33.240 --> 3:00:36.920]  because in 2004 the previous pope also called for a new world order
[3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:40.680]  and he had done so previously but this time rat singers jumping on the new
[3:00:40.680 --> 3:00:44.280]  world order bang went wagon and now it's a new economic order and what is this
[3:00:44.280 --> 3:00:48.120]  new economic order it's a global currency under the banking
[3:00:48.120 --> 3:00:52.920]  elite that's what it is so we're gonna play that clip as well
[3:00:52.920 --> 3:00:56.680]  i'm gonna continue to go to your calls and like i said we're gonna hit up this
[3:00:56.680 --> 3:01:00.280]  uh it's a longer segment we not we may not play it all it's up at
[3:01:00.280 --> 3:01:04.120]  prison plan and info wars right now but niles harriet
[3:01:04.120 --> 3:01:07.560]  explaining the nanothermite that was found in the debris
[3:01:07.560 --> 3:01:10.760]  at the world trade center and how this is going global this is all over the
[3:01:10.760 --> 3:01:15.560]  world now people know i mean you've got the heads of the
[3:01:15.560 --> 3:01:19.400]  opposition party in japan talking about 911 truth
[3:01:19.400 --> 3:01:23.400]  you've got ex-prime ministers of italy talking about
[3:01:23.400 --> 3:01:27.880]  911 truth and people waking up all over the world and in this country
[3:01:27.880 --> 3:01:33.000]  to 911 truth as well i want to jump gears just for a second here china
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:36.600]  babies sold for adoption now is this what you want in this
[3:01:36.600 --> 3:01:40.440]  country because again as they become further westernized wearing you know
[3:01:40.440 --> 3:01:43.880]  Levi jeans and drinking coca-cola we further
[3:01:43.880 --> 3:01:48.680]  fall into their paradigm of a police state and guilty until proven innocent
[3:01:48.680 --> 3:01:52.920]  one child policies that sort of thing these government regulations over
[3:01:52.920 --> 3:01:57.000]  every facet of your life we move towards slave labor
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:02:01.880]  do you understand dozens of baby girls in southern china have reportedly been
[3:02:01.880 --> 3:02:05.880]  taken from parents who broke family planning laws and then sold for
[3:02:05.880 --> 3:02:08.600]  adoption overseas did you hear what i said
[3:02:08.600 --> 3:02:11.320]  you have too many kids we're taking your kid
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:17.160]  and we're making a profit let me repeat that dozens of baby girls in southern
[3:02:17.160 --> 3:02:20.760]  china and remember having a girl is frowned upon everybody wants a man over
[3:02:20.760 --> 3:02:24.040]  there you're almost a failure if you're one child is a baby girl that's the
[3:02:24.040 --> 3:02:27.560]  kind of sick society that they live in
[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:31.720]  reportedly have been taken from parents who broke family planning laws and then
[3:02:31.720 --> 3:02:34.920]  sold for adoption overseas an investigation by the state owned
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:38.440]  southern metro metropolis news found that about
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:47.720]  80 girls in one county 80 girls in a county had been sold for $3,000
[3:02:47.720 --> 3:02:51.080]  can you imagine that someone ripping your baby
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:56.360]  out of your arms and then turning a profit of $3,000 that's what your blood
[3:02:56.360 --> 3:03:00.680]  is worth that's what your humanity is worth $3,000
[3:03:00.680 --> 3:03:05.400]  i'm getting sick just talking about it it's gross it's out of control it needs to
[3:03:05.400 --> 3:03:08.600]  be stopped we need to flourish even further
[3:03:08.600 --> 3:03:12.920]  you should have a big family who who are you supposed to depend on
[3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:17.080]  when you get older who are you supposed to depend on in a time i need it's your
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:21.720]  family and that's why the global is so desperately want to break up that unit
[3:03:21.720 --> 3:03:26.920]  because they know how tight knit it can be the babies were taken when the parents
[3:03:26.920 --> 3:03:30.360]  could not pay the steep fines imposed on having too many
[3:03:30.360 --> 3:03:33.240]  children do you see what i'm saying to you it's going to be the same thing in
[3:03:33.240 --> 3:03:36.600]  this country they are going to tax you on how big your home is
[3:03:36.600 --> 3:03:40.440]  what kind of car you drive how much garbage your family produces
[3:03:40.440 --> 3:03:44.360]  and of course how large your family is
[3:03:44.360 --> 3:03:48.120]  it will be a huge incentive to sterilize yourself
[3:03:48.120 --> 3:03:51.000]  i know it sounds like marriage it sounds impossible
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:55.960]  they're selling babies in china that they're taking away from families
[3:03:55.960 --> 3:04:00.760]  because they can't pay the heavy taxes that they've imposed on them
[3:04:00.760 --> 3:04:05.000]  disgusting sickening outlandish reality
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:08.840]  reality the real world the one you and i live in
[3:04:08.840 --> 3:04:12.280]  the one you and i breathe from that's what they do
[3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:15.960]  that's the evil of man that is what we are capable of
[3:04:15.960 --> 3:04:19.320]  again humanity just like anything else is a double edged
[3:04:19.320 --> 3:04:22.920]  sword we can empower each other or we can enslave one another
[3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:27.960]  and unfortunately folks the masses are being enslaved at this very
[3:04:27.960 --> 3:04:32.200]  moment and they don't even know it because they care about michael jackson
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:35.320]  dancing around like a fool and they care about steve
[3:04:35.320 --> 3:04:39.560]  mcnair getting capped by his girlfriend folks he's a quarterback

[3:10:59.720 --> 3:11:03.640]  about that or who represented that to put that in effect
[3:11:03.640 --> 3:11:06.760]  so what are they doing they're moving their central offices into uh utah is
[3:11:06.760 --> 3:11:10.280]  that what you're telling me according to what i've seen on your website
[3:11:10.280 --> 3:11:13.720]  well i mean if it's on the website it's got to be linked up to the dhs or the
[3:11:13.720 --> 3:11:17.400]  nsa web page because i know that the the last thing i and again i've kind of
[3:11:17.400 --> 3:11:20.360]  been out of the loop on daily news just because i've been in new york and i
[3:11:20.360 --> 3:11:22.920]  haven't helped not with the program as much just working on my movie
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:26.280]  but the last big news that i knew was that the dhs the department of homeland
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:30.600]  security was going to be engulfed into the national security agency
[3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:34.200]  and that there would be big changes so it doesn't surprise me that they might be
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:39.000]  moving locations in order to accommodate that uh reconstruction of the dhs
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:41.640]  into the nsa that's what it sounds like to me
[3:11:41.640 --> 3:11:45.160]  what are they gonna do over there do you know what what their plans are for the
[3:11:45.160 --> 3:11:48.440]  nsa or i you know i have no idea other than there's
[3:11:48.440 --> 3:11:51.400]  going to be a lot more domestic surveillance on people and there'll be
[3:11:51.400 --> 3:11:53.960]  more nightmarish police state measures i mean are you
[3:11:53.960 --> 3:11:56.760]  you look at this drill that's coming up and it's now
[3:11:56.760 --> 3:12:00.760]  two weeks away it's called national level exercise oh no i'm not sure if
[3:12:00.760 --> 3:12:04.520]  utah is in fema region six i believe it's in fema region six
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:07.720]  i know texas in arizona and some other states around that area
[3:12:07.720 --> 3:12:11.080]  are in fema region six but they're about to run a mass
[3:12:11.080 --> 3:12:15.000]  drill where they take over all local government all tribal governments all
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:18.040]  federal uh uh government agencies all state run
[3:12:18.040 --> 3:12:21.160]  government agencies they're going to bring in foreign troops from
[3:12:21.160 --> 3:12:25.960]  the uk canada mexico and australia as well as private forces
[3:12:25.960 --> 3:12:29.720]  to train the the uh the public how to be spied on
[3:12:29.720 --> 3:12:32.520]  basically they're going to use all these different organizations to do a mass
[3:12:32.520 --> 3:12:37.080]  spying drill on the american populace and see who the extremists are
[3:12:37.080 --> 3:12:40.520]  see who the domestic terrorists are and run these massive

[3:12:43.800 --> 3:12:47.480]  n l e o nine and that could be part of the preparation i'm not sure if utah is
[3:12:47.480 --> 3:12:50.680]  part of that but it very well could be a thank you for the call rob

[3:15:42.680 --> 3:15:46.360]  info wars dot com and articles at info wars dot com we will try to get
[3:15:46.360 --> 3:15:50.120]  that story posted because that is a very important story i thank you for the call
[3:15:50.120 --> 3:15:54.120]  jim we're going to jump to kyle gary christ and mike in a moment but first i
[3:15:54.120 --> 3:16:00.520]  want to play this clip of the pope once again calling for a new world order
[3:16:00.520 --> 3:16:04.600]  intended a profound hope benedict the sixteenth is calling for a new world
[3:16:04.600 --> 3:16:08.920]  financial order in the third encyclical of his pontificate benedict denounced
[3:16:08.920 --> 3:16:12.760]  the profit at all cost mentality of the globalized economy
[3:16:12.760 --> 3:16:16.760]  and he lamented that greed brought about the worst economic downturn since the
[3:16:16.760 --> 3:16:21.160]  great depression the document entitled charity in truth was released just
[3:16:21.160 --> 3:16:24.120]  hours before the g eight summit gets underway in italy
[3:16:24.120 --> 3:16:28.680]  we have seen the consequences of a globalization where the market has to
[3:16:28.680 --> 3:16:32.760]  find by itself the regulations and the rules
[3:16:32.760 --> 3:16:36.600]  and we have seen the disaster that has been over the last
[3:16:36.600 --> 3:16:41.400]  year the pot of stress that he is not opposed to a globalized economy saying
[3:16:41.400 --> 3:16:44.920]  that if done correctly it has unprecedented potential to redistribute
[3:16:44.920 --> 3:16:48.440]  wealth around the world but he did warn if globalization
[3:16:48.440 --> 3:16:52.840]  continues on the current path modern society's risk increased poverty
[3:16:52.840 --> 3:16:56.200]  inequality and further environmental damages
[3:16:56.200 --> 3:17:01.800]  i think that for sure the pope thinks that globalization without a soul
[3:17:01.800 --> 3:17:06.360]  and without a link with the veritas with truth
[3:17:06.360 --> 3:17:10.920]  uh is at a high risk mark hamrick the associated
[3:17:10.920 --> 3:17:15.560]  and notice that they're always trying to promote it is the more humane way oh
[3:17:15.560 --> 3:17:19.800]  this is globalization with a soul know what it means is redistributing
[3:17:19.800 --> 3:17:23.560]  redistribution of wealth is we will probably go from the second world
[3:17:23.560 --> 3:17:26.920]  nation that we're turning into yes we are turning into a second world nation we
[3:17:26.920 --> 3:17:30.600]  can no longer afford health care we no longer have benefits packages
[3:17:30.600 --> 3:17:33.320]  we no longer make anything in this country turning into a second world
[3:17:33.320 --> 3:17:36.120]  nation we'll have to just turn into a third world nation
[3:17:36.120 --> 3:17:39.080]  and that will allow us to join with canada and mexico
[3:17:39.080 --> 3:17:43.080]  in an outward north american union a hard north american union
[3:17:43.080 --> 3:17:46.920]  instead of a soft north american union with that hard north american union
[3:17:46.920 --> 3:17:50.760]  like you said a new economic financial order you will get in a marrow
[3:17:50.760 --> 3:17:54.360]  or something similar okay that's another thing they're not talking about in this
[3:17:54.360 --> 3:17:56.840]  g8 all the headlines are about the climate bills and
[3:17:56.840 --> 3:18:01.480]  and that kind of nazism which is just again totally promoting lies totally
[3:18:01.480 --> 3:18:05.560]  promoting that carbon dioxide is killing the environment and we need to cut our
[3:18:05.560 --> 3:18:09.400]  emissions and that means we need to suffer even further that's what it means us
[3:18:09.400 --> 3:18:13.320]  americans united states citizens we need to suffer and they're going to further
[3:18:13.320 --> 3:18:17.480]  that agenda in copenhagen in denmark in december
[3:18:17.480 --> 3:18:21.000]  but right now what they're not talking about is how upset
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:25.400]  brazil russia and china are that the dollar is still the quote unquote world
[3:18:25.400 --> 3:18:27.640]  reserve currency and how they want a separate
[3:18:27.640 --> 3:18:30.600]  world reserve currency it was in headlines all over the place
[3:18:30.600 --> 3:18:34.680]  but why is it that the mainstream media doesn't want to focus on that weird huh
[3:18:34.680 --> 3:18:38.280]  very bizarre on the other side we're going to be playing this al gore
[3:18:38.280 --> 3:18:41.880]  invoking the spirit of church hill for global governance clip
[3:18:41.880 --> 3:18:44.680]  uh before that let's go to one more caller let's hit up a caller kyle in
[3:18:44.680 --> 3:18:51.480]  hawaii kyle you're online um hello um i used to be an atheist right but then
[3:18:51.480 --> 3:18:54.760]  i don't know now i'm sort of in the unsure category
[3:18:54.760 --> 3:18:59.160]  what what turned me into an atheist was looking at like christianity and i
[3:18:59.160 --> 3:19:03.480]  guess the asian religions buddhism and shinto and like just sort of
[3:19:03.480 --> 3:19:06.600]  laughing at it looking at how stupid it looked like to me
[3:19:06.600 --> 3:19:10.040]  and that's how i sort of became an atheist but now i'm sort of unsure
[3:19:10.040 --> 3:19:14.840]  because like look at this way if you think jesus is real
[3:19:14.840 --> 3:19:20.120]  or if you think he existed then then the stuff he said was was true like oh
[3:19:20.120 --> 3:19:24.760]  there's heaven afterlife all that stuff and that's what sort of made me
[3:19:24.760 --> 3:19:28.680]  made me look into the atheism but there was always a part of me
[3:19:28.680 --> 3:19:33.160]  that wanted spiritualism to be real that wanted the afterlife to be real
[3:19:33.160 --> 3:19:37.240]  and now the way i looked at it was if there is no afterlife then nothing
[3:19:37.240 --> 3:19:41.640]  really matters like what is this world we live in well i would just agree on
[3:19:41.640 --> 3:19:44.600]  that point that if there isn't any afterlife nothing really matters we
[3:19:44.600 --> 3:19:47.640]  should still be fighting tyranny no matter what you believe happens
[3:19:47.640 --> 3:19:50.280]  after you die you should be fighting for humanity on this earth but i'm going
[3:19:50.280 --> 3:19:52.920]  to address that question on the other side kyle i thank you for the call

[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:08.280]  that's fast approaching a storm that will affect you and everybody you know
[3:23:08.280 --> 3:23:10.840]  here's the story the current administration is committed to
[3:23:10.840 --> 3:23:14.520]  nationalizing health care giving 40 million new people free care now here's
[3:23:14.520 --> 3:23:17.240]  the bad news the current system will almost be immediately
[3:23:17.240 --> 3:23:20.440]  overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures
[3:23:20.440 --> 3:23:23.880]  medicare and medicare are already bankrupt many doctors are now leaving
[3:23:23.880 --> 3:23:27.160]  their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures
[3:23:27.160 --> 3:23:30.760]  all this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable
[3:23:30.760 --> 3:23:34.280]  shortages in the health care services folks it's time to be prepared for the
[3:23:34.280 --> 3:23:36.760]  worst our friends at solutions from science have
[3:23:36.760 --> 3:23:40.440]  recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you
[3:23:40.440 --> 3:23:43.880]  can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home
[3:23:43.880 --> 3:23:46.840]  it's called herbal preparations and natural therapies
[3:23:46.840 --> 3:23:50.200]  and is flat out the best course of its kind i recommend you visit this
[3:23:50.200 --> 3:23:53.160]  important new website at makeherbalmedicines.com
[3:23:53.160 --> 3:23:56.200]  that's makeherbalmedicines.com or call toll free
[3:23:56.200 --> 3:24:01.160]  877-327-0365
[3:24:01.160 --> 3:24:15.800]  you know i can certainly relate to the previous caller
[3:24:15.800 --> 3:24:19.160]  you know this disillusionment with organized religion if you will there's
[3:24:19.160 --> 3:24:24.920]  so much hypocrisy you know so many so many people that are in it for the
[3:24:24.920 --> 3:24:28.200]  money i mean you watch for instance look at christiana you look at all these
[3:24:28.200 --> 3:24:32.520]  tv evangelists they're rocking gold necklaces they got diamonds on their
[3:24:32.520 --> 3:24:35.240]  hand that's not what christianity is about so
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:38.440]  it does put into your mind sometimes that this is a scam
[3:24:38.440 --> 3:24:42.040]  now you know i was an atheist for a while i'm no longer an atheist but i
[3:24:42.040 --> 3:24:45.560]  don't really subscribe to any type of organized religion but we're really
[3:24:45.560 --> 3:24:49.640]  woke me up to the fact that there is probably something else out there and
[3:24:49.640 --> 3:24:52.920]  whether or not there there is something else out there or this is it
[3:24:52.920 --> 3:24:57.240]  that should not deter you from fighting for fighting for humanity
[3:24:57.240 --> 3:25:00.440]  i want to say that it does matter what you do on this earth no matter what i
[3:25:00.440 --> 3:25:04.520]  promise you that i promise you that you know we we live a
[3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:09.160]  life here and we make big boy decisions and from those big boy decisions
[3:25:09.160 --> 3:25:12.920]  you know come outcomes they they come whether you're going to be driving
[3:25:12.920 --> 3:25:18.120]  you know a 1976 uh chevy or you're going to be driving a 2006
[3:25:18.120 --> 3:25:21.400]  honda you know they come whether you're going to live in a little crappy
[3:25:21.400 --> 3:25:24.760]  apartment or you're gonna have a house one day they come in the fact that you
[3:25:24.760 --> 3:25:27.640]  know you're going to take care of your kids and raise a family or you're going
[3:25:27.640 --> 3:25:30.440]  to be a deadbeat dad our decisions do
[3:25:30.440 --> 3:25:34.280]  matter but if you look at the elite and many of them
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:38.680]  pose themselves as i'm a big christian conservative
[3:25:38.680 --> 3:25:42.760]  i and you know they they use jesus to their advantage no they're off in the
[3:25:42.760 --> 3:25:46.520]  woods doing the exact opposite and participating
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:50.440]  in pagan rituals now if there's nothing to religion whatsoever
[3:25:50.440 --> 3:25:54.920]  then why is it that the top one percent of the world are out in the woods
[3:25:54.920 --> 3:25:59.080]  performing pagan rituals if there's nothing to religion at all
[3:25:59.080 --> 3:26:02.360]  makes you think doesn't it all right i was going to play this al gore clip it's
[3:26:02.360 --> 3:26:05.720]  a little too long we're going to play it on the flip we're also going to play
[3:26:05.720 --> 3:26:10.040]  this clip of niles harriet and others of architects and engineers for 911
[3:26:10.040 --> 3:26:14.840]  truth exposing the nano thermate in the buildings in the
[3:26:14.840 --> 3:26:18.040]  buildings that's how they blew up folks that's how they they took down the
[3:26:18.040 --> 3:26:22.200]  columns with thermate uh... i mean again
[3:26:22.200 --> 3:26:25.880]  i encourage people to go check out steven jones's research it's so
[3:26:25.880 --> 3:26:30.120]  important but before that let's let's do a segue into that
[3:26:30.120 --> 3:26:33.080]  you know it just came out through an f o i a request
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:37.320]  three or four weeks ago that the four planes on 911 seem to have been shelved
[3:26:37.320 --> 3:26:40.600]  in a hangar somewhere for nine months prior to the attacks
[3:26:40.600 --> 3:26:44.040]  now this doesn't jive with the online accounts the online accounts say that
[3:26:44.040 --> 3:26:47.480]  they were flying here and there but the f o i a request that's freedom of
[3:26:47.480 --> 3:26:51.000]  information act request said that none of them had flown
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:57.800]  since december of 2000 now magically four planes don't fly since december of
[3:26:57.800 --> 3:27:02.120]  2000 and then those are the four planes that are hijacked on 911
[3:27:02.120 --> 3:27:05.880]  does that pass the smell test i don't believe it does
[3:27:05.880 --> 3:27:09.640]  so you know if you want to go into your little wonderland of self-denial you
[3:27:09.640 --> 3:27:13.320]  can but that doesn't add up folks doesn't add up that they're running drills
[3:27:13.320 --> 3:27:17.400]  of ramming planes into buildings on the morning of 911 it doesn't add up
[3:27:17.400 --> 3:27:21.880]  that delta 1989 supposedly had a bomb on board it doesn't add up that the four
[3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:25.560]  planes that were supposedly hijacked didn't emit hijack signals when other
[3:27:25.560 --> 3:27:29.240]  planes that morning did and they weren't being hijacked
[3:27:29.240 --> 3:27:32.360]  go check out you know fabled enemies covers a lot of this
[3:27:32.360 --> 3:27:36.600]  and uh really again exposes this international intelligence op
[3:27:36.600 --> 3:27:40.840]  that was 911 all right let's take a couple callers gary in massachusetts gary
[3:27:40.840 --> 3:27:46.280]  online jason how you doing today good listen um what you just said reminds
[3:27:46.280 --> 3:27:49.560]  me of uh nimrod in the tower of babel i kind of
[3:27:49.560 --> 3:27:54.840]  look at these uh these banking oligarchy folks is just a bunch of nimrods
[3:27:54.840 --> 3:27:58.440]  and it's only matter of time before their tower crumbles
[3:27:58.440 --> 3:28:01.720]  listen them i also wanted to harp on you today
[3:28:01.720 --> 3:28:06.520]  about curious cloud formations and earthquakes in china and japan
[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:10.360]  and how that uh whole new world order isn't coming in to order the way they
[3:28:10.360 --> 3:28:14.680]  want with a little battle with asia but say that for later here's the big issue
[3:28:14.680 --> 3:28:19.080]  have you heard of mike new mike n e w no
[3:28:19.080 --> 3:28:23.000]  visit the website m i k e n e w dot com
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:27.640]  okay and sing is um alex is a text and i'll share a text and soldier story
[3:28:27.640 --> 3:28:32.600]  michael new in october 1995 he was the only guy out of
[3:28:32.600 --> 3:28:36.840]  550 soldiers who refused to wear the un insignia
[3:28:36.840 --> 3:28:40.120]  us army soldier i do remember him okay you know about this one
[3:28:40.120 --> 3:28:44.520]  i've heard this i think i actually might have even seen him speak but go ahead
[3:28:44.520 --> 3:28:48.920]  yeah since then he's been fighting and fighting for years and uh i just uh
[3:28:48.920 --> 3:28:53.080]  learned about his website i would hope that uh we could get ron paul to support
[3:28:53.080 --> 3:28:57.000]  the citizen soldier protection act of 2009
[3:28:57.000 --> 3:29:01.720]  and mike news questions are when is obedience to an order treason
[3:29:01.720 --> 3:29:05.320]  can american soldier be forced to serve a foreign power
[3:29:05.320 --> 3:29:08.680]  uh on his website he says that's what's going on that's what we're gonna find
[3:29:08.680 --> 3:29:11.320]  out american sovereignty hangs in the balance
[3:29:11.320 --> 3:29:16.120]  you know i met his father and his father uh talked to me about him and he gave me
[3:29:16.120 --> 3:29:19.320]  a book i think that they wrote a book together or he had written a book
[3:29:19.320 --> 3:29:23.160]  i never did read it i gotta be honest but he explained to me his situation and
[3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:26.120]  he's correct i mean he should not be serving
[3:29:26.120 --> 3:29:29.800]  a foreign military service a global governance service
[3:29:29.800 --> 3:29:33.560]  nato if you will i mean they're the ones that have the takeover they want to
[3:29:33.560 --> 3:29:37.720]  empower the un even further so that they can legitimize this idea
[3:29:37.720 --> 3:29:42.920]  of global governance or a new world order we back after this with the al gore
[3:29:42.920 --> 3:29:46.360]  clip with the ae 911 truth clip and much more
[3:29:46.360 --> 3:29:49.560]  it's the alex jones show i'm jason bermas sitting in prisonplanet.tv and
[3:29:49.560 --> 3:29:54.360]  polars.com we're on the march the empires on the
[3:29:54.360 --> 3:30:01.160]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:01.160 --> 3:30:04.440]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider
[3:30:04.440 --> 3:30:08.360]  buying a solar power generator this summer number one new climate legislation
[3:30:08.360 --> 3:30:10.440]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[3:30:10.440 --> 3:30:14.920]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[3:30:14.920 --> 3:30:18.360]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[3:30:18.360 --> 3:30:21.400]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[3:30:21.400 --> 3:30:25.080]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[3:30:25.080 --> 3:30:27.960]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[3:30:27.960 --> 3:30:31.480]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[3:30:31.480 --> 3:30:34.600]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[3:30:34.600 --> 3:30:37.720]  outages number five a solar power generator provides
[3:30:37.720 --> 3:30:41.240]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[3:30:41.240 --> 3:30:44.040]  solar power generators offered by solution from science

[3:32:05.160 --> 3:32:09.160]  maintaining high energy and vibrant health most experts agree that the water
[3:32:09.160 --> 3:32:12.040]  you drink should be at a ph level of eight or higher
[3:32:12.040 --> 3:32:16.680]  alcovision plasma ph drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline
[3:32:16.680 --> 3:32:19.960]  ingredients using plasma ph drops is one of the best
[3:32:19.960 --> 3:32:23.240]  ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid
[3:32:23.240 --> 3:32:27.560]  and regain your health and energy simply put 10 drops per liter of water you
[3:32:27.560 --> 3:32:30.600]  drink to raise the ph to the ultimate level
[3:32:30.600 --> 3:32:33.880]  alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste
[3:32:33.880 --> 3:32:38.440]  and increases the oxygen content of your body disease organisms like bacteria
[3:32:38.440 --> 3:32:42.200]  and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high ph environment

[3:33:29.400 --> 3:33:33.800]  and engineers for 911 true having a global impact let me say again a global
[3:33:33.800 --> 3:33:36.840]  impact i want to thank one of our great sponsors
[3:33:36.840 --> 3:33:40.840]  it's my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com a lot of things
[3:33:40.840 --> 3:33:44.040]  can cut off your electrical power hurricane snow ice storms we had a
[3:33:44.040 --> 3:33:48.120]  power outage in here just before i'm getting ready to play a
[3:33:48.120 --> 3:33:51.240]  clip listeners should move toward getting off the
[3:33:51.240 --> 3:33:54.120]  grid and here's a good way to do just that a solar powered
[3:33:54.120 --> 3:33:56.920]  generator is now available from our longtime sponsor
[3:33:56.920 --> 3:34:00.600]  solutions from science you can get an emergency power backup kit which consists
[3:34:00.600 --> 3:34:05.240]  of a power source of 1800 watts it's an 1800 watt generator
[3:34:05.240 --> 3:34:08.520]  and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide
[3:34:08.520 --> 3:34:12.520]  endless electricity it's my solar backup dot com or call
[3:34:12.520 --> 3:34:21.800]  877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 all right let's let's just get right
[3:34:21.800 --> 3:34:27.400]  into this clip of architects and engineers for 911 truth really exposing
[3:34:27.400 --> 3:34:30.120]  the controlled demolitions of world trade center one world trade center two
[3:34:30.120 --> 3:34:34.840]  and world trade center seven on 911
[3:34:36.280 --> 3:34:40.680]  so professor neils harrett you examined the rubble that came from the world
[3:34:40.680 --> 3:34:45.080]  trade center what did you find in it well in there we find
[3:34:45.080 --> 3:34:50.040]  remains of what we characterize as a thermitic material
[3:34:50.040 --> 3:34:54.280]  and this is a very energetic material which can be used
[3:34:54.280 --> 3:35:00.600]  either for melting iron or it can be designed as an explosive
[3:35:00.600 --> 3:35:03.800]  so what effect would the nano thermite have had
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:07.400]  on the collapse of the towers on september the 11th
[3:35:07.400 --> 3:35:11.720]  actually within the group of authors behind this paper which we published
[3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:16.920]  in april there are diverging opinions about what this
[3:35:16.920 --> 3:35:20.600]  nano thermite was used for and in my opinion we should not
[3:35:20.600 --> 3:35:25.880]  speculate in a scenario for the demolition
[3:35:25.880 --> 3:35:29.320]  there's no doubt that the three towers were demolished
[3:35:29.320 --> 3:35:39.240]  on 911 so but beyond that there is very solid evidence for that
[3:35:39.240 --> 3:35:45.720]  some thermite has been used for melting the steel beams
[3:35:45.720 --> 3:35:50.840]  we should not i do not know we do not know if the thermite that we have found
[3:35:50.840 --> 3:35:53.640]  is the same thermite which has been used for
[3:35:53.640 --> 3:35:58.440]  melting the beams it's very very possible the different varieties was used
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:36:04.120]  and i personally am certain that the conventional explosives were used to
[3:36:04.120 --> 3:36:08.360]  in abundance when you say in abundance how much do you mean
[3:36:08.360 --> 3:36:14.440]  tons hundred tons so many many many tons we're not just talking about nano
[3:36:14.440 --> 3:36:17.080]  thermite in fact we're talking about both nano thermite
[3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:20.760]  and conventional explosives used in large quantities but we have not found
[3:36:20.760 --> 3:36:24.680]  remains or transits of conventional explosives actually
[3:36:24.680 --> 3:36:28.840]  we have suggested and recommended to NIST which is a national
[3:36:28.840 --> 3:36:32.920]  institute of standards and technology that they should look for
[3:36:32.920 --> 3:36:38.200]  remains or traces of explosives and they have refused to do so every time
[3:36:38.200 --> 3:36:42.600]  they have not investigated it and in terms of the nano thermite the
[3:36:42.600 --> 3:36:47.000]  traces of which you did find what are the possible explanations for its
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:51.400]  presence in the world trade center i mean could it have been in the aeroplanes
[3:36:51.400 --> 3:36:54.920]  is it could it have been a naturally occurring substance in any way
[3:36:54.920 --> 3:36:59.000]  well the two last questions or options i can
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:03.160]  definitely rule out it cannot have come from the aeroplanes
[3:37:03.160 --> 3:37:09.640]  and well if it's been there on beforehand those who put it there i've
[3:37:09.640 --> 3:37:15.080]  urged them to step forward and tell us how and why it got there
[3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:19.400]  one thing which has been very mentioned frequently in the discussion
[3:37:19.400 --> 3:37:23.960]  following our publication is that this could be the primer paint which was
[3:37:23.960 --> 3:37:28.840]  applied to the steel beams in order to prevent corrosion
[3:37:28.840 --> 3:37:33.560]  and much of the many of the ingredients are the same
[3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:39.240]  in terms of iron oxide as i told you which is the red color where you see on
[3:37:39.240 --> 3:37:42.920]  steel beams usually when it's protected it's the iron oxide so some of the
[3:37:42.920 --> 3:37:47.000]  chemicals in there are the same but the composition
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:51.400]  of the primer paint used there are two very good reasons for this not being
[3:37:51.400 --> 3:37:55.320]  paint in my opinion one is that the the
[3:37:55.320 --> 3:37:59.560]  composition chemical composition of the paint primer paint used
[3:37:59.560 --> 3:38:04.520]  in world trade center according to NIST the national institute of
[3:38:04.520 --> 3:38:09.560]  standards and technology is vastly different from what we're seeing
[3:38:09.560 --> 3:38:15.400]  to be specific i say we are missing large amounts of chromium
[3:38:15.400 --> 3:38:23.960]  and zinc and magnesium next which can be understood by
[3:38:23.960 --> 3:38:27.880]  everyone is that the paint applied on the steel
[3:38:27.880 --> 3:38:31.560]  beams are stable to elevated temperatures
[3:38:31.560 --> 3:38:36.600]  NIST did experiments with the steel beams because they wanted to use
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:42.680]  the the appearance of the paint as a measure for the temperature the steel
[3:38:42.680 --> 3:38:47.640]  beams had been exposed to and let me be specific so when
[3:38:47.640 --> 3:38:53.080]  you heat up this steel beam at 250 degrees centigrade it starts cracking
[3:38:53.080 --> 3:38:57.240]  this is because the steel expands more than the paint
[3:38:57.240 --> 3:39:01.880]  so they get what they call mud cracks and they keep on cracking until a
[3:39:01.880 --> 3:39:06.440]  temperature about 650 degrees where it starts peeling off
[3:39:06.440 --> 3:39:11.560]  forming scales this continues to about 800 degrees
[3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:15.560]  when when this scaling becomes extensive
[3:39:15.560 --> 3:39:22.520]  i would say excessive but it does not burn so the paint on the steel beams
[3:39:22.520 --> 3:39:29.240]  is stable beyond 800 degrees centigrade now the stuff we have found ignites at
[3:39:29.240 --> 3:39:36.120]  430 degrees centigrade so it is not the primer
[3:39:36.120 --> 3:39:40.520]  paint so what i can say is is this nemothermite
[3:39:40.520 --> 3:39:45.880]  well it quacks like a duck it rattles like a duck
[3:39:45.880 --> 3:39:50.840]  it looks like a duck maybe it's a duck all right let's pull the clip right
[3:39:50.840 --> 3:39:53.880]  there the other half is also posted at infowars.com
[3:39:53.880 --> 3:39:57.960]  and prismplanet.tv right now and like he says if it
[3:39:57.960 --> 3:40:00.760]  quacks like a duck it looks like a duck and it acts like a duck
[3:40:00.760 --> 3:40:04.120]  it's probably a duck i'm gonna take a couple phone calls and then we're gonna
[3:40:04.120 --> 3:40:08.600]  go to this global governance gore clip the man who is
[3:40:08.600 --> 3:40:12.200]  only going to benefit even further from this latest
[3:40:12.200 --> 3:40:15.960]  global warming legislation that has been hoisted
[3:40:15.960 --> 3:40:19.080]  upon the american people and really the world populace
[3:40:19.080 --> 3:40:22.040]  you know we're going to be the ones paying the big dividends out of this
[3:40:22.040 --> 3:40:25.160]  the industrialized countries especially the united states
[3:40:25.160 --> 3:40:30.360]  europe is also going to be folks i can't even tell you how nightmarish this is
[3:40:30.360 --> 3:40:35.560]  and how poorly guised it is this is about global government
[3:40:35.560 --> 3:40:38.920]  i mean when i when i first met alex jones for the first time
[3:40:38.920 --> 3:40:42.440]  at the first conference on 9-11 in chicago
[3:40:42.440 --> 3:40:46.520]  and i was discussing with him you know well what's up
[3:40:46.520 --> 3:40:50.600]  with this this global warming and he said look it's going to be used
[3:40:50.600 --> 3:40:54.360]  to try to get you into a worldwide carbon based
[3:40:54.360 --> 3:40:59.320]  tax program and carbon credit system i almost laughed at him like come on alex
[3:40:59.320 --> 3:41:02.840]  that can't be true and i looked into it and it is the real
[3:41:02.840 --> 3:41:05.800]  deal and it is now coming to fruition folks
[3:41:05.800 --> 3:41:10.200]  it is a reality all right christen florida you're on the air
[3:41:10.200 --> 3:41:15.000]  yes sir have you yes have you seen the the humming bot that a wire magazine
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:19.560]  just put out i'll put a video up on july 2nd no no is this one of
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:22.920]  these microbots they got it's pretty small it's
[3:41:22.920 --> 3:41:25.880]  amazingly small it's about two or three inches i'd
[3:41:25.880 --> 3:41:29.800]  estimate and uh it's called a humming bot it looks like a hummingbird and
[3:41:29.800 --> 3:41:33.000]  it can hover around they're trying to they're saying how they're trying to
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:36.280]  improve upon it to stand wins but of course they probably have something
[3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:39.080]  much more advanced and what kind of sensors does it have does it have a
[3:41:39.080 --> 3:41:42.920]  camera where it where it wirelessly transmits things or is it just a data
[3:41:42.920 --> 3:41:46.680]  gatherer what's the deal it's remote control apparently it's
[3:41:46.680 --> 3:41:51.640]  has a man in a plastic enclosed room just directing it around with a
[3:41:51.640 --> 3:41:55.160]  remote control right in front of him taking off from the ground and landing
[3:41:55.160 --> 3:41:58.360]  and doing different things so if a humming bot flies into you and
[3:41:58.360 --> 3:42:01.160]  and you and in the future you catch something like the
[3:42:01.160 --> 3:42:05.080]  h-47 and 326 birds with because some humming bot
[3:42:05.080 --> 3:42:08.840]  munching or hot pocket munching is it's based drawing
[3:42:08.840 --> 3:42:12.360]  teams think into an xbox is just blowing off some steam and uh
[3:42:12.360 --> 3:42:15.560]  blowing away people for the chip charomotors and and by the way i want to
[3:42:15.560 --> 3:42:18.840]  explain to people just because they're using an xbox controller doesn't mean
[3:42:18.840 --> 3:42:22.840]  it's affiliated with xbox just like any piece of electronic it's guided by
[3:42:22.840 --> 3:42:26.040]  software so they just re-engineer the software
[3:42:26.040 --> 3:42:29.560]  to you can actually take your xbox controller and through a device
[3:42:29.560 --> 3:42:33.160]  plug it into your computer and use it as a controller for your computer as well
[3:42:33.160 --> 3:42:37.560]  so they're doing this because people are already acclimated to the xbox style
[3:42:37.560 --> 3:42:40.680]  controller you're going to see even crazier controllers come out
[3:42:40.680 --> 3:42:44.280]  as it progresses but again they like to get you acquainted to the technology
[3:42:44.280 --> 3:42:47.800]  you're used to and then give you another use for that like you said
[3:42:47.800 --> 3:42:53.160]  to control a micro hummingbird apparatus folks again it's reality we're
[3:42:53.160 --> 3:42:56.200]  going to hopefully play that video on the alex jones show tomorrow don't have
[3:42:56.200 --> 3:42:59.000]  the time today i thank you for the call one more call and then we'll get to go
[3:42:59.000 --> 3:43:02.760]  or uh mic in florida mic you're on the line
[3:43:02.760 --> 3:43:07.400]  hey what's going on how you doing sir
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:11.880]  yeah uh i was i'm kind of interested the fact that you were covering me a
[3:43:11.880 --> 3:43:14.920]  climate bill that they passed in congress earlier
[3:43:14.920 --> 3:43:19.240]  um and the reason being is because i contacted my two state senators and i
[3:43:19.240 --> 3:43:22.840]  gotta let you go man the dog the dog barking is too much i appreciate the
[3:43:22.840 --> 3:43:25.480]  call um let's talk about the climate bill
[3:43:25.480 --> 3:43:28.440]  it's bad news it's the biggest tax increase in history
[3:43:28.440 --> 3:43:32.040]  it's going to give them uh the ability to come into your home and say you need
[3:43:32.040 --> 3:43:34.840]  to fix this this and this and if you don't do so we're taking it and then
[3:43:34.840 --> 3:43:37.960]  we'll bulldoze the neighborhood after the whole neighborhood
[3:43:37.960 --> 3:43:41.080]  can't fix these problems because they're going to low-end housing first let's go
[3:43:41.080 --> 3:43:44.920]  to gore and his global governance clip
[3:43:44.920 --> 3:43:51.640]  good news from the united states uh within one month of taking office
[3:43:51.640 --> 3:43:56.200]  president obama secured eighty billion
[3:43:56.200 --> 3:44:02.600]  dollars u.s for renewable energy and green infrastructure
[3:44:02.600 --> 3:44:09.400]  uh and then just uh two weeks ago the house of representatives passed the
[3:44:09.400 --> 3:44:14.120]  waxman marky bill which for all of its flaws
[3:44:14.120 --> 3:44:19.000]  does put a price on carbon and is very much
[3:44:19.000 --> 3:44:22.840]  a step in the right direction it achieves real reductions
[3:44:22.840 --> 3:44:32.200]  below the 1990 uh base level uh by 2020 uh and that is the threshold that
[3:44:32.200 --> 3:44:37.880]  many have said including many in china is the threshold that
[3:44:37.880 --> 3:44:46.520]  will dramatically increase the prospects for uh success
[3:44:46.520 --> 3:44:53.240]  but it is the awareness itself that will drive the change and one of the ways
[3:44:53.240 --> 3:44:57.480]  it will drive the change is through global governance and global
[3:44:57.480 --> 3:45:01.000]  agreements but the many business leaders who have
[3:45:01.000 --> 3:45:04.760]  been present here uh are among those taking
[3:45:04.760 --> 3:45:09.960]  leadership in other ways we talk for example i let's just stop right there
[3:45:09.960 --> 3:45:14.920]  the cat's out of the bag right there again this is about global governance
[3:45:14.920 --> 3:45:20.280]  global government government a price on carbon
[3:45:20.280 --> 3:45:24.280]  folks right now as i speak to you carbon dioxide is
[3:45:24.280 --> 3:45:28.280]  oozing from my body i must be bad because
[3:45:28.280 --> 3:45:32.040]  i'm hurting the environment and remember the propaganda has been
[3:45:32.040 --> 3:45:35.880]  enormous and towards your children i'm seeing go green
[3:45:35.880 --> 3:45:39.960]  everywhere i'm seeing green vehicle parking spots
[3:45:39.960 --> 3:45:46.600]  at malls and walmarts they are pushing this agenda on an entirely new level
[3:45:46.600 --> 3:45:50.120]  and this if this was really about cleaning up the environment
[3:45:50.120 --> 3:45:53.720]  truly you know it's you know maybe we should stop putting fluoride and mercury
[3:45:53.720 --> 3:45:56.760]  in the water maybe maybe stop putting
[3:45:56.760 --> 3:45:59.880]  psychotropic drugs in the water it's been found all over the place just
[3:45:59.880 --> 3:46:03.000]  just google it maybe we're doing that sort of thing
[3:46:03.000 --> 3:46:07.240]  i'd be for it but when we're gonna make al gore rich and promote global
[3:46:07.240 --> 3:46:11.800]  government and uh you know again promote a carbon
[3:46:11.800 --> 3:46:16.680]  credit tax system for the way we live yeah i'm against that call me kooky
[3:46:16.680 --> 3:46:22.280]  let's go to ten or no we're on uh yeah we're on tim and ohio tim you're online
[3:46:22.280 --> 3:46:26.280]  yes sir hey jb i got a few dream brain droppings for you here
[3:46:26.280 --> 3:46:29.240]  for the uh international property maintenance code
[3:46:29.240 --> 3:46:32.840]  yes you don't have to go any further than your own local
[3:46:32.840 --> 3:46:37.000]  city hall to find those were those laws already on the books
[3:46:37.000 --> 3:46:41.480]  i have a notice to abate that i managed to obtain from my local city hall
[3:46:41.480 --> 3:46:45.720]  and there's one sentence in there that says further please be advised
[3:46:45.720 --> 3:46:49.320]  the 2006 international property maintenance code
[3:46:49.320 --> 3:46:54.360]  section pm 302.4 provides what a property owners requirements are with
[3:46:54.360 --> 3:46:58.920]  respect to exterior property areas as follows and then goes into it
[3:46:58.920 --> 3:47:02.760]  i'll spare you that but it's already on the books in the local
[3:47:02.760 --> 3:47:08.520]  level now i'm with you man i mean it's night marriage i mean i want that
[3:47:08.520 --> 3:47:12.120]  guided to do the article that writers and info wars or articles and info wars
[3:47:12.120 --> 3:47:15.320]  i think that they're gonna further that agenda with this climate bill
[3:47:15.320 --> 3:47:18.440]  and they're gonna create their little you know city year youth core and they'll
[3:47:18.440 --> 3:47:21.800]  probably be different flavors of it but they'll have the environmental cops too
[3:47:21.800 --> 3:47:24.680]  and they're gonna tell you how bad you are and how you need to fix your home
[3:47:24.680 --> 3:47:28.680]  and like i said most people won't be able to rewire their whole home up to
[3:47:28.680 --> 3:47:31.880]  standards so they're just gonna take it
[3:47:31.880 --> 3:47:35.480]  quickly could i change gears to this s909 the free speech bill that they're
[3:47:35.480 --> 3:47:38.440]  trying to attach to the defense authorization bill and push through
[3:47:38.440 --> 3:47:40.840]  next week sir thank you do you remember last
[3:47:40.840 --> 3:47:45.160]  june when mike reagan went on the air calling for i forget who it was to be
[3:47:45.160 --> 3:47:47.400]  shot yeah mark dice to be shot all nine eleven
[3:47:47.400 --> 3:47:51.480]  three threes to be shot also yeah and he went did on his radio show and
[3:47:51.480 --> 3:47:55.800]  you remember just the year before i mean how imus was crucified for what he says
[3:47:55.800 --> 3:47:59.240]  yeah and that reagan calls for murder
[3:47:59.240 --> 3:48:04.040]  i get away with it yeah no absolutely absolutely that's the new america sir
[3:48:04.040 --> 3:48:07.800]  michael reagan is uh part of that false left right paradigm he can just tell
[3:48:07.800 --> 3:48:11.400]  people that he'll pay for the bullets and he wants to see somebody fired upon
[3:48:11.400 --> 3:48:16.840]  on a firing squad and that's a okay in the new america i thank you for the call
[3:48:16.840 --> 3:48:21.000]  let's go to davis in wisconsin davis you're online
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:25.320]  hi jay said glad to hear you back oh thank you um
[3:48:25.320 --> 3:48:28.920]  i saw your fabled enemies online and i bought bought your movie and many of
[3:48:28.920 --> 3:48:32.520]  alex jones's uh documentary also excellent day
[3:48:32.520 --> 3:48:36.200]  i'd like to honor more of the sponsors because i think you guys are the best
[3:48:36.200 --> 3:48:40.360]  news out there that cost the airwaves anywhere so thank you
[3:48:40.360 --> 3:48:45.160]  including you know abc cbs i wish those wages could go to you guys
[3:48:45.160 --> 3:48:48.280]  well i'll tell you what without those networks we wouldn't have our news wires
[3:48:48.280 --> 3:48:52.200]  because at times they do tell the truth at times they do reveal a story but they
[3:48:52.200 --> 3:48:55.320]  never play up the big stories they never play up the big parts
[3:48:55.320 --> 3:48:58.680]  they'll mention it in passing and then they'll give it a positive spin like
[3:48:58.680 --> 3:49:02.520]  oh this climate bill is going to stop global warming it's a positive thing
[3:49:02.520 --> 3:49:05.640]  they don't want to talk about how it's the highest tax increase

[3:54:57.080 --> 3:55:03.960]  yes can work for alex um you know here in nebraska a lot of things that alex
[3:55:03.960 --> 3:55:07.720]  talks about doesn't seem like it doesn't apply here but
[3:55:07.720 --> 3:55:12.040]  uh we do have a the nebraska army national guard building here in town and
[3:55:12.040 --> 3:55:15.320]  i drove by there uh almost every day and i've
[3:55:15.320 --> 3:55:19.320]  really never paid any attention but the sign out front has been changed it
[3:55:19.320 --> 3:55:25.160]  used to be a chemical division now it's the 192nd law and order
[3:55:25.160 --> 3:55:28.520]  detachment oh so what do you think that they're
[3:55:28.520 --> 3:55:31.240]  getting you're getting ready for some civil disobedience
[3:55:31.240 --> 3:55:34.760]  some troops on the street certainly looks to me like it i mean
[3:55:34.760 --> 3:55:38.680]  uh you know martial laws coming and they know they're gonna have to
[3:55:38.680 --> 3:55:42.760]  need something to enforce it well you know i don't know about nebraska but
[3:55:42.760 --> 3:55:47.160]  our last caller from wisconsin they literally ruled in in local state
[3:55:47.160 --> 3:55:51.560]  government that it was okay for police officers to put a gps on somebody's
[3:55:51.560 --> 3:55:54.760]  car track and trace them and that's not stalking they
[3:55:54.760 --> 3:55:58.200]  they don't have to have probable cause they don't have to have a warrant
[3:55:58.200 --> 3:56:01.560]  it's okay to just track and trace somebody you think is a criminal so to
[3:56:01.560 --> 3:56:06.360]  me this country has gone to hell and they are integrating troops into our
[3:56:06.360 --> 3:56:09.800]  lives more and more remember they're here to help us the national guards here to
[3:56:09.800 --> 3:56:13.240]  help us and i saw them out on uh on july 4th
[3:56:13.240 --> 3:56:16.280]  weekend in new york i mean there is no shame anymore
[3:56:16.280 --> 3:56:19.720]  and they want a police state and the way to do that is to do it incrementally and
[3:56:19.720 --> 3:56:23.640]  start bringing in the national guard which the people are somewhat accustomed
[3:56:23.640 --> 3:56:27.800]  to seeing during a disaster to see on a regular basis so keep your eye out and
[3:56:27.800 --> 3:56:29.800]  give us updates i thank you for the call ken
[3:56:29.800 --> 3:56:33.480]  let's go to josh in michigan josh run line
[3:56:33.480 --> 3:56:36.680]  hey what's happening what is happening jason great show
[3:56:36.680 --> 3:56:41.400]  thank you brother okay i got a couple things i think everyone can benefit from
[3:56:41.400 --> 3:56:47.320]  when talking about our cause first is we have to appeal to the wants and desires
[3:56:47.320 --> 3:56:49.720]  of human beings and here's how we do it all to get right into the meat and
[3:56:49.720 --> 3:56:53.320]  potatoes when you talk to someone about any topic
[3:56:53.320 --> 3:56:56.920]  you tell them and i'm so happy to be talking to someone who's actually
[3:56:56.920 --> 3:57:00.520]  can understand me because out of everybody
[3:57:00.520 --> 3:57:04.520]  only half of the entire world is capable of understanding us
[3:57:04.520 --> 3:57:09.400]  and only half of them can even follow or even desires to understand us
[3:57:09.400 --> 3:57:13.320]  only dealing with 25 percent of the entire population
[3:57:13.320 --> 3:57:17.240]  for me to be talking to you right now is a great blessing
[3:57:17.240 --> 3:57:21.160]  and then you go from there on any topic believe me the people will
[3:57:21.160 --> 3:57:23.960]  be much more open versus just coming right out
[3:57:23.960 --> 3:57:27.400]  i agree man you listen you need to the way i always do it
[3:57:27.400 --> 3:57:30.440]  is i feel somebody out first let me give you an example in these final couple
[3:57:30.440 --> 3:57:34.920]  minutes and i thank you for the call i am in the local bar the only bar in my

[3:57:55.560 --> 3:57:58.200]  about some of this stuff but he doesn't know about all of it
[3:57:58.200 --> 3:58:01.720]  so i say hey i've got a a copy of my latest movie

[3:58:13.800 --> 3:58:18.520]  i can't believe them i had no idea about the majority of that stuff
[3:58:18.520 --> 3:58:21.960]  and i admire what you're doing and you just keep on doing it and he gave that
[3:58:21.960 --> 3:58:24.760]  to his friends his family and they're watching it this week
