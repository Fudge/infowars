[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:33.200]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones when it comes
[00:33.200 --> 00:42.560]  to the general police state and world government being openly rolled out this broadcast is basically
[00:42.560 --> 00:51.680]  becoming passÃ© so much of what I have specifically analyzed and warned people about just learning
[00:51.680 --> 00:59.520]  how the globalist operate worldwide is now right out in the open but on their master
[00:59.520 --> 01:05.800]  plan and what they're doing to our genetics and what they're doing to the earth's species
[01:05.800 --> 01:20.320]  flora on that subject my friends the public has really no clue just how serious the situation
[01:20.320 --> 01:39.760]  has gotten so I am going to attempt in the broadcast today to look at some of these different
[01:39.760 --> 01:47.400]  different facets that we face as a civilization and as a society Catherine Albright security
[01:47.400 --> 01:53.480]  researcher Dr. Catherine Albright will be joining us to talk about the waterfront of
[01:53.480 --> 02:00.480]  NSA spying issues you name it and the whole transhumanist movement coming up in the third
[02:00.480 --> 02:06.520]  hour today and popping in for about 15 20 minutes Brandon toy who's a resignation letter
[02:06.520 --> 02:11.080]  as a defense contractor has gone viral he's going to be popping in as well but we will
[02:11.080 --> 02:22.200]  also have open phones obviously we're going to get into the new expanding global terror
[02:22.200 --> 02:28.760]  alert and the controlled state-run media is saying obviously we've got to get rid of
[02:28.760 --> 02:37.000]  all freedom now after this devastating credible threat no one has seen anything so frightening
[02:37.000 --> 02:44.120]  and so scary aren't you scared general Aiden yes I'm scared aren't you scared general Alexander
[02:44.120 --> 02:55.040]  oh I'm very scared you watch this it's like a Monty Python skit I'm convinced that if
[02:55.040 --> 03:00.080]  Hitler would have said give up your rights America or Muslim extremist will get you
[03:00.080 --> 03:05.160]  that America would have run up in swastikas or something and bowed to Hitler or Stalin
[03:05.160 --> 03:11.920]  or any other authoritarian I mean this is just cuckoo level transparent and they're
[03:11.920 --> 03:19.160]  saying we got the same chatter pre-911 and they've just I've got videos pouring in all
[03:19.160 --> 03:25.480]  over the country an orgy of grandstanding with police just everywhere just setting up
[03:25.480 --> 03:29.920]  random checkpoints and running up people in grocery store parking lots I'm going to search
[03:29.920 --> 03:36.040]  you with no war and I do what I want and a homeless guy you know a cop gets in his face
[03:36.040 --> 03:39.840]  and homeless guy says what are you going to do bleepers as he pulls a gun out and shoots
[03:39.840 --> 03:44.920]  him in the chest and the police are going well we may allow that actually I mean it
[03:44.920 --> 03:51.400]  is all just going into hyper warp insanity and it's not just the government that's going
[03:51.400 --> 03:56.720]  crazy they believe they're above the law so you're seeing some of the most wild manifestations
[03:56.720 --> 04:02.560]  where where TSA people will just jump on top women now at the TSA or take their clothes
[04:02.560 --> 04:09.360]  off and run around naked screaming on God that's happened quite a few times or SWAT
[04:09.360 --> 04:13.280]  teams arrived at an animal sanctuary where they have a baby deer and with you know armored
[04:13.280 --> 04:18.720]  vehicles and machine guns and kill the deer and then write tickets and fines running around
[04:18.720 --> 04:27.200]  and crazy the general public and I know you're seeing this is losing touch with reality and
[04:27.200 --> 04:34.360]  it's because of television and the smartphones and all of it I mean we are going to see we
[04:34.360 --> 04:42.560]  are going to see societal meltdown and the culture is going to go crazy I'm afraid I'm
[04:42.560 --> 04:47.680]  afraid there's going to be large regional wars very soon and they don't even care of
[04:47.680 --> 04:51.920]  nuclear reactors meltdown now they just say that's healthy 90 plus percent of reactors
[04:51.920 --> 04:55.680]  are leaking I think you're going to see reactors blowing up I mean I just think you're going
[04:55.680 --> 05:02.600]  to see judgment judgment on this world are we choosing our own destiny or has it been
[05:02.600 --> 05:07.600]  pre-selected for us as we've moved through history every great leader has had to understand
[05:07.600 --> 05:14.160]  the potential of information billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking
[05:14.160 --> 05:21.800]  at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing
[05:21.800 --> 05:27.200]  machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions when somebody
[05:27.200 --> 05:32.000]  obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying if they can
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.320]  take total control of your awareness all of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead
[05:36.320 --> 05:41.480]  of the game how to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not

[08:34.520 --> 08:44.320]  and talk about just personal reflections that i'm having in personal quiet time when you
[08:44.320 --> 08:51.160]  are able to just briefly glimpse the secret place of the most high as the bible says in
[08:51.160 --> 08:55.000]  fact i wasn't intending to do this on air now but i i was going to do it later but
[08:55.000 --> 09:00.600]  when you guys pull me up the verse of dwelling the secret place of the most high i i i want
[09:00.600 --> 09:03.800]  to be able to read that full verse to people and even if you don't believe in god believe
[09:03.800 --> 09:08.760]  in spirituality believe in an afterlife believe in things outside of our five senses which
[09:08.760 --> 09:14.720]  we know are there in fact most of the universe is outside of our five senses and the sixth
[09:14.720 --> 09:22.080]  sense has been documented but but i had a real moment of clarity this morning well more
[09:22.080 --> 09:34.360]  than a moment it was about an hour of clarity and i want to try to feebly as i may transmit
[09:34.360 --> 09:39.800]  that information at least from my perspective and hopefully it can help you and then you
[09:39.800 --> 09:46.120]  can uh you know obviously comment on info wars dot com and call into the show and give
[09:46.120 --> 09:52.960]  me your take on it as well and together we can become stronger it's the 91st psalm he
[09:52.960 --> 09:57.680]  who dwells in the secret place the most high shall remain stable and fixed under the shadow
[09:57.680 --> 10:05.760]  of the almighty whose power no foe can withstand i will say of the lord he is my refuge of
[10:05.760 --> 10:14.680]  my fortress my god on him i lean and rely and in him i confidently trust that's right
[10:14.680 --> 10:20.760]  you've got to have a north star and all the psychological studies show this that the most
[10:20.760 --> 10:27.240]  free and prosperous cultures the world has ever seen have been truly christian the problem
[10:27.240 --> 10:32.960]  is is that the wealth that those societies create then creates decadence and the fall
[10:32.960 --> 10:43.000]  and we saw this with israel in its thousands of pre christian years when they would follow
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.520]  god's commandments and become incredibly successful and powerful and then become decadent and
[10:47.520 --> 10:53.560]  leave the commandments and then be overrun with the corrupt and then finally collapse
[10:53.560 --> 10:59.080]  and go into bondage but i want to say that verse again to everybody out there before
[10:59.080 --> 11:08.440]  i get into the news may we dwell in the secret place of the most high he who dwells in the
[11:08.440 --> 11:15.240]  secret place of the most high shall remain stable and fixed under the shadow of the almighty
[11:15.240 --> 11:24.640]  whose power no foe can withstand just saying that verse i can feel the secret place of
[11:24.640 --> 11:33.280]  the most high and i feel ashamed i feel ashamed of who i am and of all of my imperfections
[11:33.280 --> 11:40.000]  when i glimpse from afar the secret place of the most high i do not dwell in the secret
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.360]  place of the most high but just like the silver lining of a cloud i am able to see just the
[11:47.360 --> 11:55.600]  edge of it and there is great peace and great majesty therein and i think about what's
[11:55.600 --> 12:01.720]  happened in our culture i think about everything that i see and all the psychology and all
[12:01.720 --> 12:06.160]  the psychological warfare i've studied and all the public relations and pr that i've
[12:06.160 --> 12:12.920]  studied that i use none of i've gone and studied what the deceivers do and they themselves
[12:12.920 --> 12:20.600]  are deceived the most deceived they're now rolling out the fact that they have been deceiving
[12:20.600 --> 12:25.400]  us but claiming that it was for our own good that itself another deception within a deception
[12:25.400 --> 12:38.520]  within a deception but it really hit me an image of astronauts spacewalking this is my
[12:38.520 --> 12:45.080]  allegory or my analogy or my parable i've seen interviews with astronauts that have
[12:45.080 --> 12:51.280]  done the big extended spacewalks going out and working on the international space station
[12:51.280 --> 12:57.200]  working on their module working on their capsule working on the space shuttle when there's
[12:57.200 --> 13:03.920]  a problem going out to do repairs and they describe the first time you do it even though
[13:03.920 --> 13:09.000]  you've been trained when you come out and you're looking into the deepness of eternity
[13:09.000 --> 13:17.800]  and space and then looking down hundreds of miles towards the earth that it is a frightening
[13:17.800 --> 13:27.000]  but also exhilarating and gripping feeling and that you feel almost a zen timelessness
[13:27.000 --> 13:35.720]  of all that was is and will be and it's it's a thousand times that exhilarating but also
[13:35.720 --> 13:40.920]  frightening feeling to stand on the edge of a cliff looking down thousands of feet into
[13:40.920 --> 13:48.000]  a gorge and a river below and to feel a gust of wind blow from behind you and almost have
[13:48.000 --> 13:58.360]  you toppled down to your death you see eternity laying there before you and whether you consciously
[13:58.360 --> 14:06.200]  admitted or not your spirit your gut your soul your genetics your cells that grew out
[14:06.200 --> 14:11.200]  of this creation whether you believe or God or not you are part of this creation and connected
[14:11.200 --> 14:18.000]  to all of it you sense something a thousand times being on the edge of the cliff a thousand
[14:18.000 --> 14:25.360]  times spacewalking and experiencing something that humans and their entire development never
[14:25.360 --> 14:34.680]  experienced it is beyond that that you are in eternity and that we are all on an incredible
[14:34.680 --> 14:41.640]  spacewalk right now on this planet with all of this mystery and majesty and the relationships
[14:41.640 --> 14:48.920]  and the men the women the children your ancestors the people you currently know and those that
[14:48.920 --> 14:57.400]  will come in the future it is an epic epic epic adventure and then I see the general
[14:57.400 --> 15:04.040]  public and all the studies show this becoming more narcissistic more megalomania is popping
[15:04.040 --> 15:09.840]  up more people are going insane believing that their movie stars that their rock stars
[15:09.840 --> 15:17.480]  more people are becoming arrogant and spiteful and cheating their friends and family and
[15:17.480 --> 15:22.040]  thinking that because they have knowledge of evil and are engaged in it that somehow
[15:22.040 --> 15:30.600]  they've got power that's because they have no north star they have no secret place of
[15:30.600 --> 15:39.200]  the most time they don't even have a connection to that they can't even imagine that in their
[15:39.200 --> 15:47.240]  heart of hearts and so they're just running wild completely freaked out completely scared
[15:47.240 --> 15:53.760]  thinking oh Madison Avenue and Hollywood says that if I look like a supermodel I'd be happy
[15:53.760 --> 16:03.800]  and then you grow old and it's not about your grandchildren or your husband or your children
[16:03.800 --> 16:10.040]  are about helping orphans it's about how you're not beautiful anymore in quotes and so you
[16:10.040 --> 16:19.320]  degenerate and become a wicked old witch or you struggle your whole life and have a wife
[16:19.320 --> 16:24.160]  and children but you want to be a rap star or you want to be a rock star or you want
[16:24.160 --> 16:28.600]  to be a top basketball player or you want to be a movie star and because you were never
[16:28.600 --> 16:33.080]  able to do that you're totally unhappy and have a nervous breakdown I can't tell you
[16:33.080 --> 16:39.360]  how many people I have known throughout my life friends family neighbors you name it
[16:39.360 --> 16:43.440]  that don't become as successful as they wanted to be and then have a nervous breakdown and
[16:43.440 --> 16:48.880]  go insane all of you right now know people that have done that that's the most common
[16:48.880 --> 16:53.960]  thing that makes people go insane or they get incredible success and then go go on a
[16:53.960 --> 17:00.880]  power trip and go crazy when everything that you could ever want was right there friends
[17:00.880 --> 17:10.200]  family being honorable being loving being strong being heroic being true but the world
[17:10.200 --> 17:21.560]  tells you those things are a joke those things make you fail and the truth is that's a lie
[17:21.560 --> 17:25.800]  and it just hit me this morning I went for a jog for a couple miles and then walked
[17:25.800 --> 17:32.720]  back early in the morning and it was so beautiful the trees and the flowers and the rabbit I
[17:32.720 --> 17:41.080]  saw run across the path and a babbling brook staring into the blue sky that went on for
[17:41.080 --> 17:58.080]  eternity that I was gripped with the understanding of the cycles that humanity has gone through
[17:58.080 --> 18:07.120]  and it was so sad to realize how shuttered how closed in how dumb down how unaware of
[18:07.120 --> 18:17.320]  the average person is and it's been done artificially it's been done artificially by this sick modern
[18:17.320 --> 18:23.800]  culture and it's not technology itself that's evil it is the architecture of the way it's
[18:23.800 --> 18:32.480]  been deployed for full spectrum dominance is just a blasphemous crime against our species
[18:32.480 --> 18:38.840]  and I think about third world villages I've been in with poor children with cane poles
[18:38.840 --> 18:44.720]  with electricity in their eyes so happy to be staring into a beautiful stream catching
[18:44.720 --> 18:52.280]  fish and then I think about rich wealthy decadent children totally confused totally upset running
[18:52.280 --> 19:02.760]  to and fro to play dates and events and different activities desperately looking for fulfillment
[19:02.760 --> 19:07.920]  with their mothers and their fathers desperately looking for fulfillment when fulfillment was
[19:07.920 --> 19:16.600]  already there in the secret place of the most time and that the whole world is now been
[19:16.600 --> 19:25.200]  built even of old the old temple the old systems the old art of the secret priesthoods to suppress
[19:25.200 --> 19:31.960]  the fact that majesty and wonder and creation is all around us and that we are fulfilled
[19:31.960 --> 19:38.560]  by simply breathing air into our lungs and that we are now being put into a fully artificial
[19:38.560 --> 19:53.320]  cage an artificial habitat a giant electromagnetic gulag in the preparation for world mass extermination
[19:53.320 --> 19:59.280]  and it's all public it's all admitted the NSA is on record spying on the general public

[24:12.400 --> 24:19.680]  i want to finish up with just the desperation of our decadent society and we know where it's
[24:19.680 --> 24:24.160]  going a hundred percent it's it's historically a cycle and we know exactly what's going to
[24:24.160 --> 24:29.120]  happen and i want to i want to break down just in in generality what we're facing and then coming
[24:29.120 --> 24:35.440]  up exclusive Reuters reports the u.s. directs agents to cover a program used to investigate
[24:35.440 --> 24:48.400]  americans for common crimes and it goes on to say that marijuana you name it water in your lawn on

[24:52.560 --> 24:58.480]  fusion centers are for but then they play games and go we don't spy we just gather the data and
[24:58.480 --> 25:03.760]  the computer makes the decision so that makes it okay kind of like the family that googled last week
[25:03.760 --> 25:08.400]  the italian family in florida no criminal record it's nice family googled uh
[25:10.720 --> 25:15.680]  googled uh pressure cooker you know to order one i've i've got a couple pressure cookers
[25:15.680 --> 25:18.880]  that cook things i guess i'm a terrorist and then separately their kids were getting ready to go to
[25:18.880 --> 25:23.200]  school so the next day they looked up backpacks and so they got a swat team rape
[25:25.920 --> 25:29.280]  and remember the government runs al-qaeda on record we're going to get to the whole
[25:29.280 --> 25:33.920]  fake terror alerts all of it the next segment uh so some big news breaking right now
[25:35.360 --> 25:40.480]  while the globalist under international treaty wire all the electronics so they can
[25:40.480 --> 25:45.840]  surveil and take control of them and then go oh my gosh we need bigger government agencies to
[25:45.840 --> 25:52.000]  counter the hackers because now they can hack your smartphone hack your washing machine hack your
[25:52.880 --> 25:58.560]  smart meter hack your toilet that's luxury toilet users warned of hardware flaw the hackers may
[25:58.560 --> 26:07.440]  flood your house with them this is such a sick joke ladies and gentlemen we are building the pit
[26:07.440 --> 26:13.600]  for our own destruction by the way of an article uh out of reuters again they said there's an
[26:13.600 --> 26:20.400]  emergency with radioactivity spewing out of the five reactors that blew up in japan how many years
[26:20.400 --> 26:27.040]  are we into this now three months into it they caught yellowfin tuna and bluefin and the pacific
[26:27.040 --> 26:32.560]  off the coast of california so radioactive that just eating it is just guaranteed to take many
[26:32.560 --> 26:36.720]  years off your life the government decided to not tell you but it came out a year after they
[26:36.720 --> 26:42.160]  i mean boy let me tell you you know alarms go off in southern california on the reactors now
[26:42.160 --> 26:50.960]  what's their answer they turn the alarms off 91 percent of global reactors of 425 or whatever
[26:50.960 --> 26:57.280]  it is are leaking uranium plutonium everything else ladies and gentlemen to the point now they're
[26:57.280 --> 27:05.200]  just like you know what we're gonna let them leak don't worry about it it's like a science fiction
[27:05.200 --> 27:09.600]  movie like they're space aliens that live in a radioactive environment want to radiate it's
[27:09.600 --> 27:13.440]  i mean it's it's like you kind of think of some reason they do that but no they just have a death
[27:13.440 --> 27:20.320]  wish it's what psychopaths always do in history they just want to get caught they want to hurt
[27:20.320 --> 27:25.120]  themselves their own hard wiring even though they're consciously and spiritually a psychopath
[27:25.120 --> 27:31.760]  still the humanity in them wants to destroy them and so they they manifest so they want to destroy
[27:31.760 --> 27:38.960]  themselves with us of course along with them and that's what i wanted to get to people are freaked
[27:38.960 --> 27:44.560]  out by the fact that they're only alive once they're they're totally freaked out by the fact
[27:44.560 --> 27:48.960]  that they were born and they're living and then they'll die and they're on a planet where they
[27:48.960 --> 27:55.200]  you know dig up all these bones of woolly mammoths and sabertooth tigers and mastodons and 20 foot
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.400]  sloths that was just 10 000 years ago you know they think and then you go back before that there's
[28:00.400 --> 28:06.880]  all these dinosaurs and plesiosaurus and 50 foot long great white megalodon sharks and
[28:06.880 --> 28:14.320]  there's a big moon orbiting and rainstorms come by and lightning and just there's insects everywhere
[28:14.320 --> 28:22.000]  and bacteria i mean we are living just i just walk around marveling at an ant bed or at birds or at
[28:22.000 --> 28:31.120]  the sky or at my children or at just just a literature classical music i just it's just
[28:31.120 --> 28:37.600]  every day's a blessing every day's a bank what every day is just just an over-the-top hallucination
[28:37.600 --> 28:46.240]  of reality reality is an hallucination of consciousness
[28:49.040 --> 28:53.360]  what do you call an hallucination you know that's when your mind when you have a fever
[28:53.360 --> 28:57.360]  or whatever the case is distorts what it's seeing but i mean what do you call reality
[28:57.360 --> 29:01.120]  when you think about reality when you think about the nature of it when you think about
[29:01.120 --> 29:08.560]  what you could build and do they call that an hallucination no they call that thought and so
[29:08.560 --> 29:14.000]  deep down everybody knows that they are in the middle of just an incredibly heavy event
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.480]  and they sense that the establishment's gone insane and does not have their best interest at
[29:20.480 --> 29:26.640]  heart and now they know the system's lying to them so it's like a giant spacewalk or standing at the
[29:26.640 --> 29:31.200]  edge of a cliff and then people are running towards all the bobbles and all the fame and
[29:31.200 --> 29:37.520]  all the ego stuff thinking that is something they can cling to when it's not you've got to just turn
[29:37.520 --> 29:43.840]  loose in the sea of reality and then you will dwell in the secret place of the most time
[29:43.840 --> 29:51.920]  then you will suddenly realize there's something else there it's god we're on the march the empires

[33:28.160 --> 33:33.760]  planet dot tv why do we have the name prison planet well that's what's being constructed
[33:33.760 --> 33:38.960]  and that's not my opinion when i get up here and i talk about world government being established for
[33:38.960 --> 33:46.160]  forced population reduction of 80 to 99 percent depending on which globalist policy report you
[33:46.160 --> 33:52.640]  read that is not my opinion that is on record when i say the establishment plans to basically in the
[33:52.640 --> 33:59.280]  family that is on record as well and i've made films we've had countless guests on when you hear
[33:59.280 --> 34:06.720]  the radical things we talk about here on the broadcast need to understand that almost in
[34:06.720 --> 34:11.840]  every case over 90 percent of the time it's something that's already admitted on record i know it
[34:11.840 --> 34:16.000]  freaked out one of my reporters last week i said go look up these notes pull these articles
[34:16.000 --> 34:21.520]  since you've already done a report on this and pull up dinecore halliburton child kidnapping rings
[34:22.720 --> 34:29.600]  dinecore running the cps in most states cps having pedophile convicted pedophiles as their
[34:29.600 --> 34:36.640]  directors in states like florida and other states in the past look up snuff films connected to it
[34:37.360 --> 34:41.360]  and then about a day later she was real freaked out by it and said oh my god there's thousands of
[34:41.360 --> 34:46.960]  articles about this the un's involved they're all it's horrible the government's evil and i'm like
[34:46.960 --> 34:55.520]  yes they're evil i know and i think about all the people crying out in the darkness crying out in
[34:55.520 --> 35:02.320]  bondage all the women all the children all the innocence crying out to god or just crying out
[35:02.320 --> 35:09.600]  saying somebody help me and all these big churches just say you come here you pray you give us money
[35:09.600 --> 35:14.160]  you do what the government says you don't make waves that's how you help the innocent
[35:14.720 --> 35:19.840]  and the abortion continues and now the infanticide and the euthanasia of old people and and the
[35:19.840 --> 35:26.720]  television has taken over our culture and and society's breaking down and decadence is just sky
[35:26.720 --> 35:38.000]  rocketing and i prayed to god to protect me from the evil this morning and from the insanity
[35:38.000 --> 35:45.440]  that's going to be poured out on the people i mean i can intellectually look at everything
[35:45.440 --> 35:50.480]  that's happening and historically where it goes and the cycles of humans the cycles of decadence
[35:50.480 --> 35:58.480]  that are as accurate as an atomic clock or as the sun coming up in the east and setting in the west
[35:58.480 --> 36:09.760]  it is it is absolute fact that we are going to enter into something that looks like a high
[36:09.760 --> 36:16.640]  tech blending of every tyranny every oppression every nightmare system the world's ever seen
[36:16.640 --> 36:23.360]  with every psychopathic control freak demon with whatever their flavor of enjoyment is
[36:23.360 --> 36:32.880]  turned loose on the face of this earth and i'm just desperately trying to get people ready
[36:32.880 --> 36:37.280]  i've been trying to hold it back but i really have come to the realization it's not going to be held
[36:37.280 --> 36:43.600]  back all we can do is individually try to get ready for it and try to warn others so that if
[36:43.600 --> 36:52.640]  they have eyes to see ears to hear they can be warned and i'm very sad for people
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.600]  i'm very very sad for all the tough guy wannabes and all the crazy brave and
[37:03.280 --> 37:05.280]  all the trendies and everybody else
[37:05.280 --> 37:14.080]  i've just come to the realization that they're i'm not going to be able to help most people
[37:14.080 --> 37:16.640]  they're going to put cancer viruses in your children they're going to kill them
[37:17.200 --> 37:20.880]  early they're going to put poison in the water we're probably not going to get that out
[37:20.880 --> 37:24.240]  they're going to spray our atmosphere and get rid of the ozone layer for whatever reason they're
[37:24.240 --> 37:30.480]  doing it they're already detonated over a hundred hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere trying to
[37:30.480 --> 37:36.320]  ignite it our own government did that they even have discovery channel shows about it with William
[37:36.320 --> 37:43.760]  Shatner and they'll probably just go ahead and have more reactors melt down and they'll plant
[37:43.760 --> 37:50.880]  gmo everywhere and you know it'll go from a 3000 increase in cancer to a 10 000 increase like it
[37:50.880 --> 37:55.920]  is already in children it'll just everybody will just start dying and that's what everybody wants
[37:55.920 --> 38:03.040]  and that's where everybody's going to get so uh i'm more concerned about the soul of people
[38:03.680 --> 38:11.840]  as i realize that the flesh being attacked is only a symptom of the larger disease
[38:17.040 --> 38:20.640]  and at a certain point you just got to put the information out and turn loose
[38:20.640 --> 38:24.240]  because i realized fighting with people and desperately trying to wake them up
[38:24.240 --> 38:27.280]  they've been pre-programmed to withdraw from that
[38:29.920 --> 38:33.040]  so it's best to just tell people that well you've made your decision
[38:33.920 --> 38:36.000]  because deep down they all know the truth
[38:39.280 --> 38:44.800]  last night i went by myself after work at about seven o'clock to see a movie called uh
[38:46.160 --> 38:53.280]  the two guns or two guns with denzel washington mark walbert because i like both actors
[38:53.280 --> 38:59.040]  and i knew it would be a mindless shoot them up movie and it wasn't as good a shooter where
[38:59.040 --> 39:04.080]  it's really accurate false flag it isn't over the top the stuff he can do it's pretty realistic
[39:04.080 --> 39:07.680]  but in one of the best films out there to understand what runs our government
[39:08.640 --> 39:12.880]  and i don't know mark walberg and i haven't tried to get in touch with him but definitely
[39:12.880 --> 39:16.960]  that guy's picking scripts that you know are dealing with what's really going on this new
[39:16.960 --> 39:25.040]  movie has the cia dealing with drugs and has the navy and the marines dealing drugs and stealing
[39:25.040 --> 39:29.120]  money at the top and has the police involved in it
[39:33.840 --> 39:38.080]  the and the entire government's corrupt and evil and dealing with drugs and then they go that's just
[39:38.080 --> 39:43.600]  the way it is and i guarantee you walberg in washington probably thought oh this is good
[39:43.600 --> 39:48.320]  to expose the world really works but really it's just a coming out of the evil yeah the
[39:48.320 --> 39:52.640]  government deals the drugs yeah the government runs everything and we're still gonna put you
[39:52.640 --> 39:58.000]  in a private prison when we cut you using them and it was shot in texas and i haven't recognized
[39:58.000 --> 40:04.240]  some of the towns they have the state police in it uh it was pretty ridiculous uh overall not a
[40:04.240 --> 40:12.000]  very good movie uh but but the it's got the actor that plays chet and weird science what's his name
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.520]  what do you mean they got the power if you have phil paxton bill paxton
[40:21.600 --> 40:25.760]  but that wasn't the issue when i go see these movies like olympus
[40:25.760 --> 40:29.040]  fallen and stuff i watch who comes into the movie
[40:31.280 --> 40:36.720]  and these two special forces guys but very young i can even tell if they're special forces
[40:36.720 --> 40:42.800]  if they're cops if they're fbi uh if they're federal marshals i mean i can just profile now
[40:43.440 --> 40:49.600]  i test it i i asked them i watch these guys come in and sit down next to me and order their
[40:49.600 --> 40:54.160]  drinks and foods you can get food you know food and drinks at this theater it's almo draft house
[40:55.600 --> 40:57.360]  it's now going nationwide it's a great model
[40:57.360 --> 41:07.280]  and i'm sitting there and i'm looking in the audience and i'm watching the police
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.360]  because i'm not saying about a third of the audience was military police this is the movies
[41:11.360 --> 41:19.440]  that are targeting them and there were these army rangers sitting next to me
[41:19.440 --> 41:26.880]  as you can tell they're like gonna you know they're trying to go for special forces above that
[41:28.400 --> 41:33.120]  and i watch them glued to the movie and glued to the programming and glued to the military
[41:33.120 --> 41:36.800]  officers and them getting all chastened like you know like my dogs when i come in and get the
[41:36.800 --> 41:40.880]  dinner food out you know pavlovian way just right there and i checked and realized what
[41:40.880 --> 41:45.680]  little boys they were and at the end i left a few minutes early as i tell was about 10 you know
[41:45.680 --> 41:50.000]  walked out i wanted to miss the crowd and stood there and watched the very end and then walked out
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.320]  and i said hey are you in the army and then i looked at it went and of course these guys even
[41:54.320 --> 41:58.160]  had a little bit longer hair because i could tell they were involved in domestic operations
[41:58.160 --> 42:02.800]  they went to see this movie because see this is the main lining of it all and then i think i was
[42:02.800 --> 42:07.520]  like yeah how do you know that and i'm sitting there looking i was like i said oh i just you know
[42:07.520 --> 42:14.080]  i could tell and i got up and left but but i was i was um i went and saw olympus has fallen a few
[42:14.080 --> 42:22.160]  months ago and i saw the cop who had threatened to arrest me at the austin airport this was in
[42:22.160 --> 42:28.960]  far west austin where i went and saw it just to go analyze it and i see him walk in with his wife
[42:28.960 --> 42:34.480]  and he goes and sits down and he watches the movie and he's getting tears in his eyes during a
[42:34.480 --> 42:38.480]  fantasy of the white house being attacked and how this is real and then he goes and works at the
[42:38.480 --> 42:43.840]  airport and imagines the fantasy of real terrorists and north koreans attacking and i could pick out
[42:43.840 --> 42:50.320]  the other cops and the other militant i mean it's just fantasy land folks it's fantasy land one time
[42:50.320 --> 42:54.400]  they got navy seals guarding bush during the disputed election and i saw these navy seals
[42:54.400 --> 42:58.720]  walking along surveilling myself already dealt with secret service you name it covering it down there
[42:58.720 --> 43:03.200]  and i said what are navy seals doing here and they went jones mike hansel stand up and said they
[43:03.200 --> 43:09.760]  go we don't know how you know that and were blown away they turned red face like i was like i was
[43:09.760 --> 43:15.520]  Zeus or something i mean i'm i know i know what a monarch butterfly looks like i know what a raccoon
[43:15.520 --> 43:20.880]  looks like i mean i know what things look like i see it a couple times i know because you guys are
[43:20.880 --> 43:30.400]  all programmed you follow a program you follow a download you follow a body language so i know you
[43:30.400 --> 43:36.800]  because you're not real you are a biological android you've not chosen consciousness you were
[43:36.800 --> 43:43.360]  programmed by television you're there at the movie to be programmed reprogrammed upgraded with your
[43:43.360 --> 43:50.960]  newest baloney and you were all in there watching a movie where all the government agencies are
[43:50.960 --> 44:00.720]  dealing drugs and at the end they basically keep the money or it's left nebulous and the message is
[44:00.720 --> 44:05.760]  everybody deals drugs everybody's so ridiculous and it was all meant to target art types of the
[44:05.760 --> 44:12.640]  mexican drug dealers and the it's just so disgusting ladies and gentlemen let me tell you the drugs
[44:12.640 --> 44:16.320]  aren't sexy you know what it is it's a baby star of the death in a crib with flies all over it
[44:16.880 --> 44:22.480]  that's that's your manly drug dealing and and just the ridiculous posing of the guys with
[44:22.480 --> 44:27.120]  their guns and the way they and i see the cops and the swat teams and the tsa on the streets
[44:27.120 --> 44:32.240]  all like they've arrived it's like dress up why not just wear a crown like the queen of england
[44:32.240 --> 44:39.120]  and show up and say you've saved the earth but i mean it shakes me up
[44:42.640 --> 44:49.840]  that now i'm accurate about well i i mean i don't know the last few months i'll say so you you're
[44:49.840 --> 44:53.440]  a software engineering what you manage about 50 people are like how do you know that well
[44:53.440 --> 44:56.880]  awesome has a lot of them and i can see your bearing and you know see the way you're acting and i
[44:56.880 --> 45:02.320]  just seen so many software engineers and the way you're acting but also you have a knowing look
[45:02.320 --> 45:06.560]  like you've dealt with a lot of people and you know what torture that is managing people i mean i
[45:06.560 --> 45:12.880]  just i just i can profile people like that now especially government people i can tell a school
[45:12.880 --> 45:17.360]  teacher most of them are nice but you can tell the one at the park bossing their kids around
[45:17.360 --> 45:22.480]  acting real weird looking at you they'll start a conversation with you just to boss you around
[45:22.480 --> 45:28.560]  i can tell bureaucrats i can tell cops when they're off duty out some work as they feel uncomfortable
[45:29.360 --> 45:34.080]  i mean it's just unbelievable and i could see all the programming and the reason it's so easy
[45:34.080 --> 45:41.040]  to tell who you are and what you are and what you've done is because again you follow from birth
[45:42.320 --> 45:47.440]  what you've been programmed with well let me tell you what i'm following i'm following my
[45:47.440 --> 45:53.920]  instinctive programming god gave me i'm following what my ancestors did i'm following real survival
[45:53.920 --> 45:58.880]  instincts and i've accessed a weapons platform that all of us actually have
[46:00.880 --> 46:04.080]  all of you are intelligent ladies and gentlemen if you ever taught how to use it
[46:05.520 --> 46:12.960]  and we are weapon systems to adapt and overcome all those terms but it all becomes a bunch of
[46:12.960 --> 46:18.720]  meaningless chimpanzee behavior where they all bow down to the head gorilla that's what the police
[46:18.720 --> 46:25.520]  are the military all these fake hierarchies are four people that are followers and most people
[46:25.520 --> 46:31.280]  are followers at one level or another but these are hyper followers where you don't have any of
[46:31.280 --> 46:41.680]  your own consciousness and you are totally in bondage and the public is sold that somebody who's
[46:41.680 --> 46:49.200]  in the navy seals or special forces is like a superman and another person let me tell you
[46:49.200 --> 46:53.840]  their discs go out in their back they can't get out of bed just like you and most of them are
[46:53.840 --> 46:59.440]  little boys who physically can train and do a bunch of stuff and have been told are supermen
[46:59.440 --> 47:05.040]  so that they believe they can do more when nobody else is told they can do more see and
[47:05.040 --> 47:11.360]  and they're actually they're totally expendable to be used and then basically discarded
[47:13.520 --> 47:18.080]  and and that's why they target former special forces number one the most surveilled group in
[47:18.080 --> 47:20.480]  this country because when they become men and become older
[47:23.600 --> 47:29.520]  then they understand the propaganda and then they're truly dangerous because now they're conscious
[47:29.520 --> 47:38.880]  now they're tying in to their instincts their ancestors everything that is a real man or is
[47:38.880 --> 47:45.360]  a real woman and that's what the globalist fear is that you'll simply go back to being a human
[47:45.360 --> 47:50.560]  and and and it's magnificent we're made in the image of the creator and i'm sorry to do 47 minutes
[47:50.560 --> 47:57.200]  of preaching here today i've got all this incredibly important news it's just important to realize
[47:57.200 --> 48:08.480]  that when you serve the new world order consciously all of us make compromises nobody's
[48:08.480 --> 48:12.720]  perfect i'm not some Pharisee up here judging people if your heart's in the right place that's
[48:12.720 --> 48:24.240]  what god judges but when you start to move to make the attempt to change things there are also good
[48:24.240 --> 48:31.280]  forces in this universe and providence will come to your aid but you need to know you're not your
[48:31.280 --> 48:38.720]  own man you're not your own woman if you believe the hype of hollywood and the and the devilish
[48:38.720 --> 48:46.240]  music that targets little girls they already targeted the men with soft satanism in the
[48:46.240 --> 48:53.200]  80s in 90s they're now targeting eight-year-old girls with sexualized satanism in every major
[48:53.200 --> 48:59.440]  rap and rock and roll and pop music out there and the people go public and say i've been told to do
[48:59.440 --> 49:05.680]  this or i won't be on television why is that because the devil is real ladies and gentlemen
[49:07.600 --> 49:12.080]  call it a space alien whatever you want to call it there is a dark energy in this universe that
[49:12.080 --> 49:19.440]  wants to destroy humanity and god has given us free will to decide what we choose and again
[49:19.440 --> 49:23.840]  even if you don't believe in spiritual things there is evil the atheists will tell you there is an
[49:23.840 --> 49:28.880]  evil they're all just biological androids they're programmable okay well then why do the globalists
[49:28.880 --> 49:33.360]  want to program us because see they believe they have free will they want to take my free will
[49:33.360 --> 49:44.400]  i do have free will the great mystery is do all of us have free will there is undoubtedly free will
[49:44.400 --> 49:50.320]  that runs stronger in certain bloodlines the establishment knows that as well i have found
[49:50.320 --> 49:58.640]  the controllers themselves actually the the most evil are not even operating at any level
[49:58.640 --> 50:02.880]  as what you'd call a human possession whatever you want to call it they do not have free will
[50:04.880 --> 50:10.720]  some of their top generals some of their top enforcers have free will because they need the
[50:10.720 --> 50:16.320]  speciality of free will and the depth it brings to be able to defeat those of us that have free
[50:16.320 --> 50:21.600]  will but if anyone asks what my mission is it is to try to get you to unlock your mind to
[50:21.600 --> 50:26.800]  to to ask god into your heart you're not going to find in these churches but you will find
[50:26.800 --> 50:31.760]  when you ask god to come to your aid because god is waiting to come to your aid and that's what this
[50:31.760 --> 50:42.560]  society in this world needs i'm done preaching we come back oh oh exclusive Reuters the FBI

[55:20.800 --> 55:26.800]  but look at these headlines exclusive they tell you it's really not exclusive now it's safe for
[55:26.800 --> 55:30.720]  the controlled press that they've been authorized to report on this to put out what's actually been
[55:30.720 --> 55:37.920]  going on for at least 20 years everything you do on the phone cell phone uh faxes then emails is
[55:37.920 --> 55:45.680]  all tracked and it's then handed out to local police at the threat fusion centers us directs
[55:45.680 --> 55:51.520]  agents to cover up program used to investigate americans a secret of us drug enforcement
[55:51.520 --> 55:55.520]  administration yet so secret they've got a substation a half mile from our house
[55:56.400 --> 55:59.440]  and they all think they're movie stars i drive by they got all these new corvettes and stuff
[55:59.440 --> 56:03.360]  they use to set people up and all these women these good-looking women they've got as operatives
[56:03.360 --> 56:07.360]  you drive by them and they've always got their sunglasses stand around the parking lot talking
[56:07.360 --> 56:11.440]  to each other they're all movie stars you're all walking dead you've already been injected with
[56:11.440 --> 56:16.960]  cancer viruses by your masters a bunch of government drug dealers anyways excuse me let's
[56:16.960 --> 56:23.200]  continue here they use this the nsa i told you is to control the drug crate and take down anybody
[56:23.200 --> 56:30.480]  doesn't pay their cut but it doesn't matter your agents with the government and you drive corvettes
[56:30.480 --> 56:38.400]  so it's okay a secret of us drug enforcement administration unit is funneling information
[56:38.400 --> 56:46.800]  from intelligence intercepts wiretaps informants hey when i read some article we're in 5000 plus
[56:46.800 --> 56:51.120]  crimes were allowed to be committed just in one area by the fbi by their informants oh yeah their
[56:51.120 --> 56:57.760]  informants can kill whoever they want informants and a massive database of telephone records
[56:57.760 --> 57:02.320]  to authorities not servants their authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal
[57:02.320 --> 57:11.200]  investigations of americans and it goes on to admit that it's non-terror related although these cases
[57:11.200 --> 57:16.000]  were rarely involved national security issues documents reviewed by Reuters show that law
[57:16.000 --> 57:22.560]  enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly began not only from
[57:22.560 --> 57:28.800]  defense lawyers which is totally illegal but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges yeah
[57:28.800 --> 57:33.920]  because they haven't been let in on everything yet but as i told you folks i told you most police
[57:33.920 --> 57:38.560]  aren't let in on this even at the threat fusion centers let me explain it goes on to say that
[57:38.560 --> 57:44.720]  once they've already got the data without warrants they go and create or recreate a fake investigation
[57:44.720 --> 57:48.880]  what did i tell you about the millions of wiretaps where they do a rubber stamp that's only done
[57:48.880 --> 57:54.000]  phase two after they've already got the data they then go recreate the fake investigation
[57:54.000 --> 57:59.120]  now they're just getting rid of that entirely and of course this is all designed to also plant
[57:59.120 --> 58:05.920]  stuff on your computer they've planted on over 20 000 defense department employees last time i checked
[58:05.920 --> 58:09.280]  child porn and they come in and tell them they planted it and they better do what they're told
[58:09.280 --> 58:14.240]  down instead of all those people just standing up saying you planted it they're all going to do what
[58:14.240 --> 58:19.040]  they're told that's the end of the country uh the updated documents how many times you heard me say this
[58:19.040 --> 58:25.200]  hundreds the undated documents show the federal agents are trained to recreate the investigation
[58:25.200 --> 58:30.000]  trail to effectively cover up where the information originated a practice that some experts say
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.720]  violates the defense constitutional right to a fair trial it's not that they got the info
[58:34.720 --> 58:46.240]  illegally to begin with and created a fraudulent new investigation this is gcn the genesis communications

[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:38.880]  implications of that they found what the british empire found that if you just simply say that
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.840]  you're no longer an empire but continue operating as a corporate entity people will not resist
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:49.280]  or if you say an assault is not an assault they'll lay down while you knock their political
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:55.680]  and socioeconomic teeth out really through bureaucracy and regulation they're expanding
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:02.800]  the social engineering that has a fully 50 plus million boys in china than there are girls
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:08.880]  and that has caused a huge societal crises they're now trying to move forward with similar systems
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:14.880]  here in the western world so that's coming up after our guest is going to pop in leaves us
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:21.600]  uh also if you just joined us recapping our top story it really is big news because it's in
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.960]  Reuters and now people can admit it but you could go back 15 years ago i'm not bragging i just
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:30.960]  i'm pointing out this was public this is in the telecommunications act of 96 so i guess
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:46.080]  how many years ago was 1996 no no 1996 1996 1996 we're talking 17 years
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:54.080]  yeah 17 years i always tend to say 15 years because it's just time just keeps flying by
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.240]  hard to believe i've been on air more than 18 years they have the telecommunications act come out
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:04.720]  now and it paid nine billion dollars to put all these hubs in and to put the threat fusion centers
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:13.120]  in and to wire all of this and then all these major companies put out in their stock uh holding
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:19.760]  announcements uh and valuations what's going on i mean google in 2005 said we're using cameras and
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.640]  microphones listen to in your house we have ai computers store up all the data and then we run
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.920]  it through an algorithm and then we decide what ads to pop up and of course cnn last week of the
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:37.280]  headline your tv is watching you see now it's time to tell you well here's another one out of Reuters
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:44.480]  exclusive us directs agents to cover up program user investigate americans for marijuana uh for
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:52.800]  spanking their kids just just everything and it's all in these terminals at the threat fusion centers
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.360]  everything about you where you're at they can dial in and find where your phones out without a warrant
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:02.160]  they can dial in and turn your phone on to listen to you even when it's off they can hard code messages
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:09.520]  to your phone video text and audio even when it's off it reboots it and turns it on most phones even
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:15.360]  have a capacitor in them or even if the batteries remove they can do this or they can briefly power
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:21.840]  it up i mean they're hardwiring a technocratic takeover program and here's Reuters saying that
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.200]  once they get data for a prosecution without warrants they go recreate the investigation open
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.720]  up and get the warrant and it's totally illegal boom Reuters fbi pressures internet providers
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:38.000]  to install surveillance software yeah that's the cyber security act they can't pass so now they're
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.520]  just going even into small it companies with a hundred or more customers and threatening them
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:53.840]  to pay themselves to put the snooping systems in and the fiber optic back to fbi i mean beyond
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:12:01.520]  1984 here it is nsa secretly feeding spy until the police for petty crimes boom feds or suspects
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:11.680]  in new malware that attacks tour anonymity and they're loading it onto the servers of the companies
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.840]  this is wired magazine when you want to try to have your legal lawful privacy
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:22.320]  they are going and with their cyber command hacking in and loading it on google on record
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:27.040]  that's why they didn't get in trouble here uses their wireless cars to go around with government
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:31.360]  codes given to them by microsoft apple and everybody else to break into your computer
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:37.120]  and download everything including your codes i told you that a decade ago it's on record now
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:44.080]  because i have nsa sources i have fbi sources people say the sources have dried up we just broke
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:49.120]  with our sources through defense contractors and the intel hub and others that don't want to be named
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.120]  more of the urban warfare centers they've got where they are trading to take on the american people
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:13:01.360]  yesterday the answer to this tyranny is more whistleblowing ladies and gentlemen if something's
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:06.880]  illegal you have a duty to do now we're going to our guest here who i appreciate joining us today
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:15.840]  he's brandon toy and a few weeks ago his resignation letter went viral millions reddit military
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:23.200]  veteran himself former u.s soldier who served in bag dead in solder city neighborhoods as a
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:30.000]  military policeman he was a humvee machine gunner who trained and supported iraqi personnel and
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.600]  iraqi policemen he later joined general dynamics as an engineer project manager for developmental
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.680]  engineering projects general dynamics one of the largest defense contractors in the country
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:45.680]  he recently resigned in protest of america's dirty wars close quote we've crossed the line
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:52.080]  and done things that i thought our enemies did and further states i have always believed
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:57.840]  in every foot soldier threw down his rifle war would end i hereby throw mine down here's
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:03.920]  what i wanted to get a brandon toy on we have his his resignation letter just went up on info wars
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:11.440]  dot com we'll have it put back in the features uh so everybody uh can go read that uh but the issue
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:18.240]  here is that that's why they want to go to the drones and autonomous ground robots and basically
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:24.640]  looks like a tank that's autonomous and operates on its own hunter seeker i was uh a marine corps
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:33.680]  colonel in 1999 contacted me well i i've met him out in california at some urban events they were
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:40.240]  having and um well i'm in a contact who got me in touch with him and then i met him and uh he
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.720]  said look i can't tell you all the classified stuff but the plan is by 2020 to be a hundred percent
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.360]  human free he goes i don't know they're gonna reach that goal but he goes it's basically
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:56.000]  skynet well and i've been telling you that since 1998 1999 i guess it was 99 operation urban warrior
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.800]  and now you see all that being announced so understand that they know humans aren't going
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:06.080]  to go along with this that's why the foxcom factories are going to robots they've ordered was
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.080]  it 15 million of them five million already got delivered they're just telling the folks go out
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.760]  and die in the street they chain their kids up to go to work in the morning the power poles
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:19.200]  how are we going to compete with obama care against that and and again it's not computers
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.400]  as part of a normal evolution of technology it's being done to make us obsolete as bill joy the
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:30.080]  head of some microsystems wrote and why the future doesn't need us april issue 2000 of wired magazine
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:38.400]  so i want to explain it's now time for the whistleblowing it's now time to not go along
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.200]  with these illegal wars it's now time to say no because we get much further down this road
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:47.520]  another six seven eight years they're a little bit behind maybe 10 years it's going to get harder
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:50.960]  and harder folks where it's not going to that's why they're already ruining the military with
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:56.400]  women in frontline combat and all that because it's time to ruin it anyways and make it dysfunctional
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:03.360]  humans have free will they don't want that thank you sir brandon toy for joining us tell us about
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:08.800]  your experience in iraq as i don't have it your bio army or marines and just a little bit about
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:14.240]  your awakening and your letter and i really appreciate your courage in coming on well thanks
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:19.680]  alex thanks for having me on uh yeah i spent 2005 and back dead on the east side i was stationed at
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:26.720]  camp rustamaya and i was a machine gunner as you said and our mission was to train combat our troops
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:36.480]  iraqi policemen and iraqi national guard to basically takeover was the plan i spent the entire
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:40.800]  the year there came back went to school started to work for general dynamics it was an easy
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:46.720]  transition of course going from the military to a defense contractor and even in iraq i started to
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:52.880]  realize that this wasn't exactly what i signed up for uh and when i got home you know uh there's a
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:59.760]  lot of journalists whistleblowers activists who have come out with uh evidence of criminal actions
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:06.800]  by the united states military that i became aware of uh and i just i couldn't be a part of it anymore
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:12.640]  alex the last straw for me was when they uh the guardian and bbc arabic came out with
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:19.040]  it the expose on colonel steels dirty wars in iraq and i realized that when i was training
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:25.120]  iraqi soldiers and iraqi military policemen that i was actually training uh death squads and
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:31.600]  torturing units now i've got a partial bio on here and i read your letter last week were you in
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:37.200]  the army of the marines army you're in the army and for those that don't know there's been admitted
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:42.240]  death squads at least since vietnam and i even read where they use some latin american former
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:47.520]  death squads uh in iraq that came out in the news a few years ago uh and and now they've announced
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:53.200]  under india that they're establishing paramilitary secret death squad groups i happen to know those
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:58.320]  were already in the us previously with a sheep dipped army officers because i had a family member
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.520]  a great uncle uh who was actually uh involved in that even back in the 70s and 80s uh tell us
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:09.600]  about these death squads uh and uh what you saw being established well when i was on the ground i
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:14.880]  didn't really know that we were training death squads i knew that the uh forces had been infiltrated
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:21.680]  by the shea militias but i i didn't know no any torture or uh murdering was going on uh aside
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.240]  from you know what i saw in the streets uh it wasn't until i came back that i became aware of it
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:31.920]  and uh you know those uh i saw my time overseas as my shining moment in my life and uh to come to
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:38.960]  the realization that i was uh participating in war crimes um that big of war crimes was uh
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:50.320]  devastating talk about what constitutes a war crime um i think uh torture is a war crime
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:59.200]  murder um invasion a war of aggression is a war crime um i think uh you know there's lots of
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:05.440]  work you could find lots of examples absolutely and it's it's it's a crime against humanity
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:10.800]  what's been done to iraq the land's at medical journal estimated uh just a few years ago that
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.640]  was over a million dead iraqis because of the consequences uh of the war and around a half
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:21.360]  million before that from the sanctions alone uh unbelievable and i and i tell you the way the
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:27.440]  universe works in my gut i know just for americans allowing ourselves to be part of this this is
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:32.800]  going to come back on all of us yeah absolutely you can't take these kind of actions and not expect
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.760]  retribution the the things that our government is doing in our name right now are our criminal
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.560]  and and there will be retribution down the road well i agree there'll be some real organic
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.320]  asymmetrical resistance but i'm talking about just the way the world seems to work
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.520]  the retribution will be this evil will be done to us by our government here as well
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:57.520]  uh yeah that terrifies me but uh it seems to be heading in that direction alex and that's uh
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:03.520]  that's very scary why did you decide to resign uh from the defense contractor you were working for
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:08.880]  i mean i guess to make your stand tell us about your letter yeah sure uh after that expose came
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:13.120]  out that i spoke about earlier i i sat down i wrote that letter i was just i raked for about
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:18.560]  five days i didn't sleep uh my wife thought i was going crazy and uh i wrote the letter and i said
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:23.440]  this is it i'm getting out of here uh i no longer saw a line between being on the front lines holding
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:28.240]  a rifle over theater and working for the same people back home whether i was typing a deny a
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:34.880]  benign report uh managing a project uh whatever i was still working in the same power structure
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:40.720]  i didn't want to do it anymore i i thought and i felt one thing but my actions uh completely
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:47.760]  betrayed uh me and uh in my opinion my own country so i finally just i had enough i said listen i want
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:52.240]  i want to have my voice heard i want to make a statement i've been working 10 years for these
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:58.160]  guys i don't believe it anymore in fact i believe that uh these actions are criminal and the things
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:04.000]  that we're doing are are illegal i want to i want to come out very publicly and say that i'm not a
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.760]  part of it anymore and um and that's why i wrote the letter just recently we've seen a lot of public
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.800]  suicide letters where they say you know a different army and marines say i've committed so many
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:19.440]  murderous crimes that there's no way for me to even apologize and try to reverse it i'm just
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:23.760]  going to kill myself i wish they would do what you've done and just speak out and then try to
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:29.520]  reverse it that way and not kill themselves that only adds one more casualty to this madness god
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.600]  can always reprieve us even if you don't believe in god it's it's always possible you know in the
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:38.240]  works you do in this world to try to reverse some of what people have been part of plus people get
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:43.600]  lied to and sucked in it's easy to look in hindsight you know and say oh these people are evil but
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:48.560]  it's incremental it's peer pressure but when i read about these suicide letters and then i see
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:55.920]  somebody like private gruckheimer who back in uh 2003 was in the ithica journal and then on fox
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:02.320]  news he said oh we go in and kill entire villages because they're bad people we kill the men women
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:07.920]  and children and then the pentagon clarifiable only certain villages and for those that don't know
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:13.440]  why don't you describe the type of things that go on because it's been confirmed by general
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:18.640]  to goomba's own report of the army of what went on at abu graib and other facilities including the
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:24.480]  rape of children sanctioned in front of their parents i mean that is hellraiser type stuff
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:32.400]  that's despicable that uh is right up there on the level of uh you know nazism uh uh all kinds of
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.000]  bad things happen it's unfortunate that the american people don't see more but the mainstream
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:42.160]  media basically ignores the entire uh affair um if you if you didn't pay attention to alternate news
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.920]  would you even know the afghanistan war was going on anymore i've asked certain people talked to
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:49.680]  certain people about afghanistan and they said i don't even know we were at war there anymore
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:56.240]  the one thing that really bothers me is drone warfare uh in particular the december 17 2009
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:03.760]  attack in uh yemen that killed uh around natal 40 plus people uh a dozen or so children um at
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:10.400]  least a dozen pregnant women um these things happen on a daily basis they're substantiated
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:16.000]  there's uh scientific reports uh from independent third parties out you can go read about them
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.800]  that information's out there these things are documented sure they were taking place well
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.800]  i mean here's my issue there's going to be problems in war there's going to be casualties
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:29.520]  but when you get to the attitude of none of it matters and then reward kind of a psychopathic
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:34.000]  behavior you know you're in trouble and that's being consciously done we've been led to these
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.400]  wars via lies and and and now i see this being brought back domestically uh that's my point
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:46.320]  about this will come back on us one way or the other every day i see police now who are generally
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:53.120]  war vets shooting people that just mildly talk back to them and of course i know from the vets
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:58.400]  i've talked to that was part and parcel of behavior in afghanistan and iraq what is the
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:04.480]  pentagon thinking that alone acting like that will make you lose the hearts and minds so it's
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:11.520]  clearly a madness that i see going on uh from the top down can you speak to that yeah i think
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:16.320]  that the actions that we allow our government and military military to take overseas if we allow
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:21.680]  them to dehumanize people overseas treat them as less than human commit war crimes against them
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:27.120]  it's only a matter of time before they uh as you say uh bring that back home and start using those
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:32.080]  tactics back home i think we're already seeing it with the mass surveillance which is totally
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:37.760]  illegal but they're just doing it i love what does your wife and family say when you were
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:42.800]  about to give up an extremely lucrative long-term uh career working for one of the biggest defense
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:50.240]  contractors in the world are are are they supporting your your uh stance they've they've
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:54.320]  been very supportive everybody has been overwhelmingly supportive my family's obviously
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:59.360]  worried about how i'm going to make a living i have four kids i'm married um i'm i'm concerned
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:06.080]  about that too however i i just i want i wanted to get my uh voice out there i wanted to make
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:12.080]  this stand it was more important to me to make the stand than to have that security in that uh
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.960]  that those financial benefits that came around along with going along and giving consent to their
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:22.400]  actions was it a process or was it watching the persecution of snowden or bradley manning i mean
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:27.840]  what finally made you um go into the thought process of uh you know getting out of your
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:33.600]  main career field no it was absolutely a process uh i i started to become more and more aware of
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:40.400]  the things that were happening back when i enlisted i was uh completely brainwashed you could say uh i
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:45.280]  went along with it i was uh i thought the military was the greatest thing in the world the uh i went
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:51.280]  along with the invasion of iraq i was a cheerleader for it basically and uh over time i started to
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:56.320]  see things that didn't sit quite right with me and and when i i looked into it more and maybe it was
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:01.760]  just a a process of maturing but when uh hard evidence came out especially the stuff that
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:08.000]  bradley manning made known to the world and then edward snowden and the writing of clen greenwald
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.840]  and and many other people uh the more and more aware of it i became the more and more divided
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:19.760]  i became inside between who i really was and what i was doing what my actions were so there was that
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:25.440]  classic battle of the devil on one shoulder the angel on the other and the angel won out the angel
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:30.320]  did went out thankfully let me ask you this question because i've gone through this myself on other
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:35.040]  issues when i turned down a big contract to sell out or uh you know i go through something that's
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:39.200]  really when i'm being threatened and and and and it's almost like once i once you go through the
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.320]  fear of the other side did it feel like a giant weight was lifted off of you when you fired that
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:50.000]  letter out and then saw the validation of people resonating with it and you becoming an example
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.600]  for others uh clearly i would imagine the scheme of things reversing massively some of the bad you've
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:02.080]  done it felt wonderful i'll tell you uh the the place i worked general dynamics main headquarters
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:07.200]  is located on mount road it's a six lane highway i went out to lunch that monday before i shot off
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:11.440]  my letter and i drove back and forth and uh and i was listening to music just dreading going back
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:17.520]  because i dreaded going there uh uh all the time and and i just made this decision this is right it
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:23.840]  felt 100 right the only reason i wasn't doing it was exactly what you said fear of the unknown
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:27.840]  the uncertainty you know how am i going to make a living how am i going to support my family but
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:33.680]  once i made that decision i just i felt very right inside i felt it was completely the right thing
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:37.680]  to do now you asked me about when i hit the send button i'll tell you that was a moment that was
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:43.120]  very similar to when i signed my enlistment papers uh which is interesting you know i signed my
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:46.960]  enlistment papers i said there's no coming back from this you're doing this you sign this paper
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:52.240]  there's no turning back when i hit that send button i had the same feeling but this time you
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:56.800]  really did join the human family in the republic for the fight for the heart and soul of humanity
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.080]  that's happening right now and that's what's happening i don't know if you're a spiritual person
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:05.600]  but at a spiritual level i and i've never really had a spiritual show but more and more i see people
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:11.040]  are making their decision right now people are getting on on which side they're on and i just
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:15.840]  feel sorry for people that are choosing the wrong side or via peer pressure but this empire we've
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:21.520]  become you know it needs to stop and then they're funding al-qaeda so they have a threat to then have
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:28.640]  the nsa spy on us i mean it's just the whole narrative is falling apart it's absolutely
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:35.280]  disgusting the things they do to justify their illegal and criminal actions um the patriot act
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:39.680]  the name alone should tell you that uh that's something that we need to be absolutely uh
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:47.360]  infuriated by and uh afraid of uh anytime that you drape something in the flag like that and then
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:56.480]  use it to justify uh wildly just uh go go off the deep end with exactly what we've taken is is uh
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:02.320]  it's despicable really it's it's it's well this republic it is criminal was founded on ideas even
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:06.480]  though we never implemented them all about don't have spying have a small government individual
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:10.880]  liberty now all these senators like grandmothers get up there and say we've got to spy on you
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:17.440]  without warrants for your own good you know to defend freedom when they're butchering what america
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:21.920]  stands for in front of us they are the traders i want to come back and talk about how you're
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:27.440]  taking action you're not just going to resign and not you know help build the skynet system that's
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:32.800]  going to replace humanity basically that's the globalist plan you are also going to get on the

[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:34.320]  other news and open the phones up and katherine albert's going to be joining us on all the huge
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:40.880]  coming out of the nsa surveillance grid news it's coming out google you name it she's going to be
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:46.080]  joining us you know katherine's i've heard her on the air she's here on the genesis network i've
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:50.480]  heard her talk about getting up to stage three almost stage four cancer they were debating
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:56.880]  which it was and thanks to the good lord above beating it and it's in total remission right now
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:03.120]  uh that that made her not be worldly anymore that made her not be vain anymore not that she ever was
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:09.920]  that much but it really focused her to realize what's real and what isn't what matters versus what
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:15.520]  doesn't what matters is being good what matters is being informed and not being a slave and not
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:21.440]  buying into the sick hype that is american culture today this is the opposite of what this country
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:27.520]  was founded on and it is going to be good men and women taking action and speaking out against
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:35.360]  corruption everywhere not the diversions of msnbc that is going to save this society or the diversions
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:42.400]  of cnn or fox for that matter it is going to be about really historically looking where we are
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:47.200]  right now compared to other nations have done similar things of every other country in history
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:54.880]  that that did what we're doing we called evil all our history books our textbooks our common sense
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:59.760]  this is what the bad guys do you read the bible everything in the old testament new testament
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:05.520]  that corrupt empires did we do it now and of course the chickens are coming home to roost of
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:09.920]  course they're taking the private and public pension funds now there's not going to be anything
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:15.200]  left soon just like ross perot warned about nafta and gat these are all selectively written for
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:20.240]  insiders there's not going to be a defense contractor job in just 10 years or so it's
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:25.120]  going to be a handful of what there was because it's going to be robots building robots building
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:30.880]  robots servicing robots most engineers i talked to now say no one even knows how all this stuff
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:38.160]  works not one person not 20 people the computers the programs do it's already in the algorithms
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:45.360]  surpassed us and people like ray Kurzweil are toddling forward going i'm going to live forever
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:52.400]  i don't believe in god yet i will be god i will merge with the machines we'll squash the rest of
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:57.840]  you like a bug you won't even count we won't even think about you that's a quote will we get rid of
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:04.160]  you just like i step on a bug and don't notice it as if we're just going to let them decide our
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:08.640]  future as if they're even right about what's going to come out of this that's a question right there
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:18.720]  the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray we have a brandon toy uh on with us as
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:25.280]  servitors in iraq and some of the most out of control areas as a military policeman in the army
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:32.800]  and he uh i guess a few years after being there working in the private sector as a defense contractor
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:38.000]  uh just couldn't handle it and resigned a few weeks ago in his resignation letter that's up on
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:44.160]  infoworks.com that's been added to the featured area right we tell them to do that roger roger
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:49.760]  fantastic uh and so everybody needs to get that and send that back out to everyone so you can see
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:54.080]  what the real soldiers are saying and of course pat tilman started saying stuff like this and they
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:58.880]  killed him and even gave you a nice story about how he charged the machine gun nest of al-qaeda
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:04.240]  turned out it was friendly fire on purpose and the air force uh corner who they had to do the army
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:13.120]  autopsy uh there at the base said this was homicide it was another air force uh corner was also an
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:17.280]  army corner was involved secondarily said the same thing who said that uh ron brown that the
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:22.960]  commerce secretary was shot in the head she was a lot of good people that won't lie for the system
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.600]  and let me tell you something folks it's those men and women that are in government corporations
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:34.320]  private life that are holding back the total evil coming in that's how history works good men do
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:40.640]  nothing good men stand down good men serve evil for uh because of lies and all hell breaks loose
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:46.560]  because then every secret demon in the bad people is now in control no one's there to block them
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:53.840]  no one's there to say no because you're beaten over the head by 21st century propaganda but
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:38:00.560]  brandon toy understands the info war and that's why he is going to become a filmmaker and is doing
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.520]  a kickstarter program and i'm not involved in this but i think it's a great idea that's why
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:08.960]  we're having him on it's like we had the paul revere contest because it's about getting you to
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.360]  become filmmakers you to become radio bloggers you to become writers you to report on what's
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:18.000]  happening in your area doesn't mean you're perfect doesn't mean you have all the answers but you have
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.720]  a good heart you want to do good you've got to take action and together we will beat this
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:27.360]  technocratic takeover so brandon tell us about your kickstarter program i love the name of the
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:33.040]  film you want to produce it's more human than human and then we'll put it back up on screen i'll
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:40.000]  give them the full headline less than human again more human than human slash less than human
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:46.080]  brandon toy tell us about the film idea you've got sure alex actually it's more than human less
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:52.400]  than human and uh you can check out more information at uh uh more less human dot com that'll redirect
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.800]  you to the kickstarter uh project yeah let's put that back on screen for folks uh if their tv
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:00.960]  viewers and i'll give it out again for folks i was reading from the bottom of the screen uh more
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:07.760]  than human forward slash less than human what does that mean that means basically uh i want to i
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:13.360]  want to look at the causes and consequences of viewing uh certain populations certain people
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:19.840]  as less than human and other populations as more than human why do we uh violate the natural rights
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:25.520]  the human rights the civil rights uh of some people and view it as all right and other people
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:32.880]  we would never do that same thing too for example consider uh the reverse of a drone strike in
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:40.160]  yemen uh imagine that we uh committed a drone strike in manhattan we uh take an extreme example
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:46.560]  the new al-qaeda head was hiding out in manhattan and the cia decided that it was easier to drop
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:52.000]  a drone in there and they uh killed a bunch of civilians we would never accept something like
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.440]  that but we'll accept it if it happens in yemen or pakistan or another middle eastern country
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:01.440]  that we're not even at war with and it's not even because they're quote brown because they're
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:06.320]  bombing areas that have quote white people in them it's because the media has said it's okay
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:11.280]  because they're all terrorist exactly and if you remember we had this so-called national
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:18.480]  discussion about drones not too long ago and uh it focused on well can the does the government
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:25.920]  have the power to kill a u.s citizen and uh should that really be the question um doesn't matter if
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:31.680]  they're u.s citizen uh should we be killing anybody uh that we're not at war with uh by
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:36.800]  dropping a bomb from a drone on them uh and a lot of civilians are dying uh because of the
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:41.920]  criminal actions of the united well then i've heard talk show hosts say hey the war is terror you
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:47.760]  know we need to bomb more cities like in world war two uh which again hitler was terrible but if
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:53.200]  you actually really study the real history he was only bombing military bases in england and they
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:59.520]  did nighttime raids on berlin on civilian areas to trick the nazis to bomb civilian stuff so the
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.640]  infrastructure wouldn't get destroyed and to get the people behind the war and hitler played right
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:11.600]  into it and then that introduced the idea of unrestricted submarine warfare on civilians ships
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:18.080]  unrestricted bombing of whole cities i mean it's and then that led to bombing hereshima and nakasaki
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:25.520]  even though the japanese had already tried to uh give up days before they wanted to set the precedent
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:31.040]  that the atomic age had begun yeah this is not a new tactic the united states military has used
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:36.240]  this tactic as he alluded to during world war two in the uh fire bombings in germany uh in
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:44.160]  japan uh in vietnam and uh the drone uh program is just another example and it's i don't really think
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:49.440]  that it's intended to take out alcaldor targets i think its main purpose is psychological warfare
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:56.080]  to say hey uh you speak out against us you act against us uh we classify you as a terrorist we
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:00.480]  will kill you and anybody around you well it's more than that that's that's what they tell the
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:06.240]  troops on the surface in pakistan the globalist actually brought in 30 000 taliban al-qaeda leaders
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:13.760]  in the airlift of evil 2001 2002 that's you know bbc news ap royers and actually use them to destabilize
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:18.480]  i've had hameed gul their former top general line and i don't just trust him uh muhammad carzai has
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:23.520]  gone public now it isn't that that some of them aren't real terrorists real jihadis the issue is
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:30.160]  is that they create an environment to where then they can use them to destabilize the country
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:35.840]  and so it's just pure destabilization just like they're using al-qaeda in libya and syria right now
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:42.160]  and and and it's really the american people that give their consent to this program uh that's
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:47.120]  another reason that i resigned was i wanted to withdraw my consent uh not only the american
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:52.800]  people but the mainstream media uh are absolutely complicit in this because nobody talks about it
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:58.080]  it's not on the evening news it's not on the mainstream media news networks uh we just kind of
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:03.760]  ignored and accept it we we have consented to uh committing war crimes overseas how do people
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:08.320]  find your kickstarter campaign and donate to it or pledge to donate show that you can get this
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:14.400]  film made yeah go to more or less human dot com and it'll redirect you to the kickstarter page
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:20.800]  you can also search for my name at kickstarter dot com and uh you've already gotten 55 000
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:28.560]  pledge of the 27 000 gold really a 55 dollars i'm having yeah we just kicked it off yesterday
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:32.080]  afternoon you're the first one to get the word out i don't know i mean i was having a fruity
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:36.080]  and moment there because i'm so used to the success of these i bet you've got a hundred
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:43.040]  thousand dollars by tomorrow that would be absolutely amazing i know i'm very passionate
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:47.280]  about this subject passionate about filmmaking i want to draw as many people into this uh
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:52.080]  helping make this picture as possible so any ideas any offers of help are more than welcome
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:57.200]  not just financial support well that's fantastic and and and i'm interested in what you're doing
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:03.440]  just because of the idea of people not committing suicide over over you know having guilt and knowing
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:08.880]  they've done things that were wrong in the final equation but now going and and and you know
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:15.440]  a reproving what you've done a reprieve for society that's the answer let's talk about suicide
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:21.360]  they talk about it being what sevenfold previous records uh from any war more people dying uh
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:26.320]  from suicide than in combat uh what has that been like for you have you known anybody that's
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:30.640]  committed suicide i haven't known anybody personally but i can absolutely understand how
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:35.920]  someone can get to that point when your whole world is built up around this idea uh that you're an
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:41.120]  american soldier or you're part of the uh the establishment and everybody supports that that's
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:47.680]  how you make your your living um you're viewed as a hero because you went overseas uh that that
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:52.640]  that creates your identity and to go against your identity is a very scary thing especially
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:57.760]  when you have no support system to do so so uh people get very scared they feel trapped and
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:02.960]  they think the only way out is to uh end their life which is uh very sad i would say to anybody
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.080]  out there who's thinking about taking that course don't do it you do not have to stay in the system
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:13.120]  you do not have to continue to give your consent for anything that you find illegal criminal
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:17.920]  or otherwise now i know that general dynamics where you just resigned from a few weeks ago
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:21.920]  they actually make some of the latest drones that are out there what were you working on there
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:28.160]  i was working on the striker combat vehicle uh it's an eight eight eight wheeled uh vehicle
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:35.520]  platform what do you make of the deployment now it was 2000 this year but about 5000 the last four
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:41.840]  years uh more than 7 000 uh the big war wagons that they've given to homeland security the open
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:48.720]  training for quote combat with the american people saying now that gun owners returning veterans uh
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:54.160]  that uh they are the number one threat not al-qaeda i mean they're clearly trying to flip the script
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:59.280]  now off of muslim extremists that they've helped finance in many cases on the american people
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:05.520]  yeah i hadn't heard about that alex but i'm not surprised uh like i said when when you
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:09.920]  start taking and using these tactics overseas it's only a matter of time before they start
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:15.280]  seeing the people at home as enemies too and they always want to squash anyone who speaks out against
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:21.840]  them if they're a whistleblower uh an activist otherwise if you speak out against the uh the
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:29.280]  power elite you will uh feel the wrath you know you look at uh the the former head of google he
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:35.440]  still advises that eric schmidt who says you have no privacy you look at uh the head of uh things
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:40.240]  like facebook zuckerberg saying as users are dumb efforts for trusting them but then they're obsessed
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:44.720]  with their privacy and have their girlfriends in the case of schmidt where hoods over their heads
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:50.720]  like michael jackson's kids i mean how do they think they're going to build this technocracy
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:56.240]  and then they're going to get away with it i mean the elite never get away with stuff when
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:01.360]  they build a tyranny smart elites even if they're not moral historically and i've had a lot of top
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:05.840]  historians on to agree with me they want to build something that has some checks and balances
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:11.520]  i mean this is madness what they're setting in motion it's absolute madness you can draw parallels
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:16.800]  back to uh totalitarian totalitarian states of the past and when you kind of wake up and realize
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:21.520]  that this is our government the united states government that's doing this the uh uh baseball
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:27.360]  and apple pie and all that that you grew up with the the the flag waving and and kind of try to
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:32.080]  reconcile that with the actions that you're seeing uh it's hard to believe but these things are
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:36.080]  taking place they're documented you can go out there and find lots of good information solid
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:43.280]  information on this stuff and uh it's happening sir it's it's it's been very informative and
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:47.120]  uplifting to have you on just to know that we can have folks that have been through terrible
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:51.920]  things like you've been through because you're a victim of this as well uh of the american people
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.640]  buying into mass delusion just like the nazis and the soviets did and it's great to see you
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:02.720]  you know helping turn the tide i think we're starting to turn the tide and that's why they're
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:07.280]  kind of coming out with everything now in an attempt to hide it in plain view what's your
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:12.800]  take on where we stand as a civilization i hope so i think more and more people are coming to
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:18.960]  realize that uh these actions are taking place because of brave whistleblowers like bradley
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:23.440]  manning and edward snowden who are coming out with evidence that they can't deny more people
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:29.600]  are starting to wake up and i also agree with you that they're getting more and more overt in their
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:35.200]  illegal and criminal actions which is terrifying i'm worried about the country but i think there
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:41.120]  are a lot of people here who will stand up speak out act when it's time to act well they're trying
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:45.680]  to demoralize us they're trying to break our will they're using military tactics on us but
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:49.680]  i found it's our military men and women they're the easiest to wake up because you guys are
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:55.600]  aware of these tactics and go wait a minute this is being used on all of us and so you guys are
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:00.160]  going to not be as naive as the public so as much as we can criticize the military for being involved
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:04.080]  in a lot of bad things there's a reason homeland security says you're the number one enemy once

[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:49.840]  spying on you but private corporations and what they're up to in the next hour we'll open the
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:57.680]  phones up for Catherine Albrecht as well but whenever i get into this nsa news you have to
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:02.640]  understand and i'm going to play these clips as well when clapper the head of national security
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:09.520]  uh our national intelligence and then when the head of the nsa and the head of cyber command
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:16.000]  general alexander come out and say we're not spying on any of you we promise i'm going to play those
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:21.120]  clips and then it comes out they're recording everything they don't call that spying they call
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:26.400]  that intelligence that they're playing all these little games with people and now it's in Reuters
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:34.800]  today oh they hand off criminal info criminal what you like oh you built a barn in your backyard
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:40.400]  that came out years ago that the nsa was giving satellite info to local environmental ordinances
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:46.080]  to the local police i mean see that's how i already knew all this that's what's so frustrating is that
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:50.960]  they didn't want you knowing about this 15 years ago so they denied it now they're they're going to
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:57.120]  use it against everybody and really roll out the tyranny they can't hide it anymore i told you a few
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:01.840]  times last month that they don't like having to go get a warrant after they've already used illegal
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:09.120]  intelligence spying to go bust people for petty crimes so now they're just going to say you know
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:15.760]  what we're not doing any of that anymore no more due process no more nothing this is their revolution
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:21.760]  against the republic their revolution against law and possession is nine tens of the law and they're
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:28.240]  just doing it openly right now and everything else will go your guns your speech it's all going
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:34.960]  the borders the sovereignty your pension funds your security your due process it's like blowing a
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:41.760]  hole in a spaceship the atmosphere of the spaceship goes where into space you need an atmosphere folks
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:48.240]  the bill of rights constitution due process is the atmosphere of a free healthy country where you
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:54.480]  can have companies where you can contract with people where you've got a rule of law collectivism
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:57:00.480]  and a ruling government that's not accountable is called tyranny and the fruit that comes out of it
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:04.880]  is worse than what comes out of the end of a horse at least you can use that for fertilizer
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.560]  it's not right to call the globalist you know brava seara because that's calling them something

[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:06.240]  people more according to their search history i mean this just shows how the ai system is meant to
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:13.040]  game everything just like walmart game to the small towns and shut them down just like
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:20.480]  you know amazon gamed all the bookstores and shut them down you know what happens when all the
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:25.120]  little bookstores are gone then amazon can do whatever it wants you know they'll be exempt from
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:31.680]  taxes but you won't they get special consideration then your online bookstore ism makes it very hard
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:37.120]  to run an online bookstore i'll tell you i have one info or store dot com yeah there it is websites
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:42.800]  very prices deals based on users information wall street journal print that for me i want to just
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:48.000]  because this is everything she exposed on the customer loyalty cards and and and you know you

[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.240]  to waive my rights so what i'm reading can be given to people well so what they already know
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:26.480]  that's usually what a slave says and see i mean i see people all the time going well i don't care of
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:32.480]  if uh you know these companies go bankrupt i don't know any stock in them or i don't care i

[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:45.680]  want front row seats to hell folks you're going to get it and people say well there are too many
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:52.160]  people and i agree there are unsustainable too large a number of people in some areas of the world
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:56.560]  because of other technologies being suppressed once you industrialize people they quit having
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:02.480]  more than two kids doesn't matter whether they're japanese or italian or or a hispanic american
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:06.560]  family or a white american or black family it's these third world populations that have a bunch
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:13.200]  of kids because they haven't been conditioned yet not to have them artificially but you don't even
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:19.760]  have to do that because once people become wealthy they stop having as many children
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:23.920]  but it won't matter with new technological development and if they would stop blocking the
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:29.520]  development you're going to absolutely be able to launch space colonies they've had the designs
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:34.640]  for that for at least 50 years verner von braun had some of the designs for that for the type of
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:40.400]  model of the artificial gravity with the big spinning wheel i mean we need giant projects like
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:47.760]  that that humanity gets behind before we expend the resources that we're based on right now while
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:52.480]  the globalists block the development because they want to use the artificial scarcity of the old
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:57.680]  resource paradigm to consolidate total control over everyone well they're i by
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:04.720]  are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us as we've moved through history
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:10.160]  every great leader has had to understand the potential of information billions of dollars

[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:26.240]  told you day one uh so uh that and there's another article is the government exaggerating the threat
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:35.280]  of terror for political reasons uh again dube grizzly bears live in the woods do bears eat honey
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:44.880]  in the woods do bears uh fish for salmon in the woods do bears crap in the woods i'm i'm sorry it's
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:49.440]  just i read this headline washington's blog is awesome but it's like a rhetorical question
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:55.360]  does the sun come up in the east in the morning does the easter bunny have pink ears all right
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:59.600]  ladies and gentlemen it just i shouldn't be laughing about it i just smell false flag you're
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:04.720]  like this is as scary as a new 9-11 this is what happened last time get ready we're gonna get hit
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:12.320]  we need the nsa we need obama we need al qaeda al qaeda and we're going you've been funding al qaeda
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:17.360]  you've been giving him heat-seeking missiles let's let's look at drudgereport.com the genius
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:24.640]  of why all marvel at drudgereport.com can we punch that up just this weekend i'm working on
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:29.440]  obama deception too and i said we've got to update this with these new fake terror alerts
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:34.480]  in early on in the film and i want to show people you know them saying brace for al qaeda attacks
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:39.840]  closing embassies and then cut to duck and cover and the kids being told you know there's a hydrogen
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:44.480]  bomb being dropped on you jump out of the desk there's nothing it was all about fear it was
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:49.120]  they later admitted it was to create a climate of total fear while our government gave reactors
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:53.760]  and nukes to the russians because our government's defense contractors who want to keep you know more
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:59.360]  sales going you understand and drudge gets it because i mean i'm thinking this here yesterday
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:04.240]  putting it in the film that this is duck and cover bull and and i haven't talked to drudge i haven't
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:09.840]  talked to any of his crew but let's put it up there and they get the exact same thing not because
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:16.960]  we happen to have similar brains we happen to have brains that get reality exactly what i've
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:22.400]  been talking about exactly what i said in a saturday night in a sunday meeting with the crew up here
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:31.200]  i've been in seven day work week mode right now big time so that's just some of what we have oh
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:37.200]  and by the way roiders has the exclusive the threat fusion centers and local police are given
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:45.520]  petty crime info marijuana building a barn you're not supposed to the nsa satellite video photos audio
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:53.040]  everything is given to local police and then the local police that are part of this become federally
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:57.520]  deputized so that violates local control i mean it violates everything and now they're going let's
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:02.240]  just get rid of it all together because we don't want to go open a fake investigation to act like
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:07.520]  we got the info for the indictment or whatever some other way and also came out in u.s. today that
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:15.040]  well in the case of uh uh boston alone they allowed uh informants to commit
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:23.040]  5000 plus crimes murder you name it well of course that they work for them they go out and kill
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:28.240]  people that don't pay their cut the organized crime in this country is let's say the names fbi
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:35.600]  the names fbi cia defense intelligence i mean folks i have family a lot of family that was in the army
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:41.760]  and i've been to family reunions and things where i mean it's it's like i guess that's the only jobs
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:46.160]  or something in each texas where this person was in the cia and this person was an air force
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:51.440]  intelligence and this person was sheep dip special forces and this person was that i mean i i knew
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:59.840]  about all this stuff before i was out of high school people would read the newspaper and laugh
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:04.720]  about it i mean because it but it it it's just totally sick ladies and gentlemen it's totally
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:10.320]  sick the government runs the drugs they run it all you understand grow up grow up grow up grow up
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:14.160]  grow up grow up grow up and that's why now i'm going to go to catherine albert for the balance of

[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:32.880]  new revelations mean but first briefly chris and in this case we didn't get in trouble with one
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:36.480]  and stuff you don't want to tell the story but he said he will if i want him to during the last
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:40.640]  segment i said when i'm at barns and noble or a grocery store anywhere and they keep going hey take

[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:21.600]  well so what they're already know what you're doing the point is it's wrong and the point is they use
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:26.720]  this data to game the prices i go i'm actually a national expert on this when they start disagreeing
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:30.800]  with me and i go have you heard of dr catherine albert i say if you heard of info wars dot com

[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:06.080]  telling the story and then you're saying she said a month ago this happened yeah that was the the
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:11.040]  last time was i'll let him three times it was it was just a little while ago she said and you came

[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:30.800]  and after that that's when you that's when you started in with the the alex speech about you know
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:36.640]  not not signing up for customer loyalty cards or giving anybody your personal information about things
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:43.120]  and then tell the rest of the story you had to leave the party yeah yeah it got a little heated

[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:41.360]  don't you think alex because i think edwards note in did a lot did a lot to wake people up
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:46.400]  i think now i what i've heard from a lot of people i didn't believe you 10 years ago i mean
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:52.320]  i've had random people that i can't even remember looking me up uh emailing me out of the blue
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:58.880]  telling me i'm so sorry i didn't believe you now now that it's all coming true and now that uh
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:04.320]  you know npr is talking about it now i believe you and you know so so yeah i think i think people
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:08.240]  would wish that we would shut up not because they want us to shut up necessarily but because
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:12.560]  they want the things that we're saying not to be true and i think you hit a certain point where
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:17.040]  edwards note in saying it and pr is saying it cnn is saying it everybody's saying it
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:21.360]  and really the only difference is we've been saying it longer and better and louder and we
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:27.760]  give you more details well said i'm gonna come back and get into the snowden situation the

[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:33.840]  has so far beaten cancer and it's in remission or total remission we'll get the tales from her
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:39.120]  in the next segment and i wanted to get her take on i know she's been talking about this some of
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:44.480]  the scams out there people claiming they can cure cancer uh there are certainly things you can do
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:48.320]  that prevent it there's certainly treatments that have shown they're promising that are alternative
[02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:54.000]  but when people say they can fix it well i tell you that is a lie and we're going to be talking to
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:59.520]  her coming up in the next segment about that but but getting into the whole NSA thing uh kathryn
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:06.400]  as you know Reuters came out today and and and admitted okay they're actually giving it to
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:12.240]  local police for petty crimes they're spying on farmers everybody is being watched uh and then
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:17.280]  we've got clapper and we've got alexander and all these national security frauds saying oh we
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:22.080]  don't spy on you even though it's admitted they're doing it what do you make of all this
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:30.000]  it's it's shocking isn't it and i think even now alex we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:34.880]  this just the little bits that are leaking out the little bits that we're being told the little
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:39.920]  bits and pieces here and there i mean edwards edwards noden told us he kind of took the lid off
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:46.480]  but now we're starting to see each little slimy thing crawl out and i think it goes far beyond
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:52.160]  what we're even being told now the the amount of information that's being kept on us even the
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:57.040]  information that's being kept on us on the prep in the private sector is mind-blowing you know
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:01.040]  you know you've been talking a lot about the show and on your website uh about some of the stuff
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:05.280]  i've been talking about for 15 years you've been talking about it too the fact that even in retail
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:10.240]  environments that they make the mannequins have cameras in their eyeballs that are watching us
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:16.960]  the stores hide microphones in the shelving and hide little tiny cameras to see how you respond
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:22.480]  when you read the label on the back of the cheerios or when you pick up the american express brochure
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:26.800]  at the check stand that the that it whole foods they were actually right there in austin they
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:31.840]  were experimenting with two-way um television screens where they would have a screen up and
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:36.400]  it would say here's how you prepare quinoa or whatever and then while you were watching it
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:40.640]  the screen would be watching you back and determining your demographics this stuff is
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:46.240]  because it's invisible in a way it's being built into the world all around us and there's nothing
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:51.920]  more invisible than someone else's ability to grab a stream of bits of zeros and ones
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:56.480]  and capture your personal information going through the internet so i think we are just
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:27:00.160]  beginning to see the tiniest little crack of it i think if people really understood the
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:05.600]  immensity of it it's like a it's like an iceberg is the analogy i often use you see the little
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:09.760]  tiny bit on the top and you're overwhelmed oh my gosh look at all that awfulness if you could see
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:15.600]  the huge thing floating underneath there capturing everything about you you know i i like to think
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:20.400]  i'd like to finish that sentence by saying if you could see it you would do something about it
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:24.800]  and that's really i think where you come in where i come in where start page comes in where start
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:30.800]  mail comes in where hopefully every technology company out there that wants to stay afloat
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:34.960]  during this time comes in and begins to offer things we can do about it we need to work on
[02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:39.600]  this politically socially culturally we've got to educate we've got to inform we have to train
[02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:44.480]  our children differently we've got to take advantage of these alternatives out there we've got to
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:49.120]  change or it's just going to be more the same catherine albert's our guest let's shift gears
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:55.520]  back into loyalty cards what you first started exposing uh a long time ago 14 15 years ago
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:28:01.360]  and now they come out the wall street journal mpr high end stores use facial recognition tools
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:07.840]  to spot vip's charge you more websites vary prices deals based on users uh information
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:12.320]  they charge people they think have more money more money or if you visit say a yacht website
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:16.240]  then when you go visit something else they charge you more i mean this this is what we're talking
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:22.640]  about and then i am called evil for nicely trying to educate a barnes and noble person
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:27.760]  who tried to pressure me into taking one of their cards that's that's evil to them well they don't
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:32.880]  want to know that it's happening really because you know and and what happens is if we don't educate
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:36.240]  people then it's going to become this status quo because when i first started working on
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:42.320]  shopper cards in 1999 nobody knew that the shopper card was collecting your data and then i remember
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:49.200]  about maybe 2005 2006 that i was talking to a 15 year old girl and she said catherine i think it's
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:52.720]  really great you're doing protests and you're opposing these shopper cards i really hope you
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:56.800]  win but i just have one question if you get rid of the shopper cards how is the store going to
[02:28:56.800 --> 02:29:02.080]  know what you bought and i went oh my gosh you are completely missing the whole point but of
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:08.080]  course you're 15 you can't remember a time when they didn't have these cards so the the time to
[02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:13.280]  fight it you only have about a five to ten year window on any of this stuff because by the time
[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:18.400]  it it infiltrates society for five or ten years you've got 15 year olds who are going to look at
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:22.240]  you like you're like you're out of your mind when you say that it's not a good absolutely and they
[02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:26.640]  don't get that when everything's digital and everything's smart as they call it the globalists
[02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:31.600]  can hack it control it turn it off control your thermostat which they're now saying i mean this

[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:20.560]  but when you actually look at the details then i think we've struck the right balance
[02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:27.040]  and if people can't trust not only the executive branch but also don't trust congress and don't

[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:10.720]  because it's got a bunch of well-meaning conservatives that think government is god
[02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:17.760]  another little girl got taken from her pot smoking parents for pot smoke and then got her
[02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:22.960]  brains beaten out you can go see the video of the little blonde hair little girl got her brains
[02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:26.640]  beaten out of course nothing's going to be done to the people that did it they'll probably get
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:31.840]  awards or something and might as well have firing squads for kids now might as well oil police boots
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:38.080]  with baby blood but don't worry you're all gonna have your life ruined too you're not being given
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:45.680]  all this satanic power for nothing you're gonna be destroyed as well by your own system so enjoy
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:52.960]  here let's scroll down the little girl there she is but they got her and they're gonna get more don't
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:59.760]  you worry 60 plus percent of foster children nationwide are on average of seven psychotropic
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:06.640]  drugs when they cry for mommy they drug them and if they catch you with marijuana in your car or
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:11.120]  you go in to get your blood taken for something you're going to have a baby and they catch any
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:15.200]  marijuana in your blood even if it's a false positive you're never seeing your kids again
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:22.560]  because child kidnappings worth a lot of money in this country just just the federal funds they
[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:28.640]  get to string your kid out on drugs and all the sicko pot belly pedos they pass your kid around to
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:35.200]  nobody's coming to help them either no only god's coming to burn this world up because
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:40.640]  it's what you want all of you lovers of evil that won't do anything all those kids in darkness all
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:44.720]  over the world begging for help right now all the new order tortures the daylights out of them
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:51.280]  while you sit there and preen yourselves and all feel fancy and powerful and cool and all your sick
[02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:57.360]  narcissism and watch your sports center yeah you're real manly out there aren't you
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:03.920]  tell your stories like that make me just sick i can't even play the newscast i can't even look at
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:10.240]  it and i see them every day with their killing foster kids especially the little babies they beat
[02:36:10.240 --> 02:36:17.360]  their brains out and never get in trouble they lock them up in cages they drown them they rape
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:23.840]  them they kill them they malnourish them and it's just whenever they go oh well there'll be problems
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:28.960]  in the state custody the most dangerous place in the world is in state custody hands kather i'm sorry
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:34.320]  to go off into into darkness here i get really depressed by this sometimes uh i just hope all
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:38.720]  the evil people realize their party's not going to go on forever what do you think about the increase
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:43.440]  in evil that's going on i mean it's definitely there we're a cursed nation we're a cursed world
[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:48.640]  diabetes up several thousand percent cancer up several thousand percent everything that's going
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:54.160]  on the test score is dropping the iq is dropping what's happening katherine you know it's horrifying
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:37:00.480]  isn't it and you'd think that with all of this surveillance that that kind of stuff would stop
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:05.600]  but the reality is it's the other way around the more of that stuff we get the more surveillance
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:09.200]  they give us and then the more of that stuff we get and then the more surveillance they give us
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:15.360]  and it's it's an escalation so you're you're not going to find a situation where the the more
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:20.000]  surveillance we got the better of a society we're going to wind up with it's never worked
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.640]  that way in the past it's certainly not going to work that way now the people who are doing
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:29.280]  these kinds of things oftentimes are the very first to get on board with the nasty technologies
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:33.440]  one of the things i did and you know this because i was down in i was down in austin visiting you
[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:38.560]  guys there at the info war studios but also i headed down to san antonio and i interviewed
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:45.920]  a man who has worked with over 20 000 sex offenders within the state of texas alone there's a horrifying
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:50.000]  website where you can go online and you can see where they release these people out into the streets
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:54.320]  and they're supposedly surveilled you know they're not really they just they just give you a map so
[02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:59.840]  you can see where they are and i interviewed this man who's worked with these people who've
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:05.520]  done time for their crimes against children and what he told me chilled my blood alex he said
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:09.840]  you know that that rfid tracking program that they had with the chips around the kids next
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:15.680]  down in san antonio that you couldn't turn off it was on day and night that could read um the that
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:21.040]  sent a signal outside their homes even at night when they were sleeping he said that the people
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:26.400]  that he counsels that that they fantasize about technologies like that that would enable them
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:32.000]  to select particular victims and then drive down the street and see when they're home drive down
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:35.760]  the street and see when they're at school figure out if they're in their gym and that's right and
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:41.280]  predators just like them built this to do that and to be able to use the artificial intelligence
[02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:46.720]  to beat the good people it's it's it's a mindset and it's an evil mindset and it's a mindset that
[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:52.160]  says if i can get enough information about my victim whether my victim is the taxpayers who
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:58.720]  i want to continue to to fund my lifestyle whatever that is or if my victim is you know some poor
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:05.200]  innocent child who who these these depraved people fantasize about harming then the the way
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:09.600]  that they want to go after their victims in every case across the board is to get knowledge about
[02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:14.480]  the victim because once you have the knowledge you can use the knowledge at that point to try to
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:19.360]  figure out where the vulnerabilities are and to try to figure out where the points of pressure
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:24.240]  are i mean even take a look at the the whole irs scandal where they weren't funding political
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:27.920]  groups that they opposed you know tea party groups groups that held different views than
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:32.960]  the than the prevailing power structure and they said okay well let's find out who they are and
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:37.360]  how do you think they find out who they are will they go on all these websites they use all of this
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:42.320]  infrastructure that's being built silently and that's how they figured out so for example you
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:47.360]  know i can't tell you alex the part that makes me crazy how many people who want to know better
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:52.960]  continue to participate how many people who uh... you know i i give speeches all over the country
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:56.720]  and i'll fly out and the person picking me up you know you typically is the person who arranged
[02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:01.040]  the whole speech of katherine you've got to tell everybody in my group about you know this terrible
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:05.920]  stuff and privacy invasion and then they're driving me back to either my hotel or to the
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:11.280]  conference center and they have a toll transponder on the windshield of their car and they just zip
[02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:16.080]  right through the toll booth and i have to stop and say you know that that toll transponder on your
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:21.840]  car is turning your car into a constant tracking device are you aware of that oh yeah well i don't
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:26.560]  really want to go there you know it's it's stupid stuff like that the people ought to know better
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:29.920]  you know if we were living in the soviet union they would make you have that thing if you took
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:34.720]  it off your car you'd be going to jail into the gulag we don't have to have this stuff so why do
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:41.520]  we participate it's the same thing using yahoo for your email you know as of june we told everybody
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:46.640]  we we even did a press release through start page we told everybody your yahoo account
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:52.000]  is going to be read they're reading everything for quote abuse prevention i've heard from people and
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:57.200]  i'm sure you have to i had one guy write me and say that his yahoo account was suspended for 24
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:41:02.400]  hours on quote suspicion that they didn't like what he was writing you know this is going on why
[02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:06.800]  are we putting up with it and by the way no amount of surveillance does anything is the evil people
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:12.720]  run at this little girl alexander alexandra hill and i'm showing a photo of her that makes me want
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:19.760]  to cry because i have two daughters uh she would come to they they took the daughter because they
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:25.600]  found out one of the parents smoked marijuana she would come beat up bruce starving to visitations
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:35.120]  mildew all over uh and then they bashed her brains out and uh this and the texas youth commission is
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:40.720]  probably one of the most demonic in the country and williamson county is a feeder for it williamson
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:45.760]  county is a satanic group of people and i want to just warn everybody folks do not go to williamson
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:52.560]  county do not enter it do not take your children through it okay and i just i i don't mean to
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:57.520]  digress i just look at this story in this photo they they knew she was being abused in the government
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:03.360]  camp they knew she was being abused by the devil worshipers that run this country they knew she
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:08.080]  was being hurt and wouldn't help her so the surveillance is there to make sure good people
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:13.520]  can't ever bring them to justice catherine well i i think you're right because take a look at what
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:18.720]  happened when somebody found out that there was illegal activities occurring within the government
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:23.440]  and i'm of course referring to edward snowden you know what what did they immediately do did
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:28.960]  they immediately say oh thank you for pointing out the criminal wrongdoing so we can go address the
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:36.000]  problem and make it stop no they turned around and said what revealing criminal activity is itself
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:41.200]  a crime and therefore now we're going to hunt you down and you know that's the message across the
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:46.000]  board if you had had discovered that this little girl was in trouble prior to anything actually
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:50.000]  happening you know it would have been a toss-up had you gone to the authorities whether they would
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:56.160]  have listened to you or worse yet if they would have gone on a rampage against you and now your
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:43:00.080]  records would all be under surveillance and under the microscope so they could figure out how to
[02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:05.280]  shut you up and shut you down and make you look like the criminal so it's really it's a brilliant
[02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:11.440]  psychological and technological merger here where they make the whistleblowers into the criminals
[02:43:11.440 --> 02:43:17.200]  and you know there's not a person listening and you know every single person here that you couldn't
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:21.600]  find something that you googled that you emailed that you did that you purchased that you something
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:26.000]  that if you slanted and twisted it couldn't be used to make you look bad that's why they want all
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:31.760]  this data that's one of the many reasons why they want the data because it enables them to to twist
[02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:37.200]  your arm and if you think you're the only victim of it every single member of congress i am guessing
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:42.880]  has had their phones tapped their email surveilled everything that they do is under the microscope
[02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:48.640]  so that if they ever step out of line or if they try to vote in in a way that would not further the
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:53.360]  powers that be then they can use that information against them and blackmail them and you know when
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:59.040]  when you hear the stories politician x was having an affair you know i especially mean to go back
[02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:03.600]  to the head of the cia right so you know i mean if there's ever a guy who knew how to keep his
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:09.040]  information out of the hands of the spy agencies you think it would be him and even he you know
[02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:12.960]  what he i don't know who he crossed i don't know what he did to make them mad at him but i'm sure
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:17.440]  they said listen you play ball with us or we're going to take you down because we've got information
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:22.240]  and they say that to every person within the highest levels of government you play ball with us or
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:26.560]  we're going to take you down because we've got all your email and your passwords and surveillance
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:31.520]  video and footage and everything else of all your crimes well listen here's an example of this
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:36.880]  family father to foster child who died speaks to kvue we have the article up on info wars.com
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:42.720]  neighbors they're not sure somebody smelled pot late at night their daughters asleep they smoked
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:48.720]  some pot uh watching a movie you know good hard working parents and they came and took her the
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:53.840]  kid and a month later she was dead and he describes going to see her once a week at mcdonald's for
[02:44:53.840 --> 02:45:00.320]  an hour where they was allowed to see her bruised up beat up uh you know uh mildew all over and they
[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:04.080]  just laughed at him and then they you know then they beat her brains out you know that's what they
[02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:09.600]  do and i mean they're and they're not gonna i mean it's just it's so demonic the government is so
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:15.520]  filthy and degenerate and all the police who are part of this and all the cps workers you're all
[02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:21.440]  got it you're all going to hell i'm telling you there is a god god hates you i certainly hate you
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:27.600]  and you will be brought to justice this is a sick filthy degenerate system and it's the spy system
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:34.240]  it's it's the tattletale cruise what type of people would say they smelled pot so then the cps comes
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:38.640]  and then why do you even let them in folks the government's not your friend it's what i'm telling
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:46.640]  everybody it's evil it's evil i'm sorry go ahead well no it it's you know the bible tells us this
[02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:53.120]  to alex that as we get further further into these crazy times that were that were not only going
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:57.680]  into but were fully in that people are going to turn you know people are going to turn against
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:00.800]  the truth they're going to turn against the bible they're going to turn against church they're going
[02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:05.360]  to turn against parents are going to turn against children children against parents we're going to
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:12.240]  see an increase in depravity you walk down the street and you see you know people wearing openly
[02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:18.560]  horrific blood dripping fangs on their shirts and tattooing it onto their bodies people are really
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:25.600]  conveying this this this attitude of absolute horror and we're going to see more of it you know
[02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:30.960]  the as as things heat up this is going to be the tip of the iceberg and you know you you had talked
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:35.760]  about bringing me on to discuss cancer we're seeing this not only played out this the sort of
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:41.280]  increasing sickness of society is going to start manifesting itself physically mentally emotionally
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:44.960]  people are going to start you know we're going to see that suicide rate which is at record levels
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:50.240]  going even higher we're going to see the levels of illness hitting people younger and younger
[02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:55.200]  cancer patients being hit in their 30s and even their 20s now with breast cancer you know it's
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:47:00.000]  it's permeating our society because we're not only destroying the physical world we're destroying
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:04.800]  the emotional and the social world we're destroying the political world also the natural order has
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:09.440]  ended in the past if somebody killed your kid you'd you'd go after them and i'm telling you
[02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:14.240]  there's this idea now well the state just kills our kids and and you've got them in the news saying
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:20.720]  let's kill babies after they're born i mean we are just a demonic nation well who's going to stand up
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:25.840]  for this little girl because you're right a hundred years ago had had somebody bashed in the head of
[02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:32.720]  a little girl her brothers her uncles her her grandfather her dad somebody would have would
[02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:36.320]  have taken a shotgun and gone and taken care of business i mean i hate to say it it's just well
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:42.640]  would it happen and at that point whoever did that would never do it again nowadays you know we we
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:48.560]  sit back and and we hope that the proper channels take care of these no they just bureaucratically
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:52.960]  covered it all up it's what they do well where you get into trouble is when the proper channels are
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:57.840]  the cause of the problem or when the proper channels are are turning a blind eye to the
[02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:01.680]  problem because if you revealed the problem then you'd you'd probably lose your job i mean think
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:09.120]  about the the immense sums of money that are being spent on social services and if they actually came
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:14.080]  out and admitted that those social services were not working then society is going to have to either
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:19.280]  dismantle them or or kick them all out and start i'm going to say this i see it in my mind's eye
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:24.400]  my gut but intellectually stuff is already starting to collapse i can officially tell people
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:31.600]  that that that society is starting to collapse especially in america i mean are you did you
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:36.560]  agree with that analysis i definitely feel something is shifting and i think it's shifting you know i
[02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:40.880]  i do a lot of travel in the last couple of times i've flown this summer i can't tell you how many
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:45.680]  kids have been alone flying on planes like across the country i flew from manchester new
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:50.880]  hampshire down to tampa florida which is 1600 miles and there were kids on that plane and
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:55.120]  that you know the stewardess was like where you go oh i'm going to go see my daddy you know a big
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:59.920]  part of this is that the kids don't have families anymore it's all over i've been reading the bible
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:03.760]  cover to cover and i just i think it was a new zeke alam to remember exactly where it was no it
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:09.680]  wasn't as he killed anyway one of the one of the curses that god visits or visited in the old
[02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:15.680]  testament on societies that turn their back on him he actually says your children will be fatherless
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:22.800]  and i thought oh my gosh talk about the turn on any show the message of the new world order is
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:28.160]  dads are bad who needs a dad yeah just go raise the kids yourself you and your lesbian partner you
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:32.480]  can you can form a household of your own and you know actually yet you know on the shows like the
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:38.160]  fosters it's the cop woman and the cps worker and they go harvest everyone's children and the bad
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:44.160]  guys on the show are the biological families yeah well you know more than half the time when they
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:51.360]  say missing child on the on the milk carton it's a dad just wanting to get access you know to to to
[02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:55.600]  be a father well it's families that have gone and gotten their kids back and run and then they're on
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:49:59.920]  the news is terrorist because they don't want fat pedophiles raping and bashing their children's
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:04.720]  brains out well and you got to be careful when when when we hear about these you know amber

[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:15.680]  creep off the street just grabbed a kid and more likely you know even the breathless headlines
[02:50:15.680 --> 02:50:19.920]  when i click through and i look further and i actually dig down deep what i find out is it's
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:25.760]  it's apparent that's right it's time to stop going along with the system to remove our consent
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:31.680]  to research cases and we know it's innocent people running from the pedophile army we have to protect

[02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:28.800]  is on our doorstep and we're just one more trigger away from a devastating disaster and when that

[02:59:09.360 --> 02:59:15.760]  state education to the hollywood media brainwashing machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the

[03:00:30.640 --> 03:00:34.960]  i'll get this case up on prisonplanet dot com and info wars dot com were neighbors said they
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:39.680]  smelled marijuana so the cops come bust in good hardworking parents take their little
[03:00:39.680 --> 03:00:47.040]  two-year-old daughter she gets beat up torn up evidence of torture abuse uh they were trying
[03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:51.760]  to keep her up in the demonic williamson county but they do this everywhere for marijuana for
[03:00:51.760 --> 03:00:57.360]  recreational use of marijuana and the judge that took that child and did it is just as guilty
[03:00:57.360 --> 03:01:01.200]  just as guilty as the woman that they've now arrested and are charging with beating the
[03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:06.560]  girl's brains out may go ahead and make your excuses you people make me sick kathryn albert i'm
[03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:11.440]  sorry i went off on a jag i saw this article i read about it i watched the newscaster in a break
[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:19.120]  and it physically physically made me beyond angry and uh but i guess that's a good thing is now i
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:24.720]  can probably work till midnight tonight without a break i mean it we need where is the instinct
[03:01:24.720 --> 03:01:28.800]  i mean i saw a commenter there in the comments saying you know the founding fathers would have
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:33.120]  burned down all these facilities and hung all these people and i'm not calling for that but
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:36.800]  they're burning down our liberties how much of this are we going to take kathryn are you seeing
[03:01:36.800 --> 03:01:40.960]  all the cases now where the where the cops will just shoot somebody for no reason just because
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:45.600]  they feel like it and then they're they're being defended i mean this is demonic now we're getting
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:52.000]  to a place where human life is not worth much and i think a lot of that is i hate to say it i think
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:56.960]  it's video games i think it's media i think it's the fact that the average person by the time they
[03:01:56.960 --> 03:02:01.440]  hit 18 is seen you know hundreds of thousands of murders in cold blood right in front of them
[03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:06.960]  and we're absorbing poison you know garbage in garbage out we're absorbing poison one of the
[03:02:06.960 --> 03:02:12.960]  things i decided to do i don't know 10 more than 10 years ago was was get rid of my tv you know
[03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:18.640]  stop absorbing it and it was amazing because not only did it stop all of those creepy feelings you
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:22.880]  know when you're home alone at night and you hear a noise or you're lying in your bed i don't have
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:27.360]  that anymore i don't have those awful nightmares i used to have i don't have any of that and the
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:32.400]  other thing it it also makes you not believe the lies that there's a terrorist under every rock
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:36.800]  you know when i go to when i travel in a minute airport and i you know look up and there's the
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:40.560]  santa in camera it's always trying to scare you with something and i look at that and i'm like
[03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:46.240]  this is such nonsense people believe this but if you live on a steady diet of consuming that all
[03:02:46.240 --> 03:02:50.960]  day long oh there's terrorists oh you need the government to protect you well you like get into
[03:02:50.960 --> 03:02:56.160]  the fantasy land it's like a three-year-old believing my little pony's real but the adults
[03:02:56.160 --> 03:03:03.360]  really buy into this well they do because i think it's in a way it's reassuring you know that i my
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:08.560]  own life is crazy i've lost my home you know people are going through tough stuff so is they think
[03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:14.480]  how terrible their own lives are they want to think that there's some big strong parents in charge
[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:19.200]  and i think that's one of the reasons they buy into all of this because this argument that you
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:24.800]  have the homeland security is going to keep you safe well things may be going to hell around me i
[03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:29.600]  may have lost my marriage and my home and my job and my everything else but at least i've gotten
[03:03:29.600 --> 03:03:35.840]  you know big mommy a big sister big brother daddy out there looking out for me and and man kicking
[03:03:35.840 --> 03:03:40.160]  butt overseas oh man and liberals that believe in government are the ones that really get fed on
[03:03:40.160 --> 03:03:45.360]  by these cps and people because they don't know how deadly it is yeah well yeah exactly and they're
[03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:49.840]  the ones who tend to want to go into that line of work and and actually want to be part of it and
[03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:54.240]  then once they get in there they they discover how corrupt it is and the system either spits them out
[03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:59.200]  or they just conform to it it's just like politics you know you get yourself elected on the local
[03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:05.360]  level you can make some change but getting elected on on any kind of large-scale you know federal
[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:09.760]  level you're either going to conform or you're going to get spit out unless of course you're
[03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:14.080]  ron paul i think he's got some special kind of spiritual dispensation to be able to swim with
[03:04:14.080 --> 03:04:18.400]  the sharks and and not become one and not get eaten but but everybody else it seems like even
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:23.600]  with best the best of intentions they get out there and then they just become a a part of the
[03:04:23.600 --> 03:04:28.000]  system i agree we're gonna come back take a few calls and get into the cancer issue but
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:34.080]  we have to make a break with it we have to decide we're against it and decide that's what we value
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:40.080]  and stop going along with peer pressure when the peer pressure is not conformity to common law and
[03:04:40.080 --> 03:04:47.760]  a good culture but conformity to to a culture of synthetic death a culture designed to rewrite

[03:08:19.440 --> 03:08:28.960]  from austin texas alex jones all right we're going to your phone calls with dr canton albert
[03:08:28.960 --> 03:08:33.840]  i'm your host alex jones let's talk to chat in florida you're on the air what's your question
[03:08:33.840 --> 03:08:41.520]  or comment for our guest sir um i have a question about biometric scanners we just uh got one
[03:08:41.520 --> 03:08:45.360]  installed in work and they want to take my fingerprint if they don't get my fingerprint
[03:08:45.360 --> 03:08:50.560]  but i can't work and i haven't done it yet fortunately well unfortunately i've been
[03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:57.440]  off work for a uh injury and i'm just wondering how do i fight this how do i stop this i think you go
[03:08:57.440 --> 03:09:03.120]  to the top people in the company and and and you explain why it's dehumanizing how the biometrics
[03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:07.600]  can be stolen later how it's part of a plan to make you do that to get on the internet for internet
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:14.000]  id worldwide and as a tool of control that's been the official plan kathryn yeah you know it's hard
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:18.080]  once they've already picked a vendor and they've already invested in the technology i have talked
[03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:24.160]  to literally scores of people who have contacted me and said my company is is doing something like
[03:09:24.160 --> 03:09:30.000]  this some companies even doing like vein scannings or or full hand scans now they're even talking
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:33.520]  about doing iris scanning and some of these companies oh no no that's going in colleges and
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:38.400]  high schools now you got it well of course because if you can get the kids ready to accept it then
[03:09:38.400 --> 03:09:43.600]  once they become employees they don't even blink then then it's easy to scan them so this generation
[03:09:43.600 --> 03:09:48.880]  i think is the resistant generation while they work on our kids and get them you know showing
[03:09:48.880 --> 03:09:53.040]  fingerprints to get food talk about pablo by the way the violence policy center about 12 years ago
[03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:58.080]  in the paper said it doesn't matter what mr jones does when i caught bribery going on they said
[03:09:58.080 --> 03:10:04.560]  in the paper we've got your kids mm that sounds just like hitler doesn't it but imagine the exactly
[03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:10.320]  the arrogance of we've got your kids in the yeah well that was hitler's whole thing you know i don't
[03:10:10.320 --> 03:10:16.160]  care about you grown up germans because i've got the hitler youth and we're not seeizing your kids
[03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:20.320]  and and that's all that matters because that's the future you'll grow old and die who cares about you
[03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:26.720]  so i i wish i had a better answer for this i have not seen too many people successfully go up against
[03:10:26.720 --> 03:10:33.040]  their company's policies on things like this and actually succeed one of the things that i would
[03:10:33.040 --> 03:10:37.760]  recommend for really anybody out there see if there's a way that you can work for a small independent
[03:10:37.760 --> 03:10:42.960]  privately owned family owned company or better yet start your own private yeah we've got to try to
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:49.280]  only shop with small or or medium size or family regional stuff that and then communicate with
[03:10:49.280 --> 03:10:54.640]  those companies to say i want you to hire locally i want you to be anti-big brother i want to work
[03:10:54.640 --> 03:11:00.080]  with you exactly so i think we need to be supporting those kinds of businesses that do the right thing
[03:11:00.080 --> 03:11:04.880]  we need to be boycotting the kinds of businesses that treat their employees in this particular way
[03:11:04.880 --> 03:11:09.920]  and help to further this this ugly thing that's coming and you know i i have to say i've worked
[03:11:09.920 --> 03:11:14.640]  for myself or i've worked for private schools i've worked for small uh independent you know i've
[03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:18.960]  always kind of done my own thing and i've never been asked to do anything like that i realize
[03:11:18.960 --> 03:11:23.040]  it's a lot to ask for people to think about completely changing you know their entire lives
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:27.520]  and again some say what's wrong with this we're not bad it's that the people designing
[03:11:27.520 --> 03:11:33.040]  the major the major architecture do have a bad aim a total cashless society folks
[03:11:33.040 --> 03:11:37.760]  and ask why your churches aren't speaking out against it because they're on the globalist payroll
[03:11:37.760 --> 03:11:44.080]  thank you so much for the call great question okay who's up next here guys uh who should we go to
[03:11:44.080 --> 03:11:52.160]  next uh uh joshua in california you're on the air hi i have a couple things uh one i want to
[03:11:52.160 --> 03:11:58.240]  ask kathryn about start mail um i remember a couple times ago when you were on you mentioned that
[03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:02.480]  you were starting that out and then i kind of just briefly touched on that that it was in beta
[03:12:02.480 --> 03:12:07.600]  stages i was wondering when are we going to look at seeing that going into effect so that anybody
[03:12:07.600 --> 03:12:12.800]  can use it i can't wait i'm so excited i just got my start mail account this week so we are
[03:12:12.800 --> 03:12:17.360]  currently in beta meaning that 100 people internally actually have start mail accounts and
[03:12:17.360 --> 03:12:21.760]  we're emailing each other on them right now as we speak our next phase is going to be to roll it
[03:12:21.760 --> 03:12:27.360]  out to uh people who do qa analysis quality control kinds of things and then we're going to roll it
[03:12:27.360 --> 03:12:32.400]  out to all the beta testers who've signed up um i am noticing i'm actually on the website and
[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:36.960]  they're probably going to kill me for mentioning this alex but i probably should say it um we decided
[03:12:36.960 --> 03:12:41.200]  at an executive meeting last thursday to shut down the beta because we have more people than we
[03:12:41.200 --> 03:12:46.400]  really you know i mean we've we've got enough we have 45 000 people signed up to be beta testers
[03:12:46.400 --> 03:12:51.680]  for start mail um once we close that and we decided at the meeting last week we're closing it as
[03:12:51.680 --> 03:12:56.080]  going to go away so i just now clicked up and realized that they haven't actually done it yet
[03:12:56.080 --> 03:13:00.320]  so there's still time to slip in under the wire if people go to start mail dot com and sign up
[03:13:00.320 --> 03:13:05.360]  and click the box that says beta then you will be the first to actually get a three month trial
[03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:11.440]  of start mail and kick the tires and get it before anybody else gets in well so that's that's fantastic
[03:13:11.440 --> 03:13:16.400]  email address i'm sorry alex no i'm saying that's fantastic thank you caller uh for the question in
[03:13:16.400 --> 03:13:22.720]  fact i wanted to raise this since you mentioned it uh feds are suspects in new malware that attacks
[03:13:22.720 --> 03:13:27.920]  anonymity and then it goes into basically and this wired magazine the feds are believed to be
[03:13:27.920 --> 03:13:35.120]  loading on services uh it doesn't mention start page but it mentions uh some of the other groups
[03:13:35.120 --> 03:13:42.240]  out there uh on the company freedom hosting hacking in and loading this to try to track people that
[03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:47.840]  are trying to surf with it with anonymity and again this shows this stuff works to do this
[03:13:47.840 --> 03:13:52.640]  that they would be trying something like that what's so cool about start mail alex is that it's
[03:13:52.640 --> 03:13:58.000]  it's fully pgp encrypted so even if they were able to load something and capture the stream
[03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:02.800]  it would take them multiple supercomputers multiple years to decrypt even just one message
[03:14:02.800 --> 03:14:08.000]  so this means that if you have start mail the if i when you have your start mail account and i have
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:13.520]  mine and i want to email you i just check a little box that says encrypt this and behind the scenes
[03:14:13.520 --> 03:14:18.320]  it's some of the most powerful encryption ever created and in fact we're we're totally cutting
[03:14:18.320 --> 03:14:22.880]  edge because we have this new thing called perfect forward secrecy which means that if they do if
[03:14:22.880 --> 03:14:29.360]  they actually devoted the time to get your d your pgp code decrypted that they would only be able to
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:33.600]  read that one message not all the other messages that you've sent and we're the only company that's
[03:14:33.600 --> 03:14:38.160]  offering that right now on the internet so it's it's pretty amazing but what it means is that you
[03:14:38.160 --> 03:14:43.360]  if you have a horizon or comcast or htnt we know for a fact that the government is scarfing up all
[03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:47.840]  of the data flowing through there but if they scarf up an encrypted start mail message all they
[03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:53.520]  will get is a bunch of encrypted goggledygook even if they put a van outside your house and and captured
[03:14:53.520 --> 03:14:59.280]  it as it flowed onto the internet from your residents or your office they would still have to decrypt it
[03:14:59.280 --> 03:15:04.080]  so it's it's extraordinarily powerful encryption and we've designed it specifically one of the
[03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:09.040]  reasons that we got slowed down by six months is because of uh well not six months about three
[03:15:09.040 --> 03:15:14.320]  months was because of the ed snowed in revelations because no i understand you guys are really trying
[03:15:14.320 --> 03:15:20.240]  to create uh and i'm having on about that a full interview just about it uh something that really
[03:15:20.240 --> 03:15:25.440]  works let's go to some more phone calls here alex in wisconsin you're on the air go ahead
[03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:33.760]  hey buddy uh great work today i have three inquiries but uh first if all this is true what
[03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:41.200]  you are saying uh the big brothers surveillance thigh op state supercomputers with predictive
[03:15:41.200 --> 03:15:47.200]  algorithms and all the way down the rabbit hole sorry i mean it is true that i mean it's on record
[03:15:47.200 --> 03:15:55.680]  who uh been strategically coded as part of their hack and the best thing to do is curveball nonstop
[03:15:56.480 --> 03:16:00.960]  well i'm not a hacker i just know what the globalist and what top people say about the systems
[03:16:00.960 --> 03:16:07.280]  from you know just a general knowledge i don't know what a curveball is well just like um make
[03:16:07.280 --> 03:16:15.280]  your lifestyle and your plans more erratic to kind of trick the computers absolutely but they again
[03:16:15.280 --> 03:16:21.680]  they track mass movements of that they put out this info saying mess up the machine saying al-qaeda
[03:16:21.680 --> 03:16:26.960]  and bomb you mess up tonight yeah go ahead you mess up this because here's the thing that makes me
[03:16:26.960 --> 03:16:31.760]  crazy alex i've been doing this as you pointed out for 14 years what makes me crazy is that people
[03:16:31.760 --> 03:16:36.400]  want to come up with really complicated ways to fight back and then they're the very people and
[03:16:36.400 --> 03:16:41.040]  i'm not referring to this particular caller but oftentimes the people who are trying to find these
[03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:46.640]  far out ways to fight back are doing stupid stuff like having toll transponders on their cars
[03:16:46.640 --> 03:16:51.200]  not paying for their groceries and their food and their basic necessities with cash using credit
[03:16:51.200 --> 03:16:57.200]  cards um participating in facebook posting their every move on facebook treating it as though it
[03:16:57.200 --> 03:17:03.200]  were an email program writing private messages to people using gmail and yahoo email using google
[03:17:03.200 --> 03:17:07.520]  as their search engine and yet then they want to go out and do some fancy thing and leave off the
[03:17:07.520 --> 03:17:12.320]  grid or go get survival food and i'm like dude there's so much easier things that you need to do
[03:17:12.320 --> 03:17:18.560]  first and then once you've completely just done the easy low hanging fruit then at that point now
[03:17:18.560 --> 03:17:23.520]  let's talk about some deeper and more complicated things you need to do but i feel like people
[03:17:23.520 --> 03:17:28.560]  are trying to make it harder than it has to be sure right in front of you sure sure just to finish my
[03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:36.000]  point yeah that's all the government dis info opt to say say bomb say al-qaeda they put out this
[03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:41.200]  pressure cooker raid over people googling pressure cookers to make people think they're actually
[03:17:41.200 --> 03:17:46.800]  trying to stop terror it's on record to make sure their money laundering operations don't get stopped
[03:17:46.800 --> 03:17:53.040]  to make sure their criminal operations don't get stopped to get corporate intel to feed to select
[03:17:53.040 --> 03:17:58.400]  groups to corner the market and that's all come out so that's what the nsa does they don't deal
[03:17:58.400 --> 03:18:05.760]  with al-qaeda they run al-qaeda that's on record so sir i appreciate your call but i do think um
[03:18:06.720 --> 03:18:13.680]  that it's important to vary your life anyways and not be so stagnant but but i agree why do we then
[03:18:13.680 --> 03:18:21.680]  try to put this uh uh super glue on our thumb so when we go thumb scan at the dps they don't have
[03:18:21.680 --> 03:18:28.480]  a right thumb print well yeah do that but also fight to have it removed pointing out it's being
[03:18:28.480 --> 03:18:34.320]  used for a global database katherine yeah no i'm i'm totally with you there there are technical
[03:18:34.320 --> 03:18:39.520]  solutions practical solutions political solutions and we've hit a point in our society we've got
[03:18:39.520 --> 03:18:44.000]  to be on top of all of them you know even in my own community i just read in the paper that they're
[03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:50.720]  going to start having um the roadside check you know stopping us which yeah i guess the the the
[03:18:50.720 --> 03:18:55.120]  supreme court said that they can do that these are these sobriety checkpoints but you know i'm
[03:18:55.120 --> 03:18:58.000]  already thinking i turned to my husband i said i'm not going to roll down my window i'm going to
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:01.840]  make a little i'm going to print out a little thing and i'm going to have it in my car and i'm
[03:19:01.840 --> 03:19:06.400]  going to hold it up to my sealed window and say am i free to go i'm not going to roll down my
[03:19:06.400 --> 03:19:10.880]  window i'm not going to speak to them and you know this is the that it's resistance it's legal
[03:19:10.880 --> 03:19:14.800]  resistance i'm not required to roll down my window and speak to these people but i asked my husband
[03:19:14.800 --> 03:19:18.800]  i said if i wind up in jail are you gonna are you going to bail me out are you going to support me
[03:19:18.800 --> 03:19:23.920]  he said absolutely i'll join you absolutely and now they're doing stuff it's like killing you as
[03:19:23.920 --> 03:19:28.240]  the punishment and i mean this i mean this tyranny is very because in iraq they'll just spray a whole
[03:19:28.240 --> 03:19:33.600]  family on record if they look at them wrong and then uh and the contractors will get naked and
[03:19:33.600 --> 03:19:39.600]  run to the streets shooting up uh people's cars for fun that's come out i mean this is madness
[03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:44.080]  not saying no to government and we have the first amendment and we have the right to free assembly
[03:19:44.080 --> 03:19:48.720]  and free speech and we can stand in a corner and hold the sign or we can talk back to the cops
[03:19:48.720 --> 03:19:53.280]  in a way that is you know legal and appropriate and and you know i'm not a big believer in being
[03:19:53.280 --> 03:19:58.800]  rude so i i'm going to be very polite as i hold my little sign up but if i could stop in a sobriety
[03:19:58.800 --> 03:20:03.680]  checkpoint i i don't want sobriety checkpoints in my town so i'm going to resist on the individual
[03:20:03.680 --> 03:20:08.480]  level and then i'm i'm writing letters to our local paper and i'm going to show up at the next
[03:20:08.480 --> 03:20:13.440]  city council meeting and i'm going to say i don't believe that this is appropriate in our community
[03:20:13.440 --> 03:20:18.160]  so you know you've you've got to you've got to do things to respond to this sure you know there's
[03:20:18.160 --> 03:20:22.880]  another piece to figure out what streets they're on and don't drive on those streets there's practical
[03:20:22.880 --> 03:20:27.440]  things that you can do well what i do is checkpoints when i find out about them as i get in my car
[03:20:27.440 --> 03:20:31.040]  with a camera crew and go out and tell the cops you know what you're doing is unconstitutional
[03:20:31.040 --> 03:20:35.680]  that's why they didn't uh myself and others got in their faces and there were lawsuits over it and
[03:20:35.680 --> 03:20:39.840]  then the state had to pass another law saying don't do that but now they're back trying it again but
[03:20:39.840 --> 03:20:43.280]  let me let me get to a few final calls here because i want to get briefly into the whole
[03:20:43.280 --> 03:20:47.440]  cancer thing i want to move quick get quick quick questions in the quick answer here so you can say
[03:20:47.440 --> 03:20:51.280]  uh a little bit about what you experienced with the cancer but my point about dinecore
[03:20:52.160 --> 03:20:58.720]  and halliburton and and and and then xe and before that blackwater and all the crazy things
[03:20:58.720 --> 03:21:05.600]  they get caught doing no one will say no to them there's no uh resistance to their tyranny so they
[03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:12.080]  go crazy and do outrageous insane stuff that's my point and so my question is where are the people
[03:21:12.080 --> 03:21:18.880]  saying no to all this tom in maryland you're on the air go ahead hi i just wanted to thank you
[03:21:18.880 --> 03:21:27.120]  for having the former soldier on your show today you had a policeman a couple weeks ago who had won
[03:21:27.120 --> 03:21:32.320]  an award from a sheriff's association that respects the constitution stan linick i can't
[03:21:32.880 --> 03:21:40.160]  i can't tell you how important i think that is uh also as a retired police officer i want you to know
[03:21:40.160 --> 03:21:49.840]  that my former colleagues and i and many others uh some that are still active uh we took our oath
[03:21:49.840 --> 03:21:56.960]  to accept our duty to uphold the constitution as a sacred obligation that's written in maryland hall
[03:21:57.760 --> 03:22:07.680]  and uh further in our oath was to accept that to defend the constitution uh was the greatest
[03:22:07.680 --> 03:22:17.600]  honor to be bestowed upon any man and i know there are those out there and believe me we share
[03:22:17.600 --> 03:22:23.680]  your concerns we see it uh we recognize it when we see it i don't know where some of these new
[03:22:23.680 --> 03:22:30.480]  recruits are coming from but there's still plenty of us who do believe in that oath that we swore
[03:22:30.480 --> 03:22:34.960]  to uphold no no sir i hear you and good police are just some of the best people out there i know
[03:22:34.960 --> 03:22:41.040]  what's happening the general population is going insane and so you're going to have police
[03:22:41.040 --> 03:22:46.400]  that the public think are above the law that go even more insane that's the historical paradigm
[03:22:46.400 --> 03:22:52.320]  catherine any comments to what he said no i i'm i'm right there with you i really believe in
[03:22:52.320 --> 03:22:57.440]  the rule of law i just wish that we had more upholding of the law to be honest i mean you take
[03:22:57.440 --> 03:23:03.040]  a look at edward snowden and the people he outed as being in direct violation of the fourth amendment
[03:23:03.040 --> 03:23:07.600]  to the constitution that's where i'd like to see you know the people who've sworn their sacred
[03:23:07.600 --> 03:23:13.120]  honor to to uphold the constitution to step in and say yeah that's that's not legal that's that's
[03:23:13.120 --> 03:23:19.120]  not right so yeah i'm a big believer in the laws and i'm a big believer in following the laws i just
[03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:22.640]  wish we'd see a little bit more of that thank you sir for the call i don't know if i can get to other
[03:23:22.640 --> 03:23:27.360]  callers like ashley and john and jason and jan because i skipped this network break i got about
[03:23:27.360 --> 03:23:32.480]  eight minutes left with catherine albert get into your experience with breast cancer and i
[03:23:32.480 --> 03:23:38.000]  guess i guess the term to use is full remission now or or correct me if i'm wrong and then
[03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:43.840]  you're concerned because all we ever hear is you know there are no good establishment treatments and
[03:23:43.840 --> 03:23:50.080]  i i think you know the uh you know this i mean statistically they still are dangerous and don't
[03:23:50.080 --> 03:23:55.520]  work a lot of the time but but they do work some of the time and clearly uh the people out there
[03:23:55.520 --> 03:24:01.040]  that i hear saying we've got a pill with some vitamins that will knock out your cancer i mean
[03:24:01.040 --> 03:24:06.160]  in some rare cases it might be a good treatment it might actually help undoubtedly it helps but
[03:24:06.160 --> 03:24:12.960]  we're gonna end up killing people uh if we claim that there's some magic you know uh rife machine
[03:24:12.960 --> 03:24:18.320]  i mean i've refused that advertising forever or whatever you know these these quack groups claiming
[03:24:18.320 --> 03:24:24.240]  they've got magic light bulb machines and things that are going to heal people yeah you know i spent
[03:24:24.240 --> 03:24:27.920]  first you need i you know my background i don't know if the listeners do but i've got a doctorate
[03:24:27.920 --> 03:24:32.400]  from harvard university so i'm i'm a pretty good researcher that's the one thing that they train
[03:24:32.400 --> 03:24:38.240]  you how to do and when you get breast cancer and you're you get the kind of breast cancer that i had
[03:24:38.240 --> 03:24:44.720]  which put me so close to the edge of of becoming stage four that it was terrifying then all of
[03:24:44.720 --> 03:24:50.240]  those those research skills i brought all of them to bear my husband as well uh he's also a harvard
[03:24:50.240 --> 03:24:54.480]  trained researcher so the two of us really devoted ourselves full time for about a year and a half to
[03:24:54.480 --> 03:25:02.400]  doing nothing but researching cancer and we have every book every tape every video every promise
[03:25:02.400 --> 03:25:07.520]  every you know snake oil everything out there as well as everything that the conventional world can
[03:25:07.520 --> 03:25:12.400]  do and i asked him before i was going to come on the air today i said you know honey what do you
[03:25:12.400 --> 03:25:16.560]  if there's one thing you could tell people who are going to be listening to this broadcast today
[03:25:16.560 --> 03:25:21.680]  who might find themselves with a cancerous tumor what would you tell them and i thought i thought
[03:25:21.680 --> 03:25:27.600]  his answer was an interesting one he said whatever you do make sure that you at least find out what
[03:25:27.600 --> 03:25:34.080]  conventional medicine has to say about your situation what do they have to offer he says you
[03:25:34.080 --> 03:25:37.200]  don't have to do it you don't have to take it you don't have to follow it nobody's going to twist your
[03:25:37.200 --> 03:25:44.160]  arm but at least find out what they have to say because to do otherwise is is truly to to bury
[03:25:44.160 --> 03:25:49.920]  your head in the sand and not to have all the answers so i'm a big believer in marrying the two
[03:25:49.920 --> 03:25:55.680]  which is what i did you know i'm i'm such total miss natural and you know i have a show on gcn as
[03:25:55.680 --> 03:26:00.080]  well and i know about all the alternatives and i never thought i would do quote conventional
[03:26:00.080 --> 03:26:05.120]  cancer treatment but when i was diagnosed with cancer i did the research and i discovered that
[03:26:05.120 --> 03:26:11.200]  i would be taking my chances of survival from about three percent which are horrific um up to
[03:26:11.200 --> 03:26:17.280]  higher than 50 percent and i believe now i'm up to you know 80 90 percent chance of long-term survival
[03:26:17.280 --> 03:26:21.040]  of actually having this cancer not be the thing that finally kills me when i do go
[03:26:21.040 --> 03:26:26.880]  so that's all because i i didn't just go to my local cancer center and say hi i have cancer
[03:26:26.880 --> 03:26:33.680]  which i do i have sought out every possible alternative out there at every turn um one
[03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:38.560]  piece of advice i would give women if you find a lump in your breast first of all run don't walk
[03:26:38.560 --> 03:26:44.080]  to get yourself a mammogram if you do not have insurance get yourself a mammogram under the
[03:26:44.080 --> 03:26:47.520]  and and you're going to kick me for saying this alex but it's the one time i'm going to mention
[03:26:47.520 --> 03:26:55.200]  a federal program is the federal um cancer and what is it breast cancer uh i'm gonna get it wrong
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:27:01.520]  ovarian and breast cancer screening program and what this is is it's a a program where if you
[03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:06.720]  don't have insurance and if you're diagnosed with cancer under the program then the federal
[03:27:06.720 --> 03:27:11.520]  government will actually pay for your treatment now i'm not a believer in any of that i didn't
[03:27:11.520 --> 03:27:15.440]  i you know didn't even have insurance when i got no but it's a little people don't
[03:27:15.440 --> 03:27:18.960]  program people don't know about it and and and of course i mean you've gone over this we'll have
[03:27:18.960 --> 03:27:22.960]  you on sometime to a whole hour just on it but but i mean you did all the alternative you know
[03:27:22.960 --> 03:27:28.480]  good stuff the super nutrients and what i found was so so first of all you got to get diagnosed
[03:27:28.480 --> 03:27:31.840]  to figure out what you're dealing with and then you can start doing the research on your own
[03:27:31.840 --> 03:27:36.800]  and figure out is what they're telling me true what are my chances and if you do go conventional
[03:27:36.800 --> 03:27:42.240]  which vastly increases your rates of survival i mean there's the the evidence is iron clad rock
[03:27:42.240 --> 03:27:47.120]  solid indisputable the only problem with doing the conventional chemo and radiation is it's
[03:27:47.120 --> 03:27:51.840]  really hard on your body and so you can have long-term consequences from that and that's really
[03:27:51.840 --> 03:27:56.320]  where i brought in all the alternative and complementary stuff and the two i if i can
[03:27:56.320 --> 03:28:00.560]  just name the two things that have been the cornerstone of my survival program they have been
[03:28:00.560 --> 03:28:05.920]  number one curcumin i know you've talked about it before on your radio show curcumin is the the
[03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:12.960]  turmeric extract that has such a powerful anti-cancer capability it's really cheap you can buy it
[03:28:12.960 --> 03:28:17.360]  online you can you can buy it from pretty much any health now that's what the health ranger says
[03:28:17.360 --> 03:28:23.120]  to and we take it it's it's it you should take it anybody with a with a history of cancer with
[03:28:23.120 --> 03:28:27.440]  cancer in their family should be you know what i do for my mom i just have a crystal candy dish on
[03:28:27.440 --> 03:28:32.560]  the on the dining table and i just buy a jar of uh they're just a bottle of these things and i put
[03:28:32.560 --> 03:28:36.160]  them in the candy dish and i said anytime you're sitting there and you have an email and you think
[03:28:36.160 --> 03:28:40.080]  about it just take one or two of these things they're that they're they're powerful and then what
[03:28:40.080 --> 03:28:45.600]  else when they give curcumin to rats that have been bred to develop prostate cancer they can't
[03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:50.880]  even induce it in them it's that powerful so it really is amazing absolutely i mean the big danger
[03:28:50.880 --> 03:28:55.920]  is go into kooks that have some light bulb machine that's and and and then you believe that's going
[03:28:55.920 --> 03:28:59.600]  to fix it then it kills you you also go to some country hospital they don't know what they're doing
[03:28:59.600 --> 03:29:05.920]  they fry you bad team oh certainly it's it's got a bad prognosis but at least it's got some history
[03:29:05.920 --> 03:29:10.560]  of knocking stuff out then it tends to give you cancer statistically from what i've seen down the
[03:29:10.560 --> 03:29:15.360]  road as well but but only if you don't clean up your lifestyle see and this is i just need to
[03:29:15.360 --> 03:29:19.600]  write a book because there's so many pieces to this you you've got to get the cancer out of your
[03:29:19.600 --> 03:29:24.240]  body that's the surgery chemo radiation part and then you've got to change the way you're living
[03:29:24.240 --> 03:29:28.160]  and that's where all the alternative and holistic and natural and all that stuff comes in get more
[03:29:28.160 --> 03:29:33.600]  sunlight and more exercise and less stress and all the things we know to do and i take 30 i
[03:29:33.600 --> 03:29:38.560]  probably 40 pills a day i'll have to count them but i tell you said two things there's the curcumin
[03:29:38.560 --> 03:29:43.600]  and then what else um the second one to get through cancer treatment is choreolist mushroom
[03:29:43.600 --> 03:29:48.400]  and it is such a powerful immune system booster it's gonna have to do a whole show on this soon
[03:29:48.400 --> 03:29:59.360]  thank you so much
