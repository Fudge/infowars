[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:34.400]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.400 --> 00:43.280]  it is Tuesday the fourth day of September 2012 we'll be here for the next three hours and I
[00:43.280 --> 00:48.840]  tell you I took a three-day pit stop and normally when I take off two or three days
[00:48.840 --> 00:54.040]  I'm working the entire time I somehow did something I had done in a couple years and
[00:54.040 --> 01:00.040]  turned off the computers pretty much and only spent that means only spent two or three hours a
[01:00.040 --> 01:08.880]  day reading and researching news and I feel absolutely energized I felt like my brain was
[01:08.880 --> 01:14.960]  Swiss cheese last Friday when I left here doing the nightly news managing everything going over
[01:14.960 --> 01:20.440]  constant information hiring all these new crew members and just spending time with the family
[01:20.440 --> 01:27.960]  and exercising and praying I just have absolutely energized and my brain is working and firing on
[01:27.960 --> 01:34.120]  all its cylinders and I feel like I can articulate properly so many of the ideas we've got to
[01:34.120 --> 01:39.920]  cover here and I just want to say that I am so blessed to be born in a country that's been so
[01:39.920 --> 01:45.200]  free for so long and I'm so blessed that we have such wonderful listeners and supporters out there
[01:45.200 --> 01:53.080]  with the great honor and great duty and great responsibility to be here on the air because
[01:53.080 --> 01:58.840]  half the time it's a bunch of gibbering babble because of these are complex issues I'm not just
[01:58.840 --> 02:05.560]  trying to give people sound bites and it is hard to articulate the real world because the real
[02:05.560 --> 02:12.520]  world has so many delicate edges and so many hard edges and so many different shapes and colors
[02:12.520 --> 02:22.080]  and sizes and nuances to it to the full bouquet of its full spectrum palette that it is hard to
[02:22.080 --> 02:31.600]  describe hard to describe it like it's reality is like a trillion van goes exploding and fiery gout
[02:31.600 --> 02:41.480]  of blue flame and then out of each little fractal design is an ocean of fireflies each one its own
[02:41.480 --> 02:47.640]  universe so we're going to be here for the next three hours and we're going to open the phones up
[02:47.640 --> 02:52.640]  a little bit later in this hour I'm working on getting Mike Adams to pop in I didn't have any
[02:52.640 --> 02:56.400]  guest scheduled today because I wanted to cover news but then I saw the big PR roll out that you
[02:56.400 --> 03:01.760]  know what organic food you don't need it McDonald's you do hey the difference between you know and
[03:01.760 --> 03:08.040]  organic food and a McDonald's is the same thing they've seen a McDonald's cheeseburger and organic
[03:08.040 --> 03:18.000]  cheeseburger is no difference except the fine prince has pesticide GMO and hormones but never
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.440]  mind the fine print of the study the government really cares about you that's why they put fluoride
[03:23.440 --> 03:29.880]  in the water for you and the GMO sterilizes and causes organ failure and all the mammals they
[03:29.880 --> 03:36.200]  feed it to in all the major studies it's it's not a big deal though because the vitamins they say
[03:36.200 --> 03:40.640]  are the same yeah but how are they structured how are they laid out what are the ring structures
[03:40.640 --> 03:45.800]  you see so we're going to be going over that if he's able to pop in if not I'm going to be
[03:45.800 --> 03:52.720]  covering that wow in fact if you're watching on prison planet TV look at the stacks here and I
[03:52.720 --> 03:58.040]  never even scratched the service of these that's why it's important to visit info wars.com prison
[03:58.040 --> 04:03.200]  planet.com and all the sides but I'm going to start my engines and I'm going to try to come in here
[04:03.200 --> 04:07.840]  and race through at least the headlines and then dig down deeper into it I'm going to try to get
[04:07.840 --> 04:13.240]  Tyrell Ventura to pop in for about five minutes today as well we got Jesse on next week it says
[04:13.240 --> 04:20.720]  on the conspiracy theory website there on true TV that that show has that they will air the new
[04:20.720 --> 04:28.080]  episodes they kind of took them away though from the production house and so who knows what's been
[04:28.080 --> 04:34.680]  done with it because they've been editing it for close to a year so bite your fingernails with
[04:34.680 --> 04:39.520]  that who knows what true TV is going to do with this you know remember Homeland Security came down
[04:39.520 --> 04:45.080]  to try to shut down the shut down the last season okay wow I'm not going to try to tell you what's

[08:41.520 --> 08:50.080]  day of september 2012 and we're going to be live here for the next three hours wow it's incredible
[08:50.880 --> 08:58.560]  that we are about to have another another anniversary of september 11th rolling around
[08:58.560 --> 09:05.600]  that is that is hard to believe but time time certainly keeps on slipping into the future
[09:07.920 --> 09:14.560]  we are part of the past and the present and we flow into the future okay let me just to do
[09:14.560 --> 09:20.560]  it justice here on this very important transmission lay out for new listeners briefly what we stand
[09:20.560 --> 09:28.800]  for there has always been a fight throughout history between the forces of good and the forces of
[09:28.800 --> 09:34.480]  evil it really boils down to that but evil has always been defeated long term by good
[09:35.600 --> 09:43.600]  and so corruption despotism oppression thuggish behavior bullying wickedness has learned to
[09:43.600 --> 09:53.200]  camouflage its activities in a package of good in a covering of good but the globalist
[09:53.200 --> 09:58.800]  themselves that run this globe have written thousands of books and publications bragging
[09:58.800 --> 10:05.760]  about their plan and talking about how stupid you are but those are academic level and trade
[10:05.760 --> 10:11.520]  publications and military publications and congressional publications and think tank
[10:11.520 --> 10:17.600]  publications and they brag that you are stupid and helpless like sheep you can't revolt against
[10:17.600 --> 10:25.680]  the practice of eating mutton as one of their top mind said and so they communicate in your face
[10:26.240 --> 10:30.640]  like vampires at your front door going yeah i'm knocking on their door yeah they're going to open
[10:30.640 --> 10:35.040]  it and i'm going to tell them i'm a vampire but they're not going to understand it and they open
[10:35.040 --> 10:39.840]  the door and they go hi i'm a vampire they're like oh well i don't believe in those well here
[10:39.840 --> 10:46.240]  invite me in we're here warning you that government's the most dangerous thing in history
[10:46.240 --> 10:50.640]  we're here warning you or repeating what the founding fathers said who were great minds and
[10:50.640 --> 10:57.840]  philosophers and also quite brave we're here seeing the same thing unfold again but with a
[10:57.840 --> 11:05.920]  nightmarish high-tech overlay the greatest crime of the globalist is that they want to play god
[11:05.920 --> 11:12.240]  and they enjoy pulling down the existing order which is very wholesome and very good they are
[11:12.240 --> 11:18.000]  attacking the family they are attacking the very biological and genetic nature of humanity
[11:20.000 --> 11:28.000]  because with the globalist it's a race to see who is the most bold who is the most bravada
[11:28.000 --> 11:37.760]  hubris hootspa driven and it is a program of madness there is a method to the madness
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.960]  it appears to be insane on the surface then when you see their actual policy reports it makes sense
[11:44.400 --> 11:51.440]  but it still comes from a place of insanity and deeply you know twisted nature and so it is insane
[11:51.440 --> 12:02.640]  within its full spectrum the individuals running our society in our world do not have our best
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.520]  interest at heart and want to take us in their own words to a very very dark place
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.960]  they believe in social Darwinism to their absolute core it is their religion
[12:14.960 --> 12:21.600]  and social Darwinism is a idea adopted by the royalty and robber barons of europe
[12:21.600 --> 12:31.520]  and the united states by the 1870s into 1900 or so adopted worldwide in the industrialized
[12:31.520 --> 12:39.600]  world by the 1940s it went underground after the bad experience of hitler who was a variant of it
[12:39.600 --> 12:46.800]  but race specific this is not race specific this is a general coordinated attack on all of humanity
[12:46.800 --> 12:53.600]  the globalists believe that they are introducing the danger stimuli that humans are lacking in
[12:53.600 --> 12:59.520]  an industrialized society and so out of everything they're releasing and the very threat of destroying
[12:59.520 --> 13:05.440]  the earth that the superman will rise they believe they are that superman and they say in their own
[13:05.440 --> 13:10.240]  philosophy we quote top global leaders in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement
[13:10.240 --> 13:16.000]  that they will either become god or die trying destroying the earth and solar system in the
[13:16.000 --> 13:24.080]  process so that's where we stand and once you understand this you know what you're not so
[13:24.080 --> 13:31.600]  much into football anymore once you understand this you're not so much into your neighbors thinking
[13:31.600 --> 13:35.600]  you're really cool i mean sure it's great to be friends with the neighbors but you don't care if
[13:35.600 --> 13:43.840]  they hate you you know what i mean once you realize that humanity has two roads to go down
[13:43.840 --> 13:51.520]  absolute incredible things that we can't even imagine and our species developing into something
[13:51.520 --> 13:56.160]  just unspeakably wonderful the eye has not seen iris on her but god has a store for us
[13:56.160 --> 14:04.400]  or the road the transhumanist aka neo eugenicists are taking us down and i don't mean the the
[14:04.400 --> 14:08.880]  transhumanism you see on the news or in pop culture that's real cool and fun i mean the
[14:08.880 --> 14:13.680]  real thing they're building because the the transhumanism and the technology we're being given
[14:13.680 --> 14:26.800]  is all a trap door bear trap sabotaged uh trojan horse uh roaches go in they don't go out judas goat
[14:28.720 --> 14:29.520]  kill grip
[14:34.960 --> 14:40.080]  listen you need to understand that the people we're dealing with are highly intelligent
[14:40.080 --> 14:47.280]  and on average they have about 180 ideas and you have to understand that
[14:50.240 --> 15:00.560]  when i was a child i would read the piles of uh non-fiction and fiction books that my parents
[15:00.560 --> 15:03.760]  absolute book addicted people were reading
[15:03.760 --> 15:12.000]  and i noticed that when i was reading in science fiction books i'd actually read in history books
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.880]  it was just a history book written in a future context and so by the time i was 10 years old
[15:18.880 --> 15:25.760]  i'd read the isaac azimoth foundation series and then i read transhumanist books by aldis
[15:25.760 --> 15:32.240]  huxley and julian huxley by the time i was about 13 and i was like wait these science fiction books
[15:32.240 --> 15:38.240]  are actually just a fictional write-up of what they're actually planning and then so when i was
[15:38.240 --> 15:44.160]  reading mine comp by hitler or i was reading shearers rise and fall of third right or i was
[15:44.160 --> 15:51.280]  trying to read gibbons rise and decline of the roman empire at 15 or listening to it on books on tape
[15:52.800 --> 15:56.160]  that's what i really started doing was with a cassette tape lifting weights and listening to it
[15:56.160 --> 16:04.160]  and the point is is that then i inadvertently stumbled in to what the intelligentsia were
[16:04.160 --> 16:10.720]  actually planning and so from that perspective because i broke into things that they were talking
[16:10.720 --> 16:15.360]  about and operating in as if we were blind and deaf and didn't see it or hear it
[16:17.520 --> 16:21.600]  that's how i knew when google was first set up 13 years ago i went and looked it up and found out
[16:21.600 --> 16:26.560]  it was set up with nsa and cia public funding it wasn't a secret it just they knew you wouldn't
[16:26.560 --> 16:31.120]  look plus everybody knows the cia doesn't do that everybody knows the nsa doesn't listen to without
[16:31.120 --> 16:36.960]  warrants that would be a police state wouldn't it and so i read all of that
[16:41.840 --> 16:47.680]  and i read the foundation series and then i found out that isaac azimoth and his rules
[16:47.680 --> 16:56.480]  for synthetic machines robots he coined that term i learned all of that actually had come out of
[16:56.480 --> 17:03.120]  the intelligentsia in new york and in different areas of europe and that they understood humans
[17:03.120 --> 17:12.240]  could basically build whatever we envisioned and so he said in the when did he write um
[17:12.240 --> 17:19.440]  the foundation series in the 40s was it in the 30s and they have machines and computers
[17:19.440 --> 17:24.880]  off mass movement data pickup that can predict the future and then darpa
[17:26.480 --> 17:31.520]  actually built it and has named a lot of it i i mean it's got the point where i can say
[17:31.520 --> 17:37.360]  i bet they've named this after the foundation series and i go look it up and there's a 1975
[17:37.360 --> 17:43.360]  program by darpa and even mentioning isaac azimoth to envision it and then they build it i mean it
[17:43.360 --> 17:49.280]  i can now think because our brains are supercomputers as well oh they're doing this and then go look it
[17:49.280 --> 17:54.640]  up and what i just out of the ether knew they were doing they're doing i mean folks that is a great
[17:54.640 --> 18:02.480]  gift but it's also an absolute stream of data that you can't even control or even try to fully
[18:02.480 --> 18:07.840]  comprehend it when you understand ladies and gentlemen when do they write the isaac azimoth
[18:07.840 --> 18:10.960]  foundation series i'll look it up i get obsessed with the factoid
[18:14.880 --> 18:17.520]  yeah your mic's not fully on so you have to get right up on it
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.240]  okay started okay okay started writing him in 51 so i guess he wrote some of the other series
[18:24.240 --> 18:31.200]  earlier the point is is that you read that and then you realize it's all like a fictional account
[18:31.200 --> 18:37.840]  futuristic wargame of what they're actually projecting are the type of things they're going to face
[18:39.200 --> 18:42.960]  they've even they even face in there in later series like idiots savants
[18:43.600 --> 18:50.000]  who are able to counter them with just you know their own electro magnetic electrochemical
[18:50.000 --> 18:59.520]  uh systems uh i mean it's it's unbelievable i mean the point is is that google now admits
[19:03.440 --> 19:09.680]  that their government run and that they're predicting the future and but not just predicting
[19:09.680 --> 19:21.600]  it shaping the future and they're using all of this data to not just again predict the future
[19:21.600 --> 19:27.440]  but to shape it and then you find out it's not even being done to empower humanity it's being
[19:27.440 --> 19:37.280]  done to hurt us and it's being done to keep us back to prepare us to put us into a trance state
[19:37.280 --> 19:40.400]  a jellyfish state for orderly extermination
[19:42.960 --> 19:46.160]  and then the globalists say but yeah look we've told you all this and look
[19:46.800 --> 19:50.160]  look at the police they're going to serve a system meant to destroy them they deserve it
[19:50.160 --> 19:55.360]  so you should join us is the argument i mean it's it's it's it's it's unbelievably evil
[19:55.360 --> 19:58.800]  but then that's a lie those joining the dark side don't even get the power
[20:01.920 --> 20:06.320]  alex jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts get off the grid and generate your
[20:06.320 --> 20:10.400]  own supply of electrical power folks with what's been going on in this country i don't have to
[20:10.400 --> 20:15.360]  tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream news every day
[20:15.360 --> 20:20.240]  millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer

[24:17.840 --> 24:31.760]  john big john big john big bad john yeah and i have said 52 because that was the number they gave me
[24:31.760 --> 24:39.840]  the foundation series actually got published in 42 or the first parts of it uh in uh astounding
[24:39.840 --> 24:46.480]  science fiction magazine but it was really like a little little soft cover pulp fiction books that
[24:46.480 --> 24:54.640]  came out the reason i know that is that's what i was reading my dad had boxes after boxes of those
[24:54.640 --> 25:00.000]  and i would read about computers that predicted the future off of mass movements and little
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.120]  little chips and everything that tracked everything you were doing and all your appliances tracked by
[25:05.120 --> 25:12.960]  the central computers and one child policies uh and eugenics and well all this huxley who wrote
[25:12.960 --> 25:24.160]  brave new world in 1931 published in 32 uh mr huxley uh he actually bragged before he died in 62
[25:24.160 --> 25:28.080]  i've talked about this a hundred times at berkeley you can hear the audio of the speech online it's
[25:28.080 --> 25:33.280]  about an hour long that oh my brother you know he works at the u n he's the head of yanesco by the
[25:33.280 --> 25:39.840]  way this is our plan we're going to grow u n tanks and we're going to end the family and we're going
[25:39.840 --> 25:44.320]  to drug everyone and we're going to establish a world government and there's nothing you're
[25:44.320 --> 25:54.160]  going to be able to do about it 1931 wrote a book about sub void humans and genetic engineering and
[25:54.160 --> 25:59.360]  you know first sterilizing us how they get you know gets you to the point of brave new world
[25:59.360 --> 26:04.720]  is by putting chemicals in the food and water that weaken the society the society goes into crisis
[26:04.720 --> 26:09.200]  runs to the government for help the government runs all the mitigation programs to help counter
[26:09.200 --> 26:15.120]  the increased cancer and the infertility and the new and the neurological disorders and all of it
[26:19.280 --> 26:26.800]  and then they give you treatments that actually suck the money out of you control you while posing
[26:26.800 --> 26:32.080]  as the savior and and you read this stuff in transhumanist publications from the 50s that's
[26:32.080 --> 26:36.720]  when they set that up out of eugenics and all this huxley's brother uh julian huxley bragged
[26:36.720 --> 26:41.440]  he was the head of the eugenics world society he said he said we're now going to call it transhumanism
[26:42.640 --> 26:46.320]  then i get transhumanist sending me messages saying how dare you say we come from eugenics i mean
[26:46.320 --> 26:51.200]  that's just your founder i'm just saying not the popular transhumanism you follow we were flying
[26:51.200 --> 26:56.480]  around in jet packs and live a million years and you're you know a robot or whatever you don't get
[26:56.480 --> 27:01.680]  to go into the future your history is governed your history is dominated you're not part of that
[27:01.680 --> 27:10.960]  come fende compute you understand that can you compensate that
[27:12.640 --> 27:17.440]  i mean does it get through to your brain that that here's the deal you got royalty and rich
[27:17.440 --> 27:23.440]  robber barons that already dominated most the world 160 plus years ago and they already believed
[27:23.440 --> 27:28.160]  they were inbred and godlike and better than you and actually had syphilitic brains most of them
[27:28.160 --> 27:31.920]  and were inbred so they were incredibly intelligent but also incredibly vicious
[27:33.360 --> 27:37.920]  and so it made perfect sense when scientists came along and said we've got to create artificial
[27:37.920 --> 27:44.400]  stimuli we've got to dump disease into the cities and put poison in the water to put pressure on
[27:44.400 --> 27:50.480]  people to kill the weak so only the strong go forward mouth this was right a hundred plus years
[27:50.480 --> 27:58.240]  before this is an 1850 in the 70 a hundred years before that roughly he was saying put people in
[27:58.240 --> 28:04.160]  compact cities put poison put bio weapons in put stuff in the water to get rid of the poor
[28:04.160 --> 28:07.520]  there's not going to be enough room there a bunch of cockroaches get rid of them
[28:08.640 --> 28:15.440]  and so these ideas developed hundreds of years ago by people who to a man had syphilis because
[28:15.440 --> 28:20.880]  you know the wealthy were into women obviously and syphilis was was ubiquitous among the prostitutes
[28:22.160 --> 28:27.760]  they had syphilis so they were criminally insane and they were inbred and they already had
[28:27.760 --> 28:34.000]  aggressive successful genetics so you add syphilis and inbreeding to successful
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.840]  hyper dominant genetics you've got what these people are building
[28:37.840 --> 28:45.360]  and there's another side to humanity the good guys who have always been
[28:45.360 --> 28:51.280]  mitigating and holding back some of this stuff but the new world order is when all of this comes in
[28:51.280 --> 28:55.200]  it's when all of this happens it's when the trigger gets pulled on all of it
[28:56.240 --> 28:59.280]  you know the guys just put a what was an associated press headline up
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.000]  uh it's it's everywhere that oh yeah the court upholds that the relationship between google
[29:04.000 --> 29:11.920]  and the nsa is secret but it's not secret it was founded in the late 90s by the nsa and by the cia
[29:11.920 --> 29:20.080]  on record go look it up the current relationship is secret but the telecommunications acts aren't
[29:20.080 --> 29:24.800]  secret they've got hubs at every building and facility with everything going over it i told
[29:24.800 --> 29:30.000]  you that in 96 because it was in the telecommunications act not because i was a rocket scientist
[29:30.000 --> 29:36.560]  it's all there the plan's all there okay i wish it wasn't true i wish it wasn't all coming true
[29:36.560 --> 29:43.440]  i wish it wasn't all happening but you're in a petri dish you're under attack 99.9% of you

[36:37.360 --> 36:44.560]  a mission i am on a mission i am on a mission and uh going back six years ago i made the decision
[36:44.560 --> 36:50.000]  to start expanding instead of just having six or seven crew members and staying small i realized i
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.160]  had a responsibility because we were already having such a big effect to expand and as we've
[36:54.160 --> 36:58.960]  expanded exponentially we've reached more people i will tell you we're hurtling straight into
[37:00.080 --> 37:05.680]  full frontal confrontations with the globalist all sorts of weird stuff going on behind the scenes
[37:05.680 --> 37:10.560]  but that's what happens when you go in through and beyond i mean we're going into the black hole
[37:10.560 --> 37:15.920]  here ladies and gentlemen and when you support us you put fuel in our engine to get maximum speed
[37:15.920 --> 37:20.800]  to go into that thing and that's our only hope is to hit it going 110 miles an hour and that's
[37:20.800 --> 37:25.120]  what we're doing right now we're a runaway locomotive going head on to their locomotive
[37:25.120 --> 37:29.440]  and all that matters is we stop them and that's what we're doing ladies and gentlemen but we
[37:29.440 --> 37:33.680]  need your help your prayers and your support in the info war if we're going to fire these
[37:33.680 --> 37:38.720]  torpedoes down the reactor shaft and we can do it ladies and gentlemen we've got to be committed
[37:38.720 --> 37:43.440]  we've got to realize that there is no way back we must defeat the globalists it's us or them
[37:43.440 --> 37:46.720]  and i'm going to hit a bunch of news and then i'm going to open the phones up
[37:46.720 --> 37:50.560]  you don't have a guess the last 30 minutes of the show even if we did we get Mike Adams
[37:50.560 --> 37:59.760]  on short notice we did fantastic so that is all coming up i kind of went off into the transhumanism
[37:59.760 --> 38:06.560]  and um the big picture i mean where this goes why all this is happening why you turn on the
[38:06.560 --> 38:12.400]  television and it's pure anti-family anti-liberty anti-freedom messages i mean that ought to scare
[38:12.400 --> 38:17.680]  the daylights out everybody and by scare you i mean not not scary into hiding your house
[38:18.320 --> 38:22.320]  call it scary into action people say man you scare people you're trying to scare them
[38:23.360 --> 38:28.160]  i think people that think that i'm trying to scare them don't get it this is happening i'm
[38:28.160 --> 38:33.440]  here telling you what's happening because i believe that when you understand that your
[38:33.440 --> 38:38.560]  children are being targeted with radiological chemical and biological and you know genetically
[38:38.560 --> 38:42.880]  engineered garbage to hurt them you're going to get angry and start doing something about it
[38:44.480 --> 38:47.280]  and that's what i've been doing for 17 years
[38:49.760 --> 38:57.920]  and i've i have done an amazing you know amount of work and it's had an effect and so have you
[38:57.920 --> 39:02.320]  but we need to understand that we've got to grab the neural order by the arm politically
[39:02.320 --> 39:10.320]  economically socially and pull the veil aside that means pull their arm out of their socket
[39:11.760 --> 39:15.120]  because they've got they've got their hand over our eyes trying to keep people from waking up
[39:15.120 --> 39:18.720]  we got to grab them by the arm and they're going to squeal they're going to complain they're going
[39:18.720 --> 39:22.800]  to say we're wrong they're going to act like we don't have power they're going to stonewallis
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.440]  we got to go you know what go ahead and stonewallis oh you feel that oh you don't like that do you
[39:27.440 --> 39:33.360]  watch this and just decide to pull their arm out of their socket okay that's what i liken it to
[39:33.360 --> 39:39.040]  rip their arm out of their socket don't stop they're not going to give us quarter we're not
[39:39.040 --> 39:45.920]  giving it to them and the weapon system of the truth is a weapon system that will destroy our enemies
[39:49.520 --> 39:54.720]  because their own servants and minions are compartmentalized and most of them think they're
[39:54.720 --> 40:00.480]  doing a good job higher level or evil control freak mercenaries who think that they're on the
[40:00.480 --> 40:04.960]  winning team but don't understand this is the total destruction of humanity as we know what
[40:04.960 --> 40:12.880]  we're talking about here this is inbred psychopaths given godlike power playing god whose prime
[40:12.880 --> 40:18.160]  directive is to kill steal and destroy whether you believe in god or not i'm telling you that is
[40:18.160 --> 40:22.880]  who they are that is what they stand for whether it's true or not that there's a spiritual entity
[40:22.880 --> 40:29.040]  behind it doesn't matter for those of you that don't understand it's real it's there you must admit it
[40:29.040 --> 40:35.760]  what is in the bible is now unfolding that's what matters what matters is this is happening

[47:29.440 --> 47:34.480]  just even turr is bad because he doesn't like his genitals being grabbed by a laughing person at
[47:34.480 --> 47:39.600]  lana airport in front of me checking to see if his testicles are his testicles this is what we've
[47:39.600 --> 47:46.640]  become total psych warfare hiring tsa running their backgrounds finding out their felons and

[48:06.960 --> 48:11.120]  starbucks right there you know at the seats at the airport they've gone through the checkpoint
[48:11.120 --> 48:17.200]  the tsa walks over these women with these satisfied looks just getting off on making people comply
[48:17.200 --> 48:22.880]  people that wouldn't have been able to have been trash collectors people because that's a hard job
[48:22.880 --> 48:27.920]  people that wouldn't be able to hold a job doing anything now they get to be minders see these are
[48:27.920 --> 48:33.520]  women that should have had kids women that should have been running a household you know in in a
[48:33.520 --> 48:37.760]  role that would have fulfilled them instead and this is how it is the new nanny state is these
[48:37.760 --> 48:43.280]  women who guaranteed never had kids and they come over and you're now their child you're now the two
[48:43.280 --> 48:49.200]  year old and and and these yuppies just with pleasure smile and go here's my water here's my
[48:49.200 --> 48:54.720]  starbucks i just bought 20 feet away and then oh yeah government with dirty gloves and who knows
[48:54.720 --> 48:59.200]  what stick something in my drink get used to something meaning medically done stick something
[48:59.200 --> 49:06.240]  in my drink again total psych warfare we're going to be getting more into that uh activists put on
[49:06.240 --> 49:11.040]  terror watch list to prevent him protesting dnc and i i looked at the links this morning and
[49:11.040 --> 49:19.840]  on the mainstream news wco tv and others wsoc tv and i couldn't find why they made the fake arrest
[49:19.840 --> 49:23.920]  either they put fake bullets in your bag or claim you did something to you know drag you off if
[49:23.920 --> 49:29.040]  you're on the no fly list he was going to protest and they just said well we arrested him and it
[49:29.040 --> 49:35.440]  shows because protesting is listed as terrorism and paul has their official uh form in here
[49:36.800 --> 49:42.800]  and it says attacking the pentagon they call it low level terrorism so they give a high level
[49:42.800 --> 49:49.680]  terror attack a low level name ids so if you attack the pentagon that's small ids is low level
[49:49.680 --> 49:55.360]  hate crimes against racial groups and then they just add protests see they they take things and then
[49:55.360 --> 50:00.000]  and then that's why they call people that blow up the pentagon extremist and then when you protest
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.480]  big government they call that extremist the brain picks it up both ways you understand it's a way
[50:04.480 --> 50:08.880]  to call you a terrorist without calling you a terrorist but now they just call you a terrorist
[50:08.880 --> 50:14.480]  protesting terrorism so they said we're holding him we're and and we want him held till the dnc's
[50:14.480 --> 50:21.680]  over at the local jail that's the feds saying hold him in a jail see that's the new ndaa being being
[50:21.680 --> 50:27.040]  rolled out against us nationwide now that's what's going on is we're just getting used to
[50:27.040 --> 50:32.640]  as i told you at the airport and then at highway checkpoints you're going to be on a list no judge
[50:32.640 --> 50:40.160]  no jury done nothing wrong and it's a pickup list and you disappear but see this time the lawyers
[50:40.160 --> 50:46.080]  gotten involved and got him out but see this is what they're doing they're just racing ahead
[50:46.080 --> 50:50.960]  with the disappearance then once people know people are disappearing they won't be picked up by the
[50:50.960 --> 50:57.200]  police that will then cause violent confrontations then the civil war starts all of it is planned

[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.120]  just one of these articles i read this morning by kurt linderman was like
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:01.280]  just so humiliating and painful for humanity it's how they're given kids little kids abortions
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.560]  without even telling their parents how they're giving them vaccines all over the country
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.000]  without telling their parents with links to all the news reporting it like it's a great thing
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.920]  people being arrested for what they write in school essays the three-year-olds that aren't
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:20.800]  allowed to use their name hunter because hunting's bad and you know the because when i saw this
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:26.640]  article i knew that as soon as i saw an article about a deaf preschooler in Nebraska told to
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:32.080]  change his name i saw that last friday in the examiner i knew that i would say hey i bet there's
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.400]  a trend to not have the name hunter and sure enough found it because hunting's bad there don't
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:42.080]  be parents don't name your kid hunter i mean these people are a bunch of hin pecking control freaks
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:48.800]  and i've had enough of them these armies of these soft stupid dumb people that are so weak
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.320]  they want to boss strong people around let me tell you something folks when you're strong
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.920]  you don't like bossing people around you only do it if it's an absolute necessity
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:02.320]  that's why i'm so sick of guys it's a constant torture that really think they're tough let me
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.840]  tell you something really tough guys are real polite and real nice because they don't want to get in
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:13.200]  a fight a because they know they might kill you but b they know they might run into somebody like
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:17.520]  them somebody who's been in a lot of fights actually knows what it's really like it's always
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.800]  these soft nobodies i've even analyzed i've seen some of these guys start fights with people and
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.640]  later i'll ask them hey you've been in a lot of fights oh yeah i've been in a couple really
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.240]  you ever been in the hospital before you ever put somebody in the hospital you've had your teeth
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:41.280]  knocked out you ever had arms and legs broken and and and again they're not in the real world
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:46.400]  it's like they're about 12 years old but they're 30 and they just have not lived yet they have not
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:52.000]  experienced things yet i watch these cops in these videos but we don't even play here on air most of
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.560]  the time i mean i could demonize police to the end of the world if i wanted to but that only helps
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.600]  the psych warfare compact them more into their into their arrested development and their and
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.840]  their gang mentality that it's us against them but i mean you'll watch them where somebody's
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:10.000]  doing nothing and they kick them in the throat and then you think well maybe they caught them
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.520]  raping a woman you know maybe they were just mad at them and then the case comes out and they've
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:19.040]  done nothing they pulled them over they hadn't even smarted off to them just a man it's it's a
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:24.320]  sadist wants to kick somebody in the throat or you know body slam a woman for no reason
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.880]  i mean one thing if you've been on the force 10 years and we're having a bad day and somebody
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.040]  got in your face and pushed you so you beat them over the head that'd be bad but it wouldn't be like
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:41.280]  oh put them in jail you know somebody did something to you but like stomping on somebody's head and
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:46.960]  then charging them with assaulting you because they raised their hand it's so cowardly it's so
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:53.200]  pathetic i'm ashamed for you it's not even that i hate you i just think of what type of weirdo
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:04:01.840]  wimper you and then i think about what it must be like to be in your family just the nature of
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.600]  government and how do you have a good country with a good police force which are rare versus what
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:13.280]  most nations are like with a bunch of out of control goons street gangs in uniforms running
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:21.520]  around abusing people but generally it's because the people are our reflection of their police
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:27.520]  if you have an upright strong but also genteel society the police are going to be well behaved
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.920]  and you're going to have a culture we're being honorable and being intelligent and going after
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:38.080]  real bad guys like a bloodhound and those people are honored because when you've got good peace
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:44.400]  officers they are a treasure that's why i it's to see our system taken over and turned into evil
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.400]  and it's to see it become the opposite it's painful because it could be such a good thing
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.880]  and it is so pathetic to see what it's turned into and that the police are now being made our
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.720]  enemies and they are like hogs to a slaughter we'll be right back

[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:53.920]  we went out and saw it obama 2016 and it was true to a level so it wasn't lying it just didn't take
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:59.680]  you to the higher level uh of the knowledge so i want to ask the crew to please remind me at the
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:06.480]  uh start of the second segment next hour for me to do a brief review of that i want to do a big
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:11.600]  official review with documents and show people examples with quotes and things of what's going
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:20.080]  on with obama 2016 and we're going to take calls in this hour on the reports uh that the uh we've
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.600]  been telling you about for a year but now the media is finally picking up on it because it's
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:30.720]  going in nationwide and then there's video servicing of you walk out of a water burger or you walk out
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:36.080]  of a starbucks or you walk out of a salt lick here in austin at the austin berkshire international
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:42.640]  airport all airports and the tsa comes over and says we're going to stick a sampler an
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:48.160]  explosives tester in your drink and they were asked about it a few months ago they said well
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.640]  we just want to be random no it's not random it's about getting in your space and dominating you
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:57.520]  and and creating the idea that you're all suspects because see they're now moving from al-qaeda
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:03.600]  oh we don't profile we just watch you get a starbucks coffee that we know there isn't explosives in
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:09.520]  and do it because it's nonsensical in military psychology the prussians developed this they
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:16.480]  would have troops in boot camp near the end do really silly stupid stuff sing stupid songs say
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.120]  stupid things i'm not going to say some of the sexual stuff some of the more advanced units
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:28.000]  would be told to do and it was mainly will you do it will you do what you're told because they
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.480]  have to set the precedent to take your three-year-old behind closed doors with a fat guy with a

[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:38.480]  headline that they put him in jail and the fed said keep him there indefinitely because he

[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.520]  saw it saturday and i i've got some thought provoking things to say julio in illinois you're
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:25.600]  on the air welcome uh aloha alex uh you know you're talking about geoengineering and it's uh it's
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:34.800]  crazy to see first in california with proposition 37 the coalition against gmo labeling it's you
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:40.240]  name the food company you name the beverage company even fruit companies and they're donating
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:47.440]  hundreds of thousands even millions of dollars in california against gmo labeling and so uh
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:52.320]  well again i want to be clear you could have good gmo's just like you could have vaccines
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:58.480]  but the people running it are psychos designing it to sterilize you and make you sick merc got caught
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.560]  three months ago with or two months ago with its m mr shot knowing it was giving people
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:09.360]  measles mumps rubella and saying that was good because it would make people buy their product
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:15.440]  when they cause an epidemic i mean again people don't know all of these big pharma companies
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:22.640]  are the people that created the nazis the nazis got their ideas from the united states in england
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:29.760]  and german pharmacological companies they're all eugenics based so you can't trust them and and and
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:35.280]  yes they're fighting to not have gmo labeling and i'll cover that more later i'm glad you raised it
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:43.200]  there are all these articles about how oh organics not good you know regulars just as good nutrition
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:48.640]  but they have to add the proviso except there aren't the hormones in the pesticides and herbicides
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:54.640]  and and some other things but but our study shows that listen our study shows it's just as good
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:27:02.160]  you know what searl did owned by monsanto two separate times the pentagon in the 60s was creating
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:09.200]  genetically engineered ecoli bacteria to try to have them eat toxic waste and they found wow this
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:15.600]  stuff releases a sweet tasting neurotoxin that's highly addictive show the eugenicist had the idea
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:21.680]  at searl will put this in in in food and drinks and it's highly addictive the perfect poison
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:27.440]  now it gets worse people can look this up they give it to rhesus monkeys in the study
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:32.480]  and it kills a bunch of them brain damages the rest but they put it in the mother's milk they
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:37.600]  added aspartame in the mother's milk totally screwed the babies up there's so many different types
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:43.200]  of drinks for babies that have it today it's so incredibly evil then causes diabetes you name it
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.880]  they just used that study but cut out the monkeys that died and said look these monkeys were okay
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:54.400]  the rhesus monkeys to get it passed so yes i mean obviously you called in about the issue of the huge
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:28:01.120]  pr thing about oh you don't want organic no no bill gates owns monsanto he says he wants to reduce
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:06.640]  your population to put vaccines in food so you can't escape it eat it eat it bill gates loves you i'm
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:13.360]  sorry don't you trust bill gates uh of course i trust bill gates manipulating our weather and
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:18.320]  focusing our public i trust him on that aspect two more things well he does own the big company
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:22.320]  with government funds manipulating the weather and he admits he's doing it but it doesn't exist
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:28.080]  because the public is they know about the broncos okay and they're quarterback but they don't know
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:34.640]  about about geoengineering so it doesn't exist you're a bad man alex i had a can't uh can't

[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:57.120]  2016 i will cover it all right now let's go to kaitlyn in iowa you're on the air kaitlyn
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:03.840]  hi alex there's something about your show that just gives me riled up so i'll try to be as precise
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:09.840]  and calm about it as i can the way things have been going you know of course globalization the
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:15.200]  world's turning into like a big spider web right everything that happens in one place trickles down
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:20.000]  and i mean almost everybody can feel it and there's so much negative energy that gets thrown out
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.080]  into the world because people once they don't know what they mean or they just don't say what they mean
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:31.840]  and everybody picking up on that i think is something that pushes them to give in to what's
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:41.200]  been happening to give into this system of crude action and analysis on the way the world is or
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:47.520]  should be and i don't know what to do with it being that entire web and everybody can feel
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:54.400]  what's happening whether they answer to it or not how how we work with it and how we get people to
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:39:00.000]  stop giving into the all that negativity and to live as they ought to well here's the deal you've
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.440]  got to learn what negativity is uh i'm not saying you don't know but a lot of people think saying
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:11.680]  that things are wrong is negative no it's positive if you walk out in your garage and and stuff for
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:16.720]  a year is piled up and you can't you get to any of your tools or get to your tents or get to your
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:22.400]  bicycles where your bicycles are rusted up it's good on a saturday to pull all that out in the
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:28.800]  driveway to throw stuff away to get it all clean to go through it to spray wd 40 on the bikes and
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:34.560]  say hey we're all grungy with dirt on us let's go take a shower and then let's uh go for a bike ride
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:40.160]  i mean so but but but but see the average person would say i don't be negative instead of the
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:45.040]  garage is dirty we have to admit we've got a problem we've gone in the wrong direction we've
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:50.560]  handed over control of our lives and the social engineers who happen to be a psychopathic guild
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:58.960]  of eugenics based control freaks okay so so the negativity is to say we can't do anything or to
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:04.080]  say oh who cares you're just being negative and we've got to own it and say you know what this is
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:09.280]  the challenge of a lifetime the challenge of our species this is for all the marbles the globalists
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.960]  are probably going to destroy human life on this planet or damage it to a great extent they're
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:18.240]  already wrecking our genetic code we individually are going to die but we can fight for the overall
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:23.600]  species and the minute you make that mental decision the universe just full spectrum opens up
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:29.280]  and you're like whoa uh now i'm actually conscious doesn't mean you have all the answers but you now
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:35.040]  have gone to a new level the moment you say i'm committed against evil you truly recognize the
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:41.360]  evil crimes against the genetic code of this planet god's creation i mean that's what sin is
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:48.480]  good again let me explain this i i'm not somebody that hates people that uh have sex with the same
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:54.480]  sex okay i'm not judging him i've uh you know you know grew up in modern times i've seen a lot of
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:41:01.040]  wild stuff i don't dislike people i don't like that the globalists are trying to push that agenda
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:06.160]  to destroy the family because they see it as a strong institution they want to overthrow
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:13.520]  so then the system cries unclean says you're being mean you don't like gay people because you know
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:19.120]  you're saying we shouldn't teach seven-year-olds about sex in school no you're doing that to
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.880]  to to to accelerate the development as the transhumanists said they would do that's in brave
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:29.920]  new world but it's also in their real non-fiction documents to arrest development because if you
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:35.360]  accelerate development you arrest the final development when you accelerate early development
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:41.280]  and don't have that innocence period you then arrest advanced development accelerating development
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:46.800]  stunts and arrest long-term hierarchy of need development that you'll never read that books
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:50.560]  that's my own analysis but then they admit it in compartmentalized pieces but i'm kind of going
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:56.960]  off in a jag or around about uh you know on a walkabout on what you just got into but but you
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:01.760]  know they always make it so simple uh like oh you're just some stupid religious guy we'll
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:07.840]  know those churches put themselves between us and god and then and are designed to make
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:11.920]  people not get access to the truth that does it not mean that there isn't spiritual things in the
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:16.480]  universe just because a bunch of people realize there's power in that so they put themselves in
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:23.040]  front of it uh i mean look look if we just decide abortion is bad that's a great step against evil
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:28.080]  if we just decide that self-defense is good and anyone that says take the guns because we want to
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:32.640]  keep you safe really just wants to enslave you it doesn't mean we don't know there's problems with
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:38.000]  guns or innocent people being killed but we understand they want our guns for the greater
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:44.320]  evil of the monopoly of force it's logic it's it's it's analysis it's ma'am i apologize i'm ranting
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:51.120]  what did you call in about i i just wanted to kind of bounce ideas off of you because the
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:57.680]  personal potential that everybody should have has just been so dampered and to try to get people out
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:02.480]  from underneath that to me just seems like the biggest challenge i mean and you try to tell them
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:07.360]  these things and it almost seems to to damper them more because they won't take it just as as truth
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:14.240]  and you know why they do that do you know why they do that they're scared perhaps it is a it is a
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:21.200]  hypnotic suggestion it is a psychological command it is a precondition trigger it is a hypnotic
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:29.760]  command literally through the culture that they feel so small and little and so ineffective
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:34.560]  that they say i'll do whatever the the the culture says is cool to be accepted and i'll
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:40.560]  take on these physical trappings you know of of beauty or masculinity or you know whatever the
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:48.560]  style is so that i fit in because i don't feel like i have an identity your identity flows out of
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:57.040]  the spine the the the space time continuum you are creatures you are space aliens and and by that
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:02.720]  we're not space aliens from a faraway planet if we thought about the fact we're on a planet
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:09.040]  you know with with weird dogs running around and squirrels out in the trees and stars at night
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:16.800]  burning star systems and nebulas and and and rivers and and and wind and science and art
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:25.760]  and ideas and and and honorableness and and in passion and children and everything challenges
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:32.160]  it's good to be challenged it's good to be in the crosshairs of evil it's good to be killed by evil
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:37.360]  resisting it because that's what makes others you know so many times in history when evil crushes
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:42.000]  when evil crushes because more primitive evil would just crush someone resisting it
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:47.040]  but evil learned that when they crush someone out in front of everybody it doesn't actually scare
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:53.520]  people something triggers and people go almost like a gravitational pull i must resist now and begin
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:59.760]  pulling in when you have an alamo or you have somebody like martin luther king killed or or
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:05.760]  christ being crucified or mahatma ghandi it creates that martyr what do they mean by a martyr people
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:12.480]  then understand wait people are dying this is real they're so committed to this danger
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:18.320]  they're doing it for the greater good i need to commit now to die of niby and not because you're
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:24.240]  a hero but because you want to add strength to the collective of the species and that doesn't mean
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:30.080]  an artificial collective everything the system sells is a counterfeit of the illuminati takes all
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:36.320]  of these archetypal symbols that are symbols in creation symbols of gods work in the firmament
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:42.560]  and they copy all of god symbols as a counterfeit and then when those of us you sometimes use those
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:48.080]  symbols like a planet with a sun coming up over it a new day creation the beauty of the universe
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:53.760]  people say oh that's an illuminati symbol no it's not they took our symbol they take everything away
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:46:02.080]  from us and then and then and then put their agenda behind it and so we have to we have to
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:07.760]  understand that these people have discovered one level of the secrets of the universe and they use
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:13.840]  it greedily to try to have temporal control instead of understanding that there's something much larger
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:20.720]  and much bigger out there and so they create a counterfeit of the of the collectivist model
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:29.680]  you are an individual who is empowered and admired and built up because of the manifestation
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:40.320]  of god's incredible energy in creation through you through you as part of god's manifestation
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:48.800]  and so you're you know looking out into the world operating and then you are admired you are supported
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:55.600]  you are built up because it's better it's stronger that's the competition so but but within that then
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:01.840]  those that are successful in the competitive system also understand that then it's their job
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:08.720]  to fight the corrupt evil that is attacking people who itself is powerful but in a dark way it is
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:15.360]  those of us that are strong our job to resist that so the evil doers learn how to manipulate the good
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.880]  into serving their system and i'm really getting philosophical right now i'm going to cover news
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:23.120]  today and i'm probably all over the map here but i appreciate your call said i take a bunch of calls
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:26.800]  and i'm all over the place
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:38.160]  people are stunted they are like victims they are zombies they are androids they are pre-programmed
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:43.920]  they're not real the the easiest way to understand it for someone in the matrix
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:49.840]  is do you remember being three years old four years old and playing batman or robin or superman
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:54.320]  with your friends in the neighborhood and that feeling all of a sudden as you're running around
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:00.400]  with a capon you know imagining a superman that this is silly i'm not really superman
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:06.400]  and this is a make-believe thing
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:15.440]  it isn't real i'm i'm i'm make-believing that's what the whole world is that's the two paths
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:22.400]  there's the false reality the lie the world which isn't the world it's the template laid over the
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:28.720]  real world a false grid there's the lie and the deeper you get down the lie the more you can't
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.600]  recognize the real world as you drive away from it and the more you do recognize the fake world
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.400]  and it becomes more and more real and it becomes all you want to embrace and it becomes all you
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:46.080]  want to interface with okay and so you go deeper down that road and into all the lies that you
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:51.200]  don't have free will and so what of a child's being tortured or so what if this is going on there is
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:56.640]  no good and evil it's telling you that so you have no rudder so it can suck you down the black hole
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:02.720]  suck you into the hellraiser dimension suck you into the event horizon take you into its dimension
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:08.880]  take you away from the light take you away from god take you away from the wholesome creation
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:15.680]  take you away you've got that road and then you've got the other road the road that seems hard
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:18.960]  and even as it gets harder it gets better
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:28.480]  that's wanting reality wanting perception wanting accuracy wanting to know the real mysteries
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:33.600]  not using mysteries to control people mysteries that are only one level there's always more levels
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:41.360]  wanting mysteries to empower wanting mysteries to to build wanting mysteries to explore wanting
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:47.760]  mysteries for love and goodness everything that darkness tells you is weak see they tell the
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:52.000]  week you would have power if you were evil become a master of evil and then people never
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:57.840]  unexperienced good so they think well i'll go serve evil and then they immediately in an evil system
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:03.440]  with more and more people in a delusion operating within the delusion they're like wow these people
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:09.120]  aren't conscious i can manipulate them i can get power temporal power but you yourself are only at
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:16.320]  one level above them in ignorance you understand that you're only one level above them in your
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:22.480]  ignorance you're able to lie and manipulate them but it's a lie to use lies to manipulate you yourself
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:29.920]  are lying you yourself are shuttering the level at which your human development can reach you
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:36.960]  understand that the truth though i will warn you is like grabbing a hold of a high-powered
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:42.480]  electrical conduit it will begin to burn away what you were and it will hurt when you first grab it
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:47.280]  evil's kind of fun isn't it feel like you're getting away with something that's kind of
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:53.360]  kind of an easy road to go down good when you reach out and actually grab hold of it your
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:59.040]  teeth are going to clench it's going to hurt but if you just keep hold of it it will burn away the
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:05.760]  fear it will burn away the weakness big business has discovered the preparedness market and that

[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:34.320]  imagine the commitment against your own species as a mercenary
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:40.080]  to tell people that pesticides and hormones
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:46.320]  and GMO are good for them coming up in about 40 minutes Mike Adams is going to join us
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:50.240]  I'm going to go back to your calls now I'm going to do a brief review of Obama 2012 coming up when
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:55.040]  you get into the next hour and a bunch of the news I mentioned earlier but I am I am in a
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:59.760]  preaching mode today because I took off three full days which is very rare to actually take off
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:04.720]  usually work feverishly the entire time and only worked a few hours each day so I am just energized
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:10.800]  and so I'm kind of preaching because I do I thought a lot about the nature of the universe and
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:18.880]  things while I was gone so apologize for that Doris in Tennessee you're on the air thank you for
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:27.440]  holding hello speaking of preachy I found you one day about two years ago looking for text
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:36.720]  Mars and you had text Mars on your program number two Susan B Coleman I'm having a hard time figuring
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:44.000]  out the devil's big are they or are they not supporting Planned Parenthood aka abortion male
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:50.240]  well they were supporting it and then they pulled out of it which is the right way to go but overall
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:56:01.280]  that foundation is you know out there promoting treatments and things for women but never discovering
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:08.480]  why is cancer and these other things increasing does that answer your question well I just want
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:16.400]  to say one thing about aspartame aspartame almost killed me personally and they know it in the
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:21.920]  hospitals they even joke about it in the neurology departments when they're doing tests on people
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:29.680]  they say we haven't had our aspartame today and laugh about it I also want to mention something
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:38.560]  about directed 51 which literally makes congress ceremonial so Bush did that no that's right all
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:44.000]  this stuff's in place and now the president is directing hey congress you're under you in command
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.640]  sit down shut up hey I'm going to shut down these power plants without congress sit down shut up
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:52.800]  hey I'm going to start arresting people I mean I have the article here activists put on terror
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:58.560]  watch list to prevent him protesting dnc you read the article it should be activists grabbed under
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:07.200]  ndaa for first amendment I mean it's huge I'm even getting a customer just accepting this
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:14.400]  I mean it's so incredible we have a de facto government that is just taken over completely
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:20.240]  and they've all worked together I listened to Romney's speech extremely close the other night
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:27.360]  he gingerly walked around the issues of guns he didn't even mention guns number one number two
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:33.920]  he talked about the sanctity of marriage he did not talk about homosexual marriage which I look at
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:41.040]  it exactly like you do that it's an attack on the family here's the deal exactly people try to make
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:50.800]  it like you're attacking me for what I'm doing uh no I'm not but what's up with going to like family
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:55.600]  parks and grabbing and kissing on each other in front of the biggest soccer game you can find
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:58:01.040]  there's a shoving you don't see you know I mean I guess you see like 15 year old heterosexuals doing
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:07.760]  that it's juvenile and I don't like it being pushed on kids in school I I don't want anybody
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:14.160]  pushing anything sexual on my children I want them to remain uh you know innocent and uh you know
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:19.760]  that's the issue is that there's a but but but that group's being used to push a anti-family
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:24.160]  agenda which the globalists admit and so again they try to change the subject oh you just hate
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:29.040]  people they're like this really really I'm not even thinking about it and I don't care
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:33.120]  in you know in in the final equation what somebody does themselves individually that's
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:39.440]  called freedom don't sit there and push it on people's kids that's called pervert behavior

[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:58.960]  Irish whiskey shots but anyway thanks that was a big help for my waistline
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:07.920]  and well we didn't want to bug you you're talking to Joe and everything but it was a great time
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:16.640]  and I'm just a small businessman and I decided to go to Chantilly and I knew that that's where
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:20.640]  the action was I knew there was going to be a great bunch of people I got interviews with Stuart
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:29.440]  Rhodes and a whole bunch of people so the power of citizenjournalism I mean you've got it nailed
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:35.840]  and you had a really tight schedule let's just say it was not a calm and cool day it was pretty
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:40.720]  balmy down there and you guys were really but I got plenty of liquids the tequila was a big
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:46.560]  big help they recommend that like after a two a day to drink some tequila exactly cactus juice
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:53.600]  it's good for you plus there are no it's good for giving you hangovers yeah so um the power of
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:59.440]  citizen citizenjournalism I met Julio that was just on I met uh although we are changed Wisconsin
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:06.400]  we are changed Minnesota people um a great bunch of people and uh you really give us a shot in the
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:11.920]  arm when we see how you pull it off and some of these guys other guys were doing their own live
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:19.520]  streams and people need to need to not forget that you can do this too I know it seems like the
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:24.720]  world's coming in on you but it it doesn't matter you have to get out there because it's better to
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:32.320]  do it now than to be behind further behind the eight ball and try to do it later and you always
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:37.360]  speak out on that and I'm glad that you do and then the next point uh that I wanted to make
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:42.720]  was the power of preparedness which is awesome I have called the tip line before and said hey this
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:48.240]  is a huge market this is a year ago this is one they quote unquote quickening we were starting
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:52.640]  to feel that I spoke to you about it I know I need to I need to promote that more because

[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:15.760]  media operation to be able to fight the globalists and hopefully back them off but if people aren't
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:21.920]  getting prepared they are insane there is a very good chance there's going to be a catastrophic
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:27.840]  depression hopefully we back it off and it's just a depression slash recession but I mean I've got
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:33.360]  the economic stack here Moody's is saying negative outlook that Europe's going to implode that CNBC

[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:25.680]  hand side of drudge report dot com tsa now grabbing people's drinks after they go to the checkpoints
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:32.080]  something buy at starbucks or mcdonald's they they come and grab your drinks right after they see
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:36.560]  you buy it as just an act of pure domination i'm explaining why they're doing that and rolling
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:40.960]  checkpoints out of the streets and we've got mike adams popping in for about 1015 minutes to talk
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:48.480]  about this incredible new blitzkrieg uh pr campaign where they're coming out and saying that oh you
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:54.560]  know what organic you don't need that's not good no stuff with pesticides in it it's really good for
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:59.760]  you uh so we're going to be uh breaking all of that down now i'm going to do an official
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:10.640]  analysis of this coming up in the next few days it's on my radar to shoot a special video and
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:15.360]  put it together for the nightly news and the radio because this film was so profound
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:22.160]  that i i think i'm going to go back and see it again uh because i'm going to be honest
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:28.960]  with everybody i had a couple red wine uh toddy's uh saturday night i got a completely
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:34.400]  quit drinking i mean i mean why exercise jog run do all this and then and swim and then and then
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:39.600]  still you know eat chocolate cake like i did last night and drink red wine uh but long story short
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:45.360]  i went with my buddy shane steiner and his girlfriend and my wife had a great time uh i was
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:53.680]  thinking yeah this will just be a neocon movie and it was anything but a neocon movie except for
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:11:01.040]  one facet and freaked me out quite frankly because i knew everything in the film but the
[02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:09.760]  but the fact that dinesh desuza would come out with something like this shows very high level
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:16.080]  globalist connections and so either he's a very smart guy who just hasn't broken through to the
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:22.480]  final level or he's a really evil person because if you put something out like this that's actually
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:31.200]  very thoughtful and and and and deep but and very well cinematography was done very well
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:37.840]  a very impressive style kind of a new style i have to say if you put something out like this
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:49.360]  and have that level of knowledge but don't give people everything it made me very upset so uh
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:54.720]  you know here i am plugging it it was only a few theaters a couple weeks ago uh and now it's in
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:12:01.920]  theaters everywhere and it's been selling out if you really want to get a bare knuckles film
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:08.320]  not cinematically as gorgeous some spots of it are then you want to see the obama deception
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:12.480]  free online and see more than 40 million times on youtube and google video alone
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:17.840]  because even though it was made three and a half years ago it will really explain
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:27.280]  what's going on uh with obama um this film didn't and again i wrote some notes while i was in the
[02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:33.280]  theater but it was like nine o'clock at night and uh i was sitting there holding my wife's hand and i
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:39.920]  didn't really i didn't really uh go over all the points i wanted to so i think i'm probably gonna
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:47.600]  go see it probably the night or something and then i will uh write a bunch of notes up on obama 2016
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:58.320]  and uh do an official breakdown of 2016's obama's america but here's here's the basic fact at the
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:07.200]  heart of it the author who had a bestseller in 2010 who was a big uh reaganite born in india
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:09.200]  uh dinesh disosa
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:22.320]  he wrote it and co-directed the film with um john sullivan was produced by jerald r molan
[02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:29.600]  it's based on his 2010 bestseller the roots of obama's rage
[02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:40.080]  now here's where the film is accurate and it does kind of talk to you like you're eight years old
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:44.160]  but for the general public that's an advanced political concept most political stuff is at the
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:51.840]  age of about a four-year-old uh bob the builder can we build it yes we can you've you've obama
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:56.880]  tells bob the builder that he didn't actually build that people that animate the series on pbs
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:02.800]  didn't actually animate it um so obama says to bob the builder and the makers uh you didn't build
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:09.440]  that but thanks for the theme song and thanks for the catchphrase uh little attempted humor folks
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:14.800]  that i thought of because you know i marvel at that every once while i let my kids watch tv and
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:20.480]  bob builder was one of them uh and uh you know i noticed when obama was running four four and a
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:27.200]  half years ago and it started you know yes we can you know bob the builder can we build it yes we
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:32.080]  can see that's how my brain works i'm kind of digressing you know normal political propaganda
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:37.600]  is at about a four-year-old level this is about a six or seven eight-year-old so i i found that
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:44.240]  i found that refreshing if you want something at a uh college freshman level it's it's simple it's
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:48.000]  laid out but there'll be some terms you'll want to write down some things you want to look into if
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:52.720]  you know i don't think you're idiots like the globalists admit they've dumbed things down to
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:58.480]  create a feedback loop to make you have a child like mine my answer is just give you sophisticated
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:06.400]  ideas and uh that you will then you know be able to deal with it but i think you're winners you know
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:11.040]  i don't think you should all be exterminated i'd like to try to build myself up and everybody else
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:17.680]  up you know i can kind of feel the uh you know the karma you know the the reports you show whatever
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:22.560]  you want to call it that just the idea of dumbing people down or keeping them in the dark to control
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:33.520]  them just makes my soul shake soul shaking yeah the old timers you know what they were talking about
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:38.480]  why do they say you shake when you're doing evil things
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:48.160]  because your soul's quaking you're going against god's law your body doesn't want to do it
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:54.720]  okay getting back to the film
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:15:59.760]  at its core
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:11.520]  it explains that obama came from kenya so it kind of props up that foggy foggy thing we
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:17.360]  know who he really says he isn't true we know he has this huge cia background they don't mention
[02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:23.520]  any of that they kind of follow a lot of false narratives at that level but the big thing they
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:30.080]  explain that is true is that obama wants to destroy america he wants to hurt america he wants to
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:36.320]  impoverish america and he wants to lower our standard not build up the third world because the
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:41.760]  globalists actually say this i mean the the the the writer of the film that knows what he's talking
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:50.000]  about the globalists want a post industrial world only certain reservations of high tech
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.080]  government and industry will be allowed to go into the future the rest of us are to be walled off
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:59.520]  the un is to be all powerful as another un you know minion is in the news saying today
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:05.360]  top asian first minister global un police force to enforce global government
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:12.320]  well asian first minister the secretary of the security council will pave the way to setting up
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:16.640]  a world parliament and a world cabinet making the un the most powerful
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:23.120]  powerful in the world and having full authority on earth full authority on earth what i mean is
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:27.280]  that sound good just the common sense out there to have one big giant authority that can't be
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:34.320]  checked or balanced no it sounds like uh antichrist stuff doesn't it but the point is
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:41.360]  wow to have republicans actually be honest and say because i mean you start letting
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:49.920]  truths out like that they're not going away that obama is a globalist who is anti-colonialist
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:55.920]  and so he doesn't want to raise up the other countries he wants to lower everybody because
[02:17:55.920 --> 02:18:01.840]  that's the big secret in the Copenhagen treaty they want to have double the shutdown of industry
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:06.880]  right at double in the third world what happens here and the money that they take from the rich west
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:11.600]  doesn't go to the warp folks to build them up it goes to the global government to dominate everybody
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:17.520]  because the name of the game is control so to make a long story short i'll do a full review i'm
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:25.600]  gonna go see it again so i can write notes is that they don't explain to you though they almost
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:29.840]  act like colonialism is good well they don't almost they talk to what they say is obama's brother
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:36.960]  and uh the brother talks about how things got worse once the colonialists left well because
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:42.880]  the colonialists were never kicked out they learned to claim they pulled out leave their
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:47.760]  corporate interest in there and let puppets come and go so they could do 10 times the abuse of you
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:53.200]  they just quit calling it colonialism and called it globalism and the only place where
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:19:00.640]  colonialism is really being practiced in the old way is in the old world and the first world old
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:08.880]  europe eastern europe areas but uh irussia some areas of asia but also in the industrialized
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:14.240]  world it's a post-industrial world where the economy is designed not to expand but to contract
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:21.040]  and all the policies done in the third world to block development and things in the old days
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:26.720]  under colonialism and only let the central nation states of germany the dutch the french the spanish
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:32.240]  the us has been imperial for 150 years at least in the past you did only have the central
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:38.960]  predatory tribal country allowing finished goods our country had the revolutionary war
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:42.400]  mainly over the fact they wouldn't let you have value added finished goods here
[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:50.640]  so they go over that but don't explain that the globalist are engaging in that that's why they
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:55.280]  pay to ship our jobs overseas and put laws in where we can't build and shut us down they're
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:20:02.240]  practicing colonialism on us but not by nations the banks are doing it the worst drought in 50

[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:13.680]  all right i'm going to go back to your phone calls and then mike adams is coming up for a
[02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:18.160]  quick update and then more of your calls after that and other important news but but finishing
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:22.800]  up with obama 2016 i'm going to have to go see it again and write notes because there were so many
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:27.760]  points and we're probably going to get dinesh to so on the broadcast as well but the point is
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:33.920]  it's a totally different angle and it's more accurate than just saying obama's a muslim who
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:43.120]  wants to kill us i mean really he is a globalist but dinesh is just saying no he's somebody that's
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:47.600]  more of a socialist or communist who wants to redistribute your wealth to the third world
[02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:57.520]  but it's it's more sophisticated than that you've got the colonialist which were conquered by finance
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:05.840]  capitalist to a great extent by 1815 and then expanding from then on out with 1930 in our country
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:12.240]  who aren't just trying to use western wealth to dominate the third world but that are using
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:17.440]  colonial policies here domestically on us for those that haven't read the writings
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:21.200]  of george washington thomas jefferson benjamin franklin why were they so mad
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:27.840]  they couldn't get a license to ship goods to england you had to go through certain british
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:33.360]  traders even though they were british citizens who came from good families to boot only people
[02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:39.200]  from england were allowed to ship it back to the empire they were treated like a pure colonial
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:44.160]  situation because they were they were colonies but they had rights as englishmen that there had
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:49.520]  been multiple civil wars over in england so really the civil wars of that country came here
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:55.520]  it's not like we were against england it was a continuation of people saying look i go out here
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:01.200]  and clear all this land and then i'm not allowed to even have it i've got to sell it to a land broker
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:07.200]  who's got a connection to the governor so it was this nepotism and a few insiders it was monopoly
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:14.560]  crony capitalism and they were like we don't like this we you weren't allowed to have a gun you
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:20.080]  couldn't make a shovel you couldn't make a rake you you couldn't build something that's why they
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:25.520]  have the stamp act not just to come in and put stamps on things in your house as a property tax
[02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:32.160]  but to also come and know what you had because well you this rake doesn't have a certified
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:37.840]  mark that it was made in england or that it came in on a ship you're not allowed to have value added
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:42.640]  people are like hey man i'm a good blacksmith i want to make guns i want to make hoes i want to
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:48.560]  make pickaxes well you can't george washington wrote about he had all this land they worked hard on
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:57.040]  growing hemp you name it and to buy a gentleman's clothes he'd have to pay 20 times what they cost
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:01.840]  in london or if somebody made him there to have the finished product his carriage i've read his
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:05.760]  letters you know the green and black carriage he had that you had to have for business you know to
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:10.320]  you know to put on the airs uh what you know cost 30 40 times what it should have and he had to go
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:15.680]  through these corrupt brokers and all this stuff uh he couldn't he had to get a special military
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:20.640]  commission to be able to get around all that they wouldn't give it to him even though he'd been the
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:25.920]  militia leader uh and and you know helped expand all these territories and been in all these
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:32.560]  and been in all these battles that's what it was really all about and see that's what colonialism
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:37.040]  isn't just the liberal version of evil white people going and taking over areas in many you
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:41.680]  you know respects with the christian missionaries and people they actually helped bring industry
[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:46.640]  and did actually build people up in earlier colonialism there were certainly abuses but
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:50.480]  they really wanted to build them up and educate them so they could quote save their souls
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:57.440]  but if you get into later colonialism and and it's a complex issue it's hard to boil it all
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:28:02.800]  down and simplify it it you know they realized hey let's not build up anything let's keep them in
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:10.000]  squalor purely export raw materials out of the countries send them back to the mother empire
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:15.200]  and use that as a tool of control both the control the raw materials that you overcharge
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:21.440]  uh the manufacturer is for and then you overcharge people that are buying it back in the colonial
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:26.880]  holdings when the when the finished goods come back in and so if you look at globalism shutting
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:31.120]  down our industry shutting down our power plants tax incentives to move to china 22
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:36.640]  billion to move general motors of china in the vault and catalact factories really what it is
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:43.840]  is a twisted neocolonialism that's full spectrum dominance against the third world but also the
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:48.720]  first world but because they can control the third world better like china a mega third world
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:54.720]  old world they are using that as the new command base to leverage out not to just dominate commerce
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:29:00.400]  but to end commerce once they're done imploding our economies they're going to implode the chinese
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:06.400]  economy and then try to bring in a global collapse where again the bankers loan out more fiat they
[02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:12.160]  control to further consolidate and dominate towards a global government that's dictatorial
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:17.680]  that can launch wars and release bio weapons to reduce populations and force inoculations
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:22.560]  on populations worldwide as they've stated they'll do to again sterilize and reduce population to
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:29.360]  take the chinese population reduction model and expand it worldwide so that's what's happening
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:35.520]  obama is an anti-colonialist he's the ultimate colonialist but it's true that he wants to destroy
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:43.680]  our industry but because he's a globalist engaging in neo feudalistic colonialism
[02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:50.880]  against the west the new world order is colonizing the west it's banks not countries we're on the
[02:29:50.880 --> 02:29:57.040]  march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:32.240]  and now i didn't think i knew was that he said war was too important to be left to the generals
[02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:41.040]  when he said that 50 years ago he might have been right but today war is too important to be

[02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:13.120]  well actually i do know him and i want to give everybody the truth of obama he is a cia global
[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:18.880]  created minion who wants to destroy america the cia itself is created by foreign banks
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:24.000]  out of os s and the national security act and has been strangling the republic ever since shipping
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:30.640]  and narcotics uh funding miss magazine to destroy the family uh funding and controlling unesco to
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:38.800]  demonize and confuse people's sexual orientation uh that's what's going on on that front the nsa
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:44.240]  openly spies on us without warrants illegally and the other makers of this film do admit obama
[02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:48.400]  wants to destroy our country which is a big admission by republicans but because he's
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:54.400]  anti-colonial no our countries are seen by the global bankers that are colonizing with a new
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:35:00.880]  form of deindustrialization where they reverse development they go in and wreck things to consolidate
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:06.160]  it to make you poor to control you so it's a process of racing to the bottom by design as
[02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:14.160]  ross perot warned so it's a new type of extermination capitalism uh which uses socialism to control
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:19.280]  people at the grassroots but but crony monopoly capitalism on the top so i don't know what you
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:26.320]  call it neo uh feudalistic neo feudalistic
[02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:38.320]  the best term would be neo feudalistic colonialism neo eugenics based neo feudalistic eugenics based
[02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:46.080]  planetary bankster controlled finance capital controlled
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:51.440]  uh colonialism or to give it a short term
[02:35:55.520 --> 02:36:02.320]  world government of foreign by private banking cartels to establish a deindustrialized
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:11.360]  neo feudalistic surf based colonialism or just hell on earth would be a better term
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:19.920]  uh a standardizing evil standardizing destruction uh satan's plan i mean i don't i don't know what
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:27.760]  you call something this wicked uh but uh banning gardens worldwide murder u n murdering villagers
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:35.760]  from latin america to asia from berma to nigeria just just lining whole villages up machine gunning
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:41.280]  them back of the newspaper al-qaeda lining people up shooting them blowing up churches all nato
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:46.320]  funded just hell on earth for about 10 minutes mike adams joins us and i promise i'll get to
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:52.240]  the callers who've been holding the longest like ron and cliff and billy and shon and fred i'll
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:58.800]  at least get to all of you uh but i mean that's it that no no this is the new model of colonialism
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:06.960]  globalism is banker occupation banker colonialism where they where they colonize your family they
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:12.720]  colonize your body they kill you they own the medical system they never say why is everybody
[02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:17.680]  getting cancer it's like oh we got treatments they're giving it to you it's colonization by satan
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:23.360]  basically i you know it's it's it's it's it's it's the royal commission of 49 put out by the british
[02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:28.640]  but now that we're so close to it they spin it and say oh there's no mention of globalism
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:34.080]  oh no he wants globalism to help the poor no no globalism is colonialism under a new name
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:40.160]  but not an old-fashioned colonialism that actually had some good points to it does it depend on how
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:49.120]  it was implemented all right i'm done i'm done they sell colonialism like it's good while claiming
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:53.360]  while claiming obama's against it when he's carrying out a modern particularly carcinogenic
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:59.040]  form of it it it's just but i want to talk to the filmmaker to see if he has some of these
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:04.160]  intellectuals are smart but to a level because they're not bad people they can't imagine what's
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:09.760]  really going on oh it makes my brain burn okay shifting gears is something incredibly important
[02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:15.040]  i thought of one guy last night when i saw this my wife goes uh oh it's on yahoo uh oh it's on
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:22.560]  wire uh oh it's on drudge it's everywhere there's a full tilt rollout abc news cnn new york times
[02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:29.680]  stanford the research institute in there with darpa they say organic isn't any better than
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:34.560]  regular and before i read the articles i said it's going to admit it has the same mineral or
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:38.080]  vitamin content which has been proven in independent studies not be true you're on the
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:42.640]  nerve and other old-fashioned forms are on good soils with with with with you know all sorts
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:46.640]  of bacteria in it there's all sorts of trace elements you name it they only looked at narrowly
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:51.120]  defined vitamins and minerals a lower spectrum than what you really need because i've read part
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:57.040]  of the study it's long and they go on to admit in footnotes oh but there are pesticides herbicides
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:03.360]  other toxic chemicals in the cheap pesticides they're using it's really just toxic waste uh
[02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:07.440]  you know fluoride you name it but even high doses is everybody's a little bit of fluoride
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:17.520]  mercury lead all of this is in there uh and they go on to say yeah and there's hormones too yes
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:24.400]  and then no discussion of the gmo angle that it's genetically modified in all those studies it's
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:30.160]  causing all sorts of reproductive problems in the lab rats in the mammals uh that it's given to
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:36.560]  so there's no discussion it's like there's the same calorie nutrient content it actually say in
[02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:45.280]  compared to grass fed which is just asinine and it's because they're desperate they're losing
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:50.160]  folks they can be defeated these people may be ruthless and in control but they've been pushed
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:54.080]  back and defeated many times they've just never been routed out and if we ever push them all the
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:57.360]  way back we've got to route them out because this stuff's like cancer it'll come right back
[02:39:58.960 --> 02:40:03.520]  again they're not all powerful this same elite inner bread in england back in 1850 for three
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:08.000]  generations and created monstrosities thinking it would create supermen they've got a scientific
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:12.400]  nightmare plan but it's an old one they won't deviate from they can be defeated we know their plan
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:18.000]  and so it goes overall this but michelle obama says in her second term they want to impact
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:23.600]  nature of food and grocery stores put taxes on fat salt you name it but nothing about additives
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:29.280]  nothing about all the additives and tv dinners of silicone and petrochemicals in it toxic waste
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:35.280]  addictive toxic no discussion of bad fats versus good fats burned fats trans fats versus healthy
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:40.640]  fats like fish oil the omegas all those no no just federal control over your foods like they're
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:46.880]  trying to do in in a beta test in new york stanford scientists cast doubt on advantages of
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:54.880]  organic meat and produce that's new york times here's another one study sees no nutritional
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:41:00.000]  edge in organic food usa today organic food to a healthier than nonorganic food but always
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.320]  the fine print oh but we're not talking about all the pesticides or the dead soil or the or the or
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:09.440]  the or the total lie but you tell it's a pr rollout it's everywhere organic farms aren't necessarily
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:16.160]  better for environment and it goes on and on now let's just stop right there what they don't explain
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:22.400]  to you is again all the pesticides and the rest of it or that the elites themselves from china
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:27.600]  to the united states from monsanto laboratories to billum linda gates facilities it's total
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:34.880]  organic total filtered water obsession absolutely totally obsessed all of them are obsessed with
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:40.640]  nothing but pure organic it's on record look it up because they know they are trojan horsing us
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:44.080]  their eugenic system they've been caught doing it i give you mike adams the health ranger
[02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:49.600]  has a new article just went up at info wars dot com and natural news dot com flawed organic food
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:54.800]  study really just a media psiop to confuse the public about organics when pushing gmo's and you
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:58.560]  know why i read his article it's excellent we're going to go over it the one area he didn't cover
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:04.160]  is well he didn't cover it but not they're at a tipping point once more people want organic than
[02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:08.480]  the other suddenly it's going to get cheaper because competition comes into the market and they
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:13.200]  know everyone when given the choice will go for organic because it tastes better looks better last
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:18.720]  longer everything there's about to be a tipping point we are on the verge of a tipping point and
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:24.880]  i predict false flags against organic food producers where psiops will put stuff in the
[02:42:24.880 --> 02:42:29.920]  food to demonize organic i predict that next i know the enemy i know their mind mike adams
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:34.560]  thanks for popping in i'm ranting give us your take on this thank you alex but you're you're
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:40.240]  right on the money on this this is a total media psiop and it's probably no coincidence that this
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:46.080]  is happening right as proposition 37 is being considered in california that's the proposition
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:50.800]  that would simply require genetically modified organisms to be labeled on the foods so we know
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:54.880]  what we're eating we can make a consumer choice in a free market when we have good information
[02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:59.760]  but they're resisting that you also mentioned something else that's huge the reason that they're
[02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:04.960]  so desperate coming out with this kind of information now is because we in the alternative
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:11.360]  media in the alternative movements have been so successful at educating people about gmo's
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:16.560]  about pesticides and how they cause Alzheimer's and dementia and cancer and many other terrible
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:22.000]  health conditions lower IQ in societies that have a pesticide i mean if it kills bugs it
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:26.960]  hurts your brain hey and don't forget there's a there's a form of fluoride called cryolite
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:32.160]  that is sprayed as an insecticide on grapes and other crops they don't tell you about that you
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:38.080]  don't find that in organic foods either now this the media spin on this study is complete hogwash
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:44.400]  it is a total lie not a not a bit of truth in it first of all the study so-called study is actually
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:51.200]  just a review they did not test one single food for this they reviewed they admit dozens of studies
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:57.280]  they cherry picked exactly and even when they did that they found that organic foods have
[02:43:57.280 --> 02:44:03.840]  significantly lower levels of pesticide exposure and significantly lower levels of super bugs the
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:10.880]  antibiotic resistant uh MRSA or bacteria strains that can kill you they admitted that that organic
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:16.160]  food has lower levels of that and lower levels of pesticide but then you've got the media spinning
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:20.960]  this and saying oh it's no different it's it's extraordinary but it's it's a full-on
[02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:26.720]  si-op assault on organic foods and i think you're right they're probably going to false flag the
[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:32.080]  organic foods industry well i mean i know they're playbook it's it's it's not like it's like i'm a
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:36.800]  high school football coach that's played another coach from across town for 15 years who's never
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:41.280]  changed his playbook i know what they're gonna do i know how they're do you agree with me because i
[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:46.320]  don't just say this to give you know the troops good news i just report what i find we're at a
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:51.600]  tipping point the system knows it they're panicking that's why they're moving on all fronts the the
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:57.440]  consciousness is awakening people are either going deeper into denial or awakening but those of us
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:03.040]  that are awake are the equivalent of 20 regular zombies and so we're now causing an exponential
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:10.000]  awakening the tipping point alex is that people are tired of being poisoned i don't care where
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:15.280]  what political spectrum you come from if you're a tree hugger if you're a patriot if you're a
[02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:19.680]  libertarian you don't want to be poisoned and you don't want to poison your children with fluoride
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:26.240]  and gmo's and pesticide residue that the corporations have been lying to us for decades over
[02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:31.600]  even generations saying it's safe meanwhile cancer rates are skyrocketing alzheimer's is the next
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:36.880]  new big profiteering disease that big farmers counting on and there's no discussion of why
[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:40.720]  is it up thousands of percentage points and neurology they don't call it alzheimer's when
[02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:47.040]  your 25 year old gets it they go neurological diseases are way up right and autism autism now
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:51.520]  i mean look look at the skyrocketing rates of autism there has got to be a chemical component
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:55.680]  to this we know vaccines are probably involved it's part of the cocktail trigger yeah let me ask
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:46:03.760]  you that if it's gone from one in 25 350 something uh 30 something years ago to one in 58 uh depending
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:09.280]  on the study summer in south korea it's like one in 30 something uh what is that thousand percentile
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:14.000]  point increase is that like how many thousands of percentile increases that it's like tens of
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:19.040]  thousands of percent increase uh i i don't i don't have the math right in my head on that but it's
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:23.600]  it's a huge huge increase if you actually do the math and they and the scientists can't explain it
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:28.480]  they said well it couldn't be anything in the food it couldn't be the vaccines meanwhile you've
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:34.000]  got children in india getting polio from the polio vaccines i mean the vaccines are causing the
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:43.920]  diseases it's my grandfather used a cyanide based anti uh fly medication on his cows and he and all
[02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:48.720]  the ranchers that ended up using it all of them ended up dying of lung cancer when they were 50
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:53.440]  something years old it wasn't i mean and then later it came out that pesticide if you breathe it you
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:57.760]  were dead it's kind of like our troops breathing the du it's a death sentence but they didn't care
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:03.920]  they they remember this is a big this this story about attacking organics is really designed to
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:10.320]  confuse the public so that they can make people eat gmo's and think that gmo crops are identical
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:17.120]  to conventional crops that is a line straight out of monsanto's playbook that's exactly what they say
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:21.760]  except when they go to the us path in office they say no give us a monopoly over the sea because
[02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:26.400]  it's different so on one hand they say it's the same as regular foods but on the other hand they
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:30.880]  say it's different give us a patent and they get the patent so how can it be the same and be different
[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:36.800]  at the same time do we know why bt corn in all the big studies people just type in uh gmo's link
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:42.480]  to organ failure deformities in in in lab animals you'll get thousands of reports i mean it's not
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:46.800]  debated clearly from when i researched they're engineering things into there that aren't just
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:52.240]  the traits they're stacking or claiming but i mean what what's happening when the rats are dying
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:56.880]  but we're supposed to eat it well yeah the rats are dying the cats are dying when they conduct
[02:47:56.880 --> 02:48:02.800]  these experiments on cats with chemical exposure they're now finding what's called transgenerational
[02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:09.040]  epigenetic inheritance which means that if you are exposed to pesticides and fungicides today
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:13.680]  your great-grandchildren will exhibit the neurological damaging effects of those
[02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:20.160]  same fungicides even if they themselves were never exposed to them alex this is a multi-generational
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:25.600]  poison and by the way they mentioned that in the science fiction movie the island where it's a clone
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.000]  but it still gets the memories of its other clone that's an exaggeration but you're right
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:35.760]  the genetic engineers have now proven there is genetic memory not just instinct being passed
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:41.920]  so our retardation literally in our genetic code in the 94% they said was junk it wasn't
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:47.440]  those recordings are now being passed to our children and our very genetic code is being damaged
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:53.200]  talk about absolute crime not just killing one person but robbing the species of its vigor
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:49:00.880]  absolute evil alex this is this is the attempted annihilation of the genetic line of most of the
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:06.800]  population through the foods through the fluoride through the vaccines this is genocide and and the
[02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:12.240]  the mainstream media is going along with it and saying eat the poison poison your children just go
[02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:17.040]  along with it don't worry you know be confused maybe you'll just buy the poison and you won't
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:21.040]  know the difference and notice we're the command base the whole world saying no they'll go and
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:26.000]  militarily implant in countries like brazil france where the farmers burn it down because they know
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:30.880]  what's going on here we are leading the world in all these diseases because we're the beta test
[02:49:30.880 --> 02:49:36.080]  because we were the freest we're the folks the globalist hate they're soft killing us you know
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:41.760]  obama apologized a year ago or so for the the experiments on the guatemalan prisoners that
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:46.080]  the the medical experiments funded by the u.s. government back in the i think the 1940s those
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:50.480]  on children too they shot them up with syphilis absolutely yeah what about the experiments
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:56.960]  taking place on the entire consuming population today gms are an experiment a medical experiment
[02:49:56.960 --> 02:50:02.640]  the vaccines are all experiments these pesticides are experiments we're all lab rats worse than
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:07.760]  guatemala where's the apology or even the recognition of that we're all going to be felidimide
[02:50:08.720 --> 02:50:13.120]  babies in the next few generations it's we're going to be we're being killed alex well they
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:16.960]  killed us no i mean hitler lined me up and shot you and he got caught and got in trouble
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:20.400]  and they said they went underground they wrote white papers it's in my film and again they said
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:23.040]  we're going to pose as liberals and we're going to put it in the food and water we're going to kill
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:27.440]  everybody and then we'll make money as we kill them running the hospitals and we'll have brainwashed
[02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:32.000]  doctors that are compartmentalized they just want to drive around their jet boats all day uh who'll
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:37.280]  who'll kill people for us who aren't even really conscious of it they're just lazy yeah well well
[02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:43.760]  my message to all patriots anybody who wants to have a future is eat gmo's avoid the poise
[02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:51.600]  avoid gmo's avoid the poisons eat only organics uh pardon my my misspeak there god they're starting
[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:56.080]  to get into my brain now the globalists all of you that love the system eat nothing but mcdonald's
[02:50:57.120 --> 02:51:01.680]  right take your vaccine shots eat more gmo's it's it's insane drink your fluoride
[02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:05.760]  i mean did you see the fluoride story that we did last week where the chinese companies that
[02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:10.720]  export it say oh this is a pesticide this is a nuclear industry chemical and you can put it in
[02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:14.720]  your water i mean that's the way they openly describe they also admit again the main exporter
[02:51:14.720 --> 02:51:20.400]  worldwide is china but the the u.s produces a lot of its own out of florida and in places like that
[02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:25.360]  they admit there's hundreds of other chemicals in this stuff this is the poison they can't put in
[02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:30.800]  the fertilizer because they mine that out of these mines for folks that don't know limestone mines
[02:51:30.800 --> 02:51:36.720]  same place one of the biggest manufacturers is uranium mines they take the extra waste and put
[02:51:36.720 --> 02:51:41.920]  it in our water and just call it uh the hydrofluosilic acid or however you actually pronounce it
[02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:46.800]  and then people get confused with calcium fluoride that you do need a little bit of that's in some
[02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:51.040]  of the young jevity products and others a tiny amount to activate other minerals and vitamins
[02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:56.000]  they don't know that's different than the other variants we're talking about which are in massive
[02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:02.240]  amounts and toxic yes it's completely different and and the poison is in the dose so you can you
[02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:07.760]  can handle in fact your body needs trace elements of these so-called even even heavy metals you need
[02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:12.640]  a little bit well when they give you massive amounts of the hydrofluosilic acid if i'm pronouncing
[02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:17.120]  right and all the others from the scientists i've talked to it then blocks the uptake of all the
[02:52:17.120 --> 02:52:22.400]  other uh uh minerals and things that's why they overdose you with that and then it acts as an
[02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:27.920]  adjuvant to accelerate the other chemicals they're putting in but the bottom line is that patriots
[02:52:27.920 --> 02:52:32.400]  need to know that you're going to take care of your body if you want to have a chance at anything
[02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:36.720]  i mean we you have to maintain your cognitive function your brain needs to be able to work
[02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:41.360]  so you can think critically so you can stay awake your listeners alex talk about being
[02:52:41.360 --> 02:52:45.520]  awakened how are you going to stay awake you got to get off these chemicals if you want to stay
[02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:50.160]  awake otherwise you're just going to be a zombified drone like most of the population today
[02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:54.080]  in closings i'm going to hit a few final calls i appreciate you popping in your articles excellent
[02:52:54.080 --> 02:52:59.760]  breaking this down at naturalnews.com and prismplanet.com and infowars.com right now get this out to
[02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:04.320]  everybody fight back against their tyranny i'm going to send it out on twitter as soon as this hour
[02:53:04.320 --> 02:53:08.960]  ends at real alex jones here in a moment but in closing do you agree with me though that this is a
[02:53:08.960 --> 02:53:14.720]  desperation when they're now trying to tell people that organic you know is the same except there are
[02:53:14.720 --> 02:53:21.600]  some pesticides and stuff in it uh i mean this seems like they're desperate they're clearly desperate
[02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:26.640]  and it's it's a result of the success of organizations like infowars and your show
[02:53:27.360 --> 02:53:32.400]  actually telling the truth about the importance of nutrition in establishing freedom and liberty
[02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:37.360]  if you want to be a free person you have to be a healthy person and not be a victim's slave to
[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:42.480]  the medical establishment and you've been really powerful our listeners have it it's so important
[02:53:42.480 --> 02:53:46.880]  for them to get this out great job mike adams talk to you again soon thank you take care there goes
[02:53:46.880 --> 02:53:50.960]  mike let's jam in some calls i didn't even get to this yet i mentioned it but i'm gonna cover on
[02:53:50.960 --> 02:53:54.560]  the nightly news tonight and tomorrow and more detail activists put on terror watch list to
[02:53:54.560 --> 02:54:00.960]  prevent him from protesting dnc and they arrested him saying protesting is terrorism and it says
[02:54:00.960 --> 02:54:06.560]  in the manual that protesting is illegal and that it's terrorism and they asked prosecutors to keep
[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:15.280]  him in jail so that he couldn't protest i mean it's it's it's it's like soviet russia or something

[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:47.280]  balaska purchased a bottled water drank some of it put it in my backpack got in line to get on the
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:52.240]  airplane and i was pulled out of line so that they could actually test the water that i had just
[02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:56.880]  purchased uh from one of the vendors and again they say well it might be a bomb they've already
[02:54:56.880 --> 02:55:01.840]  searched you going through but they even stand outside the starbucks that's the footage we have
[02:55:01.840 --> 02:55:07.520]  and and you get the coffee and they do it and they even laugh it's a big joke that i'm the government
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:13.120]  i'm going to stick something in your drink take your shoes off it's meant to make you feel vulnerable
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:21.040]  it's meant to make you feel like just any demand you're going to follow yes sir oh thank you very
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:24.800]  much for your work and well thank you what did you say to him what did you say when they wanted
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:30.960]  to search your water well uh it was interesting that uh 100 percent of the time i'm actually
[02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:38.000]  selected for the extra uh random security checks and uh they uh the two ladies who were in charge
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:43.280]  sent a young boy over and they looked through the line and they looked at me and and uh i can be quite
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:49.200]  belittling to people but i simply stared them down and uh asked them why they were doing this
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:53.680]  and they told me they were looking for fumes for explosives yeah and again they knew you're getting
[02:55:53.680 --> 02:55:58.480]  on the plane you're at a layover you'd bought the water there you're past their stupid checkpoint
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:02.240]  where they teach you how to be a slave so they can then roll it out on the streets and again it's
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:06.880]  about them getting their hands on you then putting things in your drinks soon they admit they're
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:12.000]  going to want to take dna they're downloading your laptops and phones it's total prisoner
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:16.560]  induction training this is what happens to you when you get to prison thank you for the call ron

[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:36.320]  got too much going on but i want to i want to come to tennessee what's on your mind well there's a
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:42.160]  man named win wooly who who's from houston texas there said he's been on he's on your show okay
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:47.840]  i wrote him a couple years ago and michael savage saying that you have um actually been on russian tv
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:53.920]  and stuff like that and just some really strange things mr wooly was saying about you i don't know
[02:56:53.920 --> 02:56:58.800]  if you're familiar with it i think that's how his name is pronounced is it about george wooly
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:04.800]  he has said that you had talked a lot of times with this were roose person or something i don't
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:11.360]  know i again i go on all sorts of news and yeah that is a talking point that i may uh that i work
[02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:19.040]  for the russians because i've been on japanese tv uh been on israeli tv russian tv us tv
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:24.560]  canadian tv i'm just to the guy from texas who wants freedom you know my fruits are liberty and
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:30.160]  freedom but i don't know the wooly guy you're talking about i i know a i think a george
[02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:36.080]  lynn wooly a guy protested abortion with her in town a conservative uh but i mean what's your question
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:41.760]  well i'm wondering what credibility he has maybe there's some things that he's not telling people
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:48.160]  that you know about him i i don't know who the person is but uh no i i work for the bill of
[02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:54.400]  rights the constitution of my family don't work for latimer putin or anything but i do go on television
[02:57:54.400 --> 02:57:59.600]  shows and talk about liberty and the bill of rights and constitution and i know these neocon shows
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:05.360]  that has been a talking point because i've seen some other people uh come out and say it and they
[02:58:05.360 --> 02:58:12.560]  have tiny audiences uh and i mean it's not it's a way to change the subject i'm like hey fluoride's

[02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:55.840]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half
[02:58:55.840 --> 02:59:01.520]  year on record 78 percent of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy
[02:59:01.520 --> 02:59:07.040]  alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[02:59:07.040 --> 02:59:11.440]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy
[02:59:11.440 --> 02:59:16.640]  to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods
[02:59:16.640 --> 02:59:21.360]  from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise
[02:59:21.360 --> 02:59:26.160]  prices too now is the time to get your supply i recently increased my supply from e-foods direct
[02:59:26.160 --> 02:59:30.800]  because we've all known this was coming you know about their delicious long-term storeable foods
[02:59:30.800 --> 02:59:35.280]  the fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it stores for 25 years
[02:59:35.280 --> 02:59:41.200]  you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost don't wait call 800-409-5633

[02:59:56.400 --> 03:00:09.040]  to the alex jones broadcasting network
[03:00:09.040 --> 03:00:15.440]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:20.720]  i'm taking a few final calls and overdrive here a ton of the key information coming up
[03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:27.760]  retransmission on some m&f stations that carry the fourth hour and xm and others you know i just
[03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:33.440]  had a caller if you just joined us who was like i heard this guy on these shows saying you're with
[03:00:33.440 --> 03:00:38.080]  lentil aroush and the russians or something i don't agree with lentil aroush's solutions i
[03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:45.840]  his analysis of the colonial model worldwide through globalism is accurate but the globalist
[03:00:45.840 --> 03:00:50.560]  are colonizing our countries deindustrializing us like they used to do third world countries
[03:00:50.560 --> 03:00:57.760]  or primitive countries and then it just changes the subject off of things i mean are the russians
[03:00:57.760 --> 03:01:02.800]  here with tsa checkpoints sticking their hands on our pants uh are the russians putting al-qaeda
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:09.200]  in charge in libyan syria it's a way to change the subject uh and try to project a cold war era
[03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:15.040]  stuff on americans who were trying to defend this republic that's my point on that uh let's
[03:01:15.040 --> 03:01:19.360]  i wish i had a more time with that call but we're almost out of time shawning california here on the
[03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:26.240]  air welcome hey all right done bud thanks for taking my call hey good to hear from you cool i just
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:31.360]  wanted to uh talk about something that you touched on the other day and it was that the elite are
[03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:35.760]  poisoning us and keeping the cures for themselves and i wanted to speak on that when i was 14 years
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:41.040]  old in 1994 i was in lost day just into that and one of my buddies had a dad who was real secretive
[03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:44.880]  and every now and then people would come in and give him a bunch of dollar bills and go into the
[03:01:44.880 --> 03:01:49.680]  back room of an apartment and we were asking dude what what what did he feel paying all that money
[03:01:49.680 --> 03:01:53.760]  for to go into that back room he's like i can't tell you i can't tell you and eventually we told
[03:01:53.760 --> 03:01:57.040]  him look baby we're gonna keep you in that door when you're in the restroom we want to know what's
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:01.840]  in there he's like all right i'll tell you but you can't tell anybody or my father will be erased
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:06.560]  and that's the word he used i was 14 years old he opened that door and there was a tent in the
[03:02:06.560 --> 03:02:12.320]  middle of the room surrounded by tanks and it was called an ozone tent and ozone i guess
[03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:17.120]  cleans out any impurity in your body so one day we had to leave you know there's so many
[03:02:17.120 --> 03:02:21.600]  importance come over we got a bell so we took off which was unusual we were across the street and
[03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:27.040]  we were walking about eight big black dudes jumped out of a Lincoln went upstairs very well dressed
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:30.720]  and then they were there for about 20 minutes and they left and it turns out it was somebody
[03:02:30.720 --> 03:02:36.160]  for a famous basketball player looking for a cure but they said that the condo was too dirty and it
[03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:41.120]  was absolutely immaculate so i just want to say there is a cure out there it is available i was on
[03:02:41.120 --> 03:02:44.960]  skype when i had skype live i was speaking with people in multiple countries about it and they
[03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:51.520]  said it's been made it's available but america and europe so well there are a lot of i appreciate
[03:02:51.520 --> 03:02:55.440]  your call i want to be careful about cure because you can have a bunch of different things going on
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:02:59.760]  and then somebody doesn't get cured there are very effective treatments for everything it's kind of
[03:02:59.760 --> 03:03:07.520]  like raiders the lost ark at the end of the movie where you see the ark of the covenant being
[03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:12.560]  brought into a giant warehouse with thousands of other boxes and that's basically an analogy or a
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:18.320]  parable of all the suppressed stuff the globalists end up using for themselves and there's a lot of
[03:03:18.320 --> 03:03:22.320]  evidence that some of them are staging their deaths now before they're given life extension
[03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:28.800]  technologies uh so i mean we're living in you know 2012 folks cliff in canada you're on the year
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:34.320]  welcome greetings alex my brother i've been following you long before you had an actually
[03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:39.440]  syndicated talk show and now i notice that you in prison planet new for wars dot com is being
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:44.560]  quoted by major media around the world we've all known that everything you've talked about it's real
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:50.800]  it's been happening for a long time now we have confirmation and thankfully the level of consciousness
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:56.560]  is exploding i'm energized by the fact that since last november directly attributable to you
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:04:02.240]  you people are finally waking up well i mean i think it's you the listeners in fact that
[03:04:02.240 --> 03:04:07.200]  things have gotten so out in the open and so crazy and people you know that there's a racial
[03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:12.560]  instinct in humanity across you know quote uh you know racial lines and really the human race
[03:04:13.360 --> 03:04:18.000]  that realizes we're all in danger and that that will get people out of their stupor you know the
[03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:24.880]  new world order isn't all powerful true things are things you're getting crazy though up here
[03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:29.920]  in british columbia the medical establishments now mandated that nurses who don't take their
[03:04:29.920 --> 03:04:35.360]  vaccinations not only have to wear a mask when they're dealing with the public but they also
[03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:40.800]  have to wear a special little badge kind of like a star of david on their forehead oh yeah and they
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:45.360]  want to take dozens of vaccines this is the new tyranny we're under national security you're not
[03:04:45.360 --> 03:04:50.480]  going to have a job if you don't take all the shots and if they put you on a list you just disappear
[03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:55.280]  again it's all just but but instead of being afraid of this we've got to call them out for
[03:04:55.280 --> 03:05:22.640]  what they are this is the real civil rights movement against the new world order
