[01:45.400 --> 01:52.640]  headlines like 10,000 websites shut down 84,000 websites shut down it's every
[01:52.640 --> 01:57.520]  few days now they just put these messages up where your website used to be
[01:57.520 --> 02:07.920]  but with 84,000 websites that were on a giant server platform system where
[02:07.920 --> 02:11.800]  their domain names were registered and where they were also serving their
[02:11.800 --> 02:17.800]  websites from this was lawn mowing companies pool companies eBay sellers
[02:17.800 --> 02:22.320]  I mean the list went on and on and it put up a message saying this site's been
[02:22.320 --> 02:29.040]  taken down for child porn no judge no jury no conviction and it turns out it's
[02:29.040 --> 02:33.240]  a mistake but the feds are still keeping their websites so they're beta
[02:33.240 --> 02:39.600]  testing the internet kill switch right now and you talk about lawsuits but the
[02:39.600 --> 02:43.000]  feds don't care they control the courts and even if they lose they'll just use
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.720]  taxpayer money to pay that off there's the headline US anti child pornography
[02:49.720 --> 02:56.800]  operation accidentally shuts down 84,000 websites and put the message on the
[02:56.800 --> 03:02.400]  front page imagine you've got a pool cleaning company you've got a car
[03:02.400 --> 03:07.520]  dealership I mean it happened to there's a list of them it's incredible you've

[03:12.200 --> 03:18.720]  got a site that sells you name it oil paintings it doesn't matter and your
[03:18.720 --> 03:23.720]  customers go there to look about an order they've made or to shop or to see if
[03:23.720 --> 03:30.760]  they want to call you to come mow their lawn and there's a message that you are
[03:30.760 --> 03:40.000]  a child pornographer oh I mean this is the ham-fisted tyranny of a mega
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.600]  government in your face so we're gonna be breaking all of that down as well
[03:46.600 --> 03:55.360]  today now remember earlier this week we covered the business insider report
[03:55.360 --> 04:00.720]  Wisconsin National Guard preps for worker unrest after governor unveils a
[04:00.720 --> 04:10.680]  emergency budget and now it is being likened to the situation in Egypt what
[04:10.680 --> 04:23.800]  is now unfolding in Wisconsin this is a beta test as well as the protest and
[04:23.800 --> 04:29.600]  demonstrations begin to unfold via austerity around the United States like
[04:29.600 --> 04:34.320]  we've seen in the Middle East and in Europe they're now beta testing the
[04:34.320 --> 04:39.160]  rollout of selling the public on having their benefits cut so I've got some
[04:39.160 --> 04:46.320]  details I want to go over on that front as well here today a lot of important

[08:26.600 --> 08:33.640]  civilization is being carried out in an orchestrated focused highly
[08:33.640 --> 08:39.880]  choreographed way but at the same time the resistance is mounting at a level
[08:39.880 --> 08:44.200]  that the globalist in their own white papers admit they did not expect so the
[08:44.200 --> 08:50.840]  battle is joined thank you for joining us it is the 17th day of February 2011
[08:50.840 --> 08:56.640]  on this live Thursday edition Catherine Austin Fitz former high-level government
[08:56.640 --> 09:00.520]  official in HUD will be joining us to get into the economy the continued
[09:00.520 --> 09:05.200]  implosion in the housing market and her forecast joining us in the last hour
[09:05.200 --> 09:10.600]  former high-level CIA analyst was beaten up for simply standing up and turning
[09:10.600 --> 09:14.400]  us back to Hillary Clinton you don't do that to a god and we're working on
[09:14.400 --> 09:18.040]  getting him to pop in on the show McGovern bloodied and arrested at
[09:18.040 --> 09:22.440]  Clinton's speech as we're working on getting him to pop in during the
[09:22.440 --> 09:28.600]  broadcast today looking at economic news downgrades loom for US states and that
[09:28.600 --> 09:33.120]  means that the borrowing prices just like third-world countries have high
[09:33.120 --> 09:39.000]  borrowing rates when they borrow fiat currency from the bankers so now the
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.920]  states we think they're already bankrupt just wait as they are downgraded
[09:43.920 --> 09:47.160]  we're going to be breaking that down and just wait till the US is fully
[09:47.160 --> 09:52.440]  downgraded worldwide who gen tal the g20 and others are helping downgrade the
[09:52.440 --> 09:58.040]  psychology and support of the dollar right now ahead of its actual death as
[09:58.040 --> 10:02.720]  the World Reserve currency that if folks think the economy is bad off now you
[10:02.720 --> 10:06.760]  ain't seen nothing yet if the treason is treacherous globalist running our
[10:06.760 --> 10:12.560]  nation are able to basically complete their operation also Bloomberg
[10:12.560 --> 10:19.200]  reporting consumer prices in US climb more than forecast on food and fuel gold
[10:19.200 --> 10:24.520]  is also exploding and again that all orbits the fact of the dollar is is
[10:24.520 --> 10:31.360]  devaluing England did have a 3.8% inflation rate now this year it's set
[10:31.360 --> 10:38.560]  to be 4% and expanding not per month that's per year I misread that a few
[10:38.560 --> 10:41.680]  days ago on the shows that's a correction right there but the issue is
[10:41.680 --> 10:48.680]  is it's stagflation the England has a much lower growth rate what is it about
[10:48.680 --> 10:54.000]  2% versus the 4% inflation so that is stagflation that we haven't seen
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  since the 1970s and that's a bellwether of what's going to happen here in the
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.480]  United States and remember it's always worse than what we're even hearing
[11:01.480 --> 11:06.040]  because governments are on record cooking the numbers when it comes to what
[11:06.040 --> 11:12.800]  real inflation and unemployment numbers are so continuing consumer prices in
[11:12.800 --> 11:18.600]  US climb more than forecast Fed official split on stimulus disappointed on
[11:18.600 --> 11:22.920]  growth we're going to be going over that in more detail with Catherine Austin
[11:22.920 --> 11:27.400]  Fitz coming up today obviously we're going to give you the latest
[11:27.400 --> 11:32.720]  developments here in just a few minutes on protest spreading in Bahrain at least
[11:32.720 --> 11:39.920]  two dead in crackdown also ABC's Miguel Marquez it was been roughed up death
[11:39.920 --> 11:45.280]  reports vary and the reporting that the ABC reporter got hit with a billy club
[11:45.280 --> 11:50.960]  and had his camera taken of course reportedly one of the other big CBS
[11:50.960 --> 11:55.400]  reporters they didn't tell us until yesterday but reportedly last Friday in
[11:55.400 --> 12:01.560]  Cairo was raped by 200 men the problem is if anybody's a globalist operative
[12:01.560 --> 12:05.840]  it's that poor woman and so they said that Anderson Cooper got beaten up
[12:05.840 --> 12:09.800]  severely got slapped on the back of the head a few times show are they saying
[12:09.800 --> 12:15.560]  200 men grabbed on her that of course is terrible or did 200 men actually rape her
[12:15.560 --> 12:20.600]  that would take quite a bit of time for 200 men to rape her let's say one minute
[12:20.600 --> 12:26.440]  per man 200 minutes I don't believe it I'm just going to put it to you that way
[12:26.440 --> 12:31.240]  I think it's another quasi hoax you probably did get beaten up may have
[12:31.240 --> 12:35.240]  even been raped and the media just goes with the 200 number and if you don't
[12:35.240 --> 12:39.640]  think the media won't run hoaxes remember it it broke yesterday at info
[12:39.640 --> 12:44.480]  wars.com and prison planet.com it did become the number one Google search
[12:44.480 --> 12:48.480]  term and this probably hit bigger than any other Google search bomb we've ever
[12:48.480 --> 12:56.080]  launched. Conservatively over a hundred major publications picked up the story
[12:56.080 --> 13:04.920]  of Fox News dirty tricks against Ron Paul and the search term of course was
[13:04.920 --> 13:09.920]  Fox News caught and even major newspapers went with our headline didn't
[13:09.920 --> 13:14.640]  give us any credit but that's fine I don't care if you just join us and don't
[13:14.640 --> 13:20.400]  know what happened they got Ron Paul on several days after CPAC poll was
[13:20.400 --> 13:27.520]  announced that he was the winner on Friday they got him on Tuesday and they
[13:27.520 --> 13:32.400]  said to Ron Paul hey watch this clip and they played a clip of him being declared
[13:32.400 --> 13:39.160]  the winner at CPAC and said look you got booed what do you think of that and it
[13:39.160 --> 13:44.080]  turns out it was last year's CPAC that itself was staged on record we wrote
[13:44.080 --> 13:48.480]  about it they only let Mitt Romney supporters in to the hall and then put
[13:48.480 --> 13:52.080]  a microphone in the crowd with them so they could boo when Ron Paul was
[13:52.080 --> 13:58.360]  announced the winner and so that was a staged event last year this year they
[13:58.360 --> 14:03.480]  just replayed over and over again on Fox over the weekend and then again this
[14:03.480 --> 14:10.320]  week on multiple shows including a show that he was on Mr. Hammer the anchor of
[14:10.320 --> 14:13.960]  that hour and said well you got booed this week what do you think of that and
[14:13.960 --> 14:17.920]  Ron Paul said well some people still don't like liberty well turns out that
[14:17.920 --> 14:24.520]  was all fake and a re-airing of last year's video so Fox News dirty trick
[14:24.520 --> 14:31.160]  against Ron Paul is no mistake that's the latest article out by Paul Joseph
[14:31.160 --> 14:34.680]  Watson at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com and it goes over all the
[14:34.680 --> 14:40.840]  details in a statement Fox senior vice president of news Michael Clement
[14:40.840 --> 14:43.440]  attempted to defuse the growing controversy over the incident by
[14:43.440 --> 14:47.440]  claiming it was all a harmless broadcasting error that we've now
[14:47.440 --> 14:50.640]  confirmed they aired over and over again we made a mistake with some of the
[14:50.640 --> 14:54.400]  video we aired and plan on issuing a correction on America's newsroom tomorrow
[14:54.400 --> 14:58.440]  morning explaining exactly what happened I don't know they issued that really is
[14:58.440 --> 15:01.880]  it plausible this was just another mistake how about the myriad of other
[15:01.880 --> 15:08.120]  mistakes Fox News makes a habit of committing mistakes that coincidentally
[15:08.120 --> 15:12.880]  all serve to disparage congressman Ron Paul's message of liberty freedom along
[15:12.880 --> 15:16.360]  with his chances of becoming president I don't know if I'm going to air this
[15:16.360 --> 15:20.760]  today because it's 10 minutes long but in this article we have a video posted of
[15:20.760 --> 15:25.840]  a compilation of dirty tricks against Ron Paul and you'll notice that most of
[15:25.840 --> 15:31.600]  the clips are from Fox News because CNN and MSNBC they know most mainline
[15:31.600 --> 15:35.120]  Democrats aren't going to vote for Paul they were gonna go down hook line and
[15:35.120 --> 15:38.920]  sinker with the ship with Obama they love getting caught they know a lot of
[15:38.920 --> 15:42.640]  libertarians and real conservatives want to vote for Ron Paul so they create
[15:42.640 --> 15:47.400]  the self-fulfilling prophecy that he can't win though he's now winning
[15:47.400 --> 15:51.080]  scientific Gallup polls in first or second place depending on which one you
[15:51.080 --> 15:57.480]  look at even though he's won the coveted CPAC poll now two years in a row I
[15:57.480 --> 16:01.760]  mean before Ron Paul won last year and now this year the media said my gosh if
[16:01.760 --> 16:04.840]  you win this you're gonna win the presidency like Ronald Reagan did in
[16:04.840 --> 16:12.440]  79 but now it's this self-fulfilling Jedi mind trick of you didn't hear that it
[16:12.440 --> 16:18.080]  doesn't matter he's being booed you're not for Ron Paul now we shouldn't put all
[16:18.080 --> 16:24.120]  our eggs in one basket for Ron Paul we should support him 110% but also we
[16:24.120 --> 16:28.840]  need to run good candidates and this is happening all over the country on a true
[16:28.840 --> 16:33.320]  patriot platform against the globalist against the Federal Reserve against that
[16:33.320 --> 16:39.000]  unbeatable ticket of ideas at city council county commissioner state
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.560]  legislature that's where the real fight is is in every town and city and state
[16:44.560 --> 16:50.840]  that we live in that's where the fight is so another example of media
[16:50.840 --> 16:56.720]  manipulation there on that front again later in the hour I'm gonna get into
[16:56.720 --> 17:00.800]  Bahrain protests at least two dead and cracked down army locks down Bahrain
[17:00.800 --> 17:04.840]  police storm protests they're having protests some of them violent men
[17:04.840 --> 17:10.280]  Jordan Saudi Arabia Yemen I mean just basically everywhere Libya braces for
[17:10.280 --> 17:15.680]  day of anger is ongoing demonstrations happen there in sharp reversal US agrees
[17:15.680 --> 17:22.280]  to rebuke Israel in Security Council but then you actually read the article and
[17:22.280 --> 17:25.600]  it says well so that there's not a full rebuke of Israel in the Security
[17:25.600 --> 17:30.240]  Council they're gonna do a partial one but now that was withdrawn when the
[17:30.240 --> 17:34.000]  Palestinians didn't agree to it Hezbollah threatens Israelis anytime
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.120]  anywhere we're gonna be going over that Pakistani court delays case of detained
[17:38.120 --> 17:44.960]  American another report here out of wine at news US clueless about Egypt farse of

[24:14.200 --> 24:19.600]  overdrive we are here back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. Ray McGovern who was brutalized
[24:19.600 --> 24:24.920]  and arrested for simply turning his back to Lord Hillary Clinton will be
[24:24.920 --> 24:29.760]  joining us coming up the next segment so I'm gonna kind of bifurcate this
[24:29.760 --> 24:33.640]  incredible internet news and kind of cover some of it now but then get back
[24:33.640 --> 24:38.240]  into more detail later in the hour and into the second hour then we'll open
[24:38.240 --> 24:43.960]  the phones up coming up in the second hour but it's really very simple the
[24:43.960 --> 24:48.880]  internet was designed and built by DARPA and by the federal government it was
[24:48.880 --> 24:52.680]  rolled out it's been the only growth sector in our economy in the last 15
[24:52.680 --> 24:57.960]  years the only thing that's really allowed our economy to continue and now
[24:57.960 --> 25:02.840]  under the cyber security act it openly vertically integrates and forces the
[25:02.840 --> 25:09.080]  smaller companies to all be merged into a handful of mega corporations and this
[25:09.080 --> 25:14.360]  for more than a decade has been the plan of a consortium of government industry
[25:14.360 --> 25:19.080]  and academic institutions known as internet to how do we know all of this
[25:19.080 --> 25:22.920]  was coming because they lay out blueprints and give all the great
[25:22.920 --> 25:27.960]  reasons for it but you can see what they're really doing and they want taxes
[25:27.960 --> 25:32.840]  on the web they want surveillance on the web internet ids on the web the
[25:32.840 --> 25:35.560]  federal government has announced they want to just be able to shut off your
[25:35.560 --> 25:40.880]  website or even remotely destroy your computer that's what John McCain's been
[25:40.880 --> 25:45.640]  pushing for years without a judge without a jury without anything now what's
[25:45.640 --> 25:51.600]  happening is Homeland Security and the Justice Department do go to a court but
[25:51.600 --> 25:54.680]  it's kind of like FISA where a judge signs one and then they can do a million
[25:54.680 --> 26:02.760]  plus wiretaps with one one order it's not a real warrant it's not a real
[26:02.760 --> 26:07.840]  seizure order and the same thing is now happening every day or two I see big
[26:07.840 --> 26:13.480]  articles in CNET news I see articles in Wired we write articles about it where
[26:13.480 --> 26:20.200]  now if a site even links to torrents where people are streaming or sharing
[26:20.200 --> 26:24.320]  sporting events you just put a link up there they just shut your website down
[26:24.320 --> 26:31.800]  and there's no recourse that's just it they just take over the DNS number and
[26:31.800 --> 26:35.480]  put a government Homeland Security message up there and in fact I'll put
[26:35.480 --> 26:39.440]  one of those articles on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers so you can see
[26:39.440 --> 26:43.880]  what these orders look like but Curt Nemo wrote an excellent article on this
[26:43.880 --> 26:51.040]  yesterday dealing with it kill switch beta government blocks 84,000 websites
[26:51.040 --> 26:57.200]  and if you scroll down on the article you can see what the Homeland Security
[26:57.200 --> 27:01.840]  orders actually look like actually Curt didn't put one of the orders in his
[27:01.840 --> 27:06.160]  article so we'll go over to the Gizmodo article the other one you had up earlier
[27:06.160 --> 27:10.000]  and show folks what the order looks like kill switch beta government blocks
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.560]  84,000 websites under the banner of fighting child pornography the
[27:15.560 --> 27:20.200]  Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice knocked out 84,000
[27:20.200 --> 27:24.960]  websites last week the websites did not host or link to child pornography as the
[27:24.960 --> 27:28.880]  government claims as part of operations save our children
[27:28.880 --> 27:34.800]  ISIS cyber security crime center has again seized several domain names but
[27:34.800 --> 27:39.640]  not without making a huge error last Friday thousands of site operators were
[27:39.640 --> 27:44.640]  surprised by a rather worrying banner that was placed on their domain reports
[27:44.640 --> 27:50.160]  torrent freak a tech site and it said advertisement distribution
[27:50.160 --> 27:54.400]  transportation receipt and possession of child pornography constitute federal
[27:54.400 --> 27:59.520]  crimes that carry penalties for first-time offenders of up to 30 years in
[27:59.520 --> 28:05.280]  federal prison a $250,000 fine forfeiture and restitution was the message
[28:05.280 --> 28:09.320]  visitors to the sites were greeted with after a judge signed a seizure warrant
[28:09.320 --> 28:15.280]  and big sis contacted the domain registers and instructed them to point
[28:15.280 --> 28:21.080]  the domains in question to a server that hosts the above warning issue message
[28:21.080 --> 28:31.280]  and there it is on screen now imagine 84,000 plus websites car dealerships dog
[28:31.280 --> 28:38.600]  grooming places lawn mower outfits you name it we're we're on these server
[28:38.600 --> 28:44.200]  systems and your customers go to your website and they see a homeland security
[28:44.200 --> 28:49.480]  seal saying this website's got child porn on it and when you read deeper into
[28:49.480 --> 28:53.440]  the admissions there was no porn period on any of the sites the feds just do
[28:53.440 --> 28:58.960]  whatever they want and all the globalists have to do they want to take
[28:58.960 --> 29:02.840]  your site down whether it was Facebook you know it's not going to happen to
[29:02.840 --> 29:07.000]  them or MySpace or whatever the case is they go post an image even if it's not
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.280]  child porn claim it is follow the report boom your website's gone and the
[29:12.280 --> 29:19.120]  message is put up that you are a child pornographer this is the beta test for
[29:19.120 --> 29:24.040]  the complete and total takeover of the Internet and after Ray McGovern leaves
[29:24.040 --> 29:29.440]  us I'm going to get more into this so anybody that doubts that they can do
[29:29.440 --> 29:33.960]  this that's what the Obama kill switch is he says in cybersecurity act oh if
[29:33.960 --> 29:37.680]  there's a flu problem or a terror threat or an economic threat we'll just shut
[29:37.680 --> 29:45.600]  off all websites or selective sites and point people at our messages and so

[35:33.240 --> 35:39.720]  somebody like Hitler with a war criminal and we left but and you talked
[35:39.720 --> 35:43.360]  about how and many times you can you've confronted these people you've
[35:43.360 --> 35:48.000]  confronted rumsfeld and about the lies about WMD's then he lied again and said
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.960]  he didn't and then you quoted him and that was one of the more devastating
[35:51.960 --> 35:56.760]  exposays ever done on live TV but now they're really getting rough with the
[35:56.760 --> 36:01.760]  almost like this is East Germany or something right yeah actually these
[36:01.760 --> 36:09.720]  Germans were much more gentle I'm linking my wounds here Alex but thankfully the
[36:09.720 --> 36:16.120]  x-rays have come back and there were no bones broken a lot of blood and just
[36:16.120 --> 36:24.400]  sort of outrage just doesn't do it I was standing not saying a word sure my
[36:24.400 --> 36:29.080]  back back was to the secretary the only thing she could see was veterans for
[36:29.080 --> 36:34.520]  peace.org if she could read that small lettering I'm in front of my
[36:34.520 --> 36:40.600]  shirt of course I had veterans for peace and I just was trying to to show the
[36:40.600 --> 36:46.800]  people there at DW and Hillary Clinton that not everyone agrees with the
[36:46.800 --> 36:54.160]  quixotic and immoral policies that she is a prime mover for she's never known a
[36:54.160 --> 37:00.280]  war that she didn't love and she keeps threatening Iran for no specific reason
[37:00.280 --> 37:07.200]  other than her devotion her very sincere and very close devotion to the
[37:07.200 --> 37:13.440]  interest of Israel so there is a person that is a bad influence on the whole
[37:13.440 --> 37:18.880]  world and I it troubled me deeply to see everybody applauding so so generously
[37:18.880 --> 37:23.720]  and sitting down so respectfully I was not about to do that so I stood
[37:23.720 --> 37:29.000]  turned my back and and you know I was focused just on the back of the room and
[37:29.000 --> 37:37.000]  had completely blindsided when this the early you know 250-pound guy in a in a
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.960]  suit you know this grabs me from the side crawling over four women who were
[37:42.960 --> 37:49.880]  to my left but the next thing I know I'm in the aisle and we just I didn't know
[37:49.880 --> 37:59.360]  who he was I was such in such shock that I I forgot the the drill in in the code
[37:59.360 --> 38:03.560]  pink manual which says as soon as they do that to you you scream what you want
[38:03.560 --> 38:07.920]  to scream and you let the whole world know what you're standing for I didn't
[38:07.920 --> 38:12.240]  even do that I was so shocked until I get toward the back and then I said so
[38:12.240 --> 38:17.480]  this is America huh this is America and then it struck me I didn't know who
[38:17.480 --> 38:21.120]  these guys were and they said well who are you and of course they never got an
[38:21.120 --> 38:27.560]  answer to that so pretty grievous so basically private goons or secret
[38:27.560 --> 38:33.000]  police we don't know tackle you bloody you all over your body photos are up at
[38:33.000 --> 38:38.760]  info wars.com prisonplanet.com also partnership for civil justice that
[38:38.760 --> 38:44.840]  originally took and posted the photos free speech is so deadly dangerous even
[38:44.840 --> 38:49.040]  at George Washington University that if somebody quietly stands up and turns
[38:49.040 --> 38:54.800]  their back they've got to be punished obviously this was an assault on you Ray
[38:54.800 --> 38:59.320]  breaking this down walk through for those that are listening on the radio
[38:59.320 --> 39:04.640]  again where you were the atmosphere what happened and what they did to you once
[39:04.640 --> 39:10.880]  they had manhandled you and tackled you and drug you out. Yeah well the scene was
[39:10.880 --> 39:18.200]  George Washington University an auditorium there the the indigenous so
[39:18.200 --> 39:25.240]  speak the people who were invited were incredibly respectful to respectful to
[39:25.240 --> 39:32.200]  my life of the secretary and I stood there for the first couple minutes and
[39:32.200 --> 39:38.760]  what happens to me I just explained I was dragged out and then you know they
[39:38.760 --> 39:43.280]  put two sets of handcuffs on me you know the metal kind that bites into your
[39:43.280 --> 39:49.960]  skin there's blood all over the back of my pants my blood and I you know was
[39:49.960 --> 39:55.920]  bleeding profusely so I said hey you got some gloves and they put me in the EMT
[39:55.920 --> 40:00.440]  thing that rolled up and took my vitals and the next thing I know I'm
[40:00.440 --> 40:06.760]  discharged and I'm discharged but given over to the DC police on George's of
[40:06.760 --> 40:11.800]  what do they call it conduct disorderly conduct and I'm taking up to the
[40:11.800 --> 40:16.800]  precinct there and putting this little this little cell of the size that the
[40:16.800 --> 40:23.000]  Bradley Mending occupies you know about ten feet by oh my maybe four feet and
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.400]  but the next three and a half hours there went out in the evening and he said
[40:28.400 --> 40:33.160]  go home you're on you know you gotta go to go to court on this you disorderly
[40:33.160 --> 40:38.440]  conduct guy and I went to the hospital and in my neighborhood they dressed my
[40:38.440 --> 40:45.200]  wounds and that's the x-rays and as far as I know there no no fractures and I'm
[40:45.200 --> 40:51.160]  just you know the bruised and battered but I tell you if if Americans don't
[40:51.160 --> 40:55.560]  stand up for this kind of treatment and then I'm gonna be standing standing up
[40:55.560 --> 41:01.560]  anytime soon for anything well in in my own experience when George W. Bush had
[41:01.560 --> 41:05.640]  me arrested at a press conference for politely asking a question and if folks
[41:05.640 --> 41:09.320]  want to see it just search Alex Jones arrested for asking George W. Bush a
[41:09.320 --> 41:14.400]  question they twisted my arms so far behind my back once I got outside I
[41:14.400 --> 41:19.520]  wasn't resisting it's all on video that I still have a torn rotator cuff but I
[41:19.520 --> 41:25.240]  don't like surgery so I've never fixed it then in New York I was arrested for
[41:25.240 --> 41:30.880]  demonstrating peacefully and they grunted when they put the handcuffs on with
[41:30.880 --> 41:35.520]  and of course it cut my hand with every bit of force and this is really a form
[41:35.520 --> 41:40.240]  of torture and a form of recrimination and so they bloody you you've got cuts
[41:40.240 --> 41:45.480]  all over you bruises all over you cuts from the handcuffs they jump on you and
[41:45.480 --> 41:50.400]  then you're the one that's disorderly you know instead of just leading you out
[41:50.400 --> 41:55.080]  they escalate the situation I hope that you engage in some type of counterclaim
[41:55.080 --> 42:00.200]  or a four-year request did the police get the names of the people that tackled
[42:00.200 --> 42:10.040]  him well the the big good brutal guy and he was the guy that hurt me most is as
[42:10.040 --> 42:18.200]  yet unknown to us but this you can see his photo there as he drags me out so I'm
[42:18.200 --> 42:23.360]  told that there will be won't be too hard to find out who he is and who told
[42:23.360 --> 42:27.920]  him to do what he did that would be my interest find out whose orders he was
[42:27.920 --> 42:31.520]  probably State Department security service I'll tell you a story I was at
[42:31.520 --> 42:37.000]  Bilderberg 2008 Obama and Hillary there for their secret meeting the press didn't
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.160]  know where they were for over the day when they disappeared we we knew we saw
[42:40.160 --> 42:45.120]  him go in and the day before that I'm at the nearby hotel to cover Bilderberg
[42:45.120 --> 42:48.760]  and we're there at the bar eating hamburgers and you know someone's drinking
[42:48.760 --> 42:53.480]  beer and these big burly guys come in and start asking if we want to engage in
[42:53.480 --> 42:56.720]  terrorism with them or if we want to attack the State Department with them
[42:56.720 --> 43:00.120]  they know how to get in and then later I did identify and see them at the
[43:00.120 --> 43:03.920]  Bilderberg meeting once it was shut down they were State Department security
[43:03.920 --> 43:08.640]  services and US Marine Corps isn't that a violation of posse common taught us
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.160]  right to have the federal secret police running around trying to provocateur
[43:13.160 --> 43:18.720]  well if they're active duty military yes but you know the broader question
[43:18.720 --> 43:25.580]  Alex is that so it's illegal so so what's your problem I mean we do we do
[43:25.580 --> 43:29.720]  lots of illegal illegal things now for the last decade and we're in this over
[43:29.720 --> 43:34.440]  many so power the world is better watch out because what happened to Alex so what
[43:34.440 --> 43:39.560]  happened to Ray could easily happen to you that's the message let me ask you
[43:39.560 --> 43:46.240]  this Ray Aaron Dykes a year ago went to UT an open event with thousands with
[43:46.240 --> 43:50.000]  Carl Rove and they only took written questions so during the questions he
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.920]  stood up and you know said what about the Downing Street memo the White House
[43:53.920 --> 43:58.480]  memo what about the fact that you guys lied about WMD's and he didn't resist
[43:58.480 --> 44:03.160]  they took him out and charged him I mean so I guess in America now if you ask a
[44:03.160 --> 44:07.480]  question you get beat up or charged or both I mean is that a free society
[44:07.480 --> 44:15.800]  Ray well it's working on that you know Alex I can't avoid the opportunity to
[44:15.800 --> 44:22.160]  just read a couple of sentences from Hillary Clinton's speech it was three
[44:22.160 --> 44:29.600]  paragraphs after she watched me watch me be a brutalized by by those goons and
[44:29.600 --> 44:37.520]  she shows complete sensitivity to using violence against protesters this is
[44:37.520 --> 44:45.640]  what she said what happened is once again using violence against protesters who
[44:45.640 --> 44:53.560]  are seeking basic freedoms now she's talking about he's talking about Iran
[44:53.560 --> 45:00.960]  okay and she says you know what they do is they stood and they marched you know
[45:00.960 --> 45:05.200]  she's reading this thing it completely seems to be or at least pretend to be
[45:05.200 --> 45:11.120]  completely oblivious what just happened before progress before the woman is a
[45:11.120 --> 45:16.000]  menace I mean you know whatever she learned in Yale Law School where she
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.560]  shares the laurels with her husband and with the likes of John you I mean it
[45:20.560 --> 45:25.560]  wasn't justice it may have been some laws or something but even those laws
[45:25.560 --> 45:32.800]  that are sort of applicable only if this privileged class of dignitaries says
[45:32.800 --> 45:38.120]  they're applicable you know I do a little aside here I was reading at
[45:38.120 --> 45:43.680]  tables two months ago from Tunisia and there's one from the ambassador talking
[45:43.680 --> 45:49.280]  about this this splendid palace that he was treated to dinner at and it was
[45:49.280 --> 45:54.200]  just really over the top they had frozen custard flown in from alchuria and
[45:54.200 --> 46:00.640]  they had a tiger in a cage just like Sam Hussein's son used to have and and he
[46:00.640 --> 46:05.960]  reports this and then at the end he says you know the people the people are
[46:05.960 --> 46:10.760]  suffering and they don't have enough to eat okay now reverse that and have
[46:10.760 --> 46:17.080]  somebody from Egypt or Algeria or Tunisia reporting from from Washington
[46:17.080 --> 46:23.280]  and having attended the wedding of Hillary Rodden Clinton's daughter okay
[46:23.280 --> 46:28.320]  in which over a million dollars was invested in the same thing you know
[46:28.320 --> 46:33.240]  Americans can't find a job and you've got one of the sons of the banksters that
[46:33.240 --> 46:38.160]  are robbing us that she's marrying yeah it's a big part of these weddings and so
[46:38.160 --> 46:42.400]  forth so you know it's just a matter of time I think
[46:42.400 --> 46:47.880]  Norm Chomsky was on Amy Goodman this morning and I think he's got it right
[46:47.880 --> 46:55.080]  but they'll do this to us as long as we sit back and say oh well you're not
[46:55.080 --> 47:00.840]  good to me those are those upstarts like like whatever you know like other
[47:00.840 --> 47:04.840]  people well right we're almost gone absolutely we're almost out of time with
[47:04.840 --> 47:08.280]  you I want to commend you for what you've done and others should obviously
[47:08.280 --> 47:12.440]  following your example if they have the courage and understand how how high the
[47:12.440 --> 47:16.120]  stakes are if we don't start saying no to this open corruption but not just
[47:16.120 --> 47:20.920]  after they drug you out right before they drag you out and we're playing the
[47:20.920 --> 47:24.840]  clip earlier she's talking about the Egyptians standing up getting involved
[47:24.840 --> 47:29.640]  the internet and and and then how horrible Mubarak was to cut the internet
[47:29.640 --> 47:35.880]  off but then meanwhile it's all over our news the feds just shut down 84,000
[47:35.880 --> 47:39.280]  innocent websites this week they're openly calling for an internet kill
[47:39.280 --> 47:42.720]  switch they're openly saying the government needs to be able to redirect
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.000]  the entire internet or part of it to their messages if they see fit I mean
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.160]  we see a real move by the old line corrupt corporate media and government
[47:52.160 --> 47:57.080]  circling the wagons against the American people because they know the type of
[47:57.080 --> 48:03.440]  flare-ups we see in in Egypt and Mexico and now in Wisconsin are coming to every
[48:03.440 --> 48:07.720]  city and town in America what's your take on the internet kill switch and the
[48:07.720 --> 48:13.800]  trial balloons being sent up to sell us on getting rid of the free web and the
[48:13.800 --> 48:17.960]  Pentagon saying that we're about to be hit by internet terrorists and that we
[48:17.960 --> 48:21.600]  need to get rid of internet freedom because of the Stuxnet when it's
[48:21.600 --> 48:25.640]  admitted that Israel and the US launched the Stuxnet they've got a lot of bravada
[48:25.640 --> 48:29.900]  to launch the attack admit tacitly they did it and then call for the end of the
[48:29.900 --> 48:33.480]  internet freedom because of their own attacks are you worried about a false
[48:33.480 --> 48:39.760]  flag on the web well you know I'm not technically proficient enough to be
[48:39.760 --> 48:44.040]  intelligently worried but when I look at all the other things that are going
[48:44.040 --> 48:51.760]  on and when I know things that not many Americans know the Pentagon guy who runs
[48:51.760 --> 48:57.640]  all this stuff his name is Keith Alexander and he was head of NSA and
[48:57.640 --> 49:08.600]  still is and now he heads up this this cyberspace cyber war new agency now why
[49:08.600 --> 49:12.520]  do I single him out because he lied through his teeth when a congressional
[49:12.520 --> 49:17.160]  member member of the House Intelligence Committee went out to see him and asked
[49:17.160 --> 49:20.560]  him whether they were snooping whether they were eavesdropping on Americans he
[49:20.560 --> 49:25.800]  said oh no we would never we would never do that too bad for him but the New
[49:25.800 --> 49:30.040]  York Times had already told the White House that James Risen's book was
[49:30.040 --> 49:35.560]  coming out with chapter and verse about this activity so he lied to Congress
[49:35.560 --> 49:40.680]  that should that's a felony okay now the congressman in question I called them
[49:40.680 --> 49:44.200]  on the corporate and said look you're never gonna get another promotion and
[49:44.200 --> 49:49.960]  guess what he gets another promotion and another agency you've got a bunch of
[49:49.960 --> 49:54.760]  very corrupt people there and they'll do whatever the likes of Hillary Clinton
[49:54.760 --> 50:00.640]  and I'm sad to say Barack Obama tell them to do well Ray I know you're
[50:00.640 --> 50:04.560]  extremely busy today we're going to break and if you can't do it that's fine
[50:04.560 --> 50:09.240]  but I'd like to come back and do five brief minutes with you on Iran saying
[50:09.240 --> 50:15.440]  they're sending ships to the med and on just a snapshot since we talked to you
[50:15.440 --> 50:18.520]  last week on your take on what's happening in the Middle East can you do
[50:18.520 --> 50:22.840]  that yeah I can do that okay we only got 45 seconds before the break tell us
[50:22.840 --> 50:31.640]  about consortium news well I'm very proud to have found a run by an
[50:31.640 --> 50:37.280]  investigative reporter I think is probably among the five best in the
[50:37.280 --> 50:44.680]  country his name is Robert Perry has a guts to quit his profession as a writer
[50:44.680 --> 50:51.200]  and analyst for AP for newsweek for frontline because they wouldn't let them
[50:51.200 --> 50:57.880]  up his own website 1995 on the other side it's consortium news.com where
[50:57.880 --> 51:02.200]  with them fall wars.com stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good
[51:02.200 --> 51:06.200]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[51:06.200 --> 51:10.000]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.360]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[51:14.360 --> 51:18.720]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[51:18.720 --> 51:23.160]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[51:23.160 --> 51:27.920]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[51:27.920 --> 51:31.720]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[51:31.720 --> 51:35.360]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[51:35.360 --> 51:39.680]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[51:39.680 --> 51:42.840]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[51:42.840 --> 51:46.520]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[51:46.520 --> 51:51.280]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[51:51.280 --> 51:55.520]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[51:55.520 --> 52:03.160]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in
[52:03.160 --> 52:08.600]  2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years he
[52:08.600 --> 52:12.640]  says it will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest
[52:12.640 --> 52:15.880]  educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own
[52:15.880 --> 52:19.280]  family now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[52:19.280 --> 52:23.960]  the crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM
[52:23.960 --> 52:27.240]  Panny Mae Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth
[52:27.240 --> 52:32.120]  properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he
[52:32.120 --> 52:35.760]  created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and

[54:00.440 --> 54:06.080]  you look like an angel
[54:06.080 --> 54:10.640]  Ray McGovern former top CIA analyst Ronald Reagan George Herbert Walker Bush
[54:10.640 --> 54:16.480]  Vietnam veteran he is our guest for five more minutes Iran's state-run TV press
[54:16.480 --> 54:21.160]  TV has confirmed they are trying to get gunboats through the Suez Canal trying
[54:21.160 --> 54:26.720]  to get permission from Cairo right now Israel calls that a war provocation in
[54:26.720 --> 54:31.880]  the Jerusalem Post and AP and says they may respond with force so I guess
[54:31.880 --> 54:35.200]  everybody else is allowed to have warships the Mediterranean but I guess
[54:35.200 --> 54:39.000]  this is some type of blockade what do you make of that and other developments
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.120]  give us a quick snapshot on that ray of what's unfolding right now in North
[54:43.120 --> 54:49.060]  Africa in the Middle East well the short answer Alex is that there's a big
[54:49.060 --> 54:54.840]  loser a really big loser in what's happened over the last four weeks and
[54:54.840 --> 55:01.920]  that is Israel for the last 32 years they've had no reason to worry at all
[55:01.920 --> 55:07.120]  about their Western and their southern flank and that gave them free reign to
[55:07.120 --> 55:11.320]  do what they've done against Lebanon against Gaza against the West Bank
[55:11.320 --> 55:18.200]  Palestinians and so forth they can't depend on a secure southern Western
[55:18.200 --> 55:25.760]  border now because you know the situation is totally new in Egypt now
[55:25.760 --> 55:30.840]  everyone says they wanted democracy in Egypt even the Israelis say that but
[55:30.840 --> 55:34.840]  they don't really because you know what a democracy would mean the polls show
[55:34.840 --> 55:42.120]  that the Egyptians hate the Israelis why not because of their wanted democracy
[55:42.120 --> 55:48.320]  but because of their policies and so unless Israel changes its policies
[55:48.320 --> 55:53.040]  toward their Palestinian brothers and sisters the brothers and sisters of
[55:53.040 --> 55:57.960]  many of the Arabs in Egypt and their 80 million people there of course unless
[55:57.960 --> 56:03.960]  the policy changes they stand to countenance a neighbor to the south
[56:03.960 --> 56:08.840]  that has strong feelings about what they do to other Palestinians to the
[56:08.840 --> 56:13.480]  Palestinians in Gaza for example now how does that translate into your question
[56:13.480 --> 56:18.680]  well you know if the Israelis want to mount some sort of provocation to
[56:18.680 --> 56:23.840]  divert attention or just to show their muscle they could easily cause a crisis
[56:23.840 --> 56:30.400]  in the Suez Canal or nearby on you know on pretenses that these Iranians are
[56:30.400 --> 56:37.760]  actually causing a provocation you know I would hope that Obama would put a bug
[56:37.760 --> 56:43.000]  into Netanyahu's ears they look Benjamin we're not gonna come to your aid
[56:43.000 --> 56:48.760]  you can get involved in a war with Iran but I have no guarantee Alex that
[56:48.760 --> 56:55.520]  Obama has enough backbone to say or to do that and so the initiative once again
[56:55.520 --> 56:59.640]  is in the hands of those Israeli leaders and if they see it to their
[56:59.640 --> 57:03.280]  advantage to start up things in the Middle East they're gonna go ahead and do
[57:03.280 --> 57:09.280]  so with the full expectation that our Congress you know in the in the influence
[57:09.280 --> 57:14.120]  of the the Israel or with the liquid lobby is what I call it well you know
[57:14.120 --> 57:22.320]  we'll applaud and pass an approving measure by 420 to 10 or something like
[57:22.320 --> 57:27.680]  that so the situation is dicey and the reason is dicey is because Israel has
[57:27.680 --> 57:32.680]  lost the awful lot here and I don't know what they'll do to redress their
[57:32.680 --> 57:37.840]  position but I can't I can't visualize the Israelis sitting back at a
[57:37.840 --> 57:44.840]  it's coming really interesting to watch Wolf Blitzer on CNN and you see what's
[57:44.840 --> 57:50.680]  going on no no Suleiman you know that the torturer he was their man in Cairo
[57:50.680 --> 57:54.040]  he doesn't seem to be in the picture anymore but I don't know where he is
[57:54.040 --> 57:58.880]  maybe he's in short mouth shake and consulting with the other Israelis and
[57:58.880 --> 58:02.600]  never in other words they have plenty of influence there they have plenty of people
[58:02.600 --> 58:07.360]  upon home they can they can depend in Cairo and it's gonna be really
[58:07.360 --> 58:11.480]  interesting to see what they choose to do not not whether they choose to do
[58:11.480 --> 58:16.160]  something but what the Israelis choose to do in reaction to what's happened to
[58:16.160 --> 58:20.960]  them so definitely conflict the Middle East is moving towards the front burner
[58:20.960 --> 58:30.040]  I hope not but it looks like a court there's a degree of instability there now that did not exist just a short four or five weeks ago
[58:30.040 --> 58:34.800]  Ray we're out of time thank God you didn't have any bones broken go with God

[59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:12.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:19.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:30.400]  Alex Jones I was talking to a national magazine last night and they were
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:36.000]  asking me to give them examples for a big feature report about Glenbeck ripping
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.800]  off what we cover and what we do here and I made it clear to them because a lot
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.560]  of media a lot of big publications and national television is reported on it as
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:49.320]  well have noticed that Glenbeck's gone from kind of being a mainline Republican
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:54.200]  a rhino to more and more sounding just like this radio show and I know from
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.920]  inside sources he has a team of five people that randomly listen to the show
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.160]  and check what we cover and then go over it but I want to be clear I'm
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.640]  covering the truth and so I don't have an overall problem with the Glenbeck
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.280]  taking our research our information my understanding of things and presenting
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:17.840]  it except for the fact that he does twist it and he does you know not go to
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.240]  the top of the pyramid he kind of attacks low-level people but that's a
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.760]  big step in the right direction so people some people then say well why do
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:28.520]  you know once a week or so talk about Glenbeck well what am I supposed to do
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.680]  he's a major phenomenon probably reaching 30 million people a week he's seen as
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.840]  the leader of the Liberty Patriot movement he's not trustworthy and so
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:44.360]  we've got to discuss Glenbeck we have to I mean these people are watching and
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:49.960]  listening right now the and and and so here I am a guy on the air for 16 years
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:54.520]  and someone who's reaching millions of people a day don't have the reach of
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.800]  Glenbeck he's probably got four or five times the reach I do but we're growing
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.600]  exponentially the I've never sold out to the New World Order so they've just
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:09.360]  basically created someone who they think they control to doppelgang my work but
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:14.280]  it's not a hundred percent my work but but but I was thinking about examples of
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:20.440]  Glenbeck going with exactly what we've said and I was writing some notes on it
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:25.320]  just before I went live today the biggest one right now is is is last night
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.960]  Glenbeck said we've got a boycott Google where have you heard that because
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:35.760]  they're an NSA CIA front well that's a public fact now Glenbeck is who normally
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:41.000]  worships government the intelligence agencies did multiple segments last
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.160]  night NBC is covering it they're all attacking because he's right and he's
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:51.120]  admitting that this is a globalist overthrow of Egypt to destabilize them
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:56.880]  at least I mean there's an example who said boycott Google who's beaten the
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.320]  drum for at least six seven years at their CIA front there becks doing it
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.600]  again we challenged Beck to cover eugenics and poison in the water and
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:10.720]  George Bernard Shaw he doesn't know we've played the clips of Obama
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.120]  advisors saying they need a new Oklahoma City to be blamed on their
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.040]  political enemies and that it and that I warned it would be blamed on Glenbeck
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.720]  and yours truly because I've seen what media matters and others are basically
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.640]  preparing the ground for becks come out now and said the government may stage
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:35.360]  an attack and blame it on him I mean right down the line we've always talked
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.920]  about don't believe us check the documentation we've always done graphics
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:42.760]  and things dealing with puppets and how the globalist are above it and how the
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:52.280]  mega rich are controlling the grassroots against the middle class I mean no one
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:57.880]  can deny so obviously my destiny now to a great extent and becks destiny are
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:02.840]  intertwined so I'm surprised I don't talk more about Glenbeck he also does
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.280]  things like saying FEMA camps are real and then he comes out and says they
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:10.960]  aren't real so he also takes our issues and then tries to build strawmen and
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:18.760]  discredit them that's why I'm getting into this right now is because here is
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:25.600]  NBC Glenbeck urges Google boycott and they make jokes about him here this is
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:32.080]  not a joke and this is very serious and it shows an internal fissure a fight
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:38.440]  going on between different branches of the new world odor so I'm gonna go over
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.920]  what Glenbeck's up to with Google and then get into internet kill switch beta
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:50.480]  test government blocks 84,000 websites and then coming up at the 24 after they

[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.440]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:09.440]  ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.720]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for

[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:33.760]  freedom extremism socialism or communism the outcome will be dependent on who was
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:39.800]  the best organized in each country and they're organizing the students and the
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:45.640]  students are using the internet which brings me to google i want to talk to a
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.960]  little bit about google the google chief executive eric schmidt has said
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:55.800]  yesterday that google is very very proud of whale gnome he is the company
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:00.600]  executive who admitted himself helped organize the 18 days of protest in
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:04.360]  egypt that resulted in the ouster of president host me mubarak but there is
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:09.200]  another google executive that we showed you yesterday that is in the same boat
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:14.440]  some in the media have theorized now that i'm bizarrely inserting google into
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:20.760]  the story of the egyptian revolution no google is bizarrely inserting google
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:25.240]  into the story of the egyptian revolution i want to point out tonight
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:30.680]  that i am i i'm really not sure that i want my search engine involved in
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:36.960]  government overthrows good or bad what i want from a search engine is good search
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:43.960]  results this is not the issue i'm not afraid that google is reading my
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:48.520]  email or tapping your phone lines or stealing grandma's recipes that kind of
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:53.560]  paranoia is reserved for the left during the bush administration with microsoft
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:58.040]  okay let's stop right there i'm not going to play the whole four minute clip
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.360]  but if you want to pull it up online the whole things there that's why i have a
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:07.640]  problem with glenbeck right there did you hear it google's not reading your
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:12.600]  emails google's not tracking you uh... no google is using the camera on your
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.400]  computer google told us five years ago
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:19.080]  we wrote articles about it they're using the microphone on your computer
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:23.080]  to watch and listen to you using nsa software
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:28.040]  google was created on record by a consortium of the cia
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:31.880]  and their public uh... funding firm uh... in kutel
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:35.720]  and the national security agency none of this is debated
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:40.280]  this is all on record so he starts to tell you the truth and i'm going to go
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:45.720]  over what he said and i've got msnbc's report on it which is
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.240]  attacking him wrongly but not on the facts
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:53.800]  oh you can attack glenbeck here this is so sophisticated
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.880]  but it's also brazen at certain levels he's telling you that oh it's the left
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:01.640]  that's concerned about big brother it's the left so people who see
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.160]  themselves as the right say well i'm not worried about having my phones tapped
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.920]  or my email read that's something liberals are concerned about
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.440]  no that's something americans are concerned about
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:16.120]  and if i tried to play the whole clip he did several segments on it it would
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.720]  take hours to analyze the truth and the lies
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:24.120]  and that's what's dangerous about glenbeck you get more truth from glenbeck
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.960]  than anybody else on national television or radio
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.960]  he will go the furthest and that's why he's number one
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.680]  quickly overtaking rush limbaugh you had his tv show into the mix he's bigger
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.760]  than limbaugh but always buried in there is lies
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:45.480]  you heard him say it's kooky and weird and liberal
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.480]  to think google spying on you google is having criminal charges laid on it in
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.000]  europe and the u.s google admits they drive around the entire
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.160]  western world with vans and trucks with antennas
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:02.840]  stealing your wireless data google admittedly takes photos of your house
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:07.240]  google admittedly is spying on people and and
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.040]  blocking out news that they don't want to get to the american people
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:14.200]  and censoring information like info wars dot com
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:18.760]  google openly supports obama like no one else google has
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:24.760]  secret air bases that's associated press at nasa facilities
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:31.160]  google is meeting today in a secret meeting with the president steve jobs
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.080]  eric schmidt and mark zuckerberg to meet with president obama
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.120]  today in san francisco in a closed door meeting
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:44.200]  abc news we told you three and a half weeks ago
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.840]  day one that google was in there running the revolution
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:53.320]  we told you that a week and a half before the supposed google executive
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.440]  disappeared and then now they say that he ran the whole thing
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:01.800]  we told you on record glenn beck listens he figures it out
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:05.160]  now does he come out and tell you the full truth the whole truth nothing but
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:10.200]  the truth no no no he says it's kooky to think that google's spying on you
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:15.720]  but then he goes on to to to balkanize and make it a political left right
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.200]  issue that if you're concerned about big brother
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:24.120]  you're a nut and you're a liberal then he goes on in the piece to say that
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.280]  google is in bed with the nsa and the cia not that they founded it
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.840]  not that they run it but they're in bed with it
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:35.240]  he goes on to say microsoft is good microsoft is on record building back
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:38.680]  doors into all their software for the federal government that's not debated
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.040]  microsoft is on record funding the un and world government
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:48.520]  and carbon taxes so is rippard murdoch i'm sick of it i'm tired of it all
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:52.440]  these guys at the top are and they know there's a left and a right so some of
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.640]  them play the part of the left leaders some of them the part of the right
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.520]  leaders and fox news has tried to deny the world
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.720]  government the new world order for so long that they've been discredited
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.080]  so they go well we got to control this movement let back go in
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.760]  and pose as a patriot and that will fool people
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:13.080]  well not on my watch fox we just exposed you because you asked for it
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:17.240]  with fake video of ron paul being booed fox had to apologize this morning and
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:23.240]  said it was a mistake we're watching you my listeners are watching mr madow
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.800]  and what he's doing we're watching what the msnbc slime is doing
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.600]  we're watching what the cnn slime is doing
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.880]  we're watching what anderson cooper admitted cia
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:37.800]  is doing we are watching what you becky boy
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:43.000]  are doing and we're watching you close now
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.800]  i've i've i've covered some of the disinformation from beck but now
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:54.520]  let's get in to the way the media is attacking him
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.320]  from another deceptive angle lies within lies deception within deception this
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:04.600]  is uh nbc news glenn beck urges google boycott
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.760]  where have you heard that for years where have you heard that
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.160]  right here where have you heard that there's government run right here
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:16.680]  where have you seen the proof right here people say well why do you cover glenn
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:20.200]  beck because he's the leader of the patriot movement fox news is inserting
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:24.200]  to try to take over the tea party he's the guy
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.520]  who makes fun of ron paul at key points he's following a script
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:33.800]  we've got to cover glenn beck because he is usurping what i've done what you've
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:37.560]  done and so our destiny is tied to him he's tied to us
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:42.600]  whether you like it or not he speaks for people that don't want a world
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.560]  government who don't want to live under tyranny
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:50.360]  so that's why we cover it and he's taking everything we cover and spinning it
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.560]  and twisting it we read you the quotes of white
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.760]  house advisors calling for an oklahoma city style attack to be blamed on
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.040]  patriots months later glenn beck covers it with precision
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.160]  and says they're preparing a new oklahoma city pretty bold
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:06.760]  you know why beck did that it was a shot across the bow he can see media matters
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:10.440]  and george sorrell scripts in those articles he said he's being set up
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:15.320]  no in those articles it's alex jones glenn beck and ron paul
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.760]  they're lumping in the judo scott glenn beck with the real mccoy's ron paul
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.440]  and alex jones i'm under attack almost every day on media
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.520]  matters every week on msnbc they produce specials
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:30.440]  on msnbc saying i'm dangerous the southern prairie law center says i'm
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:37.160]  one of the most dangerous people in america they're now going after beck
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.680]  and this is going to get into the internet beta kill switch test this is
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:44.840]  huge news but first we start with beck
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.400]  but oh if you don't like big brother or you think it even exists you're a cook
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.920]  i've had people on the street come up to me and say alex i used to like your
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.840]  show but you're a liar there's no way public schools are watching
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.640]  kids over their government issue laptops at home
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:03.160]  and i'm like but it's it's in hundreds of newspapers they've they've
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.160]  they've settled out of court they admit they were doing it one school 35 000
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.880]  plus images watching kids in their bedrooms
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.160]  but see people still can't believe big brothers that bad
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.760]  because they've been told it's kooky so instead of check out what i'm covering
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:19.880]  that's all i told you about it years before it came out in the news
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:24.280]  california kansas tennessee pennsylvania i mean
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:29.560]  these articles come out in the local news cameras in the school bathrooms
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.760]  i mean just search google watching and listening to you
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:38.920]  over your pc we wrote articles in 2005 i guess six years ago
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:42.200]  at prisonplanet.com where do we get our information
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:47.000]  google filed patents and put out a press release
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.520]  saying their new ad system they want to roll out listens through your microphone
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:55.880]  and your your camera but they said don't worry people aren't listening to you
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:59.720]  it's keyword software so they hear a dog barking in the background was the
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:04.280]  example they gave you'll have dog food ads pop up on your computer screen
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.880]  it's a lot bigger than just geo location you notice you see google ads on a
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.720]  site and it says you know it'll have an ad for a restaurant a mile from you and
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:14.440]  you're like wow well that's because they're tracking
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.520]  you but it's much worse than that it's much worse than
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:22.200]  tracking your ip address or loading cookies onto your computer
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.840]  and this is all admitted that google's spying google's stealing information
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:30.280]  google's manipulating news google's filtering out things they don't want
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.880]  known google's working for the globalist to overthrow countries
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:38.120]  and glenn beck says boycott them because they're they're helping the muslim
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:43.320]  radicals and the muslim brotherhood but they're not big brother
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:47.240]  and he goes on the piece to say their nsa
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.040]  bay area conservative pundit glenn beck said he will
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.880]  no longer use google or its products because of perceived ties
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:57.080]  to government agencies and its involvement in the uprising in egypt
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:04.120]  perceived ties even the mit magazine reported on that five six years ago
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:08.920]  he said on his fox television program wednesday i'm really not sure
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:12.440]  that i want my search engine involved in government overthrows good or bad
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:17.640]  beck said on his fox show there is a strange thing going on
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:22.840]  with this search engine and our government and we all have to choose
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.640]  who we do business with well yeah google's trying to take over the whole
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.920]  web through cyber security to shut down their competition have you read the
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:32.920]  cyber security act back it's kind of like the car program
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.040]  where you could get a loan first putting in your clunker
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:42.120]  and the government had a message saying we will seize control of your computer
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:46.280]  we own your computer we we can track you once you agree to sign on to our computer
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.400]  we cover that a month before then let the glenn beck covers it
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.920]  he goes on to talk about how they're connected to the nsa they have the
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:57.720]  quotes here so they're nsa but they're
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:01.720]  not spying on us i see go solar for cheap

[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:21.240]  okay if you just joined us i've had a lot of national news media the last few
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:24.280]  months including one of the biggest magazines in the country
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:30.680]  writing profiles on yours truly i've gotten calls vanity fair rolling
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:34.280]  stone the list goes on and on and they've all noticed
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.040]  that glenn back does basically take whatever news we cover
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.840]  a year ago a month ago and take it and spend it
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:47.160]  so this is a big issue but it's only a subset of the larger issues but
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:50.680]  here we are telling you that google is admittedly an nsa
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:54.520]  cia front that's not even to die i've read all the mainstream reports the
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:58.360]  mit reports going back google's only 12 years old
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.360]  it is a government front so of course it's overthrowing egypt
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.920]  of course it's trying to overthrow saudi arabia
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:08.280]  of course it's trying to overthrow yemen and jordan
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:13.000]  and did overthrow uh tunisia of course wiki leaks was involved in that
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.040]  because these are fronts they want global revolution they want global
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:20.920]  destabilization and glenn beck is right about that
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:25.160]  the question is why is a power block that runs fox and news corps
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:30.840]  allowing this truth on air because there's an internal war at some level
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:35.160]  inside the new world order this is a big deal the fact that they let glenn beck
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:38.520]  go on tv and talk to three and a half million people a day
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:43.560]  15 16 million people a day on radio is incredible
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.400]  but you notice he adds all these lies into it about don't worry google's not
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:51.880]  spying on you but they are the nsa don't be a kook liberal
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.480]  what a kook liberal what does that have to do with it
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:59.720]  so he he'll he'll he's i'm gonna talk about fema camps and then he
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:03.240]  comes out and discredits them with strawman
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:07.240]  the article continues um however most of his vitriol
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:10.920]  was aimed at google working with hardcore leftist
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:15.000]  these aren't leftist overthrowing countries although beck said he was not
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.760]  suggesting a boycott he implores viewers to follow him in his
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:22.520]  well boycott against google beck said he would outline ways
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.360]  that viewers could avoid using google in his thursday show
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.880]  and i guess that'll be alternate search engines i know they're start page dot com
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.960]  that kathryn albrecht's involved with uh maybe he'll mention that don't hold
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:37.320]  your breath the funny part is that beck says google
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:43.160]  has ties the national security agency no he doesn't say that even the
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.960]  washington post admits that in the last few years
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:49.240]  general services administration to move on dot org so
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:53.880]  google is kind of a hawkish and conservative
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:58.040]  how of its part of move on dot org is it hawkish
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:03.320]  how they try to discredit him claiming that that these groups are hawkish
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:08.040]  when they're not hawkish so google is kind of hawkish and conservative than
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:11.160]  moderate than liberal all at the same time it doesn't make much
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:15.320]  sense because they're not hawkish or liberal or conservative they're globalist
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:19.960]  they're one worlders on record they give money to all these u n organizations
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:24.280]  so see they then go on and try to claim that beck is confusing and doesn't make
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:27.880]  sense because they know the world is complex and they're hoping that you're
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:31.800]  not complex enough to understand it
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.400]  it doesn't make much sense but perhaps beck will bring out a puppet show
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:42.200]  and make it all crystal clear and it goes on to say for the full
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:46.920]  blend back segment click here uh we don't have time to analyze
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:53.640]  the whole thing but you have caught it here's the truth here's the skinning
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:57.800]  the the pentagon and darpa created the internet back in the 1960s brought it
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.120]  online for the general public in the late 1980s
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:04.120]  it was generally accepted when the heavy use in the mid 1990s and now it's
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:08.840]  ubiquitous it is used to conduit and control
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:12.520]  and limit what information you can get first the web is somewhat free
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.960]  now under stated internet to programs they're going to phase that out with
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:19.720]  regulation taxation arbitrary shutdown of web
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:24.120]  domains 84 000 just this week
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:27.640]  google now admits they're filtering news they don't like information they don't
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:31.400]  like google has declared we wrote an article a few weeks ago
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:35.320]  about this the drudge report linked to about how they are beta testing
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:39.240]  blocking out quote content farms like info wars dot com and
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:43.880]  drudge report dot com and so they're now moving into
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:48.920]  the internet kill switch error error they're now
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:53.960]  moving in to that program and you had this developing under bush
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:58.520]  and now under obama and it's a total continuity of a government
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.280]  it's bush that wants the cyber security and his controllers
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:05.320]  it's the same nsa people running cyber security today
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:09.240]  it's continuing under obama this is a continuity of agenda
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:14.840]  they are continuing the exact same program but beck makes it a liberal
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:17.640]  issue the media makes it obama's kill switch
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.520]  when this is exactly what george w bush was pushing for
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:24.280]  and what j rockefeller was pushing for five years ago and what john mccain's
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:27.480]  been pushing for remote kill switches where they claim
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.600]  you had copyrighted material no judge no jury no due process
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.720]  they fry your computer remotely with built-in
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:37.880]  erase switches that microsoft is built in that apple is built in
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:42.120]  under the national security moves in the telecommunications act
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:45.080]  all the devices themselves have been designed
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:49.480]  with remote government takeover systems just like the radio and tv stations
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:54.840]  that's what's going on we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:00.520]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.720]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:07.400]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:11.480]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:15.160]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.040]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:21.560]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:25.160]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:29.080]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:32.680]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.720]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:12.120]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.200]  and government employees but for the rest of us

[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:37.240]  forcing the mainstream controlled globalist media to cover real issues
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:41.800]  they tried to ignore our information for many years
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.480]  but now they're having to respond to it and they're trying to spin it
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:51.400]  i want to finish up with google's plan to take over the internet and hence the
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:55.160]  world and how it is a military industrial complex arm
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:58.520]  not of america but of the private banking cartels

[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:32.440]  so he brings out limited truth then they attack him for saying the sky's blue
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.920]  the sun is yellow and that the moon is white
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:42.680]  that's how dumb they think we all are and as we awaken as we begin to look
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:45.400]  under the rug as we begin to look beneath the floorboards
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:49.080]  as we begin to just pay attention and not just sit there drinking beer
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:53.240]  mindlessly watching television the scams they run on us will become more and
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:55.080]  more evident i'm going to go to your calls in a
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:58.360]  moment but we wrote a big article about this
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:03.400]  yesterday it's also been picked up by cnt news torrent freak dot com
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:09.320]  and others this is the rest of the story the federal government is announcing
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:13.160]  taxes of the web internet ids remote kill switches
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.200]  for the entire internet or for your select computer
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:20.040]  under federal regulations for 14 years now all computers
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:24.200]  all cell phones all broadcast radio all broadcast tv
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:28.280]  everything is wired through government kill switches
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:31.400]  that can also take over the radio and tv station
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:35.880]  last week obama's people put out a press release saying that he's going to now
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:39.800]  start having announcements that break in on the radio and tv
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:43.640]  announcements that break in on your cell phone with text messages
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:49.160]  or even videos 9 000 locations with telescreens telling you watch your
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:53.080]  neighbors in the town park in the county square at
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.440]  walmart at the mall at the grocery store i mean
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:59.960]  this is the grid license plates the feds want
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.320]  with the states that flash ads to pay for it
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:09.720]  that then flash most wanted photos digital computer screen that's waterproof
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:14.280]  water resistant as your license plate i mean
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:18.040]  this is a bombarding system where basically the whole country
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:24.360]  the whole world when they're done will be something akin to
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:28.760]  places like in new york city and time square where you're just assaulted
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.600]  by propaganda assaulted by images whether you like it
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:39.400]  or not this is their full submersion into this high-tech matrix
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:43.640]  tracking grid but one of the latest salvos
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:47.720]  against the internet are the feds i see this every couple days i know you see
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:50.920]  it as well arbitrarily shutting down a thousand websites 10
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:54.440]  thousand websites 84 thousand websites shutting down
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:37:00.360]  sports sites that link to sites that are streaming sporting events not not
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:06.920]  not streaming it themselves not no no no linking to it
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:11.320]  and now 84 thousand websites including dog groomers
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:17.560]  uh real estate companies uh companies selling cutlery
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:24.040]  companies selling lawn service an entire isp
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.440]  was taken over and now it turns out there was no child porn on any of the
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:32.520]  websites at that isp and they ordered the isp to flip
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:37.880]  84 000 plus they round out 84 000 in the news articles
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:42.440]  websites and put a message on screen saying this website
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:48.200]  is involved in child porn and has been seized
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:53.320]  does that show you how arrogant how hubris filled how
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.760]  unfeeling and unthinking the federal government is
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.200]  knowing they can send up these trial balloons knowing that
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:03.880]  they can set these incredible precedents to
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:08.280]  not just take over your website for no reason and destroy your business and your
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:13.240]  free speech in your life but to now have all your customers for
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:18.440]  three days this was up go to your website

[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:30.280]  emo kill switch beta government blocks 84
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:34.360]  thousand websites uh here's the article out of
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:37.240]  tech freak and it links directly the federal government's own admissions of
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:41.880]  this u.s government shuts down 84 thousand websites by
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:45.640]  mistake they say kind of like fox news played a
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:49.320]  old fake video uh because it was fake last year when they first did it
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:54.840]  of ron paul being booed when he won cpac and fox news this morning said it was
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:57.640]  a mistake they're sorry they got caught
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:01.560]  kind of like you get caught robbing a bank you're coming out of the out of the
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:05.400]  vault with big bags of money in your hands with dollar signs in your eyes
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:09.560]  and it's a mistake officer it's a mistake kind of like
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.360]  it's a mistake we're now learning coast to coast
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:16.760]  just scores of cases tsa are just robbing cash
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:20.840]  folks i've had sunglasses tripod stolen i was talking to
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:25.160]  eric muller on his show you know he's had stuff stolen out of his bag
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:32.440]  and i've had something stolen at jfk at jfk i had two gifts for
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:36.200]  my first daughter who was had had just been born recently
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:40.440]  the silver rattle and one other toy they had opened
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:47.000]  up the tiffani packages that had bows on them and one
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.920]  uh a teething ring was gone and the rattle was still there i guess they didn't
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:54.200]  want the rattle they're all like a hundred bucks a piece but it was a gift
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:57.480]  you know so the you know so we remember the birth and everything
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:00.520]  um and i had to go just a few weeks after she was born to
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:04.840]  you know 9 11 event so i i made time to go out and get that for
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:08.760]  uh for my first born daughter my son's first born with the first daughter we
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:12.520]  had little angel uh and tsa just stole it and now it's
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:17.960]  submitted at jfk alone they're now pleading guilty it's reported two tsa
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:26.200]  agents stole more than 160 thousand dollars
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.640]  who watches the watchers but but side issue let me continue with this
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.240]  u.s government shuts down 84 000 websites by mistake
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:38.040]  the u.s government has yet again shuttered several domain names this
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:40.360]  week the department of justice and homeland
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.640]  securities ice office proudly announced that they had seized
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:46.920]  domains related to counterfeit goods and child pornography
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.600]  what they failed to mention however is that one of the targeted domains belongs
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:54.840]  to free dns provider and that 84 000 websites
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:58.600]  were wrongfully accused of links to child pornography crimes
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:03.960]  this is the equivalent of let's say you've got your website with time-warner
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:09.720]  cable in austin a lot of people do and there's one website domain
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:14.920]  registered through the roadrunner cable and let's say there's you know 10 000
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:20.200]  and this is a random example uh case point and they just shut down all the
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:23.640]  websites in austin that have it and then put up a message at their child
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:26.280]  pornographers
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:29.960]  and they're the federal government they think they can do this
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:33.800]  as part of operations save our children ice cyber crime center
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:37.640]  again sees several domain names but not without making a huge error
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.080]  last friday thousands of side owners were surprised by a rather worrying
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:44.120]  banner rather worrying banner that was placed on their
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:46.920]  domain advertisement distribution transportation
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:50.040]  receipt possession of child pornography constitute federal crimes
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:53.880]  that carry penalties for the first time offenders of up to 30 years in federal
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:56.520]  prison or a quarter million dollar fine forfeiture
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:59.960]  and restitution was the worrying message they read on their websites
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:04.600]  worrying how about the the defaming the incredibly destructive
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.960]  somebody goes to get the phone number to their plumber you forget
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:12.200]  you know the plumbers phone number you you go to the plumber website and it
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:15.800]  says their child porno people
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:20.600]  and this shows how they can just flip switches and shut down websites
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:25.000]  flip switches and shut down whole isps flip switches and shut down whole dns
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.880]  systems just like egypt did meanwhile they're
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:32.040]  running around saying how great google is overthrowing egypt how great it is
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:36.360]  how horrible mubarak was shutting off the web and they're openly pushing
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.720]  in congress for the legislation to implement what they've already gotten
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.120]  place
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:46.920]  they've already got the collective internet's neck in the guillotine
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.720]  and now they're just asking for congress to pass the law
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:52.600]  so they can flip the switch and then they'll do it and select cases
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:56.760]  that make it sound like it's reasonable oh this guy was going to sell bombs we
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.640]  shut his website off oh this person was a child pornography
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:02.680]  oh this person was linking to copyright stuff
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:09.880]  and it just expands out from there so curt nemo's article breaks all this
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:12.760]  down and they have a new bill that would amend the
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:17.720]  homeland security act of 2002 that would allow the government to
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:25.480]  shut down all or part of the internet any time they want
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:30.520]  meanwhile uh the media is making jokes about glenn back
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:33.240]  saying you know that google is government run well here's
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:37.720]  french news agency u.s state criticizes google search tactics
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:41.960]  the top attorney to say to texas on wednesday revealed a list of demands
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:45.240]  for inside information intended to ferret out whether google abused its power
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:49.640]  and online search ad arena texas attorney general greg abbott wanted names of
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:53.560]  people responsible for google ads search results the business relations along
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:56.840]  with internal documents and minutes for meetings at the california firm
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:03.240]  yeah they don't just sell google news or google web or google video where
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:07.320]  where you pay to have your google ads on the side when somebody searches
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:11.640]  they don't just do that google allows you to buy
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:17.960]  when someone searches british petroleum or somebody searches tsa that it's tsa
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:21.400]  all at the top that it's bp all at the top for the
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:24.920]  sometimes 30 pages deep where you can't see any
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:28.520]  the searches are supposed to be whoever gets the most traffic whatever has the
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:32.520]  key words in it that goes to the top but they've changed their algorithm
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:36.120]  and admitted two weeks ago to shut down alternative news
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:39.640]  and our article on that with this press released by google was on the drudge
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:43.000]  report if you forgot where that article could be found
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.840]  and i'm going to have articles written today tomorrow and uh right through the
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:51.640]  weekend by paul joseph watson and steve watson on this
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:55.320]  but it's a cocktail of ways they're going after the web
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:58.920]  and if you're doubting the internet kill switch here's usa today
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:01.960]  a raging debate the headline is kill switch internet bill
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:05.880]  alarms privacy experts a raging debate over new legislation and its impact on
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:09.320]  the internet has tongues wagging and fingers pointing at silicon valley to
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:13.000]  dc just as the egyptian government recently forced the internet to go dark
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.080]  us officials could flip a switch if the protecting cyberspace and national
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:20.440]  asset legislation becomes law says it's critic
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:23.320]  proponents of the bill which is expected to be reintroduced in the current
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:26.920]  session of congress to dismiss the detractors as ill-informed and naive
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:29.560]  i got Lieberman and rockefeller and all of them
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:34.040]  senator rockefeller saying they want to start shutting off alternative media
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:37.240]  the ominously nicknamed kill switch bill is sure to be a flashpoint of
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:41.000]  discussion at the rsa conference the nation's largest gathering of
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.520]  computer security experts that take place here this week
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:48.440]  the bill crafted by senator Lieberman and susan collins of main
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:53.880]  tom carper of delaware aims to defend the economic infrastructure from a
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:56.600]  cyber terrorist attack like stuxnet that the government
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:00.280]  launched against itself but it has free speech advocates and privacy experts
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:03.480]  howling over the prospect of a government agency quelling the
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:05.560]  communication of hundreds of millions of people
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:09.320]  this is all about control and attempt to control every aspect of our
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:12.680]  existence says christopher feudal cyber security expert
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.880]  who is chairman of the security fusion solutions i want to get
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:20.520]  christopher feudal on jaren please i consider it an attack on our personal
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:23.720]  right to free speech look what recently occurred in egypt
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:28.280]  it goes on we would write article six seven years ago
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:31.880]  about google the trojan horse of internet takeover with all the proof of
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:35.400]  them being government run and exactly how they're now rolling this out
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:39.560]  and we got laughed at even though we link to all the proof
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:43.880]  it's coming it's here they changed their algorithm they're phasing it in three
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:46.920]  months ago massively hurting the number of searches
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:49.560]  we get and people linking to info wars and prison planet
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:53.240]  but our growth rate is so incredible and you're spreading the word about info
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:55.880]  wars dot com and prison planet dot com on
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:47:00.600]  myspace and facebook and youtube and on street corners and at work that we're
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:04.520]  still shooting up like a rocket but we can go into google analytics

[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:54.520]  talking about this there'll be enough furor that the system isn't able to
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:58.280]  get these draconian changes through

[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:00.840]  more um i've been listening to you for quite
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:03.720]  some time i think the first time i learned anything about you
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:08.040]  was when you started raising the ruckus about what happened in waco
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:13.160]  and i don't i can't right now remember when exactly that was it's 1995
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:17.160]  okay you produced some videos i believe am i correct
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:23.720]  yes yeah you you made a big uh impression on some of
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:28.600]  my classmates in graduate school who were fbi agents and government agents
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:34.280]  they were mad as a hornet at this story and uh that got my attention
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:37.960]  with of you a long time ago they were mad at me the
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:43.880]  they were mad at me well that you uh you did not uh
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:47.080]  by telling the truth you embarrassed a lot of people well i went to public
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:50.440]  events in front of janet rino i went and confronted fbi agents
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:54.200]  at waco in front of news cameras and yeah they i mean we did get some death
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.560]  threats over that so there were some folks you knew that were very upset

[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:05.720]  i started paying attention but that the first time i became aware of you is my
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:09.880]  point was this this thing and i just happened by coincidence to be in

[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:16.760]  okay uh i feel like i'm talking to somebody i
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:19.640]  known for a long time you get that all the time i'm sure
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:23.080]  and who i respect but i but i want to respectfully
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:28.920]  disagree a little bit and with some of the uh historical
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:32.200]  information that some of your guests talk about israel
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:36.440]  what's going on now the part i want to agree about is i've lived over six years
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:40.600]  i have been in that um uh the illuminati temple that's
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:43.560]  called a supreme court of israel and i've watched
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:49.640]  people be uh really tried like an inquisition in there
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:53.400]  and so much of your criticisms of israel are correct
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:57.400]  many of us here have been trying for years to uh end the
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:02.200]  uh usa to israel when you probably are not aware of that
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:06.840]  but uh a lot of even religious Jews would prefer
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:10.680]  to see an end to this and it's something you want to be clear
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:15.320]  look look look i criticize israel just like i criticize the u.s government of
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:19.560]  the chinese government uh the reason a lot of the real israel
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:22.600]  haters don't like me is because they know i don't have a hatred
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:26.280]  for israel i mean i have a dislike for big corrupt
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:30.120]  operations but i also don't like the camp that says if you criticize anything
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:33.960]  israel's doing you know that you're an anti-semi so i won't be intimidated by
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:38.680]  those folks either but go ahead me i i i know i've absolutely not that and i've
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:42.840]  gotten in arguments with people about you the defending you about that
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:47.240]  there's uh the adl is as much an enemy of the jewish people as uh
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:51.800]  storm front or any other group and a lot of us a lot of us here probably
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:55.640]  are more than you want to believe uh you know
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:56:00.520]  uh think this way they do not talk for us they do not represent us so what's
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:04.440]  the meat of what you're saying it's like where am i wrong tell me
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:08.760]  say again what's the meat of where i'm wrong i mean tell me
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:13.240]  oh i don't know that you're wrong i just think there are some things that
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:17.320]  nobody's brought to your attention before okay tell me that's it
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:25.160]  uh the the uh i want let me focus strictly on on the legal rights of israel
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:29.320]  that after you know the great war was not just a war in europe there's a war
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:33.640]  against the turks and and uh those allied powers
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:38.680]  took took the land away from the turks and from that they divided it all up
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:42.280]  and mainly gave to mausolans who were their allies
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:46.040]  the laurence of arabia crowd had a big influence
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:50.680]  and uh you know we can spend a long time trying to understand why
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:54.440]  but uh there was a in that time in britain there was a
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:57:00.200]  deep anti-semitism still there that showed up but a certain forces in
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:04.680]  history in 1799 uh the napoleon declared he was going to return the
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:09.080]  jews to the land and a lot of people don't know that
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:13.560]  and uh so the thing that uh we didn't just spring up here after the
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.680]  shoah there were there were moves to make uh
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:19.800]  to make all the outcome to israel long before that
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:24.600]  and then when the when the allied powers the same people who set the borders
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:27.400]  the people you call the new world order that's who they are
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:30.840]  when these people divided up the land they made the the borders of turkey
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:35.080]  greece saudi arabia all the countries and
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:39.480]  the jews had not been doing very well now this was before the holocaust way
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:42.920]  before the holocaust jews hadn't been living very well there was a
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:47.720]  general acceptance of that and and a desire to change that
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:52.520]  jews began suddenly got equal rights they didn't have that before
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:58.040]  and uh unfortunately uh families like the Rothschilds came up
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:02.520]  opportunistic thieving all the things all the
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:05.480]  they're they're not they're not a nice family no i think what you're saying
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:09.480]  is yes the rothschilds are globalist and just because they're bad
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:12.200]  doesn't then mean that all jews are involved in and i totally agree just
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:16.040]  like the chinese government is corrupt murdering killers it's not because
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:19.320]  they're asian it's not because they're chinese just like
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:23.560]  hitler took over and was bad didn't mean all germans you know uh
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:27.720]  you were involved in that they got conned you know what i'm out of time but

[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:35.400]  going to have open phones as well for all of you that are holding
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:40.760]  tom in new york you're on the air welcome hey i have good speaking again
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:46.200]  going to talk to you what's on your mind uh no uh so i'm going up some of our
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:49.640]  two points i was uh i'm in construction so i was
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:53.960]  reading up on my OSHA regulations the other day and i realized that the tsa is
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:57.320]  in complete defiance of those regulations yeah they're in
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:04.200]  violation of the uh radiation uh regulations uh they have tsa now at
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:07.000]  checkpoints with even more high-powered scanners with their people
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.600]  standing under them with no protection making families drive under it
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:14.200]  they just do whatever they want and there's a new article out that just went
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:18.040]  up at prisonplanet.com epidemic of tsa criminality
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:21.960]  more agents caught stealing cash from luggage another arrested for assault go
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:26.200]  ahead yeah but as i was reading i realized that this person put up
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:30.280]  notifications throughout the airport warning radiation exposure
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:33.880]  other tsa agents supposed to be wearing radiation badges to monitor the amount
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:38.120]  of radiation they take in daily and they just don't comply with any of this
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:41.240]  it's called tyranny because then they would recognize the amount of
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:43.880]  radiation they're getting but that's not happening
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:47.880]  they won't even let congress two years into scanners being in
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:50.440]  the last year they put them in more places but they've been going in for over
[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:53.640]  two years they won't even do a basic radiation study
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:58.840]  or release their internal studies to congress it's a lawless federal takeover
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:02.360]  group of crooks the way i look at it is that the
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:05.880]  reason they don't do it is because if the people actually seeing warning signs
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:08.920]  and radiation badges they would have to ask themselves a question
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:12.680]  when am i exposing myself to my family too that's what the globalists are all
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:15.080]  about you've really we have what we should have curtain demo or erin
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:18.360]  dyke's doing article on this because i've already talked about the fact that
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:22.200]  they're in violation of osha regulations they're in violation
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:26.520]  of radiation laws that every dental office every clinic
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:30.280]  every hospital has to follow it's incredible they just do
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:33.720]  whatever they want just like they radiated our own soldiers and
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:37.320]  shot little kids up with syphilis the government is setting the precedent to
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:39.720]  do whatever they want
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:42.840]  the other thing i want to bring up to you i'm sitting in my car the other day
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:45.480]  you know new york follow up talking and he already
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:51.000]  has spotted the bomb in a homeland security e-verify system
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.360]  apparently it's some kind of online system where employees could check
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:59.960]  check up on their uh the employees could check up on their employees
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:04.280]  yes that's what ridge said eight years ago is that to have a job this is all on
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:06.920]  record you're going to have to go through homeland security checks
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:10.600]  it's going to be a no fly no gun buy no work list
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:14.280]  and they're going to have tsa train people in every city
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:18.360]  this is the federal police force of just minimum wage goons
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:23.000]  raping robbing stealing stripping down naked running around saying they're god
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.040]  remember when that happened a few months ago
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:29.640]  yeah i i actually called in a couple a couple weeks ago we told you about
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:32.920]  swift and slack about what
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:36.360]  swift and slack uh secure worker consortium
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:41.560]  and uh oh yeah worker yeah and now i guess i found this interesting that
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:44.840]  there's radio spots all over the radio in new york so it's
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:49.080]  e-verify system you might read about it they actually have a youtube video
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:53.320]  explaining it and how it could be be easily abused
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:57.000]  oh homeland security has a system employers should use
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:00.760]  and and that's all about if you if they don't like you you don't work and this
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:04.600]  is all admitted this is a total takeover of society
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:08.920]  ridge everything he talked about eight years ago is now being implemented
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:13.960]  it's continuity of agenda george bush goes barack obama comes in it continues
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:18.040]  barack obama leaves it continues this is a global
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:23.960]  program different names but the same implementation all over the world
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:27.240]  yeah okay that's all the points i wanted to make i just wanted to know me i just
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:29.800]  want to make sure you know about this e-verify system
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:34.840]  that i i mean i wasn't aware that they said to own a gun to shop to travel to
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:37.960]  have a credit card uh to have a job you're gonna have to have
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:42.600]  homeland security approval i mean look the airports are the beta test to train
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:45.960]  you in that high security zone to then expand that out to
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:51.320]  shopping malls walmarts workplaces highway checkpoints trains
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:55.800]  buses and now eight years after we warned you because they told us what they
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:01.960]  would do it's all happening we'll be right back stay with us
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:05.960]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:09.160]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:13.160]  as we're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:16.360]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:20.760]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:25.640]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:29.560]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:33.240]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:36.600]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:40.360]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:44.200]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:47.720]  and right now in washington dc we have seen
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:51.480]  a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic

[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:24.360]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:27.320]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation

[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:38.920]  for it housing numbers continuing to plunge the real state of the economy
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:42.600]  with a true financial genius and then we'll get into a bunch of
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:45.960]  other issues with her the unfolding police state
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:49.800]  the open calls for internet kill switches while they attacked

[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:01.000]  katherine great to have you on with us and you forgot to mention one of the
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.200]  one of my credentials what is that member in good standing of the alex
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:11.640]  jones fan club
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:15.640]  now it's so great to be back i just i just love your show alex i just love
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:19.800]  you so uh... it's it's always a pleasure
[02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:24.200]  now uh... we it's things are accelerating we have really reached a tipping point
[02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:29.400]  you know for years alex we had a bubble where we just printed more and more
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:31.800]  paper and more and more print paper and
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:36.120]  you know you and and so many really great people tried to warn us about
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:38.920]  you know we can't just keep printing paper like this
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:42.600]  well now we've come into the endgame and now
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:47.720]  i'm doing a salieri report tonight which is my sort of briefing for subscribers
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:52.120]  and my theme tonight is going to be global debt for equity swap
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:57.560]  and let me explain what i mean by that when you when you print this paper
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:01.480]  really what you're printing is bonds and it's the bond market that's ballooned
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:04.280]  we've had a long-term bull market the bond market
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:07.640]  and now we're sitting here with all these bonds and it's not like we've
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:11.640]  created more real things you know so there's the same amount of land and the
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:14.840]  same amount of gold and you know there's some more people
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:18.280]  and and now we've got to say we've got all this paper and sitting in the bond
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:21.640]  market it's kind of eyeing the equity market and tangibles and the precious
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:25.000]  metals and things uh-oh maybe we have to get out of paper
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.960]  into real things how are we going to do that
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:31.800]  and that's the that's the shift because when you get out of the bubble the next
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:36.440]  thing that happens is everybody's got to get out of debt and get into equity
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:39.400]  and and that's the process you're seeing accelerate
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:43.160]  and it's really you know some days it's just i know because you're
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:47.000]  you're watching the news every day you're you know you come to your website
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.880]  and it's more news than the wall street journal these days
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:53.880]  and and it's accelerating and it's it's kind of dizzying
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:12:00.280]  we had a perfect example as as we've had the germans basically take over the
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:03.160]  new york stock exchange and there's almost no
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:06.360]  discussion in in the mainstream media and in congress
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:10.360]  that was the first big issue but i want you to put it in layman's terms
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:15.400]  what these consolidations of the stock exchanges mean
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:19.160]  well what what's happening is if you look at how
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:23.320]  we're integrating global trading there's tremendous redundancy in the
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:28.040]  exchanges um and and there's also pressure to
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.120]  centralize control and uh you know so that's clearly
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:35.160]  happening now what exactly is driving the
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:38.040]  the merger with the germans at this time
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:41.960]  that's a big question mark i'm not clear uh but
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:46.600]  but make no mistake about it what you're talking is basically the germans
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:53.560]  controlling our our biggest stock exchange i mean we're talking about
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:56.520]  deleting sovereign government here we're talking about
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:01.160]  literally the germans in control now it's important to point out that the
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:04.360]  critical issue here is going to be who controls the system
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:07.400]  because if lockheed and dinecore is still controlling and operating the
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:10.520]  systems there's really not as much of a change of control as it looks
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:13.480]  and then meanwhile that little friendly nice guy named
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:17.240]  john stewart that's not his real name his brother
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:22.040]  runs the new york stock exchange and we've got the communist chinese owning
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:24.840]  the majority of the debt next the private fellow reserve that's
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:28.360]  international now the germans coming in and taking over
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:33.240]  the stock exchange with almost no news and this unifies the fraud
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:37.240]  so the inside players are able to engage in fraud
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:41.160]  and not get caught correct me if i'm wrong but studying this is a layman
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:45.080]  the manipulation of stock markets gets exposed by other
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:49.160]  other stock markets that are connected to it but if they get it all under one
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:53.880]  house then the sky's the limit right that's good this guy well
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:57.800]  pretty much the sky is the limit now anyway because the
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:01.880]  the game has so pushed beyond the regulators
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:06.200]  ability both intellectually and politically to deal with it
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:10.440]  that what we've seen alex as we saw over the last 15 years with the bubble
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:13.640]  tremendous fraud i've talked a lot about the mortgage
[02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:17.000]  fraud which i'm more familiar with than the securities fraud or the
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  the equities fraud but we've seen tremendous fraud both in the mortgage
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.640]  market the securities market the bond market the result of that fraud was
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:30.840]  the people who did it got refinanced out with the bailouts
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:35.160]  you know so so not only did they engineer the fraud but they got
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:38.600]  refinanced out in total and the fraud was a huge success
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:42.600]  that's why i call it a financial coup d'etat and the reality is
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:46.200]  you know from their point of view it was simply a takeover
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:49.720]  and it was a successful thing it was a successful financial coup d'etat
[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:53.320]  and there's literally been no indictments or no prosecution and and the
[02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:57.800]  message is clear it was a read a fundamental re-engineering as opposed
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:02.360]  to incompetence or or what they think of as
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:06.040]  criminal behavior this has all been methodically set up and prepared
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:08.440]  goldman sacks and others got their regulators
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:15.480]  in over ireland the u.s uh places like new zealand everywhere
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:20.280]  they ran the same scam and now they openly admit yes we're going to slowly
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:23.960]  kill the dollar yes we're going to have the sdr is the new currency
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:26.600]  yes you're going to pay carbon taxes and all of this
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:30.440]  to private banks so the ponzi scheme operators
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:34.200]  are now openly setting up world government run by them
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:38.760]  holding our country's hostage to the derivatives debt that we don't know
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:42.760]  that they've created and bernie made off from prison comes out and says
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:45.800]  the banks had to know on monday what he was doing
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:49.960]  and of course they knew he was just a new he was just a mid-level player
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:53.480]  uh so let's go through the global government what it looks like who the
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:56.360]  players are and then what's happening currently
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:59.560]  as they bring in the austerity and lie to people and say
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:03.880]  cut the paychecks get rid of the teachers raise the taxes
[02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:06.840]  steal more of the pension funds and that'll fix the debt
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:10.600]  when they never even address the 1.5 quadrillion so that
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:14.680]  we could pay all of our money in taxes get rid of all of the services
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:18.040]  and still it wouldn't even put a dent in the 1.5 quadrillion
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:22.200]  so they're scapegoating wisconsin's and the irish and others right now
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:25.720]  well but let's let's break it down because if you look at how much money
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:30.360]  has been siphoned off um when they say there's no money
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:34.680]  you know question number one is where did the where did the trillions that have
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:39.640]  disappeared including illegally go to so so question number one and when you
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:43.720]  say that there's no money well you know there's it's like saying there's no
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:46.520]  milk in the milk bucket when there's a hole in the bottom where it's been
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:50.120]  running out to so so the money went somewhere
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:54.680]  and that's question mark number one but question mark number two is
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:58.440]  we've known for 50 years that we were running
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:02.600]  the united states population on an unsustainable basis now
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:06.600]  during that 50 years we've produced billions in
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:10.040]  well trillions of dollars of retirement savings and that's part of the money
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:13.080]  that sort of disappeared down the hole
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:16.440]  but the reality is everybody in america has known that this is not a
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:19.560]  sustainable system we've all avoided it it's not just
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:24.200]  the elites but we've avoided it too one of the reason the politics have
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:27.800]  worked the way they worked alexis because we've said
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:31.800]  uh... you know give us more money we don't want to change
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:35.240]  and every year we've been able to do that in the governmental
[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:40.520]  mental mechanism that's like a of a bass biting down on a purple worm
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:43.560]  i mean we're certainly the ignorant fish
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:47.400]  that's biting into the hook but i'm talking about where that hook
[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:51.800]  we're not ignorant alex i mean the way you get power over
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:55.000]  you know to solve a problem you need power the way you get power is to take
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.360]  responsibility i agree and the reality is you know we
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:04.600]  but let's go let's look at the money whatever the american government is
[02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:09.080]  doing every one of us is financing it by paying our taxes
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:13.240]  okay yes uh... every one of it is financing it by putting money in
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:17.480]  pension funds and not uh... having a position on where it goes
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:20.600]  everyone is uh... of us is donating money
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:24.040]  including tithing to churches who are supporting and going along with all of
[02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:27.080]  this every one of us is shopping or banking at
[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:29.560]  the banks and the stores that are doing that
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:33.000]  okay if you look at how our money works
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.560]  household by household county by county we have the power to say you know
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:40.840]  something we're not going to finance this anymore if you
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:45.800]  my church wants you know my tithe every month and you've got to change
[02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:48.200]  you know what you're doing and how you're doing it
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:51.960]  i'm not just going to pay taxes to a government that's running drugs
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:55.000]  um... i'm going to go get a lawyer and we're going to battle this out in court
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:58.920]  we're going to organize locally and do a local escrow for tax money
[02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:02.200]  as long as you're running the government on a legal basis and transfer
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:08.520]  are going out the back door so in other words we're all participating in this
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:12.920]  and we're all complicit in it and and it's by seeing that that we see the
[02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:16.600]  opportunities to start to really make serious change
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:20.280]  well kathryn i agree with you that we need to look in the mirror
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:24.120]  if you want to see the main you know culprit but at the same time
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:28.520]  i'm talking about the the brains that are actually implementing
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:31.400]  uh... the scam i mean what you're talking about is what black folks for
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:34.600]  fifty years have talked about that they just spent their money
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:37.880]  in their neighborhoods they would become wealthy
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:41.800]  but they never do that so so i understand they are part to blame
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:44.280]  i am part to blame but i'm also talking about the
[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:48.680]  overall economic system that designs it or it's so easy
[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:51.960]  uh... to be defrauded and it's so easy for the general public
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:55.240]  to be ignorant i mean you you know what's happening i know what's happening
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:58.440]  but still the general public doesn't they're starting to wake up
[02:19:58.440 --> 02:20:01.960]  let's come back and break it all down with kathryn austin fits hi this is alex
[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:04.200]  jones did you know that the global elite are now
[02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:07.960]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:11.240]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:14.520]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:17.800]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:20.680]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:23.720]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:27.240]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:34.200]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in
[02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:37.240]  any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:41.800]  acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com

[02:24:00.440 --> 02:24:15.960]  kathryn austin fits is our guest financial expert extraordinaire
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:20.600]  kathryn i mean we know what they're doing we know what the problem is but
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:25.560]  but summing it up what is the end game of these people if we don't stop them i
[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:29.480]  mean it's just unlimited uh... the amount of theft they're engaging in their
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:32.760]  destruction of the economy by design and they offer
[02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:36.360]  the solution being given them more power than things get worse
[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:39.160]  and the solution is give them more power you talked about government drug
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:42.280]  dealing i mean it's in bloomberg it's in bloomberg that
[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:47.000]  367 billion dollars uh... in uh...
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.920]  you know one major u.s bank alone of drug money and it turns out they're running
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:54.840]  the aircraft right i think i think it's pretty simple
[02:24:54.840 --> 02:25:00.040]  you have a small group of people who have been in control
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:04.760]  of governance on planet earth and they're looking at the growth of
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:07.800]  population and they're saying we need a plan to be
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:14.200]  in environmental harmony and we need uh... a way to integrate new technology
[02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:18.680]  because the growth of the new technology and discoveries in
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:23.080]  technology are accelerating that make it much harder to stay in control
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:27.000]  and so i think what they're saying is we need a much smaller population
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:32.280]  a population that that can be uh... will be much easier to control
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:36.600]  and and will leave us in control but also will bring the planet back into
[02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:40.680]  environmental harmony because living in the current lifestyle
[02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:44.440]  on the planet we're doing is you know it's just not environmentally
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:48.520]  in harmony the way it's being done now so the the question for them is how do
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:52.040]  we get to environmental harmony and stay in control
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:55.080]  and be able to integrate new technology without
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:59.560]  losing control and um and the reality is they want
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:03.880]  a much greater centralization and they might want a much smaller population
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:06.360]  and i think all the different things we're watching
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:11.560]  are are not you know we have to be careful not to compare what's happening to
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:14.200]  the official myth of what's supposed to be happening
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:17.240]  and we have to step back and look at what's happening and say okay well this
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:20.520]  is really happening it's a little bit like you remember that line in
[02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:23.480]  rosemary's baby when she's being raped by the
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:27.240]  you know demonic figure and she says oh this is really happening well
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:30.440]  you know step one is we have to get out of denial and say this is really
[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:34.120]  happening um you know things are very different
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:37.240]  we have an official story of what's supposed to be happening
[02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:40.600]  we need to let go of that and start looking what's really going on and the
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:44.920]  reality is um we we literally have a group of
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:48.600]  people alex who has now gotten a hold of
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:52.360]  much more advanced technology not only that that
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:57.160]  you know that it is adopted generally but is beyond what we know exists
[02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:00.520]  and they literally have become and this is Richard Dolan's expression of
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:04.840]  breakaway civilization they no longer consider themselves
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:09.320]  of the same species as us and they never you know they no longer consider
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:12.280]  themselves subject to the same laws and
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:15.960]  rules that we're subject to and by the way the globalist all write books and
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:19.000]  make statements about this i covered my film in game
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:22.920]  they believe we're animals it's social Darwinism and it's their right to dumb
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:27.160]  us down get us in control grids and then kill us
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:30.200]  and then i'm here warning the general public a lot of them are listening
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:33.240]  others make jokes and the globalists say see
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:37.800]  they want us to kill them they deserve it
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:41.320]  well there's no doubt there's a cyclic disrespect between the
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:44.600]  between the general population and the people who are
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:48.440]  who are governing and one of the reasons that there is
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:51.480]  alex is because and i speak as somebody who
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:55.240]  at a very minor lower level has been part of that group
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:28:01.160]  um you know when you try and and govern when you try and build a consensus
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:05.560]  for uh turning an aircraft carrier and turning it in time
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:09.640]  it is it is such a frustrating experience that at some point you
[02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:14.120]  you give up you give up trying to have an intelligent conversation
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:18.680]  with the general population and you just decide to manipulate
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:21.560]  and and you decide to manipulate because you've got to turn the aircraft
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:25.320]  carrier in time and and essentially what you
[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:28.600]  learn is eventually you know the crowd will always
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:33.640]  do what makes the crowd the most money there was a really brilliant comment in
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:37.720]  the in an interview that julina fash did with time magazine about a month or
[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:41.240]  two ago which he said you know political change in
[02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:45.000]  america doesn't result in in change and that's because america has been
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.160]  fiscalized and what he meant by that is if you drill down and look at every
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:53.000]  household in america and where their income comes from
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  and every county level you know sort of municipal
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.600]  infrastructure and where their income comes from up to the state
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:03.960]  the federal government is the primary source of income at this point i mean
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:08.200]  we're much more socialized um financially than the
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:11.400]  than the soviet union was before it fell and
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:16.200]  and literally the dependency on on the federal till
[02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:20.600]  is so enormous that that even when you get political change you don't get
[02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:23.880]  changed because everybody's on the dole
[02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:27.560]  and and that's why i keep coming back to the money and dealing with the money
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:31.240]  because unless we shift the money we're going to sit
[02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:34.840]  financially dependent on the very people who try to kill us
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:38.680]  all right i want to talk to you as a former insider about how you see them
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:41.240]  rolling the sound then i want to talk about some

[02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:04.680]  alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over
[02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:09.880]  it ended on june of 2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not
[02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:12.600]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers
[02:30:12.600 --> 02:30:15.800]  and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting

[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:42.440]  i talked to alexa when we first started about this uh
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:47.560]  to shift between bonds and equities and one of the things that means given the
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:51.720]  pressure on the bond market the sort of the end of the bull bond market is
[02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:55.480]  now financing the things we financed with fixed income is
[02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:58.920]  is now going to shift and it's going to be much more expensive
[02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:02.120]  and what that means is mortgage financing is going to be much harder to get
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:05.000]  it's going to be more expensive tougher terms and conditions
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:10.200]  now that's part of policy uh a policy determination by as you would call the
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:13.240]  globalist but it's one that that would have to happen
[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:17.080]  anyway because of the amount of paper that we've printed in the sort of the
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:21.320]  day of reckoning being here so this is very tough news on the
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:25.720]  housing market at the same time we see the federal government and and part and
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:28.920]  parcel of that is interest rates starting to creep up
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:33.000]  and the risk that they could go up even much higher
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.040]  um but we see the federal government announcing that they're going to
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:42.040]  basically liquidate shutdown or or and fanny and freddy in some way so that
[02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:46.280]  that means tremendous subsidy that's been flowing in keeping the housing
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:49.960]  market going um cut off and in the decapitizing
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.560]  housing i just list a whole lot of other things so the other shoe is
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:56.440]  beginning to drop the other should be getting dropped and believe it or not
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:37:00.600]  one of the biggest issues is not direct on housing it's that everybody is
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:03.800]  living in housing is experiencing rising expenses
[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:07.480]  and falling uh income it's what i call the slow burn
[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:11.000]  but i was up in philadelphia for a couple months at the end of the year and i had
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:15.480]  one person very you know tiny lovely little row house their
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:20.120]  their utility bill last year was $200 a month this year it's $800 a month
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:23.960]  they're choking and and you do you know during all the blizzards you heard that
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:28.920]  from all over the country so that means the cost of maintaining repairing
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:33.080]  heating a home is is skyrocket and the head of the energy department said
[02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:36.440]  last week they're going to shut down at least 500
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:39.080]  power plants china's building three to five a week
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:42.840]  we can't build new ones and they're literally saying they're going to bankrupt
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:45.320]  the coal industry whether you like coal or not
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:49.720]  that's more than half of our energy i mean this is economic warfare a post
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:53.320]  industrial world well what what this means is a tremendous
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:56.920]  amount of the growth americans most americans have always thought of their
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:00.520]  home as an investment we're going into a world where
[02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:03.800]  your home is not an investment it's a consumption good
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:07.880]  you know it's a consumption good just like uh you know
[02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:14.040]  buying a car okay or or uh i don't know buying a buying a dress
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:18.760]  okay so it's now a consumption good and a lot of the growth in the value of
[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:21.800]  homes has come from the debasement of the currency
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:26.760]  and from larger homes so we've had a massive infusion of federal credit to
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:30.440]  make mortgage financing cheaper more accessible and that's financed
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:33.800]  everybody having more and more space now it's going to reverse and go the other
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:37.640]  way and so whether it's the expense part of your
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:40.920]  of maintaining and owning a home or the financing
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:45.400]  or simply the size what we're going to see is smaller and smaller homes
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:48.440]  driven by people that's going to look like people's preferences so we're
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:53.000]  going to see a rear reversal of where we've been and that has a very
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:57.960]  important strategy or implications to the strategies of most household
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:00.360]  on what kind of home they're going to have where they're going to have it what
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:02.600]  they're going to pay for it and how they're going to finance it
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:05.560]  i'll tell you what's incredible and i want to get your inside baseball take on
[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:08.120]  this working at the highest levels of government
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:13.800]  two weeks ago the winehouse about 28 hours 30 hours after we wrote a report
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:17.320]  that it was energy policies causing a lot of the blackouts because of increased
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:20.760]  consumption and not having enough power and the texas
[02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:23.400]  reliability energy energy commission agreed with us
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:26.600]  heritage agreed with us in their analysis the white house actually
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:30.680]  responded on their front page and said that we were liars
[02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:34.040]  but then the next day the energy secretary comes out and says we're
[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:38.120]  going to shut down a lot of the plants i mean it's incredible why would the
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:41.960]  white house respond to us are we are we hitting pretty close to the bone
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:46.840]  they're not they're not concerned with libel law
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:51.720]  yeah i know i i i think i think uh...
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:55.640]  you know i think there's um real sensitivity here
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:59.240]  and um and they're you know essentially
[02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:04.440]  there's tremendous effort being put into keeping the official story going
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:08.120]  and but the official story is wearing thin and so i think there's real
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:12.680]  sensitivity on these issues now what we need is we need for everybody in
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:16.600]  america to realize look you know you've got to
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:20.360]  be on one side of the other most americans think that they can stay in the
[02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:22.440]  middle of the road and it's and that's the work
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:26.200]  workable strategy the reality is you know
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:30.120]  there is no middle of the road anymore if you if you look at what's going on and
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:35.480]  i just spent uh i just spent a half an hour with a natural path yesterday
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:39.000]  going through the details of what is in the chem trails
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:43.480]  and what that does to your body and what you have to do to try and mitigate it
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:46.760]  it's the most you know it's uh i don't know if you've
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:50.040]  ever done work uh show on margeline's disease
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:54.600]  but if you really get down and look at what is being sprayed overhead by the
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:59.080]  government and you really face that you know it's a real day of reckoning
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:03.320]  alex because you have to say well why am i financing this because every one of us
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:06.920]  with our money whether it's where we think or how we pay our tax we're
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:12.520]  financing now we've gotten so snuggled in with accepting being abused that
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:16.280]  they can come out and admit they're radiating kids radiating tsa
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:20.440]  shooting people up with syphilis in guatemala un caught giving kids live
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:24.680]  polio constantly in the news and it's just oh they're killing us for our own
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:29.800]  good let's love the government i mean the the the people running things
[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:34.280]  are literally uh you know i don't i don't think people
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:38.920]  you know my personal experience with most americans is they're scared
[02:41:38.920 --> 02:41:42.760]  they're scared and and the control is so complete
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:47.080]  including through their household income that they don't see a pathway to do
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:50.600]  something about it and and that's why it's so so
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:53.560]  important that we'd be free to talk about it which is why
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:56.760]  i'm a member in good standing in the alex jones fan club because
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:59.880]  you know you're leading the conversation and i think part of it is getting a
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:03.880]  critical amount of people to face you know this is really happening this is
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:06.680]  really going on and and we have the power to do
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:10.040]  something about it but we have to be prepared to talk about it we
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:13.800]  have to be prepared to face it and the reality is alex we have to be
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:18.520]  prepared to face our own financial and operational complicity
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:22.360]  i mean we've we've watched drugs coming into our neighborhood targeted our
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:26.040]  kids for 50 years and and you know we've
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:30.360]  let it go on and let's face it a lot of you know a lot of households in our
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:34.680]  community are financially dependent on killing our own kids
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:38.360]  you know and so well that was my next point i mean i'm sure you saw bloomberg
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:41.720]  and ap a few months ago uh we're one of the
[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:46.760]  biggest banks uh in the uh country um what
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:52.280]  wacovia admittedly had 360 plus billion dollars in just a
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:56.040]  three-year period of drug money and own the planes
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:43:01.480]  delivering it around i mean what more do we need i mean
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:04.520]  well what we need is we need a financially
[02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:08.520]  practical pathway out of the dependency on all this stuff
[02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:12.760]  and now it's very interesting when i when i realized how bad things were in
[02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:16.120]  1998 i said you know i have to come clean
[02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:20.040]  i have to get financially i have to withdraw and stop making money from
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:24.200]  the system and so i've tried as much as possible to withdraw so is you so as
[02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:27.000]  many others we need thousands and thousands of
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.960]  people to realize you know we don't have to go along
[02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:33.720]  another world is possible let's start to shift shift our money
[02:43:33.720 --> 02:43:38.600]  and time shift our attention get as put as many degrees of separation
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:41.560]  between you and the people are trying to kill you and let me throw a quick
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:44.680]  example out on this and get your take and we'll go to the phone calls
[02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:49.480]  if you go back 12 13 years ago or so no matter where you lived in the country it
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:52.440]  was almost impossible to find truly organic food
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:56.760]  but as people began to purchase it it built a market for it
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:01.080]  and so now you've got as much choice with organic as you do
[02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:04.120]  with the horrible poison stuff but the system comes in then
[02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:08.280]  to change the rules where they don't have to list that salmon
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:12.520]  is a cross species chimera clone or where they don't have to tell you
[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:16.600]  that some grapes are really gmo and i see that same thing now in wisconsin
[02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:19.960]  where they're saying you know what we're going to take even more money
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:23.240]  out of your paycheck and put it into pension and it'll run right down out of
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:26.280]  the hole into the ground they'll never get so i see them
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:29.480]  moving to seize everybody's paychecks homeland security's
[02:44:29.480 --> 02:44:32.760]  announcing they will control the paychecks everything will be wired
[02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:35.880]  through them you'll have to have a homeland security
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:38.760]  you know check on your deal to be able to have a job
[02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:42.680]  this is already happening so they know that people are going to figure out the
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:45.720]  emergency exit they're now moving to try to block them
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:49.240]  they know we could see with the financial system
[02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:52.920]  people withdrawing like they did from gmo and so they're trying to block those
[02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:56.920]  exits right but let me give you an example because ultimately i think they're
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:45:00.680]  going to fail um what you're watching are desperate
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:04.440]  measures by desperate people they're scared and and you
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:07.400]  you wouldn't be seeing the kind of things we're seeing if they weren't now i'm
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:11.480]  not uh you know i don't underestimate the resources
[02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:15.080]  they have because you you're you're literally looking at a group of people
[02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:19.240]  that have incredible technology and have essentially stolen and now control all
[02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:22.600]  the assets on the planet so i'm not saying that they're not
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:26.280]  incredibly incredibly financially powerful and they don't have with bank
[02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:31.720]  technology but the reality is um it it takes you know
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:35.880]  traditionally to run a civilization it takes an organizing principle
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:39.560]  and and it takes what i what the chinese refer to as the mandate of heaven and
[02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:43.880]  these folks clearly you know they don't have that and if anything the thing
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:46.520]  that's going to destroy them is they're going to kill each other because they
[02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:50.840]  they don't have they're not grounded in in a higher
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:55.000]  you know positive organizing principle so ultimately i just don't think it's
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.960]  going to work so all the evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good
[02:45:57.960 --> 02:46:02.120]  men and women do nothing we have to put out or our organizing principle
[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:05.880]  versus theirs and we're going to beat them if we stand up
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:09.800]  and take action incredible catherine austin fits let's go to some phone calls

[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:19.080]  dr ross and again i i watch glenbeck maybe once a month i watched
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:23.080]  dr ross maybe once a month i'm busy but i saw a piece when he had
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:26.440]  uh... mr smith on uh... what's his first name
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:31.000]  uh... he's the expert on gmo's uh... i've interviewed him
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  yeah yeah jeffrey smith he had him on and let him lay out the facts of gmo
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.520]  killing people i mean that shows how far we've come that
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:41.720]  beck has to talk about the new world order and that os
[02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:47.240]  can now talk bad about gmo on national tv and you're saying a pretty fair piece
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:50.920]  uh... and playing a clip for my show well that's amazing
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:54.840]  yeah i i was floored i mean he said it said at the top of the screen courtesy
[02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:58.680]  info wars dot com and i was thinking oh my goodness i mean you got
[02:47:58.680 --> 02:48:03.080]  fun airtime on there so i'm just i'm just thinking i'm hoping those people go
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:07.480]  and check it out but the the discussion the audience i mean everybody was
[02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:10.920]  just involved i hope you get a chance to see it well listen i gotta jump but i
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:13.880]  appreciate that call me uh... how exciting
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:19.240]  how exciting is that uh... that uh... that we're seeing things like that
[02:48:19.240 --> 02:48:22.760]  kathryn well what it means is they have to protect their channel
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:26.440]  in other words what you're watching is the mainstream
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:31.160]  will will blank it out until they're forced to itself interest again
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:34.120]  right well what's happening is they're losing market share
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:37.880]  so so they'll shift when they absolutely have to
[02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:40.760]  uh... and when they think they have enough control i mean i think they think
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:44.520]  with the food safety bill and the new usda regulations
[02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:47.640]  um... you know that that they have to shift this way
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:51.480]  and they need to kind of process the grief through the mainstream to get the
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:54.840]  channel but you know it's it's good that it's moving
[02:48:54.840 --> 02:49:00.200]  but it's still not you know you still have to shift the money
[02:49:00.200 --> 02:49:03.480]  you know interesting to shift the money it's not enough to shift the
[02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:07.000]  conversation you have to shift the money to but it starts first with the
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:10.920]  conversation absolutely use other chinese proverb journey of a thousand
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:13.880]  miles starts with a single step and you're taking us a lot of steps here
[02:49:13.880 --> 02:49:17.320]  kathryn jeff and iowa you're on the air
[02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:21.560]  yeah hi i would like to get both your takes on a defensive and an offensive
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:25.320]  economic strategy against the globalist one defensive
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:29.800]  let's pick a few regions or areas that have enough libertarianism and enough
[02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:34.680]  subsistence farming and hunting along with the cosmopolitan
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:39.960]  uh... city type environment to sustain us through the cracks that's coming say
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:43.400]  austin or new hampshire maybe the foothills of california
[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:47.720]  and put our money in there locally so we can survive with subsistence
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:51.160]  well there are already a lot of communities like that and uh...
[02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:54.440]  i'm my job is just to generally try to wake people up and let them know what's
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:56.840]  happening but yes these moves even if it's you and
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:49:59.560]  twenty friends that move into a general area
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:03.160]  and promise to support each other or you and your friends move outside the city
[02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:07.000]  i've now done that i mean i'm now doing what kathryn challenged me to do
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:12.120]  two years ago on air kathryn well i you know i think it is a great idea
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:16.360]  we encourage people to do circles but anytime you can get together with
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:20.520]  uh... like-minded people in your area or even by phone by network
[02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:24.200]  and start to talk about how you can shift your money to finance the strategic
[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:27.480]  resources you need whether it's energy or food it's a
[02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:32.840]  it's a wonderful thing to do because the reality is the way to have a resource
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:37.560]  is to finance it and you know or absolutely uh... jeff jeff that's a
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:39.800]  great idea uh... what's the other one
[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:45.160]  yeah the offensive one nonviolent siege of bill berg shut it down shut it down
[02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:49.000]  i agree bill berg coming up in a few months there should be a million people
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:52.600]  there not five hundred but we've gone from nine to five hundred

[02:54:50.600 --> 02:54:56.200]  yeah he's the creator of illuminati and my whole point behind that is is that i
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:55:00.440]  think i was born so you know expose some of this stuff too and my whole thing
[02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:03.000]  is i'm one uh you know i thought you said i's

[02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:16.040]  thing is i just want to um you know i've been
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:20.200]  riding around alana and they have you know cameras all over our they took our
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:23.480]  street lights down to install cameras you know every
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:28.040]  few hundred feet from each other but my whole point is i'm going to um
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:31.000]  ask why haven't we started a march or something yet
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:34.920]  i appreciate your call well i mean we're all atomized it's hard to get together
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:39.400]  we are starting a march in our own daily lives making decisions with the way we
[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:42.920]  spend money that will bring down the globalist catherine
[02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:46.760]  one of the one of my favorite books that i read in the last year is a book called
[02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:51.080]  prophetic imagination uh by a guy named walter brugman and
[02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:57.880]  and he talks alex about how uh the way moses brought down the empire was to
[02:55:57.880 --> 02:56:01.720]  to leave it in first and foremost in his mind and imagination
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:05.000]  to just persuade people that they don't have to go along
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:10.520]  and that they can withdraw and i think it's the same year um
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:13.640]  we need to we need to take it by to the system
[02:56:13.640 --> 02:56:18.600]  and and proceed to make other plans on our own so come out of her come out of
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:22.040]  babelon yeah just just you know and before you can
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:24.680]  leave a place you need to leave it in your mind and then you need to leave it
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:28.840]  in your pocketbook and you need to find other people who want to leave with you
[02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:32.680]  and and a lot of that's turning off television and that's why they're
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:36.360]  having to put some of the truth on tv to keep people tuned into all the other
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:39.160]  lies they lay well i would turn off your you know
[02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:42.520]  one of the things the three things you can all do in the next 30 days is turn
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:45.480]  off your tv you don't need any more entrainments of
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:49.000]  little programming eat fresh food the food system is killing us
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.720]  you've got to find local farmers and local food
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:56:56.280]  sources are learned to grow your own and and make sure you get fresh water so
[02:56:56.280 --> 02:56:59.400]  so and and for heaven's sakes get your money
[02:56:59.400 --> 02:57:03.080]  out of paper and out of out of the big bang well what you just said is so
[02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:05.560]  beautiful just getting our body straight and i'm
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:08.680]  trying to do that it's so hard to get off the coffee and all those
[02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:12.520]  type of things and and and the fattening food but just as you get more
[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:15.640]  sleep just as you i mean it makes everything clearer
[02:57:15.640 --> 02:57:18.920]  that's why the globalists try to poison the food and water they want us off
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:21.400]  balance the last seven months do you know what
[02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:24.600]  sugar futures are up in the last seven months
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:32.920]  88 percent so if you're not off sugar yet you're going to get off sugar
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:37.800]  you know so so really what we have you know look at what you have under your
[02:57:37.800 --> 02:57:41.000]  power and can do in the next 30 days to protect
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:44.440]  yourself and your family and the more you do that the more people who do that
[02:57:44.440 --> 02:57:47.880]  the more we stop being atomized and can connect and find each other
[02:57:47.880 --> 02:57:51.320]  and support alternative media and organizations yep
[02:57:51.320 --> 02:57:54.760]  and radio stations and people that tell the truth even if you don't have money
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:57:58.760]  spread the word about those this is how we're going to change the world
[02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:01.560]  i apologize to michael george sam ed and others
