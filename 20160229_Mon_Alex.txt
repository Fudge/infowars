[00:00.000 --> 00:12.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.520 --> 00:38.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.360 --> 00:43.880]  ladies and gentlemen it is the event that only happens every four years and
[00:43.880 --> 00:49.280]  I'm not talking about the presidential election of 2016 that only happens once
[00:49.280 --> 00:55.560]  but every four years it is leap year today it is leap day year and I think
[00:55.560 --> 00:59.600]  we might break down some of the history of that coming up today because it is so
[00:59.600 --> 01:05.360]  interesting to see how based on the Sun our entire planet our life and our
[01:05.360 --> 01:10.440]  culture is but this is the one day that comes around every four years it is a
[01:10.440 --> 01:16.520]  leap year and it is that day when they balance out the orbit of the earth every
[01:16.520 --> 01:23.200]  year the planet orbits the Sun in 365 days and one quarter day and so every
[01:23.200 --> 01:28.640]  four years they combine those quarters together to have the leap day from the
[01:28.640 --> 01:33.320]  leap year and here we are and it goes back to the Gregorian calendar and the
[01:33.320 --> 01:36.680]  Romans and right through when they changed the calendar again George
[01:36.680 --> 01:40.160]  Washington was born on my birthday February 11th so when they changed the
[01:40.160 --> 01:45.520]  calendar again at a leap year it moved up the day he was born four days so again
[01:45.520 --> 01:49.440]  it's all interesting little little factoids I kind of wish that George
[01:49.440 --> 01:52.880]  Washington's birthday was still on mine but don't worry Bert Reynolds has the
[01:52.880 --> 01:59.600]  same birthday so everything's okay and smokey in the bandit let's get serious we

[03:55.320 --> 03:59.800]  we're losing our humanity the press would have looked into it be the top
[03:59.800 --> 04:03.720]  story in America today we could do something about the dehumanization but
[04:03.720 --> 04:08.360]  no there's the one fake environmental issue that we're supposed to all care
[04:08.360 --> 04:14.920]  about and then obsess on that all day and not the thousands of real crisis level
[04:14.920 --> 04:23.800]  issues crisis level issues like humanoids gestating in the bellies of
[04:23.800 --> 04:32.000]  cows pigs sheep in the uterus in the utero that's just one egregious thing
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.880]  imagine if he was bold imagine if he was outside the box what a shame and
[04:39.880 --> 04:44.360]  Buckley hung out with him just last year I need to call Buckley in here and to
[04:44.360 --> 04:47.720]  slap him around a little bit I'm joking I said he was all we were just hanging

[04:56.760 --> 04:59.080]  right thing
[05:00.240 --> 05:04.640]  shock poll Hillary could lose the Trump in Democratic New York that's right
[05:04.640 --> 05:08.320]  polling data shows Hillary Clinton could lose New York a Democratic stronghold to
[05:08.320 --> 05:12.720]  Donald Trump as the GOP frontrunner gains broad support across party lines the
[05:12.720 --> 05:16.320]  poll results from Democratic and Republican legislative races have
[05:16.320 --> 05:19.040]  surprised virtually all the leading Democrats who have endorsed Clinton
[05:19.040 --> 05:22.640]  while also energizing GOP leaders who are now warming up the Trump and the
[05:22.640 --> 05:25.760]  results found that Clinton has higher negative ratings with New York voters
[05:25.760 --> 05:29.440]  and Trump despite the fact she served as a New York senator some of the polls
[05:29.440 --> 05:33.000]  also found much stronger loyalty amongst Trump's potential voters and along
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.920]  Clinton's a finding that mirrors the record-breaking GOP turnouts and state
[05:36.920 --> 05:40.960]  primaries so far in other words Trump supporters will actually show up to the
[05:40.960 --> 05:45.000]  voting booth this past weekend Alabama senator Jeff Sessions endorsed Trump
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.600]  during a campaign rally during the rally sessions lashed out at the trans

[08:45.600 --> 08:49.440]  frankly I take either one of those over Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders and I
[08:49.440 --> 08:52.560]  don't like seeing the infighting but it's got to happen it's the electoral
[08:52.560 --> 08:58.680]  process one of the most honorable US senators not just living but that I've
[08:58.680 --> 09:04.480]  known of is senator sessions who has tried to block the TPP tried to block
[09:04.480 --> 09:10.360]  carbon taxes been censored or attempted to be censored by the Senate when they
[09:10.360 --> 09:14.400]  try to keep immigration open border bills secret which is really North
[09:14.400 --> 09:18.240]  American Union by stealth integration according to the TPP's owned admissions
[09:18.240 --> 09:23.480]  and the NA use owned admissions that's North American Union by the way and to
[09:23.480 --> 09:28.600]  have his endorsement for Donald Trump yesterday in Alabama to a crowd of 35
[09:28.600 --> 09:33.880]  thousand inside the gates another 10,000 that couldn't get in that's 45,000
[09:33.880 --> 09:38.720]  estimated by the Alabama State Police and the Associated Press the fact that
[09:38.720 --> 09:42.280]  he's come out and endorsed and his speech talk about making America great
[09:42.280 --> 09:46.840]  again and in other speeches saying it's time to crush the oligarchs and the
[09:46.840 --> 09:52.200]  offshore interest this is seismic and in a moment I'm gonna break down the
[09:52.200 --> 09:57.560]  secret to defeating the globalist the absolute Excalibur the black arrow that
[09:57.560 --> 10:08.160]  can fell the great dragon smog let's play the club Wow what a crowd this is I
[10:10.160 --> 10:17.720]  told Donald Trump this isn't a campaign this is a movement look at that what's
[10:17.720 --> 10:29.120]  happening the American people are not happy with their government so some say
[10:29.120 --> 10:33.880]  you know you just need to let the people calm down a little bit and they'll
[10:33.880 --> 10:42.400]  forget it and let it all go should we forget it no we should not there is an
[10:42.400 --> 10:57.600]  opportunity this year Tuesday and we have the opportunity we we have an
[10:57.600 --> 11:02.920]  opportunity Tuesday and then it goes on to say to make America great again and
[11:02.920 --> 11:07.880]  to crush the oligarchs and puts the puts the red make America great again red
[11:07.880 --> 11:14.320]  hat on we'll play the full clip later in the broadcast but to have a senator
[11:14.320 --> 11:18.520]  talking about crushing the oligarchs that have stolen our country and make
[11:18.520 --> 11:22.480]  America great again really scares the power structure and here's the big
[11:22.480 --> 11:27.520]  secret I've talked about it a lot but we need to hammer it
[11:27.520 --> 11:36.480]  America and Europe and Latin America Asia you name it have all been
[11:36.480 --> 11:44.000]  conquered by multinational above-the-law tax exempt Fortune 100 companies that
[11:44.000 --> 11:58.000]  are establishing planetary world government where they themselves are exempt
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.200]  from taxes and regulations he went on I'm reading the transcript to say we will
[12:03.200 --> 12:09.280]  take back control from quote the masters of the universe the oligarchs this is the
[12:09.280 --> 12:14.000]  real essence of defeating these people we really have been taken over by
[12:14.000 --> 12:20.160]  infiltration we really are seeing the European Union the North American Union
[12:20.160 --> 12:26.120]  and now the Asian Pacific Union merging together
[12:31.240 --> 12:36.600]  outside of law with traders in our own governments transferring power out of the
[12:36.600 --> 12:40.920]  United States out of Europe out of countries like Germany and Brazil and
[12:40.920 --> 12:45.480]  Canada it's all being put into a world corporate government and to have
[12:45.480 --> 12:48.960]  sessions talking about oligarchs and Trump talking about masters of the
[12:48.960 --> 12:53.040]  universe and how we're taking back control from the technocrats it's game
[12:53.040 --> 12:56.400]  over because when you point out the politicians are bought and paid for you
[12:56.400 --> 13:01.440]  actually point out who the real special interests are and how they made deals to
[13:01.440 --> 13:04.800]  transfer our entire industry the biggest industrial industry in the world and
[13:04.800 --> 13:10.000]  sold it off to communist China and then they made deals to control the profits
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.960]  off of it after they sold it to China and using those poor Chinese as literal
[13:15.960 --> 13:23.760]  slaves not improving their lives forcing 500 million rural people off the land
[13:23.760 --> 13:29.040]  in the compact cities to chain their children up on light poles and fences
[13:29.040 --> 13:34.200]  and they get one meal a day and daddy comes out of the factory after 17
[13:34.200 --> 13:41.440]  hours working and they live in a tent with mommy and the and the three-year-old
[13:41.440 --> 13:47.480]  eating one meal a day with toxic waste dump directly in the river how will we
[13:47.480 --> 13:52.560]  compete with the regulations and the EEOC and the political correctness and all
[13:52.560 --> 13:57.680]  the nitting against something like that
[13:58.280 --> 14:04.000]  China is the economic engine to undercut everything blowout world economies
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.560]  it is not free market it is a race to the bottom a giant sucking sound to
[14:08.560 --> 14:15.080]  quote Ross Perot who was dead on right regardless what you think happened in
[14:15.080 --> 14:20.240]  that election Ross Perot was dead on right he said listen here within one
[14:20.240 --> 14:24.040]  year of Canada opening up their border the United States not Mexico they went
[14:24.040 --> 14:29.760]  from the average $27 an hour for a factory worker to $15 an hour that's
[14:29.760 --> 14:35.600]  because our average was $15 an hour Mexico is under a dollar an hour if you
[14:35.600 --> 14:40.880]  look at those metrics we're gonna see our wages dropped to $10 or lower an
[14:40.880 --> 14:45.480]  hour and with all the regulations here in the United States there won't be any
[14:45.480 --> 14:52.160]  jobs they'll leave you're about to see a giant second sound an old door went
[14:52.160 --> 14:58.640]  haha this is a good deal Larry remember those clips we played many times you're
[14:58.640 --> 15:05.200]  gonna see your money go up and so the very people that have sold globalism
[15:05.200 --> 15:09.800]  the very people that have engineered this calamity are now selling us on the
[15:09.800 --> 15:14.840]  next phase and that's why Donald Trump is such a no-brainer to see the
[15:14.840 --> 15:18.600]  communist Chinese government come out against him but Sente Fox come out
[15:18.600 --> 15:21.680]  against him the British government come out and say we made banning from
[15:21.680 --> 15:26.440]  traveling here and you know shut down his golf course in Scotland the
[15:26.440 --> 15:31.000]  Democratic Party Obama saying he's ineligible as if he's God Hillary the
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.400]  Republican leadership the Koch brothers $75 million last Thursday in that
[15:35.400 --> 15:42.960]  Republican meeting in New York we now know to target Donald Trump he comes out
[15:42.960 --> 15:46.000]  against vaccines and says they're dangerous he comes out and exposes
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.200]  Saudi Arabia in 9-11 in the bushes in the Clintons he comes out and exposes an
[15:50.200 --> 15:53.760]  after and get he comes out and exposes the private Federal Reserve I mean what
[15:53.760 --> 15:57.280]  more do you want
[15:59.240 --> 16:04.640]  it's incredible and then people sit back and they go oh I'm gonna do what the
[16:04.640 --> 16:10.160]  mainstream media says I'm gonna play it safe and say I don't like Trump when
[16:10.160 --> 16:15.000]  he's the people champion is he perfect is he an angel could he betray us
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.720]  absolutely but we know this isn't a put-on by the establishment they are
[16:18.720 --> 16:22.440]  pulling out the stops and remember Roger Stone a few months ago he said over and
[16:22.440 --> 16:26.280]  over again they're gonna claim mafia ties they're gonna claim his racist all
[16:26.280 --> 16:30.320]  the rest of it and sure enough I was watching Fox this morning and then I
[16:30.320 --> 16:34.400]  tuned to CNN and MSNBC because I just went ahead and did elliptical for about
[16:34.400 --> 16:40.080]  30 minutes then worked out and on every channel they had this town hall
[16:40.080 --> 16:44.760]  columnist on on Fox and the other two women on there and they're sitting there
[16:44.760 --> 16:48.640]  and they all go well it's well known he has mafia connections it's well known in
[16:48.640 --> 16:55.160]  the press and law enforcement knows and books no sources no facts no nothing we
[16:55.160 --> 16:59.800]  looked it up one guy in New York City over a decade ago at some construction
[16:59.800 --> 17:03.720]  site some company they used later got indicted for something totally separate
[17:03.720 --> 17:07.920]  I mean you deal with tens of thousands of people folks are gonna get indicted
[17:07.920 --> 17:14.040]  around you that's part of business my gosh I've done auto parts and repair
[17:14.040 --> 17:17.640]  shops where they claim some employee dumped one thing oil down the drain so
[17:17.640 --> 17:22.620]  they indict the owner as if they knew this is a hysterical attack on Donald
[17:22.620 --> 17:31.160]  Trump absolutely totally and completely hysterical at every front and on every
[17:31.160 --> 17:39.560]  level the Financial Times of London globally it's like the New York Times
[17:39.560 --> 17:45.880]  it's the mouthpiece of the elite the New York Times is owned by the Mexican
[17:45.880 --> 17:53.520]  Kingpin as crooked as a dog's back leg Carlos Slim who by the way isn't even
[17:53.520 --> 17:58.400]  Mexican just gets weird another one of the carpetbaggers that you know runs
[17:58.400 --> 18:04.760]  Mexico and he owns the New York Times is his own personal propaganda piece got

[23:07.800 --> 23:12.400]  involves FEMA now revealing FEMA's plaque at Lami and hot water but I think
[23:12.400 --> 23:17.080]  you deserve to know exactly what they're doing I just created a free video
[23:17.080 --> 23:22.800]  presentation at 123 FEMA dot com that exposes the truth be warned it's really
[23:22.800 --> 23:29.040]  disturbing because the fact is FEMA must know something we don't go to 123
[23:29.040 --> 23:33.000]  FEMA dot com to see the number one item to hoard and why supplies of this

[24:07.520 --> 24:12.000]  business insider has the email put out after the senator sessions endorsement
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.760]  Alabama yesterday where they point out that the events of history have aligned
[24:16.760 --> 24:21.240]  to give the people the fleeting chance to bust up the oligarchy to take back
[24:21.240 --> 24:24.600]  control from the masters of the universe and return it to the good and
[24:24.600 --> 24:28.920]  decent patriotic citizens of the United States you see Trump understands that we
[24:28.920 --> 24:32.240]  have been hijacked by multinationals they're not about free market they're
[24:32.240 --> 24:35.680]  about shutting down markets and controlling markets they're monopoly
[24:35.680 --> 24:40.320]  meant and to have senator sessions come out again is a crushing blow to Ted
[24:40.320 --> 24:45.840]  Cruz and I don't like bashing Ted Cruz I like Ted Cruz but Republicans need to
[24:45.840 --> 24:52.000]  know he's not getting elected president this go around and the fact that he the
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.920]  elite are getting behind Rubio and the Koch brothers are getting behind Rubio
[24:55.920 --> 25:01.920]  is is someone of an endorsement for Cruz but they're also even more against
[25:01.920 --> 25:05.720]  Trump which is an endorsement for Trump and he's just not gonna get it Trump is
[25:05.720 --> 25:10.760]  going to get the nomination now they're trying to again do this trick and this is
[25:10.760 --> 25:14.080]  a famous trick that's happened a lot where they ask you a question and fade
[25:14.080 --> 25:18.880]  down your earpiece on multiple TV shows over a decade ago we pulled up the
[25:18.880 --> 25:23.120]  transcripts gonna do a special report on this Trump said I don't like racist I'm
[25:23.120 --> 25:27.840]  all inclusive I love everybody when he was asked about why he got out of the
[25:27.840 --> 25:31.880]  reform party and he said it's because they have people like the KKK member in
[25:31.880 --> 25:34.760]  fact they can pull the quotes up on screen Trump said he got out of the
[25:34.760 --> 25:39.680]  reform party because because David Duke was in it then during this interview
[25:39.680 --> 25:44.360]  he's that they say they say David Duke and other groups he says excuse me what
[25:44.360 --> 25:47.840]  groups who you talking about and now Trump says they turned down his earpiece
[25:47.840 --> 25:52.320]  folks as soon as I heard that I went wait a minute that's a famous tactic
[25:52.320 --> 25:59.040]  they've done other candidates like this before and the reason I believe Trump is
[25:59.040 --> 26:05.800]  he's decried him repeatedly and got out of a political party because David Duke
[26:05.800 --> 26:10.240]  was involved so why would he now not do that this is the type of games they
[26:10.240 --> 26:14.880]  play and then he comes out and clarifies and says no on Twitter and Facebook and
[26:14.880 --> 26:18.000]  in a statement that he doesn't agree with you know hating different groups of
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.200]  people and doesn't agree with David Duke and the media doesn't care it's why
[26:22.200 --> 26:27.120]  didn't he put down David Duke why didn't he put down David Duke this is the type
[26:27.120 --> 26:34.400]  of mind game that they're playing because they're so incredibly desperate I had
[26:34.400 --> 26:38.840]  David Duke on and I said eugenics is targeting everyone all of our children
[26:38.840 --> 26:42.640]  shouldn't we deal with the fact that there's fluoride in the water Gardasil
[26:42.640 --> 26:45.920]  shots there's a globalist agenda targeting everybody and he didn't want to
[26:45.920 --> 26:49.320]  hear it the one way we're going to defeat the New World Order is coming
[26:49.320 --> 26:55.800]  together against the globalist takeover so he's in a remote office doing an
[26:55.800 --> 27:02.760]  interview they fade down the audio he says he couldn't hear a classic setup
[27:02.760 --> 27:06.120]  in fact I want my riders because I remember a bunch of cases of this in
[27:06.120 --> 27:09.960]  other campaigns the last eight years the same thing would happen when they
[27:09.960 --> 27:15.000]  would ask him racist questions and they would say they faded down my earpiece and
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.360]  of course that happens naturally sometimes too in studios because you'll
[27:18.360 --> 27:22.000]  have a feed the audio will cut many times up in on national TV and the audio
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.960]  cuts out just randomly or the other day somebody called in and said why don't you
[27:26.960 --> 27:31.640]  stand up for this political prisoner you know out with the Bundy situation in
[27:31.640 --> 27:36.160]  Oregon and they cut my ear to tell me we have our guests on the line because they
[27:36.160 --> 27:40.360]  you know give me messages and then I came back and said who are you talking
[27:40.360 --> 27:44.800]  about and then people are like well you just said the name to you why didn't you
[27:44.800 --> 27:50.480]  hear it that's what it's like to have audio feeds and in video audio feeds and
[27:50.480 --> 27:54.160]  people talking in your ear this is the type of games they play the point is
[27:54.160 --> 28:00.040]  Donald Trump has to be judges who he is and he has a history of hiring people
[28:00.040 --> 28:04.400]  across the board of promoting minorities women you name it and again it's more
[28:04.400 --> 28:09.400]  of this complete racially based politics garbage such as dumb people down
[28:09.400 --> 28:14.280]  that he's with David Duke and quite frankly I don't even want to sit here
[28:14.280 --> 28:18.040]  and bash David Duke I disagree with him on many fronts but it's not fair when
[28:18.040 --> 28:22.000]  Metsha and La Raza and the new Black Panther Party and the Democratic Party
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.680]  and MSNBC are more racist in their rhetoric than David Duke more
[28:26.680 --> 28:31.680]  divisional they really are than what David Duke spent the last 20-30 years
[28:31.680 --> 28:36.400]  I have followed you know his work I've read his book I mean I've read the wide
[28:36.400 --> 28:39.680]  spectrum of books I've read Hitler's book doesn't mean I agree with him might
[28:39.680 --> 28:45.000]  come from my struggle and the David Duke of the day is different than the David
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.440]  Duke of 30 years ago but I mean really I'm tired of the obsession over it all
[28:49.440 --> 28:53.680]  day and quite frankly he does point out things that are true he goes hey I'm
[28:53.680 --> 28:57.920]  saying less stuff than MSNBC Al Sharpe from the Democratic Party who are a
[28:57.920 --> 29:02.560]  bunch of race-baiting anti-white trash and they are and I absolutely don't
[29:02.560 --> 29:07.240]  like them they are horrible people they are worse than David Duke but you know
[29:07.240 --> 29:15.200]  what David Duke what you say is hateful and divisional as well in some cases I
[29:15.200 --> 29:20.280]  mean you have softened your stance a lot but it doesn't matter you are the kiss
[29:20.280 --> 29:25.240]  of political death for Donald Trump and so I have fun being all over the news
[29:25.240 --> 29:29.840]  endorsing him and I hope it gets you some more attention because I know you're
[29:29.840 --> 29:33.240]  a successful fellow so whatever and then now we'll get Hillary in if they're
[29:33.240 --> 29:36.360]  successful with this and that'll be your big accomplishment is making sure the
[29:36.360 --> 29:40.160]  country went down and I'm not saying that's what you want David Duke but you
[29:40.160 --> 29:45.480]  know I'm just glad Donald Trump has come out and basically condemned you because
[29:45.480 --> 29:50.480]  a lot of what you've had to say is abominable we're on the March the Empire's
[29:50.480 --> 29:57.200]  on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[34:03.880 --> 34:08.040]  these anti-gun pieces on there now I don't know what they think they're
[34:08.040 --> 34:11.160]  doing over there but I guess they're just carrying out the globalist program
[34:11.160 --> 34:18.760]  the Trump effect Fox News channel's brand takes 50% hit among Republicans that is
[34:18.760 --> 34:22.200]  their main viewer group I mean but it doesn't matter they're just committed
[34:22.200 --> 34:28.000]  that they've done this for months they are committed because it's just a
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.360]  property to keep conservatives on the reservation look the rest of Fox
[34:33.360 --> 34:38.680]  programming it's anti-family anti-father figure global warming carbon tax
[34:38.680 --> 34:46.520]  baloney rupert murdoch supports Hillary Clinton now that doesn't mean a lot of
[34:46.520 --> 34:52.800]  people at Fox News aren't patriots and don't care about the country but you
[34:52.800 --> 34:56.920]  got Fox News the Chinese government the Mexican government criminal elements in
[34:56.920 --> 35:00.160]  the US government the British government the Bilderberg group the
[35:00.160 --> 35:05.640]  Financial Times of London the New York Times the Economist the Debo's group and
[35:05.640 --> 35:10.720]  every other elitist confab the council on farm relations came out in a hissy fit
[35:10.720 --> 35:16.160]  because no no no we run America we're sucking it dry we hold it hostage you're
[35:16.160 --> 35:21.640]  not gonna get in there Donald Trump no you're not we're gonna get back into
[35:21.640 --> 35:28.400]  this in a moment but before I go any further I was thinking about it this
[35:28.400 --> 35:33.640]  morning when I was doing an errand on the way to work and I was in a grocery
[35:33.640 --> 35:41.120]  store and a fella ran up to me and he was in good shape look like he'd been
[35:41.120 --> 35:46.520]  recently exercising he was in workout clothes and he goes man I have been on
[35:46.520 --> 35:59.600]  nason iodine X2 for two weeks and he said I have so much more energy and but
[35:59.600 --> 36:04.120]  I do feel like I'm detoxing he goes man this stuff is so serious he goes you know
[36:04.120 --> 36:07.840]  I wake up kind of in the sweats and have a headache and he goes am I taking too
[36:07.840 --> 36:10.720]  much I said how much you taking he goes a couple drops in water every day and
[36:10.720 --> 36:14.600]  I said well maybe back off a little bit because if you're already really toxic
[36:14.600 --> 36:18.600]  even if you're an exercise person it starts pulling out the toxins it does
[36:18.600 --> 36:22.120]  stuff to the thyroid that gets filled with the bad halogens the bromine the
[36:22.120 --> 36:26.840]  broide the chlorine the fluoride I said this is serious stuff this isn't your
[36:26.840 --> 36:30.840]  normal bound garbage iodine that you don't really absorb this is the real
[36:30.840 --> 36:37.040]  deal the strongest purists you can find 99999 it's really beyond that but the
[36:37.040 --> 36:43.400]  spectrometers you know they never certify something 100% the stuff that we
[36:43.400 --> 36:49.280]  have you have to go through the DEA to have a certification because you can
[36:49.280 --> 36:53.040]  obviously have you have the raw stuff it could be used as a precursor for you
[36:53.040 --> 36:59.000]  know making methamphetamine and stuff like that it's one of the precursors it
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.680]  doesn't have that effect on you it's just needed in the manufacturing it would
[37:02.680 --> 37:06.080]  jump their hoops other manufacturers don't they just get seaweed based stuff
[37:06.080 --> 37:10.320]  that's plant derived isn't pure and it's bound with a bunch of other stuff it's
[37:10.320 --> 37:16.560]  in the ocean this stuff is unbelievable and I just thought what a game changer
[37:16.560 --> 37:22.760]  that people are so deficient in it and then I was exercising more before three
[37:22.760 --> 37:26.600]  years ago and not losing the weight I'd lost 25 pounds or so but to lose the
[37:26.600 --> 37:30.400]  next 30 or so it was x2 it was super mill vitality super mill sold out right

[40:06.080 --> 40:09.480]  doing the best job we can speaking of not being perfect like Senator Sessions
[40:09.480 --> 40:12.960]  said to him in a speech Donald Trump's not perfect none of us are but he's the
[40:12.960 --> 40:16.760]  real deal and that's why I'm behind him he puts on the red hat that says I'll
[40:16.760 --> 40:22.720]  make America great again here it is Senator Sessions clip that I was going
[40:22.720 --> 40:27.480]  to play earlier and then as soon as we get that clip we will play the senator
[40:27.480 --> 40:34.920]  Sessions clip from that point he is committed to leading this country in an
[40:34.920 --> 40:42.280]  effective way you know nobody is perfect we can't have everything can we Mr.
[40:42.280 --> 40:47.720]  Trump but I can tell you one thing I think at this time in my opinion my
[40:47.720 --> 40:55.360]  best judgment at this time in American history we need to make America great
[40:55.360 --> 41:05.000]  again you know I'm gonna come out with a hat that's the same design but royal
[41:05.000 --> 41:14.440]  blue this is gonna say make America free again all right all right folks let's
[41:14.440 --> 41:19.000]  get back into the Donald Trump situation I want to get into the other world
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.800]  news like White House wants an increase in Syrian refugees that's already
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.680]  happened they're just announcing it to you there's a formula here US military
[41:26.680 --> 41:30.080]  successfully installs brain modems in animals are they're already doing it to
[41:30.080 --> 41:34.600]  humans that's actually in MIT and other publications we're gonna get into the
[41:34.600 --> 41:40.520]  whole Trump situation and more Wayne Madsen's report on Rubio and being
[41:40.520 --> 41:44.720]  arrested in that park at night with another man and like so many other
[41:44.720 --> 41:50.680]  Republicans are and Democrats has now made the National Enquirer Newsweek is
[41:50.680 --> 41:55.360]  attacked yours truly and others I ran with Madsen's reports the last few
[41:55.360 --> 42:01.680]  months because I found Madsen to be really really you know a real reporter
[42:01.680 --> 42:05.120]  actually goes out and knows what he's talking about he doesn't make stuff up
[42:05.120 --> 42:09.960]  and he didn't say Marco Rubio was doing this he got arrested with a man by
[42:09.960 --> 42:14.200]  bathroom at a park at night and the guy he got arrested with ended up being a
[42:14.200 --> 42:23.040]  guy that ran a house that shot gay porn and porn cams and other stuff so you
[42:23.040 --> 42:25.600]  know it's like Barney Frank living in the house that's running an underage
[42:25.600 --> 42:30.040]  male brothel with 14 and 15 year old kids they were about to indict him he went
[42:30.040 --> 42:34.080]  on the house floor and he said this is famous clip we can pull it up he said
[42:34.080 --> 42:40.560]  if you go after me everybody goes down and you ask yourself why is it so many
[42:40.560 --> 42:43.160]  Catholic priests turn out to be pedophiles why is it so many members of
[42:43.160 --> 42:49.080]  Congress to are there really that many pedophiles in society no in fact they've
[42:49.080 --> 42:54.920]  done big university studies less than one half of 1% of people are attracted to
[42:54.920 --> 42:59.000]  prepubescent folks now they call pedophilia you know being attracted to a
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.520]  16 year old girl if you're 18 and then they indict you that's not that's not
[43:03.520 --> 43:07.440]  pedophilia of course those are the easy ones most of the prosecutions are some
[43:07.440 --> 43:11.560]  19 or 18 year old guy who was a high school senior when another girl was a
[43:11.560 --> 43:16.960]  freshman he knows her been dating her the whole time he gets out of high school
[43:16.960 --> 43:22.680]  he still date her when she's a sophomore or a junior and then he goes to jail so
[43:22.680 --> 43:26.120]  that's not pedophilia and so the pedophiles try to push stuff saying it's
[43:26.120 --> 43:29.800]  unfair it's unfair Europe and other is want to go down to like age 10 or 11 no
[43:29.800 --> 43:37.560]  that's pedophilia but teaching all this garbage in schools is as well targeting
[43:37.560 --> 43:44.680]  and sexualizing children so it's all all super super bad news and it's a cult
[43:44.680 --> 43:51.000]  whether it's Boys Town or whether it's Penn State or or or any of these places
[43:51.000 --> 43:56.800]  pedophiles know that that's a crime almost too big to fail when it's in
[43:56.800 --> 44:01.120]  government and so if they can get in and get other people in they recruit their
[44:01.120 --> 44:08.040]  own people as a cult in to take over government now that's what institutions
[44:08.040 --> 44:12.520]  and groups that aren't cults do you know the Irish felt like they were mistreated
[44:12.520 --> 44:15.120]  and stuff and they weren't a lot of areas so they started migrating to certain
[44:15.120 --> 44:18.880]  areas electing their own people and then basically creating police departments
[44:18.880 --> 44:23.640]  that were almost exclusively Irish you know you've seen the Mormons that are
[44:23.640 --> 44:27.200]  less than 1% of the population and they've got people all over the house
[44:27.200 --> 44:34.520]  all over the Senate something like 20% FBI agents NSA Mormons and the
[44:34.520 --> 44:37.400]  grassroots Mormons seem to be really conservative patriotic great people I
[44:37.400 --> 44:41.200]  wonder why so many others are so liberal you know when it comes to the Senate in
[44:41.200 --> 44:46.080]  the house and you know that's a and Harry Reid and or in hatch and all these
[44:46.080 --> 44:52.720]  other people I'm not getting off on a jag about Mormons because I found the
[44:52.720 --> 44:55.480]  grassroots Mormons are some are probably the most patriotic group out
[44:55.480 --> 44:58.920]  there where what's going on but but it is kind of a paradox I want to ask
[44:58.920 --> 45:02.600]  Joel Scousen who's a senior Mormon sometime about how he deals with this
[45:02.600 --> 45:09.600]  paradox but it just shows how groups try to get in to secure that they won't
[45:09.600 --> 45:14.200]  be persecuted and then they end up taking over well with the case of the
[45:14.200 --> 45:19.000]  pedophiles that is a cult and we're dealing with a pedophile cult worldwide
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.800]  so I don't think they're in batch the Catholics the pedophile cults took them over and
[45:22.800 --> 45:26.960]  the pedophile cults will take your society your school your police
[45:26.960 --> 45:31.280]  department over if they can too they're one of the most evil insidious groups and
[45:31.280 --> 45:37.360]  now they've got sexualization of children sold in the name of openness in the
[45:37.360 --> 45:42.040]  name of political correctness in the name of not hurting people's feelings to
[45:42.040 --> 45:45.120]  have them indoctrinate your five-year-olds about transgender gay
[45:45.120 --> 45:51.520]  straight all these sexual acts that is outrageous I mean if you if you or
[45:51.520 --> 45:54.960]  somebody else walked up to a kid in the grocery store sort of talking to them
[45:54.960 --> 46:00.080]  about sex at age five you'd be arrested for indecency with a child and trying
[46:00.080 --> 46:05.040]  to exploit a child and all the rest of it you should be but when the state does
[46:05.040 --> 46:10.800]  it in plain view boldly look how far they've already gotten now there is a
[46:10.800 --> 46:13.760]  big backlash people like Melissa Harris Perry saying your kids along the state
[46:13.760 --> 46:17.720]  and she's on like four or five shows on panels every day had her own show on the
[46:17.720 --> 46:21.840]  weekend it got preemptive for the political season that always happens she
[46:21.840 --> 46:28.360]  said oh it's racist it you know at the parent company so she's gone this is the
[46:28.360 --> 46:37.360]  the the smoke in your own dope ship on your shoulder mindset now speaking of
[46:37.360 --> 46:42.160]  that let's get back to David Duke here in a moment but first I wanted to play a
[46:42.160 --> 46:44.840]  clip of Lewis Farrakhan you know a month ago I did a big groundbreaking
[46:44.840 --> 46:48.320]  interview with him I wanted to try to stop race war I wanted him to clarify
[46:48.320 --> 46:52.240]  his his earlier comments about white devils and he said look I've grown a
[46:52.240 --> 46:56.960]  lot and our people been persecuted a lot but I see the globalist want to bring
[46:56.960 --> 47:00.200]  down America now and I see they're bringing in radical Muslims to demonize
[47:00.200 --> 47:04.320]  all Muslims we need to stop all Muslim integration immigration and till they're
[47:04.320 --> 47:08.960]  at least vetting them Trump is right and he basically told me in private he
[47:08.960 --> 47:18.480]  likes Trump and then pretty much said it in person you know on video he went 90
[47:18.480 --> 47:22.280]  percent of that way there and people say wow who wants Farrakhan's endorsement the
[47:22.280 --> 47:27.440]  point is Trump's reaching out people at that level and people like Farrakhan get
[47:27.440 --> 47:30.600]  it he's actually addressing black people saying I will try to give you jobs I
[47:30.600 --> 47:33.680]  will try to make America great again I know you want to work I know you're a
[47:33.680 --> 47:38.240]  good people Obama doesn't even visit the black communities and so Farrakhan has
[47:38.240 --> 47:42.360]  come out against Hillary saying don't believe that devil and you will talk
[47:42.360 --> 47:46.400]  about it because he knows she's the one that ran Libya you talk about killing
[47:46.400 --> 47:50.200]  millions of people in Africa millions more died a year because Libya was
[47:50.200 --> 47:56.280]  sustaining all of Africa with with with key money actually building
[47:56.280 --> 48:02.000]  infrastructure and wells and roads and and aquifer access and all of Africa is
[48:02.000 --> 48:10.280]  just imploding right now and Gaddafi was just an angel compared to our leaders
[48:10.280 --> 48:15.360]  I mean I hate to even talk like that but it's just true he stood up to the last
[48:15.360 --> 48:19.080]  for decades he got blamed for much stuff he didn't do he lived in a modest house
[48:19.080 --> 48:22.040]  with a little wall around it he actually took the resources of the country and
[48:22.040 --> 48:25.920]  deployed it to everybody he had women in college and women were free they put
[48:25.920 --> 48:29.680]  the radicals jihadis into you know engaging all that evil and they went
[48:29.680 --> 48:32.920]  in and killed him and now it's a failed state they go oh Hillary screwed up in
[48:32.920 --> 48:36.640]  the New York Times well she didn't screw up mission accomplished a failed state
[48:36.640 --> 48:41.440]  they want America to be a failed state here's Lois Farrakhan how many of you
[48:41.440 --> 48:50.440]  voting for Hillary you don't have to raise your hands I do not blame you for
[48:50.440 --> 49:09.160]  wanting a female president but that's a wicked woman
[49:09.160 --> 49:16.920]  now listen you can vote for her but vote for her with knowledge she can be
[49:16.920 --> 49:28.520]  sweet but so can you and you know when you sweet but playing a game all of a
[49:28.520 --> 49:38.560]  sudden she know about Trevon Martin all of a sudden the boy been dead nearly two
[49:38.560 --> 49:49.560]  years now she's talking about him like she met the mother and all white people
[49:49.560 --> 50:01.240]  this is Satan you fall for that crap most of you that went to jail for having a
[50:01.240 --> 50:09.840]  little blunt in your pocket they arranged that the Clintons that's right
[50:09.840 --> 50:16.040]  they're the ones with the mandatory sentencing mass incarceration came about
[50:16.040 --> 50:20.200]  under the Clintons and they call black people super predators yeah you put them
[50:20.200 --> 50:25.960]  all in jail they're gonna come out predators don't forget that they call
[50:25.960 --> 50:36.120]  my young gang bangers super predators that need to be made to heal and black

[54:35.920 --> 54:40.440]  Lewis Farrakhan saying he likes Donald Trump over Hillary and you see the full
[54:40.440 --> 54:44.480]  interview in info wars.com it's a two-hour interview with Lewis Farrakhan a
[54:44.480 --> 54:49.960]  month and a half ago but this is bigger than Donald Trump it's a teaching
[54:49.960 --> 54:57.400]  experience a teachable moment as they say Donald Trump in the New York Times
[54:57.400 --> 55:05.760]  and Donald Trump on television in 2000 got out of the reform party and refused
[55:05.760 --> 55:12.040]  their nomination here's the New York Times reform bid said to be no go for
[55:12.040 --> 55:19.160]  Trump on his own he came out and said David Duke and the Klan are now
[55:19.160 --> 55:23.280]  involved and that is not something I want to be associated with I don't
[55:23.280 --> 55:28.800]  support that you know read his quotes it now includes Klansman Mr. Duke a Neo
[55:28.800 --> 55:34.720]  Nazi and a communist and that was kind of mean to say Neo Nazi Mr. Buchanan
[55:34.720 --> 55:41.200]  is not a neo-nazi and a communist and it goes on so he's even bashing Buchanan
[55:41.200 --> 55:48.200]  which I don't like that's a meatiest bull about that Buchanan has done
[55:48.200 --> 55:53.200]  basically what people have done the research have done like Oliver Stone
[55:53.200 --> 55:59.120]  and his history piece about yeah Hitler was bad and so were we our own big banks
[55:59.120 --> 56:03.120]  and people finance team told him to invade these countries shut him up and
[56:03.120 --> 56:08.040]  we couldn't even bomb the Ford and GM factories it's called opal factories for
[56:08.040 --> 56:14.240]  GM overseas and of course stones made that new a few years ago hit series on
[56:14.240 --> 56:19.760]  the real history of the world basically hit the title but I watched it on HBO but
[56:19.760 --> 56:25.200]  I'm gonna get off and do a rat rabbit trail about Pat Buchanan and he has
[56:25.200 --> 56:28.000]  criticized the Israel lobby which I think it's the right thing to do in some
[56:28.000 --> 56:34.560]  cases so he's been demonized on that front but the truth is a David Duke
[56:34.560 --> 56:38.280]  isn't even as radical as a lot of these black and Hispanic and other racist
[56:38.280 --> 56:41.200]  groups the government says are just fine and the media promotes that's just
[56:41.200 --> 56:44.440]  gonna create more white racism on the other side as a response I know a lot
[56:44.440 --> 56:47.560]  of people were big liberals that have now flipped over in a racist and I'm
[56:47.560 --> 56:52.480]  like whoa I've never seen anything like this don't buy into the infighting so it
[56:52.480 --> 56:55.720]  must be high cotton for the white supremacists and groups because a lot of
[56:55.720 --> 56:58.760]  white people are tired to being told they're evil and out to get folks and
[56:58.760 --> 57:01.320]  they've been over backwards so they're kind of flipping the other direction
[57:01.320 --> 57:06.720]  which is all designed but but here's the issue here's Trump condemning David Duke
[57:06.720 --> 57:09.760]  and racism here's Trump saying he's all-inclusive but he wants to have
[57:09.760 --> 57:16.280]  sovereignty they call that racism and then he's in the New York Times they
[57:16.280 --> 57:19.840]  cut his audio when they say David Duke white supremacist and other groups he
[57:19.840 --> 57:24.120]  hears white supremacist and other groups and he says I don't really know who they
[57:24.120 --> 57:28.200]  are other groups only heard part of it and they go oh you and that's a classic
[57:28.200 --> 57:33.480]  thing you stumbled he didn't stumble the other times and then he came out once
[57:33.480 --> 57:37.800]  he heard what they'd done what what CNN was saying and said of course I don't
[57:37.800 --> 57:43.120]  support that look at what I said 15 years ago but they use that as a way to
[57:43.120 --> 57:47.640]  discredit see he discredited himself because 15 years ago he said he didn't
[57:47.640 --> 57:52.280]  like David Duke and a cook like clan but now he didn't know no he said wait
[57:52.280 --> 57:57.120]  what I can't hear everything you're saying other groups I can't just decry
[57:57.120 --> 58:01.880]  groups who did you say exactly and that's how they spend this is their
[58:01.880 --> 58:07.600]  mind control as the entire establishment is now against Donald Trump well
[58:07.600 --> 58:11.320]  here's the bottom line for Fox News and others they've lost lost half the
[58:11.320 --> 58:15.320]  Republican viewers in the last six months right Bart has been reporting so
[58:15.320 --> 58:20.560]  that's not going too well for you is it and let's see the system doesn't care
[58:20.560 --> 58:24.320]  because media is only one division of the globalist system a very small
[58:24.320 --> 58:28.200]  division of it it's just there to keep people pacified and if Fox News has to
[58:28.200 --> 58:31.400]  lose most its viewers to make sure Donald Trump doesn't get in they'll do
[58:31.400 --> 58:35.040]  that in fact the Republican leaderships already said they will drop him like a
[58:35.040 --> 58:39.400]  hot rock and put in Hillary these people are one party and that's why they're so
[58:39.400 --> 58:48.200]  scared and people are crazy if they don't see that we'll be back stay with

[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.040]  actually getting a big sample of what we're covering is in the tens of millions
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.360]  and it's exponential it's dangerous folks basically it's like I'm in a NASCAR
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.760]  taking turns at 200 right now just so you know and I don't want to take risk I
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:42.440]  don't like having to do it but I have said to quote a famous British naval
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:49.720]  admiral damn the maneuvers go straight at him that's Lord Nelson who's killed
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:54.000]  the big battle of the Nile damn the maneuvers go straight out of and then
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:02.640]  was another US captain I think was World War one said damn the torpedoes go
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:07.960]  straight at them and they rammed a ship if I can you guys look up the quote damn
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.640]  the maneuvers go straight at them or damn the torpedoes go straight up so I
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.120]  want to get the second guy exactly right and then there's the Marine Corps
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.240]  General and I'll just forget his name in Korea they said sir we're completely
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:23.160]  surrounded by over a million troops is only like 50,000 Marines and literally
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.600]  the Chinese have poured in three million of them but a million were around them
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.960]  and he said good we can now attack in all directions which was true they
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.400]  actually ended up running them out and beating them it was human wave attacks
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.720]  though literally like in the movie 300 but for real piles of bodies 30 feet tall
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.840]  because luckily the Marines have enough ammunition and so as they were coming in
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.120]  you know 10 miles away they're hitting them with guns and five miles and two
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.120]  miles and three miles and quarter mile now they're right there human wave
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:58.440]  attacks million troops coming in at you fighting in all directions you imagine
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:02.360]  that and and I talked to a family that was actually there he died
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:08.160]  few years ago my dad's uncle my dad's dad had four four male siblings they were
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.400]  all so cool and he was the last to die and those guys would never tell me
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:18.640]  war stories we finally talked about flying relief missions in to that battle
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.840]  and some other ones and it was just unbelievable he just said just just at
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:27.200]  night just everywhere just flashes and just he just said it was like being
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.920]  inside a coffee can and being shook for an hour while they're just offloading it
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:39.640]  there's just who wasn't said that it was 1801 Douglas Fairgoat am I pronounced
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.280]  that right was a flag officer of the United States Navy during the American
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:47.440]  Civil War he was the first rear admiral vice admiral and admiral of the United
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.360]  States Navy he was remembered for his order at the Battle of Mobile Bay in
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:57.160]  which he was victorious usually paraphrased damn the torpedoes full speed
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:03.640]  ahead yeah and but I think he's paraphrasing damn the maneuvers go
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.680]  straight at him from Lord Nelson Admiral Nelson let's let's look that up make
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:14.040]  sure I'm right who didn't survive those big Napoleonic Wars but who did was Lord
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.720]  Wellington that's just amazing I've read so many books on all that but then I
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.720]  forget all the names that's why history is so much better than comic books or
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.480]  fake stuff just like reality is better than virtual reality because it's real
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.600]  you're designed for it you've been in it your genetics have been in it your
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:34.400]  ancestors have been in it you're a part of it the false reality is this thing
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:39.440]  spun by those that would be God all right I'm gonna give you the big secret
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:44.800]  and I've said this before but I really want to reiterate this when we come back
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:48.280]  just the app most important thing I could ever say I want to try to really put
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:52.560]  it to you as best I can then back into Trump back into the Islamic invasion back
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.720]  into the world economy world news huge military developments and more in full
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.920]  wars.com stay with us
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.640]  shock poll Hillary could lose the Trump in Democratic New York that's right
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.320]  polling data shows Hillary Clinton could lose New York a Democratic stronghold to
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.720]  Donald Trump as the GOP frontrunner gains broad support across party lines the
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.360]  poll results from Democratic and Republican legislative races have
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.080]  surprised virtually all the leading Democrats who have endorsed Clinton
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:23.000]  while also energizing GOP leaders are now warming up to Trump and the results
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.240]  found that Clinton has higher negative ratings with New York voters and Trump
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.080]  despite the fact she served as a New York senator some of the polls also found
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.480]  much stronger loyalty amongst Trump's potential voters and along Clinton's
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.960]  a finding that mirrors the record-breaking GOP turnouts and state
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.960]  primaries so far in other words Trump supporters will actually show up to the
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:45.000]  voting booth this past weekend Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions endorsed Trump
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.600]  during a campaign rally during the rally sessions lashed out at the trans
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:52.000]  specific partnership and promised that amnesty will not be granted to the

[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:34.040]  where I'll be. One time I was driving back from the DNC
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.640]  Covenant in Denver and Richard had been driving all over the night as one of
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:44.200]  the camera people and the driver of the RV and we were driving in and it was
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.320]  about 6 a.m. the Sun was coming up I can see Antelope and stuff on the side of
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:51.640]  the highway and he said we come over this hill we're gonna see Amarillo
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:57.280]  Amarillo by morning and we put on the iPad the iPod that time that for even
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:03.000]  had iPads and 2008 BAM and I came over the hill the Sun was cresting there was
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.800]  Amarillo by morning but I was coming from the north to the south not from the
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:13.120]  south to the north up from San Antonio. All right let me tell you what's coming
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:17.680]  up in this hour White House once increases Syrian refugees I'm gonna tell
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:21.040]  you the rest of the story on that front Warren Buffett says climate change no
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.040]  risk to Berkshire Hathaway because their companies are gonna be exempt from the
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:28.760]  taxes that Leonardo DiCaprio is calling for. US military successfully installs
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:34.960]  brain modems in animals a bunch of Trump news a bunch of election news it's all
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:43.000]  coming up right now. Also I was just given some huge news by Kit Daniels in
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.840]  that I forgot to bring it in here so maybe he can bring that back back into
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:53.320]  me. Now before I get into all this news it's really important to see the big
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:57.680]  picture and I know they've taught people hearing all these political parties
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:01.680]  around the world all these different ideas and all these different books all
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:05.520]  these different cultures and all these different futurists and all these
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.920]  different people you're telling you how the world really works or giving you
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:15.800]  their perspective. Well the reason I know how the world works quite frankly
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:20.600]  better than anybody who isn't on the inside of the power structure at the
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:24.400]  highest levels is because I've made it my business to study history in a wide
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.920]  spectrum I've also had a lot of life experience and for 21 years I've been
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:34.080]  immersed on air covering the globalist forcing myself to stay totally focused on
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.800]  this information so you do become informed doing that and interviewing
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:43.320]  thousands of top experts you know in every field and reading hundreds of
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.760]  publications and books written by the technocrats themselves reading
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:52.280]  congressional studies reading declassified memos like Northwoods and
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:11:00.640]  countless others and I can tell you unequivocally unequivocally we are
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:05.800]  entering a managed command and control global private world government
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:12.040]  designed to make humans obsolete and designed to phase out the vast majority
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:16.080]  of the world population and there are some arguments for that they make them
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.680]  very compellingly but the truth is they just like to kill people and control
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.080]  people and then they do everything they can to actually not let people
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:26.920]  industrialize and to overpopulate so then they have the excuse to kill even
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:31.960]  more people and that's on the Royal Commission report 49 and see there's
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.080]  all these world views and how people want the world to work and competing
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.400]  strategies and economies and there are different forces in the world but the
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:44.960]  dominant force on this planet outside of God and God's given the world over to
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:50.240]  the God of this world whether you believe it or not the archetypes there
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:55.120]  it's real the God of this world comes to kill steal and destroy it wants to
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:59.080]  deceive you it wants to beguile you it wants to make you dependent and enslave
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:04.080]  you the devil is a slave master who traffics in the souls of men and women
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.800]  who steals dreams that's why I can't stand LA why I physically get sick there
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.800]  since I was a kid when I would travel there and nowhere else it's not the
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:17.400]  smog because I get sick flying in at 10,000 feet I would always notice it
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:23.240]  and finally the time I was 30 years old I was like I'm noticing I'm getting sick
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:30.680]  before I land and I don't get into you know mumbo jumbo I mean I physically and
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:37.080]  everybody else talks about it an emptiness I mean I can be in some
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:40.160]  little fishing village in Mexico with people running around doing stuff and
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.440]  it feels so alive so good even if there's a poverty there and might even be
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.760]  some dark overtones there's so much light it's beautiful or I can be you
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:53.160]  know somewhere in a third-world country in Eastern Europe but there's
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:57.000]  humanity there it's the it's the falseness that it's purely a modern
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.520]  construct and it sucks in millions of people who believe that they're gonna
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:04.640]  have their dreams fulfilled it steals their dreams steals the light out of
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.480]  their eyes steals their soul
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:14.240]  Los Angeles is this is is probably the most satanic place in the world now I've
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.640]  talked to well-traveled folks to agree with me they said they've been
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:27.240]  everywhere from Tokyo to Calcutta from Peking to Beijing to Durban from
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:34.960]  Cairo to London from Paris to Berlin from Rio de Janeiro to Mexico City from
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:39.920]  Montreal to Tel Aviv
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:50.880]  there's nothing more evil and it's because there's the anguish and the pain
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:56.480]  of the people captured in the lie captured having their souls sucked down
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.560]  now you get near the city of London within London tax exempt with the oldest
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:04.840]  command bases in the world after the Vatican it's ice cold and you feel the
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:11.520]  presence scanning you physically with all the high-tech
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:19.800]  gadgetry and spiritually Rome is full of rage and power and passion and in
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:31.080]  war and beauty and as a mix New York is bustling and stinks but it has good
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:36.360]  feelings and bad same with London but not Los Angeles and if you want to know
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:42.080]  what the world's gonna be like it's basically one giant Los Angeles one
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.480]  giant soul-sucking event forcing you into artificial reality show that reality
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.200]  so horrible you want the artificial reality and so in that artificial
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:15:00.320]  reality you will basically allow your psyche to be overwritten I remember six
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.880]  years ago it was in MIT publications that they were putting brain chips in
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:09.840]  quote depressed troops then I ran into troops that volunteered with PTSD to be
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.200]  brain chipped then a few years ago I actually saw it in mainstream
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.920]  publications the brain chipping was beginning I would cover it they'd say
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:22.840]  oh he's crazy he says there's brain chips here's a daily mail article you know
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.840]  where they're telling you about something that's already going on in humans
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.440]  that they're saying it's an animal to get you ready US military successfully
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:33.720]  installs brain modems in animals and I'm gonna get into that part of a project
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:38.880]  to develop quote cyborg soldiers who use the cerebral implants to control
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:45.760]  machines that's from the Pentagon now see my cousin who's out of the army now
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:51.080]  and was in special operations I mean Africa the Middle East Eastern Europe
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:58.840]  the Caribbean Central America South America now that he's out he's told me a
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:05.320]  few stories you know stuff like he's in the Dominican Republic he pulls up in
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:10.320]  his rent car with it with the other officers with communists are following
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:15.440]  they jump out they try to machine gun the car the the guards at the hotel who
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:20.600]  look like they're bell hops you know perfectly shoot both the communists who
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:25.520]  were who were Haitian kill them and then they roll the car splash water before
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:29.320]  the next car rolls in you know just his stories like that he goes man you have
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:36.400]  no idea how crazy it is and I'll never forget he never really told me much
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.960]  after this because this is about 10 years ago I told the story on air he
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:44.600]  goes no we were at Sam Houston State University for an officers meeting
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:50.160]  they're about 200 officers in there and they call us in and they go all right
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.840]  you in the next year are going to be getting chips sub-germal the track where
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.320]  you go case you get kidnapped or whatever and then we're going to roll out
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.160]  for volunteers in the future you know even more in-depth chipping but those
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.680]  that are interested sign up and you can get you know more pay and perhaps have
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.240]  you know your stuff accelerated and he told me that a family reunion a small
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.200]  family reunion they were playing dominoes and you know drinking beer or whatever
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:13.240]  and eating watermelon and fried chicken you know that's what white
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:16.240]  southerners do and everybody makes a joke out of it and we're sitting there and
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.320]  he goes you know what you're talking about is true that he told about the
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:22.440]  meeting and all that they don't was a secret meeting or classified man he got
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.920]  called in and shoot out and then his dad who was also in special operations died
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.680]  a few years ago he was the guy that was in the really wild stuff here in the
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:39.280]  US he I was over at his house they live on the ranch next door ours he's like
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:44.120]  do me a favor and don't ever talk about stuff he tells you again as he got
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:47.560]  brought up you know before the man and almost didn't get his last promotion
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:52.760]  because of that talking about that microchip stuff and I went well he didn't
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.280]  tell me I talk about he goes whatever he tells you don't tell anybody about it
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:02.280]  you're lucky you're not dead I can't believe you're not dead and your mother
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:09.040]  and father love you I'm sorry I'm sorry but you just need to shut up and see
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.200]  that's what I've grown up around the general public lives in some fantasy
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.840]  land you want me to watch NFL football while stuff like this is going on and
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.920]  they're getting ready to brain ship the general military first they'll make it
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:25.640]  elite with the Navy Seals and the Delta Force people and then it's going to move
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.040]  on and it's going to be those that have brain damage and stuff where it
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.440]  actually helps them but here's the big secret everything the globalist do has
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:38.800]  a trojan horse whether it's GMO food or a or an iPhone or a droid or a or an
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.760]  appliance or an alarm system or anything cultural they do it's for another
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:48.480]  reason I mean look at this headline today maybe they'll give them a Pulitzer
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:53.120]  Prize at Bloomberg your smartphone knows who you are and what you're doing and
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.240]  has this big article about everything you do being tracked so just give up and
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:00.880]  let the FBI and they're already in I told people this 20 years ago that the
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.920]  phones by law the future would be like this and a few years later they were
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.120]  because I was told by NSA whistleblowers but again oh Bloomberg said it so oh
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:15.320]  we're validated now there is a global government coming in that is against
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:24.120]  everyone there is a global government coming in that is to end us you don't
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:29.800]  make deals with it it's much more sophisticated than something like the
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.800]  Terminator from the 1980s but we ought to take a line from that where the
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.240]  special forces guys come back in time he's telling the cops everybody look man
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.440]  he's coming he won't stop he doesn't care if it's a building full of police he
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.360]  wants to kill you that's his mission that's what he's gonna do you can't
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.840]  reason with it you can't talk with it you can't play games with it the
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:49.920]  governing system of the world is eugenics and a
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:54.080]  technocracy to come in and wipe us out then the elite believe they're gonna
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:58.240]  merge with machines and be gods now I told you this 18 years ago but now it's

[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:39.680]  supporter she'll be popping in for a segment in the night I've got so much of
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:43.520]  the news to get to it it's just that look everything else is window dressing
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:46.960]  and it's important to cover what's happening in the world but just there's
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.440]  a technocracy coming in it's got our kids they're being raised on iPads and
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:56.320]  iPhones Steve Jobs wouldn't let his kids even have them people don't know how to
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:00.280]  take care of themselves they don't know how to stand up for themselves they want
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:05.040]  us domesticated they want us weak they want us dependent not to keep us safe but
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:12.160]  to phase humanity out and you look at younger generations myself included they
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:18.280]  are so soft compared to previous on average it is frightening to see Joe
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:22.280]  Biggs in downtown Austin with trendy saying we want to kill Donald Trump on
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:29.960]  tape and they couldn't kill a wet paper bag I always notice the weaker the
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.800]  person is the more they shoot their mouth off about killing people and people
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:40.240]  that really kill people don't shoot their mouths off about it and to watch
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:44.840]  Obama and Hillary talk about killing people I'm tired of it you people are
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:49.160]  soft you live off the hard work and the courage of people that came before you
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:53.960]  and Lord knows our military's done bad stuff and Lord knows it's gone on
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:57.080]  missions that were illegal but you know what at least they did something you
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:03.040]  just shit there on your butts and complain all day and again it's our
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.280]  military today holding back backing al Qaeda holding back basically a coup by
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:12.080]  Obama and gun confiscation military has told Obama there's not gonna be gun
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.920]  confiscation there's not gonna be an attack on Syria you're not gonna do it
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.760]  and I told you about that first it's come out in the news where you see
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.920]  Darrell is on Fox News saying the military is prepared to not follow
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:28.800]  Obama's orders across the board I've talked to the brass his his his attempt
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:35.040]  to run out everybody didn't work and all I'm getting at is that's the point we've
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:38.040]  reached where Donald Trump's kind of figuring out there's a global government
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:43.200]  special interests are shutting us down we're not supposed to have prosperity
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:47.320]  what let's kick these bureaucrats out let's not make bad deals for America
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:52.680]  they've got his phones tapped people they know he really knows what's going on
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:58.720]  they know Donald Trump is aware of what's happening you're hearing more and
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:01.880]  more about oligarchs and global government and America's been hijacked
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.440]  and taken over Trump is getting people ready to come out and just say we've
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:10.600]  been captured by foreign institutions Charles de Gaulle did it after World
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:13.920]  War two NATO tried to stay there wouldn't let France have its own nukes and
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:19.800]  de Gaulle had a soft coup you can look it up and actually kick NATO out and had
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:24.640]  troops go and take the nukes that were at the Paris Airport now Charles de Gaulle
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:30.200]  Airport NATO troops had French troops the French weren't always domesticated like
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.320]  they are now they're one of the most warlike countries in history I love this
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.280]  thing about the French turn and run the French are cowards the French are this
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:43.240]  and that the French helped found the United States folks the only country
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:48.600]  more warlike than the French was the British and the French did meet their
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:52.080]  match repeatedly the Germans were foolish to ever get manipulated by the
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:55.200]  British in a world war one or World War two and want to know who's really evil
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.280]  at the end of the day it's the people running the British crown folks they're
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:02.480]  the smartest they're the slickest they're the most Machiavellian the whole
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:10.200]  black nobility out of Italy ran to England 800 years ago and man you mixed
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:19.080]  all the black nobility in with all of those Uther pen dragon barbarians it was
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:23.520]  game over and a bunch of Vikings it was game over pretty by the mess with them
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:30.280]  and then we sit here with this eugenics based system that comes out of 1855
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:37.080]  British government plan we're living in the final years of it we're living in
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.680]  its attempt to take over and there's a battle against it there's other
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:45.960]  competing forces in the universe in the world but it's the dominant force with
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.480]  the tentacles trying to take over right now and this is the great battle you
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:53.640]  don't make a deal with it you can't get out of it by playing games with it it

[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:17.080]  they've gone and looked he has a disproportionate amount of women in
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.640]  management too so just claiming he hates everybody but that's not true he

[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:18.400]  like the return of manly chivalry is that what you're getting at absolutely
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:21.520]  there is a war on men and a war on women and war on families because we're all
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:25.760]  alone and nobody's gonna stand up for each other I mean nobody used to mess
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:28.960]  with women than I knew up because their dad or brothers would kill them and the
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:33.000]  police would turn a blind eye nowadays you know the child fights back against
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.160]  bullies they get in trouble for fighting back they want us to be a bunch of
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:42.480]  slaves exactly don't act around represent a beautiful human being with a
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:53.160]  beautiful heart working hard to rescue America America we do not win anymore
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:57.720]  not in business not economically lessons we've been sold out exactly as
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:01.280]  with more money short-term and just selling us off and chopping us up
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:05.520]  that's what these big looters do now specifically in your bio I noticed that
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:08.920]  you say your dad was a Trump fan and as a Trump fan and then you've been a
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:15.120]  Trump fan for a long time yes my dad was a doctor he was a cardiologist but in
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:20.760]  the same time my my dad he always encouraged me to be a business person
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:28.280]  sure coffee and flowers for from Colombia this is one of the best products we have and he
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:34.560]  knows how hard I work in Colombia and how the business went like up and down
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:41.680]  right now guys we are not making money anymore we just take our savings to pay
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:46.360]  employees then this mean is much better you know what close the business and be
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:52.160]  like Rubio looking for a job I was about to say folks with women ways you're
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:55.960]  gonna find out it's zero you jack up the wage to how they just won't be a job
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:42:02.880]  period exactly about zero yeah in this moment nobody is making money now if we
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.440]  do the point of view why Donald Trump is the perfect man for the White House
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:14.680]  first of all he's a brilliant negotiator he's a brilliant businessman he has
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:21.720]  education chronological age Donald Trump have experience visionary he can
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:25.760]  share with us well for me the big thing is that the entire elite is freaking out
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:29.880]  over him and the Koch brothers that own both parties are coming out against him
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:33.920]  Fox News is doing sneaky stuff I mean why do you think the elite are so scared of
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:37.960]  somebody just saying I'm not gonna let us have one-sided trade deals because
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:43.320]  they've been screwing us and absolutely because one of the reason all those
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:51.280]  people are completely scared government and Cruz Rubio Hillary Bernie all those
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:56.720]  people they are going like socialists and communists we don't want this Bernie
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:01.240]  admits we don't look at Venezuela exactly Bernie admits he didn't have a
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:06.040]  paying job to leave us 40 I had paying jobs when I was well I was six years old
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.520]  doing chores you know if I wanted to toy had to work you know around the house
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:12.280]  doing laundry or helping cook dinner or carry out the trash or mow the yard but
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:17.120]  I had paying job the time I was 12 years old and my dad thought I was being lazy
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:20.320]  not being honored I mean he was out when he was like nine years old you know
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:25.400]  working in the fields and his family was proud of that what imagine someone who
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:32.840]  hasn't worked till they're 40 what what planet is that yeah this is the only
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:41.320]  person really understand all the problems we United States have is Donald
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:47.680]  J Trump he has the experience about business he knows exactly how to create
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:55.240]  jobs fix economy he know what's going on and what direction we need to go because
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:44:03.720]  we need to put number one United States of America there is Cruz Rubio Hillary
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:09.720]  Bernie they put as the global number one and United States we are the last one
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:14.600]  in the line sure I mean to be fair I mean the rhetoric of Cruz is really good I
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:20.280]  just hope we can trust him now Rubio has been basically like Obama or something
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:25.200]  in his actions not as rhetoric but but I like Ted Cruz and I would be happy if
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:30.000]  he was president as well my only problem is he did start the dirty tricks first
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.480]  and so I hope they don't fight each other too much so that Cruz politically
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:38.080]  destroys himself because Rand Paul really hurt himself politically going after
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:42.360]  Trump he might not even keep his Kentucky seat well I had my personal
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:52.080]  opinion Cruz is a liar Donald Trump is honest sincere here when in fight for
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:58.120]  America and this is Donald Trump well I know this they are scared to death look
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:01.400]  at this article voice of the elite the economists also the financial times same
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:07.080]  day must be stopped wow how could Americans or anybody not see the whole
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:12.080]  media foreign presidents Chinese Communist leaders the British government
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:16.080]  all of them saying he's the worst person on the earth and trying to demonizing
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:20.960]  he must be doing something right I mean I would be a coward if I sat on the
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.480]  sidelines now with the elite that I know of hijacked my country it's really
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:29.760]  neocolonialism but by the megabanks and then this guy comes out and fights them
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:33.720]  they come out against him I'm calling for somebody to stand up and then I say oh
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:37.040]  he's not perfect he's not a hundred percent agrees with me I'm not gonna
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:40.840]  support him that would be the most knitting cowardly position I could
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:47.680]  imagine don't I'll get Trump like I repeated again Alex is a human being
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:54.600]  with a beautiful heart he has a big brain he's a professional and big hair
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:46:00.720]  it's executive a big badger executive person then he know exactly he can be the
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:08.240]  best president of United States America I don't I don't believe excuse me
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:13.960]  America we have a person like he's almost 70 years old excuse me we are
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:19.640]  babies we do not know what's going on but Donald yet Trump he will be the best
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:23.680]  president of United States taking care those people they don't have a job
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:31.160]  jobless we do we can afford have full-time people anymore no job full-time is
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:36.880]  you can see what they call and call or part-time job this is nothing Obamacare
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:40.800]  was designed enough to make everybody part-time for the for the big companies
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:47.680]  and then Obama Obamacare is a disaster Obamacare is terrible for the whole
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:56.080]  nation if I'm employer I can afford Obamacare and employees they can afford
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:01.400]  but if you're an Obama insider you get a waiver if you are Obama maximum they
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:06.000]  care about $100 and after that no matter if you are homeless still you can afford
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:12.760]  excuse me we just waiting for Donald yet Trump to solve those issues in the White
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:19.440]  House we waiting for Donald yet Trump to create job fix economy save our country
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:24.560]  we can't be or we can't go in the direction be a communist or socialist
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.640]  this doesn't exist we are coming I love how you say that it doesn't exist it's a
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:36.360]  nightmare system it's a nightmare system we hear the Hispanic American citizen
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:43.000]  in Afro-American citizen Donald yet Trump is the one represent us represent the
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.160]  white people to represent all the races all the national all I care about as
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:50.960]  you represent private property and cuts taxes and leaves the family alone exact
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:55.560]  and also his plan about taxes is one of the best for me personal like a
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:00.680]  business person I can't wait and also I feel confidence that they don't I'll get
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:06.240]  Trump will be a president of United States sure mr. Trump I will be a star
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:11.320]  spending my money but for now I'm scared to spend money I was about to say look
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:14.200]  we're being maneuvered into bankruptcy because the elites for tax exempt
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.520]  they're there they want us poor so they can buy everything up and make us a
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:22.560]  permanent servant class the Renaissance in America hadn't been perfect but it was
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.680]  about making everybody wealthy everybody successful everybody self-sufficient
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:30.000]  and that's what domestication has been about ending that I want to come back
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.120]  and talk about the New York Times and others calling for his death we've gone
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:38.520]  out and talked to Austin ice liberals and they say they want him dead and again
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:41.200]  they don't look like they could kill you know a roach but they're ready to kill
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:44.320]  everybody because they're so tough and so liberal and I want to talk about what
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:47.840]  you think you're gonna try to do next to destroy him straight ahead with Miriam
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:52.080]  Witcher and again she's an American citizen but originally 30 plus years
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:56.320]  ago from Columbia these are the type of folks we need here to build up this
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:59.280]  country because I'll be honest a lot of indigenous Americans whether they be black
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:02.800]  Hispanic white mix whatever they've had it so good so long they're trying to
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:06.720]  spoil brats they're now Bernie Sanders supporters but you speak about your
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:09.680]  business not doing too well do you have a website or where do folks find your
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:15.320]  flowers and coffee well the flowers in coffee are coming from Columbia are
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:20.840]  excellent products these guys you go to internet go to wiki period you can find
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:26.920]  how the business is one of the best in Colombia plug your company or you want
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:32.360]  to plug your company from my point of view I just do the standby from Colombia
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:35.680]  because we can't afford to be in business anymore I understand so you just

[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:21.960]  up the family it's game over you turn on television you see it that's what it's
[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:26.000]  about she's gonna go out and do a personal street man on the street woman on
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.680]  the street in downtown Austin we're gonna go to UT and then versus folks maybe
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:34.480]  in you know outside a grocery store to just see how brainwashed people are
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:40.280]  somewhere in a liberal area versus a more libertarian area don't even call it
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:44.800]  conservative but but looking at the hatred of Trump maybe you should ask
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:47.640]  folks do you agree with the New York Times writer that says kill Trump and
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:50.840]  then ask them well well you know what are you Nazis or communists you want to
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:55.520]  kill somebody for their views Trump hasn't really done anything I mean
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:02.040]  Mexico has a wall and police on its border other countries do he's not
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:06.120]  against people saying we just can't be wide open but again that's globalism
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:11.600]  what do you make of a sent a fox and all of his mean statements okay Alice this
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:17.360]  is the situation nobody want to kill Donald Trump excuse me we want to
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:22.360]  support Donald Trump to be the president of the United States of America the
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:32.560]  people are talking like nonsense we the people around the world is unbelievable
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:43.240]  we love Trump we adore Trump he is our businessman visionary brilliant
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:52.200]  negotiator we can't wait to see mr. Trump deal with Putin this is we
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:57.520]  like America we feel so proud about mr. Trump his beautiful family but he's
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:01.320]  about a president and a government and a people being in charge not multinational
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:05.640]  think tanks that hijacked the country he's about prosperity not clowered and
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:11.560]  piven agenda 21 to bankrupt by design talk about like Latin America incredible
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:15.040]  resources incredible people but the elites have always tried to keep folks
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:22.000]  poor to keep control absolutely from Mexico to Spain we have history we had
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.640]  culture we don't have the law the law is only writing in a piece of paper and
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:36.880]  nobody follow the law we we Hispanic American Latino American citizen we are
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:42.000]  waiting for Donald Trump will be a president of United States I guarantee to
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:50.320]  you America he's the only one is going to respect our Constitution respect what
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:58.560]  is the law Donald Trump is a man with integrity is the man with honesty
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:06.280]  transparency we love Donald Trump because Donald Trump is a man with a big
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:12.400]  heart and cameras to outside the cameras we had the opportunity Donald Trump
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:18.160]  represent from Mexico to Spain and all those tiny islands in the Caribbean he
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:22.160]  represent our dream let me ask you this question why we never have in South
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:26.280]  America or Central America or in other country well I find the folks I run into
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:30.280]  from Latin America are incredibly into hard work incredibly smart hard working
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:33.760]  they're into free market they want private property they want prosperity yes
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:36.680]  but they always get groups over them sucking off of them corporate groups
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:40.440]  governmental groups and then I hear on the media all Hispanics hate Trump but
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:45.080]  in Gallup polls over 70% want to control the border talking to real Americans
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:48.800]  and Hispanic folks out there like yourself what is the real view percentage
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:55.140]  wise on Trump Trump is the kind of person is going to protect our life here in
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:58:03.640]  the United States Texas Florida California after 6 p.m. you need to go and sign
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:08.760]  your car with a gun and sign the car with your knife if somebody attacked you
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:15.320]  nobody said this CNN Fox you hiding those kind of things but my friends club
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:20.320]  leaving close to the border they are checking and scared about their life
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:24.280]  consistently there is nothing about New York time there is nothing about
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:28.760]  newspapers but don't I get Trump stay there let's talk about what it's really
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:32.000]  like in Latin America for folks and then ask ourselves why would we want to

[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:14.560]  behind the scenes and people that know him and being able to talk to him some
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:20.680]  that he's really getting a crash course now and as they attack him and as he
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:24.080]  learns that we really are under globalism he's come out and said in a
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:27.240]  letter yesterday we're controlled by foreign oligarchs I want to free America
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:30.600]  from globalist occupation and when he gets hardcore and comes out and says
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:34.080]  that to the CFR and the Chinese government and everybody else it's
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:38.480]  game over America has been captured just like colonialism controlled in Latin
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:42.760]  America it's a new type of colonialism yes China tells us what movies we can
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:46.600]  put out nothing it's the Chinese people the Chinese government absolutely and
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:51.720]  America's been so open we've been overtaken and and also don't forget we
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:56.840]  need to stop the business here in the United States about the drug cartel this
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:02.760]  is the point everybody is scared I was living in Colombia without in the

[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:21.720]  is our reputation like a human being no matter where you want to fly oh you are
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:28.800]  from Colombia this is bad the same here in United States do not let Hillary

[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:55.800]  look forward to seeing the video you're about to shoot on the street I want to
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:59.080]  say the final things
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:04.600]  shock pole Hillary could lose the Trump in Democratic New York that's right
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:08.280]  polling data shows Hillary Clinton could lose New York a Democratic stronghold to
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:12.680]  Donald Trump as the GOP frontrunner gains broad support across party lines the
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:16.280]  poll results from Democratic and Republican legislative races have
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:19.000]  surprised virtually all the leading Democrats who have endorsed Clinton
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.600]  while also energizing GOP leaders who are now warming up the Trump and the
[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:25.720]  results found that Clinton has higher negative ratings with New York voters
[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:29.400]  and Trump despite the fact she served as a New York senator some of the polls
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:32.960]  also found much stronger loyalty amongst Trump's potential voters and along
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:36.880]  Clinton's a finding that mirrors the record-breaking GOP turnouts and state
[02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:40.880]  primaries so far in other words Trump supporters will actually show up to the
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:44.920]  voting booth this past weekend Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions endorsed Trump
[02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:48.520]  during a campaign rally during the rally sessions lashed out at the trans
[02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:51.920]  specific partnership and promise that amnesty will not be granted to the
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:06:06.200]  legal steering of Trump presidency this is Kit Daniels reporting for info wars.com

[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:20.040]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare defense.
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:24.440]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:26.920]  Pathetogens added to the food and water,
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:30.040]  and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:34.200]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:37.640]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:42.920]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:47.720]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity
[02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:48.880]  inside the human body.
[02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:51.720]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:54.840]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:57.880]  and it starts at infolwarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:14.800]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:20.800]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:24.800]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to open the phones up on any issue.
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:27.520]  Long time callers, first time callers.
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:37.880]  Trump is having the Middle East, you name it, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:42.440]  And we're going to obviously also get into the Oscars and Leonardo DiCaprio,
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:46.200]  who I think is a great actor, but give me a break, calling for global warming taxes
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:49.880]  and stuff, and he flies around on these jumbo jets with the biggest carbon footprint out there
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:53.240]  other than people like Obama that tells people in Africa you can't have cars
[02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:58.040]  or air conditioning out front a giant jumbo jet with 15 airplanes that came with him.
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:02.880]  Again, these liberal elite, they can have all the prosperity and the money,
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:05.760]  but we can't have anything.
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:06.880]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:10.920]  They're training us to be poor to control us, and that's what our guest
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:15.400]  was just talking about, Miriam Witcher, who's been here 35 years in the United States,
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:20.400]  and she's seen her success go down as the economy has fallen apart.
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:24.720]  And we also have two ladies who've been on before, who are known all over the country now,
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:26.040]  Diamond and Silk.
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:28.560]  We've got Diamond on the left and Silk to the right.
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:30.560]  You're a TV viewer, you're a radio listener.
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:33.280]  You can always tune in at infowars.com.
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:35.320]  Forward slash show, it's stations across the country.
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:37.360]  They're now picking up the TV show to actually see these ladies,
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:42.240]  but Diamond and Silk.com are their websites, and riding shotgun for the rest of this segment
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:45.360]  with us obviously is Miriam Witcher.
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:47.880]  Miriam, you had one other point, and we're going to go to these ladies,
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:49.880]  but you're going to stay with us to make points.
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:54.120]  You had one more point, though, about Super Tuesday coming up tomorrow.
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:55.680]  Absolutely.
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:01.920]  This is for Texas and for every state in the United States.
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:08.560]  Please, I invite you to vote for the man with integrity,
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:12.640]  NSC and transparency, Donald J. Trump.
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:18.720]  He will be for us for every American citizen, every race, every nationality.
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:22.320]  Please, vote only Donald J. Trump.
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:23.800]  Thank you.
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:25.960]  Thank you so much for coming to Austin to be with us.
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:31.080]  You're going to go out and do an interview with folks on the street coming up as well.
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:32.920]  Stay with us for the rest of the segment.
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:36.440]  Now, with us to the bottom of the hour, all the ladies we just talked about,
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:39.360]  Diamond and Silk, I'm not going to go over their whole background.
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:42.640]  Folks know who they are, but they stand in their own words.
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:44.720]  The silent majority is African American women.
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:50.520]  They are voicing their views about media bias, political babble,
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:55.200]  and repetitive political tactics that they feel the average American is tired of being subjected to.
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:57.160]  And that's just it.
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:00.960]  And I'm proud the last five or six months I've said, obviously, Trump's the guy.
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:02.000]  But I still had questions.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.400]  But when I saw the Chinese government that's killed over 80 million of their own people on record,
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.600]  come out and say, America, you don't vote for him or else.
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:13.240]  And the Vicente Fox with all his corrupt background, his brother,
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:18.560]  coming out and saying, you know, you do what I say and Joe Biden apologizing.
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:21.520]  And the British government saying they may ban Trump from flying there.
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:24.160]  Scotland may kick his business out and all this crap.
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:25.480]  And that's terrorism.
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:28.120]  And Obama saying he's uneligible.
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:30.520]  And, you know, I say you can't have him.
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:37.440]  And all these other groups and all these elites and the Davos group and the New York Times,
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:42.760]  owned by Carlos Slim, I'm not against anybody, but foreigners own all our media.
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:45.640]  China says what movies can come out now.
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:46.640]  I went to saw the Martian.
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:51.080]  They admit the Chinese government basically funded it where we can't get rockets into space,
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:52.720]  but China can.
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:59.000]  It's just crazy how we've been colonized by all these corporate groups
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:05.880]  that see America as chattel slaves and they want to break our will and make us submit.
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:08.080]  So I'm more proud than ever.
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:09.080]  And then I look at the New York Times.
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:10.720]  I've got the article here from 2000.
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:14.800]  I want to ask diamonds and silk about this right now.
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:18.840]  Where Trump came out in 2001 and said, I'm not going to be part of the reform party
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:24.640]  now because the Klan and David Dukes involved reform beds said to be a no go for Trump.
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:27.640]  And then they do the famous tactic they did in earlier elections.
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:30.520]  He's on remote, they cut his audio off.
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:31.520]  He can't hear what they're saying.
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:36.360]  And they go, something, Duke, swipes, because what, who, what groups, I can't say without
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:37.360]  knowing the groups.
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:41.000]  And then they go, oh my gosh, he's for David Duke, the dirty tricks.
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.440]  And now the New York Times calls for killing him and nobody gets in trouble.
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:46.720]  We have Austinites on video.
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:47.720]  We went out.
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:50.520]  They said, yeah, murdering down at UT, just killing.
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:52.560]  These people are crazy.
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:56.600]  And so diamond and silk, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:12:58.080]  I'm kind of ranting here.
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:12:59.080]  What do you want to tackle first?
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:03.080]  I've covered, I mean, are you more proud than ever with all the world leaders lining up
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:04.080]  against Trump?
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:07.920]  Why can't we have our own president that says he's going to try to have fair deals for us
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:09.840]  and that talks about having real jobs again?
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:13.360]  I don't, they are so scared of just having a nationalist.
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:14.800]  What's your view on this, ladies?
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:18.480]  Well, we can have that if we get out and vote for that.
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:24.120]  And see, it's about we, the people, we, the people will decide this election, but we have
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:25.880]  to get out and we have to vote.
[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:26.880]  That's right.
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:32.160]  As far as what CNN did yesterday to our man, Mr. Donald Trump, listen, I would have wished
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:37.840]  the media would have taken and disballed the Democratic Party because they are the one
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:43.800]  that started the KKK movement to keep people of color down and to intimidate them and to
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:44.800]  manipulate them.
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:45.800]  That's right.
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:47.920]  So that's what they should have been going towards.
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:50.480]  But you know, David Duke is his own man.
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:51.480]  Yeah.
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:54.480]  David Duke can vote for whoever he wants to vote for.
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:58.600]  And Donald Trump is not to be held accountable for who vote for him.
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:13:59.600]  That's right.
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:00.600]  He can't help who vote for him.
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:01.600]  He can't help that.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:02.600]  He can't.
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:05.520]  I think if that's the case, they'll start having child molesters so their Democrats
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:10.600]  go vote for them to say, child molesters support Trump.
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:11.600]  Trickery.
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:12.600]  That's all it is.
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:13.600]  This is straight trickery.
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:14.600]  That's what it is.
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:15.600]  Media trickery is what this is.
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:16.600]  Yes.
[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:19.000]  And we have to, we, the people have to ignore it.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  Exactly.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.360]  Like I told them on the last video, if you see something, you don't like, just cut the
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:24.360]  TV off.
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:27.280]  Just cut it off and find some other source of news.
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:29.800]  Because I'm not, I'm not, I'm not falling for that oaky dog.
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:30.800]  I'm not falling.
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:34.760]  That's the first, I don't know why the media used that to try to tear someone down.
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:36.240]  I don't know why the media do that.
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:37.240]  It's like a race baiting.
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:38.240]  It's like a race baiting.
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:42.160]  They've been caught before cutting, cutting feeds off, you know, and then asking a question
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:43.520]  and the person says, huh, huh.
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:45.160]  And then they go, oh, look, you're stupid.
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:47.720]  CNN's been caught with fake blue screens.
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:49.360]  They've been caught with fake Iraq coverage.
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:51.360]  They have no credibility.
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:53.320]  Listen, I know how that goes.
[02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:55.160]  I know how you have an earpiece in your ear.
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:56.160]  You can't hear whatever.
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:57.160]  Right.
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:01.080]  But to keep in mind, Donald Trump disbarred this person, what, three days ago, and then
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:05.200]  back in 2000, 2001, I'm over with this storm.
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:06.920]  They can go ahead on and hang this one up.
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:07.920]  Let's move on to the next.
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:08.920]  That's right.
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:09.920]  See, this is a movement.
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:13.440]  That's why they're using this platform for them to have a moment because they got the
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:17.680]  dance for the puppet masses, those career politicians, we're moving on.
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:18.680]  I agree.
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:22.800]  What other, what do you think of the Koch brothers, the guys that have run the Establishment
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:28.040]  Republican Party, giving 75 million at that secret meeting, it's not come out with Rubio
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:29.040]  last Thursday.
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:30.640]  It's come out in the news to defeat Trump.
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:35.400]  I mean, if that doesn't tell you the Republican establishment, the Democrats, the Chinese,
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:38.880]  Communist murderers, everybody who's evil is against Trump.
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:42.760]  I mean, my gosh, I'd be crazy if I didn't go all in.
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:43.760]  A waste.
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:44.760]  Yeah.
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:46.240]  You know, our veterans, we have some homeless.
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:47.240]  Uh huh.
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:49.240]  Some are not getting adequate medical care.
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:51.280]  We have people living in poverty.
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:56.920]  People want opportunity, but you got these big wigs wasting money from Bush now to the
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:15:57.920]  Koch brothers.
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:15:58.920]  That's just waste.
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:15:59.920]  Waste is what I see.
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:03.920]  They've already spent, what is it, 300 million trying to beat Trump and none of it's working.
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:04.920]  Right.
[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:05.920]  I don't see how that's conservative.
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:06.920]  That's right.
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:09.920]  They want to run on a conservative platform, but that don't seem conservative to me.
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:10.920]  That's not conservative.
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:13.280]  That's conservative that Trump hasn't spent anybody's money.
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:15.800]  He's just out there doing it all, changing the whole game.
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:16.960]  That's why Chris Christie in her door.
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:18.040]  That's what we need.
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:19.040]  Game changers.
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:20.920]  We know this current thing in working.
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:23.320]  They're scared of him because they already have taken over the country.
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:27.520]  Let me ask you amazing lady, something right now, what do you want to cover?
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:31.160]  Cause I got a lot of questions, but in your gut, you guys got a lot of, you know, obvious
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:33.640]  smarts there, real world smarts.
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:36.040]  What do you expect them to hit him with next?
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:38.280]  And what does your gut tell you is coming down the road?
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:43.280]  And what can all of us do to make sure we make the elite, you know, nightmare a real nightmare?
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:48.000]  Well, they're probably going to hit with commercials, lies, more lies.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:49.000]  That's right.
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.160]  They're just to ignore it and get out and vote.
[02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:53.600]  Make sure you get out tomorrow and vote.
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:56.440]  I think the next voting day after that is March the 15th.
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:16:58.920]  Get out and vote and let your voice be heard.
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:00.600]  You want to vote for Donald Day Trump.
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:01.600]  You want to vote right?
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:04.520]  Cause if we don't vote right this time, we are going to get left again.
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:09.560]  And keep in mind that a vote for Donald Trump is victory over the establishment.
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:10.560]  Yes.
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:11.560]  That's right.
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:12.560]  So get out and vote tomorrow.
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:13.560]  That's for real.
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:17.760]  Why do you think the establishment is literally paying their pants?
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:19.600]  Cause they're so used to controlling everything.
[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:20.600]  That's right.
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:21.600]  It's the elite.
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:23.600]  They're used to controlling it.
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:25.800]  And Donald Trump is going to clean house.
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:26.800]  Yes.
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:28.560]  All of this corruption is going to stop.
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:29.560]  Out the door.
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:34.760]  And see, they don't see these career politicians are so used to going to DC or Washington.
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:35.760]  Yes.
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:38.280]  Working for their own greed and not the need of people.
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:39.280]  That's right.
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:42.640]  Donald Trump is making it now where you're going to work for the need of people and not
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:43.640]  your own greed.
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:48.600]  I've never seen ladies and I want you to pop in here as well, Miriam.
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:50.200]  I've been on there 21 years.
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:51.520]  I've been politically involved for 25.
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:55.440]  I mean, my dad would send me to Ronald Reagan speeches when I was eight years old, but I've
[02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:56.760]  been involved my whole life basically.
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:18:00.160]  My mom made the point that during the Watergate hearings, I was sitting there breastfeeding.
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:02.840]  But I've never seen an elite more scared.
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:07.160]  I've never seen somebody coming out for 9-11 truth, going after the IRS, going after the
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:11.040]  private Federal Reserve, going after these big banks being tax-exempt.
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:12.920]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:18.080]  It's just such a no-brainer and I have friends that go, I'm going for Cruz because he's a
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:19.080]  real Texan.
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:23.520]  A real Texan, I'm an eighth generation Texan, but I'm not going to vote for somebody because
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:25.840]  they say they've lived in Texas part of their life.
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:30.720]  I'm going to vote for somebody not off what color they are or where they're from as long
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:33.960]  as they're American and want to try to fix this country.
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:34.960]  It's just crazy.
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:36.960]  What do you ladies say to that?
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:37.960]  Well, I agree.
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:38.960]  I agree.
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:41.880]  We didn't vote race this time based on gender or race.
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:44.680]  We voted this time based on who is going to do the job.
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:47.320]  Or if you live in Texas, I can care less who the candidate is.
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:48.320]  I want the best candidate.
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:50.320]  I don't care if they're from New York.
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:51.320]  There you go.
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:53.320]  The best candidate that we see is Donald Trump.
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:58.120]  Why do you think as a true classic Northern Yankees, the Southerners are as strong as
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:18:59.120]  supporters?
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:02.800]  Doesn't that kind of shatter this idea that Southerners don't like Northerners?
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:07.400]  Well, I think that the, I think here in the South, people are excited.
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:08.400]  Yes.
[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:11.720]  You know, we, I lost a lot of manufacturing in the South.
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:12.720]  That's right.
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:17.760]  And why is it that we have these presidents that sign in these trade deals to outsource
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:18.760]  all of our jobs?
[02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:19.760]  Oh, I love it.
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:20.760]  Hold on.
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:21.760]  I got to interrupt you.
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:22.760]  Absolutely.
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:23.760]  Here's the deal.
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:24.760]  Here's the deal.
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:25.760]  I don't just say this to act like I'm nice and sad.
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:26.760]  I want to say it.
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:27.760]  I grew up in Dallas.
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:30.040]  Half of my friends were black playing football, baseball.
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:31.040]  You name it.
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:33.560]  Because you know, they were the guys that were fun to go out, you know, see a movie with
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:36.120]  or go out to a restaurant with, you know, my guys.
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:37.680]  In fact, that's what I miss most about moving down here.
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:41.360]  My last year of high school was all my, you know, African American friends in Dallas.
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:43.760]  I tell you, you get down here, you get in college.
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:46.520]  All you hear about is how you're evil because you're white and all this stuff all day.
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:49.520]  Well, they've got us all fighting with each other.
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:52.840]  We're being discriminated against that our jobs are being shipped overseas in one side
[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:53.840]  of deals.
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:56.960]  We're being discriminated against that they're bringing in people to undercut the wages.
[02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:01.480]  We're being discriminated against in that as Americans, we're getting screwed over.
[02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:02.480]  And you're right.
[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:03.480]  You just said it.
[02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:07.640]  We're being discriminated against by the elites, all of us together.
[02:20:07.640 --> 02:20:11.800]  And that's why they've got MSNBC race baiting because they want to divert us while that's
[02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:12.800]  happening.
[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:14.160]  So you just talked about real discrimination.
[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:15.160]  That's my hot button.
[02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:17.160]  Ladies, lay it out for us right now.
[02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:19.440]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:22.720]  People want someone that's going to work for the people, not against the people.
[02:20:22.720 --> 02:20:23.720]  That's right.
[02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:25.920]  And when we look at Donald Trump, he's working for the people.
[02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:27.480]  He wants to work for the people.
[02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:29.280]  He's worried about that American worker.
[02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:31.280]  He want our jobs here.
[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:33.560]  We cannot just be a service country.
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:35.680]  We need to have our manufacturing back home.
[02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:39.000]  We want people not under-employed, but gainfully employed.
[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.920]  We want people to have opportunities where they're coming up, where we can create middle
[02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:45.960]  class, upper middle class, even some rich people.
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:50.240]  And that type of prosperity makes the elite even richer, but the corrupt elite don't want
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:51.240]  that.
[02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:52.240]  They want control.
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:53.240]  And Trump wants prosperity.
[02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:54.240]  Trump wants prosperity.
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:55.240]  For all of us.
[02:20:55.240 --> 02:20:56.240]  And we don't want another broke president.
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:20:57.240]  No, we don't.
[02:20:57.240 --> 02:21:02.240]  We want our president selling the front of those checks, not the back of those checks,
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:03.240]  baby.
[02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:04.240]  That's right.
[02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:08.840]  And I say this all the time, if you ever want to know what's wrong with the body of people
[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:09.840]  look at the head.
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:10.840]  That's right.
[02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:14.440]  If the head is broke and broken, then the body of people is going to be broken, broken.
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:18.840]  So if someone like Donald Trump came in and he's prosperous and successful, then the
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:21.040]  body of people will be prosperous and successful.
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:22.040]  That's right.
[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:24.320]  And that's why we're looking at Donald Trump to vote for him.
[02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:25.920]  Well, it's a fundamental difference.
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:26.920]  America's never been perfect.
[02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:28.440]  The reason it was better than other.
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:32.960]  It was about letting everybody be free and have a shot, even though it was hard.
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:36.960]  And that's why it built so much prosperity, socialism and collectivism as a disaster.
[02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:38.240]  Look at Bernie Sanders.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:42.480]  Look at Hillary, but also look at Hillary who ran for governor with her husband with
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:43.480]  rebel flags.
[02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:45.680]  I'm not getting into the rebel flags and bashing them.
[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:51.080]  But the point is, and all of her Dixie Mafia and Klan connections and Robert Byrd.
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:56.280]  I mean, it's just a fact that my grandfather ran as a Republican and won when he got back
[02:21:56.280 --> 02:22:00.200]  from World War Two and had the Klan basically threatened him in East Texas because he was
[02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:01.320]  for civil rights.
[02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:03.920]  It was the Republicans that passed the Civil Rights Act.
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:04.920]  And I just don't get none.
[02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:05.920]  The Republicans haven't been perfect.
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:07.120]  There's been some racist Republicans.
[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:11.480]  But how they inverted reality and turned it into the Democrats are the ones that are
[02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:14.920]  anti-racist when they're the ones playing both sides.
[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:18.200]  And I think it's time to expose Hillary and the rest of it, but her, her comments about
[02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:22.880]  black people being super predators and they got to be made to heal like a dog.
[02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:25.120]  Imagine if Donald Trump had ever said something like that.
[02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:26.120]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:27.120]  We wouldn't hear the last of it.
[02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:28.120]  We wouldn't hear the last of it.
[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:29.600]  But we're not worried about Hillary Clinton.
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:30.600]  We're worried about her.
[02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:33.320]  We need to know which one of you all we got to go up again.
[02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:34.320]  That's right.
[02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:37.120]  We don't already been on that Democratic plantation, but we know what it's like.
[02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:38.120]  That's right.
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:40.760]  So we got a lot to say when it comes to the general election.
[02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:41.760]  Who's more scary?
[02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:42.760]  Hillary or Bernie?
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:43.760]  Probably Hillary.
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:44.760]  Both of them.
[02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:45.760]  Both of them.
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:46.760]  Both of them look scary.
[02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:47.760]  Both of them.
[02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:48.760]  Yes.
[02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:49.760]  Bernie want to give everything away.
[02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:54.200]  And all he's doing is teaching people to rob children, to rob Peter to pay Paul.
[02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:57.920]  You can just throw something on the credit card and don't worry about paying it back.
[02:22:57.920 --> 02:23:00.800]  And Hillary, I don't even know why she run it.
[02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:03.920]  You know, they don't get to play musical chairs with the presidency.
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:04.920]  That's right.
[02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:06.920]  And already had a Clinton that unmasked things off.
[02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:09.200]  It's time for the Clintons to go home and sit down.
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:10.200]  And sit down.
[02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:11.200]  Yeah.
[02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:12.920]  You ladies are on fire.
[02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:16.840]  And again, Maryam, you pop it any time you want, but you got the floor.
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:18.760]  We got like six, seven minutes left to break.
[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:19.920]  I appreciate you coming on.
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:20.920]  Is that what he asked?
[02:23:20.920 --> 02:23:23.640]  And the question is, lady, you guys just turn it loose.
[02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:25.760]  In fact, let's go first.
[02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:29.360]  We're on the right with Silk, Silk, you spent about three minutes with what you think's
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:30.360]  most important.
[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:36.880]  Well, what I think most important is we need our jobs back here in America, period.
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:42.120]  When you've got people working and they're able to feed their families, take care of
[02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:45.560]  their household, then they will feel a hole again.
[02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:49.480]  Right now, when you lose it, if you don't use it, you will lose it.
[02:23:49.480 --> 02:23:53.880]  Men, we need to have muscles, so it's time for them to get back to work.
[02:23:53.880 --> 02:24:01.240]  Women, it's time for all of us to get back to work and build our family union.
[02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:07.920]  It's time for people to stop allowing people to race bait them by staying stuck in the
[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:15.120]  pains of your ancestors, staying stuck in the pain of racism, staying stuck in the pain
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:16.120]  of hate.
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:22.680]  It's time to get out of the womb and get in reality because the more you look at the
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:25.760]  past, you're missed out on the present.
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:30.520]  It's time for us to move forward and you can't move forward looking backwards.
[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:31.520]  That's right.
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:34.760]  Well, Nietzsche said that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger and I'm not glad
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:37.800]  about the bad things that happened to me in my life, but quite frankly, I look back and
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:39.880]  compare people that have that bad stuff happen to them.
[02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:40.880]  They're not as strong as I am.
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:43.760]  So I'm not saying, you know, feel bad for bad stuff that's happening.
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:47.040]  I realize if you survive, it only makes you stronger.
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:48.040]  That's right.
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:49.040]  You can't stay stuck in it.
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:50.040]  You stay stuck in the stool.
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:51.800]  You're going to stay stuck like you are.
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:52.800]  And we are not victims.
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:53.800]  That's right.
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:59.440]  And all of us that came here, white, black, Hispanic, we all inherited what's been going
[02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:00.440]  on.
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:01.440]  That's right.
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:02.440]  So let's take this here.
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:03.440]  Let's move forward.
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:05.600]  You know, you don't fight change.
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:06.600]  You make change.
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:07.600]  You make change.
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:08.600]  How do we make change?
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:09.600]  That's right.
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:12.680]  If it seems like there's a racial divide in something, how do we come and bridge the
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:13.680]  gap?
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:14.680]  That's right.
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:15.680]  Because at the end of the day, we all want the same thing.
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:16.680]  We do.
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:17.680]  And we all got to live in this world together.
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:18.680]  Yes.
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:19.680]  And the media has been dividing us.
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:20.680]  That's right.
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:25.080]  The white supremacists and the black supremacists and the Hispanic ones that the media matters
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:28.600]  and George Soros are involved with, they hope we all just fight with each other and
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:31.920]  keep killing each other like Bob Marley said, because that's all they got.
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:34.280]  Listen, there's seven and a half billion people on this planet.
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:35.280]  We're all in this together.
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:41.000]  And as soon as we figure out that we all want prosperity and security and a future and sovereignty
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.440]  is you're calling for men to return.
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:45.000]  I noticed that from her as well.
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.760]  Women want men and men want women.
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:49.560]  They want us all fighting with each other.
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:52.440]  All this faith feminism, all it's just garbage.
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:53.440]  Yes.
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:54.440]  Absolutely.
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:26:00.920]  And the only way for us to unite as one race is we have to stop segregating ourselves as
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:02.240]  a particular race.
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:05.560]  We have to realize we're only one race and that's the human race.
[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:09.520]  And that's what MSNBC wants is everybody scared to get involved with other groups.
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:11.160]  They want us to put up our own walls.
[02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:14.960]  They want us to self-segregate because they are, they are so evil.
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:17.560]  What do you let us think about like MSNBC and the stuff they say?
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:19.560]  Look, that's the mainstream media.
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:20.560]  I try to ignore them.
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:24.480]  I try to ignore them because you, you know what, they're going to be trained about to
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:25.480]  be cut off.
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:26.480]  That's right.
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:31.480]  Because as soon as this train gets going and everybody is looking towards unity, the
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:34.160]  media ain't going to have nothing ignorant to put out no more.
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:35.160]  That's right.
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:37.560]  So that's going to cut their finances and that's what they are afraid of.
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:38.560]  Yes.
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:41.880]  Some of these leaders like Al Sharpton and all these other leaders, Jesse Jackson, they
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:45.240]  won't have nowhere to run and get money from people.
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:50.400]  You talk about racists, they're out saying, Al Sharpton and others, that Clarence Thomas
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:51.400]  isn't black.
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:52.400]  I mean, what kind of statement is that?
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:53.400]  Well, I don't know, but we saw Clarence Thomas.
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:54.400]  He looked black.
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:55.400]  He looked black.
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:56.400]  He looked black.
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:26:57.400]  He looked black.
[02:26:57.400 --> 02:26:58.400]  No, he black.
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:26:59.400]  He black.
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:04.400]  Listen, but because Clarence Thomas is probably not singing to their tune.
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:05.400]  That's right.
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:07.920]  See, you got to understand what a race baiter really is.
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:12.200]  The only time we see the black leaders is when someone get killed because they can make
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:13.200]  money.
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:16.920]  So as long as these black boys are killing each other, you don't see a black leader.
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:17.920]  You don't see them.
[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:18.920]  You don't see them.
[02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:22.000]  So when it comes to these black leaders, I'm looking at them and I'm looking at them
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  with a side eye.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:27.840]  You know, if you really cared about the black community, you will be in the black community
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:28.840]  every day, all day.
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:29.840]  All day.
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:30.840]  Talking to our young boys.
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:34.280]  I was about to say, Obama, less visits to black areas than the other president before
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:37.800]  him in the last 50 years and then black unemployment doubles.
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:40.480]  It's almost like they took black people for granted and just said, we got you.
[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:41.480]  You're done.
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:46.400]  I mean, I can't imagine if I was the first black president, you know, forever percentage.
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:48.040]  I guess he might actually be African.
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:49.600]  I would really actually want to help people.
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:51.400]  It seems like they've wanted to screw over black people.
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:52.400]  Am I wrong?
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:56.360]  Well, I'm going to tell you this, Obama was the first African-American president.
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:27:58.200]  He did not bring in opportunities.
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:02.200]  Unemployment among the African-American community is extremely hot.
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:03.200]  He ran a hope and change.
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:04.200]  He ran a hope and change.
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:07.440]  People walking around here with no hope don't even have enough change to buy them a loaf
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:08.440]  of bread.
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:09.440]  That's right.
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:12.120]  I mean, should people be walking around here happy about that?
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:13.120]  All right.
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:14.120]  Final, final comment here.
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:15.120]  You ladies are amazing.
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:16.120]  I want to have you back up.
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:19.160]  This is what real folks that are outside the matrix look like.
[02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:20.160]  They're excited.
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:21.160]  They're angry.
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:22.160]  Just like I am.
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:23.160]  This is teleprompter free.
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:24.160]  They tell you, don't be angry.
[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:25.680]  That's because they're scared of us having energy.
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:27.560]  Like Howard Beale talks about a network.
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:30.040]  I want to have silk with some final comments.
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:31.040]  Silk.
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:35.240]  Well, all I can say is people don't want to Obama phone.
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:36.240]  Give us a job.
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:37.680]  We can get our own phone.
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:42.400]  Keep in mind that this is the United States, not the divided states.
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:44.920]  And it's time for us to unite as one.
[02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:47.560]  Keep in mind, one race, that's the human race.
[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:48.560]  Absolutely.
[02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:51.000]  And ladies, folks can find you at diamondsandsilk.com.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:54.440]  Miriam, do you want to say anything in closing these ladies?
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:55.440]  Yes.
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:59.040]  I want to say diamond and salt.
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:02.440]  Thank you so much for support.
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:08.680]  Donald Trump, you represent Afro-American.
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:18.360]  I represent Hispanic, Latino, American citizen, and this man, Donald Trump, he's the one
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:23.280]  representing every race and every nationality in the United States of America.
[02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:26.520]  She got so excited when she saw you pop up on the TV screen, she didn't know you were
[02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:27.520]  coming on.
[02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:28.520]  Ladies, thank you so much.
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:29.520]  He's his lead.
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:30.520]  He's surging right now.
[02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:32.760]  We've got stories on infowords.com, they're panicking.
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:36.160]  The more they attack, the more he surges, his polls are exploding.
[02:29:36.160 --> 02:29:37.160]  We'll be back on the other side.
[02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:41.000]  Don't forget, the biggest sale in our history is going right now and it's not at midnight.
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.480]  It's the leap year sale, 30% off in free shipping.
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:48.520]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:52.280]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.280 --> 02:30:01.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network, the what could lead to another world war.
[02:30:01.480 --> 02:30:05.440]  Turkey is exponentially increasing its military presence on the Syrian border, according to
[02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:07.280]  journalists who caught it on tape.
[02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:10.800]  Tanks, shells, and other ammunition are being delivered to the Turkish positions, which are
[02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:14.320]  shelling Kurdish forces in Syrian territory, according to the reporters.
[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:18.000]  One of the journalists said, quote, the barrels of the tanks and self-propelled guns are pointed
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:21.120]  in the direction of the mainly Kurdish Syrian city of Kobani.
[02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:25.400]  The Kurdish locals who have been fighting back against ISIS for quite some time openly accused
[02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:27.400]  Turkey of being friends with the Islamic State.
[02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:31.440]  The locals described how Turkey and Islamic State forces have opened fire on locals trying
[02:30:31.440 --> 02:30:33.520]  to flee the area and then stolen their cars.
[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:37.320]  And one Turkish fighter revealed how Turkish tanks intentionally destroyed a house this
[02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:38.320]  past week.
[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:41.520]  The Turkish government said it would ignore the Syrian ceasefire brokered by the U.S.
[02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:43.840]  Russia, which took effect on February 27th.
[02:30:43.840 --> 02:30:48.120]  In fact, Turkey's Prime Minister even admitted that Turkey was supporting ISIS during a recent
[02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:49.440]  interview with Al Jazeera.
[02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:53.640]  He said, quote, if the Assad regime isn't able to control all its territories today,
[02:30:53.640 --> 02:30:56.120]  it's because of Turkish and some other country's support.
[02:30:56.120 --> 02:30:58.840]  This is Kit Nani just reporting for infoworse.com.
[02:30:58.840 --> 02:31:02.640]  Tell folks how you got introduced to supermail and then when superfemale came out.

[02:31:08.440 --> 02:31:09.440]  Talk about the effects.
[02:31:09.440 --> 02:31:11.200]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:12.920]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:31:12.920 --> 02:31:14.120]  I feel like I look better.
[02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:15.120]  I feel better.
[02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:16.120]  I feel sexier.
[02:31:16.120 --> 02:31:17.120]  I love it.

[02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.760]  tyranny and your support of the Info War.
[02:32:55.760 --> 02:33:09.680]  I salute you, none of this is possible.
[02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:18.600]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:26.120]  The entire global power structure that is run by the technocratic eugenicist is in full
[02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:34.440]  battle array against Donald Trump as a focal point of a worldwide populist movement.
[02:33:34.440 --> 02:33:38.840]  He's only empowering the populist movement, he's not sabotaging it.
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:43.720]  If I saw him doing that, I would say it was a very sophisticated operation, it's not.
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:48.120]  This is organic, just like we are and people can't believe that info wars is organic and
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:49.120]  real and original.
[02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:50.120]  It is.
[02:33:50.120 --> 02:33:52.880]  That's 20 plus years of the making.
[02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:58.280]  Donald Trump understands that an epic time is here and they're fighting oligarchs and
[02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:04.280]  he put that out in a letter that we posted at infoworse.com that was sent to the press.
[02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:08.480]  I want to go to your phone calls here and then get to the latest Islamic invasion news
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:13.840]  that is all part of the globalist plan to implode the West and have us in fighting with
[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:14.840]  each other.
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:23.120]  That's the scorched earth diversion where bank robbers will burn down a grocery store,
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:29.080]  have somebody set a fire at a grocery store while they rob the bank down the road.
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:34.920]  This is a classic operation, this is world conquering event happening.
[02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:43.920]  This is world government, this is takeover by stealth, trojan takeover and it's amazing
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:47.120]  people get obsessed with who they support or who they don't support.
[02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:51.000]  You've never seen me this involved in an election, not even with Ron Paul.
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.640]  I knew we were building a liberty movement with Ron Paul, he had some small chance of
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:57.880]  winning but they were cheating him and stuff and playing dirty tricks and he wasn't as
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:34:59.440]  charismatic as Trump.
[02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:03.760]  He was better when it came to policies but he hadn't captured the public's attention.
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:07.480]  So yeah, I'm up here electioneering.
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:12.560]  I mean I can see it's all in, I'm not going to take the safe road and sit on the sidelines.
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:16.480]  The system is so angry about what I'm doing, we have some of the top stories in the country
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:23.960]  the last five days with the Koch brothers, 75 million to take down, Trump, the left makes
[02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:26.880]  them like the ultimate boogeyman.
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:30.240]  Anyone that's against turning their guns in must be fine as for the Koch brothers.
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:33.600]  The Koch brothers finance the controlled right that runs everything.
[02:35:33.600 --> 02:35:37.560]  They're there to keep the republic in establishment in place, Trump's challenging all that.
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:42.000]  They go share your thought about the Koch brothers, I'm an electioneer superior to you,
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:51.440]  I can say Koch brother, from the Chinese murderings communist to the Mexican former president
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:54.720]  to the corrupt British government to just everybody they're against Trump.
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:36:00.440]  It's so obvious and now they're calling for killing.
[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:03.800]  I wonder how all you Trump people are going to feel when they blow his airplane up or
[02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:09.080]  if they do or they shoot him.
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:13.880]  They are so upset because they know he'll do whatever he thinks is best and they run
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:17.520]  this country already and they don't like it, this oligarchy that Trump's put a letter
[02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:18.520]  out about.
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:22.320]  We're going to break the power of the oligarchy, the so-called masters of the universe is
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:24.240]  what they call them at Davos.
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:30.840]  He didn't go to their Davos meetings, he's not in their club, he's what they've worried
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:36.800]  about, a rogue billionaire capturing the populist attention.
[02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:41.840]  The only danger is maybe he is somebody like Napoleon that wants to take over for himself.
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:44.320]  Well, we'll deal with that at that point.
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:49.000]  We know the enemy that currently is on top of us that's been invisible, that's because
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:52.720]  they've been invisible because the public wasn't aware of how stuff really worked, they're
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:58.920]  now being uncloaked and we are within millimeters of an open debate about America being occupied
[02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:05.960]  by globalist forces and then it's game over as I keep hammering.
[02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:10.640]  The problem is they live offshore, the globalists are more than willing to wreck the whole country,
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:13.120]  they'll just buy it up cheaper later.
[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:19.160]  They will false flag and blame it on Trump supporters or Liberty supporters and I'm telling
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:22.640]  you we're entering that right now.
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:27.840]  Donald Trump, like I'm going to call Stone and some of the other people, he's got to
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:31.560]  come out and talk about Oklahoma City, he's talked about 9-11 and talk about the Clintons
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:35.600]  and how they bare minimum knew in the Southern Parvy Law Center and how that was done to
[02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:40.240]  blame the Republican-Conservative Revolution in 94-95 because I'm just looking at everything
[02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:47.200]  in line right now and the Klan stuff's not going to work, none of it's going to work.
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:48.440]  False flag.
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:55.680]  We have now entered the absolute prime zone.
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:02.080]  Through these primaries and if he gets it, which he is, and up against Hillary, his plain
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:11.360]  malfunctions, he gets shot by Mexican Mafia or something to create racial division, a
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:17.600]  crazy schizophrenic, but maybe not that that's too obvious, no they false flag.
[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:20.760]  That's another big question, we should do a whole show on that, also want to do a show
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:23.720]  of people that lived in socialist and communist countries, all the worlds they can call in,
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:28.520]  tell you how great it is, you know, on screen calls, I want to go to your calls right now.
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:34.760]  Your funding makes all this possible so that's a great thing, the reporters, the news articles
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:42.000]  and you know with Infowars, the videos, the reports, that we are kicking globalist booty.
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:46.400]  Last week we had the number one story about the making fun of Scalia's death of Obama,
[02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:49.920]  Google said number one story that day, then we had a story that was number three over
[02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:55.080]  the weekend was DrudgeReport.com linked to it, it was viral on Infowars.com and that
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:39:02.280]  was the Koch brothers lineup, 75 million to stop Trump and back Rubio.
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:06.560]  I mean that's two articles in a week that are at the top of the charts, mainstream media
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:13.320]  can't do that, you are funding this and you are putting your money and your and your word
[02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:19.560]  of mouth and you're voting with your feet towards us that is causing absolute devastation
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:23.160]  to the globalist on so many fronts, people all over the world are listening, that's what
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:28.800]  I find in Latin America and when I'm out in California, Hispanics run up to me and oh
[02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:33.720]  we love you, I don't hate to be almost racist but it's like the white people and some of
[02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:39.160]  the blacks but the white, they don't even know what planet they are on and I've said
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:44.240]  that it's weird, it's like the third world populations that aren't citizens so I think
[02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:47.160]  the Democrats might have miscalculated but I guess the ones that get the voters socialist,
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:51.000]  I don't know what's going on but it's actually the people that came from third world countries
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:56.800]  that know how corruption works that know the show's accurate so it's really weird, like
[02:39:56.800 --> 02:40:00.880]  I'm bashing illegals all the time but they seem to be more away and I'm bashing the cops
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:05.440]  but they're more away and I'm bashing the military sometimes, they're more away, it
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:09.200]  really is Americans that are of black, white, Hispanic, that matter that have been raised
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:13.880]  in liberty that don't appreciate it and now we're going into tyranny but here's what
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:18.680]  I'm getting at, we're running the biggest sale in our 21 year history, I realized when
[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:21.160]  I came up with the numbers last week, they said hey it ought to be leap year, it's like
[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:25.000]  Black Friday, a lot of folks are doing it, we got a lot of inventory right now, some
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.840]  stuff's sold out but we got big orders out of this stuff, are you willing to do a 25%
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:33.640]  off and free shipping and I said well we did that before, I said let's do 30% off and
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:38.480]  free shipping and they said okay, on top of the discounts that are already there and I
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:45.320]  said yeah, so this is heads above the rest, no special like this ever, this is the leap
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:48.760]  year special, only comes around every four years, we never done a leap year special before,
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:52.280]  it ends tonight at midnight and they're like Alex, you said you wouldn't extend it but
[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:56.440]  man this is really helping funding operation and get folks great deals, can you extend
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:41:00.520]  it one day and I said nope, because see I usually start something, don't promote it
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:05.880]  and then add a few days on because I don't really promote it but this time I started
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:10.440]  it on Friday instead of Monday, so I already extended it by starting it earlier and we're
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:17.160]  about to sell out of a bunch of items, so we have to end the special but for late night
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:22.120]  listeners I'll extend it until show time, tomorrow at 11am and then the special is gone,
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:27.220]  we'll have some other targeted specials just than what we have left, we are about to have
[02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:31.280]  a bunch of stuff, I have to give you the proviso that will no longer be on sale because we
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:35.120]  have to hold back a little bit for folks that get 10% off additional signing up for auto
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:38.040]  ship, so the only way to get a lot of this stuff that's selling out is to sign up for
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:43.480]  auto ship, supermails sold out, DNA force sold out, sign up for auto ship, we have reserves
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:47.360]  right there, 10% off, you can get those items that are sold out because we have to hold
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:52.440]  that reserve for auto ship folks, we keep a surplus there, small surplus, but right
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:57.400]  now is the time to get the biggest sales in our history and find the true tip of the

[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:31.200]  by the way a lot of our stuff is sold less than Amazon because I run really hard bargains
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:37.160]  with suppliers, I mean some of our deals out there are even better than Amazon and nobody
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:42.200]  can do that, that's how aggressive I am, these deals now are head turning, you should tell
[02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:47.360]  neighbors, friends and families about it today because it really is that good.
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:50.640]  And then the funds we do get out of this, you're gonna see reporters covering the rest
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:55.480]  of the election, the RNC, the DNC, Davos, Lee Ann wants to go down and cover some stuff
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:42:58.760]  going on in South America, I gotta get her a bodyguard but I'll send her down there,
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:02.800]  I mean I'm asking my reporters, I want your passion, what are you ready to do?
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:03.800]  What do you wanna do?
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:07.400]  And we're gonna get more reporters and more writers, we're just gonna up our game here
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:12.400]  in our pledge to you and also finally it's even more important to pray for the broadcast,
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:17.320]  send out the free links to videos, articles, that's where we really have the big effect.
[02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:22.880]  And if you are a local listener on AM and FM, tell friends and neighbors and co-workers
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:28.360]  about the show, send them links, tell them did they listen, become a local sponsor, support
[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:31.240]  the local sponsor, let them know you're supporting.
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:36.080]  That's the real power of the transmission, okay.
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:41.360]  I wanna just go to your phone calls but then I've got to get to the latest Islamic jihad
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:45.600]  behaviors, I mean women shopping four-year-olds heads off and running around yelling on a
[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:51.960]  hot bar, raping, murdering, tearing down fences, attacking, just total insanity, this is a
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:54.480]  global takeover.
[02:43:54.480 --> 02:44:04.800]  And Obama's on the news saying, oh, we don't, we don't have enough refugees, we need to
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:09.320]  bring more in, but not letting governors and folks know how many are here.
[02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:12.280]  We did a reports car accident at months ago, he should probably do a follow-up report or
[02:44:12.280 --> 02:44:19.960]  somebody should, it was a report report, 320 something people refugees from Syria and Iraq
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:26.200]  at one school in one year where the school of 2,000 people is almost collapsing because
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:30.040]  of all the Arabic speakers that don't speak a lick of English in there.
[02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:35.040]  And that's just their kids at Anderson High where I went, so we called around to other
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:36.040]  high schools.
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:41.480]  Oh, we got 200 here, we got 100 something here, the whole town, they claim it's 50 something
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:48.000]  in Texas, it's thousands in Austin, kids alone, we have no idea, it's just like it took us
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:51.880]  a year to find out that the borders were open again, Jakari and Don Salazar broke that.
[02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:55.280]  I'll send them back down to the border for a follow-up where they're on take one, yeah,
[02:44:55.280 --> 02:45:00.600]  the board patrol ships them in, we give them the IDs, you know, we give them the vouchers,
[02:45:00.600 --> 02:45:02.400]  just let them in.
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:07.680]  And now the Justice Department in New York, in Illinois, in Florida, in California is
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:13.960]  saying we're going to help illegals vote, the lawlessness, this is a takeover.
[02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:17.120]  And then we're like, hey, you can't, and they go, shut up, racist white person, and I'm
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:20.080]  like, well, I never really thought of this white stuff, I'm into freedom and private
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:24.560]  property, but don't attack me because of what color I am, but you're racially organizing
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:27.120]  this, but it's big banks doing it, it's so chilling.
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:32.560]  Blake, Phil, Keith, Robert, Hal, we're going to all of you, let's go ahead and talk to
[02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:37.000]  Phil in Florida, anyone want to talk about Rubio, Rubio's talking about how Donald Trump
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:42.920]  has small hands, you know what that means, I don't know, I got smaller hands from my
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:48.880]  body size, but that stereotype isn't true, and then, you know, saying he's a con man,
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:54.240]  you know, it's really devolving, but I mean, you know what, all's fair in love and war.
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:59.840]  You're a phirangi, and you say Donald Trump has a small, you know, wee-wee, and reportedly
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:03.960]  that's what you're into outside, I mean, what we've heard in the inquire outside bathrooms
[02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:05.200]  at night when the police arrest you.
[02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:09.320]  So maybe you are an expert on Donald Trump's package, Rubio, I'm sorry to talk like that,
[02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:13.240]  but he's the one with the presidential rights saying it, so I got to cover it, it's a family
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:15.200]  show, Phil in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:20.920]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to say, I agree with you 100% on that, I think the idea that
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:29.280]  Marco Rubio's calling Donald Trump a con man is ridiculous, because Donald Trump is so
[02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:34.800]  popular because the Republican Party has already been taken over by con men.
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:39.680]  Well, that's right, they are a filthy, hated, disgusting group of trash, and the filthy
[02:46:39.680 --> 02:46:45.520]  Koch brothers are crapping all over everyone right now, and if Republicans don't get behind
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:47.480]  Trump and libertarians, they're morons.
[02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:51.560]  They want to be purists like Pharisees, you know, sitting there complaining, then go
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:52.560]  ahead and be losers.
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:56.720]  It's so obvious that Trump is the juggernaut.
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:47:02.960]  I mean, he's the due sex, he's there, but they're always looking for the perfect thing.
[02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:07.400]  They're dream man, that's what Rubio's looking for, he looks for dream man, and nothing wrong
[02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:10.200]  with the fact that Rubio hangs outside bathrooms at night, I mean, I'm not saying that's even
[02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:13.880]  bad, I'm even judging, that's not my cup of tea, whatever you're into, buddy, I'm a libertarian.
[02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:16.720]  Just don't talk, you know, we know you're obsessed with Donald Trump's, why do you think
[02:47:16.720 --> 02:47:19.000]  you're obsessed with Donald Trump's sexual organs?
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:23.840]  Well, I think that part of that has to do maybe with that business venture or whatever
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:30.760]  it was that they were engaged in in that bathroom down there, but aside from that, the Bush
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:36.280]  clip that you showed of him slitting a throat for Donald Trump there, I think that it's
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:42.120]  pretty much most rational people can look at this satanic individual now.
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:47.320]  Oh, it's like a giant goblin, he looks like a huge water balloon, pumped full of rotten
[02:47:47.320 --> 02:47:49.760]  children's blood or something.
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:57.120]  A demodus rotting flesh, and it's pretty obvious that he's at least partially responsible for
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:03.720]  the JFK, RFK assassinations, the attempt on Ronald Reagan's life, and may have actually
[02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:04.720]  been partially responsible.
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:08.560]  Oh, I was absolutely involved, I mean, I risked my life even getting into that subject, I'm
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:09.560]  absolutely right Phil.
[02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:14.760]  Look, look, look, look, Rubio has got connections to drug dealers that are serious, weird gay
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:19.000]  porno production things with the guy he got arrested with, that's why they want him, they
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:24.440]  got him on a short leash, and he's not from Cuba, folks, he's from the Feringi capital
[02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:25.440]  in deep space.
[02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:30.480]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Keith in Florida, also from Florida, you're on
[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:31.480]  the air worldwide.
[02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:32.480]  Alex.
[02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:33.480]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:33.480 --> 02:48:41.080]  Yes, this is not a joke, I've been listening to you for years, and I got, my brother's a
[02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:45.840]  state trooper and he put me on, he like reported me to a government agency, and these people
[02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:50.160]  injected me three weeks ago, this is not a joke, I know I sound crazy, and my whole
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:55.360]  face is numb, my body's numb, my head's in extreme pain, and I believe they poisoned my
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:48:57.920]  mother too, I know I sound crazy, but this is here.
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:02.440]  Well, listen here's the thing, you gotta send us the information, because I can't, documentation,
[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:06.880]  you know, your admission forms, email it to us with an authorization to look into it,
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:10.040]  and then we will, sir, you wanted to talk about Mitt Romney, though.
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:13.840]  Yeah, well I knew I wouldn't get on if I didn't say that, can you give me the email to send
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:14.840]  it?
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:18.160]  Yeah, here's the deal, I appreciate your call, but we really don't screen calls, except
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:22.720]  when I say we're on a certain topic, and I sit calling about whatever you want, actually
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:28.320]  so, you know, it's the fact that you lied about what you were coming on with, you could've
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:31.200]  just said I want to talk about being drugged by the government, we know stuff like that
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:35.400]  goes on, and I'm not mad at you, just send me the info or it doesn't do anything, it's
[02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:38.800]  like we got a guy called and says, I'm at the military base where the mass shooter is,
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:42.640]  I want to report on what I saw, we do what CNN does and I go, we won't use it, but send
[02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:48.400]  us your military ID card and a picture ID, and then we check the phone, that it's that
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:51.440]  right area code, boom, then we have a source.
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:54.280]  We do what mainstream doesn't do, we try our hardest.
[02:49:54.280 --> 02:49:58.760]  Hal, in a former state, now in FEMA region three, you're on the air, Hal.
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:05.120]  Hi, I want to get in my comments quickly as I can, but let me start off by saying, I watch
[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:10.640]  every debate, I started off watching the Democratic, the Republican debates, and I've watched Trump
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:17.680]  go in my mind from about, you know, 5% to 20% to 50%, and then when he started talking
[02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:23.440]  about the definite no-go subjects, like 9-11, it brought me all the way up to about 95%,
[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:26.080]  I don't like the wall, but I mean, I know it's-
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:29.680]  I don't like the Apple stuff, I don't like the Trump stuff, no, exactly, here's the deal.
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:33.400]  We have direct conduits into Trump, not just us, the guy is fully waking up to the new
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:34.400]  world order.
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:36.680]  Can you imagine how scared they are with his phone's tap?
[02:50:36.680 --> 02:50:37.680]  Right.
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:39.920]  Stay there, I'm going to come back to you.
[02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:43.760]  Look, I saw them scared of him early on, I thought he might have been a show, tried
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:48.400]  to watching him, and, you know, look, look, look, look, it's not because he came on the
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:50.280]  show that I endorse him either.
[02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:54.560]  I mean, usually the endorsing candidates is not good for a broadcast, it's that it's
[02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:59.680]  all in, folks, it's game time, you can see it.

[02:53:43.800 --> 02:53:47.840]  designed medical kits and supplies for when help is not on the way.

[02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:04.120]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:54:04.120 --> 02:54:15.000]  All right, Hal, in FEMA Region 3, thanks for holding.
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:16.480]  Go ahead and finish your point.
[02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:20.880]  Yeah, I was saying how I've been seeing Trump go up in my mind.
[02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:27.080]  My support of him, you know, the 20, 50, 95% now that he's gotten the 9-11 topics
[02:54:27.080 --> 02:54:29.520]  covered that are no-go zones.
[02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:34.520]  And I just want to say, I know it's frustrating for you to get the info warriors fully behind
[02:54:34.520 --> 02:54:38.280]  the candidate because, you know, you're very informed and you know a lot of the things
[02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:42.800]  that are going behind the scenes, but we info warriors, we're skeptical by nature.
[02:54:42.800 --> 02:54:45.520]  That being said, brother, I am too.
[02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:50.280]  And look, I don't 100% trust Trump because he really is his own person and has some blind
[02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:51.800]  spots like all of us do.
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:52.800]  He's pretty old.
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:53.800]  He doesn't understand the Internet.
[02:54:53.800 --> 02:54:58.200]  I happen to know how he actually works now and he had known the Internet.
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:00.240]  He's having things printed off for him.
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:01.640]  He reads books.
[02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:05.120]  He knows about the globalist and he's literally just can't believe it.
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:06.600]  And now they're threatening him and stuff.
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:10.720]  So that he's coming out against the quote oligarchy and the global government.
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:15.800]  I mean, he's really getting a crash course now that they're doing all these dirty tricks
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:16.800]  to him.
[02:55:16.800 --> 02:55:22.000]  So he's so alpha male, he's loving the death battle because he realizes he'll be destroyed
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:23.560]  if he doesn't win now.
[02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:24.680]  And so he's just loving it.
[02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:26.560]  It feeds right into his personality.
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:34.080]  Okay, that's why I always tell folks get politically involved because then you'll be attacked and
[02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:35.360]  it doesn't make you weaker.
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:36.360]  It makes you stronger.
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:38.360]  It's the animating contest.
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:41.920]  And so the deeper Trump gets in, the more vicious he's going to get.
[02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:44.040]  It's just irrevocable damage to the globalists.
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:46.200]  Oh, it's devastatingly wonderful.
[02:55:46.200 --> 02:55:47.200]  I'm sorry.
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:48.200]  Go ahead.
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:49.760]  He's blowing down the facade.
[02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:50.760]  Go ahead.
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:58.280]  There's one thing in my mind that could get him to 99% support my view and it's an issue
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:02.160]  that's very important to me and I know it's very important to the Info Warriors and I'm
[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:03.160]  so glad I got off.
[02:56:03.160 --> 02:56:04.160]  Tell us the issue.
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:05.160]  Tell us the issue.
[02:56:05.160 --> 02:56:09.280]  We'll never, we'll never know until we find out it's the issue of Floyd and we Info Warriors,
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:14.080]  that's a big, big gun that we have against them because we are so informed about it.
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:17.120]  Well, he's come out and said that he thinks there's bad stuff in the vaccines.
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:22.480]  And so absolutely, you know, Trump could talk about water quality and all the rest of it.
[02:56:22.480 --> 02:56:26.560]  And again, sound kooky, but no, the people are already awake.
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:28.840]  The EPA has said take it out of the water.
[02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:30.600]  Now is the time for him to say that.
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:31.840]  I totally agree with you.
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:33.880]  And then when he gets attacked, it only makes you more popular.
[02:56:33.880 --> 02:56:36.880]  We're about to go to Bright, come back with a few more calls, I want to play this Leonardo
[02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:38.160]  DiCaprio clip.
[02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:40.920]  I think Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor.
[02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:45.480]  But to put out the line about we need to stop global warming, which means climate change,
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:47.240]  which means carbon tax.
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:52.280]  When he flies around on these jumbo jets all day, I mean, it's just so hypocritical and
[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:56.800]  it's so disconnected and it'll kill billions of people they put the carbon tax in.
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:01.080]  We also have until midnight tonight, I'm going to send it through to the morning, but that's
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:02.080]  it.
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:03.080]  That is it.
[02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:05.200]  Free shipping and 30% off all items, everything.
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:12.520]  We've never done that before at infowarstore.com or infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:14.240]  Take advantage of that.
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:17.000]  Here's up next here.
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.480]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Washington.
[02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:20.480]  You're on the air.
[02:57:20.480 --> 02:57:21.480]  Go ahead.
[02:57:21.480 --> 02:57:23.000]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:24.000]  Good, brother.
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:29.280]  Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you about what do you think Vice President's choice would
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:30.280]  be for Trump?
[02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:31.600]  Would be a good choice, do you think?
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:35.600]  I think Senator Sessions is excellent because they won't want to assassinate Trump and then
[02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:36.600]  get Sessions in there.
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:39.520]  It's probably even better when it comes to policy.
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:44.040]  I think Alabama, Senator Sessions, that way Trump's from the north.
[02:57:44.040 --> 02:57:45.800]  He's from the south.
[02:57:45.800 --> 02:57:51.520]  Then I think a cabinet, mainly former military generals and business leaders and basically
[02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:52.520]  no lawyers.
[02:57:52.520 --> 02:57:58.160]  Yeah, I haven't really done a lot of research on Sessions, but I did see him speak for Trump
[02:57:58.160 --> 02:57:59.160]  yesterday.
[02:57:59.160 --> 02:58:00.160]  He's great.
[02:58:00.160 --> 02:58:03.960]  He's held back the gun grabbing, the open borders.
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:04.960]  Sessions is good.
[02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:05.960]  Good stuff.
[02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:10.160]  What do you think about Ron Paul or maybe Judge Napolitano?
[02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:12.680]  Judge Napolitano would be good for the Supreme Court.
[02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:14.160]  I know that's being looked at.
[02:58:14.160 --> 02:58:17.240]  I wish I couldn't.
[02:58:17.240 --> 02:58:22.760]  Somebody told me that somebody saw the judge in New York who he likes and said, I get in,
[02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:26.840]  buddy, Supreme Court nominee and Napolitano said, you're kidding, right?
[02:58:26.840 --> 02:58:29.120]  And he said, no, I'm not kidding.
[02:58:29.120 --> 02:58:33.160]  Napolitano was like, wow, so that's going down.
[02:58:33.160 --> 02:58:34.920]  But Ron Paul's a total purist.
[02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:40.760]  He says he's not going to support Trump and I get me in a purist, but that's why I've
[02:58:40.760 --> 02:58:42.280]  got my vote as well and my support.
[02:58:42.280 --> 02:58:44.120]  I'll say all the voting's all fraud.
[02:58:44.120 --> 02:58:47.560]  Not if there's a landslide, none of the people exercise it, he's bringing in all those other
[02:58:47.560 --> 02:58:48.560]  voters now.
[02:58:48.560 --> 02:58:52.440]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:58:52.440 --> 02:58:57.560]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[02:58:57.560 --> 02:59:00.840]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:00.840 --> 02:59:06.120]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:06.120 --> 02:59:08.640]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:59:51.640 --> 03:00:08.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:08.520 --> 03:00:15.520]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.520 --> 03:00:29.720]  How do you get your children to listen to you?
[03:00:29.720 --> 03:00:34.360]  Speak very, very softly and act like you don't want them to listen.
[03:00:34.360 --> 03:00:38.960]  And they'll hang on every word.
[03:00:38.960 --> 03:00:41.600]  Oh, mother!
[03:00:41.600 --> 03:00:47.480]  What a time to be alive, father!
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:52.040]  Paul Watson is wading in the wings.
[03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:53.680]  What an amazing organization.
[03:00:53.680 --> 03:00:57.520]  We the people, you the viewers and listeners have helped build with the work of our great
[03:00:57.520 --> 03:00:58.520]  crew.
[03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:00.920]  We are the Info War.
[03:01:00.920 --> 03:01:05.720]  Worldwide promoting the ideas of renaissance and resistance to tyranny.
[03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:12.400]  It's called 1776 Worldwide to be strong and to be free.
[03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:19.800]  All right, let's get back into the news ahead of Paul Watson taking over.
[03:01:19.800 --> 03:01:22.840]  This is all up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:27.760]  Right now, Trump's lead exploding ahead of Super Tuesday.
[03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:29.280]  Isn't that just amazing?
[03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:33.520]  Every time Fox News, Rubio attacked Trump, Trump's lead grows.
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:40.640]  They did the whole made up, clan thing by cutting his audio off, the David Duke garbage,
[03:01:40.640 --> 03:01:41.640]  all of it.
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:43.240]  And now, Coke-funded senator.
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:46.000]  This just broke at infowars.com minutes ago.
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  Coke-funded senator.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:48.960]  It's a hit refresh on your computer.
[03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:55.040]  Coke-funded senator wants a new candidate to thwart Trump, confirms Roger Stone's warning
[03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:59.360]  of what happened in that secret Republican meeting last Thursday in New York City with
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:03.360]  the Feringi ambassador, Marco Rubio.
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:08.240]  So this is simply amazing, that article, up on infowars.com.
[03:02:08.240 --> 03:02:10.040]  I'm not going to get to Leonardo DiCaprio thing.
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:11.040]  Everybody already knows about it.
[03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:15.440]  He's going to be covering it some coming up, but there is just so much to get to.
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:19.000]  I want to cover briefly with Paul as I'm always getting into this, the whole Muslim latest
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:24.000]  orgy of death and head chopping of children inside the West and more.
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:29.160]  But right now, let's go to a phone call, folks holding patiently, Blake in Texas, your view
[03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:33.240]  on the Donald Trumpism phenomena.
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:40.800]  Yes, Alex, I was actually going to call in about something different, but you talked
[03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:47.800]  about Marco Rubio mentioning that Trump's hands are really small.
[03:02:47.800 --> 03:02:53.480]  And quite frankly, I think it's a great opportunity for Donald Trump to destroy Rubio, which is
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:03:00.760]  the global's chance at trying to get, trying to thwart Trump's chances.
[03:03:00.760 --> 03:03:04.600]  I think that Trump needs to bring up the whole gay issue with Rubio.
[03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:07.600]  I think if he did that, I think it would be a great chance.
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:12.960]  I agree, but Trump should say, hey, I'm not against gay people, which he said many times.
[03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:15.240]  Nice, fabulous people, work with them, blah, blah, blah.
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:16.920]  I just think marriage is between a man and a woman.
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:17.920]  You can have your own civil union.
[03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:22.120]  But I think he said, listen, Marco, we're not saying you're that, but you're the one
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:25.320]  obsessed with, you know, how big my, my, my wee wee is.
[03:03:25.320 --> 03:03:30.040]  Why don't we talk about, you know, you and your buddy that runs the gay porn company.
[03:03:30.040 --> 03:03:32.960]  You got arrested outside the bathroom at night at the park.
[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:33.960]  Why'd you get arrested?
[03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:36.560]  Do you think that might destroy Rubio?
[03:03:36.560 --> 03:03:38.240]  I think it would totally destroy Rubio.
[03:03:38.240 --> 03:03:41.800]  People, you know, I showed people the pictures.
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:46.280]  It's absolutely, you see the pictures of Wayne Madsen on his website.
[03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:50.720]  It's a bunch of guys dancing.
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:55.160]  One of them looks exactly like Rubio at a cocoa bro, a cocoa bro.
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:59.120]  You know, since we've gone this direction and since the inquires reporting on our reports
[03:03:59.120 --> 03:04:03.000]  that Madsen wrote, why don't we just get Madsen on tomorrow and have all the photos and bring
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:04.000]  the whole thing out here?
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:08.560]  Cause I think Hillary should be proud of her girlfriends if she's so liberal and I'm serious.
[03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:11.880]  I don't make this an issue and I think Rubio should be proud of, you know, everything he's
[03:04:11.880 --> 03:04:12.880]  involved in.
[03:04:12.880 --> 03:04:13.880]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:04:13.880 --> 03:04:14.880]  All right.
[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:15.880]  Good points.
[03:04:15.880 --> 03:04:16.880]  I appreciate.
[03:04:16.880 --> 03:04:17.880]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:17.880 --> 03:04:20.440]  Paul, we're going to break in 40 seconds, but let me just ask you this question.
[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:25.720]  Paul, just watching, what do you think of the whole Rubio, uh, you know, Chippendales
[03:04:25.720 --> 03:04:26.720]  connection?
[03:04:26.720 --> 03:04:27.720]  I don't know.
[03:04:27.720 --> 03:04:33.120]  I haven't looked into it, Alex, but it seems that the media is now trying to use Trump's
[03:04:33.120 --> 03:04:34.440]  own tactic against him.
[03:04:34.440 --> 03:04:39.400]  Of course, he's launched personal attacks on other candidates as a distraction because
[03:04:39.400 --> 03:04:40.960]  that's what he excels at.
[03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:45.360]  He keeps them on the ropes with these kind of personal attacks and distractions.
[03:04:45.360 --> 03:04:47.760]  So now the media seems to be doing that to Trump.
[03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:50.800]  They can't debunk him with his own statements and actions.
[03:04:50.800 --> 03:04:52.960]  But that only helps because they're hated.
[03:04:52.960 --> 03:04:54.960]  Here's the key equation.
[03:04:54.960 --> 03:04:55.960]  You're hated.
[03:04:55.960 --> 03:04:56.960]  You're trash.
[03:04:56.960 --> 03:05:00.960]  Everyone doesn't like you media.
[03:05:00.960 --> 03:05:01.960]  Shock poll.
[03:05:01.960 --> 03:05:04.240]  Hillary could lose to Trump in Democratic New York.
[03:05:04.240 --> 03:05:05.240]  That's right.
[03:05:05.240 --> 03:05:08.440]  Polling data shows Hillary Clinton could lose New York a Democratic stronghold to Donald
[03:05:08.440 --> 03:05:12.520]  Trump as the GOP frontrunner gains broad support across party lines.
[03:05:12.520 --> 03:05:17.040]  The poll results from Democratic and Republican legislative races have surprised virtually
[03:05:17.040 --> 03:05:20.880]  all the leading Democrats who have endorsed Clinton, while also energizing GOP leaders
[03:05:20.880 --> 03:05:22.160]  who are now warming up to Trump.
[03:05:22.160 --> 03:05:26.040]  And the results found that Clinton has higher negative ratings with New York voters than
[03:05:26.040 --> 03:05:28.920]  Trump, despite the fact she's served as a New York senator.
[03:05:28.920 --> 03:05:32.480]  Some of the polls also found much stronger loyalty amongst Trump's potential voters
[03:05:32.480 --> 03:05:36.800]  than along Clinton's, a finding that mirrors the record-breaking GOP turnouts and state
[03:05:36.800 --> 03:05:38.160]  primaries so far.
[03:05:38.160 --> 03:05:41.600]  In other words, Trump supporters will actually show up to the voting booth.
[03:05:41.600 --> 03:05:46.360]  This past weekend, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions endorsed Trump during a campaign rally.
[03:05:46.360 --> 03:05:50.280]  During the rally, Sessions lashed out at the Trans-Pacific Partnership and promised that
[03:05:50.280 --> 03:05:53.520]  amnesty will not be granted to illegals during a Trump presidency.
[03:05:53.520 --> 03:05:56.240]  This is Kit Daniels reporting for infowars.com.
[03:05:56.240 --> 03:06:04.040]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:06:04.040 --> 03:06:08.880]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[03:06:08.880 --> 03:06:11.720]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:06:11.720 --> 03:06:18.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.480]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:06:20.480 --> 03:06:24.880]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:06:24.880 --> 03:06:29.560]  Pathetogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[03:06:29.560 --> 03:06:30.560]  vitality.
[03:06:30.560 --> 03:06:34.480]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:06:34.480 --> 03:06:38.120]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.

[03:08:00.960 --> 03:08:12.400]  This is the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:12.400 --> 03:08:19.680]  I am handing the baton to Paul Joseph Watson, infowars.com, and principal.com editor extraordinaire,
[03:08:19.680 --> 03:08:22.880]  hailing from her Britannic Majesties London, England.
[03:08:22.880 --> 03:08:26.400]  And I'm going to get out of here in the next five minutes, but I wanted to get back on
[03:08:26.400 --> 03:08:31.480]  the election with him, but first, this is the Washington Examiner, White House wants to
[03:08:31.480 --> 03:08:36.120]  increase Syrian refugees in the US, and then it goes through their National Association
[03:08:36.120 --> 03:08:40.960]  of Counties, and how they're trying to get all that lined up.
[03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:45.040]  In Europe, three years ago, they said, oh, it's 100,000, it was really a million, then
[03:08:45.040 --> 03:08:47.360]  a million is really four million.
[03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:50.840]  Here it's oh, we want 10,000, then it was 100,000, then it was 300,000, then it was
[03:08:50.840 --> 03:08:51.840]  a million.
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:56.800]  They used the same formulas of bull, and they hide the real numbers.
[03:08:56.800 --> 03:09:05.040]  So I thought I'd go over the Daily Mail article, Har in Moscow, as Burkaclad babysitter, decapitates
[03:09:05.040 --> 03:09:11.040]  girl in her care, well, that's her culture, and it was a white child, and probably had
[03:09:11.040 --> 03:09:13.320]  some type of racial bias, and may have deserved it.
[03:09:13.320 --> 03:09:18.320]  I mean, you got a lot of other cultures, there's no such thing as a bad culture.
[03:09:18.320 --> 03:09:22.800]  The Aztecs, the Nazis, well, whatever, Har in Moscow was Burkaclad babysitter, decapitates
[03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:26.640]  girl in her care, then walks through the streets carrying her severed head, and shouting
[03:09:26.640 --> 03:09:34.520]  Allah Akbar, well, the answer's being knives, Allah Akbar, just a total whack job brought
[03:09:34.520 --> 03:09:37.320]  up in a death cult of a hobbyist, no doubt.
[03:09:37.320 --> 03:09:41.320]  Yeah, let's bring that in here, you know, men can't be men, you can't use the name
[03:09:41.320 --> 03:09:49.320]  mother or father, but let's chop heads off, and in sycophantic left, just loving it.
[03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:54.320]  Here's another one, migrants break down Macedonia fence on Greek border, a crowd of migrants,
[03:09:54.320 --> 03:09:57.960]  we used to be called invaders, has broken down a barbed wire fence on the Macedonia
[03:09:57.960 --> 03:10:02.800]  Greek border, using a steel pole as a battering ram, there's video of this, TV footage shows
[03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:06.640]  migrants pushing towards a fence, and it goes through ripping it down in the chaos, they're
[03:10:06.640 --> 03:10:11.200]  saying Sweden, France, the highways are collapsing, mugging, robbing, murder everywhere, oh, but
[03:10:11.200 --> 03:10:15.680]  if the liberals say it's good, and they have liberal women bringing them flowers, and TV
[03:10:15.680 --> 03:10:23.040]  crews are stabbed, raped, and robbed, literally, I mean, you talk about Europe wanting to commit
[03:10:23.040 --> 03:10:28.080]  suicide, it's doing it, you want to know what liberalism is, modern liberalism is suicide,
[03:10:28.080 --> 03:10:33.960]  self-hating, loathing, Swiss voters reject hard line initiative on criminal foreigners,
[03:10:33.960 --> 03:10:38.360]  that's right, even the Swiss that are more nationalist, Swiss info reports, they've said
[03:10:38.360 --> 03:10:43.360]  no, we're going to let criminals stay here and do everything horrible, there you go,
[03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:47.400]  rights groups, Saudi Arabia uses US cluster bombs on civilians, well that's okay on liberal,
[03:10:47.400 --> 03:10:52.480]  because it's Saudi Arabia and they own Fox News, and it just goes on from there, truly
[03:10:52.480 --> 03:10:57.520]  sickening, so before I get back to Trump here briefly, and the more they attack them
[03:10:57.520 --> 03:11:00.760]  or poplar it gets, the media thinks they're going to start personal attacks on him and
[03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:07.000]  say, you know, that he has baby hands or whatever, and all the rest of this garbage, before they
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:12.840]  do all that, they should understand, they're not Trump seen as the outsider, they are the
[03:11:12.840 --> 03:11:17.040]  hated loaves, scum, and filth of the earth that haven't figured out that the zombie
[03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:21.280]  media, the walking dead poles, we'll get to that in a moment, but first off, the orgy
[03:11:21.280 --> 03:11:28.440]  of Islamic raping, pool pooping, chopping of heads, robbing, all over Europe collapse
[03:11:28.440 --> 03:11:33.240]  happening, just foaming at the mouth, like day of the dead, running around robbing, the
[03:11:33.240 --> 03:11:37.200]  civil emergency, banning people's free speech to counter it, how is the end game going
[03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:41.920]  for Hollande, Merkel, and all the rest of the filth?
[03:11:41.920 --> 03:11:47.440]  Well Merkel now admits that she's got no plan B whatsoever, so she's basically at knowledge
[03:11:47.440 --> 03:11:53.880]  that it's been a complete disaster, but the economist says she's a genius, oh yeah, but
[03:11:53.880 --> 03:11:58.240]  now they've actually run out of space, there are no like luxury four-star hotels left, there
[03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:04.720]  are no cruise liners left, there are no disuse office buildings, now these office buildings
[03:12:04.720 --> 03:12:09.120]  where they're housing all these migrants are being attacked, shot at and burned down, because
[03:12:09.120 --> 03:12:14.880]  as I said, if you ignore legitimate concerns, you create a vacuum for extremists, that's
[03:12:14.880 --> 03:12:20.240]  now happening, exactly what I said would happen months ago, but still you've got the lefty
[03:12:20.240 --> 03:12:27.000]  virtue signalers like Jude Law, the actor, who went to the Calais jungle migrant camp,
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:32.640]  which is of course full of peaceful, tolerant people who stab, rob and rape each other all
[03:12:32.640 --> 03:12:37.760]  day, numerous incidents of that, so he visited this migrant camp as a big public relations
[03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:43.120]  scam, and his minders, his security guards, because of course these are lovely, peaceful,
[03:12:43.120 --> 03:12:46.440]  tolerant people, but you needed, you know, five security guards just to go near them.
[03:12:46.440 --> 03:12:50.560]  What I love is when they attack and stab and all this, the left worships it as a sacrament
[03:12:50.560 --> 03:12:56.440]  of love, and the hateful videos as they attack and stab, the left just loves it, what type
[03:12:56.440 --> 03:13:00.680]  of mentally ill scum are these, because we know the globalist master plan, but how have
[03:13:00.680 --> 03:13:04.920]  they turned the actual minions into such servile trash?
[03:13:04.920 --> 03:13:11.240]  Well, it's mass Stockholm syndrome, that's what it is, and so basically he went there,
[03:13:11.240 --> 03:13:17.360]  his minders, his security got attacked, got robbed, there are, you know, female volunteers
[03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:22.000]  for the migrants that go there routinely and get raped, they get told by their little left
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:27.640]  wing agitator groups, don't you dare talk about this because it discredits our narrative.
[03:13:27.640 --> 03:13:32.440]  So we're seeing it over and over again, of course, he's got a 15 million pound mansion,
[03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:36.320]  which is about $25 million in North London.
[03:13:36.320 --> 03:13:41.000]  He hasn't invited any refugees to stay in his $25 million mansion.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:42.760]  And Saudi Arabia hasn't either.
[03:13:42.760 --> 03:13:48.760]  No, they've got these 300,000 tents at Hodge, which they don't use for most of the year.
[03:13:48.760 --> 03:13:50.160]  They haven't accepted any refugees.
[03:13:50.160 --> 03:13:54.000]  But let's go past that, let me ask you this question, because I literally, at night in
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:58.240]  the morning when I'm getting ready for broadcast, I look at this news, I look at the response,
[03:13:58.240 --> 03:14:02.720]  and I can't believe it, it's so satirical, it's like a Kurt Vonnegut satire piece, dark
[03:14:02.720 --> 03:14:08.240]  satire piece, and they intend to increase it, and then I watch TV and they say fathers
[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:15.360]  are bad on every channel, and freedom is bad, I mean, the psychos running things, what is
[03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:20.840]  the end game, and how is it going for them, I mean, doesn't the left get that once there's
[03:14:20.840 --> 03:14:26.800]  an Islamic jihad, that's it, you know, that's it for them, I mean, is it just a suicidal
[03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:31.280]  nihilism, or do they hate Western prosperity so much, our own elite, that they just want
[03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:32.280]  to trash it all?
[03:14:32.280 --> 03:14:35.920]  I mean, why does a George Soros Nazi collaborator has gotten away with everything?
[03:14:35.920 --> 03:14:37.920]  Why does he want to ruin Europe and the US?
[03:14:37.920 --> 03:14:40.040]  Why are they such buckets of pus?
[03:14:40.040 --> 03:14:45.280]  Well, it's because, as he said, it's this kind of nihilism, but it's also the fact
[03:14:45.280 --> 03:14:50.440]  that they're virulent racists, I mean, when the green MP in Germany gets up in front of
[03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:55.800]  the parliament and says, German population, the native population will be replaced within
[03:14:55.800 --> 03:14:56.800]  30 years.
[03:14:56.800 --> 03:14:57.800]  And that's a good thing.
[03:14:57.800 --> 03:14:58.800]  And that's a good thing.
[03:14:58.800 --> 03:15:00.840]  That's a good thing.
[03:15:00.840 --> 03:15:06.840]  That's racism, it's self-hating racism, it's Stockholm syndrome, that's precisely what
[03:15:06.840 --> 03:15:07.840]  it is.
[03:15:07.840 --> 03:15:12.720]  So it's not just about importing huge groups as voting blocks, you know, business gets
[03:15:12.720 --> 03:15:14.520]  cheap labor, that's all part of it.
[03:15:14.520 --> 03:15:22.280]  They don't bring in like Lebanese or folks, you know, from Jordan or other areas that
[03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:25.520]  are known to be really smart, hardworking people that want to be Western.
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:31.400]  They bring in the literal gutter trash, Wahhabi is the worst of the worst that have been robbing
[03:15:31.400 --> 03:15:34.000]  and murdering all over the Middle East and they just bring them in.
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  What filth?
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:40.400]  No, I mean, you can look at the numbers and obviously the huge, the huge majority of people
[03:15:40.400 --> 03:15:45.760]  coming from Syria are Muslims, but those coming into America is basically a handful.
[03:15:45.760 --> 03:15:49.080]  It's 99% Wahhabi is too.
[03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:50.080]  Yeah.
[03:15:50.080 --> 03:15:54.000]  It's like 650 Muslims and two Christians coming into America.
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:57.520]  And like seven of them will be Shiite, yeah, I've seen the numbers.
[03:15:57.520 --> 03:15:58.520]  Yeah.
[03:15:58.520 --> 03:15:59.520]  So it's a tiny percentage.
[03:15:59.520 --> 03:16:03.400]  It's not proportionate with the amount of Christians that are coming out of Syria, which
[03:16:03.400 --> 03:16:07.560]  is a minority, but it's more than two out of 650.
[03:16:07.560 --> 03:16:11.560]  So it seems like they're deliberately not letting the Christians in and letting all
[03:16:11.560 --> 03:16:16.760]  these, you know, Sunnis in that prone to this extremism, which again, we've seen in Russia
[03:16:16.760 --> 03:16:18.560]  today in Moscow with this beheading.
[03:16:18.560 --> 03:16:19.560]  And you know, I'm surprised.
[03:16:19.560 --> 03:16:21.400]  Well, why not let her have her culture?
[03:16:21.400 --> 03:16:25.200]  I think liberals volunteer their children to be chopped off by a jihadist to show how
[03:16:25.200 --> 03:16:26.200]  liberal they are.
[03:16:26.200 --> 03:16:30.120]  I'm surprised that these sensitivity training for them to volunteer their kids to have their
[03:16:30.120 --> 03:16:31.120]  heads chopped off.
[03:16:31.120 --> 03:16:32.120]  Oh, no, exactly.
[03:16:32.120 --> 03:16:37.400]  I'm surprised that we're not already being lectured about, you know, how not all Muslim
[03:16:37.400 --> 03:16:41.360]  babies sit as behead kids and we need to hire more Muslim old pairs.
[03:16:41.360 --> 03:16:44.120]  Hey, hey, hey, Hillary says open the borders up.
[03:16:44.120 --> 03:16:45.720]  Maybe Chelsea's having a new baby.
[03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:47.880]  Maybe she can volunteer to send the baby to ISIS.
[03:16:47.880 --> 03:16:53.000]  Oh, every time we have an attack like the Paris massacre, again, they exploited the refugee
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:55.120]  program posed as refugees.
[03:16:55.120 --> 03:16:59.320]  The answer from the left is, well, we need more economic migrants.
[03:16:59.320 --> 03:17:04.400]  That's the solution because your race is simply for drawing attention to it, even though Islam
[03:17:04.400 --> 03:17:05.400]  is not a race.
[03:17:05.400 --> 03:17:06.880]  So again, we're going to see that.
[03:17:06.880 --> 03:17:10.080]  And even though when I was in London, they had Muslim immigrants I've never seen the
[03:17:10.080 --> 03:17:14.480]  likes of who wouldn't give anybody rides from the airport to their hotels and we're gouging
[03:17:14.480 --> 03:17:15.800]  three, four times what was demanded.
[03:17:15.800 --> 03:17:19.360]  And then I had a British guy pull up and he goes, no, I'll charge you the regular price.
[03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:20.760]  He goes, that's allowed.
[03:17:20.760 --> 03:17:21.760]  That's criminal.
[03:17:21.760 --> 03:17:22.760]  The country no longer exists.
[03:17:22.760 --> 03:17:24.480]  And he goes, they're mean to everybody.
[03:17:24.480 --> 03:17:27.480]  And that's the thing is I was in London again with you have been there a lot and there's
[03:17:27.480 --> 03:17:31.920]  literally Muslims that look like they're in the middle of like Saudi Arabia just stumbling
[03:17:31.920 --> 03:17:38.280]  around crazily in their outfits looking hateful at everyone just stomping around like psychos.
[03:17:38.280 --> 03:17:39.280]  You live there.
[03:17:39.280 --> 03:17:40.280]  What is it like?
[03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:45.120]  Well, obviously the ones that are assimilated are perfectly nice people, but that's not
[03:17:45.120 --> 03:17:46.800]  who they're bringing in.
[03:17:46.800 --> 03:17:51.280]  I mean, people are now being arrested simply for going down Luton, for example, which has
[03:17:51.280 --> 03:17:54.760]  a high Muslim population area and handing out leaflets.
[03:17:54.760 --> 03:17:59.120]  And yet you've got Muslims walking around near the houses of parliament literally stones
[03:17:59.120 --> 03:18:02.520]  throw away in full ISIS regalia.
[03:18:02.520 --> 03:18:06.480]  The police talk to them for like 30 seconds and they go on their way.
[03:18:06.480 --> 03:18:10.880]  People with ISIS flags and Jihad masks are allowed to, but Brits cannot go and have free
[03:18:10.880 --> 03:18:11.880]  speech anywhere.
[03:18:11.880 --> 03:18:12.880]  It's all on video.
[03:18:12.880 --> 03:18:13.880]  Paul, I'm going to get back into Trump.
[03:18:13.880 --> 03:18:14.880]  I'm handing the baton to you.
[03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:16.080]  We have the biggest sale ever.
[03:18:16.080 --> 03:18:20.880]  The leap your sale in tonight or in tomorrow morning, 30% off and free shipping on everything
[03:18:20.880 --> 03:18:22.360]  that's on top of their discounts.
[03:18:22.360 --> 03:18:23.640]  Your purchase supports the broadcast.
[03:18:23.640 --> 03:18:27.120]  Great time to get involved, take advantage and check out these incredible nutraceuticals
[03:18:27.120 --> 03:18:33.560]  like brain force, survival shield X2, super female vitality, winter sun, secret 12.
[03:18:33.560 --> 03:18:36.760]  But Trump again, the media is trying his tactics.
[03:18:36.760 --> 03:18:39.520]  Now it doesn't work because they're the walking dead.
[03:18:39.520 --> 03:18:40.720]  They're so arrogant.
[03:18:40.720 --> 03:18:41.720]  What happened?
[03:18:41.720 --> 03:18:45.320]  Haven't they figured out that the more they attack someone, the more that person's love.
[03:18:45.320 --> 03:18:50.680]  Don't they realize their filth and Benedict Arnold garbage that are universally reviled
[03:18:50.680 --> 03:18:53.040]  and are traitors?
[03:18:53.040 --> 03:18:57.040]  I think they're starting to realize it because as I said, they're now trying different tactics.
[03:18:57.040 --> 03:18:58.040]  It's not the media.
[03:18:58.040 --> 03:19:00.040]  All they got to do is endorse him and it's over.
[03:19:00.040 --> 03:19:03.240]  He's done, but they're too arrogant.
[03:19:03.240 --> 03:19:04.760]  They tried the David Duke thing.
[03:19:04.760 --> 03:19:09.520]  Now there's a secret service agent that's assaulted a reporter at a Trump rally today.
[03:19:09.520 --> 03:19:12.840]  So they're going to try and blame that on Trump.
[03:19:12.840 --> 03:19:18.080]  So it seems they're starting to shift tactic as I saw Fox today and seeing him both go,
[03:19:18.080 --> 03:19:20.520]  he has mafia ties, well known law enforcement.
[03:19:20.520 --> 03:19:21.520]  It's all come out.
[03:19:21.520 --> 03:19:22.520]  It hasn't come out.
[03:19:22.520 --> 03:19:23.520]  It's just made up.
[03:19:23.520 --> 03:19:24.520]  Yeah.
[03:19:24.520 --> 03:19:29.400]  But now you've also got neocons, they've got the things out there saying that, you
[03:19:29.400 --> 03:19:33.040]  know, they're going to vote for Hillary just to prevent him getting in office.
[03:19:33.040 --> 03:19:37.640]  Then Trump's going to run independent by the looks of it if they do abandon him.
[03:19:37.640 --> 03:19:41.280]  So they're going to end up with Hillary anyway, which is what Mr. Collins says he's happy
[03:19:41.280 --> 03:19:45.280]  for because they're the rhinos that have been destroying the country forever.
[03:19:45.280 --> 03:19:50.120]  Paul, I'm handing the baton to you, my friend, straight on the other side of this break.
[03:19:50.120 --> 03:19:51.680]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:19:51.680 --> 03:19:53.160]  It's only comes around every four years.
[03:19:53.160 --> 03:19:54.320]  It's the first time we've done it.
[03:19:54.320 --> 03:19:55.720]  It's the biggest sale ever.
[03:19:55.720 --> 03:19:56.840]  It's the leap year sale.
[03:19:56.840 --> 03:19:59.680]  It ends today in fourwarstore.com.
[03:19:59.680 --> 03:20:03.880]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better
[03:20:03.880 --> 03:20:07.440]  than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood
[03:20:07.440 --> 03:20:10.600]  sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[03:20:14.200 --> 03:20:15.200]  them.
[03:20:15.200 --> 03:20:16.760]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:16.760 --> 03:20:21.080]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects
[03:20:21.080 --> 03:20:22.560]  of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:22.560 --> 03:20:26.840]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary

[03:20:37.160 --> 03:20:38.960]  clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:20:38.960 --> 03:20:44.400]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics, so the body is an amazing thing.
[03:20:44.400 --> 03:20:47.640]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:20:47.640 --> 03:20:50.000]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[03:22:28.560 --> 03:22:31.760]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[03:22:31.760 --> 03:22:34.920]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[03:22:34.920 --> 03:22:37.240]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[03:22:37.240 --> 03:22:40.200]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[03:22:40.200 --> 03:22:41.200]  His excuse?
[03:22:41.200 --> 03:22:42.400]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[03:22:42.400 --> 03:22:44.000]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[03:22:44.000 --> 03:22:48.960]  At less than $107 per month, libertyoncall.org would have been the perfect alternative for
[03:22:48.960 --> 03:22:49.960]  my father.

[03:24:13.400 --> 03:24:17.520]  We are back on the fourth hour overdrive of the Alex Jones show with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:24:17.520 --> 03:24:19.040]  We're going to get more into Trump.
[03:24:19.040 --> 03:24:23.040]  I know Alex covered it at length during the show, but we're going to touch on that once
[03:24:23.040 --> 03:24:24.040]  more.
[03:24:24.040 --> 03:24:29.120]  We're also going to get into the fallout from the Oscars, of course, which was a three-hour
[03:24:29.120 --> 03:24:37.240]  exercise in virtue signaling on steroids, rich, self-satisfied, smug millionaires lecturing
[03:24:37.240 --> 03:24:42.800]  us all about our lifestyles while they fly between LA and New York on private jets.
[03:24:42.800 --> 03:24:48.480]  We're going to get into that, but as we mentioned before the break, horror in Moscow as Birka
[03:24:48.480 --> 03:24:53.040]  Cloud babysitter decapitates four-year-old girl in her care, then walks through the
[03:24:53.040 --> 03:24:57.920]  streets carrying her severed head and shouting, Allah Akbar.
[03:24:57.920 --> 03:25:02.800]  Now, obviously, the video of this is harrowing, it's blurred out in these articles.
[03:25:02.800 --> 03:25:07.840]  There's also another video, which I've seen, which is even more harrowing, which is the
[03:25:07.840 --> 03:25:13.920]  mother being told of this absolute horror and the scream is just bone-chilling.
[03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:17.800]  And, yes, the religion of peace strikes again.
[03:25:17.800 --> 03:25:22.920]  A Birka Cloud babysitter decapitated the little girl in her care before walking through
[03:25:22.920 --> 03:25:25.880]  Moscow carrying the child's severed head.
[03:25:25.880 --> 03:25:28.240]  The woman shouted, Allah Akbar.
[03:25:28.240 --> 03:25:33.440]  She appeared near a metro station in the northwest of the Russian capital and then threatened
[03:25:33.440 --> 03:25:37.120]  to blow herself up just to top it all off.
[03:25:37.120 --> 03:25:40.600]  She was making these other political comments as well.
[03:25:40.600 --> 03:25:47.680]  It was obviously motivated by her own personal g-hat, but again, as I said, maybe the solution
[03:25:47.680 --> 03:25:52.720]  to this is just to hire more Muslim babysitters.
[03:25:52.720 --> 03:25:58.440]  Maybe the regressive left will lecture us all on how not all Muslim babysitters behead
[03:25:58.440 --> 03:26:03.000]  kids as if anyone is making that claim in the first place.
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:07.800]  Remember the reaction to Cologne, the mass molestation of women on New Year's Eve.
[03:26:07.800 --> 03:26:14.160]  The reaction to the Paris massacre back in November was not to address the fact that
[03:26:14.160 --> 03:26:18.720]  there's a huge problem within Islam to do with intolerance and violence.
[03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:27.440]  The solution is simply to import millions of more Muslim refugees completely unassimilated.
[03:26:27.440 --> 03:26:32.120]  Even when they try and assimilate them in places like Denmark, which they've now started
[03:26:32.120 --> 03:26:38.760]  to do, they still repeatedly every single week have new cases of rape.
[03:26:38.760 --> 03:26:43.240]  And now we've got this again horrific incident in Moscow.
[03:26:43.240 --> 03:26:51.280]  The babysitter abducted the child, set fire to the apartment, beheaded her, and then for
[03:26:51.280 --> 03:26:58.200]  an hour, she was walking around Moscow with this severed head chanting alarakba, again
[03:26:58.200 --> 03:26:59.840]  the religion of peace.
[03:26:59.840 --> 03:27:06.680]  And this came straight after Jude Law, the actor engaged in his own act of virtue signalling
[03:27:06.680 --> 03:27:11.640]  by visiting the Calais jungle migrant camp, which of course is about to be parts of it
[03:27:11.640 --> 03:27:14.360]  are about to be cleared by the French government.
[03:27:14.360 --> 03:27:20.280]  These migrants are being transported into basically trailers, but Jude Law went to visit
[03:27:20.280 --> 03:27:26.040]  to try and pressure the British government for Britain to take in more of these refugees
[03:27:26.040 --> 03:27:31.720]  and import with them the peace and tolerance that has been so evident in the Calais migrant
[03:27:31.720 --> 03:27:38.960]  camp where every single week you hear stories about people being raped, people being robbed,
[03:27:38.960 --> 03:27:40.320]  people being stabbed.
[03:27:40.320 --> 03:27:47.520]  You've had pro refugee journalists go there and get attacked themselves and then blame
[03:27:47.520 --> 03:27:52.080]  it in one case on the British government for not letting them into Britain.
[03:27:52.080 --> 03:27:56.560]  So I guess it's okay if they're stabbing, raping and robbing so long as they're doing
[03:27:56.560 --> 03:28:01.560]  it in Britain, so long as we're the victims of it, that will even the balance somehow.
[03:28:01.560 --> 03:28:06.920]  So this moron went there with his minders, with his bodyguards, because of course this
[03:28:06.920 --> 03:28:11.680]  is a really good idea to bring these people into Britain because they're really tolerant
[03:28:11.680 --> 03:28:14.960]  and peaceful and won't try and stab you or rape you at all.
[03:28:14.960 --> 03:28:21.160]  He went in there with his crew of bodyguards, his bodyguards, his minders ended up getting
[03:28:21.160 --> 03:28:27.720]  stabbed and robbed during this charity visit, again replicating previous stories that we've
[03:28:27.720 --> 03:28:33.680]  talked about where these female volunteers, these extreme leftists who go to volunteer
[03:28:33.680 --> 03:28:38.040]  in these migrant camps, end up getting raped.
[03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:42.560]  And half the time they don't even report it, it comes out later through anecdotal stories,
[03:28:42.560 --> 03:28:47.640]  some of it gets reported, but the left-wing organisations that they work for tell them
[03:28:47.640 --> 03:28:54.000]  not to report it because it would discredit the narrative that these are peaceful, tolerant
[03:28:54.000 --> 03:28:57.040]  people that are going to fit into Western society.
[03:28:57.040 --> 03:29:02.880]  How many examples of rape, rob, stabbings are we going to need to see before the left
[03:29:02.880 --> 03:29:08.840]  finally realise that that's a terrible idea without some massive assimilation programme
[03:29:08.840 --> 03:29:15.400]  which is completely impossible if you're importing these people en masse, thousands and thousands
[03:29:15.400 --> 03:29:17.680]  of people at a time.
[03:29:17.680 --> 03:29:23.800]  And of course Jude Law isn't going to house any of those refugees personally in his $25
[03:29:23.800 --> 03:29:30.520]  million mansion in London because that sounds too much like hard work, same as Bob Geldof
[03:29:30.520 --> 03:29:35.840]  said right at the beginning of this crisis, this migrant crisis, that he would personally
[03:29:35.840 --> 03:29:42.440]  take into Syrian refugee families, well that was six months ago, he hasn't taken in anyone.
[03:29:42.440 --> 03:29:47.520]  Again, complete nonsense hot air, we'll be back with more on the fourth hour overdrive,
[03:29:47.520 --> 03:29:48.520]  stay with us.
[03:29:48.520 --> 03:29:59.360]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.360 --> 03:30:03.960]  That could lead to another world war, Turkey is exponentially increasing its military presence
[03:30:03.960 --> 03:30:08.160]  on the Syrian border according to journalists who caught it on tape, tanks, shells and other
[03:30:08.160 --> 03:30:11.920]  ammunition are being delivered to the Turkish positions which are shelling Kurdish forces
[03:30:11.920 --> 03:30:14.320]  in Syrian territory according to the reporters.
[03:30:14.320 --> 03:30:18.020]  One of the journalists said quote, the barrels of the tanks and self-propelled guns are pointed
[03:30:18.020 --> 03:30:21.120]  in the direction of the mainly Kurdish Syrian city of Kobani.
[03:30:21.120 --> 03:30:25.000]  The Kurdish locals who have been fighting back against ISIS for quite some time openly
[03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:27.400]  accused Turkey of being friends with the Islamic State.
[03:30:27.400 --> 03:30:31.480]  The locals described how Turkey and Islamic State forces have opened fire on locals trying
[03:30:31.480 --> 03:30:33.400]  to flee the area and then stolen their cars.
[03:30:33.400 --> 03:30:37.320]  And one Turkish fighter revealed how Turkish tanks intentionally destroyed a house this
[03:30:37.320 --> 03:30:38.320]  past week.
[03:30:38.320 --> 03:30:41.520]  The Turkish government said it would ignore the Syrian ceasefire brokered by the US and
[03:30:41.520 --> 03:30:43.880]  Russia which took effect on February 27th.
[03:30:43.880 --> 03:30:47.320]  In fact, Turkey's Prime Minister even admitted that Turkey was supporting ISIS.
[03:30:47.320 --> 03:30:51.720]  During a recent interview with Al Jazeera, he said quote, if the Assad regime isn't able
[03:30:51.720 --> 03:30:55.520]  to control all its territories today, it's because of Turkish and some other countries
[03:30:55.520 --> 03:30:56.520]  support.
[03:30:56.520 --> 03:30:58.520]  And he was reporting for infowars.com.
[03:31:26.520 --> 03:31:45.480]  And
[03:31:45.480 --> 03:31:49.920]  finally from yours truly Alex Jones to all the patriots of every race, color and creed

[03:34:17.700 --> 03:34:22.020]  We're going to get back into Trump now because of course the media has come up with this
[03:34:22.020 --> 03:34:28.740]  genius new anti-Trump tactic, of course they've tried and failed every time to go directly
[03:34:28.740 --> 03:34:34.620]  up against Trump, whenever it's the media versus Donald Trump, Donald Trump comes out
[03:34:34.620 --> 03:34:40.260]  on top, the polls have shown that repeatedly because the mainstream media is completely
[03:34:40.260 --> 03:34:45.860]  discredited, that's the vacuum that's created the Trump phenomenon in the first place, the
[03:34:45.860 --> 03:34:51.420]  same thing with Bernie Sanders on the left, so again that doesn't work anymore, so they've
[03:34:51.420 --> 03:34:57.740]  come up with this genius new tactic which basically boils down to this, find bad person
[03:34:57.740 --> 03:35:05.420]  who expressed support for Donald Trump, endlessly harangue Donald Trump about bad person and
[03:35:05.420 --> 03:35:12.100]  then repeat, very simple tactic, this is what they're now doing, we've seen it over the
[03:35:12.100 --> 03:35:18.580]  past few days or so with David Duke again, who came out with a video yesterday and basically
[03:35:18.580 --> 03:35:24.380]  said he doesn't even directly endorse Donald Trump, said he's going to vote for him, but
[03:35:24.380 --> 03:35:30.860]  of course CNN and the rest of the media took this, got to Trump and said basically don't
[03:35:30.860 --> 03:35:36.380]  you disavow David Duke, he has these disgusting racist opinions, don't you disavow him, you
[03:35:36.380 --> 03:35:40.540]  must disavow him immediately and of course what they're trying to do is keep him on the
[03:35:40.540 --> 03:35:47.100]  ropes, so every time somebody like David Duke comes out in support of Donald Trump, every
[03:35:47.100 --> 03:35:53.300]  time you have a KKK member show up at a Trump rally, half the cases of course it's Black
[03:35:53.300 --> 03:35:59.060]  Lives Matter people dressed up in robes, false flagging the event, CNN and the rest of the
[03:35:59.060 --> 03:36:03.340]  media is going to point to that person and say look at this horrible person, they support
[03:36:03.340 --> 03:36:09.100]  Donald Trump, get Donald Trump on for the interview, Donald Trump do you disavow this person, they've
[03:36:09.100 --> 03:36:13.420]  got horrible beliefs, they're associated with your campaign, do you disavow them and of
[03:36:13.420 --> 03:36:20.660]  course that's using Trump's own tactic against him, he's the master of creating a distraction
[03:36:20.660 --> 03:36:27.100]  when it comes to targeting his political opponents, so if they can repeatedly do that and have
[03:36:27.100 --> 03:36:32.340]  Trump on the defensive over and over again, then he's not going to have the opportunity,
[03:36:32.340 --> 03:36:38.220]  the air time which is used so well in the past to attack his rivals, to attack Rubio,
[03:36:38.220 --> 03:36:44.700]  to attack Hillary Clinton because he's constantly going to be on the defensive and if he has
[03:36:44.700 --> 03:36:48.420]  to disavow all these different people then they're just going to take it on down the
[03:36:48.420 --> 03:36:56.340]  line, next it's going to be do you disavow Roger Stone, he said these offensive things
[03:36:56.340 --> 03:37:00.980]  about women a few years ago, do you disavow Roger Stone, then they're going to go to Alex
[03:37:00.980 --> 03:37:06.180]  Jones, they're going to say Alex Jones thinks 9-11 was an inside job, do you disavow Alex
[03:37:06.180 --> 03:37:12.420]  Jones, so they're going to take it down the line until basically Trump has to disavow
[03:37:12.420 --> 03:37:18.780]  anyone that is even tangentially associated with and it keeps him on the ropes, it keeps
[03:37:18.780 --> 03:37:23.820]  him on the defensive, it prevents him from using that media platform which he's done
[03:37:23.820 --> 03:37:30.300]  so well for the past six months or more to attack his political opponents, Rubio, Hillary
[03:37:30.300 --> 03:37:36.300]  Clinton, etc. and to keep those people on the ropes, if he's constantly on the defensive
[03:37:36.300 --> 03:37:41.580]  he's not going to get the air time to do that and we saw that over the past few days with
[03:37:41.580 --> 03:37:48.460]  David Duke and this is a clip from CNN where they tried to grill Trump about David Duke,
[03:37:48.460 --> 03:37:49.460]  here's the clip.
[03:37:49.460 --> 03:37:53.620]  I want to ask you about the Anti-Defamation League which this week called on you to publicly
[03:37:53.620 --> 03:37:59.060]  condemn unequivocally the racism of former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke who recently
[03:37:59.060 --> 03:38:04.380]  said that voting against you at this point would be treason to your heritage, will you
[03:38:04.380 --> 03:38:08.300]  unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don't want his vote or that of other white
[03:38:08.300 --> 03:38:10.460]  supremacists in this election?
[03:38:10.460 --> 03:38:15.220]  Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke, okay, I don't
[03:38:15.220 --> 03:38:20.260]  know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists
[03:38:20.260 --> 03:38:25.740]  so I don't know, I mean I don't know did he endorse me or what's going on because you
[03:38:25.740 --> 03:38:30.860]  know I know nothing about David Duke, I know nothing about white supremacists and so you're
[03:38:30.860 --> 03:38:34.300]  asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing
[03:38:34.300 --> 03:38:35.460]  about.
[03:38:35.460 --> 03:38:40.420]  But I guess the question from the Anti-Defamation League is even if you don't know about their
[03:38:40.420 --> 03:38:45.660]  endorsement there are these groups and individuals endorsing you, would you just say unequivocally
[03:38:45.660 --> 03:38:50.180]  you condemn them and you don't want their support?
[03:38:50.180 --> 03:38:53.540]  Well I have to look at the group, I mean I don't know what group you're talking about,
[03:38:53.540 --> 03:38:57.340]  you wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about, I'd have to look, if
[03:38:57.340 --> 03:39:01.540]  you would send me a list of the groups I will do research on them and certainly I would
[03:39:01.540 --> 03:39:05.540]  disavow if I thought there was something wrong, but you may have groups in there that are
[03:39:05.540 --> 03:39:09.140]  totally fine and it would be very unfair so give me a list of the groups and I'll let
[03:39:09.140 --> 03:39:10.140]  you know.
[03:39:10.140 --> 03:39:13.500]  I mean I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but...
[03:39:13.500 --> 03:39:16.940]  I don't know anything, honestly I don't know David Duke, I don't believe I've ever met
[03:39:16.940 --> 03:39:20.060]  him, I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him and I just don't know anything about him.
[03:39:20.060 --> 03:39:21.660]  I want to ask you about the Anti-Defamation League.
[03:39:21.660 --> 03:39:27.300]  So yeah, Donald Trump on CNN, they've got him on the ropes, they've got him on the defensive
[03:39:27.300 --> 03:39:31.580]  demanding that he answer this charge, you know so and so has endorsed you, what do you
[03:39:31.580 --> 03:39:33.620]  think about this, don't you disavow them?
[03:39:33.620 --> 03:39:39.740]  They can basically pick anyone, any extremist from the political sphere who has endorsed
[03:39:39.740 --> 03:39:44.940]  Donald Trump, there are plenty of them just as there are plenty of extremists on the left
[03:39:44.940 --> 03:39:48.140]  who have endorsed people like Clinton and Sanders.
[03:39:48.140 --> 03:39:53.580]  Every single day on Twitter you go in and type assassinate Trump and there are hundreds
[03:39:53.580 --> 03:39:58.900]  of Hillary Bernie supporters calling for somebody to kill Trump.
[03:39:58.900 --> 03:40:04.260]  You're not going to see Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton being grilled by CNN about
[03:40:04.260 --> 03:40:08.500]  people like that, but you are going to see it with Trump because their previous tactics
[03:40:08.500 --> 03:40:13.540]  have failed and this is what they're going to go with at least in the short term.
[03:40:13.540 --> 03:40:18.940]  So now we've got another breaking story out of Breitbart on the same theme, video, time
[03:40:18.940 --> 03:40:22.380]  reporter grabs secret service agents throw at Trump rally.
[03:40:22.380 --> 03:40:27.580]  Now this just happened today a few hours ago and we've got the video here.
[03:40:27.580 --> 03:40:32.340]  Basically you don't see the beginning but a Black Lives Matter group, this mob interrupts
[03:40:32.340 --> 03:40:37.060]  a Trump rally, they start marching throughout the arena.
[03:40:37.060 --> 03:40:40.860]  This reporter tries to get pictures of them, tries to photograph them.
[03:40:40.860 --> 03:40:47.300]  He has an altercation with this secret service agent, basically says F you.
[03:40:47.300 --> 03:40:52.580]  So the secret service agent grabs him by the throat and body slams him down and yes, it's
[03:40:52.580 --> 03:40:54.340]  bad, it's egregious.
[03:40:54.340 --> 03:40:59.340]  If this happened at a Hillary Clinton event and the press were being manhandled at a Clinton
[03:40:59.340 --> 03:41:01.580]  event, then we would be against it.
[03:41:01.580 --> 03:41:05.700]  We would speak out against it and yes, it's horrible, but this is what they're going to
[03:41:05.700 --> 03:41:06.700]  do again.
[03:41:06.700 --> 03:41:10.060]  They're going to take this incident which looks terrible because it is, it looks like
[03:41:10.060 --> 03:41:15.580]  the media is being silenced, censored and assaulted because it is, but it's by this
[03:41:15.580 --> 03:41:20.220]  one out of control secret service agent, but they're going to take that, they're going
[03:41:20.220 --> 03:41:22.380]  to blame it on Trump.
[03:41:22.380 --> 03:41:25.020]  That's what they've been looking for all along.
[03:41:25.020 --> 03:41:31.580]  We've had almost every single Trump speech, every single Trump rally gets interrupted
[03:41:31.580 --> 03:41:34.420]  by one of these left wing agitators.
[03:41:34.420 --> 03:41:38.180]  They're loud, they're obnoxious, in some cases they're violent.
[03:41:38.180 --> 03:41:44.580]  Every single time they get escorted out, they don't really get treated that roughly in comparison
[03:41:44.580 --> 03:41:45.580]  to their behavior.
[03:41:45.580 --> 03:41:48.420]  And in fact, Trump has made reference to that.
[03:41:48.420 --> 03:41:52.740]  He's constantly saying, oh, these people get kindly escorted out, everybody's really
[03:41:52.740 --> 03:41:58.460]  nice to them and the media obviously didn't like that, but now we've got an actual incident
[03:41:58.460 --> 03:42:03.220]  where this is egregious, this is wrong, this is the media being assaulted, this is the
[03:42:03.220 --> 03:42:10.220]  First Amendment being silenced by this aggressive out of control secret service agent.
[03:42:10.220 --> 03:42:13.980]  And it's bad and it should be condemned, but they're going to take this and they're going
[03:42:13.980 --> 03:42:19.260]  to blame it on Trump and they're going to try and fit it into this narrative that Trump
[03:42:19.260 --> 03:42:25.220]  is the new Hitler, which we've seen from both the left wing and conservative establishment
[03:42:25.220 --> 03:42:28.380]  conservative outlets like National Review Online.
[03:42:28.380 --> 03:42:33.020]  So because Trump is a populist, because he has huge support, because he has huge rallies
[03:42:33.020 --> 03:42:35.260]  at which people chant his name.
[03:42:35.260 --> 03:42:40.940]  That means his Hitler, which of course, if you use that standard, that also meant that
[03:42:40.940 --> 03:42:43.140]  someone like Winston Churchill was Hitler.
[03:42:43.140 --> 03:42:50.220]  He was a populist, he had huge support, Barack Obama ran on a semi-populist campaign.
[03:42:50.220 --> 03:42:53.300]  He had huge support, he had people chanting his name.
[03:42:53.300 --> 03:43:00.180]  He was filling out arenas back in 2007, 2008, does that mean that Barack Obama was Hitler?
[03:43:00.180 --> 03:43:01.180]  No.
[03:43:01.180 --> 03:43:02.860]  But that's what they're going with.
[03:43:02.860 --> 03:43:07.380]  So they're going to try and tie this into the narrative of, you know, look how authoritarian
[03:43:07.380 --> 03:43:08.380]  Trump is.
[03:43:08.380 --> 03:43:14.780]  He has his goons, he has his minions, physically grabbing reporters, joke slamming them.
[03:43:14.780 --> 03:43:15.900]  This is chilling.
[03:43:15.900 --> 03:43:20.980]  This is what's coming to America if we allow this new Hitler to be elected.
[03:43:20.980 --> 03:43:24.460]  So this is what the media is going to run with.
[03:43:24.460 --> 03:43:25.980]  They did it with David Duke.
[03:43:25.980 --> 03:43:29.260]  That's kind of fallen flat in its face now that Duke come out and said he doesn't even
[03:43:29.260 --> 03:43:31.220]  endorse Donald Trump.
[03:43:31.220 --> 03:43:37.380]  But again, they're going to try and pick these incidents where they use guilt by association.
[03:43:37.380 --> 03:43:44.100]  And now Trump's son, Eric Trump is speaking out against this, again, this is out of Breitbart.
[03:43:44.100 --> 03:43:47.100]  Eric Trump dismisses last minute establishment attacks.
[03:43:47.100 --> 03:43:50.500]  The most dangerous people are the ones who are drowning.
[03:43:50.500 --> 03:43:56.140]  Eric Trump tells Breitbart News, the establishment is drowning and desperate to stop his father,
[03:43:56.140 --> 03:44:01.860]  the GOP front runner, Donald Trump, by any means necessary, quote, the attack they're
[03:44:01.860 --> 03:44:04.740]  trying to take now is your father's a racist.
[03:44:04.740 --> 03:44:07.940]  Your father won't repudiate the KKK.
[03:44:07.940 --> 03:44:10.980]  You sat across the desk from him as a business partner.
[03:44:10.980 --> 03:44:14.060]  Does your father have a racist bone in his body?
[03:44:14.060 --> 03:44:15.780]  His son Eric responds not at all.
[03:44:15.780 --> 03:44:19.780]  And honestly, I don't know how many times he has to disavow.
[03:44:19.780 --> 03:44:24.140]  People can come out, anyone can come out and say, hey, I endorse somebody.
[03:44:24.140 --> 03:44:25.140]  It's absolutely insane.
[03:44:25.140 --> 03:44:32.380]  So again, it's this process of them forcing Trump to disavow every individual, every extreme
[03:44:32.380 --> 03:44:39.460]  element on the political fringe to keep him on the defensive, to keep him on the ropes.
[03:44:39.460 --> 03:44:43.780]  And it's part of this full board attack that the establishment is completely panicked at
[03:44:43.780 --> 03:44:44.780]  this point.
[03:44:44.780 --> 03:44:47.460]  They underestimated his momentum.
[03:44:47.460 --> 03:44:50.940]  They thought that it would be extinguished months ago.
[03:44:50.940 --> 03:44:52.580]  It hasn't been extinguished.
[03:44:52.580 --> 03:44:54.620]  It's continued to build.
[03:44:54.620 --> 03:44:57.900]  And now we've got the neoconservatives with their fangs out.
[03:44:57.900 --> 03:45:00.900]  This is out of the intercept.
[03:45:00.900 --> 03:45:03.300]  Neoconservatives declare war on Donald Trump.
[03:45:03.300 --> 03:45:07.900]  Donald Trump's runaway success in the GOP primaries is setting off alarm bells amongst
[03:45:07.900 --> 03:45:12.780]  neoconservatives who are worried he will not pursue the same bellicose foreign policy that
[03:45:12.780 --> 03:45:16.020]  has dominated Republican thinking for decades.
[03:45:16.020 --> 03:45:21.860]  So we have Robert Kagan, one of the prime intellectual backers of the Iraq war and an
[03:45:21.860 --> 03:45:26.940]  advocate for Syrian intervention, because that turned out really good, didn't it?
[03:45:26.940 --> 03:45:33.540]  You've got Max Boo, an unrepentant supporter of the Iraq war, because that also turned
[03:45:33.540 --> 03:45:35.820]  out hunky dory as well.
[03:45:35.820 --> 03:45:41.020]  So he writes in the weekly standard, a Trump presidency would represent the death knell
[03:45:41.020 --> 03:45:45.460]  of America as a great power, citing among other things Trump's objection to a large
[03:45:45.460 --> 03:45:48.380]  American troop presence in South Korea.
[03:45:48.380 --> 03:45:54.620]  So because Trump doesn't want to follow this suicidal nightmare, self-defeating foreign
[03:45:54.620 --> 03:46:00.460]  policy that we saw in Iraq, that we saw in Libya, that we saw in Syria, which led to
[03:46:00.460 --> 03:46:08.340]  mass bloodshed over a million innocent dead Iraqis and a migrant humanitarian crisis,
[03:46:08.340 --> 03:46:12.660]  because Trump doesn't want to continue that and replicate that.
[03:46:12.660 --> 03:46:16.860]  And because he's spoken out against the Iraq war, he opposed it from the start.
[03:46:16.860 --> 03:46:23.080]  Now the neo-conservatives are coming out and saying basically, if Trump gets the nomination,
[03:46:23.080 --> 03:46:25.060]  they will vote for Hillary.
[03:46:25.060 --> 03:46:30.060]  They would rather have Hillary in office than Donald Trump, because of course, she's
[03:46:30.060 --> 03:46:35.980]  a war hawk, she's the status quo, and it will be business as usual for the military-industrial
[03:46:35.980 --> 03:46:36.980]  complex.
[03:46:36.980 --> 03:46:41.900]  And again, disclaimer, I don't support a lot of Trump's views, I don't support killing
[03:46:41.900 --> 03:46:48.820]  terrorist families, I don't support torture, but because he's so unpredictable, precisely
[03:46:48.820 --> 03:46:54.260]  because he has flip-flops on a lot of these issues, nobody within the establishment, whether
[03:46:54.260 --> 03:46:58.420]  it be on the left or the right, really knows where he stands anymore.
[03:46:58.420 --> 03:47:03.220]  And this is why many conservatives can't support him, because they accuse him of flip-flopping,
[03:47:03.220 --> 03:47:04.740]  and that's right.
[03:47:04.740 --> 03:47:10.700]  But within that flip-flopping inherently is the fact that Donald Trump is completely unpredictable.
[03:47:10.700 --> 03:47:15.080]  He's a maverick, and that means he's going to be difficult to control.
[03:47:15.080 --> 03:47:20.140]  So that's why the establishment, both on the left, the neo-liberals, the neo-cons, and
[03:47:20.140 --> 03:47:27.180]  the GOP establishment, is now really getting its fangs out in preparation to try and have
[03:47:27.180 --> 03:47:33.140]  one last huge effort to sink Donald Trump, and they're going to have to get more creative,
[03:47:33.140 --> 03:47:38.940]  of course, because everything they've thrown at him so far has completely backfired.
[03:47:38.940 --> 03:47:45.060]  Going on, though, to the Oscars, of course, we had three hours last night of basically
[03:47:45.060 --> 03:47:50.660]  smug lecturing from rich, self-important virtue-signalers.
[03:47:50.660 --> 03:47:56.660]  The ratings for the Oscars are at their lowest in eight years, who knew that that wouldn't
[03:47:56.660 --> 03:47:57.660]  be popular, right?
[03:47:57.660 --> 03:48:05.500]  And, of course, we had Leonardo DiCaprio coming out and lecturing everyone about global warming.
[03:48:05.500 --> 03:48:06.500]  Here's the clip.
[03:48:06.500 --> 03:48:12.300]  Making the Revenant was about man's relationship to the natural world, a world that we collectively
[03:48:12.300 --> 03:48:16.580]  felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history.
[03:48:16.580 --> 03:48:21.060]  Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find
[03:48:21.060 --> 03:48:22.260]  snow.
[03:48:22.260 --> 03:48:23.260]  Climate change is real.
[03:48:23.260 --> 03:48:25.260]  It is happening right now.
[03:48:25.260 --> 03:48:32.780]  It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively
[03:48:32.780 --> 03:48:36.060]  together and stop procrastinating.
[03:48:36.060 --> 03:48:41.900]  We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters of
[03:48:41.900 --> 03:48:46.820]  the big corporations, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of
[03:48:46.820 --> 03:48:51.140]  the world, for the billions and billions of underprivileged people who will be most
[03:48:51.140 --> 03:48:56.740]  affected by this, for our children's children, and for those people out there whose voices
[03:48:56.740 --> 03:48:59.620]  have been drowned out by the politics of greed.
[03:48:59.620 --> 03:49:02.900]  I thank you all for this amazing award tonight.
[03:49:02.900 --> 03:49:09.740]  Okay, there's Leonardo DiCaprio at the Oscars last night lecturing everybody about global
[03:49:09.740 --> 03:49:10.740]  warming.
[03:49:10.740 --> 03:49:17.380]  And of course, the irony here is that he just won an Oscar for a movie in which the Revenant,
[03:49:17.380 --> 03:49:22.140]  in which the cold almost kills him a dozen times and he has to sleep inside a horse to
[03:49:22.140 --> 03:49:23.140]  stay warm.
[03:49:23.140 --> 03:49:29.340]  And now he's lecturing us about global warming and telling us we need to stop the big polluters.
[03:49:29.340 --> 03:49:32.620]  Well, I agree with Leonardo DiCaprio.
[03:49:32.620 --> 03:49:40.420]  We do need to stop the big polluters starting with him and his 5,000 mile round trips from
[03:49:40.420 --> 03:49:42.500]  New York to LA.
[03:49:42.500 --> 03:49:47.780]  This is the article DiCaprio lectures Oscars about global warming after using private jet
[03:49:47.780 --> 03:49:51.460]  six times in six months.
[03:49:51.460 --> 03:49:55.900]  While lecturing everyone else about their impact on the Earth, DiCaprio routinely flies
[03:49:55.900 --> 03:50:00.620]  between New York and LA in a carbon dioxide spewing private jet.
[03:50:00.620 --> 03:50:05.580]  Oh, really, do as I say, not as I do DiCaprio.
[03:50:05.580 --> 03:50:10.460]  After the Sony email leak last year, it was revealed that the Wolf of Wall Street actor
[03:50:10.460 --> 03:50:16.980]  took six private round trip private jet flights in the space of just six weeks between April
[03:50:16.980 --> 03:50:18.780]  and May 2014.
[03:50:18.780 --> 03:50:24.660]  He also took a flight from LA to Las Vegas and stayed in Sin City for just eight hours
[03:50:24.660 --> 03:50:27.260]  before flying home again.
[03:50:27.260 --> 03:50:30.940]  Each time the studio picked up the cost of the plane as well as catering, we're talking
[03:50:30.940 --> 03:50:33.060]  about tens of thousands of dollars.
[03:50:33.060 --> 03:50:37.420]  We're talking about over $200,000 for these trips alone.
[03:50:37.420 --> 03:50:40.780]  But you're bad for having a four by four.
[03:50:40.780 --> 03:50:43.540]  You're bad for taking that commercial flight.
[03:50:43.540 --> 03:50:50.420]  And Leonardo DiCaprio is going to give you what for again, do as he says, not as he does.
[03:50:50.420 --> 03:50:54.660]  We'll get more into it after the break on the Alex Jones show live for our overdrive

[03:54:42.180 --> 03:54:47.380]  going back to the Trump thing I was reminded by Leanne and Alex in the break that you know
[03:54:47.380 --> 03:54:54.380]  we have this idea of the media taking an endorsement of Trump by somebody like David Duke by somebody
[03:54:54.380 --> 03:55:00.700]  on the political fringe and then using that to discredit Trump guilt by association this
[03:55:00.700 --> 03:55:05.660]  is the tactic they're going to use going forward and I was reminded of the fact that there
[03:55:05.660 --> 03:55:12.860]  was this Confederate flag pin created for the Clinton Gore presidential campaign back before
[03:55:12.860 --> 03:55:19.020]  the 1992 election Hillary Clinton camp won't say if Confederate flag button was official
[03:55:19.020 --> 03:55:23.420]  part of 92 presidential campaign that's the headline out of the Daily Mail but somebody
[03:55:23.420 --> 03:55:30.260]  else created that pin that Confederate flag pin for the Clinton Gore presidential campaign
[03:55:30.260 --> 03:55:34.940]  they weren't grilled about it at the time even though it's almost precisely the same
[03:55:34.940 --> 03:55:39.980]  thing as what we're seeing now with David Duke so again they're not going to pick up
[03:55:39.980 --> 03:55:46.220]  on extremists on the left that support Hillary Clinton the kind of people that call for Trump's
[03:55:46.220 --> 03:55:51.060]  assassination the people that we interviewed out on the street over the weekend that videos
[03:55:51.060 --> 03:55:57.220]  upon the Alex Jones YouTube channel they are not going to grill Hillary Clinton over that
[03:55:57.220 --> 03:56:01.740]  they're not going to talk to Bernie Sanders over that but Trump is now going to be responsible
[03:56:01.740 --> 03:56:06.940]  for whatever David Duke says he's going to be responsible for secret service agents
[03:56:06.940 --> 03:56:12.020]  choke slamming reporters this is what they're going to do going forward we'll see if it works
[03:56:12.020 --> 03:56:18.020]  it hasn't so far but they're getting desperate so they're going to try anything before the
[03:56:18.020 --> 03:56:24.740]  break I was talking about Leonardo DiCaprio got up in front of the Oscars lectured everybody
[03:56:24.740 --> 03:56:31.460]  again this whole charade this three hour bore fest which has got its lowest ratings in eight
[03:56:31.460 --> 03:56:39.020]  years was an exercise of virtue signaling on steroids and if you look at the actual goodie
[03:56:39.020 --> 03:56:44.900]  bags that the Oscar attendees receive we're talking about over two hundred thousand dollars
[03:56:44.900 --> 03:56:52.060]  worth of goodies including a fifty five thousand dollar trip to Israel again they're probably
[03:56:52.060 --> 03:56:56.900]  going to be using their private jets to go there so that's they're up there lecturing
[03:56:56.900 --> 03:57:03.220]  us all for three hours about climate change about the poor while being given two hundred
[03:57:03.220 --> 03:57:10.980]  thousand dollar goodie bags we've got DiCaprio who flew private six times within six weeks
[03:57:10.980 --> 03:57:19.140]  LA to New York and back again five thousand miles how much carbon dioxide is that spewing
[03:57:19.140 --> 03:57:25.260]  up what's his carbon footprint and yet he has the goal to lecture everybody watching
[03:57:25.260 --> 03:57:30.300]  about how we need to watch our impact on the earth about how we need to reduce our carbon
[03:57:30.300 --> 03:57:36.320]  footprint and in fact he donates he basically bankrolls this website this movement Green
[03:57:36.320 --> 03:57:43.060]  World Rising which encourages visitors to its website to lighten their carbon load and
[03:57:43.060 --> 03:57:49.180]  even includes a CO2 calculator to help people take quote meaningful action to reduce their
[03:57:49.180 --> 03:57:56.220]  carbon footprint so he's flying private jet he's taking limos he's on the yacht surrounded
[03:57:56.220 --> 03:58:03.340]  by you know beach babes but he's lecturing you about your lifestyle just like Ted Turner
[03:58:03.340 --> 03:58:11.820]  just like Al Gore whine all day about overpopulation they've got five kids all these people a complete
[03:58:11.820 --> 03:58:18.020]  hypocrites they don't live the lifestyle that they preach which again illustrates that
[03:58:18.020 --> 03:58:22.340]  they're complete frauds and it's not about them actually caring about this message it's
[03:58:22.340 --> 03:58:27.100]  about them controlling your lives that's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour of
[03:58:27.100 --> 03:58:31.740]  the Alex Jones show Alex will be back tomorrow eleven to two and be sure to check out the
