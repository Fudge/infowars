[00:00.000 --> 00:12.920]  Info Wars was first to tell you, decades ago, that the EAS emergency systems were one day
[00:12.920 --> 00:17.080]  beyond smartphones and would issue you different government directives.
[00:17.080 --> 00:22.280]  It's in my film, Police State to the Takeover, made in the year 2001.
[00:22.280 --> 00:27.440]  Well, now it's here, and it's directed by the UN bypassing the president.
[00:27.440 --> 00:31.440]  Those messages folks across Michigan got last night.
[00:31.440 --> 00:37.440]  From the Michigan Executive Office of Governor, the state of Michigan, stay home, stay safe.
[00:37.440 --> 00:40.440]  Executive order takes effect at midnight tonight.
[00:40.440 --> 00:42.440]  Non-essential travel is prohibited.
[00:42.440 --> 00:47.440]  As necessary, you may leave your home for health and safety reasons to get groceries and supplies
[00:47.440 --> 00:51.440]  for certain outdoor activities and to care for others.
[00:51.440 --> 00:56.440]  Businesses must limit in-person operations to those necessary to sustain or protect life.
[00:56.440 --> 01:03.440]  All individuals who leave their home or place of residence must adhere to social distancing measures recommended by the CDC.
[01:03.440 --> 01:19.440]  For additional guidance, see www.michigan.gov.
[01:19.440 --> 01:28.440]  With air raid sirens, I would normally only play air raid sirens maybe once a week or every few weeks, but something particularly dangerous was going on.
[01:28.440 --> 01:30.440]  I wanted to get people's attention.
[01:30.440 --> 01:38.440]  I began playing them every day, sometimes multiple times daily, in November because I wanted everybody to know as a symbol that we're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:38.440 --> 01:40.440]  Just got chills.
[01:40.440 --> 01:46.440]  Now, I've really been cogitating on what's going on, deeply thinking about the globalist and their operations.
[01:46.440 --> 01:54.440]  And going with all my research and then just my gut, my spirit.
[01:54.440 --> 01:59.440]  And I just want to announce the globalists are getting their ass kicked up and down the street.
[01:59.440 --> 02:02.440]  There's global awakenings happening, incredibly good things are happening.
[02:02.440 --> 02:04.440]  If you turn on the news, you wouldn't know that.
[02:04.440 --> 02:07.440]  That said, the enemy knows they're losing.
[02:07.440 --> 02:12.440]  And a cornered demon is extremely dangerous.
[02:12.440 --> 02:16.440]  And so we better have a discussion about how they're going to strike next.
[02:16.440 --> 02:22.440]  We said back in November, probably a bio attack.
[02:22.440 --> 02:31.440]  Economic collapse, hacking of infrastructure, blaming it on hackers, using that as a way to shut down speech further.
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.440]  I want to open the phones up and I want to shake the broadcast up just because it's the right thing to do.
[02:35.440 --> 02:38.440]  I don't like saying I'm going to take calls and give the number out and then only get the 10 of them.
[02:38.440 --> 02:41.440]  We're going to take calls in the first hour.
[02:41.440 --> 02:49.440]  When we come out of break at 20 after in the third segment, we're going to go directly to your phone calls on two subjects because I want to have a brainstorm here.
[02:49.440 --> 02:51.440]  That brings up the best of us.
[02:51.440 --> 02:54.440]  How are the globalists going to strike back next?
[02:54.440 --> 02:56.440]  What's the next scam?
[02:56.440 --> 02:59.440]  Remember back in November, I said their impeachment is going to fail.
[02:59.440 --> 03:00.440]  They don't have the votes of the Senate.
[03:00.440 --> 03:01.440]  It's a fraud.
[03:01.440 --> 03:02.440]  What are they going to do next?
[03:02.440 --> 03:03.440]  What are they going to do next?
[03:03.440 --> 03:04.440]  What are they going to do next?
[03:04.440 --> 03:10.440]  And I said, economic collapse, war, bio weapon, all three, race war.
[03:10.440 --> 03:13.440]  I mean, it's not hard to know what's in their quiver.
[03:13.440 --> 03:15.440]  What's in their clutch of arrows.
[03:15.440 --> 03:18.440]  But the question is what card they're going to play next.
[03:18.440 --> 03:26.440]  We better put our thinking caps on and then we should discuss what does Trump need to do with 109 days out from the election?
[03:26.440 --> 03:27.440]  And what do we need to do?
[03:27.440 --> 03:28.440]  What can we do?
[03:28.440 --> 03:29.440]  What should we do?
[03:29.440 --> 03:30.440]  What should I do?
[03:30.440 --> 03:32.440]  Give me your ideas.
[03:32.440 --> 03:37.440]  And I'm not going to say thanks for your call and go through the whole song and dance because that takes up everybody's time.
[03:37.440 --> 03:38.440]  I love you all.
[03:38.440 --> 03:41.440]  I'm just going to go to you and just get it out and make your point.
[03:41.440 --> 03:46.440]  I'm going to the next person because I used to do shows 25 years ago, 26 years ago.
[03:46.440 --> 03:49.440]  The first five years of the show, man, I was good at taking a lot of calls.
[03:49.440 --> 03:51.440]  I take 100 calls in a show.
[03:51.440 --> 03:54.440]  Just bam, bam, I control the phone board myself.
[03:54.440 --> 03:57.440]  They just got the person's name and where they were calling from.
[03:57.440 --> 04:01.440]  And over the years, we have a lot of great callers, but things have degenerated where I don't go to enough calls.
[04:01.440 --> 04:05.440]  I've got a little bit better, but I really want to just knock it out of the park today.
[04:05.440 --> 04:07.440]  So we'll give the number out when we come back.
[04:07.440 --> 04:11.440]  I'll plow through all the headlines and what's coming up in the second hour.
[04:11.440 --> 04:18.440]  I'm going to hit all this news in the second hour and continue with your calls.
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.440]  And we have a special guest in studio that's running against one of the top globalist Democrats.
[04:22.440 --> 04:24.440]  We'll tell you about that coming up as well.
[04:24.440 --> 04:28.440]  But please remember, without your support of M4s, we wouldn't still be here.
[04:28.440 --> 04:29.440]  And it's true.
[04:29.440 --> 04:39.440]  This show, the stories, the reports, our guests, the calls have absolutely changed the world in an ultra, ultra massive way.
[04:39.440 --> 04:43.440]  So I want to salute you all and thank you all for your ongoing support and your diligence.
[04:43.440 --> 04:49.440]  Because when you tell people about the local radio stations, when you spread the word about infowars.com and newswars.com and Bandai Video,
[04:49.440 --> 04:53.440]  it changes the world. It is changing the world and we're winning together.
[04:53.440 --> 04:59.440]  So I want to thank you all and salute you and tell you, kick it up a notch.
[05:23.440 --> 05:31.440]  To try to build up humanity and to try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented.
[05:31.440 --> 05:33.440]  And that's what made our modern world.
[05:33.440 --> 05:47.440]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command even if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[05:47.440 --> 05:56.440]  And that's what COVID-19 is, a global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity and against your future.
[05:56.440 --> 06:21.440]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[06:21.440 --> 06:30.440]  Welcome my friends, welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday, July 16th, 2020 transmission, 109 days out.
[06:30.440 --> 06:33.440]  This is the final countdown.
[06:33.440 --> 06:39.440]  All right, I am going to open the phones up throughout the next four hours.
[06:39.440 --> 06:41.440]  Matt Bracken joins us in the fourth hour.
[06:41.440 --> 06:43.440]  We have another gentleman joining us.
[06:43.440 --> 06:46.440]  He's running against one of the top Democrats in the country in studio.
[06:46.440 --> 06:48.440]  I'll tell you about that coming up a little bit later.
[06:48.440 --> 06:56.440]  There is so much to get to, but the good news is Trump is really making all the right decisions right now with 109 days left.
[06:56.440 --> 07:01.440]  I'd say it about 120 days out about 10 days ago.
[07:01.440 --> 07:08.440]  We saw Trump start going with his instincts and not Jared Kushner and not Brad Parscale.
[07:08.440 --> 07:13.440]  And I can tell you, both of them are bad news.
[07:13.440 --> 07:24.440]  Parscale is a delusional idiot who is into himself and thinks he got Trump elected, but he's not evil.
[07:24.440 --> 07:37.440]  Jared Kushner and Ivanka are amateurs who are constantly meeting with Big Tech and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan like they're their friends.
[07:37.440 --> 07:44.440]  And they leak like a sieve and they are just unbelievably naive as well.
[07:44.440 --> 07:47.440]  And I don't sit there and attack these individuals with pleasure.
[07:47.440 --> 07:53.440]  I do it because they need to be out of the decision-making processes.
[07:53.440 --> 07:59.440]  Now, we elected President Trump, not Brad Parscale.
[07:59.440 --> 08:07.440]  I know it's impressive that he's eight feet tall and we also did not elect Ivanka or Jared.
[08:07.440 --> 08:11.440]  Parscale out as Trump campaign manager, demoted to senior advisor.
[08:11.440 --> 08:12.440]  I know folks that know him in Florida.
[08:12.440 --> 08:16.440]  He's a nice guy, friendly guy, buys some good ads for Trump.
[08:16.440 --> 08:17.440]  That's about it.
[08:17.440 --> 08:20.440]  Buys a bunch of Lamborghinis and Ferraris and has parties all night long.
[08:20.440 --> 08:21.440]  Okay, great dude.
[08:21.440 --> 08:22.440]  That's wonderful.
[08:22.440 --> 08:26.440]  He talks about, oh, the dynasty of the Trumps and how they're invincible.
[08:26.440 --> 08:28.440]  Bull crap, buddy boy.
[08:28.440 --> 08:30.440]  We are in the fight of our lives.
[08:30.440 --> 08:34.440]  We don't need Sunshine Patriots dancing around when we're in so much trouble.
[08:34.440 --> 08:37.440]  Glad you've been demoted to advisor.
[08:37.440 --> 08:47.440]  And I'm telling you, Kushner's been kicked to the curb as well because Kushner is an amateur just like his father was an amateur.
[08:47.440 --> 08:53.440]  Absolute amateurs, ladies and gentlemen, but they believe their own BS.
[08:53.440 --> 08:54.440]  That's all coming up.
[08:54.440 --> 08:58.440]  Let me give you some more good news all over the United States.
[08:58.440 --> 09:07.440]  We are seeing a major, major repudiation of the mask wearing.
[09:07.440 --> 09:14.440]  You have the NYPD, almost all of them refusing to wear masks, saying it's pure bull and holding up studies that it doesn't protect you.
[09:14.440 --> 09:18.440]  They can't breathe out there doing their job and people can't hear them when they talk.
[09:18.440 --> 09:20.440]  It's a joke.
[09:20.440 --> 09:24.440]  When you do get some money, you got to take it off.
[09:24.440 --> 09:29.440]  And now all these governors in Louisiana, I mean, it's all happening.
[09:29.440 --> 09:32.440]  People are calling it out and saying it's a fraud.
[09:32.440 --> 09:39.440]  Georgia governor bans mask mandates, says they're unconstitutional and they don't work and they're a joke.
[09:39.440 --> 09:41.440]  Flatly violates due process.
[09:41.440 --> 09:49.440]  Louisiana Attorney General says Democrat governor mask mandate likely unconstitutional.
[09:49.440 --> 10:03.440]  Trump admin tells hospitals to bypass CDC send data directly to HHS because it's the CDC that set the policy through the UN to count everybody that dies of gunshot wounds, car wrecks, cancer.
[10:03.440 --> 10:15.440]  You name it as COVID-19 and to create all these false positives under the CDC UN guidelines to say if one person has it, then you count 15 more people around them saying they have it.
[10:15.440 --> 10:20.440]  Or if you have a sore throat or sniffles, no need to be tested, you have COVID-19.
[10:20.440 --> 10:28.440]  When we covered that three weeks ago, I thought we were breaking it and we got flooded with articles and news going, you didn't know this, Jones?
[10:28.440 --> 10:30.440]  Yeah, I knew they were doing it.
[10:30.440 --> 10:33.440]  I didn't know that it was official and it had been in the newspapers.
[10:33.440 --> 10:38.440]  They're like, yeah, we just randomly have a sore throat, no need to come in, we just say you have it.
[10:38.440 --> 10:39.440]  What?
[10:39.440 --> 10:44.440]  Of course, it's spiking, but the deaths aren't because it's BS.
[10:44.440 --> 10:47.440]  This is such incredibly good news right here.
[10:47.440 --> 10:51.440]  Why are so many NYPD officers refusing to wear masks?
[10:51.440 --> 10:53.440]  Protest the New York Times asked.
[10:53.440 --> 10:57.440]  It's a photo of about 50 police officers and two of them are wearing the dumb mask.
[10:57.440 --> 10:58.440]  And the cops have been talking.
[10:58.440 --> 11:02.440]  They say it's all a hoax.
[11:02.440 --> 11:07.440]  Georgia Governor Brian Kemp bans cities, counties for mandating masks.
[11:07.440 --> 11:11.440]  A woman refused Bill Nye the science guy's mask propaganda.
[11:11.440 --> 11:16.440]  Bill Nye edited his old shows from the 90s and says there aren't just male and female chromosomes.
[11:16.440 --> 11:19.440]  And he said chromosomes don't decide sex.
[11:19.440 --> 11:25.440]  That's like saying water is an H2O and isn't a molecule.
[11:25.440 --> 11:27.440]  I mean, it's a war on reality.
[11:27.440 --> 11:29.440]  So we've got all that news.
[11:29.440 --> 11:32.440]  Meanwhile, California to release 18,000 prisoners.
[11:32.440 --> 11:37.440]  Many of them violent by end of August to vote, of course, to slow the spread of COVID-19.
[11:37.440 --> 11:42.440]  But if you are out without your mask or bigger than group of 10 people, you will go to jail.
[11:42.440 --> 11:45.440]  He says, of course.
[11:45.440 --> 11:49.440]  Big article up on Gateway Pundit.
[11:49.440 --> 11:58.440]  Gateway Pundits Joe Hoff, the man who first exposed COVID-19 hoax says New York Governor Cuomo should be investigated and looked at for murder.
[11:58.440 --> 12:01.440]  Big info wars interview on the Gateway Pundit.
[12:01.440 --> 12:04.440]  You know, the White House is going to be watching that.
[12:04.440 --> 12:07.440]  Because Trump loves the Gateway Pundit.
[12:07.440 --> 12:14.440]  Meanwhile, COVID lockdowns to trigger massive wave of evictions as culture in society breaks down.
[12:14.440 --> 12:22.440]  Meanwhile, Modera COVID-19 vaccine induced adverse reactions in more than half of trial participants.
[12:22.440 --> 12:26.440]  Gates said it's going to make a lot of people sick, but media matters.
[12:26.440 --> 12:32.440]  Had an article out last week saying Jones made it up that there's adverse reactions in the vaccine.
[12:32.440 --> 12:35.440]  And that Gates said a lot of people will be hurt.
[12:35.440 --> 12:38.440]  Yeah, he said 700,000. I have the clip.
[12:38.440 --> 12:43.440]  But media matters said I'm lying. So it's true.
[12:43.440 --> 12:54.440]  That's all coming up. Meanwhile, Missouri Senator Holly asked DOJ to open civil rights investigation to St. Louis circuit attorney office for targeting the McCloskey's.
[12:54.440 --> 13:01.440]  They've now, as you know, rated them and they're now moving forward to indict them.
[13:01.440 --> 13:06.440]  Their own home broken into their own gate broken into a mob screaming racial epithets at them.
[13:06.440 --> 13:12.440]  They say get off my land and she's investigating them and moving forward.
[13:12.440 --> 13:16.440]  Unbelievable. We'll be breaking all of that down coming up as well.
[13:16.440 --> 13:26.440]  There's some other really huge pedophile news that I will hit after I take calls next segment.
[13:26.440 --> 13:34.440]  More and more of these Hollywood people on like the director of Guardians of the Galaxy had pedophile themed parties and talked about screwing kids all over Twitter.
[13:34.440 --> 13:36.440]  Remember that?
[13:36.440 --> 13:42.440]  Well, we've got somebody else out talking about how she gets off on look on little girls and how she gets sexually excited.
[13:42.440 --> 13:45.440]  And she's a good friend of Jeffrey Epstein and gasoline Maxwell.
[13:45.440 --> 13:52.440]  So we're going to be talking about this individual coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[13:52.440 --> 14:03.440]  Chrissy Teigen and boy how she's been caught red handed along with Nike with hidden images of kidnapped children in their advertising.
[14:03.440 --> 14:06.440]  Of course, if you know where to look, it's not hidden.
[14:06.440 --> 14:10.440]  It's all part of the club, all part of the sick, sick club.
[14:10.440 --> 14:18.440]  All right, I want to open the phones up on what Trump should do to counter the globalist, what we should do to counter the globalist in this critical time worldwide.
[14:18.440 --> 14:31.440]  Not sure in the U.S. and how you think the deep stage going to strike back next as their COVID hoax really does fall apart even as they try to squeeze us into COVID lockdown 2.0.
[14:31.440 --> 14:41.440]  I want to take your calls 877789 Alex, that's 8777892539 first time callers, long time callers.
[14:41.440 --> 14:45.440]  If you were on hold yesterday on the show ended, I didn't get to five or six callers call back in to go to that line.
[14:45.440 --> 14:50.440]  877789 Alex, 8777892539.
[14:50.440 --> 15:00.440]  A lot of folks should call internationally with 1-800, but if you can't in your country, dial the country access code and 512-646-1776.
[15:00.440 --> 15:01.440]  There's a lot more too.
[15:01.440 --> 15:04.440]  What's behind the big Twitter hack?
[15:04.440 --> 15:10.440]  I've got a good idea and I'm going to be going over some of that as well.
[15:10.440 --> 15:18.440]  And we've got a big stack of news about the confirmation of millions have starved to death since the COVID lockdown, not from COVID.
[15:18.440 --> 15:19.440]  COVID didn't cause it.
[15:19.440 --> 15:25.440]  The globalist lockdown of the Western economies and the third world economies has caused unbelievable death.
[15:25.440 --> 15:34.440]  If you believe the official numbers of 500,000 dead worldwide from COVID, we're already talking five, six times that number have died from the starvation,
[15:34.440 --> 15:39.440]  which is exactly what every leftist wants is to kill and starve as many people as they can.
[15:39.440 --> 15:49.440]  They are the most selfish, ugly, stupid, hateful, murderous, devil-worshipping people on earth because they are of their father, Satan.
[15:49.440 --> 15:53.440]  And they will be with their father and love death forever.
[15:53.440 --> 15:54.440]  Stay with us.
[15:54.440 --> 16:00.440]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com.
[16:00.440 --> 16:02.440]  You can wear them out to political events.
[16:02.440 --> 16:03.440]  You can trigger live darts.
[16:03.440 --> 16:11.440]  But one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[16:11.440 --> 16:17.440]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[16:17.440 --> 16:24.440]  It's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing of their openly announcing.
[16:24.440 --> 16:26.440]  It's an act of submission.
[16:26.440 --> 16:29.440]  It's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down.
[16:29.440 --> 16:34.440]  But a big reason to wear these is then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask.
[16:34.440 --> 16:39.440]  Say, it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[16:39.440 --> 16:43.440]  And the M95 mask only control what's coming in, not what's going out.
[16:43.440 --> 16:45.440]  So they quote spread COVID-19.
[16:45.440 --> 16:46.440]  They don't protect from it.
[16:46.440 --> 16:49.440]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control freak's faces.
[16:49.440 --> 16:51.440]  You buy one for $9.95.
[16:51.440 --> 16:52.440]  You get four more free.
[16:52.440 --> 16:55.440]  They're at cost infowarstore.com.
[16:55.440 --> 16:57.440]  It's Christmas in July.
[16:57.440 --> 17:00.440]  We ran the sale last year. It was very, very popular.
[17:00.440 --> 17:06.440]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year.
[17:06.440 --> 17:12.440]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[17:12.440 --> 17:17.440]  It's the American Eagle boldly spreading its wings sitting at the top of Betsy Ross's line.
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.440]  And the shirts are on sale right now at infowarstore.com.
[17:21.440 --> 17:27.440]  I got the idea of the Trump campaign having a similar shirt to media called Nancy, which of course it isn't.
[17:27.440 --> 17:32.440]  And since it's so triggering to the leftist and the globalist, well, we're going to make sure there's even more of these on the streets
[17:32.440 --> 17:37.440]  to spread the word and exercise our First Amendment in the face of these tyrants.
[17:37.440 --> 17:40.440]  We also have store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points.
[17:40.440 --> 17:46.440]  So whatever great item it is that you want, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points on your next order,
[17:46.440 --> 17:51.440]  at least 50% off across the board. Now I'm going to have to get this sale very, very soon.
[17:51.440 --> 17:52.440]  Call all these products. They're about to sell out.
[17:52.440 --> 18:19.440]  Just take advantage of it right now at infowarstore.com.
[18:19.440 --> 18:23.440]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm here live. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[18:23.440 --> 18:28.440]  David Knight knocks out of the park every weekday morning, 8 a.m., 11 a.m. right before me.
[18:28.440 --> 18:31.440]  Nobody prepares for a show like David Knight. That guy knows his stuff.
[18:31.440 --> 18:33.440]  And then the War Room with Owen Stroyer.
[18:33.440 --> 18:37.440]  And now Roger Stone was on yesterday, laid out some exclusive info.
[18:37.440 --> 18:41.440]  We'll be playing at the start of the next hour.
[18:41.440 --> 18:49.440]  Next segment, I'm going to get into more Hollywood operatives outing themselves as wanting to have sex with children.
[18:49.440 --> 18:51.440]  They just can't help themselves.
[18:51.440 --> 18:57.440]  And as the public begins to investigate, every rock you turn over, you find it because it's a cult.
[18:57.440 --> 19:00.440]  That's their plan.
[19:00.440 --> 19:03.440]  How do you say her name? Chrissy Teigen?
[19:03.440 --> 19:07.440]  I don't follow these people, but I know who this moron is.
[19:07.440 --> 19:12.440]  Seeing little girdles in the splits, half naked is just, I want to put myself in jail.
[19:12.440 --> 19:16.440]  And folks, there's a lot of parents that are nice and like their kids in cheerleading when they're young,
[19:16.440 --> 19:19.440]  or, you know, in the glamour stuff because they really think it's cute and funny.
[19:19.440 --> 19:25.440]  But then they're blind right next to the pedophiles, having no idea that that's what it is.
[19:25.440 --> 19:27.440]  That's what it is.
[19:27.440 --> 19:28.440]  It's sick.
[19:28.440 --> 19:30.440]  What do you think happened with John Benet Ramsey?
[19:30.440 --> 19:33.440]  What is happening with all this stuff? It's a cult.
[19:33.440 --> 19:35.440]  All right. I'm going to stop.
[19:35.440 --> 19:40.440]  I'm going to go to your phone calls right now, ladies and gentlemen, because I want to hear what you have to say.
[19:40.440 --> 19:42.440]  I want to get the focus for our audience.
[19:42.440 --> 19:46.440]  And I know the White House listens and others about what does Trump need to do?
[19:46.440 --> 19:48.440]  What do we need to do with 109 days out?
[19:48.440 --> 19:50.440]  And how is the deep stake going to strike back?
[19:50.440 --> 19:53.440]  Because I can tell you, I'll cover this later, but I want to get the calls now.
[19:53.440 --> 19:55.440]  They're losing.
[19:55.440 --> 19:57.440]  You saw some of the evidence of it.
[19:57.440 --> 20:00.440]  As the police won't wear the mask, not just in New York, but all over the country.
[20:00.440 --> 20:03.440]  The military is refusing to wear the mask because they know it's bull.
[20:03.440 --> 20:07.440]  Yeah, everybody tests positive and no one's sick.
[20:07.440 --> 20:14.440]  Or if you do get the problem, you go take Benadryl or you get an EpiPen or you inhale steroids and you're boom, you're fine.
[20:14.440 --> 20:17.440]  It's an autoimmune response, whatever it is.
[20:17.440 --> 20:27.440]  And the studies show three years ago that 5G tested in Wuhan was causing autoimmune response in the lungs like altitude sickness.
[20:27.440 --> 20:30.440]  And the people felt like someone was sitting on their chest.
[20:30.440 --> 20:38.440]  And David, I came out and said that he said he just got it from the ether and he does something else.
[20:38.440 --> 20:42.440]  And then people were calling me going, you had guests on three years ago about this.
[20:42.440 --> 20:47.440]  Doctors on about this and people found the articles and not from us mainline science.
[20:47.440 --> 20:50.440]  So 5G is involved.
[20:50.440 --> 20:53.440]  Plus the headlines admit 5G lowers your immune system.
[20:53.440 --> 20:57.440]  But when you're in 5G folks, it doesn't go very far, but it's super strong.
[20:57.440 --> 21:00.440]  It penetrates everything, every cell, everything.
[21:00.440 --> 21:02.440]  And your lungs don't know how to handle it.
[21:02.440 --> 21:03.440]  Is there a virus?
[21:03.440 --> 21:04.440]  Is it real?
[21:04.440 --> 21:07.440]  Yes, yes, there's a bunch of stuff going on, but it appears to be binary.
[21:07.440 --> 21:10.440]  And in the 5G, it affects it a lot worse.
[21:10.440 --> 21:12.440]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[21:12.440 --> 21:16.440]  Justin, Pastor Sam, Presley, Kenny, Andre.
[21:16.440 --> 21:18.440]  Folks aren't used to me taking calls early, are they?
[21:18.440 --> 21:19.440]  Well, we're doing it.
[21:19.440 --> 21:26.440]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Pastor Sam in Mexico.
[21:26.440 --> 21:29.440]  Pastor, welcome.
[21:29.440 --> 21:32.440]  Global war is on right now, Alex.
[21:32.440 --> 21:37.440]  I know that America is jaded from all the sandbox wars that we've seen the Bush wars.
[21:37.440 --> 21:41.440]  We've seen the Clinton wars and the last thing that we want is another war.
[21:41.440 --> 21:44.440]  But right now the envelope is pushing forward.
[21:44.440 --> 21:46.440]  It's coming out into open combat.
[21:46.440 --> 21:47.440]  This is something.
[21:47.440 --> 21:48.440]  That's right.
[21:48.440 --> 21:53.440]  We're in a real existential war with the globalist and the chai comms are the physical sword of the New World Order.
[21:53.440 --> 21:55.440]  And we're at war and Trump's fighting.
[21:55.440 --> 21:57.440]  They absolutely are.
[21:57.440 --> 22:10.440]  You know, we're in an arms race for flat top carriers, which a lot of people don't know that the one burning in San Diego now for the fourth day is a flat top mini aircraft carrier.
[22:10.440 --> 22:12.440]  It's a 40,000 ton ship.
[22:12.440 --> 22:14.440]  It has the whole watch class.
[22:14.440 --> 22:19.440]  Those are the type that you need to move troops into the South China Sea and take islands.
[22:19.440 --> 22:24.440]  And for F-35s, you know, the British have one, it's still not operational.
[22:24.440 --> 22:26.440]  It's still got Marine Corps pilots.
[22:26.440 --> 22:32.440]  The Japanese said in 2012, we're building helicopter carrying destroyers.
[22:32.440 --> 22:37.440]  And the Chinese freaked out and said, oh no, you're going to put jump jets on them someday.
[22:37.440 --> 22:40.440]  2018, Trump and Melania.
[22:40.440 --> 22:46.440]  It was really nice of the first lady to come along and kick all the tires and walk the deck of those helicopter carriers.
[22:46.440 --> 22:51.440]  And Trump said, it's on my article, gospel gunslingers at subscribestar.com.
[22:51.440 --> 22:55.440]  Trump said this very ship will be retrofitted to carry the F-35.
[22:55.440 --> 22:57.440]  That's right. Now, magically, it's on fire.
[22:57.440 --> 22:59.440]  Don't think for a minute that's probably not sabotage.
[22:59.440 --> 23:04.440]  I haven't covered that yet because we're on 100% sure, but the smart folks think that was probably set on fire on purpose.
[23:04.440 --> 23:07.440]  The Iranian general all but admitted it.
[23:07.440 --> 23:10.440]  And the quotations are on Hal Turner's website.
[23:10.440 --> 23:15.440]  Well, that's right. They said, we're going to start sabotaging you for Israel blowing up their nuclear site.
[23:15.440 --> 23:19.440]  You know, Savannah, their ships caught fire yesterday in the Iranian harbor.
[23:19.440 --> 23:21.440]  So Trump's using the space base weapons.
[23:21.440 --> 23:23.440]  I wish all the patriots would just get on board.
[23:23.440 --> 23:27.440]  We've got a bad taste from these stand box wars, but now we got to fight for our life.
[23:27.440 --> 23:29.440]  Well, I mean, here's the deal. Here's the deal.
[23:29.440 --> 23:31.440]  It's on and the big banks are bet on China.
[23:31.440 --> 23:34.440]  The globalists are bet on China and all these idiots are bet on China.
[23:34.440 --> 23:36.440]  They're going to lose.
[23:36.440 --> 23:43.440]  And so all these idiot race rioters funded by Soros and all the anti-foot people and BLM, you're idiots.
[23:43.440 --> 23:49.440]  We're in a war with China and Iran and the globalists are backing them.
[23:49.440 --> 23:51.440]  The Clintons and Obama are backing Iran.
[23:51.440 --> 23:53.440]  They've got spies inside our government.
[23:53.440 --> 23:58.440]  They gave China the office of personnel hack 24 million US government and their families.
[23:58.440 --> 24:02.440]  We have been totally penetrated and we either stand up and say no or it's over.
[24:02.440 --> 24:07.440]  And that's why all Americans to understand you're not going to have a good way of life under the globalist control.
[24:07.440 --> 24:11.440]  If you were just a sociopath, you would not want to be under the New World Order.
[24:11.440 --> 24:13.440]  You'd want America. This is so stupid.
[24:13.440 --> 24:19.440]  There's no reason anyone should want to be with globalism unless you want to be poor and a slave.
[24:19.440 --> 24:21.440]  These people are idiots.
[24:21.440 --> 24:25.440]  On wartime footing, we can lock up all the traders even in our own country.
[24:25.440 --> 24:30.440]  As long as we're still pretending that we're a peacetime nation, then it's going to be a threat.
[24:30.440 --> 24:32.440]  I'll say this. I'm not for just locking people up.
[24:32.440 --> 24:33.440]  But here's the problem.
[24:33.440 --> 24:40.440]  The ADL Southern Bobby Law Center on TV saying we're going to arrest everybody we don't like when we take over and we're going to end the country.
[24:40.440 --> 24:42.440]  So they've already brought us here.
[24:42.440 --> 24:46.440]  So you're right. We're in a war. We're in a domestic war. We're hanging on by our fingernails.
[24:46.440 --> 24:48.440]  If this degenerates, it's going to explode even faster.
[24:48.440 --> 24:54.440]  I predict if they take Trump out, there's going to be a power fight inside the globalist and they're going to double cross China regardless.
[24:54.440 --> 24:56.440]  The globalist, all they do is fight with each other.
[24:56.440 --> 24:58.440]  And this is a disaster. It has to stop.
[24:58.440 --> 25:02.440]  We have to have strength out of the president, strength out of the military, strength out of the people.
[25:02.440 --> 25:10.440]  Every citizen during this war instead of locked in your house scared of COVID to be on the streets saying no to the new world order.
[25:10.440 --> 25:12.440]  And look, it's not about worshiping the police.
[25:12.440 --> 25:13.440]  They're local government.
[25:13.440 --> 25:16.440]  They're the symbol of the lowest level of government of our rule.
[25:16.440 --> 25:20.440]  They want to overthrow the police, not to get rid of them, but to make them bow to them.
[25:20.440 --> 25:21.440]  It's in the news today.
[25:21.440 --> 25:23.440]  Pastor Samson, you raised this.
[25:23.440 --> 25:39.440]  The official plan of Soros and the old State Department plan and the old Justice Department plan is to literally have U.N. rules and a ADL Southern Poverty Law Center clash where they go through the background of any current police or future police.
[25:39.440 --> 25:42.440]  And if they're even a Trump supporter, they can't be a police officer.
[25:42.440 --> 25:43.440]  That's called hate.
[25:43.440 --> 25:53.440]  Literal political litmus test here to have a job. This is the takeover. There it is. Columbus proposed police witch hunt will send chills down your spine.
[25:53.440 --> 25:57.440]  Damn right. It's nationwide. It's not just in Columbus. It's already going on.
[25:57.440 --> 25:59.440]  Pastor Sam, what do you think is coming next?
[25:59.440 --> 26:01.440]  Last point on this.
[26:01.440 --> 26:18.440]  While all that is happening in the United States within the last 24 hours, we sent another destroyer right up into Nicholas Maduro's face and his illegally claimed waters sailed it right around the island of Curacao up against the Venezuelan, you know, 12 mile barrier.
[26:18.440 --> 26:32.440]  If America comes out and says who raw if America comes out and in support of those kind of exercises, then it will go to the next level and we'll continue to do them. You know, we've got all our new weapons right there in the Caribbean.
[26:32.440 --> 26:38.440]  Well, listen, I'm not a pro war guy until we're in a real war and we are in a real war and all these globalists respect the strength.
[26:38.440 --> 26:44.440]  That's all Venezuela, all the chai comms, all North Korea respects and we have to do we have to do. I can tell you that right now.
[26:44.440 --> 26:46.440]  I don't want to start a war, but they already started it.
[26:46.440 --> 26:53.440]  We'll be right back with your phone calls. I'm Alex Jones info wars.com tomorrow's news today. We are at war, folks.
[26:53.440 --> 27:11.440]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years. And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict large groups of human
[27:11.440 --> 27:28.440]  movements and activities, but even predict what individuals would do. And then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing, you can add stimuli through the AI systems, through the computers, through digital billboards, through face scanning through the social credit score to control people and make
[27:28.440 --> 27:39.440]  them act like you wanted to. But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up. It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[27:39.440 --> 27:50.440]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out. And it's something about 1000 times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[27:50.440 --> 28:10.440]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[28:20.440 --> 28:33.440]  It's a four step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner. Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars. But the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.

[29:18.440 --> 29:32.440]  As we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design, this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[29:32.440 --> 29:49.440]  It's been preplanned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory. And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[29:49.440 --> 30:05.440]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[30:19.440 --> 30:38.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. I am your host, Alex Jones, and I'm going to cover the Chrissy Teigen story next segment.
[30:38.440 --> 30:50.440]  Hopefully, and we're going to lay all this out. But right now, we're taking your phone calls about what does President Trump need to do? What do we need to do with 109 days out?
[30:50.440 --> 30:59.440]  And how are the globalists going to strike back? Because I think they're losing right now on many fronts, but they're launching military probes that are asymmetrical, that are covert.
[30:59.440 --> 31:13.440]  They're launching economic attacks, hack attacks, culture war, economic war. I mean, it's on to break the will of this country and bring us into the one world government, the carbon taxes, the sexualization of our children.
[31:13.440 --> 31:39.440]  I've got news on that front that's going to blow you away, but that's the next segment, and it ties together. They are now forcefully giving boys sex changes with chemicals. When they say they don't want it, not just the parents, the government, and not just in England where it all comes from, Tabistock Institute, but here in America.
[31:39.440 --> 31:52.440]  That's coming up next segment. But first, let's go to your calls. Now, I said I'd take a lot of calls and I spent a whole segment with one caller because he was making great points, but let's just try to roll through folks as fast as possible here.
[31:52.440 --> 32:10.440]  David in California, you're on the air. Welcome. Alright, I'm going to let you go. I appreciate your call, David. Got to turn that radio off. That's not how you listen. That's all delayed. Let David go. We're going to take a lot of calls here.
[32:10.440 --> 32:23.440]  Alright, I'm going to take another caller now. I'm going to talk to Justin here in a second, then I'm going to talk to Presley, then I'm going to talk to Kenny, then I'm going to talk to Andre. Okay, we're going to go to Justin in Indiana now. Justin, you're on the air. Welcome.
[32:23.440 --> 32:39.440]  Thank you, Alex. Take my call. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Everyone needs to be aware that they have two different kinds of polls, internal polling and then the fake polls that they release to the public.
[32:39.440 --> 32:55.440]  Biden's leading according to that, but their internal polls might show something different here soon. And if that does happen, which it will, Trump is leading right now. So they're going to do something, you know, as far as the COVID cases go, they're going to turn those up.
[32:55.440 --> 33:07.440]  They're going to say there's more deaths just to get us to roll over even more and make mass mandates everywhere. You're not going to be able to go anywhere without one pretty soon.
[33:07.440 --> 33:21.440]  And that's why Trump is taking control of the numbers because the UN is in control of the NIH and CDC. So Trump has to have health and human services actually do it himself and change the policy of someone has the sniffles you call it COVID-19.
[33:21.440 --> 33:35.440]  That's how they're creating this fraud. And Trump's doing the right thing. He sideline Fauci. Now he's just crediting Fauci. And then now he has to come out and point out Fauci owns part of the vaccine with Bill Gates. That has to be done.
[33:35.440 --> 33:54.440]  Yeah. And that definitely goes to show you just how much Trump has control because, I mean, we know that he would get rid of Fauci because he knows. So, but it's just that's how deep the deep state is. It's just he can't just let him go and jail him and stuff like that right now, even though I think he wants to.
[33:54.440 --> 33:58.440]  But it's a good thing that he hasn't briefed him in a couple months or whatever.
[33:58.440 --> 34:13.440]  He shows this permanent bureaucracy. Fauci has been in the federal government. I looked it up. 45 years. He's headed up those departments, three different positions for 40. He is a horrible globalist and Trump's just surrounded.
[34:13.440 --> 34:25.440]  You say, oh, well, fire everybody. You notice the headlines. Oh, the president's not allowed to fire Fauci. Well, the director of Health and Human Services ish. And but first Fauci can't be this hero up there.
[34:25.440 --> 34:31.440]  Fauci has to first be exposed and politically destroyed before he can be fired.
[34:31.440 --> 34:41.440]  Yes, absolutely. I wanted to make one more product plug. If I will, I had I've tried many of your products and I love them. I'm a college student.
[34:41.440 --> 34:55.440]  The eight pack power stack is the best thing for your book. I take it in the morning and I am good. I am so much more focused and it has helped me through school and you get a good night's sleep with the rest and recover.
[34:55.440 --> 35:09.440]  And it doesn't make you tired in the morning. It just relaxes you have good dreams of fish oil. And guys, if you haven't tried the eight pack power stack, give yourself a chance. It is it's worked wonders for me.
[35:09.440 --> 35:18.440]  Well, eight pack power stack is our best deal. It's 13 pills, half in the morning, half at night. That way you don't forget they're in their own little packets. They make great gifts.
[35:18.440 --> 35:27.440]  And this is for people that aren't in the habit of taking vitamins and minerals like me or others. But you just remember to do it because you have two packs. It'll change your life because it's all super nutrients.
[35:27.440 --> 35:38.440]  I mean, we put $25 of product in a box of this. I can tell you, they have best selling ones that on average are $5 a product. And these nutrients are so great, people still do great with that.
[35:38.440 --> 35:51.440]  This is the strongest best multivitamin mineral trace element pack there is out there and it's available at info or store.com. I really appreciate your call. Thank you so much, Justin.
[35:51.440 --> 35:58.440]  All right, let's take another call here. Let's go to Presley in North Carolina. Presley, welcome.
[35:58.440 --> 36:09.440]  All right, Alex, I'm fired up. I'm so glad to talk to you, man. I wish all these Patriots would get as mad about this mass crap as everybody that hates Trump. I wish we could funnel that same energy into our calls.
[36:09.440 --> 36:21.440]  I don't know why everybody can't, but there's a coin shortage going on. I work at Walmart and they are like giving people such a hard time about exact change and using cashless everything.
[36:21.440 --> 36:30.440]  They've always wanted to push cashless. In fact, the UN a few years ago called for a coin shortage to do this. They're using COVID-19 to do it. Here it is.
[36:30.440 --> 36:39.440]  Coin shortage strikes Walmart customers required to pay with card itself. Check out. They're getting rid of humans at the checkouts to begin with. This is all evil.
[36:39.440 --> 36:48.440]  Don't let them get rid of cash. Once they've gotten rid of cash, the ADL can literally turn you off where you can't eat or have a job and you'll die on the side of the street.
[36:48.440 --> 36:57.440]  Okay, the ADL Southern Parvy Law Center, they run it all. They run the cashless society and they want that control to kill any underground economy. It's the mark of the beast.
[36:57.440 --> 37:06.440]  That's right. I'll tell you what, I'll take that so-called news from Bubba Wallace's garage and I'll use that thing up and down Pennsylvania Avenue and we'll fix everything with one news, baby.
[37:06.440 --> 37:08.440]  God bless America.
[37:08.440 --> 37:17.440]  God bless you, brother. I'm glad you're pissed. It's out of control. No one should use the self-checkout lanes, but to make you to do it, they always will have like one person down there.
[37:17.440 --> 37:29.440]  Well, go stand in line for an hour. Don't use the self-checkouts. It's not an innovation. It is an enslavement, a post-human world. It's that simple.
[37:29.440 --> 37:37.440]  Walmart, Amazon, they're all super evil. But if you're going to go to Walmart, I know in some areas the only place you can go. Sometimes I'll be out in the country.
[37:37.440 --> 37:47.440]  I need some shotgun shells or need some oil or whatever. I got to go to Walmart because the next place is 50 miles away. Go to the checkout lane. Have a human there.
[37:47.440 --> 37:51.440]  All right. Angel in Florida, you're on the air. Welcome. Thanks for holding.
[37:51.440 --> 37:55.440]  Hey, Alex. Thank you so much for taking my call. I really appreciate it. Can you hear me okay?
[37:55.440 --> 37:56.440]  I can, sir. Thank you.
[37:56.440 --> 38:06.440]  Excellent. First, I just want to thank you and the whole team. You guys do phenomenal work. My family and I are so grateful for everything you're doing and we constantly are praying for you guys.
[38:06.440 --> 38:11.440]  Well, sir, back at you. We're totally grateful for you. You understand that? I really appreciate you.
[38:11.440 --> 38:23.440]  Just, you know, looking at these products, definitely want to get into it and especially take full advantage of the Christmas deals that you have going on on the site. So hopefully I'll be able to get that order in soon.
[38:23.440 --> 38:32.440]  Well, you're the ones that have kept us in position under incredible attacks. And it's so good to have you holding me in position. That's why when you call in and thank me, I'm like, are you kidding?
[38:32.440 --> 38:43.440]  They would have already had me in prison or destroyed me by now. I'm literally surviving because of you and we're all in this together, brother. So we're just together. No need to thank me. I just want we're all in this together.
[38:43.440 --> 38:52.440]  You're a God sent. You're a leader and I'm proud of you and I'm grateful for your work. Just wanted to just soak. So again, we keep going back and forth with Fauci and Gates.
[38:52.440 --> 39:10.440]  How much more evidence is my question? We know that they did the chimeric version of this COVID-19. We know about the moratorium that Fauci went ahead and, you know, took taxpayer money out to Wuhan to continue their experiments creating this Frankenstein virus.
[39:10.440 --> 39:23.440]  We know that Fauci double crossed as a doctor, Judy Murkowitz and put her in jail for five years for for stuff that was related to HIV. We know that Gates owns the patent to COVID-19 and all this other stuff.
[39:23.440 --> 39:27.440]  Why isn't Trump just bringing them in for questioning?
[39:27.440 --> 39:40.440]  Angel, that's the that's the trillion dollar question. Don't hang up. I'm going to come back and address it and get your take on it. But but but we do know what's going on with that. And we also know what's going on in a whole bunch of other fronts. It's all just insane.
[39:40.440 --> 39:58.440]  But yeah, I mean, it's all. See, it's like Gerbil said, if you're going to commit a crime, commit one so big, it's too evil to prosecute. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[40:10.440 --> 40:28.440]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.videonewswars.com, infowars.com, Paul Watson sites, summit.news and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic.
[40:28.440 --> 40:37.440]  Thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own destinies.
[40:37.440 --> 40:52.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy. But being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it. So take action or be slaves.

[41:53.440 --> 42:07.440]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup, a second cup of the day. It's really strong. I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates Jack a really aggressive boy and the coffee has to wake up America coffee there by loves highest rated from the choppers mountains.
[42:07.440 --> 42:17.440]  It's beyond Mexican coffee beyond Guatemalan coffee. It's the best coffee in the world. It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests hand selected beyond organic. Wildcrafted wake up America coffee.
[42:17.440 --> 42:25.440]  People are blown away by how good it is. Same stuff sold in Whole Foods under another name for $30 for the same size container. Yes, folks, we've been selling it 10 years, never raised the price.
[42:25.440 --> 42:48.440]  $19.95 is that big old bag 99% reviews 598 reviews 4.9 stars on third party sites sign up for auto ship additional 10% off get it out of the Liberty show forget to get it each month or every two months you can click out to nine months whenever you want the new order coming in 15 days nine months Patriot blend medium roast only has a 98% out of 814 reviews.
[42:48.440 --> 43:06.440]  It's not as popular. Anyways, it's all at info more store.com.
[43:06.440 --> 43:25.440]  It's the end of the world as we know it and I don't feel fine. This entire takeover has been battle pun end blueprinted war game field marshaled by the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the Fortune 100.
[43:25.440 --> 43:40.440]  This is the post human takeover. The new skits tighter when you comply, not looser. The entire COVID-19 operation as a hoax. Now they admit the quote death numbers are dropping because those are fake where they count people that died of something else.
[43:40.440 --> 43:55.440]  It's all about how many cases there are. And now they're saying most of the population will get it. And then no one can go outside ever again. It's totally insane. It's a fraud. It's all a lie.
[44:10.440 --> 44:24.440]  There's a golden ammunition just inside the doorway using only an emergency.
[44:24.440 --> 44:45.440]  Chrissy Teigen married a John legend, big buddies with Jeffrey Epstein and Gisling Maxwell that feminists are calling an icon now sick freaks. They're modern feminists are a cult of killing their own babies. She's got a bunch of tweets salivating over little five year old girls.
[44:45.440 --> 44:56.440]  Because you know the media is focused on the 15 year old girls 14 year old girls far worse than that. Of course, you know you do with five year olds after you're done with them.
[44:56.440 --> 44:59.440]  You chop them up.
[44:59.440 --> 45:03.440]  It's five year olds talk.
[45:03.440 --> 45:18.440]  Yeah, this wasn't about raping kids is about killing kids and taking that energy and when you do that you get real close to the devil because God gets real far away from you and the devil can't get close to you unless you've totally committed homicidal murder against children.
[45:18.440 --> 45:23.440]  And once you've killed innocence, beg for their mommy while you do it.
[45:23.440 --> 45:30.440]  Then the gates of hell open up and you get a big demon.
[45:30.440 --> 45:36.440]  And these evil people commit mass atrocities to get closer to Satan.
[45:36.440 --> 45:39.440]  Hitler did the same thing.
[45:39.440 --> 45:45.440]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[45:45.440 --> 45:49.440]  But right now, let's finish up with Angel.
[45:49.440 --> 45:53.440]  Angel you were bringing up accountability Fauci gates all of it. Here's the thing.
[45:53.440 --> 45:55.440]  I have about 100 crew members.
[45:55.440 --> 45:56.440]  Little more now.
[45:56.440 --> 45:59.440]  Maybe 10 or 15 contractors on top of that.
[45:59.440 --> 46:05.440]  And if they weren't really on the program and supporting me, this place would fall apart like that.
[46:05.440 --> 46:11.440]  In fact, I have temper tantrums sometimes and I could be a jerk and they just understand the pressure I'm under and put up with it.
[46:11.440 --> 46:12.440]  I'm not proud of it.
[46:12.440 --> 46:20.440]  But I mean, you know, it's it's it's if they weren't putting up with me and putting up with each other and really cared about the mission, this place wouldn't run.
[46:20.440 --> 46:24.440]  Trump's got millions of people under him.
[46:24.440 --> 46:33.440]  And tens of thousands in management positions and most of them are ladder climbing cowards that are too faced at the best.
[46:33.440 --> 46:39.440]  And they just want to be there in four years or in, you know, 100 days when Trump's gone.
[46:39.440 --> 46:42.440]  And so.
[46:42.440 --> 46:48.440]  Joe Scalzen is right because there's few people I can get on that have like super deep knowledge about everything like Joe Scalzen.
[46:48.440 --> 46:50.440]  Because he's been studying this 60 years.
[46:50.440 --> 46:52.440]  I've been studying it 30 years.
[46:52.440 --> 46:54.440]  And he talks about something.
[46:54.440 --> 46:55.440]  I know what he's talking about.
[46:55.440 --> 46:56.440]  I talk about something he knows.
[46:56.440 --> 46:57.440]  He knows I know what I'm talking about.
[46:57.440 --> 46:58.440]  I'm just making stuff up.
[46:58.440 --> 47:02.440]  But it's such deep knowledge where you get into the knowledge.
[47:02.440 --> 47:04.440]  So this connects to that and this connects to this.
[47:04.440 --> 47:05.440]  You learn how it works.
[47:05.440 --> 47:08.440]  You learn what's to send for you learn what's not.
[47:08.440 --> 47:10.440]  Trump is into free market.
[47:10.440 --> 47:11.440]  He likes America.
[47:11.440 --> 47:12.440]  He knows his corrupt groups.
[47:12.440 --> 47:13.440]  He wants to fix things.
[47:13.440 --> 47:17.440]  But he has been shocked by the level of corruption.
[47:17.440 --> 47:20.440]  He thought he could go in there and say, hey, let's make America great.
[47:20.440 --> 47:22.440]  You know, everybody can still be rich.
[47:22.440 --> 47:23.440]  We'll pump up the stock market.
[47:23.440 --> 47:24.440]  You all get a bunch of money.
[47:24.440 --> 47:25.440]  Military.
[47:25.440 --> 47:26.440]  You can do what you want.
[47:26.440 --> 47:28.440]  You know, as long as it's constitutional, I'm not going to be on your ass.
[47:28.440 --> 47:30.440]  We're not going to put you in jail for BS.
[47:30.440 --> 47:33.440]  He thought everybody would get with the program and Trump is like shocked.
[47:33.440 --> 47:38.440]  Like, there's this many people that go out of their way to destroy the country.
[47:38.440 --> 47:43.440]  And so now three and a half plus years in, Trump's educated now.
[47:43.440 --> 47:46.440]  They're really worried because he's gone on the offense.
[47:46.440 --> 47:48.440]  That's the headline today for the show.
[47:48.440 --> 47:52.440]  Trump, those on offense, Trump awakens, goes on offense.
[47:52.440 --> 47:54.440]  And he is going on offense.
[47:54.440 --> 47:57.440]  You're now seeing.
[47:57.440 --> 48:04.440]  But if I had a will and I'd climb Mount Everest before, but I didn't have equipment and that
[48:04.440 --> 48:08.440]  means people that work with him, people that do what he says, people that have courage.
[48:08.440 --> 48:19.440]  He doesn't have the spikes or the boots or the ice hook or the hammer or gloves.
[48:19.440 --> 48:23.440]  And so he's trying to climb Mount Everest in his underwear.
[48:23.440 --> 48:26.440]  But, you know, that's just the way that it goes.
[48:26.440 --> 48:29.440]  I mean, basically we won a Revolutionary War without shoes.
[48:29.440 --> 48:31.440]  We'll win this fight.
[48:31.440 --> 48:35.440]  It's a shameful how much scum there is at upper management level.
[48:35.440 --> 48:38.440]  I'll tell you this, because I know him from experience.
[48:38.440 --> 48:43.440]  The federal government at the mid-level and the actual, where people are working are good people on average.
[48:43.440 --> 48:47.440]  But it's those top ones, the globalists have put in, like Fauci.
[48:47.440 --> 48:53.440]  So Trump gets in and you see China locked down and all this craziness and Democrats are like,
[48:53.440 --> 48:56.440]  oh, don't lock down and Trump goes, oh, wait a minute, there's a setup here.
[48:56.440 --> 48:57.440]  So it is a limited lockdown.
[48:57.440 --> 48:59.440]  So they couldn't say he didn't respond.
[48:59.440 --> 49:00.440]  He understood that.
[49:00.440 --> 49:04.440]  But then now it's obvious they want to keep it locked down to hurt the economy, hurt the American people.
[49:04.440 --> 49:05.440]  They're lying about the numbers.
[49:05.440 --> 49:08.440]  Trump is doing all he can do is bypass the UN.
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.440]  Then he finds out, well, the CDC is still under the command of the UN.
[49:13.440 --> 49:16.440]  So now he bypasses the CDC.
[49:16.440 --> 49:18.440]  He's doing some big moves.
[49:18.440 --> 49:23.440]  But here's Trump's Achilles heel.
[49:23.440 --> 49:26.440]  And, you know, it's not his Achilles heel.
[49:26.440 --> 49:28.440]  The stock market is a fraud.
[49:28.440 --> 49:29.440]  It's overinflated.
[49:29.440 --> 49:30.440]  It's all fiat.
[49:30.440 --> 49:31.440]  So is the Chinese stock market.
[49:31.440 --> 49:32.440]  So is the EU.
[49:32.440 --> 49:35.440]  Now it's a game of what fiat system ends up on top.
[49:35.440 --> 49:39.440]  Fiscal conservatism, all that's out the window now.
[49:39.440 --> 49:43.440]  The question is, who's going to be in charge of the coming fiasco?
[49:43.440 --> 49:48.440]  We don't want the UN and the Chikoms in charge of it and dictating to us that we're in debt to them,
[49:48.440 --> 49:51.440]  like the Versailles Treaty and the Germans at World War I.
[49:51.440 --> 49:53.440]  We really don't want to go that way.
[49:53.440 --> 50:01.440]  So I see Trump given a horrible situation saying, let's beat them then at their own game.
[50:01.440 --> 50:03.440]  But realizing one big bailout's okay.
[50:03.440 --> 50:04.440]  Two's too much.
[50:04.440 --> 50:07.440]  They want to keep it locked down so the second bailout's needed.
[50:07.440 --> 50:12.440]  Because the plan is to make the dollar unsolvent and tank us completely,
[50:12.440 --> 50:15.440]  which has been Soros' hard on from the beginning.
[50:15.440 --> 50:19.440]  I mean, I was in the 80s watching Lair News Hour, McNeill Lair News Hour,
[50:19.440 --> 50:23.440]  and it was like George Soros, master criminal, who crashed the pound and crashed this,
[50:23.440 --> 50:26.440]  trying to crash the dollar, 1989, you know.
[50:26.440 --> 50:27.440]  He failed.
[50:27.440 --> 50:28.440]  He should be arrested.
[50:28.440 --> 50:31.440]  That was where he just spent billions buying the media off.
[50:31.440 --> 50:38.440]  And now he's the nicest guy since, you know, sliced bread, since Keelan Pie.
[50:38.440 --> 50:42.440]  So that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[50:42.440 --> 50:45.440]  And it's a fiasco.
[50:45.440 --> 50:48.440]  The whole thing's a crisis and it's crazy.
[50:48.440 --> 50:54.440]  But if Trump arrests Fauci or does that look like, oh, he's arresting people,
[50:54.440 --> 50:57.440]  as if the Justice Department even follows orders, you know, just because he's mad at him.
[50:57.440 --> 50:59.440]  He has to discredit him first.
[50:59.440 --> 51:00.440]  So that's what's happening.
[51:00.440 --> 51:02.440]  America's fighting for its life.
[51:02.440 --> 51:04.440]  Angel, I guess, just hung up.
[51:04.440 --> 51:08.440]  I was about to go back to Angel, but I understand Angel, he had to go.
[51:08.440 --> 51:09.440]  Here's what I'll do.
[51:09.440 --> 51:12.440]  I'll come back in the next short segment, take a few calls, then I'll hit the whole pedophile scandal
[51:12.440 --> 51:15.440]  that just broke, the big one, the confirmed one, the admitted one.
[51:15.440 --> 51:17.440]  You know, way fairer you could ask, is that real?
[51:17.440 --> 51:18.440]  What is that?
[51:18.440 --> 51:19.440]  This is real.
[51:19.440 --> 51:20.440]  This is big.
[51:20.440 --> 51:25.440]  It's a window into something really important that we're going to be exposing.
[51:25.440 --> 51:30.440]  So we'll continue on with your phone calls separately.
[51:30.440 --> 51:33.440]  We have a new t-shirt, two different t-shirts.
[51:33.440 --> 51:36.440]  They came out earlier this week, USA Today, CNN.
[51:36.440 --> 51:41.440]  They said Trump campaign has a Nazi eagle for its symbol.
[51:41.440 --> 51:44.440]  And it was an American eagle spreading its wings like the Marine Corps,
[51:44.440 --> 51:47.440]  standing on a globe that was the American flag.
[51:47.440 --> 51:50.440]  The triggering thing was the globe was the American flag.
[51:50.440 --> 51:55.440]  And so I said, why don't we make one even better?
[51:55.440 --> 51:58.440]  So we've got two different eagle t-shirts at infowarstore.com.
[51:58.440 --> 52:02.440]  One with a ring of 20 stars, one that doesn't.
[52:02.440 --> 52:05.440]  It's got the Betsy Ross flag on the eagle's chest.
[52:05.440 --> 52:08.440]  There's another one where the Betsy Ross flag is what the eagle's standing on.
[52:08.440 --> 52:10.440]  On the back, it says infowars.com.
[52:10.440 --> 52:11.440]  Let's show them the back.
[52:11.440 --> 52:13.440]  On the back, it's got infowars.com.
[52:13.440 --> 52:14.440]  Keep America great.
[52:14.440 --> 52:17.440]  This is a triggering shirt.
[52:17.440 --> 52:19.440]  It's a high quality shirt.
[52:19.440 --> 52:21.440]  It's got printing on the front, the back, and the arm.
[52:21.440 --> 52:23.440]  So the shirts are cost us like $10 a piece.
[52:23.440 --> 52:25.440]  You get it for $19.95.
[52:25.440 --> 52:26.440]  No reviews yet.
[52:26.440 --> 52:29.440]  They're being printed right now in Austin, Texas.
[52:29.440 --> 52:31.440]  And they'll be shipping out to you next week.
[52:31.440 --> 52:33.440]  Get your orders in now.
[52:33.440 --> 52:36.440]  I was thinking, what's the iconic ad?
[52:36.440 --> 52:40.440]  The iconic t-shirt to promote freedom out there in the public.
[52:40.440 --> 52:42.440]  Because we're all a walking billboard.
[52:42.440 --> 52:46.440]  And I was already, two weeks ago, doing American eagle designs.
[52:46.440 --> 52:49.440]  And then I saw that and I said, this is what we're going to go with.
[52:49.440 --> 52:50.440]  Even better than the Trump one.
[52:50.440 --> 52:52.440]  I mean, quite frankly, it is better.
[52:52.440 --> 52:56.440]  And they're calling the American eagle, the bald eagle, Nazi.
[52:56.440 --> 52:59.440]  They're calling the American flag Nazi.
[52:59.440 --> 53:00.440]  It's in the news.
[53:00.440 --> 53:04.440]  They're trying to cancel Star Spangled Banner at NFL games.
[53:04.440 --> 53:06.440]  They're announcing the first few games.
[53:06.440 --> 53:07.440]  They're not going to have it.
[53:07.440 --> 53:09.440]  They have some communist anthem.
[53:09.440 --> 53:13.440]  But they can't stop you from wearing this shirt.
[53:13.440 --> 53:19.440]  And it is a bold, beautiful, original American eagle that is like just absolutely all got
[53:19.440 --> 53:22.440]  its feathers all fluffed up and is, and it's pissed off.
[53:22.440 --> 53:26.440]  And it's got olive branch in one hand and a bunch of arrows in the other.
[53:26.440 --> 53:27.440]  So we're here for peace.
[53:27.440 --> 53:33.440]  But if you want war, baby, you are going to get what you came looking for.
[53:33.440 --> 53:35.440]  So I hope this shirt gets seen all over the country.
[53:35.440 --> 53:39.440]  I hope at the RNC and DNC that are going to be really weird events, but we're going to
[53:39.440 --> 53:40.440]  be there.
[53:40.440 --> 53:43.440]  I hope that these shirts are dominant.
[53:43.440 --> 53:44.440]  Get them today.
[53:44.440 --> 53:45.440]  infowarstore.com.
[53:45.440 --> 53:47.440]  There's free shipping right now.
[53:47.440 --> 53:50.440]  So no shipping on that shirt.

[53:58.440 --> 53:59.440]  three, nine.
[53:59.440 --> 54:00.440]  And you can get that.
[54:00.440 --> 54:03.440]  And yeah, we were unable to launch the new products this week.
[54:03.440 --> 54:05.440]  There's, I said there's eight of them.
[54:05.440 --> 54:06.440]  There's actually 10 of them.
[54:06.440 --> 54:10.440]  You count the toothpaste and the mouthwash and there's eight others.
[54:10.440 --> 54:11.440]  It's 10.
[54:11.440 --> 54:14.440]  It's 10 products that came in that are new a year in development.
[54:14.440 --> 54:17.440]  And then there's one certificate we got to get before we do it.
[54:17.440 --> 54:21.440]  So I just said, fine.
[54:21.440 --> 54:22.440]  Christmas comes in July.
[54:22.440 --> 54:26.440]  Storewide for shipping, double page, three of points, 50 to 60% off storewide, including
[54:26.440 --> 54:28.440]  Rainforest and stuff that's been sold out and infowarstore.com.
[54:28.440 --> 54:29.440]  That's how you find us.
[54:29.440 --> 54:33.440]  I want to thank you all for your support, but please support those local radio stations
[54:33.440 --> 54:35.440]  and tell them you appreciate them, become a sponsor and spread the word.
[54:35.440 --> 54:38.440]  We'll be back with your phone calls and a lot more in the second hour.
[54:38.440 --> 54:39.440]  Stay with us.
[54:42.440 --> 54:43.440]  It's Christmas in July.
[54:43.440 --> 54:45.440]  We ran the sale last year.
[54:45.440 --> 54:46.440]  It was very, very popular.
[54:46.440 --> 54:51.440]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important
[54:51.440 --> 54:52.440]  election year.
[54:52.440 --> 54:58.440]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[54:58.440 --> 55:03.440]  It's the American Eagle boldly spreading its wings, sitting at the top of Betsy Ross's
[55:03.440 --> 55:07.440]  flag and the shirts are on sale right now in infowarstore.com.
[55:07.440 --> 55:13.440]  I got the idea for the Trump campaign having a similar shirt to media called Nancy, which
[55:13.440 --> 55:14.440]  of course it isn't.
[55:14.440 --> 55:17.440]  And since it's so triggering to the leftist and globalist, well, we're going to make
[55:17.440 --> 55:22.440]  sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and exercise our First
[55:22.440 --> 55:24.440]  Amendment in the face of these tyrants.
[55:24.440 --> 55:27.440]  We also have storewide free shipping, double page, three of points.
[55:27.440 --> 55:31.440]  So whatever great item it is that you want storewide free shipping, double page, three
[55:31.440 --> 55:35.440]  of points on your next order and at least 50% off across the board.
[55:35.440 --> 55:37.440]  Now I'm going to have to end this sale very, very soon.
[55:37.440 --> 55:39.440]  The college products are about to sell out.
[55:39.440 --> 55:43.440]  Let's take advantage of it right now in infowarstore.com.
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.440]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning and I wasn't even close to downtown, but I
[55:47.440 --> 55:50.440]  was parked the whole side street going to this business.
[55:50.440 --> 55:56.440]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese walking
[55:56.440 --> 55:59.440]  down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me.
[55:59.440 --> 56:04.440]  And here I am parked a truck with the windows up and the woman stops and points at me so
[56:04.440 --> 56:07.440]  they stop and they wait while I'm inside my truck.
[56:07.440 --> 56:12.440]  Truck started and they sit there and stretch, keeps pointing and they put their hands out
[56:12.440 --> 56:18.440]  like they're waiting for me to go because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[56:18.440 --> 56:22.440]  And so then I just sat there so they acted angry and walked past me.
[56:22.440 --> 56:28.440]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone, but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[56:28.440 --> 56:29.440]  This is mental illness.
[56:29.440 --> 56:32.440]  People are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[56:32.440 --> 56:34.440]  This is all cult programming.
[56:34.440 --> 56:35.440]  This is all about submitting.
[56:35.440 --> 56:38.440]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing.
[56:38.440 --> 56:40.440]  It's all a giant fraud.
[56:40.440 --> 57:07.440]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[57:07.440 --> 57:11.440]  We're just living it.
[57:11.440 --> 57:14.440]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[57:14.440 --> 57:16.440]  Going in the order they were received unless they disagree.
[57:16.440 --> 57:20.440]  Does anybody disagree here?
[57:20.440 --> 57:21.440]  Scott in Texas.
[57:21.440 --> 57:22.440]  Thanks for holding started on the air.
[57:22.440 --> 57:23.440]  Go ahead.
[57:23.440 --> 57:27.440]  Hey, I want to give a big to you.
[57:27.440 --> 57:28.440]  Did I talk to you brother?
[57:28.440 --> 57:29.440]  What's on your mind?
[57:29.440 --> 57:34.440]  Hey, just like, have you ever heard of Kent Hoven?
[57:34.440 --> 57:39.440]  I was just trying to recommend him as a guest once in a while.
[57:39.440 --> 57:49.440]  My question is, what else can you take to decalcify your pineal gland besides the X2?
[57:49.440 --> 57:51.440]  Well, that's a good question.
[57:51.440 --> 57:53.440]  I should ask some of the experts.
[57:53.440 --> 58:00.440]  I mean, I know that the bad halogens fluoride bromide bromine chloride, that all gets into
[58:00.440 --> 58:03.440]  the pineal and calcifies it.
[58:03.440 --> 58:08.440]  In fact, but I don't know what else is known to be able to decalcify that.
[58:08.440 --> 58:11.440]  I know that pure iodine is able to do it.
[58:11.440 --> 58:13.440]  What do you think?
[58:13.440 --> 58:20.440]  Yeah, no, I started a few months ago and yeah, like you said, it took a couple weeks to kind
[58:20.440 --> 58:25.440]  of run you down, but then the boost of energy, but your lifestyle becomes better with it.
[58:25.440 --> 58:27.440]  I'm truly grateful for that.
[58:27.440 --> 58:29.440]  I put my kids on it.
[58:29.440 --> 58:30.440]  My wife's on it.
[58:30.440 --> 58:31.440]  We all love it.
[58:31.440 --> 58:33.440]  What do you think?
[58:33.440 --> 58:35.440]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[58:35.440 --> 58:37.440]  What do you think Trump should do?
[58:37.440 --> 58:39.440]  He's definitely got to go in the offense.
[58:39.440 --> 58:41.440]  Like you said, he's just got to be straight with us.
[58:41.440 --> 58:43.440]  Tell us what's really going on.
[58:43.440 --> 58:45.440]  Give us much information to us if he can.
[58:45.440 --> 58:49.440]  Like he has to be honest with the public and we will respond.
[58:49.440 --> 58:55.440]  The Patriots will respond in a positive way.
[58:55.440 --> 58:58.440]  He just has to go after Fauci and the vaccine and Bill Gates.
[58:58.440 --> 59:01.440]  It will crash the stock market.
[59:01.440 --> 59:02.440]  He can't worry.
[59:02.440 --> 59:06.440]  I mean, the bubble is already deflating like it's eventual.
[59:06.440 --> 59:08.440]  It will happen eventually.
[59:08.440 --> 59:13.440]  He just has to be real with us.
[59:13.440 --> 59:16.440]  Getting back briefly, the iodine.
[59:16.440 --> 59:17.440]  What was it?
[59:17.440 --> 59:21.440]  I mean, how many weeks till you felt toxic taking it and then how long till you didn't
[59:21.440 --> 59:23.440]  feel toxic and then hit the other side?
[59:23.440 --> 59:25.440]  Because that's what everybody reports.
[59:25.440 --> 59:29.440]  Yeah, it started about two weeks after I started taking it.
[59:29.440 --> 59:33.440]  And then I mean, my wife even asked me, she's like, what's wrong with you?
[59:33.440 --> 59:35.440]  You just seem so distant.
[59:35.440 --> 59:40.440]  And yeah, for maybe two, three weeks process after the other side, like it was just,
[59:40.440 --> 59:42.440]  I'm a different person.
[59:42.440 --> 59:43.440]  Like I've always been outgoing.
[59:43.440 --> 59:47.440]  Well, that's what happens is, and I want to get technical, but because I'm not a doctor,
[59:47.440 --> 59:51.440]  but this is what I believe when I've seen, you've got all that fluoride and things in
[59:51.440 --> 59:55.440]  there clouding up the pineal gland, which they admit is the seed of the soul.
[59:55.440 --> 59:59.440]  And then when it starts breaking up and flaking out and moving out, it gets kind of worse
[59:59.440 --> 1:00:01.440]  for a while because it's breaking up.
[1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:04.440]  But then after that clears out, then it's like one morning you wake up and it's like,
[1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:07.440]  wow, and the dreams you have and just everything.
[1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:09.440]  And again, iodine is essential.
[1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:13.440]  And no one knows that it's almost completely out of the soil.
[1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:14.440]  It's not in the food.
[1:00:14.440 --> 1:00:19.440]  The you in admits that almost three billion people have mental disabilities on the planet
[1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:22.440]  have lower IQs because of lack of iodine.
[1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:24.440]  Is that not insane?
[1:00:24.440 --> 1:00:25.440]  It is insane.
[1:00:25.440 --> 1:00:31.440]  My five year old was asked just two days ago at her martial arts class, other kids were
[1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:33.440]  like, Hey, do you have this game on your tablet?
[1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:35.440]  She's like, why do I need a tablet?
[1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:36.440]  She's a five year old.
[1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:37.440]  She said, why do I need a tablet?
[1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:38.440]  And they're like, what do you mean?
[1:00:38.440 --> 1:00:39.440]  What do you do for fun?
[1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:41.440]  She's like, I'm a kid.
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:42.440]  I go outside and play.
[1:00:42.440 --> 1:00:43.440]  I play with my toys.
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:45.440]  Like I use my imagination.
[1:00:45.440 --> 1:00:51.440]  The other children grouped around her like she, you can see a leadership fall.
[1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:55.440]  They were just blown away that she was like, I do not want tablets.
[1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:58.440]  And I give it credit to no four.
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:01.440]  I did her system all five years.
[1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:02.440]  No vaccines.
[1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:04.440]  She's smarter than anyone.
[1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:08.440]  I'd like any child I've known and I've raised five kids that aren't my own.
[1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:10.440]  She's completely different.
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:11.440]  And I give it credit.
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:12.440]  No vaccines.
[1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:16.440]  I give it credit in this last few months to the X2 and X3.
[1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:23.440]  It's just completely different when you don't give kids fluoride compared to, say,
[1:01:23.440 --> 1:01:28.440]  her sister that has had fluoride.
[1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:29.440]  Well, that's it.
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:31.440]  I mean, iodine is the opposite of fluoride.
[1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:33.440]  The globalists want you to have fluoride.
[1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:35.440]  They don't want you to have iodine.
[1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:36.440]  I wonder why.
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:37.440]  Amazing testimony.
[1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:38.440]  God bless you, Scott.
[1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:40.440]  And I know you think of those great children you've got.
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:41.440]  We pray for them.
[1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:44.440]  I'll be right back with more calls and I'll hit the big pedophile ring story.
[1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:13.440]  That's right.
[1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:16.440]  That's the code word for Bill Gates's operation.
[1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:22.440]  He carries out with his good little buddy, Dr. Fauci, in the surgeon cult.
[1:02:22.440 --> 1:02:28.440]  As you know, for girls, there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels.
[1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:34.440]  One of them is the vampire, the werewolf, the billionaire, and who else?
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:35.440]  Oh, that's right.
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:37.440]  There's the surgeon and then there's one other one.
[1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:41.440]  And it's so much fun to be ruled over by these psychotic psychopaths.
[1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:47.440]  It's so good to know that there are masters and they're coming to rape us with their inoculations.
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:49.440]  Psychopaths are so hot.
[1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:50.440]  Oh, yeah.
[1:03:01.440 --> 1:03:04.440]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:07.440]  It is the Alex Jones show.
[1:03:22.440 --> 1:03:24.440]  We're going to continue with your phone calls in a moment.
[1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:33.440]  I am Alex Jones, your host, but let's look at Chrissy Teigen and her creepy boyfriend and all the weird stuff that she's involved in.
[1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:40.440]  People started looking through her Twitter because she would fly around with Jeffrey Epstein on his plane and Gisela and Maxwell.
[1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:45.440]  And they found the quotes where she talked about, I'd like to eat people at restaurants.
[1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:50.440]  I get off sexually on little girls spreading their legs.
[1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:53.440]  You know, sexual kids is no big deal.
[1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:58.440]  You can go read these tweets for yourself.
[1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:06.440]  Chrissy Teigen blocks one million Twitter accounts driving conspiracy theories that links her to Jeffrey Epstein, Fox News.
[1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:27.440]  But it goes on to admit she's friends with him, flew on the pedophile airplane, and then she made all of these disgusting comments on Twitter that she's now been deleting that she doesn't want people to see.
[1:04:27.440 --> 1:04:44.440]  Meanwhile, shock, Amazon sells sports bag with a photo of a child with tape over their mouth inside the bag.
[1:04:44.440 --> 1:04:47.440]  They put the color version of that up in a moment.
[1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:55.440]  But let's put up some of her tweets for folks, some of the ones that aren't too pornographic.
[1:04:55.440 --> 1:04:58.440]  I mean, little girls do the splits.
[1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:04.440]  Half naked is just, I want to put myself in jail.
[1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:09.440]  Hashtag toddlers and tiaras.
[1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:18.440]  Remember, salon and vice and HBO with men watching half naked four-year-olds dance saying we're getting erections.
[1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:22.440]  This is them throwing in your face what they're into.
[1:05:22.440 --> 1:05:28.440]  I'm about to Anthony Weiner this kid talking about a child she wants to have sex with.
[1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:33.440]  I just saw a baby that looked like a porn star, like a trashy do anything porn star.
[1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:37.440]  Is this wrong to think?
[1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:43.440]  This is Hollywood folks.
[1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:48.440]  And then making fun of Christ being killed.
[1:05:48.440 --> 1:05:55.440]  She's just a standard, empty devil or spirit that only feels alive.
[1:05:55.440 --> 1:05:57.440]  She's doing something evil.
[1:05:57.440 --> 1:06:01.440]  She's lead at 60,000 tweets because she's worried for her family.
[1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:02.440]  That's right.
[1:06:02.440 --> 1:06:04.440]  Oh, people are being mean to her.
[1:06:04.440 --> 1:06:10.440]  I'm a million percent going to be a child from toddlers and tiaras for Halloween.
[1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:13.440]  Can we fast forward time please?
[1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:16.440]  I am beyond excited.
[1:06:16.440 --> 1:06:18.440]  And what does James Gunn do for Hollywood?
[1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:27.440]  He puts on child molestation parties where people dress up like children, women and then have sex with men.
[1:06:27.440 --> 1:06:38.440]  If you buy the Cowboys bag from Nike, it has the image of a child taped up inside.
[1:06:38.440 --> 1:06:44.440]  Writer-director James Gunn fired from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 over offensive tweets.
[1:06:44.440 --> 1:06:46.440]  It was, oh, it's just comedy.
[1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:52.440]  It wasn't really just comedy, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:54.440]  It's what they're into.
[1:06:54.440 --> 1:06:56.440]  It's what they do.
[1:06:56.440 --> 1:06:58.440]  It's the club.
[1:06:58.440 --> 1:07:00.440]  Here is Chrissy.
[1:07:00.440 --> 1:07:05.440]  We were just talking about talking about cannibalism because at the end of the day, that's all this is.
[1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:07.440]  And if you'll hurt children, you'll hurt anybody.
[1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:08.440]  That's what this cannibalism is.
[1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:09.440]  Here it is.
[1:07:09.440 --> 1:07:14.440]  If the person okayed it, I would eat a human.
[1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:19.440]  If you were at a very fancy restaurant and they were like a tiny piece of human meat.
[1:07:19.440 --> 1:07:20.440]  No, no, no.
[1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:21.440]  I think the only way-
[1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:22.440]  You didn't try a tiny bite?
[1:07:22.440 --> 1:07:23.440]  No.
[1:07:23.440 --> 1:07:24.440]  Really?
[1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:25.440]  Absolutely not.
[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:26.440]  Is that terrible?
[1:07:26.440 --> 1:07:30.440]  American job.
[1:07:30.440 --> 1:07:33.440]  Now, you know the old Jones, you said you eat your neighbors.
[1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:37.440]  I'm in a society collapsed, like Jonathan Swift, that that's where we're headed.
[1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:39.440]  I don't want that to happen.
[1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:41.440]  No, I wouldn't eat my neighbors.
[1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:42.440]  But look at this.
[1:07:42.440 --> 1:07:43.440]  This ties into her.
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:48.440]  It's all about abuse of children, medical experiments on children, medical experiments on young people.
[1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:50.440]  That's what the whole trans movement is.
[1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:58.440]  Lawsuit, teen boy forced to take estrogen shots after diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder.
[1:07:58.440 --> 1:08:02.440]  You know, you've heard they've said, oh, let's give estrogen to child molesters.
[1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:05.440]  Hoping that won't make them want to rape children, but it doesn't work.
[1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:11.440]  Now, if you're in juvenile hall and you don't behave yourself, you're not there for rape or any of that.
[1:08:11.440 --> 1:08:12.440]  You're just defiant.
[1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:17.440]  We're going to give you estrogen shots that they say will make you behave yourself.
[1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:19.440]  The story's on infowars.com.
[1:08:19.440 --> 1:08:21.440]  It's a Kit Daniels article that needs to go.
[1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:23.440]  Absolutely viral.
[1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:30.440]  Well, they just found another thing of her.
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:35.440]  Welcome to having sex with 13 year olds.
[1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:41.440]  Tony Podesta was in a full page articles praising child porn in 2007 in the Washington Post.
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:48.440]  They are externalizing their sickness.
[1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:50.440]  Wow.
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:52.440]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:54.440]  I'm not even going to read this on there.
[1:08:54.440 --> 1:09:00.440]  A lawsuit team boy forced to take estrogen shots and were diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder.
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:09.440]  16 year old boy was forced to take estrogen shots at a Los Angeles juvenile hall after he was diagnosed with operational oppositional defiant disorder.
[1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:14.440]  The teenager who didn't respect authority was given.
[1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:28.440]  A female hormone estrogen has treatment by a doctor resulting in him developing bitch tits, a condition that causes males to grow in large breasts due to higher than normal level of estrogen according to the suit.
[1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:36.440]  Plain of further alleges that the experimental treatment has been or is being given to male youths within the county of Los Angeles.
[1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:37.440]  Do you think so?
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:38.440]  Juvenile courts.
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:39.440]  What it is is sterilization.
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:43.440]  Did you get this long enough to sterilize?
[1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:51.440]  Juvenile courts, juvenile halls and juvenile detention facilities without first obtaining their voluntary and informed consent.
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:55.440]  Yeah, it's medical experiments that started 50 years ago in England with prisoners.
[1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:56.440]  Now it's children.
[1:09:56.440 --> 1:09:57.440]  Now it's retarded children.
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:09:59.440]  Now it's autistic children.
[1:09:59.440 --> 1:10:02.440]  Now it's prisoners.
[1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:04.440]  We had call today that had problems.
[1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:10.440]  We didn't make it on air.
[1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:13.440]  Yeah, adult swim makes fun of this.
[1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:14.440]  It's also sick kids in cages.
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:21.440]  What Albert Kinsey did, they're so proud of themselves.
[1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:24.440]  And they're externalizing their entire hierarchy does.
[1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:32.440]  It's all about killing children, all about locking them up in cages, all about raping them, all about fetishizing them because they need an army of people that have no soul.
[1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:38.440]  And they're all weird chicken neck, weak leftist.
[1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:40.440]  No one stops them.
[1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:41.440]  No one stands up to them.
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:45.440]  No one resists them.
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:47.440]  And so they believe they have total power.
[1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:48.440]  And I apologize.
[1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:52.440]  The first caller today, he said he was in a jail where they're already testing COVID on him.
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:53.440]  I know that goes on for a fact.
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:54.440]  And then he had an audio problem.
[1:10:54.440 --> 1:10:55.440]  So I hung up on him.
[1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:56.440]  I apologize.
[1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:57.440]  I didn't know that.
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:10:58.440]  I would have stayed with you.
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:10:59.440]  I'm just sick of calls calling in there.
[1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:02.440]  We'll show the radio and then they don't get on.
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:07.440]  But I mean, they're already covered up a bunch of bad effects of the vaccine.
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:11.440]  They already covered up some of the poster people that were out promoting and it's a great thing.
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:13.440]  They got really sick and then it got covered up.
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:18.440]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been exposing that this is crazy.
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:26.440]  The teenagers parents brought the lawsuit because they say they were never informed about the estrogen shots or his oppositional defiant disorder.
[1:11:26.440 --> 1:11:27.440]  Totally illegal folks.
[1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:29.440]  That's secret experimentation.
[1:11:29.440 --> 1:11:32.440]  I mean, they're chopping millions of little boys balls off.
[1:11:32.440 --> 1:11:33.440]  Of course they'll do this.
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:39.440]  I mean, there is no any kind of indication that provided estradiol to an adolescent male.
[1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:41.440]  It's any kind of acceptable treatment for anything.
[1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:52.440]  The boy's lawyer, West Ochi told witness LA, we think it's an experiment and we think it's likely to be only time they use the treatment experimentally.
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:57.440]  Oh, no, it's going on widespread like shooting blacks up with syphilis.
[1:11:57.440 --> 1:12:05.440]  Democratic Party to make his point, the lawyer said he was curious that the staff would have estradiol readily available for treatment.
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:11.440]  Another key point is the staff believe the teenager had slightly elevated testosterone levels according to the complaint.
[1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:16.440]  Oh, all the males need your estrogen.
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:20.440]  And what does fluoride do lower your testosterone as well?
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:22.440]  It's all about gelding you.
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:31.440]  It's a global scientific project to make it fancy and cool to roll out secret experimentation on children.
[1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:39.440]  All right, we've got loaded phone calls from Ruben, Russell, Walt, Kenny, Andre, Matthew, Craig, Charles, Shaggy, Matt, Alex.
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:42.440]  The longer you've been holding, the faster I go to you on the other side.
[1:12:42.440 --> 1:12:43.440]  We'll be back in just a few minutes.
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:49.440]  Please stay with us.
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:53.440]  I've been on air in 26 years, starting about 24 years ago.
[1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:58.440]  I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors, producers, actors.
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:01.440]  They wanted to meet with me and they said, what is your formal education?
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:04.440]  And I said, well, really, nothing but a few years of college.
[1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:10.440]  They said, well, how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:14.440]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable.
[1:13:14.440 --> 1:13:15.440]  We'd like you to be in movies.
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:16.440]  We'd like you to write with us.
[1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:18.440]  We'd like you to do voiceovers.
[1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:19.440]  You're just a Renaissance man.
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:23.440]  Folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer made statements like that and a lot of others.
[1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:24.440]  I'm not bragging.
[1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:25.440]  I kept explaining to them.
[1:13:25.440 --> 1:13:27.440]  I said, do you understand?
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:29.440]  I didn't come up with any of this.
[1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:34.440]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents.
[1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:36.440]  And they would just laugh at me and say, oh, no way.
[1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:38.440]  Then I would give them the documents.
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:43.440]  They would get very, very scared the next time I saw them in a few months and say, man, you're right.
[1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:44.440]  This is just topic.
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:46.440]  Folks, I didn't make any of this up.
[1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:48.440]  OK, it's real.
[1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:49.440]  It's real.
[1:13:49.440 --> 1:13:52.440]  The reasons that the globalist launched this planetary lockdown.
[1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:56.440]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[1:13:56.440 --> 1:14:01.440]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:07.440]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:14.440]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential
[1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:23.440]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:27.440]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:33.440]  It's been preplanned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:43.440]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers
[1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:45.440]  and consolidate power.
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:48.440]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:11.440]  Joe Collins is going to be in the studio with us next hour.
[1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:13.440]  He's running against Maxine Waters.
[1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:17.440]  That's some nice folks that have brought him here to be in the studio with us today.
[1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:18.440]  So, I look forward to that.
[1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:20.440]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:23.440]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:27.440]  Now, I'm going to go in the order that these calls have been received.
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:31.440]  So, up next would be...
[1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:33.440]  Let's go to Matthew in Michigan.
[1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:35.440]  Matthew, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:36.440]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing, sir?
[1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:38.440]  I'm good, brother.
[1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:46.440]  I am kind of concerned with everything going on because he just kind of mentioned earlier with Whitmer mandating the mask.
[1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:53.440]  I've gone into different stores and I've been had to turn away because I'm not going to wear a mask and I've been turned away because I haven't been wearing a mask.
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:58.440]  So, that's kind of concerning there how people turn into sheets and will do anything they can to feel safe.
[1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:02.440]  Just imagine what they'll do when vaccines and make them with the force in that case.
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:04.440]  Well, that's what this is all a test for.
[1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:05.440]  We're being inducted into the cult.
[1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:09.440]  We're not joining the Marine Corps or the Army and being put through boot camp to make sure we're part of the club.
[1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:11.440]  We're being put into a cult of communism.
[1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:13.440]  But the Georgia governor says it's illegal.
[1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:17.440]  The Fifth Circuit and other courts are saying it's illegal to make folks wear masks.
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:20.440]  If you have anxiety, you just say, I have a medical issue.
[1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:21.440]  They're not allowed to ask you.
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:25.440]  So, again, this is all an attempt to force you into this.
[1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:26.440]  Correct.
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:33.440]  And to get into the next point I wanted to bring up quick was what can we do as well as Trump?
[1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:39.440]  So, this biggest point I think is going to be on us as General Flynn called us the digital soldiers.
[1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:41.440]  We need to continue to fight.
[1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:45.440]  And I think right now there is a great awakening that has happened.
[1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:53.440]  And I know that was kind of the title for your show today about everything going on when it comes to like this Chrissy Teigen and the pedophilia being exposed.
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:17:05.440]  I've seen left-wing people on my friend start to turn into and notice the sex trafficking and the child trafficking as well as people left-wing that have turned against the government and Fauci and not wearing the mask.
[1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:09.440]  And notice it was all a big political thing because at first it was just a flat and a curve.
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:14.440]  Now, as I talked about one of your videos earlier, just keep tightening the news and tightening it tighter and tighter.
[1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:15.440]  Well, that's it, brother.
[1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:16.440]  Great points, Matthew.
[1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:17.440]  Thanks for the call.
[1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:18.440]  Okay.
[1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:19.440]  Who's up next here?
[1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:22.440]  Let's go to another caller in Ohio, Matt.
[1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:23.440]  You're on the air, Matt.
[1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:24.440]  Go ahead.
[1:17:24.440 --> 1:17:26.440]  Hey, how's it going, brother?
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:27.440]  Good.
[1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:28.440]  Thanks for calling.
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:29.440]  No problem.
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:33.440]  First, before I get to my point, I just want to tell you about the wine.
[1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:35.440]  Our governor is actually showing himself.
[1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:42.440]  Last night, he even had a press conference pretty much, you know, asking Ohioans to wear a mask.
[1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:45.440]  And then he was smirking the whole entire time during the thing.
[1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:48.440]  He can go back and even probably find the whole entire press conference.
[1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:52.440]  And I hope Trump does something about the wine because he's honestly out of control.
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:54.440]  He's on a power trip himself.
[1:17:54.440 --> 1:17:58.440]  And honestly, governors cannot, you know, make laws, you know?
[1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:00.440]  So, I mean, yeah, they'll mandate stuff.
[1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:02.440]  But like you said, it's against our freedom.
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:03.440]  It's totally illegal.
[1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:09.440]  And now we even have stores here in Ohio saying that you can't come into their property unless you wear a mask.
[1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:11.440]  Walmart came out and announced that.
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:13.440]  Kroger came out and announced that.
[1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:19.440]  All kinds of, all kinds of stores are coming out and announcing that you can't even go shop in southern stores unless you wear a mask.
[1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:25.440]  And my point is, I think this is leading to the mark of the beast system, you know, versus no mask, you know, no service.
[1:18:25.440 --> 1:18:28.440]  And then it's going to lead to the mark of the beast.
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:29.440]  Well, sir, you're right.
[1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:38.440]  Bill Gates admits it's for contact tracing force inoculation and preparing you to have apps on your phone to be able to buy and sell or get in your car and drive down the road.
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:41.440]  That's what they're getting us ready for.
[1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:44.440]  Yep. And this is the cash of society, like you said.
[1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:49.440]  And then another point I wanted to make, because I know you have college back, you know, back up, check out Justin Bieber.
[1:18:49.440 --> 1:18:51.440]  He had a video a while back called yummy.
[1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:57.440]  And he was exposed in the whole entire industry, the pedophile elite in that video.
[1:18:57.440 --> 1:18:59.440]  If you've never checked that out, go check that out too.
[1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:02.440]  I recommend that because I think I heard he was.
[1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:03.440]  I didn't watch it.
[1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:04.440]  What's he cover?
[1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:05.440]  What's he cover?
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:09.440]  He exposes how they're, you know, eating children pretty much in the video.
[1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:18.440]  If you go watch the video, he shows how they're, you know, taking advantage of children and even at the end of the video, it shows like a child dressed laid behind and stuff like that.
[1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:23.440]  And he also had a guy in there looking like Podesta is actually a very enlightening video.
[1:19:23.440 --> 1:19:30.440]  And he even actually touched his hat subliminally because a person asked him on Instagram is like, Hey, was this really what this was about?
[1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:34.440]  And he touched his back and let people know that, you know, that's what it was about.
[1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:36.440]  And one last thing I do have a channel myself on YouTube.
[1:19:36.440 --> 1:19:39.440]  I mean, they're trying to shadow ban me called truth seeker.
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:42.440]  And I have a video talking about the Christie Tegan stuff on there.
[1:19:42.440 --> 1:19:46.440]  If you don't want to try to find me and watch that, I'm dead, but they've been trying to shadow ban me.
[1:19:46.440 --> 1:19:49.440]  But, you know, it's just ridiculous how YouTube brother, you're fighting back.
[1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:50.440]  And that's what matters.
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:51.440]  Tell us your YouTube channel again.
[1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:52.440]  Yep.
[1:19:52.440 --> 1:19:54.440]  It's called truth seeker.
[1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:55.440]  It's all one word.
[1:19:55.440 --> 1:19:56.440]  Truth seeker.
[1:19:56.440 --> 1:19:58.440]  I can even probably even email it to you if you want to check it out.
[1:19:58.440 --> 1:19:59.440]  All right, brother.
[1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:00.440]  Thank you so much, Matt.
[1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:05.440]  Yeah, the system uses children and the abuse of children as a currency and for controlling for blackmail.
[1:20:05.440 --> 1:20:12.440]  And the whole thing's coming down so they can try to make us wear masks and they can try to start wars and they can try to implode the economy.
[1:20:12.440 --> 1:20:18.440]  But they are being exposed and they know it.
[1:20:18.440 --> 1:20:21.440]  All right, let's go to Walt in New York.
[1:20:21.440 --> 1:20:22.440]  Walt, you're on the air.
[1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:23.440]  Thanks for holding.
[1:20:23.440 --> 1:20:24.440]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[1:20:24.440 --> 1:20:25.440]  Good, brother.
[1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:27.440]  Alex, there's two points I want to make.
[1:20:27.440 --> 1:20:30.440]  The first point is that the time is very short to the election.
[1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:33.440]  Trump needs to leverage the electronic media.
[1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:37.440]  And to do that, he should borrow an idea from FDR, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
[1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:41.440]  He needs fireside chats on a dedicated web channel.
[1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:43.440]  He can set that up and come on a regular basis.
[1:20:43.440 --> 1:20:45.440]  He can talk directly to the people.
[1:20:45.440 --> 1:20:48.440]  He's very effective and he'll swing the election with that.
[1:20:48.440 --> 1:20:51.440]  I agree because they've shut down his rallies with the COVID hoax.
[1:20:51.440 --> 1:20:56.440]  He should just have virtual rallies and then and then say send out invites to see a hundred people.
[1:20:56.440 --> 1:20:59.440]  Maybe he takes questions from or something digitally.
[1:20:59.440 --> 1:21:00.440]  Wonderful idea.
[1:21:00.440 --> 1:21:08.440]  The second thing is, I think he should, on one of his channels, talk about Roger Stone and say he wants to extend a full pardon to Roger Stone.
[1:21:08.440 --> 1:21:14.440]  Then Roger Stone is a force to be reckoned with and he can dedicate his full time instead of raising money.
[1:21:14.440 --> 1:21:18.440]  He can dedicate his full time to to reelect the president and he's very effective.
[1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:20.440]  He's a very powerful person.
[1:21:20.440 --> 1:21:22.440]  I agree with you, brother.
[1:21:22.440 --> 1:21:26.440]  Do you agree with me that I think the globalists are losing right now, but not my much?
[1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:28.440]  And I think they're going to launch some new big scam.
[1:21:28.440 --> 1:21:30.440]  We've already seen so many hoaxes, so many frauds.
[1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:31.440]  Do you agree with me?
[1:21:31.440 --> 1:21:33.440]  And what do you think the next fraud might be?
[1:21:33.440 --> 1:21:36.440]  I don't know, but I'll say this, Alex.
[1:21:36.440 --> 1:21:38.440]  The electronic media is the way to go.
[1:21:38.440 --> 1:21:41.440]  You have to have the power of the electronic media.
[1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:43.440]  And Trump was kind of slow on that.
[1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:46.440]  He's older generation and he didn't pick up on that soon enough.
[1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:47.440]  And we have censorship.
[1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:54.440]  We have all this, but he could set up a dedicated channel and he could talk directly to the people and go around all these people.
[1:21:54.440 --> 1:21:57.440]  As long as the web is up, he can do that and he'll overcome anything.
[1:21:57.440 --> 1:21:58.440]  Exactly.
[1:21:58.440 --> 1:22:03.440]  And now he's gotten rid of Brad Parscale, who's not a bad guy, but just as naive.
[1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:05.440]  So I think Trump realizes he's in trouble.
[1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:10.440]  And that's good because they have external polls that are fake showing him losing about a huge margin.
[1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:14.440]  But his real polls show him slipping to a very thin margin of victory.
[1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:17.440]  And so if you add election fraud against that, they will win.
[1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:22.440]  So Trump, with 109 days out, you can see he's starting to make some major moves.
[1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:27.440]  Well, way back at the time of Franklin Roosevelt, all they had was radio and it was extremely powerful then.
[1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:28.440]  And he knew it.
[1:22:28.440 --> 1:22:29.440]  Can you imagine that?
[1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:32.440]  He needs to have a big topic every night on video.
[1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:33.440]  They'll all tune into it.
[1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:36.440]  He needs to have a new subject, a new thing he addresses every night.
[1:22:36.440 --> 1:22:37.440]  I totally agree with you.
[1:22:37.440 --> 1:22:38.440]  Thank you, sir.
[1:22:38.440 --> 1:22:39.440]  That's the answer.
[1:22:39.440 --> 1:22:40.440]  Thank you, Walt.
[1:22:40.440 --> 1:22:41.440]  All right.
[1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:47.440]  We got two more segments ahead of Matt Bracken taking over.
[1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:53.440]  And there's a doctor who's a state senator in Minnesota who's done a great job exposing COVID as an overblown hoax.
[1:22:53.440 --> 1:22:55.440]  They're trying to take his license right now.
[1:22:55.440 --> 1:22:58.440]  We're going to air a few segments of that at the start of the next hour.
[1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:01.440]  But I've got a bunch of other news I want to hit as well.
[1:23:01.440 --> 1:23:09.440]  Please don't forget we have Christmas in July sale, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points,
[1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:12.440]  and all these items that were sold out that are back in.
[1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:14.440]  We have those on sale as well.
[1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:20.440]  But I'll tell you, as soon as I'm able to sell the new products we've got, I've got to get one more certificate.
[1:23:20.440 --> 1:23:22.440]  And then we're going to sell them that this sale will be over.
[1:23:22.440 --> 1:23:23.440]  So it might be next Monday.
[1:23:23.440 --> 1:23:24.440]  It might be next Friday.
[1:23:24.440 --> 1:23:25.440]  It might be two days from now.
[1:23:25.440 --> 1:23:28.440]  As soon as the certificate comes in, I've got 10 new products.
[1:23:28.440 --> 1:23:32.440]  We're really excited about a year in development that we're about to put out.
[1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:33.440]  And so this sale will end.
[1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:34.440]  So take advantage of it.
[1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:38.440]  Get your brain force, your turbo force, your survival still next to all of it, 50% off,
[1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:41.440]  out of mineral fusion, bodies, all the tumor formulas, so much more.
[1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:43.440]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:44.440]  And these are products you should try.
[1:23:44.440 --> 1:23:45.440]  You really should try them.
[1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:46.440]  We'll be right back.
[1:23:46.440 --> 1:23:47.440]  Stay with us.
[1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:52.440]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com.
[1:23:52.440 --> 1:23:54.440]  You can wear them out to political events.
[1:23:54.440 --> 1:23:55.440]  You can trigger live darts.
[1:23:55.440 --> 1:24:01.440]  But one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party
[1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:02.440]  or at Halloween.
[1:24:02.440 --> 1:24:07.440]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect
[1:24:07.440 --> 1:24:09.440]  you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[1:24:09.440 --> 1:24:14.080]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations and contact
[1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:15.440]  tracing if they're openly announcing.
[1:24:15.440 --> 1:24:17.440]  It's an active submission.
[1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:21.440]  It's an active like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down.
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:25.440]  But a big reason to wear these is then in the stores, when people ask you why you're wearing
[1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:30.440]  a Halloween mask, say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:34.440]  And the M95 mask only control what's coming in, not what's going out.
[1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:36.440]  So they quote spread COVID-19.
[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:38.440]  They don't protect from it.
[1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:41.440]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these control free spaces.
[1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:42.440]  You buy one for 9.95.
[1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:43.440]  You get four more free.
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:47.440]  They're at cost infowarstore.com.
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:53.440]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist
[1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:57.440]  shiny style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:02.440]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[1:25:02.440 --> 1:25:09.440]  This planetary corporate reset the COVID covers for because the truth is powerful and will
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:11.440]  defeat them and will smash them.
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:18.440]  And the good news is there are still sites like band.videonewswars.com, infowars.com,
[1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:23.440]  Paul Watson site summit.news and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic
[1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:30.440]  thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master
[1:25:30.440 --> 1:25:32.440]  of our own destinies.
[1:25:32.440 --> 1:25:37.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health,
[1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:42.440]  a war on our economy, but being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against
[1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:44.440]  it will defeat it.
[1:25:44.440 --> 1:25:47.440]  So take action or be slaves.
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:57.440]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.

[1:26:50.440 --> 1:26:58.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:16.440]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:21.440]  Welcome back, I'm your host, Alex Jones, Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central.
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:22.440]  Here we are.
[1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:26.440]  We're taking a lot of phone calls and then next hour we have a guest at studio.
[1:27:26.440 --> 1:27:28.440]  Then Matt Bracken is coming up.
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:32.440]  We're continuing with your phone calls right now.
[1:27:32.440 --> 1:27:34.440]  Let's see who's been holding the longest here.
[1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:38.440]  And then I have one little piece of news that I want to hit on the vaccine front.
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:40.440]  Who's been holding the longest?
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:43.440]  Is it Kenny or is it Alex?
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:47.440]  I think it's one of those or is it Andre?
[1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:50.440]  We're going to Kenny in Ohio here in just a moment.
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:54.440]  But first, bad news for Moderna.
[1:27:54.440 --> 1:28:00.440]  That's one of the companies that Fauci and Gates are invested in and the NIH owns part of the vaccine.
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:02.440]  Not a conflict of interest or anything.
[1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:05.440]  Just let the weasel run the henhouse, that's all.
[1:28:05.440 --> 1:28:07.440]  Bad news for Moderna.
[1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:13.440]  For evidence shows COVID-19 antibodies disappear not long after the infection.
[1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:15.440]  The vaccine doesn't work.
[1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:17.440]  Big article on zero hedge.
[1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:21.440]  Meanwhile, this man behind the curtains got something for you.
[1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:24.440]  He does want to depopulate you, but you should trust him.
[1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:32.440]  Bill Gates says Indian pharma industry soon able to produce COVID-19 vaccine for entire world.
[1:28:32.440 --> 1:28:37.440]  Even though they've got all these ill effects and side effects and illnesses from the vaccine.
[1:28:37.440 --> 1:28:44.440]  They're reporting in the Associated Press that half the people in vaccine trials are getting very sick and having adverse reactions.
[1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:47.440]  See, the vaccine is the real COVID-19.
[1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:49.440]  It's the real bio attack.
[1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:53.440]  And they're getting you trained to wear the mask and don't leave your house.
[1:28:53.440 --> 1:28:55.440]  So you'll accept this in the future.
[1:28:55.440 --> 1:28:58.440]  This is it.
[1:28:58.440 --> 1:29:00.440]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls here.
[1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:03.440]  Let's talk to Kenny in Ohio.
[1:29:03.440 --> 1:29:05.440]  Kenny, you're on the air.
[1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:07.440]  How are you doing, Alex?
[1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:08.440]  Good, sir. Go ahead.
[1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:12.440]  I'm going to talk about the psychological issues that are going on right now.
[1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:17.440]  People are going to be forced back into their homes, back out away from society.
[1:29:17.440 --> 1:29:21.440]  And what it's going to cause for people that are on the cusp of mental breakdown.
[1:29:21.440 --> 1:29:23.440]  Taking everything away from us.
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:25.440]  It'll show us back in.
[1:29:25.440 --> 1:29:27.440]  It'll tell us what we have to do, what we can do.
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:30.440]  Well, that's right. It's causing depression. It's causing breakdown of society.
[1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:32.440]  It's causing people to go into debt.
[1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:35.440]  It's causing major homes to be repossessed.
[1:29:35.440 --> 1:29:42.440]  It is siege to make us blame America and blame Trump.
[1:29:42.440 --> 1:29:45.440]  Well, it's just all part of the psychological plan.
[1:29:45.440 --> 1:29:48.440]  I think you're muffling your phone. Take your hand off your phone.
[1:29:48.440 --> 1:29:54.440]  Okay. It's just like everything that's part of their psyche.
[1:29:54.440 --> 1:29:56.440]  It's going to destroy everything.
[1:29:56.440 --> 1:29:59.440]  That's what they're planning to do. If they can't physically do it,
[1:29:59.440 --> 1:30:03.440]  they're going to mentally break us down to where everybody's forced to live in their homes
[1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:05.440]  and not come back out and not be able to do worse.
[1:30:05.440 --> 1:30:08.440]  And that's right. But if you're aware of someone trying to oppress you
[1:30:08.440 --> 1:30:10.440]  and don't give up, it makes you stronger.
[1:30:10.440 --> 1:30:12.440]  If you have Stockholm syndrome and submit, they win.
[1:30:12.440 --> 1:30:15.440]  But if you're aware they're trying to break your will and decide to be happy
[1:30:15.440 --> 1:30:19.440]  and more successful and expose them, they get defeated.
[1:30:19.440 --> 1:30:21.440]  You see their gamble.
[1:30:21.440 --> 1:30:23.440]  Yeah, it's basically what they want.
[1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:27.440]  They want us all to be robots. And that's not going to happen.
[1:30:27.440 --> 1:30:30.440]  I mean, it's already starting with the Walmarts and Spies.
[1:30:30.440 --> 1:30:33.440]  Now you can't even, they can't have cash.
[1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:36.440]  Oh yeah, it's all the big corporations are the ones that are doing this.
[1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:38.440]  They're the ones behind it.
[1:30:38.440 --> 1:30:40.440]  So why support them? Why go to them?
[1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:42.440]  Because they're out to get you. You can't shop with them.
[1:30:42.440 --> 1:30:45.440]  You have to let them know.
[1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:47.440]  Sometimes it's the only place you can go for those.
[1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:51.440]  I live 15 miles away from a Wal-Mart in each section.
[1:30:51.440 --> 1:30:53.440]  Sir, I understand that.
[1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:55.440]  That's why you're going to have to drive further and pay more.
[1:30:55.440 --> 1:30:57.440]  Because in the end, they're going to tell you to take a brain shift
[1:30:57.440 --> 1:30:59.440]  or the market of the beast to go there.
[1:30:59.440 --> 1:31:01.440]  I mean, that's been their plan.
[1:31:01.440 --> 1:31:03.440]  I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to apply.
[1:31:03.440 --> 1:31:06.440]  I understand. But now's the time to say no.
[1:31:06.440 --> 1:31:10.440]  God bless you Kenny. I appreciate your call. Good points.
[1:31:10.440 --> 1:31:14.440]  Let's talk to Alex in Michigan where the governor is completely out of control.
[1:31:14.440 --> 1:31:16.440]  Alex, you're on the air.
[1:31:16.440 --> 1:31:18.440]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[1:31:18.440 --> 1:31:19.440]  Thank you.
[1:31:19.440 --> 1:31:24.440]  I addressed your last caller's question about what products also decalcify the pineal gland,
[1:31:24.440 --> 1:31:27.440]  the bodies product from infowarestore.com.
[1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:31.440]  We'll take fluoride out of your system if your crew wants to just do a quick search
[1:31:31.440 --> 1:31:35.440]  of fluoride removal using turmeric, get all kinds of articles.
[1:31:35.440 --> 1:31:39.440]  I'm not bragging, but if you listen to this phone call,
[1:31:39.440 --> 1:31:41.440]  we can save America right now.
[1:31:41.440 --> 1:31:43.440]  If you don't cut me short, I've got some points to make.
[1:31:43.440 --> 1:31:45.440]  I have the blueprint right here.
[1:31:45.440 --> 1:31:48.440]  The Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ is going to lead me through this.
[1:31:48.440 --> 1:31:52.440]  And we're going to defeat the Night of Malta Global's eugenics umbrella corp
[1:31:52.440 --> 1:31:55.440]  with the raw child's gates and sources are all Knights of Malta.
[1:31:55.440 --> 1:32:00.440]  And above them, you have the Jesuit Black nobility and the Black Pope.
[1:32:00.440 --> 1:32:09.440]  And above that, you have these Merovingian bloodlines that are the Nephilim Fallen Angel type evil dudes running things right now.
[1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:13.440]  But to save America, Trump needs to fire Jesuit Fauci,
[1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:18.440]  put Mike Adams as the natural national health director.
[1:32:18.440 --> 1:32:22.440]  And then if we can't save America, we have to move to Greenland.
[1:32:22.440 --> 1:32:26.440]  We have to move to Greenland and we have to start hemp farms.
[1:32:26.440 --> 1:32:32.440]  Any kind of farms get some product, you know, get our GDP going.
[1:32:32.440 --> 1:32:35.440]  And we'll take this remnant of America that still loves America.
[1:32:35.440 --> 1:32:38.440]  We'll just take our ideas to Greenland.
[1:32:38.440 --> 1:32:44.440]  And the rest of you scum that don't want to live in a good America anymore, you can just have it.
[1:32:44.440 --> 1:32:46.440]  All right, Alex, I appreciate your call. Good to hear from you.
[1:32:46.440 --> 1:32:48.440]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[1:32:48.440 --> 1:32:50.440]  Taking a lot of calls today.
[1:32:50.440 --> 1:32:52.440]  Doing a good job. You guys are doing a great job.
[1:32:52.440 --> 1:32:55.440]  Andre in New York, thanks for holding. You're on the air.
[1:32:55.440 --> 1:32:57.440]  Hi, Alex.
[1:32:57.440 --> 1:33:05.440]  So yesterday, Cuomo late last night, Cuomo decided to put police in all of the airports.
[1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:08.440]  Oh, yeah, even the courts say it's unconstitutional.
[1:33:08.440 --> 1:33:11.440]  The medical checkpoints he's setting up, he's doing it.
[1:33:11.440 --> 1:33:18.440]  Right, but he has the good news. The good news is that he admitted that the contact tracing isn't working.
[1:33:18.440 --> 1:33:21.440]  That people are not giving him the information.
[1:33:21.440 --> 1:33:24.440]  So this is why he's doing that. He said that.
[1:33:24.440 --> 1:33:34.440]  And another thing is I'm telling you right now, New York is going red because there is a lot of people that are the silent majority.
[1:33:34.440 --> 1:33:40.440]  I feel that way is going in California and the more that they do this, the more it's going to get worse.
[1:33:40.440 --> 1:33:46.440]  By the way, let me raise that because I think even a few weeks ago, Trump was in trouble, but I can see it. I can feel it.
[1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:48.440]  I think the public's really waking up.
[1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:54.440]  Police all over the country are refusing to wear masks in big cities like LA, New York, Austin.
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:33:59.440]  The people are seeing through it. I think they've really pushed too far. What do you think?
[1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:08.440]  Well, what I think is, is like I said, a silent majority because he came out and said he knows there's a lot more people voting for him,
[1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:10.440]  but they don't want to deal with the people that hate him.
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:19.440]  Number one, number two, I am such a big advocate of his because I'm around your age, so I've been watching Trump, you know, from way back.
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:28.440]  He's been saying the same thing over and over. Everything he has been saying has been legit with China, with this, with that.
[1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:38.440]  And one important thing, this man was able to build in Manhattan with the OK from the mafia, OK?
[1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:47.440]  Five families. If he can't take down the globalists and the deep state and he could deal with the five families in New York,
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:53.440]  if you are not from New York, you don't understand it. If you're from New York, you totally get it.
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:59.440]  He will defeat them. And I really feel confident about that. So I just wanted to let you know.
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:06.440]  What you're saying is absolutely true. And like Trump's totally for real, he's surrounded, but he has right on his side.
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:14.440]  And that's why the enemy is so desperate, though, because every time they run a new hoax, it ends up failing so they expand the hoax.
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:18.440]  I'm just concerned. I'm asking listeners, what do you think the next big thing is going to be?
[1:35:18.440 --> 1:35:23.440]  Because, you know, the 109 days out, I mean, they're going to pull something else. What do you think, Andre?
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:31.440]  Well, what I think is they're just going to expand on this COVID because, like, I had a girlfriend.
[1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:39.440]  She just left New York on Saturday to move down to Florida and she said there was a checkpoint in Atlanta.
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:44.440]  There was no cops in Atlanta. So she went right through. So that's another lie that they're saying.
[1:35:44.440 --> 1:35:48.440]  They're not being able to get it. I don't know what the next big thing is.
[1:35:48.440 --> 1:35:58.440]  But I do know that without the police on the streets and the big police organizations just endorsed him yesterday, the bikers from Trump.
[1:35:58.440 --> 1:36:04.440]  Oh, yeah, I want to tell listeners, it's not hype. The crime is exploded. Where I live, just crime is rampant now.
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:11.440]  Well, it's rampant, but I'll tell you what, it's rampant in the poor state like this lovely, wonderful DSAOC.
[1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:17.440]  And Tucker Carlson is right on. No, you're right. It's all the blue cities and blue states are hellholes.
[1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:23.440]  Right. But just in the city, outside of the city in the suburbs, they're fine. I'm sure you live in a suburb.
[1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:30.440]  No, you're absolutely right. Thank you, Andre. Great points. It's just, imagine folks, they literally are saying turn the police off.
[1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:39.440]  This is villainous insanity. This is absolutely crazy. I mean, it's just, it's designed to create martial law.
[1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:43.440]  We're taking a lot of calls. We'll be right back with more of your calls on the other side.
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:50.440]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:51.440]  Hello, can you hear me?
[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:52.440]  I sure can, sir. Thank you.
[1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:59.440]  Hey, Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:00.440]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[1:37:00.440 --> 1:37:09.440]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:15.440]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us. We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:24.440]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rola, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:32.440]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is, so this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[1:37:32.440 --> 1:37:37.440]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[1:37:37.440 --> 1:37:44.440]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me. Thank you.
[1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:46.440]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[1:37:46.440 --> 1:38:02.440]  CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out and said that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings, standing on top of an American flag, is Nazi.
[1:38:02.440 --> 1:38:10.440]  And they had the Soros-funded Snopes groups and others fact-checking to say, yes, now the American flag, and yes, the American eagle are Nazis.
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:17.440]  No, George Soros, the funds, the Snopes, the media matters, and the rest of them, he's the real Nazi collaborator.
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:20.440]  But this shirt, I think, is really the perfect campaign shirts.
[1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:24.440]  We make one even better than what Trump's people came up with. Two different versions of it.
[1:38:24.440 --> 1:38:32.440]  With something even worse, the Betsy Ross flag, our first flag, that they also say is racist, even though she was a famous abolitionist.
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:37.440]  So these shirts are at infowars.com. They're the American eagle, Betsy Ross flags.
[1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:42.440]  Two different designs, guaranteed to spread the word, and, of course, trigger lip tarts everywhere.
[1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:47.440]  Exercise your first amendment or lose it, infowars.com.
[1:38:47.440 --> 1:38:50.440]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[1:38:50.440 --> 1:39:01.440]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society,
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:08.440]  how they'd be able to not just predict large groups of human movements and activities, but even predict what individuals would do.
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:16.440]  And then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing, you could add stimuli through the AI systems, through the computers,
[1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:23.440]  through digital billboards, through face scanning, through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you want it to.
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:27.440]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say, we were making it up.
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:32.440]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[1:39:32.440 --> 1:39:40.440]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:46.440]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned, so we might want to dismantle the system now.
[1:39:46.440 --> 1:39:48.440]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:50.440]  Where did it come from?
[1:39:50.440 --> 1:39:54.440]  Where did it come from?
[1:39:54.440 --> 1:39:56.440]  In four store dot com.

[1:40:46.400 --> 1:41:03.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:13.840]  Well, we've got a candidate who's got some good backers. He's a good guy joining us in
[1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:18.080]  studio running against Maxime Waters. I'll continue with your phone calls right through.
[1:41:19.840 --> 1:41:23.840]  And then we've got, of course, Matt Bracken, who's got a lot to say, always informative,
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:27.840]  author, former Navy SEAL Patriot, really a smart guy. He'll talk about what the
[1:41:27.840 --> 1:41:31.440]  Globals are planning next. That's what I've asked you to cover. That's coming up fourth hour ahead
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:36.880]  of the war with Owen Shroyer. All right, let's take five phone calls in the next 10 and a half
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:45.680]  minutes we have in this segment. Who's been home the longest here? That would be Shaggy in Texas
[1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:50.800]  and Charles and George is Shaggy. Go ahead. How's it going, Alex? I want to make this quick
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:56.160]  and methodical. First of all, X2 will blow you away to include all Infowars products. And I
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:02.720]  ain't no joke. Go ahead and grab them. I want to urge President Trump to make an executive order
[1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:08.640]  for forbidding contact tracing and then to all these germaphobic, anti-human COVID measures.
[1:42:09.200 --> 1:42:14.000]  And another point, everyone needs to get back to the actual town square and begin the undoing of
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:19.760]  the global agenda, putting a muzzle on we the people. Apply the pressure to all the pedophile
[1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:25.440]  networks to include Amazon, Wayfair, and every other petal network and deal with them with extreme
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:31.680]  prejudice. Expose and destroy the anti-human agendas behind every giga-net. The silent majority
[1:42:31.680 --> 1:42:37.520]  is a hardworking people that make this country so dogongry. God bless the USA and church. Start
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:42.960]  standing on the unshaken foundation the Lord has already established for you. When you email the
[1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:49.600]  White House, email the White House by WhiteHouse.gov. All right. Go to the contact portion.
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:55.440]  Email the president. Blow him up. Seriously. Every single American... No, I agree with you,
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:00.960]  Shaggy, but whoa. What do you make about Teagan? All these things openly saying she likes pedophilia.
[1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:07.200]  I mean, these people are, like, out in the open. Yeah, no, this lady, this freaking demon,
[1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:15.520]  she needs to be checked by the FBI time yesterday, time years... Oh, absolutely. You know,
[1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:21.520]  you know what's on our computers. Exactly, exactly. And that's, I mean, unless you bleach them,
[1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:27.280]  other than that, you can go ahead and sit through all that, all that demonic filth that these...
[1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:31.120]  And you're right. She's not a woman. She's an entity that's been taken over.
[1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:36.080]  Yeah, no, that's disgusting. They're completely into the satanic ritualism with spirit cooking
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:40.320]  and all that. So, yeah, no, these people are demons, and that's for sure.
[1:43:40.320 --> 1:43:43.200]  Powerful points, Shaggy. We're going to jump the next person so we can get to everybody.
[1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:44.720]  Here she is talking about eating people.
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:52.640]  The person okayed it, I would eat a human. If you're at a very fancy restaurant and they were,
[1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:57.920]  like, a tiny piece of human meat. No, no, no. I think the only way... You didn't try a tiny bite?
[1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:04.560]  No. Really? Absolutely not. Is that terrible? American child.
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:09.360]  When I was having a dental implant put in, they wanted to put a piece of cadaver in my mouth
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:15.040]  for the post for the, you know, new tooth, and the other tooth got to get pulled. I said,
[1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:20.080]  no, get me bovine. I've eaten enough beef anyways. And they said, yeah, it works just as good. I
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:23.600]  just don't want something else inside me. But the media spends that I want to eat people. I said,
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:28.000]  this is Jonathan's with for the lawyers. I want to eat people. I'm saying society collapses.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.800]  You guys are causing this. I'll eat my neighbors. I'll eat my liberal neighbors.
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:35.440]  That's really a threat to say. You idiots get what you're doing.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:42.160]  I'll cover that actually at the start of the next hour. Then I've got this medical doctor who's a
[1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:47.280]  state senator trying to fire because he exposed COVID as a fraud. I mean, since when can you not
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:51.520]  tell the truth? Well, since the left had cancer culture, the answer is don't give into that.
[1:44:51.520 --> 1:44:56.240]  Say no to it. We've done it. We built our own network, our own platform, our own system. That's
[1:44:56.240 --> 1:45:02.320]  why every AM and FM station deserves your support. That's why info wars is here is because of the
[1:45:02.320 --> 1:45:06.640]  affiliates and the enemy knows that they've targeted them. They've harassed them. But that
[1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:10.720]  actually made most of the affiliates take us from nighttime to live when you call up and
[1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:14.000]  threaten the owners or program directors and tell them you're going to kill them. They don't take
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:18.560]  us off. Talk radio is a little bit different. So almost don't want to tell the deep state how
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:24.640]  they screwed up, but it doesn't work calling up threatening radio station owners that they're used
[1:45:24.640 --> 1:45:29.440]  to it. So that really backfired for you. You got a lot of more affiliates and better air times
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:34.000]  because of your death threats. And I don't wish that on the stations, but know this. We don't
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:39.600]  know any stations bowed to this crap. When Soros and Media Matters put a list up now and tried to
[1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:45.360]  harass them, it had the opposite effect dirt bags because not all Americans get on their knees in
[1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:50.400]  the face of threats. A lot of people dig their heels in and get pissed. And that's the spirit we need
[1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:56.720]  like this bean company. The president did do a great job. There's like five times the amount of
[1:45:56.720 --> 1:46:02.240]  food being donated ever has been the poor getting all the food they need. The globalists want them
[1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:07.040]  rioting out there and then they try to turn that into a bad thing that the bean company gave more
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:12.320]  beans than anybody else. It's like, it's sick. All right. I said, I go to five calls in a segment.
[1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:18.000]  I'll never do that now, but who's up next now here? Charles in Georgia. You're on the air, sir. Go ahead.
[1:46:19.440 --> 1:46:24.720]  Hey, Alex, talking about Trump making some big moves. I like that. There's, there's a huge one
[1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:29.760]  running in the background that nobody's really thinking about. And it's so huge that Trump has
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:33.520]  to do it. Not only because it's the right thing to do, but it'll negate everything they're trying
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:39.840]  to do. He should move to parlor right now. No, no, no, no. People aren't thinking about the fact
[1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:44.320]  that they shut down the economy so people can't go back to work, can't work. But while that's
[1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:48.640]  going on, everybody's credit reports are getting trashed in the background. Trump needs to come
[1:46:48.640 --> 1:46:53.200]  out and order the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the FTC to order the credit bureaus to
[1:46:53.200 --> 1:46:58.720]  give the entire country a credit reset. That is genius. A jubilee. Trump should call for a credit
[1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:03.680]  report jubilee. Everyone will back him. It's the right thing to do. The big banks position this
[1:47:03.680 --> 1:47:09.680]  to make us debt slaves. Trump must announce a credit jubilee. That is freaking genius.
[1:47:10.560 --> 1:47:14.560]  Absolutely. It undoes everything because they're trying to make everybody surf. They get caught
[1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:18.400]  in what's called the downward spiraling loop where your credit's trashed and you can't buy
[1:47:18.400 --> 1:47:22.640]  things like furniture and durable goods and freezers and refrigerators or any of that stuff.
[1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:26.560]  If your credit's bad, you got to have good credit and most people don't have cash on hand for
[1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:30.560]  stuff like that. So all those industries, the housing industry, they're all screwed if everybody's
[1:47:30.560 --> 1:47:35.760]  got a 520 credit score. So all these restaurant workers and everybody else restore their trade
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:39.360]  line. By the way, none of them are getting bailouts. That's what's so evil about this. And remember,
[1:47:39.360 --> 1:47:44.240]  the Democrats did this, folks, not Trump. Right. Restore their credit back to whatever their
[1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:49.600]  score was on like January 31st. No late, no consumer late. No, I agree. Don't give them a
[1:47:49.600 --> 1:47:55.200]  perfect score. That'd be fraud. Restore it to what it was January 31st. You are damn right, sir.
[1:47:55.200 --> 1:48:00.640]  It undoes everything. We got to get an article out. We got to take a clip of this. We've got to
[1:48:00.640 --> 1:48:04.160]  get this to Trump. I'm going to talk to Roger Stone. I'm going to, I'm going to hold a Trump.
[1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:09.120]  This is absolutely genius because people just don't need a moratorium on bills, which didn't
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:13.760]  happen for most people. They need it to go back to where it was because they didn't do this.
[1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:18.480]  Yeah, they did it to everybody in the housing mess. Oh, it's like the Democrats rubbed their
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:22.800]  eyeballs in payday loans. They're all just, and again, every time I look at Democrats,
[1:48:22.800 --> 1:48:26.000]  you don't have Republicans doing that. And I'm not even trying to lionize Republicans,
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:31.200]  but compared to Democrats, Republicans are like moron, goody, two shoes, man. And the Democrats
[1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:36.960]  are a criminal, larcenist group of trash. Yeah, all these restaurant workers and everybody
[1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:40.480]  that are having their credit. Oh, everyone I go, people like, oh, we're glad to be reopened.
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:44.160]  We're glad you're here. And I go, did you get a bailout? Every waiter, every waitress, every
[1:48:44.160 --> 1:48:49.280]  marketer said no. They said, I've, I've, I'm mortgaging my house. I'm losing my house. It pisses
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:55.600]  me off. Yeah, put their credit back, no late, restore their oldest trade lines. And then
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:00.320]  they can put pressure on all these companies. Oh, it's for COVID. You big loan sharking banks.
[1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:05.920]  Do the, oh, sir, Trump better do this. He better put pressure on to do it. Beautiful, sir. Any
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:10.960]  other genius ideas, Charles? Well, Biden and his credit card company people, you know, he's
[1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:14.880]  Mr. Credit Card Company, they're all foaming at the mouth that everybody's going to be stuck
[1:49:14.880 --> 1:49:18.320]  and surf them. Trump needs to make a big deal out of this. Come out and say, hey, regular
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:22.640]  loan. No, you're right. This will win the election. He makes it all about Mr. Credit Card Company,
[1:49:22.640 --> 1:49:28.560]  Biden, Mr. Loan Shark, Mr. Payday Loan, Mr. Screw Your Credit. And he says, Hey,
[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:32.720]  reparations for black people. How about reparations for everybody got screwed by this,
[1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:37.760]  that your credit goes back to where it was in January of this year. That is genius,
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:44.400]  genius, genius, genius, genius. Watch how fast the COVID thing disappears after everybody's
[1:49:44.400 --> 1:49:50.560]  credit gets restored to because they won't have everybody sitting at home in a, in a, it's over.
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:55.280]  They love it. COVID gives them a casual society. Everybody's in debt. The United Nations runs it.
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:50:00.240]  It teaches us to stay in our houses. It's peer pressure. It's cult control. It just on every
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:03.920]  front. It's a new world to take over. God bless you, Charles. All right, listen, we got a guest in
[1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:09.200]  studio for at least three, four segments. And then if everybody's still there, I did a pretty good
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:16.000]  job. We got like 20 phone lines. So we've got Rubens up next, then Russell. And then it goes
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:21.680]  right through all the other callers. Christine and Anonymous and Shoal and Shrimp Dog. Gotta go
[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:28.160]  to Shrimp Dog. So we'll get to everybody when we start the next hour. Briefly, we have a new campaign
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:31.520]  shirt. I've been looking for the right shirt for 2020. And when I saw the Democrats and USA Today
[1:50:31.520 --> 1:50:36.000]  said that the American Eagles, Nazi, because it was standing on top of a globe that was the
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:40.800]  American flag, that's the Marine Corps symbol. It's everything else. Newsflags, the Nazis copied
[1:50:40.800 --> 1:50:48.800]  us and we copied the Romans. So but the point is, oh, look, that flag, it's Nazi. No, no, no, it's
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:54.640]  not. The Mexican flag isn't Nazi either. And the Iraqi flag's an eagle too. It's not. The Russian
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:58.960]  flag's a double headed eagle. It's not Nazi. Okay. But they want to say every symbol the left
[1:50:58.960 --> 1:51:04.320]  owns. Now you don't own this Betsy Ross flag abolitionist flag on the breastplate or the
[1:51:04.320 --> 1:51:09.680]  eagle sits on top of it. 20 stars around it. Infowars.com on the back. Keep America great.
[1:51:10.240 --> 1:51:15.360]  With the Betsy Ross flag on the right hand shoulder, it is a gorgeous shirt. Two different designs.

[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:40.880]  out as well. Stay with us. Americans have had freedom for so long. And most Americans were
[1:51:40.880 --> 1:51:46.480]  born into such docile times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:51.920]  tyranny. We don't appreciate the American way. Truth, justice, due process, the right to self
[1:51:51.920 --> 1:51:56.080]  defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of
[1:51:56.080 --> 1:52:01.840]  the world is. Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try
[1:52:01.840 --> 1:52:06.560]  to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:12.320]  strong is something the West invented. And that's what made our modern world. That's now been hijacked
[1:52:12.320 --> 1:52:16.800]  by the technocrats, by the globalists, who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we
[1:52:16.800 --> 1:52:22.880]  need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate,
[1:52:22.880 --> 1:52:28.320]  and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive. And that's what COVID-19 is. A global
[1:52:28.320 --> 1:52:34.320]  UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:36.080]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:43.600]  It's Christmas in July. We ran the sale last year. It was very, very popular. And so I am now
[1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:48.960]  announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year. And we
[1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:55.040]  have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020. It's the American
[1:52:55.040 --> 1:53:00.720]  Eagle boldly spreading its wings sitting at the top of Betsy Ross's line. And the shirts are on
[1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:07.040]  sale right now in FullerStore.com. I got the idea for the Trump campaign, having a similar shirt
[1:53:07.040 --> 1:53:11.360]  to media called Nancy, which of course it isn't. And since it's so triggering to the leftist,
[1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:14.480]  the globalist, well, we're going to make sure there's even more of these on the streets
[1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:19.200]  to spread the word and exercise our First Amendment in the face of these tyrants.
[1:53:19.200 --> 1:53:24.320]  We also have store-wide free shipping, double patriotic points. So whatever great item it is
[1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:29.120]  that you want, store-wide free shipping, double patriotic points on your next order, and at least
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:33.440]  50% off across the board. Now I'm going to have to get this sale very, very soon because all
[1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:36.720]  these products are about to sell out. Let's take advantage of it right now at FullerStore.com.
[1:53:40.160 --> 1:53:42.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:42.800 --> 1:53:57.360]  I had to come on tonight because I want to right now lay out for the
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:54:04.480]  infall warriors and the American people what will be the next phase of this outrageous attempt
[1:54:04.480 --> 1:54:11.120]  to destroy this country. The Washington Post has latched on to a left-wing conspiracy theory
[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:17.280]  that has been promulgated by Howard Feynman of MSNBC. It goes like this,
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:25.840]  Roger Stone was aware of misconduct or inappropriate activity by the President of the United States
[1:54:25.840 --> 1:54:32.560]  and he traded his silence in return for a commutation from the President of the United States.
[1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:39.920]  This is absolutely, totally, categorically false. There is no evidence of this.
[1:54:39.920 --> 1:54:46.800]  What it is is a bastardization of what I have said, which is Mueller's dirty cops pressured me
[1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:54.240]  extraordinarily hard to turn on the President. That means to offer false testimony, to offer
[1:54:55.040 --> 1:55:00.880]  composed testimony, to say things that were not true about the President. In other words,
[1:55:00.880 --> 1:55:06.800]  to lie. If I had been willing to lie, they dangled some unspecified leniency.
[1:55:06.800 --> 1:55:13.040]  But at no time did I ever say to anyone that I was aware of wrongdoing by the
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:20.160]  President that I would remain silent about in return for some unspecified leniency.
[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:27.200]  This is the next phase of the disinformation campaign by the deep state. We already saw
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:34.320]  phase one and that was, oh, Stone was in communication with a Russian intelligence officer.
[1:55:34.320 --> 1:55:41.040]  Well, we've been through this one before. I had a totally benign communication with the persona
[1:55:41.040 --> 1:55:49.200]  of Guccifer 2.0 on Twitter direct messages in late October. This conversation was, I should say,
[1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:55.520]  exchange, was completely disclosed by me to the American public in 2017. It was completely
[1:55:55.520 --> 1:56:01.680]  disclosed to the staff of the House Intelligence Committee based on the timing. Long after WikiLeaks
[1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:08.480]  had already released all of their documents and the content, it is meaningless. It is proof of
[1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:16.160]  nothing. And the contention that Guccifer 2.0, whoever that may be, is a Russian intelligence
[1:56:16.160 --> 1:56:22.640]  asset. That is the opinion of John Brennan. That is the opinion of Robert Mumbles Muller.
[1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:28.000]  But it has never been proven in a US court of law. It's right up there with Sudan,
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:35.120]  Hussein having weapons of mass destruction. It is right up there with them saying that
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:42.960]  Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy and he acted alone is yet another piece of deep state disinformation.
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:48.720]  So you heard it for here first, right here on the war room. We need to repeat this tomorrow
[1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:54.880]  on the Alex Jones show because every patriot the country needs to know. This is the next phase
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:58.320]  of the disinformation campaign by the deep state.
[1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:31.360]  The enunciation of truth. The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country,
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:35.040]  isn't there? You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You told me every television in
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:40.400]  London. Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you have the freedom
[1:57:40.400 --> 1:57:46.160]  to object to something and speak as you saw fit, you now have sensors and systems of surveillance
[1:57:46.160 --> 1:57:52.480]  coercing your conformity and sub-cameras. We need cameras. How did this happen? Who's to blame?
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:58.320]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others. They will be held accountable.
[1:57:58.320 --> 1:58:03.920]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[1:58:04.960 --> 1:58:12.720]  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were
[1:58:12.720 --> 1:58:18.320]  a myriad of problems which inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[1:58:18.320 --> 1:58:24.640]  Fear got the best of you. And in your panic, you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[1:58:25.200 --> 1:58:30.160]  He promised you order. He promised you peace. And all he demanded in return was your silent,
[1:58:30.160 --> 1:58:44.080]  obedient consent. There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity.
[1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:49.120]  The time to choose sides has come. The globalist launch this planetary lockdown.
[1:58:49.680 --> 1:58:56.240]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes. We've gone over those purposes
[1:58:56.240 --> 1:59:01.760]  many times here on air. The casual society, the surveillance system, global government,
[1:59:01.760 --> 1:59:08.080]  medical tyranny, forced inoculation. But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are
[1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:16.400]  obsolete, that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take
[1:59:16.400 --> 1:59:23.360]  over the jobs that people once had by design. This isn't like it's some advancement that we
[1:59:23.360 --> 1:59:30.240]  just fell into. It's been preplanned, organized globally. And it's extremely predatory. And
[1:59:30.240 --> 1:59:37.040]  through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all
[1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:43.760]  are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power. This is the truest form of
[1:59:43.760 --> 2:00:13.200]  technocracy fascism. Welcome back folks to the third hour. I'm Alex Jones, your host, Joe Collins
[2:00:13.200 --> 2:00:19.280]  is running against Maxine Waters right there in California. We're going to talk about why we need
[2:00:19.280 --> 2:00:23.280]  to fund the police. Maxine Waters and liberal policies is destroying California. What's going
[2:00:23.280 --> 2:00:27.600]  to happen to California? Law enforcement policies are harming the black community. Kansas Owens
[2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:32.800]  has a great platform but fails to hold liberal cities responsible for crime. Joe is from LA
[2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:38.320]  and knows the hood and what it needs to improve and feels many conservatives don't see this.
[2:00:38.320 --> 2:00:44.480]  And so joining us here is Joe Collins to break all of this down. Good to have you here. Yeah,
[2:00:44.480 --> 2:00:49.200]  I appreciate it. Thank you, Alex. Well, I mean, tear into it. What is going to happen to California
[2:00:49.200 --> 2:00:55.200]  because I know for a fact that not just Elon Musk has secretly moved here and bought a bunch of land
[2:00:55.200 --> 2:01:00.080]  that's not secret out by the airport to move Tesla. He's doing it. About a year from now,
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:05.040]  Tesla will be here. All the Hollywood people that are secretly conservatives or libertarians
[2:01:05.040 --> 2:01:09.920]  have had to play the game. They're all moving here. Chest pieces are moving in their words.
[2:01:10.640 --> 2:01:17.200]  There's a huge exodus. I'm talking thousands of directors, producers, major household names.
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:21.360]  They're all leaving. What's happening? Well, I'll tell you this, man. Taxes is happening. Gavin
[2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:25.520]  Newsom is a terrible governor. We have terrible representation. And I think the biggest reason
[2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:30.160]  why is, you know, not to bash on Democrats. Okay, I'm a liar. I'm a bachelor in Democrats, but
[2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:34.400]  we have an entire Democratic conglomerate in California that is terrible at making policies.
[2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:39.920]  I mean, you look at taxes, we have gas tax, air tax, split road tax, payroll tax, you know,
[2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:43.920]  business tax. We have all kinds of taxes that are forcing people to move out of California.
[2:01:43.920 --> 2:01:49.360]  You have a business, you know, just that the homeless population is out of control right now.
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:54.080]  And I don't think we have any competent legislators to do anything about these issues.
[2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:59.520]  And again, I don't see Texas as in competition with California. I don't see the nation working
[2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:05.360]  that way. I'm depressed that a state that was redder than Texas 30, 40 years ago is now like this.
[2:02:05.360 --> 2:02:10.240]  California is a beautiful state. It's amazing. I mean, if California wasn't communist, I'd probably
[2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:14.000]  live there. Nothing against Texas. It's got better weather. What happened to it? Because
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:18.320]  it's not just the taxes. It's, there's just something spiritual about it.
[2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:22.720]  Yeah. You know what? California used to be a beautiful state, but it's not anymore.
[2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:28.640]  I mean, we have Governor Newsom. And I'm going to tell you this guy, he reminds me of the Joker
[2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:34.800]  from Batman. And, you know, he just, he's playing on release in 18,000 convicted fellas from prison.
[2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:38.880]  And in my opinion, he does look like the American psycho. He does. And I think, I mean, would you
[2:02:38.880 --> 2:02:45.040]  trust that guy? He just screams, I'm a criminal. I would trust gas station sushi more than I trust
[2:02:45.040 --> 2:02:50.800]  Gavin Newsom, Democrat in California. But it seems like he's trying to recreate Gotham City
[2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:54.640]  in California. And it's not going to, it's not going to work. I think the people are waiting for
[2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:59.280]  someone like me to, to run for office. No nonsense. No games. Let's get back. I don't think people
[2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:04.080]  know they haven't been out there. There's homeless like in every way, no matter where the hell are
[2:03:04.080 --> 2:03:08.400]  they coming from? You know what? Gavin Newsom forced these people out of their homes. These
[2:03:08.400 --> 2:03:13.040]  people are losing their homes. These are like, we have a mental illness problem in California,
[2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:20.720]  but we also have a poor job problem. We also have a poor economic development problem. We also have
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:25.520]  a poor legislators problem and people are getting moved out of their homes. They can't afford to
[2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:29.360]  live. So they're on the streets. We have homeless children. We have entire families living on the
[2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:35.040]  streets. This is fair to say the state's collapse. Not yet. Not yet, but we're close. We're getting
[2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:39.840]  there. What would a collapse look like? I think a collapse will look like Venezuela. We're close
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:46.800]  to Venezuela. I agree with you. Why did, why do the Democrats seem to accelerate the thing that's
[2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:53.600]  doing at them? I think that because they were elected into office and they have been comfortable
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:03:58.480]  without doing anything for a very long time, people have been comfortable not getting anything for a
[2:03:58.480 --> 2:04:04.880]  long time. And so you have a issue with the mentality of the Democrats are getting elected in
[2:04:04.880 --> 2:04:08.640]  the office. They think that they can play with your emotions and you'll keep getting voted in the
[2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:13.840]  office. But we have President Trump and whether people like him or not, he's opened the eyes of
[2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:18.960]  a lot of people to politics. Now we have people who have never been involved in politics waking up
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:22.160]  and saying, you know what, I don't think this is right in California. We totally agree with you.
[2:04:22.160 --> 2:04:27.760]  I think of the perfect form of arrogant and titled politicians and a corrupt media that backs them
[2:04:27.760 --> 2:04:30.880]  and then they think they can manipulate the public with psychology, but it's not working anymore.
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:35.920]  It's not. It's not even with these face masks. I mean, a billion dollar deal to China,
[2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:40.320]  where the Chinese virus came from, and then turn around and say, hey, we got to force everybody
[2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:47.040]  to wear a mask. I mean, like what type of leadership is that? So do you think the Democrats are
[2:04:47.040 --> 2:04:50.880]  delusional or do you think they have an in-game strategy? I think the Democrats are so out of
[2:04:50.880 --> 2:04:57.040]  touch with what's going on today. They have no, no strategy at all. And now they're just,
[2:04:57.040 --> 2:05:01.360]  you know, shooting from the hip as we like to call in the military. How do you beat,
[2:05:01.360 --> 2:05:05.040]  and I should go over your bio here. We'll do that next segment. How do you beat Maxine Waters?
[2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:09.200]  I mean, just running is just great. She can get on the stage and expose her. But, but I mean,
[2:05:09.200 --> 2:05:13.520]  let's talk about this lady. Does she believe the BS that comes out of her mouth? You know what? I
[2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:17.520]  don't think, I don't even think she knows the BS that comes out of her mouth. I think Maxine Waters
[2:05:17.520 --> 2:05:22.080]  is so delusional. She's been doing the same, the same thing since the seventies when she was elected
[2:05:22.080 --> 2:05:26.080]  into the assembly and she tried to push the same thing in the nineties and it worked. But now,
[2:05:26.080 --> 2:05:29.120]  you know, you're different. You're dealing with a different type of person. You're dealing with
[2:05:29.120 --> 2:05:33.840]  millennials right now who do not care about anything anybody says. You know what I'm saying?
[2:05:33.840 --> 2:05:38.560]  The only thing the millennials need are all these guys that are protesting. All I need is a real
[2:05:38.560 --> 2:05:43.600]  leader to direct that anger in a more positive manner. Well, I found that if you just talk
[2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:48.560]  straight to millennials, they wake up and the generation Z's. This is true. The media claims
[2:05:48.560 --> 2:05:51.360]  they've got control of. I don't think that's the case. It's just that nobody's actually talked to
[2:05:51.360 --> 2:05:54.640]  them straight. They don't. I mean, like look at the amount of statues they're breaking down.
[2:05:54.640 --> 2:05:58.160]  They, they pulling all these statues down. They think they're going to erase history.
[2:05:58.160 --> 2:06:02.800]  And I don't think that's the goal of these millennials. I think they want to be heard.
[2:06:02.800 --> 2:06:06.000]  I think they want a leader who was going to guide them in the right direction. I mean,
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:10.880]  you talk about police reform. Police reform have absolutely nothing to do with police brutality
[2:06:10.880 --> 2:06:14.720]  or police violence, which are two different things. Police reform is simply looking at the
[2:06:14.720 --> 2:06:20.320]  laws that could be used to target people in inner cities. I mean, like we blame the police
[2:06:20.320 --> 2:06:24.400]  when it's the legislators, the laws. Exactly. And I've been preaching the same exact thing.
[2:06:24.400 --> 2:06:28.480]  And I, you know, we went to Minneapolis a couple of days after George Floyd died.
[2:06:28.480 --> 2:06:33.440]  And I told them, I said, look, you guys are upset at the police, but the police are not the problem.
[2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:37.360]  The problem is the laws that have been put in place, i.e. the 94 crime bill,
[2:06:37.360 --> 2:06:42.560]  three strikes law, these laws that the cops have to use to target people in inner cities.
[2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:46.800]  Well, it's like a blueprint for a car. You don't yell the guy on the assembly, I put in a car
[2:06:46.800 --> 2:06:51.600]  together. There's an issue. It's the blueprint. It's the engineers. Exactly. It's not the guy
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:54.640]  welding it. And you're saying it's the cops fault when they're just implementing what they've
[2:06:54.640 --> 2:06:58.560]  been told to do. Exactly. You know what? And I support the police department and I feel like
[2:06:58.560 --> 2:07:03.840]  the legislators in California and across the world, I mean, like, look at Chicago, New York,
[2:07:03.840 --> 2:07:07.520]  these legislators are such cowards that they cannot take responsibility
[2:07:07.520 --> 2:07:12.320]  for their police. For me, it's not about kissing the police ass. It's that they're not the ones
[2:07:12.320 --> 2:07:17.440]  doing this. So to scapegoat a few bad things police do and say as a group, they're all to blame.
[2:07:17.440 --> 2:07:21.680]  Exactly. I don't want to be blamed for what a group does that I'm blamed. Exactly. And what
[2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:27.840]  and so they say in the military, we had a phrase that, you know, one F up would take away a thousand
[2:07:27.840 --> 2:07:31.760]  out of boys. Well, when you have one F up in a police department, why does it have to make the
[2:07:31.760 --> 2:07:37.120]  whole entire police department look bad? How come we can't implement programs or legislations that
[2:07:37.120 --> 2:07:41.440]  target bad cops and get them out? So that's what individualism is all about. That's what Martin
[2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:45.360]  Luther King said over and over again. You don't judge people off of the group. You judge them
[2:07:45.360 --> 2:07:50.320]  off them. Exactly. There's a reason for that. Exactly. And when we stand with the police department,
[2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:54.320]  I support the police department, I support the president backing up the police department. And
[2:07:54.320 --> 2:07:58.480]  I think that these mayors and governors who want the federal help out of their states, I think
[2:07:58.480 --> 2:08:02.240]  they should be ashamed of themselves. Well, I think there's this idiots that are going off the
[2:08:02.240 --> 2:08:07.440]  media coverage. You said it, not me, but they don't get that almost no one respects what mainstream
[2:08:07.440 --> 2:08:13.360]  media says. Just because the news endorses a police chief that badmouts their officers,
[2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:17.200]  the public doesn't buy that. That's true. What's wrong with these politicians, though,
[2:08:17.200 --> 2:08:21.600]  that they still think mainstream media is king. They're trying to retain that spot in office,
[2:08:21.600 --> 2:08:26.080]  and they have nothing to run off of. I mean, what type of economic development have been
[2:08:26.640 --> 2:08:32.240]  made through Los Angeles, Chicago, New York? I mean, AOC, she's the newest representative.
[2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:37.520]  And she made a dumbest... She ran off Amazon. Right? And she said that, oh, they're probably
[2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:42.240]  still in bread. Well, when I look at New York, people are actually getting shot in the streets,
[2:08:42.240 --> 2:08:46.560]  not because of bread. It's because they don't have crime prevention. They got rid of the police
[2:08:46.560 --> 2:08:50.720]  department. You got Bill de Blasio, who's a straight coward. You got Cuomo, who's a coward.
[2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:54.400]  And criminals now know they can kill somebody and get away with it. Absolutely. I got some people
[2:08:54.400 --> 2:09:00.240]  I'm thinking about. Because this breakdown goes much further. It's almost like we have the purge
[2:09:00.240 --> 2:09:06.160]  coming back to the United States. Well, how far does that go, though? Because if the left starts
[2:09:06.160 --> 2:09:09.680]  a purge, don't they get there's going to be another one? You know what? The left will never start a
[2:09:09.680 --> 2:09:14.880]  purge. And the reason why is because they're anti-2A. Right? So if you're anti-2A, that means
[2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:17.760]  you don't support the Second Amendment, which means you don't have guns. It means if you don't
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:21.360]  have guns, you don't know how to use guns. Who know how to use guns? Conservatives and people
[2:09:21.360 --> 2:09:25.520]  who've been in the military and they're not predominantly liberal or Democrat. So they're
[2:09:25.520 --> 2:09:29.600]  going to be out of luck. I'll say this, though, and it's a silver lining to all this. We'll come
[2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:33.440]  back and talk about it more with a man running against Maxine Waters in California. Joe Collins
[2:09:33.440 --> 2:09:38.080]  would say his website hanging in the ball with him. This has made America come closer together,
[2:09:38.080 --> 2:09:42.080]  I think, and really made us all grow up. The fact the left's thrown this giant temper can. We'll
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:47.520]  be right back. Stay with us. We close and lock our doors and windows at night, not because
[2:09:47.520 --> 2:09:52.880]  we're doing anything wrong, but because it's about privacy and it's about security. And it's
[2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:58.080]  something that we do to protect ourselves going back thousands of years when we would post a dog
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:02.320]  or a sentry at the entrance of the village so we would know if predators or criminals were coming.
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:07.040]  Well, big tech, along with the federal government and other globalist organizations,
[2:10:07.040 --> 2:10:11.920]  have been tracking everybody illegally for years with their cell phones. But now the public is
[2:10:11.920 --> 2:10:16.640]  finally waking up because the enemy has openly announced it's the fact. And the Clinton Foundation,

[2:10:21.360 --> 2:10:25.440]  That's right, the Democrats, the globalists, the chai cops, they've all got our number,

[2:12:10.720 --> 2:12:31.680]  Joe Collins is running against Maxine Waters in California. Joe Collins for congress.com.
[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:35.200]  People should really support him. He's a veteran, a patriot. You know, Joe, I should have done this
[2:12:35.200 --> 2:12:39.440]  up front. You're a U.S. Navy veteran, South Central LA native congressional candidate.
[2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:42.640]  Tell the viewers, unless there's a little bit about yourself, I won't get you in the race.
[2:12:42.640 --> 2:12:46.800]  So yeah, I'm from South Central Los Angeles, back before they caught a South LA.
[2:12:47.360 --> 2:12:53.120]  And, you know, I grew up there, born and raised. My house was shot up in a drive-by, actually,
[2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:58.720]  right when I got into high school. I was a freshman. My mom moved up to Texas. I joined the
[2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:05.280]  Navy right out of high school and served 13 and a half years. And I got out of the military to get
[2:13:05.280 --> 2:13:09.760]  involved in politics. And it was kind of like a, it was a situation to where, you know, if you've
[2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:15.520]  been in the military, you know that if you're, if you're, if you're serving, you can't get involved
[2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:19.600]  in politics, right? And so I became a presidential candidate, and then I got out the military. I
[2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:25.040]  got an option to stand in military and drop out of politics or pursue politics and get out the
[2:13:25.040 --> 2:13:30.080]  military. After 13 and a half years, I've done pretty good. I was actually one of the best
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:36.400]  didn't mechanics the Navy had. I chose to get out and got heavily involved in politics. I mean,
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:41.200]  presidential candidate is no joke, but I need to learn politics fast as possible. And so the
[2:13:41.200 --> 2:13:45.680]  administration reached out to me, they said, you have an option. And the options they were giving
[2:13:45.680 --> 2:13:51.760]  me were, you know, run for another race, run administration or run a super pack. And so I got
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:55.520]  out the Navy to run for something. And so I'm like, well, I'm gonna run against Maxine Waters
[2:13:55.520 --> 2:13:58.960]  because I'm from South Central Los Angeles. And every time I go back, that's just the natural thing
[2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:04.240]  to do. I mean, it has to be. It has to be. It has to be. I mean, economic development, where is it?
[2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:08.400]  Quality jobs, where is it? By the way, she's got all these multimillion dollar houses outside the
[2:14:08.400 --> 2:14:14.080]  district. She sends money to her husband's bank. I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know back in
[2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:19.200]  back in the days in the 90s, she's the she's to get the bills or she's to get different projects
[2:14:19.200 --> 2:14:22.960]  and give them to her husband. So we can make money when he was a government contractor. Then,
[2:14:22.960 --> 2:14:28.000]  you know, he became a stockholder in a bank and then she does that too with her husband.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:32.080]  She's a whole different ball game. You know, she's a whole different ball game, but she
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:36.800]  runs the governor, doesn't she Pelosi? Yeah, that's her nephew. So she has to, you know, she's a
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:42.400]  he's a puppy. Pelosi or waters? I think it's probably Pelosi. I'm close. I'm from South
[2:14:42.400 --> 2:14:46.560]  Central Los Angeles. I'm going to say his waters. Yeah. Yeah, but Pelosi is that she's a devil in
[2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:52.800]  herself. You know what I'm saying? But hopefully, you know, next next 2020 2022 cycle, we have some
[2:14:52.800 --> 2:14:56.080]  great candidates running against her. And I'm going to throw my support behind them and do what we
[2:14:56.080 --> 2:14:59.680]  have to do in order to get them in the office. Is she scared when we're going to get debates with
[2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:03.520]  her? When's the if you had a chance to confront her yet? Listen, Maxine Waters is not going to
[2:15:03.520 --> 2:15:08.720]  debate me. The reason why is because when I got out the military, I was homeless, you know, trying
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:13.120]  to get my VA benefits to go through. I mean, we have a lot of homeless veterans in the military
[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:18.880]  and found out I had a broken back in two different places. Wow. And I was waiting and waiting, waiting
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:23.120]  three months. I spent homeless. I went to her office every other day for the internships. I took
[2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:27.600]  her flowers just to get her. That's an incredible. I didn't know this. So literally trying to get your
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:32.320]  military benefits going to her office with your back broke. Look, I went so far as to try and
[2:15:32.320 --> 2:15:39.120]  sue the military because I thought that the reason that I wasn't getting my benefits was because I
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:43.280]  got an administrative separation, general and honorable conditions. I didn't know the VA process
[2:15:43.280 --> 2:15:48.960]  was so broken, but she is as a representative. Her first obligation is to veterans and she
[2:15:48.960 --> 2:15:53.440]  absolutely fell. Did she respond to you? No, she did not. That's why I'm running against her. Because
[2:15:53.440 --> 2:15:58.000]  when I used to walk around... Well, that's a personal story. It is. Wow. Yeah. I don't tell
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:01.200]  it because I don't want sympathy. I don't need sympathy. It's not sympathy, but people need to
[2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:06.880]  know the personal reason. Yeah. That's powerful. So when you go around South L.A. and you look at
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:10.960]  the amount of veterans that we have in South Central Los Angeles, the majority of the homeless
[2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:15.120]  are veterans. I mean, I was sleeping at the pier, Ranchos Palos Verdes at the lighthouse near
[2:16:15.120 --> 2:16:20.480]  a Trump golf course. And the Trump golf course is the only people that treat him in respect.
[2:16:21.040 --> 2:16:24.640]  You know what I'm saying? They gave me food. And when my benefits finally came through,
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:30.800]  I got my condo and I was like, you know what? This is never going to happen to any other veteran
[2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:35.840]  in Los Angeles. Do you think the numbers went from like 30% approval to 80% approval? Trump's
[2:16:35.840 --> 2:16:39.040]  trying. He's fired a lot of people. Have you heard from veterans that it's a little bit better
[2:16:39.040 --> 2:16:44.320]  at the VA? You know what? He did pass a law for veterans. And so it is. You have a choice now.
[2:16:44.320 --> 2:16:47.920]  And you can be honest, but has it gotten better? Yeah, absolutely. Because you can take your
[2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:51.760]  veterans benefits and go to a private doctor now. So that puts competition. But a lot of people
[2:16:51.760 --> 2:16:55.120]  don't know that because we're in a liberal state and they want to do their best to make the president
[2:16:55.120 --> 2:16:58.000]  Trump look bad. I mean, they don't know about criminal justice reform. They don't know about
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:02.400]  opportunity zones. They don't know about veteran choice and about permanent fund and HBCU. When
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:06.800]  you look at what Trump's really done as a populist, I wouldn't call it conservative. I mean, he's done
[2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:12.400]  an incredible job. But this is the thing that he's been seeing. He's been doing this his whole life
[2:17:12.400 --> 2:17:16.320]  ever since he took over his father's business. His whole goal is to create opportunities for
[2:17:16.320 --> 2:17:20.000]  minorities. I mean, like go to any Trump property. Who do you see there? You see black people,
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:24.080]  you see Hispanics, you see from out of town, you see everybody, even white people, everybody's
[2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:27.840]  working at Trump property. And the difference is they're happy compared to other places. Exactly.
[2:17:27.840 --> 2:17:31.280]  So now, you know, when you see, when you hear people say, oh, he's a racist, this,
[2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:35.760]  he's a racist, that and you say, we'll prove it. Well, he said, that's true about the Trump hotel.
[2:17:35.760 --> 2:17:39.040]  I never said this on air because I don't want to be like he said, we catty about it. But
[2:17:39.040 --> 2:17:43.440]  the bartenders are black, the waitresses, the major D's, the managers. I was like, wow, this is
[2:17:43.440 --> 2:17:47.920]  like a black run hotel. Minorities. And they're like paid more than other hotels. And that's
[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:51.440]  every single hotel across the country, even overseas, because I've been to ones overseas.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:57.760]  This is, this is, this is, this is this man. And then when people, so when people call the president
[2:17:57.760 --> 2:18:02.320]  racist, I'm like, well, where, where is he races at? How is he raised? Why do you think Al Sharpton
[2:18:02.320 --> 2:18:06.640]  and Jesse Jackson, he said he was the best white man for black people for 30 years. Now they say
[2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:10.400]  he's bad. Listen, I don't, I don't care what Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson say. You talk about
[2:18:10.400 --> 2:18:14.320]  men who have made hundreds of millions of dollars off the black community, off the black struggle.
[2:18:14.320 --> 2:18:17.920]  I don't trust Jesse Jackson. I don't trust Al Sharpton. They both snakes. They're like the
[2:18:17.920 --> 2:18:21.760]  building fund on the church. You give them all this money because you're expecting to do something.
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:26.640]  They don't even put a door knob on the church. I don't trust these guys. No, I agree with you.
[2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:31.280]  That's the fact. So who are the real black leaders that you know, who do you like? I'm a real black
[2:18:31.280 --> 2:18:34.960]  leader. People who are running for office right now are real black leaders. You know, we have
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:39.600]  tons and tons of black leaders, regardless of whether, you know, we agree with the, with the
[2:18:39.600 --> 2:18:44.240]  rhetoric or not. We have black leaders in their own rights. But you see that private jet he's on.
[2:18:44.800 --> 2:18:50.240]  I've looked at the one trip just across the US, a hundred thousand dollars each way that jet he
[2:18:50.240 --> 2:18:55.600]  was getting on. He's done pretty good for himself. And I respect that. Yeah. All people's, you know,
[2:18:55.600 --> 2:19:00.720]  like you said, the representing, you know, it's just crazy. Absolutely. Look, he's even wearing gloves.
[2:19:00.720 --> 2:19:06.480]  Like he's Michael Jackson. Yeah. But I mean, like how many people has he ever flown on that
[2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:10.480]  jet? Because he looks out for himself. I'm going to tell you, I see him, I see him come to the,
[2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:15.760]  to, to the inner cities and he stirs up drama and he collects his check and he leaves.
[2:19:16.400 --> 2:19:20.960]  You know, I don't, I don't have nothing in common with, you know, Al Sharpton aside for our skin
[2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:27.360]  color. He doesn't resonate with me. He resonated with older black people who are comfortable with
[2:19:27.360 --> 2:19:34.160]  with him. To be honest with you. No disrespect. But what do you think about the numbers of upwards
[2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:39.040]  of 30% of black men supporting Trump versus usually 10% of Republican presidential candidate?
[2:19:39.840 --> 2:19:44.080]  Hey, I think more people need to support President Trump because you think those numbers are accurate 30%?
[2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:50.640]  I think there's more. I know in California, we have a lot of higher. I would assume it's higher.
[2:19:50.640 --> 2:19:54.640]  You have a lot of quiet conservatives in California. I have people, you know, we open up our office
[2:19:54.640 --> 2:19:58.560]  right in the middle of South Central Los Angeles. And I did it for a reason. I wanted to show people
[2:19:58.560 --> 2:20:03.360]  that you don't have to be scared to be a Republican or a conservative in South Los Angeles. I mean,
[2:20:03.360 --> 2:20:07.760]  like, let be not be scared. Let's do it. You know, we can all work together. I got your back,
[2:20:07.760 --> 2:20:13.120]  you have my back. And so it's about audiology, not skin color, like you said. Yeah, I'm, you know,
[2:20:13.120 --> 2:20:16.960]  a lot of people think that the Republican party is for white people. And I can understand that
[2:20:16.960 --> 2:20:22.320]  because being a black Republican, I take a lot of heat from white Republicans who've been Republicans
[2:20:22.320 --> 2:20:26.240]  who they think longer than I have. I've been a Republican since, you know, 2004 when I joined
[2:20:26.240 --> 2:20:32.240]  the military. But at the end of the day, I mean, you cannot preach your mainstream Republican
[2:20:32.240 --> 2:20:37.920]  message to liberals, black people, and predominantly Democrat, this who been Democrat for their whole
[2:20:37.920 --> 2:20:41.760]  life. Let's talk about it when we come back. Is Trump gonna win if the election was held tomorrow?

[2:21:50.160 --> 2:21:54.160]  because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with Google
[2:21:54.160 --> 2:21:58.800]  and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones, even if you opt out of it or get rid of the apps.
[2:21:58.800 --> 2:22:04.720]  People realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your data and using it to control
[2:22:04.720 --> 2:22:10.240]  your life, sharing it with Antifa, sharing it with Black Lives Matter, sharing it with the deep state
[2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:15.040]  to impress not just high-profile people but the general public. That's why folks are taking back
[2:22:15.040 --> 2:22:20.160]  control their lives with these little Faraday cages that you can put your cell phones in that

[2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:40.320]  a huge shipment's coming in next week, so get yours now and be part of the movement to cut
[2:22:40.320 --> 2:22:46.560]  Big Brother off. Much of the United States bureaucracy, all of Hollywood and most of our
[2:22:46.560 --> 2:22:51.120]  media is under international banking control. The United Nations was set up by the Rothschilds
[2:22:51.120 --> 2:22:57.520]  and Rockefellers on record to carry out this operation. Now, under the guise of medical security,
[2:22:57.520 --> 2:23:02.800]  they're bringing us medical charity that we see much of the federal government, the Democrats,
[2:23:02.800 --> 2:23:09.200]  the Republicans, all saying except for Trump and a few people that we need a nationwide force mask
[2:23:09.840 --> 2:23:15.440]  mandate to make everyone wear a mask. Even though just months ago we had the Surgeon General and
[2:23:15.440 --> 2:23:20.640]  others say don't wear a mask, it's all fraud. Now they say you must wear a mask. It's a sign of
[2:23:20.640 --> 2:23:25.680]  slavery. It's a sign of submission. I know you as listeners understand that. We need sheriffs and
[2:23:25.680 --> 2:23:30.320]  county commissioners and city councils and others to stand up and say we are sanctuary cities for
[2:23:30.320 --> 2:23:37.040]  reality and for state and local sovereignty against the globalist. This isn't the federal government
[2:23:37.040 --> 2:23:41.600]  taking over. It's the UN through the federal government and we as American citizens must say no.
[2:23:41.600 --> 2:23:53.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:11.680 --> 2:24:14.240]  But do you, don't you want me to love you?
[2:24:16.640 --> 2:24:22.240]  Coming down fast but a mile's above you. All right, Joe Collins is our guest. He's
[2:24:22.240 --> 2:24:27.760]  running. He's a naval veteran patriot. He's running against Maxine Waters and I should add he's
[2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:32.160]  in the lead of many polls. He's the top Republican candidate and ahead of her in many polls.
[2:24:32.160 --> 2:24:38.640]  You should tell folks up front. That's very exciting. Yeah, we are, we are the Republican
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:43.760]  candidate. There is no other California has a top two jungle, jungle primary and it's me and Maxine
[2:24:43.760 --> 2:24:49.360]  Waters. So I got by in the primaries, but right now we got a brand new team and we are absolutely
[2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:53.120]  killing it in our polls right now. We are running our own independent polls in our communities
[2:24:53.120 --> 2:24:58.640]  and we are polling at 69% right now. 69% over Maxine Waters. So when you're able to get yourself
[2:24:58.640 --> 2:25:03.440]  in front of people, they want the young, fresh, smart conservative. Yeah, you know what? The biggest
[2:25:03.440 --> 2:25:09.120]  thing is that for one, Maxine Waters does not help anybody in the community. Nobody. Unless
[2:25:09.120 --> 2:25:15.360]  you can get her pockets fast, she's not helping anybody. And two, my grandfather was a pastor
[2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:19.600]  and he had the biggest church, the biggest black church before mega churches was a thing.
[2:25:19.600 --> 2:25:23.280]  And so people know me from when I was a little boy like Los Angeles, South Los Angeles is my
[2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:27.200]  community. This is where I grew up. This is where I was born. So they know you're a humble. They know
[2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:32.240]  me. They know me. They know me even if they don't know the owner of General Mills. You know, so these
[2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:35.200]  are these are my people and I'm going to stand. I'm going to fight for these people. I did it when
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:40.160]  I was in military. I came back and I'm doing it right now. I think there is nothing more important
[2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:43.600]  than getting back to the basis and improving the quality of life and giving opportunities to the
[2:25:43.600 --> 2:25:47.920]  people in my own community. Exactly. Cause why should you have communists like AOC and others
[2:25:47.920 --> 2:25:54.000]  taking it away from Democrat scumbags? We need real patriot Americans to be taken over from the
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:59.200]  Democrats. Listen, AOC is an idiot. And I don't even know how she made it into office. I mean,
[2:25:59.200 --> 2:26:06.800]  you know, you think about it. She got on her Instagram and she botched the three branches
[2:26:06.800 --> 2:26:10.560]  of government. Like who does that? You were in Congress. Like you should know these things. If
[2:26:10.560 --> 2:26:14.160]  you were in Congress and you were a freshman, you don't know. I forgot about that. You should be
[2:26:14.160 --> 2:26:19.760]  studying. And then it turned around and say that the crime in New York was because of bread. People
[2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:24.400]  can't pay their bills. They're bread. Don't you know they have a law that you can't get evicted
[2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:31.360]  from your apartment or your house? Exactly. That's what they do. That's what, because of COVID-19
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:40.160]  that has a 99% recovery rate and only a 0.07 death rate. I think it's absolutely ridiculous that
[2:26:40.160 --> 2:26:44.800]  people should visit Joe Collins for congress.com. They should share it because people bitch about
[2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:49.120]  Maxine waters. They bitch about these evil people. Well, then take action. Your word of mouth is
[2:26:49.120 --> 2:26:53.760]  king listeners. If you promote this young man, I say young and we all get old quick, but the
[2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:58.240]  Navy 13, 14 years. I mean, we're all getting old here. The point is, it's time to fight.
[2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:02.160]  That's that. You're young compared to Maxine waters. I'll put you that way. Look, I'm young
[2:27:02.160 --> 2:27:05.760]  compared to a lot of politicians that are in office right now and they all need to go. I mean,
[2:27:05.760 --> 2:27:13.440]  California is the worst. Man, I get scared watching California. Yeah. And we, you realize,
[2:27:13.440 --> 2:27:18.880]  literally without even trying to know Hollywood people, almost everybody I know in Hollywood is
[2:27:18.880 --> 2:27:23.600]  moving to Austin. Yeah. It's ridiculous. I mean, I don't want to name names, but it's ridiculous. And
[2:27:23.600 --> 2:27:27.600]  they're turning Texas purple. Well, that's the weird thing is they come here and then they,
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:31.120]  they keep doing the same thing they did before. Exactly. And I'll tell people all the time,
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:34.480]  the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again, expecting
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:39.280]  different results. So if you leave in California because the policy, the liberal policies are
[2:27:39.280 --> 2:27:43.040]  killing your state, why would you bring that to a new state? Why don't you just adapt to the culture
[2:27:43.040 --> 2:27:50.720]  in that state and live well? Well, the general person moving here, you're right,
[2:27:50.720 --> 2:27:56.720]  doesn't get the politics, but I can tell you the directors, the producers, the big talk show host.
[2:27:56.720 --> 2:28:00.400]  I mean, it's no secret Joe Rogan's moving to Austin though. I'm not supposed to say that,
[2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:04.320]  but I mean, it's not just Elon Musk. It's all of them. Yeah. They're already the drive
[2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:08.240]  on the housing prices way up right now because they're already here. Yeah, sure. I mean,
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:12.800]  and then they say everybody knows leaving. What happened in the last year, the lockdown
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:17.280]  that just made everybody finally just go boom. It was more than a lockdown. I think what happened
[2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:20.880]  was these people voted all these Democrats in the office thinking that they had their best
[2:28:20.880 --> 2:28:27.200]  interests in mind. But lo and behold, you see the evidence is that the Democrats care about
[2:28:27.200 --> 2:28:31.040]  illegal immigration. California is a sanctuary state. They care about illegal immigration.
[2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:36.240]  California gave $150 million to illegal immigrants. They care about illegal immigrants.
[2:28:36.240 --> 2:28:40.800]  They gave another $75 million to illegal immigrants. They care about illegal immigrants
[2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:43.680]  because they gave housing to illegal immigrants and they care about felons because they bought
[2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:49.200]  to let 18,000 prisoners out of jail. And again, for them, it's the vote. It's not,
[2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:53.600]  they don't care about people from other countries. It's the in game of conquering territory.
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:57.440]  Like when Hitler invented Europe, he was blowing up everything because he wanted control of it.
[2:28:57.440 --> 2:29:00.000]  You're like, why are you blowing it up? I'm conquering it. Yeah. That's what they're doing.
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:04.560]  They're conquering everything. They think they are, but let me tell you this. There is not one
[2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:09.520]  Latino, not one Mexican, not one Hispanic that's going to vote for any Democrat because everybody
[2:29:09.520 --> 2:29:14.640]  in California, regardless if you identify with the Democratic party or not, they all have conservative
[2:29:14.640 --> 2:29:19.920]  values. I was about to say why, yeah, for family. Exactly. Exactly. Family. I got to say most of
[2:29:19.920 --> 2:29:23.520]  the Hispanics I talked to that aren't even from the United States. They don't like the Democrats.
[2:29:23.520 --> 2:29:26.800]  They know and they'll tell you right up front. We just came from a communist state. Why are you
[2:29:26.800 --> 2:29:31.280]  guys trying to be communists? It didn't work for us. It's not going to work for you. Trust me. We know.
[2:29:31.280 --> 2:29:36.640]  So there's a major miscalculation. Why do you think people's dead cats are getting
[2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:42.560]  voter registrations in the mail? Oh, you know what? That's just terrible leadership and it shows.
[2:29:42.560 --> 2:29:45.440]  Well, they're scraping all the names. The Democrats are. They're trying to. I mean,
[2:29:45.440 --> 2:29:48.240]  you got dead cats and dead people getting voter registrations too,
[2:29:48.240 --> 2:29:53.920]  but that's just a part of the whole, the voter fraud scheme they have going on in California.
[2:29:53.920 --> 2:29:59.680]  What about police though? Because again, I mean, look, anybody getting killed by bad cops is bad.
[2:29:59.680 --> 2:30:04.640]  There are bad cops and that's terrible. But like 15 black men on average every year get killed
[2:30:04.640 --> 2:30:09.920]  wrongly by police on average. That's wrong. But millions get killed in abortion and you've got
[2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:15.760]  the Democratic Party literally making their whole platform on killer cops. And then when the cops
[2:30:15.760 --> 2:30:19.360]  don't go into the neighborhoods because they're scared to get in trouble, doesn't that cause the
[2:30:19.360 --> 2:30:24.400]  thousands of dead? I would tell you like Canada's only said and I agree with Canada's on some things
[2:30:24.400 --> 2:30:29.120]  and I don't agree with her on other things. But she said this perfect. She said it's so easy to
[2:30:29.120 --> 2:30:33.120]  get black black people wrapped up in their emotions. Black people are so emotional. So if you have a
[2:30:33.120 --> 2:30:37.520]  lot of Democrats, everybody is well, well, yeah, well, if you have a lot of Democrats that that
[2:30:37.520 --> 2:30:42.000]  are pushing this narrative that black people are getting killed by the cops, it will get you
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:46.800]  emotional and you will get upset. And this is what happens when when people get in your emotions.
[2:30:46.800 --> 2:30:51.040]  The statistics don't lie. Do they just stats don't lie stats on them. But I think one thing that
[2:30:51.040 --> 2:30:57.840]  people do miss miscalculate is the police violence and police brutality, which are two totally
[2:30:57.840 --> 2:31:01.120]  different things. Right. So we have a lot of police brutality in Los Angeles.
[2:31:01.120 --> 2:31:04.800]  Isn't it also if you're dressed like you or your campaign manager looks like black James Bond over
[2:31:04.800 --> 2:31:08.320]  here, people are opening doors for you when you're dressed like that. But if you're dressed like a
[2:31:08.320 --> 2:31:12.640]  thug white or black, yeah, if I had my drawers hanging out on a chain and I'm a wider black,
[2:31:12.640 --> 2:31:16.560]  the cops are going to mess with me. So I'm dressed like a gangbanger. I mean, isn't it how you act
[2:31:16.560 --> 2:31:20.720]  is what I got, I got the thing that called you fake it until you make it. When I wanted to be
[2:31:20.720 --> 2:31:24.720]  successful, I started putting on suits and then eventually I became successful. But you can't tell
[2:31:24.720 --> 2:31:28.320]  black people, hey, you need to stop dressing like a gang member and keep getting messed with by the
[2:31:28.320 --> 2:31:31.680]  cops because they don't want to hear that. They think that, oh, well, we should be able to do
[2:31:31.680 --> 2:31:36.320]  what we want to and look how we want to and that this should happen. But I mean, come on, you cannot
[2:31:36.320 --> 2:31:40.640]  lie. I would lock my doors if somebody came by with their pants sagging and you know, dress like
[2:31:40.640 --> 2:31:44.960]  a thug too, because I value my things. Well, that's the thing. Most people want to wear the
[2:31:44.960 --> 2:31:49.840]  crypts or the blood uniform just to act like they're tough, but that's a uniform. But the thing
[2:31:49.840 --> 2:31:55.680]  about it is not a crypts or a blood uniform. It's the social construct of TV. No, I agree.
[2:31:56.400 --> 2:32:01.120]  It's soldier. Yep. No, I agree. And so you see all these people on TV who live in a fabricated
[2:32:01.120 --> 2:32:07.600]  lifestyle. And now they're influencing people, women and men to try to live the same exact
[2:32:07.600 --> 2:32:12.320]  lifestyle that they see on TV. And this stuff is not real. And I cannot stress this enough. The drama
[2:32:12.320 --> 2:32:17.760]  you see on TV is all written down drama. It's about his face. All those, all those reality shows
[2:32:17.760 --> 2:32:21.840]  are exactly it's not real. But people want to imitate the stuff on a regular basis in a black
[2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:25.760]  community because they say, Oh, this is black culture. This is black culture. That's not black
[2:32:25.760 --> 2:32:29.920]  culture. No, that's Hollywood saying that if you go back in history and you look at every single
[2:32:29.920 --> 2:32:34.240]  black culture, what do we have one in black culture? We have suits. We have businesses. We
[2:32:34.240 --> 2:32:38.320]  have families. What don't we have right now suits, businesses or families and what is the result of
[2:32:38.320 --> 2:32:42.800]  that black man going to jail on a regular basis, a black man being at the home, little boys growing
[2:32:42.800 --> 2:32:47.360]  up in single family homes. And now we have a catastrophe. Now, you're absolutely right. And
[2:32:47.360 --> 2:32:51.120]  and that's what people always got. You had to have your own businesses and your own thing. And
[2:32:51.120 --> 2:32:54.480]  now they've taken that away. And we have to get back to that. And that's why I tell my campaign
[2:32:54.480 --> 2:32:58.240]  team, I said, look, we're not going to look like everybody in the community. When we go out, we
[2:32:58.240 --> 2:33:02.000]  were in suits. And now what are the big banks want? They want all Americans not to have their own
[2:33:02.000 --> 2:33:06.000]  businesses. Exactly. Well, at least, at least in California, Gavin Newsom, though, when anybody
[2:33:06.000 --> 2:33:09.840]  have a business and stuff for him, you know, when he shut down the state and this is ridiculous,
[2:33:09.840 --> 2:33:14.880]  this winery is open. He kept his wineries open. And listen, Maxine Waters is a representative
[2:33:14.880 --> 2:33:18.160]  and she's supposed to be so pro black and she's supposed to love our community. They call her
[2:33:18.160 --> 2:33:22.000]  Auntie Maxine for what I have no idea because she leaves everybody hanging. My auntie never left
[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:26.320]  me hanging. But why didn't she say nothing to Gavin Newsom? Like, Hey, why is your winery open?
[2:33:26.320 --> 2:33:29.920]  Everything else is closed down, shut your stuff down too. But no, she didn't do that,
[2:33:29.920 --> 2:33:34.480]  you know, and she she doesn't support the police department. It's the arrogance, though, to keep
[2:33:34.480 --> 2:33:39.280]  all his five wineries open. But all the other wineries were shut down. And that is so criminal.
[2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:48.000]  Well, they're right back. Stay with us. As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality,

[2:35:42.560 --> 2:35:48.240]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com. You can wear
[2:35:48.240 --> 2:35:53.040]  them out to political events. You can trigger it live darts. But one of the biggest reasons is it's
[2:35:53.040 --> 2:35:59.760]  a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween. But on top of that,
[2:35:59.760 --> 2:36:03.600]  they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19
[2:36:03.600 --> 2:36:07.520]  or anything else. It's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force
[2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:13.200]  inoculations and contact tracing of their openly. Announce it. It's an act of submission. It's an
[2:36:13.200 --> 2:36:18.400]  act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down. But a big reason to wear these is then into
[2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:23.360]  stores when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask, say it's just as useless. That's
[2:36:23.360 --> 2:36:29.040]  the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing. And the M95 mask only control what's coming in,
[2:36:29.040 --> 2:36:33.760]  not what's going out. So they quote spread COVID-19. They don't protect from it. So again,
[2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:37.920]  it's a great way to throw it back at these control freak's faces. You buy one for 9.95,
[2:36:37.920 --> 2:36:44.160]  you get four more free. They're at cost infowarstore.com. I know what we'll do to make them conform to
[2:36:44.160 --> 2:36:48.960]  our cult. We'll all tell them to wear masks or they're going to die. And then we'll release the
[2:36:48.960 --> 2:36:52.640]  pressure for a while and then bring it back and squeeze it harder and release it again. And we'll
[2:36:52.640 --> 2:36:57.600]  be the virtues signals. We'll be the angels even though our lord and master Bill Gates helped
[2:36:57.600 --> 2:37:06.880]  fund the whole COVID-19. Oh, no, don't seduce me. That's right. That's the code word for Bill Gates's
[2:37:06.880 --> 2:37:14.800]  operation. He carries out with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult. As you know,
[2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:20.240]  for girls, there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels. One
[2:37:20.240 --> 2:37:27.440]  of them's the vampire, the werewolf, the billionaire, and who else? Oh, that's right. There's the surgeon
[2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:31.920]  and then there's one other one. And it's so much fun to be ruled over by these psychotic
[2:37:31.920 --> 2:37:37.440]  psychopaths. It's so good to know that there are masters and are coming to rape us with their
[2:37:37.440 --> 2:38:02.400]  imoculations. Psychopaths are so hot. Oh, yeah. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda. It's Alex Jones.
[2:38:08.320 --> 2:38:14.000]  Hi, Navy veteran, Joe Collins running its Maxine Waters Fun talking to him here today. You can find
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:21.760]  out more at JoeCollinsForCongress.com. But getting into Elijah Cummings and all the crazy stuff he did,
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:26.240]  you know, when he would sit there and say, how dare Trump put children in cages and they're
[2:38:26.240 --> 2:38:30.000]  in these diapers and he was showing four-year-old stuff for him was under Obama and I wouldn't
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:34.640]  even blame Obama. What's he doing? Millions are coming across the border. But just and then you
[2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:38.960]  said you saw him right before he died. Yeah, I saw him like two weeks before he died. He was
[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:46.960]  he was actually having a lunch to, I guess, like rebut everything that President Trump was saying.
[2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:50.880]  And I'm going to tell you that when I saw him, he was he was pathetic. I'm gonna be honest with you.
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:54.880]  And that's not to not not to, you know, take away from his death, you know, you know, rest his soul
[2:38:54.880 --> 2:38:59.840]  wherever, you know, God may have him. But, you know, how people like, yo, you need to go talk trash to
[2:38:59.840 --> 2:39:04.560]  him because, you know, President gave him $17 billion and the money disappeared. There has been no
[2:39:04.560 --> 2:39:09.360]  economic development in his in his district or anything. When I saw him in a wheelchair, I was
[2:39:09.360 --> 2:39:12.400]  like, I ain't going to talk. I ain't going to talk to this man. You know what I'm saying? This
[2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:16.800]  guy right here that I saw, he was in a wheelchair and it's ordered to pee the shoes on. You know,
[2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:20.880]  he had three or four people to help him get up. I'm like, no, obviously there was a group behind
[2:39:20.880 --> 2:39:26.320]  him controlling. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes. Absolutely was. Absolutely was. And and then, you know,
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:29.680]  he gave his speech. I sat there and I watched his speech. He was the most racist thing I've ever
[2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:33.920]  heard in my whole life. And they always talk about white people being racist, but there are a lot
[2:39:33.920 --> 2:39:38.320]  of black people in a republic and in a democratic party that are absolutely racist. Well, the media
[2:39:38.320 --> 2:39:44.720]  has made it legitimate. And they encourage it to create division. Well, you talk about MSNBC, CNN
[2:39:44.720 --> 2:39:53.600]  and all these other mainstream media who uses reporters to tell the story. Now, last time I'll
[2:39:53.600 --> 2:40:00.880]  check the reporters were were never degree to tell facts. They were only degree to tell opinions.
[2:40:00.880 --> 2:40:06.320]  So I'll take the reporter's opinion like I've watched a movie 99% is BS, 0.1% is true.
[2:40:07.520 --> 2:40:10.800]  Exactly. And now they tell us reporters have fact if their establishment.
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:15.680]  I doubt it. I doubt it. I don't think establishment or not. There is no reporter who has any type
[2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:19.520]  of facts is all opinions. And they the thing about is they tell you their opinions over and over
[2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:23.440]  and over again. And then all of a sudden you start to take on their opinion as if it's your own.
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:27.120]  What would you do if you got elected to Congress for place Maxine Waters? It could happen to people
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:33.920]  get excited. What would you do day one? Day one? I'm gonna take a nap. I'm gonna tell you that
[2:40:33.920 --> 2:40:37.920]  because this is honest. Exactly. Yeah, you just won the campaign. You're gonna take a couple of days
[2:40:37.920 --> 2:40:41.280]  off. Yeah, I got not just one day. One day I'm gonna work a haul. Like I was in the military,
[2:40:41.280 --> 2:40:46.000]  you know, 13 and a half years. All I know is work. So I'll take the first day I'll go to sleep.
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:49.360]  I wake up that night and it's time to get to work. I mean, we need economic development in our
[2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:53.920]  district. We need quality jobs. We need to improve our education system. I think that Trump's ready
[2:40:53.920 --> 2:40:58.640]  to deliver that. Oh, yeah, absolutely. And I support everything that he wants to do for our
[2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:03.200]  community. And I would and I'll tell people like this, you know, regardless, Democrat or Republican,
[2:41:03.200 --> 2:41:06.400]  I was trained in the military, you support the president United States regardless of whatever
[2:41:06.400 --> 2:41:11.760]  political party he is. So that's why the Democrats are so upset. They know that China deal was a
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:16.080]  one sided deal. All Trump's got his flip a switch. Everybody gets a better deal. Trump wants to be
[2:41:16.080 --> 2:41:20.640]  the guy that turned it around. He wants to deliver. I mean, can you imagine if they get out of his
[2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:25.760]  way? What happened? The only thing that a major, a major turnaround until they pull this cover
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:29.840]  crap. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah. China was only good for Joe Biden and his family and that's below in
[2:41:29.840 --> 2:41:34.320]  their family and John Kerry and his family. Because one thing that they all have in common is
[2:41:34.320 --> 2:41:39.600]  they have sons or daughter-in-laws or son-in-laws that work with these companies, you know,
[2:41:39.600 --> 2:41:43.760]  look at Barista and they say, Oh, he's trying to attack a political opponent. Well, first of all,
[2:41:43.760 --> 2:41:48.320]  Joe Biden wasn't even guaranteed to make it. You know what? It wouldn't matter if he was a
[2:41:48.320 --> 2:41:53.600]  political opponent or not. He was never guaranteed to make it into the, into the general election.
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:41:57.840]  I mean, this guy is completely losing his mind. That's my next question. Clearly he's a place
[2:41:57.840 --> 2:42:04.560]  holder. They're going to have a virtual campaign event, a virtual, you know, Democrat convention.
[2:42:04.560 --> 2:42:09.440]  What do you think you're about to pull? You know what? I cannot even tell you, but I know if it's
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:14.560]  what we've been seeing lately is going to be some more BS. Well, the word is,
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:18.960]  they're going to Hillary running again with Obama as her VP. They claim constitutionally.
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:23.920]  He can do that. Obama, constitutionally, Obama cannot run for VP. The reason why, because the
[2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:29.120]  constitutionally specifically says that in order to be VPK, you have to be eligible to run for
[2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:33.520]  president or to be a president. No, I agree with you, but the hills claiming, the media is already
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:37.360]  claiming they can do it. See, and then we won't let it. They'll claim it's racist. That's the
[2:42:37.360 --> 2:42:41.520]  misinformation that the media mainstream media has been telling everybody. They have everybody
[2:42:41.520 --> 2:42:44.720]  hyped up thinking that this thing. Look, if I'm impressed with another constitution on that,
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:49.360]  I had to go look that up myself. Look, I love the constitution. I fight for the constitution.
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:52.880]  I fight for everybody's constitutional rights, regardless of you Democrat or Republican.
[2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:55.280]  But I'll tell you this, Hillary Clinton is about to be going to jail.
[2:42:56.960 --> 2:43:00.880]  Is that what you heard? That's what I know. I mean, look at the evidence. The evidence speaks
[2:43:00.880 --> 2:43:05.360]  for itself. Like Hillary Clinton, all this pit-a-philia, you know, Jeffrey Epstein,
[2:43:05.360 --> 2:43:10.320]  uh, the, the other woman who just got arrested, she's telling when people get arrested,
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:14.480]  these Hollywood stars that hang out with Epstein bragging how they like little girls.
[2:43:16.720 --> 2:43:20.640]  That's why I love five year old girl says whatever her name is. I mean,
[2:43:20.640 --> 2:43:25.040]  why would you be talking like that? Listen, you don't have that stuff in Texas because we have
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:29.440]  open carry laws in Texas. They support their women. They support their military. They support
[2:43:29.440 --> 2:43:33.200]  their families. We don't have that in California. You can't have guns in California is not open
[2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:37.280]  carry state. If we had open carry state in California, you wouldn't have pedophilia in
[2:43:37.280 --> 2:43:41.680]  California because people in Texas, you mess with our kids, we'll shoot you. You mess with
[2:43:41.680 --> 2:43:46.400]  our family to shoot you. And, and that's exactly what we need open carry in California. So we
[2:43:46.400 --> 2:43:51.120]  can protect our families from pedophiles. That's beautiful. That's open carry in California.
[2:43:51.120 --> 2:43:55.600]  We ourselves are pedophilia. That ought to be your campaign slogan. Look, if Gavin Newsom is
[2:43:55.600 --> 2:44:01.600]  going to release 18,000 prisoners, felons, convicted murderers, sex offenders out of prison,
[2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:05.600]  we absolutely need open carry. Well, that's the thing about the left. They go abolish the police,
[2:44:05.600 --> 2:44:10.240]  open the prisons, but you can't have a gun. You know what I mean? What planet is that?
[2:44:10.240 --> 2:44:15.040]  They're getting rid of the police in the inner cities. They're getting rid of police in the
[2:44:15.040 --> 2:44:19.600]  inner cities where we need the most help, which is going to cost mass death, right? Because what
[2:44:19.600 --> 2:44:27.040]  happens? You get rid of the police. What is the point of that? You know what? I can't even fathom
[2:44:27.040 --> 2:44:33.440]  why? You know, because we have gang violence already, domestic violence already, alcohol
[2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:39.440]  related abuse already, pedophilia already, and we have the cartel already. And this is just the
[2:44:39.440 --> 2:44:43.920]  inner city with the police. So that's it though. That's why that's what Nancy Pelosi called MS-13
[2:44:43.920 --> 2:44:48.080]  God's Children. They just want to turn it over to that. What they want to do is they want to keep
[2:44:48.080 --> 2:44:51.840]  people dependent on the government. They want people to beg to the Democratic Party. Oh, please
[2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:56.400]  help us. Help us so much. We need your help, Democratic Party. And if you look at the history
[2:44:56.400 --> 2:45:01.440]  of the Democratic Party, they have never done anything to benefit anyone, anyone. I gotta be
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:06.160]  honest with you. I'm ashamed. I love America, but I'm ashamed of the Democratic Party's part
[2:45:06.160 --> 2:45:10.880]  of America. I mean, when you study them, they are so damn evil. It's like, who is this group?
[2:45:10.880 --> 2:45:14.320]  I'm going to tell you this. They are the evil side of America. Well, they're trying to erase
[2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:19.120]  history. They're pulling down statues. They're trying to rewrite history. Why don't you go
[2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:23.680]  ahead and erase the Democratic Party too? Just move straight off, clear off the face of the earth.
[2:45:23.680 --> 2:45:27.600]  Back in the days, they used to say, you know, if you go too far, you'll fall off the earth.
[2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:32.160]  Take the Democratic Party and just push them right off the earth. We don't need them anymore.
[2:45:32.160 --> 2:45:34.640]  All we need is conservatives, Republicans, and people who want to do the right thing.
[2:45:34.640 --> 2:45:37.600]  I think they know that they're done. That's why they're doing all this.
[2:45:37.600 --> 2:45:42.080]  They're trying to. But you know what? That's why I'm very excited that we have a lot of great
[2:45:42.080 --> 2:45:45.680]  candidates that are running for office. A lot of great Republican conservative candidates running
[2:45:45.680 --> 2:45:49.520]  for office in California. No, I agree. The Democrat freak out is because they know there's a big
[2:45:49.520 --> 2:45:54.160]  red wave coming. Yeah, I would even call Republican just populist. And I'm excited for what you're
[2:45:54.160 --> 2:45:58.160]  doing. Joe Collins, Joe Collins for congress.com. We got two minutes left. We got a break. I'm gonna
[2:45:58.160 --> 2:46:02.320]  come back and take some calls and finish up with our next guest host is joining us. But what else
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:05.840]  you want to impart the viewers? Like this is what I'm going to tell you. We said this earlier,
[2:46:05.840 --> 2:46:10.400]  definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over and over, expecting a different
[2:46:10.400 --> 2:46:15.920]  result, voting for Democrats, voting for people who want to allow the police to be dismantled,
[2:46:15.920 --> 2:46:20.480]  has not been working for anybody. It's time for us to vote for somebody new. Doesn't matter Democrat,
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:26.400]  doesn't matter Republican, vote someone new into office. Someone who's going to support our president,
[2:46:26.400 --> 2:46:31.040]  take those programs and improve your cities. We got to stop calling people racist just because
[2:46:31.040 --> 2:46:36.160]  of our own personal ideology. Let's look into the past. Let's look into what these people are doing
[2:46:36.160 --> 2:46:39.840]  for us. And if it's not working for you, both somebody else in office, you only got two years,
[2:46:39.840 --> 2:46:45.840]  vote them out, vote somebody else. It's all I'm saying. We need turnover. We need turnover and term
[2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:52.880]  limits. Looking at Maxine Waters and Pelosi, they're both going so insane. I hope you win,
[2:46:52.880 --> 2:46:58.160]  but there's also kind of entertainment value to it, but it's scary. There is absolutely an
[2:46:58.160 --> 2:47:01.680]  entertainment value running against, especially somebody like Maxine Waters. I mean, I hear her
[2:47:01.680 --> 2:47:06.960]  all the time in peace 45 in peace 45. Nobody's trying to hear that. Nobody's trying to hear
[2:47:06.960 --> 2:47:11.440]  that anymore. What are we doing to provide opportunities, economic development to our
[2:47:11.440 --> 2:47:15.120]  community? So what are you getting on the street? You're saying you see a red wave?
[2:47:15.840 --> 2:47:21.920]  Look, I know for myself, from my campaign, we're polling at 69% right now. I'm in a Democratic
[2:47:21.920 --> 2:47:28.560]  district. They say it's 54 plus. Doesn't matter to me. People love me. People love me in my
[2:47:28.560 --> 2:47:32.880]  district. We're winning, but we need the support from the entire country. So you're able to get
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:36.160]  in front of people you win. The question is, can you get in front of them? That's what we're
[2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:40.000]  doing right now. I mean, like we have our food drives going three or four times a week in different
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:44.960]  areas of the district. We have programs that we have NASA that we're putting back into our high
[2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:49.520]  schools. We're working with the aviation community to try to provide journeymen and apprenticeship
[2:47:49.520 --> 2:47:54.560]  programs to get people qualified to work at quality jobs without having a degree. I mean,
[2:47:54.560 --> 2:47:58.480]  we're doing things that are elected representatives should be doing on a regular basis. You're doing
[2:47:58.480 --> 2:48:01.680]  their job already. You know what? I didn't want to say it, but you said it, but yeah, we're doing
[2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:06.880]  their job. So why not give us Joe Collins for congress.com. Joe Collins. We appreciate you,
[2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:11.040]  man. Thank you. I'm glad you guys are here in Austin. Really appreciate everybody should visit
[2:48:11.040 --> 2:48:14.320]  the website. They should support what you're doing because you're going up against pure evil. I'm
[2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:19.200]  going to come back, take a few calls, then I've got a special report and then Matt Bracken takes
[2:48:19.200 --> 2:48:25.040]  over ahead of the war room with Owen Stroyer. We're live on this Thursday, July 16th, 2020
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:34.240]  transmission, 109 days out from the election. Americans have had freedom for so long. And
[2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:40.320]  most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history that we really
[2:48:40.320 --> 2:48:46.080]  have a blind spot for tyranny. We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice due process,
[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:50.000]  the right to self defense, private property because we've had it so long and we just think
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:54.720]  that's how the rest of the world is. Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract
[2:48:54.720 --> 2:48:59.840]  that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to
[2:48:59.840 --> 2:49:05.280]  empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented. And that's what made our modern
[2:49:05.280 --> 2:49:10.720]  world. That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists, who say humans are ugly and
[2:49:10.720 --> 2:49:16.400]  bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumb down and put into subgroups that the elites
[2:49:16.400 --> 2:49:21.040]  dominate, manipulate and command even if we're even lucky enough to stay alive. And that's what
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:27.680]  COVID-19 is, a global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against
[2:49:27.680 --> 2:49:30.960]  prosperity and against your future. If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:37.680]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if you go back to those shows,
[2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:44.880]  we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would
[2:49:44.880 --> 2:49:50.960]  manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict large groups of human movements
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:55.200]  and activities, but even predict what individuals would do. And then once you could predict what
[2:49:55.200 --> 2:50:00.800]  individuals were going to be doing, you could add stimuli through the AI systems, through the
[2:50:00.800 --> 2:50:06.000]  computers, through digital billboards, through face scanning, through the social credit score
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:10.960]  to control people and make them act like you wanted to. But when we cover that, the media would
[2:50:10.960 --> 2:50:15.600]  attack us and say we were making it up. It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the
[2:50:15.600 --> 2:50:20.560]  actual corporate level blueprint documents. Well, the next level of the blueprint documents
[2:50:20.560 --> 2:50:25.120]  explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete
[2:50:25.120 --> 2:50:29.920]  and phase us out. And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[2:50:29.920 --> 2:50:51.280]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[2:51:00.160 --> 2:51:08.560]  We are back live, taking your phone calls for two segments.
[2:51:08.560 --> 2:51:13.280]  Thanks for holding after those guests were on. And then Matt Bracken takes over.
[2:51:15.760 --> 2:51:20.880]  Well, with the name like shrimp dog, we got to go to him. We'll go to Steve Austin, Ruben, Debbie,
[2:51:20.880 --> 2:51:27.520]  Christian and Anonymous. Shrimp dog, you're on the air from Texas. Go ahead.
[2:51:27.520 --> 2:51:37.200]  Thank you, Alex Jones. May Almighty Father Yahweh in heaven above bless you and all of your loved
[2:51:37.200 --> 2:51:44.880]  ones. You too, brother. Because we are the electromagnetic morphogenic, telekinetic
[2:51:45.520 --> 2:51:55.360]  transmitters and receivers. Yes. The body of Messiah Yeshua. And here's holy, holy, holy spirit,
[2:51:55.360 --> 2:51:59.760]  my brother. I can tell you're, I can tell you're transmitting right now, brother.
[2:52:01.760 --> 2:52:09.440]  May Yahweh also bless all of our enemy because they will be blessed with a just and righteous
[2:52:09.440 --> 2:52:14.720]  reward, my brother Alex. I'll tell you that, praise Yahweh. Now that we say some praise for
[2:52:14.720 --> 2:52:21.280]  the Yahweh above, now let me thank my uncle. Yes, I call him uncle. Uncle deal maker,
[2:52:21.280 --> 2:52:28.480]  President Donald J. Trump. Thank you for reaching deep down and grabbing your nuts and doing the
[2:52:28.480 --> 2:52:37.360]  right thing and the just thing about Mr. Roger Stone. And I put the video on and I dance with
[2:52:37.360 --> 2:52:44.800]  Roger and his family still now. Yes. Because us Sicilians do know how to dance. I'll tell you
[2:52:44.800 --> 2:52:52.560]  that Alex Jones. And, and if you can dance, you can fight too. That's what's up. And I'm also
[2:52:52.560 --> 2:53:01.440]  looking for forward to Donald, the uncle POTUS reaching deep down again and grabbing the nutsack
[2:53:01.440 --> 2:53:09.440]  of righteousness for General Michael Flynn. Because I did sign that petition to Alex and Don.
[2:53:09.440 --> 2:53:16.480]  Yes, I did. And I signed up for the outkeepers to shrimp dog. It's beautiful. No, I can tell you
[2:53:16.480 --> 2:53:21.440]  right now. Metaphysically, I can see it. Trump's going on the warpath. So it's going to get crazy
[2:53:21.440 --> 2:53:28.400]  now, brother. Bring it on. I agree. I'm ready for war. I told the new Lord to bring it on.
[2:53:28.400 --> 2:53:33.680]  It's not about a tough anymore, man. I'm just sick of these people. I had a dream last night
[2:53:34.400 --> 2:53:37.360]  where they put me in the ring on this big stone plateau.
[2:53:37.360 --> 2:53:43.120]  So all these people watching with this giant record machine and this back like this eight
[2:53:43.120 --> 2:53:49.520]  foot giant. And I felt confident I was going to beat him in the dream. But the whole point was
[2:53:49.520 --> 2:53:54.560]  is that's what this is all about. That's right, brother. But now what's coming next?
[2:53:55.200 --> 2:54:01.440]  If and when felt inspired, everyone will loosen up and recognize that COVID-19 is a scam.
[2:54:01.440 --> 2:54:06.560]  Then when we're relaxed and fat and happy again, watching our sports,
[2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:14.320]  they'll release the real bio weapon. I agree. Man made super deadly camera that looks live
[2:54:14.320 --> 2:54:19.440]  and act just like COVID-19, but has a much, much higher kill rate. I agree.
[2:54:20.880 --> 2:54:26.400]  Also, I'm on record on the war room. They arrived in that one day. We're going to wake up
[2:54:26.400 --> 2:54:33.360]  and find out that we bomb China in thompson. So overnight they're going to bomb China and
[2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:39.840]  blame it all on Trump, of course, and use that as an excuse of why they had to kill him because
[2:54:39.840 --> 2:54:44.400]  he flew off the handle in bomb China without anyone else's support.
[2:54:46.640 --> 2:54:50.800]  Well, you're laying the heavy knowledge on a shrimp dog. Thank you. God bless you. Wow.
[2:54:50.800 --> 2:54:55.840]  Wow. Yeah, that's exactly the type of stuff we're involved in now. I totally agree with the caller.
[2:54:56.400 --> 2:54:59.040]  We are in uncharted, super dangerous territory right now.
[2:55:03.280 --> 2:55:07.120]  Wow. I'm just speechless after that call. Wow. I'm glad I went to shrimp dog.
[2:55:07.920 --> 2:55:12.240]  Always put shrimp dog to the headline now and shrimp dog calls. We're going to come back
[2:55:12.880 --> 2:55:17.120]  and I'm going to jam in five or six calls. Reuben, Stephen, Austin, Debbie, Christian and
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:22.960]  autonomous. Anonymous is the same thing as autonomous. We're going to take those calls
[2:55:22.960 --> 2:55:28.640]  straight ahead. All I want is a pro human future. I don't give a rat's ass what color you are.
[2:55:28.640 --> 2:55:33.040]  You got red blood. You got your soul pointed to God. You want to fight Satan?
[2:55:33.040 --> 2:55:47.040]  You're on my team. I'm on your team. Let's get it done.
[2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:07.920]  The American Eagle are Nazis. No, George Soros and funds, snopes and media matters.
[2:56:07.920 --> 2:56:12.800]  And the rest of them, he's the real Nazi collaborator. But this shirt, I think,
[2:56:12.800 --> 2:56:16.640]  is really the perfect campaign shirts. We made one even better than what Trump's people came
[2:56:16.640 --> 2:56:21.440]  up with. Two different versions of it. With something even worse, the Betsy Ross flag,
[2:56:21.440 --> 2:56:26.640]  our first flag, that they also say is racist, even though she was a famous abolitionist. So,
[2:56:26.640 --> 2:56:32.080]  these shirts are at infowars.com. They're the American Eagle, Betsy Ross flags. Two different
[2:56:32.080 --> 2:56:36.160]  designs, guaranteed to spread the word, and of course, trigger lip tarts everywhere.
[2:56:36.160 --> 2:57:04.960]  Exercise your first amendment or lose it, infowarsstore.com.
[2:57:04.960 --> 2:57:09.200]  She'll slice you apart. She's cool, cool, black.
[2:57:12.240 --> 2:57:21.200]  Moves like cats. And if she gets your name, you might not make it back.
[2:57:24.800 --> 2:57:32.720]  She's got the looks that kill. That kill. She's got the looks that kill.
[2:57:32.720 --> 2:57:39.040]  That kill. That kill. She's got the looks.
[2:57:43.120 --> 2:57:52.880]  Yeah, she's moving through. She keeps the motor clean. You believe me, you. She's a number 13.
[2:57:52.880 --> 2:58:00.640]  She's a number 13. With the clock strikes midnight.
[2:58:02.320 --> 2:58:08.240]  Most important part right here. Crank it up. She's gonna turn on the juice boy.
[2:58:10.800 --> 2:58:16.960]  And then she'll turn on the power. Globalists don't want you to have power.
[2:58:16.960 --> 2:58:24.560]  Then when you'd have enslavement, I want you to have control of the future, control of your destiny,
[2:58:24.560 --> 2:58:30.240]  and a connection to God. That's real power. She's got the look.
[2:58:32.480 --> 2:58:36.080]  All right, let's go through these calls and closing before Matt Bracken takes over.
[2:58:37.040 --> 2:58:39.600]  Anonymous in Pennsylvania. You're on the air worldwide.
[2:58:39.600 --> 2:58:50.000]  And you hear the Jeopardy music. We'll go back to Anonymous in a minute.
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:53.520]  Let's go to Stephen in Florida. Stephen, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:58:54.560 --> 2:59:00.320]  Yeah. Hey, Alex. First of all, I want to say Joe Collins, I hope you take Mad Maxine toilet
[2:59:00.320 --> 2:59:03.680]  waters and flush her insanity down the sewer. Yes, sir.
[2:59:03.680 --> 2:59:09.200]  I want to give a quick plug before I get to what I called about which is the election
[2:59:09.840 --> 2:59:13.920]  for some of your products, Alex, which I've been using a lot of them for a long time.
[2:59:13.920 --> 2:59:21.280]  I'm a runner and this heat in Florida is brutal. So before I go run, I will take
[2:59:21.280 --> 2:59:31.600]  turbo force and brain force plus vaso beat ultra 12 and super male. And then after my run,
[2:59:31.600 --> 2:59:39.280]  I will mix a scoop of ultra bone broth with some organic almond milk. And I'll tell you,
[2:59:39.280 --> 2:59:42.720]  that really helps me immensely. So thank you very much for that.
[2:59:42.720 --> 2:59:46.720]  No, no, thank you for the support. These are all amazing products. They're all game changers.
[2:59:46.720 --> 2:59:49.600]  I think the products you mentioned is a good place for people to start
[2:59:49.600 --> 2:59:53.280]  at infowarstore.com without the purchases we wouldn't be here. So thank you for the support,
[2:59:53.280 --> 2:59:55.360]  brother. I'm glad you tried the products out and had a good result.
[2:59:55.360 --> 3:00:02.640]  Yeah. Now, I actually mentioned the election, but I want to mention something else real quickly.
[3:00:03.440 --> 3:00:09.280]  You mentioned about this 16 year old kid with this oppositional defiant disorder. Of course,
[3:00:09.280 --> 3:00:12.880]  that's all part of the American Psychiatric Association.
[3:00:12.880 --> 3:00:18.800]  Yeah. No, the new thing is they forcibly now sterilize you to be a tranny. So true medical
[3:00:18.800 --> 3:00:22.400]  experiments, true for sterilization now happening. You believe this?
[3:00:22.400 --> 3:00:28.080]  Yeah. Well, here's the thing. I want to tie it in with COVID-19 because think about this, Alex.
[3:00:28.080 --> 3:00:33.440]  They forcibly removed kids from their homes. So the kids freak out. They don't want to be subjected
[3:00:33.440 --> 3:00:39.280]  to this. They diagnosed it as this oppositional defiant disorder. Boom. Okay. So we're going to
[3:00:39.280 --> 3:00:42.960]  inject them and we're going to also drug them with these antipsychotic drugs.
[3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:46.640]  Yeah. That's the global plan in the families to sterilize men. It's the whole
[3:00:46.640 --> 3:00:53.200]  Tabistock Institute, the Caitlyn Jenner. It's the plan. Now, let me get to the election. I'm
[3:00:53.200 --> 3:00:58.960]  going to go out on a limb here and make a prediction. I don't see the election happening
[3:00:59.520 --> 3:01:04.720]  unless. Now, here's why first of all. Oh, I agree. They're planning. I don't want to tell
[3:01:04.720 --> 3:01:09.520]  listeners this. I'll say it. Well, the 109 days out, they're planning on canceling it. They got
[3:01:09.520 --> 3:01:14.560]  something big planned. Well, here's the thing. Antifa Black Lives Matter, they're attacking
[3:01:14.560 --> 3:01:20.400]  all over the place. And I think that what they're going to do is try to sabotage the election with
[3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:25.520]  attacking the polling places. Plus, Alex, I don't know if you know this, you probably do.
[3:01:25.520 --> 3:01:31.920]  Dave Hodges has talked about this with the commonsense show, but the Chai comms through
[3:01:31.920 --> 3:01:37.520]  Harry Reid and his backdoor deal with them, giving them control over the wind and solar farms.
[3:01:37.520 --> 3:01:43.200]  They have South soldiers here overseeing those farms, which are waiting to awaken.
[3:01:43.200 --> 3:01:47.760]  Sir, I've been hearing this forever. Now they're catching and shipping weapons and silencers in.
[3:01:48.320 --> 3:01:53.040]  And I knew this months ago from sources and law enforcement, they were busting giant caches. I
[3:01:53.040 --> 3:01:59.760]  mean, thousands of full auto machine guns out of China being given to Antifa and BLM. They really
[3:01:59.760 --> 3:02:04.560]  are planning a violent overthrow. And they think we'll roll over during I think it'll blow up in
[3:02:04.560 --> 3:02:11.200]  their face. God bless you, Steve. Okay, up next now is Christine in California. Thanks for holding.
[3:02:11.200 --> 3:02:16.000]  Go ahead. Hi, Christine in California. Welcome.
[3:02:19.840 --> 3:02:23.600]  All right, they're gone. Debbie Debbie in New Jersey. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[3:02:24.240 --> 3:02:29.280]  Hey, Alex. So I was calling New Jersey one at 1.5. First of all, I just want to tell you
[3:02:29.280 --> 3:02:34.880]  and they blocked me. I gave out your band video to Bill Spadia and Dennis and Judy.
[3:02:34.880 --> 3:02:40.560]  Now I'm no longer allowed to call. Well, you should use a spoofing number to call in and
[3:02:40.560 --> 3:02:44.080]  just change your name. But that's crazy. Well, good job doing that. Thank you.
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:49.440]  The Hell's Angels, the outlaws and the pagans
[3:02:51.360 --> 3:02:55.520]  fought each other for the longest time. They are no longer fighting each other.
[3:02:56.400 --> 3:03:00.960]  Okay, because they were threatened. The Hell's Angels were threatened by Black Lives Matter
[3:03:00.960 --> 3:03:06.720]  over a radio station and they showed up in Seattle and they've been showing up at all their little
[3:03:06.720 --> 3:03:14.480]  events and they said they're not standing down against this BS going on. So Obama had his army
[3:03:14.480 --> 3:03:21.600]  with MS-13 and all these other little retards. They got a fight on their hands because no,
[3:03:21.600 --> 3:03:25.040]  no, I agree with you. The motorcycle gangs, you're right have stopped fighting each other
[3:03:25.040 --> 3:03:31.680]  because it relies the whole country's under attack. That's right. I can't wait. I'm cheering them on
[3:03:31.680 --> 3:03:36.080]  and everybody should cheer them on. That's why they've been demonizing these guys for years and
[3:03:36.080 --> 3:03:41.760]  years because they know these are the guys that aren't going to take their crap. I agree with you.
[3:03:41.760 --> 3:03:49.200]  What else is going to happen now, Debbie? I think, I think really they're going to be the ones,
[3:03:49.200 --> 3:03:54.080]  they're going to be the saviors along with the mafia families as well because I have relatives
[3:03:54.080 --> 3:04:00.160]  that are in there too. Everybody's working together. These guys think they're such hot crap.
[3:04:00.160 --> 3:04:06.080]  I can't wait. I really can't, Alex, because I'm done with it. Well, you're right that even the
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:12.160]  mafia and even the Hells Angels and the Mongols and all those groups, they recognize an outside
[3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:18.640]  group taking them over. And so they see a CHICOM funded group taking them over. At least they
[3:04:18.640 --> 3:04:24.400]  have the instincts to not roll over. Is that what you're saying? You got it. 100% and they're not
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:30.960]  going to roll over because I hear what goes on in their church, if you know what I'm saying. Oh,
[3:04:30.960 --> 3:04:34.720]  I hear you. Well, God bless you, Debbie. Thanks for the call. All right. Let's take a few more
[3:04:34.720 --> 3:04:39.040]  calls here and close this out. Ruben in text has been holding a long time. Ruben, go ahead.
[3:04:40.240 --> 3:04:43.040]  Yes, sir. Thank you, Alex, for taking my call. I really appreciate it. Thank you, brother.
[3:04:43.920 --> 3:04:50.160]  Just wanted to, so I do have a few suggestions for the president as well as listeners and even
[3:04:50.160 --> 3:04:55.520]  info wars, what we can do to combat this clear communist threat that we face, this Marxist-Leninist
[3:04:55.520 --> 3:05:00.720]  threat. Oh yeah, this is an attempted coming, Tego. Absolutely. I see it in Austin all the time.
[3:05:00.720 --> 3:05:07.360]  And also I want to point you and your crew to a video of Chrissy Teigen getting asked on the red
[3:05:07.360 --> 3:05:13.440]  carpet a few years back, where's the craziest place that she had sex? And she told the camera guy,
[3:05:13.440 --> 3:05:18.560]  or the reporter, rather, she looked at her husband on camera and said, what about that Obama thing?
[3:05:18.560 --> 3:05:22.160]  And her husband's face, you guys have to play that video. But before I get into my suggestion,
[3:05:22.160 --> 3:05:27.120]  we will. Chrissy Teigen asked about Crazies Place. She had sex. Is that the name of the video?
[3:05:28.640 --> 3:05:32.960]  Just type in Chrissy Teigen, the Obama thing. And it should be the,
[3:05:32.960 --> 3:05:36.080]  Oh, there it is. They already got it up. All right. We got one minute, sir. Finish.
[3:05:36.800 --> 3:05:41.200]  Yes. Yes, sir. So real quick, Alex, before I get into my point, just want to throw out there,
[3:05:41.840 --> 3:05:46.000]  out here in Austin at one of the PD police departments, I'm not going to say which one,
[3:05:46.000 --> 3:05:50.160]  but I was a video technician. I have extensive linear editing video.
[3:05:50.160 --> 3:05:50.960]  Sure. So what'd you say?
[3:05:52.880 --> 3:05:56.000]  No, I just wanted to throw it out there. If you guys need crew or anybody behind
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:01.280]  is one of the camera, I have experienced film experience editing. I've done acting. I can do
[3:06:01.280 --> 3:06:06.000]  it all. So I've been. Okay, guys, get his name and number. Give it to Rob do or give it to Daria.
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:09.600]  Because we do need to hire a few more crew members because I don't have the extra money,
[3:06:09.600 --> 3:06:13.600]  but I'm just spending everything we got to expand. So yes, sir, I love you. I appreciate your ribbon.
[3:06:13.600 --> 3:06:16.960]  Give his name and number to do. All right. I'm sorry to Austin and Maryland.
[3:06:17.840 --> 3:06:21.440]  I got to like 40, 50 calls that is a good job. I'm out of time.
[3:06:21.440 --> 3:06:25.600]  Matt Bracken is ready to talk about all this best selling author for my Navy SEAL counterterrorism
[3:06:25.600 --> 3:06:30.800]  expert. He takes over on the other side, but an incredible time to be alive. Please stay with
[3:06:30.800 --> 3:06:35.600]  us. These are these are just incredible times. It's about to all get a lot crazier than the
[3:06:35.600 --> 3:06:42.400]  war rooms coming up today with special guests. Imagine telling someone just a year ago that
[3:06:42.400 --> 3:06:47.680]  in the middle of 2020, the Democrats, as well as many Republican leaders will be calling for the
[3:06:47.680 --> 3:06:56.640]  United Nations WHO edict that all Americans wear masks, be a quote federal order and mandate,
[3:06:57.200 --> 3:07:03.840]  totally unconstitutional, annihilating states rights. Think about that. A woman can kill her
[3:07:03.840 --> 3:07:10.720]  baby. We pay for illegal aliens health care, but you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed
[3:07:10.720 --> 3:07:16.560]  20 plus times less than what they said, even if you believe the official story. This is about the
[3:07:16.560 --> 3:07:23.120]  WHO, the globalist testing their power through the media, over the federal government to set
[3:07:23.120 --> 3:07:28.480]  policy in the United States. This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the
[3:07:28.480 --> 3:07:34.320]  Paris Accord and all of it. And by the way, they admit that they say now your carbons down one
[3:07:34.320 --> 3:08:02.880]  way or another, you stupid Americans. We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water.
[3:08:02.880 --> 3:08:08.880]  So make sure that it's always available to you with the Alexa pure water filtration system.
[3:08:08.880 --> 3:08:14.320]  This gravity fed system filters through all the toxins and gets straight to clean,
[3:08:14.320 --> 3:08:24.560]  healthy, great tasting water. Yummy in my tummy. Bring the purest, most refreshing water to your
[3:08:24.560 --> 3:08:36.320]  home by ordering the Alexa pure water filtration system today from infowarstore.com. Other systems
[3:08:36.320 --> 3:09:03.200]  just don't compare. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption.
[3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:16.000]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken. Okay, it's good to be back talking to information army.
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:23.920]  You know, there's supposed to be an election this November, but whether it is actually pulled off
[3:09:23.920 --> 3:09:30.560]  or not remains to be seen. And whether the result will be respected by either side,
[3:09:30.560 --> 3:09:37.440]  I think is it's very unlikely that it will. So by what should be the transition time
[3:09:37.440 --> 3:09:44.960]  late this fall, I think we're going to be in something resembling a full scale civil war.
[3:09:45.760 --> 3:09:53.600]  And why do I say that? What's the basis for that? You know, it's obvious to anybody with eyes
[3:09:53.600 --> 3:10:02.560]  that can think that Joe Biden is at this point in his life no more than an empty shell. He's a suit
[3:10:02.560 --> 3:10:11.360]  with a massive blob of protoplasm inside of it that on a good day can read teleprompters,
[3:10:11.920 --> 3:10:19.120]  even though he has absolutely no sense of timing or what thought goes with what thought. And it's
[3:10:19.120 --> 3:10:29.200]  obvious that he might as well be just a virtual candidate. So who's really running him? By now,
[3:10:29.200 --> 3:10:38.320]  it's readily apparent that the Sanders clique along with the Obama clique are running him.
[3:10:38.320 --> 3:10:47.600]  That's who's in the basement writing his scripts. Even going a throwback to the 60s and 70s radical
[3:10:47.600 --> 3:10:55.360]  era. Angela Davis said she's going to support Biden. Not that she likes Biden, but she knows
[3:10:55.360 --> 3:11:05.280]  he's just basically a stand in for hard left politics. Angela Davis is a communist who brought
[3:11:05.280 --> 3:11:10.960]  guns to people who murdered a judge in court. She escaped the country. She became a left wing
[3:11:10.960 --> 3:11:17.440]  heroine. She was trained by the Soviets while she was out of the country. She later became
[3:11:17.440 --> 3:11:26.960]  a law a lauded professor, a famous professor, a communist terrorist became a professor. Who does
[3:11:26.960 --> 3:11:33.600]  that sound like? That sounds like Bill Ayers, whose wife is Bernadine Dorn. They were weather
[3:11:33.600 --> 3:11:40.800]  underground terrorists also who were welcomed back into academia and served out full careers.
[3:11:40.800 --> 3:11:50.160]  So these guys now are in their late 70s and this is their last hurrah. They have never
[3:11:50.160 --> 3:11:59.760]  gone away. The same weather underground SDS terrorists from the 60s have been influencing
[3:12:01.200 --> 3:12:07.920]  the next three generations of Marxists coming through college. So now we've got multiple
[3:12:07.920 --> 3:12:15.280]  generations of college professors and now even high school professors or teachers that have been
[3:12:15.280 --> 3:12:24.480]  indoctrinating students in Marxism and the fruit is now being born. Another name that you've never
[3:12:24.480 --> 3:12:28.800]  heard of that I'd like you probably have never heard of that I'd like to introduce to you who
[3:12:28.800 --> 3:12:36.080]  was a contemporary of Bill Ayers and Angela Davis and Mark Rudd of the Weather Underground
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:46.960]  is a guy named Bob Avakian and Bob Avakian since 1979 has run the revolutionary communist party
[3:12:46.960 --> 3:12:56.480]  of the USA. You'll see on signs at demonstrations in the corner look for Revcom and it's revcom.us is
[3:12:56.480 --> 3:13:03.600]  their website but they can't make the word us the sound us come out of their mouth so when they
[3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:10.880]  when you hear them refer to their website it's revcom.us that's a tell if a reporter or anybody
[3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:19.600]  else is referring to revcom and they say revcom.us you know they're one of them. Anyway Bob Avakian
[3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:26.800]  has been a prolific author he's been around forever his um his version of communism he calls the new
[3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:35.920]  communism is a Maoist synthesis so Mao Tse Tung who killed you know 50 to 100 million in China
[3:13:36.960 --> 3:13:45.680]  during the course of the 20th century he's the he's the ideological basis for Bob Avakian's
[3:13:45.680 --> 3:13:52.960]  new communism. They've never quit now they're saying revolution nothing less nothing else full
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:59.120]  revolution they are going for it right now and something that that drives me nuts and people
[3:13:59.120 --> 3:14:04.480]  that should know better are often looking at places like Portland or Seattle or Minneapolis and
[3:14:04.480 --> 3:14:10.560]  they're saying oh they're anarchists look at those people smashing windows and burning buildings
[3:14:10.560 --> 3:14:16.000]  they're anarchists they are not anarchists and this is the first layer of the onion I'd like to
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:23.920]  peel back anarchists don't have a goal or a purpose they just have disorder for disorder's sake a
[3:14:23.920 --> 3:14:30.640]  literal anarchist believes that mankind can just function like in nature with no government no police
[3:14:30.640 --> 3:14:38.240]  no laws obviously that's insane that makes pure libertarianism look logical and and plausible
[3:14:38.240 --> 3:14:46.400]  so the people that are being called anarchists are actually the two layers now overt layers
[3:14:46.400 --> 3:14:56.240]  are Antifa and BLM Antifa stands for antifascist obviously and BLM stands for Black Lives Matter
[3:14:56.240 --> 3:15:04.240]  but it's very important that you understand that Antifa and BLM are just cutouts or fronts
[3:15:04.240 --> 3:15:11.680]  for the revolutionary communist party period the reason they do this is similar to the reason why
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:18.080]  corporations will create you know corporations that want to shift money around below the table
[3:15:18.080 --> 3:15:26.320]  will create a series of cutout corporations proxies shell corporations you know doing business as
[3:15:26.320 --> 3:15:33.200]  fictitious names so that it's very hard to point directly from you know an action on the street
[3:15:33.200 --> 3:15:40.240]  to the leadership of the revolutionary communist party they'll just say well Antifa there's no
[3:15:40.240 --> 3:15:46.560]  leaders of Antifa that has nothing to do with with us an actual organization you know with an
[3:15:46.560 --> 3:15:54.640]  actual leader Bob Avakian same thing with BLM they are they're the originators of BLM call
[3:15:54.640 --> 3:16:03.280]  themselves in their own words trained Marxists part of that training is in is in clandestine
[3:16:03.280 --> 3:16:11.520]  operations and using cutouts so that the overt legitimate so to speak revolutionary communist
[3:16:11.520 --> 3:16:20.240]  party can't be blamed by the federal law enforcement agencies for say a wave of arson attacks these are
[3:16:20.240 --> 3:16:27.600]  just cutouts so please any reporter now that uses the term anarchist is just admitting he's a fool
[3:16:28.240 --> 3:16:36.480]  and when you think of and refer to Antifa and BLM just remember those are masks for the revolutionary
[3:16:36.480 --> 3:16:43.200]  communist party they pick a name that you can't assail they pick a name that is impossible to
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:50.720]  criticize if you call yourself anti-fascist then how in the world can you be against them you must
[3:16:50.720 --> 3:16:57.440]  be a fascist or they call themselves black lives matter how can you be against BLM don't you think
[3:16:57.440 --> 3:17:03.840]  black lives matter this is completely predictable it's right out of the playbook it's been done
[3:17:03.840 --> 3:17:10.000]  forever you can go back to revolutionary movements through the 20th century they do the same thing
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:16.000]  whether it's in labor politics or national politics you know national separatist movements
[3:17:16.800 --> 3:17:24.080]  communists will put on whatever cloak whatever mask fits the situation that allows them to
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:30.560]  operate without criticism while hiding the actual communist basis for the organization
[3:17:30.560 --> 3:17:35.200]  and when we come back i'm going to talk about another character everybody should get to know

[3:21:14.160 --> 3:21:21.040]  before i continue i wanted to mention uh i i expect you know at any moment i'm just going
[3:21:21.040 --> 3:21:27.840]  to be deleted from social media from amazon from paypal things like that so i i recommend
[3:21:28.560 --> 3:21:37.360]  people get hard copy of some of my books so that if especially if biden wins there's going to be
[3:21:37.360 --> 3:21:44.160]  mass deletion of material that you think you own on your device it will just go poof unless your
[3:21:44.160 --> 3:21:50.880]  device is you know shielded in a safe unconnected to anything wireless when the powers that be decide
[3:21:50.880 --> 3:21:56.800]  that ideas like mine are just too dangerous to be out there they're just going to blink out they'll
[3:21:56.800 --> 3:22:02.960]  be gone from audible they'll be gone from kindle they'll be gone so get hard copy backup where you
[3:22:02.960 --> 3:22:10.240]  can and if you get them from me you don't have to give jeff bezos half of your money anyway in the
[3:22:10.240 --> 3:22:16.560]  last segment i was talking about bob avakian who is a contemporary in the students for democratic
[3:22:16.560 --> 3:22:22.960]  society which morphed into weather underground terrorists he was a contemporary colleague of
[3:22:22.960 --> 3:22:31.840]  of people like angela davis bernadette bernadine doran uh bill ares mark rudd he never went away
[3:22:32.560 --> 3:22:38.400]  for the last 40 years he's run the revolutionary communist party of the usa the way that these
[3:22:38.400 --> 3:22:46.800]  people work though is through cutouts so you'll never see bob avakian sitting right next to uh
[3:22:46.800 --> 3:22:55.520]  you know uh susan rice or bill or or uh obama or hillary clinton but their friends do you know
[3:22:55.520 --> 3:23:03.040]  avakian will sit with cornell west and then the next week cornell west is uh on pbs you know so
[3:23:03.040 --> 3:23:10.000]  this is a click and they are seeing their moment their moment is coming and bob avakian even back
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:16.240]  in the 60s was very close to the black panther party now we know that the black panther party
[3:23:17.120 --> 3:23:24.800]  and other black organizations often were semi run or infill so strongly infiltrated by the fbi
[3:23:24.800 --> 3:23:30.560]  that it's hard to know where was the black panther party the genuine black panther party
[3:23:30.560 --> 3:23:38.560]  and where where was it uh just a chimera of the fbi but there's a new a new black panther party
[3:23:38.560 --> 3:23:47.360]  arising with a new star a guy named grand master jay the world first saw him at stone mountain
[3:23:47.360 --> 3:23:54.800]  georgia on the fourth of july when he mustered his troops and it was pretty shocking at first
[3:23:54.800 --> 3:24:00.000]  because you know he was calling out the boogaloo boys and the you know the white crackers and the
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:05.840]  militias where are you we're in your house he mustered a couple hundred guys wearing
[3:24:05.840 --> 3:24:11.280]  more or less black uniforms that could more or less march carrying more or less rifles
[3:24:11.920 --> 3:24:17.600]  although um it's been pointed out many of the rifles appeared to be non-functional had no
[3:24:17.600 --> 3:24:23.680]  sites sites were on backwards uh had ammunition jammed in the chambers but that's really missing
[3:24:23.680 --> 3:24:29.680]  the point the fact that he could muster these people without notice under the radar i don't
[3:24:29.680 --> 3:24:34.480]  care if they were actors and i don't care if the if half the weapons were airsoft i would
[3:24:34.480 --> 3:24:40.720]  doubt seriously that any of the weapons were even loaded because it was a show it was it was a coming
[3:24:40.720 --> 3:24:47.360]  out kind of an audition for being a national leader well i've dug into this and the real
[3:24:47.360 --> 3:24:56.320]  name of grandmaster j he's actually not a secret his his name is john Fitzgerald johnson and he's
[3:24:56.320 --> 3:25:04.560]  been a rapper and he's been a an it guy if the information on his length in page is true he's
[3:25:04.560 --> 3:25:11.360]  got a pretty strong it background he knows his way around computer networks he's no dummy he's
[3:25:11.360 --> 3:25:17.760]  served in the military in the 90s uh not sure about his qualifications whether they're legit
[3:25:17.760 --> 3:25:22.960]  or not from what's on the photos but let's run the first clip and we'll give you a little look
[3:25:22.960 --> 3:25:32.800]  into the thinking of uh of grandmaster j and i have a direct message to the entire black
[3:25:32.800 --> 3:25:39.040]  slash african slash african the way they like to give us name but i don't care a message to the
[3:25:39.040 --> 3:25:49.600]  entire melanated family all over this planet uh master j thank you very much to all of my brothers

[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:20.560]  you don't want to kill you don't want to separate you don't want to demand what's owed to you you
[3:26:20.560 --> 3:26:29.440]  have become your own worst enemy that time must come to an end it is time now wherever you are to
[3:26:29.440 --> 3:26:35.600]  identify with your light-minded brothers and sisters stop hating on each other because it's a brain

[3:26:49.840 --> 3:26:56.000]  in our education i mean in the reclaimation of our land and i mean in the fighting of a common
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:27:02.080]  enemy if nobody will lead you i will step into that role and anyone that comes behind me must

[3:27:38.160 --> 3:27:46.400]  the spirit that dwells within you it is our time to solidify behind unity leadership it is our time
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:52.560]  to unify it is our time to learn that you're going to have to follow it is our time to know
[3:27:52.560 --> 3:28:00.960]  that we may have to kill some people to be free it is our time to separate integrate it's not
[3:28:00.960 --> 3:28:07.600]  working it is our time to demand what is owed to us and it is our time for us no longer to
[3:28:07.600 --> 3:28:14.480]  think of ourselves as our worst enemy but to think of the other man as our worst enemy i bid you
[3:28:14.480 --> 3:28:21.520]  peace i bid you shalom and i bid you that i will see you soon on your own soil and that
[3:28:21.520 --> 3:28:27.040]  is coming from grandmaster j the NFAC and on behalf of all of your brothers and sisters
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:39.840]  in the united states i say uhuru this guy is pretty serious um he's doesn't have a huge youtube
[3:28:39.840 --> 3:28:47.760]  presence on his own channel which is called the official grandmaster j uh he actually ran for president
[3:28:47.760 --> 3:28:56.240]  in 2016 as an independent under his own name which is john Fitzgerald johnson uh he's he's a pretty
[3:28:56.240 --> 3:29:04.000]  talented guy on other videos he can work without notes for any length of time uh in a in another
[3:29:04.000 --> 3:29:11.760]  video that in the same video but um further back the the host with the funny hat the african hat
[3:29:11.760 --> 3:29:17.680]  asks him about his meant to it you know his his leading figures of his life and he says i am all
[3:29:17.680 --> 3:29:24.640]  of them and he speaks about malcom x stokely car michael huy p newton those are black panthers marcus
[3:29:24.640 --> 3:29:32.800]  garvey uh qaddafi farrakhan robert mugabe of zimbabwe elijah mohammed the founder of nation of
[3:29:32.800 --> 3:29:39.600]  islam he says i am all of them he's like channeling their spirit and he is absolutely putting himself
[3:29:39.600 --> 3:29:45.120]  forward to be a national leader now when we come back i'm going to talk about what he has been
[3:29:45.120 --> 3:29:51.760]  saying about louisville kentucky with the uh brianna taylor's situation police killing there
[3:29:51.760 --> 3:29:59.600]  and he is he is um suggesting that he is going to bring his armed black militia uh to louisville
[3:29:59.600 --> 3:30:06.400]  in ten times the numbers so stone mountain you can look at as like an audition tape or an introduction
[3:30:06.400 --> 3:30:12.800]  reel he's what he's planning for is something much bigger in louisville and other places but really
[3:30:12.800 --> 3:30:20.000]  he sees himself as a national and even global black leader and before you laugh this guy is an
[3:30:20.000 --> 3:30:27.040]  orator and he is smart and there was a guy in the 1920s in germany who is an austrian corporal
[3:30:27.040 --> 3:30:33.280]  that people laughed at but he was a great orator and he went very far we're going to talk about that
[3:30:33.280 --> 3:30:40.960]  in the next section the reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown the number one
[3:30:40.960 --> 3:30:48.160]  reason is it serves every one of their purposes we've gone over those purposes many times here on
[3:30:48.160 --> 3:30:54.160]  air the casual society the surveillance system global government medical tyranny forced inoculation
[3:30:55.040 --> 3:31:01.440]  but the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are non-essential
[3:31:01.440 --> 3:31:09.840]  so as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had
[3:31:09.840 --> 3:31:16.720]  by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into it's been pre-planned
[3:31:16.720 --> 3:31:24.160]  organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax programs
[3:31:24.160 --> 3:31:30.880]  and regulations the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers
[3:31:30.880 --> 3:31:36.960]  and consolidate power this is the truest form of technocracy fascism i know what we'll do to make
[3:31:36.960 --> 3:31:42.240]  them conform to our cult we'll all tell them to wear masks or they're gonna die and then we'll
[3:31:42.240 --> 3:31:46.000]  release the pressure for a while and then bring it back and squeeze it harder and release it again
[3:31:46.000 --> 3:31:51.280]  and we'll be the virtuous and we'll be the angels even though our lord and master bill gates helped
[3:31:51.280 --> 3:32:00.560]  fund the whole COVID-19 oh no don't seduce me that's right that's the code word for bill gates's
[3:32:00.560 --> 3:32:08.480]  operation he carries out with his good little buddy dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult as you know
[3:32:08.480 --> 3:32:14.000]  for girls there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels one of
[3:32:14.000 --> 3:32:21.200]  them is the vampire the werewolf the billionaire and and who else oh that's right there's the surgeon
[3:32:21.200 --> 3:32:25.600]  and then there's one other one and it's so much fun to be ruled over by these psychotic
[3:32:25.600 --> 3:32:31.200]  psychopaths it's so good to know that there are masters and they're coming to rape us with their
[3:32:31.200 --> 3:32:46.560]  imoculations psychopaths are so hot oh yeah
[3:32:46.560 --> 3:32:51.760]  where the hell did this water come from

[3:33:52.800 --> 3:33:59.760]  but in reality it's building a post human world so that you can be made obsolete domesticated
[3:33:59.760 --> 3:34:08.640]  dumbed down drugged distracted atomized and then slowly killed this is the brave new world
[3:34:08.640 --> 3:34:15.120]  world it's the post human world it's the dreaming of the post human world the wired magazine and
[3:34:15.120 --> 3:34:19.920]  the wall street journal all tell us about it oh now they tell us our smartphones don't just
[3:34:19.920 --> 3:34:25.600]  track or remove they're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate database
[3:34:25.600 --> 3:34:32.560]  globally you see the bear trap closed on our leg now and the vampire walked out of the bushes
[3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:42.160]  and is explaining to us how we slowly gonna bleed us and destroy us you're listening to the alex
[3:34:42.160 --> 3:35:07.280]  jones show live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host matt
[3:35:07.280 --> 3:35:19.200]  brankin in the last section i was talking about uh the rising star grand master j he's a radical
[3:35:19.200 --> 3:35:27.440]  black separatist very talented from a new generation he's not young though he's born in 63 but he's a
[3:35:27.440 --> 3:35:35.040]  generation he's sort of a tweener between the uh the 60s uh still surviving leftovers like bill
[3:35:35.040 --> 3:35:42.720]  airs bob avakian angela davis he's a connection to this era so he's very fit you would think he's
[3:35:42.720 --> 3:35:49.680]  a younger guy i mean he he looks more like 40 than 56 so the dude definitely stays in shape
[3:35:49.680 --> 3:35:58.480]  and he's driven he's got a fire inside of him i mean in his own terms he is legit he is a strong
[3:35:58.480 --> 3:36:05.040]  character and people are listening to him you can mock him you can make fun of his of his uh
[3:36:05.040 --> 3:36:11.760]  jammed weapons etc but that was just a show stone mountain was a production and i would challenge
[3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:19.280]  any uh you know cracker militia type get out there with 200 of your guys in your uniforms
[3:36:19.280 --> 3:36:25.520]  anywhere anytime 200 in your uniforms can't be done can't compare that to say richmond
[3:36:25.520 --> 3:36:31.920]  or or a state capital boogaloo where it's just individuals massing this is one character
[3:36:32.800 --> 3:36:38.880]  you know the uh Fitzgerald Fitzgerald johnson who got these hundreds of people organized
[3:36:39.440 --> 3:36:44.240]  and marching and somewhat of been somewhat disciplined you know they didn't start trash
[3:36:44.240 --> 3:36:49.200]  talking to people in their cars except for himself i mean this isn't this is a unit that's
[3:36:49.200 --> 3:36:54.720]  going to have a national presence if they go to louisville like he is talking about or somewhere
[3:36:54.720 --> 3:37:00.960]  else it's going to be something to behold he's saying 10 times bigger than stone mountain
[3:37:01.600 --> 3:37:07.760]  and he's going to be in louisville kentucky which is not you know georgia it's a several
[3:37:07.760 --> 3:37:13.760]  st it's multiple states away so he's showing a national footprint and uh you know this is a
[3:37:13.760 --> 3:37:19.680]  home of a lot of uh special forces and airborne military guys a lot of pushback this time it
[3:37:19.680 --> 3:37:26.080]  won't be under the radar it'll be very known so he'll be taking a chance of some kind of a
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:31.760]  collision with the people he's been calling out the so-called boogaloo boys the crackers where are
[3:37:31.760 --> 3:37:37.680]  you you know we're in your house anyway i'd like to show another clip it had to be censored a little
[3:37:37.680 --> 3:37:42.800]  bit because he's pretty angry in this one he's talking about if you watch these whole entire
[3:37:42.800 --> 3:37:48.080]  videos and i suggest you do in this video he's talking about brianna taylor and the fact that
[3:37:48.080 --> 3:37:52.720]  the police haven't been arrested and what he's going to do about it if you can roll clip to now
[3:37:53.760 --> 3:37:56.640]  now i'm gonna say this and i'm gonna say it publicly
[3:37:58.960 --> 3:38:07.920]  if you thought what happened in stone mountain was big if i call a formation in louisville it's
[3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:15.680]  going to be 10 times as big and i'm not going to guarantee anything y'all need to need to move on
[3:38:15.680 --> 3:38:23.600]  the or we're going to move on you the next black guns formation i'm going to call is going to be
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:34.000]  in louisville and i'm going to call everybody who can carry a gun this is ridiculous you scared
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:39.680]  ass white folks don't want to fix it then you should get up from the beginning and now the black
[3:38:39.680 --> 3:38:46.960]  race is trying to send back watching y'all sit there like y'all really think we won't come up in that
[3:38:48.560 --> 3:38:52.800]  now y'all can sit there and keep talking about oh we just getting the investigation and the tapes
[3:38:52.800 --> 3:38:57.760]  okay that's fine i need the mayor to come out and hold the press conference and say look we
[3:38:57.760 --> 3:39:02.880]  fucked up and we're going to make it right and y'all you know we are we apologize to the family
[3:39:02.880 --> 3:39:10.240]  and we apologize to the tale of family and we apologize to the bra we need to see that all
[3:39:10.240 --> 3:39:14.960]  you jim bourbon biscuit or whiskey drinking should expect us to pull up in your town
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:20.480]  i'm going to be honest with you i can't hold all these back
[3:39:25.040 --> 3:39:32.000]  yeah he says you can't hold all his bras back they're getting antsy for action according to
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:39.520]  grandmaster j and i again you can mock him if you want there was a very fiery austrian corporal
[3:39:39.520 --> 3:39:45.280]  that people you know called snickle gruber and made cartoons and and humorous movies about in the
[3:39:45.280 --> 3:39:53.040]  1920s but the man's got charisma this is just a small sampling i suggest you um you know look at
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:39:58.720]  his his youtube channel he's on pinterest and other places that i'm not really that familiar with
[3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:04.880]  but the reason i bring him up he's a this tweener between the bill ares bob avakian
[3:40:05.280 --> 3:40:11.200]  weather underground terrorist generation who are sliding into the white house because they are
[3:40:11.200 --> 3:40:17.040]  very connected you know angela davis and bernadine doran and bill ares they are honored members of
[3:40:17.040 --> 3:40:23.120]  the left they're kind of kept at a distance you know because of their terrorism connections
[3:40:23.120 --> 3:40:31.600]  connections but they are their cadres are sliding into the white house they see biden as as their
[3:40:31.600 --> 3:40:38.560]  hollow shell their mouthpiece it's going to be extremely radical if this country elects biden
[3:40:38.560 --> 3:40:44.240]  oh my god and if the country country doesn't elect biden they're going to turn every city
[3:40:44.240 --> 3:40:51.680]  into portland to the greatest extent that they can now i would say this to uh grandmaster j and
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:59.360]  people like him they have been used as a cat's paw by these old white communist radicals ever
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:07.520]  since the 60s it's you know it's great for these old white communists to throw to push a black face
[3:41:07.520 --> 3:41:14.800]  out there to take the brunt you know to to get spun up to turn violent and then take the brunt
[3:41:14.800 --> 3:41:22.480]  just causing as much chaos as possible to create the correct revolutionary conditions but behind
[3:41:22.480 --> 3:41:33.040]  black lives matter and antifa is the revolutionary communist party dot us us and they are so interwoven
[3:41:33.040 --> 3:41:40.160]  with the people that have been circulating around the clinton's and the obamas for the last 40 years
[3:41:40.160 --> 3:41:48.000]  it's the same group now if the if the the pattern is followed in portland we're going to see this
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:56.320]  chaos spreading why because antifa blm radicals have no fear of of being arrested there are videos
[3:41:56.320 --> 3:42:00.480]  out of portland where people are being arrested and they're saying they're saying to the one
[3:42:00.480 --> 3:42:06.160]  being arrested what's your name don't worry we'll have you right out we'll get the nlg the nlg will
[3:42:06.160 --> 3:42:14.640]  have you out the nlg is the national lawyers guild this is a communist pro bono lawyers group
[3:42:14.640 --> 3:42:22.320]  funded by george soros so they've got unlimited money so you if you are an arsonist a terrorist
[3:42:22.320 --> 3:42:28.720]  a bomber they will bail you out this is all happening in cities that are run by by these
[3:42:28.720 --> 3:42:36.160]  communist da's also put in office by george soros who fund lavishly funded their campaigns
[3:42:36.160 --> 3:42:42.960]  like the mcloskey's found out in st louis you wind up with district attorneys that will free any
[3:42:42.960 --> 3:42:49.920]  communist and jail any american like the mcloskey's or try to indict them this is a pattern that's
[3:42:49.920 --> 3:42:56.640]  going to be continuing i recommend you seriously get out of any blue jurisdiction as soon as possible
[3:42:56.640 --> 3:43:03.520]  because it's going to hit the fan and the only thing that antifa and blm fear at this point
[3:43:03.520 --> 3:43:09.680]  is federal law enforcement but federal law enforcement itself is very split within federal
[3:43:09.680 --> 3:43:18.000]  law enforcement there are very many not enough but very many hard core tactical units actual
[3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:28.960]  street street feds dea atf even fbi the hardcore tactical units are the are the skull stompers
[3:43:28.960 --> 3:43:34.000]  they don't give a crap they came out of the military and they'll and they want to fight
[3:43:34.000 --> 3:43:39.040]  they're ready in portland they're ready to take the portland tactics elsewhere they're going to
[3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:45.440]  start making arrests but they need to to forget about these idiots throwing the molotovs that
[3:43:45.440 --> 3:43:52.160]  are just you know the cannon fodder what they've got to do is peel back the money through the
[3:43:52.160 --> 3:44:00.560]  national lawyers guild back to revcom dot us when people weigh up the chain that are hiding behind
[3:44:00.560 --> 3:44:07.760]  cutouts that are hiding behind shells you know several steps from revolutionary communist party
[3:44:07.760 --> 3:44:14.960]  dot us you know through antifa and blm to these guys on the street so-called anarchists they need
[3:44:14.960 --> 3:44:21.760]  to start making the arrests up the chain the dea especially has lots of experience at this
[3:44:21.760 --> 3:44:28.080]  in unwinding the financial connections so that they're not just arresting you know street dealers
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:35.120]  but trying to find the actual you know cartel logistics guys and then eventually the actual
[3:44:35.120 --> 3:44:40.800]  cartel bosses that's who it's going to who it's going to take being arrested to put an end to
[3:44:40.800 --> 3:44:47.520]  this there's an unlimited supply of these antifa creeps but one thing i'll say about antifa getting
[3:44:47.520 --> 3:44:54.720]  arrested and it worms my heart when these mostly white skinny punks and girls get thrown in actual
[3:44:54.720 --> 3:45:01.760]  federal penitentiary it's going to be worse than hell for them the white the white gangs the arian
[3:45:01.760 --> 3:45:07.680]  nations the biker gangs even the hispanic gangs and the black gangs are all going to hate them
[3:45:07.680 --> 3:45:14.800]  the white the white groups in prison will hate them as communists and the black gangs and hispanic
[3:45:14.800 --> 3:45:20.880]  gangs will consider them sellouts and traders they will have the worst hell ever when they go to
[3:45:20.880 --> 3:45:38.560]  prison and it can't happen soon enough
