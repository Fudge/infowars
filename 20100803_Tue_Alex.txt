[00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:11.687]  This is our land.
[00:00:11.687 --> 00:00:18.072]  These are our people.
[00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:19.993]  The workers.
[00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:21.935]  The strivers.
[00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:22.655]  The builders.
[00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:23.996]  These are our people.
[00:00:23.996 --> 00:00:24.757]  Who are they?
[00:00:31.377 --> 00:00:34.218]  They are the dark armies.
[00:00:34.218 --> 00:00:38.239]  The dark murdering armies whose only honor is atrocity.
[00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.039]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:03.302]  Welcome, my friends, welcome.
[00:01:03.302 --> 00:01:10.449]  It is August 3rd, 2010 on this live Tuesday edition.
[00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:13.612]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:21.359]  Dr. Russell Blaylock, top brain surgeon, neurologist, will be joining us coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.722]  And it's a perfect day to have him on because
[00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:42.917]  I have had a very serious epiphany or awakening in the last 48 hours, just a further understanding of how right we've been all along in our analysis and reverse engineering of the scientific dictatorship.
[00:01:44.653 --> 00:01:50.915]  There is now a complete coming out by the bioethicist, by the eugenicist.
[00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:53.917]  They're openly announcing global one-child policies.
[00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:57.638]  They're openly admitting they plan to sterilize the population.
[00:01:57.638 --> 00:02:01.380]  They're openly announcing forced inoculations.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.181]  And they shouldn't even be called inoculations.
[00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:09.203]  They are genetic re-engineering compounds.
[00:02:10.183 --> 00:02:24.806]  Live viruses that attack the brain, and that's just one family of these, and the Pentagon is announcing they are going to inject the troops with these as if they're unwitting guinea pigs.
[00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:27.286]  This is so incredible.
[00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:36.648]  The New York Times, Time Magazine, the British Journal of Psychiatry, the Huffington Post, Wired Magazine,
[00:02:38.484 --> 00:02:52.708]  And countless other publications in the last week have simultaneously come out with straight faces and said, we're going to inject you with live viruses to where you won't be depressed anymore.
[00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:57.009]  And they say it cognitively enhances you.
[00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.669]  They say lithium in the water will cognitively enhance you.
[00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:05.791]  It lowers IQ, is toxic, makes you servile, it's an antipsychotic, very toxic metal.
[00:03:06.872 --> 00:03:14.734]  But they call that cognitive enhancement, just like the national CBS news pieces about how mercury cognitively enhances children.
[00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:25.316]  So with a straight face, they're coming out and saying, we're going to forcibly drug your water and forcibly inject you with live genetically altered viruses.
[00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:35.038]  And this one particular article out of the Mail newspaper, it reports, and Stanford Research Institute's behind it and others, and the Pentagon's funding it,
[00:03:36.323 --> 00:03:46.046]  A virus that goes in and goes into the receptor sites for anger and for determination, basically self-preservation.
[00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:48.926]  It admits this and wipes them out.
[00:03:48.926 --> 00:03:59.489]  The viruses literally replicate and destroy or eat these nerve endings in your neurons.
[00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.830]  And they're just reporting it totally calmly.
[00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:06.062]  And they're reporting, we are going to drug your water supply.
[00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:07.244]  Now here's the news flash.
[00:04:07.244 --> 00:04:09.467]  They're already drugging the water supply.
[00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:16.159]  They're already genetically engineering crops in every major study to reduce fertility and cause organ failure and cancer.
[00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:35.054]  They picked of thousands of plastic formulas in the last 50 years, bisphenol A to wrap all of your foods, to contain all of your liquids, juice, milk, baby formula, that annihilates the normal genetic operations.
[00:04:35.054 --> 00:04:37.916]  This is all admitted.
[00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:38.897]  What's incredible is,
[00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:42.417]  We've got evidence they're already adding this to vaccines.
[00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:50.665]  Much of the public can't get upset and can't motivate themselves for self-preservation because they've already been lobotomized.
[00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:53.068]  Yes, this is really going on.
[00:04:53.068 --> 00:04:53.208]  It's 100%.
[00:04:55.188 --> 00:04:58.831]  And they're coming to try to forcibly inject you, but it gets worse.
[00:04:58.831 --> 00:04:59.412]  It gets worse.
[00:04:59.412 --> 00:05:01.093]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:05.177]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[00:06:52.682 --> 00:06:53.202]  Thank you!
[00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.793]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.793 --> 00:07:05.714]  Number 1.
[00:07:05.714 --> 00:07:09.136]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:09.136 --> 00:07:09.997]  Number 2.
[00:07:09.997 --> 00:07:14.880]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.620]  It's true.
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.504]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:20.504 --> 00:07:21.324]  Number 3.
[00:07:21.324 --> 00:07:24.906]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.906 --> 00:07:28.609]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:29.609]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.609 --> 00:07:32.370]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.052]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:36.052 --> 00:07:36.832]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.832 --> 00:07:40.994]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:46.036]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:46.036 --> 00:07:50.217]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.217 --> 00:07:51.998]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.998 --> 00:07:56.600]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:05.385]  877-327-0365.
[00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:11.409]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:13.951]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:17.059 --> 00:08:25.968]  We are live, my friends, Dr. Russell Blaylock, top brain surgeon and expert on the ongoing eugenics soft kill operations against humanity.
[00:08:25.968 --> 00:08:31.253]  He's going to be joining us later in the broadcast today.
[00:08:31.253 --> 00:08:38.460]  Now, 10 years ago, I began to read Pentagon documents, mainstream news reports, medical patents.
[00:08:39.414 --> 00:08:41.915]  For a new type of vaccines.
[00:08:41.915 --> 00:08:45.937]  Now they're playing on the public's ignorance when they call them vaccines.
[00:08:45.937 --> 00:09:01.763]  They are genetic re-engineering systems and most of the government funding and research with the private universities and biotech firms is openly to re-engineer the brain.
[00:09:02.901 --> 00:09:07.245]  Now, they use that term, they call it a cognitive enhancement.
[00:09:07.245 --> 00:09:14.612]  A hundred years ago, the first lobotomies were done in front of psychiatric medical schools with an ice pick.
[00:09:14.612 --> 00:09:17.594]  If you don't believe me, just look up the history of lobotomy.
[00:09:17.594 --> 00:09:26.523]  And they would take mental patients and stick an ice pick in in front of everyone and eviscerate the frontal lobes, the cerebral cortex.
[00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:36.013]  This is a psychopathic control freak guild that is fully converting regular Western medicine.
[00:09:36.013 --> 00:09:45.120]  And this is what government run healthcare in England and the US is now announcing that you will be given vaccines for your depression.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:52.485]  And in these mainstream media reports from the Mail, from Wired Magazine, the New York Times, there's literally hundreds of them.
[00:09:52.485 --> 00:09:55.988]  They're simultaneously coming out and promoting it as if it's a good thing.
[00:09:58.522 --> 00:10:13.389]  In one of the cases covered in the mail, it is a genetically engineered herpes virus, very communicable, that they inject into you and it goes into the brain and targets endorphin receptor sites.
[00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:19.412]  And they say here in this article, jabs that could put a stop to stress without slowing us down.
[00:10:19.412 --> 00:10:21.813]  And it says it goes in and re-engineers the neurons.
[00:10:21.813 --> 00:10:27.236]  When you actually read the patents on this entire class, we're gonna have a top brain surgeon on to talk about this in a little while,
[00:10:28.581 --> 00:10:42.853]  The viruses go in and replicate and they're designed, unlike herpes, to attack the lips, the mucous membrane, or the genitals, to attack specific neuron receptor sites and destroy them.
[00:10:42.853 --> 00:10:48.278]  Other classes of these create viral plaques that block the receptor sites.
[00:10:48.278 --> 00:10:50.140]  These are the terms they use.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.521]  Let me explain.
[00:10:51.521 --> 00:10:54.964]  They are now proposing mandatory injections for all
[00:10:57.372 --> 00:10:59.293]  And you're not gonna feel any more pain.
[00:10:59.293 --> 00:11:00.935]  It's like the body snatchers.
[00:11:00.935 --> 00:11:04.637]  You just go to sleep, and when you wake up, everything's gonna be all right.
[00:11:04.637 --> 00:11:05.638]  That's actually what happens.
[00:11:05.638 --> 00:11:15.165]  You take the injection, you have a fever, you have brain swelling, and then you are unable to be threatened.
[00:11:15.165 --> 00:11:17.487]  You are unable to become upset.
[00:11:17.487 --> 00:11:19.528]  You're unable to have stress.
[00:11:19.528 --> 00:11:26.013]  This is biological conversion from the humans we've been for millions of years in our development,
[00:11:26.926 --> 00:11:28.207]  Into something new.
[00:11:28.207 --> 00:11:36.931]  They're not just re-engineering salmon to be twice as big and the major studies that universities have done show that it will extinct natural salmon in the wild.
[00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:40.233]  And the salmon has had insect genes added.
[00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:43.955]  It's a chimera cross-species cross-clone.
[00:11:43.955 --> 00:11:49.298]  They're not just putting different genes of animals and plants into corn or into cotton.
[00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:59.556]  This is humanity being taken over by a scientific dictatorship, a medical tyranny.
[00:11:59.556 --> 00:12:08.503]  And they're doing this so you can't mount a defense against the next wave of dehumanization that will be hard kill weapons that just kill you outright.
[00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:19.913]  We have clear evidence that RNA strains, very similar to these classes of re-engineering bioweapons, are being added to vaccines.
[00:12:19.913 --> 00:12:26.395]  The UN's been caught adding hormones to vaccines to cause an autoimmune response to the hormone to cause sterilization of women.
[00:12:26.395 --> 00:12:27.755]  That's mainstream news.
[00:12:27.755 --> 00:12:33.657]  CBS AP report from Asia to Latin America to Africa and Central Asia.
[00:12:34.857 --> 00:12:42.802]  In the last five years, everywhere the UN gives the polio shots or the oral polio, the children get weaponized polio and die in mass.
[00:12:42.802 --> 00:12:48.866]  And the articles even admit, oh, oopsie, there's a mistake, it was super polio.
[00:12:48.866 --> 00:12:52.788]  And so they've just been testing, killing you out in the open.
[00:12:52.788 --> 00:13:00.653]  Just like they're testing, Bloomberg reporting, every major insurance company, when people die or troops die, they just keep the insurance money from the widow of the family.
[00:13:01.963 --> 00:13:09.709]  Or Goldman Sachs steals hundreds of billions of dollars and is given even more power over the economy with this new private board.
[00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:12.912]  And the SEC cannot be investigated by Congress.
[00:13:12.912 --> 00:13:15.293]  Congress passed a law saying that.
[00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:18.496]  It's just all in your face.
[00:13:18.496 --> 00:13:24.881]  And the magnitude of this... I could hardly even sleep last night.
[00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:27.283]  And you're like, Alex, you've been talking about this for at least a decade.
[00:13:27.283 --> 00:13:31.266]  I know, but now they're having the full rollout.
[00:13:32.339 --> 00:13:53.194]  And they're going to give people vaccines that lobotomize them incrementally so that it's kind of a background scatter ambient system where they just slowly increase it and then gauge if we're noticing and gauge of the medical people who are highly compartmentalized and believe they're good and don't know what these vaccines are really doing.
[00:13:53.194 --> 00:13:55.376]  And psychiatry, all the major journals,
[00:13:56.385 --> 00:14:05.412]  New York Times reporting on it, the American Psychiatric Association, the British Psychiatric Association, it's all these articles say this will replace drugs.
[00:14:05.412 --> 00:14:11.737]  You get one shot, you never have anxiety, you never get angry, you're not threatened.
[00:14:11.737 --> 00:14:19.282]  What did Scientific American and other publications, and people won't believe this so pull it up on screen, have the headlines two weeks ago?
[00:14:19.282 --> 00:14:22.305]  Shrimp committing suicide, shrimp becoming reckless.
[00:14:24.192 --> 00:14:25.713]  What does it show Prozac does?
[00:14:25.713 --> 00:14:29.837]  It makes you reckless where you'll go shoot a whole school full of people or you'll commit suicide.
[00:14:29.837 --> 00:14:32.860]  It kills your inhibition and makes sure we're not threatened.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:38.285]  They've done studies with Prozac or serotonin reuptake inhibitor users and cars.
[00:14:38.285 --> 00:14:40.127]  They'll just pull right out in front of you.
[00:14:42.318 --> 00:14:45.481]  They've had their inhibitions taken away.
[00:14:45.481 --> 00:14:48.264]  Sodium fluoride in all the major studies does the same thing.
[00:14:48.264 --> 00:14:52.928]  It's all about destroying your drive for self-preservation.
[00:14:52.928 --> 00:15:01.956]  Now, I want to just go over some of these articles and I want the guys to give us a document cam shot for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers so that they understand that this can all be pulled up.
[00:15:01.956 --> 00:15:03.118]  This is not my opinion.
[00:15:04.048 --> 00:15:21.522]  And remember, they're promoting and they're pushing in the media the hundreds of new vaccines that are really recombinant RNA virus systems that attack the brain and they're telling you it's cognitive enhancement.
[00:15:21.522 --> 00:15:24.964]  They want to make all of this mandatory.
[00:15:24.964 --> 00:15:30.769]  This on top of top Oxford bioethicists, they're the ones that write the codes and the ethics for the doctors.
[00:15:31.903 --> 00:15:34.428]  They're the ones in the last 20 years that have gotten rid of the Hippocratic Oath.
[00:15:34.428 --> 00:15:36.613]  They're the high priest over the medical system.
[00:15:37.861 --> 00:15:43.164]  Top bioethicist in the US, top bioethicist in England, New York Times, everybody reporting.
[00:15:43.164 --> 00:15:51.388]  I mean, literally, I did a search on this last night, hundreds of articles telling you, hey, your problems are solved, we're gonna put lithium in the water.
[00:15:51.388 --> 00:15:57.551]  And then you do tests of what's already being added under the name sodium fluoride, it's hundreds of chemicals, including lithium.
[00:15:57.551 --> 00:16:03.975]  See, we've been exposing them, and so now they're just coming out and saying, yeah, yeah, we're putting lithium in your water, and it's good.
[00:16:06.394 --> 00:16:09.755]  And, in the next two hours, I shot this video last night.
[00:16:09.755 --> 00:16:12.796]  Rob Dude is so concerned because he's seen all the documents.
[00:16:12.796 --> 00:16:15.017]  He volunteered to stay up all night.
[00:16:15.017 --> 00:16:16.518]  He hasn't left.
[00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.398]  He won't be done for about another hour.
[00:16:18.398 --> 00:16:26.341]  It's going to go up on YouTube, a special video titled, Media Pushes Brain-Eating Vaccines.
[00:16:26.341 --> 00:16:28.422]  Because that's what it is, in layman's terms.
[00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:31.403]  And it's a catchy term that will get the word out to everybody.
[00:16:32.216 --> 00:16:33.697]  And then it goes over all of this.
[00:16:33.697 --> 00:16:37.478]  Media promoting brain-eating vaccines.
[00:16:37.478 --> 00:16:41.279]  Media pushing brain-eating vaccines.
[00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:46.461]  And it goes through all of this in a detailed, focused fashion.
[00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:47.542]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:16:47.542 --> 00:16:52.943]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a normal response to become upset and agitated.
[00:16:52.943 --> 00:16:59.566]  You have that genetically in your code to defend your tribe, to defend your people, to be successful.
[00:17:00.734 --> 00:17:21.347]  And I just look at my darling little daughters and my son and their hearts are so full of goodness and they're so loving and they just have the light of creativity and the spirit of the universe in their eyes and I think about how the globalists openly want a genetic dictatorship where they literally reprogram your brain destructively.
[00:17:23.078 --> 00:17:25.339]  And they're pushing this.
[00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.861]  It's worse than a science fiction nightmare movie.
[00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:35.825]  Imagine a science fiction movie 10, 15 years ago where a secret government corporate program to incrementally lobotomize the public to make them servile.
[00:17:35.825 --> 00:17:36.966]  The chemicals aren't enough.
[00:17:36.966 --> 00:17:39.327]  We're a resilient, powerful species.
[00:17:39.327 --> 00:17:43.429]  Just like insects that get poisoned over and over again become resistant.
[00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:44.630]  We're becoming resistant.
[00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.971]  And the globalists even talk about that.
[00:17:46.971 --> 00:17:49.392]  How we're becoming resistant to all their poisons.
[00:17:49.392 --> 00:17:51.013]  So they want to irrevocably go in
[00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:53.421]  I think?
[00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.271]  I'm not calling for violence, but they are being violent towards us.
[00:18:13.271 --> 00:18:30.677]  They are attacking us with a creeping stealth kill system that's very hard to respond to because we're genetically designed to face a full frontal assault of a saber-toothed cat or a grizzly bear or a pack of wolves or another tribe of humans trying to enslave us.
[00:18:30.677 --> 00:18:33.858]  Everything, you know, we're based around that and so it's very
[00:18:35.708 --> 00:18:41.550]  The enemy comes at us through stealth and through incrementalism and always sells it as if it's a good thing.
[00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:47.351]  When you watch these doctors and psychiatrists and bioethicists on television, they can't help but smirk and start laughing.
[00:18:47.351 --> 00:18:55.174]  It's like when Bill Gates on TED TV a few months ago said, yeah, we've got to cut carbon footprint and humans exhale carbon, so we've got to reduce that down.
[00:18:55.174 --> 00:19:00.275]  And he put the number zero up and everybody laughed because they're part of the little inside group laughing at
[00:19:00.715 --> 00:19:10.082]  At the control freak nerve of power they're pressing on and their petty psyches of thinking about how they're in on the club of soft killing people.
[00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:13.765]  I mean, they are out in the open.
[00:19:13.765 --> 00:19:27.015]  And at a primitive level, at my basic core life preservation encoding, extreme violence rises up in me when I focus on this.
[00:19:27.015 --> 00:19:28.977]  I mean, I'm seething right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:30.083 --> 00:19:37.925]  And that's a normal response, and when you read these documents, this is the exact propulsion system they want to remove.
[00:19:37.925 --> 00:19:42.386]  I mean, how do you think I can work up here many nights till midnight?
[00:19:42.386 --> 00:19:52.508]  Because I've got that drive to preserve the species, and it may in the long run hurt me physically, and they talk about that's how they're altruistically going to knock this out of us, but it doesn't matter.
[00:19:52.508 --> 00:19:54.168]  It's for the species I'm doing this.
[00:19:57.247 --> 00:19:58.268]  We're going to be right back, okay?
[00:19:58.268 --> 00:19:59.409]  I'm going to try to go over all this.
[00:19:59.409 --> 00:20:01.890]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.372]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:20:04.372 --> 00:20:10.016]  Did you know that it doesn't matter which political party occupies the White House?
[00:20:10.016 --> 00:20:16.260]  They have both been captured by those who are working for world government and the destruction of our Constitution.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:25.507]  They believe that governments formed in the 18th and 19th centuries based upon constitutional rights of the people are now obsolete and need to be changed.
[00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:30.068]  That change will be to communism, socialism, fascism.
[00:20:30.068 --> 00:20:33.909]  A form of government that takes away all our rights.
[00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:42.790]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and offer you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.271]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:20:50.854 --> 00:20:51.254]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:20:51.254 --> 00:20:57.498]  Call now while operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:11.618]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:21:11.618 --> 00:21:18.041]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:26.905]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:36.477]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:21:36.477 --> 00:21:41.464]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:21:41.464 --> 00:21:42.886]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:45.369]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:48.971]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:53.153]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[00:21:53.153 --> 00:21:54.034]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.034 --> 00:21:54.414]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.704 --> 00:22:06.668]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:22:06.668 --> 00:22:07.668]  What have we got?
[00:22:07.668 --> 00:22:10.110]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.131]  A republic.
[00:22:11.131 --> 00:22:13.773]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:22:13.773 --> 00:22:16.035]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:22:16.035 --> 00:22:18.056]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:22:18.056 --> 00:22:19.737]  So they think they own our land?
[00:22:19.737 --> 00:22:21.058]  They think they own our water?
[00:22:21.058 --> 00:22:21.679]  Children?
[00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:22.800]  Our education?
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.620]  Our money?
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.283]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:22:27.643 --> 00:22:32.609]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:22:32.609 --> 00:22:33.630]  We have the facts.
[00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:34.791]  We have the Constitution.
[00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:35.693]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:22:35.693 --> 00:22:36.594]  We have common law.
[00:22:36.594 --> 00:22:39.117]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:39.117 --> 00:22:42.881]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:22:43.001 --> 00:22:47.948]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:22:47.948 --> 00:22:49.449]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:22:49.449 --> 00:22:50.531]  Don't tread on me.
[00:22:50.531 --> 00:22:57.400]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:23:01.664 --> 00:23:11.189]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[00:23:11.189 --> 00:23:12.510]  My name is Crystal.
[00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:15.432]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:23:15.432 --> 00:23:19.414]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[00:23:19.414 --> 00:23:23.376]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:23:23.536 --> 00:23:24.377]  What did Crystal do?
[00:23:24.377 --> 00:23:28.342]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[00:23:28.342 --> 00:23:34.749]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[00:23:34.749 --> 00:23:38.313]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[00:24:08.737 --> 00:24:09.978]  So I want to be clear.
[00:24:09.978 --> 00:24:13.500]  They've been drugging our water and our food for more than 50 years.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.582]  They're intensifying it, now that we've been exposing them.
[00:24:17.582 --> 00:24:21.625]  And a lot of even mainstream news has been being critical of it.
[00:24:21.625 --> 00:24:25.927]  And it's coming out that there's sterilants in the plastics by design.
[00:24:25.927 --> 00:24:29.149]  The system's coming out and saying, yeah, we're doing this for your own good.
[00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:32.091]  Lithium in the water, sterilants in the vaccines.
[00:24:33.686 --> 00:24:42.850]  In fact, in this Wired Magazine article today, Army's vaccine plan inject troops with gas-propelled electrocharged DNA.
[00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:48.993]  And it says, hundreds of vaccines to re-engineer the bodies and brains of troops.
[00:24:48.993 --> 00:24:53.835]  And it says, well, old vaccines have been causing sterility.
[00:24:53.835 --> 00:24:57.577]  They actually have a quote on the second page.
[00:24:58.797 --> 00:24:59.137]  I think?
[00:25:15.629 --> 00:25:33.965]  While they destroy the economy, while they rob us all blind, while they militarize the police, while they hire millions of private spies with the highest level security clearances to surveil everyone, all now admitted, legislation to secretly arrest and torture citizens at will, violent belligerence act.
[00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:35.746]  It's just all off the charts.
[00:25:35.746 --> 00:25:40.891]  And they do it with a loving, sweet, kind, good voice.
[00:25:40.891 --> 00:25:42.112]  As if it's their right
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:48.344]  To come out and say, we've got a new vaccine so you won't get upset anymore.
[00:25:48.344 --> 00:25:52.368]  And they say in these articles, the scientists say, everyone is mentally ill.
[00:25:52.368 --> 00:25:54.149]  Everyone's getting upset too much.
[00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:55.591]  Everyone's too stressed.
[00:25:55.591 --> 00:25:57.793]  So, we're gonna put lithium in your water.
[00:25:57.793 --> 00:26:05.940]  I mean, we've gone from me here reading you government documents and textbooks where the White House Science Czar talks about it,
[00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.352]  And people say, oh, well, he wrote that 25 years ago.
[00:26:09.352 --> 00:26:12.534]  We've got a new article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:12.534 --> 00:26:21.641]  In 2006, White House science czar talked about population reduction and carbon tax to shut down human activity.
[00:26:21.641 --> 00:26:23.122]  That's all any of them talk about.
[00:26:23.122 --> 00:26:27.245]  You know, the media's like, well, he wrote that 25 years ago.
[00:26:27.245 --> 00:26:27.945]  Really?
[00:26:27.945 --> 00:26:30.027]  He wrote about it in 2006.
[00:26:30.027 --> 00:26:31.648]  I've got books he co-authored in 1999 saying it.
[00:26:34.363 --> 00:26:35.444]  They all talk about it.
[00:26:35.444 --> 00:26:36.885]  It's all they talk about.
[00:26:36.885 --> 00:26:38.666]  Do you understand?
[00:26:38.666 --> 00:26:51.095]  I know it sounds crazy to say they want to inject you with live DNA viruses that use RNA to reprogram your DNA and kill your brain cells.
[00:26:51.095 --> 00:26:53.017]  You're supposed to get angry at tyranny.
[00:26:53.017 --> 00:26:55.239]  You're supposed to get angry at Goldman Sachs.
[00:26:55.239 --> 00:26:59.202]  It's what motivates you to set bushfires in the minds of men and women.
[00:26:59.202 --> 00:27:03.225]  What was Thomas Jefferson talking about lighting bushfires in the minds of men?
[00:27:04.062 --> 00:27:10.546]  Bush fires, the fire of anger and focus and commitment.
[00:27:10.546 --> 00:27:22.993]  And everything they do, the fluoride, the Prozac, the plastics, it all has the multi-pronged use of sterilizing or reducing fertility bare minimum and making you servile.
[00:27:22.993 --> 00:27:25.555]  And now they say, we want to make you servile.
[00:27:25.555 --> 00:27:28.557]  It's an enhancement, deadly toxic lithium.
[00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:39.597]  Deadly live viruses, one of them a re-engineered, cloned herpes virus.
[00:27:39.597 --> 00:27:41.038]  Go read it!
[00:27:41.038 --> 00:27:50.625]  And it's got links to the British Psychiatric Association saying this will replace all medicine, this will replace drugs, they're gonna cocktail it all together.
[00:27:50.625 --> 00:27:55.249]  And you sit here and you see this and you know this and it's just
[00:27:57.145 --> 00:28:04.608]  Unspeakable how they say it's their right to do this to you because they're the nanny state and it's good for you.
[00:28:04.608 --> 00:28:06.989]  And mercury is a cognitive enhancer.
[00:28:06.989 --> 00:28:18.494]  Now, I mean, they actually think you're so stupid that they come out and tell you this and they show a woman rolling up her sleeve for the test and they say, and rats, the rats stopped fighting.
[00:28:18.494 --> 00:28:22.876]  The rats stopped being agitated when there wasn't any food for them to eat.
[00:28:22.876 --> 00:28:24.677]  They just went over and starved to death.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.805]  They want to inject you with something where you just lay down and die.
[00:28:30.805 --> 00:28:32.547]  And what did it show the shrimp do?
[00:28:32.547 --> 00:28:34.529]  Shrimp normally hide out in dark areas.
[00:28:34.529 --> 00:28:36.411]  Now they just swim right up to birds.
[00:28:36.411 --> 00:28:38.113]  Right up to turtles.
[00:28:38.113 --> 00:28:40.716]  Right up to other fish and get eaten.
[00:28:40.716 --> 00:28:42.538]  Headline!
[00:28:42.538 --> 00:28:45.081]  Prozac pollution making shrimp reckless.
[00:28:45.081 --> 00:28:46.443]  National Geographic News.
[00:28:48.353 --> 00:28:49.534]  You can pull up another one.
[00:28:49.534 --> 00:28:51.435]  Prozac making you commit suicide.
[00:28:51.435 --> 00:28:57.039]  There's so much Prozac in the water from sewage runoff and what they're adding, because they go, it's strange.
[00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:00.601]  It's not the exact variant of Luvox or Prozac.
[00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:07.346]  It's the base chlorine-fluoride combination that it's based on.
[00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:09.167]  We don't know why so much is in the water.
[00:29:09.167 --> 00:29:11.809]  The stinking stuff is being added.
[00:29:11.809 --> 00:29:13.210]  They're all fluoride-based.
[00:29:15.225 --> 00:29:22.147]  And the shrimp, with all those rivers coming into the Gulf of Mexico, are being wiped out in mass, because they don't care anymore.
[00:29:22.147 --> 00:29:24.028]  They don't see threats anymore.
[00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:28.570]  And that's what all of this does.
[00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.650]  You are living in a science fiction nightmare.
[00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.111]  The question is, can we make this the main issue?
[00:29:33.111 --> 00:29:38.033]  Not Lindsay Lohan, not Mel Gibson, not even things like open borders.
[00:29:38.033 --> 00:29:40.974]  That's important, but nothing compared to this medical tyranny.
[00:29:42.008 --> 00:29:46.411]  We'll continue covering this information on the other side.
[00:29:46.411 --> 00:29:51.694]  They are now deploying these systems publicly.
[00:29:51.694 --> 00:29:53.095]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.095 --> 00:29:55.637]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.637 --> 00:29:58.319]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.536 --> 00:30:04.357]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[00:30:04.357 --> 00:30:09.680]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.461]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.
[00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:16.123]  Remember the terrible conditions of those that didn't get out for Katrina.
[00:30:16.123 --> 00:30:22.145]  Go right now to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633 for information on the new evacuation pack.
[00:30:26.327 --> 00:30:31.772]  It contains two weeks of delicious easy-to-fix food along with the equipment to prepare it.
[00:30:31.772 --> 00:30:34.855]  It's packed in a rugged heavy-duty tote for transport.
[00:30:34.855 --> 00:30:39.260]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:44.585]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms must be escaped.
[00:30:44.585 --> 00:30:48.148]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disasters.
[00:30:48.408 --> 00:30:53.496]  At least prepare yourself with this two-week evacuation pack from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:53.496 --> 00:30:53.817]  Call 800-409-5633.

[00:31:05.089 --> 00:31:06.350]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:10.273]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:10.273 --> 00:31:12.674]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:12.674 --> 00:31:18.378]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:18.378 --> 00:31:25.062]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:25.062 --> 00:31:31.046]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:31.046 --> 00:31:34.729]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:31:35.189 --> 00:31:39.491]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:45.435]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:45.435 --> 00:31:48.996]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.996 --> 00:31:50.958]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.958 --> 00:31:52.078]  It's here.

[00:32:02.571 --> 00:32:06.552]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:06.552 --> 00:32:15.394]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:15.394 --> 00:32:20.035]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:20.035 --> 00:32:30.837]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:31.477 --> 00:32:40.999]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:40.999 --> 00:32:46.421]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:46.421 --> 00:32:53.902]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:53.902 --> 00:32:56.663]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.080]  Big Brother.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.741]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:07.741 --> 00:33:09.142]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:09.142 --> 00:33:10.382]  You want answers?
[00:33:10.382 --> 00:33:12.463]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:12.463 --> 00:33:16.365]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:32.685]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:33:32.685 --> 00:33:52.823]  After Dr. Blaylock leaves us in an hour, I will get back into the New York Times, Time Magazine, The Mail, and other publications, including Wired, promoting huge classes of viruses that are live that go in and literally destroy receptor sites in the brain for, quote, fear and stress hormones.
[00:33:54.090 --> 00:34:00.134]  Now, I'm reading directly from the National Institutes of Health, Stanford Research, the Pentagon.
[00:34:00.134 --> 00:34:05.237]  They are saying they're going to deploy this in the troops.
[00:34:05.237 --> 00:34:08.379]  And I was talking to Dr. Blaylock, and he said, well, I've got to research that more.
[00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:09.499]  I've seen some of that.
[00:34:09.499 --> 00:34:15.623]  But he said, Dean Coots wrote a book about that, bestselling author called Fear Nothing about it.
[00:34:15.623 --> 00:34:16.644]  So I'll ask him about that.
[00:34:16.644 --> 00:34:21.346]  It seems like what we see in popular culture and fiction is becoming reality.
[00:34:21.346 --> 00:34:23.168]  But I've seen this information for 10 years.
[00:34:24.128 --> 00:34:35.651]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is a board-certified neurosurgeon, that's brain surgeon, author, and lecturer, and he's worked with and helped develop some of the most popularly used procedures in brain surgery.
[00:34:35.651 --> 00:34:39.452]  I mean, his bio just goes on and on.
[00:34:39.452 --> 00:34:50.976]  We'll give you his websites so you can do more research on it, but he's covered how aspartame, MSG, bisphenol A, and all these things that are in the food and packaging the food are wreaking havoc.
[00:34:51.856 --> 00:35:00.498]  And he was, of course, with us last year, pointing out that this was a dangerous H1N1 vaccine for the flu, that it had serious adverse health effects.
[00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:02.919]  Now, the British Medical Journal has admitted that.
[00:35:02.919 --> 00:35:07.079]  I had the editor on a few months ago, that it was all a fraud.
[00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:11.420]  Payoffs to the government officials to make tens of billions of dollars.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:17.802]  We had Wolfgang Wudarg, the medical doctor on, who headed up the EU Commission, that found it was a dangerous fraud.
[00:35:18.742 --> 00:35:38.533]  And of course now I have the London Telegraph yesterday admitting a tenfold increase in under five-year-olds having serious convulsions from an autoimmune brain inflammation with the H1N1 and they're suspending the shots this year of flu shots for under fives.
[00:35:38.533 --> 00:35:41.375]  So again Dr. Blaylock got attacked in the media
[00:35:41.875 --> 00:35:46.857]  Last year for talking about this, completely vindicated in spades.
[00:35:46.857 --> 00:35:49.617]  And so we'll talk about all of this with him.
[00:35:49.617 --> 00:36:00.561]  But the main reason he agreed to come on, a very busy person, we appreciate his time, is we now have New York Times, Wired Magazine, all these mainstream publications.
[00:36:00.561 --> 00:36:03.622]  We have these articles up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:05.083 --> 00:36:17.689]  Promoting, putting lithium in the water, whether we like it or not, so we quote, don't commit suicide, because their studies show that Texas towns that have it naturally occurring have lower crime rates.
[00:36:17.689 --> 00:36:22.252]  So, they're now just going right to full social control.
[00:36:22.252 --> 00:36:24.493]  This is not a science fiction movie.
[00:36:24.493 --> 00:36:25.673]  This is going on.
[00:36:25.673 --> 00:36:27.974]  Top British bioethicist at Oxford.
[00:36:27.974 --> 00:36:30.656]  Top US bioethicist.
[00:36:30.656 --> 00:36:32.277]  And the New York Times and others are saying,
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:33.560]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:36:58.553 --> 00:37:01.054]  I tell you, they're really coming out of the closet with all of this.
[00:37:01.054 --> 00:37:08.677]  I mean, you were reading it decades ago in medical research journals and talked about it, and now they're just coming out with it.
[00:37:08.677 --> 00:37:15.340]  Well, yeah, this has been a dream of these people for a long time, is to remake humanity.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:26.424]  You know, if you look back at some of the early writing, and as I quoted, I think, on one of your programs about Dr. Lilly's book on the history of molecular biology,
[00:37:27.116 --> 00:37:44.412]  He talks about how in the early days, the Rockefellers were obsessed with remaking humanity, changing their biological structure, in the beginning by eugenics, but later they realized that DNA manipulation is a better method.
[00:37:44.412 --> 00:37:53.720]  And that he funded the tremendous growth of the biological program throughout the United States, and some of our major institutions.
[00:37:54.488 --> 00:38:16.115]  With that goal in mind, and now we're seeing this come to fruition, where they're seriously and openly talking about, well, we need to make it where we can remove fear from soldiers so that they'll be able to fight better in war, which means they're going to be more likely to die if they don't have a protective fear impulse.
[00:38:16.115 --> 00:38:23.017]  Remove stress, so all of us sort of apathetic and willing to accept whatever we're told.
[00:38:23.846 --> 00:38:31.228]  I mean, they're really into some serious things here, and their biology is teaching them how to do it.
[00:38:31.228 --> 00:38:38.030]  And we're finding you can manipulate the brain and remake a person's whole neurological makeup.
[00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:51.834]  Well, some years ago, there was a book written about biological control of the mind, which states that the last refuge of your individuality is your own mind.
[00:38:52.628 --> 00:39:00.692]  Well, now they want to attack that last rescue system assault on us, so that you cannot think what you want to think.
[00:39:00.692 --> 00:39:06.775]  You cannot have your own mind, your own private thoughts.
[00:39:06.775 --> 00:39:08.696]  They're going to control them.
[00:39:08.696 --> 00:39:10.076]  And this is serious business.
[00:39:10.076 --> 00:39:17.680]  They're seriously talking about this, and they're so excited about it, they don't really care that anyone knows.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.982]  And I found it interesting, you know, in this article that was in Huffington about the
[00:39:23.835 --> 00:39:46.569]  That's right, we've got a George Soros funded publication in the New York Times that they quote says the same thing, that you're a kook if you don't want the government, and see they psychologically put it back on us,
[00:39:47.449 --> 00:39:49.390]  Well, which is just asinine.
[00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:54.413]  I mean, imagine if your neighbor showed up at your house and said, I want to put lithium in your water to make you servile.
[00:39:54.413 --> 00:39:56.415]  You'd say, get out of here, crazy man.
[00:39:56.415 --> 00:39:58.996]  But the government and the media is pushing it.
[00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:06.161]  And then they preemptively say, first, we were kooks for saying this was their plan because we were reading their own textbooks and documents.
[00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:14.766]  Now, as they roll it out publicly, they preemptively say, you're crazy if you don't let us drug the water with a toxic anti-psychotic.
[00:40:15.486 --> 00:40:16.127]  Exactly.
[00:40:16.127 --> 00:40:18.269]  That's exactly the stage they went through.
[00:40:18.269 --> 00:40:23.493]  At first they deny it, say you're crazy for even saying they wanted to think about it.
[00:40:23.493 --> 00:40:29.299]  Now that they're admitting they were planning this all along, you're crazy to resist it.
[00:40:29.299 --> 00:40:39.588]  Now, it's interesting, the whole justification of the lithium in the water is that it reduces suicide and violent behavior.
[00:40:39.588 --> 00:40:42.130]  But their previous proclamation
[00:40:42.819 --> 00:40:44.980]  Shown by several large studies.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:50.961]  One was the Dartmouth University study where they looked at 280,000 children.
[00:40:50.961 --> 00:40:57.362]  Found that it increased, when you fluoridated the water in a community, it increased the lead content of the water.
[00:40:57.362 --> 00:41:01.963]  That increased suicide and violent behavior and criminal behavior.
[00:41:01.963 --> 00:41:08.865]  A Canadian study looked at the same thing and found when you fluoridated the water, it doubled the lead content of the water.
[00:41:09.488 --> 00:41:24.953]  When they compared communities that had fluoridated versus unfluoridated water, they found higher suicide rates and violent crime rates in the fluoridated communities versus non-fluoridated when they were matched for all other criteria.
[00:41:24.953 --> 00:41:36.257]  Well, it was also known that when lead is even increased slightly to the content that this fluoridation was causing, produced hyperactivity, it increased substance abuse.
[00:41:37.222 --> 00:41:41.164]  Uh, it increased suicide, and it increased violent behavior and crime.
[00:41:41.164 --> 00:41:42.325]  Significantly.
[00:41:42.325 --> 00:41:45.567]  Well, these are the very things now they're giving us for justification.
[00:41:45.567 --> 00:41:47.468]  Putting another metal in the water.
[00:41:47.468 --> 00:41:48.409]  Lithium.
[00:41:48.409 --> 00:41:56.133]  Well, if you want to reduce substance abuse, suicide, violent behavior, and crime, just take the fluoride out of the water.
[00:41:56.133 --> 00:41:58.555]  Uh, and take the lead out of the water.
[00:41:58.555 --> 00:42:01.877]  That's the easiest way to do that, and that's what the Safe Water Act says.
[00:42:01.877 --> 00:42:05.779]  The purpose of the EPA is to remove contaminants from the water.
[00:42:06.556 --> 00:42:07.717]  Now they've reversed that.
[00:42:07.717 --> 00:42:09.978]  They're going to add contaminants to the water.
[00:42:09.978 --> 00:42:14.420]  And if you look up lithium, lithium is considered a toxic metal.
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:30.888]  Now, in the concentration they're proposing using, yes, it does have the beneficial effects on brain protection, brain growth, reversal of neurologic conditions, reductions in suicide, all of these things they're claiming.
[00:42:30.888 --> 00:42:35.711]  But there's a lot of problems that we learn from the fluoridation idea of putting it in water.
[00:42:37.403 --> 00:42:44.709]  Number one, there's no consideration of the interactions of lithium with the other components of water and contaminants.
[00:42:44.709 --> 00:42:46.051]  Well that was my next point.
[00:42:46.051 --> 00:43:01.104]  Studying biology, and of course you are a top brain surgeon researcher, you know a lot more than I do, but just studying, when you have a bunch of chemicals mixed together, they have a magnifying effect on each other, correct?
[00:43:01.104 --> 00:43:02.966]  Yeah, it regards synergistic toxicity.
[00:43:04.149 --> 00:43:13.794]  But, you know, water has organochloride compounds in it, which are toxic to the cell as industrial chemicals, as other metals.
[00:43:13.794 --> 00:43:18.916]  And we know that lithium is a highly reactive metal, just like fluoride.
[00:43:18.916 --> 00:43:24.058]  And so it tends to interact with these other metals and components of chemicals.
[00:43:24.058 --> 00:43:27.340]  Well, no one's ever done a study to see, well, what happens when you mix them?
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.681]  Does it increase the toxicity of these other metals, etc.?
[00:43:30.681 --> 00:43:32.662]  Well, we did find that with fluoride.
[00:43:33.482 --> 00:43:38.066]  Uh, unknown at the time when they first proposed putting fluoride in water.
[00:43:38.066 --> 00:43:47.113]  Fluoride highly reacts with aluminum, forms an aluminum-fluoride complex, which is a powerful G-protein receptor stimulator.
[00:43:47.113 --> 00:43:54.499]  Well, I don't want to take a drug that stimulates G-proteins, because that could make breast cancer grow faster, or other cancers.
[00:43:54.499 --> 00:43:57.502]  Uh, it could have all kinds of neurological effects.
[00:43:57.502 --> 00:44:01.205]  Uh, but that was something that they found out decades later.
[00:44:01.897 --> 00:44:05.259]  Well, what are we going to find out about lithium decades later?
[00:44:17.785 --> 00:44:34.317]  It's similar to fluoride in that it builds up in the body, large amounts of it, and so that over time, in fact, I was reading when they start dosing people with lithium, a lot of times it even takes a few weeks to build up until it's at the full dosing point.
[00:44:34.317 --> 00:44:43.283]  Well, and at that point, it becomes a highly toxic metal and there's been quite a few fatalities associated with lithium accumulation.
[00:44:43.283 --> 00:44:45.765]  Now, that was also the problem we had with fluoride.
[00:44:46.677 --> 00:44:52.300]  They were, you know, in the very beginning, and even now, they say, well, gee, it's only one part per million.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:45:00.285]  Well, actually, the fluoride in water is the greatest source of fluoride toxicity in the environment, because you drink a lot of water.
[00:45:00.285 --> 00:45:14.533]  In the summertime, particularly if you're outdoors or an athlete, or you have certain medical conditions like diabetes, you drink a very large amount of water, and so you're consuming much larger content of fluoride.
[00:45:14.533 --> 00:45:16.174]  Well, the same would be true for lithium.
[00:45:17.058 --> 00:45:25.641]  Your intake is going to be much higher if you put it in water than if you just have it in natural sources, primarily food.
[00:45:25.641 --> 00:45:29.862]  Also, we've forgotten about this, and the same thing happened with fluoride.
[00:45:29.862 --> 00:45:42.285]  When you put a metal in the water purposely, and then you water your plants with it, your vegetables, your gardens, that you're going to eat these fruits and vegetables that are watered with the lithium-enhanced water.
[00:45:42.285 --> 00:45:44.086]  The plant accumulates the lithium,
[00:45:44.502 --> 00:45:46.823]  But then you're getting bioaccumulation.
[00:45:46.823 --> 00:45:49.245]  The longer you do it, the higher the content.
[00:45:49.245 --> 00:45:59.750]  And for those that don't know, that's just like the food chain where you don't eat swordfish because it's got hundreds of times the mercury that a smaller fish has because it's on the top of the food chain.
[00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:03.312]  And in the last five years, they've approved that it's being widely used.
[00:46:03.312 --> 00:46:07.975]  Sodium fluoride is a pesticide on crops, and they admit it bioaccumulates
[00:46:08.795 --> 00:46:30.875]  through the cell walls of the plants and so there's massive levels and thousands of foods don't have one part per million you know that's mixed in with the water that's used in their production they're actually adding upwards of 900 parts per million in TV dinners in powdered eggs that's all authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and then you have the toothpaste
[00:46:31.115 --> 00:46:34.436]  That the children are using very high levels of fluoride.
[00:46:34.436 --> 00:46:40.297]  Then you look at how the term sodium fluoride is a catch-all for hundreds of chemicals that they put in the water.
[00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:41.677]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:46:41.677 --> 00:46:45.218]  Well, and you have fluoridated medication.
[00:46:45.218 --> 00:46:49.399]  You know, we're now exposed to so much fluoride.
[00:46:49.399 --> 00:46:54.880]  We've exceeded recognized safety limits that are recognized by everybody.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.721]  EPA, FDA, the APA even recognizes that at those levels.
[00:47:00.475 --> 00:47:02.517]  There's no question of toxicity.
[00:47:02.517 --> 00:47:16.168]  Well, certain parts of the brain accumulate doses or concentrations of fluoride that are several hundred parts per million, which everybody agrees is toxic.
[00:47:16.168 --> 00:47:20.251]  Now, they still, they even use fluoridation as an example.
[00:47:20.251 --> 00:47:22.633]  Oh, look how successful fluoridation was.
[00:47:22.633 --> 00:47:26.436]  Well, we have poisoned millions of people with fluoride.
[00:47:26.436 --> 00:47:30.019]  It induces arthritis, bone fractures, infertility,
[00:47:30.806 --> 00:47:32.547]  Neurological disorders.
[00:47:32.547 --> 00:47:34.127]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:47:34.127 --> 00:47:34.808]  Cancer.
[00:47:34.808 --> 00:47:37.809]  It stimulates cancer growth.
[00:47:37.809 --> 00:47:40.130]  All of this is ignored by the public.
[00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:45.232]  And the mainline government university studies admit macular degeneration.
[00:47:45.232 --> 00:47:53.075]  So if it's eating and destroying the cells in the eye, which is connected to the brain, as you know, doctor, what is it doing to the brain?
[00:47:53.075 --> 00:47:56.456]  Well, we have evidence of brain damage by fluoride accumulation.
[00:47:59.072 --> 00:48:01.553]  That was done by Dr. Molnick.
[00:48:01.553 --> 00:48:12.335]  She presented it to the CDC, her program, her research, which was printed in one of the most prestigious neuropsychology journals.
[00:48:12.335 --> 00:48:15.216]  And for her trouble, they fired her.
[00:48:15.216 --> 00:48:18.736]  And they made sure she never got another federal grant.
[00:48:18.736 --> 00:48:26.498]  Because she showed the brain accumulation, particularly in parts of the brain that have to do with learning and memory, was significant and toxic.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.702]  So, you know, here we go again.
[00:48:30.702 --> 00:48:39.270]  Oh, we get all the assurances in the world, and then when the research starts showing tremendous toxicity and significant problems, it's all covered up.
[00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:41.532]  They can make sure the media doesn't cover it.
[00:48:41.532 --> 00:48:45.095]  They can make sure the public is never aware of it.
[00:48:45.095 --> 00:48:49.459]  They spend just enormous amounts of money on advertising.
[00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:52.462]  For instance, in this article about the purchase of lithium,
[00:48:53.615 --> 00:49:02.739]  They quote the EPA that fluoridation of water is one of the 10 greatest advances in medicine in history.
[00:49:02.739 --> 00:49:10.742]  Well, the studies, every study that has been done in modern times has shown fluoridating water does not reduce cavities at all.
[00:49:11.562 --> 00:49:16.687]  In fact, a number of studies show that it increases dental caries.
[00:49:27.316 --> 00:49:33.243]  Over 90% of the Food and Drug Administration toxicologists signed an open letter in 2000.
[00:49:33.243 --> 00:49:44.334]  In 2004, again, I've had them on the show, you know, top chemists, toxicologists, and they explain that it's not just fluoride, it's other chemicals.
[00:49:45.492 --> 00:49:46.112]  We're good to go.
[00:50:02.048 --> 00:50:19.753]  The founder of the Rockefeller dynasty was funding Pinkerton security to literally gatling gun protesters all over the country to go in in Colorado and massacre whole groups of families that had struck claims on gold mines that was their property.
[00:50:19.753 --> 00:50:23.234]  And these guys openly talked about a scientific dictatorship.
[00:50:23.234 --> 00:50:26.235]  They went and funded scientists to come up with systems
[00:50:26.955 --> 00:50:36.961]  Uh, to take over education, to dumb people down, and to drug them, to make them servile, and 110 years later we say, why can't the American people get angry and get upset?
[00:50:36.961 --> 00:50:50.328]  Because there's mercury in the vaccines, there's bisphenol A in all the packaging, uh, they're now saying, admitting, yeah we want to put lithium in, the fluoride isn't working enough, stay there doctor, I want to talk about how fluoride and lithium
[00:50:51.128 --> 00:50:54.132]  Affects the brain and makes people servile.
[00:50:54.132 --> 00:50:57.636]  It's just so incredible that they're out in the open with this now.
[00:50:57.636 --> 00:50:58.557]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:58.557 --> 00:50:59.037]  Stay with us.
[00:50:59.037 --> 00:51:01.040]  Dr. Russell Blaylock will give you his websites as well.
[00:51:02.301 --> 00:51:06.922]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:01.653 --> 00:52:04.056]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:04.056 --> 00:52:06.259]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:06.259 --> 00:52:09.584]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:09.584 --> 00:52:14.690]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:18.876]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:19.196 --> 00:52:21.539]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:21.539 --> 00:52:24.082]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:24.082 --> 00:52:27.345]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:27.345 --> 00:52:34.934]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:35.276 --> 00:52:40.659]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:40.659 --> 00:52:43.520]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.202]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:47.202 --> 00:52:48.263]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:48.263 --> 00:52:49.624]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:49.624 --> 00:52:51.104]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:10.245]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:53:10.245 --> 00:53:11.606]  Will they do it?
[00:53:11.606 --> 00:53:14.209]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:53:14.209 --> 00:53:20.674]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:53:20.674 --> 00:53:22.876]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:53:22.876 --> 00:53:24.918]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:32.024]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:53:32.024 --> 00:53:36.948]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:53:36.948 --> 00:53:42.693]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:53:42.693 --> 00:53:51.120]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.622]  That's martiallawsurvival.com.

[00:53:56.664 --> 00:54:10.995]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:54:10.995 --> 00:54:14.017]  Do you realize what we're talking about here on air?
[00:54:15.794 --> 00:54:21.397]  I have literally over a hundred government funded textbooks like Ecoscience by the White House Science Czar.
[00:54:21.397 --> 00:54:27.560]  I have a mainstream news article from 2006 where he talked about population reduction and drugging the population.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.241]  That's all these people talk about.
[00:54:29.909 --> 00:54:33.133]  We've got books written over a hundred years ago how they were going to do it.
[00:54:33.133 --> 00:54:34.274]  And they've done it!
[00:54:34.274 --> 00:54:46.529]  As Aldous Huxley said when he wrote Brave New World in 1933, this is what the top scientist that he worked with, his brother, later headed up the United Nations UNESCO, as the Secretary General of UNESCO, and called for it.
[00:54:46.969 --> 00:55:00.735]  So, Dr. Blaylock, let's talk about specifically what fluoride does, because the studies I've seen show that it doesn't just cause IQ reduction and dumbing down, but that it causes people to become more servile.
[00:55:00.735 --> 00:55:07.278]  And there's no denying that lithium does this, and they're admitting they want lithium for that purpose.
[00:55:07.278 --> 00:55:10.360]  Well, this is part of the study that Dr. Molyneux did.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:13.481]  You know, he's one of the world's top neurotoxicologists.
[00:55:15.116 --> 00:55:22.761]  She found that if you gave fluoride to animals after they were born, they become extremely apathetic.
[00:55:22.761 --> 00:55:25.243]  And they become what she described as couch potatoes.
[00:55:25.243 --> 00:55:31.467]  They just don't have a sense of doing anything productive.
[00:55:31.467 --> 00:55:40.233]  Well, if you transfer that to humans, she found the brain level in these animals is equal to what we're seeing in humans.
[00:55:40.233 --> 00:55:42.835]  We're going to have a society that it's going to be very difficult
[00:55:43.564 --> 00:55:51.587]  Uh, for people to concentrate and focus, uh, attention and to pay attention to what's going on in the world and be able to analyze it.
[00:55:51.587 --> 00:55:53.007]  And look at Americans!
[00:55:53.007 --> 00:56:05.191]  The most intelligent, the most patents, the most aggressive, you know, historians worldwide wrote about us, and now we're the most slovenly and dumbed down because they've been hitting us with a chemical attack for 50 years!
[00:56:05.191 --> 00:56:09.633]  Right, by destroying our educational system and at the same time doing a, uh,
[00:56:10.536 --> 00:56:15.560]  A number on our ability to think through chemical dumbing down.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.741]  Let's judge it with that.
[00:56:16.741 --> 00:56:19.143]  Let me just give a couple of quotes here.
[00:56:19.143 --> 00:56:21.504]  I think people will find them interesting.
[00:56:21.504 --> 00:56:27.729]  This says, fluoridation is the greatest case of scientific fraud of the century.
[00:56:27.729 --> 00:56:34.414]  That was a quote from a friend of mine, Robert Carton, who's a former EPA scientist, senior scientist.
[00:56:34.414 --> 00:56:37.076]  The second quote says, regarding fluoridation,
[00:56:37.759 --> 00:56:49.586]  The EPA should act immediately to protect the public, not just on the cancer data, but on evidence of bone fractures, arthritis, mutagenicity, and other effects.
[00:56:49.586 --> 00:56:56.370]  That was a quote from William Marcus, Ph.D., senior EPA toxicologist.
[00:56:56.370 --> 00:57:05.895]  So here's two of the top EPA toxicologists saying, the whole fluoridation thing was a fraud to begin with, and it's extremely toxic.
[00:57:07.402 --> 00:57:12.608]  Uh, Matt, you think that the government, uh, uh, top scientists know that?
[00:57:12.608 --> 00:57:14.710]  The government knows it as well.
[00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:29.084]  And whoever is going through these towns, uh, doing everything they can to force the towns to fluoridate, for instance, like Governor Schwarzenegger, who made the entire state of California fluoridate their water, whether they wanted to or not.
[00:57:30.341 --> 00:57:34.145]  You think they don't know these same things, the effects of fluoride?
[00:57:34.145 --> 00:57:42.973]  The National Scientists Institute did an extensive study to finally answer the question, is fluoridation toxic?
[00:57:42.973 --> 00:57:49.358]  Their conclusion was exactly what all of us have been saying about fluoride.
[00:57:49.358 --> 00:57:55.844]  That it is a brain toxin, a bone toxin, an organ toxin, a cell toxin, a DNA toxin.
[00:57:56.542 --> 00:58:03.612]  And it bioaccumulates so that people now are getting doses that are without any question tucked.
[00:58:03.612 --> 00:58:11.302]  And it, without any question, it has neurological effects, one of which is inducing a type of apathy.
[00:58:12.443 --> 00:58:15.145]  And doctor, this is an assault.
[00:58:15.145 --> 00:58:18.507]  This is a stealth kill, soft kill, assault.
[00:58:18.507 --> 00:58:28.595]  These eugenicists, funded by the robber barons, who funded Planned Parenthood, abortion, everything else, they are literally brain damaging people and destroying their destiny.
[00:58:28.595 --> 00:58:30.116]  It is the ultimate crime.
[00:58:30.116 --> 00:58:34.979]  If we beat these people in the history books, it will be remembered as the greatest crime in history.
[00:58:34.979 --> 00:58:38.642]  Back in 70 seconds with Dr. Russell Blaylock.

[01:00:52.132 --> 01:00:57.213]  And we've been covering what the head EPA scientist has said.
[01:00:57.213 --> 01:00:59.554]  We've had the gentleman on, he mentioned.
[01:00:59.554 --> 01:01:03.696]  They've written letters with thousands of other scientists signing them, saying, why are you doing this?
[01:01:04.956 --> 01:01:07.837]  Even the American Dental Association went four or five years ago.
[01:01:07.837 --> 01:01:08.937]  My dad's a dentist, by the way.
[01:01:08.937 --> 01:01:10.077]  This was a big shock for him.
[01:01:10.077 --> 01:01:12.518]  He's seen the documents now and understands what's happening.
[01:01:12.518 --> 01:01:17.659]  Said, yeah, children under five don't brush their teeth with fluoride, causes dental fluorosis.
[01:01:17.659 --> 01:01:22.160]  Now, in fact, let me just grab it off the floor here.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:28.202]  All over store shelves, all over the country, baby water with purified water with fluoride added.
[01:01:29.858 --> 01:01:31.099]  The toothpaste, everything.
[01:01:31.099 --> 01:01:33.620]  This is so diabolical.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:44.986]  Dr. Blaylock, bottom line, they've gone from calling us kooks to now admitting they want to make us servile and now they want to add lithium and now they're mixing it in with the crops and the food.
[01:01:44.986 --> 01:01:49.508]  I mean, my God, these people, the point I was making is they're assaulting us.
[01:01:49.508 --> 01:01:51.490]  They admit they're assaulting us.
[01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:53.411]  We need to have what, grand juries?
[01:01:53.411 --> 01:01:54.391]  Call for indictments?
[01:01:54.391 --> 01:01:55.772]  What do we do to stop these people?
[01:01:56.690 --> 01:02:01.293]  Well, I think our only real protection is nullification.
[01:02:01.293 --> 01:02:05.997]  The states have got to get together and just nullify this stuff.
[01:02:05.997 --> 01:02:16.364]  You know, say we're not fluoridating anything and we're not putting lithium in our water and the federal government has no constitutional authority to do such a thing and nullify it.
[01:02:16.364 --> 01:02:22.188]  You know, people should read his new book by Thomas Woods on nullification.
[01:02:22.188 --> 01:02:25.070]  I just recently read the history of nullification.
[01:02:26.153 --> 01:02:29.718]  And it's our greatest protection.
[01:02:29.718 --> 01:02:38.869]  The states got together and ratified the Constitution with the assurance that they would retain their sovereignty and rights as guaranteed by that Constitution.
[01:02:38.869 --> 01:02:44.055]  Now the federal government says no, there's no state, it's only individuals and the majority rule.
[01:02:44.818 --> 01:02:50.701]  Well, if you read these articles about this lithium fluoridation, that's exactly what they said.
[01:02:50.701 --> 01:03:04.129]  You know, as one of them says, as long as the negative consequences or inconveniences are relatively minor, water fortification seems to be one of those cases where the majority preference and interest should prevail.
[01:03:04.129 --> 01:03:05.370]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:06.791]  Let's look at fluoridation again.
[01:03:07.929 --> 01:03:17.438]  They admit, everybody admits, all the scientific studies admit that there's a subgroup of people that are highly sensitive to water fluoridation toxicity.
[01:03:17.438 --> 01:03:19.099]  People who have chronic illnesses.
[01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:21.842]  People who have chronic kidney disease.
[01:03:21.842 --> 01:03:25.385]  People who have certain neurological diseases.
[01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:27.787]  Pregnant women, small babies.
[01:03:27.787 --> 01:03:29.309]  All those are at-risk groups.
[01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:32.131]  Well, their view is, well, they're a minority, so who cares?
[01:03:32.131 --> 01:03:32.892]  Let them be harmed.
[01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:36.364]  Uh, and that's what they're saying about the lithium.
[01:03:36.364 --> 01:03:40.986]  Well, yeah, there's people that could be harmed, but the majority should rule.
[01:03:40.986 --> 01:03:44.288]  Uh, well, this country's not based on majority rule.
[01:03:45.149 --> 01:03:53.631]  You know, if you read the Federalist Papers, there were great assurances that the Constitution protected the minority, the small groups.
[01:03:53.631 --> 01:03:57.112]  Yeah, democracy's two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:03:57.112 --> 01:04:01.953]  And if the government can get 100 million fluoride heads to vote to take our guns, they can't do it.
[01:04:01.953 --> 01:04:07.314]  But it's the outrageousness, the nakedness of this tyranny, how they're just out in the open.
[01:04:07.834 --> 01:04:11.056]  Saying, yeah, we know it doubles bone cancer in boys.
[01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:12.597]  Yeah, we know it's causing arthritis.
[01:04:12.597 --> 01:04:16.219]  We know it's causing brain damage and macular degeneration.
[01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:18.040]  We know it's causing organ failure.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:18.820]  We don't care.
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:19.541]  We're liberal.
[01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:20.541]  We love you.
[01:04:20.541 --> 01:04:22.282]  They know full well they're not liberal.
[01:04:22.282 --> 01:04:28.025]  They're a bunch of population reductionist control freaks that need to have their butts locked up in prison.
[01:04:28.025 --> 01:04:32.228]  I think we need to start getting really aggressive with these people, assaulting us and our families.
[01:04:32.228 --> 01:04:33.188]  Doctor, I'll be honest with you.
[01:04:33.188 --> 01:04:34.429]  Every time I look at my children,
[01:04:34.989 --> 01:04:38.631]  And think about how much trouble I gotta go through to protect them from these bastards.
[01:04:38.631 --> 01:04:39.552]  I get really angry.
[01:04:39.552 --> 01:04:48.417]  And I want to talk to you about, as a man, not as a top brain surgeon, not as a scientist, but as a man, with family, how this affects you.
[01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:50.399]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:04:50.399 --> 01:04:52.120]  You know, I'm against violence.
[01:04:53.817 --> 01:04:59.744]  I am for defending myself, and I'm just more and more getting sick of these people and getting red-blooded angry.
[01:04:59.744 --> 01:05:01.526]  LayLockWellnessCenter.com, stay with us.
[01:05:01.526 --> 01:05:05.870]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:10.195]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:10.195 --> 01:05:10.676]  Number two,
[01:05:11.056 --> 01:05:15.939]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.939 --> 01:05:16.680]  It's true.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:22.383]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:22.383 --> 01:05:25.966]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.966 --> 01:05:30.689]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:30.689 --> 01:05:33.451]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:33.451 --> 01:05:36.793]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:37.113 --> 01:05:42.055]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:42.055 --> 01:05:47.096]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:06:19.159 --> 01:06:24.040]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:08:01.792 --> 01:08:07.793]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:08:07.793 --> 01:08:13.395]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:13.395 --> 01:08:15.195]  Boy, a lot of things have changed.
[01:08:16.448 --> 01:08:25.369]  Oh sure, I've got in my library over 100 government textbooks and white papers written by every major top government funded scientist out there.
[01:08:27.213 --> 01:08:31.837]  And then I've got all the other government scientists coming out and saying this is deadly poison, they're killing us.
[01:08:31.837 --> 01:08:34.479]  The government says, we don't care, it's going to continue.
[01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:40.504]  And now they say, yeah, we're going to give you vaccines that are live virus, re-engineered herpes virus.
[01:08:40.504 --> 01:08:48.710]  It's going to go in and destroy the receptor sites for hormones that cause stress and anger to make you be calm and happy.
[01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:50.512]  And why this will stop suicide.
[01:08:50.512 --> 01:08:52.433]  So everybody's got to do it.
[01:08:52.433 --> 01:08:55.456]  In one of these reports, they say, let me just pull the report out.
[01:08:56.909 --> 01:09:08.058]  Here it is, Oxford professor Julian Savalaiu says fluoridation demonstrates how populations of the future could be mass medicated through pharmacological cognitive enhancers.
[01:09:08.058 --> 01:09:20.847]  And he said, writing for Oxford, and he's their top bioethicist there, that when questions arise whether they should be added to the water, like fluoride, he goes on to say we need ritalin, Adderall, and he lists a bunch of other chemicals.
[01:09:23.108 --> 01:09:24.629]  Riddle and Adderall, Prozac.
[01:09:24.629 --> 01:09:29.551]  I mean, Prozac increases suicide in all the major studies that are out there.
[01:09:29.551 --> 01:09:30.911]  Dr. Blaylock?
[01:09:30.911 --> 01:09:32.712]  Oh, exactly right.
[01:09:32.712 --> 01:09:33.913]  Exactly right.
[01:09:33.913 --> 01:09:42.436]  I have a friend of mine named Joseph Douglas who wrote the book Red Cocaine and he's written a recent book called Mind Control.
[01:09:42.436 --> 01:09:47.738]  But he worked for the NSA for a while as the debriefer of Soviet defectors.
[01:09:48.665 --> 01:09:53.614]  And he debriefed one of the highest ranking Soviet KGB agents.
[01:09:53.614 --> 01:09:56.219]  And we've gotten to be good friends for many years.
[01:09:58.477 --> 01:10:04.679]  He sent me information showing me that the Soviet program is exactly what you're talking about.
[01:10:04.679 --> 01:10:20.384]  Controlling people's minds, using drugs and sophisticated advanced technology and neuropharmacology to be able to control stress and apathy and concentration and susceptibility to brainwashing.
[01:10:20.384 --> 01:10:27.547]  Well, now I'm seeing, as things you're discussing that both of us know about, we're sort of seeing the same sort of thing over here.
[01:10:28.611 --> 01:10:35.656]  The same dream where we can medicate the war, make people more compliant to accepting these ideas.
[01:10:35.656 --> 01:10:46.623]  We can make them more apathetic so they're less likely to react adversely to some of our more totalitarian schemes.
[01:10:46.623 --> 01:10:51.286]  It's a control method that was first intensely
[01:10:52.774 --> 01:10:59.699]  Being studied by the Soviet Union and the United States government was quite interested in this.
[01:10:59.699 --> 01:11:02.702]  Now they're pursuing it.
[01:11:02.702 --> 01:11:07.265]  So I think people are just not paying attention.
[01:11:07.265 --> 01:11:16.012]  If they're listening to these people who say, oh, we're just a bunch of right-wing nutcases who see a conspirator behind every bush,
[01:11:16.954 --> 01:11:24.759]  Well, as Alex said, both of us read the primary literature which is being written by these people.
[01:11:24.759 --> 01:11:27.641]  In their writings, they openly talk about this.
[01:11:27.641 --> 01:11:30.203]  They don't deny that this is the goal they're seeking.
[01:11:32.145 --> 01:11:39.572]  So, you know, you're kind of being foolish if you say, well, this is a bunch of conspiracy nuts.
[01:11:39.572 --> 01:11:44.736]  You better read their literature because they're telling you that, yes, this is what we intend to do.
[01:11:44.736 --> 01:11:50.321]  And I said that the book written by Dr. Lilly on the history of molecular biology, it's a history book.
[01:11:50.321 --> 01:11:52.363]  It's a science book.
[01:11:52.363 --> 01:11:55.466]  But she had access to all the Rockefeller files.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.522]  I don't know.
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:34.488]  Creates eugenics, the Royals love it, it says we're the elite, we're allowed to rule, and by 1900, literally hundreds of white papers about drugging the water, then they discovered DNA, and they funded the abortion, the Planned Parenthood, and it's all stated, and so modern science was interwoven in the last hundred years and medicine
[01:12:35.308 --> 01:12:37.229]  and chemistry with eugenics.
[01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:58.937]  I mean my dad went to UT and he said every class he was in they taught him you're the elite because you're going to you know be going to medical school and you're the elite because you have the highest test scores and you know should we drug the water because these were young people they were just testing to see if they'd buy into the club to then be promoted
[01:12:59.537 --> 01:13:04.402]  And then when my dad was top of his class, they pulled him aside and said, look, we're carrying out eugenics.
[01:13:04.402 --> 01:13:06.904]  And he kind of freaked out and, you know, wasn't part of it.
[01:13:06.904 --> 01:13:08.385]  But it's not just my dad.
[01:13:08.385 --> 01:13:09.466]  It's everybody.
[01:13:09.466 --> 01:13:16.913]  I mean, let me ask you, Dr. Blaylock, when you went to several prestigious universities, did you ever run into this propaganda?
[01:13:16.913 --> 01:13:22.018]  Well, yeah, I mean, and the interesting thing was you talk to your colleagues.
[01:13:22.018 --> 01:13:24.020]  They were not opposed to these ideas.
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:25.261]  They thought they were good ideas.
[01:13:26.761 --> 01:13:40.005]  You know, there's this elitist mentality that Tom Sowell wrote a whole book about, that they think that they should rule society, and your job is to do what they tell you.
[01:13:40.005 --> 01:13:41.786]  Yeah, that's visions of the anointed.
[01:13:41.786 --> 01:13:48.788]  Visions of the anointed, and that, you know, it all stems back to the ancient principle of Gnosticism.
[01:13:49.582 --> 01:13:57.024]  And Gnosticism basically says that there are certain people on Earth who have tremendous wisdom, and they should rule the world.
[01:13:57.024 --> 01:13:58.445]  Well, that's what Plato said!
[01:13:58.445 --> 01:13:58.865]  Right.
[01:13:58.865 --> 01:14:14.370]  And, you know, Eric Boglen, a very highly regarded philosopher-historian, has written extensively on how Gnosticism was the birth of Nazism, Soviet Communism, and all these collectivist ideas.
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:18.121]  That a small group should make all the decisions.
[01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:22.403]  Well, this paper that's written on this lithium, that's exactly what he said.
[01:14:22.403 --> 01:14:36.209]  He said that this is a revolutionary prospect, and we're going to harness water to control the population, and that it's a democratic idea.
[01:14:36.209 --> 01:14:40.730]  In other words, we're the ones who rule the majority.
[01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:43.611]  And we don't really care whether you object or not, we're going to do it.
[01:14:43.611 --> 01:14:44.692]  Look at the healthcare bill.
[01:14:45.749 --> 01:14:49.170]  Most Americans in the polls were opposed to it.
[01:14:49.170 --> 01:14:53.311]  Well, the elitists in Washington, we don't care.
[01:14:53.311 --> 01:15:00.332]  It's a democracy of the elitist control freaks, not even their fake mass democracy.
[01:15:00.332 --> 01:15:02.612]  Right, it's an illusion.
[01:15:02.612 --> 01:15:09.794]  They present the collectivist utopian idea and say here's the plan, now implement the plan.
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:17.162]  And then they create their polls to say, well, people want it in our mind, and so we're going to give it to them.
[01:15:17.162 --> 01:15:18.162]  Well, here's another example.
[01:15:18.162 --> 01:15:22.323]  They lie to us and say that our founders modeled us off of Greece.
[01:15:22.323 --> 01:15:27.705]  The founders criticized Greece, and it was only the elite families were allowed to vote.
[01:15:27.705 --> 01:15:31.126]  One bucket Whitestones, one bucket Redstones, and they would vote.
[01:15:31.826 --> 01:15:38.169]  Yeah, I mean, if you look at the wording of this lithium argument they're making, they're saying, well, you know, most people aren't smart enough to understand
[01:16:01.152 --> 01:16:04.974]  How important this is, therefore we'll just have to force it down their throat.
[01:16:04.974 --> 01:16:08.916]  Well, that's what they did with fluoride, and look at what we've discussed so far.
[01:16:08.916 --> 01:16:19.001]  Well, it's DNA toxic, it causes hypothyroidism, increased fractures, infertility, several cancers increased in children dramatically, it's neurotoxic.
[01:16:19.001 --> 01:16:25.665]  Well, now you've created this destruction in the lives of millions of people.
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.441]  And yet they're still pushing the program.
[01:16:28.441 --> 01:16:31.844]  And they even have to admit that it doesn't prevent cavities at all.
[01:16:31.844 --> 01:16:48.334]  You know, I met with a group of dentists who gave a lecture on fluoride and toxicity, and one of the dentists said, well, you know, we've got to fluoridate the water because, you know, we take care of these poor kids in Jackson, Mississippi, and they all have rotten teeth that are crumbling.
[01:16:48.334 --> 01:16:51.356]  And I said, well, you've been fluoridating the water for 40 years.
[01:16:51.356 --> 01:16:52.397]  There shouldn't be any cavities.
[01:16:53.027 --> 01:17:00.752]  Yet you're telling me the same story that you sold this program to the United States more than 60 years ago.
[01:17:00.752 --> 01:17:01.713]  As if nothing's happened.
[01:17:01.713 --> 01:17:04.014]  Well, your fluoride obviously isn't working.
[01:17:04.014 --> 01:17:06.096]  They're all drinking fluoridated water.
[01:17:06.096 --> 01:17:07.657]  Their parents drank it.
[01:17:07.657 --> 01:17:10.539]  And yet you're still giving the same story that their teeth are rotting.
[01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:17.031]  And then we've got all the studies admitting it's calcifying in the joints.
[01:17:17.031 --> 01:17:19.092]  Now you've got young people getting arthritis.
[01:17:19.092 --> 01:17:21.593]  They admit it's attacking the brain, the eyes.
[01:17:21.593 --> 01:17:24.653]  And it's nothing to do with teeth, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:24.653 --> 01:17:25.154]  Zero.
[01:17:25.154 --> 01:17:26.294]  It makes you servile.
[01:17:26.294 --> 01:17:28.014]  And now, they don't even deny it.
[01:17:28.014 --> 01:17:29.935]  They say, hey, we're going to put Prozac
[01:17:30.515 --> 01:17:34.897]  We're going to put lithium in your water and all the major medical institutes and the U.S.
[01:17:34.897 --> 01:17:39.860]  government are on record doing the studies and getting ready to propose it.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:41.781]  Why do you think they're coming out in the open?
[01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:46.764]  Is it arrogance or a counter to you and I and many others exposing them?
[01:17:46.764 --> 01:17:50.566]  And have they miscalculated by coming out in the open now?
[01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:56.729]  Well, I think that they feel they're so close to winning the whole game that they're impatient.
[01:17:57.381 --> 01:18:00.162]  And they don't care if you know what they're going to do now.
[01:18:00.162 --> 01:18:03.122]  You know, for years they did it.
[01:18:03.122 --> 01:18:08.604]  At my age, I remember the days when no one I would talk to had ever heard of CFR.
[01:18:08.604 --> 01:18:11.505]  No one knew anything about the Rockefellers.
[01:18:11.505 --> 01:18:15.566]  No one knew about the Tax-Free Foundation.
[01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:20.567]  You know, the vast majority of the public, that was something that was just a shrouded secret.
[01:18:20.567 --> 01:18:21.427]  Now it's all known.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.703]  You can read extensively about it.
[01:18:25.703 --> 01:18:29.007]  So they have advanced this so far.
[01:18:29.007 --> 01:18:36.016]  They feel we're right on the precipice of taking over the whole thing.
[01:18:36.016 --> 01:18:37.758]  And nothing they can do about it.
[01:18:37.758 --> 01:18:39.240]  So we don't care if they know now.
[01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:43.191]  And if you don't want government healthcare, we're gonna call you racist.
[01:18:43.191 --> 01:18:46.934]  And if you don't want us to put lithium in, we're gonna call you a tinfoil hat, and we're going,
[01:19:00.083 --> 01:19:04.284]  But after all these denials that this was to dumb us down and control us, you now admit it.
[01:19:04.284 --> 01:19:10.946]  And they look at you straight-faced in these news articles and videos and say, we know best, and you just want to punch them.
[01:19:10.946 --> 01:19:13.086]  I mean, doesn't it make you angry just as a man?
[01:19:13.086 --> 01:19:14.606]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:19:14.606 --> 01:19:23.829]  I mean, it's infuriating because they're destroying the health of your children, and they expect you to just stand by helplessly and let them destroy your children.
[01:19:23.829 --> 01:19:25.349]  It's just like this vaccine program.
[01:19:26.517 --> 01:19:34.244]  There's no question that this massive vaccination of children is having a serious effect on their brain development.
[01:19:34.244 --> 01:19:38.728]  They expect you just to stand by and let them destroy your children.
[01:19:39.622 --> 01:19:44.104]  And they don't care whether you object or not, and of course that's infuriating.
[01:19:44.104 --> 01:19:48.525]  And this is what led the founders of this country to fight against England.
[01:19:48.525 --> 01:19:51.046]  This is why they formed a new country.
[01:19:51.046 --> 01:19:53.527]  Doc, we've only got one more segment with you.
[01:19:53.527 --> 01:19:56.328]  Can we keep you till 40 after so we have plenty of time to cover this?
[01:19:56.328 --> 01:19:57.048]  Sure.
[01:19:57.048 --> 01:19:57.769]  Alright, God bless you.
[01:19:57.769 --> 01:20:00.830]  We'll be right back after this quick break with Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:02.290]  BlaylockWellnessCenter.com.
[01:20:02.290 --> 01:20:05.311]  You've seen our Sinophresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:20:05.311 --> 01:20:07.232]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:20:07.372 --> 01:20:10.114]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:20:10.114 --> 01:20:12.335]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:20:12.335 --> 01:20:13.756]  Okay, here it comes!
[01:20:13.756 --> 01:20:15.657]  But first, the facts.
[01:20:15.657 --> 01:20:17.578]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:20:17.578 --> 01:20:19.560]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:23.262]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:20:23.262 --> 01:20:31.007]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:20:31.007 --> 01:20:31.887]  Sinofresh.
[01:20:31.887 --> 01:20:34.729]  Now here's your limited-time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[01:20:51.264 --> 01:20:51.624]  Mention GCN.
[01:20:51.624 --> 01:20:52.565]  Buy SinoFresh.com.
[01:20:52.565 --> 01:20:52.945]  It works!
[01:21:01.952 --> 01:21:04.334]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:04.334 --> 01:21:06.655]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:06.655 --> 01:21:09.857]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:09.857 --> 01:21:14.980]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:19.163]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:19.483 --> 01:21:21.944]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:21.944 --> 01:21:24.705]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:24.705 --> 01:21:27.627]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:27.627 --> 01:21:35.230]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:35.566 --> 01:21:40.968]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:40.968 --> 01:21:43.269]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:43.269 --> 01:21:47.491]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:47.491 --> 01:21:48.571]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:49.912]  You're everyone else.
[01:21:49.912 --> 01:21:51.412]  Invisible Empire.

[01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:07.831]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:07.831 --> 01:22:15.934]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:15.934 --> 01:22:24.097]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:24.097 --> 01:22:28.859]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:29.199 --> 01:22:34.426]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:34.426 --> 01:22:38.771]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:38.771 --> 01:22:39.853]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:39.853 --> 01:22:43.898]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:44.358 --> 01:22:49.264]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:52.268]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:54.030]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.270]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.518 --> 01:23:03.901]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:23:03.901 --> 01:23:07.804]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:23:07.804 --> 01:23:11.527]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:23:11.527 --> 01:23:19.053]  At less than $0.02 per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[01:23:19.093 --> 01:23:19.373]  I think so.
[01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.150]  Sure.
[01:24:26.357 --> 01:24:33.704]  Alright, Dr. Russell Blaylock is going to be with us for this 5-minute segment, then about 10 minutes into the next segment until about 40 after or so, because I want to get more into the government healthcare.
[01:24:33.704 --> 01:24:44.935]  Another headline, National Health Services slash medical care in England, even basic things like surgery for cancer, broken legs, that's the London Telegraph.
[01:24:44.935 --> 01:24:46.876]  But I wanted to back up Dr. Blaylock here.
[01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:53.295]  Because, in fact, guys, give me a document can shot here.
[01:24:53.295 --> 01:24:55.597]  Axe falls on NHS service.
[01:24:55.597 --> 01:25:01.802]  NHS bosses have drawn up secret plans for sweeping cuts to services with restrictions on the most basic treatments.
[01:25:01.802 --> 01:25:12.191]  Then I have another Telegraph article here in my stack where they come right out and admit a ten-fold increase in violent
[01:25:13.448 --> 01:25:17.370]  Well, I wrote approximately five papers about this.
[01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:19.651]  The mechanism by which it does that.
[01:25:19.651 --> 01:25:19.892]  I've had
[01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:50.934]  I've watched interviews with Dr. Offit, who's the big promoter of vaccines, that it's completely safe and there's no mechanism by which it could cause seizures.
[01:25:50.934 --> 01:25:53.855]  Well, this is just an absolute lie.
[01:25:53.855 --> 01:26:02.939]  It's in the medical literature and I proposed in these peer-reviewed journal articles that are on PubMed.
[01:26:02.939 --> 01:26:04.099]  You can read them yourself.
[01:26:04.099 --> 01:26:08.141]  It goes through the mechanism by which vaccines do that.
[01:26:08.141 --> 01:26:10.702]  It's a very well-demonstrated mechanism.
[01:26:11.491 --> 01:26:20.533]  To vaccinate people repetitively has been shown to cause the brain to become chronically inflamed.
[01:26:20.533 --> 01:26:26.034]  And I name this immuno-excitotoxicity, the mechanism by which it does that.
[01:26:26.034 --> 01:26:32.355]  And it's well demonstrated in experimental studies in humans that this occurs.
[01:26:32.355 --> 01:26:39.137]  Well, this policy of just increasing the number of vaccines, you know, more every day,
[01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:52.397]  It's producing this chronic brain inflammation which leads to seizures, degenerative brain disorders, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig disease, numerous disorders.
[01:26:52.397 --> 01:27:01.583]  And for them to deny this or ignore it is incredible to me, as strong as the scientific evidence is.
[01:27:02.346 --> 01:27:13.889]  Well, Dr. Blaylock, I just put the article up on screen and I drew arrows to the government's own report that it's a tenfold increase in convulsions.
[01:27:13.889 --> 01:27:17.250]  And I even, something I've never done on air before, I even wrote a cuss word under it.
[01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:19.591]  I said, bleeping, look at this!
[01:27:19.591 --> 01:27:23.492]  I mean, to look at children, not just my own, but everybody's children.
[01:27:23.492 --> 01:27:24.292]  I just love them.
[01:27:24.292 --> 01:27:25.493]  I want to protect them.
[01:27:25.493 --> 01:27:26.153]  They're innocent.
[01:27:26.153 --> 01:27:26.553]  They're good.
[01:27:26.553 --> 01:27:27.994]  That's a normal instinct.
[01:27:27.994 --> 01:27:29.314]  How can these globalists
[01:27:29.774 --> 01:27:31.735]  No, it's causing cancer.
[01:27:31.735 --> 01:27:33.496]  No, it's causing brain damage.
[01:27:33.496 --> 01:27:35.298]  No, it's causing autism.
[01:27:35.298 --> 01:27:37.319]  No, it's a IQ reducer.
[01:27:37.319 --> 01:27:46.444]  And when a child gets epilepsy, sometimes they get it for life from these shots, they admit, they are literally assaulting these people with a deadly weapon.
[01:27:46.444 --> 01:27:53.609]  Well, you remember back when we, during the peak of all this flu, H1N1 nonsense, when you interviewed me.
[01:27:54.306 --> 01:28:01.429]  That was one of the warnings I gave, that if they gave this shot, we're going to have a lot of kids having seizures.
[01:28:01.429 --> 01:28:11.332]  And I predicted there was going to be, over the next decade, a significant increase in schizophrenia from vaccinating pregnant women.
[01:28:11.332 --> 01:28:12.672]  And the increase in autism.
[01:28:12.672 --> 01:28:14.233]  We're going to see that.
[01:28:14.233 --> 01:28:18.234]  It's going to take a decade to see the full impact.
[01:28:18.234 --> 01:28:19.775]  But already we're seeing the seizures.
[01:28:21.168 --> 01:28:22.769]  So, I predicted it.
[01:28:22.769 --> 01:28:24.009]  They said I was crazy.
[01:28:24.009 --> 01:28:27.090]  Well, who turned out right?
[01:28:27.090 --> 01:28:32.992]  I said the whole thing was a phony scam, that there was no epidemic or pandemic.
[01:28:32.992 --> 01:28:34.292]  They said I was crazy.
[01:28:34.292 --> 01:28:35.613]  Well, how did it turn out?
[01:28:35.613 --> 01:28:37.933]  Well, I was right.
[01:28:37.933 --> 01:28:42.875]  It wasn't that I have a magical link to the Lord to find out.
[01:28:42.875 --> 01:28:46.476]  It's because the science said it in the first place.
[01:28:46.476 --> 01:28:49.937]  If you read the science in the very beginning of all this, it said it
[01:28:50.626 --> 01:28:53.729]  A virus that does not transmit very easy.
[01:28:53.729 --> 01:28:56.072]  It's below virulent.
[01:28:56.072 --> 01:29:02.518]  So they lied from A to Z. And if you look at the CDC site, it was right there.
[01:29:02.518 --> 01:29:10.346]  But the media, for some reason, couldn't bother themselves to even look at the CDC's own data, which I analyzed in great detail.
[01:29:12.006 --> 01:29:15.707]  Nobody refuted it, and it turned out I was right.
[01:29:15.707 --> 01:29:18.948]  We're about to go to break, and we commend you for being right, sir.
[01:29:18.948 --> 01:29:20.209]  But what specifically?
[01:29:20.209 --> 01:29:21.069]  Is it squalene?
[01:29:21.069 --> 01:29:22.249]  Is it the aluminum?
[01:29:22.249 --> 01:29:26.571]  I mean, is it the adjuvants causing the autoimmune response, the brain swelling?
[01:29:26.571 --> 01:29:27.931]  It's all of that.
[01:29:27.931 --> 01:29:37.814]  Anything that stimulates the brain's immunity and all of those things do, and the more you add, the more intensely it stimulates it, the more it produces chronic brain inflammation.
[01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:45.201]  And you've done research on the fact that most of Alzheimer's is brain inflammation, correct?
[01:29:45.201 --> 01:29:49.444]  Well, I've put together the research that has been done that proves that.
[01:29:49.444 --> 01:29:49.964]  Stay there.
[01:29:49.964 --> 01:29:50.304]  Stay there.
[01:29:50.304 --> 01:29:52.025]  We gotta come back.
[01:29:52.025 --> 01:29:53.426]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.426 --> 01:29:55.948]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.948 --> 01:29:58.630]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.843 --> 01:30:04.684]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[01:30:04.684 --> 01:30:09.987]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[01:30:09.987 --> 01:30:12.768]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.
[01:30:12.768 --> 01:30:16.450]  Remember the terrible conditions of those that didn't get out for Katrina.
[01:30:16.450 --> 01:30:22.472]  Go right now to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633 for information on the new evacuation pack.
[01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:32.075]  It contains two weeks of delicious, easy-to-fix food, along with the equipment to prepare it.
[01:30:32.075 --> 01:30:35.156]  It's packed in a rugged, heavy-duty tote for transport.
[01:30:35.156 --> 01:30:39.557]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[01:30:39.557 --> 01:30:44.898]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods and storms must be escaped.
[01:30:44.898 --> 01:30:48.738]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disaster.
[01:30:48.738 --> 01:30:51.839]  At least prepare yourself with this two-week evacuation pack.
[01:30:52.119 --> 01:30:56.045]  From efoodsdirect.com Call 800-409-5633 On the web efoodsdirect.com slash alex
[01:31:01.311 --> 01:31:06.295]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:31:06.295 --> 01:31:07.275]  What have we got?
[01:31:07.275 --> 01:31:09.737]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:31:09.737 --> 01:31:10.738]  A republic.
[01:31:10.738 --> 01:31:13.380]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:15.642]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:31:15.642 --> 01:31:17.663]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:31:17.663 --> 01:31:19.344]  So they think they own our land?
[01:31:19.344 --> 01:31:20.665]  They think they own our water?
[01:31:20.665 --> 01:31:21.286]  Children?
[01:31:21.286 --> 01:31:22.407]  Our education?
[01:31:22.407 --> 01:31:23.227]  Our money?
[01:31:23.227 --> 01:31:26.890]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:32.217]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:31:32.217 --> 01:31:33.238]  We have the facts.
[01:31:33.238 --> 01:31:34.400]  We have the Constitution.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:35.321]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:31:35.321 --> 01:31:36.202]  We have common law.
[01:31:36.202 --> 01:31:38.726]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:42.491]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:31:42.591 --> 01:31:47.555]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:31:47.555 --> 01:31:49.056]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:31:49.056 --> 01:31:50.136]  Don't tread on me.
[01:31:50.136 --> 01:31:56.501]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:32:01.024 --> 01:32:05.586]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:06.486]  Number 1.
[01:32:06.486 --> 01:32:09.927]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.927 --> 01:32:10.787]  Number 2.
[01:32:10.787 --> 01:32:15.669]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:16.409]  It's true.
[01:32:16.409 --> 01:32:21.291]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:21.291 --> 01:32:22.111]  Number 3.
[01:32:22.111 --> 01:32:25.693]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.693 --> 01:32:29.394]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.594 --> 01:32:30.394]  Number 4.
[01:32:30.394 --> 01:32:33.155]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:33.155 --> 01:32:36.836]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.836 --> 01:32:37.636]  Number 5.
[01:32:37.636 --> 01:32:41.777]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.777 --> 01:32:46.819]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.819 --> 01:32:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.781]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.781 --> 01:32:57.382]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:33:01.908 --> 01:33:06.955]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:11.833 --> 01:33:26.424]  I have a passion to warn people, but I'm also angry at these control freaks, these anointed ones, this scientific dictatorship, they're all collectivists, globalists, who openly say they want to wipe most of us out so they can have their own world government.
[01:33:26.424 --> 01:33:29.167]  And you better believe lithium in the water and viruses that...
[01:33:29.987 --> 01:33:37.253]  Attack your brain and attack the hormone uptake receptors so that you can't get angry and can't defend yourself.
[01:33:37.253 --> 01:33:39.915]  I mean, they're openly saying this.
[01:33:39.915 --> 01:33:43.357]  Oh, we're going to make you a kindler, gentler humanity.
[01:33:43.357 --> 01:33:45.039]  We're going to decide.
[01:33:45.039 --> 01:33:46.360]  No, I want my passion.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:48.061]  I want my strength.
[01:33:48.061 --> 01:33:51.764]  Okay, I don't want to be turned into a cowardly jellyfish.
[01:33:51.764 --> 01:33:53.165]  I want my anxiety.
[01:33:53.165 --> 01:33:54.826]  I'm supposed to have anxiety.
[01:33:54.826 --> 01:33:56.147]  Let me tell you, when I got up at 6 a.m.
[01:33:56.147 --> 01:33:58.329]  this morning, I jumped out of bed knowing this info.
[01:33:59.338 --> 01:33:59.719]  I don't know.
[01:34:15.157 --> 01:34:16.298]  Do this to your brain.
[01:34:16.298 --> 01:34:18.459]  And who knows what other tissues it's going to attack.
[01:34:18.459 --> 01:34:19.720]  But here's the London Telegraph.
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:25.624]  Flu jab linked to fits, that's what they call convulsions in England, in under fives, officials say.
[01:34:25.624 --> 01:34:35.351]  And it goes on to say, doctors have been told not to use a particular flu jab on 1,010 children under five after it was linked to a tenfold increase in fits.
[01:34:35.351 --> 01:34:36.092]  It can be revealed.
[01:34:36.892 --> 01:35:00.307]  Doctors should stock alternative vaccines that means doesn't have these adjuvants for under fives who are due to have the seasonal flu vaccine this winter a letter from the head of the Immunization and Department of Health has said so see the cover-ups unraveled in Australia and England the same things in Australia the action is being taken at a rate of convulsions caused by and then it goes on that was ten times higher than normal and
[01:35:01.317 --> 01:35:04.000]  A rate of convulsions ten times higher.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.543]  Dr. Blaylock, that's exactly what you've talked about here on air.
[01:35:07.543 --> 01:35:08.324]  That's right.
[01:35:08.324 --> 01:35:12.148]  And you'll remember, what did the CDC recommend?
[01:35:12.148 --> 01:35:17.854]  Well, the most important person to vaccinate is those under five, the very ones who got the seizures.
[01:35:18.474 --> 01:35:27.878]  And I told your audience that that's the ones that are going to be most susceptible to having seizures after this vaccine and having brain damage after this vaccine.
[01:35:27.878 --> 01:35:28.798]  They denied it.
[01:35:28.798 --> 01:35:30.139]  They said it was crazy.
[01:35:30.139 --> 01:35:31.739]  And look at them now.
[01:35:31.739 --> 01:35:33.660]  Now they're having to come with hat in hand.
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:37.041]  Oh, gee, we've created seizures in all these children.
[01:35:37.041 --> 01:35:39.822]  Be sure and don't give it.
[01:35:39.822 --> 01:35:42.884]  But I had the mechanism published in the medical literature.
[01:35:42.884 --> 01:35:43.984]  All they had to do is read it.
[01:35:44.961 --> 01:35:45.922]  But they wouldn't do it.
[01:35:45.922 --> 01:35:49.145]  They were so cocksured they had the answer to everything.
[01:35:49.145 --> 01:35:55.691]  Well, this is the problem with this collectivist, Gnostic idea of elitist running everything.
[01:35:55.691 --> 01:35:58.393]  They get a utopian vision in their mind.
[01:35:58.393 --> 01:36:00.235]  They see it so clearly.
[01:36:00.235 --> 01:36:05.159]  If they can just hammer people in the head and make them do it, we're going to enter utopia.
[01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:07.181]  And it turns into a nightmare.
[01:36:07.181 --> 01:36:10.945]  And then they fight to preserve the nightmare, and it becomes a worse nightmare.
[01:36:11.545 --> 01:36:13.307]  And this is what we're facing right now.
[01:36:13.307 --> 01:36:25.696]  Oh, they think if we could just redesign the human brain, God made it wrong, if we could just redesign it, people won't be violent, they won't want drugs, and they'll want to do what the government says.
[01:36:25.696 --> 01:36:28.458]  And so this is their vision.
[01:36:28.458 --> 01:36:29.819]  And they're fighting to do it.
[01:36:29.819 --> 01:36:37.185]  And anyone who says you shouldn't do that, you're destroying individuality, well, you're just a nut.
[01:36:37.185 --> 01:36:40.828]  There's something wrong with you that you would even think and resist.
[01:36:40.928 --> 01:36:41.989]  You're just a nut.
[01:36:41.989 --> 01:36:44.011]  You don't want to take mercury shots.
[01:36:44.011 --> 01:36:47.334]  You don't want to have lithium toxic put in your water to make you submit.
[01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:49.877]  You don't want to have viruses attack your brain.
[01:36:49.877 --> 01:36:52.239]  You're some kind of crazy person.
[01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:55.001]  But look, their front is they want to help us.
[01:36:55.001 --> 01:37:05.732]  As you know, when you read their literature, this is about dumbing us down and getting us ready for the next more intensified waves of stealth degenerative kill systems.
[01:37:06.508 --> 01:37:12.693]  Aldous Huxley wrote about it in his book Brave New World Revisited.
[01:37:12.693 --> 01:37:16.856]  It wasn't at least 50 years ago.
[01:37:16.856 --> 01:37:18.317]  He wrote it in great detail.
[01:37:18.317 --> 01:37:21.980]  Well, he knew what was going on and where we were headed.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:25.463]  Delgado wrote about it in his book.
[01:37:26.355 --> 01:37:29.198]  Uh, it was one of the world's greatest brain scientists.
[01:37:29.198 --> 01:37:40.667]  He wrote about it, uh, at least 30 or 40 years ago, saying where we were headed, that the last bastion of these people was to take away human individual thought.
[01:37:41.588 --> 01:38:06.965]  That's right, we're waking up, we're saying no to the government healthcare, we're saying no to the tyranny, we're saying no to the attack on the family, and their answer is to come out smugly, and it's not just a few of them, there's literally thousands of them and say, I mean the cover of Time Magazine every week is, the end of summer, you don't deserve to have your kids, it's bad to have children, abortion is good, euthanasia is good, I mean it's a culture of
[01:38:07.165 --> 01:38:07.445]  Yeah.
[01:38:24.918 --> 01:38:27.279]  Ugly, mentally ill scum!
[01:38:27.279 --> 01:38:42.524]  They are actually the psychopathic minority and more and more the science shows with computer modeling that the knowledge of the crowd, the knowledge of common sense is much more sane and accurate than what we get out of the so-called intellectuals.
[01:38:42.524 --> 01:38:43.204]  My mom...
[01:38:44.104 --> 01:38:50.325]  I was watching Jim Lehrer on some PBS thing about how the alternative media is taking over the mainstream media.
[01:38:50.325 --> 01:38:51.625]  And he said, that's okay.
[01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:59.627]  There'll still be intellectuals like us and journalists and all these little fake intellectuals who probably got IQs near room temperature.
[01:38:59.627 --> 01:39:05.768]  I found out these people are usually just total morons, but they still have that dominant instinct to take control of you.
[01:39:05.768 --> 01:39:11.629]  And they all just clapped and loved it and got creamy eyed looks in their faces that, yes, we're going to run it.
[01:39:12.049 --> 01:39:14.091]  You know, we're the bosses.
[01:39:14.091 --> 01:39:18.315]  In closing, what do you have to say, doctor, about the government takeover of healthcare?
[01:39:18.315 --> 01:39:21.739]  Because now they admit pre-existing conditions aren't covered.
[01:39:21.739 --> 01:39:23.721]  They are going to lower the standard of care.
[01:39:23.721 --> 01:39:28.846]  The bioethicist at the government, Rahm Emanuel's brother, there are going to be death panels.
[01:39:28.846 --> 01:39:30.467]  They are going to cut your care.
[01:39:30.467 --> 01:39:32.469]  You know, you don't need that eye surgery when you're 65.
[01:39:34.198 --> 01:39:44.406]  Well, all of that is exactly true, and we've heard these assurances that, oh, this isn't going to happen, oh, that's just a bunch of paranoia trying to scare you.
[01:39:44.406 --> 01:39:47.889]  Then after the bill passes, every one of those things happen.
[01:39:47.889 --> 01:39:51.072]  This has happened over and over and over.
[01:39:51.072 --> 01:39:53.714]  You remember the 1964 Civil Rights Act?
[01:39:53.714 --> 01:39:57.477]  It said in there specifically, no quotas shall be used.
[01:39:57.477 --> 01:40:01.280]  Well, it wasn't long after the bill was passed, quotas are used.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.081]  They're still used.
[01:40:03.114 --> 01:40:08.166]  Uh, so any assurance by these people is absolutely worthless.
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:17.207]  They intend absolute control over your life from A to Z. They control your children, the education you're in.
[01:40:17.207 --> 01:40:20.590]  This bill takes over all medical education.
[01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:34.322]  If you read it in detail, it says the Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop the curriculum for med schools, will appoint professors, will develop educational programs in dental schools, medical schools, nursing schools,
[01:40:35.122 --> 01:40:40.007]  I've got a Sunshine Project group of documents from a decade ago with the Army and Marines
[01:41:05.046 --> 01:41:05.406]  I think?
[01:41:27.401 --> 01:41:30.443]  Old-fashioned vaccines can cause sterility in humans.
[01:41:30.443 --> 01:41:34.245]  They actually suddenly now admit that, but don't worry.
[01:41:34.245 --> 01:41:51.514]  We're now going to laser beam it into you, into your cells itself, and we're going to test these vaccines that will help the troops behaviorally and physically, and we can give them hundreds of vaccines per laser injection.
[01:41:51.514 --> 01:41:54.896]  I mean, this is a nightmare dystopia, not a utopia.
[01:41:55.988 --> 01:42:00.292]  Exactly, and the very fact they're talking about putting vaccines in foods.
[01:42:00.292 --> 01:42:01.714]  That gives you no choice at all.
[01:42:01.714 --> 01:42:09.261]  You go to the supermarket, your fruits and vegetables and meats are filled with vaccines.
[01:42:09.261 --> 01:42:15.587]  This is the way they're vaccinating against diseases in animals in Europe.
[01:42:15.587 --> 01:42:16.428]  Rabies.
[01:42:16.428 --> 01:42:19.371]  They put it in the food, and they put it out for the animals to eat.
[01:42:24.086 --> 01:42:27.649]  And Bill Gates has now announced people won't take their vaccines.
[01:42:27.649 --> 01:42:38.037]  He's coming out with mosquitoes that are genetically engineered, that carry whatever vaccine they want to deliver, and the UN is working on bananas.
[01:42:38.817 --> 01:42:43.820]  To give to third-world populations because they're refusing the shots.
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:47.263]  The quote ignorant savages know they're being killed with this stuff.
[01:42:47.263 --> 01:42:55.348]  You go back 50 years ago, they would travel a hundred miles to see a white witch doctor, as they called them, because back then the medicine was good.
[01:42:55.348 --> 01:43:04.774]  Now they run, whether it's Asia or the Middle East or Africa or the villages, they run when the UN-funded trucks show up, Dr. Blaylock.
[01:43:05.214 --> 01:43:07.075]  Well, and they were smart to run them.
[01:43:07.075 --> 01:43:10.878]  I mean, you look at Nigeria when they came in with the polio vaccine.
[01:43:10.878 --> 01:43:12.719]  Oh, they were going to save them all from polio.
[01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:13.820]  They injected them.
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:19.183]  They produced a vaccine-induced polio epidemic in children and adults.
[01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:23.394]  And killed a number of people and left them paralyzed.
[01:43:23.394 --> 01:43:29.396]  Well, in their own publication, they admitted, oh yes, the vaccine was the cause of the epidemic.
[01:43:29.396 --> 01:43:32.236]  But now that we've caused it, we can't stop.
[01:43:32.236 --> 01:43:34.537]  We have to vaccinate even more people.
[01:43:34.537 --> 01:43:39.418]  Well, these people were hiding in the bush to keep from being vaccinated.
[01:43:39.418 --> 01:43:44.740]  And then the World Health Organization and the IMF used their pressure
[01:43:45.662 --> 01:43:52.801]  To say, have the government of Nigeria say, if you don't get vaccinated, we'll take your children away and put you in prison.
[01:43:53.802 --> 01:43:58.947]  Well, it's pretty much similar to the policy they want to implement in the United States as well.
[01:43:58.947 --> 01:44:02.049]  Well, I mean, that's the problem with government-run health care.
[01:44:02.049 --> 01:44:18.303]  In England, and you can pull this up, BBC, they're now putting newborns on list, basically probation, and at age two they start having physical meetings with them if their parents have, quote, bad DNA, if they were ever involved in crime.
[01:44:18.303 --> 01:44:20.305]  And I have the head of the Texas
[01:44:21.246 --> 01:44:26.709]  This is exactly what you read in the eugenics literature in the 1920s and 30s in this country.
[01:44:50.353 --> 01:44:55.057]  And you read it in the 30s in Nazi Germany.
[01:44:55.057 --> 01:44:56.858]  They used the same justification.
[01:44:56.858 --> 01:44:58.059]  Well that's what they announced here.
[01:44:58.059 --> 01:45:06.446]  They actually bragged that they're going to take over real MD, real Western medicine and replace it.
[01:45:06.446 --> 01:45:07.367]  We already see it with the troops.
[01:45:07.367 --> 01:45:13.551]  When they get hurt, they just give them Prozac and they're saying we're just going to give you shots that cure your brain.
[01:45:13.551 --> 01:45:17.655]  I mean, this is a hostile corporate takeover, isn't it?
[01:45:18.405 --> 01:45:19.506]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:45:19.506 --> 01:45:31.439]  This is a union of mega-industry, international industry and government, which is, you know, the new socialism.
[01:45:31.439 --> 01:45:34.262]  The old socialism was government would take over the company.
[01:45:34.262 --> 01:45:38.287]  Now the new socialism, no, we'll work together for the same utopian goal.
[01:45:40.004 --> 01:45:41.124]  So this is what you're seeing.
[01:45:41.124 --> 01:45:49.746]  International corporations are working with government to implement these draconian, totalitarian plans.
[01:45:49.746 --> 01:45:52.127]  Well, Dr. Blaylock, I'm not going to keep you any longer.
[01:45:52.127 --> 01:46:05.689]  We always appreciate it when you join us, but you have a lot of solutions, a lot of ways to at least partially reverse the toxicity that we've been exposed to, a lot of key information at BlaylockWellnessCenter.com.
[01:46:05.689 --> 01:46:08.190]  What are some of the things we'll find at the Blaylock Wellness Center?
[01:46:08.991 --> 01:46:11.312]  Well, it has the books I've published on this.
[01:46:11.312 --> 01:46:16.234]  The book, House and Nutrition Secret, has a chapter on fluoridation that people need to read.
[01:46:16.234 --> 01:46:24.278]  It goes through the whole history and the medical findings and the devious tactics that they've used.
[01:46:24.278 --> 01:46:25.778]  And it has some DVDs.
[01:46:25.778 --> 01:46:32.121]  I've done interviews, a lecture on nutrition and behavior.
[01:46:32.121 --> 01:46:35.042]  So it has a lot of material in there.
[01:46:35.042 --> 01:46:36.683]  You can link to my other website.
[01:46:37.487 --> 01:46:46.870]  Uh, which has the published papers I've written, the papers I've told you about, the immuno-excitotoxicity mechanism, uh, which, uh, are free access.
[01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:48.311]  You can have those.
[01:46:48.311 --> 01:47:06.257]  Well, Doctor, in closing, you know, what we've done here is, with our family doctors and with everyone, uh, Rob Dew has done this, uh, one of our camera guys, we just bring them your books, other scientists' and researchers' books, we bring them the medical literature, and we say, we're not vaccinating our children,
[01:47:06.977 --> 01:47:08.478]  And by the way, fluoride's deadly.
[01:47:08.478 --> 01:47:11.780]  Here is stuff written by top doctors.
[01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:14.801]  And you come back a month later and they're converted.
[01:47:14.801 --> 01:47:20.084]  You can't just sit there and say, oh, you know, the government's poisoning that to make me serve them.
[01:47:20.084 --> 01:47:23.366]  I mean, because they've been preconditioned that that's kooky.
[01:47:23.366 --> 01:47:31.290]  You bring them a stack of books and news articles promoting lithium in the water and promoting vaccines that re-engineer the brain, they will wake up.
[01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:32.691]  Well, my son fell, so I can't
[01:47:57.352 --> 01:47:59.854]  No, I understand you can't speak for somebody else who's got that going.
[01:47:59.854 --> 01:48:02.776]  The point is, it's important to have people see these.
[01:48:02.776 --> 01:48:03.797]  Yeah, it is.
[01:48:03.797 --> 01:48:10.922]  And, you know, I have a newsletter as well that updates things continuously.
[01:48:10.922 --> 01:48:16.165]  You can get it through my website, RussellBlaylockMD.com.
[01:48:16.165 --> 01:48:24.191]  But you can link to the newsletter, which comes out every month, and I update it with all sorts of new information.
[01:48:24.909 --> 01:48:31.713]  Well, I have to say, we've interviewed hundreds of doctors and scientists here, but you're one of the most informed and you have a lot of courage.
[01:48:31.713 --> 01:48:33.414]  And of course, you're just going off the facts.
[01:48:33.414 --> 01:48:42.420]  I mean, why is it called courage to know your fellow humans are being attacked and to not stand up and speak out against what's happening?
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:42.920]  Exactly.
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:44.902]  I mean, we have no other choice.
[01:48:44.902 --> 01:48:46.042]  This is the end of the game.
[01:48:46.042 --> 01:48:48.624]  You know, there's no more leeway.
[01:48:48.624 --> 01:48:51.726]  They think they want it and they're going to push hard.
[01:48:52.655 --> 01:48:57.520]  Unless we push back, we're going to lose everything and it's irreversible.
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:03.586]  You know, once they win and completely surprise us and change our brains, there's nothing we can do.
[01:49:03.586 --> 01:49:06.749]  So this is our last opportunity.
[01:49:06.749 --> 01:49:15.697]  And I push people to look into this nullification, get the book Nullification by Thomas Wood and read it.
[01:49:15.697 --> 01:49:16.378]  Our last hope.
[01:49:17.077 --> 01:49:17.657]  Absolutely.
[01:49:17.657 --> 01:49:24.282]  We also have a DVD that I'm in, put out by Gary Franchi and William Lewis, called Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:49:24.282 --> 01:49:32.887]  And it's really kind of a video version, similar to that book, with sheriffs and state reps and myself, how to take the sheriffs, the counties, the states back.
[01:49:32.887 --> 01:49:35.629]  And that's why the feds are moving so hard to block it.
[01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:37.650]  They understand that's their Achilles heel.
[01:49:37.650 --> 01:49:39.051]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:49:39.051 --> 01:49:40.092]  They should watch your tape.
[01:49:41.237 --> 01:49:43.658]  Well, Dr. Blaylock, you've been so helpful.
[01:49:43.658 --> 01:49:48.979]  I want to say bye to you during the break, and we'll let you go, but BlaylockWellnessCenter.com.
[01:49:48.979 --> 01:49:50.920]  It is so important for people to get that material.
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:54.141]  Also, get my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:49:54.141 --> 01:49:56.381]  As Dr. Blaylock said, this is the endgame.
[01:49:56.381 --> 01:49:58.262]  My film shows the globalist's own statements.
[01:49:59.022 --> 01:49:59.462]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:49:59.462 --> 01:50:00.903]  You know, that's the big plan.
[01:50:00.903 --> 01:50:02.565]  And that was the plan during the French Revolution.
[01:50:02.565 --> 01:50:03.505]  People don't know that.
[01:50:03.505 --> 01:50:07.548]  If you read the documents of the French Revolution, they had planned to destroy 80% of the population.
[01:50:27.158 --> 01:50:32.290]  Then the elitists would have all the land and all the farms and they'd rule.
[01:50:34.226 --> 01:50:36.087]  Yeah, they wanted a 10-day work week.
[01:50:36.087 --> 01:50:38.168]  They wanted to change it to like nine months a year.
[01:50:38.168 --> 01:50:41.750]  They wanted to end the family and basically raise humans.
[01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:47.913]  They described it as, you know, like taking children from their parents, like you take eggs from a hen.
[01:50:47.913 --> 01:50:52.936]  Orwell actually quoted the French Revolution, and they were crazy occultists who thought they were God.
[01:50:52.936 --> 01:50:54.737]  I mean, you can't make up history, folks.
[01:50:54.737 --> 01:50:58.339]  You can't make up stuff this weird, and they're poisoning your water and food.
[01:50:58.339 --> 01:50:59.800]  Dr. Blaylock, God bless you.
[01:51:03.749 --> 01:51:05.510]  What is a wind generator?
[01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:07.912]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[01:51:07.912 --> 01:51:11.254]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[01:51:11.254 --> 01:51:13.215]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?
[01:51:13.936 --> 01:51:17.819]  For answers to questions about wind power, visit windbluepower.com.

[01:52:02.065 --> 01:52:03.367]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:03.367 --> 01:52:08.954]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.954 --> 01:52:13.981]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.981 --> 01:52:19.007]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:19.528 --> 01:52:24.772]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:24.772 --> 01:52:27.073]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:27.073 --> 01:52:31.876]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:31.876 --> 01:52:32.997]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:32.997 --> 01:52:36.059]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:36.059 --> 01:52:39.702]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:39.702 --> 01:52:42.884]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:42.884 --> 01:52:45.105]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:52:49.668 --> 01:52:53.893]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:53.893 --> 01:52:58.739]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:58.739 --> 01:53:01.122]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:01.872 --> 01:53:10.075]  Gulf War vets, 9-11 workers, people around the Gulf oil spill fumes, all were exposed to toxic chemicals in the air and became ill.
[01:53:10.075 --> 01:53:12.735]  Even in your home, air contamination can make you sick.
[01:53:12.735 --> 01:53:20.198]  You have been exposed to airborne toxic particulate matter and volatile organic compounds causing fatigue, flu-like symptoms, or worse.
[01:53:20.198 --> 01:53:21.198]  Protect yourself.
[01:53:21.198 --> 01:53:23.479]  You cannot trust anyone to do it for you.

[01:54:17.283 --> 01:54:22.107]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am desperate to warn as many people as I can.
[01:54:22.107 --> 01:54:26.492]  You just heard Dr. Russell Blaylock, who is a top brain surgeon.
[01:54:26.492 --> 01:54:32.358]  He listed all these top toxicologists and scientists in the government saying this is mass killing.
[01:54:32.938 --> 01:54:33.118]  That's
[01:54:49.731 --> 01:54:51.753]  All of these Department of Defense documents.
[01:54:51.753 --> 01:54:54.575]  I interviewed the head of the Sunshine Project based here in Austin.
[01:54:54.575 --> 01:54:55.876]  It's kind of like WikiLeaks.
[01:54:55.876 --> 01:54:56.916]  More than a decade ago.
[01:54:56.916 --> 01:54:58.657]  And I was telling Dew about it.
[01:54:58.657 --> 01:55:07.364]  We pulled up all these documents last night that I'd seen years ago about helicopter bases sealed with knockout gases ready.
[01:55:08.084 --> 01:55:11.646]  They've got all the chemtrail pilots thinking they're doing weather modification.
[01:55:11.646 --> 01:55:23.913]  They can convert that anytime they want to spray these live viruses that literally go in and attack your brain and you wake up the next day with a headache and you can't get upset and you can't stand up for yourself and you can't get angry.
[01:55:23.913 --> 01:55:27.135]  That's what's in all the mainstream literature.
[01:55:27.135 --> 01:55:32.698]  They're going to give the troops vaccines to make them feel better, to change their brains.
[01:55:32.698 --> 01:55:36.741]  Jab that could put a stop to stress without slowing us down.
[01:55:37.987 --> 01:55:43.289]  You know, Mail Online, New York Times, instead of a shot, have a banana.
[01:55:43.289 --> 01:55:57.615]  And then meanwhile, all these drugs and vaccines they come out with are killing people, giving them cancer, sterilizing them, giving them tenfold increases in convulsions, in seizures, beyond fluoride, pharmaceuticals and drinking water, and the public.
[01:55:57.615 --> 01:56:00.536]  New York Times, the British Journal of Psychiatry,
[01:56:01.932 --> 01:56:05.235]  Saying, quote, we need to add lithium to the water.
[01:56:05.235 --> 01:56:09.378]  I mean, you cannot make this up!
[01:56:09.378 --> 01:56:12.420]  And they preemptively call us kooks if we don't want it!
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:15.743]  A bunch of control freaks telling you what they're going to put in your water.
[01:56:15.743 --> 01:56:18.044]  Now, here's the deal.
[01:56:18.044 --> 01:56:18.905]  We made a 15 minute video.
[01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:19.586]  A 15 minute video.
[01:56:23.919 --> 01:56:29.064]  That I shot last night and Rob Deuce said, when he was reading the documents with me, he said, I love my boys.
[01:56:29.064 --> 01:56:30.626]  I love my sons.
[01:56:30.626 --> 01:56:33.308]  He said, I'm going to, if it's all right, I'm not even going to sleep.
[01:56:33.308 --> 01:56:34.670]  I'm just going to stay here and do this.
[01:56:34.670 --> 01:56:37.072]  We've got to get this out now because he's normal.
[01:56:37.072 --> 01:56:38.173]  He's a warrior.
[01:56:38.173 --> 01:56:41.777]  He's a human who wants to protect his woman and his, his children.
[01:56:41.777 --> 01:56:46.542]  I mean, there's, I've got to control myself because at a primitive level,
[01:56:47.557 --> 01:56:52.749]  Yeah, I mean the normal response to this is somebody wants to shoot you up with something to brain damage you.
[01:56:52.749 --> 01:56:57.821]  If somebody's trying to inject you with, you know, cleaning fluid that's gonna kill you, you're gonna fight back against them.
[01:57:01.678 --> 01:57:19.389]  I mean, we're fighting the info war and trying to rally you, and I want to talk to every FBI agent, every police officer, every InfraGard officer, everybody that works in this system, all these eugenicists, all these scientists that think they're saving the earth by dumbing people down ahead of the mass culling.
[01:57:19.389 --> 01:57:30.376]  They first got to render you servile and drugged, so when they release the mega-plagues and start killing everybody, you've heard Dr. Pianka say, coming soon, and he got a standing ovation at the Texas Academy of Sciences.
[01:57:30.896 --> 01:57:33.117]  It went on for minutes, the paper reported.
[01:57:33.117 --> 01:57:33.637]  Remember that?
[01:57:33.637 --> 01:57:35.738]  We talked about it, it became national news.
[01:57:35.738 --> 01:57:39.319]  He goes to Europe and gets awards from the royalty over there.
[01:57:39.319 --> 01:57:47.782]  He projected red skulls on the wall on a PowerPoint and said, the time is coming when we will 90% die when the airborne Ebola comes.
[01:57:47.782 --> 01:57:50.522]  I am sad for my family, but it's good for the Earth.
[01:57:50.522 --> 01:57:51.863]  We will die.
[01:57:51.863 --> 01:57:53.683]  It is going to be beautiful.
[01:57:53.683 --> 01:57:57.985]  And standing ovation, oh, people, oh, yes, oh!
[01:57:58.425 --> 01:58:01.248]  The time of the control freak orgy is coming.
[01:58:01.248 --> 01:58:04.150]  The time of the mass death is coming.
[01:58:04.150 --> 01:58:09.315]  You heard Blaylock, Dr. Blaylock, saying this is worse than any science fiction nightmare you can imagine.
[01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:10.416]  It's real!
[01:58:10.416 --> 01:58:17.482]  And they've got the helicopters ready at the military bases with the viruses, and they fly over and spray you.
[01:58:17.482 --> 01:58:23.508]  We're not just going to be able to escape not taking the shots, or not eating their GMO pharmacological food that grows it live in it.
[01:58:24.537 --> 01:58:27.780]  They're getting ready to hit us, and I think they're already testing it.
[01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:30.022]  We know they're adding it to some of the vaccines.
[01:58:30.022 --> 01:58:33.424]  Just a mild lobotomy.
[01:58:33.424 --> 01:58:38.268]  Folks, they're hitting us hard, and they're hitting our kids, and they're attacking everybody.
[01:58:38.268 --> 01:58:39.890]  We're going to premiere this video coming up.
[01:58:39.890 --> 01:58:49.538]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[02:00:14.489 --> 02:00:18.695]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.695 --> 02:00:22.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.754 --> 02:00:36.877]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to premiere, this isn't out on YouTube, it's nowhere yet.
[02:00:36.877 --> 02:00:40.078]  It will be uploaded in the next hour, two hours at YouTube.
[02:00:40.078 --> 02:00:53.044]  We're going to premiere, we're going to premiere this new short film live on the radio and at PrisonPlanet.tv for streaming viewers coming up at 8 after.
[02:00:54.298 --> 02:00:58.081]  Now, I've done two hours without plugging sponsors or how we fund ourselves.
[02:00:58.081 --> 02:01:12.394]  So, ahead of this premiering, I want to tell you, you fund us, plus you get all the films in the highest quality, my book, Paul Watson's book, the simulcast, the radio show, 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, get a yearly membership, get three months free, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:01:12.394 --> 02:01:14.776]  And I want to thank all the members, you make it possible.
[02:01:14.776 --> 02:01:21.401]  Also, we sell t-shirts, books, bald caps, all my films, and all the other best videos and films out there, like
[02:01:22.282 --> 02:01:29.665]  The Secret of Oz and others, but for two weeks since they censored the Obama deception online, I offered four copies for $19.95.
[02:01:29.665 --> 02:01:32.766]  That's basically buy one, get three free.
[02:01:32.766 --> 02:01:34.627]  We suspended that special today.
[02:01:35.683 --> 02:01:44.128]  It may come back, but not for a while, because it's a way for you to get the film and have three beautiful color covers, you know, with the expanded extras to give people.
[02:01:44.128 --> 02:01:54.694]  We're offering Invisible Empire, our newest and most high-budget documentary about the history of the New World Order, their goals, who they are, the admissions of world government, by Jason Burmess, four copies for $19.95.
[02:01:56.789 --> 02:02:00.751]  Buy one, get three free, is basically what it comes out to.
[02:02:00.751 --> 02:02:04.593]  Or buy two, get eight free.
[02:02:04.593 --> 02:02:06.714]  $39.95 for ten copies.
[02:02:06.714 --> 02:02:10.737]  These are with the beautiful color cover, with the DVD, the extras.
[02:02:10.737 --> 02:02:13.478]  People are more apt to watch it when it looks like this.
[02:02:13.478 --> 02:02:14.339]  Give it to them.
[02:02:14.339 --> 02:02:18.061]  Four copies, $19.95, or for less than four bucks a piece,
[02:02:19.529 --> 02:02:21.410]  $39.95 for 10 copies.
[02:02:21.410 --> 02:02:23.691]  Same thing with Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[02:02:23.691 --> 02:02:33.154]  The entire architecture of their takeover, their FEMA camps, their federalization of police, how the executive orders, the forced inoculations, the naked body scanners.
[02:02:33.154 --> 02:02:34.714]  I haven't made one of these in eight years.
[02:02:34.714 --> 02:02:35.755]  All that knowledge is here.
[02:02:36.752 --> 02:02:38.533]  Four copies, $19.95.
[02:02:38.533 --> 02:02:39.794]  Ten copies, $39.95.
[02:02:39.794 --> 02:02:42.015]  Okay?
[02:02:42.015 --> 02:02:44.297]  Buy one, get three free.
[02:02:44.297 --> 02:02:45.998]  Buy two, get eight free.
[02:02:45.998 --> 02:02:47.339]  And we've got mix-and-matchers.
[02:02:47.339 --> 02:02:50.641]  I've got a bunch of my other films for a limited time.
[02:02:50.641 --> 02:02:53.002]  This will go away in two weeks.
[02:02:53.002 --> 02:02:55.644]  In two weeks, this deal is gone.
[02:02:55.644 --> 02:02:56.525]  And you can get them now.
[02:02:56.525 --> 02:02:57.605]  Give them to people for Christmas.
[02:02:57.605 --> 02:02:58.146]  Whatever.
[02:02:58.146 --> 02:02:59.246]  Unlock a mind.
[02:02:59.246 --> 02:03:00.007]  Sure, you're awake.
[02:03:00.007 --> 02:03:01.027]  You know what's going on.
[02:03:01.027 --> 02:03:03.229]  But your friends, your family don't.
[02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:04.650]  You can get Fall of the Republic.
[02:03:05.623 --> 02:03:07.844]  One copy, get three free.
[02:03:07.844 --> 02:03:10.106]  Two copies, get eight free.

[02:03:59.296 --> 02:03:59.976]  It's always been in here.
[02:03:59.976 --> 02:04:02.497]  I wanted to show people that.
[02:04:02.497 --> 02:04:03.477]  Oh, here it is.
[02:04:03.477 --> 02:04:03.877]  Here it is.

[02:04:33.765 --> 02:04:35.686]  I'm scared to even cut my hairs with this sucker.
[02:04:35.686 --> 02:04:38.406]  I cut myself last week even testing it out.
[02:04:38.406 --> 02:04:39.846]  They've got them all.
[02:04:39.846 --> 02:04:41.067]  And what's a free man have?

[02:05:35.429 --> 02:05:39.832]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[02:05:39.832 --> 02:05:45.175]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms must be escaped.
[02:05:45.175 --> 02:05:49.018]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disaster.

[02:06:58.639 --> 02:07:00.360]  This information is too important to wait.
[02:07:05.481 --> 02:07:06.742]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:06.742 --> 02:07:10.665]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:10.665 --> 02:07:12.907]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:12.907 --> 02:07:18.771]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:18.771 --> 02:07:25.016]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:25.436 --> 02:07:31.421]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:31.421 --> 02:07:35.605]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:35.605 --> 02:07:39.889]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:39.889 --> 02:07:45.834]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:45.834 --> 02:07:49.397]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:49.397 --> 02:07:51.358]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:51.358 --> 02:07:51.799]  It's here.
[02:07:52.439 --> 02:08:00.361]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:00.361 --> 02:08:07.342]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[02:08:07.342 --> 02:08:11.423]  Some men you just can't reach.
[02:08:11.423 --> 02:08:16.644]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[02:08:16.644 --> 02:08:17.884]  Well, he gets it.
[02:08:21.003 --> 02:08:26.855]  I don't like it any more than you do.
[02:08:26.855 --> 02:08:29.501]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:29.501 --> 02:08:30.924]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.727 --> 02:08:38.349]  This is about a bunch of control freaks, criminals who want the planet to themselves.
[02:08:38.349 --> 02:08:43.290]  Poisoning the water and food to make you passive and servile and brain damaged.
[02:08:43.290 --> 02:08:50.493]  Ahead of engineered mass plagues that will wipe most of us off the planet, the UN says between 80 and 90 percent.
[02:08:50.493 --> 02:08:53.414]  We Are Change talked to David Rothschild.
[02:08:53.414 --> 02:08:59.776]  He admitted he knows who We Are Change is and who we are, and that the world population will be reduced.
[02:09:00.356 --> 02:09:02.939]  He said that's just the way it is.
[02:09:02.939 --> 02:09:06.082]  That incredible video is up at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:06.082 --> 02:09:12.469]  But at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to news blitz through economic news, depression news, military war news.
[02:09:12.469 --> 02:09:17.253]  It's all coming up in a jam-packed news blitz in the last half hour of this hour.
[02:09:17.253 --> 02:09:18.895]  But right now, I want to premiere.
[02:09:18.895 --> 02:09:20.176]  This has never been seen.
[02:09:20.176 --> 02:09:21.298]  I shot this last night.
[02:09:22.521 --> 02:09:27.109]  And Rob Deuce stayed up and just finished it minutes ago, in the last 20 minutes.
[02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:30.255]  The name of the video is Media Pushes.
[02:09:31.434 --> 02:09:33.936]  Brain-eating vaccines.
[02:09:33.936 --> 02:09:36.698]  I wanna get the plebes out there to watch this.
[02:09:36.698 --> 02:09:39.579]  I want them to understand, because that's what it does.
[02:09:39.579 --> 02:09:44.222]  It goes in and attacks the brain cells and kills the receptor sites.
[02:09:44.222 --> 02:09:49.846]  And this video is premiering now, right now, in the live PrisonPlanet.tv streams.
[02:09:49.846 --> 02:09:52.428]  The radio listeners, of course, will be able to hear the audio.
[02:09:52.428 --> 02:09:59.673]  And in the next hour, it'll be posted at the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube and archived at PrisonPlanet.tv in the highest quality.
[02:10:00.293 --> 02:10:03.855]  So this is key information to get out to everyone.
[02:10:03.855 --> 02:10:05.917]  And remember, this is documented fact.
[02:10:05.917 --> 02:10:07.738]  This is now happening.
[02:10:07.738 --> 02:10:08.999]  This is not a joke.
[02:10:08.999 --> 02:10:10.019]  This is not a game.
[02:10:10.019 --> 02:10:12.181]  This is full spectrum dominance.
[02:10:12.181 --> 02:10:15.143]  This is a military attack on you and your family.
[02:10:15.583 --> 02:10:18.485]  But they've learned to not friendly assault you with tanks and guns.
[02:10:18.485 --> 02:10:25.788]  They do it through the medical system, through the school system, and most people serving the system don't even realize that they're under attack as well.
[02:10:25.788 --> 02:10:28.229]  They don't even realize how serious this is.
[02:10:28.229 --> 02:10:32.632]  So here is the 15-minute video premiering here.
[02:10:32.632 --> 02:10:38.495]  Media pushes brain-eating vaccines to create lobotomized population.
[02:10:38.495 --> 02:10:38.915]  Here it is.
[02:10:44.264 --> 02:10:55.194]  My friends, please pay attention to the information I'm about to cover and research the links that we'll post below this video so that you understand none of this is my opinion, it is fact.
[02:10:55.194 --> 02:10:58.296]  This issue is the most important issue going on in the world.
[02:10:58.296 --> 02:11:01.139]  It is scientific tyranny.
[02:11:01.139 --> 02:11:10.027]  I've read literally hundreds of government white papers and documents and books like Ecoscience where the White House science czar talks about forcibly drugging the water to dumb you down and sterilize you.
[02:11:11.294 --> 02:11:25.061]  But now they're in the New York Times and Time Magazine and everywhere and all the major medical journals promoting not only drugging the water with lithium, which by the way they're already doing, but now they're announcing it, to make you servile.
[02:11:26.837 --> 02:11:33.040]  But now they are admitting that they plan to deploy something I learned about a decade ago.
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:36.202]  Hundreds of different vaccines.
[02:11:36.202 --> 02:11:50.310]  They're really biological re-engineering live viruses that they inject into your body and the live viruses go in and attack your brain.
[02:11:50.310 --> 02:11:52.331]  And they claim, oh, it's to stop drug addiction.
[02:11:53.837 --> 02:12:00.620]  Those same receptor sites that pick up opiates and nicotine and alcohol pick up your normal endorphins.
[02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:02.782]  It's part of being a normal human being.
[02:12:02.782 --> 02:12:04.382]  Those drugs mimic that.
[02:12:04.382 --> 02:12:10.145]  And the viruses attack those receptor sites and kill them and create dead tissue.
[02:12:10.145 --> 02:12:15.388]  It is a vaccine-induced live virus lobotomy.
[02:12:16.755 --> 02:12:21.738]  Now, they've been promoting this for cigarette addiction, alcohol, addiction to heroin, cocaine.
[02:12:21.738 --> 02:12:26.400]  Now, they're coming out and saying the American people and the people of the world are sick.
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:34.605]  And major medical journals are saying we need to give everybody these shots to make them feel better, to stop having anxiety, to stop being angry.
[02:12:35.512 --> 02:12:49.683]  In other words, to take away your instinct for self-preservation, your will to survive, to make you accept all the bad things that are happening, to turn you into a biological android, a type of zombie.
[02:12:49.683 --> 02:12:51.605]  You cannot make this up.
[02:12:53.117 --> 02:12:55.520]  Please, send this video to everyone you know.
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:58.964]  For God's sakes, understand how serious this is.
[02:12:58.964 --> 02:13:03.549]  This is a global, scientific, corporate takeover of life itself.
[02:13:03.549 --> 02:13:09.576]  The globalists aren't just re-engineering corn and wheat and every other major crop, and engineering steroids into them.
[02:13:09.576 --> 02:13:10.076]  Suddenly,
[02:13:10.837 --> 02:13:16.739]  All over the news they're promoting lithium and Prozac and other drugs in the water.
[02:13:16.739 --> 02:13:28.203]  Head bioethicist at Cambridge, they're the people that advise and set medical policy for doctors, are announcing they want to force drug you and they're calling it cognitive enhancement.
[02:13:28.203 --> 02:13:33.045]  I've got a CBS news piece where they say that mercury helps your intelligence.
[02:13:33.045 --> 02:13:34.866]  What everyone knows it causes brain damage.
[02:13:35.166 --> 02:13:41.769]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:13:41.769 --> 02:13:47.212]  So when they say cognitive enhancement, they mean cognitive brain damage.
[02:13:47.212 --> 02:13:52.215]  They mean taking your essence, literally your psyche, who you are away.
[02:13:52.975 --> 02:13:57.277]  And they sit up there saying, well, if we put Prozac in the water, it'll cut suicide.
[02:13:57.277 --> 02:14:01.119]  When it's admitted that Prozac on its insert can cause suicide.
[02:14:01.119 --> 02:14:12.105]  I have mainstream news articles that have just come out in the last few days in England, where people have a tenfold increase in convulsions, and they develop epilepsy after the flu shot.
[02:14:12.105 --> 02:14:20.069]  I talked to top scientists who studied the flu shot last year and found bizarre viral RNA in it that deals with the brain.
[02:14:20.689 --> 02:14:29.935]  I've had top brain surgeons on, like Dr. Russell Blaylock, to talk about this, and the government documents that he's read, how this is part of a eugenics population control program.
[02:14:29.935 --> 02:14:31.416]  I mean, here it is!
[02:14:31.416 --> 02:14:32.577]  London Telegraph.
[02:14:32.577 --> 02:14:35.719]  Flu jab linked to fits and under 5s.
[02:14:35.719 --> 02:14:44.025]  And it goes on to say they've been told not to give children 110,000 in England under 5 the shot, because they had convulsions at 10 times the regular rate.
[02:14:45.071 --> 02:14:47.653]  Lindsay Lohan isn't what matters.
[02:14:47.653 --> 02:14:49.915]  Mel Gibson isn't what matters.
[02:14:49.915 --> 02:14:51.496]  The Depression doesn't even matter.
[02:14:51.496 --> 02:14:56.940]  War with Iran is not even that important, compared to a medical dictatorship.
[02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:08.609]  And under the National Health Service in England, and now National Health Care here in the U.S., they're slashing regular health care, like cancer surgery, or having a broken leg fixed, and converting it over to psychiatry.
[02:15:08.609 --> 02:15:11.912]  And this biological warfare, or biopsychiatry,
[02:15:12.352 --> 02:15:15.434]  Where they say, don't worry about drugs anymore for your depression.
[02:15:15.434 --> 02:15:22.739]  We're going to give you a shot that alters your brain by viruses literally attacking your brain.
[02:15:22.739 --> 02:15:29.283]  And they're rolling it out in public trials, over a hundred of these vaccines right now.
[02:15:29.283 --> 02:15:32.465]  And they're clearly spiking other vaccines with it.
[02:15:32.465 --> 02:15:40.911]  If you love your children, if you love your family, you've got to realize this is a creeping, scientific, incremental, soft kill system.
[02:15:40.911 --> 02:15:42.192]  Let's go over some of these articles.
[02:15:43.332 --> 02:15:47.834]  Jab that could put a stop to stress without slowing us down.
[02:15:47.834 --> 02:15:49.655]  And it says they're going to make humans better.
[02:15:49.655 --> 02:15:52.796]  They've re-engineered potatoes and corn.
[02:15:52.796 --> 02:15:55.217]  Why not just re-engineer humans?
[02:15:55.217 --> 02:16:00.439]  And they quote all these major medical journals saying how great it is.
[02:16:00.439 --> 02:16:04.480]  And they say this could change society, the professor said.
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:10.703]  And they have a government-funded Stanford team with these neuroprotective viruses.
[02:16:11.423 --> 02:16:22.429]  And this particular vaccine, one of hundreds, is a live herpes virus engineered to only eat certain key brain tissue.
[02:16:22.429 --> 02:16:23.150]  What's wrong?
[02:16:23.150 --> 02:16:24.771]  Nothing, nothing really.
[02:16:24.771 --> 02:16:26.492]  I just feel like I need something stronger.
[02:16:28.172 --> 02:16:31.676]  If you have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
[02:16:31.676 --> 02:16:32.877]  Yes, thank you.
[02:16:32.877 --> 02:16:33.958]  I'll be alright.
[02:16:33.958 --> 02:16:35.920]  Call 348... They're not asking you.
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:37.261]  They're just rolling it out.
[02:16:37.261 --> 02:16:43.907]  And this isn't like some drug that they give people for a decade that causes hundreds of thousands of women to have deformed children.
[02:16:44.548 --> 02:16:48.471]  This isn't some drug that just makes one person, you know, have a heart attack.
[02:16:48.471 --> 02:16:51.293]  All these other recall drugs, these aren't even drugs.
[02:16:51.293 --> 02:17:01.040]  These are genetically engineered nanotech viruses that go in and turn you into a servile biological android.
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:02.501]  Do you understand?
[02:17:02.501 --> 02:17:10.146]  The vaccines that they're rolling out are live virus bioweapons that re-engineer your brain.
[02:17:11.067 --> 02:17:21.655]  You've seen the reports where all over the world, Asia, Africa, Latin America, Central Asia, they give children UN-sanctioned polio shots.
[02:17:21.655 --> 02:17:25.418]  And the children come down with weaponized polio and die.
[02:17:25.418 --> 02:17:28.480]  And the government admits, oh, it was an accident with that vaccine.
[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:33.704]  People are now waking up to the fact that the vaccines are causing convulsions and brain damage and cancer.
[02:17:33.704 --> 02:17:34.965]  And so what's their answer?
[02:17:34.965 --> 02:17:37.107]  They're coming out and saying, don't worry.
[02:17:37.107 --> 02:17:39.449]  Instead of a shot, have a banana.
[02:17:40.657 --> 02:17:41.477]  They're coming out.
[02:17:41.477 --> 02:17:46.359]  Nobel laureate scientist defines future vaccines as food.
[02:17:46.359 --> 02:17:58.124]  They're pharmacological crops that grow the live virus, whether it gives you cancer or gives you polio or literally sends viruses in to eat parts of your brain.
[02:17:58.124 --> 02:17:59.525]  It's all being done.
[02:17:59.525 --> 02:18:05.027]  Bill Gates is coming out with a biologically engineered mosquito to forcibly deliver vaccines to you.
[02:18:05.727 --> 02:18:07.368]  There's new drug discovery going on.
[02:18:07.368 --> 02:18:13.289]  Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase 3 trial that starts in a couple months.
[02:18:13.289 --> 02:18:17.210]  And that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective.
[02:18:17.210 --> 02:18:21.731]  And most sickeningly, over and over again they claim, oh, it's to make you not depressed anymore.
[02:18:21.731 --> 02:18:22.951]  All of you have problems.
[02:18:22.951 --> 02:18:24.492]  You shouldn't be upset about things.
[02:18:24.492 --> 02:18:28.133]  No, we're meant to get upset at a biological level and say no to this tyranny.
[02:18:29.113 --> 02:18:33.197]  And so they're coming out saying, oh, we're going to re-engineer your brain, cognitive enhancements.
[02:18:33.197 --> 02:18:34.979]  We're going to help you.
[02:18:34.979 --> 02:18:39.483]  The mercury's helping your brain on newscasts all over the country.
[02:18:39.483 --> 02:18:42.706]  Oh, the convulsions are helping you.
[02:18:42.706 --> 02:18:46.129]  Oh, lithium, a toxic metal that they want to put in the water.
[02:18:46.129 --> 02:18:48.051]  It's helping you.
[02:18:48.051 --> 02:18:51.013]  You're going to feel much better after all of this is done.
[02:18:51.013 --> 02:18:52.635]  What's wrong?
[02:18:56.203 --> 02:18:59.545]  They're not coming for us, they're already here.
[02:18:59.545 --> 02:19:01.045]  We're in danger.
[02:19:01.045 --> 02:19:10.890]  Many of you who have a child who seems to be dumbed down and isn't as smart as anybody else in your family, and something's wrong with them, it's the vaccines, it's the GMO food.
[02:19:10.890 --> 02:19:18.594]  Many of you who had an 18-month-old baby who was healthy and happy, they take that third round of shots, they have a convulsion that night, and they never talk again.
[02:19:18.594 --> 02:19:25.137]  They're turning you into servile minions who will do whatever you're told and who can't get angry and can't resist.
[02:19:25.737 --> 02:19:27.298]  Why do they want lithium in the water?
[02:19:27.298 --> 02:19:29.039]  They admit to make you submit.
[02:19:29.039 --> 02:19:31.181]  What does sodium fluoride in all the studies do?
[02:19:31.181 --> 02:19:32.702]  Make you submit.
[02:19:32.702 --> 02:19:34.223]  And what do these vaccines do?
[02:19:34.223 --> 02:19:35.624]  They make you passive.
[02:19:35.624 --> 02:19:37.205]  They make you unable to get angry.
[02:19:37.205 --> 02:19:37.506]  Okay.
[02:19:37.506 --> 02:19:42.169]  We're going to come back and finish up the video when we come out of break.
[02:19:42.169 --> 02:19:44.951]  And you guessed it, we're going to do a search term today.
[02:19:44.951 --> 02:19:50.455]  We're going to do a search term, and I'll tell you that search term after the video.
[02:19:50.455 --> 02:19:51.156]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:55.515 --> 02:19:59.741]  I bet you can guess the search term.
[02:19:59.741 --> 02:20:04.326]  Brain-eating vaccines.
[02:20:04.326 --> 02:20:05.548]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:05.548 --> 02:20:08.071]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:08.071 --> 02:20:08.712]  Gun sales are on a
[02:20:09.947 --> 02:20:17.172]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:20:17.172 --> 02:20:21.556]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:20:21.556 --> 02:20:31.803]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:20:32.063 --> 02:20:33.704]  Under any circumstance.
[02:20:33.704 --> 02:20:40.926]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:20:40.926 --> 02:20:41.586]  But listen up.
[02:20:41.586 --> 02:20:47.867]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:20:47.867 --> 02:20:49.708]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:49.708 --> 02:20:51.869]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:51.869 --> 02:20:52.369]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:20:52.369 --> 02:20:54.249]  Before they come for your guns.
[02:20:54.249 --> 02:20:54.849]  Hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:54.849 --> 02:20:55.430]  Right now.
[02:21:02.352 --> 02:21:07.316]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:21:07.316 --> 02:21:08.296]  What have we got?
[02:21:08.296 --> 02:21:10.438]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:21:10.438 --> 02:21:11.759]  A republic.
[02:21:11.759 --> 02:21:14.401]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:21:14.401 --> 02:21:16.683]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:21:16.683 --> 02:21:18.704]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:21:18.704 --> 02:21:20.385]  So they think they own our land?
[02:21:20.385 --> 02:21:21.706]  They think they own our water?
[02:21:21.706 --> 02:21:22.307]  Children?
[02:21:22.307 --> 02:21:23.428]  Our education?
[02:21:23.428 --> 02:21:24.268]  Our money?
[02:21:24.268 --> 02:21:27.931]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:21:28.271 --> 02:21:31.976]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:21:31.976 --> 02:21:33.238]  You're being warned!
[02:21:33.238 --> 02:21:34.279]  We have the facts.
[02:21:34.279 --> 02:21:35.421]  We have the Constitution.
[02:21:35.421 --> 02:21:36.342]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:21:36.342 --> 02:21:37.223]  We have common law.
[02:21:37.223 --> 02:21:39.747]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:39.747 --> 02:21:42.711]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:21:42.711 --> 02:21:43.532]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:21:43.632 --> 02:21:48.578]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:21:48.578 --> 02:21:50.080]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:51.181]  Don't tread on me.
[02:21:51.181 --> 02:21:57.589]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:22:02.395 --> 02:22:05.158]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[02:22:05.158 --> 02:22:07.200]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:08.101]  debt crises.
[02:22:08.101 --> 02:22:09.142]  You heard me right.
[02:22:09.142 --> 02:22:11.624]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[02:22:11.624 --> 02:22:15.288]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[02:22:15.288 --> 02:22:22.135]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[02:22:22.635 --> 02:22:23.895]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:23.895 --> 02:22:31.098]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[02:22:31.098 --> 02:22:38.500]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:42.863]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[02:22:42.863 --> 02:22:44.944]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[02:22:44.944 --> 02:22:47.125]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[02:22:47.125 --> 02:22:49.207]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[02:22:49.207 --> 02:22:49.487]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:02.591 --> 02:23:06.132]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:23:06.132 --> 02:23:08.413]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:23:08.413 --> 02:23:09.293]  Don't!
[02:23:09.293 --> 02:23:12.715]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:23:12.715 --> 02:23:21.818]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[02:23:21.818 --> 02:23:25.479]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:23:25.879 --> 02:23:29.023]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:23:29.023 --> 02:23:36.391]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:23:36.391 --> 02:23:37.592]  Herb K was right.
[02:23:37.592 --> 02:23:40.616]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:23:40.776 --> 02:23:42.057]  What do you have to lose?
[02:23:42.057 --> 02:23:43.258]  Stop the calls now.
[02:23:43.258 --> 02:23:45.220]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[02:23:45.220 --> 02:23:48.544]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[02:23:48.544 --> 02:23:48.864]  Call 800-405-7850.
[02:23:48.864 --> 02:23:49.244]  That's 800-405-7850.
[02:23:49.244 --> 02:23:49.284]  800-405-7850.
[02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:14.685]  They're turning you into servile minions who will do whatever you're told and who can't get angry and can't resist.
[02:24:14.685 --> 02:24:16.246]  Why do they want lithium in the water?
[02:24:16.246 --> 02:24:17.988]  They admit to make you submit.
[02:24:17.988 --> 02:24:20.129]  What does sodium fluoride in all the studies do?
[02:24:20.129 --> 02:24:21.650]  Make you submit.
[02:24:21.650 --> 02:24:23.172]  And what do these vaccines do?
[02:24:23.172 --> 02:24:24.573]  They make you passive.
[02:24:24.573 --> 02:24:26.094]  They make you unable to get angry.
[02:24:26.574 --> 02:24:30.415]  Anger is a propulsion system to make you stand up for your species.
[02:24:30.415 --> 02:24:37.017]  This is a hostile corporate takeover of the very genetic code of not just the plants and animals, but humanity itself.
[02:24:37.017 --> 02:24:41.999]  It is the most diabolical, covert operation ever seen.
[02:24:41.999 --> 02:24:45.080]  And now these people are out in the open.
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:46.621]  It's admitted.
[02:24:46.621 --> 02:24:47.943]  Do you understand?
[02:24:47.943 --> 02:24:48.844]  It's admitted.
[02:24:48.844 --> 02:24:54.372]  They want to make these shots mandatory in public schools to make you servile.
[02:24:54.372 --> 02:24:56.715]  Oh, but you don't want to become addicted to drugs.
[02:24:56.715 --> 02:24:58.157]  What do you think drugs mimic?
[02:24:58.157 --> 02:25:03.364]  They mimic natural chemicals in the brain that stir creativity and anger and
[02:25:03.744 --> 02:25:05.765]  Love and everything else.
[02:25:05.765 --> 02:25:07.547]  It's those key receptors.
[02:25:07.547 --> 02:25:17.433]  They're literally going for the soul of man that is in the beautiful, detailed, complex computer that is the human mind.
[02:25:17.433 --> 02:25:19.294]  This is a hack against the human mind.
[02:25:19.634 --> 02:25:23.355]  A hack against the human soul and we must stand up and resist it.
[02:25:23.355 --> 02:25:29.477]  They realize there's a worldwide revolt against this technocracy, against dehumanization.
[02:25:29.477 --> 02:25:36.200]  You need to become educated on these facts and join the resistance against this scientific dictatorship.
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:40.901]  Now is the time to realize that history is taking place right now.
[02:25:40.901 --> 02:25:45.923]  That we're living in the 21st century and a scientific tyranny has taken over.
[02:25:47.697 --> 02:25:49.734]  If we are successful in defeating these people.
[02:25:51.089 --> 02:25:56.113]  Historians will look back on this time as the greatest covert genocide in history.
[02:25:56.113 --> 02:26:02.418]  They will look back on it as the ultimate example of pure evil and corruption.
[02:26:02.418 --> 02:26:03.960]  This creeping death.
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:07.883]  Now I've warned the public, and I will continue to detail what's happening.
[02:26:07.883 --> 02:26:17.611]  In areas where lithium in trace amounts is in the drinking water, there seems to be a lower level of suicidality, and in the Texas counties that were studied, there's actually lower crime rates.
[02:26:17.731 --> 02:26:29.015]  And how these enemies come out and talk in their simpering, lisping tones real softly to coax you and advertise all this death and dehumanization as if it's good.
[02:26:29.015 --> 02:26:35.437]  The theory is that very low or trace amounts of lithium enhance connectivity between neurons.
[02:26:35.437 --> 02:26:39.919]  And doing that over the course of a lifetime, a lifetime exposure, makes the brain more healthy.
[02:26:41.764 --> 02:26:49.992]  Now I want to talk to the social engineers whose religion is a control freak system of dehumanization.
[02:26:49.992 --> 02:26:51.213]  You are like cancer.
[02:26:51.213 --> 02:26:53.014]  You're racing through the body politic.
[02:26:53.014 --> 02:26:55.076]  You think you're invincible.
[02:26:55.076 --> 02:26:56.418]  And you may kill the host.
[02:26:56.418 --> 02:26:58.560]  You may destroy our species.
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:00.241]  But not without a fight.
[02:27:00.241 --> 02:27:04.865]  You are disgusting, wicked people who love ruling over others.
[02:27:04.865 --> 02:27:06.627]  Everything you do creates death and destruction.
[02:27:06.752 --> 02:27:09.475]  There's three or four minutes left of this 15 minute video.
[02:27:09.475 --> 02:27:11.838]  We're going to go to break and come back and play the rest of it.
[02:27:11.838 --> 02:27:15.161]  And again, we just decided to shoot this video last night.
[02:27:15.161 --> 02:27:18.505]  We just finished it in the last hour or so.
[02:27:18.505 --> 02:27:25.292]  It's premiering here, but in the next hour and a half, it's going to go live at the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:27:25.292 --> 02:27:26.333]  And the title of it is...
[02:27:27.529 --> 02:27:31.091]  Media pushes brain-eating vaccines.
[02:27:31.091 --> 02:27:40.315]  Paul Watson is racing to just get a basic blurb up right now that he's going to expand on and then post the video in in the next hour and a half.
[02:27:40.315 --> 02:27:42.056]  But we've already launched the search term.
[02:27:42.916 --> 02:27:48.961]  And so in the next 10 minutes, it's going live, the article, the blurb, up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:27:48.961 --> 02:27:59.190]  Get that article, and that link will be expanded on, but we're doing this in real time, so that the number one search term will be brain-eating vaccine.
[02:27:59.750 --> 02:28:25.325]  And then everyone will start investigating that these cognitive enhancer vaccines, just like the heavy metals of mercury and lithium, actually brain damages you, and that's the globalist joke of enhancement, and that these viruses in the vaccine go in and attack the receptors for the hormones that we have that make us angry and stressed as they try to destroy our self-preservation instincts and our capacity.
[02:28:25.325 --> 02:28:26.766]  What does Howard Beals say in Network?
[02:28:27.642 --> 02:28:28.903]  First, you've got to get mad!
[02:28:28.903 --> 02:28:30.804]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[02:28:30.804 --> 02:28:32.565]  My life has value!
[02:28:32.565 --> 02:28:38.489]  You don't have a right to force drug us and to change our brain chemistry and to send viruses into our brain.
[02:28:38.489 --> 02:28:40.871]  But that's what forced inoculation is all about.
[02:28:40.871 --> 02:28:49.217]  So the search term that we're going to make number one today, and Google will censor it after a few hours, but by then, hundreds of blogs and publications will go write about it.
[02:28:49.217 --> 02:28:55.361]  They'll go look at the video that we're going to post to the YouTube Alex Jones channel and back it up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:28:55.361 --> 02:28:56.522]  But it just premiered here.
[02:28:57.222 --> 02:29:00.645]  And people keep telling me that they want us to do more of these search terms.
[02:29:00.645 --> 02:29:08.772]  We're going to launch in the next month and a half a social network website and we're going to allow you every week to vote up
[02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:16.194]  Whatever search terms you want me to put out live on air, I'm gonna actually put this power directly in your hands.
[02:29:16.194 --> 02:29:18.375]  Because you're the ones that have the power to begin with.
[02:29:18.375 --> 02:29:21.276]  You're the reason we're able to make this the number one search term.
[02:29:21.276 --> 02:29:24.218]  Brain eating vaccines.
[02:29:24.218 --> 02:29:27.280]  Brain eating vaccines.
[02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:29.781]  Brain eating vaccines.
[02:29:29.781 --> 02:29:30.882]  Three words.
[02:29:30.882 --> 02:29:32.563]  Brain eating vaccines.
[02:29:33.283 --> 02:29:34.483]  Vaccines.
[02:29:34.483 --> 02:29:35.784]  Brain.
[02:29:35.784 --> 02:29:36.824]  Eating.
[02:29:36.824 --> 02:29:38.105]  Vaccines.
[02:29:38.105 --> 02:29:39.125]  Brain.
[02:29:39.125 --> 02:29:39.805]  Eating.
[02:29:39.805 --> 02:29:41.065]  Vaccines.
[02:29:41.065 --> 02:29:41.986]  Brain.
[02:29:41.986 --> 02:29:42.666]  Eating.
[02:29:42.666 --> 02:29:43.866]  Vaccines.
[02:29:43.866 --> 02:29:45.887]  These criminals aren't going to be able to stop us.
[02:29:45.887 --> 02:29:52.349]  We're going to expose these control freaks, and we're going to stop their brain-eating vaccines.
[02:29:52.349 --> 02:29:53.749]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.749 --> 02:29:56.270]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.270 --> 02:29:58.951]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.727 --> 02:30:05.909]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:30:05.909 --> 02:30:12.312]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:30:12.312 --> 02:30:19.695]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:30:19.695 --> 02:30:24.578]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:30:24.578 --> 02:30:26.699]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:31.141]  It's powder and owner for over 63 years.
[02:30:31.141 --> 02:30:33.263]  People keep asking me, how's business?
[02:30:33.263 --> 02:30:35.564]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:30:35.564 --> 02:30:35.885]  Call us.
[02:30:49.014 --> 02:30:55.587]  At 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:30:55.587 --> 02:30:56.027]  Thank you!
[02:31:03.305 --> 02:31:07.266]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:07.266 --> 02:31:16.127]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:16.127 --> 02:31:20.748]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:20.748 --> 02:31:31.570]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:32.210 --> 02:31:41.713]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:41.713 --> 02:31:47.154]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:47.154 --> 02:31:54.636]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:54.636 --> 02:31:57.397]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:32:01.186 --> 02:32:05.749]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:05.749 --> 02:32:06.650]  Number 1.
[02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:10.093]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:10.093 --> 02:32:10.953]  Number 2.
[02:32:10.953 --> 02:32:15.837]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.837 --> 02:32:16.577]  It's true.
[02:32:16.577 --> 02:32:21.461]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:21.461 --> 02:32:22.282]  Number 3.
[02:32:22.282 --> 02:32:25.864]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.864 --> 02:32:29.567]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.767 --> 02:32:30.568]  Number 4.
[02:32:30.568 --> 02:32:33.330]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:33.330 --> 02:32:37.014]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:37.014 --> 02:32:37.795]  Number 5.
[02:32:37.795 --> 02:32:41.938]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.938 --> 02:32:46.703]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.983 --> 02:32:51.166]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:51.166 --> 02:32:52.947]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.947 --> 02:33:00.192]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:00.192 --> 02:33:11.440]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:15.066 --> 02:33:23.313]  Now I want to talk to the social engineers whose religion is a control freak system of dehumanization.
[02:33:23.313 --> 02:33:24.514]  You are like cancer.
[02:33:24.514 --> 02:33:26.315]  You're racing through the body politic.
[02:33:26.315 --> 02:33:28.377]  You think you're invincible.
[02:33:28.377 --> 02:33:29.718]  And you may kill the host.
[02:33:29.718 --> 02:33:31.859]  You may destroy our species.
[02:33:31.859 --> 02:33:33.541]  But not without a fight.
[02:33:33.541 --> 02:33:38.184]  You are disgusting, wicked people who love ruling over others.
[02:33:38.184 --> 02:33:40.987]  Everything you do creates death and destruction in its path.
[02:33:41.587 --> 02:33:47.134]  You sold Prozac as a way to stop depression when, in your own trials, you knew it massively increased suicide.
[02:33:47.134 --> 02:33:54.703]  Now you're telling us how great lithium, a toxic metal, an anti-psychotic is gonna be, put in the water, mandatory.
[02:33:54.703 --> 02:33:55.504]  We've got the studies.
[02:33:55.504 --> 02:33:57.086]  It's already in most of the water supplies.
[02:33:57.086 --> 02:33:58.467]  We know you're adding it.
[02:33:58.467 --> 02:34:00.930]  You are sickening, disgusting filth.
[02:34:01.991 --> 02:34:06.877]  And we're going to rally the world population against you and we're going to bring you to justice.
[02:34:06.877 --> 02:34:10.741]  And I pray God that humanity makes it through what you've attempted to do.
[02:34:10.741 --> 02:34:17.689]  How you've saddled up next to us like a spider in the dark and tried to spin your webs of control around us while we were asleep.
[02:34:18.450 --> 02:34:23.132]  But the sleeping giant that is humanity is waking up to who you are and what you are.
[02:34:23.132 --> 02:34:37.379]  And I pray to the creator of the universe and I beg for just the average person out there as well to research just who you are and how you're involved in a scorched earth takeover of society to secure your ill-gotten gains.
[02:34:37.379 --> 02:34:45.102]  And I want you to know that I'm going to do everything I can to rally free humanity against you and that we are going to defeat you.
[02:34:45.102 --> 02:34:46.763]  But whether we win or not,
[02:34:47.443 --> 02:34:51.165]  Whether you lose or fail, at least we were real humans.
[02:34:51.165 --> 02:34:55.487]  We were good, decent people that saw the truth and we stood up against you.
[02:34:55.487 --> 02:35:02.029]  And no matter what happens in this, you are still degenerate, dehumanizing filth.
[02:35:02.029 --> 02:35:05.371]  You are aberrant, malfunctioning trash.
[02:35:05.371 --> 02:35:09.333]  And you look at everything good and wholesome and tell us that we are malfunctioning.
[02:35:10.393 --> 02:35:21.607]  So I pray that you be defeated, but either way, in this time and space, on this planet, good people stood up against what you are, and did everything they could to help the innocents.
[02:35:21.607 --> 02:35:26.333]  When I look at all the children that you've brain damaged, and all the children dying of cancer,
[02:35:26.613 --> 02:35:31.337]  And I look at all the things that you've done to humanity, it makes me want to vomit.
[02:35:31.337 --> 02:35:41.344]  You are doing this because this is only the next wave to first neutralize us so we're calm and sedate and can't resist so you can roll in with the hard kill weapons.
[02:35:41.344 --> 02:35:42.345]  I know that.
[02:35:42.345 --> 02:35:43.465]  And I want to tell you something else.
[02:35:44.346 --> 02:35:51.830]  A lot of you that think that you're part of the winning team, you're going to find out that your masters hate you more than they even hate free humanity.
[02:35:51.830 --> 02:36:00.994]  Because they know that you know where the bodies are buried, and they know you're a bunch of wicked control freaks that they need to kill first once they take over, or you'll start trying to overthrow them.
[02:36:00.994 --> 02:36:02.735]  They understand your nature.
[02:36:02.735 --> 02:36:07.298]  They use their propaganda to manipulate good men throughout history to serve their evil aims.
[02:36:08.058 --> 02:36:11.560]  So understand this, you're going to fail one way or another.
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:24.927]  You've decided to put your soul on the side of darkness for all eternity for what you're doing to humanity and butchering our DNA and literally mutating the human spirit and your control freak lust for power.
[02:36:24.927 --> 02:36:28.489]  And so all of you, one way or another, will fail.
[02:36:28.489 --> 02:36:32.512]  So all that matters is, in this time and space, I stood up for what's right.
[02:36:32.512 --> 02:36:34.493]  I saw you clearly for what you are.
[02:36:35.413 --> 02:36:42.015]  And I know in my heart there's a very good chance we're gonna beat you, but that's up to all the people out there watching this.
[02:36:42.015 --> 02:36:44.036]  Do they have the courage to face the facts?
[02:36:44.036 --> 02:36:46.497]  Do they have the courage to take action?
[02:36:46.497 --> 02:36:54.140]  If you feel you are not properly sedated, call 348-844-IMMEDIATELY.
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:59.702]  Failure to do so may result in prosecution for criminal drug evasion.
[02:37:02.881 --> 02:37:13.784]  And there's the headline just went up minutes ago at PrisonPlanet.com, the search term for today, brain-eating vaccines.
[02:37:13.784 --> 02:37:15.404]  Brain-eating vaccines.
[02:37:15.404 --> 02:37:25.827]  You go to PrisonPlanet.com and you get that article and you send it out to your message boards, you send it out to your email list, your Facebook, your MySpace.
[02:37:26.787 --> 02:37:29.048]  Make your own videos about it on YouTube.
[02:37:29.048 --> 02:37:30.849]  I'd love to link to those tomorrow.
[02:37:30.849 --> 02:37:32.369]  I'd love to see our listeners.
[02:37:32.369 --> 02:37:36.451]  I'd love to see tens of thousands of our listeners that I know have YouTube accounts or other video accounts.
[02:37:36.451 --> 02:37:38.372]  Go shoot a one-minute, a 10-minute video.
[02:37:38.372 --> 02:37:40.172]  Print out your own articles.
[02:37:40.172 --> 02:37:41.213]  Type in cognitive
[02:37:43.103 --> 02:37:45.044]  Vaccines or cognitive enhancement.
[02:37:45.044 --> 02:37:54.228]  You'll get thousands of government documents and articles how they already are testing injectable vaccines that literally go in and attack.
[02:37:54.228 --> 02:37:55.209]  That's what viruses do.
[02:37:55.209 --> 02:37:59.031]  They literally go in and attack and destroy tissue.
[02:37:59.031 --> 02:38:00.411]  They absorb it.
[02:38:00.411 --> 02:38:04.713]  The RNA comes up, injects its virus package.
[02:38:04.713 --> 02:38:07.415]  It then replicates in those neuron receptors.
[02:38:08.476 --> 02:38:10.897]  Then the receptors bust open.
[02:38:10.897 --> 02:38:15.398]  You get some extra brain damage when the brain swells because of the brain infection.
[02:38:15.398 --> 02:38:21.479]  So that's a little added goody, just a good old fashioned, you know, what their mercury does to the small children.
[02:38:21.479 --> 02:38:25.440]  So they get that added goody for them, control freak enjoyment.
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:34.862]  But the main attack is it literally eating, eating your neurons and they're calmly going, we're gonna inject you and you're not gonna get angry, upset anymore.
[02:38:34.862 --> 02:38:37.143]  You're not gonna be able to resist us, oh.
[02:38:40.046 --> 02:38:42.630]  But I want to commend Rob Dew.
[02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:43.291]  He's still in there.
[02:38:43.291 --> 02:38:45.834]  He's uploading it to YouTube right now, finishing the compression.
[02:38:45.834 --> 02:38:46.796]  It'll be up in the next hour.
[02:38:46.796 --> 02:38:53.886]  We will then post in this article that Watson has written, and then he's going to be beefing and adding to it, because I just called Watson an hour ago.
[02:38:54.821 --> 02:39:06.047]  Because I'd have the oversight of if I'm going to sit here and the video's not ready and an article's not ready promoting the search term brain-eating vaccines, we've got to have something for the media to link to when it's the number one search term.
[02:39:06.047 --> 02:39:07.708]  So we've got the article now.
[02:39:07.708 --> 02:39:13.831]  If you missed any of the video or want to see it in its entirety without us stopping for breaks, it'll be up in the next hour.
[02:39:15.404 --> 02:39:22.931]  The next hour at the Alex Jones YouTube channel and archived up at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:39:22.931 --> 02:39:27.576]  PrisonPlanet.TV as we're streaming live with the radio show, the video, right now.
[02:39:27.576 --> 02:39:36.645]  Now, I've got all this other news, and it's all important, but at the end of the day, the scientific dictatorship ruling and controlling our society
[02:39:38.951 --> 02:39:46.861]  With their diabolical full-spectrum dominance dehumanization mass extermination program now admitted.
[02:39:46.861 --> 02:39:51.607]  They're now coming out to the servile already drugged with fluoride and other chemicals.
[02:39:51.607 --> 02:39:55.131]  The public is all going, well, you're gonna drug me?
[02:39:55.131 --> 02:39:56.213]  Okay, thank you government.
[02:39:56.903 --> 02:39:59.344]  They're like, that's right, you're not a conspiracy theorist.
[02:39:59.344 --> 02:40:01.825]  First, conspiracy theorists said we were drugging the water.
[02:40:01.825 --> 02:40:02.965]  They were crazy.
[02:40:02.965 --> 02:40:14.649]  Now we admit we are and are going to forcibly inject you as well with viruses that attack your brain made out of cancer viruses and also herpes virus.
[02:40:14.649 --> 02:40:16.390]  That's mainstream news.
[02:40:16.390 --> 02:40:19.571]  And you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:40:19.571 --> 02:40:24.693]  If you don't want the injection that changes your attitude, you're going to feel a lot better.
[02:40:25.632 --> 02:40:29.176]  And imagine, they already forcibly inoculate people when they get arrested.
[02:40:29.176 --> 02:40:34.281]  They'll check your shot records and say, oh you haven't had these shots, here's a TB shot, here's a hepatitis shot.
[02:40:34.281 --> 02:40:41.068]  Now as you get arrested, you know, for not having the proper driver's license, or not having insurance, or whatever the case is, or not wearing a seatbelt, and now arrest you.
[02:40:41.869 --> 02:40:46.911]  Look, it's a simple injection, and now they have police taking blood under federal grants for a DNA database.
[02:40:46.911 --> 02:40:52.054]  They claim it's drunk driver checkpoints, but it's actually admitted that it's really for Pentagon DNA databases.
[02:40:52.054 --> 02:41:02.799]  So, they're medicalizing the police now, where they're like, look, Mr. Jones, we've arrested you at this protest, and this injection's gonna calm you down.
[02:41:02.799 --> 02:41:06.661]  All that anger, all that strength, all that Americana's gone, pal.
[02:41:06.661 --> 02:41:09.782]  You're now gonna submit to us.
[02:41:09.782 --> 02:41:10.783]  It's freedom!
[02:41:11.587 --> 02:41:14.429]  Don't be a conspiracy theorist!
[02:41:14.429 --> 02:41:16.770]  Then I'll be on the air the next week.
[02:41:16.770 --> 02:41:24.075]  Well, the New World Order is wrong and what's happening is wrong, but I won't be able to make the emotional decision and the emotional high ground.
[02:41:24.075 --> 02:41:27.017]  Moral high ground.
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:40.485]  To even be able to... I mean, can you imagine the body snatchers, soul-stealing level?
[02:41:40.485 --> 02:41:46.790]  And these little bastards just sit there calmly going, we're gonna inject you, we're gonna put more chemicals in the water to make you happy.
[02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:50.753]  And like the wonderful world we're building, it's normal.
[02:41:50.753 --> 02:41:52.074]  Why do you have a problem?
[02:41:52.734 --> 02:41:55.955]  They come out, we're going to put implantable microchips in you to track you.
[02:41:55.955 --> 02:41:57.396]  Yeah, we're listening to all your phones.
[02:41:57.396 --> 02:41:59.137]  Yeah, we're tracking everything you do.
[02:41:59.137 --> 02:42:01.518]  Yeah, we're going to secretly arrest you and torture you.
[02:42:01.518 --> 02:42:06.640]  Yeah, we're going to inject all the troops with all this new nanotech and change their brains.
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:11.262]  But we're going to make them less fearful and more aggressive.
[02:42:11.262 --> 02:42:16.024]  See, it's like a hive mind, like we're specialized ants or bees.
[02:42:16.024 --> 02:42:18.005]  That's what these social engineer collectivist.
[02:42:19.366 --> 02:42:27.351]  And then they'll get all the life extension technologies and all the real advancing systems that are tested on us, and then we'll get poisoned and killed!
[02:42:27.351 --> 02:42:37.497]  But we'll be neutralized where we can't even get angry to say no to it!
[02:42:37.497 --> 02:42:39.798]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[02:42:39.798 --> 02:42:41.679]  I'm just completely blown away.
[02:42:41.679 --> 02:42:47.683]  I just know we've got to stand up and fight against these people, and I know this article at PrisonPlanet.com is so key.
[02:42:49.150 --> 02:43:02.178]  And it's a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 paragraph article with a bunch of hyperlinks, because we did this very quickly, just linking to all the mainstream government documents and news, but we're going to add the video there for everybody, and we can do it.
[02:43:02.178 --> 02:43:06.901]  Now, the last, every video I've been launching, it's about 200,000 views in a day and a half.
[02:43:06.901 --> 02:43:17.628]  It goes to the front page of YouTube, to be the head of the News and Politics section, and then they remove it and put videos with 5,000, 10,000 views on top of it, and remove it off the front page so you can't watch it.
[02:43:18.228 --> 02:43:21.751]  But still, then it gets another 100, 200,000 views, then peters out.
[02:43:21.751 --> 02:43:25.214]  I want tens of millions of views.
[02:43:25.214 --> 02:43:28.877]  And even though they'll censor it off the front page, because once it pops up, they'll remove it.
[02:43:28.877 --> 02:43:29.717]  It's all automated.
[02:43:29.717 --> 02:43:31.719]  They have to see it and go remove it.
[02:43:31.719 --> 02:43:36.443]  If they don't totally remove the video, they remove it off the front page where everybody can see it.
[02:43:36.443 --> 02:43:41.367]  Though it deserves that spot, it's supposedly whatever's most popular goes there, but it's like the elections.
[02:43:41.367 --> 02:43:42.868]  It's rigged.
[02:43:42.868 --> 02:43:44.109]  It's controlling society.
[02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:56.814]  So you just keep sending it out, keep getting it out to everyone, keep educating people, never stop while we've still got the web.
[02:43:56.814 --> 02:44:00.495]  Karachi riots leave 45 dead after MP assassinated.
[02:44:00.495 --> 02:44:12.899]  This is the London Guardian gunman swarmed Pakistan's city streets seeking revenge after political radical, I mean political Raza Haider killed
[02:44:14.132 --> 02:44:17.124]  Gangland style hit.
[02:44:17.124 --> 02:44:19.113]  I'm so wound up I can't even news read right now.
[02:44:26.542 --> 02:44:30.423]  It is a normal response to get upset and angry.
[02:44:30.423 --> 02:44:32.764]  That's your motivation system.
[02:44:32.764 --> 02:44:34.525]  It's a normal survival instinct.
[02:44:34.525 --> 02:44:39.686]  You corner a coyote, it's gonna start growling and lashing out and attacking.
[02:44:39.686 --> 02:44:53.290]  You know, 5,000 years ago, you're some Central Asian tribe, another tribe comes over the hill to kill the men and take the women and children, you're gonna get fired up, you're gonna be strong, you're gonna have strength like you never had, and you're gonna fight for your life.
[02:44:53.290 --> 02:44:54.731]  They wanna remove that.
[02:44:55.987 --> 02:45:02.910]  Why do you gotta ask yourselves, drinking Aspartame, eating MSG, drinking fluoridated water, taking Prozac, why you can't get angry?
[02:45:02.910 --> 02:45:04.751]  Why you can't recognize danger?
[02:45:04.751 --> 02:45:07.792]  Why you can't stand up against it?
[02:45:07.792 --> 02:45:14.935]  Well, I happen to have a stack of news here on that subject.
[02:45:14.935 --> 02:45:18.117]  Shrimp becoming hooked on Prozac that is flushed into the sea.
[02:45:19.113 --> 02:45:27.455]  And it says they now swim right up to fish and birds and turtles and are being eaten and killed, whereas before they would hide and were more intelligent.
[02:45:27.455 --> 02:45:27.615]  See?
[02:45:28.717 --> 02:45:39.640]  They don't recognize the threat of bankers robbing them, or insurance companies stealing dead troops' money when it's mainstream news, or government-run healthcare, or all the government tyranny.
[02:45:39.640 --> 02:45:44.201]  You can't recognize it because sodium fluoride has the same effect as Prozac.
[02:45:44.201 --> 02:45:46.221]  Shrimp becoming hooked on Prozac.
[02:45:46.221 --> 02:45:47.001]  That's the mail.
[02:45:47.001 --> 02:45:48.022]  Here's Salon.
[02:45:48.022 --> 02:45:49.922]  Shrimp on Prozac are killing themselves.
[02:45:49.922 --> 02:45:53.363]  A study shows that drug traces in our wastewater can affect marine behavior.
[02:45:55.350 --> 02:45:56.491]  There's another one for shrimp.
[02:45:56.491 --> 02:45:59.893]  Prozac is an invitation to danger.
[02:45:59.893 --> 02:46:04.496]  And that's what these vaccines they're announcing for the troops are and for the citizens.
[02:46:04.496 --> 02:46:05.797]  You won't be upset.
[02:46:05.797 --> 02:46:07.578]  You won't be nervous anymore.
[02:46:07.578 --> 02:46:16.203]  You won't be able to feel passion.
[02:46:16.203 --> 02:46:20.026]  And we've also sent it out on the Twitter account using the CIA Twitter system.
[02:46:20.026 --> 02:46:22.367]  Twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones.
[02:46:23.602 --> 02:46:37.093]  And the number one Twitter up there is Google search term brain-eating vaccines.
[02:46:37.093 --> 02:46:40.896]  Okay, I promised to get into other news and we're going to do that now.
[02:46:42.465 --> 02:46:45.566]  Uh, things are really heating up in Pakistan with the tribal warfare.
[02:46:45.566 --> 02:46:49.167]  Uh, 45 dead after a member of parliament assassinated.
[02:46:49.167 --> 02:46:51.268]  Uh, incredible news from Fox News.
[02:46:51.268 --> 02:46:54.569]  We first reported this about two weeks ago, but now it's in the mainstream news.
[02:46:54.569 --> 02:47:03.412]  NASA talked about how the upper atmosphere collapsed to the greatest level ever recorded in the last hundred years because the sun had really cooled off and had become partially dormant.
[02:47:03.412 --> 02:47:05.273]  Now it's supercharged, racing back.
[02:47:06.073 --> 02:47:11.821]  And the Sun's surface erupted early Sunday morning, blasting tons of plasma into interplanetary space directly towards Earth.
[02:47:11.821 --> 02:47:16.287]  Earth is bracing for a cosmic tsunami Tuesday night.
[02:47:16.287 --> 02:47:19.291]  There may even be Van Allen radiation belt-type...
[02:47:22.025 --> 02:47:28.509]  Disruptions as it supercharges it and it may blow out satellites you name it, but we'll see what happens here.
[02:47:28.509 --> 02:47:44.337]  They had this stuff in the mid 1900s and 1800s where it would blow out all the telegraph machines and things you can and the telegraph wires would start glowing and then the telegraph boxes would just explode so much radiation was blasting through that atmosphere from the Sun.
[02:47:44.337 --> 02:47:50.541]  Your SUV has nothing to do with that.
[02:47:50.541 --> 02:47:50.641]  And
[02:47:51.906 --> 02:47:57.570]  They're reporting that we may even have a Bora... Borealis.
[02:47:57.570 --> 02:48:08.279]  We might even, in some areas of the world, not in the north or the south poles, where the electromagnetic fields come into the poles, you may actually see those in other areas geographically around the world tonight.
[02:48:08.279 --> 02:48:17.066]  You got clear skies this evening, you might want to be outside to watch that atmosphere heat up as that sun shoots right across the top of it.
[02:48:18.063 --> 02:48:18.844]  It's hardcore.
[02:48:18.844 --> 02:48:20.085]  It continues.
[02:48:20.085 --> 02:48:26.430]  The eruption is directed right at us and is expected to get here early in the day of August 4th.
[02:48:26.430 --> 02:48:34.276]  It's August 3rd today, so after midnight, said Leon Bulb of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
[02:48:34.276 --> 02:48:37.900]  It's the first major Earth-directed eruption in quite some time.
[02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:39.181]  Look for satellites to get blown.
[02:48:39.841 --> 02:48:51.530]  The solar eruption called Coronal Mass Ejection, Coriolis, was spotted by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which captures high-definition views of the Sun at a variety of wavelengths.
[02:48:51.530 --> 02:48:58.016]  The SDO was launched in February and peers deep into the layers of the Sun, investigating the mysteries of its inner workings.
[02:48:58.016 --> 02:49:00.057]  Boy, this is gonna heat the Earth up.
[02:49:00.057 --> 02:49:01.238]  All the science I've seen.
[02:49:01.238 --> 02:49:02.859]  And the global warming people will hop up and down.
[02:49:02.859 --> 02:49:04.401]  It's the SUVs!
[02:49:04.401 --> 02:49:06.022]  It's the SUVs!
[02:49:06.022 --> 02:49:07.043]  No, it's the Sun.
[02:49:08.626 --> 02:49:09.407]  You better be glad.
[02:49:09.407 --> 02:49:13.369]  It energizes our atmosphere.
[02:49:13.369 --> 02:49:15.451]  Continuing with news here.
[02:49:15.451 --> 02:49:17.932]  Poll.
[02:49:17.932 --> 02:49:20.234]  Waning support for Obama on wars.
[02:49:20.234 --> 02:49:20.834]  So what's he do?
[02:49:20.834 --> 02:49:22.835]  He comes out and says the wars are over.
[02:49:22.835 --> 02:49:23.636]  The troops will stay.
[02:49:23.636 --> 02:49:24.917]  The war will continue.
[02:49:24.917 --> 02:49:28.039]  But mission accomplished, like Bush said on the aircraft carrier seven years ago.
[02:49:31.018 --> 02:49:35.360]  He'll just tell you it's mission accomplished, and for a while the sheep will go, okay.
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:36.881]  Oh, they said they're drugging my water supply.
[02:49:36.881 --> 02:49:37.721]  It's good.
[02:49:37.721 --> 02:49:41.163]  Oh, they said if you criticize the federal takeover, you're a racist.
[02:49:41.163 --> 02:49:43.184]  Oh, well, our troops are still there.
[02:49:43.184 --> 02:49:46.466]  The record numbers are dying, but the war is over.
[02:49:46.466 --> 02:49:47.026]  Yeah, here it is.
[02:49:49.713 --> 02:49:55.396]  Obama boasts end of Iraq war by the end of this year as Iran war kicks into high gear.
[02:49:55.396 --> 02:49:56.877]  Key article by Aaron Dykes.
[02:49:56.877 --> 02:49:57.497]  Here's another one.
[02:49:57.497 --> 02:50:00.459]  China to hold large-scale Air Force drill.
[02:50:00.459 --> 02:50:04.942]  Bombers' missiles could end Iran nukes, Washington Times reports.
[02:50:04.942 --> 02:50:11.585]  And the Pentagon is now admitting, Admiral Mullen, that they've got a battle plan to bomb hundreds of sites inside Iran.
[02:50:11.585 --> 02:50:16.408]  So all of that is going into high gear.
[02:50:16.408 --> 02:50:17.509]  And meanwhile, the Pakistani
[02:50:19.321 --> 02:50:23.035]  Leader, the president is saying the war is lost against the Taliban.
[02:50:24.764 --> 02:50:30.269]  As our government says the Taliban is run by them when it's actually run by British and Israeli and U.S.
[02:50:30.269 --> 02:50:32.290]  intel on record.
[02:50:32.290 --> 02:50:35.513]  So it's just getting more insane by the minute.
[02:50:35.513 --> 02:50:37.615]  We're going to hit on some other key news.
[02:50:37.615 --> 02:50:41.498]  Minority report billboards to address consumers by name.
[02:50:41.498 --> 02:50:48.704]  You don't think when Steven Spielberg six years ago, seven years ago made that movie where face scanners tailor ads to you that he made that up.
[02:50:48.704 --> 02:50:51.446]  They already invented that 20 years ago and now it's rolling out.
[02:50:51.886 --> 02:50:59.059]  Thanks to the airports where they get your face scan or off your driver's license and they're also going to double as federal snooping centers.
[02:50:59.059 --> 02:51:01.063]  They're not really there just to show you a billboard ad.
[02:51:02.850 --> 02:51:13.234]  Protect your freedoms and be independent by learning how to maintain, repair, and customize your own firearms through these exclusive video training courses on DVD from the American Gunsmithing Institute.

[02:52:02.455 --> 02:52:04.838]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:04.838 --> 02:52:07.161]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:07.161 --> 02:52:10.386]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:10.386 --> 02:52:15.492]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:15.492 --> 02:52:19.678]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:19.978 --> 02:52:22.342]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:22.342 --> 02:52:25.226]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:25.226 --> 02:52:28.130]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:28.130 --> 02:52:35.742]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:36.062 --> 02:52:41.443]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:41.443 --> 02:52:44.304]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:44.304 --> 02:52:47.985]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:47.985 --> 02:52:49.065]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:49.065 --> 02:52:50.406]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:50.406 --> 02:52:51.906]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:01.687 --> 02:53:04.208]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[02:53:04.208 --> 02:53:07.770]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[02:53:07.770 --> 02:53:16.275]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[02:53:16.275 --> 02:53:21.078]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food.
[02:53:21.738 --> 02:53:27.363]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[02:53:27.363 --> 02:53:35.410]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food, too.
[02:53:35.410 --> 02:53:40.394]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[02:53:40.854 --> 02:53:42.675]  Our foods are their enemy.
[02:53:42.675 --> 02:53:48.537]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[02:53:48.537 --> 02:53:51.518]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.

[02:54:07.739 --> 02:54:17.166]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side
[02:54:22.812 --> 02:54:26.452]  Okay, we're going to hit some key final news here at the end of this hour.
[02:54:26.452 --> 02:54:37.354]  I know I've spent a lot of time on adulterated food, water, how it's a public plan to dumb you down and now they want to go right to vaccines that brain damage you and make you servile.
[02:54:37.354 --> 02:54:38.954]  There's no bigger issue.
[02:54:38.954 --> 02:54:41.135]  And this is now being launched publicly against you.
[02:54:41.135 --> 02:54:43.315]  It's been going on in the shadows for a long time.
[02:54:43.315 --> 02:54:45.676]  That's why people are so dumbed down.
[02:54:45.676 --> 02:54:47.676]  That's why they can't get serious about threats.
[02:54:48.436 --> 02:54:56.338]  Because they've been brain damaged, and they now intend to just... and the US IQs dropped massively, European IQs have dropped.
[02:54:56.338 --> 02:55:02.879]  It's not just education, it's IQ, the cognitive intelligence, and our DNA is becoming mutated.
[02:55:02.879 --> 02:55:04.119]  That's admitted.
[02:55:04.119 --> 02:55:14.021]  But before I get into some more news, I just want to point out that we have great sponsors like eFoodsDirect.com with the depression, the looming wars, all the craziness.
[02:55:14.021 --> 02:55:16.322]  You need to be self-sufficient, and it starts with food.
[02:55:17.185 --> 02:55:30.454]  And eFoodsDirect has non-GMO, non-hybrid, all made in America, fresh, they're making it new every day, every week, lasts more than 10 years, you'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread, eFoodsDirect.com, the letter E, foodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[02:55:30.454 --> 02:55:34.537]  Don't screw around, don't wait, protect your family, have an emergency backup of food, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:34.537 --> 02:55:34.617]  Okay.
[02:55:46.257 --> 02:55:47.498]  Getting into some other news.
[02:55:47.498 --> 02:55:49.319]  Look at this financial info.
[02:55:49.319 --> 02:55:54.822]  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says unemployment could go up before it comes down.
[02:55:54.822 --> 02:55:56.263]  ABC News.
[02:55:56.263 --> 02:56:00.166]  And now there's all these other mainstream publications going, oh, we never ended the recession.
[02:56:00.166 --> 02:56:02.107]  Oh, it might be a depression.
[02:56:02.107 --> 02:56:03.208]  But don't worry.
[02:56:03.208 --> 02:56:05.049]  The bankers have got a solution.
[02:56:05.049 --> 02:56:06.530]  More taxes.
[02:56:06.530 --> 02:56:10.492]  And carbon taxes to move all your jobs overseas where they don't have carbon taxes.
[02:56:10.492 --> 02:56:11.673]  That'll fix it for you.
[02:56:14.055 --> 02:56:16.462]  AT&T and Verizon want to replace your credit cards.
[02:56:16.462 --> 02:56:19.611]  They want your phone to now be your cashless credit card that also tracks you.
[02:56:21.464 --> 02:56:29.608]  And they've got a bunch of other news reports just how consumer confidence, industry, purchases, everything's going into freefall.
[02:56:29.608 --> 02:56:31.169]  It's all been designed that way.
[02:56:31.169 --> 02:56:37.212]  Full spectrum dominance by these globalists as they take over every facet of society.
[02:56:37.212 --> 02:56:48.278]  Unemployment's massively spiking now because the millions of people they hired for the census, they would do a trick where every month they'd hire them and then let them go and then hire them again to create the illusion of new jobs.
[02:56:48.278 --> 02:56:49.539]  Well, that illusion's now leaving.
[02:56:50.799 --> 02:56:54.541]  Uh, people are striking and protesting in Greece as they're being raped over there.
[02:56:54.541 --> 02:56:58.022]  They're talking about defaulting on their debt.
[02:56:58.022 --> 02:57:01.563]  The Financial Times of London, Aaron Dykes wrote a story about this.
[02:57:01.563 --> 02:57:04.044]  Financial Times demands Obama break his tax promise.
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:07.482]  Well, he already has raised taxes, basically, on everybody.
[02:57:07.482 --> 02:57:08.503]  But they say more.
[02:57:08.503 --> 02:57:10.465]  Raise taxes on the poorest people.
[02:57:10.465 --> 02:57:13.627]  Raise them, raise them, raise them, raise them, raise them!
[02:57:13.627 --> 02:57:15.308]  Everything's got to go to the bankers.
[02:57:15.308 --> 02:57:29.339]  And as they raise the taxes, all over the country, from Philadelphia to Illinois to California, they're announcing in cities and towns and states, one-third of firefighters laid off, one-half of police laid off.
[02:57:29.339 --> 02:57:30.479]  That was in the news today.
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:37.165]  As the taxes go up, no police, no firefighters, everything goes to the bankers.
[02:57:37.165 --> 02:57:42.570]  And then the cities go bankrupt and say, okay, take our roads, take our water, double, triple the prices.
[02:57:42.570 --> 02:57:44.531]  You know, bankers, you get it all.
[02:57:44.531 --> 02:57:48.835]  This is Bernie Madoff, Ken Lay becoming kings of the universe.
[02:57:48.835 --> 02:57:51.817]  Unlimited fraud, unlimited corruption.
[02:57:51.817 --> 02:57:54.299]  And the system's saying, oh, they're getting uppity.
[02:57:54.299 --> 02:57:55.340]  They're waking up to us.
[02:57:56.201 --> 02:57:57.322]  They're getting involved.
[02:57:57.322 --> 02:57:58.382]  They know what we're doing.
[02:57:58.382 --> 02:58:01.264]  How do we put face scanning cameras everywhere, even in the malls?
[02:58:01.264 --> 02:58:05.566]  We tell them that it runs through a database and is an ad just for them.
[02:58:05.566 --> 02:58:08.987]  These arrogant schmucks out there will love it.
[02:58:08.987 --> 02:58:09.548]  That's it!
[02:58:10.453 --> 02:58:18.841]  And they admit it's a government-funded face scanning cameras going up everywhere, not just on the highways, that then throw ads at you, verbal ads.
[02:58:18.841 --> 02:58:27.369]  It face scans, it knows your photo from the DMV database, it throws ads at you, but it's also marking and selling the data to the government where you're at.
[02:58:27.369 --> 02:58:33.975]  Just like Facebook and Google now admit that they are the government, everything goes right to the government, and then they're paid for their treason.
[02:58:34.997 --> 02:58:37.178]  The search term is brain-eating vaccines.
[02:58:37.178 --> 02:58:40.160]  The article and video are up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:40.160 --> 02:58:43.682]  Great job, crew.
