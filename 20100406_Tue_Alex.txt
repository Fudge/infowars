[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:30.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:37.000]  it is Tuesday the 6th day of April 2010 we're gonna be live here for the next four hours
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura will be joining us live in the last hour of the broadcast
[00:43.000 --> 00:50.000]  we have our once a month visit with Mike Rivera fellow GCN host and he heads up whatreallyhappened.com
[00:50.000 --> 00:59.000]  he will be joining us coming up in the second hour today now obviously everyone is talking about
[00:59.000 --> 01:08.000]  WikiLeaks and the video released that was shot live from an Apache gunship in 2007 in Iraq
[01:08.000 --> 01:18.000]  and it shows several Reuters reporters with video cameras walking around in a street and the gunship
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.000]  opens up on them and kills them one of them's crawling wounded they make jokes about it and then
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.000]  fire into his body killing him then a minivan pulls up they clearly get out of the car there's
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000]  children in the car leaning out watching they're getting one of the wounded people to put him into
[01:36.000 --> 01:44.000]  the vehicle and they fire into the vehicle then about 10 minutes later US forces ground forces
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.000]  and Bradley show up and go over and get the wounded children and report back that they shot
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.000]  children and you hear the Apache helicopter pilots say well they shouldn't have kids in a battle zone
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  you mean in the middle of a built-up city area shouldn't have them in a battle zone pulling up
[02:03.000 --> 02:11.000]  in a minivan to pick up dead and wounded reporters and put them in a car and this speaks to the
[02:11.000 --> 02:18.000]  dehumanization of the military how it's all just a big video game now you notice the ground forces
[02:18.000 --> 02:23.000]  show up and actually have to look at the dead and dying people and the wounded children and so
[02:23.000 --> 02:29.000]  they have empathy and began grabbing the children and trying to take them to get medical aid the
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  US military then refused to give them medical aid told the ground soldiers to basically just go dump
[02:35.000 --> 02:43.000]  them off at an Iraqi police barracks with the substandard care but this is just par for the
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  course and of course in the New York Times today the Pentagon is now admitting they lied about
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  massacres in Afghanistan well they lied about killing Pat Tillman that was a hit he was writing
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  letters back to his father his mother his brother his family saying when I come home I'm going to
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  expose this war as a fraud so they said we got to kill this boy he's been our poster child but now
[03:05.000 --> 03:13.000]  he's not we've got to get rid of him also Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaefer is on record on
[03:13.000 --> 03:23.000]  MSNBC stating that this violated rules of engagement on multiple fronts but especially once
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  you had wounded on the ground and you hear the military lying saying oh look they've got guns
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  they're picking up weapons as they pick up a person who's wounded clearly and so there they are
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  framing them on the video on the gun camera this is reminiscent of cops caught on their own
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  squad car video going I'm gonna frame this guy okay I'm gonna give the signal they walk over
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  and reach in their pocket and go here are the drugs and you see the whole thing on tape but
[03:50.000 --> 03:56.000]  it's a video game these guys are trying to show off and get the high score like they're playing
[03:56.000 --> 04:06.000]  Gallagher or something in 1986 at a pizza shop this is not Gallagher this is not space
[04:06.000 --> 04:16.000]  invaders this is not Zaxxon this is not doom these are real people and remember most of
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  these guys are going to be coming back here to the United States they're going to be returning
[04:22.000 --> 04:30.000]  to the United States and becoming police officers and I said that in a video that I shot last
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  night when I first saw this footage I got very very angry about it I make that point it's
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  posted up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com the video the Pentagon never wanted
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000]  the public to see that these guys are going to be cops coming back to the US and lo and
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  behold there are cops in the comments posting hey what's the big deal you're a traitor Alex this

[08:21.000 --> 08:27.000]  if you go to info wars dot com and prison planet dot com we have multiple
[08:27.000 --> 08:35.000]  versions of the unedited eighteen minute gun camera footage from iraq
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  now youtube has been flagging and pulling the videos they have a little
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  tattletail system where if someone says something is dangerous to the
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  community or disturbing it's erased they always leave the videos of people
[08:49.000 --> 08:56.000]  sawing heads off up there but the footage of them throwing puppies off cliffs
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  throwing hand grenades at dogs shooting old dogs and laughing about it
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  killing children and laughing about it sitting off the highways randomly
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  shooting up vehicles full of families and laughing as they fall out of the
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.000]  cars wounded dead and dying youtube and other major video sites just keep
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  snatching them down pulling them down blocking them from public view
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  we're trying to edit out all the cuss words and the gds out of it because
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  it's got the mission controllers that are watching the gun footage back at
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  the base along with the pilots just with a solid stream of cussing and
[09:39.000 --> 09:45.000]  laughing and enjoyment people dead and dying crawling around the ground
[09:45.000 --> 09:51.000]  vehicles running over their bodies children being machine gunned with the
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  troops laughing then ground troops show up and see the splattered children and
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  they report we've got children that you've shot here to which the pilot says
[10:01.000 --> 10:07.000]  they shouldn't be in a battle then and that's I've seen footage of police in
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  Oregon and other states where you'll have a few thousand peaceful anti-war
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  demonstrators at a permanent rally and the cops will show up run over and
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.000]  pepper spray into the baby carriage into the stroller and the parents say
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  why are you attacking the baby and they say listen bleeper you shouldn't bring
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  a baby to a protest see it's always how it's your fault and so a many van pulls
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  up minutes later trying to pick up wounded people to put it in take them to
[10:36.000 --> 10:44.000]  the hospital Reuters reporters and they open fire on the van and then they say
[10:44.000 --> 10:50.000]  well it looks like there's a little bit of movement inside the van they pound
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.000]  it full of high caliber rounds to where the van starts spinning and slams
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  through a brick wall but the children are still moving so they open up on them
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  again and are just giggling and laughing and enjoying it it shows the blood
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  thirsty bloodlust and it's one thing if you've got to kill people but it's the
[11:10.000 --> 11:18.000]  the giggling the demonic snickering the incredibly unprofessional and of
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  course under the Geneva Convention under the rules of war as Tony Schaefer
[11:22.000 --> 11:28.000]  Colonel has already pointed out who's been in combat in both these countries
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  that that is a clear violation of the rules of engagement and their orders
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  that once people don't have weapons in their hands which they never did and
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  once they're on the ground and wounded or once an ambulance is there you don't
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.000]  open fire on anyone trying to retrieve wounded but they don't care you have
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  little kids looking out the window when their dad pulls up and gets out to put
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  the Reuters reporter in the car and you can just see little kids faces and I
[11:59.000 --> 12:07.000]  don't normally get so mad that I can't control myself but last night I'm up
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  here working at about 6 30 and Jason Burmese comes in and says they've
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  released the WikiLeaks video that WikiLeaks said the last two weeks they
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  were going to start releasing gun camera footage from drones in Afghanistan and
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  drones in Iraq and helicopters in both countries and I went and I watched it
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  and when I saw little kids looking out the window and I heard the helicopter
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  pilot breathing heavy and smacking his lips and giggling psychopathically as
[12:36.000 --> 12:44.000]  he opens fire with the crosshairs right on the little children I went ahead
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  and started punching on these heavy lockers we've gotten bashed the whole door
[12:48.000 --> 12:56.000]  in I was able to later fix part of it just because just because I had to let
[12:56.000 --> 13:03.000]  off some type of primitive steam at watching men two miles away in safety
[13:03.000 --> 13:10.000]  just laughing and giggling and snickering and this is the Iraqis country even
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.000]  of these were quote insurgents well I mean what do you think our founding
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  fathers were we've gone there we lied about WMD's we've killed over a million
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.000]  of these people we're in their nation and you've got some reporters walking
[13:26.000 --> 13:34.000]  around with their Reuters video cameras and you've got the military framing
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  them saying oh yeah that's clearly a gun and then after they've shot them after
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  they've strafed them they're clearly crawling around on the ground and they
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.000]  say oh look he's got a gun he's firing at me and you see in clear black and
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.000]  white that the guy is barely moving dragging himself on the ground and so
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  they open fire on him again which according to the rules of war once
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  somebody's down you don't continue to shoot them mainly because they want to
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.000]  be able to extract them and get intel from them but it's like a video game to
[14:09.000 --> 14:17.000]  these people and so there they are saying that they deserve what's happening to
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.000]  them and then there's the aftermath Michelle Malkin and others coming out
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  defending all of this and in the comments on info wars dot com and
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  present planet dot com and on the YouTube videos I've seen I hear people
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  attacking the video that Aaron Dykes and I put together last night where I
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.000]  intro it and we show tank drivers finding somebody getting wood out of a field
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.000]  for their fireplace to cook food they say that's looting so they shoot their car
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  and laugh and then run over it with a tank like it's a monster truck rally and
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.000]  they're all laughing and they say that's what you get when you loot we show
[14:55.000 --> 15:00.000]  footage of them showing throwing the puppy over the cliff we show footage of
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  contractors and troops where sitting off the side of a major highway they're just
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.000]  randomly shooting up many vans and Mercedes just just just randomly playing
[15:10.000 --> 15:23.000]  Elvis music laughing and killing people like its target practice and in came the
[15:23.000 --> 15:29.000]  comments you're a liar it's been proven that's a fake puppy or how dare you say
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  that these troops are coming home to be cops I'm going in next month to be an
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  MP so I can then be a police officer what we're doing over there is good
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  you know comments like this and they do they come back and there are rulers they
[15:46.000 --> 15:53.000]  run our lives within two days of that puppy video coming out now two years
[15:53.000 --> 16:01.000]  ago the Pentagon confirmed that was their Marines and that disciplinary action was
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  being taken because see it's easy to dehumanize the Haji's as they're called
[16:05.000 --> 16:12.000]  the brown people the Arabs the Muslims they're all bad they deserve to die
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  new come turn them into a glass parking lot but everybody knows that little
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  black and white puppy that the Marines psychopathically joke about killing
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.000]  and they throw it off a 200 foot cliff and it dies I mean there's literally
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  hundreds of these videos and YouTube tries to slap them all down but it's all
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.000]  over far and television the whole world is seeing this while we're in our little
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  bubble over here I mean so many videos if you just type into a search engine
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  US troops killing animals they're killing horses they're killing dogs they're
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  killing sheep they drive by and throw hand grenades at shepherds and I mean
[16:46.000 --> 16:51.000]  it's all funny got an old shepherd with sheep you just drive by and throw a
[16:51.000 --> 16:56.000]  hand grenade out it blows up and kills everybody and it's funny and then
[16:56.000 --> 17:01.000]  under the comment section on any of these videos you got troops going I love
[17:01.000 --> 17:06.000]  it this is absolutely wonderful kill every one of those stinking people but
[17:06.000 --> 17:14.000]  the dog video got people upset the dog people was the dog footage was upsetting
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  to people because humans have been dehumanized we've seen millions of
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  simulated murders in TV shows and dramas and movies we've seen hundreds of
[17:23.000 --> 17:28.000]  thousands of tapes over the years of real people dying in car wrecks or being
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.000]  eaten by alligators or getting their head chopped off or being shot and so we
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.000]  have no empathy for our own species but we haven't seen a lot of animals being
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  killed so we humanize the animal and so there was this all this big freak out
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  over the puppy so Paul Watson and I put together articles with dozens and
[17:48.000 --> 17:55.000]  videos of troops killing animals and laughing about it an old dog with
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  mains walks up begging for food to the troops and they just sit there with a
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  shotgun and blow its back legs off and it's sitting there wallowing in pain
[18:03.000 --> 18:08.000]  and they go look at you you pathetic ugly dog now you're gonna die they just walk
[18:08.000 --> 18:15.000]  up and shotgun in the head and you hear him going in fact call Paul Watson I
[18:15.000 --> 18:21.000]  want him to find the videos I'm sure whatever stories we've written they've
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.000]  taken the videos down so I have to find them but over and over again when
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  they're just sitting on top of roof and cars are driving by and they're shooting
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  them and they'll blow somebody's head off and then you'll hear them actually
[18:30.000 --> 18:37.000]  with demons entering their body and taking full control you'll hear oh that's
[18:37.000 --> 18:48.000]  the good guys with the heavy metal music playing and see though that's the sound
[18:48.000 --> 18:54.000]  of a good guys that's the sound of the good guys all this video of of US troops
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.000]  grab these Iraqi kids and they're beating them and they're beating them
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  and they're beating them and they're beating them and beating them and beating
[18:59.000 --> 19:02.000]  them and beating them and these troops are on top of this roof going getting
[19:02.000 --> 19:07.720]  get him, and then all of a sudden they go, I mean, I can't even make the sound.
[19:07.720 --> 19:10.400]  I'm trying to imitate it, but there's nothing like the real thing.
[19:10.400 --> 19:16.480]  And then this old dog walks up, and they just, I mean, that's who we are.
[19:16.480 --> 19:20.280]  They're all going to be cops running the FEMA camps, controlling, taking the property,
[19:20.280 --> 19:25.720]  high-flying, just running everything, drones attacking the American people, checkpoints,
[19:25.720 --> 19:31.320]  GPSing your door, just taking your daughters, whatever they want, it's their time now.
[19:31.320 --> 19:36.000]  Huge armies of darkness trained for pure evil, marching back into the United States,
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.680]  rotating new cadres of gang members and people into the Middle East, and then bringing them
[19:40.680 --> 19:43.200]  back here to rule over the American people.
[19:43.200 --> 19:46.960]  The great bloody lust, the great feast, everything.
[19:46.960 --> 19:50.800]  We're going to come back and play you some of the audio of the excise cuss words out.
[19:50.800 --> 19:55.240]  And we've got audio in the video while it's still up there at infowars.com, where they're
[19:55.240 --> 20:01.080]  laughing about the kids, shouldn't bring kids to a war zone.
[20:01.080 --> 20:02.600]  No blood pressure, naturally.
[20:02.600 --> 20:03.600]  How would that make you feel?
[20:03.600 --> 20:05.600]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[20:05.600 --> 20:07.960]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[20:07.960 --> 20:12.680]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood
[20:12.680 --> 20:15.640]  sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[20:15.640 --> 20:17.200]  My health was a mess, pretty much.
[20:17.200 --> 20:19.920]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[20:19.920 --> 20:24.440]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping
[20:24.440 --> 20:25.440]  a lot better.
[20:25.440 --> 20:30.960]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[20:30.960 --> 20:34.120]  Because these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance
[20:34.120 --> 20:43.160]  of heart and body extract, order at hbextract.com, or call 866-295-5305, that's hbextract.com,
[20:43.160 --> 20:46.160]  or call 866-295-5305.
[20:46.160 --> 20:50.600]  Folks, I did not expect this at all, by the seventh, eighth, and ninth day, I saw dramatic
[20:50.600 --> 20:53.200]  improvements from taking heart and body extract.
[20:53.200 --> 21:00.640]  Details at hbextract.com, or call 866-295-5305, or heart and body extract.
[21:00.640 --> 21:03.040]  They help to create a new world order.
[21:03.040 --> 21:05.080]  We are part of a new world order.
[21:05.080 --> 21:09.000]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.680]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[21:12.680 --> 21:13.680]  documents.
[21:13.680 --> 21:18.160]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[21:18.160 --> 21:20.640]  It means all the world under their control.
[21:20.640 --> 21:23.400]  The United Nations would take over America.
[21:23.400 --> 21:26.720]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[21:26.720 --> 21:31.640]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[21:31.640 --> 21:34.160]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[21:34.160 --> 21:38.640]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[21:38.640 --> 21:39.640]  financial system.
[21:39.640 --> 21:42.520]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[21:42.520 --> 21:46.200]  So it's going to be an inner, ruling elite, and then everyone else.

[24:15.000 --> 24:31.040]  Keep shooting, keep shooting, keep shooting, keep shooting.
[24:31.040 --> 24:51.320]  Keep shooting, keep shooting, keep shooting.
[24:51.320 --> 25:04.900]  Keep shooting, keep shooting, keep shooting.
[25:04.900 --> 25:07.160]  Keep shooting.
[25:07.160 --> 25:09.960]  to be wounded, trying to crawl away.
[25:09.960 --> 25:11.760]  Yeah, we won't shoot anymore.
[25:11.760 --> 25:12.920]  Just kidding, no.
[25:12.920 --> 25:14.520]  Maybe he has a weapon down in his hand?
[25:14.520 --> 25:15.960]  No, I haven't seen one yet.
[25:15.960 --> 25:18.880]  See, you guys got that guy crawling right now on a curb?
[25:18.880 --> 25:19.640]  Yeah, I got him.
[25:19.640 --> 25:20.600]  I put two rounds in here.
[25:20.600 --> 25:24.920]  I'm sure you guys already know there too, so we'll see.
[25:24.920 --> 25:26.360]  Yeah, we're not gonna.
[25:26.360 --> 25:28.800]  Oh my god, just pick up a weapon.
[25:28.800 --> 25:30.760]  This is 2-6 Roger.
[25:30.760 --> 25:32.000]  I'll pop players.
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.840]  We also have one individual moving.
[25:33.840 --> 25:35.080]  We're looking for weapons.
[25:35.080 --> 25:39.680]  If we see a weapon, we're going to engage.
[25:39.680 --> 25:41.680]  Now, pushmaster, we have a van that's
[25:41.680 --> 25:44.600]  approaching and picking up the bodies.
[25:44.600 --> 25:46.160]  Roger, break.
[25:46.160 --> 25:49.360]  Crazy Horse 1-8, you request permission to engage.
[25:49.360 --> 25:51.360]  Is he up picking up the wounded?
[25:51.360 --> 25:54.600]  Yeah, we're trying to get permission to engage.
[25:54.600 --> 25:57.000]  Come on, let's just shoot.
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.880]  We're taking him.
[25:58.880 --> 26:00.360]  Bookmaster 7, Roger.
[26:00.360 --> 26:03.400]  This is Bookmaster 7, Roger, engage.
[26:03.400 --> 26:04.640]  1-8, engage.
[26:04.640 --> 26:05.440]  Clear.
[26:05.440 --> 26:05.920]  Come on.
[26:09.320 --> 26:09.820]  Clear.
[26:12.720 --> 26:13.520]  Clear.
[26:13.520 --> 26:16.880]  1-8, engage.
[26:16.880 --> 26:17.640]  Oh yeah, look at that.
[26:17.640 --> 26:20.640]  Right through the windshield.
[26:20.640 --> 26:22.640]  This guy just drove over a body.
[26:22.640 --> 26:23.640]  Did he?
[26:23.640 --> 26:24.640]  Yeah.
[26:24.640 --> 26:28.080]  Roger, 5-2-4-3, change zone 4.
[26:28.080 --> 26:30.400]  Hey, I need to get the brass to drop ramps.
[26:30.400 --> 26:31.840]  I got a wounded girl.
[26:31.840 --> 26:34.240]  We didn't take the rough to mine.
[26:34.240 --> 26:36.480]  It's their fault for bringing their kids to a battle.
[26:36.480 --> 26:39.000]  That's right.
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.040]  It's their fault.
[26:40.040 --> 26:42.400]  So the ground troops show up to see it's a bunch of dead
[26:42.400 --> 26:44.760]  civilians and no weapons.
[26:44.760 --> 26:47.160]  And two little girls splattered.
[26:47.160 --> 26:49.760]  And you see the troops grab the children up and start
[26:49.760 --> 26:50.760]  running away with them.
[26:50.760 --> 26:53.160]  And they say, hey, we need medical support here.
[26:53.160 --> 26:54.840]  By the way, the medical support didn't come.
[26:54.840 --> 26:57.160]  They said, nope, you're not taking them to our base.
[26:57.160 --> 26:59.800]  You're not taking them to a US hospital.
[26:59.800 --> 27:02.720]  You take them to the Iraqi police station.
[27:02.720 --> 27:05.680]  You can go to infowars.com and watch the unedited video.
[27:05.680 --> 27:09.000]  And I see comments on infowars.com and prisonpina.com
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.640]  and on our YouTube postings.
[27:10.640 --> 27:12.760]  It's the minority, but they're there saying,
[27:12.760 --> 27:14.920]  how dare you talk bad about our troops?
[27:14.920 --> 27:16.000]  This is war.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.160]  What do you think it is?
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.000]  So I guess then when other governments kill women
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.720]  and children, it's OK.
[27:23.720 --> 27:27.360]  I guess then that there's laws against this, that that's bad.
[27:27.360 --> 27:30.720]  I guess the rape rooms at Abu Ghraib are good too.
[27:30.720 --> 27:34.680]  And I guess we're there liberating the Iraqis.
[27:34.680 --> 27:36.960]  I guess we're there to help them, right?
[27:36.960 --> 27:41.760]  They had a 300,000 man army in 2003.
[27:41.760 --> 27:44.520]  And our military says they went around their army
[27:44.520 --> 27:46.200]  and only killed a small percentage.
[27:46.200 --> 27:48.640]  So how is it over a dead million Iraqis?
[27:51.440 --> 27:53.440]  And why is it so funny?
[27:53.440 --> 27:57.120]  And why do people deny that the puppy throwing is fake?
[27:57.120 --> 27:59.600]  When here's CNN, puppy throwing marine
[27:59.600 --> 28:02.840]  is removed from the core.
[28:02.840 --> 28:05.240]  A US Marine videotape throwing a puppy over a cliff
[28:05.240 --> 28:07.800]  while on patrol in Iraq has been kicked out of the core.
[28:07.800 --> 28:09.800]  And a second Marine involved has been disciplined according
[28:09.800 --> 28:11.640]  to statements released by the Marines.
[28:11.640 --> 28:13.200]  This is from two years ago.
[28:13.200 --> 28:15.720]  But they have their psyops all over my site
[28:15.720 --> 28:17.200]  saying it wasn't real.
[28:17.200 --> 28:20.040]  They know full well the dog was real
[28:20.040 --> 28:22.520]  and that we don't have any human empathy for our fellow man
[28:22.520 --> 28:23.200]  anymore.
[28:23.200 --> 28:26.000]  Here's the puppy clip.
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.480]  Cute little puppy.
[28:28.480 --> 28:31.480]  Oh, so cute, so cute little puppy.
[28:31.480 --> 28:35.720]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's me.
[28:35.720 --> 28:37.720]  That's mean.
[28:37.720 --> 28:40.240]  How's mean with that?
[28:40.240 --> 28:41.400]  That's mean.
[28:44.280 --> 28:46.040]  They just want to kill.
[28:46.040 --> 28:49.040]  And when they're back on your streets as cops,
[28:49.040 --> 28:52.800]  I've seen statistics as high as 81% of new police
[28:52.800 --> 28:56.760]  that the government recruits are veterans of Iraq
[28:56.760 --> 28:58.240]  and Afghanistan.
[28:58.240 --> 29:01.320]  Now, many of them aren't psychopathic, deranged,
[29:01.320 --> 29:04.480]  bloodthirsty demons.
[29:04.480 --> 29:07.040]  But many of them are.
[29:07.040 --> 29:09.280]  And that's why we see them shooting people in the back,
[29:09.280 --> 29:11.920]  beating women, tasering pregnant women.
[29:11.920 --> 29:14.680]  It is a culture of waging war.
[29:14.680 --> 29:17.120]  And now law enforcement is paramilitary.
[29:17.120 --> 29:18.000]  What's the military do?
[29:18.000 --> 29:19.000]  They kill people.
[29:19.000 --> 29:20.120]  They break things.
[29:20.120 --> 29:23.080]  They go after enemies.
[29:23.080 --> 29:25.560]  And there's always been atrocities in war.
[29:25.560 --> 29:28.240]  But if you study what our military's become,
[29:28.240 --> 29:31.560]  it's one of the most vicious and abusive and psychopathic.
[29:31.560 --> 29:34.000]  I mean, they paint 666 on their tanks.
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.200]  And helicopters, they hang human skulls off of them.
[29:37.200 --> 29:39.440]  I will assure you that our military didn't
[29:39.440 --> 29:41.600]  do that under George Washington.
[29:41.600 --> 29:44.480]  And our military didn't do that in World War II.
[29:44.480 --> 29:46.200]  They're turning into demons.
[29:46.200 --> 29:47.760]  And it's being encouraged.
[29:47.760 --> 29:50.760]  And they're going to be put over us to control our lives.
[29:50.760 --> 29:54.600]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.600 --> 29:57.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.240 --> 30:02.640]  They helped to create a new world order.
[30:02.640 --> 30:04.920]  We are part of a new world order.
[30:04.920 --> 30:08.080]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[30:08.080 --> 30:11.240]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[30:11.240 --> 30:13.280]  through their own words and documents.
[30:13.280 --> 30:15.280]  The new world order really is a tool
[30:15.280 --> 30:17.720]  for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[30:17.720 --> 30:20.240]  It means all the world under their control.
[30:20.240 --> 30:23.000]  The United Nations would take over America.
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.840]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[30:25.840 --> 30:29.360]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence
[30:29.360 --> 30:31.320]  have worked in stealth for centuries
[30:31.320 --> 30:33.840]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[30:33.840 --> 30:35.640]  I believe, first of all, that we now
[30:35.640 --> 30:37.800]  need nothing short of a world constitution
[30:37.800 --> 30:39.200]  for the global financial system.
[30:39.200 --> 30:42.040]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[30:42.040 --> 30:45.320]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone
[30:45.320 --> 30:45.760]  else.
[30:45.760 --> 30:46.840]  And I got news for you.
[30:46.840 --> 30:48.120]  You're everyone else.
[30:48.120 --> 30:49.600]  Invisible Empire.

[31:00.600 --> 31:04.760]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[31:04.760 --> 31:06.040]  tyranny is here.
[31:06.040 --> 31:09.960]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[31:09.960 --> 31:12.360]  It really says that the state is God.
[31:12.360 --> 31:14.960]  The United States is now recognized globally
[31:14.960 --> 31:18.080]  as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[31:18.080 --> 31:20.480]  This film conclusively proves the existence
[31:20.480 --> 31:22.560]  of a secret network of FEMA cams.
[31:22.560 --> 31:25.640]  Now being expanded nationwide, this documentary
[31:25.640 --> 31:28.040]  exposes how the continuity of government program
[31:28.040 --> 31:30.720]  has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[31:30.720 --> 31:33.120]  Police state forward chronicles the sickening depths
[31:33.120 --> 31:34.880]  to which our republic has fallen.
[31:34.880 --> 31:38.120]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency
[31:38.120 --> 31:42.280]  dictatorship, body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[31:42.280 --> 31:45.080]  stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[31:45.080 --> 31:48.680]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[31:48.680 --> 31:50.600]  The police state isn't coming.
[31:50.600 --> 31:51.680]  It's here.

[32:00.000 --> 32:02.120]  Hi, this is Steve Shanky, FoodStrike.
[32:02.120 --> 32:06.080]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program
[32:06.080 --> 32:07.520]  and have started production.
[32:07.520 --> 32:08.880]  Congratulations.
[32:08.880 --> 32:11.520]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food
[32:11.520 --> 32:15.200]  supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[32:15.200 --> 32:17.600]  Shipments will begin the end of March
[32:17.600 --> 32:20.320]  and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[32:20.320 --> 32:21.400]  Now something fun.
[32:21.400 --> 32:22.440]  It's springtime.
[32:22.440 --> 32:25.800]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply,
[32:25.800 --> 32:28.280]  but they're a great supplement to your food reserve
[32:28.280 --> 32:30.360]  if you have the time and place to garden.
[32:30.360 --> 32:31.280]  Here's the plan.
[32:31.280 --> 32:33.760]  When you add a one month superfood spring
[32:33.760 --> 32:36.520]  pack to your food storage, we'll send you
[32:36.520 --> 32:40.120]  that garden of non-hybrid seeds absolutely free.
[32:40.120 --> 32:42.480]  Order now while the free seeds last.
[32:42.480 --> 32:49.120]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[32:49.120 --> 32:50.880]  Get a real supply of food to eat while you
[32:50.880 --> 32:53.160]  wait for your supplemental garden to grow.
[32:53.160 --> 33:00.640]  Call 800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[33:00.640 --> 33:19.360]  Jesse Ventura will be joining us live in the last hour today.
[33:19.360 --> 33:22.120]  Mike Rivera coming up in about 27 minutes from now
[33:22.120 --> 33:23.560]  in the second hour.
[33:23.560 --> 33:26.160]  We'll assemble cast three hours of the radio show
[33:26.160 --> 33:31.960]  at prisonplanet.tv, the second, third, and fourth hour today.
[33:31.960 --> 33:34.040]  Look, here's the deal.
[33:34.040 --> 33:38.680]  I don't like bashing the military.
[33:38.680 --> 33:42.880]  I have seen countless videos of the troops engaging
[33:42.880 --> 33:47.120]  in cold-blooded murder, abuse of animals.
[33:47.120 --> 33:49.800]  The Army's own report on torture admits
[33:49.800 --> 33:52.120]  that we were shown the mild photos.
[33:52.120 --> 33:54.000]  There are thousands of photos and videos
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.360]  from Abu Ghraib and other camps with them raping children
[33:57.360 --> 34:00.560]  with battery acid.
[34:00.560 --> 34:01.840]  And I can't even tell you more.
[34:01.840 --> 34:04.680]  You have to read the report for yourself.
[34:04.680 --> 34:08.120]  They do satanic rituals according to mainstream newspapers
[34:08.120 --> 34:10.120]  to freak out the Muslims.
[34:10.120 --> 34:11.440]  It's not to freak them out.
[34:11.440 --> 34:15.080]  This is what the psychiatrist at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay
[34:15.080 --> 34:16.680]  like.
[34:16.680 --> 34:19.760]  It has been confirmed for five years
[34:19.760 --> 34:24.880]  that they bring in hookers who are menstruating to.
[34:24.880 --> 34:28.560]  In fact, I'm going to just stop there, OK?
[34:28.560 --> 34:31.080]  They put them on PCP, LSD.
[34:31.080 --> 34:33.920]  They dress up in devil outfits.
[34:33.920 --> 34:38.080]  And it is meant to just completely blow these people's minds.
[34:38.080 --> 34:41.600]  And then they break some of them, make them double agents,
[34:41.600 --> 34:44.520]  re-release them, and have them go out and carry out terror
[34:44.520 --> 34:45.560]  attacks.
[34:45.560 --> 34:47.560]  In fact, a Pentagon admitted a few years ago
[34:47.560 --> 34:50.040]  that Camp X-Ray, and of course, that's just a public site.
[34:50.040 --> 34:51.760]  They have hundreds of black sites that
[34:51.760 --> 34:53.360]  have been confirmed around the world,
[34:53.360 --> 34:58.200]  are actually mind-controlled laboratories.
[34:58.200 --> 35:00.480]  And it's not just mind-controlling those they're torturing.
[35:00.480 --> 35:03.720]  It's mind-controlling the psychologists, the psychiatrist,
[35:03.720 --> 35:07.960]  and the jailguards to see if they will do these types of things.
[35:07.960 --> 35:10.800]  What do you think the Pentagon does when back in the 40s, 50s,
[35:10.800 --> 35:13.880]  60s, 70s, 80s, 90s until today, we'll
[35:13.880 --> 35:18.320]  put troops, our own troops, in a chamber and tell them
[35:18.320 --> 35:20.320]  they're going to have the flu tested on them,
[35:20.320 --> 35:21.520]  and then nerve gas them.
[35:21.520 --> 35:23.320]  And then they dissect their bodies
[35:23.320 --> 35:27.280]  and tell their families they died of the flu.
[35:27.280 --> 35:28.800]  That's part of Project Shad.
[35:31.760 --> 35:34.960]  So this is a culture of psychopathic abuse.
[35:34.960 --> 35:38.160]  And I want to remind the military,
[35:38.160 --> 35:39.680]  the federal government is announcing
[35:39.680 --> 35:42.520]  they want to make you buy your own health insurance
[35:42.520 --> 35:45.360]  and not even pay for your VA care.
[35:45.360 --> 35:47.160]  They have put hundreds of thousands
[35:47.160 --> 35:52.520]  of veterans on PTSD list, no judge, no jury, no trial,
[35:52.520 --> 35:53.920]  violates the Second Amendment.
[35:53.920 --> 35:56.440]  There is no law that they can ban your Second Amendment.
[35:56.440 --> 35:59.360]  But now that they have the NICS system, that's a database.
[35:59.360 --> 36:01.000]  They just do it by fiat.
[36:01.000 --> 36:02.440]  And now the White House is saying,
[36:02.440 --> 36:05.480]  anybody we don't like will put on the no-gun buy list.
[36:05.480 --> 36:08.040]  It's the no-fly-no-buy law.
[36:08.040 --> 36:12.440]  But they're already implementing it by fiat without a law.
[36:12.440 --> 36:14.280]  And remember the Mayak at Homeland Security
[36:14.280 --> 36:16.040]  reports that we broke here last year
[36:16.040 --> 36:17.480]  that we talked so much about?
[36:17.480 --> 36:20.000]  It says returning veterans are the number one
[36:20.000 --> 36:21.480]  threat to Homeland Security.
[36:23.560 --> 36:25.440]  They mean returning veterans that are
[36:25.440 --> 36:27.920]  pro-Second Amendment, anti-New World Order.
[36:27.920 --> 36:31.800]  They love the types that they've psychologically profiled
[36:31.800 --> 36:33.840]  that are psychopathic killers.
[36:33.840 --> 36:38.080]  But the troops that did their job and didn't violate
[36:38.080 --> 36:41.360]  their code, and that's why they have questionnaires.
[36:41.360 --> 36:43.360]  Will you fire on US citizens?
[36:43.360 --> 36:44.640]  And that's been put in the database.
[36:44.640 --> 36:50.840]  If you say no, then suddenly you get
[36:50.840 --> 36:52.520]  put on the no-fly-no-buy list.
[36:52.520 --> 36:53.360]  You get targeted.
[36:53.360 --> 36:54.640]  You get followed.
[36:54.640 --> 36:56.880]  But if you're just a little psychopathic killer,
[36:56.880 --> 36:59.320]  they recruit you into the police departments
[36:59.320 --> 37:00.280]  via Homeland Security.
[37:00.280 --> 37:03.080]  In fact, Jaren, yesterday you showed me that ad,
[37:03.080 --> 37:04.840]  that Homeland Security ad saying,
[37:04.840 --> 37:06.120]  become part of Homeland Security.
[37:06.120 --> 37:07.000]  Be a security guard.
[37:07.000 --> 37:07.960]  Be a police officer.
[37:07.960 --> 37:11.840]  Be a everything's Homeland Security now.
[37:11.840 --> 37:15.160]  And so you wonder how at the G20 in Pittsburgh last year,
[37:15.160 --> 37:18.600]  and this is in the film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA,
[37:18.600 --> 37:21.800]  how they could have police with women coming out
[37:21.800 --> 37:23.160]  of grocery stores with bags.
[37:23.160 --> 37:24.800]  And they say, no one allowed on the streets.
[37:24.800 --> 37:27.280]  And the women say, officer, it's old women.
[37:27.280 --> 37:29.120]  I'm just going to my car.
[37:29.120 --> 37:32.480]  And they released the police dog on them.
[37:32.480 --> 37:33.720]  You wonder why that's going on.
[37:33.720 --> 37:36.960]  You wonder why they were out at night going into the universities
[37:36.960 --> 37:39.840]  where they knew people be outside in the park.
[37:40.720 --> 37:42.280]  And they would say, you're not allowed to be anywhere
[37:42.280 --> 37:43.720]  on the streets during the G20.
[37:43.720 --> 37:46.960]  And the kids would try to run, but they hadn't boxed in.
[37:46.960 --> 37:50.560]  They would physically attack them three nights in a row.
[37:50.560 --> 37:51.960]  They wanted to attack.
[37:51.960 --> 37:53.600]  They wanted to engage.
[37:53.600 --> 37:55.040]  They wanted to fire rubber bullets.
[37:55.040 --> 37:56.920]  They wanted to fire microwave guns.
[37:56.920 --> 37:59.000]  They wanted to fire sound cannons.
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.320]  And then the video got released multiple angles
[38:02.320 --> 38:07.320]  of a champagne police sedan, LTD, pulling up,
[38:07.520 --> 38:11.360]  jumping out, grabbing a demonstrator,
[38:11.360 --> 38:13.480]  shoving him in the car and driving away.
[38:13.480 --> 38:14.360]  And it was on drugs.
[38:14.360 --> 38:15.440]  It was everywhere.
[38:15.440 --> 38:17.640]  And then the neocons put out reports saying,
[38:17.640 --> 38:18.960]  this isn't real.
[38:20.880 --> 38:22.560]  And then the G20 came out the next day and said,
[38:22.560 --> 38:24.240]  well, no, it is real.
[38:24.240 --> 38:27.640]  Those were private security forces hired by us
[38:27.640 --> 38:30.080]  in military uniforms.
[38:30.080 --> 38:34.640]  So even worse, just unnamed contractors driving around,
[38:34.640 --> 38:36.880]  snatching and grabbing citizens,
[38:36.880 --> 38:39.200]  cramming them into cars, disappearing.
[38:41.920 --> 38:43.880]  And black sites all over the world
[38:43.880 --> 38:46.760]  where they're torturing people and flying Americans out.
[38:46.760 --> 38:49.400]  And now the news openly announcing they're doing this.
[38:49.400 --> 38:50.920]  And they have the belligerent act saying,
[38:50.920 --> 38:53.400]  for any intelligence purpose or any reason dictated
[38:53.400 --> 39:00.400]  by the president, U.S. citizens can be grabbed and taken away.
[39:04.240 --> 39:06.880]  We were the greatest nation on earth.
[39:06.880 --> 39:12.880]  Now we have been turned into a country filled
[39:14.120 --> 39:17.120]  with corrupt, piratical hitmen who work
[39:17.120 --> 39:18.480]  for the offshore banks.
[39:20.480 --> 39:23.080]  It's the enjoyment of the murder of children
[39:23.080 --> 39:25.800]  and women and unarmed men and animals.
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.080]  It's the enjoyment, the giggling, the snickering,
[39:31.080 --> 39:32.120]  the laughing.
[39:33.040 --> 39:35.320]  It's the dehumanization as we're trained
[39:35.320 --> 39:38.800]  that our fellow man are worse than Ponskum
[39:38.800 --> 39:40.760]  and as the troops themselves
[39:44.200 --> 39:47.440]  are dehumanized and turned into animals.
[39:47.440 --> 39:50.440]  This will and is already coming back on us.
[39:50.440 --> 39:55.440]  This has scientifically been set up to create huge armies
[39:57.160 --> 40:00.720]  of sadistic psychopath bloodlusting murderers.
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.560]  The loss of our soul really began with the Native Americans
[40:07.560 --> 40:10.120]  because, oh, they're a group different from us
[40:10.120 --> 40:11.920]  so we can round them up, we can kill them,
[40:11.920 --> 40:12.920]  we can starve them to death,
[40:12.920 --> 40:15.920]  we can mow down men, women and children at wounded knee.
[40:15.920 --> 40:20.520]  Then it expanded, oh, the Japanese attacked us.
[40:20.520 --> 40:22.000]  They're trying to surrender for a month.
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.920]  We're gonna drop two A-bombs on civilian cities.
[40:26.080 --> 40:29.460]  Then, Colonel Salome wanted to nuke the Russians.
[40:33.560 --> 40:37.480]  Remember Dresden, 500,000 plus people died in one night
[40:37.480 --> 40:41.560]  when they fire bombed the city with incendiary bombs.
[40:41.560 --> 40:44.200]  Over 1,000 US aircraft bombed it.
[40:44.200 --> 40:48.480]  Over 500,000 people died and folks say,
[40:48.480 --> 40:50.760]  oh, well, Hitler attacked us.
[40:50.760 --> 40:52.800]  The Germans deserve that, really?
[40:52.800 --> 40:54.960]  Hitler for the first four months of the Blitzkrieg
[40:54.960 --> 40:57.040]  wouldn't even bomb cities.
[40:57.040 --> 40:58.600]  Not saying Hitler was good,
[40:58.600 --> 41:00.800]  but that had never really before been done.
[41:01.900 --> 41:03.840]  Carpet bombing of cities.
[41:03.840 --> 41:08.840]  And then the US-backed British,
[41:09.240 --> 41:10.800]  with aircraft we'd given them,
[41:10.800 --> 41:13.280]  flew missions with over 500 aircraft
[41:13.280 --> 41:18.280]  to carpet bomb, this is mainline history,
[41:18.640 --> 41:23.000]  to carpet bomb Berlin and other cities
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.720]  to get Hitler, Churchill,
[41:25.720 --> 41:28.000]  this is how cold-blooded Churchill was.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.400]  Churchill knew that he would get more political support
[41:30.400 --> 41:32.400]  if Hitler targeted cities,
[41:32.400 --> 41:34.000]  that it would anger the British.
[41:35.040 --> 41:38.200]  And so they ran a mission to bomb Berlin
[41:38.200 --> 41:41.600]  to get Hitler to target British cities.
[41:41.600 --> 41:43.600]  And another reason was,
[41:43.600 --> 41:46.480]  Hitler was starting to knock out the RAF bases
[41:46.480 --> 41:48.160]  and the military bases,
[41:48.160 --> 41:50.560]  and they wanted him to shift onto the cities
[41:50.560 --> 41:52.720]  so that they wouldn't have their military destroyed.
[41:52.720 --> 41:55.400]  Very cold-blooded, but the calculation worked.
[41:55.400 --> 41:57.960]  So get yourself into the mindset
[41:58.960 --> 42:02.080]  of Churchill wanting Hitler to bomb British cities
[42:04.600 --> 42:06.440]  to get the British anger going
[42:06.440 --> 42:11.440]  and ask yourself what our military, stage 9-11,
[42:12.680 --> 42:14.880]  to get their project for New American Century launched.
[42:14.880 --> 42:17.440]  Well, they wrote that they would stage attacks,
[42:17.440 --> 42:18.360]  that they needed attacks.
[42:18.360 --> 42:22.560]  Mzygna Brzezinski, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney,
[42:22.560 --> 42:24.360]  they all wrote books, all wrote publications
[42:24.360 --> 42:26.120]  in the years before bragging about it.
[42:26.120 --> 42:27.160]  The Hart-Rubbin Commission,
[42:27.160 --> 42:29.240]  I have video clips of them saying,
[42:29.240 --> 42:31.760]  we needed a new Pearl Harbor and we got one,
[42:31.760 --> 42:36.760]  we're gonna make lemons, lemonade out of these lemons.
[42:39.760 --> 42:43.160]  But the bigger issue here,
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  the large issue is that you have all these Neocon
[42:52.080 --> 42:56.400]  publications that Paul Watson's linked to in his article,
[42:56.400 --> 43:02.560]  Neocon's Defend Massacre of Iraqi Journalist Children,
[43:02.560 --> 43:05.040]  defending it saying it's good.
[43:06.560 --> 43:10.280]  Remember four or five months after 9-11 in early 2002,
[43:10.280 --> 43:11.360]  it's in my film, Road to Terrority,
[43:11.360 --> 43:13.520]  the Washington Post article,
[43:13.520 --> 43:16.840]  they had the CIA section chief for the Middle East saying,
[43:16.840 --> 43:19.680]  yeah, we take people's children and we torture them
[43:19.680 --> 43:22.760]  in front of them at secret sites in Jordan
[43:22.760 --> 43:26.840]  and in Egypt and in other nations.
[43:26.840 --> 43:29.760]  See, they thought they had you scared, angry,
[43:29.760 --> 43:31.160]  ready to do anything.
[43:31.160 --> 43:33.480]  So at that time, Rumsfeld got up and gave speeches
[43:33.480 --> 43:35.560]  about taking the gloves off and torturing people
[43:35.560 --> 43:37.560]  and they said, yeah, we're torturing kids
[43:37.560 --> 43:40.120]  and yeah, and dying cores grabbing some other kids
[43:40.120 --> 43:41.640]  when they're in other countries that aren't related,
[43:41.640 --> 43:43.040]  but hey, that's part of it, it's a war,
[43:43.040 --> 43:44.840]  we like to sell the kids.
[43:45.880 --> 43:47.680]  Oh yeah, that's Chicago Tribune.
[43:47.680 --> 43:52.680]  No, the truth is all of us are seen as worthless,
[43:54.160 --> 43:57.920]  all of us are seen as trash, all of us are seen as filth
[43:57.920 --> 44:01.520]  and these top psychopaths launch these wars,
[44:01.520 --> 44:03.800]  not just to get oil and weapons sales,
[44:03.800 --> 44:08.120]  but to create armies of ruthless killers
[44:08.120 --> 44:11.400]  who aren't gonna come back and found the hell's angels.
[44:14.240 --> 44:17.520]  They're not gonna come back and found the Mongols.
[44:17.520 --> 44:19.920]  You know, the roughest, toughest biker gangs
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.120]  were just veterans who came back
[44:24.120 --> 44:26.560]  and were ruthless and were screwed up
[44:26.560 --> 44:28.120]  and they said, why don't I run some hookers
[44:28.120 --> 44:29.680]  and run some drugs and I'll kill anybody,
[44:29.680 --> 44:31.920]  gets in my way, I wanna die anyways.
[44:31.920 --> 44:35.120]  Well, now your former psycho killer military people,
[44:35.120 --> 44:38.080]  they don't become hell's angels,
[44:38.080 --> 44:43.080]  they don't become Mongols, they become APD,
[44:43.600 --> 44:47.080]  Austin Police Department, they become LAPD,
[44:47.080 --> 44:50.880]  they become NYPD, they become Miami PD,
[44:50.880 --> 44:52.760]  they become Houston PD
[44:57.400 --> 45:00.680]  and they run our lives, they become FBI
[45:03.360 --> 45:07.360]  and to them killing somebody is like wiping dog crap
[45:08.640 --> 45:09.960]  off their feet, excuse me.
[45:11.480 --> 45:14.760]  You are seen as scum, as trash,
[45:14.760 --> 45:17.600]  as dehumanized filth.
[45:21.440 --> 45:22.480]  Coming up in the next hour,
[45:22.480 --> 45:24.440]  I'm gonna play the puppy murder video,
[45:24.440 --> 45:27.520]  I'm gonna play U.S. troops running over a family's car
[45:27.520 --> 45:29.360]  for no reason, I'm gonna play,
[45:29.360 --> 45:30.680]  I'm sure Watson's found it by now,
[45:30.680 --> 45:32.560]  is Watson the master of finding everything,
[45:32.560 --> 45:33.960]  is he sent you the footage of the guy going,
[45:33.960 --> 45:38.160]  there's two of them, search engine the term,
[45:38.160 --> 45:41.280]  U.S. troops beat Iraqi youth or children,
[45:41.280 --> 45:43.700]  that's got guys making the demon noises,
[45:43.700 --> 45:48.000]  you did find that, oh, he sent you a bunch, good.
[45:48.000 --> 45:49.560]  Yeah, but Watson can just research
[45:49.560 --> 45:51.000]  under the same names if they've been pulled,
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.200]  they're always pulling them, it's like whack-a-mole.
[45:53.200 --> 45:55.840]  I want the ones where the old mangy dog walks up
[45:55.840 --> 45:59.600]  to the camp just wanting some beanie-weenies or something
[45:59.600 --> 46:02.980]  and they're so dehumanized,
[46:02.980 --> 46:06.880]  these troops are such demon-possessed husk of humans,
[46:06.880 --> 46:08.360]  oh, you can't demonize that dog
[46:08.360 --> 46:11.120]  and call it a hodge, can you?
[46:11.120 --> 46:14.000]  You can't call it a rag-head dog,
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.440]  that's why people do get mad at these,
[46:15.440 --> 46:16.880]  they always pull these,
[46:16.880 --> 46:19.760]  because, and the dog walks over and they say,
[46:19.760 --> 46:24.520]  you want some food, you pathetic ugly piece of garbage,
[46:24.520 --> 46:27.680]  you pathetic sickening piece of filth,
[46:27.680 --> 46:30.120]  to have this in a shotgun at its back legs
[46:30.120 --> 46:31.000]  and it's sitting there and they go,
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.120]  oh, you're in pain now, you pathetic piece of filth,
[46:37.120 --> 46:38.440]  and they kill it,
[46:38.440 --> 46:40.160]  see it always takes more to get them excited,
[46:40.160 --> 46:43.120]  they'd already killed countless children or countless women,
[46:43.120 --> 46:44.680]  they'd already sat on the side of the road
[46:44.680 --> 46:46.040]  shooting innocent people,
[46:46.040 --> 46:48.360]  that didn't get them off anymore.
[46:48.360 --> 46:50.520]  So they always like demons,
[46:50.520 --> 46:53.120]  like tortures, like Joseph Mingle on a dungeon
[46:53.120 --> 46:56.080]  after lean over the wounded creature
[46:56.080 --> 47:00.320]  and just extract the satanic power from its pain.
[47:04.200 --> 47:05.480]  It's just entertainment,
[47:05.480 --> 47:09.160]  you drive by in Northern Iraq,
[47:09.160 --> 47:11.720]  occurred, he's even your ally,
[47:11.720 --> 47:14.520]  doesn't matter, he's out there with sheep,
[47:18.480 --> 47:21.120]  he works for a living, he's out there tending to sheep,
[47:21.120 --> 47:23.280]  they just throw a hand grenade out of the Humvee,
[47:23.280 --> 47:25.920]  it blows up the middle of the sheep and the man
[47:25.920 --> 47:27.560]  and they all just laugh,
[47:27.560 --> 47:29.600]  that guy was worth just a laugh,
[47:29.600 --> 47:31.600]  his life, his family, his children,
[47:31.600 --> 47:36.040]  his wife, his home, his sheep,
[47:36.040 --> 47:39.400]  his little life, it meant nothing to those guys
[47:39.400 --> 47:41.720]  and they're all gonna be police officers
[47:41.720 --> 47:43.920]  and they're gonna be pulling your wife over,
[47:43.920 --> 47:45.680]  they're gonna be pulling your daughter over
[47:45.680 --> 47:48.560]  and nobody's gonna bring them to justice
[47:48.560 --> 47:50.320]  and they're gonna be part of the SWAT teams
[47:50.320 --> 47:51.640]  that come for your guns,
[47:51.640 --> 47:52.920]  they're gonna be the people that come
[47:52.920 --> 47:55.320]  when the environmentalists are taking your ranch and farm,
[47:55.320 --> 47:56.400]  they're gonna be there
[47:58.280 --> 48:00.440]  and if you dare lift a hand
[48:00.440 --> 48:03.640]  or you even speak to them, you even argue with them,
[48:03.640 --> 48:06.120]  they're gonna take a rifle butt and knock your teeth out
[48:06.120 --> 48:09.120]  and drag your wife in the back and have their way with her.
[48:10.400 --> 48:13.240]  I've got three articles today of cops kidnapping people,
[48:13.240 --> 48:16.000]  raping him, holding him for ransom, robbing banks,
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.280]  I never even cover this stuff,
[48:17.280 --> 48:19.480]  did you know maybe one time out of a hundred
[48:19.480 --> 48:20.760]  do I cover the news I have,
[48:20.760 --> 48:24.200]  maybe I should just spend the whole show every day
[48:24.200 --> 48:26.680]  with the raping and the killing and the murdering
[48:26.680 --> 48:30.040]  and the cops killing their wives and killing their kids
[48:30.040 --> 48:32.400]  and the psychopathic murdering going on
[48:32.400 --> 48:34.520]  and a Delta Force unit coming home
[48:34.520 --> 48:37.960]  and three guys from their team murdering their wives
[48:37.960 --> 48:41.440]  and children and setting their houses on fire
[48:41.440 --> 48:44.000]  and they reported in the newspaper
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.880]  when the cops pulled up to one Delta Force guy's house,
[48:46.880 --> 48:49.800]  he was flopping around on the ground foaming at the mouth.
[48:50.720 --> 48:53.560]  Somebody call an exorcist, I mean, what do you call that?
[48:53.560 --> 48:55.640]  Flopping around foaming.
[48:55.640 --> 49:02.640]  This is what we've turned into, ladies and gentlemen,
[49:04.680 --> 49:08.680]  this is the demonic force being turned loose.
[49:08.680 --> 49:11.960]  We do have the demon guy,
[49:11.960 --> 49:13.560]  because you guys were nodding.
[49:16.080 --> 49:18.040]  There's hundreds.
[49:18.040 --> 49:19.320]  Well, then there's one specific,
[49:19.320 --> 49:23.080]  well, there's two where they make the same demon noise, what?
[49:23.080 --> 49:25.920]  Oh, he's getting a good.
[49:25.920 --> 49:27.800]  I mean, look, listen, I want you to hear this.
[49:27.800 --> 49:30.640]  You can't just make this stuff up and see, I'm the bad guy.
[49:30.640 --> 49:32.080]  I don't want the federal government
[49:32.080 --> 49:33.760]  to take your pension funds as they're now announcing
[49:33.760 --> 49:34.800]  or they're going to do.
[49:34.800 --> 49:35.840]  That's bad.
[49:35.840 --> 49:38.360]  I don't want hundreds of toxic chemicals put in the water
[49:38.360 --> 49:40.920]  by design to sterilize all of us and give us cancer.
[49:40.920 --> 49:41.960]  I'm the bad one.
[49:41.960 --> 49:44.080]  I read mainstream news calling for world government,
[49:44.080 --> 49:45.880]  unelected world government, run our lives.
[49:45.880 --> 49:47.520]  I'm the bad guy because I'm against it.
[49:47.520 --> 49:49.840]  I'm against killing dogs and laughing about it
[49:49.840 --> 49:51.760]  and enjoying it and leering over it
[49:51.760 --> 49:53.360]  or laughing about dead children.
[49:53.360 --> 49:54.560]  You've just machine gun.
[49:54.560 --> 49:56.360]  I'm the bad man, not them.
[49:57.200 --> 49:59.320]  I'm against taking our troops and putting them in chambers
[49:59.320 --> 50:00.880]  and nerve-gassing them to death.
[50:00.880 --> 50:04.040]  I am bad, not those nerve-gassing them.
[50:04.040 --> 50:05.240]  Remember that.
[50:05.240 --> 50:07.080]  I'm the unpatriotic filth.
[50:07.080 --> 50:08.840]  I'm the unpatriotic garbage.
[50:08.840 --> 50:12.760]  I'm the evil one because if I teleported back
[50:12.760 --> 50:17.760]  to the Aztec kingdom 2000 years ago in central Mexico today
[50:17.900 --> 50:20.800]  and I said, don't sacrifice your children.
[50:20.800 --> 50:23.640]  Don't tear your wife's heart out.
[50:23.640 --> 50:26.680]  Don't go to the market and buy human flesh.
[50:26.680 --> 50:27.880]  This is dehumanizing.
[50:27.880 --> 50:28.720]  This is evil.
[50:28.720 --> 50:31.040]  They would look at me and say, you are crazy
[50:31.040 --> 50:33.360]  because in our culture, this is normal.
[50:33.360 --> 50:35.280]  So see, I am the bad one.
[50:36.360 --> 50:38.120]  I would be bad in Nazi Germany.
[50:38.120 --> 50:39.960]  I would be bad in Soviet Russia.
[50:39.960 --> 50:42.120]  I would be bad in the Aztec kingdom.
[50:42.120 --> 50:44.680]  I would be bad and we are all the bad people.
[50:44.680 --> 50:45.960]  You understand that now.
[50:45.960 --> 50:47.360]  This is now an inverse world.
[50:47.360 --> 50:49.640]  This is now the Antichrist playground
[50:49.640 --> 50:52.320]  where death and destruction and murder and slaughter
[50:52.320 --> 50:55.920]  and torture and evil and abuse of children is good
[50:55.920 --> 50:58.280]  and everything wholesome and decent is bad.
[50:58.280 --> 50:59.280]  We'll be right back.

[52:00.680 --> 52:03.080]  They helped to create a new world order.
[52:03.080 --> 52:05.360]  We are part of a new world order.
[52:05.360 --> 52:08.520]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[52:08.520 --> 52:11.680]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[52:11.680 --> 52:13.720]  through their own words and documents.
[52:13.720 --> 52:15.720]  The new world order really is a tool
[52:15.720 --> 52:18.160]  for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[52:18.160 --> 52:20.680]  It means all the world under their control.
[52:20.680 --> 52:23.440]  The United Nations would take over America.
[52:23.440 --> 52:26.280]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[52:26.280 --> 52:29.800]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence
[52:29.800 --> 52:31.760]  have worked in stealth for centuries
[52:31.760 --> 52:34.240]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:34.240 --> 52:37.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.640]  of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[52:39.640 --> 52:42.480]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[52:42.480 --> 52:44.840]  So it's going to be an inner, ruling elite
[52:44.840 --> 52:46.200]  and then everyone else.
[52:46.200 --> 52:47.280]  And I got news for you.
[52:47.280 --> 52:48.560]  You're everyone else.

[53:00.280 --> 53:01.120]  Fact.
[53:01.120 --> 53:02.320]  Four million people in the U.S.
[53:02.320 --> 53:04.360]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[53:04.360 --> 53:05.200]  Fact.
[53:05.200 --> 53:07.200]  Serosis of the liver is the eighth-leading cause
[53:07.200 --> 53:08.560]  of death among Americans.
[53:08.560 --> 53:09.400]  Fact.
[53:09.400 --> 53:11.680]  Alcohol, mini-prescription drugs, food additives,
[53:11.680 --> 53:14.680]  pesticides and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[53:14.680 --> 53:15.520]  Fact.
[53:15.520 --> 53:17.680]  One in 10 Americans is or has been affected
[53:17.680 --> 53:19.480]  by liver or gallbladder disease.
[53:19.480 --> 53:20.320]  Fact.
[53:20.320 --> 53:22.520]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job

[54:26.720 --> 54:29.320]  Yes.
[54:29.320 --> 54:30.760]  Yes.
[54:30.760 --> 54:32.080]  Yes.
[54:32.080 --> 54:33.760]  Yes.
[54:33.760 --> 55:00.760]  Oh, please, don't hurt me.
[55:00.760 --> 55:17.640]  MUSIC
[55:17.640 --> 55:19.080]  All right.
[55:19.080 --> 55:22.040]  Now, when we go live on prisonplanet.tv,
[55:22.040 --> 55:24.400]  we're going to be showing these videos.
[55:24.400 --> 55:26.960]  So viewer discretion is advised.
[55:26.960 --> 55:30.560]  I'd say one of those children is no older than six.
[55:30.560 --> 55:33.160]  He's on the ground with blood pouring out of his mouth.
[55:33.160 --> 55:35.520]  They're stomping on his testicles.
[55:35.520 --> 55:40.160]  British troops have grabbed three or four Iraqi children
[55:40.160 --> 55:42.240]  ages 12 to six.
[55:42.240 --> 55:45.000]  They take them behind the perimeter wall.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.800]  And the British troops are stomping on their testicles,
[55:47.800 --> 55:50.480]  stomping on their heads, beating them with batons.
[55:50.480 --> 55:53.840]  And US troops are up on a wall just going, yes.
[55:53.840 --> 55:56.800]  Oh, I mean, it's so demonic I can't even do the voice.
[55:56.800 --> 56:04.720]  And every time they stop their genitals, they just go, oh, yes.
[56:04.720 --> 56:07.480]  Oh, please, they enjoy the begging.
[56:07.480 --> 56:10.440]  That's like when Jeffrey Dahmer has some kids strapped down.
[56:10.440 --> 56:13.200]  He's like, oh, please just keep begging.
[56:13.200 --> 56:14.600]  It's our country now.
[56:14.600 --> 56:15.840]  We're being turned loose.
[56:15.840 --> 56:18.760]  The gates of hell have been released.
[56:18.760 --> 56:22.040]  Our forces will be with you fully soon.
[56:22.040 --> 56:24.160]  The gate is now opening.
[56:24.160 --> 56:26.480]  Yeah, glory.
[56:26.480 --> 56:28.480]  I love the power.
[56:28.480 --> 56:33.440]  We will rid your bodies, the black uniforms, the death cabs,
[56:33.440 --> 56:37.720]  that my master conjures in all nations in all ages.
[56:37.720 --> 56:40.320]  Soon with the high tech systems, our evil
[56:40.320 --> 56:44.840]  will be released at a level never before seen in human history.
[56:44.840 --> 56:48.040]  We plan to kill more than 80% of you.
[56:48.040 --> 56:51.520]  And the 20% we've told that we're not going to kill.
[56:51.520 --> 56:53.480]  We're going to kill later.
[56:53.480 --> 56:58.640]  Death and destruction and pain, nothing will be able to stop us.
[56:58.640 --> 57:01.720]  Oh, yes, it's so good.
[57:01.720 --> 57:03.360]  Play my brother now.
[57:03.360 --> 57:05.960]  Let us hear his victory dance.
[57:05.960 --> 57:07.760]  His orgy of pain.
[57:07.760 --> 57:10.600]  Hear him as the six-year-old is tortured.
[57:10.600 --> 57:11.640]  Play the clip.
[57:11.640 --> 57:25.200]  All right, we'll come back and play that later.
[57:42.560 --> 57:44.880]  This is the type of evil that we're talking about,
[57:44.880 --> 57:45.880]  ladies and gentlemen.
[57:45.880 --> 57:46.880]  Oh, yes, oh, yes.
[57:46.880 --> 57:47.880]  You're going to get it.
[57:51.880 --> 57:52.880]  Yes.
[57:52.880 --> 57:53.880]  No, two little boys.
[57:53.880 --> 57:54.880]  Yes.
[57:54.880 --> 57:55.880]  Yes.
[57:55.880 --> 57:56.880]  Yes.
[57:56.880 --> 57:57.880]  Yes.
[57:57.880 --> 57:58.880]  Yes.
[57:58.880 --> 57:59.880]  Yes.
[57:59.880 --> 58:15.880]  Oh, please, don't hurt me.
[58:15.880 --> 58:45.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:45.760 --> 58:50.520]  at GCN Live.com today.
[58:50.520 --> 58:54.520]  Hi this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[58:54.520 --> 58:59.120]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown
[58:59.120 --> 59:03.160]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true seeds have
[59:03.160 --> 59:06.680]  all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[59:06.680 --> 59:11.200]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect
[59:11.200 --> 59:17.440]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[59:17.440 --> 59:22.000]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part, these seeds have
[59:22.000 --> 59:26.640]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[59:26.640 --> 59:33.520]  acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com,
[59:33.520 --> 59:44.600]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[59:44.600 --> 01:00:05.280]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:22.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:27.560]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, the star of the new hit television investigation
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:34.200]  report, Conspiracy Theory. Jesse Ventura will be joining us in the last hour today.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.480]  Mike Rivera of whatreallyhappened.com joins us in this hour. I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.880]  and prisonplanet.com. We're going to be getting into the setup of the militias here in the
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:49.400]  U.S. ahead of government-sponsored stage terror to be blamed on the Tea Parties and all the
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.360]  good old boys that have loved all these wars. It's all actually been designed and set up
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:01:01.560]  for you. Obviously, we're going to talk about the confirmed children and the ambulance that
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:07.480]  came to get the dead and dying off the streets. This is from three years ago. WikiLeaks released
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:11.040]  this yesterday. They've been talking about releasing it the last week and a half. They
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.600]  said they've got a whole bunch of other videos of similar things. But this video is nothing
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:21.320]  compared to all the video we've got. I mean, there's countless videos that are being seen
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:27.360]  on international television shot by U.S. and British troops where you will have five, six,
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.200]  seven, eight-year-old kids being beaten, being killed, and there's the same demonic noise
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:42.560]  the troops make. It's like what a psycho does in movies. I guess that's modeled in the films
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.400]  after real psychos. I always thought growing up that Italian gangsters didn't really talk
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:52.360]  like that, like, oh, how you doing there, pal? Oh, yeah. Until I've been to New York quite
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.360]  a few times and actually met people that talk like that. I'm not knocking them. I'm just
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:02.360]  saying you think Hollywood's over-dramatizing psychopaths with someone belted into a gurney
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:07.640]  torturing them, going, oh, you go ahead and beg for your life and making these demonic
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:14.760]  victory noises of pleasure. I've seen video after video after video where our troops do
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:19.880]  this demonic pleasure thing. When they're killing women and children, especially, it's
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:26.320]  an added goodie. And this is an army of darkness. It's condoned. It's supported. It's promoted.
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.200]  This is what tough guys do. Of course, George Washington was the opposite of this. And there
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.200]  is collateral damage in war, but this whole war is based on fraud and a lie. So we're
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:41.280]  going to walk through. We've tried to edit the full unedited footage down to about 10
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:47.800]  minutes from 17, all the cussing and pleasuring themselves and dead kids and ran over that
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:52.320]  dead body. So we're going to be playing that while Rivera's on with us today and analyzing
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.360]  it piece by piece. But another issue is how the media is spending this saying this is
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.840]  a great thing. Or they're still saying this, the dead puppy throwing the puppy off the
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:07.320]  cliff is fake. When the Pentagon here singing in admits it's real. So there's this denial
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:11.760]  of what's going on. Mike Rivera, I would imagine you've seen the footage. Give us your take
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.760]  on it.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:18.320]  Well, I'm absolutely shocked by the footage, you know, to actually see it. I'm not surprised
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:24.520]  these things are happening. Looking at it, it's obvious that our troops are so conditioned
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:30.800]  to view anybody that is doing anything other than simply walking along as suspicious. We
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.480]  are now coming to understand that what those pilots thought were AK-47s were actually cameras
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.520]  with telephoto lenses being carried by these reporters for Reuters news. And the pilots
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.640]  just left to a conclusion. Oh, there's something on a strap. It's a long tube, must be some
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:50.000]  kind of weapon. And they got permission to fire and they just blasted everybody in the
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.800]  area. They didn't even target just the soldiers carrying or what they thought were soldiers
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:00.160]  carrying rifles. They simply blasted everybody in the area. And then the most sickening thing
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.560]  is you've got this guy on the ground, which we later find out is one of the Reuters reporters.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.280]  And he's just crawling, wounded, bleeding all over the place, trying to get out of the
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.680]  street up on the sidewalk. And they're talking about, can we shoot him? He's still alive.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:18.560]  Can we shoot him? Give us permission to shoot him. The van shows up. People get out to help
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:25.080]  this wounded guy. There is no sign of aggression. There's no sign of any weapons. There's no
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:30.680]  uniform or anything to indicate that these are hostile forces. The Apache crews get permission
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:34.680]  to fire and they just blast this van. Then we find out there are children in it. They
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.520]  were just there trying to help the guy. We've got a couple of dead Reuters reporters. It's
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.880]  disgusting. It really is. Well, and also when they're picking up his body, they go, that's
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.440]  a weapon, open fire. They can see it's his body. They're picking up. So they're framing
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:52.440]  him. Soon to be police officers in a city near you, pulling your daughter over. We'll
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:05:00.720]  be right back with Mike Rivera. Stay with us. Key information straight ahead.

[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:10.880]  is the wholesale destruction of the world. The push for every nation on the globe to

[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:07.760]  questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.880]  much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.800]  and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.720]  do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:27.120]  proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:31.320]  a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:36.240]  immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:41.680]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:46.160]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to

[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:32.560]  Jones. We know that WikiLeaks has scores of videos. WikiLeaks told MSNBC this morning of gun camera
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:38.320]  footage in some cases of hundreds being killed. They'll go to a wedding. They say there's
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:42.880]  one guy they want to get. They kill everybody. And more times than not, the person they even
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:49.400]  wanted to kill wasn't even there. And there is footage all over Afghanistan of reporters
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:54.360]  being killed. They are targeting reporters because they don't want them there. And now
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:59.320]  the Pentagon in the last year has been talking about targeting reporters here in the United
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:07.280]  States and going after websites. The issue here, the foundation of this is, PNAC, George
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:13.040]  Bush's handlers wanted to go into Iraq. They said we have to have a Pearl Harbor event
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:17.560]  to do it. They lied about WMDs premeditatedly. They knew they weren't there. That's come
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.320]  out in the Downing Street and White House memos. Over a million dead Iraqis in the last
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.840]  six plus years. That's a conservative number. Some are as high as a million and a half.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:30.760]  Almost none of those are actual military combatants. So it's a scorched earth policy. Same thing
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:36.920]  in Afghanistan. And it's so bad now. Muhammad Karzai is panicking. The unicol executive,
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:41.840]  the globalist puppet saying he may join the Taliban and kick the U.S. out because he knows
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.200]  his days are numbered. And joining us to talk about this is Mike Rivera. Mike, I want to
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:53.760]  go over all the facets and the psychological issues here and the neocons everywhere defending
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:59.080]  this today and still lying and saying the troops aren't killing puppies and things,
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:04.920]  even when that's admitted. But it's also the psychological abuse of the troops putting
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:12.060]  them in this type of culture, promoting this type of culture, Mike. And now the majority
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:16.560]  of new police recruits, as you know, in the last decade are being recruited out of the
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.920]  military. So these guys are going to be on our streets and are on our streets. Yeah,
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:25.080]  that's a very terrifying situation here. I mean, we've seen video of American soldiers
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.480]  throwing live grenades into flocks of sheep just to see what's going to happen. And this
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:35.560]  kind of incredible callous disregard is something that obviously is being indoctrinated into
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:40.600]  these kids when they get over there. And we saw the same thing in Vietnam where ordinary,
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:44.600]  well-behaved young men and women were drafted into the military. They were sent through
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:49.560]  boot camp, which turns you into a crazed killer in just, you know, six weeks of basic training.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:54.320]  Then they come back into the society and they have trouble reintegrating and going back to
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:11:00.560]  being well-behaved citizens. And this video that we saw yesterday, what is really most
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:05.160]  chilling about it is, as you were saying, to just hear the sounds of their voices and
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:10.120]  how excited they are to be doing this and this complete detachment from the recognition,
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:14.600]  those are real human beings down there. I know it looks like a giant Nintendo set when
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.560]  you're studying it through your thermal vision system, but those are real people down there.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:23.160]  And they haven't done anything that justifies being blown apart by cannon shells. And yet
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:27.760]  these pilots and gunners, they're just having the time of their life. That's a very scary
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:33.440]  psychology at work. And I've listened to the gun camera tapes from Korea, Vietnam, and
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:38.800]  other wars. They were very professional as they were dropping bombs, as they were killing
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:43.920]  people. You don't hear these type of celebrations. And then when the ground troops show up, they're
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.880]  not celebrating. They're freaked out when they see these two wounded girls and they
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:52.480]  radio back, hey, there were kids in that van. We got to get them to the hospital. And the
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:57.720]  helicopter pilot just giggles and says, you shouldn't bring them to a battle when they've
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:03.000]  just targeted basically an ambulance. They're there framing the people on the ground saying
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.040]  they've got weapons. Clearly, when they're helping to get the wounded in the car, they're
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.800]  saying, oh, there's a weapon and giggling. They know there's not a weapon. They're all
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:16.160]  there encouraging each other saying, come on, let me shoot, let me get them like it's
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:21.720]  a video game. And this is all part of the conditioning and the dehumanization that has
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:22.720]  taken place.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.720]  Well, the important thing to remember right now is when all the propaganda is said and
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.920]  done, these video tapes are how the United States is going to be judged and seen by history
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.760]  in the coming years. There's no amount of glorification and flag waving that is going
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:42.440]  to erase the memory of what is really going on in the ground there. And I'm afraid that
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:47.440]  the United States as a moral leader in the world is absolutely finished because of videotapes
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:52.720]  like this one. Nobody is going to see America as the good guy anymore. We are the 21st century
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:57.560]  version of the Nazi conquering hordes. And that's exactly how history is going to remember
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:58.560]  us.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.120]  This is in Nuremberg. It came out that on the eastern front and in Serbia, they would
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:07.760]  go in and just kill whole villages. And it was the same attitude. And hundreds and hundreds
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:13.080]  of Nazi officers were hung by the neck until dead for this. But now we're told, no, this
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.080]  is what the good guys do.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:20.880]  Yeah. Basically, that's it. And, you know, the war crimes trials are run by the victors
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.280]  is really what it comes down to. And we know that the US did some very atrocious things
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.820]  in World War Two as well. It's just because they were the winners. Nobody got prosecuted.
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:34.560]  But right now as we head into what looks to be an attempt to again sell us a war in Iran,
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.400]  I need to remind everybody that my concern about any more war is we're not in a position
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:43.440]  to win. And that, you know, we don't have the economy. We don't have the manufacturing
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.680]  capacity. And if we push these wars any further and we are defeated, all of our political leaders
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:52.960]  are going to be standing on those gallows as they should for the crimes that we see
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.800]  in these videotapes.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:00.080]  I want to play a video that I played the audio of last hour. And when I say I've seen countless
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:07.600]  videos, I mean, just live last hour, I remembered some of these and told them search troops,
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.120]  beat Iraqi children. And one of these kids looks like he's about six years old. He's
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.600]  in a pool of blood. They drag them off the street for supposedly throwing rocks. They
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.600]  bring them in. The British troops are beating them. There's pools of blood. They're stomping
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:25.800]  their groin. They're beating them in the head with batons. And there are US troops like
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:33.160]  Satan and Beelzebub sitting up on top of parapet at a base, looking down 50 yards away, making
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:40.280]  the most demonic sounds of sadistic enjoyment that I've ever heard. And I noticed this same
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:45.600]  giggling and chortling on tape after tape after tape when our troops and contractors
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:51.000]  are sitting off the road, just randomly shooting up a highway, people falling out dead. We have
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.080]  all these videos up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. The same demonic sounds when they throw
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:03.880]  a hand grenade in between sheep and a sheep herder, literally just killing people and
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.840]  enjoying it. I want to play this video and audio so people can hear the sound of, for
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:14.640]  lack of a better term, what a demon possessed ringwraith sounds like in a blood orgy. Here
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:27.160]  it is. We're dragging the kids in. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. You're going to get it. Yes. No,
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:48.640]  two little boys. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Please don't hurt me.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:16:16.640]  That's enough. It goes on and on. Now, every time they stop them in the groin, every time
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:22.880]  they beg, his demonic whale song, you know, whales have a beautiful song, but our troops,
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:28.960]  you just heard the song. The demon song is, I guess, what I would coin the term for. This
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:35.080]  is demon song. This is demonic praise. Christian, you know, music will be beautiful, choral,
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:42.360]  hark the herald angels sing glory to the newborn king uplifting. But this is demon song. What
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:47.160]  do you think of that, Mike Rivera? Well, you know, I listen to this stuff and I'm flashing
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:51.320]  back to the revelation that the US government has actually been drugging our troops, giving
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.960]  them speed and all kinds of things so they can get more work out of them in the combat
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:00.160]  zones. And I'm beginning to wonder if there are some other chemicals at use here that
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:07.080]  are just turning these kids into such inhuman insensitive monsters because it is scary to
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:11.440]  hear this and realize these are human beings. I don't even want to admit that I'm the same
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.880]  species as these people when I hear these sounds.
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.840]  Well, it's funny you'd say that five years ago, six years ago, in fact, pull this up.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:24.560]  It was a wire magazine story called The Marshall Plan. It's not what weapons our troops will
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.160]  have in the future, but what drugs they will be on. And they admit that they're giving
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:35.640]  aggression drugs secretly to the troops. Then they give them an amnesiac similar to Halcyon
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:40.280]  to not remember it. And they've done drills where they order them and remember Gruckheimer
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.160]  was in the Ithaca Times years ago saying, oh, yes, we go in and kill everyone in the
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.160]  village, men, women and children. We line the kids up and shoot them in the back of
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:51.480]  the head. And then the Pentagon came out and said, well, only certain villages. And so
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:57.840]  they give them drugs to do it. Then they give them amnesics. Our troops are under mind control.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.360]  It's a very scary situation. They're being turned into robots. We're seeing it in the
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:08.160]  videotape. They're conditioned to see anything as a threat and to open fire on it. And it's
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:12.720]  scary. I mean, it's almost like the scenes from Terminator where people are down on the
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.680]  ground and these robotic machines are in the sky, killing everything that moves. And it
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.640]  doesn't matter that there's a real flesh and blood pilot. If they're juiced up on
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.680]  all these chemicals, they're still robots. They're organic robots, but they're still
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.680]  robots and they're killing everything that moves. I can't imagine that Reuters News
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:33.720]  Service is going to treat this issue very, very gently. It did take CNN a day to finally
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:37.600]  come forward and cover this WikiLeaks story. But I think the media has to be looking at
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:42.800]  all the dead reporters that we're seeing in the war zones and realizing that maybe cutting
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.160]  the government slack on these wars isn't such a good idea because they could be next.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:53.720]  Exactly. Here's another video to search of hundreds. It was another Reuters reporter.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:57.720]  Tank kills Reuters reporter. And he's out front in the street with his camera. He's
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:02.360]  videotaping with a full crew. They just drive right up in machine gunning from the top of
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:07.720]  the tank. I mean, there's been so many of these, but they're hardly ever on U.S. TV.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:13.760]  But as you said earlier, the entire world is seeing this every day and knows that the
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:17.960]  United States is the Legion of Doom. And for people that say, oh, kill all them Hodges,
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:22.440]  they're not human. The bankers see you as not being human as well. That's why they're
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:27.640]  announcing they're preparing to take all of your pension funds and bank accounts for
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:32.640]  the banks in the next banking takeover in the next crisis they stage. So remember all
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:38.840]  of you out there that have turned into demons supporting this by extension. Remember the
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:45.800]  same elite sees you the way they see the Hodges as they call them, the rag heads that with
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:52.120]  those type of racist statements. And obviously, ladies and gentlemen, things are only going
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:56.160]  to get worse from here. And everybody's kind of forgotten about the wars because Obama's
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:00.200]  in and he's continuing the torture, everything else. Mike Rivera straight ahead. We'll be
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.200]  right back.

[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:09.200]  promised by President Obama but the reality that we must face in these changing economic
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:14.360]  times with our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion and our unfunded liabilities
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:19.400]  totaling over $107 trillion. The value of the US dollar continues its slide into oblivion.

[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:11.400]  is the wholesale destruction of the world. The push for every nation on the globe to

[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:21.960]  And when we came across soldiers, they didn't seem sure of their role. We filmed these GIs
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:27.720]  after they caught a group of Iraqis stealing wood. We try to stop them from looting. They
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.720]  don't understand, so we'll take their car and we'll crush it. The United States Army
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:55.320]  tankers' hole.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:17.840]  That's what you get when you loop. Later, the car's owner told us, I'm a taxi
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:26.640]  grabber. The car is my livelihood.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.560]  They find a guy with some wood. He's gotten out of a field. I've watched the whole front
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:35.560]  line piece. This is what they're cooking their food with, and they say, no. This is how we
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:40.400]  win your hearts and minds. You were caught getting some wood. We're now going to shoot
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:46.440]  your car up and laugh, then run over it back and forth with a $2 million tank that could
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:53.800]  damage the tank, and then laugh at you. They laugh. It's an enjoyment. They kill dogs. It's
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.640]  an enjoyment.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:05.080]  Yeah, it is not an image that we, the American taxpayers, want to see out in the world, because
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:11.960]  we pay for it all. And ultimately, in theory, we're responsible. These troops are the public
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:16.160]  face of America, and we're all being told that we're bringing democracy to these people,
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.320]  that we're there, that they're supposed to be welcoming us with flowers, and then we
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:24.480]  get this slap in the face that our troops are behaving just like the Nazis in occupied
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:29.440]  territory. And years from now, I'm sure they'll be making movies about the American troops,
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:34.360]  and they'll be portrayed on the screen the way we now portray the Nazis as these inhuman
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:38.920]  monsters that take incredible delight in what they're doing. And by the way, as a little
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:44.600]  historical footnote, the Nazis were real big on drugging their troops as well. They were
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:51.120]  using more natural chemicals like St. John's wort and Valerian root. They were giving their
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.120]  troops this stuff.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:55.640]  Oh, they were giving them, they were also giving them anabolic steroids.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:00.360]  And meth, methadrine was invented by the Nazis, I understand, as a battlefield drug
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:05.600]  to make them stronger, more fearless, to see better in the dark, and to basically feel
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:10.800]  no inhibitions whatsoever about going out and doing what they were doing to the targeted
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:16.000]  populations. So we're following along in a very ignoble tradition, if you will.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.920]  And with regard to this targeting of reporters, I was thinking during the break, back during
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:26.880]  the initial invasion of Iraq in 2003, where the journalists were all put in this one hotel
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:33.880]  in Baghdad. And I remember this, this video, where this tank across the block, this traffic
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:38.920]  circle, literally turned and shelled the hotel where the press was located. And there were
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:44.280]  signs identifying that this was the media center and everything. And, you know, afterwards,
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:48.400]  you know, the military was making jokes about it. Well, I had my finger on the trigger and
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:53.880]  they had a big sign saying press. So, and, you know, aha, and a very, very funny. But
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:58.800]  yeah, even back then, the military were killing the reporters. They didn't want them around
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:27:59.800]  as well.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:03.360]  There was a London Guardian article where the reporter was with the Marines, and they
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:07.840]  got a 50 caliber rifle in Basra, and this woman's walking with children in her hands
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:12.680]  leading them. And they said, look at that bleeper called her a name and they placed bets.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:16.240]  It was a thousand yards away on whether they could blow her head off. Then they blow her
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:20.400]  head off and they have a big celebration. And then back at base, the reporter confronts
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:24.960]  them and a bunch of Marines chant, we love killing kids. And it turns out the Marines
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:30.360]  now have a chant about go out in the school ground, let the little bastards gather around,
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:34.880]  mow them down, you know, throw the candy on the ground, watch the little bleepers gather
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:39.200]  around, then mow them down. I mean, this is demonic. I mean, they might as well start
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.240]  wearing devil horns or something.
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:46.640]  Yeah, absolutely. And it, again, this is not the image of the war that we're being fed
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:50.640]  here at home where, you know, our troops are really good guys and they're being welcomed
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:54.880]  and everybody loves them. And we only ever target the bad guys. And yet we're seeing
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:00.320]  from all of these various theaters, whether it's Pakistan or wherever, that we're, that
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:07.280]  the US government is killing 40, 50 non-combatant civilians for every one suspected terrorist.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:11.840]  And again, we don't really know if there was anybody there that needed, you know, that
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.880]  justified that kind of an attack. Plus we're invading them. They weren't involved in 9-11.
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:21.080]  No one even says that now. But what about all the cases where they go into a family,
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:24.040]  rape them and then kill everybody to cover it up?
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:28.000]  And then dig the bullets out, which we're getting another report about that in Afghanistan.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.800]  In fact, I forgot to get that and send it to you. A New York Times Pentagon admits cover
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:40.040]  up in, in Village Massacre. So, so that's there. And then Pat Tillman, Pat Tillman was
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:44.360]  going to come home and expose the whole war as a fraud. So they fragged him. They murdered
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:51.400]  him. Mike, stay there. We're going to come back and play this raw video.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:58.880]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:04.560]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:09.400]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:13.240]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:16.720]  all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:21.240]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:27.480]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:32.040]  of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:36.160]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:43.600]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:54.800]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:31:02.080]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:06.120]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:10.800]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:15.880]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:20.920]  is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:27.400]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:32.880]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:38.720]  sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:44.040]  the Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making

[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:30.760]  Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:58.200]  Thank you.
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:24.680]  One small central authority of individuals can then dictate a policy that's going to
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:52.680]  be distributed down to the rest of the world, everywhere.
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:58.280]  Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering,
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.480]  staged terror attacks, media propaganda and debt.
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:06.160]  Americans are easily motivated by false flag operations and I think it's inevitable that
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:09.440]  we will see false flag operations in the near future.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.960]  Witness their plan for a global tax and the cashless surveillance society in which every
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:23.400]  man, woman and child is microchipped at birth.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:41.800]  If you look at the elite throughout history, many of the people that achieve pinnacles of
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:35:07.800]  power are into the occult.
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:24.480]  This evil will not be done in my name or my family's name.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:32.160]  Invisible Empire, the new film, it starts shipping in just what, eight days?
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.160]  Nine days?

[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:43.080]  of the new world order, how they operate, their mindset, who they are, how to stop them,
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:47.840]  18 months of the making, our new film, Invisible Empire, a new order defined and then coming

[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:05.240]  orders, the torture, the riot police at the G20, both films available now at infowars.com.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:12.320]  They will also premiere at prisonplanet.tv on the 15th and 21st for prisonplanet.tv
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:17.520]  members that are also watching us live right now on added level to the syndicated radio
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:18.520]  broadcast.

[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:38.840]  to me, Alex Jones, P.O. Box, 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760, the people are now ready to
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:43.960]  be awakened, the people are now ready to see the truth, get the films, get them out to
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:48.840]  everybody, key tools in the info war and see your purchase as a donation to make what we
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:52.880]  do here possible if you believe in what we're doing, we need your financial support.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.560]  Going back to Mike Rivera of whatreallyhappened.com, Mike, I keep going back to this but I want
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:03.560]  you to speak to it in detail and then we're going to play longer clips with the cuss words
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:11.600]  cut out of the murdered operation with this gun camera footage from these apaches for
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.920]  the radio listeners and viewers.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.560]  But Mike, specifically, people think they're in a bubble here in the U.S. and that we can
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.200]  lie about people and invade them and kill them and do all these things and that we won't
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:28.680]  be abused here, but the very same police state grid is being put in place here, Mike Rivera.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:32.800]  Yeah, absolutely, we've seen the LRADS are going out there, they're talking about the
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:39.120]  microwave pain guns, they're using tasers incredibly recklessly, the same tools of public
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:44.280]  oppression that we're seeing at use on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan are going to
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:48.040]  be directed against the American people by the U.S. government in order to perpetuate
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:53.760]  its own power and privilege and wealth. We're descending into a fascist economy. There is
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:57.800]  absolutely no question about that at this point and the U.S. government is not going
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:03.280]  to surrender its power willingly. We're looking at all these 10th resolution movements in
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:09.760]  the states. The governor of Utah just signed a bill using eminent domain to try and recover
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:12.680]  some of the lands the federal government has stolen, that's going to wind up in a court
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:13.680]  fight.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:17.560]  At some point we're going to see federal troops marching into a state in order to enforce
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:21.360]  federal law over the state's wishes and at that point we're going to see some shooting
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:26.880]  start. But the bottom line is no tyrannical government ever gave up power willingly just
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:31.640]  because it was the will of the people. The whole purpose of my website and radio show
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:35.760]  for the last 16 years has been to try and find a way to get the government, point it
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:40.160]  back to a republic without bloodshed. I'm beginning to be convinced that the U.S. government
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:44.200]  is never going to allow that to happen. It's either going to collapse or there's going
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:48.840]  to be some kind of a civil war. Of the two, obviously, I favor collapse without bloodshed
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:54.000]  like the Soviet Union did. If there is a war in this country, I hope it'll be as short
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.280]  as the Romanian Revolution. That was over in just two weeks.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:06.800]  Well, let's go back here. Every case the government's caught lying, with Pat Tillman, with just
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:12.240]  every single issue. Here's the New York Times today. U.S. admits role in February killing
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:17.080]  of Afghan women. And today they've come out and admitted that there has been a complete
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:25.800]  coverup. Here's Salon, U.S. forces horrifying Afghanistan coverup. Our troops killed five
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:32.440]  noninsurgents at a birthday party. Could could they at least give us an explanation? I mean,
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:37.840]  it is standard procedure for the police, the military, the government to do this. And under
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:44.600]  Northcom under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, they're stating and now at football games,
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:51.200]  horse races, mass shootings in Alabama, DUI checkpoints in California, they have regular
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:56.320]  army, regular Marines in Tennessee last year. This is in police state for the rise of FEMA.
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:01.360]  We have the state rep on the governor said you can't have these military checkpoints
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.200]  and they just went ahead and did it. So they're clearly trying to condition a military, the
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:11.640]  public, everybody for a mass takeover. Why are they preparing for a physical takeover?
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:16.680]  It's because they know the banks are looting us by design. We're going into a real depression.
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:21.320]  This is a planned takeover by the Pentagon that's taken over hundreds of other nations.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:26.080]  Mike Rivera, can you speak to that? Yeah, absolutely. We know that the ultimate
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:29.800]  plan is this global government. They've been trying to convince us that it's necessary
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:34.000]  because of human cause global warming. And already as one of the harshest winters in
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.600]  recent memory melts into spring, already the propaganda is cranking up to say, oh, we've
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.640]  got a global environmental crisis. We've got to have a global government to solve it.
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:47.880]  They're going to come back and try the swine flu again this year. Got to have a global
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:53.040]  health authority because of the global pandemic crisis, global financial meltdown. We've got
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:57.760]  to have a global bank. They're really pushing this whole global situation. They understand
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:02.960]  that the American people are about ready to fire the US federal government. They're actually
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.160]  eager for that to happen so they can tear down the existing federal government and say,
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:11.920]  okay, now we've got a new global government ready for you to sign on to. Won't it be wonderful
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:16.680]  and better than what you had before? And of course, no, every time you hear global government,
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:20.840]  that's what Hitler wanted. That's what Napoleon wanted. That's what Alexander the Great wanted.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:25.600]  It's always great for the rulers and terrible for the people. I think I echo the sentiments
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.480]  of a lot of Americans when we say at this point, we just want to be left alone. We don't
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.840]  want big government at any level. Just let us have our little town councils in our local
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:39.240]  community and take care of ourselves and the rest of you go away. Find someplace else
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.440]  to play your little games.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.320]  But they're not going to stop. They've studied psychological warfare. They shipped the narcotics
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:49.440]  and in fact, you guys printed it like five times and never even covered it in the last
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:56.360]  two weeks. It's a Reuters headline. NATO says no to Russian plan to eradicate pompies. The
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.000]  Russians came out and said, look, we know you're shipping 500 billion a year of this
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.800]  out. Spray the pompies. And NATO in the U.S. said, no, we don't want to upset the Afghans.
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:10.200]  We're going to let them grow their pompies. We know the real Taliban, not the CIA Taliban,
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:15.640]  had eradicated almost all of them. It's up over 12 times in the last eight years in production.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:20.240]  And here's Reuters admitting our government is protecting the pompies. And then they ship
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:26.160]  it in to legalize slavery when idiots use it. They then put the idiots in their private
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:28.960]  prisons. I mean, this is slavery.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:32.760]  It absolutely isn't. It's a huge moneymaker. I mean, the skull and bones fraternity at
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:38.240]  Yale University was founded with opium money. Vietnam, we had Air America flying Kuhn Sanz
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:43.360]  opium back to the United States inside the body bags of our Vietnam dead. We lost Vietnam.
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:47.360]  The CIA goes into South America. We all of a sudden, we have a cocaine epidemic that
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:54.040]  involves the elder Bush and Bill Clinton. Now we're back into Afghanistan and it's bumper
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:58.840]  crop of opium. And this this idea that we have to leave those poor poppy farmers alone
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:02.000]  because they won't have anything to do. Well, what were they doing for a living when the
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:08.600]  Taliban ran the place and shut the opium poppies down? They had a job at that point. Clearly,
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:12.280]  the US has grabbed Afghanistan to turn it into the new opium growing capital of the
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.560]  world and that opium is flooding into Russia and it's flooding into the United States of
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:22.760]  America. We are seeing a new surge of heroin flowing into the streets of America. It is
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:28.520]  very pure. It is very potent. We are seeing overdose deaths beginning to happen all over
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:33.880]  again just like during Vietnam. We were mired in Vietnam and the heroin flowed in the streets
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:38.520]  of America. Huge amounts of money being made by the American drug lords. Hollywood kept
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:42.840]  telling you, oh, no, the drug problem. It's all South American people. It's all Asians.
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:46.800]  It's all the blacks. You know, it's not our it's not our own political leaders. Then
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:53.040]  we find out after Eugene Hasenfuss's plane crashes. Yeah, the biggest drug smuggler in
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:59.400]  the country is the country. Now, I want to in two parts, a seven minute video will play
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.600]  part of it now and get Mike Rivera's take on it. Maybe keep Mike a little bit in the
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:06.560]  next hour. We can do it and play the rest of the video than Jesse Ventura is coming
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:12.640]  up. But I wrote some notes last night on points I want to make about this gun pod footage
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.040]  and how they're going after WikiLeaks. Now, again, the media's response saying this is
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:23.440]  no big deal. This is OK. But then Tony Schaefer, the colonel who tried to stop 9 11, he went
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:28.720]  on MSNBC this morning and said, wait a minute. And he read the rules of engagement and said,
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:32.960]  they're pulling up. There's no weapons. There's wounded. This is a violation of the military
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:37.640]  law. U. S. Long Geneva Convention law to open fire on these people getting wounded into
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:43.200]  a vehicle. We know this is illegal. And the military was to charge these officers that
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:48.440]  had done this. Then it would send a message not to do this. But instead, they run PR events
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:54.800]  where they charge a Navy SEAL guy for punching a detainee in the nose to make it look like
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:00.680]  they're keeping the troops from doing their job. Again, those are all psyops. So you can
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:05.400]  rape and kill women. You can kill children. That's OK. But don't punch somebody in the
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:10.240]  nose. This is all psyops to make it look like they're tying the hands of the troops when
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:13.320]  really they're forging them into demons. Now, here's a seven minute video. We're going to
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:17.360]  upload to YouTube. It's a it's a clean version with all the cuss words and things cut out
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:22.800]  of it, we hope. But here it is for the first time here of the event from 2007 that was
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:27.520]  leaked yesterday by WikiLeaks. Here it is walking by one of the men's weapons.
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:36.320]  Roger, restate target. Roger, restate target. 2-0-8. See all those people standing down there?
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:47.320]  Roger. Stay firm. And open the courtyard. Roger, I can estimate that there's a 20 of them.
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:52.520]  There's one. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I got a 6-1, correct. Bandage on 4-2-3-6.
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:59.160]  Hey, woodsman, it's Alvin. I'll tell you if I take the weapon. Yeah. Hotel 2-6, crazy
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:05.660]  horse 1-8. I'm going to try my bravo. That's the weapon.
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:13.560]  Bandage on 4-4, radio. Bandage on 4-4, bravo. Yeah, he's got a weapon, too. Hotel 2-6,
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:21.060]  crazy horse 1-8, have five to six individuals with a K47. Request for mission in a cage.
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:27.380]  Roger that we have no personnel east of our position. So, uh, you know, three to engage over
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:31.220]  All right, we'll be engaged
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:34.580]  I can't get up now because we're behind that building
[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:58.580]  All right, we got guy with an RPG
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:08.580]  Come on
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:30.580]  All right, we just engaged all eight individuals
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:46.580]  All right, we got about eight individuals
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:48:14.580]  Hey, you shoot out top
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:28.580]  Okay, we're going to come back and play the part where they kill the kids or wound the kids. The reports aren't clear. They left very seriously wounded, but they wouldn't let them into a U.S. hospital. So that's not known.
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:40.580]  But the issue here is at first you see a tripod. You see cameras. I can tell their cameras. This is blurry internet video compared to what they were saying, but maybe the troops are wrong. You're thinking, you know, maybe they're wrong.
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:52.580]  Then when it's clear their cameras, when it's clear, no one's got a gun. When they're on the ground crawling, they start saying, oh, yes, that van's pulling up. They're getting weapons and wounded. When they're not, they're getting one guy off the street.
[01:48:52.580 --> 01:49:02.580]  You then see how they're framing them and it's reminiscent of all the cop videos where their own squad car bust them because they forget to erase it and they go, I'm going to frame him right now. I'm going to give the signal.
[01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:10.580]  They walk over to the guy and handcuffs behind the car and go, oh, what's this and take it out of their back pocket. Mike Rivera.
[01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:25.580]  Well, you know, when I first saw this video, the when WikiLeaks first put it out there right at the moment where the guy says, oh, yeah, there's a guy with an RPG. There's a guy with an RPG. And I was looking at the video and the first thought that went through my head is, no, that's a camera.
[01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:35.580]  And with a telephoto lens, I mean, the front of it was way too wide to be an RPG. And the guy from his body language was just looking around the corner to see if it was safe to maybe take a picture.
[01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:46.580]  And yet the guy saying, oh, this is an RPG. And they just opened fire on the guy. And at that moment, it, you know, it really wasn't clear. These guys are not checking their targets.
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:57.580]  They very much got that Pope innocent, the three mentality, kill everybody, let God sort them out and cover it up afterwards. And again, it's, they're just going out there and shooting all these people.
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:08.580]  And their only concern is, ooh, we don't want to look bad to the chain of command. And it's, it's, it's not the image of the American fighting man that we, the people who pay the bills want to see.
[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:20.580]  Well, even on the blurred footage, it's third or fourth generation that we're seeing. You can see the little kid's faces looking out the car. And they know, and then they laugh about it later.
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:25.580]  That's got to be the most painful part about this, because this is destroying the name of our country, Mike.
[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:33.580]  Absolutely. It is. It's dragging the image of the United States through the dirt, not that it needed much help in from the last 10 years.
[01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:47.580]  But yeah, there's, we've got to get these videos out there, because it's, it's going to become impossible for the U.S. government to sell a new war in Iran, when, when Americans see the conduct of our troops in the existing conflicts.
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:58.580]  And I know the corporate media is out there trying to excuse this all the way and say, well, bad things happen in war. Yeah. And our side is doing them. We're the invaders. We're the conquerors.
[01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:07.580]  Stay there. Okay. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:12.580]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:18.580]  It's true. Seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:23.580]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:30.580]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:38.580]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:48.580]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:57.580]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.580 --> 01:52:19.580]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:35.580]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:41.580]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:45.580]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:18.580]  If the system can set the precedent to allow this type of merciless killing, they will carry these type of operations out in the United States.
[01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:22.580]  And they are deploying drones now. Police departments are getting weaponized drones.
[01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:30.580]  I want to talk to Mike Rivera and then coming up in the next hour, we're going to play the second half of this video here in Ontario about Obama.
[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:40.580]  That's why the corporates picked him. That's why they brought Obama in was because the unpopular war issue would then basically go off the table and he's increased drone attacks.
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:48.580]  He's increased many of these wars. And that's why we're exposing him as Barry Sataro by exposing the fact that his real name is Barry Sataro,
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:53.580]  that he's an Indonesian citizen, that he waived his US citizenship and is ineligible because of that.
[01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:59.580]  More than even the questionable birth certificate, we can also discredit and bring this system to justice.
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:08.580]  That's why we got this new t-shirt for sale. It says Barry Sataro, big picture of Barack Obama, a.k.a. Barry Sataro, infowars.com on the back.
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:18.580]  You want to educate people about Barry Sataro, get this t-shirt infowars.com and your purchase also supports the radio show.
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:25.580]  You can also order the two new films that are coming out this month, infowars.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:31.580]  Mike, that question about Barack Obama, where is the left? Where is Dennis Kasinich?
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:35.580]  Where are all these people that were supposedly against these illegal wars?
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:42.580]  Well, they're basically showing their party loyalty and basically revealing that both political parties really are personality cults.
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:47.580]  Whoever at the top, we worship and agree with them and we attack the guy on the other side.
[01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:52.580]  In a lot of ways, the political parties are functioning as religions.
[01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:57.580]  They've got the personality of the figure at the top who is always right, is presumed infallible,
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:56:03.580]  and always making fun of the leader of the other cult on the other side of the aisle here.
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:08.580]  The reality is that we, the American people who are expected to provide money and our children for all of this stuff,
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:13.580]  we need to basically look at the fact that these politicians, like religions,
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:17.580]  they're making promises they can't really keep and have no intentions of keeping.
[01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:20.580]  And that really for me is the issue here.
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:25.580]  We've got a government that feels they have the divine right to lie to us at any and all times,
[01:56:25.580 --> 01:56:30.580]  whatever lie they can come up with that'll keep us contented and complacent,
[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:34.580]  or at least silent and obedient, that's what they're going to feed to us
[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:36.580]  and they think there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:41.580]  And they don't understand why after all the lies that we have seen from the last several administrations,
[01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:43.580]  the American people are getting fed up. We're tired of lies.
[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:46.580]  We don't want to live in a world of lies.
[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:48.580]  I know that politicians like to go around saying,
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:51.580]  Mundus volt, the sepi, the people want to be lied to.
[01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:53.580]  That's not true. I don't want to be lied to.
[01:56:53.580 --> 01:56:58.580]  I demand the truth from the government that is demanding my money and obedience
[01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:02.580]  and my family members to die in wars. And we're not getting it.
[01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:06.580]  And on that issue alone, I think it's time for the American people to stand up and say,
[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:08.580]  No, more. Enough is enough.
[01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:12.580]  We were promised that this administration was going to end the wars.
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:17.580]  They haven't done it. It's time to say, OK, this administration is a failure.
[01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:22.580]  This government is a failure. They are not responsive to the people.
[01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:24.580]  I want to get this in now.
[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:28.580]  Here's Reuters. NATO rejects Russian call for Afghan poppy spring.
[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:32.580]  Here it is on record. They let the poppies grow its policy.
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:37.580]  NATO Wednesday rejected Russian calls for it to eradicate opium poppy fields in Afghanistan,
[01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:41.580]  saying the best way for Moscow to help control the drug would be,
[01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:44.580]  give more assistance against the insurgency.
[01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:49.580]  Russia's anti-drug czar Victor Anavov met NATO ambassadors in Brussels
[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:55.580]  and proposed that NATO troops be given a UN mandate and an obligation to eradicate Afghan poppy fields,
[01:57:55.580 --> 01:57:58.580]  which were killing 30,000 Russians a year.
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:02.580]  But NATO said, no, that they're going to let it grow because if they do,
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:07.580]  it'll make the insurgency mad when our government is in control of almost the whole country
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:10.580]  and is out there protecting the poppy fields.
[01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:13.580]  I even saw, heard a BBC piece where they admitted this.
[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:17.580]  I mean, they're now out in the open protecting the poppy fields,
[01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:21.580]  but then I'll drive through a military checkpoint asking if I've got their stinking drugs.
[01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:24.580]  Again, they bring the drugs in as a way to get in your life,
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:26.580]  as a way to get the military involved in your life,
[01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:28.580]  as a way to federalize law enforcement,
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:35.580]  and as a way to put nonviolent drug users in their private prisons competing with the rest of the outside industry.
[01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:50.580]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds with the third hour with Mike Rivera.
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:57.580]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:58:57.580 --> 01:59:02.580]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:11.580]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:11.580 --> 01:59:19.580]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:59:19.580 --> 01:59:24.580]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:29.580]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:36.580]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:40.580]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection,
[01:59:40.580 --> 01:59:42.580]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:45.580]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:59:45.580 --> 02:00:00.580]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:35.580]  I am now going to specifically open the phones up for callers that want to talk about all of the snuff film footage
[02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:46.580]  of children, innocent men, women, animals, property being destroyed and murdered by our troops
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:49.580]  and the fact that they're protected in these actions.
[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:53.580]  And the Pentagon cynically goes after some Navy SEALs for punching somebody in the nose
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:55.580]  while condoning torture.
[02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:58.580]  That's not as a Psyop to make it look like the troops are being persecuted.
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:00.580]  When in truth, they're being told to do all this.
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:02.580]  We're going to play some more video with Mike Rivera.
[02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:07.580]  And we're also going to break down the full spectrum of what's happening here.
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:11.580]  I've got a few other key points I want to make about this when we come back.
[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:16.580]  But Mike, other points that we haven't made about this whole situation?
[02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:24.580]  Well, the bottom line is that the American people are being fed a major deception operation
[02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:30.580]  to convince us that this war is really very good and it all goes back to Sun Tzu and the art of war.
[02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:37.580]  All wars based on deception because in order to win, a nation has to feel they have the moral law on their side
[02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:39.580]  and clearly we do not.
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:42.580]  We all know that these wars were started with lies and deception.
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:46.580]  So the government's trying to convince the American people who are paying the taxes
[02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:51.580]  and providing the children for these wars that there is some noble good purpose to it all.
[02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:53.580]  And there just isn't.
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:58.580]  These videos are really going to hammer home the fact that we're the bad guys this time around
[02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:01.580]  and I don't think that's going to sit well with the American people.
[02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:06.580]  Of course, the same government that's putting drugs into our soldiers to make them kill crazy over there
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:11.580]  is probably at some point going to be thinking about, hmm, maybe we ought to put something in the water to calm everybody down.
[02:02:11.580 --> 02:02:14.580]  I noticed this recent talk about legalizing marijuana.
[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:19.580]  The government may be so afraid of the American people that they're going to say, all right, let them getting a little bit high.
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:25.580]  That might just keep them from storming Capitol Hill with flaming torches and pitchforks and tar and feathers.
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:28.580]  But, you know, it's a very scary time right now.
[02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:35.580]  The American people have to face up to the reality of what these wars are, because this is how history is going to judge us.
[02:02:35.580 --> 02:02:39.580]  This is why it's so difficult to do business with other countries. Nobody likes us anymore.
[02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:41.580]  Nobody trusts us anymore.
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:48.580]  Well, I've seen a university study that in the worldwide, the U.S. is listed as the sixth worst police state,
[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:54.580]  only behind countries like North Korea, Cuba and Mexico and a few others.
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:58.580]  I mean, by every yardstick, we are a police state.
[02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:00.580]  We are a fascist dictatorship.
[02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:03.580]  The economy proves it and it's only going to get worse.
[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:08.580]  I mean, history has shown once a nation goes fascistic, they never pull back.
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:13.580]  They have to keep on going till it either collapses or there's a revolt.
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:15.580]  Well, you're right about that.
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:21.580]  And I talk about this every day because it's now been in world that daily AP Reuters, Bloomberg, Business Week.
[02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:24.580]  But Business Week and others are saying it like it's good.
[02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:34.580]  Federal regulators are now ordering private pension funds, as if they have that power, to invest their money, quote, in failed banks, so it can be taken.
[02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:37.580]  I mean, obviously they're getting ready for martial law.
[02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:39.580]  They're talking about taking everybody's pension fund.
[02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:44.580]  I mean, this is so lawless, so illegal, so criminal, so obviously wrong.
[02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:47.580]  And what do they think the public's going to do?
[02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:54.580]  I mean, if 99% don't get violent, the 1% that does is going to be millions of people going, going ape.
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:04:02.580]  Well, you know, after Joe Stack crashed his airplane into the Internal Revenue Service, I think a lot of people realize the American people have been pushed to the limit.
[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:10.580]  The U.S. government, because of its enslavement by the Federal Reserve System, has no choice but to go on looting the American people to give it to the private bankers.
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:14.580]  At some point, the American people are going to fight back.
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:19.580]  There's going to be one foreclosure too many. There's going to be one failed business too many.
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:22.580]  There's going to be one mass layoff too many. One more.
[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:26.580]  There's going to be a breaking point. There has to be. And that's what the government's getting ready for.
[02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:38.580]  I think we're probably going to see the government is going to try and actually force a response in the American people, just like we see Israel doing to Palestine, in order to justify that military crackdown on the time table of the government's choosing.
[02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:50.580]  Mike, you've been saying that for a long time, and now it's all coming together, as anarchist groups funded by the big banks are saying they're going to go out and provocateur actions with the Tea Parties this month.
[02:04:50.580 --> 02:04:58.580]  I see stage government terror to be blamed on the Tea Parties. The government wants to have this physical confrontation sooner rather than later.
[02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:01.580]  We'll talk about that on the other side of your phone call. Stay with us.
[02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:09.580]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:18.580]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:26.580]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:35.580]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:44.580]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:59.580]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again that number 1-800-409-5633.

[02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:12.580]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:07:12.580 --> 02:07:19.580]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control.
[02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:25.580]  The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:33.580]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:07:33.580 --> 02:07:38.580]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:07:38.580 --> 02:07:41.580]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:47.580]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:24.580]  In Iraq, killing reporters, shooting children, lying about them saying they had weapons.
[02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:29.580]  The Pentagon today in the New York Times admitted they lied about a massacre of pregnant women.
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:32.580]  They dug the bullets out of them trying to cover it up. They killed Pat Tillman.
[02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:38.580]  Murdered him in cold blood because he was going to come home and turn against the war and letters he wrote home to his family.
[02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:43.580]  And I've talked to his family. They understand it was a hit and the evidence is that it was.
[02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:49.580]  The point is the elites see humans as negatives, that there's too many of us that were worthless.
[02:08:49.580 --> 02:08:54.580]  They have no love of human life. They see us as human resources to be used and abused.
[02:08:54.580 --> 02:09:02.580]  A lot of conservatives like the Patriot Act, like torture, like war, but you don't like unconstitutional government take over healthcare and you shouldn't.
[02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:06.580]  You notice Obama's continuing the wars and torture. You should love him.
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:13.580]  You can't like one unconstitutional thing because you buy propaganda and then not like another.
[02:09:13.580 --> 02:09:17.580]  And our country is bankrupt. These wars cost over a trillion bucks a year.
[02:09:17.580 --> 02:09:25.580]  What the Pentagon budget is 1.1 trillion off budget, 600 billion not counting black budget, close to 600 billion on top of that.
[02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:31.580]  That's over 2 trillion. Corporate interests are taking over our society.
[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:35.580]  They're militarizing our police. They're turning us into a prison economy.
[02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:39.580]  And to see Michelle Malkin and others defend this footage.
[02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:46.580]  Well, we can play your Marines killing puppies and the Marine Corps admits that was real killing that puppy. People claim it wasn't real.
[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:51.580]  We can show you the footage of them beating up little kids and making demonic pleasure noises while they do it.
[02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:58.580]  We have played that or running over family's cars for no reason and laughing about it or killing other animals and other humans and sitting off the sides of roads,
[02:09:58.580 --> 02:10:02.580]  machine gunning people as they drive down the highway for fun and laughing about it.
[02:10:02.580 --> 02:10:08.580]  These guys are coming back to be cops and they're coming back to run our lives and they're deranged.
[02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:16.580]  And if they're not deranged, they get listed by Homeland Security as trouble and in the Mayak at Homeland Security reports and they can't own guns.
[02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:23.580]  So to the military and everybody serving this system, your scene is worthless by the elites as well.
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:29.580]  I want to finish up this video that we put together cutting out the cuss words of where they've shot a bunch of reporters.
[02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:33.580]  Now a minivan pulls up to put a guy in it. There's clearly no weapons.
[02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:37.580]  It's got kids in the van hanging out the window. They open fire.
[02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:41.580]  They make a joke later about, well, you shouldn't bring kids to a battle zone.
[02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:47.580]  Mike Rivera basically at this tremendous callousness that we're seeing here.
[02:10:47.580 --> 02:10:54.580]  And again, it goes back to this issue that the American people don't vision the war being being like this.
[02:10:54.580 --> 02:11:04.580]  We're constantly being propagandized that our soldiers are only killing the bad people and that everybody else in the war zones loves us and is just happy that we're there.
[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:06.580]  And it's absolutely not true.
[02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:14.580]  The U.S. government has for decades been playing predatory games in other countries, either overt invasion or covert subversion.
[02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:18.580]  Last summer we had a failed attempt at a coup d'etat in Iran.
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:29.580]  Now we're finding out that the girl who was supposedly shot down in the street, that whole thing was faked to try and bring down Ahmadinejad and restore the son of the shot of power.
[02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:36.580]  And it's just all lies and deceptions. Our government is the bad guy in the modern world and Americans don't like that.
[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:42.580]  They're not comfortable with it. They're not comfortable with these images of how Americans are behaving in these war zones.
[02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:46.580]  I think it's a major break in the credibility of the U.S. government.
[02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:50.580]  I'm not surprised the corporate media is trying to defend it. That's what they're paid to do.
[02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:53.580]  But I don't think they're going to succeed anymore.
[02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:56.580]  That's why they're losing. CNN's lost half its viewers the last year.
[02:11:56.580 --> 02:12:00.580]  So is MSNBC. They're imploding, but Mike expanding on that.
[02:12:00.580 --> 02:12:06.580]  You've been talking about how the government wants to start a physical confrontation because they can't win politically.
[02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:11.580]  Even Limbaugh agrees that Obama may try to suspend elections, may stage a crisis.
[02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:15.580]  We see the anarchist groups fed runs saying they're going to now go attack the tea parties.
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:19.580]  We see the militia getting set up by an FBI informant.
[02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:25.580]  Can you speak to these groups that they set up and provocateur to create the illusion and perception?
[02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:31.580]  We have a national poll out yesterday showing that a large percentage of the tea partyers are actually Democrats.
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:37.580]  This is a populist movement, but how do you see them trying to demonize the populist movement?
[02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:44.580]  Well, I'd like to use an example from way, way back in 1970 at the height of the anti-war protest.
[02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:48.580]  People were against Vietnam. Too many body bags were coming home.
[02:12:48.580 --> 02:12:50.580]  Nobody understood why we were there.
[02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:54.580]  They didn't understand that the real agenda was to secure the flow of heroin back to the United States
[02:12:54.580 --> 02:12:59.580]  and to justify tax money going to political cronies who owned military factories.
[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:02.580]  Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex.
[02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:08.580]  So anyway, summer of 1970 and there's a multi-college campus peace protest scheduled to happen
[02:13:08.580 --> 02:13:13.580]  in front of the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California along Harbor Boulevard.
[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:17.580]  Then once the protest is underway, the protest leaders say, they're not listening to us.
[02:13:17.580 --> 02:13:21.580]  We've got to go in the park. They leap to turnstiles. They lead the protesters inside.
[02:13:21.580 --> 02:13:23.580]  They start knocking over trash cans.
[02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:28.580]  And of course, the press and the police were already waiting there 24 hours later.
[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:34.580]  Every American newspaper had front-page coverage of those darned hippies inside Disneyland
[02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:39.580]  beating up on Mickey Mouse and it completely discredited the anti-war movement
[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:42.580]  and allowed the war to continue for a couple more years.
[02:13:42.580 --> 02:13:49.580]  After that same decade, a whistleblower leaked documents to the press about the FBI's COINTELPRO operation
[02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:56.580]  and it was revealed that this entire riot at Disneyland was a staged operation ordered by the Nixon White House.
[02:13:56.580 --> 02:14:04.580]  All of these organizers of the anti-war protests were undercover FBI informants operating on every college campus.
[02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:09.580]  And by the way, they are still there to this very day and they organized this protest.
[02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:14.580]  They led them inside for the express purpose of tricking them into doing something that the media could use.
[02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:16.580]  And that's now been declassified.
[02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:21.580]  And last Monday I came out and said, watch, they'll be a fed at the highest levels of this militia.
[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:23.580]  They set them up. It's all made up.
[02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:25.580]  Now, a week later, that's admitted.
[02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:30.580]  But I noticed a few of the militias came out and said, no, there's no fed, Alex. You're making that up.
[02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:38.580]  Those guys must be feds because why would someone attack me for defending the militia and exposing that they're being set up?
[02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:40.580]  I'm getting exactly the same thing.
[02:14:40.580 --> 02:14:44.580]  You need to understand that they're putting a lot of investment in this idea.
[02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:52.580]  They have to demonize dissent any way that they can because otherwise, you know, the U.S. government is finished in terms of its own credibility.
[02:14:52.580 --> 02:14:55.580]  So, yeah, there are a lot of FBI informants out there.
[02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:57.580]  They're infiltrating these groups.
[02:14:57.580 --> 02:14:59.580]  In some cases, they're creating them from scratch.
[02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:03.580]  Remember Elohim City that figured prominently in Oklahoma City bombing?
[02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:11.580]  We found out in Carol House court case that Elohim City was founded and was run at the time by a known FBI informant.
[02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:20.580]  The government creates the enemies that you are supposed to be afraid of to run screaming to big daddy government and say, save us, save us, save us.
[02:15:20.580 --> 02:15:22.580]  Adam Gadon is really Adam Perlman.
[02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:24.580]  Yusuf Al-Khattab is really Joseph Cohen.
[02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:26.580]  They are all fakes and frauds.
[02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:29.580]  The government creates the monsters for you to be afraid of.
[02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:31.580]  It's just like the Wizard of Oz.
[02:15:31.580 --> 02:15:38.580]  You know, it's a paper mache head set on fire to scare you into agreeing to go against the Wicked Witch of the West.
[02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:44.580]  And meanwhile, the Wicked Witch of the West is on the payroll of the Wizard of Oz.
[02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:46.580]  Well, yeah, it's all fraud and deception.
[02:15:46.580 --> 02:15:49.580]  It is rule by lie and trickery and deceit.
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:55.580]  The Hegelian dialectic create the monster, then sell the government or sell the people the solution.
[02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:57.580]  Global warming the same thing.
[02:15:57.580 --> 02:16:02.580]  Something that happens naturally, turn it into a crisis and sell the people a solution.
[02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:04.580]  More money, more control over your lives.
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:11.580]  And divide the people along left-right lines and say, if you're a conservative, you're a pro-war, if you're a liberal, you know, you're pro-government healthcare,
[02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:20.580]  when it's all part of the same monster, the same agenda, and all these so-called conservatives that love all this war and torture and tyranny and lies and buy the propaganda.
[02:16:20.580 --> 02:16:22.580]  Do you like what else the government's doing to you?
[02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:24.580]  Do you like how the government's lying to you on every other issue?
[02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:31.580]  It's time to read what George Washington said about not invading countries, about not being an entangling alliances.
[02:16:31.580 --> 02:16:33.580]  It's time to get our republic back.
[02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:38.580]  I want to play three more minutes of the gun pod video and audio.
[02:16:38.580 --> 02:16:44.580]  This cuts in from where they've shot the crowd of reporters and now they're shooting people that are crawling around on the ground.
[02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:47.580]  A minivan pulls in to get some of the wounded.
[02:16:47.580 --> 02:16:49.580]  They open up on it full of children.
[02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:50.580]  Here it is.
[02:16:50.580 --> 02:16:58.580]  It's 1-8. We also have one individual appears to be wounded and trying to crawl away.
[02:16:58.580 --> 02:17:03.580]  Roger. We're going to move down there.
[02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:05.580]  Roger. We'll see you tomorrow.
[02:17:05.580 --> 02:17:08.580]  We won't shoot anymore.
[02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:13.580]  He's getting up.
[02:17:13.580 --> 02:17:15.580]  Maybe he has a weapon.
[02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:17.580]  No, I haven't seen one yet.
[02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:20.580]  You guys got that guy crawling right now on a curb?
[02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:24.580]  Yeah, I got him. I put two rounds in here and you guys are shooting over there too.
[02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:26.580]  We'll see.
[02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:32.580]  We're going to smash the 36L in this hotel P7 over.
[02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:36.580]  Hotel P7, we're going to go ahead.
[02:17:36.580 --> 02:17:43.580]  Roger. I'm just trying to make sure that you guys have my curb over.
[02:17:43.580 --> 02:17:45.580]  Roger.
[02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:49.580]  Come on, buddy.
[02:17:49.580 --> 02:17:53.580]  I got to do it. Pick up a weapon.
[02:17:53.580 --> 02:17:56.580]  First Master Crazy Horse, we have individuals going to the scene.
[02:17:56.580 --> 02:18:00.580]  Looks like possibly picking up bodies and weapons.
[02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:04.580]  We need to stop that. We need to get down there.
[02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:06.580]  We can throw stuff.
[02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:07.580]  Roger.
[02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:16.580]  Frank, Crazy Horse 1-8, you request permission to engage. Pick up the weapon.
[02:18:16.580 --> 02:18:19.580]  Come on, let's shoot.
[02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:24.580]  First Master Crazy Horse 1-8.
[02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:26.580]  We're taking him.
[02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:31.580]  First Master Crazy Horse 1-8.
[02:18:31.580 --> 02:18:33.580]  Book Master 7, Roger.
[02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:36.580]  This is Book Master 7, Roger, engage.
[02:18:36.580 --> 02:18:38.580]  1-8, okay, clear.
[02:18:38.580 --> 02:18:42.580]  Come on.
[02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:45.580]  Clear.
[02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:47.580]  Clear.
[02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:52.580]  Come around, clear.
[02:18:52.580 --> 02:18:53.580]  Roger.
[02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:57.580]  Go ahead and do a...
[02:18:57.580 --> 02:18:59.580]  Clear.
[02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:01.580]  Roger, I lost him.
[02:19:01.580 --> 02:19:06.580]  I got him.
[02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:07.580]  I'm firing.
[02:19:07.580 --> 02:19:10.580]  First Master, we'll be getting BDA on that truck over.
[02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:11.580]  Clear.
[02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:13.580]  This is Crazy Horse 2-8.
[02:19:13.580 --> 02:19:15.580]  I'm shooting for separation.
[02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:18.580]  I think the hand is disabled.
[02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:19.580]  I'm going to shoot it.
[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:25.580]  I've got to add an employment for separation.
[02:19:25.580 --> 02:19:28.580]  Left.
[02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:31.580]  Alright.
[02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:36.580]  And then the rest of the footage is them joking about how kids were in it and laughing at the destruction.
[02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:39.580]  This is evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:40.580]  This is not war.
[02:19:40.580 --> 02:19:41.580]  This is not defensive.
[02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:43.580]  We invaded that country.
[02:19:43.580 --> 02:19:45.580]  Mike Rivera, I want to thank you for spending time with us.
[02:19:45.580 --> 02:19:47.580]  We'll see you again next month.
[02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:48.580]  I look forward to it.
[02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:49.580]  Thank you.
[02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:50.580]  God bless you.
[02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:54.580]  We'll be back with your phone calls a lot more and Governor Jesse Ventura coming up in the next hour.
[02:19:54.580 --> 02:20:01.580]  We'll be right back.

[02:21:25.580 --> 02:21:34.580]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:39.580]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:39.580 --> 02:21:42.580]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.580 --> 02:21:46.580]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.

[02:24:24.580 --> 02:24:26.580]  I'm picking up the loading.
[02:24:26.580 --> 02:24:28.580]  I'm returning confirmation to engage.
[02:24:28.580 --> 02:24:31.580]  Come on, let's just shoot.
[02:24:31.580 --> 02:24:36.580]  I'll push master, crazy horse 1-8.
[02:24:36.580 --> 02:24:38.580]  You're taking him.
[02:24:38.580 --> 02:24:42.580]  I'll push master, crazy horse 1-8.
[02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:44.580]  We're engaged.
[02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:49.580]  Clear. Come on.
[02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:52.580]  Clear.
[02:24:52.580 --> 02:24:55.580]  Clear. Orange.
[02:24:59.580 --> 02:25:03.580]  That is a war crime that you're watching on that tape.
[02:25:03.580 --> 02:25:06.580]  And then we have another part of the tape we're going to play later,
[02:25:06.580 --> 02:25:11.580]  where they are told that there are children inside and they say shouldn't be in a battle.
[02:25:11.580 --> 02:25:12.580]  They weren't in a battle.
[02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:13.580]  It was an ambulance.
[02:25:13.580 --> 02:25:16.580]  It was people coming to get wounded who were reporters.
[02:25:16.580 --> 02:25:18.580]  That is a war crime.
[02:25:18.580 --> 02:25:20.580]  But I know we're the good guys.
[02:25:20.580 --> 02:25:23.580]  Okay, the good guys are the banks that run this country then,
[02:25:23.580 --> 02:25:25.580]  and they're getting ready to take your pension funds openly.
[02:25:25.580 --> 02:25:27.580]  So I guess you support that too.
[02:25:27.580 --> 02:25:29.580]  And I guess you support the police state.
[02:25:29.580 --> 02:25:31.580]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:35.580]  Victoria, Noelle, Evan, Hunter, Herman, Bill and others.
[02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:37.580]  Victoria, you're on the air.
[02:25:37.580 --> 02:25:38.580]  Welcome.
[02:25:38.580 --> 02:25:39.580]  Thank you.
[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:44.580]  I would just like to say, Alex, that it is horrific what is happening in the war zones.
[02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:47.580]  The Pentagon is run by demons from hell,
[02:25:47.580 --> 02:25:50.580]  and they do not represent the American people as a whole.
[02:25:50.580 --> 02:25:55.580]  And the American people are pretty much victims like the rest of humanity on this planet.
[02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:59.580]  Worldwide, we must wake up to the fact that evil is in control
[02:25:59.580 --> 02:26:05.580]  and using the people through dividing conquer tactics such as race, class, gender,
[02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:10.580]  nationality and other mind games they create to keep people from looking at them
[02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:14.580]  and recognizing absolute evil incarnate.
[02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:19.580]  They want to make everyone mechanistic, soulless robots like themselves,
[02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:25.580]  and they're deliberately doing everything they can to destroy America and this image worldwide
[02:26:25.580 --> 02:26:32.580]  so that in the process they can destroy the flame and platform for true freedom and liberty
[02:26:32.580 --> 02:26:39.580]  and guarantee their dictatorship, status, power over planet earth and its inhabitants.
[02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:41.580]  That's what's happening.
[02:26:41.580 --> 02:26:43.580]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:26:43.580 --> 02:26:45.580]  And again, they use a lot of well-meaning people that are in the military
[02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:48.580]  and those that support it to do this.
[02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:51.580]  And it's psychological warfare.
[02:26:51.580 --> 02:26:57.580]  And our government, our country has been seized by pure evil and is being used for pure evil.
[02:26:57.580 --> 02:27:02.580]  And this is nothing compared to them grabbing Iraqi children and beating them almost half to death
[02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:06.580]  and making those demonic cackles and laughing.
[02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:09.580]  And I mean, did you hear me play that earlier?
[02:27:09.580 --> 02:27:11.580]  I did. I did.
[02:27:11.580 --> 02:27:14.580]  And I saw that and it was just unbelievable.
[02:27:14.580 --> 02:27:19.580]  But then it gives the image that, you know, this is the American people.
[02:27:19.580 --> 02:27:23.580]  When it's not, when they are, you know, they don't like us either.
[02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:29.580]  I mean, they're taking away people's pension funds and dumbing the kids down in the school houses in the country
[02:27:29.580 --> 02:27:35.580]  and calling it education and poisoning our water and spraying us overhead in the air.
[02:27:35.580 --> 02:27:37.580]  You know what I mean? They don't care about us either.
[02:27:37.580 --> 02:27:42.580]  Well, a key point, and I appreciate your call, Victoria, that you made is that they divide us.
[02:27:42.580 --> 02:27:44.580]  And then they always play the good cop.
[02:27:44.580 --> 02:27:47.580]  It's like Obama comes out and says, oh, I want to be friendly with talk radio.
[02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:49.580]  Don't have such mean rhetoric.
[02:27:49.580 --> 02:27:51.580]  We may have to censor you.
[02:27:51.580 --> 02:27:55.580]  But then all his surrogates are out saying anybody who criticizes him as a racist
[02:27:55.580 --> 02:27:57.580]  and anybody who didn't want the government running their life as a racist.
[02:27:57.580 --> 02:27:59.580]  And then they play the part of the good guys.
[02:27:59.580 --> 02:28:03.580]  And it's the same thing around the world.
[02:28:03.580 --> 02:28:06.580]  They, they push global unity under a new world order.
[02:28:06.580 --> 02:28:10.580]  But then meanwhile they fund everybody and fund all the different groups to fight with each other.
[02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:14.580]  Here's the actual audio of them laughing about the dead kids.
[02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:16.580]  Here it is.
[02:28:16.580 --> 02:28:21.580]  Hey, I need to get the wrap, the brand to drop a wrap. I got a wounded girl.
[02:28:21.580 --> 02:28:23.580]  We didn't take a rough the mile.
[02:28:23.580 --> 02:28:25.580]  It's their fault for bringing their kids to a battle.
[02:28:25.580 --> 02:28:28.580]  That's right.
[02:28:28.580 --> 02:28:31.580]  And there's some more before that that wasn't the full clip.
[02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:36.580]  I want to challenge listeners to go to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:39.580]  We've written five articles in the last 24 hours.
[02:28:39.580 --> 02:28:45.580]  There's a video I put up there that is a compilation of just some of them running over people's cars with tanks for fun,
[02:28:45.580 --> 02:28:47.580]  shooting people in their cars and laughing for fun,
[02:28:47.580 --> 02:28:49.580]  killing animals for fun,
[02:28:49.580 --> 02:28:51.580]  and of course this new footage.
[02:28:51.580 --> 02:28:52.580]  Everybody needs to see that.
[02:28:52.580 --> 02:28:54.580]  And you need to send these articles.
[02:28:54.580 --> 02:28:57.580]  We've got full of all these videos of what the troops are doing
[02:28:57.580 --> 02:29:01.580]  so that anybody who's in denial out there will face up to what's happening.
[02:29:01.580 --> 02:29:03.580]  But something that didn't shock me,
[02:29:03.580 --> 02:29:05.580]  but it still angers me,
[02:29:05.580 --> 02:29:08.580]  is that on YouTube, on info wars, on prisonplanet,
[02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:10.580]  in the comments,
[02:29:10.580 --> 02:29:12.580]  there are people saying,
[02:29:12.580 --> 02:29:16.580]  yeah, I'm an MP coming back to be a cop, you better watch it.
[02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:18.580]  Yeah, we're doing a great job.
[02:29:18.580 --> 02:29:20.580]  Those people deserve to die.
[02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:22.580]  Or, you know what, we didn't kill that dog.
[02:29:22.580 --> 02:29:24.580]  That's a fake video Alex posted
[02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:27.580]  when the Pentagon a year and a half ago admitted it was real.
[02:29:27.580 --> 02:29:31.580]  We've got unlimited videos of troops killing animals for fun
[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:33.580]  and leaning over them and saying,
[02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:36.580]  you dirty, filthy, ugly dog, you're dying now.
[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:40.580]  I mean, just warped psycho stuff that we're supposed to go,
[02:29:40.580 --> 02:29:42.580]  those are our dear, darling, sweet little troops.
[02:29:42.580 --> 02:29:44.580]  Let's expand more wars.
[02:29:44.580 --> 02:29:46.580]  Let's hire them all for our police departments.
[02:29:46.580 --> 02:29:48.580]  They're all coming for our guns.
[02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:50.580]  You watch. We'll be right back.
[02:29:50.580 --> 02:29:52.580]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:54.580]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.580 --> 02:30:21.580]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:25.580 --> 02:30:29.580]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[02:30:29.580 --> 02:30:30.580]  for you and your family.
[02:30:30.580 --> 02:30:31.580]  And here's the best part,
[02:30:31.580 --> 02:30:34.580]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:38.580]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[02:30:52.580 --> 02:30:54.580]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[02:30:54.580 --> 02:30:57.580]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:30:57.580 --> 02:31:00.580]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:00.580 --> 02:31:02.580]  One major world crisis away
[02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:05.580]  from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:31:05.580 --> 02:31:08.580]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[02:31:08.580 --> 02:31:10.580]  The push for every nation on the globe
[02:31:10.580 --> 02:31:13.580]  to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:31:13.580 --> 02:31:16.580]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government

[02:31:31.580 --> 02:31:34.580]  of total control is being put into place.
[02:31:34.580 --> 02:31:36.580]  This film needs to be seen.
[02:31:36.580 --> 02:31:37.580]  Everybody needs to get it.

[02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:29.580]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[02:32:29.580 --> 02:32:32.580]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:32:32.580 --> 02:32:35.580]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:32:35.580 --> 02:32:39.580]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:41.580]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[02:32:41.580 --> 02:32:43.580]  How much do you want? All you can get.
[02:32:43.580 --> 02:32:44.580]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:32:44.580 --> 02:32:47.580]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:32:47.580 --> 02:32:53.580]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web
[02:32:53.580 --> 02:32:55.580]  at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:32:55.580 --> 02:32:59.580]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:10.580 --> 02:33:12.580]  I got some hate mail here.
[02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:14.580]  People who disagree with me about the troops
[02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:17.580]  and what many of them are doing is wrong
[02:33:17.580 --> 02:33:20.580]  and the rules of engagement are wrong
[02:33:20.580 --> 02:33:22.580]  that you're welcome to call in.
[02:33:22.580 --> 02:33:24.580]  That war is a fraud.
[02:33:25.580 --> 02:33:28.580]  Our government puts Saddam into power and then set him up.
[02:33:28.580 --> 02:33:30.580]  Over a million Iraqis are dead.
[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:34.580]  Supporting the troops doesn't mean supporting illegal wars.
[02:33:35.580 --> 02:33:37.580]  Supporting people killing journalists
[02:33:37.580 --> 02:33:39.580]  when the tanks pulled up in front of the Baghdad hotel
[02:33:39.580 --> 02:33:42.580]  and blew up the Reuters and AP offices.
[02:33:44.580 --> 02:33:46.580]  You'll find out when they take your pension fund, though.
[02:33:46.580 --> 02:33:48.580]  You'll find out this isn't your government.
[02:33:48.580 --> 02:33:50.580]  You'll find out this isn't your country.
[02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:52.580]  It's disgusting.
[02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:54.580]  I'm going to read her comments
[02:33:54.580 --> 02:33:56.580]  and then go to your calls here in a moment.
[02:33:56.580 --> 02:33:58.580]  Also, we've got some big developments
[02:33:58.580 --> 02:34:01.580]  with Barry Sataro, a.k.a. Barack Obama.
[02:34:01.580 --> 02:34:03.580]  I'm told every day, don't criticize him.
[02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:05.580]  You're not supposed to criticize the president.
[02:34:05.580 --> 02:34:07.580]  It's unpatriotic. That's what America's all about.
[02:34:07.580 --> 02:34:09.580]  I've got my free speech. You've got yours.
[02:34:09.580 --> 02:34:11.580]  But that's what this neocon says,
[02:34:11.580 --> 02:34:14.580]  is I'm engaged in hate speech and it should be outlawed.
[02:34:14.580 --> 02:34:17.580]  I love how Republicans now are calling for the end of free speech.
[02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:19.580]  They really trained you well
[02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:21.580]  to get brainwashing. You're not a conservative.
[02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:23.580]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors
[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:25.580]  that have made today's radio show possible.
[02:34:25.580 --> 02:34:27.580]  One of them is MySolarBackup.com.
[02:34:27.580 --> 02:34:29.580]  Have you lost your power
[02:34:29.580 --> 02:34:31.580]  and wanted to simply flip the switch
[02:34:31.580 --> 02:34:33.580]  to get the lights back on?
[02:34:33.580 --> 02:34:35.580]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com
[02:34:35.580 --> 02:34:37.580]  because there's never been a better time
[02:34:37.580 --> 02:34:39.580]  to get started getting off the grid
[02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:41.580]  and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:43.580]  Unlike gas generators or solar generator,
[02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:45.580]  runs quietly and amidst no fumes.
[02:34:45.580 --> 02:34:47.580]  Takes about a minute and a half to hook up.
[02:34:47.580 --> 02:34:50.580]  You can also use it in your workshop or campsite.
[02:34:50.580 --> 02:34:52.580]  You can give them a call to get a free information package,
[02:34:52.580 --> 02:34:54.580]  877-327-0365.
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:57.580]  That's 877-327-0365
[02:34:57.580 --> 02:35:00.580]  or one word, MySolarBackup.com.
[02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:03.580]  And one other great sponsor I want to tell you about
[02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:06.580]  is Pure Water Freedom.
[02:35:06.580 --> 02:35:09.580]  What a great lineup of in-house filters
[02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:11.580]  or filters for your entire water system.
[02:35:11.580 --> 02:35:13.580]  They have systems that actually get the floor right out.
[02:35:13.580 --> 02:35:16.580]  Most systems don't do this.
[02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:19.580]  Pure Water Freedom, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:19.580 --> 02:35:22.580]  Purewaterfreedom.com is the website.

[02:35:24.580 --> 02:35:27.580]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.
[02:35:27.580 --> 02:35:30.580]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home
[02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:32.580]  with a whole house fluoride system
[02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:34.580]  because you absorb it through your skin in the shower and bath.
[02:35:34.580 --> 02:35:36.580]  They have a wide variety of filters
[02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:38.580]  that remove all types of toxins from the water,
[02:35:38.580 --> 02:35:40.580]  including shower and bath filters.
[02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:42.580]  I guess it's unpatriotic though to want to drink clean water.
[02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:44.580]  We should just trust the government.
[02:35:44.580 --> 02:35:46.580]  Purewaterfreedom.com.

[02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:51.580]  Okay, I want to read something negative from someone.
[02:35:51.580 --> 02:35:54.580]  Of course, 98% is positive feedback.
[02:35:54.580 --> 02:35:56.580]  People are welcome who disagree to call in.
[02:35:56.580 --> 02:36:00.580]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:36:00.580 --> 02:36:03.580]  But this is the type of stuff I get.
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:06.580]  You know, Tony Shaffer, Colonel in Afghanistan and Iraq
[02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:09.580]  said they violated the rules of engagement, their rules.
[02:36:09.580 --> 02:36:12.580]  They fired at wounded people.
[02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:14.580]  They didn't have guns. They had cameras.
[02:36:14.580 --> 02:36:17.580]  They killed those people. They shot up those kids.
[02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:21.580]  And then I'm bad to say that they're training our troops to be killers.
[02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:23.580]  In fact, queue up that video again,
[02:36:23.580 --> 02:36:25.580]  of British troops bringing kids into a base,
[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:27.580]  ages 6 to 12,
[02:36:27.580 --> 02:36:30.580]  beating them while U.S. troops make demonic noises,
[02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:31.580]  getting off on it.
[02:36:31.580 --> 02:36:33.580]  If this isn't demonic,
[02:36:33.580 --> 02:36:35.580]  and queue up the puppy-killing video,
[02:36:35.580 --> 02:36:37.580]  we're going to play it after that.
[02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:40.580]  Just for this lady, Sandra,
[02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:43.580]  I'm going to say her...
[02:36:43.580 --> 02:36:45.580]  This is Semper Fidelis.
[02:36:45.580 --> 02:36:48.580]  Oh, you're going to have fidelity to the core?
[02:36:48.580 --> 02:36:50.580]  No matter what they... It's like Hitler.
[02:36:50.580 --> 02:36:51.580]  No matter what they do.
[02:36:51.580 --> 02:36:53.580]  Dear Alex, I'm writing to inform you that,
[02:36:53.580 --> 02:36:55.580]  effective immediately, I've canceled my subscription
[02:36:55.580 --> 02:36:57.580]  to Prison Planet Dot TV.
[02:36:57.580 --> 02:36:59.580]  You won't agree with my reasons,
[02:36:59.580 --> 02:37:01.580]  but today's show was an insult to our military
[02:37:01.580 --> 02:37:03.580]  and to our military families.
[02:37:03.580 --> 02:37:05.580]  Alex, my son, is United States Marines,
[02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:07.580]  and I'm very proud of him and the young men
[02:37:07.580 --> 02:37:09.580]  that defend our country.
[02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:11.580]  We're going to stand up then against the bad leaders
[02:37:11.580 --> 02:37:13.580]  that launch false wars
[02:37:13.580 --> 02:37:15.580]  and who train our troops to be like this.
[02:37:15.580 --> 02:37:17.580]  Huh? Huh?
[02:37:17.580 --> 02:37:19.580]  You're saying, oh, this is good.
[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:22.580]  Thereby, no beans, baby killers, murderers, et cetera.
[02:37:22.580 --> 02:37:25.580]  Well, I mean, we just showed them shooting kids in...
[02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:28.580]  Your show today was a form of hate speech.
[02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:30.580]  Oh, see, using a communist term.
[02:37:30.580 --> 02:37:32.580]  Now my speech is hate speech. I need to be banned.
[02:37:32.580 --> 02:37:35.580]  Your show today was a form of hate speech against the military.
[02:37:35.580 --> 02:37:37.580]  You can take an example of a few bad apples,
[02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:39.580]  but that doesn't represent the majority of our military.
[02:37:39.580 --> 02:37:41.580]  I've had the privilege to be around many young, fine soldiers,
[02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:43.580]  and they're the best.
[02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:45.580]  They aren't a bunch of losers and hate-mongers.
[02:37:45.580 --> 02:37:47.580]  You owe the American people an apology.
[02:37:47.580 --> 02:37:49.580]  Semper Fidelis, Sandra.
[02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:51.580]  Ticket number 166321.
[02:37:51.580 --> 02:37:53.580]  Okay.
[02:37:53.580 --> 02:37:55.580]  Whatever, lady.
[02:37:55.580 --> 02:37:57.580]  I could be on 500 radio stations right now
[02:37:57.580 --> 02:38:00.580]  instead of 80 if I sold out and was a fake neocon.
[02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:03.580]  You know, we got Prison Planet Dot TV memberships.
[02:38:03.580 --> 02:38:05.580]  You want to watch the live show, get the films first,
[02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:08.580]  see them in higher quality, read my book, Paul Watson's book.
[02:38:08.580 --> 02:38:10.580]  But I give all the films away for free.
[02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:12.580]  They're all over the web.
[02:38:12.580 --> 02:38:14.580]  I promote where they are for free.
[02:38:14.580 --> 02:38:17.580]  So threatening me monetarily means absolutely nothing.
[02:38:17.580 --> 02:38:19.580]  All I've got is my honor.
[02:38:19.580 --> 02:38:22.580]  All I've got is the fact that that war is a fraud and a lie,
[02:38:22.580 --> 02:38:24.580]  and the WMDs were premeditated lie,
[02:38:24.580 --> 02:38:27.580]  and that over a million Iraqis were killed.
[02:38:27.580 --> 02:38:29.580]  That's all I've got is the truth.
[02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:31.580]  That's an evil war.
[02:38:31.580 --> 02:38:33.580]  Okay, it's all evil.
[02:38:33.580 --> 02:38:35.580]  That's Obama's all for it.
[02:38:35.580 --> 02:38:38.580]  Okay, get it through your head.
[02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:40.580]  Those young, nice boys,
[02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:42.580]  the Marines are running legal checkpoints under Northcom
[02:38:42.580 --> 02:38:44.580]  all over the country.
[02:38:44.580 --> 02:38:46.580]  I'm not against the individual Marines,
[02:38:46.580 --> 02:38:49.580]  but I am against what they're being ordered to do.
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:51.580]  Don't you get it through your head?
[02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:53.580]  Don't you understand the Mayak and Homeland Security reports
[02:38:53.580 --> 02:38:55.580]  that were actually written up by Bush's people
[02:38:55.580 --> 02:38:57.580]  and continued by Obama?
[02:38:57.580 --> 02:38:59.580]  Target your son as an enemy of America
[02:38:59.580 --> 02:39:01.580]  when they're done with him.
[02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:03.580]  But you don't get it, you don't understand it.
[02:39:03.580 --> 02:39:05.580]  That's why you're going to lose your pension fund,
[02:39:05.580 --> 02:39:07.580]  your standard of living.
[02:39:07.580 --> 02:39:09.580]  That's why you're going to be a slave.
[02:39:09.580 --> 02:39:11.580]  It's why they're going to let the environmentalists take your property,
[02:39:11.580 --> 02:39:13.580]  because you won't grow up, you won't wake up.
[02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:15.580]  But hey, just for you,
[02:39:15.580 --> 02:39:18.580]  I mean, there's hundreds of these videos.
[02:39:18.580 --> 02:39:21.580]  There was only 300,000 people in the Iraqi army.
[02:39:21.580 --> 02:39:23.580]  Let's say they killed them all.
[02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:26.580]  That's over 700,000 civilians killed.
[02:39:26.580 --> 02:39:28.580]  They wouldn't even let them take those little girls
[02:39:28.580 --> 02:39:32.580]  that were shot up to the U.S. military base for medical care.
[02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:34.580]  Those little girls don't deserve it.
[02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:36.580]  I know you're around all these fine young men
[02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:38.580]  that you think are so handsome
[02:39:38.580 --> 02:39:40.580]  that come around and eat baked cookies at your house.
[02:39:40.580 --> 02:39:43.580]  The point is, is that we're being baptized in evil,
[02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:45.580]  and I'm not going to be part of it.
[02:39:45.580 --> 02:39:48.580]  This worship of the military and the worship of everything they do,
[02:39:48.580 --> 02:39:50.580]  all over TV and radio and billboards,
[02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:52.580]  why do you think that's going on?
[02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:55.580]  Because they know that what's happening here is wrong.
[02:39:55.580 --> 02:39:57.580]  They know this is an evil war.
[02:39:57.580 --> 02:39:59.580]  You didn't hear me read.
[02:39:59.580 --> 02:40:01.580]  Like, where is my article?
[02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:03.580]  Out of Reuters.
[02:40:03.580 --> 02:40:05.580]  What is it you don't understand
[02:40:05.580 --> 02:40:07.580]  that the U.S. government's protecting the opium fields?
[02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:09.580]  Reuters.
[02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:11.580]  You're not a patriot.
[02:40:11.580 --> 02:40:13.580]  You're not for the opium now.
[02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:15.580]  It's just, it's just, don't you understand
[02:40:15.580 --> 02:40:18.580]  evil people are in control of the government?
[02:40:18.580 --> 02:40:21.580]  I'm not saying the entire German military was bad.
[02:40:21.580 --> 02:40:23.580]  Hitler was bad.
[02:40:23.580 --> 02:40:25.580]  And you know what, the military did what they were told,
[02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:28.580]  because they weren't going to go against the military.
[02:40:28.580 --> 02:40:31.580]  I owe my allegiance to the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[02:40:31.580 --> 02:40:33.580]  and common sense and honor.
[02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:35.580]  And you're going to figure that out.
[02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:37.580]  And let me tell you something.
[02:40:37.580 --> 02:40:39.580]  I've been around the troops.
[02:40:39.580 --> 02:40:41.580]  I've been around the rank and file.
[02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:43.580]  I mean, you realize that in many units,
[02:40:43.580 --> 02:40:45.580]  upwards of a third of them are illegal aliens that were hired.
[02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:48.580]  In other units, it's gangbangers and criminals.
[02:40:48.580 --> 02:40:50.580]  I mean, you realize what they're doing with the military.
[02:40:50.580 --> 02:40:52.580]  I guess you're going to salute all those illegal alien troops.
[02:40:52.580 --> 02:40:54.580]  Tell me what the biggest recruiting center in the world
[02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:56.580]  is the Marine Corps and the armies in Mexico City.
[02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:58.580]  I got to salute the foreign troops in our uniform.
[02:40:58.580 --> 02:41:01.580]  Yes, you will bow down to them over the Constitution.
[02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:03.580]  That's what matters to you. That's what you worship.
[02:41:03.580 --> 02:41:05.580]  All right, I got Ventura coming up,
[02:41:05.580 --> 02:41:07.580]  and I want to at least get to these calls that are on the board right now.
[02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:10.580]  But let's play the video in the audio of young kids
[02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:12.580]  being beaten within an inch of their lives
[02:41:12.580 --> 02:41:16.580]  and their crotch is stomped while demonic people make pleasure noises.
[02:41:16.580 --> 02:41:18.580]  Listen to this.
[02:41:18.580 --> 02:41:20.580]  Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
[02:41:20.580 --> 02:41:22.580]  You're going to get it.
[02:41:22.580 --> 02:41:24.580]  No, no.
[02:41:25.580 --> 02:41:28.580]  Yes. No, two little boys.
[02:41:28.580 --> 02:41:30.580]  No, no.
[02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:33.580]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:35.580]  No, no, no.
[02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:37.580]  Yes.
[02:41:37.580 --> 02:41:39.580]  No.
[02:41:39.580 --> 02:41:41.580]  Yes.
[02:41:41.580 --> 02:41:43.580]  No, no, no.
[02:41:43.580 --> 02:41:45.580]  No, no, no.
[02:41:45.580 --> 02:41:47.580]  Please.
[02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:49.580]  No, please, don't hurt me.
[02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:51.580]  No, no, no.
[02:41:51.580 --> 02:42:05.340]  That's enough. See, I'm not supposed to show this because I'm only showing bad apples.
[02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:10.100]  I'm supposed to cover it up and let these people get promoted. I'm not supposed to speak
[02:42:10.100 --> 02:42:15.500]  out against any of it. I need to sit down and shut up and stop my hate speech. For six
[02:42:15.500 --> 02:42:18.660]  months they said this video was fake and the Marine Corps admitted it was real. I can show
[02:42:18.660 --> 02:42:24.020]  you endless videos of troops killing little puppies, but I guess it's a haji puppy. I
[02:42:24.020 --> 02:42:28.620]  guess you'd use the term a rag head puppy. And so it deserves to die. Let's show the
[02:42:28.620 --> 02:42:34.620]  video of the killing of the puppy. And here is CNN puppy throwing Marine is removed, removed
[02:42:34.620 --> 02:42:38.420]  from the core. I guess the Marine Corps shouldn't remove the bad apple. I guess they should
[02:42:38.420 --> 02:42:43.260]  even have criticized him. The Marine Corps should have said that's good. But of course
[02:42:43.260 --> 02:42:46.060]  you're delusional. You'll just say the video is fake, even though it's admitted for you
[02:42:46.060 --> 02:43:04.300]  and I have to be real. Here it is. That's mean. But I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm bad for showing
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:10.820]  you that or Reuters reporters being killed or I was wrong to show police in Oakland with
[02:43:10.820 --> 02:43:14.980]  a guy in handcuffs shooting him in the back unarmed and then try to grab everybody's cameras
[02:43:14.980 --> 02:43:20.740]  and say they didn't do it. I guess I'm anti police. Our police and military are being
[02:43:20.740 --> 02:43:25.300]  forged into corrupt evil right now. And if you don't know that they have torture camps
[02:43:25.300 --> 02:43:29.580]  all over the planet where they rape children. That's the army's own report. Am I supposed
[02:43:29.580 --> 02:43:34.860]  to say that's good now? You people have bought into corruption, bought into evil and you're
[02:43:34.860 --> 02:43:40.340]  going to go all the way down with it. You're just like the Nazis, Germans. You're just
[02:43:40.340 --> 02:43:45.260]  like the Soviets. And you're just like the Maoist. You're just like Fidel Castro's people
[02:43:45.260 --> 02:43:48.580]  and you have bought into evil and torture and the Patriot Act. And now it's all going
[02:43:48.580 --> 02:43:55.380]  to be used against you. Remember that. Remember that. All right. Let's go to Noel in Illinois.
[02:43:55.380 --> 02:43:59.660]  You're on the air. Thanks for holding. Hey Alex, how are you this afternoon, my man?
[02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:04.060]  I'm really shook up. I mean, because I've had to go. I've tried to subconsciously I've
[02:44:04.060 --> 02:44:09.580]  ignored most of these videos because I don't enjoy bashing the military. But I mean, now
[02:44:09.580 --> 02:44:14.420]  I think I should do every show on it for these people out there that are in denial.
[02:44:14.420 --> 02:44:22.860]  You know, for those, there's a documentary, The New American Century. It shows that clip
[02:44:22.860 --> 02:44:29.420]  you just showed, not the puppy punting, but that sadistic military guy. It seems like
[02:44:29.420 --> 02:44:33.500]  he was pleasuring himself while seeing people killed. New American Century. It also shows
[02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:39.340]  Blackwater shooting people, just randomly driving in the streets of Afghanistan, just
[02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:43.700]  shooting them in the back, uh, back of their car, just laughing about it. It's, it's quite
[02:44:43.700 --> 02:44:50.420]  disgusting. And I feel, no, you're not a Patriot. You're not a Patriot. According to them,
[02:44:50.420 --> 02:44:55.980]  raping children with battery acid is good. And believing that Al Gore is, you know, you're
[02:44:55.980 --> 02:44:59.660]  going to save our lives. I don't believe that either. So I'm bad as well. Yeah, you think
[02:44:59.660 --> 02:45:04.020]  for yourself, you're bad. You're supposed to sit down and shut up and worship government.
[02:45:04.020 --> 02:45:08.340]  Um, a friend of mine, I think he's got, hopefully post this video on your, on your Facebook
[02:45:08.340 --> 02:45:15.100]  page, but Candy Crawley of CNN. There's a video of a soldier just shooting a wounded
[02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:20.980]  Iraqi person right in the street. And it just shows her, shows him doing it on CNN. Hopefully
[02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:27.140]  post that up. But everyone needs to be irate about this because the United States government
[02:45:27.140 --> 02:45:32.820]  treats our men and women of the armed services like guinea pigs. We all know about MK ultra.
[02:45:32.820 --> 02:45:37.220]  We know that they give them drugs. See, that's another thing. They abuse the troops. They
[02:45:37.220 --> 02:45:41.900]  warped their minds. They put them in two, three, four tours, which they even do in World
[02:45:41.900 --> 02:45:48.180]  War two. And then we're anti military when we say treat our troops better. See how the
[02:45:48.180 --> 02:45:54.820]  Cyop works. It's disgusting. I mean, you have MK ultra. You have them giving our soldiers
[02:45:54.820 --> 02:46:00.180]  drugs and then, and then we spit them out like chewing tobacco. Our government does.
[02:46:00.180 --> 02:46:05.100]  And then we give them the worst healthcare in the world with the VA hospitals. My uncle's
[02:46:05.100 --> 02:46:11.180]  an ex-soldier. He was stationed out in Germany and he has bipolar. So they just give him
[02:46:11.180 --> 02:46:16.340]  all these bad drugs and he just loses it because of these drugs that our government gives them.
[02:46:16.340 --> 02:46:23.620]  So it's worse than that. Project Shad, they killed our troops in test. I mean, it's, but
[02:46:23.620 --> 02:46:27.340]  oh, that's patriotic. Don't talk bad about the government killing our troops. Don't
[02:46:27.340 --> 02:46:29.860]  talk about the government giving black men syphilis. Don't talk about the government
[02:46:29.860 --> 02:46:34.100]  taking CPS kids for no reason. Don't take about, talk about Dinecore running CPS in
[02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:38.620]  the US now. Don't talk about it. It's, it's not patriotic. You just have to let them do
[02:46:38.620 --> 02:46:42.500]  that to the troops. You don't support them. Put them in false wars. Let them get their
[02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:47.420]  arms and legs blown off. That's patriotic. It's, it's sick. It's Pentagon brainwashing.
[02:46:47.420 --> 02:46:53.860]  Alex, I have another thing. Barry Satoro, our war fighting commander in chief. That's
[02:46:53.860 --> 02:46:59.740]  another thing we can put against him. Continuing these false wars, breaking, you know, I hear
[02:46:59.740 --> 02:47:04.940]  you know, I got to jump to other calls, but since you brought that up, we know he was
[02:47:04.940 --> 02:47:08.940]  born in Kenya. The evidence is clear, but we also know his real name is Barry Satoro.
[02:47:08.940 --> 02:47:13.500]  That's admitted mainstream news. He was adopted in Indonesia for six years. He was in the
[02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:16.900]  Muslim schools, but that's okay if he's the president. I'm not saying Muslims are bad.
[02:47:16.900 --> 02:47:21.740]  The point is he's lying about it and his real name is Barry Satoro. We have this t-shirt
[02:47:21.740 --> 02:47:27.420]  available now at info wars.com, a picture of so-called Obama says Barry Satoro to show
[02:47:27.420 --> 02:47:32.800]  us the birth certificate on the back. It says info wars.com. Add to all of this this new
[02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:43.820]  video of Michelle Obama a few weeks ago, slipping up and saying his home country, his home country
[02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:48.220]  of Kenya and his grandmother's own record saying he was born there. But regardless,
[02:47:48.220 --> 02:47:55.460]  we know he's not the re you could not be a citizen of Indonesia and then come back and
[02:47:55.460 --> 02:48:02.460]  get your US citizenship and be natural born under federal law. He is absolutely off the
[02:48:02.460 --> 02:48:06.620]  list to be president. This is a fact. We got to get this information out no better way
[02:48:06.620 --> 02:48:13.260]  than with this t-shirt and with this video. Here is Michelle Satoro known as Michelle
[02:48:13.260 --> 02:48:19.820]  Obama, Barry Satoro's wife, the fraudulent first lady admitting born in Kenya. Equality
[02:48:19.820 --> 02:48:27.460]  in the LGBT community. He's also spoken out against the stigma surrounding HIV testing,
[02:48:27.460 --> 02:48:33.060]  which is still plaguing so many of our communities, which you all know a lot of that is due to
[02:48:33.060 --> 02:48:40.180]  homophobia. Barak has led by example. When we took our trip to Africa and visited his
[02:48:40.180 --> 02:48:47.380]  home country in Kenya, we took a public HIV test. When we took our trip to Africa and
[02:48:47.380 --> 02:48:53.820]  visited his home country in Kenya. When we took our trip to Africa and visited his home
[02:48:53.820 --> 02:48:58.860]  country in Kenya. There you have it, ladies and gentlemen, his home country, Kenya. My
[02:48:58.860 --> 02:49:03.900]  home country is the United States. My home states, Texas. If I was ever president, I
[02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:08.580]  wouldn't get up there and say my home country, Kenya. I guess Schwarzenegger's home country
[02:49:08.580 --> 02:49:15.820]  in Austria. Let's talk to Evan in Texas. You're on the air. Hi. I was calling. I heard I watched
[02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:25.180]  a video of the Apache attack on 15 and I was calling in to ask, how could I give my friends
[02:49:25.180 --> 02:49:31.940]  who are also around my age, like 16, 17, to watch the movies and stuff. They just think
[02:49:31.940 --> 02:49:35.260]  it's all just a joke and stuff. They don't really pay attention to giving much. Move
[02:49:35.260 --> 02:49:39.940]  on from your friends. Find other friends. Find people that care. You don't want to hang
[02:49:39.940 --> 02:49:48.780]  around with idiots. Stop caring what they think. Move on to other people. I wouldn't
[02:49:48.780 --> 02:49:54.220]  waste your time. I would find people that do care and work with them. Don't waste your
[02:49:54.220 --> 02:49:58.620]  time on people that were born to be slave losers. Later, they'll wake up when Big Brother
[02:49:58.620 --> 02:50:04.180]  heard some bad. But then people will tell them they're not patriotic when they criticize.
[02:50:04.180 --> 02:50:10.980]  Go ahead. Can I have some help on how I can tell them how to watch these videos and stuff
[02:50:10.980 --> 02:50:14.420]  and give them the information? Well, I mean, they know how to use a search engine, don't
[02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:21.420]  they? Yeah. End game. Blueprint for global enslavement. Truth rising. Fall of the Republic.
[02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:26.060]  The Obama deception. Tens and tens and tens of millions of views on YouTube, Google, everywhere
[02:50:26.060 --> 02:50:33.260]  else or buy the high quality DVD and support us and give them copies of it. All right.
[02:50:33.260 --> 02:50:39.620]  Good job. Take the initiative, Evan. I specifically said I'm taking calls, though, about the mass
[02:50:39.620 --> 02:50:45.020]  killing that just went on. Pointpeopleandinfowars.com and presentplanet.com. You know, everybody's
[02:50:45.020 --> 02:50:50.620]  making a big deal out of this video of them killing reporters and shooting kids. The caller
[02:50:50.620 --> 02:50:56.620]  mentioned I remember U.S. forces attack the press at Baghdad Hotel. Pull that up. I mean,
[02:50:56.620 --> 02:51:00.740]  they just pull up. They know it's the press building. They open fire and laugh about it.
[02:51:00.740 --> 02:51:04.860]  It's our troops, the good guys. Attention, landscapers, house painters, carpet cleaners,
[02:51:04.860 --> 02:51:09.460]  pet sitters, gutter cleaners, and anyone who has their own home service business. Would

[02:52:19.380 --> 02:52:24.620]  It means all the world under their control. The United Nations would take over America,
[02:52:24.620 --> 02:52:29.680]  the Trilateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles how men
[02:52:29.680 --> 02:52:34.260]  of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[02:52:34.260 --> 02:52:39.340]  world government. I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[02:52:39.340 --> 02:52:43.900]  for the global financial system. Global governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's
[02:52:43.900 --> 02:52:48.620]  going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're

[02:54:13.060 --> 02:54:18.260]  Jones to send your questions for Jesse Ventura coming up in the next hour. Here's another
[02:54:18.260 --> 02:54:22.780]  email we got from a mother. Alex, I'm listening to your broadcast. I agree with you 100% that
[02:54:22.780 --> 02:54:27.500]  our children are turning into zombies. I have three sons serving each of them, have gone
[02:54:27.500 --> 02:54:33.700]  from warm loving to heartless and uncaring. My one son recently came home from RR. Alex,
[02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:38.620]  I cannot even begin to explain to you who he is anymore. He is obsessed with death war
[02:54:38.620 --> 02:54:45.140]  and now has gone so far as placing his messages on body tattoos to see him with a tattoo
[02:54:45.140 --> 02:54:52.140]  of Satan praying a skull with satanic signs. His original tattoo was a praying hands.
[02:54:52.140 --> 02:54:56.820]  He had that change to Satan praying. I tried to tell him to take a better look at what
[02:54:56.820 --> 02:55:01.100]  he's truly going on. He is brainwashed, Alex. Please continue to let people know what is
[02:55:01.100 --> 02:55:09.020]  going on. We need to realize that our family members are being used as pawns. These are
[02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:13.340]  evil wars. These are unjust wars, ladies and gentlemen. This is going to destroy America.
[02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:18.380]  This is bankrupting America. But a lot of you sign the dotted line. You want to be part
[02:55:18.380 --> 02:55:23.140]  of it. You have bought the line. And so we are all going to be judged. Just know that
[02:55:23.140 --> 02:55:26.980]  right now. I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up for about three or four minutes. Then we
[02:55:26.980 --> 02:55:31.940]  are going to get to Hunter, Bill, Jeff, Casey and Cole. Probably when Ventura is on. So
[02:55:31.940 --> 02:55:35.860]  I am going to get to your calls. But I want to bring Ted up for about three minutes because
[02:55:35.860 --> 02:55:40.660]  gold has been racing up again. Ted bought it back at the 1,050 level with it up above
[02:55:40.660 --> 02:55:45.900]  1,130 right now. He has almost run out of the gold and silver coins that he bought when
[02:55:45.900 --> 02:55:49.900]  gold and silver were lower. So I wanted him to briefly give you that offer because you
[02:55:49.900 --> 02:55:52.900]  are not going to find a deal better anywhere. He also has a deal where you get a quarter
[02:55:52.900 --> 02:56:00.140]  or fifth of an ounce European gold Frank coin and get a free international forecaster newsletter
[02:56:00.140 --> 02:56:06.980]  subscription $159 value for a full year. There is no deal as good as that. But I wouldn't
[02:56:06.980 --> 02:56:10.660]  just buy one coin. I would take advantage of the Alex Jones special. Ted, tell us what
[02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:12.780]  is on the Alex Jones special. What is you have got left?
[02:56:12.780 --> 02:56:18.820]  Well, really the best buy that I have right now is that Frank at $249.68. I mean, everybody
[02:56:18.820 --> 02:56:24.980]  remembers me at $261.61 here just a short while ago. That is because gold dipped down
[02:56:24.980 --> 02:56:31.540]  there at that 1,080 level and I was able to accumulate some of those at that price. The
[02:56:31.540 --> 02:56:37.620]  sovereign obviously is a good buy right now, $312.42 as well. I know that my internet prices
[02:56:37.620 --> 02:56:41.780]  have already increased so you have to actually call for this order and you have to say that
[02:56:41.780 --> 02:56:45.740]  you heard it on the Alex Jones show to get that price. Otherwise, you will be paying
[02:56:45.740 --> 02:56:50.620]  a bit more for them. Real hot right now, the fractional silver. I was real surprised to
[02:56:50.620 --> 02:56:55.500]  see how well they are doing. It is those Montana people. I mean, they are great patriots and
[02:56:55.500 --> 02:56:59.660]  they are making these one ounce, half ounce, quarter ounce and 10 ounce. They call it the
[02:56:59.660 --> 02:57:06.620]  silver sovereign coin and it really is doing well there too. We have some old 20s and 10s
[02:57:06.620 --> 02:57:11.940]  and a small amount of bullion coins, some junk silver and some older walking Liberty
[02:57:11.940 --> 02:57:17.860]  halves. Just a plethora or a variety of different coins that I picked up at that level before
[02:57:17.860 --> 02:57:26.100]  silver went from 15 to what $18 an ounce now and now gold just touching $1,140 an ounce.
[02:57:26.100 --> 02:57:32.020]  Oh wow, up even more. We are talking almost $100 up from when you got these coins. You
[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:41.420]  are passing on that massive savings, 800-686-2237-800-686-2237. Tell them Alex Jones sent you and your
[02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:45.420]  purchase also goes towards supporting Ted Anderson, the known as the Genesis Network and Midas
[02:57:45.420 --> 02:57:55.980]  Resources. But to get these special deals, tell them Alex Jones sent you 800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[02:57:55.980 --> 02:57:59.780]  Look at all the financial news. Look at Bloomberg, how the feds are saying they want to take
[02:57:59.780 --> 02:58:05.020]  your pension funds now. It's time to move part of your assets into gold and silver and
[02:58:05.020 --> 02:58:11.220]  to physically hold it, 800-686-2237. Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:58:11.220 --> 02:58:13.020]  Yeah, thanks a lot Alex.
[02:58:13.020 --> 02:58:19.980]  Again that number if you missed it, 800-686-2237. Coming up in the next hour, former Minnesota
[02:58:19.980 --> 02:58:26.940]  Governor, movie star, professional wrestler, Navy SEAL, underwater demolitions team. You
[02:58:26.940 --> 02:58:31.660]  name it, he will be joining us to talk about a host of issues and we'll get his take on
[02:58:31.660 --> 02:58:37.700]  the latest gun pod footage that's been leaked out of Iraq. It's all coming up on the other
[02:58:37.700 --> 02:58:43.300]  side of this quick break. Stay with us.
[02:58:43.300 --> 02:58:51.220]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:51.220 --> 02:58:55.740]  Hi this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[02:58:55.740 --> 02:59:00.380]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:59:00.380 --> 02:59:03.900]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[02:59:03.900 --> 02:59:07.380]  all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[02:59:07.380 --> 02:59:11.940]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect
[02:59:11.940 --> 02:59:18.140]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply
[02:59:18.140 --> 02:59:22.700]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part, these seeds have
[02:59:22.700 --> 02:59:27.380]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[02:59:27.380 --> 02:59:34.180]  acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com
[02:59:34.180 --> 02:59:45.500]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[02:59:45.500 --> 02:59:54.100]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:54.100 --> 03:00:08.100]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:08.100 --> 03:00:12.380]  Well we normally twist his arm to stay even longer than an hour. We can't do that today
[03:00:12.380 --> 03:00:16.300]  because this is the last hour of the radio broadcast. We're always honored to have him.
[03:00:16.300 --> 03:00:22.300]  He just flew back in from Mexico last night into New York. He's kicking off his tour today
[03:00:22.300 --> 03:00:25.980]  and we're honored to have him on with us for the next hour. I don't know what it was about
[03:00:25.980 --> 03:00:29.980]  that last interview, but I heard from Jesse's folks it was his favorite interview here on
[03:00:29.980 --> 03:00:34.740]  the show. Listeners said it was their favorite. The most views online. Really great interview
[03:00:34.740 --> 03:00:39.620]  we did just about a month ago. And now Governor Jesse Ventura is back with us today. The good
[03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:45.020]  news is, in fact here it is, here's the book down here on the floor, Jesse Ventura, American
[03:00:45.020 --> 03:00:48.900]  Conspiracies has been as high as number four on the New York Times bestseller list. It's
[03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:54.980]  been holding up at seven in the top ten and that shows the people are hungry for the truth.
[03:00:54.980 --> 03:00:58.580]  So I just want to say congratulations to Governor Jesse Ventura on another bestselling book.
[03:00:58.580 --> 03:01:02.860]  Well thank you, Alex, and thanks for all the help because you certainly help in your show
[03:01:02.860 --> 03:01:09.340]  and listeners on that, but it's what's interesting, Alex, is that the book has not been reviewed
[03:01:09.340 --> 03:01:16.180]  by any book reviewer. Isn't that amazing? Here it's been in the New York Times top ten
[03:01:16.180 --> 03:01:22.220]  for four weeks now, I think, and not one reviewer has even reviewed the book. Well, I think
[03:01:22.220 --> 03:01:26.740]  that's an endorsement. Just like to Huffington Post censored your article about 9-11, even
[03:01:26.740 --> 03:01:31.420]  though they asked you to write it, now you're seeing censorship in the book world. That's
[03:01:31.420 --> 03:01:37.460]  unheard of, four weeks New York Times top ten and no book reviews. Yeah, well, there's
[03:01:37.460 --> 03:01:44.460]  a few reviews on the internet, but there's been no reviews by any of the major media.
[03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:49.340]  No reviews of the book at all. I think it's a case, Alex, where they feel that if they
[03:01:49.340 --> 03:01:54.900]  review it, they give it credibility, so they're staying away from it. Unbelievable. We'll walk
[03:01:54.900 --> 03:01:58.740]  through some of the things that are covered in the book and why it's seen as controversial,
[03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:03.420]  but you know, that's why the mainstream media is dying is because people know they're acting
[03:02:03.420 --> 03:02:09.260]  as gatekeepers. Oh, there's no doubt about it. You know, they, I just spoke earlier on
[03:02:09.260 --> 03:02:14.860]  another show and they asked me how I, if, if, why the mainstream media won't question
[03:02:14.860 --> 03:02:19.660]  the government. And I said it's simple because if they don't play along with the government,
[03:02:19.660 --> 03:02:25.420]  they get no access to them. And if they're denied access to them, they're dead in the
[03:02:25.420 --> 03:02:30.100]  government. So therefore they go along to get along so that they can do their jobs and
[03:02:30.100 --> 03:02:34.980]  continue to have access with, you know, the senators, the congressman, the president and
[03:02:34.980 --> 03:02:40.660]  all that stuff. Because if they question anything, they lose that access, which is the kiss of
[03:02:40.660 --> 03:02:47.100]  death. It is the kiss of death. Uh, when we come back, I want to get into the war. We're
[03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:53.940]  now almost seven years into Iraq, or we are seven years in now in March, uh, last month.
[03:02:53.940 --> 03:02:59.020]  This was the seventh anniversary. We're eight years into Afghanistan. Uh, and there's just
[03:02:59.020 --> 03:03:03.180]  no end in sight. Uh, I mean, when is it going to end? Well, first thing I'd like to ask
[03:03:03.180 --> 03:03:11.380]  you, Alex, is what the hell are we accomplishing? A bunch of weapons sales and oil. You know,
[03:03:11.380 --> 03:03:17.700]  that's the, that's the bottom line for me. And maybe I say this selfishly, but how is
[03:03:17.700 --> 03:03:24.780]  these two wars helped Jesse Ventura or how are these two wars helped Alex Jones or how
[03:03:24.780 --> 03:03:30.500]  are these two wars helped the average Joe citizen of this country other than bankrupting
[03:03:30.500 --> 03:03:36.780]  us? What is the ultimate goal that we will achieve to where we can all feel good about
[03:03:36.780 --> 03:03:42.900]  them? Absolutely. I mean, if our country was invaded, that'd be one thing. Or even if we
[03:03:42.900 --> 03:03:47.940]  were an evil empire and the empire gave us some of the booty, but no, we pay for it for
[03:03:47.940 --> 03:03:53.820]  offshore corporations that get them the money in power. Exactly. And we're sitting here.
[03:03:53.820 --> 03:03:59.540]  Our kids are dying over there. Well, you know what it clearly shows me, Alex? People should
[03:03:59.540 --> 03:04:05.780]  really wake up to the fact that the president date in charge. That's a good point because
[03:04:05.780 --> 03:04:13.900]  clearly, Obama ran to get us out of the wars. He said he closed down Gitmo. He said all
[03:04:13.900 --> 03:04:21.020]  of this stuff and yet it's all gone the opposite way, hasn't it? It has. We're more into the
[03:04:21.020 --> 03:04:27.420]  wars. Gitmo's still here. So people should see clearly that the president is no longer
[03:04:27.420 --> 03:04:35.620]  in charge of the country. And then the next question is, what do we do to reverse that?
[03:04:35.620 --> 03:04:39.300]  And I've documented that the government's provocaturing militias and other groups to
[03:04:39.300 --> 03:04:44.580]  demonize the tea parties in any opposition to that. We'll talk about it all with former
[03:04:44.580 --> 03:04:49.540]  Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, his new book, a bestseller. Let's send it to number
[03:04:49.540 --> 03:04:55.300]  one on the New York Times bestseller list. It's in news stores everywhere. It's in airports.

[03:08:15.220 --> 03:08:21.100]  Well his television show got picked up for second season record first season on True
[03:08:21.100 --> 03:08:25.540]  TV their number one new show. And we're going to talk about, because I keep getting these
[03:08:25.540 --> 03:08:30.500]  questions and oh Jesse's wondering, with all this censorship, with all this control, not
[03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:36.060]  one major news book reviewer. We'll talk about his number four on the New York Times best
[03:08:36.060 --> 03:08:43.260]  seller list, American conspiracies, four weeks in the top ten. So why is that being censored?
[03:08:43.260 --> 03:08:47.740]  Why do I get censored? But why is he allowed to have a TV show? We'll talk about that some
[03:08:47.740 --> 03:08:52.140]  coming up today. We'll talk about opium trafficking. We'll get into a whole host of issues. Pat
[03:08:52.140 --> 03:08:56.220]  Tillman, you name it. But Governor Jesse Ventura, for those that just joined us, we started
[03:08:56.220 --> 03:09:02.140]  getting into eight years of Iraq, or seven years of Iraq, eight years of Afghanistan,
[03:09:02.140 --> 03:09:08.260]  no end in sight, new wars, they're expanding, all this footage coming out of reporters being
[03:09:08.260 --> 03:09:13.940]  massacred, being targeted, children being gunned down by Apache helicopters, premeditatedly,
[03:09:13.940 --> 03:09:19.180]  all of that happening. And we were discussing during the break that this points out that
[03:09:19.180 --> 03:09:23.140]  the president isn't really the president, and doesn't have the power. Let's break it
[03:09:23.140 --> 03:09:24.140]  down.
[03:09:24.140 --> 03:09:29.180]  Well, I really don't think he does. And what's really educated me, Alex, is I've been reading,
[03:09:29.180 --> 03:09:34.180]  I've read, I'm in the process of finishing my second book by Colonel Fletcher Prowdy.
[03:09:34.180 --> 03:09:41.180]  And I highly recommend both that people need to read the Colonel's book. He died in 2001
[03:09:41.180 --> 03:09:47.340]  in June. But if you read Fletcher Prowdy's books, one of them's called The Secret Team,
[03:09:47.340 --> 03:09:53.620]  the other one is called JFK. And if you read those two books, it will become very clear
[03:09:53.620 --> 03:09:58.740]  that the history you've been taught is not the history of what's happened. And let me
[03:09:58.740 --> 03:10:04.940]  make my point here for a moment. Prowdy was there. Who Fletcher Prowdy was? Do you remember
[03:10:04.940 --> 03:10:07.860]  the movie JFK by Oliver Stone, of course?
[03:10:07.860 --> 03:10:08.860]  Yes.
[03:10:08.860 --> 03:10:15.980]  He is the Donald Sutherland character. He is the real life Mr. X, the guy that Costner
[03:10:15.980 --> 03:10:21.060]  Ghosters Washington, and talks to him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and they sit
[03:10:21.060 --> 03:10:26.700]  on that bench, and he lays the whole thing out. Well, in real life, that was Colonel
[03:10:26.700 --> 03:10:32.100]  Lee Roy Fletcher Prowdy, Colonel of the United States Air Force. And for, I think, 11 or
[03:10:32.100 --> 03:10:41.660]  12 years, he was the top man, the liaison between the Pentagon and the CIA. And I can't
[03:10:41.660 --> 03:10:46.940]  tell people how much they need to read to understand, and when you read Prowdy's books,
[03:10:46.940 --> 03:10:52.660]  you will become much more clear on what's happening, because Prowdy tells you in the
[03:10:52.660 --> 03:11:00.180]  books that the entire Cold War was a setup, that there was a meeting that took place at
[03:11:00.180 --> 03:11:06.580]  the end of World War II, right before we technically were going to invade Japan like
[03:11:06.580 --> 03:11:11.580]  Normandy. And then, of course, they dropped the two bombs, and they didn't have to. But
[03:11:11.580 --> 03:11:19.420]  in preparing for that invasion, they moved massive armaments into Okinawa. Well, there
[03:11:19.420 --> 03:11:25.340]  was a meeting, because Prowdy flew in Shanghai Shack, and it was between Shanghai Shack, who
[03:11:25.340 --> 03:11:31.460]  at that time was ahead of China, Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt. And at that point, it was
[03:11:31.460 --> 03:11:36.940]  determined that all wars from then on would be fought in third world countries, that there
[03:11:36.940 --> 03:11:43.620]  would be no direct objective that the military could achieve in which to declare victory.
[03:11:43.620 --> 03:11:49.020]  Now look back, Alex, in our history since World War II. Is that not all true?
[03:11:49.020 --> 03:11:50.020]  That is.
[03:11:50.020 --> 03:11:55.740]  It's all true. That's what really resonated with me when I read Prowdy's books. I went,
[03:11:55.740 --> 03:12:01.300]  oh my God, the things he said here is exactly what has gone down.
[03:12:01.300 --> 03:12:09.220]  Well, let me be clear. Oh, and remember the armaments that I told you they put in Okinawa?
[03:12:09.220 --> 03:12:10.220]  Yes.
[03:12:10.220 --> 03:12:11.220]  You know what became of those?
[03:12:11.220 --> 03:12:12.220]  No.
[03:12:12.220 --> 03:12:17.700]  They were split in half, half of them according to Colonel Prowdy, half of them went to Korea,
[03:12:17.700 --> 03:12:24.540]  and half of it went to Ho Chi Minh. They were setting up for the next two wars.
[03:12:24.540 --> 03:12:25.540]  Well, Governor.
[03:12:25.540 --> 03:12:30.260]  Now this follows through with all of this shit, and excuse me from the radio, I shouldn't
[03:12:30.260 --> 03:12:36.660]  have said that, but all of this stuff in Afghanistan, Iraq, and all of it fits right into what
[03:12:36.660 --> 03:12:38.940]  Colonel Prowdy talked about.
[03:12:38.940 --> 03:12:42.140]  Well I'm chomping at the bit here, and I want to sit back and shut up, and you can tell
[03:12:42.140 --> 03:12:46.300]  us what you've learned. But this is what's so incredible. I've known you for about four
[03:12:46.300 --> 03:12:51.100]  and a half years now, and the process. You knew about Gulf of Tonkin. You knew about
[03:12:51.100 --> 03:12:55.820]  the lives of Vietnam. You were very well informed. You've been visited by the CIA when you were
[03:12:55.820 --> 03:13:01.580]  governor, but it's been a process of you reading and researching, and now to see you, I interviewed
[03:13:01.580 --> 03:13:06.860]  Prowdy, had to be like in 1997. We've been digging around, looking for the tapes, and
[03:13:06.860 --> 03:13:11.420]  I have read over his work. I've read his first book, not the second one you're talking about,
[03:13:11.420 --> 03:13:16.220]  and then you discover that Joe McCarthy was actually right, but he was being used to set
[03:13:16.220 --> 03:13:21.620]  up a police state domestically with low-level communists, but as soon as he found out the
[03:13:21.620 --> 03:13:26.140]  Pentagon was running everything, remember, that was what they said was so absurd, then
[03:13:26.140 --> 03:13:30.940]  they set him up and destroyed him, and used the term McCarthyism to demonize him, but
[03:13:30.940 --> 03:13:35.020]  then it was declassified seven years ago, or six years ago, that the Russians said,
[03:13:35.020 --> 03:13:39.460]  no, it's true, he was right, and then you learn that the whole geopolitical system is
[03:13:39.460 --> 03:13:43.900]  a war against individual populations, and there was a deal with the Russians to build
[03:13:43.900 --> 03:13:48.140]  up their police state. They would take over half the world. The U.S. would build up its
[03:13:48.140 --> 03:13:52.380]  police state military system, and take over its other half, and go into these black hole
[03:13:52.380 --> 03:13:58.420]  wars to then militarize a cadre of men to come back and take over the domestic country
[03:13:58.420 --> 03:14:01.820]  itself, and now you're researching that, Governor, it's so exciting.
[03:14:01.820 --> 03:14:08.860]  Well, you know, the thing is now, is this, Alex, I have the time to do it now. You know,
[03:14:08.860 --> 03:14:13.660]  when you're being a governor, you're governing the state, or you're working in that capacity,
[03:14:13.660 --> 03:14:19.300]  you don't have time to do any research, because your day is full, 24 hours a day, seven days
[03:14:19.300 --> 03:14:26.780]  a week, just doing your job, and now I don't have that job to do anymore, and living in
[03:14:26.780 --> 03:14:33.300]  Mexico like I do for half the year, I read 15 to 17 books every winter down there, and
[03:14:33.300 --> 03:14:38.300]  it's amazing how reading can educate you, something I think we're losing track of in
[03:14:38.300 --> 03:14:39.300]  this country.
[03:14:39.300 --> 03:14:43.700]  Well, I want to be specific, it's amazing to see your development, and I'm not like
[03:14:43.700 --> 03:14:48.860]  on some mountain saying that, because I've noticed your discernment with issues getting
[03:14:48.860 --> 03:14:53.100]  into the whole conspiracy realm, you go right to the best sources, the best documents, the
[03:14:53.100 --> 03:14:59.620]  best history, and it's just very exciting, Governor Ventura, to see you with a hit TV
[03:14:59.620 --> 03:15:04.220]  show, a bestselling book, and to really be one of the main leaders now of questioning
[03:15:04.220 --> 03:15:08.420]  our reality, but I don't want to interrupt, go back, give people the name of the book
[03:15:08.420 --> 03:15:12.620]  again, because I want to go buy it and read it, Fletcher Proudy on record the head of
[03:15:12.620 --> 03:15:20.820]  Black Ops between the Pentagon and CIA, he was sent away, you know, to the Arctic, when
[03:15:20.820 --> 03:15:25.820]  they killed JFK, he talked about how they pulled the security off, how it was a Pentagon,
[03:15:25.820 --> 03:15:30.020]  Black Ops job, we're going to play a clip from JFK coming up later, but take your time
[03:15:30.020 --> 03:15:34.100]  into break with more of what you've learned and how you tie that in to all your other
[03:15:34.100 --> 03:15:35.100]  life knowledge.
[03:15:35.100 --> 03:15:41.980]  Well, again, it's a case that, you know, Fletcher Proudy just, he lived through it,
[03:15:41.980 --> 03:15:47.660]  and I enjoy reading what he knows about, and he's an exceptionally bright guy.
[03:15:47.660 --> 03:15:53.900]  See, the other thing he shows very clearly, which tells you how Obama isn't really in
[03:15:53.900 --> 03:16:00.780]  charge, Proudy shows you that most of the politicians only learn of these events until
[03:16:00.780 --> 03:16:08.700]  they're already in motion, they're set in motion by people in the government, you know,
[03:16:08.700 --> 03:16:14.100]  people in the CIA at lower, you know, not the high level positions, but in their secondary
[03:16:14.100 --> 03:16:19.900]  positions, they're the ones that move forward on all this stuff, the wars, every, all the
[03:16:19.900 --> 03:16:25.540]  dirty stuff that goes on, so that by the time our elected politicians are briefed on it,
[03:16:25.540 --> 03:16:31.980]  this thing's already halfway to life, it's already happening, so they really, our politicians
[03:16:31.980 --> 03:16:38.900]  are playing catch up, and that's who Proudy explains in that book, The Secret Team.
[03:16:38.900 --> 03:16:41.700]  That's who The Secret Team is.
[03:16:41.700 --> 03:16:46.780]  The Secret Team are these right underleveled government people who are literally running
[03:16:46.780 --> 03:16:53.460]  amok, and there's nobody in control of them, and, you know, the CIA has its own money now
[03:16:53.460 --> 03:16:59.780]  and own money sources, so they can basically do anything they want, and our president and
[03:16:59.780 --> 03:17:02.140]  the rest of them seem to be powerless to them.
[03:17:02.140 --> 03:17:06.180]  Well, that's what Ron Paul said two months ago in a speech, in fact, we'll cue that up,
[03:17:06.180 --> 03:17:10.300]  it's about 20 seconds, he said we've had a CIA coup since the 60s, they're bringing
[03:17:10.300 --> 03:17:15.100]  in the drugs, we have a shadow government, and my whole point is we have to come to the
[03:17:15.100 --> 03:17:21.220]  point as a nation to realize presidents come and go, but the Secret Teams run by the big
[03:17:21.220 --> 03:17:27.060]  Wall Street banks that set up the CIA, rule this country, and by extension, the world.
[03:17:27.060 --> 03:17:29.180]  Yeah, pretty much.
[03:17:29.180 --> 03:17:30.180]  Man.
[03:17:30.180 --> 03:17:37.860]  That's the information that I'm arriving at, it's not a nice arrival, but you know, what
[03:17:37.860 --> 03:17:38.860]  can we do?
[03:17:38.860 --> 03:17:45.340]  Well, I've been harping on it for about 12 years, Alex, you can start by stop voting
[03:17:45.340 --> 03:17:48.100]  for Democrats and Republicans.
[03:17:48.100 --> 03:17:55.100]  I don't care who you vote for, don't vote for them, they're the problem, they're not
[03:17:55.100 --> 03:17:56.100]  the solution.
[03:17:56.100 --> 03:17:59.660]  And that's, you know, really it gets to that, then of course you have to question, is the
[03:17:59.660 --> 03:18:00.660]  voting real?
[03:18:00.660 --> 03:18:06.180]  Because with these electronic voting machines, they can be hacked into, so you've got a question
[03:18:06.180 --> 03:18:11.100]  whether your votes are actually legitimate even in this country anymore.
[03:18:11.100 --> 03:18:17.500]  Exactly, let me back you up, what you just said, you take Gulf of Tonkin, I sat through
[03:18:17.500 --> 03:18:24.060]  many hours of LBJ at his ranch outside Austin, Johnson City a couple miles from where I sit,
[03:18:24.060 --> 03:18:28.780]  and McNamara, and McNamara is telling him what to do, and telling him they just staged
[03:18:28.780 --> 03:18:33.020]  the Gulf of Tonkin, and that this is what he's going to say at a press conference tomorrow,
[03:18:33.020 --> 03:18:37.300]  and the president's almost saying yes sir to him, and it's the same thing with Bay of
[03:18:37.300 --> 03:18:41.940]  Pigs, they launched that without Kennedy knowing, and then blamed it on him when it failed.
[03:18:41.940 --> 03:18:45.380]  Exactly, and you've got to understand too, it ain't McNamara.
[03:18:45.380 --> 03:18:50.980]  McNamara is being briefed too, he probably only learned about it the week ahead of LBJ.
[03:18:50.980 --> 03:18:56.700]  No, no, that's on the tape, he's saying exactly, he says these tapes are incredible, he's saying
[03:18:56.700 --> 03:18:59.660]  the Pentagon did this, this is what you're going to say.
[03:18:59.660 --> 03:19:05.380]  Yep, and see he's been briefed, see what you're proud of is that the chief are these
[03:19:05.380 --> 03:19:13.100]  briefer guys, these guys that the Pentagon has and the CIA have who do the briefings
[03:19:13.100 --> 03:19:19.700]  of the politicians, they're the ones who sell the politician on the policy, and it comes
[03:19:19.700 --> 03:19:20.700]  from them.
[03:19:20.700 --> 03:19:24.880]  You ought to interview Ray McGovern, he was a top CIA briefer to Reagan, and Bush the
[03:19:24.880 --> 03:19:27.180]  first, and he agrees with everything you're saying.
[03:19:27.180 --> 03:19:32.460]  Yeah, well that's what Fletcher Proudy said, and I haven't found a thing he's been wrong
[03:19:32.460 --> 03:19:33.460]  with yet.
[03:19:33.460 --> 03:19:40.460]  No, it's all accurate, incredible, Jesse Ventura, always wise, always informed, but just to
[03:19:40.460 --> 03:19:47.140]  know that he is really on the fast track to the key to planetary control, it's all staged.
[03:19:47.140 --> 03:19:51.100]  In the past it was, there is a split between Russia now it appears, but in the past all
[03:19:51.100 --> 03:19:58.740]  rigged two empires carving up the world, we'll be right back with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[03:19:58.740 --> 03:20:04.220]  Don't answer it.
[03:20:04.220 --> 03:20:08.180]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings knowing it may be another bill collector,
[03:20:08.180 --> 03:20:14.980]  it's time for you to call 0-DET in 90 days, 800-477-9256, settlements, bankruptcy and

[03:20:20.100 --> 03:20:23.860]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment
[03:20:23.860 --> 03:20:24.860]  plan?

[03:22:10.500 --> 03:22:12.900]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:12.900 --> 03:22:17.460]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[03:22:17.460 --> 03:22:18.700]  on earth.
[03:22:18.700 --> 03:22:23.500]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[03:22:23.500 --> 03:22:25.340]  expanded nationwide.
[03:22:25.340 --> 03:22:29.340]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an
[03:22:29.340 --> 03:22:31.380]  old powerful shadow state.
[03:22:31.380 --> 03:22:35.860]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

[03:22:45.980 --> 03:22:49.220]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:22:49.220 --> 03:22:51.260]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:22:51.260 --> 03:22:52.260]  It's here.

[03:23:00.260 --> 03:23:05.060]  Jim Newcomer from ITUS Resources, April 6, 2010, gold opened this morning at 11.2770.
[03:23:05.060 --> 03:23:12.340]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for 11.5841, 5.7921 for a half ounce, or 289.60
[03:23:12.340 --> 03:23:13.340]  for the quarter ounce.
[03:23:13.340 --> 03:23:17.660]  That's 11.5841, 5.7921, and 289.60.
[03:23:17.660 --> 03:23:21.700]  We have always believed our country was about expanding opportunity for Americans.
[03:23:21.700 --> 03:23:25.420]  With the passage of the sweeping healthcare reform, working middle class Americans are
[03:23:25.420 --> 03:23:27.060]  getting the short end of this stick.
[03:23:27.060 --> 03:23:30.700]  The healthcare mandate will require almost every American to be insured, or else pay
[03:23:30.700 --> 03:23:31.700]  a fine.
[03:23:31.700 --> 03:23:35.540]  This means less control over your finances, take back control by treading in precious
[03:23:35.540 --> 03:23:36.540]  metals.
[03:23:36.540 --> 03:23:40.060]  Gold and silver have always been and continues to be the leading way to protect against our
[03:23:40.060 --> 03:23:41.620]  weakening markets.

[03:24:10.620 --> 03:24:14.260]  I wish people could hear our behind the scenes discussions.
[03:24:14.260 --> 03:24:16.540]  Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[03:24:16.540 --> 03:24:21.740]  Jesse, you're always a serious guy, but lately you have really seemed happy.
[03:24:21.740 --> 03:24:22.740]  Why are you so happy?
[03:24:22.740 --> 03:24:26.380]  Uh, Mexico does that to me, Alex.
[03:24:26.380 --> 03:24:30.620]  When I get down there, you know, I spent Friday and Saturday, the waves were great.
[03:24:30.620 --> 03:24:34.620]  They were running about three, three and a half feet, and they were coming in perfect
[03:24:34.620 --> 03:24:35.620]  for surfing.
[03:24:35.620 --> 03:24:41.860]  So I had two great days of surfing down there, and whenever I can live that lifestyle, I
[03:24:41.860 --> 03:24:45.180]  get very content and very pleased with the world.
[03:24:45.180 --> 03:24:46.900]  I hear you.
[03:24:46.900 --> 03:24:49.820]  And first you have the tsunami, and then the earthquake, but no problems.
[03:24:49.820 --> 03:24:52.100]  No, I didn't even feel the earthquake.
[03:24:52.100 --> 03:24:56.260]  The earthquake happened way up by Mexicali, which is right on the border of Mexico and
[03:24:56.260 --> 03:24:57.260]  California.
[03:24:57.260 --> 03:25:00.620]  Oh, I do want to, here's one thing when we talk that, Alex, that I want to put word
[03:25:00.620 --> 03:25:02.140]  out to people on.
[03:25:02.140 --> 03:25:04.620]  Please allow me to do it here.
[03:25:04.620 --> 03:25:09.420]  Everyone out there that knows anyone in the state of California, please encourage them
[03:25:09.420 --> 03:25:14.540]  this far to vote for the legalization of marijuana.
[03:25:14.540 --> 03:25:18.740]  It's going to be on the ballot in California, full legalization to where marijuana would
[03:25:18.740 --> 03:25:21.340]  be treated like alcohol and tobacco.
[03:25:21.340 --> 03:25:26.500]  And the reason I'm pleading with people to support this is to stop the carnage at the
[03:25:26.500 --> 03:25:27.500]  border.
[03:25:27.500 --> 03:25:33.820]  Alex, it's awful, 17,000 people have died on the Mexican U.S. border just in the last
[03:25:33.820 --> 03:25:34.820]  year.
[03:25:34.820 --> 03:25:35.820]  I know.
[03:25:35.820 --> 03:25:36.820]  It's a war zone.
[03:25:36.820 --> 03:25:38.380]  It's a war zone, and we can end it.
[03:25:38.380 --> 03:25:43.580]  We can end it by simply legalizing it, because that puts the cartels out of business.
[03:25:43.580 --> 03:25:45.260]  They have nothing to sell then.
[03:25:45.260 --> 03:25:46.500]  But that's common sense.
[03:25:46.500 --> 03:25:49.300]  All these fake conservatives say, that's of the devil.
[03:25:49.300 --> 03:25:53.940]  Meanwhile, the CIA wants to keep all the drugs illegal, so they have an excuse to put people
[03:25:53.940 --> 03:25:56.140]  in prison and so they can launder the money.
[03:25:56.140 --> 03:25:57.140]  Exactly.
[03:25:57.140 --> 03:25:58.140]  But see, we've got it.
[03:25:58.140 --> 03:26:02.980]  Here's a chance where we've got it in the palm of our hand, Alex, if the elections legitimate
[03:26:02.980 --> 03:26:09.460]  out in California, the people out there can vote for the first step, full legalization
[03:26:09.460 --> 03:26:10.460]  of marijuana.
[03:26:10.460 --> 03:26:16.460]  And I think if you see California do it, it'll go like wildfire right across the country.
[03:26:16.460 --> 03:26:17.460]  Absolutely.
[03:26:17.460 --> 03:26:19.540]  So you heard it here, folks.
[03:26:19.540 --> 03:26:24.140]  Vote for the decriminalization, legalization of marijuana in California.
[03:26:24.140 --> 03:26:28.980]  Here's a Reuters article, NATO rejects Russian call for Afghan poppy spraying.
[03:26:28.980 --> 03:26:33.700]  NATO Wednesday rejected Russian calls for it to eradicate opium poppy fields in Afghanistan,
[03:26:33.700 --> 03:26:38.500]  saying the best way for Moscow to help control the drug would be to give more assistance
[03:26:38.500 --> 03:26:39.500]  against the insurgency.
[03:26:39.500 --> 03:26:44.900]  Then I was listening to BBC a few months ago, and they were admitting that the U.S. protects
[03:26:44.900 --> 03:26:49.980]  the opium to be friends with the locals, and it's up more than 12 times what it was nine
[03:26:49.980 --> 03:26:53.540]  years ago, and there's opium flooding the world right now.
[03:26:53.540 --> 03:26:57.260]  What's your take on government drug dealing and that they're openly protecting the poppy
[03:26:57.260 --> 03:26:58.260]  fields?
[03:26:58.260 --> 03:27:01.020]  Well, you know, look at it this way, Alex.
[03:27:01.020 --> 03:27:05.140]  The major banks, the international banks of the world, where do you think all that money
[03:27:05.140 --> 03:27:12.020]  gets, there's millions and billions of dollars for the heroin trade gets laundered through.
[03:27:12.020 --> 03:27:14.020]  And look at the timing of it.
[03:27:14.020 --> 03:27:19.180]  The Wall Street crash happened right at the time the Taliban put the poppy growers out
[03:27:19.180 --> 03:27:20.180]  of business.
[03:27:20.180 --> 03:27:21.180]  Yep.
[03:27:21.180 --> 03:27:25.180]  Because all of it, and there may be a correlation there.
[03:27:25.180 --> 03:27:27.180]  You're talking about 2000, 2001.
[03:27:27.180 --> 03:27:32.220]  They laundered money, these billions of dollars of laundered drug money, and that could very
[03:27:32.220 --> 03:27:35.540]  well have hurt the cash flow of these banks.
[03:27:35.540 --> 03:27:39.740]  And that very well could have been, I'm not saying it's the full thing, but it certainly
[03:27:39.740 --> 03:27:46.460]  could have been part of the catalyst that made the Wall Street crash happen in 08.
[03:27:46.460 --> 03:27:51.220]  Well there's also the fact that the Taliban was cutting it off in 2000, 2001, and you
[03:27:51.220 --> 03:27:53.220]  had the crash in 2001.
[03:27:53.220 --> 03:27:54.220]  Yep.
[03:27:54.220 --> 03:28:02.180]  Notice how every time the drugs get cut off, it seems Wall Street crash is shortly thereafter.
[03:28:02.180 --> 03:28:05.980]  Well you're right on that front again, but how can they just be in Reuters saying, we're
[03:28:05.980 --> 03:28:08.060]  not going to eradicate any poppy fields?
[03:28:08.060 --> 03:28:10.780]  I mean, how obvious is that?
[03:28:10.780 --> 03:28:15.580]  Well, it's the old thing of the way we fight the worst today.
[03:28:15.580 --> 03:28:21.060]  You know, sometimes the people you get in bed with are worse than the people you're
[03:28:21.060 --> 03:28:22.060]  fighting.
[03:28:22.060 --> 03:28:23.060]  You're absolutely right.
[03:28:23.060 --> 03:28:26.580]  You know, Governor, Jesse Ventura, I have a lot of questions that I want to ask here
[03:28:26.580 --> 03:28:31.260]  in my list, but going out to break on this short segment, what else do you want to relate
[03:28:31.260 --> 03:28:33.060]  to this audience that you think is important?
[03:28:33.060 --> 03:28:39.700]  Well, again, just to be vigilant and pay attention and to question your government at all times,
[03:28:39.700 --> 03:28:41.980]  because it needs to be questioned.
[03:28:41.980 --> 03:28:48.180]  Right now, like I said, it should be clear to everyone that Barack Obama is not in charge.
[03:28:48.180 --> 03:28:53.700]  I don't believe that he is now, because you see everything that he ran on, he hasn't come
[03:28:53.700 --> 03:28:55.140]  through on virtually anything.
[03:28:55.140 --> 03:29:00.260]  He's now on the opposite camp, really, and it's almost like he arrived there with this
[03:29:00.260 --> 03:29:05.700]  fresh, clean agenda, and it was like they took him to the woodshed and told him, well,
[03:29:05.700 --> 03:29:09.100]  you might be the president, but you don't run things.
[03:29:09.100 --> 03:29:14.540]  Well, certainly, plus they financed him, they financed McCain, no matter who gets in, they
[03:29:14.540 --> 03:29:15.540]  control him.
[03:29:15.540 --> 03:29:16.540]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[03:29:16.540 --> 03:29:23.620]  You know, you look at Obama's biggest contributor was Goldman Sachs, and they're the ones that
[03:29:23.620 --> 03:29:28.380]  what is it, the last five or six Department of Treasury secretaries have all come out
[03:29:28.380 --> 03:29:29.380]  of there.
[03:29:29.380 --> 03:29:30.380]  Absolutely.
[03:29:30.380 --> 03:29:33.980]  And then you look at Chile, Iceland.
[03:29:33.980 --> 03:29:35.820]  You look at Greece.
[03:29:35.820 --> 03:29:40.780]  You look at all these countries, First World, Second World, they're all run by Goldman
[03:29:40.780 --> 03:29:41.780]  Sachs people.
[03:29:41.780 --> 03:29:43.340]  That's the key heart to this group.
[03:29:43.340 --> 03:29:47.180]  A ton of questions straight ahead for Governor Jesse Ventura.
[03:29:47.180 --> 03:29:48.460]  The book is a bestseller.
[03:29:48.460 --> 03:29:51.940]  Get it at infowars.com and get your choice of a free film.
[03:29:51.940 --> 03:29:53.220]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.220 --> 03:29:55.620]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.620 --> 03:30:01.860]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.860 --> 03:30:04.860]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:30:04.860 --> 03:30:09.180]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[03:30:09.180 --> 03:30:10.180]  do you want?
[03:30:10.180 --> 03:30:15.740]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[03:30:15.740 --> 03:30:17.220]  Food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:17.220 --> 03:30:18.460]  How much do you want?
[03:30:18.460 --> 03:30:21.460]  When do you want it now or after the battle starts?
[03:30:21.460 --> 03:30:22.620]  When will you need it?
[03:30:22.620 --> 03:30:24.740]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:30:24.740 --> 03:30:26.140]  Will there be any food?
[03:30:26.140 --> 03:30:27.580]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:27.580 --> 03:30:31.700]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[03:30:31.700 --> 03:30:32.900]  and be immunized?
[03:30:32.900 --> 03:30:36.660]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:36.660 --> 03:30:40.260]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:30:40.260 --> 03:30:41.500]  How much will you need?
[03:30:41.500 --> 03:30:42.500]  We don't know.
[03:30:42.500 --> 03:30:43.500]  How much do you want?
[03:30:43.500 --> 03:30:44.500]  All you can get.
[03:30:44.500 --> 03:30:45.500]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:45.500 --> 03:30:48.660]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:30:48.660 --> 03:30:54.700]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoods.org.
[03:30:54.700 --> 03:31:01.940]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:31:01.940 --> 03:31:04.340]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:31:04.340 --> 03:31:09.900]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[03:31:09.900 --> 03:31:14.020]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[03:31:14.020 --> 03:31:15.020]  documents.
[03:31:15.020 --> 03:31:19.460]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:19.460 --> 03:31:21.940]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:21.940 --> 03:31:24.700]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:24.700 --> 03:31:28.020]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:28.020 --> 03:31:32.940]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:31:32.940 --> 03:31:35.460]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:35.460 --> 03:31:39.580]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for
[03:31:39.580 --> 03:31:41.260]  the global financial system.
[03:31:41.260 --> 03:31:43.820]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:43.820 --> 03:31:47.540]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:47.540 --> 03:31:48.700]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:48.700 --> 03:31:50.340]  You're everyone else.
[03:31:50.340 --> 03:31:51.340]  Invisible Empire.

[03:33:09.220 --> 03:33:11.260]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:33:11.260 --> 03:33:18.420]  Tuesday, the sixth day of April, 2010, Governor Jesse Ventura, an icon of true political
[03:33:18.420 --> 03:33:22.300]  independence in this country and worldwide is our guest, and I'm really honored to have
[03:33:22.300 --> 03:33:24.140]  him and honored to count him as a friend.
[03:33:24.140 --> 03:33:25.140]  He's a great guy.
[03:33:25.140 --> 03:33:26.140]  He's for real.
[03:33:26.140 --> 03:33:29.020]  And I want to get into how did he get his TV show on air.
[03:33:29.020 --> 03:33:33.300]  We talked about this last time and he marveled, but now we see the censorship of his book,
[03:33:33.300 --> 03:33:36.860]  no book reviews, even though it's number four on the New York Times bestseller list.
[03:33:36.860 --> 03:33:37.860]  How did that happen?
[03:33:37.860 --> 03:33:39.180]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[03:33:39.180 --> 03:33:43.860]  But first, Governor, I got an email from a lady saying, effective immediately.
[03:33:43.860 --> 03:33:48.380]  She's never listening to my radio show again because I played the gun pod footage from
[03:33:48.380 --> 03:33:54.460]  the Apaches, killing these reporters, shooting these kids, laughing about it, and then lying
[03:33:54.460 --> 03:33:55.540]  about it later.
[03:33:55.540 --> 03:34:00.140]  All these other massacre videos, here's the New York Times today, U.S. forces horrifying
[03:34:00.140 --> 03:34:01.660]  Afghanistan coverup.
[03:34:01.660 --> 03:34:05.940]  Obviously, we're not saying the individual troops are all bad, but Pat Tillman went
[03:34:05.940 --> 03:34:09.100]  over there, found that it was a fraud, wrote letters home.
[03:34:09.100 --> 03:34:10.100]  That's a show you should do.
[03:34:10.100 --> 03:34:11.220]  I talked to some of his family.
[03:34:11.220 --> 03:34:12.220]  They wouldn't come on air.
[03:34:12.220 --> 03:34:13.220]  They believe it was a hit.
[03:34:13.220 --> 03:34:14.220]  The evidence came out.
[03:34:14.220 --> 03:34:15.500]  They did cover up the friendly fire.
[03:34:15.500 --> 03:34:18.940]  They killed him up at point blank range, three shots in the head.
[03:34:18.940 --> 03:34:24.820]  I mean, as Fletcher Pouty wrote, and he ran black ops, we propped up the Soviets.
[03:34:24.820 --> 03:34:25.820]  We set it all up.
[03:34:25.820 --> 03:34:26.820]  It's staged.
[03:34:26.820 --> 03:34:28.860]  It's eating our entire system.
[03:34:28.860 --> 03:34:32.580]  Is it unpatriotic to criticize corrupt illegal wars?
[03:34:32.580 --> 03:34:34.580]  No, it's not.
[03:34:34.580 --> 03:34:36.580]  You know, we went through this in Vietnam.
[03:34:36.580 --> 03:34:40.860]  I would think that this country would have a little bit longer memory.
[03:34:40.860 --> 03:34:46.620]  It was the same type of affair took place in Vietnam where you had the massacre at
[03:34:46.620 --> 03:34:47.620]  Mili.
[03:34:47.620 --> 03:34:51.980]  You know, people, and believe me, I'm not blaming the soldiers.
[03:34:51.980 --> 03:34:57.260]  I'm blaming the politicians, because it's ultimately their fault.
[03:34:57.260 --> 03:35:04.700]  You know, war is the result of failed policy, failed politics, and the end result is war.
[03:35:04.700 --> 03:35:09.580]  And so when your politicians fail you, you go to war.
[03:35:09.580 --> 03:35:15.140]  And because of their failure, they put our young men and women into these wars.
[03:35:15.140 --> 03:35:20.780]  Well, what they did, of course, what they did is not good, but let's remember something.
[03:35:20.780 --> 03:35:25.580]  Some of these guys are on their fifth, sixth, and seventh tour over there.
[03:35:25.580 --> 03:35:27.580]  They've been hardened now.
[03:35:27.580 --> 03:35:28.580]  They've been changed.
[03:35:28.580 --> 03:35:31.300]  They are not the same people that left.
[03:35:31.300 --> 03:35:33.300]  Trust me on that.
[03:35:33.300 --> 03:35:37.580]  And so war, there is nothing great and glorious about war.
[03:35:37.580 --> 03:35:44.940]  War is the worst thing man's ever come up with, and that's killing each other over what?
[03:35:44.940 --> 03:35:51.100]  Political reasons, religion, whatever stupidity we might decide to go to war and murder each
[03:35:51.100 --> 03:35:52.100]  other over.
[03:35:52.100 --> 03:35:59.180]  And so no, you are not wrong in showing this, because what's wrong is sheltering people
[03:35:59.180 --> 03:36:00.180]  from it.
[03:36:00.180 --> 03:36:05.980]  That's why these wars are going on, Alex, is because the American people have been sheltered.
[03:36:05.980 --> 03:36:10.420]  The media is not portraying what's happening over there, and they're not even showing the
[03:36:10.420 --> 03:36:13.060]  body bags when they come home.
[03:36:13.060 --> 03:36:15.940]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[03:36:15.940 --> 03:36:20.180]  And you talked about Fletcher Proudy, who ran Black Ops in the Pentagon.
[03:36:20.180 --> 03:36:23.540]  That's on record, the liaison to the CIA.
[03:36:23.540 --> 03:36:27.740]  And he's documenting how they made the decision at the end of World War II to attack third
[03:36:27.740 --> 03:36:31.420]  world countries, to divide them, to never have an outcome.
[03:36:31.420 --> 03:36:35.460]  So the armaments industries could make a lot of money and get a lot of power.
[03:36:35.460 --> 03:36:39.320]  And then we sit here and say that's exactly what Afghanistan and Iraq are.
[03:36:39.320 --> 03:36:42.100]  We know this is the policy of divide and conquer.
[03:36:42.100 --> 03:36:46.340]  We know they're turning our country into a militarized surveillance police state, and
[03:36:46.340 --> 03:36:50.780]  it's our right as citizens to say that we don't want to be part of these illegal wars
[03:36:50.780 --> 03:36:55.340]  that George Washington said that we shouldn't be involved in foreign wars.
[03:36:55.340 --> 03:37:00.820]  Well, again, I guess sometimes a war is justified.
[03:37:00.820 --> 03:37:06.380]  You know, there are occasions where a war, you've got to go fight because there may be
[03:37:06.380 --> 03:37:11.900]  a tyrant like Adolf Hitler out there, and that type of situation.
[03:37:11.900 --> 03:37:18.660]  But ever since World War II, you cannot tell me one war that has been justified.
[03:37:18.660 --> 03:37:23.460]  But you talked about it being a failed policy, failed from our perspective, but we know they're
[03:37:23.460 --> 03:37:28.180]  premeditated to be quagmires to make money, then it's not a failed policy.
[03:37:28.180 --> 03:37:32.260]  They say the war on drugs is a failure, there's more drugs, more people in prison, but for
[03:37:32.260 --> 03:37:35.580]  the big banks and the military industrial complex, that's a success.
[03:37:35.580 --> 03:37:37.580]  Oh yeah, very much so.
[03:37:37.580 --> 03:37:42.420]  People need to always remember there are profiteers at war.
[03:37:42.420 --> 03:37:48.740]  There are people that wait for war because they become exceptionally wealthy when there's
[03:37:48.740 --> 03:37:49.740]  war is fought.
[03:37:49.740 --> 03:37:55.660]  And these are the people that lead, these are the lobbyists that get those secret team
[03:37:55.660 --> 03:38:00.860]  guys at that level of government to move forward, like here's what Proudy also brings
[03:38:00.860 --> 03:38:01.860]  out very clearly.
[03:38:01.860 --> 03:38:05.580]  He brings out the fraud of the CIA.
[03:38:05.580 --> 03:38:09.380]  We all believe the CIA is there to gather intelligence, right?
[03:38:09.380 --> 03:38:10.380]  Yes.
[03:38:10.380 --> 03:38:14.660]  Well Proudy says that's about 10% of what they do.
[03:38:14.660 --> 03:38:20.540]  The other 90% is carrying out these military agendas and creating the wars.
[03:38:20.540 --> 03:38:21.540]  And assassinations.
[03:38:21.540 --> 03:38:22.540]  Yeah.
[03:38:22.540 --> 03:38:24.540]  Well that's what helps create the wars.
[03:38:24.540 --> 03:38:30.380]  See, they were designed by Harry Truman to not set policy.
[03:38:30.380 --> 03:38:35.780]  They were supposedly to be there only to provide information for the president.
[03:38:35.780 --> 03:38:41.620]  And Alan Dulles, Proudy makes it very clear that Alan Dulles, and of course he's net
[03:38:41.620 --> 03:38:46.340]  deep, a member of the Warren Commission and all that on Kennedy, Alan Dulles is the one
[03:38:46.340 --> 03:38:54.140]  that created today's CIA, this independent rogue outlaw state that is uncontrollable
[03:38:54.140 --> 03:38:56.380]  now even by our own government.
[03:38:56.380 --> 03:38:59.980]  They're on their own now, they're cowboys.
[03:38:59.980 --> 03:39:01.500]  Where do you see this going?
[03:39:01.500 --> 03:39:11.500]  Because I have a Bloomberg report here in my stack where the federal government is telling
[03:39:11.500 --> 03:39:15.860]  private and public pension funds you must invest, quote, in failed banks and now they're
[03:39:15.860 --> 03:39:19.020]  getting ready to go after people's pension funds.
[03:39:19.020 --> 03:39:24.820]  Are they trying to push the American people into some type of armed revolt?
[03:39:24.820 --> 03:39:30.620]  I believe they're trying to destroy the middle class.
[03:39:30.620 --> 03:39:31.620]  Absolutely and why?
[03:39:31.620 --> 03:39:36.580]  Because we're the only country that's ever really had one.
[03:39:36.580 --> 03:39:41.780]  That's always been the American dream, is that you can rise from poverty in this country
[03:39:41.780 --> 03:39:43.740]  and you can become a millionaire.
[03:39:43.740 --> 03:39:47.580]  Well, that dream is vanishing quickly.
[03:39:47.580 --> 03:39:52.180]  There is not going to be a middle class in about 15 years, I don't believe.
[03:39:52.180 --> 03:39:56.660]  There will just be rich and poor and therefore we will be like every other country around
[03:39:56.660 --> 03:40:03.700]  the globe and maybe Alex is being done to globalize Mexico, Canada and us.
[03:40:03.700 --> 03:40:08.700]  Absolutely North American Union, that way people are so poor they can't ever resist
[03:40:08.700 --> 03:40:09.700]  the ruling class.
[03:40:09.700 --> 03:40:10.700]  Here's that Bloomberg article.
[03:40:10.700 --> 03:40:13.820]  They've got to bring us down to Mexico's level.
[03:40:13.820 --> 03:40:18.660]  Exactly, that's what the globalists say, in fact there's a clip we have of Obama where
[03:40:18.660 --> 03:40:23.260]  he says, in this new world order, no nation can be above another.
[03:40:23.260 --> 03:40:27.940]  But that doesn't mean raise the third world in the globalist documents, they want to lower
[03:40:27.940 --> 03:40:28.940]  everybody.
[03:40:28.940 --> 03:40:32.980]  Yeah, they would rather lower us down to the third world level.
[03:40:32.980 --> 03:40:33.980]  Unbelievable.
[03:40:33.980 --> 03:40:37.500]  It goes to raising up the third world car level.
[03:40:37.500 --> 03:40:41.180]  Let's read this Bloomberg headline for folks that are doubting me, failed banks may get
[03:40:41.180 --> 03:40:45.820]  pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is trying
[03:40:45.820 --> 03:40:50.420]  to encourage public retirement funds that control more than $2 trillion to buy all or
[03:40:50.420 --> 03:40:56.220]  part of failed lenders, assets taking on a more direct role in propping up banking systems.
[03:40:56.220 --> 03:41:00.340]  And it talks about how the regulators are ordering them to do it, since when do regulators
[03:41:00.340 --> 03:41:05.540]  order private and public pension funds to be invested in the failed banks?
[03:41:05.540 --> 03:41:12.020]  And since when would you look at the clear conscience want to invest in a failed bank?
[03:41:12.020 --> 03:41:17.020]  Well the government says, Jesse, they want to grab your 401k and give it to the bankers.
[03:41:17.020 --> 03:41:24.140]  Well, I'll tell you Alex, I don't know, maybe they do want an on the street revolution.
[03:41:24.140 --> 03:41:25.140]  I don't know.
[03:41:25.140 --> 03:41:28.740]  Well, I know they've been setting up for it and infiltrating, I know they infiltrated
[03:41:28.740 --> 03:41:32.500]  these militias and set them up to create the illusion that there's about to be all this
[03:41:32.500 --> 03:41:36.460]  domestic terror and I believe they're getting ready to stage terror attacks, Governor, to
[03:41:36.460 --> 03:41:41.100]  blame it on the American people to use Northcom against the American people.
[03:41:41.100 --> 03:41:46.140]  So that what they could empower themselves into top martial law type situation?
[03:41:46.140 --> 03:41:50.020]  I know they've been making preparations for two decades in earnest starting with Oliver
[03:41:50.020 --> 03:41:53.980]  North and I know I've never seen such a build up towards it.
[03:41:53.980 --> 03:41:59.980]  Okay, well it's something we all got to be aware of without a doubt, but you know there's
[03:41:59.980 --> 03:42:06.220]  still a lot of masses out there and we're still very powerful, but the only thing is
[03:42:06.220 --> 03:42:08.580]  we have to learn to use our power.
[03:42:08.580 --> 03:42:13.900]  Well you've got a powerful voice as a political icon and independent of former governor.
[03:42:13.900 --> 03:42:17.780]  What would you say to the American people if we see some terror attacks, they're blamed
[03:42:17.780 --> 03:42:23.100]  on the American people and they start trying to use these different enemy combatant acts,
[03:42:23.100 --> 03:42:25.740]  belligerent acts to start grabbing U.S. citizens?
[03:42:25.740 --> 03:42:30.260]  Well, you know, I think the first thing we need to do is this.
[03:42:30.260 --> 03:42:36.820]  I think we need to put huge pressure on the Obama administration to rescind the Patriot
[03:42:36.820 --> 03:42:37.820]  Act.
[03:42:37.820 --> 03:42:38.820]  Yes.
[03:42:38.820 --> 03:42:44.420]  I think that would be the great starting point for people to start marching and demanding
[03:42:44.420 --> 03:42:46.420]  that the Patriot Act be abolished.
[03:42:46.420 --> 03:42:48.420]  That's a good point.
[03:42:48.420 --> 03:42:53.620]  The Patriot Act is the thing that's taking away our freedoms, it's taking away Tabeus
[03:42:53.620 --> 03:42:58.740]  Corpus where they can arrest you, simply say you committed a terrorist act, you can't get
[03:42:58.740 --> 03:43:03.620]  a lawyer, they can hold you without a trial and people in this country better wake up
[03:43:03.620 --> 03:43:09.500]  because what they're doing to them guys at Guantanamo down at Gitmo, they could do to
[03:43:09.500 --> 03:43:10.500]  you.
[03:43:10.500 --> 03:43:14.500]  Well, that's what the belligerent act states that John McCain's introduced and Lindsey
[03:43:14.500 --> 03:43:15.860]  Graham's supporting.
[03:43:15.860 --> 03:43:20.580]  It says for any intelligence reason or any direction of the president, citizens can
[03:43:20.580 --> 03:43:24.540]  be grabbed and given enhanced interrogation and never be seen again.
[03:43:24.540 --> 03:43:25.540]  I'm not kidding.
[03:43:25.540 --> 03:43:26.540]  I even had a judge.
[03:43:26.540 --> 03:43:27.540]  John McCain.
[03:43:27.540 --> 03:43:28.540]  Absolutely.
[03:43:28.540 --> 03:43:31.220]  John McCain is supporting something like that.
[03:43:31.220 --> 03:43:32.380]  Guys print the belligerent act.
[03:43:32.380 --> 03:43:34.420]  I want to read Governor Ventura the actual passage.
[03:43:34.420 --> 03:43:35.420]  Yes, sir.
[03:43:35.420 --> 03:43:40.980]  And I had Judge Napolitano on as a former federal judge and he pointed out it says that the
[03:43:40.980 --> 03:43:46.020]  fact that you've been grabbed is a secret unless the House and Senate Intelligence Committee
[03:43:46.020 --> 03:43:50.060]  vote to allow it to be known you've even been grabbed.
[03:43:50.060 --> 03:43:51.060]  Absolutely.
[03:43:51.060 --> 03:43:58.060]  Well, then, let me say this on your show, Alex, I will never disappear by my own choice.
[03:43:58.060 --> 03:43:59.060]  Good point.
[03:43:59.060 --> 03:44:08.060]  So I've said it now on your show, so everybody knows that if Jesse Ventura suddenly disappears,
[03:44:08.060 --> 03:44:14.060]  they'll know that I wouldn't do that other than to go surfing in Mexico and you know
[03:44:14.060 --> 03:44:16.060]  that I'll come back every spring.
[03:44:16.060 --> 03:44:20.060]  Well, I tell you, that brings me to the next question.
[03:44:20.060 --> 03:44:25.220]  As things heat up, as you become even more prominent, if that's possible, but you are
[03:44:25.220 --> 03:44:29.340]  and as people's respect for you goes even higher, we need to take good care of you.
[03:44:29.340 --> 03:44:30.340]  So watch out.
[03:44:30.340 --> 03:44:34.500]  There aren't some frogmen out there when you're surfing that try to make you disappear.
[03:44:34.500 --> 03:44:35.500]  Be careful.
[03:44:35.500 --> 03:44:40.060]  I hope you're strapping a sidearm or at least a spear gun when you're out there.
[03:44:40.060 --> 03:44:47.060]  I've always been a pretty good swimmer, Alex, and I can take care of myself in the water.
[03:44:47.060 --> 03:44:52.060]  And I truly don't believe any of my CO team mates would do that to me.
[03:44:52.060 --> 03:44:54.060]  No, I don't think they wouldn't either.
[03:44:54.060 --> 03:44:56.060]  You know what they don't believe that would happen.
[03:44:56.060 --> 03:45:00.060]  And so maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so.
[03:45:00.060 --> 03:45:07.060]  But no, it's just a case again where we've got to keep talking when like that lady that
[03:45:07.060 --> 03:45:12.060]  sent you that thing, I have sympathy for her son who's over there fighting because it's
[03:45:12.060 --> 03:45:13.060]  our fault.
[03:45:13.060 --> 03:45:16.060]  People need to understand this also.
[03:45:16.060 --> 03:45:20.060]  We can end all these wars by bringing the draft back.
[03:45:20.060 --> 03:45:25.060]  And I used to be on the abolished the draft movement after Vietnam, but now I realize
[03:45:25.060 --> 03:45:30.060]  that the professional military is a mistake because the problem is this.
[03:45:30.060 --> 03:45:36.060]  When you get a professional military like we have, we the public are then not vigilant.
[03:45:36.060 --> 03:45:43.060]  We need to be vigilant to never send those young men and women into harm's way unless
[03:45:43.060 --> 03:45:45.060]  it is absolutely essential.
[03:45:45.060 --> 03:45:47.060]  Well, now we've got a mercenary army.
[03:45:47.060 --> 03:45:49.060]  I think we should ban that first.
[03:45:49.060 --> 03:45:50.060]  Totally.
[03:45:50.060 --> 03:45:52.060]  You've got to get rid of these mercenaries.
[03:45:52.060 --> 03:45:54.060]  You've got to get rid of Blackwater.
[03:45:54.060 --> 03:45:59.060]  You've got to get rid of all of them groups of because there's actually more mercenaries
[03:45:59.060 --> 03:46:01.060]  in Iraq today than there are soldiers.
[03:46:01.060 --> 03:46:06.060]  Well, I've talked to Anthony Schaefer, Special Forces Colonel Commander, and he talked about
[03:46:06.060 --> 03:46:09.060]  how the CIA wouldn't let him kill bin Laden two weeks before 9-11.
[03:46:09.060 --> 03:46:14.060]  And he said that was being done because they already had contractors in the CIA with more
[03:46:14.060 --> 03:46:19.060]  power than the army and the Navy, and that they basically are above the law and can do
[03:46:19.060 --> 03:46:20.060]  whatever they want.
[03:46:20.060 --> 03:46:26.060]  In Proudie's book, you'll find out the CIA runs our military.
[03:46:26.060 --> 03:46:31.060]  Our military is used to back up whatever the CIA is getting involved with.
[03:46:31.060 --> 03:46:35.060]  Well, that's what Colonel Schaefer says, you know?
[03:46:35.060 --> 03:46:36.060]  Oh, yeah.
[03:46:36.060 --> 03:46:38.060]  Proudie says it, too.
[03:46:38.060 --> 03:46:41.060]  Well, he might be good to interview Anthony Schaefer.
[03:46:41.060 --> 03:46:44.060]  He's on Fox and MSNBC and CNN and all of them.
[03:46:44.060 --> 03:46:46.060]  Let me read this to you just so it's on record.
[03:46:46.060 --> 03:46:49.060]  In fact, here's the bill right here racing through the Senate right now.
[03:46:49.060 --> 03:46:52.060]  The center is to be detained as enemy belligerence.
[03:46:52.060 --> 03:46:54.060]  The full bill can be read here.
[03:46:54.060 --> 03:46:59.060]  A person is considered a high-value detainee if they fulfill one of the following criteria.
[03:46:59.060 --> 03:47:04.060]  And it says, number three, potential intelligence value, number five, such other matters as the
[03:47:04.060 --> 03:47:06.060]  President considers appropriate.
[03:47:06.060 --> 03:47:10.060]  And it says the enemy belligerent interrogation detention and prosecution act of 2010.
[03:47:10.060 --> 03:47:15.060]  And it says they can secretly grab you, put a bag over your head, and then they can use
[03:47:15.060 --> 03:47:18.060]  enhanced interrogation, which is torture.
[03:47:18.060 --> 03:47:21.060]  I mean, what's your take on...
[03:47:21.060 --> 03:47:25.060]  Alex, torture you to do what?
[03:47:25.060 --> 03:47:27.060]  I guess to say you're guilty.
[03:47:27.060 --> 03:47:28.060]  Well, I don't know.
[03:47:28.060 --> 03:47:31.060]  Okay, let's say hypothetically they grabbed me.
[03:47:31.060 --> 03:47:36.060]  What would they torture me to find out?
[03:47:36.060 --> 03:47:37.060]  That's the whole point.
[03:47:37.060 --> 03:47:40.060]  They only torture for terror and to get false confessions.
[03:47:40.060 --> 03:47:43.060]  Okay, so I'd have to confess to something then, right?
[03:47:43.060 --> 03:47:44.060]  Yes.
[03:47:44.060 --> 03:47:45.060]  Okay.
[03:47:45.060 --> 03:47:46.060]  That's what I was interested in.
[03:47:46.060 --> 03:47:51.060]  Why on earth would they pick someone and then torture them for what purpose?
[03:47:51.060 --> 03:47:55.060]  Well, now, if we ever have another big war and people torture our troops, how can we
[03:47:55.060 --> 03:47:56.060]  say it's wrong?
[03:47:56.060 --> 03:47:57.060]  We can't.
[03:47:57.060 --> 03:48:02.060]  We haven't been able to do that since Abu Ghraib and Ghetmo.
[03:48:02.060 --> 03:48:03.060]  We can't.
[03:48:03.060 --> 03:48:04.060]  We can't.
[03:48:04.060 --> 03:48:09.060]  You know, let me throw this out for your listeners to understand this, too, Alex.
[03:48:09.060 --> 03:48:15.060]  You know, we're the United States, and let me reiterate, my father's a World War II vet,
[03:48:15.060 --> 03:48:19.060]  my mother's a World War II vet, my brother and I are both Vietnam vets.
[03:48:19.060 --> 03:48:22.060]  I say that because of what I'm going to tell you now.
[03:48:22.060 --> 03:48:27.060]  We in the United States have been practicing terrorism for 50 years.
[03:48:27.060 --> 03:48:29.060]  We just call it foreign policy.
[03:48:29.060 --> 03:48:30.060]  Yes.
[03:48:30.060 --> 03:48:32.060]  Because we've been terrorizing Cuba.
[03:48:32.060 --> 03:48:36.060]  We've attempted to kill Castro on multiple occasions.
[03:48:36.060 --> 03:48:39.060]  We've ruined their cane fields.
[03:48:39.060 --> 03:48:41.060]  We've attempted to destroy their economy.
[03:48:41.060 --> 03:48:46.060]  And now, do you know about this character, Orlando Bosch?
[03:48:46.060 --> 03:48:47.060]  Tell folks about it.
[03:48:47.060 --> 03:48:54.060]  Well, Orlando Bosch was a guy who blew up, blew up a civilian Cuban airliner.
[03:48:54.060 --> 03:48:56.060]  Or the CIA and got protected.
[03:48:56.060 --> 03:48:59.060]  No, there were 73 people on board.
[03:48:59.060 --> 03:49:02.060]  Now, is that not an act of terrorism?
[03:49:02.060 --> 03:49:03.060]  It is.
[03:49:03.060 --> 03:49:05.060]  Well, the senior pardoned him.
[03:49:05.060 --> 03:49:06.060]  Yes.
[03:49:06.060 --> 03:49:12.060]  This guy that blew up a plane with 73 people on it.
[03:49:12.060 --> 03:49:18.060]  In fact, we need to realize that we need to take our heads out of the sand,
[03:49:18.060 --> 03:49:22.060]  the citizens of the United States of America, and start realizing,
[03:49:22.060 --> 03:49:28.060]  think of it this way, why do we have to spend so much money on our defense budget?
[03:49:28.060 --> 03:49:32.060]  Who's after us and for what reason?
[03:49:32.060 --> 03:49:35.060]  What are we protecting ourselves from?
[03:49:35.060 --> 03:49:39.060]  Obviously, we haven't behaved very well throughout the world,
[03:49:39.060 --> 03:49:44.060]  because clearly, if we're in such danger that literally half of our money
[03:49:44.060 --> 03:49:49.060]  and our taxes have to go to defense spending, what does that tell you?
[03:49:49.060 --> 03:49:53.060]  Well, I wanted to add that that individual you mentioned we cover in Terror Storm,
[03:49:53.060 --> 03:49:59.060]  it's declassified that he blew up a plane full of the Olympic team for the Cubans.
[03:49:59.060 --> 03:50:00.060]  Yeah.
[03:50:00.060 --> 03:50:05.060]  So, again, and then there really isn't many people attacking us,
[03:50:05.060 --> 03:50:10.060]  so the military industrial complex goes out and finances terror groups or stages attacks,
[03:50:10.060 --> 03:50:15.060]  as the pretext to ratchet up the naked body scanners and the face scanners and the control.
[03:50:15.060 --> 03:50:19.060]  Yeah, maybe well, you may well be right on that.
[03:50:19.060 --> 03:50:24.060]  Because again, we've been practicing terrorism for 50 years.
[03:50:24.060 --> 03:50:27.060]  We just call it foreign policy.
[03:50:27.060 --> 03:50:32.060]  I mean, look at all the people we've tried to assassinate down in Central America.
[03:50:32.060 --> 03:50:34.060]  That's not terrorism.
[03:50:34.060 --> 03:50:40.060]  When you go in and attempt just because a country has a different form of government than you have,
[03:50:40.060 --> 03:50:46.060]  what gives us the right to go into that country and attempt to assassinate their leader?
[03:50:46.060 --> 03:50:48.060]  Well, if they tried it here, they'd be called terrorists.
[03:50:48.060 --> 03:50:50.060]  I'm skipping this network break.
[03:50:50.060 --> 03:50:52.060]  We've got about nine minutes left with Jesse Ventura.
[03:50:52.060 --> 03:50:53.060]  This is a network break.
[03:50:53.060 --> 03:50:55.060]  We're skipping it, not station break.
[03:50:55.060 --> 03:51:01.060]  Just word to everybody out there who's just joined us, infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[03:51:01.060 --> 03:51:08.060]  I want to encourage all the listeners to not procrastinate and get Jesse Ventura's American Conspiracies at infowars.com.
[03:51:08.060 --> 03:51:15.060]  You can get the book, $5 off the book in hardcover, and then get the film of your choice with the book when you get it.
[03:51:15.060 --> 03:51:18.060]  That's how much I want you to read it, infowars.com.
[03:51:18.060 --> 03:51:24.060]  Governor, we've only got about 10 minutes left with your nine minutes left and there's so many other things I wanted to talk about with you.
[03:51:24.060 --> 03:51:30.060]  Shifting yours into something just as serious because you are informing millions of people every week.
[03:51:30.060 --> 03:51:34.060]  Your television show, when is it going to be back on the airwaves?
[03:51:34.060 --> 03:51:40.060]  Can you give us any view into what some of the episodes may be about?
[03:51:40.060 --> 03:51:44.060]  Alex, right now we're just ramping up.
[03:51:44.060 --> 03:51:46.060]  They just got the budget approved.
[03:51:46.060 --> 03:51:49.060]  My son is finally, I think you'll get a paycheck next week.
[03:51:49.060 --> 03:51:54.060]  So that means it's actually happening because that's how you judge an LA.
[03:51:54.060 --> 03:51:58.060]  A project's happening when you get a check and it clears the bank.
[03:51:58.060 --> 03:51:59.060]  Yes.
[03:51:59.060 --> 03:52:08.060]  Well, he should be getting paid next week for his opening participation in the show.
[03:52:08.060 --> 03:52:09.060]  We'll be ramping up.
[03:52:09.060 --> 03:52:16.060]  We haven't pared down to what the 10 conspiracies will be,
[03:52:16.060 --> 03:52:24.060]  but I will tell you they are allowing me to go back after JFK.
[03:52:24.060 --> 03:52:36.060]  So we will be taking one trip back to the past and we're going to unleash some probably new things on the John F. Kennedy assassination that I don't believe anybody else.
[03:52:36.060 --> 03:52:47.060]  And if we're successful on one of the things we do, it will completely show that it was a conspiracy and that Oswald did not act alone.
[03:52:47.060 --> 03:52:48.060]  Amazing.
[03:52:48.060 --> 03:52:52.060]  And that's all I'll say for now because I don't care going farther.
[03:52:52.060 --> 03:52:56.060]  Well, if you don't know the past, you're not going to know the future.
[03:52:56.060 --> 03:52:57.060]  Exactly.
[03:52:57.060 --> 03:53:04.060]  And then other things that are on the radar screen, are you familiar with this Plum Island?
[03:53:04.060 --> 03:53:10.060]  Oh, biological weapons, zoological weapons laboratory off the coast of New York where we got Lyme disease and so much more.
[03:53:10.060 --> 03:53:13.060]  Now they've built 36 of these in major cities.
[03:53:13.060 --> 03:53:14.060]  Yeah.
[03:53:14.060 --> 03:53:17.060]  Well, that's on the screen right now.
[03:53:17.060 --> 03:53:19.060]  And there's a few other good ones.
[03:53:19.060 --> 03:53:21.060]  And again, we're just paring them down now.
[03:53:21.060 --> 03:53:24.060]  We'll probably see what happens is this.
[03:53:24.060 --> 03:53:28.060]  TV will start off and they'll approve like two or three of them.
[03:53:28.060 --> 03:53:31.060]  So we'll go ahead and begin working on them.
[03:53:31.060 --> 03:53:36.060]  Then in the process of working on them, other approvals will come for the other shows.
[03:53:36.060 --> 03:53:37.060]  Yeah.
[03:53:37.060 --> 03:53:41.060]  And so then the staff will start ramping up for those shows also.
[03:53:41.060 --> 03:53:49.060]  What gets confusing in doing the shows is that sometimes we'll be doing four of them at one time.
[03:53:49.060 --> 03:53:51.060]  Well, you guys aren't half-assing this either.
[03:53:51.060 --> 03:53:53.060]  You do a lot of research, a lot of work.
[03:53:53.060 --> 03:53:55.060]  A lot goes into this television show.
[03:53:55.060 --> 03:54:04.060]  Well, I'll tell you for our little purse string budget that we're on, we do a hell of a job
[03:54:04.060 --> 03:54:08.060]  because you know what I actually did in negotiations this year?
[03:54:08.060 --> 03:54:09.060]  What?
[03:54:09.060 --> 03:54:14.060]  I was already locked in for the second season, so I couldn't negotiate money at all.
[03:54:14.060 --> 03:54:17.060]  But I couldn't negotiate artistically.
[03:54:17.060 --> 03:54:23.060]  I told my top agent at William Morris said, look, I said, I want it in writing.
[03:54:23.060 --> 03:54:28.060]  That this year we'll actually get a set of clappers for when we're out on the streets.
[03:54:28.060 --> 03:54:31.060]  You know what clappers are now, right?
[03:54:31.060 --> 03:54:32.060]  Tell me.
[03:54:32.060 --> 03:54:35.060]  Well, they're those little boards you see in Hollywood.
[03:54:35.060 --> 03:54:36.060]  The clickers.
[03:54:36.060 --> 03:54:39.060]  In front of the camera, what scene it is, blah, blah, blah.
[03:54:39.060 --> 03:54:40.060]  And then they clap.
[03:54:40.060 --> 03:54:41.060]  Yes.
[03:54:41.060 --> 03:54:43.060]  And that way you can separate all your shoots.
[03:54:43.060 --> 03:54:49.060]  Well, we were so cheap in doing this thing initially we had to use our hands.
[03:54:49.060 --> 03:54:50.060]  I remember.
[03:54:50.060 --> 03:54:51.060]  Yeah.
[03:54:51.060 --> 03:54:56.060]  But the clap, and so I told them, I said, look, the only thing I demand is that I want it
[03:54:56.060 --> 03:55:00.060]  in writing that we will have a clapper sent out shoots.
[03:55:00.060 --> 03:55:05.060]  And it was funny because my top agent at William Morris started laughing and he said,
[03:55:05.060 --> 03:55:10.060]  Governor, I can assure you, I'll take it out of our end.
[03:55:10.060 --> 03:55:12.060]  You will have a clapper this year.
[03:55:12.060 --> 03:55:19.060]  Man, I tell you, you spent so much time, what, six months of work or more over a year making
[03:55:19.060 --> 03:55:21.060]  the last television program.
[03:55:21.060 --> 03:55:25.060]  So when will we see this air in the fall of this year?
[03:55:25.060 --> 03:55:31.060]  I can't even venture a guess right now because, again, it'll depend on how many of them they
[03:55:31.060 --> 03:55:36.060]  want done and in the can and how many and at what point are we out to finish up whatever
[03:55:36.060 --> 03:55:41.060]  is left before they, because once they make the decision to start airing them, I've got
[03:55:41.060 --> 03:55:46.060]  a feeling they're going to want to have the majority of them done so that they can air
[03:55:46.060 --> 03:55:50.060]  them weekly like they did last time where 10 weeks in a row, you will get a different
[03:55:50.060 --> 03:55:52.060]  conspiracy every week.
[03:55:52.060 --> 03:55:54.060]  Well, I look forward to seeing any.
[03:55:54.060 --> 03:55:57.060]  So venturing in the can, I'm just spitballing here.
[03:55:57.060 --> 03:56:02.060]  Venturing a guess, I would say the soonest we'll be on will be sometime in the fall.
[03:56:02.060 --> 03:56:04.060]  Well, I look forward to seeing you again in person.
[03:56:04.060 --> 03:56:05.060]  You're so great.
[03:56:05.060 --> 03:56:06.060]  So is your son and the whole crew.
[03:56:06.060 --> 03:56:11.060]  The book is American Conspiracies, available at infowars.com and everywhere else, but we
[03:56:11.060 --> 03:56:14.060]  have it discounted with a free film at infowars.com.
[03:56:14.060 --> 03:56:19.060]  Or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:56:19.060 --> 03:56:23.060]  Governor Ventura in closing, we've got about three minutes left here.
[03:56:23.060 --> 03:56:28.060]  Studying the New World Order, studying the global elite, studying these shadowy organizations.
[03:56:28.060 --> 03:56:35.060]  What has it been like, your immersion in this and what is your model now of who's running
[03:56:35.060 --> 03:56:37.060]  the world and what their agenda is?
[03:56:37.060 --> 03:56:42.060]  Well, I still don't know exactly who is, you know, if you're asking me to name names,
[03:56:42.060 --> 03:56:45.060]  I can't do that, even Fletcher Prowdy can't do it.
[03:56:45.060 --> 03:56:46.060]  No, but what their agenda is?
[03:56:46.060 --> 03:56:50.060]  Well, to me, the agenda is simple and it seems clear to me.
[03:56:50.060 --> 03:56:55.060]  Ever since 9-11, it's been an agenda to take away our freedoms.
[03:56:55.060 --> 03:56:56.060]  Slavery.
[03:56:56.060 --> 03:56:58.060]  You can leave it right at that.
[03:56:58.060 --> 03:56:59.060]  Slavery.
[03:56:59.060 --> 03:57:03.060]  The most dangerous thing I've seen that have come out of this crap in the last 10 years
[03:57:03.060 --> 03:57:07.060]  is the fact that they've suspended habeas corpus.
[03:57:07.060 --> 03:57:11.060]  They've literally shredded the Fourth Amendment of illegal search and seizure.
[03:57:11.060 --> 03:57:17.060]  Every person in America needs to understand that every phone call you make and every email
[03:57:17.060 --> 03:57:22.060]  you send, the government has the capability to be eavesdropping that.
[03:57:22.060 --> 03:57:24.060]  Now, are they doing it to all of them?
[03:57:24.060 --> 03:57:25.060]  Of course not.
[03:57:25.060 --> 03:57:32.060]  But they have the ability and they have the assurance that they can do it because apparently
[03:57:32.060 --> 03:57:33.060]  our constant...
[03:57:33.060 --> 03:57:36.060]  You know what's kind of interesting, Alex, is this.
[03:57:36.060 --> 03:57:39.060]  I now understand why they eradicate marijuana.
[03:57:39.060 --> 03:57:42.060]  Do you know why I can understand that?
[03:57:42.060 --> 03:57:43.060]  Why?
[03:57:43.060 --> 03:57:50.060]  Because our Constitution Bill of Rights and the flag are all made of marijuana.
[03:57:50.060 --> 03:57:51.060]  That's true.
[03:57:51.060 --> 03:57:54.060]  All the originals are hemp.
[03:57:54.060 --> 03:57:56.060]  They're all made out of marijuana.
[03:57:56.060 --> 03:58:01.060]  The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Betsy Ross's flag.
[03:58:01.060 --> 03:58:07.060]  And so it doesn't surprise me that they want to eradicate marijuana because they're eradicating
[03:58:07.060 --> 03:58:09.060]  the Constitution.
[03:58:09.060 --> 03:58:12.060]  They're eradicating our Bill of Rights and they've certainly eradicated the flag in my
[03:58:12.060 --> 03:58:13.060]  opinion.
[03:58:13.060 --> 03:58:17.060]  Governor, I'm going to say bye to you as soon as the show ends here in about 30 seconds.
[03:58:17.060 --> 03:58:19.060]  But I really want to thank you for coming on.
[03:58:19.060 --> 03:58:20.060]  Congratulations for doing it your way.
[03:58:20.060 --> 03:58:22.060]  Telling the truth, not compromising.
[03:58:22.060 --> 03:58:24.060]  Getting a number one hit TV show on your network.
[03:58:24.060 --> 03:58:27.060]  Number four on the New York Times bestseller list for the book.
[03:58:27.060 --> 03:58:31.060]  And people are waking up and we got a good chance of bringing down this new world order.
[03:58:31.060 --> 03:58:33.060]  And thank God we got you on our team.
[03:58:33.060 --> 03:58:34.060]  God bless you, Governor.
[03:58:34.060 --> 03:58:37.060]  All right, thanks Alex.
[03:58:37.060 --> 03:58:38.060]  We'll talk to you again in the spring.
[03:58:38.060 --> 03:58:39.060]  Absolutely.
[03:58:39.060 --> 03:59:05.060]  God bless you, Jesse Ventura.
