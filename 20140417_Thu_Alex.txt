[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:39.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  Hacking is bad.
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.000]  Unless, of course, you're doing it for the U.S. government.
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  When you go to the airport, reports show that the NSA gets info from your online searches during your flight.
[00:50.000 --> 00:57.000]  It's been reported that GOGO, one of the main Wi-Fi suppliers to U.S. airplanes, supplies data to U.S. authorities.
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  Outside of airlines, we've seen companies such as Microsoft, which makes the Xbox implicated in the prison scandal.
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  But if you hack a company that makes video games, get ready for a visit from the FBI.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  And if you expose a prison system in general, get ready to seek asylum and be labeled an enemy of the state.
[01:15.000 --> 01:22.000]  And if the feds just so happen to find another way into your device, such as the heart bleed bug, they say that it's no big deal.
[01:22.000 --> 01:39.000]  70% of all computers use a program that has had a major flaw for over two years, and this flaw allows hackers to get in and read encrypted mail, encrypted communications of all kinds, without our knowledge.
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  Now, keep in mind, this has been going on for two years, and we just now discovered it.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  I think it's one of the problems with American corporations, though, that they become lazy.
[01:47.000 --> 01:55.000]  Rather than building things in the proper way, they rely on open source, which is free, and everybody goes, oh, this is great. This is good stuff.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  But this is what happens.
[01:57.000 --> 02:05.000]  So 70% of all computers in the world have been compromised by this bug, which is two years old.
[02:05.000 --> 02:15.000]  But back to video games. It's been reported that an Iranian Marine was recruited by the CIA to make video games that make players sympathetic to U.S. foreign policy.
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  Finally, it has also come out that the feds are posing as online gamers in order to track the habits of players.
[02:21.000 --> 02:30.000]  They say it's so terrorists can't exchange information in online games, but I think it's the FBI wanting to know just as much about your fantasy life as they do about your real life.
[02:30.000 --> 02:49.000]  You can find more reports at infowars.com.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat U.K. hospitals.
[02:54.000 --> 03:05.000]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the U.K.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  What is the secret of Silent Green?
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  A powdered flesh from dead babies. Some people believe they can cure disease.
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  Because of its enormous popularity, Silent Green is in short supply.
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  Remember, Tuesday is Silent Green Day.
[03:28.000 --> 03:36.000]  The supply of Silent Green has been exhausted. You must evacuate the area.
[03:36.000 --> 03:48.000]  It's very important that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for and the flavoring, but we already know.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  So enjoy the flavor.
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.000]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[03:55.000 --> 04:02.000]  I'm consistently pro-death. I'm for assisted suicide. I'm for regular suicide. I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[04:02.000 --> 04:13.000]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[04:17.000 --> 04:24.000]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in? Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[04:39.000 --> 04:51.000]  It will do it to its dissidents. That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[04:54.000 --> 05:10.000]  The scoops are on their way. The scoops are on their way.
[05:25.000 --> 05:35.000]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a two ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[05:35.000 --> 05:44.000]  This is not a low grade formula. We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver.
[05:44.000 --> 06:00.000]  Using electrical processes within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today and find other amazing supplements at InfoWarsLife.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:08.000]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.000]  All the major networks are state run.
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.000]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[06:18.000 --> 06:21.000]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[06:21.000 --> 06:28.000]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[06:28.000 --> 06:37.000]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media. We are the true media. The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.000]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[07:27.000 --> 07:37.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[07:37.000 --> 07:44.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[08:22.000 --> 08:36.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[08:36.000 --> 08:52.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[08:52.000 --> 09:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is already the 17th day of April 2014.
[09:00.000 --> 09:08.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are broadcasting worldwide. What an amazing broadcast we have lined up for you today.
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  Look at the global financial meltdown crisis with the stock market and derivatives that's been unfolding.
[09:14.000 --> 09:23.000]  We're going to have Nomi Prince on in the third hour today, former managing director at Goldman Sachs and bestselling author.
[09:23.000 --> 09:31.000]  She is going to be joining us coming up some in the third hour today.
[09:31.000 --> 09:44.000]  I do intend to open the phones up for first time callers to talk about any issue you wish to discuss from the Bundy Ranch situation to the new attacks on the second amendment to the missing Malaysian aircraft distraction.
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.000]  Clearly grabbed by a government or hijacked and crashed and they know what happened and are covering it up.
[09:50.000 --> 10:02.000]  And then the serious issues of Ukraine developing with Ukrainian tanks, the Russians have taken over in the eastern area, flying Russian flags, NATO troops reportedly being deployed into the area.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  A very serious situation on that front.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  And then domestically we've got news like this.
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.000]  GOP fears executive order on biometric guns.
[10:12.000 --> 10:29.000]  Senator John Cornyn is warning that Obama administration to not issue an executive order requiring that all new guns be made with biometric technology such as a fingerprint recognition or bracelets that the attorney general said last week they're looking into.
[10:29.000 --> 10:42.000]  Cornyn raised the issue in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder who in testimony earlier this month highlighted biometric bracelets and fingerprint identification as a safety issue that they are looking at trying to require.
[10:42.000 --> 10:55.000]  And the great leader Obama has said over and over again in the last six years, you know, I can't act outside the Constitution.
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  I've got to have Congress.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  You know, I wish I could act and over the first few years, you know, I kind of need to act.
[11:00.000 --> 11:08.000]  I sure want to but can I should I to I'll act whenever I need to do what's right for this country.
[11:08.000 --> 11:16.000]  So selling the idea that come on, Obama, you'll give us all the free welfare and all the free healthcare and all the free chicken and every pot.
[11:16.000 --> 11:27.000]  You know, if you just took the power and you won't take the power while he's taking the power and becoming the most dictatorial president, this country has seen since Lincoln.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  Hands down.
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  Hands down.
[11:30.000 --> 11:37.000]  FDR did some dictatorial things during World War II, but those were temporary and had a lot of public support.
[11:37.000 --> 11:48.000]  And I'm not saying public support alone authorizes someone to act dictatorially, but the point is, is that nothing that I studied in history is anywhere near what Obama's doing.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  And here's the big issue.
[11:49.000 --> 12:02.000]  It's being done with very little fanfare until the last two weeks where Republicans like Gohmert and others, Issa and even Boehner have said we're seeing lawlessness.
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  We're seeing above the law, the president, you know, is stonewalling.
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  The Attorney General really should probably be in jail for ignoring all these subpoenas anyone else would.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  And so finally, people are calling it what it is.
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  And when you enter into a great tyranny, you will not be able to defeat it unless you admit it.
[12:26.000 --> 12:36.000]  It'd be like if you got diagnosed with lung cancer, the most virulent, aggressive, metastasizing form.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  And they said, you know, you've got a 20% chance to live.
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  We cut it out right now if it hasn't totally metastasized yet.
[12:43.000 --> 12:49.000]  But you have no chance 100% death if you don't cut this out of your lung.
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  And you're like, oh, that's kind of scary.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  I don't want to admit that I've got lung cancer.
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  It's kind of scary. I don't want to admit this has happened.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  It's like if you break your leg and a bone sticking out of the side of it, that's happened to me.
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  And you're sitting there looking at it and you go, wow, my leg's really broken.
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  You know, it's really bleeding.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  This really hurts.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  I didn't say to myself, oh, no, my leg's not broken.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  I'm not going to be an extremist.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  This is an extreme act that just happened.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  No, no, it happened.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  Just like you see a car wreck and people flying out of the car dying.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  And then you pull over to try to help them in blood spraying everywhere.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  Out of people's necks and stuff.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  You know, that just happened.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  That was real.
[13:31.000 --> 13:38.000]  When I was a kid visiting a pool party at my dad's dental office party at his office manager's house,
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  they had the old fashioned plate glass windows from the 50s, 60s, whatever it was.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  And I left my water gun outside.
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  My dad goes, come on, we're leaving.
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  He was running to get your water gun.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  And they just closed the door and I ran right through it.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  Right through it, just slicing down the bone of my arm and leg.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  Blood spraying all over the walls.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  You know what? That was an extreme event.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  It happened.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  And they didn't say, oh, son, you're fine.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  It's a mere flesh wound.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  We don't need to go to the hospital.
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  No, they put pressure on it.
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  They got me in the car.
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.000]  They drove me to the hospital.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  They said, do we call ambulance?
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  No, that takes more time.
[14:14.000 --> 14:15.000]  They're slow. Let's go.
[14:15.000 --> 14:16.000]  Where's the quickest hospital?
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  Well, this one's right here, but it's probably not as good right now.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  This other one's cleaner and has better staff generally.
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  Yes, I do a lot of work there, wiring jaws from car wrecks.
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  Let's get there.
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  You know, just they got it done.
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.000]  They got me to the hospital.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  This country is bleeding out in front of us right now.
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  And before I get into all this news, I want to say something to Rachel Maddow and Glenn Beck
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  and all the Democratic Party websites and a bunch of Republican Party websites,
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  and others that are attacking us, saying there's no Chinese deal with energy companies,
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  and none of it exists when it's in the BLM documents,
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  confusing people and manipulating them on the Bundy Ranch situation.
[14:54.000 --> 15:03.000]  There's a 129-mile system of planned power stations and planned cables.
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.000]  This is CBS News.
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.000]  You can just pull up, you know, Harry Reid solar panel plan.
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  You'll get Reuters, AP, CBS News from 2012.
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.000]  When people were saying it looked corrupt because his son was involved, Rory.
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  And when people were pointing out, is it right to have China coming in,
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  getting government stimulus money?
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  But Cylindra broke then, so it messed up the deal for that period,
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  just to basically get the money to build it.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  It's not even if it works or, you know, is it feasible,
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  like the windmills in Spain that are total failure?
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  It's the building of the boondoggle that is the money.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  That's what a boondoggle is, okay?
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  So now you're to believe that didn't even happen,
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  because they go, look, this is 100 miles away where these solar panels are read.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  That's right.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  And then the cables go right by the Bundy Ranch,
[15:57.000 --> 16:03.000]  and they say we have to have this entire corridor as an environmental easement set aside,
[16:03.000 --> 16:07.000]  because we're going to build on this, the Bundy Ranch is the set aside.
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  Now, that's in the BLM documents.
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  And these Democratic Party sites, it's a confidence game.
[16:14.000 --> 16:21.000]  They link to infowars.com in our article that shows the BLM documents
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  that they since removed off their website, and then even off the Google cache,
[16:25.000 --> 16:26.000]  but everybody saved them.
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  All of that's going on.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  All of that's happening.
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  All of that is unfolding.
[16:32.000 --> 16:38.000]  And they're sitting over there, acting like none of it's even going on,
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.000]  and linking to my site like it discredits me going to the proof.
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  See, they think you're so dumb.
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  This is a technique.
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000]  They think you're so ignorant that because they link to it and say it's debunked
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.000]  that you won't even go read it, you'll just maybe glance at it or see the link
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  and think, oh my gosh, it's debunked.
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  It was a scandal in 2012.
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  Just type in Harry Reid, Nevada Solar Farm.
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.000]  And you will get hundreds, in fact, do it, guys.
[17:12.000 --> 17:18.000]  Harry Reid, China Solar.
[17:18.000 --> 17:24.000]  And then click Web because it's two years old, and you will see hundreds and hundreds of articles.
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  There's Reuters, U.S. Senator Harry Reid.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  Scroll back up for me.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.000]  Scroll back up for me.
[17:29.000 --> 17:39.000]  U.S. Senator Reid, Sun Combined for China's Firm's Desert Plan 2012.
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  And then there were articles in the Wall Street Journal everywhere saying,
[17:43.000 --> 17:44.000]  is this right?
[17:44.000 --> 17:45.000]  Is this a scandal?
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  Because he controls the BLM with his chief of staff, who's the head of it.
[17:49.000 --> 17:50.000]  That had just happened.
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  And his son's getting money from this, and they're all involved,
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  and they're going to get government stimulus money and government money to build this.
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  And, you know, is this right?
[18:00.000 --> 18:01.000]  Well, of course it's wrong.
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  It's like saying, is it wrong that Congress insider trades three years ago?
[18:05.000 --> 18:12.000]  And Congress just passed a law saying, retroactively, we make it legal to insider trade now.
[18:12.000 --> 18:13.000]  There it is.
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  Harry Reid's son representing Chinese solar panel plant, Breitbart.
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.000]  Harry Reid bolsters son's interest in China Firm.
[18:21.000 --> 18:27.000]  I mean, folks, then Breitbart writes an article saying there's no China, there's no deal, there's no nothing.
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  Look, the solar thing is 100 miles away from Bundy's Ranch.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  There's a bunch of solar plans on there.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  It runs right by his ranch where the cables are at.
[18:35.000 --> 18:41.000]  And it enlists Bundy, Cliven Bundy by name, and says, we've got to get him off.
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  He's the last family we haven't gotten off.
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  I'm going to repeat that for everybody.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  This is how they operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  This is what's so frustrating.
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.000]  There's no drones.
[18:51.000 --> 18:52.000]  There's no NSA surveillance.
[18:52.000 --> 18:53.000]  There's no bullets.
[18:53.000 --> 18:54.000]  There's no tyranny.
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  We're sick of government lying to us.
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  We're sick of media lying.
[18:58.000 --> 19:03.000]  We're sick of the system sitting there and acting like it's not doing anything wrong.
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  The government is imperious.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  It's arrogant.
[19:06.000 --> 19:07.000]  It's arbitrary.
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.000]  It violates its own laws.
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.000]  It does whatever it wants.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  It's growing like a cancer.
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.000]  The country is bankrupt.
[19:12.000 --> 19:13.000]  It's attacking the family.
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.000]  It's setting up tax structures to shut down small business.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  It's bankrupting farmers and ranchers coast to coast.
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  We import like half our food now, a third of our beef.
[19:21.000 --> 19:24.000]  We're falling apart with criminals running things.
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.000]  And they committed Waco and Ruby Ridge and all these other crimes against us.
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  And then finally some ranchers stand up and say we're sick of being tasered and beat up
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  and you shooting bicyclists in the desert in the back for no reason.
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  We're going to walk up against your guns.
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.000]  You're threatened to shoot us.
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.000]  They're incredible heroes.
[19:40.000 --> 19:45.000]  And all these cowardly neocons that want to seat at the table at the butchering of America
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  want to sit there and act like we're liars.
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  We're cowards.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  We're bad or we want violence.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  We don't want violence.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  But kissing up to the system has gotten us where we're at.
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  They're coming after us one way or another.
[19:56.000 --> 20:25.000]  You understand that, cowards?
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  This is Ted Anderson.
[20:28.000 --> 20:33.000]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.000]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  of gold for your retirement.
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.000]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.

[20:53.000 --> 21:00.000]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  They're all time high with more terrible cost coming.
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  Your food and now your water are being sold to other starving countries.
[21:30.000 --> 21:35.000]  Still one third of our corn goes to expensive gas instead of feeding livestock and people.
[21:35.000 --> 21:39.000]  What few dollars you have, China expects to devalue to uselessness.
[21:39.000 --> 21:43.000]  If it's possible to get the most of the best food and freeze the availability and cost
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  before it disappears and is unavailable, you don't dare miss the opportunity.

[22:23.000 --> 22:26.000]  You could buy three survival seed vaults for less than one of theirs.

[23:56.000 --> 24:22.000]  That's UnseenNow.com.
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.000]  And then Homeland Security is the stake to be driven through this Republic's heart by
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  the New World Order.
[24:28.000 --> 24:36.000]  And that that entire apparatus is basically a guillotine to chop this country's political
[24:36.000 --> 24:37.000]  head off.
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  As Homeland Security and the bureaucracy absorbs what's left of the old Republic.
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.000]  The old Republic is being eroded away at a faster and faster pace.
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  And then as the public desperately realizes, oh my gosh, they're getting rid of the Republic
[24:53.000 --> 24:59.000]  and replacing it with a nightmarish control freak wonderland technocracy for psychopaths
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  to feed on us, a charnel house that would make Hannibal Lecter blush.
[25:06.000 --> 25:14.000]  Governments killed 262 million non-military individuals by hand, according to the University
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  of Hawaii's conservative analysis of the numbers.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  That's probably much higher in the 20th century.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  And I am desperately afraid of it.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  Afraid of not taking action against it, afraid of not defeating it.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  It's more than fear.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  It's a instinct.
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  It's a will.
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  It's a spirit of resistance against this evil.
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  Every time I see people's children or I see innocence or I see innocent women and men
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  having mindless conversations, I get very sad for them.
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  They have no idea they're under scientific attack on record.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  The psychiatric system has been taught.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  You know, there's no NSA spying.
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  There's no government corruption.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  Nobody has it out for you in the political system.
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  That's the ravings of a lunatic.
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.000]  It doesn't matter if I have eco science written by the White House science are saying put stuff
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  in the water to lower your IQ and your fertility.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  It doesn't matter if the Harvard study says it lowers IQ 10 points, just drinking
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  fluoridated water for a few years as a juvenile.
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  It doesn't matter if it gives you seven-fold increase in bone cancer.
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.000]  It doesn't matter if it gives you all sorts of other cancer in your bladder and you name
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  it and brain cancer.
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.000]  It doesn't matter.
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  It doesn't matter if the big measles outbreaks in California later came out this year were
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.000]  from the measles shot CBS News buried it that it was in there.
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.000]  Look it up.
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  Just type in measles outbreak was caused by a vaccinated person.
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.000]  My dad's a dentist and oral surgeon and he's recently retired because of Obamacare.
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.000]  And every time someone would come in his patients of many years with shingles, they would tell
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  him, and you know, I think it's the vaccine.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  They convinced me up at Walgreens to get it.
[26:53.000 --> 26:59.000]  And I got shingles the week after I've never had them.
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  He just hundreds of people.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  It's just absolute fact.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  You know, it's like, oh, come on.
[27:03.000 --> 27:04.000]  That's not a scientific study.
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.000]  It's like a rattlesnake bite you and you go, I had a scientific study to know that, you
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  know, my leg just swole up and I've, you know, got a fever and I'm about to die because
[27:11.000 --> 27:19.000]  that long thing that doesn't have legs came out of a hole and bit me.
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  My grandmother's best friend is an RN going all the way back to World War II.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  That's old.
[27:24.000 --> 27:30.000]  She is 90 years old and she's a smart old bird, but she trusts the system.
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  And she took a shingles shot two years ago and almost killed her.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  He gave her the shingles.
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  And that's the type of woman when my kids were born, came down to Austin and brought them
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  like little eagles and American flags.
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.000]  I mean, these are people that believe in America and I'm telling you, if they told this lady,
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  go run off a cliff for America, she would do it.
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  If they told her jump into a meat grinder, she would do it.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  But see, it's dog life.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  It's total loyalty to the state believing it is America because they grew up in World
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.000]  War II.
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.000]  That's one reason we got her because we were the good guys and the Nazis were the bad guys.
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  So the government's good.
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.000]  Do whatever it says.
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  Well, the government was a lot better compared to the Nazis or the Soviets, but still had
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  a lot of problems and was corrupt.
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.000]  And then it got taken over by eugenicists that were like rock stars from the 1860s right
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  through to today.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  They just changed the name.
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  Hitler got everything from the U.S. and England.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  That's why they got 30 plus thousand top Nazi scientists, not just in rocketry folks, not
[28:30.000 --> 28:37.000]  just in weapons, but in biology and in psychology and in psychiatric systems.
[28:37.000 --> 28:42.000]  And they brought them over here and they were put as the heads of every major department
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  at almost every university.
[28:44.000 --> 28:50.000]  Germans, German officers were put in the entire bureaucracy.
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  Hail Hydra.
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  And then people will say, oh, you're saying the Germans.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  Oh, the Germans.
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.000]  Well, it's weird.
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  No, being German isn't evil.
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  I'm like half German.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  I'm more German than anything else probably.
[29:01.000 --> 29:10.000]  The whole point is, is that Germany was a test of the eugenics takeover, but they plan
[29:10.000 --> 29:11.000]  to destroy them and set them up.
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  This has all been declassified.
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.000]  Lord Milner by the 20s was saying we got to put a dictator in Germany, build them up,
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.000]  make them really mad, and then have them destroy Europe and then we'll take over.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  I mean, these people are smart folks.
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  Read the Lord Milner quotes in the Milner group.
[29:25.000 --> 29:26.000]  Look them up.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  They're published.
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  They created Adolf Alois Hitler.
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  So Hydra doesn't come from Germany.
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  Hydra comes from London.
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  Hail Hydra.
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.000]  And they just tell you everything in movies like Captain America.
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  And Hydra is shield, ladies and gentlemen.
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.000]  You understand that?
[29:44.000 --> 29:45.000]  You go see that movie.
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  That's real.
[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  They have real space planes with decapitation weapons right now.
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  We're on the march.
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.000 --> 30:01.000]  It's Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[30:05.000 --> 30:09.000]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[30:09.000 --> 30:13.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[30:13.000 --> 30:16.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[30:16.000 --> 30:20.000]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you
[30:20.000 --> 30:23.000]  and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[30:23.000 --> 30:27.000]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[30:27.000 --> 30:31.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[30:31.000 --> 30:37.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[30:37.000 --> 30:38.000]  All right.
[30:38.000 --> 30:41.000]  It is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in breads, it's in toothpaste.
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.000]  It's time to take action.
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  It's time to filter our water.

[31:00.000 --> 31:04.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself,
[31:04.000 --> 31:08.000]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[31:10.000 --> 31:15.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[31:15.000 --> 31:21.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[31:21.000 --> 31:24.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[31:28.000 --> 31:33.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[31:33.000 --> 31:38.000]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[31:38.000 --> 31:43.000]  in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[31:43.000 --> 31:48.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[31:48.000 --> 31:54.000]  The new InfoWarsLife Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[32:01.000 --> 32:04.000]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[32:04.000 --> 32:07.000]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[32:07.000 --> 32:15.000]  They are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[32:15.000 --> 32:26.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula
[32:26.000 --> 32:32.000]  sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[32:32.000 --> 32:39.000]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[32:39.000 --> 32:46.000]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[32:46.000 --> 32:55.000]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% of super male vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[32:55.000 --> 33:03.000]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality at InfoWarsLife.com.
[33:25.000 --> 33:50.000]  I am on record for 8 years since I was given the classified information that was leaked publicly so I was allowed to cover it by Dr. Bob Bowman,
[33:50.000 --> 33:58.000]  the nuclear physicist and the former head of the Star Wars program, Colonel Bowman.
[33:58.000 --> 34:07.000]  He was only allowed to reveal the information because it had leaked in C-SPAN debates when he was debating his replacement at Star Wars.
[34:07.000 --> 34:21.000]  He said, no, by the late 70s they had a fleet of robot spacecraft, basically what looked like stealth bombers, with small ones, with DU Shabo rounds.
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.000]  People are going, Alex, we've heard this hundreds of times. Why are you saying it again?
[34:26.000 --> 34:36.000]  Because if I say the movie Captain America Winter Soldier has a lot of real stuff in it, I don't want people thinking, I'm just saying, oh, look at that movie, that's real.
[34:36.000 --> 34:47.000]  When you know about the plan and then you're sitting there seeing it on the big screen, a shadow rogue government run by eugenicist scientists that plans a mass world culling,
[34:47.000 --> 35:02.000]  first taking out the world leaders that they oppose with high energy weapons, kinetic space meteor guns, right out of the last starfighter,
[35:02.000 --> 35:13.000]  which is based, I later learned, on another book from the 70s that was written by another army colonel, forget his name, I did research on it,
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.000]  where in the last starfighter he goes and plays the video game and he's really being surveilled to see who can pilot the ship,
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.000]  and then the aliens come and get him and take him up, and then you see Ender's game, you know, that's the same story.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  Well, it's not aliens, folks, it's globalists.
[35:26.000 --> 35:36.000]  You've got everybody in these combat simulators being desensitized for war, being conditioned for killing, being normalized.
[35:36.000 --> 35:45.000]  And it turns out, oh, the Pentagon in the 50s began funding secret research that in the 60s was deployed as some of the first ground combat simulators for troops,
[35:45.000 --> 35:53.000]  and they found in Vietnam it made people go from 50% of the time not killing somebody up close to 90% of the time killing somebody.
[35:53.000 --> 36:02.000]  Because if we don't have a killer instinct, you'll be dead marine, to quote, full metal jacket.
[36:02.000 --> 36:10.000]  We're in combat murder simulators, and you tell people that are addicted to them, hey, you know that's a combat murder simulator,
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.000]  and they go, hey, don't talk about my video games, Alex, you stay out of it, you stay out of it right now.
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  That's my games, nothing wrong with it, nothing wrong with it.
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.000]  I mean, I've seen grown adults, some of them famous people, I'm not going to say their names,
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  though you know that's a combat simulator.
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  Well, I don't have any problem with it.
[36:26.000 --> 36:34.000]  No, no, no, for most people it's an arrested development to keep men from launching till age 28 now is the average age,
[36:34.000 --> 36:41.000]  you look at the university studies, for men now to launch and to try to get their own house and a woman.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  I launched at age 12, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:45.000 --> 36:54.000]  I launched and started acting like a man, getting in serious fist fights, going and going out for 16-year-old girls when I was 12, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:54.000 --> 37:00.000]  I'm not saying I'm some super male or anything, but I mean, I launched at 12, I was out of the house at 17.
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  I was dating girls in college when I was 15 years old.
[37:04.000 --> 37:13.000]  I see the average men around, and they are literally little boys.
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.000]  But then they act like men and act like thugs.
[37:16.000 --> 37:23.000]  Being a man now is acting like a thug, the media has put out, and women think somebody acting like a thug is a man.
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  A man, somebody that shows up to work on time.
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  A man, somebody that gets up at 3 a.m. and goes and helps their friend, who's been a car wreck.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  A man, somebody that doesn't back down from tyranny.
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  A man, somebody that has a serious mind and is focused and is aggressive.
[37:37.000 --> 37:43.000]  Now what we see here today, and I'm going off the deep end here talking about a bunch of issues of mind control,
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  but television, the culture, all of it is mind control, and I've been talking to a lot of top people.
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  Why in all these movies now is it anti-New World Order, anti-government?
[37:51.000 --> 37:56.000]  Because they know in the polls, Congress has a 6% approval rating.
[37:56.000 --> 38:04.000]  They know by the NSA spying and the big aggregate computer systems that feed all intel in to the supercomputers on record.
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  They can predict the future now. They can predict mass movements.
[38:07.000 --> 38:14.000]  They are trying to give you a simulated fake revolution in cyberspace and in Hollywood
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  and a revelation of the method, externalization of the hierarchy
[38:19.000 --> 38:24.000]  to give you the archetypes of the Herculean hero of a thousand faces
[38:24.000 --> 38:32.000]  so that you can believe that the evil has been defeated as the real evil accelerates.
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.000]  And of course, even most of the writers and producers of these films, I've been able to talk to some of them over the years.
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  They're allowed to put it out. They're even good people.
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  And they don't even know why they're being allowed to put all this out.
[38:43.000 --> 38:50.000]  They're being allowed to put all this out because it's a simulated victory you're supposed to have, not a real one.
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.000]  I saw some ad on one of my YouTube videos today that was for a Star Wars game about,
[38:55.000 --> 39:02.000]  create your command base, create your fortress. They pick the carpet and the fixtures.
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.000]  And this is for men and women to go and imagine their imaginary world, ladies and gentlemen,
[39:07.000 --> 39:12.000]  instead of really building a real one.
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  They don't want you on the game board in reality.
[39:15.000 --> 39:22.000]  They want you in fantasy land, ladies and gentlemen, so that they can tell you,
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  well, you know, Alex Jones is discredited. Yeah, there's no Chinese involvement.
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  There's no Harry Reid involvement. There's no solar farm.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  It was 100 miles away. I had nothing to do with it.
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  Even though the power lines are right there.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  Even though it starts right there.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  Even there's multiple power stations listed.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  They just point at one of them and play games with your mind.
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  It's an environmental easement that they can build it right here.
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.000]  And then his land is the agreed upon under UNESCO executive order.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  And it's in the Bureau of Land Management documents.
[39:55.000 --> 40:01.000]  And they link to them saying, we're discredited. See that con game?
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.000]  They say in hundreds of thousands, actually, because when AP comes out, it's in thousands of newspapers.
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  In one day, I was in over a thousand news articles when they came out two years ago and said,
[40:11.000 --> 40:16.000]  Curtdemmo at info wars.com and dredgeport.com are lying to you.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  There are no bullets.
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.000]  There are 20 million here, 100 million there, but not 1.6 billion.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  Now it's over 2.6 billion last time.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  And it doesn't matter that you see every federal agency army.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  It doesn't matter if you all have the purchase orders.
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.000]  They go and play the same game of, look, there's a solar farm here.
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  It's not down there.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  Even though there's a whole bunch of solar farms on the map.
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  They play that game.
[40:42.000 --> 40:45.000]  Obama, you will keep your doctor.
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  And I never said you could keep your doctor.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  And I'm not coming after any guns.
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  Later, I never said I wouldn't come after your guns.
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  And in private recordings, he says, we're going to get these better clingers.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  They're clanging their bibles and their guns.
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  I mean, they're in their private meetings.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  They're talking about us.
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.000]  We're the enemy.
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  And they're already banning importation to most ammo, rifles.
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  They're harassing gun shops.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  They're putting micro stamp laws in there, suing all the gun makers.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  I mean, almost all the big ones.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  It is going on.
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  And now Obama's moving with an executive order.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  The word is they've already signaled it.
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.000]  The Hill newspaper reports for bracelets and biometrics that will render all the other guns illegal.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  That's the battle plan.
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.000]  And I've told you that forever.
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  And so is Larry Pratt.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  They're coming.
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  They're coming.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  Drums, drums of the deep.
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  And anybody who lives in denial is a fool.
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  And then, I mean, again, I'll be honest with you.
[41:46.000 --> 41:57.000]  If it was just some type of Harry Truman crook who just wanted to get bid rigging on roads and give some money to their families and make money off of the largesse.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  I would criticize them.
[41:58.000 --> 41:59.000]  I'd be against it.
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.000]  But at least that's building something and skimming off the top of it.
[42:03.000 --> 42:12.000]  The globalists want to deconstruct civilization as we know it as a total act of will and power and a hate letter.
[42:12.000 --> 42:22.000]  A defiling mass exterminist vandalism of the entire biosphere code of the planet.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  They're coming out with GMOs, making plants unable to reproduce in grasses, trees.
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  They're GMOing all the major food animals, all the major fish.
[42:34.000 --> 42:45.000]  They're releasing them open air, spider goats, insects, crossed salmon with eight other things than the one they released.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  I mean, just total hell on earth.
[42:47.000 --> 42:55.000]  And you've got the environmental heroes that are out there, you know, battling overfishing and, oh, battling global warming.
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  Folks, global warming, overfishing.
[42:57.000 --> 43:04.000]  Overfishing is an issue, but it's nothing compared to open air release of nanotech that's already going on.
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.000]  I mean, we are not in 2014, boys and girls.
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  The technology on the government reservations is at least 35 years advanced.
[43:11.000 --> 43:12.000]  They admit that.
[43:12.000 --> 43:18.000]  So we're really in what's 14 and 30 plus.
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  Yeah, 44, 45 years.
[43:20.000 --> 43:23.000]  We're 2045.
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  And that's why I shouldn't even be up here worried about Glenn Beck attacking me.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  I shouldn't even be worried about Rachel Maddow attacking me again last night.
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  And all of them basically saying I'm calling for violence and trying to frame me.
[43:34.000 --> 43:35.000]  Fine.
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.000]  If the FBI and the government really wants to frame me or kill me, I don't want to die, but just do it.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  Okay?
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  Because you're cutting your own throat.
[43:44.000 --> 43:45.000]  I mean, this is real.
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  What we're going to see happen is over the top insane.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  We are living in a science fiction movie, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:52.000 --> 44:03.000]  And they are changing the entire genetic code of the basic plankton and the basic diatoms and the basic microorganisms in the ocean.
[44:03.000 --> 44:10.000]  They have got thousands of admitted tests going on of just one type of bacteria in the ocean.
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  They are already changing flora across the board.
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  They are probably going to kill everybody.
[44:17.000 --> 44:23.000]  And they've got the FBI running around all the gun shops to demonize gun owners saying, are people talking bad about the government?
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  Let me give the FBI a little news flash.
[44:26.000 --> 44:32.000]  I'd say about 90% of the people in the gun shops are buying guns because of the government.
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  They know crooks when they see it.
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  And you already know that.
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  So it's all just a demonization game.
[44:39.000 --> 44:44.000]  And, you know, maybe you will find some unstable schizophrenic or something that's mad is going to do something.
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.000]  And then you'll be a big hero and get a promotion.
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.000]  But none of it means anything when they're messing with the plankton.
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.000]  Do you know what happens if they flip the plankton or do something to them?
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.000]  It won't just be like Monsanto killing most of our soil in the U.S. on purpose.
[45:01.000 --> 45:05.000]  Coming out with new seeds that can grow in their toxic waste.
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.000]  And admitting that's their plan to their shareholders.
[45:08.000 --> 45:13.000]  Total takeover, total rewrite, total genetic armageddon.
[45:13.000 --> 45:19.000]  And the rest of the world, even the kleptocratic Russians,
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.000]  are looking at the Chinese just doing every form of testing and not caring,
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  even outdoing the United States.
[45:25.000 --> 45:29.000]  And other countries are just totally freaked out.
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.000]  And world leaders, by the way, I know folks that know a lot of world leaders.
[45:32.000 --> 45:38.000]  And I personally, off air, you know, talk to senators and congresspeople
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  that you've not even heard on this show.
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  And they're scared too.
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  Do you think I'm the only smart person around?
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  They just can't act like me.
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.000]  They can't get up and jump up and down like a chicken with their head cut off,
[45:50.000 --> 45:53.000]  even though they want to, because they know the media will probably destroy them.
[45:53.000 --> 45:59.000]  But a time's coming when that will not destroy you.
[45:59.000 --> 46:01.000]  Because stuff's going to get so bad.
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.000]  We go ahead and tell the truth now, or it's all over.
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.000]  Do you want me to apologize to your Rachel Maddow and Glenn Beck?
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.000]  Because you're up on air and your other hosts are saying that, you know,
[46:13.000 --> 46:16.000]  that I want to lock up Glenn Beck's people in a forced labor camp.
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  He said that I'm the type of person.
[46:18.000 --> 46:19.000]  We're the type of group.
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.000]  We played the clip yesterday that would not give them a trial
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  and arrest them for their speech.
[46:24.000 --> 46:25.000]  What the hell is that?
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.000]  Never said any such thing.
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.000]  And that I'm the group that wants violence and I'm the bad guy.
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  Alex Jones, don't go with that group.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  They want violence.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  They think the power structure is doing that because they're scared of us,
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.000]  ladies and gentlemen.
[46:40.000 --> 46:41.000]  They know I'm real.
[46:41.000 --> 46:49.000]  They know I'm committed to this fight.
[46:49.000 --> 46:54.000]  And they know if you get this message and verify it for yourself
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  and look at the data, you're going to make a decision.
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  Because that's what I'm good at is getting people to make decisions.
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.000]  What I'm good at is talking straight to people.
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.000]  Right to their gut, right to their soul.
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  I'm a straight shooter and everybody knows it.
[47:06.000 --> 47:11.000]  And I'm telling you, folks, I don't have words to describe how much danger
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.000]  we're in on the genetic engineering front, the chemical weapons front,
[47:15.000 --> 47:20.000]  the bio warfare front, the nuclear war front, the kleptocrat front.
[47:20.000 --> 47:25.000]  The elites throughout history go insane with the megalomaniacal power.
[47:25.000 --> 47:30.000]  They're going insane right now and they think they're going to merge with machines
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  and they don't even care if there's a nuclear war.
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  They think they're super deep bunkers.
[47:34.000 --> 47:40.000]  They're going to protect them under the Rockies and they're not going to.
[47:40.000 --> 47:45.000]  And you have to understand, folks, that the evil mindset,
[47:45.000 --> 47:53.000]  the evil energy that they've tuned into, wants to destroy things,
[47:53.000 --> 48:01.000]  wants death, wants murder, wants mayhem, wants disintegration.
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  And no one can deny that.
[48:03.000 --> 48:04.000]  Look at what world leaders do.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  Look at what crazy emperors do.
[48:06.000 --> 48:07.000]  Look at Vladi and Paylor.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  Look at Caligula and Nero.
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  Look at Adolf Hitler.
[48:11.000 --> 48:12.000]  Look at Stalin.
[48:12.000 --> 48:13.000]  Look at Lenin.
[48:13.000 --> 48:14.000]  Look at Mao Zedong.
[48:14.000 --> 48:22.000]  Do you know the admitted habits of Mao Zedong?
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  Do you know what's happening in Japan?
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  Where kids are continuing just to have convulsions all over the country
[48:29.000 --> 48:34.000]  and cancer rates are off the chart and total mental illness is setting in?
[48:34.000 --> 48:40.000]  Because an honorable people have been turned into dishonor by the New World Order.
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  The adult diapers are outselling baby diapers.
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  And not just because they're an aging population,
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  the new fad, because the Japanese are so into cleanliness,
[48:50.000 --> 48:56.000]  is for people to poop on themselves.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  You see, people that were so obsessed with cleanliness
[48:59.000 --> 49:05.000]  and taking hot baths every day and so into beauty now are into ugliness.
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  Call it satanic.
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  Call whatever you want.
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  It is what it is.
[49:08.000 --> 49:13.000]  And it's spreading everywhere, ladies and gentlemen, a spirit of evil.
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  Now, you take people wanting to poop on themselves.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  I'm sorry to talk like that, but that's what's going on.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  And you take it to the New World Order level.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  What's really sick?
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  Destroy the planet.
[49:22.000 --> 49:23.000]  Kill everyone.
[49:23.000 --> 49:24.000]  But do it slowly.
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  Kill the babies.
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.000]  Mutate the humans.
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  Mutate the animals.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  Pour out all the genetic garbage.
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  Create total disease.
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  Break up the family.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  And then, only then, when you destroy the soul of humanity,
[49:35.000 --> 49:43.000]  turn us into a technocracy, only then do you destroy the entire planet as an act of willing.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  And I'm paraphrasing some poetry by a top transhumanist.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  I forget his name.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  It's an in-game.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  One of the top people that advises Google and curves well and everybody was,
[49:51.000 --> 49:57.000]  our nihilistic program of willing will go on and we may just destroy the planet as an act of supreme willingness
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  and our total will for the black power.
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  I mean, you know, it's just, just, just, and you're just like reading this.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  And it's just like, wow.
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  Wow.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  What a commitment to darkness.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  What a commitment.
[50:10.000 --> 50:17.000]  I think there's a song that describes it.
[50:17.000 --> 50:24.000]  Will you guys find Dan Ziggs, the stalker?
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  You can find it during the break.
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  We'll play it coming back in.
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  That's what I think.
[50:29.000 --> 50:34.000]  I want to think of Obama and the BLM and all these evil people crouching out.
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.000]  They're good and they want to help you and they want to be nice and they care about the kids.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  They want to slit your throat ear to ear.
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.000]  People like Rachel Maddow just like being in power and thinks she's in charge
[50:44.000 --> 50:49.000]  and has her fake liberal template programming obsessed with, you know, gender.
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  She's just a bot.
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.000]  But the people above her, they are literal.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  Ring Race is the way to describe them.
[50:58.000 --> 51:08.000]  Un-Dead.
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.000]  My name is Jessica Arman.
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  I'm an activist, a GCN listener and mother of three.
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.000]  Our drinking, watering food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums.
[51:41.000 --> 51:46.000]  To protect my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening remedy.
[51:46.000 --> 51:53.000]  My Magic Mud is a soft powder that polishes your teeth, reduces sensitivity and removes harmful toxins from deep inside your mouth.
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  You deserve a bright, healthy smile.
[51:55.000 --> 52:00.000]  Visit MyMagicMud.com and get yours today. That's MyMagicMud.com.
[52:25.000 --> 52:30.000]  Back 9-11 had a lasting impact on our society. This event will reshape America.
[52:30.000 --> 52:37.000]  It will swipe trillions off markets and retirement accounts everywhere and destroy the way of life of millions of unprepared Americans.
[52:37.000 --> 52:42.000]  But it will also trigger what promises to be the biggest wealth transfer in the history of our nation.
[52:42.000 --> 52:48.000]  But you only have a few weeks left to take all the necessary steps to protect yourself and your family.
[52:48.000 --> 52:54.000]  Just visit www.next911exposed2.com to view my newly released video.
[52:54.000 --> 52:59.000]  Again, that's www.next911exposed2.com before it's too late.
[53:24.000 --> 53:31.000]  Every day it becomes more clear our nation is headed towards an uncertain future.
[53:31.000 --> 53:35.000]  Nothing can ensure your family's security like an Atlas survival shelter.
[53:35.000 --> 53:42.000]  The strongest money can buy and designed to be buried up to 42 feet deep with all the comforts of home and all the protection you need.
[53:42.000 --> 53:48.000]  Bulletproof patches, tamper resistant air pipes and a unique ground design that'll withstand a bomb.
[53:48.000 --> 53:55.000]  See them today at IWantThatBunker.com or call 1-855-4-Bunker.
[53:55.000 --> 54:20.000]  I dedicate this song to the New World Order.
[54:20.000 --> 54:31.000]  No one sees my face, sees me coming.
[54:31.000 --> 54:43.000]  You can never hide, if I want you.
[54:43.000 --> 54:51.000]  You can't even try, keep from crying.
[55:14.000 --> 55:21.000]  No one sees the New World Order's face in the darkness, no one sees their shape.
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  Tell a little bit more of it.
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.000]  And I'll tell you the other news that's coming up.
[55:31.000 --> 55:38.000]  You hear that spirit? That's the New World Order, crouching in the dark.
[55:38.000 --> 55:46.000]  No one sees my face, sees my face.
[55:46.000 --> 55:56.000]  That YouTube version's a little distorted, but the song's distorted on purpose.
[55:56.000 --> 56:07.000]  I can see it in the blackness.
[56:07.000 --> 56:11.000]  I can feel it when it's stalking me.
[56:11.000 --> 56:19.000]  A lot of people get excited by that.
[56:19.000 --> 56:26.000]  Alright folks, let me tell you what's coming up.
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  I'm gonna try to open the phones up.
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.000]  It's just so upsetting to see how we've been overrun at Waco, overrun at Ruby Ridge,
[56:34.000 --> 56:39.000]  overrun thousands of times. They're trained in the police and military to fight the American people openly.
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.000]  It's total treason. They're gutting the country, shutting down our industries,
[56:43.000 --> 56:48.000]  bankrupting everything the globalists don't own, a total ruthless siege.
[56:48.000 --> 56:55.000]  And then finally, a vestigial remnant of people act a little bit like our forebearers did
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.000]  and get beat up and attacked so more people show up and they get beat up and attacked,
[57:00.000 --> 57:06.000]  and they never show up and say, alright, we're marching in and you say you're gonna shoot us, go ahead and do it.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  And that is incredible, they would say, come across that line, we're gonna shoot you.
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.000]  I mean, they were so cowardly, they were so scared of citizens that instead of even talking to them,
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.000]  they were saying we're gonna shoot you. And then once they walked up to them, then they talked to them.
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.000]  And they blinked and they backed off and it shows they're afraid.
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.000]  That's why they dress up like Cobra Commander to try to scare us.
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  Well, let me tell you something, dressing up like Cobra Commander and driving around in black armored vehicles does not scare me.
[57:33.000 --> 57:41.000]  It scares me that I'm not doing enough to fight you. It scares me that I'm a coward and that I'm not doing enough.
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.000]  And you know, you've got people saying that I'm calling for violence, I'm not.
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.000]  The globalists are coming down on us with violent taxation, the power to tax and the power to destroy.
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  The globalists are coming down on our families, they're coming down on us medically.
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.000]  Obamacare is the biggest screw job ever to mint to bankrupt this country on record.
[57:57.000 --> 58:02.000]  And the guy that helped write it, Ezekiel Emanuel, admits it's meant to destroy the system.
[58:02.000 --> 58:08.000]  That is a criminal conspiracy. The federal judge said of the BLM this year in a ruling.
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.000]  And last year, it was last year, actually it was in December, we read part of the ruling yesterday
[58:12.000 --> 58:17.000]  that the BLM is part of a criminal conspiracy to bankrupt ranchers.
[58:17.000 --> 58:26.000]  Hey, pay your fair share, free-loading lazy seventh generation rancher in the desert.
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  When they've run everybody out of business and it's all fraud.
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  You can have a coal power plant, we're just going to bankrupt you.
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  Don't you people get it? You're under attack.
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  I don't know what we should do, but admit you're under attack.
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.000]  Admit this government's a foreign occupation force.
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.000]  Absolutely fact. No debate. Suck it as dry in the dark.
[58:44.000 --> 58:49.000]  Suck in our blood. To hell with Nosferatu. To hell with the New World Order.
[59:15.000 --> 59:19.000]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicists.
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  To learn more, visit InfowarsHealth.com.

[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  The minions of the system are now figuring out how expendable they are.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  They're now being threatened at the highest levels that if they don't get in line,
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  they'll be blamed for the terror attacks that are coming.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  And so their response is, get ready to blame Alex Jones.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  I guess I'm not going to sell out.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  I can't. Don't know how.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  Don't know how. Can't sell out.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  Can't sell out to death.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  Can't sell out to betrayal and treason.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Can't sell out to cowardice. Just can't do it.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  Not a question of courage. I just can't do it.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  Can't lie to you in the face of madness.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  And if you hear me and it sounds mad, it is mad.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  I am a tortured soul infuriated by the insanity and evil of the world.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  And you see in my eyes the reflection of what I'm looking at.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  What's that quote?
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  I sent it out on Twitter about a month ago.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  That madness is seeing a world full of just total fraud.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  I don't know. It was a tweet.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  Going to my Twitter, real Alex Jones and just control left or do it.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  Real Alex Jones, NSA, Google search.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  That's what it is, NSA interface.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  Do a Google NSA interface with the term.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  We've changed the language, folks, to be honest.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  It's not a defense department.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  It's a global extermination eugenics hydro program.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  Specter, whatever cartoon term you want to call it.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  The average troops are good people, but it's captured and run by the New World Order.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  Do a search for real, just put in real Alex Jones Twitter into the Google search
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  and then put madness and it'll bring up the tweet.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  That's all you do.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  I get obsessed with being able to use an NSA interface.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  Because the NSA is the internet. DARPA is the internet, folks.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  We need to get down to that point.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  I'm going to come back and get all the news on Snowden and give the number out
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  and take your calls and everything.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  But I'm going to go ahead and pull this up.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  There it is. What's madness? That was quick, guys. Good job.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  What's madness but nobility of soul at odds with circumstances, the days on fire.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  And that was Theodore. How do you pronounce that?
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  How do you say that?
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  Rothke. Theodore Rothke.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  What's madness but nobility of the soul at odds with circumstance, the days on fire.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  And they tell you if your life's on fire, if you paint beautiful paintings,
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  if you write incredible poetry, if you run around and dip your head in ice water
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  when you're deaf and stay up for three days without stimulants, writing Beethoven symphonies.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  That's schizophrenia. That's mental illness. That's bipolar. That's a disease.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  Beethoven needed to be in a mental institution.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  He didn't commit crimes. He was a loving person that took care of people in his church.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  He was a great man in the community. He was bad.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  And let me tell you something, folks. You know who else is bad?
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  Andy. He's bad seven generations with the fake grazing fees that just started
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  running everybody out of business claiming they don't have any right to the land
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  with the globalists and their paramilitary out there killing people.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  Rachel Maddow is right and so is Glenn Beck.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  They should stand down and we should let government do whatever it wants on every front.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  In fact, we should have forced abortions and one-child policy in this country
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  because the people that run our government fund that worldwide.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  You want to know what the new lawyer has in store for us?
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  Look what they do where they have helpless people like Africa or China
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  where the globalists are running something where they can do what they want.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  They create soilent grain.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  Foster children, 70% now, well, 68%, 70% nationally, look it up,
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  are on psychotropic drugs and an average of seven of them.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  IRS confirms abortions are eligible or tax deduction.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  Hey, but don't worry, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to have to pay through Obamacare
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  or other people's abortions.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  And if you live in Travis County or Austin Zett, you pay for people's abortions as well.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  Why not? You should have to pay to kill babies.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a two-ounce bottle
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  and it's not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  within a base of DINI's water for your preparedness storage

[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  from harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins and waters and breads and toothpaste.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  It's time to take action.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time,
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  All the major networks are state-run.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents,
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  We are the true media.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  Transmitting globally from Austin, Texas in FEMA Region 6.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  That sounds incredibly creepy, but it's true.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  A giant paramilitary army that works for foreign banks has just put in the biggest tax increase in world history,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  known as Obamacare, to be paid directly to offshore banks than on the insurance companies.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  We have always been paying taxes since 1913, directly to the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  And they call this Obamacare, federal care.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  It's not. It's total fascism.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  And real liberals like Cynthia McKinney come on and say,
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  I'm now pro-gun and Obamacare is fascism.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  Because anybody who is truthful looks at it as it is.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  I don't look at Obama and say, I don't like that black guy.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  In fact, I am so politically correct and so weak-minded, and everybody heard this during the election,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  and I hate McCain so much, because he's such a snake, that I said Obama's bad, his advisors are bad,
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  but maybe the elite don't want revolution, and, you know, maybe, I'm just so stupid.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  Maybe this will create more racial reconciliation.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  That's how dumb I was seven, eight years ago.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  And we've all been naive, but as smart as I was and informed,
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  I had no idea how evil Obama was and the people behind him.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  I mean, he's the closer, the race-baiting of MSNBC, the division,
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  just the over-the-top of the political system pulling out all the stops.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  I mean, it's so naked.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  And I didn't support Obama for president, neither did Joseph Farah.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  He wrote none of the above.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  He wrote a best-selling book and said it's time to not support either party till the Republicans get reformed.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  And in a way, that was true, because you've seen a real Tea Party now.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  You've seen them try to take it over, you've seen them try to destroy it, demonize it, whatever.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  But you're seeing a libertarian constitutionalist movement grow out of the fact that we didn't support the Republicans,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  and Obama went in, and he's been so horrible that people are running back over to the Republicans.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  But that'll be total disaster if we don't overthrow the Republican Party.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  And get people in there that love their grandkids and their children.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  I mean, folks, we're going down, okay?
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  I mean, this country's going the Soviet Union route on steroids with a high-tech integration.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  I mean, I've never even dreamed of anything in science fiction like we're facing,
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  because reality is so much thicker and so much more complex and real.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  And you've got the elite-going megalomaniac right now.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  It's unbelievable.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  I mean, I get chills just thinking about the global meltdown, the derivatives, the Ukraine situation.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  We told you three years ago with Gerald Salente and Ron Paul and others,
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  watch, they'll start a big war when the derivatives start unraveling,
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  and the stock market will start going up and down.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  And it's all rigged, and now even Rolling Stone says the stock market's totally rigged,
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  the insurance is totally rigged, the interest rates are rigged.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  It's all rigged. The gold price is rigged.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  But how long can they rig everything and tell us everything's wonderful
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  and tell us everything's pumpkin pie when it's a rotten, dead dog?
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  Yeah, there's the Rolling Stone headline. Everything's rigged.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  The biggest price-fixing scandal ever.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  I don't agree it's the biggest ever, but libel or all of it,
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  everything Bob Chapman told you here 16 years ago that God rest his soul.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  Everything we told you, everything.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  And let me explain why. Government and tyranny is pathological.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  They do the same thing over and over again.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  Except you look at the new models of technology and the pre-singularities that are happening,
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  the proto-singularities that are smaller models of greater singularities,
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  and it is going to be spectacular.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  I'm not a thrill-seeker for thrills, but once I'm in a fight, I don't mind one.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  And I got to be honest with you, if there weren't innocence being destroyed and all this,
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  I'm not afraid.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  I just don't like watching innocence destroyed by this,
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  and I don't like watching my children live in it,
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  but I still doubled down and had children as a commitment into the world
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  to put everything in for life.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  And I intend to have more children.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  I'm going to have children, and I'm going to have my children,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  and I'm going to put them in God's hands, and I'm going to fight that much harder.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  I'm not going to give up, they tell me give up, they tell you give up,
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  they tell you humans are ugly and bad and they're worthless,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  so that you will believe that you should just lay down and die in a ditch.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  We can't let these evil people, you love the earth, you love God's creation,
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  or you don't believe in God, you love the creation, I love it too.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  I think it's beautiful, it's wonderful, it's a great work of art.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  A living, breathing work of art.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  The globalists are killing the planet for real.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  And while you're worried about carbon dioxide, the plants breathe,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  that's at one of the lowest levels in history,
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  according to the ice samples and the mud samples, that's a fact.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  Did you know that CO2 has been 14, 15 times higher than it is now?
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  It's a trace gas that the plants live off of, and we're losing atmosphere into space.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  The oxygen and carbon dioxide level is dropping overall,
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  if you look at the last 100,000 years.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  We don't really know how old this planet is, we don't really know what's going on.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  We don't know the true history, and I don't pretend to know it.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  But I know this, the great quickening is here.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  And quite frankly, I don't like being out at a restaurant that's mainly white people,
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  and then to see black folks at the restaurant having a good time,
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  and you can tell that they feel insecure if you even look at them.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  And that's the culture, that's MSNBC, that's all this race-baiting.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  And I was just thinking of petty things that don't matter, it's stuff like that.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  While the whole earth's been killed by an absolutely satanic evil,
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  even if we believe in God, it doesn't matter, the archetype.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  We are worried about what color somebody's skin is.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  We are worried about, you know, do we use the word bossy?
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  Because women are being told they should feel insulted to hear the word bossy.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  You're being told to be upset about things that don't matter,
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  and to have thin skins with each other, and to be all divided,
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  and only thinking about surface issues, so you're all stereotypical mindless idiots,
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  while the globalists are literally assaulting everything.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  I mean, think about what an abomination it is,
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  every time you go into a store and they say,
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  hey, would you like to give a dollar or ten dollars for breast cancer research?
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  And I say, no thank you.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  I'd like to know why the breast cancer is massively increasing.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  Shouldn't we be looking at that?
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  It'd be like, wouldn't you like to give a donation for this flooded town that hasn't flooded yet?
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  Because they're going to blow the dam up next week and flood the town?
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  They're going to give a donation to rebuild the town?
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  No, why are you going to blow the dam up?
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  I mean, it's the elephant in the room, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  that the government is completely insane, completely out of control,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  captained by a bunch of competing criminals
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  who've bought into a transhumanist eugenicist fairy tale pipe dream
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  that they're going to live forever and be gods,
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  and they're openly telling everyone this,
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  that we'll just squash you like a bug and the general public doesn't count
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  and you will be assimilated or it doesn't matter.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  I mean, these are quotes by Google representatives,
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  not just on TV. When we went down to South by Southwest,
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  they had them walking around by the hundreds.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  An invasion force saying, it is inevitable.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  You cannot stop it. The cars will drive themselves and be safer
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  and you will merge with machines or you won't even be able to communicate with anyone.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  We will have intelligence as much more advanced.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  You don't have the intelligence to know the technology is being forged
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  in anti-human corruption and exterminism.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  You don't have the intelligence to know it's being built
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  as a human wrecking machine and the fruits of it are pure stinking death
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  and you want to tell me with your bright-eyed cult look in your eyes
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  that nilly look that all these programmed men have,
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  that Jezebel spirit, you want to look me in the eye
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  and tell me it's inevitable.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  You want to sit there and roll over dead in front of me
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  and tell me to crawl in the ditch with you and die.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  I'm not going to do it. I'm not suicidal.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  I love life. I want life.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  So much I'm ready to go up against evil 100% because there isn't a choice.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  It isn't some heroic thing to fight these people.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  These people are committed to 100% evil.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  And do you know why?
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  Because when you start giving in to evil, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  you give in to the next level and the next level and the next level
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  until the very worst in the society is the leader.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  And they then set the precedent and a new evil evolves
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  that replaces them that's even worse.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  That's social Darwinism in the culture of evil.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  And I don't compare myself to somebody like Saul of Tarsus or Paul
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  who murdered people and persecuted people and hunted down Christians
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  and then got knocked from his horse and literally set straight
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  and became one of the greatest leaders in the Bible
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  and is a real historical figure. He's in the Roman histories.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  But I will tell you that in my mind, in my heart,
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  I was a very loving, good child.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  But when I became a teenager, even in a young adulthood,
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  I had a struggle between good and evil.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  And I know the ideas and the dreams of the enemy.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  That's why I'm here. I don't know why I got close to evil.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  But I did, and I know now that's part of the larger plan
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  of experience in life, in God's plan, the universe's plan,
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  however you see it, that there's a reason I know the enemy.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  There's a reason that in my experience all these things happened.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  And it was so I could today, in my development, in your development,
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  life's not a destination, it is the adventure.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  And I know the enemy. I know what they stand for.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  I know I'm right. And it's all manifest now out in the open.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  If you work for the system and you're on a power trip
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  because you felt weak in your life and you joined evil
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  and you joined corruption and you lied to yourself
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  thinking you're tired of losing, you wanted to get ahead,
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  you will lose everything joining this.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  You will lose your honor, your children, your future.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  It's all coming to a head.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  It's judgment. Judgment day is coming.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  We're all being judged every day.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  It's been said those who control the food control the people.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  and the inability to think clearly.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods and toxic chemicals
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
