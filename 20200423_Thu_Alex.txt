[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  Problem reaction solution was defined by the philosopher Hegel more than 200 years ago,
[00:14.000 --> 00:20.000]  but he didn't invent it. He just quantified it into philosophy. That's why we see so
[00:20.000 --> 00:30.000]  many episodes, the Simpsons from decades ago, this one from 1993, coming true today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires. We're here to come
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.400]  up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong, and dark
[00:39.400 --> 00:42.500]  rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.
[00:42.500 --> 00:43.500]  Well, I think...
[00:43.500 --> 00:49.000]  NBC, you are here to listen and not speak. I think we should go with a good old-fashioned
[00:49.000 --> 00:50.000]  story.
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  A new disease. No one's immune. It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  a shark, it's an epidemic, and instead of summer, it's all the time.
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.000]  Now, I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  He loves being that guy.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  But, Janice, we do have standards. This can't be a made-up disease. The only moral thing
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested. Get over here, NBC.
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I...
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  Wow. Wow.
[01:28.000 --> 01:29.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  Now, we just have to blame it on something that's in every household, something that people
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  are a little bit afraid of already.
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.000]  House cat flu is coming, people. The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  that the house cat flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[01:49.000 --> 01:56.000]  So, better beware that warm body on your lap just might be ready to destroy your tender fiddles.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information if they experience any of the following symptoms.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  Mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night.
[02:13.000 --> 02:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, April 23rd transmission.
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  There's so many huge things to cover, as usual, but it's more intense than ever.
[02:25.000 --> 02:33.000]  The quickening works that way that I am at a loss for words yet again of where to start.
[02:33.000 --> 02:42.000]  You know, I've been aware of something for a very long, long time, and I've talked about it some.
[02:42.000 --> 02:55.000]  I've done my duty and talked about it, and I've turned down a lot of money from folks that have come along to sell out to them.
[02:55.000 --> 03:07.000]  But you know, not selling out yourself is one thing, but if you don't expose other people that have sold out, aren't you kind of selling out yourself in a way?
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.000]  The only thing I've got is my integrity, but that's another issue.
[03:13.000 --> 03:23.000]  This is so big, and it ties into everything, and it's like a rosetta stone, a skeleton key, a window into the universe.
[03:23.000 --> 03:32.000]  And I was sitting there for a few months ago with all these huge things I was going to cover, and then I thought to myself, why don't you talk about this?
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  Why don't you talk about this?
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  And what is this?
[03:37.000 --> 03:45.000]  Well, this is a key that opens the door that frees America and the world.
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.000]  And there are many doors this key opens as well.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  And it's not that I'm scared to cover this topic.
[03:57.000 --> 04:10.000]  It's just that if I just come out and put it out there, mixed in with all the other big things we're talking about, it gets lost in the shuffle, doesn't it?
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  They always say if a tree fell in the woods and nobody was there to hear it, would it make a sound?
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  How about you're in the forest and all the trees are falling down?
[04:19.000 --> 04:28.000]  And it's just a den, a cacophony, and you don't hear that one important note, though.
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  The Tree of Liberty is dying.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  Let me just say this, I am certainly not bored.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  This is the most incredible time ever to be alive.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  It's just going to get wilder from here.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  This adventure is real.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  This is not a simulation, and it's just going to get more amazing from here on out.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  I'm going to launch in 60 seconds when we come back.
[04:50.000 --> 05:19.000]  I'm going to lay it all out straight ahead and stay with us.
[05:20.000 --> 05:26.000]  They create stagnation, corruption, tyranny, and then finally collapse.
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  And the world is now being tested.
[05:30.000 --> 05:36.000]  We're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole lives believing
[05:36.000 --> 05:42.000]  if they just submit now in a bigger way, somehow they'll create a heavenly future.
[05:42.000 --> 05:50.000]  But the technocrats running the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  and are building an anti-human future.
[05:52.000 --> 06:00.000]  Submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[06:00.000 --> 06:16.000]  Another world, another time, in the age of wonder.
[06:16.000 --> 06:24.000]  Another world, another time, is like a screen in wood.
[06:24.000 --> 06:31.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[06:31.000 --> 06:42.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:42.000 --> 06:48.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this April 23rd Thursday global transmission with 193 out
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.000]  from the election that looks like they're going to probably cancel.
[06:51.000 --> 06:59.000]  And we have a lot of big irons in the fire that are all caused by the same thing.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  And so here's a headline that really gave me an epiphany.
[07:03.000 --> 07:11.000]  One in Guardian, coronavirus pandemic will cause famine of biblical proportions
[07:11.000 --> 07:18.000]  between 30 and 100 million set to starve to death in the next 18 months.
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  Now, that's an incredibly deceptive headline.
[07:21.000 --> 07:29.000]  The coronavirus lockdown.
[07:29.000 --> 07:48.000]  L-O-C-K-D-O-W-N-E, coronavirus lock.
[07:48.000 --> 08:02.000]  Coronavirus lockdown will cause famine of biblical proportions.
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  Think about that.
[08:05.000 --> 08:15.000]  And think about the Attorney General coming out and saying this is a form of house arrest.
[08:15.000 --> 08:21.000]  House arrest.
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  And now San Francisco is closing many of its major streets.
[08:26.000 --> 08:43.000]  This is another condition of martial law to train you to accept all of this evil.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  This is a lockdown.
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.000]  But the definition right here, what happens when you're in a prison?
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  And it's when you've had your commons time and you've been able to go outside in a minimum or medium security prison.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  And the lockdown is when you're put back inside your jail cells for night.
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  Lockdown, L-O-C-K-D-O-W-N.
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  And it goes down, down, down.
[09:09.000 --> 09:23.000]  The confining of prisoners to their cells, typically after an escape or a regain control of a riot, a state of isolation or restricted access.
[09:23.000 --> 09:31.000]  Initiated as a security measure, the university is on lockdown and nobody has been able to leave.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  It's called martial law.
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  It's called the definition of a blockade.
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  The form of war, blockade.
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.000]  The isolation of a warring nation of an enemy area.
[09:47.000 --> 10:03.000]  This is a harbor by troops or warships to prevent passage of persons or supplies broadly as restrictive measures designed to obstruct commerce communications of an unfriendly nation.
[10:03.000 --> 10:15.000]  Let me just tell you what's coming up today during this lockdown.
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  Lockdown.
[10:20.000 --> 10:40.000]  We have the leader of the Senate coming out that controls the purse strings saying, we know the left wants to bankrupt the country to bring in total control and that they all want bailouts that they'll steal.
[10:40.000 --> 11:02.000]  But if you want to keep the country locked down and you cause the total depression that's already here, how deep and bad it gets and how long is now being determined, we're in it now.
[11:02.000 --> 11:18.000]  Instead of you want that, you're going to just have to declare bankruptcy because we told you you were in charge of this and you just say we're never opening again and already your pension funds are going bad and already you're falling apart and all the rest of this is happening.
[11:18.000 --> 11:24.000]  So we're going to cover that.
[11:24.000 --> 11:39.000]  And we're going to cover the United Nations and the really big news and my message to the president that tens of millions of people are starving to death and starting to die right now because of this, but it's not fashionable.
[11:39.000 --> 12:00.000]  It's not cool. It's not heroic to care about them. It's more important to salivate over every COVID-19 death, even if it's a 90 year old person with heart failure or just have convulsions of glee and orgasms over somebody that dies in a car wreck but test positive COVID-19 and just fetishizing the death and arguing with those of us that say this is a
[12:00.000 --> 12:13.000]  Psyop to make us go into a depression. That's all admitted. But none of those telling you that this virus is the most deadly thing to ever hit the planet. And we could never leave lockdown.
[12:13.000 --> 12:24.000]  None of them will discuss the mass starvation and death. It's now unfolding, including the Pope, because the microchip and the forced inoculation, that's all gravy for Bill Gates.
[12:24.000 --> 12:47.000]  But currently the shutdown, the lockdown is putting the world into a cardiac arrest. 185,000 people have died supposedly from this virus.
[12:47.000 --> 13:02.000]  The test as the regular flu virus or the regular cold virus. Yeah, the flu is also making false positives. So clearly there's an agenda to overblow the numbers and we know from the start, they said 5 million dead.
[13:02.000 --> 13:24.000]  And thus you do what we say, then only 2 million will die in America. And then it was 2 million. But we say only 100,000. And now it's 2,659,000 worldwide. We're told these faulty tests created by an American woman named Daniel Anderson that works at the Wuhan lab, who also runs fact checking for Facebook on the
[13:24.000 --> 13:40.000]  same story. It's not a conflict of interest. And as the numbers go up, as the testing increases, we learn it's a very small morbidity number. But still, when you talk about the people go, oh, you don't care about the thousands dying every day in America,
[13:40.000 --> 13:57.000]  like thousands die of car wrecks, thousands die of heart attacks, thousands die of cancer, thousands die of flu. It is a Psyop the way they're fear mongering and it's come out. It's a Psyop. And that's really the big news I'm going to hit.
[13:57.000 --> 14:17.000]  That now what's left of the American government, the American people, understand this is a deep state CHICOM operation to create fear and it's coming out. What was already known that this has been financed and this has been paid for and this has been prepared by the globalist using China as a cut out to cover the
[14:17.000 --> 14:36.000]  funding to create total absolute fear. And now it's even in the New York Times of all places, what I told you months ago, the communist Chinese are paying for the hype, saying it's the most deadly virus on earth. Obviously they stage most of those videos that
[14:36.000 --> 14:49.000]  take. Obviously they pushed all that fear and now it's come out to devastate our economy. That's how they tried to defeat us when we won the trade war. And the question is, will they defeat us? That fight is ongoing right now.
[14:49.000 --> 15:08.000]  But here's the headline Chinese agents help spread messages that sowed virus panic in the United States. The CIA says. Well, I watched Twitter and Facebook and Google push official Chinese government propaganda while Americans were banned everywhere
[15:08.000 --> 15:24.000]  while videos of Alex Jones and Rush Limbaugh saying it was being overhyped, were being banned saying you're not the WHO, you don't have speech dirty American. The UN on the payroll of the CHICOMs helping cover up the lab release, they have speech, you don't.
[15:24.000 --> 15:45.000]  And the head of YouTube went on Brian Sculter show, unreliable sources this weekend and said, anyone disagreeing with the United Nations will be banned. So just like that, the UN through big tech overseers tells Americans what they can and can't say.
[15:45.000 --> 15:55.000]  Wow, that's even worse than I thought it would be at this point. They're just walking all over us because we put up with it, but not for much longer.
[16:16.000 --> 16:25.000]  Our CBD is derived from organic hemp grown in the USA and third party tested veterans vitality CBD saves you as much as 25 to 50% over our competition.

[17:18.000 --> 17:31.000]  It's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns are just a few days away here in the US. Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce, you can still get enough open pollinated heirloom seeds to grow a one acre crisis garden.
[17:31.000 --> 17:38.000]  The truth is, growing nutrient dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single most important thing you do.

[17:59.000 --> 18:11.000]  The America that we've known and loved, the America that was the land of the free home of the brave is dying right now. And everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us, shutting us down and making us dependent on them.
[18:11.000 --> 18:19.000]  The food shortages have begun. The depression is going to be long and very, very serious. In fact, it's probably too late now to even turn back.
[18:19.000 --> 18:29.000]  Trump tried to stop it, but the mainstream media working with the tri-coms blocked it. That's why you and myself, everybody else, has to get prepared now. Do not wait.
[18:29.000 --> 18:35.000]  It's not about the virus. It's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year. Get your high quality, sourable foods.
[18:35.000 --> 18:43.000]  And in FullWareShort.com, they're available again before a limited time. The food supply is running out. There are major shortages.
[18:43.000 --> 18:53.000]  This is a globalist siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism. But we the people, the patriots, have to be prepared. We've already been proven right about prepping so far.
[18:53.000 --> 19:17.000]  We'll get ready to be really proven right. Get your sourable foods now at infowarstort.com.
[19:23.000 --> 19:31.000]  With Bill Gates involved, are now the ones running the operation to shut down society, create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody. This is insane.
[19:31.000 --> 19:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over. You need to get prepared now. You need to get high quality, sourable food now back in stock at infowarstort.com.
[19:40.000 --> 19:50.000]  And you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere. Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[19:50.000 --> 20:01.000]  This is beyond 1984. The tyranny of the dual orders here. Get prepared now and spread the word in the info war. You are the Paul Reverez.
[20:01.000 --> 20:19.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:19.000 --> 20:36.000]  What's next for the coronavirus maelstrom? Meat shortages. Bloomberg is reporting hundreds of National Guard personnel are being activated in Iowa as coronavirus sweeps through meat processing plants in a state that accounts for about a third of U.S. pork supply.
[20:36.000 --> 20:54.000]  Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said 250 National Guard members have been moved to full time federal duty status and could help with testing and contact tracing for workers at plants operated by Tyson Foods Incorporated and National Beef Packing Company.
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  As the meat packing plants affected are stacking up nationwide.
[20:58.000 --> 21:12.000]  Coronavirus cases in Iowa's Black Hawk County have doubled in recent days to 356 and public health officials say 90% trace back to employees at this Tyson Meat Packing Plant.
[21:12.000 --> 21:25.000]  Their outbreak is not an isolated case. CBS News has confirmed COVID cases in at least 17 meat processing plants in 10 states, 13 of which have temporarily closed or operating at reduced capacity.
[21:25.000 --> 21:40.000]  Back in 2013 when President Obama was reengineering U.S.-China relations to reflect the emerging Chinese century, Obama made statements like the one published by the left-leaning think tank Brookings Institution stating,
[21:40.000 --> 21:59.000]  Obama understands that leadership comes with a price and thus the United States cannot have leadership without strength. At the same time, he recognizes that the United States, quote, must be aware of the rise of emerging economies and its impact on the new world order and quote.
[21:59.000 --> 22:08.000]  Part of this era of Chinese handouts included the buyout of Smithfield Packing Company, the largest pig and pork producer in the world.
[22:08.000 --> 22:16.000]  As folks, it's 300 years of tradition and taste you savor when you ask for a Smithfield barbecue James River brand at our refreshment center.
[22:16.000 --> 22:45.000]  Bought out by what was then known as Shanghai Group for 4.72 billion in 2013, it was the largest Chinese acquisition of an American company to date. The acquisition of Smithfield's 146,000 acres of land made Shanghai Group headquartered in China's Hainan Province, one of the largest overseas owners of American farmland in the world.
[22:45.000 --> 22:56.000]  In addition to owning over 500 farms in the U.S., Smithfield contracts with another 2,000 independent farms around the country to grow Smithfield's famous holiday hams.
[22:56.000 --> 23:15.000]  Is the food supply going to be protected? At the end of the day, is China going to pick the Chinese versus America? Because they'll now control what percentage of the U.S. pork production. There'll be a very large percentage.
[23:15.000 --> 23:29.000]  With your constituents back home, it's the same old Smithfield. Nothing's going to change. This is going to be an American company. We're going to continue to operate like an American company and we're going to continue to protect these brands.
[23:29.000 --> 23:48.000]  Shanghai is buying Smithfield for its brand name and to assuage the horrible reputation that China has so far as food production goes and exports the food. It's gene technology. Competitors will now be dealing with a Shanghai Smithfield that's as inscrutable as any other Chinese company.
[23:48.000 --> 23:58.000]  Any sorts of information will not be made public, for example. It'll go through that morass of Chinese dissemination.
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  China's looking at this as an opportunity to feed their people.
[24:01.000 --> 24:16.000]  One of the concerns or questions I have is whether or not your brand, which will be put on Chinese pork, which has been less than stellar and is going to be a problem for your brand down the road.
[24:16.000 --> 24:25.000]  I have spoken to people in China and this acquisition is being very carefully monitored. There are other companies that are waiting in the wings to buy more companies.
[24:25.000 --> 24:39.000]  However, as Reuters reported, Arnold Silver Smithfield's director of raw materials procurement said at a recent industry conference that sales to China could eventually create bacon and ham shortages for American consumers.
[24:39.000 --> 24:51.000]  The outbreak of African swine fever has killed up to half of China's hog herds since August of 2018 and pushed prices so high that Chinese importers are willing to pay hefty tariffs.
[24:51.000 --> 24:59.000]  U.S. pork producers say China's losses from the disease have created a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for sales.
[24:59.000 --> 25:11.000]  Officials in Shanghai are weighing in on the effects of thousands of dead pigs that have been discovered over the course of last week and they've admitted that the quality of the drinking water was in fact affected.
[25:11.000 --> 25:21.000]  Shanghai authorities are going back on statements last week that the water in this river is safe to drink. More than 9,000 pigs have now been found floating down the Huangpu River.
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.000]  Initial water samples revealed trace amounts of a common pig virus, the Novo coronavirus.
[25:26.000 --> 25:32.000]  Shanghui could insert local hogs and re-export processed food back to the U.S. under the Smithfield brand.
[25:32.000 --> 25:40.000]  The shipping off of American pork to China during a pandemic caused by the Chinese shouldn't sit well with any American.
[25:40.000 --> 25:53.000]  But now the World Food Program analysis shows also due to the coronavirus that an additional 130 million people could be pushed to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020.
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.000]  That's a total of 265 million people.
[25:57.000 --> 26:10.000]  Meanwhile, China just reported another case of African swine fever, just one in a dozen cases in the last two months, devastating the Chinese herd and increasing demand from U.S. pig farms.
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  And now the Chinese coronavirus threatens American food producers.
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  China's coronavirus is nothing short of an act of war disguised in no fault propaganda.
[26:21.000 --> 26:30.000]  Putting millions out of work, decimating small businesses, bringing our education system to a standstill and undermining our food supply.
[26:30.000 --> 26:54.000]  While China openly celebrates the death of American democracy, John Bown reported.
[26:54.000 --> 27:01.000]  Every single day, patients are lining up outside here, many of them with cold and flu-like symptoms. They come here to be tested.
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.000]  This is bad. People are dying. We don't have the tools that we need.
[27:07.000 --> 27:17.000]  People waiting in the cold to get care. The hospital tells us every day they're working to increase the capacity of this hospital by flooding it with nurses and doctors and equipment.
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.000]  Outside, it's swamp with New Yorkers waiting in long lines to get tested for the coronavirus.
[27:23.000 --> 27:30.000]  This is the emergency room, and you would expect, if you believe the mainstream media, that this emergency room would be overflowing with people.
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  And as you can tell, there are no people here.
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  America is not prepared, and nurses are not being protected.
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.000]  Coronavirus. She's real. She's getting real.
[27:44.000 --> 27:58.000]  I quit my job today. I went into work, and I was assigned to a COVID patient on an ICU unit that has been converted to a designated COVID unit.
[27:58.000 --> 27:59.000]  It's like a war zone.
[27:59.000 --> 28:06.000]  None of the nurses are wearing masks, not even surgical masks, in the hallways when they're giving reports to each other.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  Everybody is terrified.
[28:08.000 --> 28:16.000]  I had my own N95 mask. I told my manager I understand we're short on supplies, but let me protect myself.
[28:16.000 --> 28:26.000]  Let me feel safe. I have family that I have to come home to, and the way things are looking, this isn't going to get any better.
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  America is not prepared, and nurses are not being protected.
[28:31.000 --> 28:39.000]  I'm so worried.
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.000]  I'm so worried.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  Get the wheel. Get the wheel.
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  Big, big booty, what you want, a big booty.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  Big, big booty, what you want, a big booty.
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  Big booty, what you want, a big booty.
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.000]  You can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[29:04.000 --> 29:11.000]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[29:58.000 --> 30:06.000]  Globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[30:06.000 --> 30:19.000]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes, and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[30:19.000 --> 30:30.000]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out, they can simply look at us and say, because, again, you are non-essential.
[30:30.000 --> 30:37.000]  That's what the robots and all of this is about. It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.000]  We can be told to stay on our houses, and after all, shut up.
[30:41.000 --> 30:47.000]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways. It belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that have merged with machines.
[30:47.000 --> 30:53.000]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it? That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[30:53.000 --> 30:58.000]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.

[32:54.000 --> 32:57.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:25.000 --> 33:27.000]  The grid.
[33:28.000 --> 33:31.000]  A digital frontier.
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  I tried to paint your clusters of information as they moved through the computer.
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.000]  What did they look like?
[33:39.000 --> 33:40.000]  Chips.
[33:40.000 --> 33:41.000]  Motorcycles.
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  Where the circuits like freelance.
[33:45.000 --> 33:46.000]  I kept dreaming of them.
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  I thought I'd never see them.
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.000]  And then,
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.000]  One day.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  And once you get in, you never go back.
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  It is April 23rd on this Thursday.
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  Transmission, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[34:08.000 --> 34:19.000]  And the lives of millions and millions and millions of people right now.
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.000]  Their mortal souls are in our hands right now.
[34:26.000 --> 34:35.000]  So we better get out of the comas, get out of the dream state, and get conscious right now because this isn't a drill.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  It's not a simulation.
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.000]  It's the jumping off point into the universe.
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  Alright.
[34:46.000 --> 34:54.000]  More and more, you're probably noticing when we start the broadcast that I hear a lot of the special reports and things and it's, it's, I just keep telling you the truth.
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  I am choking here on air.
[34:56.000 --> 35:07.000]  Because all of the theoreticals, all the things we knew the globalists were planning that we predicted are now here.
[35:08.000 --> 35:16.000]  And we already can't save millions of people that are starving to death and going to die because of this.
[35:16.000 --> 35:27.000]  And the tens of millions that are set to starve to death, and that's really the prime objective of turning the world economy off is to starve hundreds of millions of death.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  And on the one hand, the leftist and the globalists celebrate that and say that's a good thing.
[35:33.000 --> 35:40.000]  And on the other hand, they tell us, do whatever we say, lock down your economy to save a few people when they're the ones locking it down to kill people.
[35:40.000 --> 35:49.000]  And it's so incredibly crystal clear and obvious and admitted and not even debated by them what they're doing.
[35:53.000 --> 35:54.000]  It's mind boggling.
[35:54.000 --> 35:55.000]  It's mind blowing.
[35:56.000 --> 36:05.000]  Imagine you're at the park and there's a neighborhood by the park and there's a waterfall spillway coming off a river into the into the lake.
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  And you're sitting there cooking hot dogs and hamburgers with your kids.
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  It's like, you know, eleven o'clock on a Sunday and you see like a two year old come out from behind a fence at a house.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  You know, who's watching that two year old?
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.000]  You see the two year old run over to the spillway and you see the two year old starting to get in the spillway.
[36:22.000 --> 36:30.000]  You just start running the 200 yards and you see the two year old in the spillway and the two year olds under the water.
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.000]  And, you know, you have the instinct you cared. You ran over there.
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  You jumped in the child sucks in water.
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  They're under water 30 seconds.
[36:40.000 --> 36:48.000]  You get them out, you know, back when you were on the swim team 30 years before you got a fire department basic course on CPR.
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  You pump the water out of their lungs.
[36:52.000 --> 36:53.000]  They cough it up.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  You save them.
[36:54.000 --> 37:02.000]  But imagine seeing that two and a half year old toddler that got out of the unlocked back gate while mama was watching sitcoms or whatever.
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.000]  Her daddy was, you know, tuning up his engine on his race car, whatever was going on the house.
[37:09.000 --> 37:10.000]  Imagine you saw that two year old.
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  He said, oh, there's too many people anyways.
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.000]  And you sat back and you put a big juicy slab of beef with cheese on that bun.
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  Put onions on there.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  Mustard mayo lettuce.
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  Couple of jalapenos.
[37:24.000 --> 37:32.000]  You just sat back and watched that child go in that water and went, I don't care about what happens to that child because there's too many people.
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.000]  That's Bill Gates.
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  But Bill Gates didn't just sit back grilling a hamburger while he watches that.
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  He's the one unlatching the back gate.
[37:47.000 --> 37:56.000]  He's the one midwifing the AI dehumanization takeover.
[38:00.000 --> 38:08.000]  And so people say, man, Jones used to not be as good on air, but it used to be happier.
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.000]  And now he seems crazy and near damn right.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  I'm real crazy now because I read all this.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  And saw them saying all this and I saw them beta testing it.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  And I couldn't believe people didn't stop them.
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  And now they're pulling the trigger going operational.
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  You know, beta phase is over.
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  Beta is over.
[38:31.000 --> 38:45.000]  And now we're into phase one world government AI robot takeover with forced inoculations with a DNA vaccine that alters your DNA and programs you for death.
[38:45.000 --> 38:55.000]  When certain wavelengths are then energized into yourself, they have the patents on that.
[38:55.000 --> 39:05.000]  But you know, I shouldn't be negative because last night I was driving home and I pulled up to a red light.
[39:05.000 --> 39:15.000]  And a black woman in her Ford F 150 rolled down the window and said, we love you, Alex.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  And Bill Gates is going to burn in hell.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  Then this morning.
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  I was walking through a parking lot.
[39:25.000 --> 39:35.000]  And a guy drove by in a plumbing repair truck wasn't a van. It was a truck and he rolls down the window and he goes, F Bill Gates.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  We're winning. Alex, keep it up.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  A good old boy redneck.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  That's in a 24 hour period, folks.
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.000]  And I'm not out on the streets very much.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  I put my head out.
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.000]  People ride by and go Bill Gates is the enemy.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  You are our champion. Destroy him. Well, I'm not your champion. You're your champion.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  Price is your champion. But that's the solace I've got.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  I walk in the office this morning at 8 30.
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.000]  I walk in to the business side of the office. We're doing accounting.
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  And I look at the account and I go, how are you doing? He goes.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  Bill Gates is being destroyed online like no one's ever seen.
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.000]  Everything we've talked about is now openly being discussed. We're winning.
[40:17.000 --> 40:22.000]  And I looked at him and I said, yeah, prepare for the main assault. They're about to attack us really bad.
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.000]  But thanks to the listeners. Thanks to the viewers. Thanks to all the radio stations.
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  Thanks to Matt Drudge, whatever he did back in the past, helping us get this point.
[40:30.000 --> 40:36.000]  You know, it may be another world over there now, but you know, doesn't matter.
[40:36.000 --> 40:43.000]  Thanks to all of you and what you did. We together are in a real fighting position and the globalists are freaked out, man.
[40:43.000 --> 40:48.000]  Because they're coming with the drones. They're coming with the robots. They're coming with the force inoculations.
[40:48.000 --> 40:54.000]  And they and Bill Gates is on TV going 700,000 people are going to die and get sick from my vaccine.
[40:54.000 --> 40:59.000]  He's already he's being sued in Africa and in the subcontinent of India.
[40:59.000 --> 41:07.000]  He's being sued in Russia and Japan by governments because the kids get sick from the vaccines and die.
[41:07.000 --> 41:14.000]  So he's on TV saying we need to get laws passed to indemnify me worldwide talking about Bill Gates.
[41:14.000 --> 41:21.000]  So here's how it's happening. They thought on Good Friday to rub it into Catholics.
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  You said what you want about the Catholic Church and its problems.
[41:25.000 --> 41:30.000]  But the people of the Catholic Church are good people on average that I've met great people.
[41:30.000 --> 41:41.000]  On Good Friday to rub it in your nose to rub your nose in it. They came out and they said we're going to put a satanic high priestess on TV and all this for Microsoft ad.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  Everyone rejected it. They pulled the ad.
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.000]  So again, they keep thinking they're running the old playbook and we're here putting up with it.
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.000]  But we're not.
[41:51.000 --> 42:03.000]  So as as as crazy it is to be in the zeitgeist.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  These globalists would love power.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  They love people to actually listen to them because they're totally cut off.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  It means nothing to just have power for no reason.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  As I become more Christ like and believe me, I'm far from Christ.
[42:15.000 --> 42:18.000]  I realize the pain actually.
[42:18.000 --> 42:31.000]  Because as your consciousness increases and as you become more engaged with the universe at this level with all this evil going on, you can feel and see it and it tortures you.
[42:31.000 --> 42:36.000]  And so you want to fix things that make it good, which is the Christ energy on the earth.
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.000]  But first you've got to feel the pain and I feel the pain now.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  Oh my God, I wanted enlightenment.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  I prayed for it a trillion times.
[42:45.000 --> 42:56.000]  And now as I become closer to it, I could just not even imagine the infinities of pain Christ went through because we're not even a universe away from where Christ went.
[42:56.000 --> 42:57.000]  I could feel the pain.
[42:57.000 --> 43:04.000]  There's a process where you take a stallion and you tie him down and you cut his testicles off and then he becomes gelted.
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.000]  Well, that's what's happening to the entire world right now.
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  We're going into deep, deep tyranny.
[43:09.000 --> 43:22.000]  It's like North Korea and China are going into deep tyranny as well. It's all directed by the U.N. It's all a big, cooked up, giant plan to absolutely take control of your life, bankrupt the economy and make you dependent on the big mega banks.
[43:22.000 --> 43:29.000]  And to get your universal income, you're going to have to take the inoculations, brainwash your kids the way they say and have absolutely no freedom.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  And it's all happening, boom, overnight.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  This is a giant revolution.
[43:33.000 --> 43:41.000]  And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said, oh, it's just an extended spring break, two weeks. Notice now it's 18 months, two years, five years. It never ends.
[43:41.000 --> 43:47.000]  No one can ever die from a virus again. Government will save you. It's a takeover. It's the opposite.
[43:47.000 --> 43:54.000]  They're coming with forced inoculations on record. They'll reduce your fertility, lower your immunity, and in many cases kill you.
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.000]  And they're telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[43:57.000 --> 44:04.000]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[44:04.000 --> 44:30.000]  No.
[44:30.000 --> 44:59.000]  No.
[44:59.000 --> 45:06.000]  Our best selling products is living defense. And it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[45:06.000 --> 45:09.000]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast.
[45:09.000 --> 45:12.000]  And I want those of you that haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself.
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[45:14.000 --> 45:29.000]  Look, in January 2016, I went in the VA hospital out here in Boyce and I was in there until June. And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to Info Wars three hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[45:29.000 --> 45:37.000]  Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.000]  Nobody could figure out what it is. And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional because they don't want you to have a stuff.
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.000]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man.
[45:53.000 --> 45:59.000]  That stuff changed my life. It saved my life. Alex Jones and Info Wars saved my life.
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy used by half.
[46:06.000 --> 46:16.000]  And the United States wouldn't sign on to it. So guess what happened? Along came COVID-19 and Bill Gates is celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half.
[46:16.000 --> 46:20.000]  And that means you're going to be poor now and under his control.
[46:20.000 --> 46:27.000]  And of course, with the medical tyranny comes the force inoculations, a weak microchip that comes with the vaccine and so much more.
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.000]  And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[46:32.000 --> 46:37.000]  So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  The same left that says to kill babies all day long, women own their bodies.
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  Now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.000]  And if you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home, mark the beast.
[46:49.000 --> 46:56.000]  Oh, and guess what? Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates and are a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your face.
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  They hate you and your family.
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:58.000 --> 48:20.000]  We have 160, almost 160 million jobs in this country now, the most ever by far, by far, the most ever, the number of jobs, almost 160 million.
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.000]  So we can't turn that off and think it's going to be wonderful.
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.000]  There'll be tremendous repercussions. There will be a tremendous death from that death.
[48:29.000 --> 48:37.000]  You know, you're talking about death, probably more death from that than anything that we're talking about with respect to the virus.
[48:37.000 --> 48:45.000]  Well, there you go. That was from over five weeks ago.
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.000]  You know, we sit here watching TV, listening to radio.
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  The country has been put into artificial cardiac arrest.
[48:54.000 --> 49:07.000]  And I read these articles, not just by mainstream media, but also read these articles from some called patriotic groups.
[49:07.000 --> 49:13.000]  And they love the publicity that, oh, they're the heroes.
[49:13.000 --> 49:23.000]  They're standing up to the virus and if you just wear the mask and if you just stay indoors and if you just do what you're told while we go into an endless depression, it'll save some lives.
[49:23.000 --> 49:29.000]  And if you don't do that, you're killing people's future.
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  You're a murderer.
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.000]  But the truth is, it's the people pushing this, that are the murderers.
[49:35.000 --> 49:36.000]  It's called triage.
[49:36.000 --> 49:43.000]  You can look that up in medical parlance, in medical nomenclature.
[49:43.000 --> 49:49.000]  And triage is where you've only got so many beds and so many doctors and so much medicine.
[49:49.000 --> 49:58.000]  And so if some, if you walk up and there's 30 people that just got bombed by a truck bomb and some are totally dead, you know, they're dead.
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  Others are flopping around, arms and legs blown off.
[50:01.000 --> 50:08.000]  And you can only help so many, well, you first get to the people you think you can save.
[50:08.000 --> 50:24.000]  And so the whole primary mission of this war-gamed, globalist, worldwide lockdown was to devastate the third world and cause mass starvation and death.
[50:24.000 --> 50:35.000]  And that's now confirmed, the U.N. says it was 2 million a month ago, now we're saying it's 30 million starvation to death, it'll be 100 million starvation to death in the next year and a half if we don't do something, give us money.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  But of course, the United Nations isn't going to help.
[50:37.000 --> 50:43.000]  Here's a shot right here for you if you want an overhead shot.
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  Coronavirus pandemic will cause famine of biblical proportions, but that's not sexy.
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  Nobody's writing about that.
[50:50.000 --> 50:59.000]  Hello there talk show hosts, there's posly patriots aren't, they don't give a damn about African starving to death by the millions or people in the Middle East or Asia or Latin America.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  No, no, no, no.
[51:01.000 --> 51:14.000]  Why, let's put up on the board the global amount of infections and fetishize that when it's based on what did the White House Task Force say.
[51:14.000 --> 51:23.000]  The Fed's classifying all coronavirus patients deaths discovered 19 regardless of cause.
[51:23.000 --> 51:29.000]  Oh, and maybe we can show folks a shot of that.
[51:29.000 --> 51:30.000]  I mean, there that is right there.
[51:30.000 --> 51:36.000]  See, governments classifying all deaths by patients with coronavirus discovered 19 deaths.
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.000]  It's Fox News.
[51:41.000 --> 51:45.000]  Oh, see, that's not sexy wearing a mask getting into the fear.
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.000]  All this is sexy.
[51:46.000 --> 51:47.000]  It's fun.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  It's cool.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  And you're patted on the head and people say, you're a hero.
[51:51.000 --> 52:00.000]  Good job.
[52:00.000 --> 52:01.000]  All right.
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  I'm intended to want to take calls today.
[52:05.000 --> 52:12.000]  We also have a guest joining us and I have not yet done what I came here to do today because this is really, really important information.
[52:12.000 --> 52:23.000]  I got taken off balance by a lot of stuff today and I'm not going to blame anybody here in this office for it, but.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  This is just not normal times.
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  This is not the buildup to the new world order.
[52:27.000 --> 52:40.000]  We have days to turn this around before it's irrevocable worldwide depression and hell on earth and incredibly positive things are happening to that I haven't even gotten to.
[52:40.000 --> 52:47.000]  And there's a lot of hope.
[52:47.000 --> 53:00.000]  But I look at the general public and they have no idea how much trouble they're in or the situation this planet has has entered.
[53:00.000 --> 53:05.000]  But this is a globalist death sentence to the third world.
[53:05.000 --> 53:10.000]  And whereas I don't want to be overrun by the third world who's weaponized and at my wages drop because of them.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  I'm not their enemy.
[53:12.000 --> 53:19.000]  And if you just go, oh, that's the third world and just kind of go along with them being wiped out.
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  That's the ultimate sin right there, folks.
[53:21.000 --> 53:27.000]  It's it's it's it's abortion to the next level.
[53:27.000 --> 53:36.000]  And it's happening right now and this is all part of this globalist satanic seduction that that's taking place right now.
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.000]  So when somebody tells you, oh, we can't open America back up, we've got to keep the economy shut down.
[53:40.000 --> 53:45.000]  Remember, hundreds of millions will end up starving to death in the next few years, 30 million dying right now.
[53:45.000 --> 53:49.000]  And they go, oh, but if we lock everyone down, we'll save thousands.
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  You go, yeah, but millions are dying.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  And they just go, oh, you don't want to save people.
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  I'm with the mainstream media.
[53:55.000 --> 54:03.000]  And they just repeat that six statement back at you because they want the praise of the media and they know they're going to be praised for saying it.
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.000]  AOC says, we need a national work boycott.
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  Yeah, how about folks walk off from the nuclear power plants?
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  How about we have blackouts?
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  How about the reactors blow up?
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  How about folks at the power stations leave?
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  How about folks at the hospitals walk off?
[54:17.000 --> 54:24.000]  This is a communist globalist move to shut the country down and AOC has never been happier.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  Speaking of communism, I'm not a communist.
[54:26.000 --> 54:29.000]  We're funded by viewers and listeners like you.
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  And we have affordable food available again.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  Other companies lie to you and say they have it when they don't.
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  We have it. It's high quality.
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  It's very affordably priced.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  It's the best company out there.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  That's why I went out and got them.
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  Our information is cutting edge.
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.000]  So are our sponsors and our products info or store.com.
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  My patriot runs the back end.
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  They take the orders.
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  You go not ahead of folks.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  You go right in the queue with their orders as well.
[54:52.000 --> 54:53.000]  It's the same group.
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  It's just we're just one of their main or where they're biggest distributor.
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  Actually, they're number one.
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  We're number two.
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.000]  Their next 10 distributors don't even add up to what we do.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  We are second only to the company.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  We are the company and they are awesome.
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.000]  And that's why they're the biggest now is because they're good.
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  And people love their food and it's high quality.
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  And it's very affordably priced.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  So if you've been procrastinating about being self-sufficient,
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  food is the place to start.
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.000]  And you need to get your orders in now because they told me they said,
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  yeah, we're not selling to government or to institutions,
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  but we know there's front groups buying the food up.
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  They've opened now four more plants, not just two more.
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  They got like eight plants now or something.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  And they're just up on overdrive.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  They have to inspect it, all that stuff.
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.000]  And they said, I talked to them a few days ago and they said,
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  well, if it keeps like this in a few weeks,
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  we'll have to pause orders, talk to them this morning.
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  And they said, we might pause orders by next Monday
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  because it's just crazy what's going on.
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  It's absolutely insane what's unfolding.
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.000]  And I don't have a tick fixing my collar.
[55:57.000 --> 56:01.000]  This collar keeps seeing into my jacket.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  It's just time to get swarable food, folks.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  And obviously I'm selling something I believe in.
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  I'm selling something that's pertinent.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  I'm selling something that's high quality for you.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  And I need to stay on air to fund ourselves so it's a win-win.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  But you need swarable food.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  Now is the time to take action.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  And I would get your orders in now before it's too late.
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  I mean, they're talking about the states going bankrupt and it all going down.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  Oil is at 0%.
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  I'm selling snow cones in frickin' hell, man.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  I'm like a snow cone operator in Hades.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  I've got ice cold, delicious snow cones here.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  You need to get these.
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  We will be in the position where you won't even be able to order the food soon.
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  The food lines are already starting.
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  The food banks ran out of food weeks ago.
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  The warehouses are almost empty.
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  The farms are breaking down.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  Most farms are factory now.
[56:44.000 --> 56:47.000]  If two people out of 100 get sick with COVID-19,
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  just show they have a fever.
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.000]  Everyone panics and flops around and pees on themselves
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  and shuts the company down.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  And that chain reaction is just devastating.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  We've been put into an economic cardiac arrest.
[56:59.000 --> 57:03.000]  It is absolutely, totally insane.
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  It is absolutely out of control.
[57:05.000 --> 57:09.000]  And I just want to encourage people while you still can to get swarble foods
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  at mfowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  Whether it's a three month, a six month, a one year, a three year,
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  they've got them all their high quality.
[57:19.000 --> 57:22.000]  They have special diet foods, all of it.
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  But believe me, we're going to be here in a week or two saying no more food sales.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  And then after that, it may not ever be again for a while.
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.000]  I mean, they have engineered a depression, we tried to stop it,
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  and now I'm just moving into defense mode.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  I mean, I finally got out in the country, got the well done,
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  put the trailer out there.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  I mean, I'm already waiting for the lights to go off.
[57:39.000 --> 57:43.000]  I mean, I hope it doesn't happen, but I've never been in defense mode.
[57:43.000 --> 58:09.000]  Just for my children, I'm now moving into defense mode.
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.000]  They'll probably have to suspend orders very, very soon again
[58:18.000 --> 58:23.000]  because the lockdown of the economy is killing food distribution, farming you name it.
[58:23.000 --> 58:28.000]  And now it's mainstream news that food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen.
[58:28.000 --> 58:34.000]  If Trump can turn the economy back on and rest control of our system away from the globalist,
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  things may be okay, but it looks like it's going to get very, very rough.
[58:38.000 --> 58:42.000]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to secure the number one thing you need.
[58:42.000 --> 58:48.600]  We're ready to get to you and your family now if you get your orders in at 4store.com.
[58:48.600 --> 58:51.160]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[58:51.160 --> 58:52.160]  They're amazing.
[58:52.160 --> 58:53.160]  They're cutting edge.
[58:53.160 --> 58:54.160]  You love them.
[58:54.160 --> 58:55.160]  I love them.
[58:55.160 --> 58:57.200]  And they find the InfoWars in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[58:57.200 --> 59:03.800]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[59:03.800 --> 59:11.560]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[59:11.560 --> 59:15.840]  And there's another innovation, it's the spray cap.
[59:15.840 --> 59:22.040]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes
[59:22.040 --> 59:23.400]  it in a really great way.
[59:23.400 --> 59:26.640]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[59:26.640 --> 59:29.280]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it right in your eyes.
[59:29.280 --> 59:33.880]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[59:33.880 --> 59:35.280]  So this is a real innovation.
[59:35.280 --> 59:39.680]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[59:39.680 --> 59:43.520]  essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[59:43.520 --> 59:51.720]  It's so refreshing, this is a big winner.
[59:51.720 --> 1:00:11.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:11.840 --> 1:00:17.120]  You may be an atheist and you may not believe in holy scripture, but that does not change
[1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:20.920]  the fact that the mark of the beast is upon us.
[1:00:20.920 --> 1:00:27.360]  For those unfamiliar with the mark of the beast, it comes from Revelation 13 in the Bible.
[1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:32.960]  It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive
[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:38.920]  a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads so that they could not buy or sell unless
[1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:44.720]  they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:46.800]  This calls for wisdom.
[1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:51.480]  But the person who has insight, calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number
[1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:53.080]  of a man.
[1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:56.560]  That number is 666.
[1:00:56.560 --> 1:01:03.480]  Whether it is biblical prophecy or not, the evidence suggests it is a very real agenda.
[1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:09.120]  Every universal bar code has three guidebars, each one representing a six.
[1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:15.800]  When the inventor, George Joseph Lohr of IBM, was asked of this, he replied, yes, they
[1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:18.400]  do resemble the code for a six.
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:22.120]  There is nothing sinister about this, nor does it have anything to do with the Bible's
[1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:23.280]  mark of the beast.
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:28.960]  It is simply a coincidence, like the fact that my first, middle and last name all have
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:31.400]  six letters.
[1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:35.080]  Perhaps it was a coincidence, or even a joke.
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:36.960]  But look at what we have today.
[1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:43.360]  In 2004, the FDA approved a chip that is implanted into a person's hand.
[1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:49.680]  In 2019, Elon Musk and Neuralink have announced that they are planning on implanting computer
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:55.520]  chips into people's heads, so that we can merge with artificial intelligence.
[1:01:55.520 --> 1:02:02.520]  MIT, under funding of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, has developed a quantum
[1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:07.880]  dot ink implant that can be monitored by a smartphone.
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:18.760]  And in 2020, World Patent Number 06006 was published by Microsoft Technology, titled
[1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:23.400]  Cryptocurrency System Using Body Activity Data.
[1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:29.440]  It outlines a technology wherein human body activity associated with a task provided to
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:35.400]  a user may be used in a mining process of a cryptocurrency system.
[1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:41.640]  The human is given an activity to accomplish, which is sent from a body sensor to the cloud
[1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:47.560]  and to the cryptocurrency system, rewarding the human with money.
[1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:52.280]  And while this is happening, the world is being told to stay at home until a vaccine
[1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:58.400]  can be developed, while the 5G needed to run artificial intelligence is rapidly rolling
[1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:01.280]  out worldwide.
[1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:05.880]  But the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:07.960]  of a man.
[1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:13.600]  Humanity is being asked to abandon a world based on God's law, and accept a world based
[1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:15.320]  on man's law.
[1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:18.600]  In other words, the law of the state.
[1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:23.920]  Whether you believe in biblical prophecy or not, the mark of the beast is becoming very
[1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:25.400]  real.
[1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:30.480]  And at the speed of which things are now going, it seems we will soon discover how many people
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:34.860]  will accept the mark and how many will resist.
[1:03:34.860 --> 1:03:52.680]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[1:03:52.680 --> 1:04:19.080]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:31.440]  Welcome to the New World Order, Bohemian Grove, the American deep state, the rise of communist
[1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:39.320]  China, the plan for global depopulation, and global elite pedophiles who prey off of our
[1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:40.320]  young.
[1:04:40.320 --> 1:04:47.600]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us, but because of your support, our fight continues.
[1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:52.600]  Support the Info War, and together, we will slay the dragon.
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:53.600]  Keep fighting out here, gladiator.
[1:04:53.600 --> 1:04:54.600]  Was only four months ago that I warned President Trump and the American people that Calvary
[1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:55.600]  would never stand for you resisting our jail.
[1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:56.600]  There is no limit to which we will not stoop to make you bow via the fear that is innate
[1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:57.600]  in your heart.
[1:04:57.600 --> 1:05:18.600]  It was I, the leader of Cobra, that foresaw your inner colors, and how much you would
[1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:28.600]  enjoy watching Netflix and wearing masks and gloves when you went out to feel all important
[1:05:28.600 --> 1:05:29.600]  like you were in a war.
[1:05:29.600 --> 1:05:40.600]  When the real tired of Cobra was always the billions of people at the edge of starvation,
[1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:48.600]  who were about dying at the tune of over a million peak bulls every three weeks, Cobra
[1:05:48.600 --> 1:05:50.600]  thanks you for watching time.
[1:05:50.600 --> 1:05:55.600]  Continue the lockdowns while I depopulate the planet.
[1:05:55.600 --> 1:06:20.600]  I'll see you in the next video.
[1:06:20.600 --> 1:06:43.600]  Alright, the time for waiting for the new old orders gone now.
[1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:50.440]  We made a lot of preparations, we exposed the main officers and controllers of it were,
[1:06:50.440 --> 1:06:55.280]  and so we've not been caught completely flat-footed.
[1:06:55.280 --> 1:07:01.360]  But compliance to this dehumanization system is destruction.
[1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:08.680]  Resistance is victory, compliance to tyranny is death.
[1:07:08.680 --> 1:07:16.640]  So my answer is victory or death.
[1:07:16.640 --> 1:07:25.400]  I saw a headline yesterday for the David Night Show when I put out the headline, the live
[1:07:25.400 --> 1:07:27.200]  feed for people to share and send out.
[1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:28.200]  Hopefully you are.
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:32.120]  If you want to win, you want to be slaves, hell don't please.
[1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:35.720]  If you're not awake now and not involved, not engaged now, when will you be?
[1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:38.760]  I know a lot of you are, but other folks of the fence, this is entertainment.
[1:07:38.760 --> 1:07:43.600]  It's not a, so many millions tune in, they estimate in some of these big PR firms half
[1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:46.840]  the audience who's in it for entertainment value.
[1:07:46.840 --> 1:07:52.480]  Okay, well, you're pretty sadistic then if you think this is entertainment because it's
[1:07:52.480 --> 1:07:53.480]  not.
[1:07:53.480 --> 1:07:56.400]  I try to illustrate how evil the globalists are by laying out their own statements and
[1:07:56.400 --> 1:08:03.480]  their own words in a theatrical way because the theatrics don't do justice to the real
[1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:04.480]  thing.
[1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:06.480]  It's way worse than I can tell you.
[1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:14.400]  Let me try to back this up.
[1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:17.120]  The bear trap closed in the last two months.
[1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:19.760]  It's on our leg.
[1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:24.960]  And if we don't either get our leg out or cut our leg off, we're going to die.
[1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:29.520]  And so this is not a good position to be in.
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:32.840]  But if I can't get my leg out of this thing very, very quickly, I'm going to pull a knife
[1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:33.840]  out and cut my leg off.
[1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:37.120]  I'm going to turn it, get it up and I'm going to drag myself off.
[1:08:37.120 --> 1:08:40.520]  And I'm not looking forward to hacking through my own ankle.
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:51.280]  But I can see over the hill a couple dozen wolves 300 yards away coming at me.
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:56.480]  And if I don't cut this ankle off and scrabble in the woods and at least climb into a hole
[1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:01.000]  where I can find a sharp stick and jab at the wolves, I have no hope.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  And you've got to decide, hey, leg, bye-bye.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.440]  I didn't want us to step in the bear trap.
[1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:11.840]  I really tried to keep us from it.
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:18.080]  I know you did as well, but the time for that's over now.
[1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:21.320]  We're in the trap.
[1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:30.880]  And every minute, every second, every millisecond that we sit here lying to ourselves about
[1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:41.840]  this, things only get worse.
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:46.720]  So let's talk about the reality of where we are.
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:10:05.640]  We have a consortium, a syndicate, an alliance, an axis, and a combine, a confederacy of big
[1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:09.760]  corporations that have never gotten in trouble for what they've done through the lawyers
[1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:15.280]  and the corporate systems of deniability, these councils, and authoritarian governments
[1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:27.880]  and absolutely mind-blown degenerate media barons who have been raved on hating America
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:36.440]  and Jesus and freedom and manhood because they're scum and they're threatened by that.
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:41.440]  I mean, if you're Bill Gates or you're Warren Buffett or you're Sumner Redstone, your fear
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:49.840]  at 2 a.m. is that men wake up, white men, brown men, black men, they don't care.
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:52.160]  They don't want men to wake up.
[1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:55.920]  So you teach men to fight with each other and hate each other or what color they are
[1:10:55.920 --> 1:11:01.440]  while you're selling a system that's destroying their very genetic code regardless of what
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:03.600]  color they are.
[1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:12.600]  And the big foundations he represents have been at the heart of this entire dehumanization
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:18.960]  operation and so it's with very heavy heart that I realize that I just have to trust in
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:24.280]  God and turn over to God at this point because the last two months with the lockdown and
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:29.240]  them rolling out the plan exactly as we predicted they would confirms to me that they're going
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:32.000]  to execute the next phases of their plans.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:35.680]  So they're coming with forced inoculations next year.
[1:11:35.680 --> 1:11:36.680]  They're coming.
[1:11:36.680 --> 1:11:41.480]  So that's a little bit of in-game initiated that's up on Bandod video and do not share
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:42.480]  this video.
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:46.360]  Just submit to it, take the forced inoculations and I'm being sarcastic.
[1:11:46.360 --> 1:12:00.240]  So let me be a good boy, we'll go to break in like four minutes and then we'll come back
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:15.440]  and I'll predile this up with God Almighty.
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:19.440]  Maybe we're not supposed to change this.
[1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:24.880]  I mean maybe all the leftists, everybody that want the economy shut down and fetishize wearing
[1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:34.080]  masks and fetishize lockdowns maybe they need to see the full-born decade-long depression
[1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:42.840]  hundreds of millions starving to death to not trust the globalist.
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:50.520]  But the globalist are openly saying that this is already going to kill 20, 30, 40, 50 times
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:57.400]  what COVID-19 does in the next year from starvation.
[1:12:57.400 --> 1:13:02.080]  There's that underlying sickness of well there's too many people anyways because this
[1:13:02.080 --> 1:13:07.360]  isn't being done to save the earth, it's not being done to save the world, it's being
[1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:19.800]  done to kill people and that's the real math and that's the reality and all these people
[1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:25.480]  out there that are on the chi comp payroll you know I should be jumping for joy this
[1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:31.200]  morning I should be running around on air doing backflips standing on my head because
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:38.360]  incredibly good things are happening right now but I've just looked at the abyss too
[1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:46.440]  long and I don't know what to say at this point.
[1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:54.600]  I can't believe that we've let things even get to this point and then I asked myself
[1:13:54.600 --> 1:14:03.280]  why am I trying to save this if I really hate the leftist and what they do I should be supporting
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:09.720]  them because they're going to be the ones that are the first to go under this but then
[1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:14.640]  I sit back and I realize so many children will be hurt in the process it's the right
[1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:18.920]  thing to do to just tell the truth and try to save everybody even if they don't deserve
[1:14:18.920 --> 1:14:32.560]  it this audience of amazing activists they do deserve the truth and so I will do it.
[1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:39.200]  I mean I haven't even hit the big news yet imagine the start of the show today.
[1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:44.840]  The Pentagon comes out and realizes that big tech was a mouthpiece for communist China
[1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:50.080]  and created the COVID-19 hysteria from the beginning to shut down the US economy that's
[1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:57.600]  all confirmed hell Google Facebook Twitter they all would shovel official communist party
[1:14:57.600 --> 1:15:10.040]  English speakers at you they sponsor everybody while Americans that are loyal citizens are
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:18.480]  banned and people say oh you poor baby I'm not a victim I was banned because I was an
[1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:23.480]  alpha male that didn't want to be a slave and all these people that think one dimensional
[1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:31.000]  go oh you're being banned too bad for you I'm being banned what the you are the target
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:35.240]  I'm the schmuck that thought you'd want freedom that thought you'd want to stand up against
[1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:41.040]  this but you know I'm not a schmuck because I'm doing this before God and that's the
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:45.840]  only audience that matters it doesn't matter if no one listens to me it doesn't matter
[1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:50.160]  because God's watching and that's who counts but you know what a lot of people are watching
[1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:58.440]  and taking action and I salute you if you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many

[1:18:23.480 --> 1:18:28.760]  but you know what I didn't do that but I said on a routine basis regardless people are vitamin
[1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:34.560]  D deficient people are deficient I had died and so many other issues you need those products
[1:18:34.560 --> 1:18:39.320]  regardless so we sort of selling out of vital mineral fusion all the other products I cut
[1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:45.720]  the prices from 30% off to 60% off because I knew it was the right thing to do during
[1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:51.560]  a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their bodies offenses but now I'm telling
[1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:59.920]  you with the economic crisis going on get your storeable food now bio PQQ research that
[1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:05.200]  look into it for yourself big brother in the globalist don't want you to call you 10 oh
[1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:10.880]  you probably want to spend some time researching coq 10 and then research DNA force plus and
[1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:20.040]  the types that we have in here the very best forms the PQQ and then a whole bunch of other
[1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:26.640]  natural ingredients for mother nature that are known to supercharge it all this is our
[1:19:26.640 --> 1:19:33.360]  best selling overall formula and I told listeners the end of last year that we can't sell products
[1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:39.360]  at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup in them to find our operations but
[1:19:39.360 --> 1:19:44.520]  because of what's happening and going on in the world right now I really want everybody
[1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:51.720]  who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of DNA force plus to have DNA force plus yourself
[1:19:51.720 --> 1:20:21.680]  a family you're listening to the Alex Jones show it is Thursday April 23rd 2020 I'm
[1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:28.760]  the host Alex Jones thanks for joining us okay so here's the facts the reality you have
[1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:34.560]  a hundred and eighty five thousand deaths worldwide of this coronavirus and the United
[1:20:34.560 --> 1:20:40.640]  Nations is reporting that about 10 million people starved to death a year and now they're
[1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:46.440]  saying it's going to be 30 million so that's 20 million extra dead people and that's how
[1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:51.440]  mathematics works so none of the folks pushing that it's the end of the world keep the lockdown
[1:20:51.440 --> 1:20:56.160]  going all of this want to address that they just want to debate you about we could save
[1:20:56.160 --> 1:21:01.680]  somebody if we stay locked in our houses even though they admit more people are dying of
[1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:08.680]  cancer from not getting treatment suicide rates all of it drug abuse skyrocketing bankruptcy
[1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:15.520]  all of that on top of the starvation is dozens of times bigger than COVID-19 but see those
[1:21:15.520 --> 1:21:21.240]  that buy into it get praised by the media when they write the articles about how America
[1:21:21.240 --> 1:21:26.560]  can ever reopen so Mitch McConnell came out and said look I know the Democrats in the
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:30.440]  globalist want to bankrupt the economy and we're already leveraged to the hill and it's
[1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:37.960]  the blue cities and blue states out of the problem so if you make us continue to do this
[1:21:37.960 --> 1:21:42.080]  we just won't be able to bail out the states because they're the ones trying to bring the
[1:21:42.080 --> 1:21:47.720]  whole country down that is a normal good response just like the Attorney General saying this
[1:21:47.720 --> 1:21:53.760]  house arrest is martial law this is illegal this is dangerous from saying go out and protest
[1:21:53.760 --> 1:21:59.000]  against the shutdown he needs us to not be cowards he needs us to learn how to do basic
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:13.800]  math and go okay 30,000 dead the United States think about that imagine if Americans acted
[1:22:13.800 --> 1:22:19.800]  like this before we lost millions of people in our wars millions in the Civil War so
[1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:25.320]  black people had rights imagine people back then have been told oh there's a plague you
[1:22:25.320 --> 1:22:35.400]  can't go outside and this plague is incredibly weak so can we put up the number of deaths
[1:22:35.400 --> 1:22:41.360]  for the United States please wrap around screen for TV viewers US deaths please and again these
[1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:51.680]  are death counting everybody that died from car wrecks gunshot wounds heart attacks cancer
[1:22:51.680 --> 1:23:03.680]  they're now claiming it's 46,972 and what a genius operation they count everyone that
[1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:10.600]  dies the test positive for the cold whoever had a cold and whoever had the flu it's a
[1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:19.920]  test put out by the woman that runs the Wuhan bio weapons lab Danielle Anderson she also
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:25.000]  runs the Facebook fact-checking so let me let me hit this big piece of news for our next
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:41.160]  special guest joins us through public relations firms and through major billionaires almost
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:55.680]  every major news site that was pro-trump has taken money I would imagine you'd want to
[1:23:55.680 --> 1:24:07.920]  know those names wouldn't you so I want you to think about that understand that here it
[1:24:07.920 --> 1:24:20.280]  is Chinese agents help spread messages that showed virus panic in us officials say I'm
[1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:29.880]  not against US intelligence agencies if they follow the American way and if they promote
[1:24:29.880 --> 1:24:36.200]  freedom and if we the people control the government and then if our will in the legislators and
[1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:44.000]  the president we elect is executed dutifully if there's mistakes made I understand but
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:48.040]  if you're got the spirit you're on the right direction then you know a few broken eggs
[1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:53.440]  I'm not gonna piss myself but I've been an enemy of US intelligence agencies and law
[1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:58.360]  enforcement for decades because they've been run by the globalist the minute they began
[1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:04.720]  to come under US control well on their biggest fan that's not a paradox that's not a contradiction
[1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:11.240]  that's called common sense because nobody was more pissed than US intelligence operatives
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:17.640]  and law enforcement at carrying out evil people at the grassroots want to carry out good people
[1:25:17.640 --> 1:25:22.160]  want justice that's why the globalists don't like common sense and human decisions they
[1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:28.400]  want technotronic technocracy making decisions so this isn't a revolution of the elite through
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:35.280]  the people this is the people taking control and that's why info wars is so damn sexy is
[1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:49.880]  because we are the people and I get my orders from common sense and yeah when I wake up
[1:25:49.880 --> 1:25:57.240]  and feel the Holy Spirit at 3 a.m. I got all my knees and then just and I'm like why can't
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:26:01.960]  it be like to stir in the day why can't I stay here forever why can't I have all this
[1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:07.560]  peace and understanding it's like because you're not there yet you only get it for one second
[1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:15.040]  now carry out the operation so that I've got something to sound off of versus these devil
[1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:19.840]  worshipers but people that don't have God can't even imagine because they've never been
[1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:26.480]  able to bounce it off of that it's not that info wars tells Trump and patriots and the
[1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:32.040]  government wants to do it's that we're a key that fits the lock or we're a lock that takes
[1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:40.560]  the key I'm American you're American we're all human as well we all have kinship and
[1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:48.560]  we didn't just come to this party we were born into it and that gives us standing and
[1:26:48.560 --> 1:26:57.120]  so the globalist only carry out an operation if it gives them success in every level well
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:27:01.720]  at the first level gives a more power and control brings in a technocracy bands cash
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:05.720]  brings in drone control surveillance has medical tyranny to force me to not you let you but
[1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:15.280]  what's those are all side dishes what's the big rib eye steak immediately stalling the
[1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:21.280]  world economy makes people dependent not free market not successful themselves makes them
[1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:29.880]  accept communism socialism centralization they go into deeper debt and what else does
[1:27:29.880 --> 1:27:38.200]  it do what else does it do think about that hard and long makes them dependent it makes
[1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:45.760]  them easily controlled but what else does it do because if you have the answer to that
[1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:54.440]  question you have the answer to all the questions they're not just trying to make you dependent
[1:27:54.440 --> 1:28:00.980]  so they run your life they're making you dependent so that you're obsolete so that you're non
[1:28:00.980 --> 1:28:06.600]  essential you're being seen as a cancer on the billionaires planet and that you think
[1:28:06.600 --> 1:28:11.280]  you get a house and a life and a wife and a husband and a family and kids and a vacation
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:16.800]  and that's all that's the resources they're greedy they want you cut out of the future
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:23.600]  they're stealing your position in the universe and your providence and your genetic future
[1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:29.080]  and they're engaging in a type of war that is covert that is very very hard to be but
[1:28:29.080 --> 1:28:35.960]  still I'm not released the secrets but it's like a brick wall I'm about to rely just I'm
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:41.080]  not allowed to it's there's no government telling me not to I'm about to release massive stuff
[1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:45.840]  and I was about to do it and God's went nope not yet seriously that's one of my greatest
[1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:50.040]  frustrations I'm not allowed to tell you yet hopefully I'm praying to God let me tell

[1:29:59.360 --> 1:30:03.520]  they needed to get high quality horrible food not because of the virus but because of the
[1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:08.880]  crises in the economic shutdown it would cause because the globalist were planning to hold
[1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:14.560]  America hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and blue states now that prediction
[1:30:14.560 --> 1:30:21.040]  has come true because the globalist are running an operation it's not predictions we have
[1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:26.120]  their battle plans so going back more than eight weeks ago all major storeable food companies
[1:30:26.120 --> 1:30:30.680]  were sold out except my patriot supply because they're the biggest of a preposition when
[1:30:30.680 --> 1:30:35.040]  it got to the point they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill
[1:30:35.040 --> 1:30:39.320]  them in a timely manner they stopped taking orders till they got caught back up well now
[1:30:39.320 --> 1:30:43.280]  they're caught back up they've got high quality storeable food in stock ready to be packaged

[1:30:53.280 --> 1:30:59.560]  food now at infowarstore.com authoritarians across the planet want the power to be able
[1:30:59.560 --> 1:31:03.920]  to tell you to stay in your houses and don't leave and only go where they tell you can
[1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:08.440]  go it's called martial law it's called living in the authoritarian country and everybody
[1:31:08.440 --> 1:31:13.440]  knows that everybody understands that and the democrats have now shown their hands with
[1:31:13.440 --> 1:31:18.240]  the deep state saying we're going to listen to Fauci and the world health organization
[1:31:18.240 --> 1:31:22.680]  who've done nothing but put on all this fake disinformation so far we're not going to listen
[1:31:22.680 --> 1:31:27.520]  to the president we're not going to listen to congress but that all these other corporations
[1:31:27.520 --> 1:31:32.400]  are going to work in tandem with big tech to surveil and control and keep things shut
[1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:37.800]  down this is economic warfare and I know everybody understands that public with the president
[1:31:37.800 --> 1:31:44.080]  and others need to develop a plan to understand that this is a global corporate civil war
[1:31:44.080 --> 1:31:49.200]  and that we're being held hostage and this is a mutiny against our country by globalist
[1:31:49.200 --> 1:31:54.800]  forces only understanding the reality of the magnitude of that gives us any chance of defeating
[1:31:54.800 --> 1:32:00.640]  it how do you put a people under house arrest how do you put them under siege well you tell
[1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:05.680]  them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist
[1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:10.720]  deep state and then had china released to then take down the populist president and
[1:32:10.720 --> 1:32:16.240]  those pesky american people that have become too uppity bill marr even admitted man I
[1:32:16.240 --> 1:32:21.400]  hope we have a depression now they've tailored the whole thing with the big corporations
[1:32:21.400 --> 1:32:26.040]  and the media are going to keep the country closed along with the help of the blue states
[1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:31.800]  and blue states all the time blaming trump and capitalism and americanism for the depression
[1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:37.880]  it creates if america is that stupid we deserve what happens to us but as for me I'm not sitting
[1:32:37.880 --> 1:32:42.320]  here and I'm not taking it it's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the
[1:32:42.320 --> 1:32:47.080]  good people keep everybody safe but that's not what they're doing they are pulling america
[1:32:47.080 --> 1:32:53.280]  up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings our health our whole world and committing
[1:32:53.280 --> 1:33:09.320]  millions of third world people to death you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:16:42.820 --> 1:33:48.960]  isn't a game this is the real world and from birth in this modern
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:55.880]  world we've been trained to submit and not be our own men our own women but now here
[1:33:55.880 --> 1:34:03.320]  we are the communist chinese a garden state a farming community of the globalist a giant
[1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:08.720]  programming point to test tyranny and here's the new york times telling you exactly what
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:16.120]  he told you three months ago chinese agents helped spread messages that sowed virus panic
[1:34:16.120 --> 1:34:20.360]  in the u.s. people go alex you believe in our times no i don't believe in our times
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:27.320]  they've been forced to report this because trump is fighting back and they've been caught
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:33.520]  i know for a fact that through ad agencies the communist chinese have bought off most
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:46.880]  the major news websites we got approached by one of the richest men in the world last
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:52.320]  year to sell out and we didn't and it was a contract it was a private meeting i signed
[1:34:52.320 --> 1:34:59.000]  a non-disclosure wasn't criminal i can sell my soul anytime i want it wasn't like devil
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:04.440]  went down to georgia on a charlie daniel song where he jumps up on a hickory stump says
[1:35:04.440 --> 1:35:09.960]  boy let me tell you what you might be a fiddle player but i'm a fiddle player too and i bet
[1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:16.360]  a fiddle of gold against your souls i think i'm better than you but i've had those experiences
[1:35:16.360 --> 1:35:22.120]  and you know what it was easy not to sell out but here's the difference i can't get
[1:35:22.120 --> 1:35:29.160]  up here and not sell out to the devil and then not get you to support us because that's
[1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:33.720]  what this comes down to money for me was never something i worshiped and when they try to
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:38.960]  shut me down 15 years ago i came and set up a bigger operation and said i'll show you
[1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:43.120]  you're trying to shut me down i'll really go big time and that's why it's important
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:48.920]  for you to go to m4store.com and get great vitamins and supplements and books and films

[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:12.880]  we've got storable food when nobody else that we know has it we're ready to ship that we've
[1:36:12.880 --> 1:36:17.440]  got we've got a lot of the great products and that's what it takes to keep us on air
[1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:23.280]  and to keep this big crew of people and all these other shows on air and i'm not a victim
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:32.520]  i'm not bitching or complaining i'm just simply saying i didn't sell out to the richest people
[1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:37.840]  on the planet which was not by the way it was not hard to not sell out by the way it
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:43.360]  was like write down this razor blade into alcohol and destroy yourself and we'll give
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:51.960]  you ten million dollars personally you know no you're like is that a joke but you see
[1:36:51.960 --> 1:36:56.160]  so many people that are willing to do that and and they did take the money and some of
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:37:00.160]  the folks were good people before but they were alone no one supported them so they
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:03.760]  sold out i'm not even judging people that did that and the minute they sell out they
[1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:09.520]  go from having all this worth that magicness of authenticity to worthlessness they go
[1:37:09.520 --> 1:37:15.080]  from being real gold to being pyrite who's gold just like that but i'm just saying thank
[1:37:15.080 --> 1:37:21.240]  you listeners don't thank me for keeping info wars in the fight and now with mitch mcconnell
[1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:24.760]  sam we're going into a global depression if we don't turn this around he's saying to
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:30.280]  the states that are globalists run hey you want a depression you're you're not going
[1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:34.800]  to get a bailout because it doesn't exist anyways so we've we've reached just an incredible
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:41.760]  moment ladies and gentlemen and trump coming out and exposing all of this and the attorney
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:50.880]  generals coming out and saying house arrest is martial law and is wrong and wow but see
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:55.880]  it's not that the establishment's perfect the establishment separation of powers had
[1:37:55.880 --> 1:38:01.520]  a little bit of fight america sold out to china the cfr said it was the chinese century
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:07.680]  we were all done and then when it came down to finally turn the lights out in america
[1:38:07.680 --> 1:38:12.520]  america said no and elected trump who actually wants to be president he's got his own problems
[1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:17.720]  but he wants to be the guy in charge and he actually isn't out to get us and so they're
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:24.000]  so pissed they're so upset they don't know what to do and so they threw their own fit
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:31.800]  and said we'll turn the whole economy off and make you submit to us and all that did
[1:38:31.800 --> 1:38:37.600]  was make people support what's happening even more and I go back we'll go to break come
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:40.400]  back with our special guest for the next hour and a half and I'm really blessed to have
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:44.600]  him very very blessed to have him one of the he's been around for a decade one of the biggest
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:50.040]  up and coming superstars exposing tyranny and not backing down under under pressure
[1:38:50.040 --> 1:38:55.000]  and that's the man from london real and all the great work he's doing digital freedom
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  platform of the people by the people for the people brian rose coming up but again i'll
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:09.120]  just say this because when i ask for your support we get it so many times i don't you
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:14.720]  need to get the products and enforce toward i come because vitamin d3 is going to help
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:18.320]  you and your family and boost your life and make you better getting the great multivitamins
[1:39:18.320 --> 1:39:22.000]  we have is just a total win you're funding freedom you're getting a great product that's
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:27.600]  certified in high quality and getting storeable food that last 25 years you've got it in the
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:32.120]  closet you've got it in the attic you've got it as a backup and it's it's the mindset
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:39.280]  it is metaphysical of being prepared being ready changes everything so we have that as
[1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:43.520]  well and i just want to encourage you all to go to m4sore.com and do that but here we
[1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:46.280]  are with mitch mcconnell's i want to go to break with and come back with our special
[1:39:46.280 --> 1:39:50.800]  guest saying we don't want this but if the states are going to keep stuff locked down
[1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:56.080]  it will be a great depression so we're not going to bail you out they go oh you're holding
[1:39:56.080 --> 1:40:00.840]  us hostage but it's the blue cities and blue states that are globalists run that are holding
[1:40:00.840 --> 1:40:07.240]  us hostage so the moves trumps making are exactly what i would do and this is crazy
[1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:12.640]  here it is i have great respect for lemar alexander a lot of the state governments are going to
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:18.440]  be smashed up by this but there is no chapter eight in the bankruptcy code who are you going
[1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:23.440]  to tell you know for states uh no states can go bankrupt local governments can go bankrupt
[1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:28.320]  and reorganize who are you going to task to lead the effort on deciding what to do or
[1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:34.240]  not to do for the states yeah well i think it's going to be a broad discussion without
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:38.520]  you know throughout the conference and we all represent states we all have done regardless
[1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:43.480]  of party who would love to have free money and i that's why i said yesterday we're going
[1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:48.920]  to push the pause button here because i think this whole business of additional assistance
[1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:54.200]  for state and local governments needs to be thoroughly evaluated you raise yourself the
[1:40:54.200 --> 1:41:00.000]  important issue of what states have done many of them have done to themselves with their
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:05.480]  pension programs uh there's not going to be any desire on the republican side to bail
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:11.040]  out state pensions by borrowing money from future generations so this is a much bigger
[1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:18.440]  conversation than we've had uh providing assistance for small business because the government
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:23.760]  shut them out put them down put them out of business or assistance to hospitals which
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:30.280]  are overwhelmed by the covid-19 uh disease this is a very different decision these are
[1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:38.520]  all taxing authorities just like we are and i think that's why we need to have a wholesome
[1:41:38.520 --> 1:41:44.240]  conference wide discussion among senate republicans before we go down this path i agree i i think
[1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:50.240]  people do not understand how badly mismanaged some states have been and their unfunded liabilities
[1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:54.200]  and if they were in the private sector they would have to reorganize is it news wars
[1:41:54.200 --> 1:41:58.360]  dot com will come back with our guest brian rose of one in real but that's really what
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:05.760]  this is is holding america hostage bring us into collapse and then getting giant bailouts
[1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:11.480]  to blue states and blue cities who then say robots and drones are going to police us and
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:17.240]  we've got to take force inoculations remember what trump said last week tell the democrats
[1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:22.560]  the democrat governors that mutiny on the bounty was one of my favorite movies a good old fashioned
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:27.880]  mutiny every now and then is exciting and vigorating thing to watch especially when
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:33.640]  the mutineers need so much the captain too easy so now you see it they're coming out
[1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:39.040]  saying the chai comms ran it with don't want to gates bill gates is getting demonized everywhere
[1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:43.440]  the whole thing is starting to turn against them so it looked like they had it all beat
[1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:48.640]  like when hitler invented russia but all of a sudden things get turned back very quickly
[1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:52.720]  we've now reached that magic point the founder of london real brian rose straight ahead stay
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:59.560]  with us the america that we've known and loved the america that was the land of the free
[1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:05.520]  home of the brave is dying right now and everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating
[1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:11.000]  us shutting us down and making us dependent on them the food shortages have begun the
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:15.080]  depression is going to be long and very very serious in fact it's probably too late now
[1:43:15.080 --> 1:43:18.920]  to even turn back trump tried to stop it but the mainstream media working with the chai
[1:43:18.920 --> 1:43:24.680]  comms blocked it that's why you and myself everybody else has to get prepared now do
[1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:29.240]  not wait it's not about the virus it's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed

[1:44:57.840 --> 1:45:04.960]  is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete non-essential
[1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:10.480]  that's why they position it with economic tariffs taxes and controls to where family
[1:45:10.480 --> 1:45:15.900]  farms and industry that's based in the united states has to shut down or be part of a large
[1:45:15.900 --> 1:45:22.760]  corporate conglomerate that's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is
[1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:28.520]  phased out they can simply look at us and say because again you are not essential that's
[1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:33.720]  what the robots and all of this is about it's about setting it up where we're no longer
[1:45:33.720 --> 1:45:39.680]  in charge of our lives we can be told to stay on our houses and after all shut up this world
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:44.120]  doesn't belong to people anyways it belongs to the new ai gods the rich elitist that
[1:45:44.120 --> 1:45:49.400]  emerged with machines yeah that sounds completely insane doesn't it that's actually the public
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:55.400]  plan they're pushing these people are completely psychotic and make hitler look like a choir
[1:45:55.400 --> 1:46:00.160]  boy i'm always excited about info wars life products they're amazing they're cutting edge
[1:46:00.160 --> 1:46:04.880]  you love them i love them and they find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught
[1:46:04.880 --> 1:46:11.880]  but we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing the
[1:46:11.880 --> 1:46:19.280]  only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it
[1:46:19.280 --> 1:46:26.080]  and there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick
[1:46:26.080 --> 1:46:31.840]  gross you goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great way i like to put it on
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:36.640]  my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it around
[1:46:36.640 --> 1:46:42.520]  your eyes but i just love it personally it's something that's a moisturizer as well so
[1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:45.600]  this is a real innovation i don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:51.360]  sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great
[1:46:51.360 --> 1:46:58.360]  it's so refreshing this is a big winner
[1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:15.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:15.360 --> 1:47:22.360]  the devil went down to georgia
[1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:27.200]  the devil went down to georgia he was looking for a solar steel he was in a bind because
[1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:31.520]  he was way behind he was willing to make a deal when he came across this young man sewing
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:35.360]  on the fiddle and playing it hot and the devil jumped up on a hickory stump and said boy
[1:47:35.360 --> 1:47:40.480]  let me tell you what i guess you did uh ryan roses here i've been a fan of his work three
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:44.720]  four years i've watched a lot of it when i'm on the treadmill or you know out hiking or
[1:47:44.720 --> 1:47:50.720]  whatever i tend to listen to it he's a london real dot tv but and he just is a very real
[1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:55.200]  guy like london real so i've always liked him just had an immediate affinity with him
[1:47:55.200 --> 1:48:00.120]  and early on he's done a lot of david ike interviews i really enjoyed those but i liked all the
[1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:05.080]  interviews he did because unlike me he shuts up lets folks talk and then when he does pipe
[1:48:05.080 --> 1:48:12.600]  then he really has insightful comments but what he really has is something that is um
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:18.760]  the fifth element and it's courage and it's being a leader and realizing that you can
[1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:24.840]  go along and get along and be empowered monetarily early on in a corrupt system but in the end
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:28.440]  you destroy yourself and everybody else what really matters is integrity so i'm gonna try
[1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:33.440]  to shut up for the next hour or so while he's with us ryan rose of londonreal.com i've got
[1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:38.800]  a lot of questions for him about covid 19 and the new world order and his show and uh his
[1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:43.720]  big david ike interview that they had in literally thousands of publications saying this is the
[1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:47.800]  most evil thing on earth but we've banned it you can't see what they actually said and
[1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:51.560]  it was just because david ike was like electrical i mean i've always been a david ike fan but
[1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:57.400]  i was like like cult follower at that point uh so ryan rose great to have you here you've
[1:48:57.400 --> 1:49:02.520]  got another big david ike interview you've been warned not to have him back on but you've
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:08.480]  you've doubled down the essence of male leadership i'll just say it it's uh i'm not gay but it's
[1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:14.320]  sexy okay men not backing down women not backing down there's nothing more sexy than knowing
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:18.120]  you're right and having the will so thanks for joining us tell us about where you're
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:20.920]  at right now and what you've been through the last few weeks on this roller coaster
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:24.520]  because you were a successful banker and had a show for 10 years and reach millions every
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:29.800]  week but now you've taken a rocket ship up to a next level well it's great to be back
[1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:33.520]  alex and i love that song the devil went down to georgia and i feel like that's been
[1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:37.960]  playing in the back of my head the last couple weeks with a few of the trillion dollar silicone
[1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:42.760]  valley be a mosque because they've been trying to tempt me with the cash flow that usually
[1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:47.760]  gets most people to shut up but they picked the wrong guy to fight with because i'm deciding
[1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:51.960]  not to play their game and like you said for the last nine years we've been a platform
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:56.840]  for free speech you know having these long form nuanced conversations and i emphasize
[1:49:56.840 --> 1:50:01.040]  nuance because you have to really listen to someone to understand that point of view this
[1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:07.200]  isn't just a clickbait headline and two weeks ago in what was the second largest youtube
[1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:12.040]  stream in the world a show that was going to go on to be watched probably 30 or 40 million
[1:50:12.040 --> 1:50:17.800]  times potentially the most watched video podcast in human history was subsequently banned from
[1:50:17.800 --> 1:50:22.560]  youtube 30 minutes later i wasn't consulted it wasn't discussed with me i found out the
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:27.480]  details in a bbc article the next day and from there as you know alex the next two weeks
[1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:33.560]  i've been banned on linkedin on vimeo on drop books on facebook on twitter but we have decided
[1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:38.280]  to fight back they picked the wrong person to fight with and i don't know about you alex
[1:50:38.280 --> 1:50:43.560]  but as a kid when someone told me what to do i never appreciated it but we have decided
[1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:50.480]  to stream what we're calling rose ike 3 the end of the trilogy on may 3rd 2020 and we're
[1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:55.520]  going to have a million people watching that live stream simultaneously it'll make us the
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:51:02.560]  largest live stream of a conversation in human history but to do that i can't wait and kowtow
[1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:08.560]  to these silicon valley companies that we've had to create our own platform alex and we've
[1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:12.400]  had to create our own war chest and that's what's been super exciting about the last 48
[1:51:12.400 --> 1:51:16.720]  hours exactly and that's what's so beautiful is we made youtube powerful we made google
[1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:21.160]  powerful we made facebook powerful and you're the talent you're the host you've got the
[1:51:21.160 --> 1:51:25.800]  guest you built the studio you've got the crew you did it all since when do these people
[1:51:25.800 --> 1:51:30.960]  sit in judgment over you like they're god and so you've done it just like info wars did
[1:51:30.960 --> 1:51:36.760]  you've built your own platform and you're building it and they are coming very much
[1:51:36.760 --> 1:51:41.120]  so and you know i think they've been shocked by the way i've behaved i think they expected
[1:51:41.120 --> 1:51:46.240]  us to you know behave like a little good little boy to go away and be silent and never mention
[1:51:46.240 --> 1:51:53.520]  ike copin 19 5g you name it but we have continued to put everything we possibly can on that platform
[1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:58.480]  i continued to publish and post this rose ike 3 coming up on may 3rd and we are really
[1:51:58.480 --> 1:52:03.160]  pushing the envelope here and building our own digital platform with the i want you to
[1:52:03.160 --> 1:52:07.720]  get 5 billion views unlike the stupid gang of style videos i mean seriously i want to
[1:52:07.720 --> 1:52:12.360]  see people like i think we're in competition i'm not we don't but other people do we're
[1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:16.320]  not in competition we're in competition against the forces of globalism that want to suppress
[1:52:16.320 --> 1:52:20.720]  free speech every victory for people that set up a free speech is our shared victory
[1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:26.000]  your victories are my victory my victories are your victories brian correct i want all
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:30.880]  of us to be seen to be known and the better you do the better i do the better david ike
[1:52:30.880 --> 1:52:36.920]  does i mean we just want free speech we want adults to make their own decisions alex and
[1:52:36.920 --> 1:52:40.960]  you know we're losing the sovereignty of our own bodies what to put inside them what
[1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:45.160]  to put inside our ears and our eyes and you know off com came out with a statement the
[1:52:45.160 --> 1:52:50.160]  other day and by the way the television station that aired my first interview with david ike
[1:52:50.160 --> 1:52:57.000]  had to publish a retraction and off com said this is dangerous material to broadcast implying
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:02.040]  that we need to be coddled as adults and we can't make our own decisions this boggles
[1:53:02.040 --> 1:53:06.640]  my mind and we're fighting back against this oh the head of youtube came out with brian
[1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:12.600]  stelter on unreliable sources instead we're banning anyone that doesn't follow w h o orders
[1:53:12.600 --> 1:53:19.040]  so suddenly we wake up and the u n unelected bureaucrats funded by china are now in control
[1:53:19.040 --> 1:53:25.760]  of what we can say and she said you will not promote zinc the zinc is non essential i mean
[1:53:25.760 --> 1:53:29.760]  this is another example of the silicon valley companies having a completely different line
[1:53:29.760 --> 1:53:34.600]  than the government of the countries they're located in and now you know the us is pulling
[1:53:34.600 --> 1:53:39.040]  funding from the w h o a lot of people questioning their leadership and now i'm about to say
[1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:44.360]  isn't it exciting to finally see pushback brian oh yeah and you know ike has been talking
[1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:48.040]  about this for a long time questioning that authority but you know alex with a name like
[1:53:48.040 --> 1:53:52.760]  the world health organization you know 99% of the public just assumes it automatically
[1:53:52.760 --> 1:53:56.440]  has authority but when you start looking at their decisions it's shocking and i've been
[1:53:56.440 --> 1:53:59.960]  very impressed to see trumps push back on that and of course he's gotten a lot of flak
[1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:05.360]  from it as well well that's right but again 99% of folks roll over where you haven't rolled
[1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:09.760]  over and again as you said we won't get into details but they come i didn't talk to you
[1:54:09.760 --> 1:54:14.040]  about this but how that works we got a big deal for you have we got a big sponsor just
[1:54:14.040 --> 1:54:19.960]  do what we say and then you didn't do what they said brian yeah you know i've had a lot
[1:54:19.960 --> 1:54:23.720]  of people reach out for sponsorship we've never had sponsors and i don't want them
[1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:27.400]  at this point because i don't even want to hesitate for a second to think about what
[1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:31.720]  i'm going to publish uh you know and so that way we continue to do whatever the heck we
[1:54:31.720 --> 1:54:37.160]  want around here and you know we're going to edit though because hesitation holds back
[1:54:37.160 --> 1:54:42.280]  the purity if there's something people think like no we want unfiltered what is it about
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:48.440]  unfiltered it's so magic yeah and that's exactly it and all these people that are still on these
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:54.040]  platforms they know in the back of their mind maybe there's something they can't say and so
[1:54:54.040 --> 1:54:58.360]  maybe they just better toe the line a little bit not mention that covid 19 thing because
[1:54:58.360 --> 1:55:03.240]  they'll lose their cash flow maybe lose their entire business but i am not scared i'm willing
[1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:07.880]  to put it all on the line and let me be clear if we get banned from youtube this company's
[1:55:07.880 --> 1:55:12.440]  revenues drop down to zero but i don't care whatever's on the other side i think we can
[1:55:12.440 --> 1:55:17.160]  deal with it honestly alex you've been a trailblazer in that way and i'm trusting the process
[1:55:17.160 --> 1:55:20.520]  and i'm trusting what we're calling the london real army which is millions of people that
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:25.880]  immobilized around the world alex i saw posters in austin texas at the courthouse
[1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:30.360]  with london real army on them blew me away oh that's it because you're the man in the arena
[1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:35.080]  and you didn't back down it becomes a standard for others and we don't want to be banned we won't
[1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:40.440]  want to be persecuted but if you make us do that we will build our own system and it's that spirit
[1:55:40.440 --> 1:55:44.680]  that the people resonated with that it would take all the power from big tech overnight
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:51.640]  because the people it is called youtube right still yeah you're exactly right alex and i see
[1:55:51.640 --> 1:55:57.240]  people in the streets constantly shouting at me i've got guys in garbage trucks guys in delivery
[1:55:57.240 --> 1:56:01.080]  trucks that are yelling out brian those want to keep doing what you're doing fight the power
[1:56:01.080 --> 1:56:05.640]  there's a lot of people out there that want to do this pushback uh and maybe now is the time
[1:56:05.640 --> 1:56:10.520]  where we can finally show them that we have a voice uh you know we ended up getting back on
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:15.720]  linkedin after thousands of my followers uh deleted their accounts and i don't know what got their
[1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:20.520]  attention but they're starting to notice and i think with this new platform that i'll talk about
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:24.680]  shortly and this rose like three i think we're making a statement well get into that right now
[1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:27.800]  we're about to start the next hour but but get you know this big david ike interview coming up
[1:56:27.800 --> 1:56:34.680]  uh and just like a week or so yeah so to stream concurrently with a million people not on a major
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:38.680]  platform of one of the trillion dollar silicon valley corporations requires a lot of money
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:43.080]  my technical guys ran the analysis and it's a hundred thousand dollars for that one two-hour
[1:56:43.080 --> 1:56:47.720]  stream that's right alex i've never asked for a dollar in the history of london real nine years
[1:56:47.720 --> 1:56:54.200]  never asked for a donation we started a crowdfunding platform yesterday and in in just over 24 hours
[1:56:54.200 --> 1:56:58.440]  we've raised a quarter of a million dollars beautiful digital freedom platform which is
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:02.040]  and that's real voting of money because let me explain for folks that don't know who puts it out
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:07.560]  in hd he's got a good streamer for what he said a hundred thousand dollars you want to get 10 15
[1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:13.080]  20 million views like we get every few days now folks it is a huge amounts of money that's where
[1:57:13.080 --> 1:57:17.720]  all your purchases are going i can tell you what he's saying they've made him do this but that's
[1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:22.840]  what's beautiful they're making us innovate they say that necessity is the mother of invention
[1:57:22.840 --> 1:57:26.680]  that's why you need to go to london real right now and donate it's so beautiful that's why
[1:57:28.680 --> 1:57:32.600]  they put me in prison soon because you know i can't talk about it yet but they they've told me
[1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:36.040]  if i don't back down and i don't support trump they're gonna put me in prison and that's okay i'm
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:40.680]  ready for it i think ryan roose will be there while i'm in prison supporting me and my family

[1:59:01.160 --> 1:59:05.560]  that's what environmentalism is it's about having an anti-human future and having people live at a
[1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:11.240]  subsistence feudal surf state that's what they want these people that have stolen the planet
[1:59:11.240 --> 1:59:16.760]  are worth trillions of dollars do not want you having a good life they know you're having fun
[1:59:16.760 --> 1:59:21.400]  they know you have a great wife a great husband great children they hate your guts they are the
[1:59:21.400 --> 1:59:28.840]  most horrible evil people on the planet they openly fund racism war degeneracy pedophilia
[1:59:28.840 --> 1:59:34.120]  everything else imagine the most horrible thing in the universe and then imagine it doubled tripled
[1:59:34.120 --> 1:59:39.880]  quadrupled and being gullible and being domesticated just makes them rise up and attack you harder
[1:59:39.880 --> 1:59:43.560]  and they're the ones that launched his whole attack on the planet and they are the enemy of
[1:59:43.560 --> 1:59:55.880]  humanity and need to be stood up against you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:59:55.880 --> 2:00:06.680]  well brian rose of london real dot tv is the example that of other men and women acted like him
[2:00:07.640 --> 2:00:11.640]  we wouldn't be in the situation but that's okay that's what leaders are about it's not about
[2:00:11.640 --> 2:00:17.960]  kissing his ass but he's been around 19 years he's been successful and he's been censored he has it
[2:00:17.960 --> 2:00:23.960]  back down and so his example of saying we're going to have the biggest live stream ever
[2:00:23.960 --> 2:00:31.080]  we're gonna have the biggest event ever we're gonna quadruple down that is the spirit of victory and
[2:00:31.080 --> 2:00:38.040]  that's that's what they fear so much is someone that knows that when other doors closed that this
[2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:42.680]  happened to me when i wouldn't censor myself i had the number one show and also was already
[2:00:42.680 --> 2:00:48.440]  syndicated and it was it was like jay lino was talking about me and i was like 27 years old
[2:00:48.440 --> 2:00:54.280]  i've been on there like four years and i didn't sell out and they fired me and like i knew it was
[2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:58.600]  okay as i drove home and like all these doors just flew open we have to know that's how the
[2:00:58.600 --> 2:01:03.000]  universe works so this is a short segment long segment coming up brian rose of london real
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:07.960]  an american there in london with his hit tv radio show uh these big david i can review some others
[2:01:10.200 --> 2:01:14.520]  you don't want to talk about yourself but let's talk about the energy and the decision
[2:01:14.520 --> 2:01:18.760]  and next segment when some stations join us we'll get into the big event you're having is
[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:24.840]  i want to be the biggest ever this is our event all our events what was the thought
[2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:30.360]  process as they start to shut you down and censor you and try to punish you where you
[2:01:30.360 --> 2:01:39.640]  decided to just take the leap yeah well you know alex it was it was just a knee jerk reaction i
[2:01:39.640 --> 2:01:44.920]  think it was in my dna growing up in san diego california this concept of freedom of speech
[2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:49.720]  it's just something i thought was normal so my first reaction we were banned on youtube
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:54.360]  was to upload another version and upload a vlog complaining about it with a link to the band
[2:01:54.360 --> 2:02:00.360]  episode so for me this is a natural reaction i never had to question it there's been a few times
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:05.080]  where i looked at potentially the demise of my business but i'm trusting the process and the
[2:02:05.080 --> 2:02:10.920]  energy of the people in the london real army but i am purest answer ever it's who you are you're not
[2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:16.520]  bowing you're not dying you it's not even a decision it's it's who you are it's a spirit
[2:02:17.960 --> 2:02:23.960]  yeah it is i just my first reaction was no you cannot do this this is not fair this is not right
[2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:30.920]  and as i further everybody had that attitude we'd already be 20 galaxies out if good people
[2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:35.720]  just didn't back down to the intimidation and just said i don't care what happens you want to fight
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:41.800]  you got one and this is what we talked about at the end of the last conversation with ike like
[2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:46.680]  what are you going to tell your grandchildren you did you know in the great reduction of human
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:53.320]  rights of 2020 you know did you sit at home and do as you were told or did you fight back did you
[2:02:53.320 --> 2:02:58.200]  question authority did you share these messages did you also also start saying why are we doing
[2:02:58.200 --> 2:03:01.960]  this maybe this is wrong i think we're going to look back on this year alex and we're all going
[2:03:01.960 --> 2:03:07.960]  to be judged and leadership comes in many forms it can come in many ages and many guises and it's
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:13.640]  time for us all to step up and do the right thing we all know what that is and uh it's just the fear
[2:03:13.640 --> 2:03:18.280]  that gets in the way it's been magnified by these governments it's it's frightening here most people
[2:03:18.280 --> 2:03:23.480]  in this country are terrified to leave their house even though it makes no scientific talk about when
[2:03:23.480 --> 2:03:29.640]  we come back exactly people are so depressed that submit but when you rebel against the basic
[2:03:29.640 --> 2:03:33.640]  programming of the universe when you rebel against them trying to suppress the basic
[2:03:33.640 --> 2:03:38.360]  programming it's empowering it feels good the ultimate drug is it not brian have you ever
[2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:42.760]  felt better than you do now we didn't talk before the show but i'm guessing you feel the best you've
[2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:49.720]  ever felt i mean it sounds strange in this time of coronavirus but it's true alex i've never felt
[2:03:49.720 --> 2:03:55.240]  more empowered you know i think i'm a wartime conciliary i'm a wartime general that's where i
[2:03:55.240 --> 2:03:59.320]  do my best work when there's a fight that's good with a startup that's good when you're battling
[2:03:59.320 --> 2:04:05.720]  things out but right now i feel honestly i feel like i am just i'm channeling a better
[2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:10.200]  and other force that's what it is it's not even me this is not about brian rose it's not about
[2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:14.760]  london real even this digital freedom platform is not ours it's some separate entity that's owned
[2:04:14.760 --> 2:04:21.800]  by the people and it's going to continue on even if my i have my demise and ryan it's that authenticity
[2:04:22.680 --> 2:04:28.680]  and the courage they feel that's what they fear my friend is that you're not trying to put an act
[2:04:28.680 --> 2:04:34.520]  on you just said the whole key to it all it's my dna i just did it you didn't have to muster this
[2:04:35.080 --> 2:04:41.160]  in fact let me guess you want to go further you are holding back what you want to do i mean they
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:45.000]  call it poking the bear around here and they said brian would you please stop poking the bear
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:50.040]  every day i want to poke the bear i like to push the envelope and i don't like being told what to
[2:04:50.040 --> 2:04:57.320]  do well exactly brian because they poked us we'll be right back the ultimate turmeric and

[2:06:16.520 --> 2:06:24.280]  it is simply an extension of what began in the old one it is patterned itself after every dictator
[2:06:24.280 --> 2:06:29.320]  who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of
[2:06:29.320 --> 2:06:36.600]  time it has refinements technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction
[2:06:36.600 --> 2:06:43.160]  of human freedom but like every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule
[2:06:43.160 --> 2:06:46.600]  logic is an enemy and truth is a menace
[2:06:51.560 --> 2:06:58.360]  this is mr romney wordsworth in his last 48 hours on earth he's a citizen of the state
[2:06:58.360 --> 2:07:04.600]  but will soon have to be eliminated because he is built out of flesh and because he has a mind
[2:07:04.600 --> 2:07:13.720]  you've been under investigation mr wordsworth for the mandatory period of one year and 11
[2:07:13.720 --> 2:07:17.720]  months you're found to be obsolete the purpose of this hearing is to make a finding in the matter
[2:07:17.720 --> 2:07:20.680]  and make a sentence accordingly do you understand that mr wordsworth
[2:07:23.320 --> 2:07:28.040]  your occupation mr wordsworth a librarian's
[2:07:28.040 --> 2:07:32.600]  a library
[2:07:35.240 --> 2:07:42.200]  having to do with books yes sir books
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:49.960]  but since there are no more books mr wordsworth there are no more libraries
[2:07:50.600 --> 2:07:54.840]  the field investigators in your sector have classified you as obsolete
[2:07:54.840 --> 2:08:03.000]  your rights are as follows mr wordsworth you are to be liquidated within a period of 48 hours
[2:08:05.640 --> 2:08:13.000]  you are obsolete mr wordsworth a lie no man is obsolete you have no function mr wordsworth
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:18.280]  you're an anachronism like a ghost from another time i am nothing more than a reminder to you
[2:08:18.280 --> 2:08:24.760]  that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages you're a bug mr wordsworth a crawling insect
[2:08:24.760 --> 2:08:30.520]  an ugly misinformed little creature who has no purpose here no meaning i am a human being
[2:08:31.240 --> 2:08:40.120]  delusions mr wordsworth delusions that you inject into your veins with printer's ink the narcotics
[2:08:40.120 --> 2:08:47.320]  that you call literature poetry essays of all kind all of it are opiate you have nothing but spindly
[2:08:47.320 --> 2:08:54.920]  limbs and a dream and the state has no use for your kind i don't care i tell you i don't care
[2:08:54.920 --> 2:09:02.840]  i'm a human being i exist and if i speak one for a loud that thought lives even after i'm
[2:09:02.840 --> 2:09:18.120]  shoveled into my grave the chancellor the late chancellor was only partly correct he was obsolete but so is the state the entity he worshipped any state any
[2:09:18.120 --> 2:09:25.160]  entity any ideology that fails to recognize the worth the dignity the rights of man that state is obsolete
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:37.000]  we are not non-essential we are not obsolete the nest of the hour joined by brian rose
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:41.880]  london real dot tv i could ask you a thousand questions brian i'm well known for interruptions
[2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:46.120]  i've got a lot of things to say but take over what do you want to say right now to everybody
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:52.520]  well first of all i love watching those uh twilight zone clips and nothing cuts through
[2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:57.160]  the soul like black and white rod serling telling you exactly how it is and you know those words
[2:09:57.160 --> 2:10:03.000]  really reverberated with me you know for me what's been saving me this last week has been
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:07.240]  the mobilization of what we're calling the london real army around the world they've really
[2:10:07.240 --> 2:10:11.720]  come out of the woodwork and said brian we completely believe in you we know we've been
[2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:17.400]  watching you for nine years we feel your authenticity and like you told me alex when you were a guest on
[2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:23.800]  my show last week that's what scares them is the authenticity of a conversation between two people
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:29.640]  in a room that's unedited and scripted that alone is the scariest thing in the world it's the human
[2:10:29.640 --> 2:10:33.240]  i said i wouldn't interrupt but it's the human interaction they want to shut down it's that magic
[2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:40.760]  you didn't social distance your show buddy yeah exactly there's energy in the show in that show
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:45.000]  and people feel it with their gut i think you said that to me alex and that's the most dangerous
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:50.440]  thing because people know there's something there and now it's the most banned piece of media on the
[2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:56.520]  internet and what has been interesting is seeing them pull out their credit cards and actually
[2:10:56.520 --> 2:11:01.240]  vote with their dollars and my grandpa was a hardworking cattle rancher from arizona and when
[2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:08.680]  i was a kid he said brian money talks and bs walks and to see them in these times on the brink of a
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:16.040]  global recession that we haven't seen in a hundred years to put out 250 000 with some 7 000 plus donors
[2:11:16.040 --> 2:11:21.640]  in just over 24 hours is blown my mind by the way i said i wouldn't that sounds like a lot of money
[2:11:21.640 --> 2:11:27.400]  just the servers cost that the cost so when your people need to support you support everybody
[2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:32.440]  to have your own platform this isn't allowed you've got to build this google has 700 billion dollars
[2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:38.360]  yeah it's so true there was a comment on one of my feeds yesterday it said i can stream for free
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:43.320]  and i said yeah i used to be able to stream for free until i was banned and now i've got to do it
[2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:49.480]  myself and again hundred thousand dollars for one stream and so we're building a war chest for freedom
[2:11:49.480 --> 2:11:54.760]  we're building a digital freedom platform that's its own entity and that way if they ban me if i go
[2:11:54.760 --> 2:12:00.280]  bankrupt if i disappear from this planet this thing will continue exactly people have to get used to
[2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:06.280]  investing in alternatives because we've been at youtube forever investing in their evil yeah it's
[2:12:06.280 --> 2:12:11.240]  so true and alex you said something earlier which i appreciate you are not a victim and i am not a
[2:12:11.240 --> 2:12:15.960]  victim and i put out a video about this recently because you know in this in this culture these
[2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:21.720]  days it was different than when you and i grew up we celebrate the victim not the hero and i don't
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:27.960]  want to be celebrated because poor old brian has been mistreated by the the goliath that's not how
[2:12:27.960 --> 2:12:34.520]  i do it i want you want to you want to dominate goliath rip his heart out yeah and i want to i
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:39.640]  say thank you to youtube because you've just provided me a solution and an army with financial
[2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:45.000]  banking that i didn't even know i had alex so thank you youtube you just put a quarter million
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:49.720]  dollars in this war chest for freedom and you just help us fight this fight so i look at every
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:55.400]  problem as actually an enabling act exactly what a victim mentality it's like you're powerless
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:13:00.600]  instead of understanding you don't know this attack if you reach out to others becomes power
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:07.320]  exactly and i want everyone following us to feel the same way you know it can't just be you and me
[2:13:07.320 --> 2:13:12.360]  at the front lines we need everybody to step up and be leaders in their own life in all ways and
[2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:17.400]  i'm telling the london army to get ready physically mentally for a fight financially
[2:13:17.400 --> 2:13:21.560]  because we need everybody out there leading and they are showing it with their credit cards
[2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:26.440]  and this is blowing people away you know i think it's got people scared at some of these big networks
[2:13:26.440 --> 2:13:31.400]  and now i mean now try to ban me i mean you got a lot of people there you got a lot of resources
[2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:36.200]  this makes us strong and uh again i'm just a vessel for this message that's all i'm trying to do
[2:13:36.200 --> 2:13:42.520]  honestly alex every morning i get up and say how can i step out of the way of this human force
[2:13:42.520 --> 2:13:46.680]  that does not want to be oppressed anymore well brian that's it i want to get into your
[2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:51.000]  points i say when i rub it here you make great points i have to add things i've watched your show
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:56.520]  a lot because i like watching a you know yogi leader or some you know god or russia or japan
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:14:02.520]  or africa i love the different topics i don't want to just hear politics you're pretty progressive
[2:14:02.520 --> 2:14:07.080]  pro-human not liberal progressive but you know your show is not even threatening them except
[2:14:07.080 --> 2:14:11.080]  it's real and they don't like the fact they don't own you and your show's getting more popular so
[2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:15.000]  they're just kind of coming by and saying we own you and you're saying no you don't but but but i mean
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:20.200]  that's what they're afraid of yeah that's a strange part alex this isn't a political show
[2:14:20.200 --> 2:14:26.040]  this isn't you know anything about you know conspiracies or protesting i have human conversations
[2:14:26.040 --> 2:14:31.480]  of all different kinds and uh you know at the end of the day we come to a final conclusion which is
[2:14:31.480 --> 2:14:36.920]  this we are all one aspect of humanity you know it's a it's a theme i hear from you a lot alex
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:41.320]  and this is the message we're putting out there and everyone needs to come together and move
[2:14:41.320 --> 2:14:45.400]  this forward and if you really love yourself and humanity then you've got a fight for these
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:49.560]  basic human rights and you know that's what we want to do this whole freedom of speech fight
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:55.880]  the freedom of the press i've never felt so vested in this and everyone is responding alongside of
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:14:59.880]  that so we're pushing forward it's nice to have people out there that are warning us of this
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:04.920]  hunger game society and these other issues it's good to put that front and center so we can act
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:09.480]  now so it doesn't happen well that's the thing they didn't ban your david i can interview because
[2:15:09.480 --> 2:15:15.320]  it was lies they banned it because it looked way better than some 200 million dollar production
[2:15:15.320 --> 2:15:19.720]  you know of something they celebrate like hofer or whatever i mean you watch you go man that was
[2:15:19.720 --> 2:15:24.840]  really fulfilling ryan did a great job david looked great it just the whole thing i watched it
[2:15:24.840 --> 2:15:28.920]  with my wife like i told you in the hot tub the pool cooking dinner we're first cooking dinner and
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:33.560]  the kids won't watch it and i'm like man that was really good and i looked at my wife and i said
[2:15:33.560 --> 2:15:37.720]  this will get banned the next day she runs in she goes it's banned it's banned how'd you know and i
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:44.280]  said well anything that good's banned i mean they they just can't deal with the authentic
[2:15:44.280 --> 2:15:49.640]  deal with the authenticity the human to human what he just said earlier is what they fear it's human
[2:15:49.640 --> 2:15:56.200]  to human i'll do a podcast called human to human attention all radio listeners who still need food

[2:16:12.360 --> 2:16:18.200]  anything from china and italy it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns are just a few days away

[2:18:54.120 --> 2:19:00.320]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion
[2:19:00.320 --> 2:19:06.600]  people, extra 500 million, are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all
[2:19:06.600 --> 2:19:09.860]  the millions already starving because of the global lockdown.
[2:19:09.860 --> 2:19:15.000]  That is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19, and
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:19.440]  the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization
[2:19:19.440 --> 2:19:24.480]  with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society,
[2:19:24.480 --> 2:19:26.800]  create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[2:19:26.800 --> 2:19:27.800]  This is insane.
[2:19:27.800 --> 2:19:30.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:33.740]  You need to get prepared now, you need to get high quality, swarble food now back in
[2:19:33.740 --> 2:19:38.920]  stock at infowarstore.com, and you need to get politically active and challenge this
[2:19:38.920 --> 2:19:40.640]  verbally everywhere.
[2:19:40.640 --> 2:19:44.440]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't
[2:19:44.440 --> 2:19:47.000]  even challenge verbally social distancing.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:48.840]  This is beyond 1984.
[2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:50.520]  The tyranny of the dual orders here.
[2:19:50.520 --> 2:19:52.920]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the info war.
[2:19:52.920 --> 2:19:57.920]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[2:19:57.920 --> 2:20:22.920]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:22.920 --> 2:20:30.360]  It's a show that talks about tens of millions of extra people starving to death right now
[2:20:30.360 --> 2:20:34.160]  in the UN in the midst of the lockdown, but I'm a person that's definitely rooted in
[2:20:34.160 --> 2:20:38.800]  reality, and I know the globalists want to get rid of the population, and I know that
[2:20:38.800 --> 2:20:42.840]  when they get me to accept killing old people and they get me to accept starving the third
[2:20:42.840 --> 2:20:47.440]  world to death, that that's really myself and my family that are targeted.
[2:20:47.440 --> 2:20:52.320]  So I care about those people that are being killed, but I care about them out of self-interest
[2:20:52.320 --> 2:20:59.320]  and Brian Roses, our guest at LondonReal.tv, been around a decade, millions of people
[2:20:59.320 --> 2:21:03.760]  reached every few days, does some David Ike interview, he's done them before, they go
[2:21:03.760 --> 2:21:08.880]  super viral, they're set to go number one, and they kill it.
[2:21:08.880 --> 2:21:13.520]  And almost everybody else I know, including some of the biggest names out there that I
[2:21:13.520 --> 2:21:18.560]  won't mention, they get threatened and they roll over.
[2:21:18.560 --> 2:21:25.960]  And so I'm not gushing over Brian, it's just good to run into people, so many talk show
[2:21:25.960 --> 2:21:32.480]  hosts that are big out there, that are well-known names who were told don't go on Ellen Stone's
[2:21:32.480 --> 2:21:36.680]  show or don't talk about these issues or will ban you, and they rolled over, and then it's
[2:21:36.680 --> 2:21:41.800]  always more, more, more, more, and like, what's your soul worth?
[2:21:41.800 --> 2:21:48.280]  Because I mean, for me, the feeling of having somebody call me up from YouTube or from some
[2:21:48.280 --> 2:21:54.640]  syndicated radio network and tell me every week, oh, we don't like this thing you did,
[2:21:54.640 --> 2:21:59.880]  we want you to do that, and then pretty soon it's like, hey, my cousin's got a product,
[2:21:59.880 --> 2:22:05.280]  we want you to plug it, and you're literally talking to somebody who doesn't even run the
[2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:11.040]  network, they're just there telling you what you're going to do and you're not your own
[2:22:11.040 --> 2:22:14.920]  man, and you just realize, this is slavery, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:22:14.920 --> 2:22:20.320]  So going back to you, Brian, I want to get into other subjects next segment, this is
[2:22:20.320 --> 2:22:24.640]  a shorter segment, but just, what would you call this period of history we're in right
[2:22:24.640 --> 2:22:25.640]  now?
[2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:28.440]  Because you see it, you go out in the store, people love you more than ever, you're standing
[2:22:28.440 --> 2:22:32.880]  up, it's kind of best of times, worst of times, tell the two cities.
[2:22:32.880 --> 2:22:39.040]  Yeah, it's almost like the great awakening, you know, combined with the great recession
[2:22:39.040 --> 2:22:43.240]  that's pending, and I'm really concerned about this economy, I really think it's about time
[2:22:43.240 --> 2:22:48.160]  we get hard working people back to work, and you talked about some of these collateral
[2:22:48.160 --> 2:22:52.520]  damage that's going to start to be seen around the world, and I'm worried about that, and
[2:22:52.520 --> 2:22:57.080]  I think people have gone from fearing the virus and fearing death, to fearing for their
[2:22:57.080 --> 2:23:02.880]  own livelihood, for their family, and for the future, and people are worried, and people
[2:23:02.880 --> 2:23:06.800]  are asking me, Brian, what do I do, and I've been trying to put on these master classes
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:11.280]  and teach them how to digitize their businesses, and trying to give them that hope, but I really
[2:23:11.280 --> 2:23:15.680]  think we'll look back on this time in ten years, and find out what did we learn, and
[2:23:15.680 --> 2:23:21.000]  did we grow, or did we cower, and I see signs everywhere, Alex, that this is going to be
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:24.960]  one of our greatest moments, but it takes that leadership, and I keep trying to put
[2:23:24.960 --> 2:23:30.240]  it back on, you know, the people that watch me, the London Real Army, I need you to lead,
[2:23:30.240 --> 2:23:32.160]  even in small ways, in your life.
[2:23:32.160 --> 2:23:34.440]  Anything you can do, you have to resist the temptation.
[2:23:34.440 --> 2:23:38.360]  Exactly, they need to quit thinking of like, a Brian Rose, or an Alex Jones, or a David
[2:23:38.360 --> 2:23:43.120]  Iker, or Donald Trump, is up there doing it, no, they're literally the electricity down
[2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:48.200]  the power line, they're not just part of it, they're everything, we're just a small focal
[2:23:48.200 --> 2:23:52.880]  point, or a little manifestation of a river going by, we're a little eddy pool that looks
[2:23:52.880 --> 2:23:57.440]  like a face for a moment, but then we disappear, but it's that river of all of us together
[2:23:57.440 --> 2:23:59.680]  that's the power.
[2:23:59.680 --> 2:24:04.200]  Very much so, and you know, I've always been a guy that doesn't ask for help, I do it myself,
[2:24:04.200 --> 2:24:07.960]  and so this was a real learning experience for me, to do this whole crowdfunding piece,
[2:24:07.960 --> 2:24:12.520]  but I understand, because I was giving them an opportunity to step up, and even give five
[2:24:12.520 --> 2:24:15.040]  bucks, which I know they don't have, or they could use for anything.
[2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:18.200]  By the way, I'm not bragging, but we were talking a few weeks ago, and I said, Brian,
[2:24:18.200 --> 2:24:22.880]  you always fund this off your own money, and like, it's bad, I said, I said, they tried
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:27.440]  to shut me down too, you need to ask them for support, they want to support you.
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:30.440]  Yeah, I mean Alex, you've led the way in showing capital.
[2:24:30.440 --> 2:24:33.400]  Well, I was just trying to get attention, I'm just saying, I was in the same position
[2:24:33.400 --> 2:24:38.240]  as you 15 years ago, we're like men, we're like, I can do this myself, I'll fund this
[2:24:38.240 --> 2:24:41.040]  money, no, we have to ask for help.
[2:24:41.040 --> 2:24:44.760]  I know it's the hardest thing to ask for help, it really is, but talk about that, because
[2:24:44.760 --> 2:24:49.120]  you're a big banker, successful, but what was it like to ask for, doesn't it feel good?
[2:24:49.120 --> 2:24:53.160]  Because it's nothing, we're not weak when we ask for help, we're all together here.
[2:24:53.160 --> 2:24:57.200]  Yeah, I mean, one of the big components of my show, if you watch is that vulnerability,
[2:24:57.200 --> 2:25:03.040]  you know, I'll have championship boxers on that will cry 90 minutes into the show, because
[2:25:03.040 --> 2:25:08.680]  they're reliving a moment in their life that actually made them so powerful in order to
[2:25:08.680 --> 2:25:12.640]  win that title because they owed a promise to their dying grandmother, because they were
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:13.640]  abused as a child.
[2:25:13.640 --> 2:25:19.120]  So I'm all about that on my show, embracing it myself was really new, Alex.
[2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:23.680]  But again, it's about me getting out of the way and empowering those people and now it's
[2:25:23.680 --> 2:25:24.960]  our fight.
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:28.760]  And now it's literally it's a thousand times stronger and what is it like when you have
[2:25:28.760 --> 2:25:32.640]  done everything yourself and you're finally desperate, it's not about you, it's about
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:36.520]  the mission, you reach up for help and the arm that reached out is even more powerful
[2:25:36.520 --> 2:25:37.520]  than you thought.
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:41.400]  And all of a sudden it's like electricity, you're like, oh, my God, I want other people
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:42.760]  to experience this.
[2:25:42.760 --> 2:25:43.760]  I need help.
[2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:44.760]  They need help.
[2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:45.760]  We come together.
[2:25:45.760 --> 2:25:46.760]  And it's incredible.
[2:25:46.760 --> 2:25:49.480]  Again, it's a feeling I've never felt before.
[2:25:49.480 --> 2:25:51.080]  It's real human connection.
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:55.600]  I mean, to have people that actually have your back, you know, it's not about the money,
[2:25:55.600 --> 2:26:00.760]  but to just see that piling up as a symbol of their support, yeah, it quantifies the
[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:02.880]  love and support out there.
[2:26:02.880 --> 2:26:05.160]  And I've never felt that in nine years, Alex.
[2:26:05.160 --> 2:26:06.160]  I've never felt it.
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:07.160]  Well, we were talking.
[2:26:07.160 --> 2:26:08.160]  You can do this off on record.
[2:26:08.160 --> 2:26:09.160]  I'll do it.
[2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:10.660]  Two weeks ago, you were, you were like, I'm going to go forward.
[2:26:10.660 --> 2:26:11.660]  I don't know.
[2:26:11.660 --> 2:26:12.660]  They're trying to bank.
[2:26:12.660 --> 2:26:14.640]  I said, just ask for the support.
[2:26:14.640 --> 2:26:16.160]  It's going to be bigger than you knew.
[2:26:16.160 --> 2:26:17.920]  And I'm not saying it's I did this.
[2:26:17.920 --> 2:26:19.960]  We were having discussion of people behind the scenes.
[2:26:19.960 --> 2:26:23.520]  This is a real discussion and you made the right decision and it's and you're going to
[2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:26.400]  get persecuted for this, but it's just going to get better and better.
[2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:29.200]  That's what people to know is they shouldn't be scared of the persecution.
[2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:34.480]  Yeah, it's rough up front, but it just gets better every time you go through that storm.
[2:26:34.480 --> 2:26:35.480]  Yeah.
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:38.040]  You know, with with love, you're going to have hate.
[2:26:38.040 --> 2:26:42.860]  And you know, I think that hate is actually just a slight perturbing of the frequency
[2:26:42.860 --> 2:26:43.860]  of love.
[2:26:43.860 --> 2:26:46.440]  I think it's someone that really wants to love you, but their ego is getting in the
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:49.720]  way and they have to say, oh, that guy is that rich banker.
[2:26:49.720 --> 2:26:51.080]  He's just trying to get my money.
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:55.280]  But I think really they're like, wow, I wish I could be like you and I appreciate you standing
[2:26:55.280 --> 2:26:56.680]  up for my freedoms.
[2:26:56.680 --> 2:26:58.000]  It just gets a little twisted.
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:01.280]  And look, when you and I were young men, Alex, I'm sure we had those same feelings about
[2:27:01.280 --> 2:27:02.520]  some figures.
[2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:04.480]  So I just look at it all as energy.
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:05.480]  And yeah, I have taken flag.
[2:27:05.480 --> 2:27:06.480]  Oh, exactly.
[2:27:06.480 --> 2:27:10.800]  I remember as a child, looking up to movie stars and looking up to Arnold Schwarzenegger
[2:27:10.800 --> 2:27:14.960]  and and like, but hating him at the same time when you grow up as a man, you realize how
[2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:18.280]  powerful and how weak we are at the same time that becomes a joke is that what you're getting
[2:27:18.280 --> 2:27:19.280]  at?
[2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:20.280]  Yeah.
[2:27:20.280 --> 2:27:22.560]  I mean, look, hate is just love that's been slightly perturbed.
[2:27:22.560 --> 2:27:25.480]  So it's all energy and it's all interaction.
[2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:28.920]  So when someone's out there hating me, I'm like, oh, I see where you're coming from.
[2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:30.320]  I used to be there too.
[2:27:30.320 --> 2:27:33.920]  I hate you at least they're focused on you.
[2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:34.920]  Yeah.
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:35.920]  Very much so.
[2:27:35.920 --> 2:27:38.000]  And I represent something that they aspire to.
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  And that's great.
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:41.120]  And again, I want everyone to come along on this journey.
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:45.120]  But yeah, it's that's why I feel so alive right now, Alex, because this has been incredible.
[2:27:45.120 --> 2:27:48.080]  I've never felt this support from people.
[2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:50.240]  I literally it blew me away yesterday.
[2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:54.080]  You know, I woke up in the morning and there was like 15,000 raised.
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:59.240]  We hit the 100,000 by six o'clock and literally we were all jaw drop shocked around here.
[2:27:59.240 --> 2:28:00.760]  And so it's just been amazing.
[2:28:00.760 --> 2:28:03.880]  Well, you know, my joke statement, I'm not bragging and I know you do this on your own,
[2:28:03.880 --> 2:28:06.680]  but I told you, I said, you know, I'm embracing and I don't care.
[2:28:06.680 --> 2:28:09.320]  And I said, you need to ask for support.
[2:28:09.320 --> 2:28:10.320]  You're already planning.
[2:28:10.320 --> 2:28:11.320]  And I know.
[2:28:11.320 --> 2:28:12.320]  But I mean, it's good.
[2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:13.320]  People want to do this.
[2:28:13.320 --> 2:28:17.040]  They want to fight back, brother, and they want leaders that aren't backing down.
[2:28:17.040 --> 2:28:18.280]  They want leaders.
[2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:19.280]  Yeah.
[2:28:19.280 --> 2:28:20.440]  And I asked you off camera.
[2:28:20.440 --> 2:28:22.560]  I mean, you've you've you've got the roadmap on this.
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:26.000]  And I just said, Alex, what can I expect to happen because I don't see what's coming.
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  And it's the shot.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:28.200]  You don't see that knocks you out.
[2:28:28.200 --> 2:28:30.560]  And you said, look, Brian, these are a few things that are going to happen.
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:32.640]  And this is what you can do.
[2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:34.520]  This has been one of the greatest moves we made.
[2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:39.640]  It's just so empowering and it's still blown me away, but it's giving me even more energy
[2:28:39.640 --> 2:28:40.640]  if that was even possible.
[2:28:40.640 --> 2:28:41.640]  Exactly.
[2:28:41.640 --> 2:28:45.440]  What I'm saying is like a fever of a data when they knock over the dominoes, everybody
[2:28:45.440 --> 2:28:49.720]  has to make the decision in life to make the right decision that God will carry the
[2:28:49.720 --> 2:28:50.720]  rest of the way.
[2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:58.240]  And Brian Rose, if you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:58.240 --> 2:29:00.160]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[2:29:00.160 --> 2:29:05.040]  I had a problem like you once I drank and used to party a little too much till it got
[2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:08.400]  out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:13.680]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:18.880]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:22.000]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:26.720]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[2:29:26.720 --> 2:29:29.000]  and totally change your life.
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:34.240]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:34.240 --> 2:29:37.520]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[2:29:37.520 --> 2:29:38.520]  Get clean.
[2:29:38.520 --> 2:29:48.440]  Call now and learn more, 800-506-6740-800-506-6740.
[2:29:48.440 --> 2:29:59.440]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[2:29:59.440 --> 2:30:05.240]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled drinks can give you a short boost, but the
[2:30:05.240 --> 2:30:07.760]  crash always follows.
[2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:14.200]  That's why we created a Mixable Energy Formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
[2:30:14.200 --> 2:30:15.200]  Turbo Force.
[2:30:15.200 --> 2:30:21.560]  Similar to other mix-in energy packets, Turbo Force from Infowars Life utilizes vitamins,
[2:30:21.560 --> 2:30:28.640]  amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide focus,
[2:30:28.640 --> 2:30:31.880]  clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[2:30:31.880 --> 2:30:39.000]  Turbo Force is certainly a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:44.480]  And speaking of affordable, you can even try Turbo Force for a limited time at an incredible
[2:30:44.480 --> 2:30:46.640]  40% off.
[2:30:46.640 --> 2:30:55.080]  Don't wait till it's out of stock again and get Turbo Force right now, only at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:30:55.080 --> 2:31:00.200]  It's been sold out for more than four months, but our best-selling vitamin D3 and vitamin
[2:31:00.200 --> 2:31:04.560]  K formula is back in stock, Winter Sun.
[2:31:04.560 --> 2:31:08.120]  In the fall, in the winter, as you know, your body, when you're not getting sunlight on
[2:31:08.120 --> 2:31:14.000]  the skin, does not produce vitamin D3, so it's important to ingest it.
[2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:18.720]  But a lot of people do not absorb it well in the gut, so you take this formula under
[2:31:18.720 --> 2:31:24.240]  the tongue, it tastes sweet naturally, let it sit there about 30 seconds to a minute,
[2:31:24.240 --> 2:31:28.080]  and then you swallow the rest, and it's just amazing.
[2:31:28.080 --> 2:31:33.080]  It's back in stock, and yes, we're going to offer it at 50% off because that's the right
[2:31:33.080 --> 2:31:36.680]  thing to do during this crisis, so Winter Sun, 50% off.
[2:31:36.680 --> 2:31:40.440]  We also have Ultra 12, highest quality B12.
[2:31:40.440 --> 2:31:45.280]  That is also available, take it out of the tongue, 50% off, InfowarsStore.com, and we
[2:31:45.280 --> 2:31:49.680]  have X3, but though it's going to sell out, super high quality for a thawedine, it is
[2:31:49.680 --> 2:31:54.080]  60% off because I want you to have it right now, InfowarsStore.com.
[2:31:54.080 --> 2:32:00.560]  Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy
[2:32:00.560 --> 2:32:05.400]  used by half, and the United States wouldn't sign on to it, so guess what happened?
[2:32:05.400 --> 2:32:11.520]  The long came COVID-19, and Bill Gates is celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint
[2:32:11.520 --> 2:32:17.080]  by half, and that means you're going to be poor now, and under his control, and of course,
[2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:21.520]  with the medical tyranny comes the forced inoculations, a eek microchip that comes
[2:32:21.520 --> 2:32:27.160]  with the vaccine, and so much more, and Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get
[2:32:27.160 --> 2:32:32.560]  sick and die from it, so remember folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy
[2:32:32.560 --> 2:32:33.560]  your basic rights.
[2:32:33.560 --> 2:32:38.240]  The same left that says, kill babies all day long, women own their bodies, now say you
[2:32:38.240 --> 2:32:42.320]  don't own your body, and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you, and if you don't
[2:32:42.320 --> 2:32:46.840]  submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home, mark the beast, oh, and guess what?
[2:32:46.840 --> 2:32:50.440]  Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates under a bunch
[2:32:50.440 --> 2:33:07.480]  of dirty devil worshipers in your face, they hate you and your family.
[2:33:07.480 --> 2:33:23.520]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on, for your mind.
[2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:33.440]  Welcome back on your host Alex Jones, so is Trump a savior, or is he a devil, is he
[2:33:33.440 --> 2:33:38.000]  a saint, or is he a leave with Satan?
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:43.280]  Now I know Trump, and you know, it means nothing to me to know a president, it means nothing
[2:33:43.280 --> 2:33:44.280]  to me.
[2:33:44.280 --> 2:33:48.720]  Big wake up call 20 years ago, more than 20 years ago, immediately, Hollywood collects
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:57.000]  people like baseball cards, and, I mean, 25 years ago, I was at major directors houses,
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:34:02.560]  I was at major parties, Brad Pitt was walking by, and I'm like, why am I here, and it was
[2:34:02.560 --> 2:34:07.420]  because they were collecting intellectuals, what they saw as intellectuals, and they
[2:34:07.420 --> 2:34:12.120]  saw the potential.
[2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:18.360]  And then I sit there, and I watch this hysteria, and by the way, I'm out here on the air going,
[2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:21.480]  oh, Hollywood tried to get me involved with him, like that's cool, it's like saying I
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:24.960]  rolled around on a dead animal on the side of the road or something, it's like, once
[2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:31.120]  I, you know, took a nap in a bathroom on the side of the highway, you know, it's not like
[2:34:31.120 --> 2:34:36.440]  I'm like bragging about something, but they put that up there, like it's this unattainable
[2:34:36.440 --> 2:34:42.560]  magic world, none of that fulfilled me, and that's why I didn't go along with it.
[2:34:42.560 --> 2:34:47.080]  People were like, why are you in these big movies, well, I had no idea what was even
[2:34:47.080 --> 2:34:53.560]  going on, until I did, and once I figured out what was really going on, I was like,
[2:34:53.560 --> 2:35:01.080]  you couldn't pay me all the money on the planet to be part of this, but see, not fighting
[2:35:01.080 --> 2:35:04.600]  it is the same as going along with it.
[2:35:04.600 --> 2:35:08.280]  That's what the Bible says, you were lukewarm, so I spit you out of your mouth.
[2:35:08.280 --> 2:35:12.520]  If you fight it, you're against it, but if you don't do anything, it's the same as going
[2:35:12.520 --> 2:35:13.520]  along with it.
[2:35:13.520 --> 2:35:19.360]  So, I wanted to ask Brian Rose, let's get some political questions with him.
[2:35:19.360 --> 2:35:23.520]  What does he really think about President Trump, because that's the big zeitgeist, and
[2:35:23.520 --> 2:35:27.760]  what does he think about this lockdown, he's an economist, he's been a successful banker,
[2:35:27.760 --> 2:35:33.800]  and this headline, Coronavirus Pandemic Will Cause Famine and Biblical Proportions, UN
[2:35:33.800 --> 2:35:42.320]  says, London Guardian, but that's not true, it's the lockdown, the lockdown.
[2:35:42.320 --> 2:35:48.800]  That's what's causing it, and sure, there's real deaths, but they're so small compared
[2:35:48.800 --> 2:35:55.120]  to what the mass deaths causing, and then I try to mention it, and the people attacking
[2:35:55.120 --> 2:36:04.080]  me have no idea that I know about the advertising firms that paid them money.
[2:36:04.080 --> 2:36:07.320]  And that's the other thing, I intended to come on here today, because it was the right
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:14.840]  thing to do, and talk about some of the groups I know are getting communist Chinese money,
[2:36:14.840 --> 2:36:19.280]  and I don't know why, Brian, I can't even say their names.
[2:36:19.280 --> 2:36:26.240]  Maybe I will tomorrow, but that's an example of this whole metaphysical thing, sometimes
[2:36:26.240 --> 2:36:31.080]  I consciously decide to say something, but then there's this other force comes in, and
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:34.080]  it's always right, that's why I've learned to follow it, because I can override that
[2:36:34.080 --> 2:36:39.640]  force, I don't even know what it is, I mean it's God, but it's like, and people say, what
[2:36:39.640 --> 2:36:44.080]  does this mean, I don't know, that's why I'm saying to listeners, what is it, where I'm
[2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:49.840]  ready to say something, I can say it, I'm not scared to say it, but then I don't say it,
[2:36:49.840 --> 2:36:56.920]  I guess that's God's mystery, but again, I'm babbling here, what do you think's really
[2:36:56.920 --> 2:37:01.720]  behind this virus, what do you think's really behind Trump, what do you think's behind crude
[2:37:01.720 --> 2:37:08.440]  oil at zero, and 30 million starving to death that UN says right now, but nobody cares,
[2:37:08.440 --> 2:37:14.400]  and I mean, what is this time we're in, Brian Rose?
[2:37:14.400 --> 2:37:18.360]  Well you mentioned trusting your gut, Alex, and I think that's really an essential component
[2:37:18.360 --> 2:37:22.080]  here, but it's so hard to do when your brain is being scrambled by all these mixed messages,
[2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:26.000]  and when I see Trump at these nightly news conferences, and I watch him every night,
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:32.880]  I find them quite soothing and calming somehow, I see a man that's trying to trust his gut,
[2:37:32.880 --> 2:37:37.200]  and yet he's surrounded by people that are giving him conflicting logic, and he knows
[2:37:37.200 --> 2:37:42.840]  deep down inside that getting America back to work is the ultimate solution here on so
[2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:48.280]  many levels, and yet he's battling lots of strange forces, sometimes the same ones on
[2:37:48.280 --> 2:37:53.360]  that stage in the press room that obviously have conflicting agendas, and the many are
[2:37:53.360 --> 2:37:59.480]  being punished for what's happening to the few here, and there must be another way out,
[2:37:59.480 --> 2:38:04.920]  Alex, it's just madness, when you take a bird's eye view of what's happening, it makes no sense,
[2:38:04.920 --> 2:38:10.200]  but in a microscope we've been convinced that it does, and so I think something's building
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:14.600]  up here where you're going to see a major decision that he makes, either that or the
[2:38:14.600 --> 2:38:17.840]  public are going to get to a point, and you've seen the protests in Austin everywhere around
[2:38:17.840 --> 2:38:21.360]  the world where people just won't have it, because they're going to be marginalized,
[2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:25.720]  this is going to have a generational effect on the class system, on people's wealth, on
[2:38:25.720 --> 2:38:29.920]  their livelihoods, and at some point they're going to snap, and I'm seeing it, I'm feeling
[2:38:29.920 --> 2:38:35.320]  it, people are asking me, strangely enough people are joining my courses at record levels
[2:38:35.320 --> 2:38:39.880]  so they can learn how to take advantage of this information economy that we're in now
[2:38:39.880 --> 2:38:44.440]  as opposed to this old industrial economy, so people are looking for ways out Alex,
[2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:48.880]  they're clamoring for them, and I'm asking them, how are you going to be remembered
[2:38:48.880 --> 2:38:53.320]  in 2020, as someone who was fighting in the front lines, and sure you're going to get
[2:38:53.320 --> 2:38:57.200]  damaged, you might bleed, you might die, or do you want to be known as someone that lets
[2:38:57.200 --> 2:39:02.040]  someone else fight for their freedom, that's the question you need to ask yourself, we
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:05.440]  need to get back to work, we need to find a way, that's my message.
[2:39:05.440 --> 2:39:09.840]  Well that's incredible, I'm going to play that every hour of the next week here, Brian
[2:39:09.840 --> 2:39:16.480]  Rose, you're absolutely right, and you can see at a spiritual, at a genetic level, Trump's
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:20.040]  for real, he's not perfect, but he's really trying to be president, he's really trying
[2:39:20.040 --> 2:39:25.080]  to empower people, and he's just surrounded by a bunch of liars, and he's gone through
[2:39:25.080 --> 2:39:30.960]  so many tribulations, but every tribulation we go through together with him, it just gets
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:36.720]  worse, there's got to be some point where you cut the head off the snake.
[2:39:36.720 --> 2:39:40.520]  You know Alex, you've seen what I do here, it's two hours of long form conversations
[2:39:40.520 --> 2:39:44.840]  where you get to see the real person, because we don't edit anything, and funny enough Alex,
[2:39:44.840 --> 2:39:49.280]  that's what these new conferences are, you see Trump for 90 minutes, two hours being
[2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:54.120]  real, and I can see inside a man who deeply cares about the American people, I don't care
[2:39:54.120 --> 2:39:58.600]  what anyone says, when he describes those doctors suiting up to that hospital, going
[2:39:58.600 --> 2:40:03.040]  to that hospital in Queens, which is next door to where he grew up, he feels, he calls
[2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:08.080]  them heroes, he's almost breaking into tears, so for anybody that says this man isn't genuinely
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:12.280]  aligned with their interests, I don't believe it, and that's been the most eye-opening thing
[2:40:12.280 --> 2:40:17.360]  for me ever, to see that real authentic person, and there's nobody else out there that has
[2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:24.640]  the Trump I've never put on air, because I don't have words to describe how authentic
[2:40:24.640 --> 2:40:27.280]  it is, like you think Trump on TV is authentic, when I've had these long conversations with
[2:40:27.280 --> 2:40:31.720]  Trump, and he's like, listen, I always believe in God, but I've been prayed for at these
[2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:35.400]  churches, these black churches have you felt, Alex, I've never been on a rock concert that
[2:40:35.400 --> 2:40:42.560]  has that much spirit, you know, we're gonna free American Christians, and I'm like, sir,
[2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:45.720]  that's not my big lobbying point, he's like, I know, I just, what do you think about the
[2:40:45.720 --> 2:40:49.840]  spirit of those rallies, I wanna talk about the spirit, I go, well, sir, I feel it, I'm
[2:40:49.840 --> 2:40:55.280]  a Christian, I know, again, I was never not a Christian, but I feel it so strong now,
[2:40:55.280 --> 2:41:00.280]  when you see him on TV going, I'm a changed man, I felt God, he literally has, not getting
[2:41:00.280 --> 2:41:05.000]  a holy roller here, but he's got the Holy Spirit, Trump never had this till I think
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:09.480]  he was like running for president, he wasn't a devil worshiper, but he was kind of in between,
[2:41:09.480 --> 2:41:15.480]  I think like Saul in the Rhodes of Damascus, Trump got hit by the bolt of lightning.
[2:41:15.480 --> 2:41:20.200]  I think so, and I think these difficult times has made it happen even more, it's elevated
[2:41:20.200 --> 2:41:25.960]  his consciousness, his energy, and he is a spiritual guy, you know, I'm expecting him
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:30.160]  to get emotional at one of these things, and I think that's a powerful thing, again, back
[2:41:30.160 --> 2:41:34.600]  to what you said, you know, vulnerability can show you that someone's real, it's where
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:39.080]  the fight comes from in people, and this man deeply cares, and he's working so hard on
[2:41:39.080 --> 2:41:40.080]  this.
[2:41:40.080 --> 2:41:42.640]  Well, see that's the thing, when Trump listens to my show, and I know he's gonna watch this
[2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:47.080]  probably later, I'm not bragging about this, this is real folks, he feels the spirit of
[2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:51.160]  authenticity, and that's what I'm saying is the more you have it, the more I have it,
[2:41:51.160 --> 2:41:56.360]  the more he has it, the more we all have it, that's what is the spirit, it's being real,
[2:41:56.360 --> 2:42:01.720]  like sin is lying about who you are, instead of just coming together and not being insecure.
[2:42:01.720 --> 2:42:05.720]  Yeah, that's what we need to do, and that's the ultimate lesson today, I think, is be
[2:42:05.720 --> 2:42:10.440]  authentic, be yourself, speak your mind, that's one of the things that David Ike always says
[2:42:10.440 --> 2:42:14.680]  at the end of my episodes, he says, Brian, speak your mind, say how you feel, don't worry
[2:42:14.680 --> 2:42:19.440]  about what Twitter says you should say, or the politically correct thing to say, go with
[2:42:19.440 --> 2:42:24.400]  your gut, be authentic, and just say it, and move forward like that, and I think that's
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:29.360]  just incredible advice, we all self-censor way too much these days, I think that is one
[2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:33.080]  of the paths forward, that taking action and moving into the fear.
[2:42:33.080 --> 2:42:37.720]  Alright, let's get Brian Rose's predictions straight ahead here folks, you gotta go to
[2:42:37.720 --> 2:42:43.160]  LondonReal.tv, support him, I know what it's like when they censor you, like happened
[2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:47.440]  two years ago, we had to spit everything we had just to launch the servers, please go
[2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:51.720]  support him, it's hard to tell the truth, help him get up on his feet to really fight
[2:42:51.720 --> 2:42:54.000]  the enemy.
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:58.080]  How do you put a people under house arrest, how do you put them under siege, well you
[2:42:58.080 --> 2:43:03.360]  tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist
[2:43:03.360 --> 2:43:08.440]  deep state, and then had China release, to then take down the populist president and
[2:43:08.440 --> 2:43:13.880]  those pesky American people that have become too uppity, Bill Ma or even admitted it, man
[2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:19.080]  I hope we have a depression, and now they've tailored the whole thing, with the big corporations
[2:43:19.080 --> 2:43:25.000]  and the media are gonna keep the country closed along with the help of the blue states, all
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:30.280]  the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates,
[2:43:30.280 --> 2:43:35.600]  and America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us, but as for me, I'm not sitting
[2:43:35.600 --> 2:43:39.920]  here and I'm not taking it, it's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're
[2:43:39.920 --> 2:43:44.360]  the good people keeping everybody safe, but that's not what they're doing, they are pulling
[2:43:44.360 --> 2:43:50.560]  America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health, our whole world and
[2:43:50.560 --> 2:43:53.640]  committing millions of third world people to death.
[2:43:53.640 --> 2:43:58.160]  There's a process where you take a stallion and you tie him down and you cut his testicles
[2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:02.880]  off and then he becomes gelded, well that's what's happening to the entire world right
[2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:06.800]  now, we're going into deep, deep tyranny, places like North Korea and China are going
[2:44:06.800 --> 2:44:11.680]  into deeper tyranny as well, it's all directed by the UN, it's all a big cooked up, giant
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:16.600]  plan to absolutely take control of your life, bankrupt the economy and make you dependent
[2:44:16.600 --> 2:44:22.800]  on the big mega banks, and to get your universal income you're gonna have to take the inoculations,
[2:44:22.800 --> 2:44:26.160]  brainwash your kids the way they say and have absolutely no freedom, and it's all happening
[2:44:26.160 --> 2:44:31.040]  boom overnight, this is a giant revolution, and as soon as you put the handcuffs on they
[2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:34.800]  said oh it's just an extended spring break two weeks, notice now it's 18 months, two
[2:44:34.800 --> 2:44:39.880]  years, five years, it never ends, no one can ever die from a virus again, government will
[2:44:39.880 --> 2:44:45.160]  save you, it's a takeover, it's the opposite, they're coming with forced inoculations on
[2:44:45.160 --> 2:44:50.120]  record, they'll reduce your fertility, lower your immunity, and in many cases kill you
[2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:57.120]  and they're telling you it's gonna hurt a lot of people.
[2:45:20.120 --> 2:45:47.560]  it's gonna get very very rough, so again ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to secure
[2:45:47.560 --> 2:45:51.280]  the number one thing you need, high quality storeable food, ready to get to you and your
[2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:54.520]  family now, if you get your orders in, then forstore.com.
[2:45:54.520 --> 2:46:00.040]  The official numbers are now in, the United States is in the biggest financial collapse
[2:46:00.040 --> 2:46:06.000]  in our history, this is the worst employment collapse in US history by a very wide margin,
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:10.680]  writes Michael Snyder at the Economic Collapse Block, at this point we should no longer speak
[2:46:10.680 --> 2:46:16.520]  of economic collapse as something that will happen in the future, it is now here, he does
[2:46:16.520 --> 2:46:23.160]  an excellent job in the article on infowars.com of laying it out, this was done by design,
[2:46:23.160 --> 2:46:28.560]  Trump fought to open the economy, but the hijacked blue cities and states with the
[2:46:28.560 --> 2:46:34.200]  tricombs and with hollywood and the media held America underwater until we sucked it
[2:46:34.200 --> 2:46:39.760]  into our lungs and now we're lying there like a fish dying, there's not much time to get
[2:46:39.760 --> 2:46:44.280]  the water out of our lungs, so remember for decades to come when millions starve to death
[2:46:44.280 --> 2:46:50.200]  worldwide and you live in slums with no medicine, the globalist did this, the globalist did
[2:46:50.200 --> 2:46:57.360]  this, the globalist did this, the globalist did this.
[2:46:57.360 --> 2:47:15.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:32.000]  You know, there's a lot of people tune into this syndicated radio TV show, over a million
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:40.240]  conservatively tuned in every hour and they'll say, man, Jones is sure praising this Brian
[2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:48.680]  Rose Carolina, what's the point of that? Well, you know, when we celebrate courage, we celebrate
[2:47:48.680 --> 2:47:59.920]  what's good in all of us and it's the celebration of truth that we're all engaged in and nothing
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:09.280]  has value like courage, nothing has value like truth, nothing has value like the genuine
[2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:16.600]  and that's why they always tell you, I'm not genuine, I'm so damn genuine, it's ridiculous
[2:48:16.600 --> 2:48:23.920]  and I'm not bragging folks, but I'm genuine and you all have discernment, you know that
[2:48:23.920 --> 2:48:30.480]  and you're genuine and Trump is genuine. Why do you think they're so scared? Because there's
[2:48:30.480 --> 2:48:37.160]  not just the fake in the world, the Hillary's, the Pelosi's, the Maxine waters of the world,
[2:48:37.160 --> 2:48:44.640]  there's the Angela Merkel's, there's the real in the universe. Let's see, the counterfeit
[2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:52.120]  doesn't want you to know the real and so I want all viewers and listeners to know something.
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:58.600]  I grew up with parents and the parents that grew up in the depression and no matter how
[2:48:58.600 --> 2:49:01.920]  much money we had, I had to go out and have jobs when I was 10 years old and I had to
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:07.360]  buy my own shoes and I had to and I got it now, my kids are spoiled compared to the way
[2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:11.360]  I was, but it was almost always this guilt that we were even successful or we were smart
[2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:19.440]  instead of the job we had, the mission that we were smart and successful that we should
[2:49:19.440 --> 2:49:24.240]  go out and help others instead of the evil going around using the fact that they're empowered
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:27.920]  but they're using the fact that they're aware of what's going on against the general public,
[2:49:27.920 --> 2:49:33.200]  it's our job to expose that.
[2:49:33.200 --> 2:49:40.480]  And so that's what I've tried to get into here today is that yes, everyone is freaking
[2:49:40.480 --> 2:49:45.720]  out right now because world governments here, forced inoculations here, the attack on the
[2:49:45.720 --> 2:49:51.440]  families here, the casual society, embeddable microchips are here and people are getting
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:59.600]  scared and I just have to say to folks what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, the only thing
[2:49:59.600 --> 2:50:03.040]  we have to fear is fear itself.
[2:50:03.040 --> 2:50:09.040]  I remember David Ike's coming on my show 25 years ago and just harp that you are living
[2:50:09.040 --> 2:50:12.880]  in fear, not me but the listeners, but I was coming off like I was scared, it was actually
[2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:18.920]  aggression against it and saying get past the fear, get past the fear and I wasn't getting
[2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:23.160]  scared because I didn't have fear but the message of the public that's paralyzed by
[2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:29.720]  fear, that's the worst place to be so Brian Rose you say you didn't get past the fear
[2:50:29.720 --> 2:50:34.840]  but studying what happened with you because you're so rare with a prominent person, millions
[2:50:34.840 --> 2:50:40.200]  of people you reach every day, ten years on YouTube, your own media thing, you're very
[2:50:40.200 --> 2:50:44.640]  successful, you don't brag about it but you're very successful, nobody knows that.
[2:50:44.640 --> 2:50:47.520]  You didn't come as a business model to challenge the new world order, you just thought out of
[2:50:47.520 --> 2:50:50.920]  all your interviews, you interviewed who you want, they tried to punish you and you didn't
[2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:58.040]  back down and in that is the essence of the thought process but you just said the truth.
[2:50:58.040 --> 2:51:01.320]  There wasn't a thought process, it was spiritual, it was default.
[2:51:01.320 --> 2:51:03.920]  So what about folks that don't feel like it's a default?
[2:51:03.920 --> 2:51:09.600]  I think they don't know it's default, I think they've let their fears get on top of that
[2:51:09.600 --> 2:51:14.440]  and the emotion and the propaganda but I think if they really focus in deep down that it
[2:51:14.440 --> 2:51:20.800]  is their default to not be a slave, how do you elaborate on that?
[2:51:20.800 --> 2:51:24.840]  Well first of all I just want to say Alex you know I posted on social media the other
[2:51:24.840 --> 2:51:29.240]  day that you're a legend and you are and I appreciate your authenticity and your courage
[2:51:29.240 --> 2:51:32.240]  through all this stuff, it's been really powerful for me to watch.
[2:51:32.240 --> 2:51:36.960]  You know on the other hand fear that is the only thing that's stopping us at the end of
[2:51:36.960 --> 2:51:41.880]  the day and I think if you can see your own relationship with fear and ask yourself some
[2:51:41.880 --> 2:51:46.960]  simple questions there is a way through even if your knee jerk reaction is not to step
[2:51:46.960 --> 2:51:52.080]  up to fight back to go into the gunfire and ask yourself what are you scared of?
[2:51:52.080 --> 2:51:55.200]  Even to the level of are you really scared of dying?
[2:51:55.200 --> 2:51:57.240]  Are you really scared of being broke?
[2:51:57.240 --> 2:52:00.040]  Are you really scared of all of these things?
[2:52:00.040 --> 2:52:01.960]  What is the worst that can happen?
[2:52:01.960 --> 2:52:06.840]  And start asking yourself would you rather you know live free or die?
[2:52:06.840 --> 2:52:09.320]  What is the story of your life going to be?
[2:52:09.320 --> 2:52:10.880]  What is going to be your greatest moment?
[2:52:10.880 --> 2:52:15.000]  I think people start asking themselves these questions right now and they can understand
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:22.080]  the way that their knee jerk reacting and behaving here because 99% of us act in a way
[2:52:22.080 --> 2:52:27.560]  the things that never actually come true and so we live in these phantoms of fear that
[2:52:27.560 --> 2:52:31.880]  cause us to live these quiet lives of desperation and that's most of the world and when they
[2:52:31.880 --> 2:52:36.640]  see someone stepping up they want to rally around it because they see that in themselves
[2:52:36.640 --> 2:52:41.360]  but everyone has this power Alex they do they just need to really think about this.
[2:52:41.360 --> 2:52:44.640]  I think everyone can become powerful.
[2:52:44.640 --> 2:52:49.880]  Brian I agree with you but it's not an overnight process people have to realize revolutions
[2:52:49.880 --> 2:52:54.000]  aren't one overnight this is a globalist revolution against our revolution account revolution
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:58.760]  I believe they're failing but when you talk about it backfiring get into that because
[2:52:58.760 --> 2:53:02.920]  I really respect your view I see that as well but your perspective on how it's backfiring
[2:53:02.920 --> 2:53:08.400]  because I mean the fact this hysteria hoax the virus is real but overblown the hysteria
[2:53:08.400 --> 2:53:12.160]  hoax is only two months old and as Mark Twain said a lie goes half way around the world
[2:53:12.160 --> 2:53:19.200]  before truth puts its pants on but the reaction is so explosive already I would expect reaction
[2:53:19.200 --> 2:53:23.920]  in six months a year it's coming on stronger than I thought quite frankly it scares me
[2:53:23.920 --> 2:53:31.760]  though because you put these two forces together I mean when I say scared I'm just this is
[2:53:31.760 --> 2:53:38.360]  not a time to be sitting back saying we're bored yeah and look I think this lockdown
[2:53:38.360 --> 2:53:43.120]  will no longer be tolerated I think two months out from now you are going to see some real
[2:53:43.120 --> 2:53:47.840]  civil unrest you're going to see people push back and I think it's time to open this economy
[2:53:47.840 --> 2:53:53.240]  up I think it's time to put your faith in the innovation of the American worker I think
[2:53:53.240 --> 2:53:58.280]  there is so much more we can do here so much more we can innovate on everywhere that's
[2:53:58.280 --> 2:54:03.000]  going to take us to the next level much more than we fear again we're all in fear that
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:07.880]  what's on the other side is even worse than it is now I'm the opposite I think but what
[2:54:07.880 --> 2:54:13.320]  is on the other side is a massive recovery new businesses new ideas new ways of dealing
[2:54:13.320 --> 2:54:19.760]  with something that looks like you know a a two-dimensional foe and it's not it really
[2:54:19.760 --> 2:54:25.360]  isn't you just said it if they convince us we're done and it's over it is but we can
[2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:31.960]  do unlimited things with our potential now if we just know that's the truth yeah and
[2:54:31.960 --> 2:54:35.760]  people have to step into that everyone is powerful enough to do it it doesn't happen
[2:54:35.760 --> 2:54:39.360]  overnight you're right Alex it comes through an entire daily practice it comes through
[2:54:39.360 --> 2:54:44.320]  building that sense of self through listening and learning but then taking action that's
[2:54:44.320 --> 2:54:47.880]  always the missing component and we see it out there Alex we see a lot of people that
[2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:52.080]  hear these messages of ours and they don't actually take the action they don't quote
[2:54:52.080 --> 2:54:57.080]  quote pull the trigger as we say and step into that unknown but if they do they'll realize
[2:54:57.080 --> 2:55:01.720]  that 99% of what they thought was going to happen doesn't and there's real when you take
[2:55:01.720 --> 2:55:06.760]  action it's always better I mean not maybe not first level but third fourth fifth level
[2:55:06.760 --> 2:55:13.440]  it just gets better Brian rose than London real dot TV final statement then about action
[2:55:13.440 --> 2:55:18.440]  about living in your own destiny not somebody else's program destiny what is your parting
[2:55:18.440 --> 2:55:24.880]  words for this audience you know I think this is an incredible time of reflection I think
[2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:28.840]  this is potentially the greatest learning experience of our entire life and honestly
[2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:34.160]  this is a dry run Alex let's be honest this could have been much much much worse we could
[2:55:34.160 --> 2:55:40.160]  have been seeing 30% fatalities test you're dead right oh you know we live through the
[2:55:40.160 --> 2:55:45.400]  plague in this city you know we saw just complete devastation that's not what happening here
[2:55:45.400 --> 2:55:50.360]  this is a test this is a way to prepare yourself for the real one that's coming this is a time
[2:55:50.360 --> 2:55:54.600]  to prepare your business to prepare your personal life stop waiting for the handout from the
[2:55:54.600 --> 2:55:58.680]  government stop waiting for the handout from your employer or from anyone else you need
[2:55:58.680 --> 2:56:03.680]  to bulletproof your own house and that comes from your physical presence that comes from
[2:56:03.680 --> 2:56:08.640]  your financial future and your spiritual mindset to where no one can run the show in the future
[2:56:08.640 --> 2:56:13.280]  because that's what's coming that is what's coming the Hunger Games Society the mind this
[2:56:13.280 --> 2:56:17.880]  is a fire drill from what's really coming instead of this being the globalist takeover
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:23.200]  this is our opportunity to get self-sufficient this is nothing this is literally like you
[2:56:23.200 --> 2:56:26.640]  know the in the old days where they would put the dead virus in you and you would build
[2:56:26.640 --> 2:56:31.360]  up to it when the big one would come so we are in preparation I am getting ready here
[2:56:31.360 --> 2:56:36.000]  I am literally building myself for the big fight while everyone else is saying wow that
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:40.640]  was tough I mean this is nothing that's happening right now and the people that build now are
[2:56:40.640 --> 2:56:44.800]  going to be the ones that dominate in the future and liberate the rest of us so that's
[2:56:44.800 --> 2:56:49.600]  why I'm excited Alex I can see your supercharge right now because I know that I'll be having
[2:56:49.600 --> 2:56:54.680]  to lead in the future and I'm ready now you're right it was in 2008 they had the dot com bus
[2:56:54.680 --> 2:56:59.280]  I had a million dollar house a hundred thousand dollars in the bank I sold my house we moved
[2:56:59.280 --> 2:57:03.760]  into a apartment and I said I'm putting it all in the info where no one else was and
[2:57:03.760 --> 2:57:08.040]  I just knew it would do all this and it happened and now is the time like you said don't pull
[2:57:08.040 --> 2:57:12.320]  the horns in put the horns out I'm impressed Brian I've always loved your work and watching
[2:57:12.320 --> 2:57:15.600]  at least three four years and I love you and I appreciate it can't wait to make you in person
[2:57:15.600 --> 2:57:20.960]  and your courage is in is a total inspiration to all of us thank you Alex I appreciate you
[2:57:20.960 --> 2:57:26.400]  it is a time to expand not contract and again I appreciate your courage and authenticity
[2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:30.840]  it's it's helped me through a few difficult days over here we love you brother that man
[2:57:30.840 --> 2:57:35.560]  has strength he's very successful he had back down that's the spirit that's the fighting
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:41.880]  spirit hour number four with Jason Jones and more I'm Alex Jones stay with us
[2:57:41.880 --> 2:57:52.280]  and all of a sudden the trap snaps inside hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:57.640]  going back to the Magna Carta in 1215 of hard fought basic human dignity and liberty and
[2:57:57.640 --> 2:58:04.680]  believing that the individual was sovereign and had basic unenable rights has been absolutely
[2:58:04.680 --> 2:58:12.400]  erased just in March and the Communist Chinese had been our teachers and big tech has been
[2:58:12.400 --> 2:58:18.480]  our controllers we're all being introduced now the digital straight jacket that depends
[2:58:18.480 --> 2:58:24.760]  on us complying with it and depends on us all in pecking each other into submission
[2:58:24.760 --> 2:58:29.520]  but for all of you out there that have decided to go along with this mark your calendars
[2:58:29.520 --> 2:58:35.640]  down and then a few months a few years look at the world remember you did this you were
[2:58:35.640 --> 2:58:39.320]  the prisoners you were the slaves you were the people that crouched down and lick the
[2:58:39.320 --> 2:58:47.400]  hand that fed you that's for me give me liberty or give me death globalism is all about making
[2:58:47.400 --> 2:58:54.080]  the nation state and the population itself obsolete non-essential that's why they position
[2:58:54.080 --> 2:59:00.920]  it with economic tariffs taxes and controls to our family farms and industry that's based
[2:59:00.920 --> 2:59:05.960]  the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate that's part
[2:59:05.960 --> 2:59:12.960]  of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out they can simply look at
[2:59:12.960 --> 2:59:18.400]  us and say because again you are non-essential that's what the robots and all of this is
[2:59:18.400 --> 2:59:23.920]  about it's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives we can be
[2:59:23.920 --> 2:59:29.080]  told to stay on our houses and after all shut up this world doesn't belong to people anyways
[2:59:29.080 --> 2:59:34.280]  it belongs to the new AI gods the rich elitists that have merged with machines yeah that sounds
[2:59:34.280 --> 2:59:40.560]  completely insane doesn't it that's actually the public plan they're pushing these people
[2:59:40.560 --> 2:59:48.440]  are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy
[2:59:48.440 --> 3:00:04.440]  we're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:04.440 --> 3:00:11.200]  everything i do is aligned with the truth doesn't mean i have all the answers doesn't
[3:00:11.200 --> 3:00:17.200]  mean i'm a perfect person but anything i promote is something i already intrinsically believe
[3:00:17.200 --> 3:00:22.920]  in and you could say well that's empathy that i feel bad 30 million people extra starving
[3:00:22.920 --> 3:00:27.800]  to death because of the shutdown of covid-19 not because of covid-19 because of the un
[3:00:27.800 --> 3:00:35.040]  shutdown and yes way god built me as i feel for them i i i'm upset i imagine those starving
[3:00:35.040 --> 3:00:39.800]  children i get angry about that i think about the left saying there's too many people and
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:46.040]  i say well then you die first let's see that's god's perfection that we don't even know why
[3:00:46.040 --> 3:00:50.720]  we think that we just feel that way because that's the way we're designed the people cut
[3:00:50.720 --> 3:00:55.240]  off from god they don't have those feelings we should feel very sorry for them but there's
[3:00:55.240 --> 3:00:59.800]  also this weird guilt i have and i'll be honest my whole life is ruled by guilt even though
[3:00:59.800 --> 3:01:04.800]  i'm a pretty good person i always look into every aspect of everything i do like i'm selling
[3:01:04.800 --> 3:01:08.160]  vitamins and minerals that are great in high quality but i'm still like are they the lowest
[3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:12.600]  price are they the very best the media said i'm bad selling these and i actually like
[3:01:12.600 --> 3:01:17.680]  i go wait a minute you know you're doing good you know you care that's the same thing with
[3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:22.760]  horrible food if they get a successful depression going which looks like may happen you need
[3:01:22.760 --> 3:01:27.800]  horrible food folks i got the best company out there we've got it they've got the food
[3:01:27.800 --> 3:01:31.440]  the other big companies don't they're ready to take your orders and it funds this operation
[3:01:31.440 --> 3:01:37.760]  it was a straight donation to info wars it would be a good event so why do we hesitate
[3:01:37.760 --> 3:01:43.280]  why do we wait we really should you should get the swarble foods at m4store.com they could
[3:01:43.280 --> 3:01:46.960]  take your orders now they may have to stop taking orders within a week because the orders
[3:01:46.960 --> 3:01:52.800]  are so crazy they already paused for two weeks but i get guilty getting up here on air and
[3:01:52.800 --> 3:01:58.280]  saying buy my products buy this i won't be on air because literally i won't be we sold
[3:01:58.280 --> 3:02:04.400]  out of all of our inventory last year at the end of the year we had almost no inventory
[3:02:04.400 --> 3:02:09.040]  and i spent almost all the money to be able to stay on air and not have money to buy
[3:02:09.040 --> 3:02:15.480]  a new product and then covid-19 happened and we sold enough products to buy products for
[3:02:15.480 --> 3:02:19.960]  the next six months so you talk about the widows my that was the experience we were
[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:25.040]  having that's how close i mortgaged my house which is fine i'm happy my god i love the
[3:02:25.040 --> 3:02:28.240]  smaller house in a normal neighborhood where i moved to the richie rich neighborhood so
[3:02:28.240 --> 3:02:34.360]  i can have a fence around my house from all the stalkers but what i'm getting at is that
[3:02:34.360 --> 3:02:40.480]  i'm totally committed here but it takes money to fight this fight and so we have great products
[3:02:40.480 --> 3:02:46.440]  like bodies ultimate turmeric formula it's so good for you we have x3 we have the great
[3:02:46.440 --> 3:02:54.280]  and sanitizer and three different organic varieties peppermint and of course all these
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:03:01.560]  other great varieties that you should definitely check out like eucalyptus and lavender but
[3:03:01.560 --> 3:03:09.400]  that's how we fund ourselves and it's so biblical how though every time it's like god always
[3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:15.720]  keeps my tank at empty because i could sell my two million dollar house that would fund
[3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:19.160]  stuff like a month here with a hundred plus employees and all the bandwidth i mean you
[3:03:19.160 --> 3:03:22.760]  heard the guest on earlier just putting out from London real his own videos with millions
[3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:26.360]  of views like he's like my god that's like a hundred thousand dollars per three million
[3:03:26.360 --> 3:03:30.320]  views and we're trying to believe me that's what i'm saying is people like oh build your

[3:03:34.600 --> 3:03:39.080]  week yeah ready for the bill it's it we're building our own infrastructure and we're

[3:06:02.160 --> 3:06:07.600]  Welcome to the alex jones show i'm your guest host jason jones and thank you to alex and
[3:06:07.600 --> 3:06:14.200]  his team for giving us this hour i know how precious this time is and so i worked hard
[3:06:14.200 --> 3:06:18.960]  to get the best guests for you with the information that you would need and we have a great show
[3:06:18.960 --> 3:06:26.000]  today we have kevin sorbo i think arguably the biggest tv star of the nineties he was
[3:06:26.000 --> 3:06:31.160]  hercules he's had an incredible career and we fell in love with him not just because
[3:06:31.160 --> 3:06:37.120]  of his acting but because of his courageousness and standing for christ and why does it have
[3:06:37.120 --> 3:06:42.320]  to take courage in hollywood kevin sorbo to say you love america but it does take courage
[3:06:42.320 --> 3:06:51.480]  welcome to the alex jones show that's a good question i don't know why i mean in an industry
[3:06:51.480 --> 3:06:56.040]  that screams for tolerance and screams for freedom of speech it's pretty much a one way
[3:06:56.040 --> 3:07:04.080]  street but it's been an interesting ride you know hollywood owes me nothing i had a two
[3:07:04.080 --> 3:07:07.880]  great series around for 12 years and since i've been very busy doing independent movies
[3:07:07.880 --> 3:07:13.360]  i shot over 60 movies in the last 15 years not all of them are winners but i've done
[3:07:13.360 --> 3:07:17.760]  a lot of good ones out there you know like god's not dead and soul surfer and ablesfield
[3:07:17.760 --> 3:07:22.920]  let there be light and my newest documentary before the rats so i'm staying busy thank
[3:07:22.920 --> 3:07:27.720]  god i got three new movies to come out it's just one of the old movie theaters again you
[3:07:27.720 --> 3:07:33.320]  know that we got to wait until we get that okay before the people get to see those movies
[3:07:33.320 --> 3:07:37.120]  well you're in all of my family's favorite movies we actually have a saying it's my favorite
[3:07:37.120 --> 3:07:41.600]  movie that doesn't start kevin sorbo when we talk about other films and you have a new
[3:07:41.600 --> 3:07:47.000]  movie before the wrath and a lot of people in the entertainment business were lamenting
[3:07:47.000 --> 3:07:54.120]  the lockdown the closing of the theaters but this seems to be one film that's timely because
[3:07:54.120 --> 3:07:58.480]  in this lockdown where you know this lockdown is going to give us fortitude it's going to
[3:07:58.480 --> 3:08:03.120]  give us empathy and it's going to direct us towards god and your documentary was at number
[3:08:03.120 --> 3:08:07.520]  one in amazon i think it's still at number four and i want everyone watching you have
[3:08:07.520 --> 3:08:12.400]  to see this this powerful intriguing new documentary that's yours kevin tell us about before the
[3:08:12.400 --> 3:08:22.520]  wrath it's a wonderful education documentary dealing with perfectly what's going on really
[3:08:22.520 --> 3:08:30.120]  in our world today it's uh it deals with discoveries through the through the gospel of uh of matthew
[3:08:30.120 --> 3:08:37.000]  uh which which a lot of the scholars are looking at now to show of you know talk about the second
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:41.000]  coming of christ obviously you don't know when and where that's going to happen but it's
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:45.440]  an interesting look at it in an educational way it's also a love story i mean it's it's
[3:08:45.440 --> 3:08:51.520]  actually sort of like a uh because it deals with a wedding to sort of relate to how jesus
[3:08:51.520 --> 3:08:56.680]  will come back and it's kind of like a prophecy chick flick if you'd like if you'd like and
[3:08:56.680 --> 3:09:00.640]  um it's you know it's interesting going on like i said with the covid 19 right now it's
[3:09:00.640 --> 3:09:07.760]  a perfect response to why why um we have faith in the in the lord's return because there's
[3:09:07.760 --> 3:09:16.200]  just there's people looking for answers right now i'm looking at my i left california about
[3:09:16.200 --> 3:09:20.200]  a year ago i live in florida now but we still ask that we love the pastor rob back and back
[3:09:20.200 --> 3:09:25.400]  in uh thousand oaks and he said now that i'll always you know he's doing what most pastors
[3:09:25.400 --> 3:09:29.280]  are doing they're doing it by by the internet and he said they're getting five times more
[3:09:29.280 --> 3:09:35.320]  people five times more people watching him listening to his sermons than we've normally
[3:09:35.320 --> 3:09:39.480]  come into the church there so it's incredible it's people are looking for answers right
[3:09:39.480 --> 3:09:44.120]  now they're searching they want to understand why this is going on why we're you know having
[3:09:44.120 --> 3:09:48.000]  to go through what we have to go through and uh do we have to deal with all this fear because
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:52.720]  right now the media loves to fear right they love to keep us uh tied up in bondage and
[3:09:52.720 --> 3:09:56.480]  i think i'm not the poop who what's going on out there right now but we're not getting
[3:09:56.480 --> 3:10:01.120]  all the facts folks and i think most people are realizing that now well yes we're being
[3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:05.920]  driven to fear here in honolulu the news said we have a seven percent mortality rate even
[3:10:05.920 --> 3:10:09.400]  by their own statistics it's point seven but if you really do the math it's probably point
[3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:16.600]  zero zero seven and um but they had you know a big card on the screen point seven i mean
[3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:22.560]  a seven percent mortality rate new york has the siren and alex's last segment was all
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:28.320]  about courage my favorite quote is marcus aurelius learning how to die is learning how to be a
[3:10:28.320 --> 3:10:34.280]  free man and scripture always calls us to silence to quiet when we're quiet when we're
[3:10:34.280 --> 3:10:40.520]  silent we inevitably start thinking about god and i think we're all tired everybody
[3:10:40.520 --> 3:10:45.400]  i don't know about you my family we binge watched frivolous entertaining things for
[3:10:45.400 --> 3:10:50.400]  the first two weeks of the shutdown and now we're over it i don't want to watch anything
[3:10:50.400 --> 3:10:55.520]  without meaning and this is something i think everybody is is going to want to watch yeah
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:11:04.200]  you know i'm kevin i hope they do and i'm also telling people go ahead go ahead oh you
[3:11:04.200 --> 3:11:08.800]  brought up that this is a love story and i've i've privileged to be friends with you and
[3:11:08.800 --> 3:11:13.600]  your wife sam and it's a beautiful love story right now we're hearing that domestic abuse
[3:11:13.600 --> 3:11:21.040]  shelters are full across the country domestic abuse is at a higher rate than ever families
[3:11:21.040 --> 3:11:26.400]  are they're they're not paying their mortgages their refrigerators running out of food meanwhile
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:31.120]  nancy polosi has all the ice cream in the world is in her big twenty thousand dollar freezer

[3:12:12.720 --> 3:12:16.960]  i know it's only three o'clock here and it's nine o'clock where you are but um go to homegrown
[3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:24.320]  generation that's one word homegrowngeneration.com slash date homegrowngeneration.com slash date

[3:12:40.720 --> 3:12:44.640]  we don't have who has the perfect marriage known as the perfect marriage but it really comes down
[3:12:44.640 --> 3:12:48.640]  to faith and fighting through the negative times in life to get to the positive times in life because
[3:12:48.640 --> 3:12:53.360]  the good alls outweighs the bad and to think that life is going to be uh there's a greener side it's
[3:12:53.360 --> 3:12:58.640]  not true it's not true you got married for a reason and you got to find what that reason is again if
[3:12:58.640 --> 3:13:01.840]  you're having problems in your marriage but really this is just going to be it's going to be a fun
[3:13:01.840 --> 3:13:06.400]  evening it's going to have a lot of laughs we've got some good stories to tell true stories about
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:10.960]  my own relationship with sam and uh i hope people enjoy this and find out that we're pretty much
[3:13:10.960 --> 3:13:15.200]  just like anybody else out there and the problems we go through but we know what you just mentioned
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:21.360]  is is a rough time for people and uh our government's got to do something i i'm so it blows my mind
[3:13:21.360 --> 3:13:27.200]  that even something like this they use to politicize their own agenda it's unbelievable
[3:13:28.160 --> 3:13:33.920]  so they don't what's interesting about people who love people they look to serve they look to
[3:13:33.920 --> 3:13:40.720]  to solve the problem so you hear that that families are being torn apart marriages are
[3:13:40.720 --> 3:13:46.960]  struggling and you and your wife create a date night and you don't try to politicize it you try
[3:13:46.960 --> 3:13:51.840]  to serve those vulnerable families but it's hard to believe that there are people who hear this and
[3:13:51.840 --> 3:14:00.080]  go oh another opportunity to shove our agenda down america's throat yeah this is not there's no
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:04.800]  agenda here this is just to have just to have a good time be a positive time in a negative in a
[3:14:04.800 --> 3:14:09.280]  negative world right now guys and we know that people are hurt and we know that people need help
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:12.880]  and uh you know we got to get back to work we got to get a country move again
[3:14:14.720 --> 3:14:18.080]  you know we had a minute 30 left uh kevin they're not going to go away
[3:14:21.600 --> 3:14:24.640]  i'm sorry kevin there's a little bit of a delay there was a little bit of delay we had about a
[3:14:24.640 --> 3:14:29.360]  minute 30 left and i just want to let you know that in my family we home school and so we're
[3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:34.480]  studying greek mythology now part of what our children are watching now is hercules i think a

[3:20:21.280 --> 3:20:27.360]  my next guest taylor marshall is an author he's an academic he's an intellectual he is
[3:20:27.360 --> 3:20:36.000]  uh the most disruptive catholic commentator blogger youtuber in the world and i brought
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:41.440]  taylor on to talk about the vatican bank scandal the infiltration of the deep state into the
[3:20:41.440 --> 3:20:47.200]  catholic church and a lot of this is going to be coming to light now that cardinal hell has been
[3:20:47.200 --> 3:20:52.320]  released from prison in australia who is leading the investigations into the vatican bank scandal
[3:20:52.320 --> 3:20:59.360]  taylor marshall welcome to the alex jones show jason great to be back with you so brother the
[3:20:59.360 --> 3:21:07.040]  reason i wanted you on you wrote this incredible book infiltration on the deep states even really
[3:21:07.040 --> 3:21:13.040]  darker maybe than the deep states infiltration of the catholic church and we've known about this
[3:21:13.040 --> 3:21:18.000]  from scripture saints like ticonius wrote in the third century that there would be an anti church
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:25.120]  within the church at the end times this is a big topic can we enter the door of the infiltration
[3:21:25.120 --> 3:21:29.600]  of the deep state into the church through the vatican bank the bank scandal is maybe our door
[3:21:31.040 --> 3:21:36.160]  yeah i mean the big news really the past week is cardinal pell who's the australian cardinal
[3:21:36.720 --> 3:21:41.840]  was released from prison after allegations uh and he's back and he he did an interview and
[3:21:41.840 --> 3:21:47.040]  he talked about how he'd been appointed he was one of the nine cardinals appointed by pope frances to
[3:21:47.040 --> 3:21:54.640]  to reform the vatican curia and he was over finances he was over vatican bank and he talks
[3:21:54.640 --> 3:22:02.080]  about billion billion not million billion in discrepancies scandals and uh this was big news
[3:22:02.080 --> 3:22:07.360]  because when he was first appointed this is this is kind of the risky job when you're auditing
[3:22:07.360 --> 3:22:10.560]  vatican bank accounts is he going to get killed is he going to get framed is he going to be put
[3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:15.440]  in prison we jumped about it taylor when he got the job people were jumping cardinal pell is
[3:22:15.440 --> 3:22:20.160]  is going to didn't kill himself cardinal pell is going to get framed up then he gets framed up
[3:22:20.160 --> 3:22:24.480]  and then the australian government forbids journalists to cover the trial really unprecedented
[3:22:24.480 --> 3:22:29.840]  in the english-speaking world yeah it was it was a crazy situation and you know now that he's out
[3:22:29.840 --> 3:22:35.280]  and he's saying yes there is corruption and we don't know how high or deep it long or long it
[3:22:35.280 --> 3:22:41.360]  goes is the language and he says he says that the corruption doesn't go quite up to the pope himself
[3:22:41.360 --> 3:22:50.320]  but almost to the pope so this is sort of reopening the scandal because in 2012 there's a major
[3:22:50.320 --> 3:22:57.040]  scandal in which the pope's butler was releasing documents and it was published in in print it
[3:22:57.040 --> 3:23:04.480]  was published in a book that butler was tried by the vatican he was found guilty and then he
[3:23:04.480 --> 3:23:11.280]  was pardoned by the pope and it was just weeks after all that happened that the pope himself
[3:23:12.000 --> 3:23:18.400]  in really a a historical moment announced that he was going to resign from the papacy and that
[3:23:18.400 --> 3:23:24.480]  night the vatican was struck by lightning and then i say the vatican atm machined and all that
[3:23:24.480 --> 3:23:29.920]  started working again so there's there's something going on there's something very rotten in the
[3:23:29.920 --> 3:23:36.480]  vatican finances going back as far as 2012 taylor that vatican being struck by lightning if you're
[3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:41.040]  not catholic you may not know that this happened when the resignation was announced it was live
[3:23:41.040 --> 3:23:49.520]  they had live cameras there and two huge lightning strikes strike the vatican unlike anything you've
[3:23:49.520 --> 3:23:54.880]  ever seen and the only thing that has been as unusual is when when obama i was in illinois
[3:23:54.880 --> 3:24:01.200]  when obama was elected and the winning six the winning three was six six six and the winning
[3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:06.560]  four was seven seven seven nine and when things like this happen you're just like that's really
[3:24:06.560 --> 3:24:14.160]  unusual yeah it's a sign it's a sign so you know people are now you know that that story kind of
[3:24:14.160 --> 3:24:20.640]  died down since 2012 2013 but now with pel release we're realizing that there has been
[3:24:20.640 --> 3:24:26.400]  an like you said a deep state infiltration into the catholic church that's the thesis of my book
[3:24:26.400 --> 3:24:33.440]  infiltration my argument is that this financial and moral and doctrinal corruption and infiltration
[3:24:33.440 --> 3:24:39.520]  doesn't just go back to the 80s or even the 60s or 50s it actually goes back to the mid 1800s and
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:44.960]  that's the that's the argument i make an infiltration all the way up to the major vatican bank
[3:24:44.960 --> 3:24:52.000]  scandal that happened in the 60s and culminated around 78 79 that's the um the movie godfather
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:56.640]  three if you've ever seen it that's the the premise of that film and then it then it opens up again
[3:24:56.640 --> 3:25:04.160]  like we see in in the early 2000 teens and then now it's back so this will be a big story running
[3:25:04.160 --> 3:25:10.640]  through 2020 of you know 2018 2019 with sexual scandals in the vatican and in the catholic church
[3:25:10.640 --> 3:25:15.200]  worldwide we're going to see more of that but we're going to now start seeing the dominoes
[3:25:15.200 --> 3:25:21.360]  falling in a cascade of financial scandals in the catholic church going all the way up into the walls
[3:25:21.360 --> 3:25:26.320]  of vatican city tell your lady brought up the sexual scandals because our next gas made a
[3:25:26.320 --> 3:25:32.480]  documentary called out of shadows and it's about the sexual scandals in hollywood and the occult
[3:25:32.480 --> 3:25:37.680]  in hollywood and your book is about the occult in the catholic church sexual scandals in the
[3:25:37.680 --> 3:25:42.880]  catholic church wherever this deep state goes i don't know what you would call it whether it's in
[3:25:42.880 --> 3:25:49.280]  hollywood whether it's in the catholic church it brings with it child sex abuse it brings with it
[3:25:49.280 --> 3:25:55.920]  violence uh financial crimes the occult but people will point to the entertainment industry and
[3:25:55.920 --> 3:26:01.280]  everyone in it or they will point to the catholic church and they will condemn the church or they will
[3:26:01.280 --> 3:26:07.680]  condemn the entertainment industry by the deep state what would you call it the occult really
[3:26:07.680 --> 3:26:13.360]  right it's the occult working through instruments of influence yeah and in the in the catholic
[3:26:13.360 --> 3:26:18.400]  church i mean we see this as satanism we see it as the occult we see it as freemasonry all these
[3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:26.160]  groups are focused on we are not saved and redeemed and elevated by jesus christ dying on the cross
[3:26:26.160 --> 3:26:32.160]  and rising again on the third day they believe that we can reach into our own human nature by
[3:26:32.160 --> 3:26:39.600]  divination magic spells and lift ourselves up to become our own gods that's that's the lie from
[3:26:40.160 --> 3:26:45.120]  from genesis genesis three that's what the serpent this devil tells adam and eve you can be your
[3:26:45.120 --> 3:26:53.520]  own gods by your own your own agency so anything that's i mean ultimately that is satanism that
[3:26:53.520 --> 3:26:58.320]  is freemasonry that is the occult we're going to lift ourselves up we are going to do the alchemy
[3:26:58.320 --> 3:27:04.960]  of turning our lead in human nature into divine gold but it's a lie and it's a lie and it always
[3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:10.480]  brings with it the child trafficking the sexual immorality uh and the financial corruption that
[3:27:10.480 --> 3:27:17.920]  we see in the political sphere and in the christian sphere so what would you say to people
[3:27:17.920 --> 3:27:25.680]  point to the scandals and judge the church by it well i mean there's always been infiltration
[3:27:25.680 --> 3:27:31.600]  from the very beginning i mean as christians we believe that uh of the angels a third of them
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:39.120]  fell satan was one of the good guys and he betrayed his king his god we see judice ascare it and then
[3:27:39.120 --> 3:27:45.040]  even our lord jesus christ is repeatedly saying in the kingdom of god there'll be wheat and there'll
[3:27:45.040 --> 3:27:50.880]  be tears there'll be wheat and weeds uh he says there'll be false prophets he says there'll be
[3:27:50.880 --> 3:27:57.760]  false pastors false leaders false christ i mean if you look around and your church doesn't have wheat
[3:27:57.760 --> 3:28:03.120]  and tears and falseness in it you're not in the church that christ was talking about the kingdom
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:09.200]  of god he was talking about because he tells us there will be infiltration and betrayals even
[3:28:09.200 --> 3:28:15.280]  betrayals with a kiss within the kingdom of god within the church so this is to be expected
[3:28:15.280 --> 3:28:20.800]  satan is never going to let off he's going to continue to attack from within it's always better
[3:28:20.800 --> 3:28:25.920]  to attack within than without it's more sinister that way and so we always tell her we're down
[3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:31.520]  tell her we're down to our last 30 seconds i want people to get your book infiltration

[3:29:12.880 --> 3:29:17.360]  is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the mississippi
[3:29:17.360 --> 3:29:22.080]  because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather
[3:29:22.080 --> 3:29:26.160]  than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem

[3:30:52.460 --> 3:30:55.860]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press,
[3:30:55.860 --> 3:30:58.760]  you name it, admit that a half a billion people
[3:30:58.760 --> 3:31:04.960]  extra 500 million are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions
[3:31:04.960 --> 3:31:07.760]  already starving because of the global lockdown.
[3:31:07.760 --> 3:31:12.880]  That is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19 and
[3:31:12.880 --> 3:31:17.320]  the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the CHICOMS at the World Health Organization
[3:31:17.320 --> 3:31:22.400]  with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society,
[3:31:22.400 --> 3:31:24.680]  create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[3:31:24.680 --> 3:31:25.680]  This is insane.
[3:31:25.680 --> 3:31:28.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[3:31:28.440 --> 3:31:29.880]  You need to get prepared now.
[3:31:29.880 --> 3:31:34.440]  You need to get high-quality, swarble food now back in stock at infowarstore.com and
[3:31:34.440 --> 3:31:38.520]  you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[3:31:38.520 --> 3:31:42.320]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't
[3:31:42.320 --> 3:31:44.880]  even challenge verbally social distancing.
[3:31:44.880 --> 3:31:46.720]  This is beyond 1984.
[3:31:46.720 --> 3:31:48.400]  The tyranny of the dual orders here.
[3:31:48.400 --> 3:31:50.800]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the Info War.
[3:31:50.800 --> 3:31:52.760]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[3:31:52.760 --> 3:31:55.320]  I'm always excited about Info War's live products.
[3:31:55.320 --> 3:31:56.320]  They're amazing.
[3:31:56.320 --> 3:31:57.320]  They're cutting edge.
[3:31:57.320 --> 3:32:01.360]  And they fund the Info War in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[3:32:01.360 --> 3:32:07.960]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[3:32:07.960 --> 3:32:15.720]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[3:32:15.720 --> 3:32:18.040]  And there's another innovation.
[3:32:18.040 --> 3:32:20.040]  It's the spray cap.
[3:32:20.040 --> 3:32:24.400]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo.
[3:32:24.400 --> 3:32:27.560]  But it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[3:32:27.560 --> 3:32:30.840]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[3:32:30.840 --> 3:32:33.640]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes.
[3:32:33.640 --> 3:32:38.040]  But I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[3:32:38.040 --> 3:32:39.440]  So this is a real innovation.
[3:32:39.440 --> 3:32:43.840]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[3:32:43.840 --> 3:32:47.720]  essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[3:32:47.720 --> 3:32:49.600]  It's so refreshing.
[3:32:49.600 --> 3:32:55.840]  This is a big winner.
[3:32:55.840 --> 3:33:09.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:09.800 --> 3:33:12.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:12.360 --> 3:33:15.640]  And I can't believe that I was able to get this guest, Brad Martin.
[3:33:15.640 --> 3:33:21.480]  And I actually, after the Out of Shadows documentary came out, I had been doing podcasts
[3:33:21.480 --> 3:33:25.880]  on Q and questioning Q. Everyone was sending this to me.
[3:33:25.880 --> 3:33:28.440]  I messaged him through Facebook.
[3:33:28.440 --> 3:33:30.760]  I looked him up on IMDb.
[3:33:30.760 --> 3:33:36.480]  Brad Martin is clearly one of the most successful stuntmen and stunt coordinators in the Hollywood
[3:33:36.480 --> 3:33:37.480]  history.
[3:33:37.480 --> 3:33:41.720]  Knew he'd be a busy guy, an important guy, didn't think he'd message me, and he got right
[3:33:41.720 --> 3:33:43.520]  back to me.
[3:33:43.520 --> 3:33:49.400]  And I didn't know what connected Kevin Sorbo, Taylor Marshall, and Brad until listening
[3:33:49.400 --> 3:33:54.920]  to the last segment of the last hour, listening to Alex talk about courage.
[3:33:54.920 --> 3:33:59.680]  And what Kevin Sorbo have in common with Taylor and Brad is courage.
[3:33:59.680 --> 3:34:01.880]  And Brad has had a career.
[3:34:01.880 --> 3:34:06.240]  Every day he had to develop courage by doing some of the most daring stunts in Hollywood
[3:34:06.240 --> 3:34:07.920]  history.
[3:34:07.920 --> 3:34:13.360]  And with Out of Shadows, that might have been the most courageous, daring move of his life.
[3:34:13.360 --> 3:34:16.080]  Brad, welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:16.080 --> 3:34:20.040]  Thanks for having me, Jason.
[3:34:20.040 --> 3:34:21.960]  So brother, here you are.
[3:34:21.960 --> 3:34:24.480]  You have a career that's set.
[3:34:24.480 --> 3:34:25.480]  It's emotion.
[3:34:25.480 --> 3:34:27.720]  It's being bigger and bigger.
[3:34:27.720 --> 3:34:30.680]  You're growing in the industry.
[3:34:30.680 --> 3:34:33.880]  And then you are exposed to these uncomfortable truths.
[3:34:33.880 --> 3:34:35.520]  You could have looked the other way.
[3:34:35.520 --> 3:34:37.920]  You could have ignored it.
[3:34:37.920 --> 3:34:43.840]  But yet you did this very unusual thing, this daring and brave thing, and joined the Out
[3:34:43.840 --> 3:34:46.200]  of Shadows documentary team.
[3:34:46.200 --> 3:34:50.000]  Can you explain to me that your thought process in that, and was it, were you?
[3:34:50.000 --> 3:34:51.000]  Yeah.
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:34:56.000]  Well, a big step happened prior to doing the doc.
[3:34:56.000 --> 3:35:01.600]  I woke up in 2015 and I realized what I was lending my efforts to.
[3:35:01.600 --> 3:35:05.040]  And I was disgusted with the message I was putting out there.
[3:35:05.040 --> 3:35:08.960]  I realized that everything I was putting out there was a lot of it, especially for me,
[3:35:08.960 --> 3:35:15.080]  the action and violent action for that matter, was desensitizing people.
[3:35:15.080 --> 3:35:21.920]  And what I realized what I was doing then, I quit the business.
[3:35:21.920 --> 3:35:23.680]  I left for three years.
[3:35:23.680 --> 3:35:25.680]  I was disgusted with myself.
[3:35:25.680 --> 3:35:29.720]  I wanted to send a good message to my kids.
[3:35:29.720 --> 3:35:33.240]  And I realized that I'm not leaving, I'm not doing that at all.
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:41.160]  So I left, and then my buddy Mike Smith called me, a couple of years after that, and he found
[3:35:41.160 --> 3:35:44.520]  out that I was awake, and he had woken up at the same time.
[3:35:44.520 --> 3:35:48.200]  As you can see from the documentary, it happened while he was having, while he had an accident
[3:35:48.200 --> 3:35:51.760]  and he broke his back.
[3:35:51.760 --> 3:35:53.320]  And I was all in.
[3:35:53.320 --> 3:35:58.720]  I just, I grew up, well, I grew up in the industry loving the business.
[3:35:58.720 --> 3:36:03.880]  Obviously, I was a very well-known stuntman, I climbed the ranks up to the point where
[3:36:03.880 --> 3:36:07.040]  I was action directing some big movies.
[3:36:07.040 --> 3:36:12.160]  And I walked, when I walked away, I turned down three of my biggest jobs of my life.
[3:36:12.160 --> 3:36:18.960]  So it was, I love the craft, I love what I do, but I want to send out a better message.
[3:36:18.960 --> 3:36:25.200]  And I wasn't getting the offers and the options to make movies that did so.
[3:36:25.200 --> 3:36:32.480]  So yeah, I told Mike I would do the doc, and my reason for that was to, well, a couple
[3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:37.880]  of folds is obviously to enlighten the people in the world as to what Hollywood is all about.
[3:36:37.880 --> 3:36:42.120]  But also to hopefully I can shake things up a little bit, and maybe I can put my name
[3:36:42.120 --> 3:36:46.960]  out there for the good people in Hollywood that want to make good movies that would like
[3:36:46.960 --> 3:36:50.200]  to use me, because that's where I want to put my efforts.
[3:36:50.200 --> 3:36:56.560]  Well, you and I were talking about this offline, that below the line, the working people, the
[3:36:56.560 --> 3:37:02.400]  working class people that make these movies really, from the teamsters driving the trucks,
[3:37:02.400 --> 3:37:08.240]  to the art department, to the construction coordinator, to the stuntmen, to the writers.
[3:37:08.240 --> 3:37:12.440]  So many of these people share our values, and they caffets, we complain.
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:16.120]  And that's how I became a producer, and all my producing partners became producers.
[3:37:16.120 --> 3:37:21.000]  Some of them were working for the studios, they walked away, because they couldn't stay
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:26.000]  in the Hollywood system and make the types of movies they would be proud of.
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:29.840]  Now here you have Out of Shadows, that I don't even need to set it up.
[3:37:29.840 --> 3:37:31.920]  I think everyone watching now has seen it.
[3:37:31.920 --> 3:37:38.160]  How many million of millions of people have seen Out of Shadows just on your site?
[3:37:38.160 --> 3:37:41.240]  Just on our site, I think it's over 10 million by now.
[3:37:41.240 --> 3:37:47.560]  And I've heard numbers somewhere upwards of 80 plus million on all the reposts and translations
[3:37:47.560 --> 3:37:48.560]  that we've had.
[3:37:48.560 --> 3:37:51.760]  Just now, it's been two weeks, it's been 13 days.
[3:37:51.760 --> 3:37:55.000]  It's come to me from every direction, from my liberal friends, from my conservative friends,
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:58.960]  Christian friends, atheist friends, everyone sending it to me, asking me, what do you think
[3:37:58.960 --> 3:38:04.640]  about the occult in Hollywood, the ritualistic abuse of children in Hollywood?
[3:38:04.640 --> 3:38:07.240]  And that's why I'm glad that I watched it.
[3:38:07.240 --> 3:38:08.800]  Now what's next for you and your team?
[3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:11.880]  You have this documentary.
[3:38:11.880 --> 3:38:18.480]  It's exposing the reality of these crimes that are taking place in and around the entertainment
[3:38:18.480 --> 3:38:19.480]  industry.
[3:38:19.480 --> 3:38:23.960]  Well, most people are doing the normal day business of making movies, sort of the people
[3:38:23.960 --> 3:38:27.560]  that control the industry with their agendas and what they're about.
[3:38:27.560 --> 3:38:34.960]  I even just saw an ad for this Lady Gaga special that was just horrifying with its occult imagery
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:38.680]  for this one world symbol.
[3:38:38.680 --> 3:38:40.080]  So what's next?
[3:38:40.080 --> 3:38:42.160]  Where are you guys going from here with this?
[3:38:42.160 --> 3:38:47.960]  Well, going back to what you said before about just talking about the crews on these
[3:38:47.960 --> 3:38:48.960]  movies.
[3:38:48.960 --> 3:38:56.080]  Yeah, as a crew member in film, a lot of the time we work sometimes upwards of 16, 17 hours
[3:38:56.080 --> 3:38:59.480]  a day and sometimes seven days a week for months at a time.
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:03.720]  And the crew puts their heart and soul into these projects and we don't have time for
[3:39:03.720 --> 3:39:04.720]  politics.
[3:39:04.720 --> 3:39:07.040]  We don't have time to research what's going on in the world.
[3:39:07.040 --> 3:39:11.360]  We wake up in the morning, go straight to work and by the end of the day, we're exhausted.
[3:39:11.360 --> 3:39:12.520]  We go home and go to bed.
[3:39:12.520 --> 3:39:14.560]  And these are just hardworking people.
[3:39:14.560 --> 3:39:19.720]  And I just want people to know there's also people higher up that have the abilities to
[3:39:19.720 --> 3:39:23.920]  make great movies such as myself and Mike Smith that can do this kind of things.
[3:39:23.920 --> 3:39:26.840]  And what I'm hoping for is this just opens the opportunities for us.
[3:39:26.840 --> 3:39:28.680]  So where are we going with this?
[3:39:28.680 --> 3:39:32.160]  We obviously are just trying to open up these opportunities for us.
[3:39:32.160 --> 3:39:37.560]  We are reaching out to, I mean, people, investors and other people have reached out to us, but
[3:39:37.560 --> 3:39:41.440]  at the same time, we're also putting it out there that we would like to be connected and
[3:39:41.440 --> 3:39:45.480]  contacted by these people because we still have a passion for this business and we still
[3:39:45.480 --> 3:39:46.480]  want to send a message.
[3:39:46.480 --> 3:39:48.280]  We're very good at what we do.
[3:39:48.280 --> 3:39:53.880]  We're very good storytellers with the film medium and let's send out a good message.
[3:39:53.880 --> 3:39:55.880]  This changed the industry.
[3:39:55.880 --> 3:40:00.560]  I think that I can speak for many of you out there as well that we're all tired of this
[3:40:00.560 --> 3:40:01.560]  Hollywood propaganda.
[3:40:01.560 --> 3:40:05.720]  We're all tired of this violent action.
[3:40:05.720 --> 3:40:09.440]  It doesn't send a good message.
[3:40:09.440 --> 3:40:13.600]  We're tired of going to Amazon, going to Netflix, going to Hulu, going to the theater, looking
[3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:16.000]  up, not anything that you want to watch.
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:20.080]  Or even if there's a beautiful story, they always have this commercial, this reprobate
[3:40:20.080 --> 3:40:25.280]  commercial, maybe just 30 seconds or 60 seconds in the film.
[3:40:25.280 --> 3:40:28.200]  My producing partner Eduardo Varaschi calls it here in the soup.
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:32.360]  They're always here in the soup, but if you're in the soup every day, you're going to die
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:33.360]  of a hairball.
[3:40:33.360 --> 3:40:38.840]  Yeah, and something that we touch upon in the documentary, and I hear Alex say all the
[3:40:38.840 --> 3:40:40.760]  time too, is choice.
[3:40:40.760 --> 3:40:45.560]  You think you have choice, but there's only five companies that own basically all the
[3:40:45.560 --> 3:40:52.840]  media in the world, or 80% of the media in the world, and most of Hollywood as well.
[3:40:52.840 --> 3:40:59.680]  The choice that you think you have is very thin, you talk about Disney, Lucas Films,
[3:40:59.680 --> 3:41:03.160]  and Fox, and Marvel, I mean, that's all one entity right there.
[3:41:03.160 --> 3:41:06.640]  You think you have four choices, but that's one choice right there.
[3:41:06.640 --> 3:41:10.800]  You know, on that note, I'm a big MMA fan, and I saw Dana White, he was like, we're
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:14.000]  going to hold the UFC, we're going to find a place, there'll be no audience, we're going
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:17.440]  to hold the fight, we'll test our fighters, we'll do everything.
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:19.600]  Then he came out of the news a couple of days later.
[3:41:19.600 --> 3:41:27.400]  The UFC, he said Disney, turns out Disney in a way controls ESPN, which controls, owns,
[3:41:27.400 --> 3:41:28.400]  has this deal with UFC.
[3:41:28.400 --> 3:41:32.960]  Dana White said, I got a call from the president of Disney, and I canceled the fight, and I
[3:41:32.960 --> 3:41:36.320]  heard that the day after I watched your documentary, and I said, here we go.
[3:41:36.320 --> 3:41:42.600]  Who would imagine that somebody from Disney would make Dana White have to take a knee?
[3:41:42.600 --> 3:41:45.240]  And that is the reality.
[3:41:45.240 --> 3:41:46.240]  That is the reality.
[3:41:46.240 --> 3:41:58.640]  Yeah, these entities are so powerful, well, first of all, they control the distribution,
[3:41:58.640 --> 3:42:02.320]  they control where the content comes out from.
[3:42:02.320 --> 3:42:09.520]  So you can have the intention of making the most awakening, the most awoke movie in the
[3:42:09.520 --> 3:42:12.720]  world, but no one's going to distribute it, it's not going to get out there.
[3:42:12.720 --> 3:42:18.880]  And I just got to say this about out of shadows that I've never seen anything like this before.
[3:42:18.880 --> 3:42:24.000]  In my 30 years in the business, I mean, obviously the internet is around in the last 20 years,
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  but the explosion that this movie has had is unbelievable to the point where I can't
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:37.120]  think of anything else other than a higher power and the connection with the spirit and
[3:42:37.120 --> 3:42:40.560]  God that's connecting with everybody and sending this out to the world.
[3:42:40.560 --> 3:42:43.560]  Because I'm humbled and it's unbelievable.
[3:42:43.560 --> 3:42:47.200]  Well, Brad Martin, thank you very much and I hope everyone follows you on Twitter and
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:48.200]  shares out of shadows.
[3:42:48.200 --> 3:42:49.200]  Thank you for your courage.
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:50.200]  Thank you, Jason.
[3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:57.280]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes
[3:42:57.280 --> 3:43:02.840]  and the worst is that if you're paying attention, you know, we've done together, but I'll tell
[3:43:02.840 --> 3:43:09.560]  you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy
[3:43:09.560 --> 3:43:14.840]  all independent forms of media, they're trying to shudder and silence human resistance.
[3:43:14.840 --> 3:43:20.360]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[3:43:20.360 --> 3:43:23.640]  and everything you warned your friends and family about us around to be true.
[3:43:23.640 --> 3:43:28.640]  So it's now that your credibility is way up, the power structures are to silence those
[3:43:28.640 --> 3:43:35.360]  of us that they can't, but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[3:43:35.360 --> 3:43:41.400]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[3:43:41.400 --> 3:43:46.160]  We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that long, dark night doesn't
[3:43:46.160 --> 3:43:47.160]  come.
[3:43:47.160 --> 3:44:14.160]  We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that we find hard right now
[3:44:14.160 --> 3:44:39.160]  to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that we find hard right now to make
[3:44:39.160 --> 3:45:05.160]  sure that we find hard right now to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that
[3:45:05.160 --> 3:45:31.160]  we find hard right now to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that we find
[3:45:31.160 --> 3:45:57.160]  hard right now to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that we find hard right

[3:47:53.160 --> 3:48:22.160]  right now to make sure that we find hard right now

[3:54:41.160 --> 3:54:53.160]  I can't even go to the store if I don't have a face mask on. I can't even go to the store to buy ice cream past 11pm or else I'd probably be arrested.
[3:54:53.160 --> 3:55:04.160]  Yeah, I'm glad that your freezer is stocked. The rest of us are suffering, just letting you know. This is just another example of how the elites of our government are going to be taking care of.
[3:55:04.160 --> 3:55:18.160]  While the country they claim to serve burns up in flames with a spoonful of Rocky Road in their mouth. Thank you Alex Jones and Jason Jones for having me on and I'll see you next time.
[3:55:18.160 --> 3:55:35.160]  Well, thank you. Well, thank you to you and I hope everyone subscribes to at left the left show. And you support the zoomers generation Z as they march against the globalists, and as they march to have the same freedoms that you and I have enjoyed and that
[3:55:35.160 --> 3:55:50.160]  the Americans have enjoyed for generations to have an hour of the Alex Jones show is an unbelievable privilege and to offer you my thanks. We're giving you my book for free for a donation of $20 at the great campaign.org.
[3:55:50.160 --> 3:55:59.160]  This audience has been so overwhelming and their support that we're going to be about two weeks behind. We just had to order a whole new shipment of books, the race to save our century.
[3:55:59.160 --> 3:56:18.160]  Follow me at the Jason Jones show. My podcast on YouTube at the Jason Jones show and my Twitter is at Jason Jones show. I love the conversation I've been having with Alex's audience and with all of you info warriors and the line of gesture with all of my guests
[3:56:18.160 --> 3:56:40.160]  today is courage. Like the previous guest set on Alex's Alex's show last hour. What are we afraid of. The one thing I fear is that my posterity lives in tyranny. The one thing I fear is that my posterity suffers the war and poverty, but it's up to us.
[3:56:40.160 --> 3:56:56.160]  We can leave our children and grandchildren, a culture of life, a culture of love, a culture of beauty. We can leave them freedom to do that five principles. Number one, we need to promote the incomparable beauty of the human person in Bible
[3:56:56.160 --> 3:57:12.160]  dignity. Number two, the transcendent moral order. There is a law above the laws of man. There is a natural law and we have rights that the government must kneel to. We do not kneel. Subsidiarity. We need to pull power away from distant, unelected bureaucracies should not be telling
[3:57:12.160 --> 3:57:29.160]  us that we can't rent surfboards. Number four, the humane economy. Freedom is grounded in private property. We are the kings of our castle and finally solidarity. If all of us seek to shoulder the burdens of the most vulnerable in our community, we advance all these five
[3:57:29.160 --> 3:57:43.160]  whole life principles. Our posterity is safe. Thank you, Info Warriors. Thank you, Alex Jones. We have incredible producers and God bless you. Aloha.
