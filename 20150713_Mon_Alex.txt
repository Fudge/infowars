[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.840 --> 00:19.380]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.380 --> 00:36.380]  Texas Alex Jones well the corporate establishment media is now starting to
[00:36.380 --> 00:42.960]  cover all these fake beheading videos that are being put out by Isis I'm not
[00:42.960 --> 00:46.100]  saying Isis isn't murdering people and chopping their heads off and throwing
[00:46.100 --> 00:51.420]  folks off roofs and bombing churches that's going on but these highly
[00:51.420 --> 00:56.420]  produced videos we've seen being put out by the Free Syrian Army Al Qaeda Isis
[00:56.420 --> 01:02.740]  Isol whatever the new name to divert the public is of the week now video has
[01:02.740 --> 01:08.900]  surfaced of the soundstage shooting of one of these beheadings and either it
[01:08.900 --> 01:19.140]  is real that is real footage of the staging or whoever staged the filming
[01:19.140 --> 01:26.460]  deserves a Oscar for recreating the other fake videos because you can see that
[01:26.460 --> 01:38.300]  it's fake green screen desert scenes and the way it's shot is so iconic anyone
[01:38.300 --> 01:43.460]  with a cinematic I can see this is more real than real that is it doesn't look
[01:43.460 --> 01:49.740]  fake it looks over the top real the one shot out of a million and then all the
[01:49.740 --> 01:54.100]  seven-foot men marching five-foot people to the sea to have their heads
[01:54.100 --> 01:59.340]  chopped off as well computer programmed fake we're gonna be going over some of
[01:59.340 --> 02:07.100]  this today I wrote about it Paul Watson wrote about it a decade ago that you
[02:07.100 --> 02:12.060]  would have people like Adam Gadan from the United States arrested for beating
[02:12.060 --> 02:20.500]  up Muslims outside their mosque grandfather former head of the ADL he's
[02:20.500 --> 02:25.620]  arrested for his anti-Muslim activities repeatedly next he pops up the number
[02:25.620 --> 02:31.300]  three guy in Al Qaeda leading jihadist and then of course the videos he's
[02:31.300 --> 02:38.060]  uploaded are being uploaded the same video layer as the Pentagon's directed
[02:38.060 --> 02:43.780]  Intel Center and even wired magazine at the time did a video analysis and said
[02:43.780 --> 02:48.940]  this is fake that is it was uploaded the same video layer with the Al Qaeda bug
[02:48.940 --> 02:58.060]  as the Pentagon bug so that's how stupid they think we are that video is up on
[02:58.060 --> 03:04.300]  info wars.com what the shows is Western intelligence and others and we know is
[03:04.300 --> 03:10.780]  funding ISIS Turkish intelligence Saudi Arabian intelligence NATO that's all
[03:10.780 --> 03:15.740]  come out in the news they've got propaganda cores out there whereas this
[03:15.740 --> 03:19.740]  looks horrible to you and I in the West it looks barbarous this recruits all the
[03:19.740 --> 03:25.540]  real nuts thinking this is just beautiful I'll use the allegory the
[03:25.540 --> 03:30.620]  parallel the analogy of a rotting dead horse now a rotting dead horse stinks
[03:30.620 --> 03:36.380]  and looks really disgusting covered maggots to you or I because we're
[03:36.380 --> 03:43.540]  omnivores that like to eat fresh things strawberries fresh meat grains milk we
[03:43.540 --> 03:47.140]  like tasty things that are clean we're not designed to eat rotten things but to
[03:47.140 --> 03:54.060]  a gaggle of buzzards or a big old goblin a big murder of buzzards that's the term
[03:54.060 --> 04:00.620]  for a whole large group of birds if it's a carrion bird is a murder as it started
[04:00.620 --> 04:04.420]  with crows back in the Middle Ages but it extends so you got a couple hundred
[04:04.420 --> 04:11.140]  buzzards or let's say vultures they see a big old rotten dead horse that looks
[04:11.140 --> 04:20.940]  like that looks like pumpkin pie to them it looks like tapioca pudding and so
[04:20.940 --> 04:32.180]  they put out this stink bait for the craziest jihadis in the world to come
[04:32.180 --> 04:36.140]  scurrying they let them fly wherever they want they let money get raised to
[04:36.140 --> 04:41.460]  build the army of scum and that's now what's been turned loose that's a little
[04:41.460 --> 04:45.300]  side issue we're gonna be getting into that today there's so much news out there

[08:15.180 --> 08:27.980]  lines of the info war
[08:27.980 --> 08:34.380]  it's already the 13th day of July on this Monday worldwide broadcast I am your
[08:34.380 --> 08:40.580]  host Alex Jones and we're going to premiere and play a lot of special
[08:40.580 --> 08:45.500]  reports here today across the political spectrum from different angles and from
[08:45.500 --> 08:51.740]  around the world and we are going to also open the phones up it is a very
[08:51.740 --> 08:59.580]  heavy news day to say the least and I will attempt to cover it all that said
[08:59.580 --> 09:06.580]  last night and again this morning I was brainstorming about ways to reach out to
[09:06.580 --> 09:14.420]  the general public and to try to break them out of their trance and it really
[09:14.420 --> 09:23.540]  hit me that it's parables or basically simple stories historically that are
[09:23.540 --> 09:29.420]  able to get people to shift out of unconsciousness into at least a mode of
[09:29.420 --> 09:37.340]  being somewhat focused on the big picture and I've talked a lot about this
[09:37.340 --> 09:42.340]  pretty much at nauseam but it crystallized that we need to form some
[09:42.340 --> 09:56.140]  type of movement we need to form some type of pro-human union around the
[09:56.140 --> 10:05.340]  world that transcends the divide and conquer that were under attack by and I
[10:05.340 --> 10:08.140]  was really thinking about this last night when I went to bed at like 10 o'clock
[10:08.140 --> 10:14.260]  and then when I woke up this morning and I went downstairs into the kitchen
[10:14.260 --> 10:24.180]  turned on the computer started drinking some coffee and sat back for about 25
[10:24.180 --> 10:30.860]  minutes watching a video and reading an article that Paul Watson had just posted
[10:30.860 --> 10:39.180]  to info wars calm and prison planet calm and watching the video and then
[10:39.180 --> 10:45.540]  thinking about other statements I've seen out of Russian leaders it was
[10:45.540 --> 10:59.380]  incredible and it just crystallized everything I already knew but made it so
[10:59.380 --> 11:07.100]  clear that it almost took a giant weight off of me and then I realized how
[11:07.100 --> 11:16.300]  exhausted I was this understanding was so simple but at the same time so
[11:16.300 --> 11:19.060]  complex
[11:21.860 --> 11:27.820]  that I realize I never really talk about it or get into it because it's
[11:27.820 --> 11:35.900]  something so important it needs to be put in a pamphlet or a book it needs to
[11:35.900 --> 11:44.100]  be promoted it needs to be released with fanfare because it really is the
[11:44.100 --> 11:53.420]  decoding of everything we face and the choice of the species because if I just
[11:53.420 --> 11:58.740]  sit here and spew this information out like a broken fire hydrant onto a boiling
[11:58.740 --> 12:05.180]  August day or in this case a July day the information just kind of evaporates
[12:05.180 --> 12:16.220]  up into the sky in this desert of ignorance yeah maybe a few open minds
[12:16.220 --> 12:21.300]  come and cool off in the water for a few minutes but sure enough the new world
[12:21.300 --> 12:25.620]  order fire department comes along and we'll just fix the leak and you know
[12:25.620 --> 12:31.020]  shove it full of a bunch of Beyonce says ban the first amendment and Hillary says
[12:31.020 --> 12:35.860]  men need to be sent to reeducation fun camps and the Pentagon's training to put
[12:35.860 --> 12:42.180]  tea partyers and quote reeducation camps and you've got more deaths from
[12:42.180 --> 12:51.660]  Gardasil around the world just this background that is the wreckage of the
[12:51.660 --> 13:00.860]  ship of tyranny the ship of death the ship of corruption the ship of fraud the
[13:00.860 --> 13:10.220]  ship that is willing to overturn our world and everything good in it because
[13:10.220 --> 13:19.100]  everything good in it is diametrically opposed to the hellish vision of the
[13:19.100 --> 13:24.180]  controllers and that's why it's hard to break this down because I get inside
[13:24.180 --> 13:28.660]  their mind I get inside their their future plans their current operations
[13:28.660 --> 13:33.220]  their past plans understanding their worldview understanding where they're
[13:33.220 --> 13:47.420]  going understanding the crazed spirit of conquest that fills their sails I know
[13:47.420 --> 14:00.980]  one thing for certain no one should be bored right now no one should be saying
[14:00.980 --> 14:10.260]  their life is meaningless when consciousness on this planet and all
[14:10.260 --> 14:27.460]  that comes with it itself is a limitless pristine god-like opportunity
[14:29.460 --> 14:32.780]  because every day I come in here and every night and every morning I read all
[14:32.780 --> 14:35.660]  these news articles and all these video clips and all these interesting factoids
[14:35.660 --> 14:39.980]  and things I want to cover and things that can be used to get folks to see a
[14:39.980 --> 14:44.540]  wider vista a wider horizon
[14:47.460 --> 14:54.260]  but if you just look at it individually overall it becomes cluttered that sits
[14:54.260 --> 14:59.940]  in front of the mind and blocks out the light of the wider world coming into the
[14:59.940 --> 15:09.700]  cave use the allegory of the third eye it's a bunch of piled up wrecked twisted
[15:09.700 --> 15:20.020]  droppings leavings of the train wreck that we're witnessing and we simply need
[15:20.020 --> 15:24.900]  to understand that we're not going to defeat this system coming at it from
[15:24.900 --> 15:29.060]  its level we're going to have to circumnavigate it we're going to have to
[15:29.060 --> 15:34.340]  get outside of it we're going to have to remove ourselves from it at a far to
[15:34.340 --> 15:39.820]  observe it or the classical statement get outside the box and that's why
[15:39.820 --> 15:46.100]  everything we face in this world everything pushed by the social
[15:46.100 --> 15:55.460]  engineers is there to keep us shuttered dumb down simple minded with limited
[15:55.460 --> 16:00.660]  language and limited semantical symbols unable to communicate with each other at
[16:00.660 --> 16:07.620]  a bestial dumb down level because above that outside the box there is less than
[16:07.620 --> 16:16.420]  one one thousandth of one percent that are evil and who are aware of what's
[16:16.420 --> 16:24.140]  going on who are outside the box and have said oh my gosh we are enlightened
[16:24.140 --> 16:30.140]  we are informed we are eliminated we know what's going on we can't let them
[16:30.140 --> 16:35.540]  inside the box know what's going on outside the box in fact they could find
[16:35.540 --> 16:44.660]  a way out of the subterranean labyrinth and emerge to the surface if we don't
[16:44.660 --> 16:51.060]  wall off all the exits and try to dig them deeper under the ground under level
[16:51.060 --> 17:00.100]  after level after level of rat mazes so that they can sit back and play God over
[17:00.100 --> 17:07.620]  the rest of us you see the globalist funding radical islamicists to
[17:07.620 --> 17:11.340]  destabilize and take down countries you see them going into any nation that's
[17:11.340 --> 17:15.900]  trying to industrialize and bringing them down you see them maneuvering the
[17:15.900 --> 17:20.980]  united states towards financial collapse and setting us up to only be a
[17:20.980 --> 17:25.180]  military power so that we can be the muscle of the globalist but controlled
[17:25.180 --> 17:31.500]  by baubles and industrial goods and energy other countries under the treaties
[17:31.500 --> 17:35.940]  the globalist agreements are not supposed to have big militaries but then
[17:35.940 --> 17:41.180]  they are allowed to have the industry the jobs the factories because they are
[17:41.180 --> 17:46.980]  totalitarian they will then use the totalitarianism as a form of competition
[17:46.980 --> 17:53.220]  to force us to convert to totalitarianism in the name of competing the only way
[17:53.220 --> 17:56.300]  to compete in a globalized world has become more globalized and then that
[17:56.300 --> 18:00.900]  means adopting whatever the high priest of the global order say it is that
[18:00.900 --> 18:06.740]  particular month that particular year that particular decade and when one
[18:06.740 --> 18:12.940]  reads the writings of the globalist it only becomes more hellish but here's
[18:12.940 --> 18:18.660]  the big announcement and it's something you've heard about before but I really
[18:18.660 --> 18:25.500]  want to focus it condense it and hammer it and develop plans with you to try to
[18:25.500 --> 18:32.540]  reach out to others in a catchy way because this is catchy this is dynamite
[18:32.540 --> 18:44.180]  information this is the key to try to shift people out of their their swamp
[18:44.180 --> 18:56.620]  their their trance that they're in and the bottom line is this all fighting
[18:56.620 --> 19:02.900]  between humans whether it be Christian against Muslim or whether it be Mexican
[19:02.900 --> 19:10.740]  against somebody in the US or whether it be Protestant versus Catholic or one
[19:10.740 --> 19:19.300]  black tribe against another black tribe all of it in the end is being
[19:19.300 --> 19:30.860]  artificially exacerbated so that humanity is so fragmented that the
[19:30.860 --> 19:36.780]  scientific takeover can take place and end humanity as we know it now now I
[19:36.780 --> 19:42.540]  understand you already know that but that's a big idea and we come back I
[19:42.540 --> 19:48.820]  want to break down the fact that Russia the United States Libya Germany Mexico
[19:48.820 --> 19:54.100]  Chile Japan doesn't matter where you live what continent or what country we're
[19:54.100 --> 19:59.060]  all under the exact same globalist attack

[20:14.700 --> 20:18.940]  with a built-in radio chip called RFID I felt having to broadcast my personal
[20:18.940 --> 20:23.060]  information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that
[20:23.060 --> 20:27.460]  credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes
[20:27.460 --> 20:31.980]  would all soon incorporate RFID it was then I formed ID stronghold to share my
[20:31.980 --> 20:35.560]  inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world there are a lot of

[24:24.220 --> 24:39.820]  I will give the number out in the next segment then I will start getting into
[24:39.820 --> 24:45.540]  the news and your calls it's just this if you read the hundreds of books and
[24:45.540 --> 24:51.460]  thousands of white papers that are out there admitting this plan we have a
[24:51.460 --> 24:55.820]  technological elite that Eisenhower talked about in control military industrial
[24:55.820 --> 25:02.180]  complex backed by the robber barons of the 18th and 19th century who are in a
[25:02.180 --> 25:06.580]  race to become gods and merge with machines they're setting up a planetary
[25:06.580 --> 25:11.140]  government designed to bankrupt sovereign and self-sufficient nations and
[25:11.140 --> 25:16.660]  individuals every policy is the end family every policy is the end local
[25:16.660 --> 25:21.700]  farming and ranching and sustainable communities which they claim they're
[25:21.700 --> 25:26.980]  promoting we want to give you affordable health care double triple prices we want
[25:26.980 --> 25:30.780]  sustainability everything you do is kill sustainability whether you're in
[25:30.780 --> 25:35.540]  Australia or the US or Canada or Germany they will try to find you and harass you
[25:35.540 --> 25:39.860]  if you have your own wind farm or your own electrical power your own solar they
[25:39.860 --> 25:45.540]  want you wired into the grid and they're admitting all of this now and so what we
[25:45.540 --> 25:50.180]  see being done to Russia the attack on the family the attack on their sovereignty
[25:50.180 --> 25:55.780]  the tariffs the sanctions what do you think NAFTA and Gatt were to the US they
[25:55.780 --> 26:01.380]  were sanctions to distribute the wealth of totalitarian countries the globalist
[26:01.380 --> 26:10.420]  control and it doesn't mean that Russia is run by even wonderful people but they
[26:10.420 --> 26:15.060]  are nationalistic and they do care about their heritage and they are trying to
[26:15.060 --> 26:18.940]  boost their population and they're talking on state-run television over
[26:18.940 --> 26:24.420]  there about how roundtable groups have taken the US over and taken over Europe
[26:24.420 --> 26:29.300]  and how they've already hired a thousand covert Russians in positions of power
[26:29.300 --> 26:34.940]  who will then get part of the power once they overthrow the Russian Federation
[26:34.940 --> 26:40.260]  and they talk about the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and how Putin arrested
[26:40.260 --> 26:44.060]  all their heads and it turned out the oligarchs were just their frontmen and
[26:44.060 --> 26:49.140]  this even came out in British court the Rothschilds sued British newspapers
[26:49.140 --> 26:55.020]  six years ago who were reporting this and the judge said in the case turns out
[26:55.020 --> 27:01.620]  this trial proves it's true and they've got the Vatican completely captured
[27:01.620 --> 27:05.980]  whether the Vatican was good or bad before is a moot point now the Vatican
[27:05.980 --> 27:11.060]  is promoting planetary government carbon taxes and attacks on the family and
[27:11.060 --> 27:14.340]  backing off abortion
[27:16.180 --> 27:22.180]  major Protestant churches across the board are now doing the same thing this
[27:22.180 --> 27:26.660]  is the day of planetary government and understand it's not planetary government
[27:26.660 --> 27:32.580]  to bring in peace to bring in a new age of happiness it brings in absolute death
[27:32.580 --> 27:36.940]  and we just have to get the quotes the facts the statements put it together in
[27:36.940 --> 27:41.380]  well-done films with graphics and animations we need to put out books
[27:41.380 --> 27:48.220]  that just explain the real history of the world and and its future I mean it's
[27:48.220 --> 27:53.660]  the book of secrets it's the new keys to Solomon you can call it whatever you
[27:53.660 --> 28:00.980]  want it's hiding in plain view we seem to be the only ones that understand the
[28:00.980 --> 28:05.380]  full spectrum are saying it and let me tell you that's a scary feeling because
[28:05.380 --> 28:12.220]  I know I'm a hundred percent right and I know that their battle plan is ongoing
[28:12.220 --> 28:17.780]  and it will destroy all of us I don't care if you live in Chile or whether you
[28:17.780 --> 28:21.940]  live in Canada or whether you live in Russia or whether you live in South
[28:21.940 --> 28:25.900]  Africa or whether you live in Nigeria or whether you live in Iraq or whether you
[28:25.900 --> 28:33.060]  live in Tasmania it doesn't matter where you live it is the exact same names the
[28:33.060 --> 28:38.660]  same bureaucrats the same bureaucracies the same taxes the same regulations the
[28:38.660 --> 28:44.780]  same spy tech built into everything to allow globalist and their Skynet
[28:44.780 --> 28:49.100]  program that's what they call the satellite directing drones program in
[28:49.100 --> 28:54.500]  the 70s see they didn't get that from Terminator Terminator got it from them
[28:54.500 --> 29:01.100]  and and Skynet is now being announced autonomous robots ground air and sea and
[29:01.100 --> 29:06.620]  undersea here's just the Wall Street Journal today smart cities will know
[29:06.620 --> 29:10.940]  everything about you Wall Street Journal and how governments are financing and
[29:10.940 --> 29:17.660]  supporting everything going to this they just throw it in your face here's one I
[29:17.660 --> 29:21.460]  mentioned yesterday that I'm gonna get to today cheer up the post-human era is
[29:21.460 --> 29:29.220]  dawning better than friends AP the robot gives undivided attention it isn't
[29:29.220 --> 29:33.100]  like this is just all the evolution of things this is the evolution that's
[29:33.100 --> 29:41.100]  been chosen so when I see people on info wars.com or YouTube racist white
[29:41.100 --> 29:46.100]  people making racist comments racist black people making comments all of you
[29:46.100 --> 29:49.980]  racist Mexicans making comments you're idiots we're on the we're under attack
[29:49.980 --> 29:55.180]  all of us dumbasses Alex I will knock your freaking teeth out if you don't
[29:55.180 --> 30:03.300]  wake up a new MTV show is publicly shaming white people for what they've
[30:03.300 --> 30:09.220]  done in America no this is not a joke it is a huge exercise in white guilt
[30:09.220 --> 30:13.420]  tripping for public consumption the documentary white people shows young
[30:13.420 --> 30:17.460]  Americans crying over their white privilege and expressing angst about
[30:17.460 --> 30:22.180]  how they are desperate not to appeal racist or offend people white people is
[30:22.180 --> 30:26.860]  hosted by journalist Jose Antonio Vargas an illegal immigrant and amnesty
[30:26.860 --> 30:31.180]  activist Vargas also talks to young Native Americans who feel that European
[30:31.180 --> 30:36.660]  settlers did not save the country rather they invaded and took now all that might
[30:36.660 --> 30:41.740]  be true the teenagers featured in the show were born centuries after this took
[30:41.740 --> 30:46.100]  place yet they are being asked to shoulder the burden and share their white
[30:46.100 --> 30:50.260]  guilt the show is already being widely criticized on YouTube with one person
[30:50.260 --> 30:55.380]  writing I'm black even I know this show is straight-up racist watch the trailer
[30:55.380 --> 30:59.700]  for white people at info wars.com

[31:28.820 --> 31:34.420]  statement ton of money there sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around
[31:34.420 --> 31:39.780]  the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency they want to stun and
[31:39.780 --> 31:43.420]  dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then
[31:43.420 --> 31:46.980]  burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally
[31:46.980 --> 31:50.900]  going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it visit

[32:04.020 --> 32:08.620]  or the nightly news or the news website info wars.com because the companies I've
[32:08.620 --> 32:13.020]  been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable
[32:13.020 --> 32:18.020]  as they should be so I refused probably 30-40 firearms manufacturers over the
[32:18.020 --> 32:22.980]  years will then about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms
[32:22.980 --> 32:28.100]  hdfirearms.com own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs special ops people
[32:28.100 --> 32:31.820]  their veterans their patriots their listeners of the radio show and they
[32:31.820 --> 32:35.220]  want to support the broadcast it's always about security whether it's for

[32:59.780 --> 33:13.100]  we now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the
[33:13.100 --> 33:19.060]  resistance rallying Patriots worldwide
[33:19.060 --> 33:30.260]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show one reason we've got a leg up on the
[33:30.260 --> 33:36.180]  globalist is a lot of patriots inside government major corporations in the
[33:36.180 --> 33:43.780]  last 60 years since this plan began to go public in the councils of government
[33:43.780 --> 33:49.260]  after this eugenics plan began to leak in the late 50s there was major
[33:49.260 --> 33:55.900]  opposition to it but there's been parallel recruiting programs going on
[33:55.900 --> 34:03.300]  where they tell people you'll be taken care of once this world government goes
[34:03.300 --> 34:09.100]  into place and the big secret is no you won't be taken care of because when you
[34:09.100 --> 34:13.180]  dig deeper into the globalist admissions they plan to exterminate at
[34:13.180 --> 34:18.660]  least 90% of the public and they're going to do it by releasing soft kill
[34:18.660 --> 34:28.900]  pathogens chemical biological radiological magnetic frequency based as
[34:28.900 --> 34:35.260]  well which is radiation is another class into the environment and then they've
[34:35.260 --> 34:40.180]  got everything set up and structured through centralized computers that the
[34:40.180 --> 34:45.500]  doctors are only allowed to go off diagnoses issued by the diagnostic
[34:45.500 --> 34:49.140]  computers and only allowed to get treatment under the diagnostic
[34:49.140 --> 34:54.260]  directives to whether they're not even able ever able to discover what's
[34:54.260 --> 34:59.620]  killing you and that's why they can't have an independent India or an
[34:59.620 --> 35:06.180]  independent Nigeria or an independent Vatican or an independent CDC or an
[35:06.180 --> 35:11.300]  independent Russia governments institutions or independent doctors in
[35:11.300 --> 35:16.500]  the US Air Force all these examples I just mentioned are where the Russian
[35:16.500 --> 35:24.780]  government Air Force high-level doctors Nigerian top doctors Indian top doctors
[35:24.780 --> 35:28.980]  there's been thousands of cases that I know of in my 20 years on air where
[35:28.980 --> 35:35.100]  scientists go public and go I was brought in at the GMO conference and they
[35:35.100 --> 35:41.580]  admitted that yes this potato that we're designing will sterilize people but
[35:41.580 --> 35:44.580]  that we're to cover it up because there's too many people and I'm not going
[35:44.580 --> 35:52.700]  to be part of it I've had these scientists on British scientists
[35:52.700 --> 36:00.540]  Pakistani scientists scientists go and they test the Vatican when it was a
[36:00.540 --> 36:09.100]  little different in the 80s and in the 90s tested hepatitis shots tetanus
[36:09.100 --> 36:14.460]  shots that they had added chemicals and hormones to to cause an autoimmune event
[36:14.460 --> 36:19.140]  so that women could never carry a baby to term a very vicious form of
[36:19.140 --> 36:23.260]  sterilization that was mainstream news I mean the point is there's just all these
[36:23.260 --> 36:31.420]  quasi-secret programs going on that are targeting all of us and we can see the
[36:31.420 --> 36:38.100]  results the wages of being under globalism is death we can see the cancer
[36:38.100 --> 36:41.980]  up multi-thousand percentage points and in children up over 10,000 percentage
[36:41.980 --> 36:47.140]  points since the 50s we can see the diabetes type 2 up almost 3,000% in the
[36:47.140 --> 36:51.580]  general public way above that in Hispanics do you ever hear lo raza or
[36:51.580 --> 36:59.140]  Metsha or any of these Ford Foundation eugenics based I mean the Ford
[36:59.140 --> 37:02.820]  Foundation funded Hitler and it funds the Mexican groups does that tell you
[37:02.820 --> 37:10.740]  anything and it's not to empower them it's to destroy you so while you're
[37:10.740 --> 37:15.020]  busy saying let's kill Donald Trump because he hates us and they misrepresented
[37:15.020 --> 37:18.220]  even what Donald Trump said but but forget that he's an operative in my
[37:18.220 --> 37:22.820]  view your daughters are being shot up with stuff that reduces their fertility
[37:22.820 --> 37:29.300]  and gives them all sorts of links to reproductive cancers in the uterus in
[37:29.300 --> 37:34.900]  the fallopian tubes in the ovaries you want to get paralyzed you want to get
[37:34.900 --> 37:44.020]  sterilized knock yourself out and I just use that as a microcosm that you're
[37:44.020 --> 37:52.420]  not going to hear anything out of these organizations about what GMO is designed
[37:52.420 --> 37:59.340]  to do or what it's what's being added to the vaccines or the globalist plans
[38:01.540 --> 38:06.700]  because they're going to orchestrate a global cascade of meltdowns playing us
[38:06.700 --> 38:10.940]  off against each other with world government they're refereeing the
[38:10.940 --> 38:21.140]  meltdowns as the omnipotent computerized overlords automated overlords
[38:21.140 --> 38:31.380]  while humanity is basically confused dumbed down put in a trance hypnotized
[38:31.380 --> 38:37.620]  drugged into oblivion and finally euthanized I mean they're not just
[38:37.620 --> 38:40.260]  going to kill granny they're not just going to kill the veterans they're done
[38:40.260 --> 38:44.500]  with they're not just going to put them on a no-treat list and then see if they
[38:44.500 --> 38:49.140]  can get away with it which they have and they're even going to have the same
[38:49.140 --> 38:53.700]  computer company that ran the death camps run the computers doing the exact
[38:53.700 --> 38:57.660]  same thing making the decision and nobody's gonna stand up for the veterans
[38:57.660 --> 39:01.700]  because the veterans groups are controlled as well just like the Hispanic
[39:01.700 --> 39:04.900]  groups are controlled and the white groups are controlled and the black
[39:04.900 --> 39:08.420]  groups are controlled and the Protestants are controlled and the Catholics
[39:08.420 --> 39:11.780]  are controlled and all the major institutions have been bought off and
[39:11.780 --> 39:15.860]  taken control and you're only talking about a few thousand leaders worldwide
[39:15.860 --> 39:21.540]  managing all these groups and what's their number one mission is to get you
[39:21.540 --> 39:31.020]  into a group and to control you and to dumb you down and to have you only know
[39:31.020 --> 39:37.060]  how to fight with other fellow humans over petty stuff that doesn't exist
[39:37.060 --> 39:41.780]  while your food in your water is poisoned while your jobs are taken while
[39:41.780 --> 39:46.460]  your soil is poisoned I mean there's a giant planetary geo engineering
[39:46.460 --> 39:50.620]  programs going on that they admit are going on and they just tell Congress
[39:50.620 --> 39:59.340]  it's classified just like the public still thinks maybe 30% or so that it's a
[39:59.340 --> 40:02.820]  conspiracy theory that a world government's being formed because they
[40:02.820 --> 40:08.060]  just sit there and deny it and deny it and deny it and deny it now I'm gonna do
[40:08.060 --> 40:15.900]  the best job I can going over this but when I go to the comments on info wars
[40:15.900 --> 40:20.660]  calm because they're somewhat uncensored we use one of the biggest third party
[40:20.660 --> 40:25.620]  commenting things it's not us in there I don't have moderators anymore we used to
[40:25.620 --> 40:31.060]  run our own comments and we would then have liability if somebody said kill
[40:31.060 --> 40:35.540]  somebody and I had the FBI the Secret Service the ATF here at my office so
[40:35.540 --> 40:39.940]  many times because of shills in the comments we started using discus which
[40:39.940 --> 40:43.300]  is one of the biggest third-party comment things you're just basically
[40:43.300 --> 40:47.660]  commenting in a window on another giant site when you comment on info wars calm
[40:47.660 --> 40:52.740]  so they can get the government visits and we don't but I don't control what you
[40:52.740 --> 40:57.220]  say in there we are able to go to discus and we've done it before we shoot a
[40:57.220 --> 41:02.620]  whole show on this and get IP addresses and show that there'll be a guy in
[41:02.620 --> 41:06.300]  there saying racist stuff that acting like he's black there'll be another guy
[41:06.300 --> 41:09.940]  in there acting like he's white saying racist stuff and it's the same group of
[41:09.940 --> 41:14.780]  IP addresses coming from the same area and computer experts can look at it say
[41:14.780 --> 41:18.340]  well that's the same IP address or that's a similar one this is the same
[41:18.340 --> 41:23.900]  person but there are some real people in there making jokes you know like what's
[41:23.900 --> 41:28.100]  the only problem with four blacks and a Cadillac going over a cliff a Cadillac
[41:28.100 --> 41:32.300]  seats five you know just horrible stuff and then similar stuff back at white
[41:32.300 --> 41:38.260]  people on and on and on we're all just people is what I'm getting at and we
[41:38.260 --> 41:42.100]  don't have a prayer yes there's differences yes everybody's got a beef
[41:42.100 --> 41:46.780]  with everybody else but the point is if we don't transcend this and I don't mean
[41:46.780 --> 41:50.620]  transcend it and then lay down all our rights and turn our guns in on the backs
[41:50.620 --> 41:54.100]  of transcending it that's not transcending it that's giving over your
[41:54.100 --> 41:58.540]  will and being a slave if we don't realize the computers and the robots are
[41:58.540 --> 42:03.500]  being rolled out in every device in every computer in every appliance to
[42:03.500 --> 42:08.620]  control us and track us to literally enslave us and the cars are already
[42:08.620 --> 42:12.580]  driverless all the new ones already have all the driverless stuff that's why
[42:12.580 --> 42:18.460]  Toyotas and German cars as well BMW is all oh slam the brakes on when it's
[42:18.460 --> 42:21.860]  needed and oh if it's a school bus and it sees it it'll just go ahead and kill
[42:21.860 --> 42:26.180]  you you know slamming into the wall so you don't hurt the greater number this
[42:26.180 --> 42:31.460]  is all being announced that your TV is watching you that all this is happening
[42:31.460 --> 42:37.340]  and it's idiocy and I know it's wrong to sit there and be politically correct
[42:37.340 --> 42:41.100]  and then see whites being attacked everywhere and it being covered up by
[42:41.100 --> 42:44.780]  the media and then to hear all day about how you're bad that's designed to make
[42:44.780 --> 42:50.220]  you hate everybody who isn't white and to get into your group same thing with
[42:50.220 --> 42:56.900]  what blacks see being done to them it's the same MO over and over again or
[42:56.900 --> 43:02.740]  Donald Trump comes out and says you know we got a lot of criminals coming in
[43:02.740 --> 43:08.100]  in Latin America and it's causing a problem not not everybody but a large
[43:08.100 --> 43:11.660]  minority of the folks coming in are basically criminal and we're allowing
[43:11.660 --> 43:15.460]  him to stay here and that's wrong well that's true but then they say in the
[43:15.460 --> 43:20.060]  media Donald Trump says Hispanics are lazy and steel well that's not what he
[43:20.060 --> 43:26.540]  said he said Latin America is collapsing in a crime wave and people are pouring
[43:26.540 --> 43:32.700]  over and then El Chapo escapes from prison for the second time because he
[43:32.700 --> 43:36.220]  guaranteed made paid-offs probably didn't even escape out of the tunnels they're
[43:36.220 --> 43:40.940]  showing that's all for show in my view and he says in his Twitter account I'm
[43:40.940 --> 43:44.940]  coming to get you Donald Trump which has been to make him a folk hero in
[43:44.940 --> 43:51.540]  Mexico and play into all that stuff notice it's a top drug dealer who on
[43:51.540 --> 43:59.020]  record works for the CIA and helps ship drugs into the US probably being
[43:59.020 --> 44:03.660]  directed by the CIA to say this right now in this whole big theater to block
[44:03.660 --> 44:07.340]  out the other Republican candidates by making Donald Trump the center of the
[44:07.340 --> 44:18.700]  universe so there you go ladies and gentlemen another billionaire sneaks out
[44:18.700 --> 44:24.820]  and is now threatening Donald Trump who owns casinos that are basically wedded
[44:24.820 --> 44:28.140]  at the hip with the big banks that launder all the drug money I mean these
[44:28.140 --> 44:33.300]  are just two mafia men in a staged event they've probably had dinner together
[44:33.300 --> 44:39.900]  for all I know I mean this is a joke of jokes and see we're talking about
[44:39.900 --> 44:49.140]  something like this and then it allows him to be elevated even more so he takes
[44:49.140 --> 44:52.340]  all the attention so instead of it being Rand Paul who was number one of the
[44:52.340 --> 44:59.700]  polls for a year up until three months ago now it's who is it Donald Trump as I
[44:59.700 --> 45:06.340]  said it would be Jeb Bush and then Senator Paul and then when the diversions
[45:06.340 --> 45:11.060]  are over Trump will stand down and in to get the nomination will be Jeb Bush and
[45:11.060 --> 45:18.700]  then he will stand down and be a ringer for Hillary Clinton and then Trump
[45:18.700 --> 45:23.300]  can sit there and tweet that he wants to basically kick El Chapo's butt I mean
[45:23.300 --> 45:28.660]  remember Trump is part of the WWE World Wrestling Entertainment or what does it
[45:28.660 --> 45:32.500]  stand for I mean this is all
[45:34.060 --> 45:40.780]  when kids would walk into a restaurant and see the iron chic with Hulk Hogan
[45:40.780 --> 45:48.660]  having a beer they want you guys hate each other no they don't and I guess
[45:48.660 --> 45:55.740]  we're just as stupid I guess it's what we like but Wall Street Journal smart
[45:55.740 --> 46:02.500]  cities will know everything about you how can marketers cash in without
[46:02.500 --> 46:07.660]  becoming enemies of the people and this is an article saying governments have
[46:07.660 --> 46:11.700]  allowed and encouraged everything to be tracked you do and so now everything does
[46:11.700 --> 46:15.500]  listen and watch you but people don't like televisions watching them and
[46:15.500 --> 46:20.140]  listening to them so how do we let marketers cash in without folks getting
[46:20.140 --> 46:25.700]  upset and the answer is hey it's not 1984 it's not really scary it's really not
[46:25.700 --> 46:30.340]  a big deal yes everything you do is tracked and watched and yes yes your
[46:30.340 --> 46:34.180]  laptop is watching you and listening to you but don't worry it's a computer doing
[46:34.180 --> 46:37.420]  it so it's okay
[46:40.220 --> 46:46.100]  you see this is all being set up for the AI and it's a war against humanity
[46:46.100 --> 46:50.220]  there if they want to get rid of fathers and in every sitcom for 40 years
[46:50.220 --> 46:53.180]  fathers or idiots
[46:53.180 --> 46:58.860]  and if we're under all this social engineering and what the US exports is
[46:58.860 --> 47:03.700]  hey we're gonna conquer Russia and teach their kids how to be gay people email me
[47:03.700 --> 47:07.940]  and go why are you against gays let me tell you it isn't about quote gay people
[47:07.940 --> 47:15.420]  it's about don't have kids turn off the the family this is an attack that's why
[47:15.420 --> 47:18.940]  they're banning husband and wife all over the US at the state and federal level
[47:18.940 --> 47:25.260]  and now boy and girl is hateful this is the end my friend beautiful friend of
[47:25.260 --> 47:31.620]  our elaborate plans the end do you understand it's been stated in 1961
[47:31.620 --> 47:36.220]  that a technological scientific elite is in control of a military industrial
[47:36.220 --> 47:43.540]  complex and then it's a severe danger that we we have that in the speech of
[47:43.540 --> 47:47.740]  Eisenhower excise the military technological elite corporate elite
[47:47.740 --> 47:51.180]  taking control the military industrial complex I want to play that in the next
[47:51.180 --> 47:55.660]  segment then I'll give the number down take your calls in the next hour and I
[47:55.660 --> 48:02.300]  know I harp on this but we need to start calling the globalist the aliens
[48:02.300 --> 48:06.540]  because I don't believe they're actually aliens but they are so alien from
[48:06.540 --> 48:13.460]  humans from normal people that have a conscience that want to work with others
[48:13.460 --> 48:17.660]  that want a better world they're so manipulative and so psychotic and think
[48:17.660 --> 48:22.020]  of themselves as a new super species in their own statements and are moving to
[48:22.020 --> 48:27.780]  merge with computers and transcend us and are in a love affair with AI that they
[48:27.780 --> 48:37.340]  believe is gonna merge with them that for all intents and purposes this is an
[48:37.340 --> 48:41.740]  alien invasion but aliens didn't come from a distant star they didn't come
[48:41.740 --> 48:47.540]  from a different dimension they didn't come from the seafloor they're not 2,000
[48:47.540 --> 48:55.380]  feet tall like that last Godzilla movie Pacific Rim that came out it's on our
[48:55.380 --> 49:00.580]  planet with sicko psychopaths merging with machines and whether they merge or
[49:00.580 --> 49:03.580]  not or whether it's already happened there about 30 years ahead of what we
[49:03.580 --> 49:09.420]  know we know that they believe they're a new species and that we've got to be
[49:09.420 --> 49:14.020]  taken out and they're building the AI that's designed from the get-go to take
[49:14.020 --> 49:18.780]  control of our lives and to overturn free markets and to bring in a scientific
[49:18.780 --> 49:23.620]  tyranny and so you've been warned you want to make jokes about white people
[49:23.620 --> 49:26.700]  and go beat them up at street corners you want to sit around and talk about how
[49:26.700 --> 49:28.980]  you're getting your guns ready for the race war and you're gonna kill all the
[49:28.980 --> 49:32.740]  blacks you want to sit around and make jokes all day about the stupid gringos
[49:32.740 --> 49:37.100]  and all the rest of it while your people are having the West toxic waste dump
[49:37.100 --> 49:42.660]  there and being shot up with deadly poisons being aborted stop it we are
[49:42.660 --> 49:47.540]  all under attack we are all human beings and that's why they're dividing us
[49:47.540 --> 49:52.420]  right now this is a scientific program rolled out with clear super psychology
[49:52.420 --> 49:57.060]  systems and AI technology monitoring that can predict the future and can
[49:57.060 --> 50:02.060]  manipulate future outcomes this is the great test of humanity this is over the
[50:02.060 --> 50:08.140]  top and it must stop now you must realize that the bad feeling you've got
[50:08.140 --> 50:13.060]  and the concern you've got in your gut is because we're now facing the conscious
[50:13.060 --> 50:18.620]  rollout of pure evil and the globalist are now on the borders of Russia openly
[50:18.620 --> 50:21.820]  trying to overthrow the Russian government and openly trying to take
[50:21.820 --> 50:25.460]  over their society to shut off their economy and destroy them like they've
[50:25.460 --> 50:30.260]  been Libya and Syria and everybody else and they've done it to us we are
[50:30.260 --> 50:36.180]  absolutely fellow travelers with the Russians not in the Soviet term they
[50:36.180 --> 50:41.220]  would use but in the term that they are under attack by the very same globalist
[50:41.220 --> 50:46.940]  group that doesn't come from America it already jumped on our face late eggs in
[50:46.940 --> 50:52.180]  us our guts busted open the more globalist aliens spilt out and took over
[50:52.180 --> 50:56.700]  the world our belly hatched thousands of these things we're still half alive
[50:56.700 --> 51:01.140]  bleeding to death with our guts hanging out so I say to market lunch look you
[51:01.140 --> 51:03.660]  know I keep hearing from the government that you know they're worried

[54:22.540 --> 54:29.820]  scientific technological elite and the councils of government we must car guard
[54:29.820 --> 54:35.460]  against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by
[54:35.460 --> 54:41.420]  the military industrial complex now today we worry about jade helm that started
[54:41.420 --> 54:46.620]  and they go how dare you even ask questions that's an american that's a
[54:46.620 --> 54:50.620]  quote from the different people on Fox News from Rick Perry from others you can
[54:50.620 --> 54:53.540]  question your government but don't question your military our criminal
[54:53.540 --> 54:57.900]  government runs our military we get this information from the military that the
[54:57.900 --> 55:03.860]  most patriotic group out there now that said David Knight ran in here during the
[55:03.860 --> 55:10.780]  break panting and he said you're not covering the coup in Greece it's coming
[55:10.780 --> 55:14.540]  out they held the president overnight it's a coup and yes that's in my stack
[55:14.540 --> 55:17.740]  and yes I was gonna get to it and David Knight's coming in at eight after and I'm
[55:17.740 --> 55:22.020]  glad I'm glad he's not a trance I'm glad he's concerned I'll be honest with you
[55:22.020 --> 55:27.380]  though starting war with Russia is really bad the globalist overthrowing
[55:27.380 --> 55:30.820]  Greece because they had a no vote we knew that was coming curtain Emma wrote
[55:30.820 --> 55:37.540]  about it last Tuesday that the there was a move for a coup I mean they already
[55:37.540 --> 55:40.900]  installed leaders in Greece before and in Italy I mean they now install
[55:40.900 --> 55:46.580]  Goldman Sachs heads of Europe as the presidents so I'm not saying it isn't
[55:46.580 --> 55:53.260]  important it's just that compared to the admission that they're rolling out this
[55:53.260 --> 55:57.580]  takeover and that it's the end of humanity as we know it and it's
[55:57.580 --> 56:01.100]  suddenly in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times of London in the
[56:01.100 --> 56:08.100]  last 24 hours sell your family heirlooms but can Greece raise the cash AFP and
[56:08.100 --> 56:12.940]  what happened overnight the airports the islands the parks everything will now
[56:12.940 --> 56:18.060]  be given not to the EU but to the creditors the private central banks who
[56:18.060 --> 56:22.420]  already got most of it in the last few years and they will now raise taxes on
[56:22.420 --> 56:29.620]  tourism even though they have some of the highest taxes in the world and they
[56:29.620 --> 56:33.580]  tell the average conservative oh Greece deserves it well it's true they were
[56:33.580 --> 56:40.260]  maneuvered into big government so they would be controlled but you have to
[56:40.260 --> 56:45.420]  understand we're in bigger debt and in deeper trouble than they are and so
[56:45.420 --> 56:48.940]  folks that sit around and feel like they're elitist going yeah those Greeks
[56:48.940 --> 56:54.100]  getting what they want yeah Mexico can never seem to get its act together we

[56:58.340 --> 57:02.420]  but in the next phase as Jimmy Carter said over the weekend they intend to
[57:02.420 --> 57:08.860]  bring the United States down to nothing they've already deindustrialized us
[57:08.860 --> 57:12.940]  they're already waging war on small farmers and small independent communities
[57:12.940 --> 57:17.500]  under the president's rural commission that's run by the Department of Defense
[57:17.500 --> 57:23.100]  who has your local plain clothes military officers in every town and city
[57:23.100 --> 57:26.900]  working with federal funds to move the police department and county sheriff

[57:43.020 --> 57:47.740]  like the body snatchers boys and girls and then they intend to phase out the human

[1:03:31.340 --> 1:03:35.860]  because it's so bad it'll be covered up because it's too big to fail see that's
[1:03:35.860 --> 1:03:40.820]  the thing my dad used to explain to me growing up in Dallas watching the

[1:04:55.300 --> 1:05:01.060]  straight ahead with David Knight Russian Parliament member Yevgeny Federov
[1:05:01.060 --> 1:05:04.340]  claims that Russian Arlegarks are in negotiations with top American
[1:05:04.340 --> 1:05:07.860]  corporations and the White House to foment an astroturf revolution that
[1:05:07.860 --> 1:05:10.860]  will lead to the ouster of President Vladimir Putin and the collapse of the
[1:05:10.860 --> 1:05:14.660]  Russian Federation within two years they're conducting a negotiation process
[1:05:14.660 --> 1:05:17.540]  with the Russian elites for the extradition of Putin we know the
[1:05:17.540 --> 1:05:21.220]  objective is the destruction of the Russian Federation after August through
[1:05:21.220 --> 1:05:24.260]  the winter I think by the drop of living standards they will be able to
[1:05:24.260 --> 1:05:27.260]  bring out several hundred thousand people into the streets simply because
[1:05:27.260 --> 1:05:29.940]  with the help of the government they will severely crash people's living
[1:05:29.940 --> 1:05:33.460]  standards and this will be especially felt after winter Federov added that
[1:05:33.460 --> 1:05:37.660]  spring 2016 could be the time period in which the coup is initiated he also
[1:05:37.660 --> 1:05:41.940]  identified John F. Teff the United States ambassador to Russia as being the
[1:05:41.940 --> 1:05:45.500]  figurehead behind the conspiracy also Russian hackers have released what
[1:05:45.500 --> 1:05:49.300]  looks to be a staged ISIS beheading video that the hackers claim they got

[1:08:06.660 --> 1:08:09.060]  network
[1:08:18.300 --> 1:08:23.340]  the last hour I broke down the big threat to humanity a scientific
[1:08:23.340 --> 1:08:27.100]  technological elite that has seized control of the brain trust of the West
[1:08:27.100 --> 1:08:33.500]  and our treasure and our arms and our knights to launch evil wars across the
[1:08:33.500 --> 1:08:39.180]  planet against enemies they've helped create and foster to destroy our name
[1:08:39.180 --> 1:08:43.660]  to destroy our treasure but to also establish a planetary government on the
[1:08:43.660 --> 1:08:49.340]  ashes of that the TPP is secret three sections are public that were leaked
[1:08:49.340 --> 1:08:57.100]  draconian takeover a free speech banking private property local hospitals a total
[1:08:57.100 --> 1:09:05.500]  control of society you expand from there Greece has a historic no vote and now
[1:09:05.500 --> 1:09:09.340]  their president was basically held overnight suddenly we hear in the
[1:09:09.340 --> 1:09:13.180]  morning that oh there is a deal despite how the people voted and the
[1:09:13.180 --> 1:09:18.300]  infrastructure is being handed over to Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and others that
[1:09:18.300 --> 1:09:23.180]  control the EU the EU is designed to take over nations and bankrupt them it was
[1:09:23.180 --> 1:09:27.180]  Goldman Sachs and others that helped get Greece into the euro and lied about the
[1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:31.860]  debts to again position them this is economic conquest in their own words
[1:09:31.860 --> 1:09:36.140]  this has come out in the economic forum minutes it's come out in the World Bank and
[1:09:36.140 --> 1:09:42.940]  IMF documents this is a predatory fact yes it's true that the country had
[1:09:42.940 --> 1:09:50.140]  socialist politicians put into power to maneuver them towards being dependent
[1:09:50.140 --> 1:09:53.980]  but the lion's share of the debt is derivatives they've been signed on to
[1:09:53.980 --> 1:09:59.660]  so the point is they will never emerge from economic bondage if they're
[1:09:59.660 --> 1:10:05.740]  unable to self-determine so now their vote of the people in the birthplace of
[1:10:05.740 --> 1:10:12.380]  people power Greece has been overrun and overruled and it's not even really in
[1:10:12.380 --> 1:10:17.420]  the news or it's a footnote in the Wall Street Journal or a footnote in AP oh
[1:10:17.420 --> 1:10:21.580]  overnight a deal was struck for the entire infrastructure the national parks
[1:10:21.580 --> 1:10:27.260]  the islands the airports the roads it'll all now be in secret meetings given away
[1:10:27.260 --> 1:10:33.980]  at pennies on the dollar as a direct tax by the banks oh and capital controls for
[1:10:33.980 --> 1:10:39.020]  six months oh and direct taxes out of your paycheck to private banks this is
[1:10:39.020 --> 1:10:43.500]  a direct payment to the mega banks what did they call for three years ago at
[1:10:43.500 --> 1:10:49.100]  Davos London dependent headline Soros and others want 100 trillion a year
[1:10:49.100 --> 1:10:56.300]  liquidity Davos is the headline wants 100 trillion every decade to be paid to
[1:10:56.300 --> 1:11:03.020]  them this is true corporate private global governance and is the model that
[1:11:03.020 --> 1:11:09.020]  will then take down Spain Portugal Ireland
[1:11:09.820 --> 1:11:18.460]  Italy then France then the UK and this is the direct plan we broke this down on
[1:11:18.460 --> 1:11:23.020]  my film in game eight years ago just just to document that this is not us
[1:11:23.020 --> 1:11:26.060]  speculating on current events we predicted at all
[1:11:26.060 --> 1:11:29.980]  David Knight has got a stack of breaking news on this front David I got to tell
[1:11:29.980 --> 1:11:35.820]  you the most amazing facet of all this for me is that it's not in the headlines
[1:11:35.820 --> 1:11:39.180]  stealth coup in Greece we need to get our writers on this right now
[1:11:39.180 --> 1:11:42.860]  and to get an article out because no one else it seems there are a few Greek
[1:11:42.860 --> 1:11:46.540]  newspapers saying it this is unprecedented and the people are saying
[1:11:46.540 --> 1:11:52.380]  why do we even vote a week ago Sunday well a week later boom what happened
[1:11:52.380 --> 1:11:55.980]  chronicle it right now David Knight well there is a hashtag Alex out there
[1:11:55.980 --> 1:12:01.340]  hashtag this is a coup and the former finance minister Verifakis has
[1:12:01.340 --> 1:12:05.900]  said that this he compared it to the 1967 coup d'etat that installed the military
[1:12:05.900 --> 1:12:09.980]  dictatorship in Greece he says in the coup d'etat the choice of weapon used
[1:12:09.980 --> 1:12:14.380]  in order to bring down democracy then was tanks this time it is the banks the
[1:12:14.380 --> 1:12:18.140]  financial times has dubbed it the most intrusive economic supervision program
[1:12:18.140 --> 1:12:21.900]  ever mounted in the EU this is a situation Alex where they're going to be
[1:12:21.900 --> 1:12:25.260]  raising pensions they're going to be cutting they're going to be cutting
[1:12:25.260 --> 1:12:28.460]  pensions are going to be raising taxes are going to raise the retirement age
[1:12:28.460 --> 1:12:31.500]  they're even telling them Alex that they've got to work longer hours are
[1:12:31.500 --> 1:12:35.740]  going to the EU is saying you're going to have to get rid of those laws that
[1:12:35.740 --> 1:12:39.820]  say that stores can't be open on Sundays this harkens back to what Jeb Bush
[1:12:39.820 --> 1:12:43.340]  just said this last week the media softened it they said well he said
[1:12:43.340 --> 1:12:46.780]  people need to work longer hours he just meant that they need to have the
[1:12:46.780 --> 1:12:51.020]  opportunity to work longer hours that's not where these people are coming from
[1:12:51.020 --> 1:12:55.100]  and the real concern is that over the will of the people I mean a week ago
[1:12:55.100 --> 1:12:58.300]  we were all excited we saw the greek people say we knew they were going to
[1:12:58.300 --> 1:13:01.020]  strike back in curtain immoral they're going to launch a coup yeah yeah
[1:13:01.020 --> 1:13:05.180]  we saw the greek people say moulin l'abbe come and take it in defiance
[1:13:05.180 --> 1:13:10.300]  this week we see after they browbeat the the prime minister of greece
[1:13:10.300 --> 1:13:14.140]  he says come and take it in a supine position they said
[1:13:14.140 --> 1:13:17.500]  two different reports said he looked like a beaten dog after he came out of
[1:13:17.500 --> 1:13:22.860]  these meetings absolutely whenever Nigel Farage the
[1:13:22.860 --> 1:13:26.060]  leader of u-kip in the EU parliament said you know you you've done the right
[1:13:26.060 --> 1:13:27.980]  thing but now they're going to come after you
[1:13:27.980 --> 1:13:32.060]  you need to devalue currency now folks will want to come there because it's
[1:13:32.060 --> 1:13:35.660]  cheap you're going to be a slave forever if you don't do this the EU is meant to
[1:13:35.660 --> 1:13:38.940]  destroy you and then if we pull back and look at
[1:13:38.940 --> 1:13:41.980]  this this is what the globalists have done in every other country
[1:13:41.980 --> 1:13:45.740]  they're following a scenario here and I want to put up the article
[1:13:45.740 --> 1:13:53.020]  that Kurt Nemo wrote Washington preparing greek coup that was on tuesday
[1:13:53.020 --> 1:13:56.460]  two days after they had the referendum we had the article
[1:13:56.460 --> 1:14:00.060]  with the intel that they were preparing the coup
[1:14:00.060 --> 1:14:06.220]  and what's wild is they admittedly have been preparing with NGOs coups
[1:14:06.220 --> 1:14:10.140]  inside russia and the russians are not going to go along with this so this is
[1:14:10.140 --> 1:14:14.060]  just incredibly dangerous there's the headline from
[1:14:14.060 --> 1:14:17.900]  July 6 US preparing coup to prevent Greece
[1:14:17.900 --> 1:14:21.660]  from falling under russian influence so so this tuesday
[1:14:21.660 --> 1:14:24.860]  you know a week ago alex they were saying that the greek people rejected
[1:14:24.860 --> 1:14:28.460]  an eight and a half billion dollar extended pretend loan
[1:14:28.460 --> 1:14:31.740]  this week now it is eighty six billion dollars total package of the covenant
[1:14:31.740 --> 1:14:34.700]  they are hammering these people to teach them a lesson
[1:14:34.700 --> 1:14:38.780]  they had the audacity to say no to these people they had the intel that they
[1:14:38.780 --> 1:14:41.740]  wanted them to actually vote no and that they were really getting ready to set
[1:14:41.740 --> 1:14:44.380]  them up yeah yeah they're going to take 50 billion
[1:14:44.380 --> 1:14:47.820]  dollars worth of hard assets i think it's it's not only a financial
[1:14:47.820 --> 1:14:50.460]  move but it's also i think symbolic they're going to take their power
[1:14:50.460 --> 1:14:53.180]  generation stations they're going to put it into a fund they're totally
[1:14:53.180 --> 1:14:56.060]  conquering them yeah they're totally conquering them
[1:14:56.060 --> 1:14:59.180]  and notice just like all these other countries they've done it too they'll
[1:14:59.180 --> 1:15:02.220]  never get out of it yeah that's right that's right and then it'll make the
[1:15:02.220 --> 1:15:06.700]  culture go completely criminal not paying taxes drugs prostitution
[1:15:06.700 --> 1:15:09.580]  which the globalists will then launder and control as well and they'll go the
[1:15:09.580 --> 1:15:12.700]  way of mexico the way everybody else that's the way that it's always been
[1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:15.420]  going back to the world bank the imf fund
[1:15:15.420 --> 1:15:18.300]  they were talking about how you're making loans to countries that's not about
[1:15:18.300 --> 1:15:21.020]  improving their infrastructure the productivity you're making loans to them
[1:15:21.020 --> 1:15:24.220]  to increase a welfare state because you're seeking rent
[1:15:24.220 --> 1:15:27.740]  you want to turn them into renters well the imf world bank are on record they
[1:15:27.740 --> 1:15:31.100]  only give the money to their private global subsidiaries
[1:15:31.100 --> 1:15:34.700]  they don't give the loans to the countries that's right they give the loans
[1:15:34.700 --> 1:15:38.780]  to their companies they go we'll give a two billion dollar loan to a national
[1:15:38.780 --> 1:15:43.420]  district for your water if you give it to us the water districts say in one
[1:15:43.420 --> 1:15:46.620]  country i was reading was worth like 20 billion dollars they get it for
[1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:50.380]  a couple billion dollars and then they still keep them in debt
[1:15:50.380 --> 1:15:54.300]  after the purchase for the maintenance of it and then double and triple water
[1:15:54.300 --> 1:15:58.380]  prices yes i mean this is a this is the opposite of privatization
[1:15:58.380 --> 1:16:02.540]  well verifakis had addressed uh back in the middle of june he had addressed a
[1:16:02.540 --> 1:16:07.740]  meeting and he said if you really want to pay off the private investors in
[1:16:07.740 --> 1:16:11.660]  greece and greek people who have loaned this money to the greek people he said
[1:16:11.660 --> 1:16:14.380]  he opposed this because he knew that they couldn't pay it he knew that they were
[1:16:14.380 --> 1:16:17.500]  going into debt that they were not going to be able to get out of it goes but
[1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:21.180]  they've enacted these austerity programs to make us even less able to pay the
[1:16:21.180 --> 1:16:25.180]  debt that's in the imf world bank plans leaked in 2002 exactly is they raised
[1:16:25.180 --> 1:16:28.780]  the taxes so it's impossible they already have huge taxes on tourism
[1:16:28.780 --> 1:16:33.100]  they wanted to add another 15 vat across the board
[1:16:33.100 --> 1:16:36.940]  which will make it too expensive to go there i mean they know exactly
[1:16:36.940 --> 1:16:39.580]  what they're doing it'd be like telling a hamburger place
[1:16:39.580 --> 1:16:42.940]  you got to charge 50 bucks for a hamburger when your competitors burgers
[1:16:42.940 --> 1:16:46.220]  are just as good for seven dollars and they always love to pull this in when
[1:16:46.220 --> 1:16:48.940]  they've got a socialist government or when they got a democrat
[1:16:48.940 --> 1:16:53.580]  in charge of uh of the us as in president they bring in the north american free
[1:16:53.580 --> 1:16:57.500]  trade agreement or they bring in the tpp the ttip the transatlantic
[1:16:57.500 --> 1:17:00.140]  trans specific agreements because they know that
[1:17:00.140 --> 1:17:04.700]  uh they're going to get a large part of that uh political party thinking we're
[1:17:04.700 --> 1:17:07.100]  going to be protected because we've got a guy who's standing there for the
[1:17:07.100 --> 1:17:09.980]  people look at what Hugo Chevez did in venezuela
[1:17:09.980 --> 1:17:13.580]  the bankers were bragging about how they got 700 return
[1:17:13.580 --> 1:17:17.500]  from venezuela because Hugo Chevez realized that their debt was most
[1:17:17.500 --> 1:17:21.420]  important that they would get their money before he would get food water and
[1:17:21.420 --> 1:17:24.540]  medicine for his people and that's precisely what has happened there
[1:17:24.540 --> 1:17:27.260]  we're seeing the same kind of sell out from the socialists
[1:17:27.260 --> 1:17:31.180]  in greece as well they always sell you out the worst from their jumbo jets and
[1:17:31.180 --> 1:17:35.180]  their red carpets now remember we saw
[1:17:35.180 --> 1:17:38.380]  thousands of trillions of fake fiat counterfeit that
[1:17:38.380 --> 1:17:42.540]  every country signed on to in 2008 another global governance move
[1:17:42.540 --> 1:17:45.900]  as they threatened worldwide financial meltdown if we didn't they dropped the
[1:17:45.900 --> 1:17:50.060]  stock market 35 percent everybody panics will do whatever you want
[1:17:50.060 --> 1:17:53.020]  they're given hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars per
[1:17:53.020 --> 1:17:56.140]  mega bank uh they're given trillions in open
[1:17:56.140 --> 1:17:59.660]  window federal reserve money zero percent interest
[1:17:59.660 --> 1:18:03.820]  and then they sit around lecturing everyone saying you've got to work more
[1:18:03.820 --> 1:18:07.820]  hours it is simply insane knowing
[1:18:07.820 --> 1:18:10.300]  that america has the hardest working people in the world
[1:18:10.300 --> 1:18:14.300]  if you work if you work they've got international studies
[1:18:14.300 --> 1:18:17.980]  the working class in america that means middle class as well
[1:18:17.980 --> 1:18:23.420]  works on average 67 hours a week the other average in europe something like
[1:18:23.420 --> 1:18:27.340]  41 now imagine 41 hours isn't lazy
[1:18:27.340 --> 1:18:31.100]  67 isn't lazy so they know those of us that are
[1:18:31.100 --> 1:18:33.980]  prideful those of us that like to work those of us that wouldn't be caught dead
[1:18:33.980 --> 1:18:37.500]  in a you know in a welfare line they know those of us that don't want to
[1:18:37.500 --> 1:18:41.020]  figure out subsidies and play the games and take the politicians out you know
[1:18:41.020 --> 1:18:44.540]  out to dinner and give money to the mayor so they make me tax exempt locally
[1:18:44.540 --> 1:18:47.660]  i mean i've been told by tax lawyers that's what you do
[1:18:47.660 --> 1:18:51.500]  i mean you give political money you go out to dinners you do all this and then
[1:18:51.500 --> 1:18:55.100]  you get to i mean it's insane they know we won't do that
[1:18:55.100 --> 1:18:59.180]  so they can just keep raising taxes raising taxes and we told everybody
[1:18:59.180 --> 1:19:02.380]  they want digital money they want to get rid of cash so they can shut down
[1:19:02.380 --> 1:19:05.500]  grassroots economies and so they can take over every
[1:19:05.500 --> 1:19:09.980]  single economy in the world and then just take the money out of your account
[1:19:09.980 --> 1:19:13.500]  six months of capital controls they're saying they're going to grab 30 percent
[1:19:13.500 --> 1:19:16.860]  out of everybody's bank accounts in greece on top of their whole infrastructure
[1:19:16.860 --> 1:19:20.300]  and you watch we'll be here in five years talking about another bailout
[1:19:20.300 --> 1:19:23.180]  in germany i'm going to hope do you one more segment cover the other headlines
[1:19:23.180 --> 1:19:27.500]  in germany three years ago they announced nationwide to women that have been
[1:19:27.500 --> 1:19:30.460]  out of work for more than a year and that are attractive you go in to see the
[1:19:30.460 --> 1:19:35.740]  bureaucrat and the bureaucrat tells you we've got a liaison in the legal

[1:19:39.660 --> 1:19:43.100]  and they say okay because you've got to now pay back
[1:19:43.100 --> 1:19:47.100]  the welfare you've been paid so even if you
[1:19:47.100 --> 1:19:50.300]  go to work you got to pay us and the government is now the pimp
[1:19:50.300 --> 1:19:53.740]  so roam before it collapsed they made the gentry

[1:24:09.260 --> 1:24:13.900]  out at the end of this segment when we open the phones up
[1:24:13.900 --> 1:24:18.780]  but globalism is a trap the new world order is a takeover
[1:24:18.780 --> 1:24:22.620]  everything they they push is premeditatedly evil
[1:24:22.620 --> 1:24:26.380]  under a Machiavellian plan that the injustice the means
[1:24:26.380 --> 1:24:29.580]  we must break with the new world order and everything it promotes we must get
[1:24:29.580 --> 1:24:33.180]  back to human communities true local sustainability
[1:24:33.180 --> 1:24:36.700]  and in honor a chivalry or we're going to lose everything i'm going to get back
[1:24:36.700 --> 1:24:40.060]  to what's happening in Greece the model for the world
[1:24:40.060 --> 1:24:44.460]  but first here's admiral act bar on the greece situation
[1:24:44.460 --> 1:24:49.020]  it's a trap just thought we'd add that let's play it one more time for the kids
[1:24:49.020 --> 1:24:51.980]  out there watching it's a trap
[1:24:51.980 --> 1:25:00.140]  maybe one more time because all of this is and you know i'm trying to throw some
[1:25:00.140 --> 1:25:02.780]  levity in here this is very very sad we got five minutes left in this segment
[1:25:02.780 --> 1:25:06.140]  david you got a bunch of articles you've got the floor i'm just very upset about
[1:25:06.140 --> 1:25:08.300]  this run over what's actually happening over there
[1:25:08.300 --> 1:25:11.100]  and the president disappearing overnight the rest of it
[1:25:11.100 --> 1:25:17.100]  we know alex they had a uh 16 hours of negotiation after 14 hours uh the greek
[1:25:17.100 --> 1:25:21.180]  prime minister and angola merkel because this is really kind of a a
[1:25:21.180 --> 1:25:24.780]  conflict between them primarily it was the germans that were really pushing
[1:25:24.780 --> 1:25:27.580]  this especially merkel doesn't germany oh
[1:25:27.580 --> 1:25:30.300]  greece a bunch of money for invading them that they never had to pay reparations
[1:25:30.300 --> 1:25:33.580]  at the end of world war two for that that's right the uh nazis confiscated
[1:25:33.580 --> 1:25:37.500]  a massive amount of uh of gold that they never repaid
[1:25:37.500 --> 1:25:41.980]  and then afterwards in 1953 greece was a part of a large number of countries
[1:25:41.980 --> 1:25:45.340]  that forgave uh german debt after world war two so
[1:25:45.340 --> 1:25:47.980]  yeah there's a couple of different issues like that but they're not very
[1:25:47.980 --> 1:25:51.740]  forgiving about this because they are using this as a coup that's what
[1:25:51.740 --> 1:25:55.100]  everybody is talking about after 14 hours of negotiation alex
[1:25:55.100 --> 1:25:58.620]  they got up to leave and the president of the european council donald
[1:25:58.620 --> 1:26:03.340]  uh donald tusk said sorry but there's no way you're going to leave this room
[1:26:03.340 --> 1:26:06.540]  because they're not going to let this happen you know it was back in 1826
[1:26:06.540 --> 1:26:09.980]  somebody tweeted out on this hashtag uh this is a coup they said
[1:26:09.980 --> 1:26:13.500]  this is a quote from john adams in 1826 he said there's two ways to conquer an
[1:26:13.500 --> 1:26:16.860]  enslave a nation one is by the sword the other is by
[1:26:16.860 --> 1:26:20.380]  debt and that's precisely what we're doing but this has an added dimension to
[1:26:20.380 --> 1:26:23.100]  it in the sense that we're going to see this just like
[1:26:23.100 --> 1:26:27.180]  the german invasion of poland people needed to understand that was
[1:26:27.180 --> 1:26:30.300]  a setting up a precedent of what how the germans were going to conduct
[1:26:30.300 --> 1:26:34.220]  themselves this is how the globalist bankers who created
[1:26:34.220 --> 1:26:37.500]  uh the eeu with the bill de berg group i'm as a bunch of former nazis who did
[1:26:37.500 --> 1:26:41.820]  that to start with this is their plan for global domination beginning in europe
[1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:45.340]  and then moving elsewhere this banker plan even though greece is only about a
[1:26:45.340 --> 1:26:47.900]  13th the size of the money that was lost
[1:26:47.900 --> 1:26:51.740]  uh in in this chinese stock market that it still
[1:26:51.740 --> 1:26:55.900]  establishes a lot of precedence and we can see how they're doing exactly what
[1:26:55.900 --> 1:26:59.420]  we said all these preparations were for yes all the announcements we got to get
[1:26:59.420 --> 1:27:02.140]  rid of cash we got to get rid of barter we got to shut down local
[1:27:02.140 --> 1:27:05.100]  sales we got to stop you know the farmers markets
[1:27:05.100 --> 1:27:08.300]  because they're getting ready for a depression they want a social engineer
[1:27:08.300 --> 1:27:13.100]  us during the depression it could backfire and ignite local commerce again
[1:27:13.100 --> 1:27:16.300]  if that happens that will screw up their technological
[1:27:16.300 --> 1:27:19.180]  technocracy and the rise of the robots
[1:27:19.180 --> 1:27:22.140]  they've got to get humans down on their knees
[1:27:22.140 --> 1:27:25.260]  they've got to get us dependent the two things that i thought were so
[1:27:25.260 --> 1:27:28.620]  astounding about this particular agreement to alex was that of course
[1:27:28.620 --> 1:27:33.260]  they're taking a 50 some odd billion euros in terms of privatization companies
[1:27:33.260 --> 1:27:35.660]  and they're going to put that into an investment fund they say
[1:27:35.660 --> 1:27:40.060]  well it was a victory for the greek prime minister that that fund is going to
[1:27:40.060 --> 1:27:44.460]  be based in ethans and not luxembourg but look this is a crony capitalist fund
[1:27:44.460 --> 1:27:48.620]  it is nothing but crony capitalism as max keiser pointed out only the really
[1:27:48.620 --> 1:27:52.620]  big banks can even get an access to that everybody else will be sold
[1:27:52.620 --> 1:27:56.140]  sure the top three or four greek oligarchs will be given entree into the
[1:27:56.140 --> 1:27:59.100]  slush fund but no one else will that's right
[1:27:59.100 --> 1:28:03.020]  and then of course the other part of it is as the london financial time said
[1:28:03.020 --> 1:28:06.220]  this is the most intrusive economic supervision program
[1:28:06.220 --> 1:28:10.700]  ever mounted in the eu they're going to tell them how to do raise taxes they're
[1:28:10.700 --> 1:28:13.500]  going to cut their pensions they're going to
[1:28:13.500 --> 1:28:16.380]  open up close professions they say they're going to change sunday trading
[1:28:16.380 --> 1:28:20.060]  laws even milk producers and bakers will be under the
[1:28:20.060 --> 1:28:23.260]  regulation of brussels and by the way since i mentioned
[1:28:23.260 --> 1:28:26.460]  it earlier and it sounded so wild they found a london telegraph article not
[1:28:26.460 --> 1:28:30.700]  the one i'd seen out of der spiegel a few years ago but another one even older
[1:28:30.700 --> 1:28:35.900]  from 2005 london telegraph where a woman had lost her job as a waitress
[1:28:35.900 --> 1:28:38.300]  and they said okay at the at the employment office we're going to
[1:28:38.300 --> 1:28:40.540]  send you to work at a brothel you're pretty hot
[1:28:40.540 --> 1:28:43.260]  she said no i don't want to have sex with ten minute a
[1:28:43.260 --> 1:28:47.820]  that was what they wanted her to do and so they kicked her off her welfare
[1:28:47.820 --> 1:28:51.340]  yeah there's the headline if you don't take a job as a prostitute we can stop
[1:28:51.340 --> 1:28:54.780]  your benefits yeah so so i'm not joking when i said in rome
[1:28:54.780 --> 1:28:59.020]  by the time it collapsed they were making the roman
[1:28:59.020 --> 1:29:02.860]  wives of the elite have sex at public brothels to raise money
[1:29:02.860 --> 1:29:07.100]  absolutely this is what this is leading to we can see this coming in by
[1:29:07.100 --> 1:29:09.820]  degrees as uh some of the people writing this is
[1:29:09.820 --> 1:29:13.180]  misery humiliation and slavery we have to understand
[1:29:13.180 --> 1:29:17.740]  that serfs and medieval times paid 10 in some cases 15 percent
[1:29:17.740 --> 1:29:21.260]  that's nothing if we could get to that level i pay almost 70 percent
[1:29:21.260 --> 1:29:24.860]  exactly because i'm an actual business owner exactly i mean it's a joke
[1:29:24.860 --> 1:29:29.180]  we're far worse off than the serfs and the slaves and this is serfdom this is
[1:29:29.180 --> 1:29:32.860]  slavery this is a taking of sovereignty not just
[1:29:32.860 --> 1:29:35.660]  humiliating them financially but humiliating them in terms of
[1:29:35.660 --> 1:29:39.660]  unprecedented and it's being prepared for everyone else right

[1:36:10.460 --> 1:36:15.900]  headlines about you know five million for shrimp on treadmills
[1:36:15.900 --> 1:36:19.020]  well actually it was shrimp on prozac on treadmills
[1:36:19.020 --> 1:36:24.380]  and you ask what is all this about well i've been inside the secret areas
[1:36:24.380 --> 1:36:28.380]  restricted areas of the university of texas psychology department
[1:36:28.380 --> 1:36:31.820]  that's basic i told i told about this 12 years ago and i was loud and twice
[1:36:31.820 --> 1:36:35.020]  and i had to wait till the guy left to go be at mit before i could
[1:36:35.020 --> 1:36:38.060]  talk about it was part of the rule he'd even say where he went he'd think they
[1:36:38.060 --> 1:36:41.980]  could figure it out but uh it was all about basically
[1:36:41.980 --> 1:36:45.500]  how to screw up human sexuality and just how to make us
[1:36:45.500 --> 1:36:50.940]  alone with no family when you're 65 so they can euthanize you
[1:36:50.940 --> 1:36:54.460]  because see they know no matter how much drugs how much brainwashing somebody
[1:36:54.460 --> 1:36:56.380]  kills your kid somebody does something wrong to your
[1:36:56.380 --> 1:37:00.060]  family you might fight back and there's enough of us even when
[1:37:00.060 --> 1:37:04.380]  they got the robot armies ready they still might get defeated
[1:37:04.380 --> 1:37:07.180]  and again this is the end of humanity humans aren't going to go to space
[1:37:07.180 --> 1:37:09.980]  anymore military isn't forget just putting women in
[1:37:09.980 --> 1:37:13.260]  combat that's just to get rid of the military and break it down
[1:37:13.260 --> 1:37:19.420]  this is all the preparation they didn't do it until they wanted to sabotage it
[1:37:19.900 --> 1:37:24.300]  it is simply incredible isis to send members of
[1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:29.340]  feared all female police to europe disguised as tourists to attack holy
[1:37:29.340 --> 1:37:33.260]  sites and spark religious war against christians
[1:37:33.260 --> 1:37:36.300]  and they've been caught putting out new fake videos with the pentagon
[1:37:36.300 --> 1:37:40.140]  and again not our average troops but the criminal takeover artists that are in
[1:37:40.140 --> 1:37:44.460]  control that's all coming up the latest on
[1:37:44.460 --> 1:37:48.540]  iran the latest on russia huge video on info wars dot com us
[1:37:48.540 --> 1:37:51.660]  conspiring with russian oligarchs to overthrow putin says
[1:37:51.660 --> 1:37:56.620]  duma member and i love what's a great article but i love how
[1:37:56.620 --> 1:38:02.460]  there's this 25 minute interview with one of the top guys in the duma
[1:38:02.460 --> 1:38:07.100]  and people say is this true it's on record the state department trying to
[1:38:07.100 --> 1:38:10.060]  overthrow russia it's on record they overthrew ukraine
[1:38:10.060 --> 1:38:13.100]  it's on record they're trying to overthrow all these other countries
[1:38:13.100 --> 1:38:17.180]  that surround russia they don't even deny it
[1:38:17.180 --> 1:38:20.860]  and then even in russia the report is going oh yeah what's your proof
[1:38:20.860 --> 1:38:24.540]  because it's a young trendy and the guy keeps explaining you understand this is
[1:38:24.540 --> 1:38:28.140]  21st century war i can't pick up the phone and call the media most of its
[1:38:28.140 --> 1:38:31.580]  western run and let people know it's it's a war
[1:38:31.580 --> 1:38:36.060]  because we're designed to face tanks and soldiers an exact quote of mine
[1:38:36.060 --> 1:38:39.980]  this is a 21st century new war covert it's a round table
[1:38:39.980 --> 1:38:43.180]  british empire model where they buy off your top thousand people
[1:38:43.180 --> 1:38:46.540]  promise them seats in power when they take over or if they fail
[1:38:46.540 --> 1:38:50.060]  on the coup day they've got planes waiting to get them out
[1:38:50.060 --> 1:38:54.700]  and you watch this video it's everything and that's what's crazy the russians
[1:38:54.700 --> 1:38:57.100]  aren't perfect but at a primitive level it's still
[1:38:57.100 --> 1:39:02.620]  male driven uh basically almost prehistoric but super smart super
[1:39:02.620 --> 1:39:05.500]  high IQs yeah they're drunk yeah they fight a lot
[1:39:05.500 --> 1:39:10.060]  yeah i mean whatever the point is is that russians only wake up when they're
[1:39:10.060 --> 1:39:13.260]  under attack and so that's historically known
[1:39:13.260 --> 1:39:17.500]  and so they now have state-run tv going the plan is destroy our family
[1:39:17.500 --> 1:39:21.980]  here are the documents the plan is to you know put stuff in the vaccines they
[1:39:21.980 --> 1:39:24.460]  get it because they already went through it
[1:39:24.460 --> 1:39:27.820]  under communism and their population went down by more than 30 percent
[1:39:27.820 --> 1:39:31.500]  they've already been in the jaws of this forever they've still got corrupt kgb
[1:39:31.500 --> 1:39:34.700]  people they've still got socialism they've still got problems they've
[1:39:34.700 --> 1:39:38.940]  still got vestiges of it but they really get what's going on
[1:39:38.940 --> 1:39:43.580]  and when you get in the darkest levels of tyranny light is that much brighter
[1:39:43.580 --> 1:39:47.260]  and secretly most of the former kgb people at the highest levels
[1:39:47.260 --> 1:39:51.260]  vietnam or putin and others made pilgrimages to alexander schultz and
[1:39:51.260 --> 1:39:55.260]  eason and would basically in closed door meetings break down and cry
[1:39:55.260 --> 1:39:59.020]  and apologize for their betrayal of russia and finding out that oligarchs
[1:39:59.020 --> 1:40:01.740]  had financed the bring down of russia in 1917
[1:40:01.740 --> 1:40:06.780]  british and us banks the bolsheviks uh 40 000 folks from new york city and new
[1:40:06.780 --> 1:40:10.940]  jersey were brought in alone and the russians now get it
[1:40:10.940 --> 1:40:14.860]  that's why they declassified 10 years ago the kgb files that mccarthy was
[1:40:14.860 --> 1:40:18.140]  right so the truth is the globalist want to bring down russia
[1:40:18.140 --> 1:40:22.460]  because who would have ever thought they're scared to death i'm not lionizing
[1:40:22.460 --> 1:40:26.300]  they're corrupt they've got problems but they don't want to kill themselves
[1:40:26.300 --> 1:40:29.900]  they don't want to have robots take over they don't want to give up their
[1:40:29.900 --> 1:40:33.420]  humanity so they got state-run media going they do not want to have children
[1:40:33.420 --> 1:40:36.300]  they want you to be gay so you want to have children here's the document
[1:40:36.300 --> 1:40:40.620]  we are not against gay people but this is a plan i mean they're really
[1:40:40.620 --> 1:40:45.100]  they will ban mother and father that's now happening here
[1:40:45.100 --> 1:40:48.300]  the nanny state is to make you totally subservient
[1:40:48.300 --> 1:40:52.060]  to phase you out no dodgeball no tag no running
[1:40:52.060 --> 1:40:55.820]  no shaking hands no nothing
[1:40:58.460 --> 1:41:02.060]  and so basically when the telegraph admits russia collapsed
[1:41:02.060 --> 1:41:06.460]  much of that was real but their kgb operatives and training
[1:41:06.460 --> 1:41:13.260]  like a wind-up toy or an echo sleeper cells are still operating
[1:41:13.260 --> 1:41:17.980]  and let me prove this do you know who created the neocon movement that
[1:41:17.980 --> 1:41:20.620]  basically runs the obama administration today in the
[1:41:20.620 --> 1:41:24.300]  republican leadership on record look it up
[1:41:24.300 --> 1:41:28.860]  trotsky leon trotsky the number two guy in the soviet
[1:41:28.860 --> 1:41:32.540]  union under linen
[1:41:33.980 --> 1:41:38.540]  Stalin didn't like him trotsky fled with hundreds of his operatives to
[1:41:38.540 --> 1:41:43.100]  mexico where he was killed with a ice ice axe
[1:41:43.100 --> 1:41:47.900]  she's a chop up blocks of ice paid by stalin when they failed they all came to
[1:41:47.900 --> 1:41:51.660]  the us got rockefeller carnigy and ford funding because they just
[1:41:51.660 --> 1:41:55.260]  funded them 30 years before to go take over
[1:41:55.260 --> 1:42:00.140]  they weren't running to the us because it was where that's where they came from
[1:42:00.140 --> 1:42:03.980]  they originally came from russia and poland were sent back over to take over
[1:42:03.980 --> 1:42:08.540]  stalin kicks them out they come over here
[1:42:08.540 --> 1:42:15.900]  and now they are the republican party hard core trotsky ice hard core
[1:42:15.900 --> 1:42:19.900]  they give you the patriot act everything else i mean we're in deep
[1:42:19.900 --> 1:42:25.660]  trouble we are in deep deep deep deep deep
[1:42:25.660 --> 1:42:28.860]  trouble and i only wish stalin would have got
[1:42:28.860 --> 1:42:31.340]  all of them i gotta be quite honest trotsky these people
[1:42:31.340 --> 1:42:34.620]  i had some bold statement there but i gotta tell you stalin was horrible as
[1:42:34.620 --> 1:42:37.900]  hell as well i wish he did i mean it's a hitler all of them
[1:42:37.900 --> 1:42:40.860]  i don't want economies based on this the point is
[1:42:40.860 --> 1:42:44.540]  that we're in deep trouble the neocons went and took over harvard
[1:42:44.540 --> 1:42:48.380]  and went over took over the chicago business school this is all admitted
[1:42:48.380 --> 1:42:51.820]  ron paul gave a 45 minute speech called neocon
[1:42:51.820 --> 1:42:56.940]  back in like 2006 2007 go watch it where he talks about all this
[1:42:56.940 --> 1:43:03.340]  so you wonder why we're under this now the trotskyites have always wanted to
[1:43:03.340 --> 1:43:08.620]  destroy russia take the member of polish royalty
[1:43:08.620 --> 1:43:14.380]  known as the duke of the milk nobility that's his title
[1:43:14.620 --> 1:43:17.740]  it's a big to brzezinski
[1:43:18.220 --> 1:43:23.420]  absolutely hates the russians and his family had ties to the german
[1:43:23.420 --> 1:43:28.540]  backside of poland in world war two same story
[1:43:28.540 --> 1:43:32.220]  yet again as a big to brzezinski wants to destroy russia
[1:43:32.220 --> 1:43:36.060]  and look here's the deal folks the globalist hate america too
[1:43:36.060 --> 1:43:41.500]  they're shutting us down we should be working with russia in space exploration
[1:43:41.500 --> 1:43:46.060]  we should be working with everybody but no the globalists want to bring down
[1:43:46.060 --> 1:43:49.900]  any sovereign independent nation and yes the czars were corrupt
[1:43:49.900 --> 1:43:52.540]  yes they were decadent they were in their own world they were more removed
[1:43:52.540 --> 1:43:56.300]  than anything their their minions were corrupt and they were taken out and
[1:43:56.300 --> 1:44:00.220]  executed by their cousins the british royalty
[1:44:00.220 --> 1:44:04.940]  in fact the the czar was almost an identical twin
[1:44:04.940 --> 1:44:08.460]  to the king of england look it up look up the czar next to his brother the king
[1:44:08.460 --> 1:44:11.820]  of england you could not tell the difference between them
[1:44:11.820 --> 1:44:16.540]  they were so bred from the exact same german and transylvanian bloodlines
[1:44:16.540 --> 1:44:23.340]  no russian ending they were german royalty that had taken over all of europe
[1:44:23.340 --> 1:44:28.540]  there have been british royalty in england folks since the tutors
[1:44:28.540 --> 1:44:33.500]  and so by the way i'm
[1:44:33.500 --> 1:44:37.100]  distantly related to all that so you can say i'm as english as it gets
[1:44:37.100 --> 1:44:40.700]  this is disgusting look at those two you couldn't even tell the two
[1:44:40.700 --> 1:44:44.540]  apart this is what breeding is and they took them out
[1:44:44.540 --> 1:44:47.660]  king of england is there with the bigger hat and there's the russians are
[1:44:47.660 --> 1:44:53.580]  representing all right enough of that i'm ranting i'm going to stop right now
[1:44:53.660 --> 1:44:57.340]  i'm very angry i'm very upset i've not plugged anything for an hour and 44

[1:45:29.660 --> 1:45:33.980]  two months it is the strongest lowest priced hands
[1:45:33.980 --> 1:45:37.180]  down we went through the industry to the three of the biggest manufacturers we
[1:45:37.180 --> 1:45:40.780]  said we want something that has the most ingredients the most concentrated
[1:45:40.780 --> 1:45:44.220]  the cleanest triple tested totally organic
[1:45:44.220 --> 1:45:48.540]  at roughly half the price of the leading competitor
[1:45:48.540 --> 1:45:51.500]  men knew how important this was quite frankly women should be taking this
[1:45:51.500 --> 1:45:53.740]  because it just affects a whole bunch of clans
[1:45:53.740 --> 1:45:56.620]  this is one of the few products we have where even the u.s government and the
[1:45:56.620 --> 1:46:00.460]  FDA admits this is proven to help the prostate
[1:46:00.460 --> 1:46:03.820]  prostiguard is back at info wars life dot com

[1:46:22.220 --> 1:46:25.180]  it still looks like it'll be three weeks till we get more brain force in
[1:46:25.180 --> 1:46:28.780]  but of the 14 products we've got eight of them in now
[1:46:28.780 --> 1:46:35.260]  info wars life dot com or 888-253-3139 antony gucciardi i want to get your
[1:46:35.260 --> 1:46:38.220]  take on my whole rant right there about the state of the world greece Russia all
[1:46:38.220 --> 1:46:41.980]  of it but before we do that tell folks what we can say on record
[1:46:41.980 --> 1:46:47.420]  from science daily the rest of them uh from uh the mayo clinic about the
[1:46:47.420 --> 1:46:50.940]  ingredients that are in prostiguard tell folks what's in it
[1:46:50.940 --> 1:46:55.020]  you know the core message of natural health and of info wars life has always
[1:46:55.020 --> 1:46:59.420]  been to be not just life changing but to fight back against the numerous
[1:46:59.420 --> 1:47:03.020]  methods of attack that we sustain on a daily basis against our bodies
[1:47:03.020 --> 1:47:06.540]  and one of those key things is a hormonal attack that we've talked about
[1:47:06.540 --> 1:47:09.820]  but specifically i don't think people understand
[1:47:09.820 --> 1:47:13.980]  what bpa really is and every single thing that we do we're exposing
[1:47:13.980 --> 1:47:17.740]  ourselves to these toxic chemicals that we're finding time and time again
[1:47:17.740 --> 1:47:21.820]  are damaging things like our prostate so that's why we develop prostiguard
[1:47:21.820 --> 1:47:24.780]  as a way to fight back just like all the other products have a purpose to fight
[1:47:24.780 --> 1:47:28.700]  back numerous numerous attacks the prostate is being attacked on a
[1:47:28.700 --> 1:47:32.060]  daily basis and most people don't even realize it so i want to highlight this
[1:47:32.060 --> 1:47:35.980]  one article here from science daily says bpa linked to prostate cancer
[1:47:35.980 --> 1:47:40.780]  study shows and it goes on to say that not only is exposure to bpa just causing
[1:47:40.780 --> 1:47:43.740]  prostate cancer it can actually be used basically
[1:47:43.740 --> 1:47:48.140]  levels of bpa and men's urine could be a marker of prostate cancer so
[1:47:48.140 --> 1:47:51.820]  low levels could actually on statistically if you have low levels of bpa
[1:47:51.820 --> 1:47:54.460]  it's more likely that you're not going to develop prostate cancer if you have
[1:47:54.460 --> 1:47:56.620]  high levels it's more likely that you bottom line
[1:47:56.620 --> 1:48:00.620]  most of the microwavable liners have it most the bags you cook in the microwave
[1:48:00.620 --> 1:48:04.620]  have it you are literally getting mega dosages of an estrogen
[1:48:04.620 --> 1:48:06.940]  memoker it's beyond that too and again it's
[1:48:06.940 --> 1:48:09.660]  they had thousands of plastic formulation we're gonna skip the network break
[1:48:09.660 --> 1:48:12.620]  it's so important they had thousands of plastic formulas we've talked to the
[1:48:12.620 --> 1:48:16.860]  top chemist they chose this to put it in the
[1:48:16.860 --> 1:48:20.940]  food chain it's in the printer ink it's in everything to feminize men
[1:48:20.940 --> 1:48:25.260]  and to make women ultra feminine that's why they gain so much weight
[1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:28.620]  and then become the hyper female i can answer the feds question
[1:48:28.620 --> 1:48:32.700]  taxpayers spend 3.5 million to find out why lesbians are so fat
[1:48:32.700 --> 1:48:36.540]  conversely gay men end up being being very very skinny
[1:48:36.540 --> 1:48:40.460]  and it all ties into hormone imbalances in most cases
[1:48:40.460 --> 1:48:43.420]  that doesn't mean that some people don't naturally have a proclivity
[1:48:43.420 --> 1:48:47.340]  towards same sex i'm not judging anybody this is science we're talking about go
[1:48:47.340 --> 1:48:49.740]  ahead that's right and i mean we have the direct
[1:48:49.740 --> 1:48:55.660]  connection dr groups father was one of the individuals who worked to get bpa
[1:48:55.660 --> 1:48:58.540]  into the system without knowing what he did and that's why dr groups life
[1:48:58.540 --> 1:49:01.420]  mission has been to help people because unfortunately
[1:49:01.420 --> 1:49:06.060]  his lineage has been developing things for exxon and different plastics bpa
[1:49:06.060 --> 1:49:08.700]  contaminants his dad is one of the inventors on record you look up the
[1:49:08.700 --> 1:49:14.620]  patent for exxon before it was mobile uh for bpa that made billions of dollars
[1:49:14.620 --> 1:49:17.980]  and he was paid like nothing for it so anyway and he was going to go public
[1:49:17.980 --> 1:49:20.380]  route before he died yep that's exactly right it's a really
[1:49:20.380 --> 1:49:23.100]  really sad story got one of those two-week cancers
[1:49:23.100 --> 1:49:28.300]  yes then the fbi showed up just like tesla and then he died
[1:49:28.300 --> 1:49:31.820]  so this is the real deal stuff this is real deal and the fda looked into
[1:49:31.820 --> 1:49:34.860]  banning at bpa because we made such a big deal about it because activism does
[1:49:34.860 --> 1:49:38.460]  work that they have banned it in europe yep and they have banned it in canada for
[1:49:38.460 --> 1:49:41.580]  most baby formulas but in the f the fda looked at it here in the
[1:49:41.580 --> 1:49:43.980]  united states but they were lobbied so hard by this
[1:49:43.980 --> 1:49:47.180]  multi-billion dollar industry that makes money off of bpa they said you know
[1:49:47.180 --> 1:49:50.620]  what it's perfectly safe but that also goes into this
[1:49:50.620 --> 1:49:55.500]  how many of the listeners right now drink soda a daily serving of soda daily
[1:49:55.500 --> 1:49:58.380]  serving okay daily serving increases aggressive
[1:49:58.380 --> 1:50:03.820]  prostate cancer risk by 40 percent all right and that's not just because
[1:50:03.820 --> 1:50:08.220]  there's that's mainstream studies we wonder why we're all dying of cancer
[1:50:08.220 --> 1:50:13.820]  they admit the fertilizer they put on corn that they make corn syrup out of
[1:50:13.820 --> 1:50:18.620]  what was the washington post headline the headline i think was 90 percent of
[1:50:18.620 --> 1:50:21.580]  corn syrup has high levels of lead mercury that was the headline
[1:50:21.580 --> 1:50:26.140]  yep it's it's pretty much what it is it's washington yeah washington post
[1:50:26.140 --> 1:50:29.260]  high fructose corn syrup contains mercury pretty much all of it that's one
[1:50:29.260 --> 1:50:32.460]  of the headlines yeah so this obviously ties into that
[1:50:32.460 --> 1:50:35.900]  but also this is from the american journal of clinical nutrition
[1:50:35.900 --> 1:50:39.900]  and the reason why you're being racist against bpa i am being racist and this
[1:50:39.900 --> 1:50:43.420]  is just one serving per day imagine how many people are drinking more than that
[1:50:43.420 --> 1:50:46.220]  let's just talk about the rebel flag though not something giving us cancer on
[1:50:46.220 --> 1:50:50.060]  record dying horribly with tubes all in us with our children being chopped up
[1:50:50.060 --> 1:50:53.340]  pediatric cancer is up 10 000 percent Gardasil murdering people
[1:50:53.340 --> 1:50:55.900]  let's just let's just talk about the rebel flag today yeah it's a good
[1:50:55.900 --> 1:50:59.100]  distraction or we could talk about you know the 3.5 million spent to find out
[1:50:59.100 --> 1:51:02.540]  why lesbians are fat none of this you know just like you're talking earlier
[1:51:02.540 --> 1:51:05.020]  about the different groups of individuals running things and the
[1:51:05.020 --> 1:51:07.820]  different there are three times fatter on average
[1:51:07.820 --> 1:51:12.060]  right well because it is genetic they've been triggered genetically
[1:51:12.060 --> 1:51:15.180]  genetics loads the gun environment pulls the trigger
[1:51:15.180 --> 1:51:19.020]  i mean the pentagon admits they have a pheromone spray that will make men
[1:51:19.020 --> 1:51:22.700]  violently attracted to other men it's called the gay bomb we're bbc folks
[1:51:22.700 --> 1:51:25.980]  we're not joking about this british broadcasting company
[1:51:25.980 --> 1:51:31.100]  yes and also you think about it at the most base level
[1:51:31.100 --> 1:51:34.300]  anything scientific these days you're not allowed to talk about in the public
[1:51:34.300 --> 1:51:38.940]  like we're not allowed to talk about the bpa that actually makes animals turn
[1:51:38.940 --> 1:51:42.220]  gay that's a whole different story right because that's silly that's so stupid
[1:51:42.220 --> 1:51:44.940]  that's not real but it goes into this to the deadly
[1:51:44.940 --> 1:51:48.620]  pesticides that are in our food and water like moncentos herbicide which the
[1:51:48.620 --> 1:51:51.820]  world health organization recently admitted is causing cancer
[1:51:51.820 --> 1:51:55.340]  that's also giving you prostate cancer and how much how much
[1:51:55.340 --> 1:51:58.540]  roundup are we eating on a daily basis i mean it's in our water supply it's in
[1:51:58.540 --> 1:52:02.380]  every single food we eat pretty much that it's loaded inside the gmo's
[1:52:02.380 --> 1:52:06.620]  and top scientist now that i was told us by top banker i went research to say
[1:52:06.620 --> 1:52:09.340]  we will adapt to it so we automatically i don't care if the
[1:52:09.340 --> 1:52:11.820]  cigarette's going to kill me and as additives i'm going to smoke it
[1:52:11.820 --> 1:52:14.940]  or oh whatever i'm going to keep doing what i'm doing we're designed
[1:52:14.940 --> 1:52:19.820]  in our development to go through hell so we kind of like being attacked
[1:52:19.820 --> 1:52:22.700]  no we don't have to wait till we get the diagnosis and get the cancer
[1:52:22.700 --> 1:52:26.220]  we need to take the stuff out of our lives it's doing this we need to filter
[1:52:26.220 --> 1:52:28.860]  our water we need to tell folks what's in the
[1:52:28.860 --> 1:52:31.900]  prostate carcass it's not just the salt palm meadow that they admit does this
[1:52:31.900 --> 1:52:34.620]  tell them what else is in here and why this product's such a best seller right
[1:52:34.620 --> 1:52:37.180]  and we can't talk about the salt palm meadow a little bit because it's so
[1:52:37.180 --> 1:52:39.900]  powerful and it's one of those things where you know
[1:52:39.900 --> 1:52:42.380]  you're going to develop a prostate formula and you say well you got to put
[1:52:42.380 --> 1:52:46.460]  salt palm meadow in it but we didn't know at the time when we're developing this
[1:52:46.460 --> 1:52:52.620]  that lycopene is the new salt palm meadow it's really this pigment that is found
[1:52:52.620 --> 1:52:56.860]  in the liver in your blood in the prostate obviously and we don't
[1:52:56.860 --> 1:53:01.820]  entirely know how it works as a function of the body but
[1:53:01.820 --> 1:53:05.980]  the studies are pretty clear and we can't totally get into them on air but
[1:53:05.980 --> 1:53:09.500]  lycopene is extremely extremely powerful i can read you some documentation
[1:53:09.500 --> 1:53:13.100]  about it from the myoclinic but it is the new salt palm meadow and then the
[1:53:13.100 --> 1:53:16.540]  plant sterols in there as well are pretty much the real deal
[1:53:16.540 --> 1:53:21.820]  Alex is watching he's basically chugging prostagartist
[1:53:21.820 --> 1:53:25.180]  i talk about the benefits that's what it makes me want to do too sometimes
[1:53:25.180 --> 1:53:28.940]  when i talk about these products on air even though you know i'm
[1:53:28.940 --> 1:53:31.420]  taking them pretty much on a daily basis even though you're racist even though i'm
[1:53:31.420 --> 1:53:34.860]  a racist i'll talk about them so much that i will go back immediately after
[1:53:34.860 --> 1:53:38.060]  this and take a lot of them look it feels so good
[1:53:38.060 --> 1:53:41.820]  because between me and god and everybody else watching i don't do something i
[1:53:41.820 --> 1:53:44.380]  wouldn't want to do to myself that's why i've got such good luck
[1:53:44.380 --> 1:53:48.140]  um knock on wood i just praise god for everything
[1:53:48.140 --> 1:53:51.500]  the success the protection we've been given the discernment every time we
[1:53:51.500 --> 1:53:54.780]  have an enemy all their intel falls on our lap without asking
[1:53:54.780 --> 1:53:57.900]  i mean i mean i i've experienced the providence that george washington
[1:53:57.900 --> 1:54:02.700]  experienced i'm just so i'm just humbled and and and so we only go out and
[1:54:02.700 --> 1:54:06.940]  bring you products that's why the super hippies and the super
[1:54:06.940 --> 1:54:10.380]  health conscious people you go to third party sites and just read reviews of our
[1:54:10.380 --> 1:54:13.660]  stuff they go wow this is really affordable very
[1:54:13.660 --> 1:54:18.300]  competitively priced a very strong formula i can't believe that it's alex
[1:54:18.300 --> 1:54:22.300]  jones putting this out uh he's a right wing nut i mean even
[1:54:22.300 --> 1:54:25.500]  there are people that don't like me who are total
[1:54:25.500 --> 1:54:29.580]  snobs about their supplements are admitting that we put out absolute
[1:54:29.580 --> 1:54:33.340]  gold you know i think i'm one of those snobs about the supplements too so i
[1:54:33.340 --> 1:54:37.500]  like i like the designation of super hippie as well there are a lot of
[1:54:37.500 --> 1:54:40.220]  people super surprised i mean they talk to me on a daily basis they're like
[1:54:40.220 --> 1:54:43.260]  so alex jones is putting out this prostigate or the super male vitality
[1:54:43.260 --> 1:54:46.460]  this is amazing i can't believe this you know there's people there's a large
[1:54:46.460 --> 1:54:49.660]  group of people that go to info wars life and just cannot actually understand
[1:54:49.660 --> 1:54:52.060]  what's going on because they're saying well wait a minute these are the highest
[1:54:52.060 --> 1:54:53.900]  quality products these are higher quality products
[1:54:53.900 --> 1:54:58.060]  than some natural health websites out there it's because they're cheap
[1:54:58.060 --> 1:55:01.580]  we could make this bottle for a dollar including the bottle or we could put
[1:55:01.580 --> 1:55:05.820]  ten bucks in it and still make a profit and fun things i mean why not have
[1:55:05.820 --> 1:55:11.580]  the Ferrari of supplements for a ford ltd price
[1:55:11.580 --> 1:55:15.980]  i mean it's just called free market domination 360 win
[1:55:15.980 --> 1:55:19.180]  absolutely info wars life dot com want to thank you all
[1:55:19.180 --> 1:55:23.260]  for your support uh the new prostigate is backing in we only got a limited amount
[1:55:23.260 --> 1:55:26.380]  because we have to budget things uh who knows sometimes something sells out the
[1:55:26.380 --> 1:55:30.700]  first time it does at the next uh but we now now now where are we i know i've
[1:55:30.700 --> 1:55:34.300]  scrounged up the money to reorder everything so when is everything coming
[1:55:34.300 --> 1:55:36.300]  in we're working on it there's a lot of
[1:55:36.300 --> 1:55:39.500]  stuff that gets sold out because obviously we don't have massive funds to
[1:55:39.500 --> 1:55:43.020]  just dump into tons of products so we have to see see how they sell
[1:55:43.020 --> 1:55:45.580]  you know we have to have a waiting list that's why brain force you can sign up
[1:55:45.580 --> 1:55:48.860]  for the waiting list you can sign up for the waiting list on liver shield
[1:55:48.860 --> 1:55:52.540]  all these products that sold out we need to gauge the you know attention to it
[1:55:52.540 --> 1:55:54.460]  and the desire never she'll sold out in four days
[1:55:54.460 --> 1:55:58.220]  it did right for so four or five days three days okay
[1:55:58.220 --> 1:56:02.540]  um boy miscalculated on that one and then
[1:56:02.540 --> 1:56:05.900]  it comes down to high quality products so you know we like you said we could
[1:56:05.900 --> 1:56:09.340]  spend two dollars we could get tons of more brain force in the next day but
[1:56:09.340 --> 1:56:12.300]  instead it takes two to three months for every single batch to be done and we
[1:56:12.300 --> 1:56:14.540]  desired that a super high quality would demand it
[1:56:14.540 --> 1:56:18.060]  so we're not going to go ahead and say okay it sold out let's get the two dollar
[1:56:18.060 --> 1:56:21.020]  crap from china we're still going to stay with the high quality and again we only
[1:56:21.020 --> 1:56:26.220]  use grass certified fda approved and by that by
[1:56:26.220 --> 1:56:29.180]  after you approve like these are things certified as known as safe
[1:56:29.180 --> 1:56:32.780]  uh supplements right generally recognizes safe process by either
[1:56:32.780 --> 1:56:37.900]  nsf or gmp good manufacturing process they test it two times each ingredient
[1:56:37.900 --> 1:56:40.140]  that's what's so expensive we test it again
[1:56:40.140 --> 1:56:44.620]  neurotically knowing we have enemies that may get our products and spike it
[1:56:44.620 --> 1:56:47.740]  for a test so we have them in a sealed safe all
[1:56:47.740 --> 1:56:51.180]  certified outside lawyers coming in i mean you know we have enemies so we
[1:56:51.180 --> 1:56:54.780]  think our enemies helping us even make it better
[1:56:54.780 --> 1:56:57.820]  and we know our enemies are so upset they haven't been able to by the grace of
[1:56:57.820 --> 1:57:01.900]  god find anything in fact the labs keep freaking out saying you're even
[1:57:01.900 --> 1:57:05.420]  passing california standards on all your products
[1:57:05.420 --> 1:57:09.900]  at higher levels that's why so many products only have one ingredient you
[1:57:09.900 --> 1:57:12.220]  can get one that's clean but not 10 that are clean
[1:57:12.220 --> 1:57:16.220]  but labs are calling us saying we've never seen this before
[1:57:16.220 --> 1:57:19.660]  so this is how neurotic we are there's a reason that when you go online
[1:57:19.660 --> 1:57:21.580]  personally i've shot for some months all the time
[1:57:21.580 --> 1:57:25.420]  there's a reason why it will say does not ship to california
[1:57:25.420 --> 1:57:28.940]  is because sometimes we still have to put warnings in because the the laws are
[1:57:28.940 --> 1:57:31.980]  so ridiculous but if you cannot ship to california
[1:57:31.980 --> 1:57:35.340]  oftentimes it's because you don't want to deal with prop 65 or
[1:57:35.340 --> 1:57:38.860]  i believe it's 65 where the limits are so low but oftentimes it's because like
[1:57:38.860 --> 1:57:40.700]  you said they have to just pick one ingredient
[1:57:40.700 --> 1:57:44.140]  or else they can't hit the levels they are so many massive amounts of heavy
[1:57:44.140 --> 1:57:47.340]  heavy uh let's be clear the the lead levels are so high they don't care if
[1:57:47.340 --> 1:57:49.500]  it's raining in from china in the jet stream or whatever
[1:57:49.500 --> 1:57:53.020]  there's more lead in the air than the california standard
[1:57:53.020 --> 1:57:56.620]  right there's more arctic and an apple than the standard and is the difference
[1:57:56.620 --> 1:57:59.500]  but then they'll dump hundreds of chemicals under the name fluoride
[1:57:59.500 --> 1:58:03.420]  in your water at thousands of times what they admit is safe
[1:58:03.420 --> 1:58:06.300]  while they won't let you sell products that have any toxins in them
[1:58:06.300 --> 1:58:09.900]  that's so lawyers can get a product test it then sue you right and there's
[1:58:09.900 --> 1:58:13.180]  radium in the water supply and antibiotics and birth control but
[1:58:13.180 --> 1:58:16.620]  that's fine don't care about that as long as your supplements can't contain
[1:58:16.620 --> 1:58:20.700]  any organic based metals right because there are synthetic and organic metals
[1:58:20.700 --> 1:58:23.500]  if you're in the dirt and you're eating dirt you're going to have some quote
[1:58:23.500 --> 1:58:26.540]  unquote contaminants and some of them are actually good for you
[1:58:26.540 --> 1:58:29.580]  well that's what my dad even says is a chemistry goes well son it's almost like
[1:58:29.580 --> 1:58:32.860]  this hidden good it's so clean we need some traces all that i go whatever
[1:58:32.860 --> 1:58:36.860]  this is the cleanest stuff that we can find at the highest quality info wars
[1:58:36.860 --> 1:58:40.300]  live dot com third hour coming up i'm going directly to jason john

[2:01:01.980 --> 2:01:06.140]  i've been listening since around 08 i'm going to make three points in rapid
[2:01:06.140 --> 2:01:10.460]  fire succession that i'll go off air and listen to what you have to say about
[2:01:10.460 --> 2:01:15.820]  first of all uh in the vein of the confederate flag thing that has been
[2:01:15.820 --> 2:01:19.500]  addressed a lot but i would just want like to say i don't think slavery
[2:01:19.500 --> 2:01:25.100]  as you always say it's not 300 400 years ago it's actively happening because
[2:01:25.100 --> 2:01:29.580]  people are buying uh electronic devices that are made and
[2:01:29.580 --> 2:01:37.020]  essentially uh slave dungeons uh in many cases you know i apple corporation so
[2:01:37.020 --> 2:01:41.260]  oh and listen i'm a hypocrite there's almost it's hard to find goods
[2:01:41.260 --> 2:01:44.300]  that aren't made basically in slave-like environments
[2:01:44.300 --> 2:01:48.220]  germany makes out of work women they'll work at brothels
[2:01:48.220 --> 2:01:55.180]  that's slavery sir and you look at the corporate prison complex
[2:01:55.180 --> 2:01:59.820]  that employs prisoners at slave wages they have
[2:01:59.820 --> 2:02:03.660]  contracts with uh these multinational corporations
[2:02:03.660 --> 2:02:07.020]  and a lot of this if you try to find that information on it's very hard to get
[2:02:07.020 --> 2:02:10.060]  information because a lot of that information is sealed about
[2:02:10.060 --> 2:02:14.140]  what exactly they're doing but they're like good wages for those corporations
[2:02:14.140 --> 2:02:16.780]  around two to three dollars an hour in prison
[2:02:16.780 --> 2:02:20.380]  and the lower end is about 50 cents an hour and all these good old boys my
[2:02:20.380 --> 2:02:23.660]  whole life go they got hot tubs and cigarettes in prison
[2:02:23.660 --> 2:02:27.340]  i want the ac turned off i want them working
[2:02:27.340 --> 2:02:31.020]  nobody's got that in prison but white collar criminals that have like cable
[2:02:31.020 --> 2:02:35.180]  and stuff they are working for 25 cents to a dollar an hour
[2:02:35.180 --> 2:02:38.780]  displacing everybody else's jobs and then they go
[2:02:38.780 --> 2:02:42.140]  what are you against prisoners are you racist against prisoners
[2:02:42.140 --> 2:02:46.140]  no we shouldn't be competing against prisons a great example
[2:02:46.140 --> 2:02:49.500]  is the fiction movie but it's based on true stuff that happened the Shawshank
[2:02:49.500 --> 2:02:53.820]  Redemption where he's got the prisoners out building the highways for cheaper
[2:02:53.820 --> 2:02:58.220]  than the private companies can go ahead under cuts competitions point
[2:02:58.220 --> 2:03:01.980]  number two sir in the last 50 60 years you have
[2:03:01.980 --> 2:03:05.740]  institutions like the university of Kentucky refusing to even allow
[2:03:05.740 --> 2:03:10.060]  african-americans on their sports teams okay and today
[2:03:10.060 --> 2:03:13.740]  excuse me same minorities what was that well university
[2:03:13.740 --> 2:03:17.180]  Kentucky i mean do you remember when pat riley was a player there
[2:03:17.180 --> 2:03:21.580]  and they played that all black team and essentially only white people were allowed
[2:03:21.580 --> 2:03:25.340]  onto the basketball team and jackie robinson wasn't allowed to play for the
[2:03:25.340 --> 2:03:27.340]  L.A. oh i thought you were talking about currently yeah
[2:03:27.340 --> 2:03:31.100]  sure sure okay yeah go ahead no i'm talking about in the lifetime of
[2:03:31.100 --> 2:03:34.620]  people you know in the lifetime of your parents and my parents because we're
[2:03:34.620 --> 2:03:37.980]  about the same age but do people look back and now that wasn't
[2:03:37.980 --> 2:03:41.900]  300 years ago that was an odd lifetime but people continue
[2:03:41.900 --> 2:03:45.260]  to wear these logos and you know what
[2:03:45.260 --> 2:03:48.220]  that if you're gonna have that attitude about the confederate flag or
[2:03:48.220 --> 2:03:51.340]  anything for that matter then why not say hey
[2:03:51.340 --> 2:03:55.980]  you were a virulently organized a racist organization 50 years ago
[2:03:55.980 --> 2:03:59.740]  i'm not gonna wear your logo anymore because of that now
[2:03:59.740 --> 2:04:03.820]  do i think that's necessary no i don't but do i think it's a double standard
[2:04:03.820 --> 2:04:06.940]  sure yes i do it's just like buying an apple phone but
[2:04:06.940 --> 2:04:09.420]  there's a third point i'll make sir because i heard you brought this up on
[2:04:09.420 --> 2:04:13.580]  the show a couple days ago i had a good friend who sat next to a
[2:04:13.580 --> 2:04:18.540]  mexican high government official and just like you said the other day this guy
[2:04:18.540 --> 2:04:22.780]  he said he looked like a white guy and he said that he was talking about the
[2:04:22.780 --> 2:04:25.820]  native mexicans a lot of them who migrate here
[2:04:25.820 --> 2:04:29.020]  he said he had nothing but disdain and hatred
[2:04:29.020 --> 2:04:33.100]  for the most racist people that i've ever read about or seen
[2:04:33.100 --> 2:04:36.380]  is ultra rich mexicans a bunch of them live in austin now
[2:04:36.380 --> 2:04:40.300]  and a lot of them are really nice people except it's like being in east texas or
[2:04:40.300 --> 2:04:42.700]  something and you run into some racist guys and they start
[2:04:42.700 --> 2:04:46.780]  it's really uncomfortable and and and and you and they'll just say the most
[2:04:46.780 --> 2:04:51.180]  horrible things about about meso americans that have native blood
[2:04:51.180 --> 2:04:53.660]  and that's because i mean the spanish went down there and just started
[2:04:53.660 --> 2:04:58.940]  murdering everybody and it's still the spanish that run mexico
[2:04:58.940 --> 2:05:02.220]  hey did you hear about the new social media game that's sweeping the nation
[2:05:02.220 --> 2:05:05.820]  it's called go on people's private property and steal something no really
[2:05:05.820 --> 2:05:08.860]  there's actually a game where people are sharing videos of themselves going up
[2:05:08.860 --> 2:05:11.740]  and ripping down confederate flags here's the article from steve
[2:05:11.740 --> 2:05:15.020]  watson twitter campaign encouraging people to rip down confederate flags
[2:05:15.020 --> 2:05:18.300]  social media users have been warned the latest hashtag accompanying craze
[2:05:18.300 --> 2:05:21.100]  will end up with someone getting seriously hurt and provide the media with
[2:05:21.100 --> 2:05:24.140]  another angle to go on a seamlessly ending debate regarding the confederate
[2:05:24.140 --> 2:05:27.660]  flag videos from at a one loray and at nl
[2:05:27.660 --> 2:05:31.420]  libertas online show two men one going up to a house and the other going to a
[2:05:31.420 --> 2:05:34.300]  back of a truck to take down confederate flags of
[2:05:34.300 --> 2:05:37.180]  course it's the confederate flag that caused the trawston shooting oh no
[2:05:37.180 --> 2:05:40.220]  wait that was a deranged young man on psychotropic drugs but it's the
[2:05:40.220 --> 2:05:43.340]  confederate flag symbol that led to the dukes of hazards being pulled from tv
[2:05:43.340 --> 2:05:45.420]  land and even led to an offended flea market
[2:05:45.420 --> 2:05:48.940]  shopper calling 911 over confederate flag merchandise
[2:05:48.940 --> 2:05:52.060]  we went out to austin and asked people what they thought go to the video if the
[2:05:52.060 --> 2:05:55.180]  general lee is racist what about this on the alex jonce channel
[2:05:55.180 --> 2:05:58.620]  rob dew reporting for info wars dot com and info wars nightly news
[2:05:58.620 --> 2:06:02.060]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as

[2:06:05.820 --> 2:06:09.420]  info wars dot com because the companies i've been approached by
[2:06:09.420 --> 2:06:13.900]  were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be
[2:06:13.900 --> 2:06:17.580]  so i refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers

[2:08:23.340 --> 2:08:29.100]  of the hour twitter campaign encourages people to rip down confederate flags
[2:08:29.100 --> 2:08:33.500]  and it's got people running in the front yards back yards side yards
[2:08:33.500 --> 2:08:39.900]  cars put healing stickers off and again regardless what you think about it
[2:08:39.900 --> 2:08:45.740]  this shows the power of the media we're talking 10 to 15 black people being
[2:08:45.740 --> 2:08:48.540]  killed a week in chicago being shot by other blacks
[2:08:48.540 --> 2:08:52.220]  you know is there some flag we could pull down to blame that on
[2:08:52.220 --> 2:08:57.100]  and this is just all part of oh you're an empowered group you go and pull down
[2:08:57.100 --> 2:09:02.060]  a rebel flag that will fix your problems
[2:09:02.060 --> 2:09:05.340]  and what it's going to do is create division when we have so many serious
[2:09:05.340 --> 2:09:10.380]  problems to deal with you've got people calling the police on folks that
[2:09:10.380 --> 2:09:14.860]  are selling rebel flags at swap meets and flea markets
[2:09:14.860 --> 2:09:18.460]  and the police show up and go well
[2:09:19.100 --> 2:09:25.420]  you know uh it's on private property implying it's illegal
[2:09:25.420 --> 2:09:30.060]  and i've told you i said it before rush limbaugh before ferrican
[2:09:30.060 --> 2:09:34.940]  next it'll be banned the american flag and now the calls are happening
[2:09:34.940 --> 2:09:40.300]  even though american ideas helped end so much of what we call slavery across the
[2:09:40.300 --> 2:09:43.340]  world but i want to go to your phone calls right
[2:09:43.340 --> 2:09:45.900]  now i got two people that disagree so they go to the front of the line
[2:09:45.900 --> 2:09:49.180]  i'm gonna go to richard in illinois then tom in london
[2:09:49.180 --> 2:09:52.780]  and we're gonna go to john in texas walt bill and others
[2:09:52.780 --> 2:09:56.780]  richard in illinois you're on the air go ahead
[2:09:56.780 --> 2:10:01.740]  hey alec i'm a big fan of yours um i want to disagree about trump
[2:10:01.740 --> 2:10:08.780]  and it's only because um i don't think this guy takes orders from anybody
[2:10:08.780 --> 2:10:14.540]  i'm not saying he's perfect but um you mentioned yesterday he was a ringer
[2:10:14.540 --> 2:10:18.700]  i don't think he takes orders from anybody um i have my experience with him
[2:10:18.700 --> 2:10:23.980]  in chicago is uh i've watched as he's built this god awful building
[2:10:23.980 --> 2:10:27.580]  he put this god awful sign on it he sued everybody
[2:10:27.580 --> 2:10:32.220]  um to get this signed and he just doesn't take no for an answer
[2:10:32.220 --> 2:10:35.900]  so um anyways what i was hoping you would do
[2:10:35.900 --> 2:10:40.220]  is um if you think he's a ringer why don't you invite him on the show and
[2:10:40.220 --> 2:10:44.540]  ask him we have invited trump on the broadcast
[2:10:44.540 --> 2:10:48.780]  and nico go after him again tweet at him everybody tweeted trump and tell him
[2:10:48.780 --> 2:10:51.420]  come on the show and i've said that's my opinion
[2:10:51.420 --> 2:10:54.540]  and i've been told by jerome coursey who's had a lot of conversations with
[2:10:54.540 --> 2:11:00.860]  trump and others uh that he suspects that that's what
[2:11:00.860 --> 2:11:04.460]  he's doing and i respect dr coursey he's a really smart guy
[2:11:04.460 --> 2:11:08.780]  uh trump gives massive money to hillary clinton i can't imagine that you're a
[2:11:08.780 --> 2:11:12.540]  real conservative and then you give to her senatorial campaign
[2:11:12.540 --> 2:11:16.140]  um and what he's doing is gobbling up all the attention
[2:11:16.140 --> 2:11:22.140]  and then not properly defending his ideas uh the guy owns casinos the guy is
[2:11:22.140 --> 2:11:25.740]  tied in with some really shady characters uh after he did that whole
[2:11:25.740 --> 2:11:27.820]  birth certificate thing he suddenly got his
[2:11:27.820 --> 2:11:31.580]  is what was his his nbc contract renewed so
[2:11:31.580 --> 2:11:35.660]  that's my feeling on trump my gut has never been wrong
[2:11:35.660 --> 2:11:39.580]  maybe he'll have a change of heart maybe i'm wrong maybe maybe a blue moon has
[2:11:39.580 --> 2:11:42.860]  arrived uh but uh again there's a headline donald
[2:11:42.860 --> 2:11:46.460]  trump has spent years courting hillary clinton and other dibs
[2:11:46.460 --> 2:11:50.860]  and so that's where i stand i mean he's like a cartoon character people think
[2:11:50.860 --> 2:11:54.380]  he's the richest guy in america he's worth four billion dollars
[2:11:54.380 --> 2:11:57.660]  he's a front man in my view for some other more powerful people
[2:11:57.660 --> 2:12:03.980]  uh billa melinda gates are worth 78 billion on record warren buffett 73
[2:12:03.980 --> 2:12:07.660]  billion on record this year in forbes their real wealth is in the aggregate
[2:12:07.660 --> 2:12:13.500]  trillions uh donald trump uh shares a lot of great things and
[2:12:13.500 --> 2:12:18.540]  things i agree with um but he's shown by his actions
[2:12:18.540 --> 2:12:21.820]  that he's a pretty slimy guy and look i think people that own casinos are
[2:12:21.820 --> 2:12:25.340]  slimy um
[2:12:25.340 --> 2:12:28.860]  i i've been around it i've had a chance to
[2:12:28.860 --> 2:12:33.180]  be out to vegas to see some fights and to be behind the scenes
[2:12:33.180 --> 2:12:35.660]  and we know what's come out in the news about it
[2:12:35.660 --> 2:12:39.100]  and i i just i don't even feel good being close to it
[2:12:39.100 --> 2:12:42.140]  i don't i don't lecture people about gambling you want to do it go ahead you
[2:12:42.140 --> 2:12:45.420]  want to be a chump go ahead if you and your buddies want to gamble over a
[2:12:45.420 --> 2:12:48.380]  poker game that's completely different that's just making the game fun i get
[2:12:48.380 --> 2:12:51.580]  that so i have gamble playing poker in my life you know not not high stakes or
[2:12:51.580 --> 2:12:54.140]  anything but the gamblers i know instead of being
[2:12:54.140 --> 2:12:56.780]  competitive in life instead of going out on a limb in life
[2:12:56.780 --> 2:13:00.220]  they go out on a limb in just somebody else's rig game
[2:13:00.220 --> 2:13:03.500]  it's it's a fake paradigm to come into and be screwed
[2:13:03.500 --> 2:13:07.740]  and i i think chump's gamble uh for high stakes
[2:13:07.740 --> 2:13:11.820]  it ruins a lot of lives it's mentally ill that's my opinion
[2:13:11.820 --> 2:13:15.020]  uh and i think trump is a predator for being involved in it what do you say to
[2:13:15.020 --> 2:13:19.260]  that uh i somewhat agree with you i mean
[2:13:19.260 --> 2:13:23.180]  again my only experience with trump i've never watched his show i went to that
[2:13:23.180 --> 2:13:27.340]  um trump hotel in chicago and i had one drink and i'm telling you
[2:13:27.340 --> 2:13:32.140]  the employees over there were miserable they did not smile
[2:13:32.140 --> 2:13:35.660]  you could tell that they've um they were exhausted
[2:13:35.660 --> 2:13:42.060]  funny and exhausting but he is moving the overton window in a direction that
[2:13:42.060 --> 2:13:45.660]  as a libertarian as ron paul as a ram paul supporter
[2:13:45.660 --> 2:13:50.620]  i kind of support so it's gotta be to say
[2:13:50.620 --> 2:13:56.860]  he's all bad when he is moving the overton window now i might be naive
[2:13:56.860 --> 2:14:01.260]  i don't know are you wrong well generally you're not wrong i agree with a lot of
[2:14:01.260 --> 2:14:05.580]  what you say a matter of fact um best investment i ever made in my life was at
[2:14:05.580 --> 2:14:08.540]  taking tangerine that i have every morning
[2:14:08.540 --> 2:14:12.540]  but uh there's something there and i just i don't see him
[2:14:12.540 --> 2:14:16.700]  i see him greeting his own reality i i tell you um not to produce your show
[2:14:16.700 --> 2:14:19.980]  but the um doctor pitch that i can't pronounce his last
[2:14:19.980 --> 2:14:25.660]  lieutenant he might be able to give a really good
[2:14:25.660 --> 2:14:29.260]  psychological description of what trump is i mean he might be a sociopath i
[2:14:29.260 --> 2:14:33.740]  don't know but a patenic would know but um
[2:14:33.740 --> 2:14:38.540]  i just see him moving the overton window and i'm part of me says
[2:14:38.540 --> 2:14:42.060]  that's a good thing no i hear you richard let me move on to tom and london i
[2:14:42.060 --> 2:14:46.940]  can't really comment on your comments or i won't have time to get the calls but
[2:14:46.940 --> 2:14:52.700]  i can't comment too elaborately donald trump is involved with a bunch of cd
[2:14:52.700 --> 2:14:57.420]  people donald trump is uh people think the richest man in america
[2:14:57.420 --> 2:15:01.100]  he'd go out and ask folks they think he is he is a pop culture
[2:15:01.100 --> 2:15:06.380]  person who is involved in w w f and it's not like jesse
[2:15:06.380 --> 2:15:10.620]  ventura was involved and now he's serious trump uses the same tactics in
[2:15:10.620 --> 2:15:16.780]  reality and so yes to you who is awake
[2:15:16.780 --> 2:15:23.500]  trump sounds good but the media is using what he said and misrepresenting it
[2:15:23.500 --> 2:15:28.220]  to then discredit everyone else
[2:15:30.540 --> 2:15:38.140]  and so that's what's going on i mean i can take one look at donald trump
[2:15:38.140 --> 2:15:44.860]  and i i hear this voice say danger will robinson i take one look at ran paul
[2:15:44.860 --> 2:15:50.060]  and go that's the real deal but they might kill him
[2:15:50.060 --> 2:15:57.740]  and that's how it basically comes down in my view
[2:15:57.740 --> 2:16:03.180]  um they have to have a strong end to destroy
[2:16:03.180 --> 2:16:07.260]  so then they can say they discredited an idea i mean it's outrageous the criminal
[2:16:07.260 --> 2:16:11.260]  crime way of going on in latin america that's pouring into the united states
[2:16:11.260 --> 2:16:14.540]  i mean mexico is a failed state approaching hell
[2:16:14.540 --> 2:16:17.660]  except the small jurisdictions that are controlled tourist areas
[2:16:17.660 --> 2:16:22.700]  like cancun it's very sad it's a very beautiful country
[2:16:27.500 --> 2:16:31.500]  yep former owner of money night raw wwe hall of fame
[2:16:31.500 --> 2:16:36.300]  inductee i mean it's just clown behavior folks he works for the
[2:16:36.300 --> 2:16:41.900]  democrats in my view he sure gives them more money than republicans
[2:16:41.900 --> 2:16:48.940]  tom in london from albion you're on the air go ahead
[2:16:48.940 --> 2:16:53.660]  hi alec good to be speaking to you again welcome my friend go ahead
[2:16:53.660 --> 2:16:57.660]  there are two there are two issues that i just want
[2:16:57.660 --> 2:17:02.620]  briefly disagreeing here about today uh the first one is the story about
[2:17:02.620 --> 2:17:07.260]  german women being forced into prostitution
[2:17:07.260 --> 2:17:12.220]  now no german woman has ever been forced into prostitution in the way that you
[2:17:12.220 --> 2:17:18.700]  describe now let me explain this this story came about
[2:17:18.700 --> 2:17:24.300]  it was uh ten or eleven years ago yeah 2004
[2:17:24.300 --> 2:17:29.740]  it was a story in a magazine called tanze i think it's short for tanze
[2:17:29.740 --> 2:17:37.500]  and it was a speculative piece because there are two
[2:17:37.500 --> 2:17:42.780]  potentially opposing war a confluence of legal changes
[2:17:42.780 --> 2:17:46.780]  in germany the first one was legalization of bottles
[2:17:46.780 --> 2:17:50.140]  and then they were saying can they be forced and they found cases of it but
[2:17:50.140 --> 2:17:54.540]  let's let's just move past that okay you can argue whatever let's just say i'm
[2:17:54.540 --> 2:17:58.540]  wrong with the case of argument does prostitution massively increase as
[2:17:58.540 --> 2:18:01.980]  economies decline and in the united states and england
[2:18:01.980 --> 2:18:05.260]  are not record numbers of women going into prostitution
[2:18:05.260 --> 2:18:09.260]  driving down the price of prostitution
[2:18:10.300 --> 2:18:15.420]  prostitution is only increased absolutely and uh the now i think there are
[2:18:15.420 --> 2:18:20.700]  sort of apps where students do you know did roman emperors make make the
[2:18:20.700 --> 2:18:25.340]  gentry prostitute their wives to raise state funds
[2:18:25.340 --> 2:18:29.500]  just for the sake of your listeners and for you i just want briefly finish the
[2:18:29.500 --> 2:18:33.100]  point about that story because what happened out of the speculative piece
[2:18:33.100 --> 2:18:37.420]  it was saying what if someone was offered a job in a
[2:18:37.420 --> 2:18:41.580]  brothel then the other law would come in and force them to take it now the
[2:18:41.580 --> 2:18:45.180]  first thing is this was a speculation not based on any
[2:18:45.180 --> 2:18:49.500]  particular case the example whether the woman
[2:18:49.500 --> 2:18:54.940]  being offered an interview at a brothel for the role of a bartender
[2:18:54.940 --> 2:18:59.180]  it's illegal since 2009 to advertise brothel
[2:18:59.180 --> 2:19:06.220]  conditions in german job centers and under their law
[2:19:06.220 --> 2:19:09.980]  their constitutional when they go then when they legalize their prostitution
[2:19:09.980 --> 2:19:14.380]  it was absolutely illegal for anybody to be forced
[2:19:14.380 --> 2:19:18.540]  by coercion into prostitution well i know that's in the Geneva Convention as
[2:19:18.540 --> 2:19:22.300]  well the point is economic degradation forces this and this will be
[2:19:22.300 --> 2:19:26.940]  Greece's new cash crop and i appreciate your call we're out of
[2:19:26.940 --> 2:19:29.500]  time we did put the London Telegraph and other
[2:19:29.500 --> 2:19:33.020]  articles up there where they're saying it's real people this was going on but
[2:19:33.020 --> 2:19:36.540]  i understand you're saying there's conflicting laws
[2:19:36.540 --> 2:19:41.340]  the overall issue is as economies go down prostitution proliferates
[2:19:41.340 --> 2:19:47.340]  and your new economies are casinos prisons prostitutes and then there's no
[2:19:47.340 --> 2:19:50.620]  more families society unravels and we collapse
[2:19:50.620 --> 2:19:54.460]  into a hellhole and so that's where i was going i rest my case
[2:19:54.460 --> 2:19:59.420]  Walt bill john john stay with us we'll be back

[2:21:06.860 --> 2:21:09.740]  electronic pick pocket 10 years ago i created a way to protect
[2:21:09.740 --> 2:21:12.700]  my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking
[2:21:12.700 --> 2:21:15.100]  about issuing a national id card with a built-in
[2:21:15.100 --> 2:21:18.460]  radio chip called RFID i felt having to broadcast my personal
[2:21:18.460 --> 2:21:22.620]  information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that
[2:21:22.620 --> 2:21:27.020]  credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes
[2:21:27.020 --> 2:21:31.180]  would all soon incorporate RFID it was then i formed iD Stronghold to
[2:21:31.180 --> 2:21:34.460]  share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world

[2:24:43.820 --> 2:24:47.100]  very interesting very informative but let's just go to folks and go to the
[2:24:47.100 --> 2:24:49.420]  next person i'm going to hit some news coming up
[2:24:49.420 --> 2:24:53.900]  the next segment but then right back into the calls
[2:24:53.900 --> 2:24:57.980]  let's talk to walt in michigan he wants to talk about the vatican and the pope
[2:24:57.980 --> 2:25:01.580]  i don't think you can call him the pope when he's calling for world government
[2:25:01.580 --> 2:25:05.740]  carbon taxes and a scoriating capitalism he should be criticizing
[2:25:05.740 --> 2:25:09.500]  crony capitalism but i forgot he's part of that
[2:25:09.500 --> 2:25:14.780]  but i guess i'm ranting instead of letting walt talk walt go ahead
[2:25:14.780 --> 2:25:19.100]  well alex i've talked to you for an offer over 20 years and i want to bring up a
[2:25:19.100 --> 2:25:24.140]  quote uh that david night uh mentioned a quote from
[2:25:24.140 --> 2:25:28.060]  president john adam well john adam made another quote
[2:25:28.060 --> 2:25:31.260]  my history of the jesuit is not eloquently written
[2:25:31.260 --> 2:25:35.820]  but it is supported by unquestionable authorities and is very particular
[2:25:35.820 --> 2:25:39.820]  and very horrible there the jesuit orders restoration
[2:25:39.820 --> 2:25:43.580]  in 1814 by pope is the seventh is indeed a step
[2:25:43.580 --> 2:25:47.900]  towards darkness cruelty despotism and death
[2:25:47.900 --> 2:25:52.620]  i do not like the appearance of the jesuit if ever there was a body of men
[2:25:52.620 --> 2:25:55.980]  who merited eternal damnation on earth and in hell
[2:25:55.980 --> 2:26:00.540]  it is this society of ignatious filiola john adam
[2:26:00.540 --> 2:26:06.140]  1735 1826 second president of the united states and this was his
[2:26:06.140 --> 2:26:11.420]  letter to thomas jimson who also died on the same day that john adam did no i
[2:26:11.420 --> 2:26:17.100]  know they did board 1826 i know they did um that's what's amazing
[2:26:17.100 --> 2:26:21.420]  about it basically they were big enlightenment folks
[2:26:21.420 --> 2:26:24.940]  that were into human freedom and that whole movement had been
[2:26:24.940 --> 2:26:27.580]  against some of the excesses of the church
[2:26:27.580 --> 2:26:30.780]  and i'm not a catholic i'm a lot of catholics that have good fruits you know
[2:26:30.780 --> 2:26:33.340]  they're friends that are good people great people
[2:26:33.340 --> 2:26:37.420]  but i look at what the catholic church promotes they've clearly been blackmailed
[2:26:37.420 --> 2:26:40.940]  it's clearly been taken over by the jesuits it's in
[2:26:40.940 --> 2:26:45.260]  catholic law people can look it up that you're not supposed to have jesuits as a
[2:26:45.260 --> 2:26:47.500]  pope that's why you never had one till now
[2:26:47.500 --> 2:26:51.260]  they're supposedly the secret police basically of the catholic church
[2:26:51.260 --> 2:26:55.740]  the society of jesus to keep it pure well what's the greatest threat to a
[2:26:55.740 --> 2:26:58.540]  country or a religious country like
[2:26:58.540 --> 2:27:03.180]  etholicism is a military takeover and so
[2:27:03.180 --> 2:27:07.100]  basically the jesuits which was a military order founded by
[2:27:07.100 --> 2:27:10.860]  liola as you mentioned a general went from portugal
[2:27:10.860 --> 2:27:14.780]  he was also in spain and now they've taken over
[2:27:14.780 --> 2:27:17.740]  and they're saying world government pay your carbon taxes
[2:27:17.740 --> 2:27:21.340]  redistribute wealth but but but not the vaticans
[2:27:21.340 --> 2:27:26.700]  so that's why i am forced to absolutely criticize the vatican
[2:27:26.700 --> 2:27:29.660]  because i've seen it as infighting i just want to fight globalism
[2:27:29.660 --> 2:27:33.500]  world government but when unelected planetary government's being pushed
[2:27:33.500 --> 2:27:36.700]  on poor masses that are the main target of it
[2:27:36.700 --> 2:27:43.420]  by that snake in a papal gown it really makes me just go ahead and
[2:27:43.420 --> 2:27:48.700]  not pull any punches and again and i go with my gut and my spirit
[2:27:48.700 --> 2:27:52.540]  up until this point it would be destructive to just sit there
[2:27:52.540 --> 2:27:56.140]  but by the way i can follow what the pope's doing because he's big
[2:27:56.140 --> 2:28:00.700]  all these protestant groups are doing the exact same type of crap right now
[2:28:00.700 --> 2:28:05.100]  and it's disgusting and people need to shout it down so send me your clips
[2:28:05.100 --> 2:28:09.180]  it's like when pastor hagi who gives some pretty good speeches
[2:28:09.180 --> 2:28:13.820]  i've heard him give some great speeches on tv i've watched him
[2:28:13.820 --> 2:28:17.420]  he came out like six seven years ago and wrote a book and i played the clip here
[2:28:17.420 --> 2:28:22.140]  going christ was not the messiah but a rebel against the lord and the jewish
[2:28:22.140 --> 2:28:26.220]  people and he was dealt with read my new book
[2:28:26.220 --> 2:28:29.740]  where it describes that christ was truly not the messiah
[2:28:29.740 --> 2:28:36.220]  and and it's like and then i also have family that
[2:28:36.220 --> 2:28:40.860]  in san antonio that knows all about mr hagi i'm just going to leave it at that
[2:28:40.860 --> 2:28:44.620]  and i won't get into stuff just i just because later once i told my uncle
[2:28:44.620 --> 2:28:48.700]  about it now rest his soul it turned out that they
[2:28:48.700 --> 2:28:53.100]  lived before he was huge on the same street with him
[2:28:53.100 --> 2:28:58.540]  and they would babysit his son and the wife would come over the wife he
[2:28:58.540 --> 2:29:02.780]  divorced and um he's just a big fat hypocrite
[2:29:02.780 --> 2:29:07.900]  and and here's the deal i'm not up here judging anyone
[2:29:07.900 --> 2:29:13.020]  it's just that hagi's a little false prophet the popes a big one
[2:29:13.020 --> 2:29:16.700]  there's no doubting it christ was not the messiah
[2:29:16.700 --> 2:29:21.660]  but a rebel and a war against the jews and the coming messiah
[2:29:21.660 --> 2:29:25.180]  i mean that's a quote by the way i played it so many times when it first came
[2:29:25.180 --> 2:29:29.580]  out that guys look up hagi says christ not the messiah i bet it's on youtube
[2:29:29.580 --> 2:29:33.180]  and so i just got to say pastor hagi's a so-called protestant
[2:29:33.180 --> 2:29:36.300]  when really
[2:29:36.460 --> 2:29:39.420]  i mean with those type of statements i mean i would only expect that to come out
[2:29:39.420 --> 2:29:43.100]  of the mouth of the devil so i'm sorry he's not the false prophet
[2:29:43.100 --> 2:29:46.860]  john hagi is a devil a portly little devil with a fake
[2:29:46.860 --> 2:29:52.140]  reaching voice we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:52.140 --> 2:29:56.860]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:56.860 --> 2:30:01.180]  russian parliament member yugivny fedorov
[2:30:01.180 --> 2:30:04.300]  claims that russian oligarchs are in negotiations with top american
[2:30:04.300 --> 2:30:07.660]  corporations and the white house to foment an astroturf revolution
[2:30:07.660 --> 2:30:10.700]  that will lead to the ouster of president vladimir putin and the collapse
[2:30:10.700 --> 2:30:13.580]  of the russian federation within two years they're conducting a
[2:30:13.580 --> 2:30:17.020]  negotiation process with the russian elites for the extradition of putin
[2:30:17.020 --> 2:30:20.300]  we know the objective is the destruction of the russian federation
[2:30:20.300 --> 2:30:23.820]  after august through the winter i think by the drop of living standards they
[2:30:23.820 --> 2:30:26.620]  will be able to bring out several hundred thousand people into the streets
[2:30:26.620 --> 2:30:29.340]  simply because with the help of the government they will severely crash
[2:30:29.340 --> 2:30:32.460]  people's living standards and this will be especially felt after winter
[2:30:32.460 --> 2:30:36.540]  fedorov added that spring 2016 could be the time period in which the coup
[2:30:36.540 --> 2:30:39.980]  is initiated he also identified john f teff the united
[2:30:39.980 --> 2:30:42.940]  states ambassador to russia as being the figurehead behind the

[2:34:22.780 --> 2:34:25.100]  but
[2:34:26.620 --> 2:34:32.300]  we need to just realize that the globalist are making their moves
[2:34:32.300 --> 2:34:35.660]  right now on every front
[2:34:36.860 --> 2:34:43.180]  the globalists are showing us their their hand and if we just quietly
[2:34:43.180 --> 2:34:48.540]  submit to it go along with it katie bar the door there is no bottom to it
[2:34:48.540 --> 2:34:51.500]  and so that's why i'm just upping my rhetoric to the level of what they're
[2:34:51.500 --> 2:34:54.460]  doing as it becomes more and more naked as it
[2:34:54.460 --> 2:34:59.020]  becomes more and more obvious i want to get into the latest on al qaeda

[2:35:15.420 --> 2:35:18.700]  but before we do that let's go right to your phone calls bill in wisconsin
[2:35:18.700 --> 2:35:23.980]  thanks for holding her on the air yeah thanks alex for taking my call
[2:35:23.980 --> 2:35:29.020]  i listened to your report on friday concerning
[2:35:29.020 --> 2:35:35.180]  frances and coming out in favor of the new world order
[2:35:35.180 --> 2:35:39.260]  he also received the hammer and sickle crucifix
[2:35:39.260 --> 2:35:43.340]  from the communists at a bolivia but
[2:35:43.340 --> 2:35:46.620]  and i've spoken to you about this before
[2:35:46.620 --> 2:35:50.620]  this revolution in the church the catholic church
[2:35:50.620 --> 2:35:57.180]  and as a catholic i can talk about it did not begin with frances it began
[2:35:57.180 --> 2:36:03.340]  with vatican council too it began with john the 23rd
[2:36:03.340 --> 2:36:07.340]  he was okay i want you to speak to that and i'll give you a few minutes to do it
[2:36:07.340 --> 2:36:10.780]  but i mean all i know is this hope john paul the second
[2:36:10.780 --> 2:36:14.380]  supposedly got shot by the communist to help bring down the soviet union
[2:36:14.380 --> 2:36:19.020]  would never say things like this so i mean frances is just so bad
[2:36:19.020 --> 2:36:23.580]  it's like having fidel castrow as the pope i mean am i wrong
[2:36:24.780 --> 2:36:28.700]  did you see him in south america be awarded a hammer and sickle
[2:36:28.700 --> 2:36:36.220]  award by a president was anti-communist and uh they would not
[2:36:36.220 --> 2:36:41.580]  let him out of the country but they would let carol wojtyła who
[2:36:41.580 --> 2:36:46.540]  became john paul the second and he went to harvard
[2:36:46.540 --> 2:36:50.140]  okay and received an honorary doctorate
[2:36:50.140 --> 2:36:54.060]  he was a globalist in the true sense of the word
[2:36:54.060 --> 2:36:58.940]  he was a complete sellout at the vatican council too
[2:36:58.940 --> 2:37:04.380]  so it began with john the 23rd paul the sixth
[2:37:04.380 --> 2:37:10.140]  who wore the uh car uh effort of kaifus the high priest
[2:37:10.140 --> 2:37:16.940]  instead of a cross on his chest and it continued under wojtyła
[2:37:16.940 --> 2:37:20.780]  this is something that has been going on
[2:37:20.780 --> 2:37:27.020]  for at least a hundred years but openly since vatican council too
[2:37:27.020 --> 2:37:33.100]  i agree with you that uh you know we've got a antichrist
[2:37:33.100 --> 2:37:40.620]  in the sense of uh frances okay and he is definitely selling out the poor
[2:37:40.620 --> 2:37:47.980]  in in latin america but you know it it goes back earlier than this
[2:37:48.780 --> 2:37:53.340]  well i'm certainly aware that there have been a lot of power struggles but even
[2:37:53.340 --> 2:37:57.820]  even seen reported that pope frances surprised my hammer and sickle crucifix
[2:37:57.820 --> 2:38:03.420]  oh he's surprised by it uh while he was down in south america uh in bolivia
[2:38:03.420 --> 2:38:06.300]  with the president giving him a hammer and sickle with jesus
[2:38:06.300 --> 2:38:11.500]  nailed to the hammer i mean there's just no end to any of this
[2:38:11.500 --> 2:38:16.860]  let's talk about the jesuits what do you make of this being the first jesuit pope
[2:38:16.860 --> 2:38:21.900]  you know you keep bringing up uh canon law and my wife and i have a used
[2:38:21.900 --> 2:38:25.420]  catholic book business we've got thousands of books
[2:38:25.420 --> 2:38:29.260]  okay we've got canon law books i don't see it
[2:38:29.260 --> 2:38:32.620]  i don't see it so if you know i've had some
[2:38:32.620 --> 2:38:35.500]  previous experts on and i think i'm gonna try to get them on
[2:38:35.500 --> 2:38:40.380]  and i'm going from memory uh but but supposedly it was a big no no
[2:38:40.380 --> 2:38:43.340]  and they were barred from it because the catholic church a couple of popes
[2:38:43.340 --> 2:38:46.220]  slapped down the jesuits when they were trying to take over
[2:38:46.220 --> 2:38:49.420]  maybe that's been changed but but let me ask you this why has it never been a
[2:38:49.420 --> 2:38:51.740]  jesuit pope
[2:38:51.740 --> 2:38:56.300]  because their their job within the church was to
[2:38:56.300 --> 2:39:02.460]  uh you know minister to protestant populations if you will
[2:39:02.460 --> 2:39:05.740]  uh to try to bring them back into the church
[2:39:05.740 --> 2:39:11.180]  missionary work throughout the world uh you know that type of thing
[2:39:11.180 --> 2:39:17.580]  uh go back to a book that both you and i got started on none dare call it
[2:39:17.580 --> 2:39:22.460]  conspiracy by gary allen and in the front of the book
[2:39:22.460 --> 2:39:29.740]  they quote uh pedro arupe who was head of the jesuits at that time
[2:39:29.740 --> 2:39:35.980]  saying essentially what you and i and others are saying there is an elite
[2:39:35.980 --> 2:39:41.020]  there is a cabal there is and maybe he was saying this because he was
[2:39:41.020 --> 2:39:45.740]  part of it but i don't think so go back and look that up in none dare call it
[2:39:45.740 --> 2:39:49.500]  conspiracy you know i i think you know the
[2:39:49.500 --> 2:39:54.540]  jesuits have done some harm but they have also done some good
[2:39:54.540 --> 2:39:58.220]  from a catholic viewpoint and i know that won't be popular
[2:39:58.220 --> 2:40:02.780]  with a lot of your protestant listeners well i mean let's get past the catholic
[2:40:02.780 --> 2:40:07.660]  protestant fighting because that's only uses more vulcanization i know this
[2:40:07.660 --> 2:40:11.340]  the catholic church and catholics i've known have done a lot of good and stood
[2:40:11.340 --> 2:40:14.140]  up against a lot of tyranny and a lot of
[2:40:14.140 --> 2:40:16.780]  most people i knew fighting the new old order in the old days were
[2:40:16.780 --> 2:40:21.100]  older catholic people undoubtedly though there's this giant leftist arm to it
[2:40:21.100 --> 2:40:25.740]  liberation theology that is super nasty so i don't think we can debate
[2:40:25.740 --> 2:40:30.060]  that now the dominant mainline catholic leadership
[2:40:30.060 --> 2:40:35.180]  uh is super bad news because what does it say that they elected this guy
[2:40:35.180 --> 2:40:41.020]  when i mean he talks like linen i mean it's so hardcore
[2:40:41.020 --> 2:40:44.940]  to see a pope spouting pure communist ideology
[2:40:44.940 --> 2:40:50.220]  and stirring up people it's very dangerous very dangerous
[2:40:50.220 --> 2:40:53.740]  and uh it just shows the globalists are making their move
[2:40:53.740 --> 2:40:57.500]  so katie bar the door brother i appreciate your call i mean we are in
[2:40:57.500 --> 2:41:01.340]  trouble we are in big trouble when he called for
[2:41:01.340 --> 2:41:05.660]  world government a month ago it started every day excoriating capitalism and
[2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:10.860]  saying wealth redistributions the way to create living hell
[2:41:10.860 --> 2:41:14.780]  and we've got some rich guy sitting on top trillions of dollars
[2:41:14.780 --> 2:41:18.220]  and as supposedly the wealth inside the Vatican is just
[2:41:18.220 --> 2:41:21.660]  over the top nothing like it on earth this giant
[2:41:21.660 --> 2:41:27.020]  underground palace is just a vault at revolt of diamonds rubies gold
[2:41:27.020 --> 2:41:31.820]  artifacts loot it's just incredible history the secrets of it
[2:41:31.820 --> 2:41:35.580]  uh and the popes are bathing in huge gold bathtubs with
[2:41:35.580 --> 2:41:39.980]  sign of the zodiac carved in and in diamonds and emeralds and sapphires i
[2:41:39.980 --> 2:41:43.660]  mean you know what i'd start buying into your
[2:41:43.660 --> 2:41:47.260]  communism if you went and sold it all and actually distributed all the poor
[2:41:47.260 --> 2:41:50.060]  people or something
[2:41:50.220 --> 2:41:56.060]  what you really need to distribute is anti gambling anti tyranny garbage
[2:41:56.060 --> 2:41:59.500]  and and push pro family stuff but we're not seeing any of that
[2:41:59.500 --> 2:42:01.820]  because you could give the poor people all the money in the world they'd lose it
[2:42:01.820 --> 2:42:05.500]  in a week most of them because they go play the
[2:42:05.500 --> 2:42:08.940]  lottery and they go into debt to buy more than they can get
[2:42:08.940 --> 2:42:12.940]  you know there's a reason poor people are poor
[2:42:12.940 --> 2:42:17.100]  and previously you could build a ladder for folks that had the proclivity to get
[2:42:17.100 --> 2:42:20.780]  out of it to get out of it but that's all been destroyed now so don't
[2:42:20.780 --> 2:42:25.100]  worry the earth is sinking in to a very short dark age
[2:42:25.100 --> 2:42:27.660]  because the globalists want to set it up where you're totally dependent totally
[2:42:27.660 --> 2:42:31.820]  dumb under their control hey you want your welfare get sterilized
[2:42:31.820 --> 2:42:35.020]  want your welfare take these shots and you wonder why you're dying 10 years
[2:42:35.020 --> 2:42:38.780]  later and then the robot computer that runs the hospital says you don't get
[2:42:38.780 --> 2:42:41.260]  treatment you don't even get told the diagnostic you have
[2:42:41.260 --> 2:42:46.220]  cancer you get told go home and take these pills
[2:42:46.220 --> 2:42:50.300]  but i always love big masses of poor people
[2:42:50.300 --> 2:42:55.260]  the welfare crowd whatever not the working poor who i respect
[2:42:55.260 --> 2:42:58.860]  sitting there demanding
[2:42:59.980 --> 2:43:03.500]  that they be given something for free and warren buffett going you're right
[2:43:03.500 --> 2:43:06.860]  you deserve it and the pope going you're right you deserve some freebies and
[2:43:06.860 --> 2:43:11.020]  bill gates and the queen of england because they want to get rid of the
[2:43:11.020 --> 2:43:13.740]  middle clash they want to get rid of the renaissance
[2:43:13.740 --> 2:43:17.500]  they want to get rid of independent wealth they want to get rid of choice
[2:43:17.500 --> 2:43:20.300]  they want to get rid of different ideas they don't control because they know
[2:43:20.300 --> 2:43:23.500]  somebody that makes even 80 thousand dollars a year
[2:43:23.500 --> 2:43:25.900]  50 thousand dollars a year a million dollars a year
[2:43:25.900 --> 2:43:29.580]  five million dollars a year will be independent and they're worried about
[2:43:29.580 --> 2:43:32.460]  them that's why they have luncheons with the leadest and luncheons with
[2:43:32.460 --> 2:43:35.900]  billionaires and luncheons with congress people to get you there
[2:43:35.900 --> 2:43:39.340]  and they say we need you mr johnson we need you mr sanchez
[2:43:39.340 --> 2:43:44.540]  we need you mr chow we need you mr smith we need you
[2:43:44.540 --> 2:43:48.700]  mr dragoff or whatever to be part of this and to help us and they get good
[2:43:48.700 --> 2:43:52.140]  people that have made money and have businesses to join them and get
[2:43:52.140 --> 2:43:55.260]  directed by them believing they're helping the community when really they're
[2:43:55.260 --> 2:43:58.140]  just keeping tabs on you and watching you and then by
[2:43:58.140 --> 2:44:03.100]  society's control and peer pressure getting you to go along with it
[2:44:03.100 --> 2:44:06.620]  and the big moves here i mean they're making their move john in texas thanks
[2:44:06.620 --> 2:44:09.500]  for holding her on the air
[2:44:09.500 --> 2:44:14.460]  hi alex welcome one thing i want if i could talk about trump real quick
[2:44:14.460 --> 2:44:17.660]  all trump's going to do is pull to support away from ran paul
[2:44:17.660 --> 2:44:21.340]  right before the convention he'll drop out jeb gets nominated the conservatives
[2:44:21.340 --> 2:44:23.740]  stay home on election time and hillar gets elected
[2:44:23.740 --> 2:44:29.660]  that's it that's the game plan that's the game plan
[2:44:29.660 --> 2:44:33.500]  but see trump saying all these reasonable things the out of control left
[2:44:33.500 --> 2:44:36.060]  misrepresented it makes conservatives and libertarians
[2:44:36.060 --> 2:44:39.420]  come defending and then trump sits around with all his buddies laughing at
[2:44:39.420 --> 2:44:43.020]  us and notice mainstream media is saying his name thousands of times a day
[2:44:43.020 --> 2:44:48.220]  239 times a day on cnn they just force feed him to the public
[2:44:48.220 --> 2:44:52.060]  and uh that's just how the cookie crumbles
[2:44:52.060 --> 2:44:56.700]  on a confederate flag uh what i'm afraid is going to happen is when the global
[2:44:56.700 --> 2:45:00.300]  cell easy to politicians keep in on bringing the confederate flag down
[2:45:00.300 --> 2:45:03.580]  they'll figure hey just stage one more last massacre
[2:45:03.580 --> 2:45:06.460]  and we can bring down the second amendment we can ram a gun bill right
[2:45:06.460 --> 2:45:09.500]  through there well yeah they got smart how do we stage
[2:45:09.500 --> 2:45:12.220]  something i think it was probably stage looking at it all now the way they
[2:45:12.220 --> 2:45:15.340]  pulled back the way it was all done orchestrated
[2:45:15.340 --> 2:45:18.700]  on the on the amnesia drugs able to get the gun when he shouldn't have got it
[2:45:18.700 --> 2:45:23.900]  on the in the list by the fbi they were testing it well if just guns can't do it
[2:45:23.900 --> 2:45:27.740]  what if we tie it to an ideology and then make it about that
[2:45:27.740 --> 2:45:31.500]  absolutely they're going to stage massacres just as sure as the sun came
[2:45:31.500 --> 2:45:35.020]  up and blame it on the second amendment
[2:45:35.820 --> 2:45:41.580]  i appreciate your call god bless you shon in colorado you're on the air go ahead
[2:45:45.020 --> 2:45:50.300]  do do do do oh yeah yeah no i'm sorry i wanted to talk about the financial
[2:45:50.300 --> 2:45:54.460]  collapse and and i think it's very clear in america
[2:45:54.460 --> 2:45:57.740]  i really do i think all these things are coming to a head
[2:45:57.740 --> 2:46:01.500]  and i think the number one thing out of everything
[2:46:01.500 --> 2:46:05.020]  i think the number one thing is the dollar being devaluated
[2:46:05.020 --> 2:46:11.900]  and i think a financial collapse is almost certain and i think that is one of
[2:46:11.900 --> 2:46:15.980]  the most important problems we should deal with in our
[2:46:15.980 --> 2:46:20.540]  country well i agree with you and we're in a
[2:46:20.540 --> 2:46:23.820]  orchestrated collapse they're making all the preparations all the ministry of
[2:46:23.820 --> 2:46:27.020]  defense and defense department documents that we've shown and made films
[2:46:27.020 --> 2:46:30.220]  about admit it they're building super creepy giant million
[2:46:30.220 --> 2:46:33.340]  percent emergency centers where they'll quote reeducate us
[2:46:33.340 --> 2:46:36.620]  hillary's giving speeches about men need to go to fun camps
[2:46:36.620 --> 2:46:40.220]  everybody's like what a weird comment they mean we are being stalked
[2:46:40.220 --> 2:46:44.620]  by wolves and the general public's had it good so long
[2:46:44.620 --> 2:46:49.580]  that when the hammer drops they have no idea what's about to hit them
[2:46:49.580 --> 2:46:52.700]  wolves are starting to circle i mean they're starting to you know
[2:46:52.700 --> 2:46:56.700]  it's time for us to circle the wagons and and to bear down
[2:46:56.700 --> 2:46:59.580]  because well i agree i mean we should spend about a third of our time digging
[2:46:59.580 --> 2:47:03.180]  in getting ready we're trying to be self-sufficient but 70 percent
[2:47:03.180 --> 2:47:06.620]  affecting the future battle space of the info war that may get physical
[2:47:06.620 --> 2:47:10.300]  just out of defense necessity to try to just emergency
[2:47:10.300 --> 2:47:13.980]  whatever stunt you got to pull that's legal and lawful pull the stunts to
[2:47:13.980 --> 2:47:16.940]  warn the people pull the stunts to tell folks about

[2:47:24.620 --> 2:47:28.220]  to be able to fire up with mobile centers to warn the public
[2:47:28.220 --> 2:47:32.300]  i mean they are coming i mean you just look at hillary she is a naked
[2:47:32.300 --> 2:47:38.940]  power mad possessed goblin i mean heaven help us people say y'all i've

[2:48:00.460 --> 2:48:04.780]  and then defend myself if they come uh but god i just can't believe how real
[2:48:04.780 --> 2:48:09.180]  this is and how stupid people are how how caught in the trance they are they

[2:48:13.260 --> 2:48:18.620]  john you actually look at it it's amazing um
[2:48:18.620 --> 2:48:22.540]  this is all planned almost and hillary is just crazy
[2:48:22.540 --> 2:48:27.740]  just completely mentally ill yeah yeah she did the the lady the elite are
[2:48:27.740 --> 2:48:32.220]  crazy to put her in i mean they uh so many times in history elites try to put
[2:48:32.220 --> 2:48:36.060]  their front person in and then they take over i mean hillary clinton is so
[2:48:36.060 --> 2:48:39.820]  evil i wouldn't i wouldn't vote for her if
[2:48:39.820 --> 2:48:43.500]  she was the last lady on earth i mean i just wouldn't i wouldn't do it
[2:48:43.500 --> 2:48:46.460]  i'm not gonna hate women it's because you hate women it's not that she's a
[2:48:46.460 --> 2:48:49.260]  tyrant it has a string of dead people behind her and it
[2:48:49.260 --> 2:48:52.940]  takes money from dictators and it's totally corrupt and you know it has
[2:48:52.940 --> 2:48:55.820]  more girlfriends than bill although that's kind of cool it did
[2:48:55.820 --> 2:49:00.140]  you know it's just but her followers kind of like the gangster stuff they
[2:49:00.140 --> 2:49:04.700]  they want the lfa they want to bow to their queen of evil
[2:49:04.700 --> 2:49:10.460]  i appreciate your call tom in new york you're on the air go ahead
[2:49:10.460 --> 2:49:14.060]  alex good show as usual thank you brother uh
[2:49:14.060 --> 2:49:18.220]  uh what i'm what i'm about to say is that trump
[2:49:18.220 --> 2:49:22.060]  is not only a man but he's a nine billion dollar
[2:49:22.060 --> 2:49:25.980]  into god so his contributions to hillary
[2:49:25.980 --> 2:49:29.340]  make complete sense in that that's the price
[2:49:29.340 --> 2:49:32.940]  of doing business no you're right he all wants to operate in her jurisdiction
[2:49:32.940 --> 2:49:37.180]  you got to pay off the mafia but i mean uh donald trump owns casinos i just
[2:49:37.180 --> 2:49:41.980]  think that's very immoral okay well i'll tell you this
[2:49:41.980 --> 2:49:48.780]  if we don't stop illegal immigration it doesn't matter who's president
[2:49:48.780 --> 2:49:52.700]  we are flooded for all the reasons we know
[2:49:52.700 --> 2:49:55.740]  and for all the crimes we've just seen happen
[2:49:55.740 --> 2:49:59.500]  i mean it is it is the downfall of this nation
[2:49:59.500 --> 2:50:03.420]  a list listen listen listen i what trump's saying is true
[2:50:03.420 --> 2:50:07.500]  and and and rand paul says he will do something about it i agree
[2:50:07.500 --> 2:50:10.540]  rand paul should have been saying things like this
[2:50:10.540 --> 2:50:14.060]  he said some things but not hardcore enough he should be out there
[2:50:14.060 --> 2:50:18.060]  in trump's face saying hey we have a sensible way to do this
[2:50:18.060 --> 2:50:21.100]  and you're up here grandstanding so he would be the number one guy like he was
[2:50:21.100 --> 2:50:25.180]  three months ago and i agree with you that that that republicans need to get
[2:50:25.180 --> 2:50:29.820]  more aggressive yeah i mean if we don't we're gone
[2:50:29.820 --> 2:50:33.580]  we have no nation it's that simple it's true because they've used liberation
[2:50:33.580 --> 2:50:37.660]  theology in mexico for 60 years to make opposition to the pre
[2:50:37.660 --> 2:50:41.500]  and to the other parties communism and so we got a bunch of communists coming up
[2:50:41.500 --> 2:50:44.060]  here who mean well but are totally and then they got the
[2:50:44.060 --> 2:50:46.940]  pope manipulating them i mean it is a disaster zone

[2:54:14.060 --> 2:54:19.980]  it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:54:19.980 --> 2:54:28.460]  by the way they found
[2:54:29.740 --> 2:54:32.700]  one of the clips not the one i saw i saw hagi like
[2:54:32.700 --> 2:54:38.220]  eight nine years ago maybe ten years ago it was like 2003 four i'm sitting
[2:54:38.220 --> 2:54:41.100]  there one day watching television and i go oh it's
[2:54:41.100 --> 2:54:45.580]  pastor hagi he gives some interesting speeches
[2:54:45.580 --> 2:54:49.500]  let me watch him and i turn it on and he's up there going
[2:54:49.500 --> 2:54:52.620]  christ was not the messiah but a rebel against the jewish faith
[2:54:52.620 --> 2:54:57.100]  and had to be dealt with that he was defensive israel you will learn the
[2:54:57.100 --> 2:54:59.660]  real messiah will soon come and i was just like
[2:54:59.660 --> 2:55:03.980]  is this satan speaking i mean this is what the bible says the devil will say
[2:55:03.980 --> 2:55:07.180]  but they did find the little plug where he says something similar
[2:55:07.180 --> 2:55:12.060]  plugging the book in defensive israel so now if you don't support israel
[2:55:12.060 --> 2:55:15.340]  you don't support israel if you think jesus is the messiah
[2:55:15.340 --> 2:55:18.860]  and that's saying that everybody in israel doesn't think jesus is the messiah
[2:55:18.860 --> 2:55:23.820]  so that's just hagi becoming so enamored of
[2:55:23.820 --> 2:55:26.540]  whatever party he supports in israel that he then
[2:55:26.540 --> 2:55:31.260]  basically adopts judyism um and that's what a lot of christianities actually
[2:55:31.260 --> 2:55:34.780]  become i mean we are a judaean christian slash
[2:55:34.780 --> 2:55:38.540]  british common law culture so people say i don't want to hear
[2:55:38.540 --> 2:55:42.060]  people that hate israel say we're not judaeo christian yeah we are
[2:55:42.060 --> 2:55:45.340]  most of our law comes out of the ten commandments the old testament new
[2:55:45.340 --> 2:55:49.660]  testament uh but the point is is that there's a move by hagi and
[2:55:49.660 --> 2:55:53.020]  others even remove that out so i don't care what's the pope or hagi or
[2:55:53.020 --> 2:55:56.220]  whatever if something's diametrically opposed to the bible
[2:55:56.220 --> 2:56:01.100]  and a two-year-old can tell it is those people are no longer christians
[2:56:01.100 --> 2:56:05.260]  in my view they are excommunicated i don't care whether you call yourself a
[2:56:05.260 --> 2:56:08.780]  catholic uh or whether you call yourself a uh
[2:56:08.780 --> 2:56:12.780]  protestant you are not in the body of christ when you say christ is not the
[2:56:12.780 --> 2:56:15.900]  messiah doesn't take a smart guy to know that
[2:56:15.900 --> 2:56:19.260]  does it so they say they found one of the clips here it is
[2:56:19.260 --> 2:56:22.620]  defensive israel will shape christian theology
[2:56:22.620 --> 2:56:27.020]  his scripture proves that the jewish people as a whole did not reject jesus as
[2:56:27.020 --> 2:56:30.380]  messiah it will also prove that jesus did not come to
[2:56:30.380 --> 2:56:34.220]  earth to be the messiah it will prove that there was a calvary
[2:56:34.220 --> 2:56:39.260]  conspiracy between roam the high priest inherit to execute jesus as an
[2:56:39.260 --> 2:56:44.220]  insurrection is too dangerous to live since jesus refused by word indeed to
[2:56:44.220 --> 2:56:48.060]  claim to be the messiah how can the jews be blamed for rejecting
[2:56:48.060 --> 2:56:51.260]  what was never offered read it in this shocking expose
[2:56:51.260 --> 2:56:54.460]  yeah that's nothing compared to this actual sermon this latest book by
[2:56:54.460 --> 2:56:58.620]  pastor but but again they said are you the messiah and christ
[2:56:58.620 --> 2:57:01.900]  said i am and they and the high priest ripped his
[2:57:01.900 --> 2:57:06.540]  his gown off went ah i mean anybody that knows the bible
[2:57:06.540 --> 2:57:12.220]  are you the messiah i am he ah kill him i mean
[2:57:12.220 --> 2:57:17.100]  i mean the old red tail sticking out from behind hagi there
[2:57:17.100 --> 2:57:21.100]  we're gonna go to break and jam in a few people in overdrive genie
[2:57:21.100 --> 2:57:25.420]  frances and at least anthion about adam and chad sorry
[2:57:25.420 --> 2:57:28.780]  i've got a lot of calls i don't think i got like 20 something so that's better
[2:57:28.780 --> 2:57:33.580]  better than i thought i would briefly we don't i'm not judging hagi or the pope
[2:57:33.580 --> 2:57:36.700]  i'm just saying what they're saying is diametrically opposed to the bible and
[2:57:36.700 --> 2:57:40.940]  this is what churches have become is where i hear the most demonic
[2:57:40.940 --> 2:57:44.940]  preaching out there is from the pulpit of course if you're the devil want to
[2:57:44.940 --> 2:57:47.260]  take over where would you go i don't claim to be some goody

[3:01:00.140 --> 3:01:07.340]  all i hear is more proof more proof more proof that this is coming
[3:01:07.340 --> 3:01:13.500]  yes um the one person new you head on was joel scousen about strategic
[3:01:13.500 --> 3:01:19.260]  relocation i've done that um we have a lake cabin
[3:01:19.260 --> 3:01:23.900]  in north in the middle of north dakota well i wish i did
[3:01:23.900 --> 3:01:26.780]  it's about a hundred miles east of the bockin
[3:01:26.780 --> 3:01:30.700]  oilfield so we're really out there in the middle of north
[3:01:30.700 --> 3:01:35.580]  so i have not heard you know the globalist has this blueprint that they're
[3:01:35.580 --> 3:01:39.900]  following and they're going to carry through with it
[3:01:39.900 --> 3:01:47.260]  what i want to know how can we create a blueprint to survive well that's it i
[3:01:47.260 --> 3:01:50.140]  i mean i guess i've got to do it come up with a plan
[3:01:50.140 --> 3:01:54.220]  versus communication knowing who the enemy is what their plan is warning
[3:01:54.220 --> 3:01:56.220]  people that hey all this other stuff is noise
[3:01:56.220 --> 3:02:00.620]  here's their admissions and then a plan to try to stop it
[3:02:00.620 --> 3:02:04.940]  but also with a fallback plan b to protect ourselves
[3:02:04.940 --> 3:02:07.740]  and i'm so busy just trying to warn people and trying to run this little
[3:02:07.740 --> 3:02:12.140]  operation i am i i basically haven't really prepared myself
[3:02:12.140 --> 3:02:16.940]  that much i mean i'm i'm trying to it's it's
[3:02:16.940 --> 3:02:20.380]  overwhelming and i know why people are overwhelmed i just don't know what we do
[3:02:20.380 --> 3:02:23.500]  i just wish the general public would wake up out of their trance but
[3:02:23.500 --> 3:02:27.020]  even if you do they just have a coup over your government i mean
[3:02:27.020 --> 3:02:29.660]  believe me if they put rand paul in he's sort of trying to reverse this stuff
[3:02:29.660 --> 3:02:32.940]  they just kill him and i'm not saying give up hope
[3:02:32.940 --> 3:02:37.260]  it's just that we have to realize that this is life and death and
[3:02:37.260 --> 3:02:41.420]  people that are fighting this need to be supported and prayed for
[3:02:41.420 --> 3:02:45.260]  and i'm not asking for any type of special thanks i'm asking for people's
[3:02:45.260 --> 3:02:49.500]  prayers because it's very ominous to be in my
[3:02:49.500 --> 3:02:52.620]  position i will tell you it's not fun to mess with these
[3:02:52.620 --> 3:02:56.300]  people but at my gut level at a spiritual level i have to do it and
[3:02:56.300 --> 3:02:59.340]  that's why i get aggressive it's why i come off as arrogant
[3:02:59.340 --> 3:03:02.860]  and it's really just somebody that's just already resigned to it all and then i
[3:03:02.860 --> 3:03:05.020] 'm going to go follow this road no matter what
[3:03:05.020 --> 3:03:08.540]  and i get a little bit obnoxious whistling past the graveyard
[3:03:08.540 --> 3:03:12.380]  uh just because there's a man that's what you do at least that's how i cope
[3:03:12.380 --> 3:03:16.540]  is just make a big sick joke out of it all but uh at the same time my heart is
[3:03:16.540 --> 3:03:20.700]  very soft towards innocence and i just can't believe what how
[3:03:20.700 --> 3:03:24.780]  bad it already is for most the world and and and to know the judgment our
[3:03:24.780 --> 3:03:29.660]  country's coming into genie is is is very sickening
[3:03:29.660 --> 3:03:33.580]  yeah we already have homeland security here in rochester minnesota
[3:03:33.580 --> 3:03:39.180]  home of the male clinic um i've been scoped out by them a couple times oh
[3:03:39.180 --> 3:03:44.140]  yeah um they were all in flak and arm to the teeth
[3:03:44.140 --> 3:03:48.140]  but are we going to wait until it's too late
[3:03:48.140 --> 3:03:52.460]  to do something to figure out what we should be doing
[3:03:52.460 --> 3:03:58.460]  well here's the problem violence won't do anything because they're already set up
[3:03:58.460 --> 3:04:03.340]  for that they want their minions to get killed to make them martyrs to then
[3:04:03.340 --> 3:04:05.900]  demonize us they're going to kill their own minions
[3:04:05.900 --> 3:04:10.380]  and blame it on us so violence isn't the way to go offensively
[3:04:10.380 --> 3:04:13.420]  we have to create our own media we have to discredit the globalist
[3:04:13.420 --> 3:04:17.500]  which has happened and we have to then withdraw consent from them
[3:04:17.500 --> 3:04:21.420]  and stop complying with whatever we can do whatever god
[3:04:21.420 --> 3:04:24.780]  touches our heart to do i think i think that's the answer i think everybody
[3:04:24.780 --> 3:04:28.380]  should hit their knees every day for at least 10 minutes and just say god
[3:04:28.380 --> 3:04:31.100]  i'm open in my mind up you tell me what to do
[3:04:31.100 --> 3:04:34.220]  and and i'm telling you the answer to what you're supposed to do will come to
[3:04:34.220 --> 3:04:37.420]  you this is why you hit your knees you say hey
[3:04:37.420 --> 3:04:41.500]  i'm facing an evil intellect of satan i want to be good you're gonna have to
[3:04:41.500 --> 3:04:45.100]  take me over and that'll happen but god the
[3:04:45.100 --> 3:04:49.260]  the devil will take you over without free will you got to ask god in
[3:04:49.260 --> 3:04:52.700]  and you got to be part of god's plan and be a vessel that god wants to
[3:04:52.700 --> 3:04:56.220]  inhabit so i'd ask god to come into your heart i'm sure you've already done that
[3:04:56.220 --> 3:04:59.740]  but that's the answer
