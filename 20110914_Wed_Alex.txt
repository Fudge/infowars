[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:31.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.280 --> 00:39.320]  we're live it's Wednesday the 14th day of September 2011 we're gonna be live
[00:39.320 --> 00:44.960]  here for at least the next three hours then of course I'll be back tonight back
[00:44.960 --> 00:57.680]  this evening I'll be back this evening seven o'clock central standard time with
[00:57.680 --> 01:08.000]  info wars nightly news and I like doing two live shows or two tape shows sometimes
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.400]  a day because we can cover the news happening while we're live on radio and
[01:13.400 --> 01:18.920]  then of course that develops after the show into the evening and last night we
[01:18.920 --> 01:31.640]  covered just the amazing solar flares amongst other things that are being
[01:31.640 --> 01:39.040]  thrown off by the Sun and the fact that statistically things like that could be
[01:39.040 --> 01:44.360]  much more dangerous than even foreign armies because there are more than a
[01:44.360 --> 01:49.640]  thousand nuclear reactors on the face of the globe and the Pentagon and the
[01:49.640 --> 01:54.440]  Department of Energy the federal government admits that a large coronal
[01:54.440 --> 02:01.120]  mass ejection hitting the earth directly on would cause the shut down and melt
[02:01.120 --> 02:06.600]  down of all of those reactors this is the US government admitting this and we
[02:06.600 --> 02:10.000]  covered it last night it's now been archived it's archived shortly after the
[02:10.000 --> 02:21.080]  show streams at prisonplanet.tv all right I am attempting to be calm today but I
[02:21.080 --> 02:28.560]  don't feel like I'm really articulating properly the magnitude of the situation we
[02:28.560 --> 02:35.320]  face Europe is being systematically bankrupted
[02:35.320 --> 02:42.800]  systematically folded in to the private banking dictatorship
[02:43.120 --> 02:48.960]  countries tend to respond individuals tend to respond to an open army rolling
[02:48.960 --> 02:54.440]  in in different uniforms or different flags and to fight back but as long as
[02:54.440 --> 02:59.280]  it's done through a corporate type process with men in suits and you're
[02:59.280 --> 03:04.360]  told by the media that the fraudsters own and by the politicians that they've
[03:04.360 --> 03:08.840]  bought and paid for that it's legitimate most people just say oh that's a bunch
[03:08.840 --> 03:14.600]  of red tape and a bunch of bureaucracy I don't care but if we can get this
[03:14.600 --> 03:20.360]  simple fact across to people we have a chance to rebuild our civilization I've
[03:20.360 --> 03:26.600]  got economic numbers here that even if you take the feds cooked spun this
[03:26.600 --> 03:33.440]  information that tries to put lipstick on a pig and sell you that the economy
[03:33.440 --> 03:38.840]  isn't as bad as it really is even with their cooked numbers their phony bunk
[03:38.840 --> 03:51.000]  numbers pay rates in this country are now at 1996 levels housing has slid
[03:51.000 --> 03:57.160]  below 1996 levels we'll go over some of those numbers today and of course it's
[03:57.160 --> 04:00.280]  far worse than that
[04:02.240 --> 04:07.120]  Americans a lot of them are hard-working there's also a lot of lazy people but
[04:07.120 --> 04:13.040]  four hard-working Americans the statistics are clear working on average
[04:13.040 --> 04:20.360]  70 hours a week two to three jobs all to keep that illusion of middle class
[04:20.360 --> 04:25.680]  going it doesn't matter how hard you work on average it doesn't matter what
[04:25.680 --> 04:31.600]  you do the standard of living is going down the oxygen is being sucked out of
[04:31.600 --> 04:38.040]  the room we're gonna get into the economy we're gonna get into the police
[04:38.040 --> 04:43.040]  state the latest military developments also more youth killed in Mexico every
[04:43.040 --> 04:50.920]  year from violence than car wrecks that's a big deal that's all coming up
[04:50.920 --> 04:57.360]  today and of course we've got pharmacist Ben Fuchs on talking about the
[04:57.360 --> 05:04.040]  attacks on supplements hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the
[05:04.040 --> 05:09.040]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[05:09.040 --> 05:12.840]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[05:12.840 --> 05:17.520]  Americans at home turning members influence on our president in Congress
[05:17.520 --> 05:22.560]  and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[05:22.560 --> 05:27.600]  American citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies
[05:27.600 --> 05:32.640]  of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[05:32.640 --> 05:36.800]  and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their
[05:36.800 --> 05:40.640]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do
[05:40.640 --> 05:44.440]  we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[08:12.200 --> 08:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.720 --> 08:32.560]  Alex Jones okay my friends we are live thank you so much for joining us it is
[08:32.560 --> 08:40.920]  Wednesday the 14th day of September 2011 I want you to listen to me very very
[08:40.920 --> 08:47.800]  carefully for just a moment okay before I get into all the other news there is a
[08:47.800 --> 08:54.160]  new dawn of media a new age of media is here just like the age of the horse and
[08:54.160 --> 08:59.880]  buggy started going out by 1910 and was completely gone by the 1930s in the
[08:59.880 --> 09:08.440]  industrialized world the age of mainline dinosaur corporate whore media is
[09:08.440 --> 09:19.560]  over and the new landscape is being forged now because of this because of
[09:19.560 --> 09:28.800]  this you have got government and big corporate media coming in with the FCC
[09:28.800 --> 09:33.200]  and others trying to move to start restricting alternative media grassroots
[09:33.200 --> 09:38.280]  media TV radio you name it on the web I don't think that's going to be
[09:38.280 --> 09:43.160]  successful the people have had a taste of a million channels they're hungry for
[09:43.160 --> 09:50.400]  it so more and more the the playing field is being leveled it's still
[09:50.400 --> 09:56.400]  completely tilted to a great extent but more and more the balance is shifting to
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.200]  a real fight of ideas that's why the system's going right to authoritarianism
[10:01.200 --> 10:05.480]  right to arresting people who demonstrate for no reason right to trying to
[10:05.480 --> 10:10.080]  intimidate patriots and anti-globalist they don't care if you've got some
[10:10.080 --> 10:14.320]  leftist view or mainline right-wing view that's fine if you see outside the box
[10:14.320 --> 10:19.840]  and see the larger controlling system outside of it you are the enemy and I
[10:19.840 --> 10:22.600]  wasn't gonna start the show with this but this morning I read an article by
[10:22.600 --> 10:27.680]  Keith Oberman put out by Al Gore's outfit that's where Oberman works now
[10:27.680 --> 10:33.600]  over at the TV network on cable that Al Gore runs and I've looked up the numbers
[10:33.600 --> 10:37.160]  for it I mean you're talking about maybe a hundred thousand viewers on their top
[10:37.160 --> 10:43.640]  show I mean this radio show absolutely dwarfs it something like Rush Limbaugh
[10:43.640 --> 10:50.040]  probably a hundred times bigger than Al Gore's TV network because people see
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.400]  Rush Limbaugh as the alternative over the last 20 years but that's another
[10:54.400 --> 11:09.120]  level of control now today there was a article put out by Keith Oberman and Al
[11:09.120 --> 11:12.760]  Gore's outfit in fact it's in there on Tim's desk if you'll bring it to me I
[11:12.760 --> 11:15.880]  left it in there on Tim's desk in the back if you'll bring me that article
[11:15.880 --> 11:20.960]  somebody thank you it's on his desk Tim Frosier in the back and it was Keith
[11:20.960 --> 11:29.120]  Oberman saying aha Glenbeck is a failure we guess his bandwidth cost are a
[11:29.120 --> 11:39.960]  million dollars a month and Glenbeck's only making 27 million dollars off of his
[11:39.960 --> 11:47.360]  Glenbeck TV according to his 280,000 subscribers now I did some checking I
[11:47.360 --> 11:53.640]  went and put in Glenbeck TV versus Prison Planet TV and on average on an
[11:53.640 --> 11:59.200]  average day Prison Planet TV has more bandwidth more traffic more visitors
[11:59.200 --> 12:05.120]  than Glenbeck TV there's some big spikes when he goes to Israel or has a big
[12:05.120 --> 12:10.400]  national program so overall it's bigger about 20% it's got graphs right there I
[12:10.400 --> 12:15.420]  know what our bandwidth really cost $40,000 a month or so still a big
[12:15.420 --> 12:19.920]  nut to crack I know we have a fraction of the subscribers that Glenbeck does but
[12:19.920 --> 12:27.400]  I can go look and see wow right off the Alexa comm that we are using almost as
[12:27.400 --> 12:34.120]  much traffic and bandwidth as Glenbeck is so he's got a lot more members than
[12:34.120 --> 12:37.400]  we do but they're not really going over there mainly because they're an older
[12:37.400 --> 12:40.640]  audience that's why that's his problem is he's got a really old demographic but
[12:40.640 --> 12:45.600]  they will kind of pay a tithe to alternative media as they see it and
[12:45.600 --> 12:50.240]  supporting and Glenbeck's not perfect but he is alternative media compared to
[12:50.240 --> 13:02.480]  Al Gore and George Soros and the TV network that they run and so the reason
[13:02.480 --> 13:11.400]  I raised all of this is because here we are the true bonafide real grassroots
[13:11.400 --> 13:17.040]  media network system trying to get up on our legs and we need the support we
[13:17.040 --> 13:24.120]  need you to spread the word we need you to become prison planet TV subscribers
[13:24.120 --> 13:27.400]  we need you to buy subscriptions for friends and family we need you to
[13:27.400 --> 13:33.200]  download and save the news show and give it to friends and family especially the
[13:33.200 --> 13:40.360]  younger computer savvy people the war is on and info wars.com has an
[13:40.360 --> 13:45.040]  extremely diverse audience we have a giant audience the majority is below
[13:45.040 --> 13:50.920]  35 but we have extremely old people listening we have black white women men
[13:50.920 --> 13:56.320]  it's a very diverse we've got all the Google analytics numbers we've got
[13:56.320 --> 14:04.800]  ratings from radio stations it's it's this is a truly transcendent radio TV
[14:04.800 --> 14:11.680]  transmission because we're outside the box and if you go to Alexa info wars.com
[14:11.680 --> 14:17.440]  dwarfs Glenbeck's website so you can just go look at it dwarfs Glenbeck.com
[14:17.440 --> 14:23.880]  dwarfs MSNBC.com dwarfs Rush Limbaugh dwarfs at all there's only one thing an
[14:23.880 --> 14:29.400]  alternative media that you could say dwarfs info wars.com and that's Drudge
[14:29.400 --> 14:33.520]  and it's it's like we're foothills compared to the Himalayas but info wars
[14:33.520 --> 14:37.440]  is one operation then we have prison planet we have the YouTube channels we
[14:37.440 --> 14:43.200]  have our material that's copied everywhere we are truly a leading force in
[14:43.200 --> 14:49.800]  alternative media becoming the new mainstream and that is such an incredible
[14:49.800 --> 14:55.840]  responsibility so here's the kernel of information out of everything I've just
[14:55.840 --> 15:08.160]  said that's most important listen to me carefully Al Gore is racing to try to
[15:08.160 --> 15:14.960]  copy what we've done in the last decade Glenbeck is racing to copy the model
[15:14.960 --> 15:21.600]  that we didn't invent we just trailblazed because it was the only way we
[15:21.600 --> 15:25.600]  could get to people because we were blocked out from the big traditional
[15:25.600 --> 15:35.040]  arrogant CNN Fox New York Times type people and now that old arrogant system
[15:35.040 --> 15:39.640]  is realizing that they're becoming inconsequential like I was breaking some
[15:39.640 --> 15:44.400]  of the numbers down drudge drives more traffic on news than Facebook and Twitter
[15:44.400 --> 15:50.000]  combined it's about five times what the New York Times does and if we are now
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.720]  about a third as big as the drudge report just on our two websites combined
[15:54.720 --> 15:58.920]  you can combine those numbers and look at it we're bigger than the New York
[15:58.920 --> 16:04.080]  Times now when it comes to driving news I mean it's it's it's it's an
[16:04.080 --> 16:10.000]  emperors new clothes I mean the New York Times makes half a billion dollars a
[16:10.000 --> 16:18.120]  year this operation can't make five million dollars to fund itself
[16:18.120 --> 16:21.640]  Glenbeck with all of his operations can make seventy eighty million dollars a
[16:21.640 --> 16:29.200]  year and we conservatively have half of the audience he does web-wise totally
[16:29.200 --> 16:34.960]  dominate but you add in his radio and all the rest of it we are half as big on
[16:34.960 --> 16:41.720]  reaching people as Glenn Beck and we make a fraction of the money he does and
[16:41.720 --> 16:48.920]  again we need that money I need to hire the extra IT people I need I need to get
[16:48.920 --> 16:53.800]  the extra servers I need to get this platform the next level to so I can
[16:53.800 --> 16:58.760]  then hire a bunch of reporters and anchors and go 24 hours a day that's the
[16:58.760 --> 17:04.720]  plan and then get on these cable systems and everywhere and absolutely kick the
[17:04.720 --> 17:10.640]  behind end of the dying corporate media on their turf while we take over the web
[17:10.640 --> 17:14.000]  which we've already done here's an example Al Gore I was looking at his
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.800]  numbers cannot even get a hundred thousand viewers on his TV network even
[17:18.800 --> 17:26.960]  when he gets big sporting events no one will watch it so what is he doing he
[17:26.960 --> 17:37.840]  has a free 24-hour video feed running called 24 hours of climate reality where
[17:37.840 --> 17:42.920]  he says it is a hoax that the sea levels aren't rising and that polar bears
[17:42.920 --> 17:48.800]  can't swim and that we're all dying and we don't pay him money and I just now
[17:48.800 --> 17:53.000]  watch some of before I went live and we're gonna play a trailer of his
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.960]  propaganda here in a moment and it is all of our truth and information spun
[17:57.960 --> 18:01.600]  back at us see when we hit him with the fact that they're a bunch of hoaxers
[18:01.600 --> 18:06.040]  it's killing him Al Gore has admitted that he's being laughed at everywhere and
[18:06.040 --> 18:12.280]  you're a moron you think you're gonna come on the internet and and and and after
[18:12.280 --> 18:15.480]  all your years of arrogance and everybody's just gonna listen to you you
[18:15.480 --> 18:21.160]  big fat liar you didn't invent the internet you you con artist you got up

[18:36.080 --> 18:41.000]  1996 levels the federal government admits with inflation on top of it we've
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.840]  gone backwards the giant sucking sound that is globalism you didn't invent the
[18:45.840 --> 18:49.240]  internet you knew nafta and gat would kill us you're in there on your little

[23:05.360 --> 23:09.560]  under constant attack the globalist want to ban all supplements formulated
[23:09.560 --> 23:14.160]  after 1994 governments are hoarding raw materials affecting our ability to
[23:14.160 --> 23:18.440]  purchase these products at a reasonable price even organic foods are stripped of

[24:21.120 --> 24:35.800]  okay I'm gonna get into the news but the news is how the news is changing that's
[24:35.800 --> 24:41.720]  the issue here that there are tectonic changes taking place in the media
[24:41.720 --> 24:48.640]  landscape and now any body can set up a TV network anybody can set up a radio
[24:48.640 --> 24:53.360]  show and anybody can basically pick it up and have it delivered to them you've
[24:53.360 --> 24:57.640]  got a lot of people that still watch mainline television but more and more if
[24:57.640 --> 25:01.640]  you look at the statistics young people get almost no news or information or
[25:01.640 --> 25:06.160]  even entertainment from TV they are going to the internet and that full
[25:06.160 --> 25:13.520]  spectrum of ideas now in that world of a level playing field we dominate and
[25:13.520 --> 25:20.600]  destroy the competition because we don't play games we tell it like it is and
[25:20.600 --> 25:26.400]  what's happening is Al Gore is trying to take old mainline dumb-down people and
[25:26.400 --> 25:31.400]  their money and their energy and use it to finance an invasion of cyberspace
[25:31.400 --> 25:36.640]  with his hoaxes and lies and disinformation I mean the next he's
[25:36.640 --> 25:40.440]  gonna say Santa Claus or Jesus now he already says he invented the internet
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.880]  and you got to pay him money or carbon dioxide is going to kill you and my
[25:44.880 --> 25:54.680]  issue here is you talk about liars you talk about running a hoax I've got an
[25:54.680 --> 26:02.000]  article here put out by Keith Oberman how profitable is Glenn Beck's new web
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.320]  TV venture when Beck is taking his franchise of conservative commentary to
[26:06.320 --> 26:10.400]  the web streaming the first episode of his two-hour show exclusively to paying
[26:10.400 --> 26:15.240]  online subscribers the former Fox News star already has 230,000 subscribers to
[26:15.240 --> 26:19.120]  pay between five and ten dollars per month for access to his TV system
[26:19.120 --> 26:25.360]  according to the Wall Street Journal Glenn Beck television analyst Rich
[26:25.360 --> 26:29.880]  Greenwald estimates registration required that Beck could generate 27
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.160]  million and subscription revenue within the year and then it goes on with
[26:33.160 --> 26:38.760]  Oberman saying that he thinks that that that's how much it cost to do what he's
[26:38.760 --> 26:44.520]  doing and that is and that his bandwidth is is one million a month no way
[26:44.520 --> 26:49.800]  because if you go to alexa.com and put in Glenn Beck TV versus prison planet
[26:49.800 --> 26:54.960]  TV you'll notice that Glenn Beck TV on average is below us for viewers and
[26:54.960 --> 26:58.240]  traffic and when he has big special events it spikes way above us when he's
[26:58.240 --> 27:05.440]  got full-page ads on drudge and hundreds of other places so all of that is
[27:05.440 --> 27:15.440]  going on and what does Al Gore do Al Gore totals out and attempts to declare
[27:15.440 --> 27:20.160]  himself the arbiter of all truth and reality and of course Glenn Beck's
[27:20.160 --> 27:24.680]  doing that too you know the truth lives here tomorrow's a network today well
[27:24.680 --> 27:30.640]  we're tomorrow's network 10 years ago and the truth really does live here you
[27:30.640 --> 27:36.600]  notice all of our terms all of our ideas 1776 the spirit of 1776 you notice you
[27:36.600 --> 27:42.800]  hear it all imitated all what I've organically put forward is snatched by
[27:42.800 --> 27:51.360]  these people and that's the greatest form of admiration and compliment is to be
[27:51.360 --> 27:56.600]  imitated but I don't like Al Gore taking our ideas our systems exposing their
[27:56.600 --> 28:00.120]  hoaxes and turning it back around against us we're gonna go to break and
[28:00.120 --> 28:06.760]  come back and play that clip and go over it but here's the issue we already on a
[28:06.760 --> 28:13.280]  fair playing field in cyberspace have dominated but when it comes to traditional
[28:13.280 --> 28:19.400]  media we're not even on the radar screen and that's why it's so important if you
[28:19.400 --> 28:24.360]  are a viewer or if you are a listener and you get 95% of what we do for free to
[28:24.360 --> 28:30.920]  become a prison planet dot TV member it is a revolutionary vote for true hard
[28:30.920 --> 28:37.240]  core alternative media and so that at the ground floor of the establishment
[28:37.240 --> 28:43.040]  figuring out that the internet is the new wide-open TV channel right as they
[28:43.040 --> 28:46.640]  pump all their money and invade it with the fake left the fake right and
[28:46.640 --> 28:51.880]  everything in between it is more important than ever to get firmly
[28:51.880 --> 28:57.200]  behind info wars calm and prison planet calm it is a vote for liberty it is a
[28:57.200 --> 29:01.680]  vote for freedom it is a vote for alternative views it is a vote to see
[29:01.680 --> 29:07.040]  us grow and energize you've seen where we've come from and I have stepped up to
[29:07.040 --> 29:10.520]  the plate I have not one of the responsibility I knew I could have done
[29:10.520 --> 29:15.200]  this 10 years ago I talked about it and only the last few have I decided to try
[29:15.200 --> 29:21.720]  to generate the capital put in the hours and do it I don't like managing people I
[29:21.720 --> 29:24.440]  don't like having to be an editor and look over everybody's shoulder to make
[29:24.440 --> 29:29.120]  sure it's accurate to my view but I'm doing it I'm up here 10 o'clock many
[29:29.120 --> 29:33.600]  nights to really try to get in the face of the globalist and when you become a
[29:33.600 --> 29:39.480]  prison planet dot TV member you help put us on the field the helmet the football
[29:39.480 --> 29:45.360]  pads the whole nine yards you sponsor us on to the field I guarantee you two years

[30:00.640 --> 30:04.000]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[30:04.000 --> 30:07.960]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[30:07.960 --> 30:12.240]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[30:12.240 --> 30:16.520]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[30:16.520 --> 30:20.880]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[30:20.880 --> 30:24.920]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[30:24.920 --> 30:29.520]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[30:29.520 --> 30:33.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[30:33.640 --> 30:37.600]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[35:53.360 --> 35:57.400]  for that yet we're just beta testing right now the nightly news I'm doing and
[35:57.400 --> 36:01.640]  trying to get enough members to finance that to then go to the next level of
[36:01.640 --> 36:05.720]  codifying it putting in a satellite uplink the upload systems that most
[36:05.720 --> 36:09.480]  systems are going to get it from there's a lot of investment and yes we're going

[36:12.520 --> 36:15.520]  going to shoot videos and show you all the changes that have happened here and
[36:15.520 --> 36:21.360]  what we've done and where we're going the problem is it all rides on me and I've
[36:21.360 --> 36:24.960]  got to call the shots I've got to oversee the articles I've got to do
[36:24.960 --> 36:29.600]  everything I've hired some really great people but still I've got to act as
[36:29.600 --> 36:34.320]  chief cook bottle washer editor because you know everybody makes mistakes and
[36:34.320 --> 36:37.760]  has got to have somebody else look at it and who's as informed as they are or
[36:37.760 --> 36:41.840]  even more so but you can see what's happening and I'm not complaining this
[36:41.840 --> 36:46.080]  is a great honor it is wonderful but it's also exhausting to take on this
[36:46.080 --> 36:54.240]  marathon and so please be with us on this be be part of this with us you are
[36:54.240 --> 37:00.480]  not a spectator or a bystander in subscription media you are financing
[37:00.480 --> 37:07.560]  and building just like the Huffington Post went from nowhere to gigantic as
[37:07.560 --> 37:12.160]  big as the drudge report they did that off of donations and support and
[37:12.160 --> 37:15.600]  subscriptions from liberals and of course they betrayed them and her pro
[37:15.600 --> 37:21.240]  war and pro torture and handed it over to AOL and it's now falling apart we
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.720]  will never do that while I'm alive this operation will stay under Alex Jones
[37:26.720 --> 37:31.840]  because of my public will I've told my reporters and crew I wanted to continue
[37:31.840 --> 37:35.920]  on if I get imprisoned or killed with this exact information we're not selling
[37:35.920 --> 37:40.680]  it to anybody you couldn't anyways because it's about truth and information
[37:40.680 --> 37:45.720]  and no globalist will even want it and if they did we wouldn't sell it so again
[37:45.720 --> 37:54.160]  prisonplanet.tv I want to rival Glenn Beck who was the new world orders
[37:54.160 --> 37:58.920]  answered to us ten years ago eight years ago execs wanted to meet with me you
[37:58.920 --> 38:03.000]  know off record put on the journalist cap people say well tell us who they are
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.720]  if you ever give up a source in business and confidence or media you never get a
[38:06.720 --> 38:10.560]  source again but you know it's like this is off the record meeting one time well
[38:10.560 --> 38:14.520]  I'm not gonna even get into it and it's like look you'll have a TV show out of
[38:14.520 --> 38:18.600]  this with your radio show you'll have book deals and you're gonna be the next
[38:18.600 --> 38:22.600]  Rush Limbaugh and I said I know you tell all the girls that they're like no
[38:22.600 --> 38:27.360]  we're serious now do you want to and I was told this repeatedly I actually in
[38:27.360 --> 38:30.760]  three meetings by different people over the years it must be a script they
[38:30.760 --> 38:36.320]  follow do you want to be on a crusade that's gonna fail or do you want to be a
[38:36.320 --> 38:44.080]  star actually actually four times they said similar things because there was
[38:44.080 --> 38:47.520]  even a local radio exec one time it said something similar the more I think
[38:47.520 --> 38:52.240]  about it that I had meetings with and so I've been there I've been offered it all
[38:52.240 --> 38:57.440]  ladies and gentlemen I I I'm not professional I've had big New York
[38:57.440 --> 39:01.120]  outfits call and say we want to do big books with you and we want to have
[39:01.120 --> 39:04.960]  ghost writers and all this I don't even have time for it I don't even want the
[39:04.960 --> 39:08.080]  money from that you know what I could probably make tens of millions of
[39:08.080 --> 39:11.320]  dollars if I came out with best-selling books and I probably should do it then I
[39:11.320 --> 39:16.120]  could put that money back into my operation but I go and I say a best
[39:16.120 --> 39:20.920]  selling book sells 500,000 and I make a couple million dollars but I only reach
[39:20.920 --> 39:26.560]  500,000 people I can go do a video that takes me two hours and reach 500,000
[39:26.560 --> 39:32.000]  right now see getting into radio philosophy and new media philosophy
[39:32.000 --> 39:39.280]  that's the difference internet generally does not make money compared to an old
[39:39.280 --> 39:44.840]  media system because people expect it all for free and it's because I've been
[39:44.840 --> 39:52.320]  here it's all free because my goal is to get the word out I can reach I mean it's
[39:52.320 --> 39:55.840]  got to be like 10 million people a week on YouTube alone conservatively 10
[39:55.840 --> 40:00.400]  million people just on my channels and then there's thousands of other channels
[40:00.400 --> 40:05.760]  with people getting 10,000 20,000 500 views whatever the case is I haven't added
[40:05.760 --> 40:11.040]  up it's probably 20 million I've got single films I've made on one channel
[40:11.040 --> 40:17.800]  that have 10 million views 35 40 million for the Obama deception if you add them
[40:17.800 --> 40:25.080]  all up 35 40 million people reached on a film that cost $100,000 again I'm
[40:25.080 --> 40:30.200]  talking about the future of this show and what we're doing here we need to be
[40:30.200 --> 40:35.440]  strong we need to have wealth we need to be secure and be able to fight off
[40:35.440 --> 40:40.320]  fake lawsuits fight off anything we need to be a foundation against the new
[40:40.320 --> 40:46.200]  world order they've got their trillions we need millions you know raising
[40:46.200 --> 40:52.360]  $400,000 at a money bomb last year sounds like a big deal what is that six
[40:52.360 --> 40:58.840]  seven eight employees what is that the equipment for the studio you know how
[40:58.840 --> 41:05.520]  much this stuff cost the rent all of it again I'm not complaining here we've
[41:05.520 --> 41:11.040]  been incredibly successful it's not enough I want to go head-to-head with
[41:11.040 --> 41:17.800]  these people head-to-head and it's your prison planet dot TV memberships that
[41:17.800 --> 41:23.600]  are going to fund this mission and this operation I want everyone listening
[41:23.600 --> 41:27.440]  even if you're not a computer person to have your son your daughter your
[41:27.440 --> 41:31.840]  neighbor sign you up for prison planet dot TV and I want you to start
[41:31.840 --> 41:34.840]  downloading the shows and showing them to your friends and family you can blow
[41:34.840 --> 41:38.320]  them up and watch them on a big screen TV all the big new TVs coming out now
[41:38.320 --> 41:42.880]  our internet enabled I never used to watch TV anymore so I watched a movie now
[41:42.880 --> 41:47.120]  I can go home and watch YouTube on my television that's what I've been doing
[41:47.120 --> 41:54.760]  for a couple years now so we're having a giant effect and but but but again
[41:54.760 --> 41:59.720]  thousands of other ventures are now pouring into the internet because they
[41:59.720 --> 42:03.760]  finally figured out that's where the new audience is and so we need to be placed
[42:03.760 --> 42:07.880]  and and and upfront and dominant from the beginning and we've already done
[42:07.880 --> 42:13.280]  that without even trying I'm gonna get into some news here but this is so
[42:13.280 --> 42:16.200]  important because it deals with the media our culture where this world's
[42:16.200 --> 42:25.680]  going four years ago I had five six people working for me and I was in a
[42:25.680 --> 42:30.440]  little bitty office and I did not want to grow but I knew that I had the
[42:30.440 --> 42:33.720]  responsibility I did not want to hire more people I did not want to try to
[42:33.720 --> 42:39.160]  have to go out six years don't know five years ago I didn't even have a sales
[42:39.160 --> 42:44.920]  department I had giant websites and would just turn advertising down and just
[42:44.920 --> 42:49.760]  promote my own videos and books I didn't even want to deal with people trying to
[42:49.760 --> 42:57.040]  give me money you understand that I did not want the responsibility I wanted to
[42:57.040 --> 43:01.200]  talk about this stuff and hopefully see other people rise up and be leaders well
[43:01.200 --> 43:06.360]  you know what it didn't happen and so I said okay I'm gonna go ahead and try to
[43:06.360 --> 43:10.280]  make money and hire people and go to the next level and it's taken me three and
[43:10.280 --> 43:15.600]  a half years since we moved into this office to build it capitalize it get
[43:15.600 --> 43:19.880]  the space next door when it became available build the whole thing do the
[43:19.880 --> 43:26.400]  whole thing hire the people while doing everything else I was doing at the same
[43:26.400 --> 43:31.200]  time and now we're at that jump point we're at that critical point of trying
[43:31.200 --> 43:36.080]  to upgrade prison planet TV build new better systems add the nightly news the
[43:36.080 --> 43:40.360]  special reports interviewing reporters interviewing people that can be host
[43:40.360 --> 43:44.520]  moving forward but then I go in and meet with the money people here in my
[43:44.520 --> 43:50.080]  office and look at the money I've got and it's not there it's there to do the
[43:50.080 --> 43:56.120]  nightly news at a scale down level it is not there to expand it and to continue
[43:56.120 --> 44:01.720]  to make the documentaries and to do everything we need to do because when
[44:01.720 --> 44:05.400]  you build things sometimes certain areas don't work as well or you pay for
[44:05.400 --> 44:10.280]  something and it doesn't work out we need money to do pure research and
[44:10.280 --> 44:15.480]  prosecute this war against the globalist so again this is kind of I guess
[44:15.480 --> 44:20.760]  just a spontaneous little mini money bomb today where I'm asking you to become
[44:20.760 --> 44:26.040]  prison planet dot TV members if you've already got a membership go buy five
[44:26.040 --> 44:30.440]  more create simple username and passcodes and email them to your friends
[44:30.440 --> 44:34.720]  and family and say hey it's easy go to info wars news dot com log in and watch
[44:34.720 --> 44:40.280]  this tell me what you think and again we reach people it all leaks out on the
[44:40.280 --> 44:43.920]  web we post a lot of it on the YouTube channel members get it first and get the
[44:43.920 --> 44:47.600]  better archive in the book and all the videos and and the rats and all the
[44:47.600 --> 44:51.520]  material in one spot but a lot of it we do post to the YouTube because we're
[44:51.520 --> 44:55.200]  just here to reach people just like when we are able to we're going to put it
[44:55.200 --> 45:00.680]  after putting on TV systems but the but the spotty way we've been offered
[45:00.680 --> 45:06.600]  television is do you want to be on this European cable system you know it's free
[45:06.600 --> 45:09.680]  to air you just got to put it on the satellite you got to rent the time but
[45:09.680 --> 45:13.800]  then we'll we'll put it on our cable systems and it's not that expensive but
[45:13.800 --> 45:20.120]  I got to go buy this European satellite you'll buy a feed on it ten thousand
[45:20.120 --> 45:24.680]  dollars a month doesn't sound expensive it is though just so I can then send it
[45:24.680 --> 45:28.760]  to people then if I put ads on my news which I haven't done yet we run Ron Paul
[45:28.760 --> 45:32.400]  ads for free people are going to complain I mean yeah again I live in the real
[45:32.400 --> 45:36.400]  world Scott television channel okay couple hundred thousand viewers you know
[45:36.400 --> 45:39.680]  an hour they want it and people are like that's Rupert Murdoch you know it's
[45:39.680 --> 45:43.040]  people that lease the channel they're able to put me on of course those will be
[45:43.040 --> 45:46.840]  the Cointel pro attacks out of Cass Sunstein look Jones is our Rupert Murdoch
[45:46.840 --> 45:50.360]  satellite system or look this one in Europe's owned by a German company yes
[45:50.360 --> 45:54.280]  and somebody has leased a channel and then they can put you on their channels
[45:54.280 --> 46:02.000]  see how that works you sub leash or there's a person owns a cable system or
[46:02.000 --> 46:07.880]  owns owns channels on it in a town they want to put it on so I've got dozens of
[46:07.880 --> 46:12.240]  these contacts coming in of different groups and different organizations and
[46:12.240 --> 46:15.840]  so that's extremely expensive to do it that way that's why it's good to just
[46:15.840 --> 46:19.680]  be on one big thing like Fox or seeing it and then you go everywhere no the way
[46:19.680 --> 46:23.120]  to reach people though through the back door is you got to get on three or four
[46:23.120 --> 46:26.720]  different satellites like a televangelist basically and hit them here hit them
[46:26.720 --> 46:31.000]  there and then you start getting a big audience yes and then you fund yourself
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.880]  like the televangelist have done where you say buy this DVD about the new world
[46:35.880 --> 46:40.200]  order of this book I won't be selling prayer cloths by the way I sometimes I
[46:40.200 --> 46:43.800]  think Lindbeck has my phones tapped and I know from insiders I've lost those
[46:43.800 --> 46:50.280]  sources now to figure out that they weren't that they had five people watching
[46:50.280 --> 46:55.200]  everything we do not that I'm that smart but you know Beck copies everything we
[46:55.200 --> 47:02.280]  do which is great I mean I just at least I guess the word out and what was the
[47:02.280 --> 47:06.280]  point I was gonna make he I think I knew it before he announced it that he was
[47:06.280 --> 47:11.400]  moving to Dallas and he's got a place in between Dallas and Austin and the word
[47:11.400 --> 47:16.320]  is he was here in Austin looking at the houses to that'll freak him out I know
[47:16.320 --> 47:19.760]  that man I mean now he's even gonna move here I guess you notice it's not just
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.560]  rich guys don't get a bunch of houses because they want a bunch of houses they
[47:24.560 --> 47:28.960]  want to move around folks from fans and stalkers he's moved to some little town
[47:28.960 --> 47:34.040]  just north of here forget the name of it was in the news for you know the lie
[47:34.040 --> 47:37.760]  was out that he had a house in Dallas not true in fact I knew I knew that but
[47:37.760 --> 47:43.280]  side issue now Beck's moving down here and what's he gonna do I told people I
[47:43.280 --> 47:46.960]  said you watch he's gonna buy a Dallas TV station so he has that base of six seven
[47:46.960 --> 47:51.000]  million potential viewers and then he's gonna have a 24-hour thing built off the
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.640]  subscribers the subscribers are just a funding okay and then he's going to have
[47:57.640 --> 48:00.760]  shows with a bunch of other hosts and they're gonna fund their operation in
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.400]  satellite time with the books and videos and materials and sure enough that's
[48:05.400 --> 48:10.080]  now been announced well well it's been hinted at and you'll glenbeck said to
[48:10.080 --> 48:13.840]  others you know you think you defeated me kicking me off Fox you haven't seen
[48:13.840 --> 48:20.200]  anything yet his own imprint of books which will be a funder mechanism it'll
[48:20.200 --> 48:26.320]  reach millions of people his own network that's coming the problem is it's
[48:26.320 --> 48:32.680]  gonna be pro-war anti-ron Paul neocon with a little George Soros bashing so
[48:32.680 --> 48:38.800]  I mean it's better than Al Gore but it's like okay well there's three teaspoons
[48:38.800 --> 48:44.880]  of cyanide in this class and only a one teaspoon in this class no we need to do
[48:44.880 --> 48:53.080]  that that's always been my plan okay but I don't like asking for money I don't
[48:53.080 --> 48:59.320]  like having telephones every week like 700 Club okay that Pat Robertson did it
[48:59.320 --> 49:04.120]  ended up with like 40 something TV channels spewing out you know worldly
[49:04.120 --> 49:10.120]  globalist garbage I just want one channel that is subscriber funded via the
[49:10.120 --> 49:15.120]  web which is the future that then moves and funds itself to be on all the old
[49:15.120 --> 49:19.800]  media and terrestrial systems but that's all fading out in the next five years
[49:19.800 --> 49:23.360]  it's just still there's a big audience there that we need to reach out to who's
[49:23.360 --> 49:28.320]  never heard the truth that's what I want to do I want to be able to get up here
[49:28.320 --> 49:33.920]  and fight Al Gore and fight George Soros and fight the New World Order there's a
[49:33.920 --> 49:38.200]  reason you go to George Soros's websites and he spends about a third of his time
[49:38.200 --> 49:46.520]  attacking yours truly not just attacking Michelle Bachman or Ron Paul or or people
[49:46.520 --> 49:52.480]  like Glenn Beck because again as bad as Glenn Beck is he gets better and better
[49:52.480 --> 49:56.000]  and that's probably because he's competitive and he realizes the audience
[49:56.000 --> 50:02.280]  is in telling the truth but but so so bottom line we need to be here to make
[50:02.280 --> 50:08.400]  a real challenge to the system and I don't need to be held back by monetary
[50:08.400 --> 50:14.160]  restraints I mean ladies and gentlemen you know a cruise missile cost a couple
[50:14.160 --> 50:18.960]  million dollars and they're dropping thousands of them on people the
[50:18.960 --> 50:22.120]  government comes and takes your money and then uses it against you with
[50:22.120 --> 50:27.080]  propaganda and media and all the rest of this stuff we're asking you to become

[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:46.160]  dirty con artist oil company head who wants the power to shut down his
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.720]  competition and shut down coal it is true that coal the one true thing and
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:55.520]  this is has been put funding studies and things saying hey we only put out
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.240]  carbon dioxide and water vapor which is true now with the clean burning systems
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:04.640]  and we supply 51% of your power Obama said he wants to bankrupt us America
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.560]  China's building three of these a week we only are allowed to build about three
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:12.680]  a year you think this is a good idea but but oil is globalist completely
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:19.080]  consolidated they want to shut coal down Bill Clinton laid off with some giant
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:23.080]  amount of acreage and remember in the late 90s in Utah of clean burning coal
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:27.200]  and when that happened it doubled the stocks overnight of the Chinese company
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.000]  he was heavily invested in and that it donated to his campaign because they
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.120]  had the only other large deposit of the same clean burning coal the under
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:38.440]  regulations you had to have for your power plants see it's all that's how you
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.920]  increase wealth in a controlled system you shut down the competition and you
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.200]  shut down the power plants and then people have to pay you more for less
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:53.320]  and Al Gore makes an acute religion where that big obese lying piece of trash

[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:41.840]  lecturing high horse how any disaster any problem any dust storm any fire is
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:48.000]  the result any flood of human activity when carbon dioxide is much lower than
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.760]  it's ever been recorded in history that's what's crazy carbon dioxide and
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.160]  they've taken reasonable environmental steps of the last few decades and are
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.960]  playing on ignorance by listing carbon dioxide as a pollutant ladies and
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.960]  gentlemen that's what humans exhale it's a total dictatorship over all life on
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:11.120]  earth and a distraction from all the real environmental issues if you saw Al
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:16.160]  Gore on TV saying genetically modified organisms have been leaked in and then
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.240]  show 200 studies to infertility and all rodent species it's given to we need
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:25.160]  human clinical trials now but incidentally we see human fertility
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:30.360]  dropping as well but it takes more than 20 years for a generation to be shown
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:34.280]  to be infertile so by the time it happens will be several generations in
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:38.560]  this is a crisis I'd be well Al Gore's really woken up and if you're gonna do
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.880]  something about GMO maybe you're just misled about carbon and I'm all for new
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:47.280]  energies let's force ourselves onto something new the oil companies wrote to
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:54.360]  the stinking thing see they put out these false narratives and then people
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.200]  believe it I get these emails every day going man you're paid by the oil
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.360]  companies you piece of trash oh we're gonna get you and I'm also an email back
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:06.520]  please show me the proof I'm funded by sponsors and by subscribers to prison
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:10.640]  planet TV and people that buy the books the videos the ball caps the bumper
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.720]  stickers all the you know the water filters and info wars calm okay I don't
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:20.680]  have big fortune 500 or fortune 100 or fortune 1,000 sponsors but we tried to
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:27.080]  get them in fact I'm so busy I actually had a big sponsor actually approached
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:31.400]  me as a way not too big but an American made company the point is is that they
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.160]  throw it back in your court you're paid by big oil and then you go look at who
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:40.560]  funds the environmental power grab movement and it's Goldman Sachs JP Morgan
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.160]  go look who the biggest funder of the Nature Conservancy and all these land
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:49.520]  grab groups and carbon tax and and and these climate councils and it's Lord
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:54.040]  Rothschild and you find out they own the carbon exchange that you buy the
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:58.840]  carbons from and already Australia is buying tens of billions of dollars of
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:04.760]  these a year just here's money Rothschild can I can I now have flatulence for my
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:10.080]  cows and sheep folks you can pull up Australian news they have home police
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:13.120]  inspections now like they won't believe it time I just type in green police
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.520]  Australia and its big articles they have they have flatulence taxes now in
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.320]  Australia and Canada and I've had Canadians send me emails and goes
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.360]  where's that you didn't know they've added now a tax on the farmers when it
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:29.440]  goes into effect next year for the flatulence of cows they're now saying
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:35.240]  methane is unnatural there's always been creatures with the intestines that we
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:44.360]  have but fish past gas primates rodents marsupials whales and they get up and
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:51.360]  go methane is a toxic waste what there it is Australia's carbon police may
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:57.280]  enter premises that doesn't mean they may like to have the power it doesn't
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:02.280]  mean they may come it means they may they say they have that power and it just
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:08.880]  goes on I know that was all over the Australian news so they tax flatulence
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:15.760]  of animals they tax the carbon dioxide that comes out of plants and I've seen
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.360]  Bill Gates I've played the clip and I've seen the New York Times in fact
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:25.760]  Google New York Times a tax to breathe or paying to breathe and they said yeah
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.520]  see they take something absurd and go yeah we are gonna tax you to breathe it's
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.840]  for the earth and I've seen Bill Gates say in that little yuppie voice and then
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:43.360]  what we need to do is get this graph down to zero on carbon dioxide being
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.640]  output on the earth how are we gonna do that well humans are the main thing and
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:51.920]  we we put on individually this amount of the Ted conference what do you think
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:57.360]  about that everybody goes that he goes that's right we've got to get this down
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.480]  to zero and he puts his clicker and puts an image of a human up there and all
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.920]  the little anti-human control freaks you know that mommy never disciplined like
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:12.720]  get off on the thrill of we're gonna kill everybody Gates laughs with and then

[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:46.560]  to see what I am but by the way all that NPR voice all that Nellie stuff is
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:53.280]  Delphi technique training those people really don't talk like that you
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.320]  research these globalists they like to beat women and rape people and they go
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:00.320]  in and have sword fights with each other with their trainers and they're just
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:05.800]  savage I mean behind the scenes are just like yeah but they come out and go hi I'm
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:12.000]  a liberal I might be your friend and guess who else is told by his focus
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.800]  groups Glenn Beck didn't used to act like that he's tackled more like this
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:20.120]  Glenn Beck was taught to act like a Nellie have you noticed how they all
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.120]  act like little Nellies that's to make you think they're non-threatening and
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.560]  like them like they're a harmless little cute thing because they've done
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:31.560]  psychological warfare test and found that a lot of you are cowards or have
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:38.440]  been induced into cowardice and are threatened by real male activity that's
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:43.440]  why I'm telling you anybody that acts like a Nellie watch them in power what's
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:50.400]  a piano teacher that's a different thing watch them it's a cover okay I see all
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.640]  of you I see exactly what you are psychopathic criminals
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:02.480]  you see I think when I get up here and get angry at the New World Order and
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:08.640]  tell you how evil they are that you've got courage and want to defeat them people

[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:49.520]  begins it begins with not caring what happens to your individual person and

[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.520]  talking like Ron Paul about the New World Order and Gardasil brain damaging
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:23.640]  people and getting rid of the Federal Reserve even though they're operatives
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:27.760]  the very fact that they have to speak the truth shows the revolution of
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.840]  awakening that is happening and how close we are to getting our hands around
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:39.760]  the enemy's throats I'm not gonna hurt my voice anymore let's go to David Adam
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:49.280]  in Puerto Rico you're on the air come on oh hi how are you welcome sir hi the
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:53.920]  reason I'm calling is I I don't know if you have you've translated your movies
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:00.160]  or to Spanish your documentaries some of them have been you can just type in
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:05.920]  Obama deception Spanish in in-game Spanish and it's in Chinese German other
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:10.680]  things but but we don't have the money or the systems officially on DVDs and
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:17.560]  films in the future we are gonna try to pay them it's thousands and thousands to
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:21.200]  get them added to the DVD and then it makes them bigger data-wise and there
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.920]  can be more errors but we need to get to that point we need to come out with
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.800]  blu-ray everything else but yes sir it's a great idea I just tell people go
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.400]  ahead and translate them into whatever non-language you want put them on the
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:36.640]  web okay yeah I've always wondered about that I'll try to do that you put
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:43.800]  um Spanish Obama Obama's deception or yeah I know there's definitely Spanish
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.040]  translations guys to try it on air with Google in front of everybody it's
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.520]  watching prisonplanet.tv because we're simulcasting this of course on the
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:54.040]  web is TV for listeners that are wondering what I'm talking about just go
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:58.720]  to Google live on screen go to the go to the NSA tracking system the crystal
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:04.080]  ball system and type in to that two-way system where they're watching
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.600]  everything we're doing just remember that they're not giving you the data for
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.360]  nothing they're tracking everything you do building an algorithm and just type
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:13.880]  in the Spanish Obama deception there it is the Obama deception subtitle
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:17.600]  Spanish so I know it's they're all subtitled and I think I've seen one two
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.720]  or at least pieces of it that that fade us down and you know did a pretty good
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:27.880]  job of then speaking in Spanish over it. I you know I had a radio program near
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:32.240]  Puerto Rico I'm a chiropractor and I warned all my patients about you know
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:38.040]  vaccines and today I was speaking to some of my patients about hyperactivity
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:43.160]  disorder how that really created to dumb down the children and and you know I get
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:47.080]  movies out to my patients but I always want some of them don't know Spanish
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:52.080]  English I mean so it's something that I've always wanted to do and I'm glad
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:57.080]  you're doing it because Spanish-speaking people represent at least 500
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:02.560]  millions throughout the world and we gotta wake them up. Well done my friend

[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:17.960]  doesn't care. It's true we you know people drove out the marines from the
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:23.560]  Akaz Island but it's really far you know they they're still there but yeah I

[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.080]  and don't ever end up really getting into anything because I've already read

[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.400]  I don't even know what to say it's like look at how crazy our world's gotten

[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:14.240]  evil so long that now it's getting worse and worse by the minute and it's just

[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:25.720]  Al Gore all of them who go to these conferences and call for all this
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.000]  population reduction and then you wonder why they're spiking your food and water
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.040]  folks these these people are murdering control freaks I'll say it right here
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:38.800]  Al Gore's policies they've had big news articles admitting this would kill over a
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:42.760]  billion people in the next decade if they cut the carbon output of the third
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:47.080]  world where most people are on $2 a day or less there's already 15 million
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:51.240]  children starving to death a year and another 10 million adults guys search
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:56.640]  number how many people starve to death a year numbers and just show them they
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:03.600]  don't believe it 15 million people children 25 million total on average
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:09.240]  starve to death and when they got the Copenhagen Treaty two years ago it was
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:14.800]  right at double the taxes on the third world and a death sentence in the first
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:21.120]  decade of the plan conservatively one billion people dead you're like well I
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:25.080]  hear about that on the news no you don't
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:32.440]  there's a number from answers which you never know of the yahoo answers is right
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:36.840]  in that in that yahoo how many people starve to death each year worldwide it's
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:42.120]  around five million people per year from starvation not including malnutrition
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:49.400]  oh there's a little caveat yeah I don't know 15 million children from starvation
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:53.120]  malnutrition oh you didn't get enough so your bones were sticking out you look
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:58.680]  like a concentration camp victim but you didn't actually shrivel down to nothing
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:06.560]  and then die of that you died of that a cold you got but if you had malnutrition
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:13.640]  it's 15 million children 10 million adults 25 million type in number of deaths
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:18.120]  from starvation malnutrition combined I want to show folks that that number now
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:24.640]  you'd think that's a big deal to people yep there it is 15 million children die
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:29.600]  of hunger a year and it's got all down at the bottom of the bibliograph that's
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:36.280]  from UNICEF the UN's doing a good job and then they collect your money to feed
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.720]  the kids and actually use it to shoot them up with soft-kill weapons that's a
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:43.560]  great part about the globalist they don't just carry out the crimes it's full
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:49.840]  spectrum dominance they then are the response to their carnage it's a 21st
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:53.800]  century model of the Rothschild's funding both armies or all three armies
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:58.280]  all three or four factions depending on what war it was the perpetual
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:06.480]  continental European conflict that was eternal and was their economy I remember
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:13.480]  reading letters from cousins in English royalty to their French Norman cousins
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:19.080]  about I'm having uprisings can we start a war in the spring yes cousin this time
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:26.800]  I shall take back the land you took no we'll kill off some of the rabid
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:36.240]  that's so much fun I like that line from Braveheart not really historical but
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:39.880]  there have been cases of similar things and they're they're having the archers
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:44.560]  fire into the general battle and they say your highness and that will kill some
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:54.040]  of our troops but it will kill some of this as well open fire I mean what does
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:57.200]  Henry Kissinger say in State Department of Random 200 and the accompanying CIA
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.440]  documents that Maury Strong put into UN law he said we're gonna use food as a
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.680]  weapon you got to kill these people and a lot of yuppies and people kind of go
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.240]  well there aren't too many people I guess kill them listen you little moron
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:14.520]  you're having stuff put in your food and water too you're not part of the
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:18.480]  establishment and that goes for the cops and the military everybody else
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.440]  stop thinking you're on the winning team there's less than 6,000 globalists in
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:27.520]  their own words Rothkopf head of the Kissinger Group best-selling book super
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:34.520]  classy wrote three years ago now four years ago there's 6,000 gophers there's
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:41.800]  less than 20 families you aren't part of the team got that jack you're down here
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:46.760]  in the mud and the guts and the poison with the rest of us even if you think
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.280]  you're part of the power structure or even if Glenn Beck's gone to dinner and
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:55.160]  had Bill Gates pat him on the head yeah as soon as Glenn Becks are talking about
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:59.160]  eugenics he had the heavy guys want to have dinner with him every night and try
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:02.680]  to explain things to him then Glenn Beck comes up because I've been having big
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:06.440]  powerhouse meetings and they've been explaining things to me I bet they have
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:10.800]  been to get a memo about what to not give your kids
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:14.920]  look back you've had enough problems with with with children with all
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:19.040]  sorts of serious illnesses you might want to find out what did that it's kind
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:22.480]  of like when you said you were getting macular degeneration all the medical
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:26.240]  doctors I've talked to for years have linked it it's now in major studies to
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:30.960]  diet coke you admit you're a diet coke aspartame addict we put an article out
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:35.000]  Drudge picks it up and you make jokes about us and talk trash about us and
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:42.080]  then say that I'm having sex with with with with people just out of the blue
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:47.440]  bizarre insane gibbering behavior that's not the act of a godly person when I was
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.880]  trying to help you not lose your eyesight you fool so you could then warn
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:55.200]  other people and save tens of millions of folks but you know full well if you
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:59.480]  came out against aspartame and more than 10,000 products that you wouldn't be the
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:04.360]  golden boy anymore now I challenge you that it now as you launch your own quote
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:08.200]  independent system to come out against the aspartame to come out against the
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:13.800]  GMO and I will fully get behind you and support you if you come all the way
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:19.480]  because I don't care about who the big swinging mac daddy is in fact I would
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:23.400]  rather have five or six real people out there bigger and better than I am and I
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:28.280]  will tell you right now that I would hand this operation over to people here
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:31.360]  in my own group as long as they follow the code of liberty and freedom and I
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:35.160]  would step to the back and wouldn't even be on air I don't want to be on air I
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:39.360]  don't want to be doing this I don't like doing this but I got to do this and
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:46.200]  I'm sick of it I'm sick of all the Ron Paul counterfeits the Rick Perry's the
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:51.680]  Michelle Bachman's I've even had family taken in by her now it is never ending
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:55.920]  because she's so convincing with that deadpan stare and everything and she's
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:04.640]  pretty alright I said I'd take your calls it's just that I want to defeat the
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:11.680]  globalist that's what I'm out for that's what I want to do and I know they'll
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:16.040]  still be evil in the world but we've got a particularly virulent nasty system
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:24.200]  coming down on us right now and the big battles here the big acceleration of
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:28.080]  their program and our resistance this isn't slow motion anymore we're entering
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:31.440]  the time of great tumult do you understand there's no future for my
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:35.080]  children and your children if we don't turn this around do you understand that
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:40.360]  globalism is a curse on a country and all of the good is being removed that
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.680]  we're being conquered to financial fraud that's impossible to pay back because we
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:50.880]  don't owe it and it's a derivatives fraud we are in a trap that leads us one
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:58.080]  place destruction enslavement bondage humiliation you know I had a guy call me
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:00.280]  at the end of the show yesterday and he goes Alex you know I come from this
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:03.880]  prominent globalist family and they got sounded you're credible like a high-powered
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:09.960]  salesman and I heard a lot of truth in his voice and he's like you know I can
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:13.520]  triple companies and all this other stuff and you need to this is not an
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:19.400]  info war this is a scyop and you know I joined the globalist because I got tired
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:24.360]  of being harassed you didn't join anybody you decided to jump off a cliff
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:31.160]  like a delusional PCP head you don't join the New World Order you don't join
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:36.800]  with extermination you don't win for a time because you you buy some time for
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:40.440]  yourself and get to hang around in a rich neighborhood and feel powerful and
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:44.760]  get off on having a fancy car and pulling up at the at the at the country
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.480]  club and then the and the local rich guys come over and it's a self-admiration
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:54.480]  club while you're drinking drinks that have got deadly poison added to it you
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:59.320]  don't get a memo on that stuff and I know you don't you're not part of the
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:03.600]  New World Order you didn't you didn't decide to join it start winning you
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:10.480]  decided to give up and so I'm not in a scyop here I'm not using things that are
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.720]  simple or easy or just slogans it's what comes out of my gut what comes out of my
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:19.000]  veritas what comes out of my research I'm not trying to make it easy I'm not
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.240]  trying to make it palatable I'm not trying to sell people I'm throwing the
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:28.560]  gauntlet down spilling my guts and saying this is what it is this is what
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:32.640]  it's about and I don't care what happens to me or my family to try to save
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:38.040]  humanity I'm trying to literally put it all on the table all in all the chips
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:45.440]  this is it what are you gonna do about it you that's always the line from people
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:48.000]  in the establishment people that are in the lower rooms of it or think they're
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.320]  part of it is oh well you've got to compromise and get in and and and win
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:58.800]  and use their systems against them no no it's easy to sit back and say Alice
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:01.320]  could do this better Alice could do that better and there is a lot of stuff I
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:07.640]  could do better but you can't argue with success from nothing I wasn't picked up
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:12.280]  by Claire channel and then given national TV shows and given everything on a
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:20.600]  silver platter I started at zero zero zero and said no to the deals said no
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:26.720]  to being elevated to the mountain can you imagine the devil to Christ saying
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:30.800]  look at the world look at all the kingdoms up there on the mountaintop
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.600]  you know in this vision you could have it all it's like a joke oh I could have
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:40.240]  it all all the problems all the infighting all the wealth and people
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:46.120]  hating you for the wealth and all the the the the the bobbles and the crud and
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:53.640]  and the and the I mean it's a joke and the devil offers us all that and I'll
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:56.960]  tell you when you actually get things because you need them to be strong and
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:00.680]  protect yourself and also fight the globalist they're a hassle they're a
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:05.780]  trouble they're a responsibility it is not some that's the big con game is that
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:10.400]  is that we're gonna sell out and get something great we're gonna sell out and
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:17.400]  get something wonderful and the globalists know that most good people
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:23.040]  actually don't want to sell out and won't sell out so they organize the
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:27.000]  people that will sell out to be their enforcers but then they seek to cut off
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.840]  resources to everybody because people won't sell out for gleaming palaces
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:37.120]  good average normal meek people but a lot of them will sell out to put food on
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:43.120]  the baby's table and that's why the globalists work around the clock to shut
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:46.760]  off economies and only have big globalist corporations that you work
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:51.600]  for who can condition you and change your culture and turn you into a borg turn
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:56.960]  you into one of them a empty biological android who's used up and thrown away
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:01.520]  who's implanted with viruses that trigger at certain hormone flux levels at
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:07.160]  in life to get rid of you right as you're about to get your social security I am
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:11.800]  not a biological android I am not an animal I am a human being and my
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:18.840]  intellect burns burns with a reflection of God's glory and creativity as each
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:23.720]  and every one of you out there does as well but you won't know about that
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:28.440]  creativity you won't know about that strength and that power until you open
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:32.040]  the door the globalists teach you from birth that you're trash that you're
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:37.520]  garbage that you're exhaled carbon dioxide is poisonous not life to plants
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:42.280]  and they give us life back they teach you that you're trash that women are
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:46.000]  ugly I mean I see beautiful women everywhere that all are obsessed that
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.280]  they're ugly and all obsessed what's good-looking is a woman who's into herself
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:55.440]  and feels good about life that's what's sexy men seek for these trappings of
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:00.680]  false gladiatorial power and of a bearing of strength but most of them
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:05.000]  cry like little babies when they actually get hurt
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:13.080]  until you are ready to sacrifice yourself on the altar of liberty you have no
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:17.480]  future and it's the moment that you're willing to give it all that you find
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:22.640]  victory what's that song freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:31.160]  and we ain't got nothing if we ain't free understand that you ain't got
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:38.880]  nothing if you're not free you ain't got nothing the fake prosperity of the 90s
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:42.640]  as they were building up the Ponzi bubble laughing at us setting up the
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.760]  police state grid going folks are gonna get mad when this when we pull the
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.640]  trigger on them and Bloomberg I was listening to Bloomberg radio yesterday
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.480]  we're laughing at their listeners calling them stupid because they're
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:55.680]  talking to the intelligentsia class of business people that like to think of
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:59.560]  everybody is dumb and let's figure out how to fleece dumb people instead of
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:03.400]  let's build up society so our sons and daughters have good people to be around
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:08.240]  all you people that think you're part of the establishment who think you pray on
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:12.600]  people you're being preyed on as well and you pollute the society you pollute
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:17.640]  the culture Jason in Connecticut thanks for holding her on the air go ahead
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:21.400]  thank you for having me on you're my Vince Lombardi by the way you know
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:24.920]  forget these NFL guys you're my Vince Lombardi first I want to take this
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:30.040]  moment and just say I want to remember my cousin John Sherry who died on 9-11 at
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:34.120]  the World Trade Center he was a beautiful man and his life was taken I
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:38.960]  speak for myself not my family when I know was an inside job you know I was in
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:44.280]  Australia last year just walking around and man I saw guys in orange suits in
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:49.600]  people's yards digging through people's garbage I mean I wish I had a camera no
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:53.480]  no it's on the news it's funny you say orange and some regions they're yellow
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:57.280]  and others it's orange and then they're the little minimum wage people then they
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:02.720]  call guys in green swat uniforms in with combat boats and yeah they dig through
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:07.240]  your garbage they read your mail they demand to come in your house and and the
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:12.120]  sheep farmers now pay in the line item a carbon footprint for the gas of the
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:18.000]  sheep Alex it was insane I mean they had trucks up and down the street people
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.160]  just dig them through garbage I don't know what they were looking for you
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:24.880]  probably know better than I do no a battery or plastic you were supposed
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:29.080]  to recycle you go to jail oh it's crazy it's crazy but let me ask you what is
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:35.720]  your prediction for this country in the next five years my prediction is the
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:40.760]  destiny is in your hands history is not a foregone conclusion if we stand up and
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:45.360]  do the right thing we think we can be given a reprieve like Nineveh but it's
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:49.000]  going to be incredible tumult they'll finally have to admit we're in a
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.920]  depression in the next six months to a year they will of course offer new
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:58.160]  horrible global carbon taxes and VAT as Europe is now being offered our future
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:03.840]  is what you see happening in Europe now giant new taxes major benefits cut but
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:08.200]  military pension slash police pension slashed and told well at least you still
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:12.300]  got a job as everything is paid to the foreign bankers who will then hoard the
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:17.640]  money and make sure it doesn't go back into the economy while they hyper inflate
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:21.240]  the currency so you both have a depression in the real economy but
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:25.080]  also hyper inflated so what you've got doesn't buy as much so it gets worse and
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:29.720]  worse and worse and then only federal governments can come in and quote bring
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:33.320]  order so we get sold on that just like they're saying in Europe only a total
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:37.760]  dictatorship of the banks can fix this they're like we'll fix the economy higher
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:43.120]  taxes foreign banks run us conquering them that's what I see happening giant
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:46.880]  terror attacks blamed on domestic groups secret arrest crackdowns on
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:50.840]  political speech paramilitary police executing people you already see that
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:55.000]  happening and it's like oh well they killed another guy what's your
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.680]  prediction for the next five years something major coming this way I mean
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:04.720]  there's a big event fight back this cold and flu season with a world's best

[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:45.120]  thing lined up they're saying don't trust any of your neighbors the FBI was
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:49.080]  reading an article this morning admitted there were more than 50 flights
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:54.560]  grounded with abject total hysteria because there were brown people on
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:55:03.200]  board one lady was Jewish strip searched everything and it's just the
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:11.240]  wicked fleas when none pursue meanwhile in Mexico LA Times reports more
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.680]  Mexico youth to die from violence than car wrecks car wrecks under the age of
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:20.200]  55 worldwide is the number one cause of death number one but you still get your
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:23.440]  car because it's fun to drive and go places and you're brought up being
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:26.360]  taught it's safe mommy and daddy put you in and drive off like it's no big
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:30.840]  deal but we looked it up on average there's three shark deaths a year people
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:33.560]  are totally scared to death of them tens of millions of deaths from on the
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:38.120]  bills not scared three shark deaths nightmares everyone afraid in the water
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:44.280]  flopping around in total fear Mexico there is through movies and culture I
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.000]  see it a fear that men and men are killing thousands of Hispanics men and
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.400]  men have never killed anybody but they put it in movies so it must be true see
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:56.240]  because all the death in Mexico is I guess in a way it is America it's the
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:00.960]  ATF shipping the guns down but they report on the thousands and thousands of
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:05.080]  young people absolutely murdered and there's another report here hanging
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:09.680]  corpses of two young people French news agency carry threat to Mexico Internet
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:15.960]  users if you just comment on the drug gangs in Mexico you're murdered I've
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:18.480]  even report on it the bloodstained bodies of a man and woman were found
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:23.360]  hanging from a bridge in a northeast Mexico yesterday along with threatening
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:28.800]  messages to people who report drug violence on social networks and that's
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:33.080]  why a lot of reporters here in the US still say oh nobody's dying there's no
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:36.240]  kidnappings there's nothing going on and the police roll over and take the
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:41.080]  payments in Mexico it's totally lawless now the globalist bit off more than they
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:47.280]  can choose six years ago they attempted to send in the US train troops Los
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:51.160]  Zetas mainly to knock out the three or four other big cartels and the war just
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:55.360]  started then quite frankly the Mexican government the globalist because they're
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:00.200]  so corrupt and they're just drug gangs as well they're losing and humanity is
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:04.400]  losing of course you if you decriminalize drugs it would all end
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:10.440]  overnight but they've grown the gangs up so huge now that they would move on in
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:13.880]  into other things like kidnapping extortion oh you want your Mexican
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:17.400]  football team to come up here and play pay us $30,000 it will kill you and they
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:21.200]  will kill you and now it's starting to happen in the US and the government just
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:25.600]  covers it up instead of see something say something it's a tea party or watch
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:28.680]  out they're gonna kill you and they've got cops and seminars trained I've seen
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:35.840]  the video so I'm 60 minutes last week reared on cable just literally going we
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:40.120]  will all be attacked guaranteed all Americans will be terror everywhere we
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:44.400]  need armed guards everywhere and who's gonna attack the evil right wingers
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:48.520]  meanwhile it's 30 plus thousand dead total battle and pouring across absolute
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:52.880]  hell on earth the government shipping the cocaine and guns in the Mexico all
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:57.200]  confirmed nobody gets in trouble and it's the drug war will continue because
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:00.440]  the cops are laundering the money and the banks are and this is what America is
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:04.560]  and the eugenicists sit up on top of it all laundering the money putting poison
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:07.160]  in the water so of course they're dealing the drugs I mean this is criminals

[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:57.400]  Weiner the Weiner seat lost in New York to a Republican that's just people
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:01:00.800]  desperately running from party to party we don't like Bush Obama save us we
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:06.720]  were like Obama Bachman save us and I don't know them the media does attack
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:11.480]  Bachman more than Mitt Romney or Rick Perry so I guess that's why Ron Paul says
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:16.240]  he likes her just to disagrees with her on some things I mean I got to say it
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:22.800]  it's like Ron Paul Bachman and then you just can't vote for any of the others
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:29.800]  and Bachman is not not good compared to Ron Paul I just made a study of her if
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:34.320]  we the word is you're gonna get a Rick Perry Sarah Palin if that works or it's
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:38.560]  gonna be a Rick Perry Bachman but now they've been fighting with each other
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.320]  so much and there was never behind the scenes stuff going on there was behind
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:44.760]  the scenes with Palin I've confirmed that do you understand me how big of news
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:48.600]  this is the average person doesn't even believe me when I say this stuff I told
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:52.080]  you Perry was gonna have a pledge and break it and he would run and all this
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:56.200]  stuff and it happened I told you that Lou Dobbs was going to Fox News three
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:59.120]  months before it happened everybody was blown away by that and I said we Fox
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:04.440]  business because I had that from sources and I told you that Rick Perry and
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:08.600]  Sarah Palin like two dogs have been sniffing each other's you know what's
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:16.400]  they are looking at that that is in the cards I will tell you that that is in
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:26.800]  the cards bigger than Dallas and it could end up being a Romney Bachman too
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:33.920]  let's go ahead and talk to Chris and Iowa Chris thanks for holding her on the
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:38.800]  air hey I love your show I would disagree just with that I think Ron Paul is
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:43.000]  gonna take it I think there's enough Ron Paul people I'm calling from Central
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:48.520]  Iowa I was at the straw poll it was Ron Paul people everywhere Michelle Bachman
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:52.720]  people a little here a little there but Ron Paul people were everywhere and I
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:57.400]  found out a week later that if you want to see Randy Travis in concert that was
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:02.040]  confirmed you had to buy a ticket straw poll for her no she bought 4,000
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:07.800]  over 4,300 votes so Ron Paul beat her by about 90% even though he was a
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:13.920]  statistical you know buy a nose second place to her you know 201 votes behind
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:17.720]  her out of you know thousands and thousands but it expands on that did
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:22.840]  you see Wall Street journals only said Bachman Perry and Romney yesterday and
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:29.680]  other was Ron Paul it was 60 plus percent the polls obviously are run by
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:34.920]  people that want you to even the John Stewart I can't really use that guy but
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:39.480]  he did a great parody on how the media has been treating Ron wasn't a parody he
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:43.320]  showed the clips how it's a talking point and you know the fixes in look but
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:47.760]  you said you disagree if you took away from what I'm saying that Ron Paul isn't
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:52.480]  gonna win he can win he should win and he wins just by running if he didn't win
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:56.800]  the big prize he wins by fighting getting the word out and illustrating
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:02.560]  real issues okay and growing liberty but he can win I'm saying the establishment
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:09.800]  intends for the president to be Rick Perry okay inside baseball Republicans
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:18.560]  they want Rick Perry and they have put him and the Alaskan Queen the beauty
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:24.240]  queen together repeatedly in the political stable to just sniff each other
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:28.800]  and that there may be a political birth out of that that's what I'm telling you
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:32.280]  these is that is that is that is that that's in the cards big time you see
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.360]  what I'm saying I believe you're probably right they I know they don't like Ron
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:39.960]  Paul it's become so dang obvious don't like him they're scared to death of him
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:45.560]  well I mean what if he had such a huge showing that they can't you know they
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:49.200]  can't suppress him well that's what's happening that's what's happening right
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:57.240]  now Chris beautiful I agree with you Ron Paul's dominating that's why they're
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:02.720]  going he can't win he can't win he can't win he can't win he can't win hundreds
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:07.080]  of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:12.080]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda they'll be
[02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:15.720]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've termed members
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:20.760]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:26.120]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:31.040]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:35.440]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:08.920]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:13.240]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:17.200]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:21.600]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:25.880]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:29.640]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:33.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:37.760]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:41.520]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:44.240]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:49.520]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar

[02:08:54.160 --> 02:09:02.560]  seven o'clock prisonplanet.tv or info wars news dot com now I heard this last
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:07.400]  year and I heard it earlier this year but now it's they're moving forward with
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:11.720]  it not just with injectable but with all sorts of other forms if you claim
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:20.360]  that it can have medical benefits and what's happening is two-time Nobel
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:26.560]  Prize winner Linus Pauling proved in major medical studies with animals that
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:32.760]  mega doses of your huge overdoses of vitamin C if it's raw real vitamin C has
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:40.440]  near fountain of youth type effects if you're not too far gone and of course
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:46.080]  everybody knows this 500 years ago the Spanish the French everybody else
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:49.760]  couldn't go on long journeys because they didn't know why their teeth fell out
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:53.520]  and why old wounds opened up and why they got wrinkles all over them and
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:58.680]  collapsed and died scurvy and the British I was like almost 400 years ago
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:02.520]  you can look it up in their Royal Academy and Royal Society they figured
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:07.400]  out that it was vitamin C they didn't call it vitamin they hadn't they just
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:13.320]  said the essence of certain fruits it was actually a British secret document
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:17.960]  for over a hundred years and the French and others would still make fun of them
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:23.240]  because they found out about it they said oh yeah you you squeeze limes into
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:26.720]  the the rum because they all got their allotment of rum and water mixed together
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:32.840]  called Grog and they would they would there's accounts of them calling the
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:40.440]  British limies because everywhere they went they had big baskets and and nets
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:45.280]  including dried hanging outside of limes and the sailors didn't like to take
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:48.960]  baths they didn't like to swim they had all their own superstitions in fact a
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:52.880]  hundred years later they were still complaining about the lime being added
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:58.640]  to their rum they would throw fits about it but it even became regulations on
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:03.920]  ships that weren't military because most the captains were former military and
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.440]  would make them drink it and so a British ship would be 5,000 miles away
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:13.080]  from home pull up on a French ship they could be out number two to one and the
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:17.320]  French or the Spanish would or the Portuguese would be hanging on the sides
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:21.800]  only almost dead because people didn't even like fruit back then they wouldn't
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:25.920]  even when they got into ports eat a lot of fruit they thought for scurvy you ate
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:31.640]  a rat which was actually true rodents produced vitamin C naturally in their
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:36.200]  intestines so it is true if you eat a rat even if you don't eat the intestines
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:42.920]  it's in the bloodstream that you will get a well we have an expert on with us
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:47.360]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs and for those that don't know pharmacists tend to do more
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:50.920]  than doctors I know my dad's an oral surgeon and dentist and he will call
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:54.680]  pharmacist you know ask them questions because they're the specialist in these
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:58.120]  areas they have to go through a lot of stuff even more rigorous than what
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:00.720]  doctors go through they've got to know the interactions they've got to know
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:04.300]  the biology they've got to know the chemistry and Ben Fuchs has been a
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:09.160]  pharmacist for decades he's a leading health expert and I haven't implemented
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:14.080]  all the stuff he does yet I don't know him allowed to talk about this but as
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:17.640]  well Aaron's proud of it Aaron has lost over 40 pounds following what Ben Fuchs
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:25.440]  says does exactly in two months the guy is is is is gonna be skinny soon I mean
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:29.960]  it's incredible I've got family that started to implement it and it is
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:34.320]  miraculous so I'm trying to do what Fuchs says and I'd actually I don't know
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:36.800]  if you could tell and I always lose some weight and get it back but I've lost
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:40.440]  about eight pounds the last two weeks just doing part of what Fuchs says to
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:45.560]  do but that's another issue for another day the reason I've got him on with us
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:50.080]  is FDA outlawing injectable vitamin C to further destroy health of Americans
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:53.400]  and they've had a lot of mainline clinics of course injecting it
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:58.760]  intervenously in things and but now they're moving to say you can't take it
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:03.080]  as pill form and if anybody advertises and says this has a health effect you
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:07.960]  can't ladies and gentlemen everyone knows that vitamin C since the British
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:13.920]  discovered it everyone knows that it's an essential vitamin for the entire
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:18.480]  body's metabolic system just as vitamin A that you don't really produce
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:23.640]  properly until you get sun that's why you need some moderate son it's like you
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:27.960]  the old doctor thing a hundred years ago eat some good fresh food vegetables
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:33.280]  fruits and get some sun go old nursing homes I used to visit my great
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:37.600]  grandmother in Dallas her nursing home and you know she was 97 years old they
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:42.640]  would they would they would roll her out even when she was you know pretty much
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:46.040]  seen I didn't know a lot of people were they would roll them out and you'd see
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:50.640]  all the old folks lined up outside out there on a nice sunny spring day now
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:55.440]  under federal guidelines they say do not let them get any sun none and Cass
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:14:00.560]  Unstein says he wants to make it to law so vitamin C is bad sunlight's bad
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:05.480]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs they're really moving with Codex Alimentarius thank you
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:09.360]  for joining us and please break down exactly some of the big attacks we're
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:13.280]  seeing on health freedom right now well first of all thank you so much for for
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:15.880]  all the kind words I appreciate that Alex and thank you so much for the work
[02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:19.440]  that you're doing I really appreciate that and I know all of your listeners do
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:22.960]  as well as far as vitamin C goes it's really the FDA is probably going to let
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:26.960]  Codex Alimentarius take care of their dirty work as far as outlawing certain
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:30.480]  supplements and keeping us from getting the doses that we need already you can't
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:34.480]  get the doses that you need a vitamin C and other nutrients in places like
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:38.680]  Germany and Canada and some other other countries in Europe this whole thing
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:44.680]  around vitamin C is more like the FDA protecting drug manufacturers turf
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:48.960]  against small manufacturers and against compounding pharmacists it was in
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:53.640]  December of last year that this whole thing came about where the FDA ordered
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:58.000]  manufacturers to stop making injectable vitamin C and compounding pharmacists to
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.640]  stop making injectable vitamin C because as you pointed out in your monologue
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:07.640]  there vitamin C is amazingly powerful it stands out singularly among all
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:11.120]  nutrients all nutrients are powerful in the sense that they're essential the
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:14.240]  word essential means you better get it in your diet or you better be
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:17.720]  supplementing and for people that don't know though even people's pharmacy great
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:22.400]  folks are in town it's taking over and supplanting Walgreens they're building
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:27.120]  locations everywhere medical doctors are now more and more ordering stuff from
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:32.280]  these original compounding pharmacies and I've heard on local radio shows they
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:35.880]  have on 590 on the weekend and I went and looked it up it's true they're trying
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:39.600]  to ban natural hormones that they're giving women that have had two or three
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:44.360]  miscarriages so they can have the baby with that supplement they're trying to
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:46.800]  I hear them griping about they're trying to tell them they can't compound
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:52.560]  vitamin C more and more because real medicine real natural drugs that are
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:58.200]  things like natural hormones natural fats natural vitamin C is really starting
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:02.840]  to anger big pharma that's the problem is big pharma its centralization it's
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:07.040]  this massive more a monster in Washington is that is protecting the turf
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:12.200]  of these big mega mega national multinational mega corporations and
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:17.480]  so the battle that we're witnessing is really between the FDA and local
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:21.840]  pharmacies who are responsive to their clients but the biggest statement that we
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:26.600]  can make as individuals in my humble opinion is to get ourselves on a good
[02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:31.560]  nutritional supplement program until we are well-nutriated Alex we will be it
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:36.080]  will be like shooting fish in a barrel it will be fodder for these big
[02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:40.280]  companies because as long when we're not healthy we don't make good decisions
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:44.240]  when we're not healthy we will not be able to withstand this assault on our
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:48.560]  freedom so our number one job as individuals is to disengage from the
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:53.400]  fast food machinery to disengage from the processed food monster to disengage
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:57.120]  from prescription drugs and get ourselves on number one a good nutritional
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:01.680]  supplement program and number two begin to understand how to interact correctly
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:06.040]  with the foods that we're eating because we are doing their dirty work for them
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:10.520]  we are killing ourselves by participating in the foods in the
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:14.840]  fast foods in the processed foods and in big pharma's poisons and the number
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:18.760]  one decision the most important decision we can make is to commit to be on a
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:22.360]  nutritional supplement program and to commit to being conscious about how we
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:26.640]  eat and like you were saying how difficult it is sometimes to to fight the
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:31.840]  urges to fight the addictive drives for processed foods the reason we have these
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:36.040]  addictive drives and the reason we have these compulsions for food is because
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:40.840]  food manufacturers understand how to hit our hot buttons and our hot buttons are
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:44.880]  around salt and they're around fats and they're around sweets because we have
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:49.000]  certain hard-wired drives that are survival based and as long as we're
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:53.360]  deficient in good fats we will be heading for the fast food fats as long
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:58.160]  as you've done Aaron is taking the plant and animal derived essential fatty
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:02.880]  acids so he's not getting the calories he's taking the way shakes he's eating
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:07.520]  the salads and he says he can eat all he wants it tastes great and he literally
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:12.360]  is shriveling up in there and I am in the next few weeks I've got to just fully
[02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:16.640]  launch on it it's just it takes time and preparation to make sure I do it all and
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:20.800]  I know my wife's going fully on it I mean well I mean I hate to bring him in
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:23.840]  here like a guinea pig but in a few weeks I'll bring Aaron in here and we'll show
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:29.320]  you before and after of him on the show it is miraculous well you see that's
[02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:32.480]  the reason I talk about the power of nutritional supplementation so much is
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:36.080]  because when you start to meet your body's basic requirements for minerals
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:39.360]  when you beat your body's basic requirement for essential fatty acids
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:43.040]  when you meet your body's basic requirements for for protein you're not
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:47.160]  going to want the french fries I hate willpower I don't have any willpower at
[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:50.920]  all I don't it to me it sounds like this horrible battle that's going on inside
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:55.400]  your body directing yourself towards good nutrients should be simple and
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:58.720]  should be easy and once you've gotten yourself on a good nutritional supplement
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:02.120]  program and that's one of the main reasons why I'm so big on Dr. Wallach's
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:05.840]  program at infowordsteam.com and if anybody's interested by the way in learning

[02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:14.920]  all the other callers I'm sorry we're not gonna have time to get to you and the
[02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:21.240]  time we have left today. Pharmacist Ben Fuchs isn't like the normal groups that
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:25.280]  are out there hey lose weight by taking speed and starving yourself and then
[02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:31.160]  your body goes into you know a critical mode and as soon as you go off the diet
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:34.720]  you gain all the weight back and more it's and I listen to a show almost every
[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:37.920]  morning when I have a chance it's on right before mine here at Genesis
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:41.960]  on the GCN radio network and the rest of the office started listening and family
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:44.720]  of mine started listening and I mean I know he knows what he's talking about
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:48.500]  because I've been around the country with him at events and many mountain
[02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:53.920]  California as well when I was out there speaking at an event and talking to
[02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:59.720]  Ben you know I never had time to implement it all I have started doing
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:04.000]  the Tangy Tangerine and beyond Tangy Tangerine that is available I do promote
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.640]  this stuff because I went out and searched the best stuff out there that
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:11.840]  I was gonna start taking that's available in FullWarsTeam.com but the
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:17.120]  issue here is that that has given me a lot more energy because I was starting
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:22.160]  to really get tired in the last six months ago or so when I started to start
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:25.720]  investigating health and really trying to get back into it again because no
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:30.760]  matter how much you eat most of it doesn't have the minerals and the vitamins
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:37.600]  and things you need because the cows are fed from crops that are grown on soils
[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:42.240]  that have been depleted you're eating crops that have been depleted and when
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:46.760]  you do take a Tangy Tangerine or beyond Tangy Tangerine or pollen burst and you
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:51.200]  get all these B vitamins and minerals and everything else then you're not as
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:56.320]  hungry and that's how without even increasing my exercise I've been
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:00.000]  exercising forever basically I've been losing weight and getting a lot better
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:03.240]  shape even though I'm under incredible stress now going back this is a short
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:07.760]  segment long one coming up but pharmacist Ben what else is going on out
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:12.840]  there in the news because I see a lot of attacks now on basic vitamins and
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:16.160]  minerals I mean if they're going after vitamin C now and they're going after
[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:19.880]  fish oil now they're going after mainline stuff that must mean that people
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:23.480]  are really starting to wake up and then I go look at the market numbers it's true
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:28.120]  people are really discovering common sense nutrition now do you think the
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:32.040]  system's gonna be successful in trying to clamp down on it oh heck no there's no
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:34.640]  way they're gonna be successful because people aren't satisfied with their
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:38.000]  prescription drugs that are being hop there being marketed as the alternative
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.920]  prescription drugs are being sold to us the way commodities are sold on
[02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:47.240]  television you see pretty models and you see spokespeople and you see all
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:50.240]  kinds of marketing sneaky marketing messages being sold you ever notice
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:54.120]  how these cholesterol drugs that they're selling always feature these big buff
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:58.640]  guys who are mountain climbing or riding a mountain bike down a down a steep
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:01.720]  mountain road and they always look like the picture of health the model that
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:05.720]  we're being sold is that prescription drugs are part of being healthy and I'm
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:09.040]  telling you as a pharmacist nothing could be further from the truth in fact
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:14.200]  it's 180 degrees opposite from that when you take a prescription drug not only
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:18.360]  are you not healthy not only you're not doing anything to improve your state of
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:22.840]  well-being but prescription drugs are processed by the body as poison and you
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:26.680]  begin to degrade the body's ability to do its work to do what it's supposed to
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:30.200]  be pharmacist let's be clear than for people because I see different numbers
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:35.720]  even in mainline media but you know I always say there's more deaths from
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:39.920]  automobile accident than anything else but really from numbers I've seen it's
[02:27:39.920 --> 02:27:46.600]  about to be eclipsed by prescription drug interaction deaths and that's just
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:50.320]  the ones that are being confirmed the medical community generally likes to
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:54.320]  cover up their own mistakes it's much worse than that they're about the third
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:57.040]  lead it third or fourth leading cause of death right now that we know of but
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:00.720]  many times people die of a heart attack supposedly but they've been on poly
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:03.680]  pharmacy they've been on multiple drugs and even though it says on the death
[02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:08.000]  certificate that their heart gave out it we don't know if it's the the body's
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:11.360]  attempt to process eight or nine or ten different medicines that caused their
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:14.840]  heart to give out so I suspect as a pharmacist that you're looking at much
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:18.600]  more than the third leading cause of death they could conceivably even be one
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:23.000]  of the top two leading causes of death if you start to tally in the figures the
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:27.680]  bottom line is though you can't expect a prescription drug to give you health in
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:30.400]  fact they don't even tell you that they'll give you a health they tell you
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:35.680]  they will treat your disease so we are satisfying ourselves with treating
[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:39.640]  diseases with drugs instead of eliminating diseases at the causal level
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:42.920]  here's an example in the good nutrients exactly talk about this briefly as we
[02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:49.040]  got a break shingles is is a record rise but I've read even the old wives
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:52.680]  treatments for this that certain foods with minerals and vitamins that it's a
[02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:58.880]  deficiency has a much much better effect rate than drugs or vaccines these
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:03.120]  virus the herpes zoster virus that causes shingles lives inside cells and it's
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:07.120]  an opportunistic virus it waits for you to be sick it waits for your immune
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:10.720]  system to be suppressed it waits for you to be nutritionally deficient it
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:14.120]  waits for you to be on prescription drugs so that your immune system is
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:18.360]  compromised and then it bursts on you then it attacks so if you have shingles
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:21.800]  and you're concerned about that build your immune system up make sure you're
[02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:25.640]  taking your vitamin C in your nutrients reduce your sugar intake get out there
[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:28.800]  and exercise these are all powerful alternatives and not only will eliminate
[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:32.880]  shingles but improve your health in general I want to talk about eczema on
[02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:37.680]  the other side a lot of people that's as you know pharmacists exploding I want
[02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:41.600]  to get into weight loss briefly as well and then take some phone calls and I

[02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:39.000]  few weeks if that does happen or info wars nightly news but I I had the idea
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:44.960]  that's a great banner campaign idea for info wars team calm because nothing
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:49.360]  sells like the truth and success I was planning to do this with myself but I've
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:55.760]  got to actually do the program fully but I can take we never did before and
[02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:58.920]  after too bad with air but what we've got shots of him from when he's been on
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:02.520]  TV and then we'll get him back in here and get another shot off the same
[02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:06.760]  camera you know video still of him literally losing like 40 pounds and

[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:14.880]  diets before because you know he sits in there works 18 hours a day I can't
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:17.800]  even get him out of here it's not like he's a slave in a cage I'm like
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:20.760]  sometimes I come here and he's up the next day working with no nothing but
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:24.680]  coffee and I'm like dude go home he's like but I got a battle these people I
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:27.720]  got to finish this project look at all these documents I discovered they really
[02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:32.120]  are putting cancer viruses and Alex we got a war like I know I know that's why

[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:19.760]  some of the news that just come out in the last 30 minutes at info wars calm
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:25.160]  really creepy British footballer under investigation for 9-11 comments that's
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:30.320]  right now in England if you now criticize global warming you get a police
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:37.480]  visit like it's illegal if you say 9-11 is an inside job then you get a police
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:44.040]  visit you can't make this up and the articles up at info wars calm and Kurt
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:49.920]  has links to the BBC who's reporting on it like it's a good thing see they're
[02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:53.840]  getting so desperate now they're like we'll arrest you okay it's not an
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:58.960]  inside job shut up don't talk about it anymore we really want to stage this
[02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:03.680]  again you're taking our favorite tool always stop it we want another Oklahoma
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:08.800]  city to blame domestic groups well cover this more and there's another one
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:13.960]  Nigel Farage one of the big leaders of the UK Independence Party Greece under
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:19.120]  full globalist dictatorship EU head calls for more European federalism
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:23.240]  that's what I've been warning you about they engineer the crisis sign over to
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:27.120]  the foreign banks and then try to hand the entire country over I want to get
[02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:31.240]  Nigel Farage back on you kept members email me and say we want Nigel we want
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:35.920]  Nigel I know you want him he's been so busy and he barely survived that plane
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:41.240]  crash and he's busy in the EU Parliament and he said well good job will you end
[02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:45.680]  if you wanted my other party members I'm so busy but you tell him to come on
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:49.640]  we'll get Lord Moncton on to his part of you kept it at Farage is a great guy
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:54.320]  that's a key article up there so that the power grab is going on Pell mail but
[02:36:54.320 --> 02:37:00.320]  I'm telling you if you get your body in gear and again I've just been doing this
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:04.520]  really I was barely doing it for the last six months barely just the energy
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:08.880]  drinks that are vitamins and minerals that didn't help me but then the last two
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:12.400]  weeks I've been doing the way shakes and doing this you know the products that
[02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:17.960]  Fuchs particularly recommends from infowars team.com and I mean usually I
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:21.680]  run a mile and a half I've got to stop I'm running three miles now I'm having a
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:25.640]  lot more energy my wife's been talking about it so she started it as well
[02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:29.560]  having big effects and again I know I'm pitching pitching pitching it's because
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:34.080]  it really works talk about weight loss because Aaron can listen every day I
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:38.480]  can only listen a few days a week break down in like four or five minutes your
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:42.440]  weight loss but you don't even call it weight loss you say get healthy you'll
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:48.760]  lose weight explain this to us. Runners are this is this whole idea about how to
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:53.280]  take care of yourself is based on how we evolved 50,000 100,000 years on the
[02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:58.160]  African savannah we evolved to attach calories with nutrition so when we killed
[02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:02.800]  a zebra 50,000 years ago when we got the calories we got nutrition so the body
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:08.400]  has designed is designed to associate caloric intake with nutrition when we
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:12.680]  get caloric intake without nutrition the body's like well that wasn't it let's go
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:15.920]  out and find some more calories so we get more calories without nutrients and
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:19.520]  this keeps happening and what ends up happening eventually is calories mean
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:23.720]  heat, heat means storage, storage means fat so the key to break in this cycle is
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:28.680]  to give yourself nutrients without the caloric load when you give yourself
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:33.040]  nutrients without the caloric load you get satisfied the reason we are in the
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:36.680]  refrigerator an hour after we had Thanksgiving dinner is because we got
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:40.600]  plenty of calories but no nutrients when you reverse that equation give
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:44.680]  yourself the nutrients without calories you become satisfied and this satiety
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:49.560]  this satisfaction is the key to wellness and it's the key to losing weight you
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:53.840]  want to hit your satiety buttons your satisfaction buttons with nutrients
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:57.600]  without calories nutrition without calories keeps you satisfied the food
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:01.960]  processors and the food manufacturers understand this and so what they do is
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:06.600]  they give us plenty of chemicals that purport to hit the satiety button that
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:11.080]  pretend to hit that satisfaction button but don't so we end up not stopping the
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:15.480]  potato chips and the french fries and all these foods that have the fake satiety
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:20.560]  button satisfaction button chemicals but not the real nutrients so the key to
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:23.960]  being able to withstand the assault from the french fries and the potato chips and
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:27.360]  the pizza and all the fast foods that we like and by the way notice that all the
[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:31.800]  foods that we like are combinations of salt which hits the mineral satisfaction
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:36.680]  button oil which is the fat satisfaction button and sugar which hits the protein
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:41.080]  satisfaction button without giving us the real protein the real minerals and the
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:45.600]  real essential fatty acids that we need so when we supplement with protein we
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:49.560]  naturally don't want sugar when we supplement with essential fatty acids
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:53.960]  we naturally don't want french fries or ice cream or potato chips and when we
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:57.960]  supplement with minerals we can withstand the soft cravings and that's the
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:03.640]  key it's to outsmart the food processors and to outsmart your drives by giving
[02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:07.560]  yourself protein to withstand sugar giving yourself minerals to withstand
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:12.080]  soft cravings and by giving yourself essential fatty acids to withstand the
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:15.480]  fat cravings and if I had to pick one thing that one single supplement to tell
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:18.880]  everybody to take right away I would tell you it's essential fatty acids
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:23.360]  because the body's need for fats is so fundamental on multiple levels on
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:27.880]  hormonal levels on satisfaction levels for building cell membranes okay what's
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:32.120]  the what's the best kind because you've got the fish oil based at info wars team
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:36.040]  calm and you've got the plant base and I've heard you say taking both is good
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:40.280]  well as far as fats you're talking about essential fatty acids yes I'm I like
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:44.120]  the ultimate EFAs the ultimate EFAs are balanced with the two main essential
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:48.440]  fatty acids they're very reasonably priced and it doesn't take very long for
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:51.000]  you to notice a fact you were talking about eczema before we went to break
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.840]  that's plan arrived though right well essential fatty acids are not you're
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:58.080]  thinking of minerals minerals or plant derived the essential fatty acid but they
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:01.720]  have a fit they have some essential fatty acids that are plant derived they are
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:06.080]  omega-6 no I know because I take I've been started taking those okay that's
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:10.200]  right they are vegetable based those are flaxseed based flaxseed oil from
[02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:14.680]  omega-6 sorry omega-6 oils come from sunflower and safflower and omega-3
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:18.440]  oils come from flaxseed so those are vegetable based the only essential
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:22.960]  fatty acid that's found in animals is fish oil and that's not really a parent
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:26.200]  essential fatty acid that is a derivative essential fatty acid and it's
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:30.640]  important but it's not as important as real parent essential fatty acid oils
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:35.640]  which are flaxseed oil and then sunflower okay get back to the axema one
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:38.720]  that's right skincare is one of my specialties I've been formulating
[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:42.240]  skincare products for almost 30 years now and I know a lot about the skin and
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:45.440]  let me tell you something when you have something going on in your skin you can
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:48.760]  rest assured it's not in a vacuum you have something going on in the rest of
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:53.520]  your body when you see eczema psoriasis acne dry skin rosacea you have a
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:58.920]  biochemical breakdown inside the body and I cannot emphasize this more firmly
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:04.080]  that you can't treat a skincare a skincare issue without treating the
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:08.880]  inside of the body the skins is a fatty organ skin cells are very dependent on
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:12.680]  essential fatty acids if you had to pick one supplement to take for eczema for
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:16.760]  psoriasis for acne I would tell you it's essential fatty acids although I hate
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:21.160]  isolating just one supplement eczema by the way is attached to digestive
[02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:25.960]  problems especially with children dairy allergies wheat allergies if you have a
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:30.400]  food if you have a digestive issue and a skincare problem more than likely your
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:33.840]  skincare problem is related to something you eat there is an intimate
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:37.720]  connection between the steps the cells that make up the digestive system and
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:41.960]  the cells that make up the skin there's a connection between the two when you
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:45.800]  have a digestive problem it very often will show up on the skin and when people
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:50.040]  come into my my pharmacy with skincare problems the first thing we do is we do
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:53.960]  a digestive workup and we correct digestive problems probiotics good
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:57.880]  bacteria digestive enzymes eliminating problem foods those are the most
[02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:00.640]  important things you could do for eczema in addition to nutritional
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:05.680]  supplements like EFAs and zinc zinc deficiency is one of the most unfortunate
[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:10.000]  nutritional deficiencies we confront because it's so inexpensive yet zinc
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.440]  is involved in hundreds of different chemical reactions it's stored in the
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:16.800]  skin it's involved in making collagen it's involved in fighting bacteria and
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:20.640]  fighting acne yet most Americans who are not supplementing are going to be
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:26.960]  deficient in zinc what would you recommend treat by the way yes what would
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:30.680]  you recommend just for overall general health how would you start out if you
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:33.000]  were going and getting some of the vitamins and minerals and other things
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:36.200]  that are at info wars team dot com healthy start pack is the first thing I
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:39.120]  would do and if you want to throw something else in I throw the ultimate
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:43.440]  multis the healthy start pack is your osteo fx it's your essential fatty acids
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:46.480]  and my favorite product in that whole line let me tell you that is a very
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:49.680]  respectable line and I formulate products myself so when I look at
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:53.480]  formulations I'm looking at them not only as a pharmacist and as a consumer but
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:56.440]  also as a formulator and my favorite product in that entire line is the
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:00.880]  beyond tangy tangerine because it's liquid nutrition and when you get
[02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:05.480]  yourself nutrients without having to put a digestive or a caloric load on your
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:09.760]  system your body loves you and one of the beautiful things about nutritional
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:13.560]  supplementation is the more deficient you are Alex this is so cool to me the
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:18.360]  more deficient you are the faster your body absorbs those nutrients like a
[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:22.560]  dry sponge sucks up more water than a wet sponge so when you get on the beyond
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:26.160]  tangy tangerine it doesn't take you a month to notice results it doesn't even
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:30.040]  take you weeks to notice results you notice results within days and the
[02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:33.840]  sicker you are the more nutritionally deficient you are the faster you notice
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:36.760]  results and given that over a hundred million americans are suffering from
[02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:42.480]  digestive issues and digestive problems it makes amazing sense to give yourself
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:46.040]  dense nutrition without having to interface with the digestive system
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:49.640]  without putting a stress on the digestive system on enzymes on the liver or on the
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:54.320]  gallbladder or the pancreas on tangy tangerine answer your question well
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:58.280]  that's I mean I've noticed that if I've got to do like some midnight radio show
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:03.560]  and I ate dinner at like seven and I'm like I'm hungry again I could drink
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:08.000]  orange juice before I could even eat a hot dog out of the refrigerator something
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:11.840]  unhealthy whatever it would not satisfy me but if I just go do a tangy
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:15.720]  tangerine there's almost no calories in there but there's all the vitamins all
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:21.240]  the minerals bam drink that and I really feel it and go to bed to feel great and
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:25.520]  so that's the main thing I've been doing is the tangy tangerine and that's
[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:28.280]  another you raised a very good point you know sometimes people wake up in the
[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:31.320]  middle of the night and they can't go back to sleep that's because you've got
[02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:35.000]  this hypoglycemia going on your body is trying to process things and it's
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:38.720]  requiring nutrients but if you don't have nutrients in your body or enough
[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:41.840]  nutrients in your body in the middle of the night you're going to go into low
[02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:45.120]  blood sugar bam your adrenal glands are going to kick in you're going to pump
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:47.920]  out stress hormone and you will wake up and you're not going to be able to go
[02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:51.960]  back to sleep but if you do some slender FX protein or some beyond tangy
[02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:56.040]  tangerine or some magnesium before you go to bed that will help your body do
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:46:00.120]  its work during the night it won't have to go into cortisol or adrenal energy
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:03.840]  and you'll be able to sleep better through the night so taking beyond tangy
[02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:07.760]  tangerine taking protein before you go to bed is one of the best strategies you
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:12.240]  could do to get yourself a good night's sleep well we're gonna we're gonna do
[02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:15.720]  this side by side with Aaron I can probably twist his arm into doing it
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:18.800]  just so people can see it but people can watch him on the nightly news when he
[02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:24.000]  files reports he did one what Friday night and people were watching it going
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:29.440]  whoa I mean where did Aaron Dykes go and it's just in a couple months and he
[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:32.880]  says the thing about it before is dieting would be you know like torture
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:37.240]  it's the same for me but not when you take the essential fatty acids and the
[02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:40.120]  other things because your body's like oh I'm getting what I need and then you
[02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:44.840]  just eat moderate healthy food and you feel great and I'm gonna I'm gonna do
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:47.880]  it I mean I've launched the TV show and I've got all these other things
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:51.960]  happening and going on but I'm going to announce here on air that I'm gonna
[02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:57.440]  really try to follow your regimen to a tee with the longevity products at
[02:46:57.440 --> 02:47:01.880]  infowarsteam.com and I'm so so very excited about that now I've got
[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:04.720]  callers that have been holding and they're gonna be all over the map but
[02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:07.800]  I'm sure you can comment on these modern-day issues they're raising as well
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:13.840]  let's go to Severin in California thank you California Severin from
[02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:19.360]  California that's a new town I'm like sports and they got California Severin
[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:23.200]  welcome. Thanks for having me I'm actually just have three quick stories I
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:28.240]  want to get through just so everyone can hear them. First off I don't know if you
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:34.040]  guys have heard but the EU has leaked the plans for and this is courtesy of Zero
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:39.680]  Hedge plans for formulating Euro teams in order to I'll read you the quote in
[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:44.840]  order to get that up here in order to in conjunction with Eurobonds EU officials
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:48.000]  have been working on plans to create Euro teams for the Olympics World Cup and
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.920]  Eurovision Song Test officially the effort of support is supposed to
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:55.800]  solidify the fiscal union that will have to occur to make Eurobonds success the
[02:47:55.800 --> 02:47:59.800]  market has already decided they would be so basically I just you know lined up
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:05.480]  with what you've been saying for years second story as I'm sure everyone knows
[02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:09.400]  the markets are rallying today and the primary reason for that I work in the
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:14.000]  stock market so I've got all this news pouring in over the past day we've had
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:20.440]  rumors first Russia was going to bail out the Eurozone. China, Italy's
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:24.640]  openly gone to them yeah. The question is who's gonna bail out China there's a
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:28.280]  report out today that China is basically in the same situation that we were in
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:32.360]  before the housing bubble burst so my commentary on that is maybe
[02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:37.120]  Paul Krugman was right about his alien invasion predictions maybe the
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:41.960]  Martians will bail us out this time. The last one is actually it's
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:47.520]  borderline Enron type news there's a company a Canadian company called Silver
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:52.200]  Corp Metals they're a silver mining company the Canadian company that
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:57.400]  operates primarily in China on the 2nd of September there was an anonymous
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:01.840]  letter sent to the Canadian and US SEC basically accusing them of one and a
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:06.280]  half billion dollars of accounting fraud that send the price of the stock
[02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:10.760]  down about 20 plus percent they refuted the claims they came out with you know
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:14.040]  plenty documentation they posted all their bank statements and everything
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:17.440]  showing that they had all the money they said that they had and the stock
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:22.200]  rallied on the news then yesterday there was another report leaked by some
[02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:26.200]  completely anonymous little known website basically written in the same
[02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:28.800]  style but they denied being associated with it
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:35.200]  set the price down to new 52 week lows and I'm just basically what's happening
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:38.880]  in my opinion that the other thing people that read the the Comex and and all
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:42.160]  the silver and gold manipulators they're losing control of that and so now
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:46.040]  they're taking an aim at a legitimate equities to get people scared out of
[02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:51.520]  gold and silver and it's just it's it's completely ridiculous that an anonymous
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:54.880]  report these days from some you know somebody that's openly shorting the
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:59.240]  stock well that's what wiki leaks is all about is a selectively target people
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:03.040]  you know I'm glad you raised this I'd actually seen this a few weeks ago I
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:07.240]  don't think it's really breaking but I do like a zero hedge like I want to get
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:10.320]  some of the people from zero hedge on that's some of the guests I want to get
[02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:15.480]  on I know that they they do do interviews through nom to gays but secret
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:20.800]  EU plans to create Euro teams leaked and it goes through it and that's the last
[02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:25.560]  step they're already under foreign banking dictatorship but now can't have
[02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:28.920]  the French team can't have the Spanish team can't have the Italian team now
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:33.760]  everything's got to be the Euro team again you can't have your sovereignty
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:37.720]  because under that you might have some identity some rights some liberties it's
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:42.520]  all now under banker control and once it's turned into Euro and North America
[02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:46.400]  and Asia then they merge all of those I'll get Ben Fuchs's take on that on the
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:50.640]  other side glad you raised those points more calls straight ahead after this
[02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:54.680]  break we'll talk to Tim CJ and others pharmacist Ben Fuchs is our guest

[02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:58.680]  make of the of the banking takeover Ben Fuchs pharmacist Ben Fuchs joining us I
[02:54:58.680 --> 02:55:03.880]  mean it's just open banker dictatorship with the very authors of the financial
[02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:08.840]  implosion posing as the saviors and now they say you must cheer the euro we're
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:15.440]  getting rid of your football teams you've got to join the global euro team
[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:19.960]  so that everybody can feel their their not their national patriotism but their
[02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:24.160]  worship of the euro I mean can this get any more transparent it's all about
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:27.600]  centralization Alex and that's the big problem it's all about power being
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:32.160]  centralized in in one's one place away from the people and to centralize
[02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:35.920]  powers and that's what we as individuals have to stand up for we have to
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:40.480]  disengage from the monster the Leviathan the machine and that's why I'm so big on
[02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:44.040]  the power of nutritional supplementation and the power of taking back our health
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:47.780]  hey briefly briefly individually yes bravely because I want to put in a few
[02:55:47.780 --> 02:55:54.400]  calls here I heard you're speaking out in the central California area coming up

[02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:05.800]  got coming up because I've heard a lot of talk and seen a lot of bull but I'm
[02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:09.080]  just glad that Ted Anderson got me in contact with you I don't know six eight
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:12.880]  months ago and everybody else because I study things for a while but then you

[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:21.240]  really try to wade into this up to my eyeballs and certainly get the great
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:25.680]  response the others around me are info wars team com I'm talking the talk it's

[02:56:56.280 --> 02:57:01.320]  looks like they're cooking up the next false flight of terror attack
[02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:06.720]  obviously they they got bin Laden just before the 10th anniversary can't have
[02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:12.680]  the bogeyman out at large for 10 years they're they're shifting from the
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:19.360]  Muslim extremists to the white you know Patriot so now they want to impose the
[02:57:19.360 --> 02:57:25.920]  economy even more so look for you know right after Thanksgiving Black Friday
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:31.840]  model America they've already beta tested the Norway thing you know they're
[02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:36.680]  gonna do something then that will that will impose the economy more plus you
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:41.480]  throw in the second amendment so no I agree with you I agree with you they've
[02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:44.840]  been beta testing and have told cops it is coming I mean how ridiculous

[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:16.040]  becoming so mainstream pharmacist Ben Fuchs that that more more people aren't
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:20.000]  taking vaccines it's like we were talking about with the shingles Alex
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:26.040]  Gardasil the human papillomavirus the HPV virus attacks a weak immune system if
[03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:29.280]  you're eating the standard American diet if you're driving through the fast
[03:02:29.280 --> 03:02:32.440]  food if you're eating a lot of sugar if you're drinking the slurpees and the
[03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:35.480]  coke your immune system is going to be compromised and you are going to be more
[03:02:35.480 --> 03:02:39.840]  prone towards viral infections people get on a nutritional supplement program I
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:44.480]  cannot emphasize that enough disengage from the fast food in the process food

[03:02:56.400 --> 03:03:02.240]  human papillomavirus inoculation the Gardasil inoculation tell them to take it
[03:03:02.240 --> 03:03:06.320]  themselves you don't need it well the crazy part is I've read the insert back
[03:03:06.320 --> 03:03:10.760]  during the trials and after it came out and it says this doesn't protect you
[03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:15.040]  from papillomavirus it's not been proven it's thought it might help with a few
[03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:19.360]  strains then you learn there's thousands of strains 300 plus they think can kill
[03:03:19.360 --> 03:03:23.000]  you it's one of the rarest forms of cancer they admit it's normally auto
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:30.240]  immune suppressed people who can get the form of cervical cancer and they
[03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:34.080]  admit it causes all sorts of immune problems and now I was reading 15
[03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:39.680]  million American girls have taken it and it is just absolutely linked all these
[03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:44.040]  vaccines are screwing up your immune system where your white blood cells
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:48.040]  can't recognize cancer in the future and then and then there's a new electron
[03:03:48.040 --> 03:03:51.920]  microscope video out today the Daily Mail has I meant to play it meant perhaps
[03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:56.800]  tonight I'll cover in the nightly news and it shows white blood cells eating new
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:04:00.200]  cancers well what the scientists have told me I want you to briefly comment on
[03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:03.680]  this is that under electron microscopes when you've taken vaccines over and
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:07.480]  over again you lose your immunity your body stops fighting and that's what the
[03:04:07.480 --> 03:04:14.280]  HPV or the flu shot showed two years ago in the Canadian government study that
[03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:18.880]  when you took the H the H1N1 shot it lessened your immune response to
[03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:24.240]  regular flu by 50% you want to up-regulate your body's immune system you
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:26.840]  never want to do something that's going to down-regulate it you know Alex the
