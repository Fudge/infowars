[00:00:05.014 --> 00:00:09.839]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:11.440]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.982]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:17.166]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:21.270]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:32.776]  We're live.
[00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:36.718]  It's Wednesday, the 14th day of September 2011.
[00:00:36.718 --> 00:00:41.980]  We're going to be live here for at least the next three hours.
[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.861]  Then, of course, I'll be back tonight.
[00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:50.904]  Back this evening.
[00:00:50.904 --> 00:01:00.488]  I'll be back this evening, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time with InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:13.307]  And I like doing two live shows or two tape shows, sometimes a day, because we can cover the news happening while we're live on the radio.
[00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:18.011]  And then, of course, that develops after the show into the evening.
[00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:24.015]  And last night we covered just the amazing solar flares, amongst other things.
[00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:36.638]  that are being thrown off by the sun and the fact that statistically
[00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:50.635]  Things like that could be much more dangerous than even foreign armies because there are more than a thousand nuclear reactors on the face of the globe, in the Pentagon, the Department of Energy.
[00:01:50.635 --> 00:02:01.464]  The federal government admits that a large coronal mass ejection hitting the earth directly on would cause the shutdown and meltdown
[00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:04.646]  of all of those reactors.
[00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:05.566]  This is the U.S.
[00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:07.828]  government admitting this, and we covered it last night.
[00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:08.888]  It's now been archived.
[00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:16.172]  It's archived shortly after the show streams at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:28.918]  All right, I am attempting to be calm today, but I don't feel like I'm really articulating properly the magnitude of the situation we face.
[00:02:30.962 --> 00:02:43.667]  Europe is being systematically bankrupted, systematically folded in to the private banking dictatorship.
[00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:51.470]  Countries tend to respond, individuals tend to respond to an open army rolling in in different uniforms with different flags.
[00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:53.876]  And to fight back.
[00:02:53.876 --> 00:03:13.573]  But as long as it's done through a corporate-type process with men in suits, and you're told by the media that the fraudsters own, and by the politicians that they've bought and paid for, that it's legitimate, most people just say, oh, that's a bunch of red tape and a bunch of bureaucracy, I don't care.
[00:03:13.573 --> 00:03:19.278]  But if we can get this simple fact across to people, we have a chance to rebuild our civilization.
[00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:45.776]  I've got economic numbers here that even if you take the Fed's cooked, spun, disinformation that tries to put lipstick on a pig and sell you that the economy isn't as bad as it really is, even with their cooked numbers, their phony, bunk numbers, pay rates in this country are now at 1996 levels.
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.582]  Housing has slid below 1996 levels.
[00:03:54.582 --> 00:03:56.663]  We'll go over some of those numbers today.
[00:03:56.663 --> 00:04:02.806]  And of course, it's far worse than that.
[00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:05.607]  Americans, a lot of them are hardworking.
[00:04:05.607 --> 00:04:07.008]  There's also a lot of lazy people.
[00:04:07.008 --> 00:04:12.330]  But for hardworking Americans, the statistics are clear.
[00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.091]  Working on average 70 hours a week.
[00:04:15.848 --> 00:04:17.929]  Two to three jobs.
[00:04:17.929 --> 00:04:21.932]  All to keep that illusion of middle class going.
[00:04:21.932 --> 00:04:24.454]  It doesn't matter how hard you work.
[00:04:24.454 --> 00:04:26.835]  On average, it doesn't matter what you do.
[00:04:26.835 --> 00:04:29.557]  The standard of living is going down.
[00:04:29.557 --> 00:04:35.021]  The oxygen is being sucked out of the room.
[00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:36.042]  We're gonna get into the economy.
[00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:39.923]  We're going to get into the police state and the latest military developments.
[00:04:39.923 --> 00:04:45.546]  Also, more youth killed in Mexico every year from violence than car wrecks.
[00:04:45.546 --> 00:04:48.608]  That's a big deal.
[00:04:48.608 --> 00:04:54.332]  That's all coming up today.
[00:04:54.332 --> 00:04:58.675]  And of course, we've got pharmacist Ben Fuchs on talking about the attacks on supplements.
[00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.614]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.614 --> 00:05:08.858]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.858 --> 00:05:13.663]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:13.663 --> 00:05:20.070]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.313]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:23.153]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:23.153 --> 00:05:23.654]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.654 --> 00:05:24.314]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.314 --> 00:05:25.595]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:27.836]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.744 --> 00:05:43.867]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:49.013]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:49.013 --> 00:05:58.143]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:02.093 --> 00:06:06.054]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:06.054 --> 00:06:14.916]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:19.557]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:19.557 --> 00:06:30.359]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:40.521]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:45.943]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:45.943 --> 00:06:53.424]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:53.424 --> 00:06:55.845]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:07:00.097 --> 00:07:01.258]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:07:01.258 --> 00:07:08.206]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:07:08.206 --> 00:07:10.749]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:15.935]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:07:16.115 --> 00:07:19.156]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:21.477]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:07:21.477 --> 00:07:27.739]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:31.120]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.882]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:07:36.882 --> 00:07:38.542]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:39.823]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:07:39.823 --> 00:07:42.503]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:07:42.503 --> 00:07:43.924]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:07:44.184 --> 00:07:46.726]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:07:46.726 --> 00:07:51.350]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.933]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:07:53.933 --> 00:07:57.816]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:07:57.816 --> 00:07:58.817]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:08:05.216 --> 00:08:10.058]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.058 --> 00:08:11.639]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:13.180]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.382]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.382 --> 00:08:27.227]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.227 --> 00:08:29.708]  Okay, my friends, we are live.
[00:08:29.708 --> 00:08:31.229]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:37.413]  It is Wednesday, the 14th day of September, 2011.
[00:08:37.413 --> 00:08:44.538]  I want you to listen to me very, very carefully for just a moment, okay?
[00:08:44.538 --> 00:08:47.119]  Before I get into all the other news.
[00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:50.221]  There is a new dawn of media.
[00:08:50.221 --> 00:08:52.603]  A new age of media is here.
[00:08:52.603 --> 00:09:00.988]  Just like the age of the horse and buggy started going out by 1910 and was completely gone by the 1930s in the industrialized world.
[00:09:03.444 --> 00:09:11.332]  The age of mainline dinosaur corporate whore media is over.
[00:09:11.332 --> 00:09:14.396]  And the new landscape is being forged.
[00:09:14.396 --> 00:09:19.902]  Now, because of this... Because of this...
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:37.267]  You have got government and big corporate media coming in with the FCC and others trying to move to start restricting alternative media, grassroots media, TV, radio, you name it, on the web.
[00:09:37.267 --> 00:09:39.208]  I don't think that's going to be successful.
[00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:42.409]  The people have had a taste of a million channels.
[00:09:42.409 --> 00:09:43.250]  They're hungry for it.
[00:09:44.901 --> 00:09:50.028]  So more and more, the playing field is being leveled.
[00:09:50.028 --> 00:09:55.375]  It's still completely tilted, to a great extent, but more and more, the balance is shifting.
[00:09:56.263 --> 00:09:58.625]  To a real fight of ideas.
[00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:01.567]  That's why the system's going right to authoritarianism.
[00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:04.629]  Right to arresting people who demonstrate for no reason.
[00:10:04.629 --> 00:10:08.791]  Right to trying to intimidate patriots and anti-globalists.
[00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:12.994]  They don't care if you've got some leftist view or mainline right-wing view, that's fine.
[00:10:12.994 --> 00:10:18.238]  If you see outside the box and see the larger controlling system outside of it, you are the enemy.
[00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:26.373]  And I wasn't going to start the show with this, but this morning I read an article by Keith Oberman put out by Al Gore's outfit.
[00:10:26.373 --> 00:10:32.636]  That's where Oberman works now, over at the TV network on cable that Al Gore runs.
[00:10:32.636 --> 00:10:34.157]  And I've looked up the numbers for it.
[00:10:34.157 --> 00:10:38.819]  I mean, you're talking about maybe 100,000 viewers on their top show.
[00:10:38.819 --> 00:10:42.561]  I mean, this radio show absolutely dwarfs it.
[00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:47.283]  Something like Rush Limbaugh, probably 100 times bigger than Al Gore's TV network.
[00:10:49.212 --> 00:10:53.713]  Because people see Rush Limbaugh as the alternative over the last 20 years.
[00:10:53.713 --> 00:10:56.934]  But that's another level of control.
[00:10:56.934 --> 00:11:10.737]  Now, today, there was a article put out by Keith Oberman in Al Gore's outfit.
[00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:12.738]  In fact, it's in there on Tim's desk, if you'll bring it to me.
[00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:15.078]  I left it in there on Tim's desk in the back.
[00:11:15.078 --> 00:11:17.859]  If you'll bring me that article, somebody, thank you, it's on his desk.
[00:11:17.859 --> 00:11:18.639]  Tim Fouchier in the back.
[00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:26.775]  And it was Keith Olbermann saying, aha, Glenn Beck is a failure.
[00:11:26.775 --> 00:11:45.420]  We guess his bandwidth costs are a million dollars a month, and Glenn Beck's only making $27 million off of his Glenn Beck TV, according to his 280,000 subscribers.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.520]  Now, I did some checking.
[00:11:48.075 --> 00:12:01.378]  I went and put in Glenn Beck TV versus PrisonPlanet.TV, and on average, on an average day, PrisonPlanet.TV has more bandwidth, more traffic, more visitors than Glenn Beck TV.
[00:12:01.378 --> 00:12:07.999]  There's some big spikes when he goes to Israel or has a big national program, so overall, it's bigger.
[00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:08.300]  About 20%.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.020]  It's got graphs right there.
[00:12:11.149 --> 00:12:13.951]  I know what our bandwidth really cost.
[00:12:13.951 --> 00:12:14.931]  $40,000 a month or so.
[00:12:14.931 --> 00:12:16.572]  Still a big nut to crack.
[00:12:16.572 --> 00:12:19.834]  I know we have a fraction of the subscribers that Glenn Beck does.
[00:12:19.834 --> 00:12:31.280]  But I can go look and see, wow, right off the Alexa.com, that we are using almost as much traffic and bandwidth as Glenn Beck is.
[00:12:32.566 --> 00:12:37.890]  So he's got a lot more members than we do, but they're not really going over there mainly because they're an older audience.
[00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:46.998]  That's why that's his problem is he's got a really old demographic, but they will kind of pay a tithe to alternative media as they see it and supporting.
[00:12:46.998 --> 00:12:58.747]  And Glenn Beck's not perfect, but he is alternative media compared to Al Gore and George Soros and the TV network that they run.
[00:12:58.747 --> 00:12:59.108]  And so
[00:13:01.854 --> 00:13:15.782]  The reason I raised all of this is because here we are, the true, bonafide, real grassroots media network system trying to get up on our legs.
[00:13:15.782 --> 00:13:16.983]  And we need the support.
[00:13:16.983 --> 00:13:19.384]  We need you to spread the word.
[00:13:19.384 --> 00:13:20.185]  We need you to
[00:13:21.943 --> 00:13:24.264]  Become PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers.
[00:13:24.264 --> 00:13:26.766]  We need you to buy subscriptions for Friends and Family.
[00:13:26.766 --> 00:13:35.431]  We need you to download and save the news show and give it to Friends and Family, especially the younger, computer-savvy people.
[00:13:35.431 --> 00:13:37.472]  The war is on.
[00:13:37.472 --> 00:13:42.536]  And InfoWars.com has an extremely diverse audience.
[00:13:42.536 --> 00:13:43.936]  We have a giant audience.
[00:13:43.936 --> 00:13:45.177]  The majority is below 35.
[00:13:46.923 --> 00:13:48.763]  But we have extremely old people listening.
[00:13:48.763 --> 00:13:51.384]  We have black, white, women, men.
[00:13:51.384 --> 00:13:53.684]  It's a very diverse.
[00:13:53.684 --> 00:13:55.945]  We've got all the Google Analytics numbers.
[00:13:55.945 --> 00:13:59.525]  We've got ratings from radio stations.
[00:13:59.525 --> 00:14:09.507]  This is a truly transcendent radio slash TV transmission because we're outside the box.
[00:14:09.507 --> 00:14:14.508]  And if you go to alexainfowars.com, Dwarfs, Glenn Beck's website, you can just go look at it.
[00:14:15.505 --> 00:14:15.765]  I don't
[00:14:32.794 --> 00:14:34.715]  But InfoWars is one operation.
[00:14:34.715 --> 00:14:36.116]  Then we have Prison Planet.
[00:14:36.116 --> 00:14:37.337]  We have the YouTube channels.
[00:14:37.337 --> 00:14:40.479]  We have our material that's copied everywhere.
[00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:47.743]  We are truly a leading force in alternative media becoming the new mainstream.
[00:14:47.743 --> 00:14:51.366]  And that is such an incredible responsibility.
[00:14:51.366 --> 00:14:58.970]  So here's the kernel of information out of everything I've just said that's most important.
[00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.791]  Listen to me carefully.
[00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:01.392]  Al Gore
[00:15:02.585 --> 00:15:11.989]  Glenn Beck is racing to try to copy what we've done in the last decade.
[00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:20.772]  Glenn Beck is racing to copy the model that we didn't invent, we just trailblazed.
[00:15:20.772 --> 00:15:23.493]  Because it was the only way we could get to people.
[00:15:23.493 --> 00:15:30.516]  Because we were blocked out from the big traditional, arrogant, CNN, Fox, New York Times type people.
[00:15:33.041 --> 00:15:38.864]  And now that old arrogant system is realizing that they're becoming inconsequential.
[00:15:38.864 --> 00:15:40.445]  In fact, I was breaking some of the numbers down.
[00:15:40.445 --> 00:15:44.968]  Drudge drives more traffic on news than Facebook and Twitter combined.
[00:15:44.968 --> 00:15:48.830]  It's about five times what the New York Times does.
[00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:59.577]  And if we are now about a third as big as the Drudge report just on our two websites combined, you can combine those numbers and look at it, we're bigger than the New York Times now.
[00:16:00.575 --> 00:16:02.037]  When it comes to driving news.
[00:16:02.037 --> 00:16:05.961]  I mean, it's an emperor's new clothes.
[00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:12.849]  I mean, the New York Times makes half a billion dollars a year.
[00:16:12.849 --> 00:16:13.730]  This operation.
[00:16:15.543 --> 00:16:18.544]  Can't make $5 million to fund itself.
[00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:28.129]  Glenn Beck, with all of his operations, can make $70-$80 million a year, and we conservatively have half of the audience he does.
[00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:33.431]  Web-wise, totally dominate, but you add in his radio and all the rest of it.
[00:16:33.431 --> 00:16:42.275]  We are half as big on reaching people as Glenn Beck, and we make a fraction of the money he does.
[00:16:42.275 --> 00:16:44.616]  And again, we need that money
[00:16:45.646 --> 00:16:48.387]  I need to hire the extra IT people I need.
[00:16:48.387 --> 00:16:50.388]  I need to get the extra servers.
[00:16:50.388 --> 00:16:58.390]  I need to get this platform to the next level so I can then hire a bunch of reporters and anchors and go 24 hours a day.
[00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.010]  That's the plan.
[00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:12.074]  And then get on these cable systems and everywhere and absolutely kick the hind end of the dying corporate media on their turf while we take over the web, which we've already done.
[00:17:12.074 --> 00:17:12.974]  Here's an example.
[00:17:12.974 --> 00:17:14.295]  Al Gore, I was looking at his numbers.
[00:17:14.835 --> 00:17:21.118]  Cannot even get 100,000 viewers on his TV network even when he gets big sporting events.
[00:17:21.118 --> 00:17:25.720]  No one will watch it.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.881]  So what is he doing?
[00:17:26.881 --> 00:17:28.921]  He has a free 24-hour video
[00:17:32.642 --> 00:17:33.002]  I think?
[00:17:51.628 --> 00:17:55.231]  And we're going to play a trailer of his propaganda here in a moment.
[00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:59.214]  And it is all of our truth and information spun back at us.
[00:17:59.214 --> 00:18:03.578]  See, when we hit him with the fact that they're a bunch of hoaxers, it's killing him.
[00:18:03.578 --> 00:18:06.280]  Al Gore has admitted that he's being laughed at everywhere.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.961]  And you're a moron!
[00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:17.268]  You think you're going to come on the Internet, and after all your years of arrogance, and everybody's just going to listen to you, you big, fat liar?
[00:18:17.268 --> 00:18:20.071]  You didn't invent the Internet, you con artist.
[00:18:20.771 --> 00:18:30.240]  You got up there and said NAFTA and GATT was a quote good deal Larry on Larry King Live and laughed at Ross Perot and said it would double our jobs in 10 years.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:40.930]  How about 82% of our industrial system gone and our economy and pay systems at 1996 levels, the federal government admits, with inflation on top of it.
[00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.392]  We've gone backwards.
[00:18:42.392 --> 00:18:44.433]  The giant sucking sound that is globalism.
[00:18:45.202 --> 00:18:46.543]  You didn't invent the internet.
[00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:48.344]  You knew Naftingat would kill us.
[00:18:48.344 --> 00:18:54.629]  You're in there on your little promo video I saw, we're gonna play when we come back, going, oh my gosh, big coal, big oil.
[00:18:54.629 --> 00:18:57.491]  You know, you're putting out that carbon dioxide's natural and good.
[00:18:57.491 --> 00:18:58.191]  You're liars.
[00:18:58.191 --> 00:18:59.512]  You're a hoax.
[00:18:59.512 --> 00:19:01.754]  Now let me tell you something, ManBearPig.
[00:19:01.754 --> 00:19:07.058]  You're the biggest owner of Occidental Petroleum drilling off the coast of California.
[00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:12.422]  Your daddy, Senator Gore, ran scams with the Russians and others, and Arm & Hammer.
[00:19:14.036 --> 00:19:16.317]  You're a monopoly man.
[00:19:16.317 --> 00:19:23.121]  You want to put down oil companies when you're an oil baron that drills in the rainforest of Brazil on record?
[00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.902]  And your investments go up when you shut our oil systems down here?
[00:19:25.902 --> 00:19:27.003]  Hey, punk!
[00:19:27.003 --> 00:19:30.384]  I'm here to tell the world and show them the documents that BP
[00:19:31.929 --> 00:19:35.390]  Shell, all of them, are funding your climate scam thing.
[00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:42.031]  Ken Lay came up with it with you, you monster, in 1995, and it's on record!
[00:19:42.031 --> 00:19:44.531]  What's so horrible is this guy's got palaces everywhere.
[00:19:44.531 --> 00:19:50.592]  Helicopters, jets, the Rothschilds do, and they lecture us about taking a hot bath or having light bulbs.
[00:19:50.592 --> 00:19:58.494]  These are stinking authoritarians that want a piece of all human activity, and you're a hoax, you degenerate piece of garbage!
[00:19:58.494 --> 00:19:59.254]  You trash!
[00:19:59.554 --> 00:20:00.695]  You ugly maggot!
[00:20:17.773 --> 00:20:20.816]  Get fluoride and heavy metals out of your water and your body.
[00:20:20.816 --> 00:20:28.002]  Use it to neutralize deadly inorganic particles like lead, aluminum, even mercury, and remove these accumulated poisons from your body.
[00:20:28.002 --> 00:20:35.288]  Go to WaterWebinar.com, a water secret so powerful some have called it the number one threat to the entire New World Order health agenda.
[00:20:35.288 --> 00:20:38.651]  It was even used during Chernobyl to clean up nuclear contamination.
[00:20:38.651 --> 00:20:46.357]  Go to WaterWebinar.com now and sign up for free to find out how to turn the worst water on this planet into pristine, clear drinking water

[00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:01.719]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:01.719 --> 00:22:12.375]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:22:12.375 --> 00:22:16.481]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[00:22:16.821 --> 00:22:19.563]  But we can't do that without your help.
[00:22:19.563 --> 00:22:30.851]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:34.353]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:38.856]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom
[00:22:38.916 --> 00:22:40.477]  Freedom and darkness.
[00:22:40.477 --> 00:22:50.363]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:22:50.363 --> 00:22:51.864]  The war is here.
[00:22:51.864 --> 00:22:53.765]  It's an info war.
[00:22:53.765 --> 00:22:58.168]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:23:01.158 --> 00:23:06.862]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[00:23:06.862 --> 00:23:11.024]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[00:23:11.024 --> 00:23:16.787]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[00:23:16.787 --> 00:23:22.411]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:29.317]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[00:23:29.317 --> 00:23:37.024]  Go to SurvivalRx.com today and see the amazing line of storable supplements they have to protect the ones you love.
[00:23:37.024 --> 00:23:45.832]  The owners of SurvivalRx.com have been in sports nutrition for over a decade, and they realize the need for long-term storable vitamins.
[00:23:46.252 --> 00:23:52.615]  The result is a triple nitrogen flushing method which allows these vitamins to maintain their strength for decades.
[00:23:52.615 --> 00:23:56.836]  Again, go to SurvivalRx.com at SurvivalRx.com
[00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:30.754]  Okay, I'm gonna get into the news.
[00:24:30.754 --> 00:24:35.681]  But the news is how the news is changing.
[00:24:35.681 --> 00:24:36.903]  That's the issue here.
[00:24:38.183 --> 00:24:53.272]  That there are tectonic changes taking place in the media landscape, and now anybody can set up a TV network, anybody can set up a radio show, and anybody can basically pick it up and have it delivered to them.
[00:24:53.272 --> 00:25:03.159]  You've got a lot of people that still watch mainline television, but more and more, if you look at the statistics, young people get almost no news or information or even entertainment from TV.
[00:25:03.999 --> 00:25:07.803]  They are going to the internet and that full spectrum of ideas.
[00:25:07.803 --> 00:25:18.753]  Now, in that world of a level playing field, we dominate and destroy the competition because we don't play games, we tell it like it is.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:35.911]  And what's happening is Al Gore is trying to take old mainline dumbed down people and their money and their energy and use it to finance an invasion of cyberspace with his hoaxes and lies and disinformation.
[00:25:35.911 --> 00:25:39.193]  I mean, next he's going to say Santa Claus or Jesus.
[00:25:39.193 --> 00:25:44.637]  He already says he invented the Internet and you got to pay him money or carbon dioxide is going to kill you.
[00:25:44.637 --> 00:25:47.880]  And my issue here is you talk about liars.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.402]  You talk about running a hoax.
[00:25:54.332 --> 00:26:00.137]  I've got an article here put out by Keith Oberman.
[00:26:00.137 --> 00:26:03.419]  How profitable is Glenn Beck's new web TV venture?
[00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:11.586]  Glenn Beck is taking his franchise of conservative commentary to the web, streaming the first episode of his two-hour show exclusively to paying online subscribers.
[00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:19.793]  A former Fox News star already has 230,000 subscribers to pay between $5 and $10 per month for access to his TV system.
[00:26:19.793 --> 00:26:20.994]  According to the Wall Street Journal,
[00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:31.583]  Glenn Beck Television analyst Rich Greenwald estimates, registration required, that Beck could generate $27 million in subscription revenue within the year.
[00:26:31.583 --> 00:26:41.926]  And then it goes on with Oberman saying that he thinks that that's how much it costs to do what he's doing and that his bandwidth is $1 million a month.
[00:26:44.186 --> 00:27:02.753]  No way, because if you go to Alexa.com and put in Glenn Beck TV versus PrisonPlanet.TV, you'll notice that Glenn Beck TV on average is below us for viewers and traffic, and when he has big special events it spikes way above us when he's got full-page ads on Drudge and hundreds of other places.
[00:27:02.753 --> 00:27:07.794]  So, all of that is going on.
[00:27:07.794 --> 00:27:10.215]  And what does Al Gore do?
[00:27:10.215 --> 00:27:11.676]  Al Gore toddles out
[00:27:12.918 --> 00:27:18.900]  And attempts to declare himself the arbiter of all truth and reality.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.320]  And of course, Glenn Beck's doing that too.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.581]  The truth lives here, tomorrow's network today.
[00:27:24.581 --> 00:27:28.082]  Well, we're tomorrow's network 10 years ago.
[00:27:28.082 --> 00:27:30.583]  And the truth really does live here.
[00:27:30.583 --> 00:27:33.304]  You notice all of our terms, all of our ideas.
[00:27:33.304 --> 00:27:35.584]  1776, the spirit of 1776.
[00:27:35.584 --> 00:27:37.905]  You notice, you hear it all imitated.
[00:27:39.016 --> 00:27:52.086]  All what I've organically put forward is snatched by these people, and that's the greatest form of admiration and compliment is to be imitated.
[00:27:52.086 --> 00:27:59.491]  But I don't like Al Gore taking our ideas, our systems, exposing their hoaxes and turning it back around against us.
[00:27:59.491 --> 00:28:02.533]  We're gonna go to break and come back and play that clip and go over it.
[00:28:02.533 --> 00:28:04.535]  But here's the issue.
[00:28:05.754 --> 00:28:11.439]  We already on a fair playing field in cyberspace have dominated.
[00:28:11.439 --> 00:28:15.042]  But, when it comes to traditional media, we're not even on the radar screen.
[00:28:17.694 --> 00:28:27.318]  And that's why it's so important if you are a viewer or if you are a listener, and you get 95% of what we do for free, to become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:28:27.318 --> 00:28:41.625]  It is a revolutionary vote for true, hardcore, alternative media, and so that at the ground floor of the establishment, figuring out that the internet is the new wide-open TV channel,
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:55.625]  Right as they pump all their money and invade it with the fake left, the fake right, and everything in between, it is more important than ever to get firmly behind Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:55.625 --> 00:28:57.046]  It is a vote for liberty.
[00:28:57.046 --> 00:28:58.546]  It is a vote for freedom.
[00:28:58.546 --> 00:29:00.307]  It is a vote for alternative views.
[00:29:00.307 --> 00:29:03.288]  It is a vote to see us grow and energize.
[00:29:03.288 --> 00:29:04.649]  You've seen where we've come from.
[00:29:06.055 --> 00:29:07.876]  And I have stepped up to the plate.
[00:29:07.876 --> 00:29:09.798]  I have not wanted the responsibility.
[00:29:09.798 --> 00:29:12.560]  I knew I could have done this 10 years ago, I talked about it.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:20.286]  And only in the last few have I decided to try to generate the capital, put in the hours, and do it.
[00:29:20.286 --> 00:29:22.027]  I don't like managing people.
[00:29:22.027 --> 00:29:26.170]  I don't like having to be an editor and look over everybody's shoulder to make sure it's accurate to my view.
[00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:27.912]  But I'm doing it.
[00:29:27.912 --> 00:29:32.615]  I'm up here 10 o'clock many nights to really try to get in the face of the globalists.
[00:29:32.615 --> 00:29:35.498]  And when you become a PrisonPlanet.tv member,
[00:29:36.525 --> 00:29:38.427]  You help put us on the field.
[00:29:38.427 --> 00:29:41.029]  The helmet, the football pads, the whole nine yards.
[00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:43.512]  You sponsor us onto the field.
[00:29:43.512 --> 00:29:49.898]  I guarantee you, two years from now, we're going to be number one undisputed champion.
[00:29:49.898 --> 00:29:51.279]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:53.822]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.822 --> 00:29:56.484]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.384 --> 00:30:04.947]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.947 --> 00:30:05.848]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.848 --> 00:30:09.291]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.291 --> 00:30:10.151]  Number 2.
[00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:15.035]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.035 --> 00:30:15.775]  It's true.
[00:30:15.775 --> 00:30:20.659]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.659 --> 00:30:21.480]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.062]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.062 --> 00:30:28.765]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.965 --> 00:30:29.766]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.766 --> 00:30:32.528]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.528 --> 00:30:36.212]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.212 --> 00:30:36.993]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.993 --> 00:30:41.136]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.136 --> 00:30:45.901]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.181 --> 00:30:50.362]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.362 --> 00:30:52.143]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:52.143 --> 00:30:54.403]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:54.403 --> 00:30:57.224]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:30:57.224 --> 00:31:01.765]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:01.765 --> 00:31:04.946]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Schenck and he foods the right.
[00:31:05.206 --> 00:31:07.768]  I have e-foods for my own emergency food supply.
[00:31:07.768 --> 00:31:10.830]  You know, Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:11.650]  Very different.
[00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:21.597]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season, and we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[00:31:21.597 --> 00:31:23.839]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:27.962]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[00:31:27.962 --> 00:31:31.544]  The huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's mind.
[00:31:31.584 --> 00:31:37.946]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[00:31:37.946 --> 00:31:39.806]  So everyone needs food security.
[00:31:39.806 --> 00:31:43.707]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from eFoodsDirect.
[00:31:43.707 --> 00:31:46.928]  That's right, every order gets free shipping starting September 6th.
[00:31:46.928 --> 00:31:53.230]  Get stocked up with the best storable foods out there with eFoodsDirect and be prepared for any emergency before it happens.
[00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.911]  To take advantage of this special call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:01.178 --> 00:32:02.880]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:08.185]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:32:08.185 --> 00:32:09.727]  Saving means to make money.
[00:32:09.727 --> 00:32:18.515]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:32:19.236 --> 00:32:26.781]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:32:26.781 --> 00:32:34.786]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:40.009]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:32:40.009 --> 00:32:42.170]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:44.952 --> 00:32:48.155]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:32:48.155 --> 00:32:50.537]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:50.537 --> 00:32:52.659]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:33:11.397 --> 00:33:26.721]  It is absolutely essential that somebody who really talks about all the issues, that talks about the eugenics, the cancer viruses and the vaccines, the radioactive isotopes and fluoride added to the water by the government, the police training for gun confiscation.
[00:33:26.721 --> 00:33:30.842]  This is the type of information I've been covering for 16 years.
[00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:33.523]  The global government imploding the world financial system.
[00:33:34.662 --> 00:33:36.003]  Starting wars in the Middle East.
[00:33:36.003 --> 00:33:44.612]  We predicted it all, we laid it out, and it's important that we don't just sit here and stay the same size we've been.
[00:33:44.612 --> 00:33:51.659]  Because we're reaching so many people, because we've been growing so fast in the face of this tyranny, I have hit our afterburners.
[00:33:53.134 --> 00:33:57.036]  But I need you to keep refilling our fuel tank.
[00:33:57.036 --> 00:34:00.979]  And more importantly, I need you to spread the word about this information.
[00:34:00.979 --> 00:34:03.060]  We've got the word of mouth.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.081]  That's where we've come from nothing.
[00:34:05.081 --> 00:34:08.623]  But it's time, in the face of this tyranny, to up our game 110%.
[00:34:11.266 --> 00:34:17.408]  It is so easy to go to PrisonPlanet.tv and sign up for a month or sign up for a year and get three months free.
[00:34:17.408 --> 00:34:18.049]  It's $5.95.
[00:34:18.049 --> 00:34:22.010]  There's no junior and then senior program.
[00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.251]  There's just $5.95.
[00:34:24.251 --> 00:34:30.774]  We're working on an iPhone app that subscribers will have, so it'll have a bunch of extra features on your iPhone.
[00:34:31.784 --> 00:34:36.007]  You can already see it on droids and most other systems via PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:39.749]  We have the free iPhone app to hear the audio stream of the show.
[00:34:39.749 --> 00:34:44.992]  That's at InfoWars.com on the right hand side, a link to get that.
[00:34:44.992 --> 00:34:46.353]  We are doing everything we can.
[00:34:48.308 --> 00:34:51.009]  We're doing everything we can to get the word out.
[00:34:51.009 --> 00:34:57.033]  I'm doing everything I can to organize the system to try to run this operation and go to the next level.
[00:34:57.033 --> 00:34:59.674]  But we need your help.
[00:34:59.674 --> 00:35:01.875]  I don't want to just grow at the level we're growing.
[00:35:01.875 --> 00:35:11.400]  I don't want to just sustain and then have to penny pinch and worry about this server or that server or can I hire reporters or can I get this or that done.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.502]  I can only do it if you support us.
[00:35:14.502 --> 00:35:15.903]  And I know there are millions of you.
[00:35:16.363 --> 00:35:19.024]  Out there who are not PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:35:19.024 --> 00:35:24.705]  It is a tiny fraction of those out there that listen that are actual PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:35:24.705 --> 00:35:32.948]  And you have really helped us grow to the next level in the face of the globalists and increase the quality of our information, the look of it, everything.
[00:35:34.253 --> 00:35:37.216]  And my crew is great.
[00:35:37.216 --> 00:35:38.597]  We're trying to hire more people.
[00:35:38.597 --> 00:35:44.003]  We're moving forward, but we need you to become a PrisonPlanet.TV member.
[00:35:44.003 --> 00:35:46.285]  We're working on getting it on the tabletop systems.
[00:35:46.285 --> 00:35:48.447]  That's going well.
[00:35:48.447 --> 00:35:53.952]  Like I said, we've got some networks and cable systems that want to pick it up, but we're not ready for that yet.
[00:35:53.952 --> 00:35:55.454]  We're just beta testing right now.
[00:35:56.014 --> 00:36:06.925]  The nightly news I'm doing and trying to get enough members to finance that to then go to the next level of codifying it, putting in a satellite uplink, the upload systems that most systems are going to get it from.
[00:36:06.925 --> 00:36:12.410]  There's a lot of investment and yes, we're going to have a money bomb just like we did last year in the middle of October.
[00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:18.456]  We're going to shoot videos and show you all the changes that have happened here and what we've done and where we're going.
[00:36:18.456 --> 00:36:20.357]  The problem is it all rides on me.
[00:36:21.138 --> 00:36:22.579]  And I've got to call the shots.
[00:36:22.579 --> 00:36:24.641]  I've got to oversee the articles.
[00:36:24.641 --> 00:36:25.762]  I've got to do everything.
[00:36:25.762 --> 00:36:27.643]  I've hired some really great people.
[00:36:27.643 --> 00:36:32.407]  But still, I've got to act as chief cook, bottle washer, editor.
[00:36:32.407 --> 00:36:36.290]  Because, you know, everybody makes mistakes and you've got to have somebody else look at it.
[00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.192]  You know, who's as informed as they are, or even more so.
[00:36:39.192 --> 00:36:40.533]  But you can see what's happening.
[00:36:40.533 --> 00:36:41.774]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:36:41.774 --> 00:36:42.975]  This is a great honor.
[00:36:42.975 --> 00:36:44.116]  It is wonderful.
[00:36:44.116 --> 00:36:46.698]  But it's also exhausting to take on this marathon.
[00:36:47.418 --> 00:36:51.080]  And so, please, be with us on this.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.921]  Be part of this with us.
[00:36:53.921 --> 00:36:58.983]  You are not a spectator or a bystander in subscription media.
[00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:01.224]  You are financing and building
[00:37:03.496 --> 00:37:14.206]  Just like the Huffington Post went from nowhere to gigantic as big as the Drudge Report, they did that off of donations and support and subscriptions from liberals.
[00:37:14.206 --> 00:37:21.092]  And of course they betrayed them and are pro-war and pro-torture and handed it over to AOL and it's now falling apart.
[00:37:21.092 --> 00:37:24.155]  We will never do that while I'm alive.
[00:37:24.155 --> 00:37:27.658]  This operation will stay under Alex Jones.
[00:37:27.658 --> 00:37:28.699]  This is my public will.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:35.187]  I've told my reporters and crew I want it to continue on if I get imprisoned or killed with this exact information.
[00:37:35.187 --> 00:37:36.868]  We're not selling it to anybody.
[00:37:36.868 --> 00:37:38.550]  You couldn't anyways.
[00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:43.576]  Because it's about truth and information and no globalist would even want it.
[00:37:43.576 --> 00:37:44.958]  And if they did, we wouldn't sell it.
[00:37:44.958 --> 00:37:48.582]  So again, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:48.582 --> 00:37:49.964]  I want to rival
[00:37:52.625 --> 00:37:57.653]  Glenn Beck, who was the New World Order's answer to us ten years ago, eight years ago.
[00:37:57.653 --> 00:38:01.979]  Execs wanted to meet with me, you know, off record, put on the journalist cap.
[00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:03.121]  People said, well, tell us who they are.
[00:38:03.121 --> 00:38:07.288]  If you ever give up a source in business and confidence or media, you never get a source again.
[00:38:08.018 --> 00:38:09.919]  But, you know, it's like this is off the record meeting.
[00:38:09.919 --> 00:38:12.340]  One time, well, I'm not going to even get into it.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:16.263]  And it's like, look, you'll have a TV show out of this with your radio show.
[00:38:16.263 --> 00:38:19.624]  You'll have book deals and you're going to be the next Rush Limbaugh.
[00:38:19.624 --> 00:38:21.626]  And I said, I know you tell all the girls that.
[00:38:21.626 --> 00:38:24.667]  They're like, no, we're serious.
[00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:31.591]  Now, you want to and I was told this repeatedly, actually in three meetings by different people over the years, it must be a script they follow.
[00:38:31.591 --> 00:38:36.734]  Do you want to be on a crusade that's going to fail or do you want to be a star?
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:50.169]  Actually, actually four times they said similar things because there was even a local radio exec one time that said something similar, the more I think about it, that I had meetings with.
[00:38:50.169 --> 00:38:51.210]  And so I've been there.
[00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.512]  I've been offered it all.
[00:38:52.512 --> 00:38:56.415]  Ladies and gentlemen, I, I, I'm not professional.
[00:38:56.415 --> 00:39:03.382]  I've had big New York outfits call and say, we want to do big books with you and we want to have ghostwriters and all this.
[00:39:03.382 --> 00:39:04.362]  I don't even have time for it.
[00:39:04.362 --> 00:39:05.604]  I don't even want the money from that.
[00:39:06.274 --> 00:39:14.676]  You know what, I could probably make tens of millions of dollars if I came out with best-selling books, and I probably should do it, then I could put that money back into my operation.
[00:39:14.676 --> 00:39:23.618]  But I go and I say, a best-selling book sells 500,000, and I make a couple million dollars, but I only reach 500,000 people?
[00:39:23.618 --> 00:39:28.018]  I can go do a video that takes me two hours and reach 500,000 right now!
[00:39:28.018 --> 00:39:33.920]  See, getting into radio philosophy and new media philosophy, that's the difference.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.100]  Internet, generally,
[00:39:36.428 --> 00:39:43.811]  Does not make money compared to an old media system because people expect it all for free.
[00:39:43.811 --> 00:39:45.372]  And it's because I've been here.
[00:39:45.372 --> 00:39:49.634]  It's all free because my goal is to get the word out.
[00:39:49.634 --> 00:39:51.995]  I can reach.
[00:39:51.995 --> 00:39:57.017]  I mean, it's got to be like 10 million people a week on YouTube alone, conservatively, 10 million people.
[00:39:57.816 --> 00:40:05.302]  Just on my channels, and then there's thousands of other channels with people getting 10,000, 20,000, 500 views, whatever the case is.
[00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:05.962]  I haven't added it up.
[00:40:05.962 --> 00:40:08.424]  It's probably 20 million.
[00:40:08.424 --> 00:40:15.590]  I've got single films I've made on one channel that have 10 million views.
[00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:19.593]  35, 40 million, for the Obama deception, if you add them all up.
[00:40:19.593 --> 00:40:22.335]  35, 40 million people reached on a film that cost $100,000?
[00:40:24.747 --> 00:40:29.470]  Again, I'm talking about the future of this show and what we're doing here.
[00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:30.771]  We need to be strong.
[00:40:30.771 --> 00:40:32.072]  We need to have wealth.
[00:40:32.072 --> 00:40:38.136]  We need to be secure and be able to fight off fake lawsuits, fight off anything.
[00:40:38.136 --> 00:40:41.218]  We need to be a foundation against the New World Order.
[00:40:41.218 --> 00:40:42.379]  They've got their trillions.
[00:40:42.379 --> 00:40:45.882]  We need millions.
[00:40:45.882 --> 00:40:51.706]  Raising $400,000 in a money bomb last year sounds like a big deal.
[00:40:51.706 --> 00:40:52.186]  What is that?
[00:40:52.186 --> 00:40:53.247]  Six, seven, eight employees?
[00:40:56.428 --> 00:40:56.908]  What is that?
[00:40:56.908 --> 00:40:58.149]  The equipment for the studio?
[00:40:58.149 --> 00:41:01.790]  Do you know how much this stuff costs?
[00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:02.930]  The rent?
[00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:03.371]  All of it?
[00:41:03.371 --> 00:41:05.331]  Again, I'm not complaining here.
[00:41:05.331 --> 00:41:07.032]  We've been incredibly successful.
[00:41:07.032 --> 00:41:09.333]  It's not enough.
[00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:12.894]  I want to go head-to-head with these people.
[00:41:12.894 --> 00:41:14.455]  Head-to-head.
[00:41:14.455 --> 00:41:20.937]  And it's your PrisonPlanet.tv memberships that are going to fund this mission and this operation.
[00:41:22.162 --> 00:41:34.452]  I want everyone listening, even if you're not a computer person, to have your son, your daughter, your neighbor, sign you up for PrisonPlanet.tv and I want you to start downloading the shows and showing them to your friends and family.
[00:41:34.452 --> 00:41:36.734]  You can blow them up and watch them on a big screen TV.
[00:41:36.734 --> 00:41:40.737]  All the big new TVs coming out now are internet enabled.
[00:41:40.737 --> 00:41:42.798]  I never used to watch TV anymore unless I watched a movie.
[00:41:42.798 --> 00:41:46.301]  Now I can go home and watch YouTube on my television.
[00:41:46.301 --> 00:41:48.403]  That's what I've been doing for a couple of years now.
[00:41:50.896 --> 00:42:02.540]  So we're having a giant effect, but again, thousands of other ventures are now pouring into the internet because they finally figured out that's where the new audience is.
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:07.161]  And so we need to be placed and upfront and dominant from the beginning.
[00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:11.863]  And we've already done that without even trying.
[00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:17.625]  I'm gonna get into some news here, but this is so important because it deals with the media, our culture, where this world's going.
[00:42:17.625 --> 00:42:18.505]  Four years ago,
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:31.284]  I had five, six people working for me, and I was in a little bitty office, and I did not want to grow, but I knew that I had the responsibility.
[00:42:31.284 --> 00:42:32.864]  I did not want to hire more people.
[00:42:32.864 --> 00:42:36.686]  I did not want to try to have to go out.
[00:42:36.686 --> 00:42:41.888]  Five years ago, I didn't even have a sales department.
[00:42:41.888 --> 00:42:46.970]  I had giant websites and would just turn advertising down and just promote my own videos and books.
[00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:50.392]  I didn't even want to deal with people trying to give me money.
[00:42:53.217 --> 00:42:54.560]  You understand that?
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.705]  I did not want the responsibility.
[00:42:56.705 --> 00:43:01.075]  I wanted to talk about this stuff and hopefully see other people rise up and be leaders.
[00:43:01.075 --> 00:43:01.677]  Well, you know what?
[00:43:01.677 --> 00:43:02.278]  It didn't happen.
[00:43:04.417 --> 00:43:09.022]  And so I said, okay, I'm going to go ahead and try to make money and hire people and go to the next level.
[00:43:09.022 --> 00:43:24.319]  And it's taken me three and a half years since we moved into this office to build it, capitalize it, get the space next door when it became available, build the whole thing, do the whole thing, hire the people while doing everything else I was doing.
[00:43:25.979 --> 00:43:41.695]  At the same time, and now we're at that jump point, we're at that critical point of trying to upgrade PrisonPlanet.tv, build new, better systems, add the nightly news, the special reports, interviewing reporters, interviewing people that can be host, moving forward.
[00:43:41.695 --> 00:43:45.940]  But then I go in and meet with the money people here in my office and look at the money I've got.
[00:43:47.009 --> 00:43:49.311]  And it's not there.
[00:43:49.311 --> 00:43:52.953]  It's there to do the nightly news at a scale down level.
[00:43:52.953 --> 00:44:01.318]  It is not there to expand it and to continue to make the documentaries and to do everything we need to do.
[00:44:01.318 --> 00:44:04.801]  Because when you build things, sometimes certain areas don't work as well.
[00:44:04.801 --> 00:44:07.202]  Or you pay for something and it doesn't work out.
[00:44:07.202 --> 00:44:12.846]  We need money to do pure research and prosecute this war against the globalists.
[00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:23.598]  So again, this is kind of, I guess, just a spontaneous little mini money bomb today, where I'm asking you to become PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:44:23.598 --> 00:44:32.266]  If you've already got a membership, go buy five more, create simple username and passcodes, and email them to your friends and family and say, hey, it's easy.
[00:44:32.266 --> 00:44:35.809]  Go to InfoWarsNews.com, log in and watch this, tell me what you think.
[00:44:37.509 --> 00:44:39.251]  And again, we reach people.
[00:44:39.251 --> 00:44:40.592]  It all leaks out onto the web.
[00:44:40.592 --> 00:44:42.615]  We post a lot of it on the YouTube channel.
[00:44:42.615 --> 00:44:49.022]  Members get it first, and get the better archive, and the book, and all the videos, and the rants, and all the material in one spot.
[00:44:49.022 --> 00:44:53.567]  But a lot of it we do post to the YouTube, because we're just here to reach people.
[00:44:53.567 --> 00:44:56.710]  Just like when we are able to, we're going to start putting on TV systems.
[00:44:59.019 --> 00:45:05.966]  The spotty way we've been offered television is, do you want to be on this European cable system?
[00:45:05.966 --> 00:45:07.087]  You know, it's free to air.
[00:45:07.087 --> 00:45:08.788]  You just got to put it on this satellite.
[00:45:08.788 --> 00:45:12.111]  You got to rent the time, but then we'll put it on our cable systems.
[00:45:12.111 --> 00:45:17.076]  And it's not that expensive, but I got to go buy this European satellite.
[00:45:17.076 --> 00:45:18.017]  You'll buy a feed on it.
[00:45:20.102 --> 00:45:20.963]  $10,000 a month.
[00:45:20.963 --> 00:45:21.864]  Doesn't sound expensive.
[00:45:21.864 --> 00:45:23.005]  It is, though.
[00:45:23.005 --> 00:45:25.668]  Just so I can then send it to people.
[00:45:25.668 --> 00:45:30.973]  Then if I put ads on my news, which I haven't done yet, we run Ron Paul ads for free, people are going to complain.
[00:45:30.973 --> 00:45:33.615]  I mean, again, I live in the real world.
[00:45:33.615 --> 00:45:36.858]  Sky Television Channel, okay, a couple hundred thousand viewers, you know, an hour.
[00:45:36.858 --> 00:45:37.339]  They want it.
[00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:39.411]  I think people are like, that's Rupert Murdoch.
[00:45:39.411 --> 00:45:42.315]  No, no, it's people that lease the channel they're able to put me on.
[00:45:42.315 --> 00:45:45.519]  Of course, those will be the COINTELPRO attacks out of Cass Sunstein.
[00:45:45.519 --> 00:45:47.701]  Look, Jones is our Rupert Murdoch satellite system.
[00:45:47.701 --> 00:45:50.225]  Or look, this one in Europe is owned by a German company.
[00:45:50.225 --> 00:45:54.510]  Yes, and somebody has leased a channel, and then they can put you on their channels.
[00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:55.451]  See how that works?
[00:45:55.451 --> 00:45:56.273]  You sublease.
[00:45:58.895 --> 00:46:04.822]  Or there's a person owns a cable system or owns channels on it in a town.
[00:46:04.822 --> 00:46:06.384]  They want to put it on.
[00:46:06.384 --> 00:46:12.431]  So I've got dozens of these contacts coming in of different groups and different organizations.
[00:46:12.431 --> 00:46:14.653]  And so that's extremely expensive to do it that way.
[00:46:15.154 --> 00:46:19.075]  That's why it's good to just be on one big thing, like Fox or CNN, then you go out everywhere.
[00:46:19.075 --> 00:46:28.757]  No, the way to reach people, though, through the back door is, you gotta get on three or four different satellites, like a televangelist, basically, and hit them here, hit them there, and then you start getting a big audience.
[00:46:28.757 --> 00:46:29.737]  Yes.
[00:46:29.737 --> 00:46:36.998]  And then you fund yourself, like the televangelists have done, where you say, buy this DVD about the New World Order or this book.
[00:46:36.998 --> 00:46:38.839]  I won't be selling prayer cloths.
[00:46:38.839 --> 00:46:42.059]  By the way, sometimes I think Glenn Beck has my phones tapped.
[00:46:42.059 --> 00:46:44.380]  And I know from insiders, I've lost those sources now,
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.386]  I think they figured out who they were.
[00:46:48.386 --> 00:46:51.111]  They had five people watching everything we do.
[00:46:51.111 --> 00:46:52.714]  Not that I'm that smart.
[00:46:52.714 --> 00:46:53.415]  But, you know, Beck...
[00:46:54.369 --> 00:46:56.790]  Copies everything we do, which is great.
[00:46:56.790 --> 00:47:01.092]  I mean, just at least it gets the word out.
[00:47:01.092 --> 00:47:03.514]  And what was the point I was going to make?
[00:47:03.514 --> 00:47:11.018]  He I think I knew before he announced it that he was moving to Dallas and he's got a place in between Dallas and Austin.
[00:47:11.018 --> 00:47:16.040]  And the word is he was here in Austin looking at houses to freak him out.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:16.440]  I know that.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.501]  I mean, now he's even going to move here, I guess.
[00:47:18.501 --> 00:47:22.523]  You know, it's not just rich guys don't get a bunch of houses because they
[00:47:23.624 --> 00:47:24.465]  What a bunch of houses.
[00:47:24.465 --> 00:47:28.070]  They want to move around, folks, from fans and stalkers.
[00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:32.075]  He's moved to some little town just north of here.
[00:47:32.075 --> 00:47:32.716]  Forget the name of it.
[00:47:32.716 --> 00:47:33.336]  It was in the news.
[00:47:33.336 --> 00:47:35.559]  Yeah, the lie was out that he had a house in Dallas.
[00:47:35.559 --> 00:47:35.960]  Not true.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.304]  In fact, I knew that, but side issue.
[00:47:39.304 --> 00:47:41.307]  Now Beck's moving down here, and what's he going to do?
[00:47:42.734 --> 00:47:48.679]  I told people, I said, you watch, he's going to buy a Dallas TV station so he has that base of six, seven million potential viewers.
[00:47:48.679 --> 00:47:51.981]  And then he's going to have a 24 hour thing built off the subscribers.
[00:47:51.981 --> 00:47:54.984]  The subscribers are just a funding.
[00:47:54.984 --> 00:47:56.105]  Okay.
[00:47:56.105 --> 00:48:03.551]  And then he's going to have shows with a bunch of other hosts and they're going to fund their operation in satellite time with the books and videos and materials.
[00:48:04.744 --> 00:48:06.285]  And sure enough, that's now been announced.
[00:48:06.285 --> 00:48:08.567]  Well, it's been hinted at.
[00:48:08.567 --> 00:48:13.210]  And Glenn Beck said to others, you know, you think you defeated me kicking me off Fox.
[00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.971]  You haven't seen anything yet.
[00:48:14.971 --> 00:48:22.176]  His own imprint of books, which will be a funder mechanism that will reach millions of people.
[00:48:22.176 --> 00:48:25.458]  His own network that's coming.
[00:48:25.458 --> 00:48:32.583]  The problem is it's going to be pro-war, anti-Ron Paul, neocon, with a little George Soros bashing.
[00:48:32.583 --> 00:48:34.284]  So, I mean, it's better than Al Gore.
[00:48:36.604 --> 00:48:43.386]  But it's like, okay, well there's three teaspoons of cyanide in this glass and only one teaspoon in this glass.
[00:48:43.386 --> 00:48:45.607]  No, we need to do that.
[00:48:45.607 --> 00:48:50.048]  That's always been my plan.
[00:48:50.048 --> 00:48:51.068]  Okay?
[00:48:51.068 --> 00:48:52.889]  But I don't like asking for money.
[00:48:52.889 --> 00:48:55.269]  I don't like having telephones every week like 700 Club.
[00:48:55.269 --> 00:48:55.369]  Okay?
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:05.364]  That Pat Robertson did and ended up with like 40 something TV channels spewing out, you know, worldly globalist garbage.
[00:49:05.364 --> 00:49:17.652]  I just want one channel that is subscriber funded via the web, which is the future, that then moves and funds itself to be on all the old media and terrestrial systems.
[00:49:17.652 --> 00:49:20.173]  But that's all fading out in the next five years.
[00:49:20.173 --> 00:49:24.316]  It's just still there's a big audience there that we need to reach out to who's never heard the truth.
[00:49:25.967 --> 00:49:26.948]  That's what I want to do.
[00:49:26.948 --> 00:49:33.652]  I want to be able to get up here and fight Al Gore and fight George Soros and fight the New World Order.
[00:49:33.652 --> 00:49:41.136]  There's a reason you go to George Soros' websites and he spends about a third of his time attacking yours truly.
[00:49:41.136 --> 00:49:47.800]  Not just attacking Michelle Bachmann or Ron Paul or people like Glenn Beck.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:52.583]  Because, again, as bad as Glenn Beck is, he gets better and better.
[00:49:53.444 --> 00:49:59.186]  And that's probably because he's competitive and he realizes the audience is in telling the truth.
[00:49:59.186 --> 00:50:05.769]  But so, bottom line, we need to be here to make a real challenge to the system.
[00:50:05.769 --> 00:50:10.690]  And I don't need to be held back by monetary restraints.
[00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:15.972]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, you know, a cruise missile cost a couple million dollars.
[00:50:15.972 --> 00:50:17.613]  And they're dropping thousands of them on people.
[00:50:18.905 --> 00:50:24.987]  The government comes and takes your money and then uses it against you with propaganda and media and all the rest of this stuff.
[00:50:24.987 --> 00:50:30.810]  We're asking you to become PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:34.171]  Because I love that Teddy Roosevelt quote about being in the arena.
[00:50:34.171 --> 00:50:40.333]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but I'm not going to sit here and wish later that I hadn't given this 110%.
[00:50:40.333 --> 00:50:46.696]  So I'm asking you to join me at PrisonPlanet.tv or the URL InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:50:48.581 --> 00:50:52.706]  By the way, we're going to send out the InfoWars Insider today with last night's show.
[00:50:52.706 --> 00:50:58.373]  For those of you that aren't members, to give you an idea of what you're going to be watching, that's going to be sent out at InfoWars Insider today.
[00:50:58.373 --> 00:51:00.295]  Sign up at the top of InfoWars.com.
[00:51:00.295 --> 00:51:00.576]  It's free.
[00:51:02.102 --> 00:51:06.803]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:51:06.803 --> 00:51:13.225]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:51:13.225 --> 00:51:15.505]  Number one, study the past.
[00:51:15.505 --> 00:51:17.886]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:51:17.886 --> 00:51:21.607]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:51:22.751 --> 00:51:25.835]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:51:25.835 --> 00:51:29.679]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:51:29.679 --> 00:51:34.746]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:51:34.746 --> 00:51:38.150]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:42.133]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:51:42.133 --> 00:51:46.637]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:51:46.637 --> 00:51:51.562]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:51:51.562 --> 00:51:56.186]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:51:56.186 --> 00:51:58.368]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:52:00.524 --> 00:52:06.088]  Infowars.com, for 16 years, has led the charge against the technocrats.
[00:52:06.088 --> 00:52:14.374]  We have had unrivaled success in unlocking minds, expanding paradigms, and rallying the people to face the new world order.
[00:52:14.374 --> 00:52:15.435]  No one can deny.
[00:52:15.595 --> 00:52:18.396]  That our media operation is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:18.396 --> 00:52:26.080]  And it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:31.343]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.
[00:52:31.343 --> 00:52:33.804]  The social network is nearing completion as well.
[00:52:33.804 --> 00:52:36.726]  The free newsletter is reaching hundreds of thousands.
[00:52:36.726 --> 00:52:40.708]  Please spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:52:40.988 --> 00:52:50.455]  Sign up at the top of InfoWars.com for the free InfoWars Insider email with exclusive video and text reports as well as breaking news.
[00:52:50.455 --> 00:52:52.096]  Look in the mirror.
[00:52:52.096 --> 00:52:54.157]  You are the resistance.
[00:52:54.157 --> 00:53:00.682]  It is up to us, the InfoWarriors, to take the initiative and to defeat the globalists.
[00:53:00.682 --> 00:53:02.343]  Life Before the Collapse.
[00:53:02.343 --> 00:53:04.825]  Final LP by The Lost Vegas.
[00:53:08.626 --> 00:53:14.471]  How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
[00:53:14.471 --> 00:53:20.456]  Baby, you're a rich man!
[00:53:20.456 --> 00:53:23.398]  Baby, you're a rich man!
[00:53:23.398 --> 00:53:28.482]  Baby, you're a rich man too!
[00:53:28.482 --> 00:53:34.087]  Don't come knockin' when your good friends lock you out
[00:53:39.648 --> 00:53:53.256]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas on 180 gram vinyl and mastered especially for vinyl by legendary audio engineer Steve Hall.
[00:53:53.256 --> 00:53:57.058]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas.
[00:53:57.058 --> 00:54:06.243]  Now available at Amazon.com.
[00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:07.524]  Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:54:08.573 --> 00:54:13.416]  I'll race to the news when we come back and start the next hour.
[00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:16.798]  Then we're going to take your calls 800-259-9231.
[00:54:16.798 --> 00:54:20.480]  I want to talk about Al Gore right now.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.221]  The Democrats have put out a tack watch.
[00:54:22.221 --> 00:54:24.243]  We're going to be covering this tonight.
[00:54:24.243 --> 00:54:29.426]  And they say if anybody criticizes the president, help stop the attacks before they start.
[00:54:30.305 --> 00:54:36.528]  And it's a really creepy globalist operation run by barackobama.com by the White House.
[00:54:36.528 --> 00:54:38.949]  And it's acting like it's illegal to criticize the President.
[00:54:38.949 --> 00:54:41.951]  Now, I'm going to play this clip tonight on the Nightly News.
[00:54:41.951 --> 00:54:44.472]  We have them out of Vermont and Missouri and Illinois.
[00:54:45.202 --> 00:54:50.708]  Where they went on the air during the presidential election and said, talking bad about him is now illegal.
[00:54:50.708 --> 00:54:53.230]  And they had cops in uniform saying this.
[00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:56.293]  And every time I mention it, I get emails saying, that's not true, Alex.
[00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:57.314]  You're making that up.
[00:54:57.314 --> 00:54:58.356]  Oh yeah, watch tonight.
[00:54:58.356 --> 00:55:00.237]  We're going to play clips of the newscast.
[00:55:00.237 --> 00:55:01.038]  And here it is.
[00:55:01.038 --> 00:55:03.581]  I mean, these people aren't playing games.
[00:55:03.581 --> 00:55:07.345]  And now citizens are being arrested all over the country to try to protest Obama.
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:13.064]  You know, Obama's coming to town, there's all these people cheering, and there's one person with a placard.
[00:55:13.064 --> 00:55:15.246]  I saw this just last week, and they arrest you.
[00:55:15.246 --> 00:55:16.907]  They say, sorry, no protest.
[00:55:16.907 --> 00:55:19.029]  Oh, but you're allowed to sit there and go, yay!
[00:55:19.029 --> 00:55:21.772]  When the bus drives by.
[00:55:21.772 --> 00:55:25.435]  This is so evil!
[00:55:25.435 --> 00:55:27.457]  I'm gonna try to not get angry.
[00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:31.200]  Our First Amendment is getting torched, ladies and gentlemen, and this pig, Al Gore,
[00:55:32.657 --> 00:55:36.400]  Sits up there, I'm gonna play this video, I got so mad before the show today.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:45.848]  He has his 24 hours of lies, his 24 hours of con artistry, his 24 hours of baloney, his 24 hours of horse manure.
[00:55:45.848 --> 00:55:47.249]  He lies about everything.
[00:55:47.249 --> 00:55:55.295]  Invented the internet, sea levels are gonna rise, didn't happen, don't have a big carbon footprint, palaces all over the place, Napta and Gatter are gonna be great.
[00:55:55.295 --> 00:55:57.977]  I mean, he is such a con artist, you look at him.
[00:55:57.977 --> 00:55:59.699]  He created it with Ken Lay.
[00:56:00.868 --> 00:56:04.229]  I've got all these videos of Al Gore saying there'll never be attacks under carbon.
[00:56:04.229 --> 00:56:07.310]  And then I've got all his memos where he said it would be attacks and now admits it.
[00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:11.832]  He is a total criminal.
[00:56:11.832 --> 00:56:13.452]  A total con man.
[00:56:13.452 --> 00:56:16.213]  And I'm sick of his bold, smug face.
[00:56:16.213 --> 00:56:17.974]  And here's the good news, you piece of trash, Gore.
[00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:22.723]  Even you've admitted it, Aspen Institute and other places that you're laughed at everywhere.
[00:56:22.723 --> 00:56:24.084]  You're a laughing stock.
[00:56:24.084 --> 00:56:25.444]  Now they're running this video.
[00:56:25.444 --> 00:56:27.345]  It's 24 hours of reality.
[00:56:27.345 --> 00:56:31.086]  Yeah, a parallel reality of hell and lies.
[00:56:31.086 --> 00:56:34.747]  Where they're lecturing everyone about oil companies run all this.
[00:56:34.747 --> 00:56:35.648]  The big...
[00:56:37.668 --> 00:56:39.510]  A street can become a river.
[00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.870]  Oh, yeah.
[00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:42.332]  A mountain can become a mudslide.
[00:56:42.332 --> 00:56:44.795]  A forest can become kindling.
[00:56:44.795 --> 00:56:48.558]  Across the globe, cataclysmic weather... PAUSE!
[00:56:48.558 --> 00:56:50.200]  SHUT HIM UP!
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:54.984]  Man, that Nelly Conard's voice makes me want to throw up!
[00:56:54.984 --> 00:56:58.627]  Nothing worse than a Southern man with that little Nelly thing they got going, man.
[00:56:58.627 --> 00:57:00.309]  I can't handle it.
[00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:01.910]  Listen.
[00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:03.031]  Listen, punk.
[00:57:03.031 --> 00:57:03.292]  Okay?
[00:57:05.457 --> 00:57:07.018]  Look at how he's playing people.
[00:57:07.018 --> 00:57:09.459]  A forest fire.
[00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:11.060]  A street can become a river.
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.881]  That's always happened.
[00:57:12.881 --> 00:57:14.821]  There's always been wildfires.
[00:57:14.821 --> 00:57:16.442]  There's always been lightning strikes.
[00:57:16.442 --> 00:57:18.503]  There's always been storms.
[00:57:18.503 --> 00:57:23.525]  He got on air last week and said the hurricane in New York was man-made, global warming.
[00:57:23.525 --> 00:57:25.386]  And that hurricanes don't hit New York.
[00:57:25.386 --> 00:57:27.107]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a history buff.
[00:57:27.107 --> 00:57:28.688]  Hurricanes have always hit New York.
[00:57:30.236 --> 00:57:32.858]  He talks to you like you're a moron.
[00:57:32.858 --> 00:57:35.860]  Let's continue with him fear-mongering.
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:45.045]  And again, paying him money, he says he'll fix it, and shutting down our power plants that are a lot cleaner than China's.
[00:57:45.045 --> 00:57:47.667]  ...that it's being called a new normal.
[00:57:47.667 --> 00:57:49.568]  But there's nothing normal about it.
[00:57:49.568 --> 00:57:53.411]  And there's something else that lies destroyed amid the rubble.
[00:57:53.411 --> 00:57:54.932]  The truth about climate change.
[00:57:55.871 --> 00:58:01.957]  Big oil and big coal are spending big money to spread doubt about climate change.
[00:58:01.957 --> 00:58:04.719]  They've been able to do so quietly, but not anymore.
[00:58:04.719 --> 00:58:07.301]  All right, that's enough.
[00:58:07.301 --> 00:58:10.284]  They've been able to do so quietly.
[00:58:10.284 --> 00:58:16.590]  Every major oil company, including the one you had, Occidental, financed this garbage.
[00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:20.393]  Three years ago, one company wouldn't do it.
[00:58:20.393 --> 00:58:21.975]  And when Exxon merged with Mobil,
[00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:32.172]  David Rockefeller went to the board meeting, it was in the Associated Press, and said, you will be relieved if you don't get behind carbon taxes.
[00:58:32.172 --> 00:58:37.754]  You can read that in the Associated Press, and Rex Tillerson came out and said, it's all real.
[00:58:37.754 --> 00:58:43.336]  Every oil company's for it!
[00:58:43.336 --> 00:58:47.297]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:54.747 --> 00:58:56.008]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:56.008 --> 00:58:59.609]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:59.609 --> 00:59:02.191]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.191 --> 00:59:08.054]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:08.054 --> 00:59:14.297]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:20.698]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:20.698 --> 00:59:24.859]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:24.859 --> 00:59:29.160]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:35.101]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:35.101 --> 00:59:38.661]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:38.661 --> 00:59:40.622]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.622 --> 00:59:41.062]  It's here.

[00:59:53.597 --> 00:59:55.980]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:58.763]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:10.231]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.231 --> 01:00:11.832]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.832 --> 01:00:13.753]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.753 --> 01:00:17.576]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.576 --> 01:00:23.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:29.065]  Alright, your calls are coming up in the next segment, but let me just play the Al Gore thing from the start.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:35.681]  And then I'll just comment after we played some of it, but it makes me want to vomit.
[01:00:35.681 --> 01:00:48.524]  This lying, lecherous blob, this dirty con artist, oil company head, who wants the power to shut down his competition and shut down coal.
[01:00:48.524 --> 01:00:57.566]  It is true that coal, the one true thing in this is, has been funding studies and things saying, hey, we only put out carbon dioxide and water vapor, which is true now.
[01:00:58.206 --> 01:01:01.868]  With the clean burning systems and we supply 51% of your power.
[01:01:01.868 --> 01:01:04.149]  Obama said he wants to bankrupt us.
[01:01:04.149 --> 01:01:06.270]  America, China's building three of these a week.
[01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:07.931]  We only are allowed to build about three a year.
[01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:10.492]  Do you think this is a good idea?
[01:01:10.492 --> 01:01:14.034]  But oil is globalist, completely consolidated.
[01:01:14.034 --> 01:01:15.395]  They want to shut coal down.
[01:01:16.545 --> 01:01:23.653]  Bill Clinton laid off some giant amount of acreage in the late 90s in Utah of clean burning coal.
[01:01:23.653 --> 01:01:30.700]  And when that happened, it doubled the stocks overnight of the Chinese company he was heavily invested in and that had donated to his campaign.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:36.666]  Because they had the only other large deposit of the same clean burning coal that under regulations you had to have for your power plants.
[01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:40.568]  See, that's how you increase wealth in a controlled system.
[01:01:40.568 --> 01:01:42.729]  You shut down the competition.
[01:01:42.729 --> 01:01:47.811]  And you shut down the power plants, and then people have to pay you more for less.
[01:01:47.811 --> 01:02:01.896]  And Al Gore makes it a cute religion, where that big, obese, lying piece of trash, literal America-hating, de-industrializing piece of garbage... I just don't even have words to describe how filthy this pig-like liar is.
[01:02:01.896 --> 01:02:04.257]  This Kinley-worshipping conman.
[01:02:05.237 --> 01:02:06.539]  Ugh, makes me sick.
[01:02:06.539 --> 01:02:09.062]  I mean, this guy wants to kill our industrial system.
[01:02:09.062 --> 01:02:10.743]  He's already done a great job.
[01:02:10.743 --> 01:02:12.045]  He's the hitman on America.
[01:02:12.045 --> 01:02:14.428]  You talk about an economic hitman, he's it.
[01:02:14.428 --> 01:02:21.796]  Now let's go back to this nelly-lying snake that mindless little neo-Nazi fascist liberals love to worship.
[01:02:23.257 --> 01:02:24.638]  What can change in a day?
[01:02:24.638 --> 01:02:27.441]  A street can become a river.
[01:02:27.441 --> 01:02:30.044]  A mountain can become a mudslide.
[01:02:30.044 --> 01:02:32.506]  A forest can become kindling.
[01:02:32.506 --> 01:02:40.053]  Across the globe, cataclysmic weather events are occurring with such regularity that it's being called a new normal.
[01:02:40.053 --> 01:02:41.935]  But there's nothing normal about it.
[01:02:41.935 --> 01:02:45.759]  And there's something else that lies destroyed amid the rubble.
[01:02:45.759 --> 01:02:47.340]  The truth about climate change.
[01:02:48.243 --> 01:02:54.327]  Big oil and big coal are spending big money to spread doubt about climate change.
[01:02:54.327 --> 01:02:57.549]  They've been able to do so quietly, but not anymore.
[01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:58.229]  Oh, not anymore!
[01:02:58.229 --> 01:03:03.872]  September 14th, the world will join hands to create 24 hours of reality.
[01:03:03.872 --> 01:03:04.013]  Oh!
[01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:10.757]  An event that will focus the world's attention on the full truth, scope, scale and impact of the climate crisis.
[01:03:11.457 --> 01:03:18.919]  To remove the doubt, reveal the deniers, and catalyze urgency around an issue that affects every one of us.
[01:03:18.919 --> 01:03:21.500]  Climate change is not your fault.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:28.442]  The climate crisis is our problem, and real solutions can come when we address it together.
[01:03:28.442 --> 01:03:35.704]  Fossil fuel interests have money, influence, control, but together we have something that they don't.
[01:03:35.704 --> 01:03:37.324]  Reality.
[01:03:37.324 --> 01:03:39.665]  Join us for 24 hours of reality.
[01:03:40.578 --> 01:03:45.662]  And show the world what can change in a day.
[01:03:45.662 --> 01:03:46.963]  I mean, how ridiculous.
[01:03:46.963 --> 01:03:53.207]  They cut to this legendary, lying, slimy con man.
[01:03:53.207 --> 01:03:55.689]  And he goes, let me try to get Nelly mode.
[01:03:57.515 --> 01:04:01.238]  We have something they don't.
[01:04:01.238 --> 01:04:03.879]  Me and Rick Perry do.
[01:04:03.879 --> 01:04:05.580]  We have reality.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:10.264]  Let me condescendingly sit up here on a high horse and show an image of the world.
[01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:12.605]  We have all the scientists.
[01:04:12.605 --> 01:04:19.510]  There's no scientist that don't believe that carbon dioxide is a deadly poison.
[01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:27.255]  And if you just let me run your live with Ken Lay that came up with the scam, I'll take care of you.
[01:04:27.415 --> 01:04:29.256]  Do you?
[01:04:47.526 --> 01:04:50.827]  I know Dew's been dallying with it, but get him on the radio.
[01:04:50.827 --> 01:04:52.267]  Get him on the radio.
[01:04:52.267 --> 01:04:57.588]  I want him to respond to the man, Bear Pig, who isn't living in false reality.
[01:04:57.588 --> 01:05:01.109]  He lives in lies.
[01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:07.750]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:12.891]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:12.891 --> 01:05:14.372]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:37.784]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it

[01:05:46.588 --> 01:05:50.831]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[01:05:55.914 --> 01:05:57.515]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:05:57.515 --> 01:05:58.296]  Got it.
[01:05:58.296 --> 01:05:58.796]  Others don't.
[01:06:00.336 --> 01:06:01.937]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:06:01.937 --> 01:06:05.359]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and eFoods Direct.
[01:06:05.359 --> 01:06:07.941]  I have eFoods for my own emergency food supply.
[01:06:07.941 --> 01:06:11.003]  You know Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[01:06:11.003 --> 01:06:11.804]  Very different.
[01:06:11.804 --> 01:06:15.306]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season.
[01:06:15.606 --> 01:06:21.750]  And we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:23.992]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[01:06:23.992 --> 01:06:28.115]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[01:06:28.115 --> 01:06:31.757]  The huge issue of the Greatest Depression is on everyone's mind.
[01:06:31.757 --> 01:06:38.122]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses, and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[01:06:38.122 --> 01:06:39.823]  So everyone needs food security.

[01:07:01.138 --> 01:07:16.606]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:07:16.606 --> 01:07:20.288]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:21.317 --> 01:07:34.069]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:41.336]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:07:42.017 --> 01:07:52.405]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:07:52.405 --> 01:07:56.327]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:07:56.327 --> 01:07:59.430]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:08:02.202 --> 01:08:08.824]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.824 --> 01:08:19.546]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.546 --> 01:08:27.908]  Alright, we're going to your phone calls and back into the news, but this radio show, InfoWars.com, is about action.
[01:08:27.908 --> 01:08:31.229]  It's about being involved, being informed, and standing up to con artists.
[01:08:32.068 --> 01:08:45.693]  Earlier I played some clips of Al Gore's lecturing high horse how any disaster, any problem, any dust storm, any fire is the result, any flood of human activity.
[01:08:45.693 --> 01:08:49.534]  When carbon dioxide is much lower than it's ever been recorded in history.
[01:08:49.534 --> 01:08:51.374]  That's what's crazy.
[01:08:51.374 --> 01:08:52.415]  Carbon dioxide.
[01:08:53.428 --> 01:09:00.595]  And they've taken reasonable environmental steps over the last few decades and are playing on ignorance by listing carbon dioxide as a pollutant.
[01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:03.238]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's what humans exhale.
[01:09:03.238 --> 01:09:09.644]  It's a total dictatorship over all life on Earth and a distraction from all the real environmental issues.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:20.944]  You saw Al Gore on TV saying genetically modified organisms have been leaked in and then show 200 studies to infertility and all rodent species it's given to.
[01:09:20.944 --> 01:09:23.505]  We need human clinical trials now.
[01:09:23.505 --> 01:09:25.886]  But incidentally we see human fertility dropping as well.
[01:09:26.872 --> 01:09:31.614]  But it takes more than 20 years for a generation to be shown to be infertile.
[01:09:31.614 --> 01:09:34.335]  So by the time it happens, we'll be several generations in.
[01:09:34.335 --> 01:09:35.496]  This is a crisis.
[01:09:35.496 --> 01:09:37.816]  I'd be, wow, Al Gore's really woken up.
[01:09:37.816 --> 01:09:42.118]  And if you're going to do something about GMO, maybe you're just misled about carbon.
[01:09:42.118 --> 01:09:43.359]  And I'm all for new energies.
[01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:45.380]  Let's force ourselves onto something new.
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:48.381]  The oil companies wrote the stinking thing.
[01:09:48.381 --> 01:09:51.082]  See, they put out these false narratives.
[01:09:53.737 --> 01:09:54.898]  And then people believe it.
[01:09:54.898 --> 01:09:59.541]  I get these emails every day going, man, you're paid by the oil companies, you piece of trash.
[01:09:59.541 --> 01:10:00.341]  Oh, we're going to get you.
[01:10:00.341 --> 01:10:01.422]  And I'll send an email back.
[01:10:01.422 --> 01:10:03.043]  Please show me the proof.
[01:10:03.043 --> 01:10:14.890]  I'm funded by sponsors and by subscribers to PrisonPlanet.tv and people that buy the books, the videos, the ball caps, the bumper stickers, all the water filters and Infowars.com.
[01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:15.490]  Okay?
[01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:18.752]  I don't have big Fortune 500 or Fortune 100 or Fortune 1000 sponsors, but we tried to get them.
[01:10:22.984 --> 01:10:27.231]  In fact, I'm so busy, I actually had a big sponsor actually approach me.
[01:10:27.231 --> 01:10:29.674]  I mean, not too big, but an American-made company.
[01:10:29.674 --> 01:10:32.479]  The point is, is that they throw it back in your court.
[01:10:32.479 --> 01:10:34.262]  You're paid by big oil!
[01:10:34.262 --> 01:10:37.446]  And then you go look at who funds the environmental power grab movement.
[01:10:38.542 --> 01:10:40.603]  And it's Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan.
[01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:48.806]  Go look who the biggest funder of the Nature Conservancy and all these land grab groups and carbon tax and these climate councils.
[01:10:48.806 --> 01:10:50.526]  And it's Lord Rothschild.
[01:10:50.526 --> 01:10:54.828]  And you find out they own the carbon exchange that you buy the carbons from.
[01:10:54.828 --> 01:10:59.430]  And already Australia is buying tens of billions of dollars of these a year.
[01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:01.570]  Just, here's money, Rothschild!
[01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:05.492]  Can I now have flatulence for my cows and sheep?
[01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:09.112]  Folks, you can pull up Australian News.
[01:11:09.112 --> 01:11:11.195]  They have home police inspections now.
[01:11:11.195 --> 01:11:12.256]  Like, they won't believe it.
[01:11:12.256 --> 01:11:15.060]  Just type in Green Police Australia and it's big articles.
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:18.605]  They have flatulence taxes now in Australia and Canada.
[01:11:20.854 --> 01:11:22.855]  And I've had Canadians send me emails and go, where's that?
[01:11:22.855 --> 01:11:23.895]  You didn't know?
[01:11:23.895 --> 01:11:26.195]  They've added now a tax on the farmers.
[01:11:26.195 --> 01:11:30.997]  When it goes into effect next year for the flatulence of cows, they're now saying methane is unnatural.
[01:11:30.997 --> 01:11:45.861]  There's always been creatures with the intestines that we have, but fish, past gas, primates, rodents, marsupials, whales, and they get up and go, methane is a toxic waste.
[01:11:48.826 --> 01:11:49.786]  What?
[01:11:49.786 --> 01:11:53.027]  There it is, Australia's carbon police may enter premises.
[01:11:53.027 --> 01:11:56.608]  That doesn't mean they may, like they have the power.
[01:11:56.608 --> 01:11:59.169]  It doesn't mean they may come, it means they may.
[01:11:59.169 --> 01:12:01.930]  They say they have that power.
[01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:02.850]  And it just goes on.
[01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:04.931]  I know that was all over the Australian news.
[01:12:04.931 --> 01:12:09.492]  So, they tax flatulence of animals.
[01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:15.195]  They tax the carbon dioxide that comes out of plants.
[01:12:15.195 --> 01:12:19.097]  And I've seen Bill Gates, I've played the clip, and I've seen the New York Times.
[01:12:19.097 --> 01:12:25.080]  In fact, Google, New York Times, a tax to breathe, or paying to breathe.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.280]  And they said, yeah.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:29.462]  See, they take something absurd and go, yeah, we are going to tax you to breathe.
[01:12:29.462 --> 01:12:30.643]  It's for the earth.
[01:12:30.643 --> 01:12:36.265]  And I've seen Bill Gates say, in that little yuppie voice, and then what we need to do is...
[01:12:38.971 --> 01:12:44.717]  Get this graph down to zero on carbon dioxide being output on the earth.
[01:12:44.717 --> 01:12:45.858]  How are we going to do that?
[01:12:45.858 --> 01:12:51.365]  Well, humans are the main thing and we put out individually this amount at the TED conference.
[01:12:51.365 --> 01:12:52.846]  What do you think about that?
[01:12:53.647 --> 01:12:56.109]  Everybody goes, ha ha ha, and he goes, that's right.
[01:12:56.109 --> 01:12:58.591]  We've got to get this down to zero.
[01:12:58.591 --> 01:13:02.253]  And he puts his clicker and puts an image of a human up there.
[01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:10.459]  And all the little anti-human control freaks, you know, that mommy never disciplined, like, get off on the thrill of, ha ha ha, we're going to kill everybody.
[01:13:10.459 --> 01:13:18.044]  Gates laughs with, and then there's a, I should do a special newscast on this on the Nightly News, where I just show a little giggling about killing us.
[01:13:18.044 --> 01:13:20.566]  The giggling about killing us at TED conference.
[01:13:20.566 --> 01:13:22.908]  The giggling about killing us at another conference where he said,
[01:13:23.508 --> 01:13:27.551]  If you, mmkay, mmhmm, why is it all Nellies that rule us?
[01:13:27.551 --> 01:13:34.135]  If we, um, get rid of Grandma and don't give her end-of-life care, we hire ten teachers!
[01:13:34.135 --> 01:13:35.256]  What do you think about that?
[01:13:35.256 --> 01:13:37.958]  And everybody's like, oh yeah!
[01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:43.201]  I mean, it's just like, scum, Nazi-filled, trash, garbage maggots!
[01:13:43.201 --> 01:13:45.983]  We are all ruled by little chicken-neck Nellies!
[01:13:45.983 --> 01:13:47.744]  Going, uh, kill everybody!
[01:13:47.744 --> 01:13:50.886]  I get off when I talk about cutting people's power off!
[01:13:50.886 --> 01:13:51.587]  I'm a Nelly!
[01:13:53.672 --> 01:13:53.975]  Yeah!
[01:13:53.975 --> 01:13:54.722]  Yeah!
[01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:55.307]  Yeah!
[01:13:56.397 --> 01:14:01.939]  Just simpering control freaks in big nerd packs, taking everything over, ruling everything.
[01:14:01.939 --> 01:14:05.099]  Becoming police officers with weapons, tasering us for fun.
[01:14:05.099 --> 01:14:08.020]  I've had it with control freaks and scum!
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.101]  You people are cancer!
[01:14:09.101 --> 01:14:13.242]  Alright, I'm not in a good mood now.
[01:14:13.242 --> 01:14:17.423]  I just started thinking about Bill Gates up there with that little chicken neck.
[01:14:17.423 --> 01:14:20.244]  Hopping around, a little murdering eugenicist.
[01:14:20.244 --> 01:14:20.944]  You know how he walks?
[01:14:20.944 --> 01:14:22.964]  Like a demonic elf.
[01:14:22.964 --> 01:14:23.905]  Hey Bill Gates!
[01:14:26.986 --> 01:14:30.109]  I'm gonna shoot you up with something that's gonna kill you dead in a hammer.
[01:14:30.109 --> 01:14:34.032]  How's a 30-year death from gut disease sound, African children?
[01:14:34.032 --> 01:14:35.693]  Roll up the sleeves!
[01:14:35.693 --> 01:14:42.738]  I'm a little chicken-neck bastard, and nobody's got the will to see what I am!
[01:14:42.738 --> 01:14:48.383]  But by the way, all that NPR voice, all that Nelly stuff, is Delphi technique training.
[01:14:50.916 --> 01:14:53.197]  Those people really don't talk like that.
[01:14:53.197 --> 01:15:01.099]  You research these globalists, they like to beat women and rape people, and they go in and have sword fights with each other, with their trainers, and they're just savage!
[01:15:01.099 --> 01:15:06.001]  I mean, behind the scenes, they're just like... But they come out and go, Hi!
[01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:07.501]  I'm a liberal!
[01:15:07.501 --> 01:15:09.962]  I wanna be your friend!
[01:15:09.962 --> 01:15:12.303]  And guess who else is told by his focus groups?
[01:15:13.203 --> 01:15:14.724]  Glenn Beck didn't used to act like that.
[01:15:14.724 --> 01:15:16.386]  He used to act a little more like this.
[01:15:16.386 --> 01:15:18.988]  Glenn Beck was taught to act like a Nelly.
[01:15:18.988 --> 01:15:21.990]  Have you noticed how they all act like little Nellies?
[01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:27.034]  That's to make you think they're non-threatening and like them like they're a harmless little cute thing.
[01:15:27.034 --> 01:15:38.343]  Because they've done psychological warfare tests and found that a lot of you are cowards or have been induced into cowardice and are threatened by real male activity.
[01:15:38.343 --> 01:15:41.685]  That's why I'm telling you, anybody that acts like a Nelly, watch them.
[01:15:41.685 --> 01:15:42.146]  In power.
[01:15:43.319 --> 01:15:47.021]  If it's a piano teacher, that's a different thing.
[01:15:47.021 --> 01:15:49.722]  Watch them, it's a cover, okay?
[01:15:49.722 --> 01:15:59.527]  I see all of you, I see exactly what you are, psychopathic criminals.
[01:15:59.527 --> 01:16:06.330]  You see, I think when I get up here and get angry at the New World Order, and tell you how evil they are, that you've got courage and want to defeat them.
[01:16:08.424 --> 01:16:11.105]  People that are ignorant send me emails and say, why are you trying to scare people?
[01:16:11.105 --> 01:16:12.226]  I'm not trying to scare somebody.
[01:16:12.226 --> 01:16:15.888]  If I tell my kids don't go out on the highway, there's cars will run you over and kill you.
[01:16:15.888 --> 01:16:17.349]  I'm not trying to scare them.
[01:16:17.349 --> 01:16:19.810]  I'm telling them about a reality that's there.
[01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:31.236]  I believe from history and my own gut instinct that if I go ahead and lay it out all out here, what we're really facing, you've got courage and you've got will and you're going to get angry and stop caring.
[01:16:32.449 --> 01:16:42.537]  It begins with not caring about what your slack-jawed, knuckle-dragging, cowardly, pseudo-tough-guy, football-watching neighbor thinks.
[01:16:42.537 --> 01:16:43.378]  Okay?
[01:16:43.378 --> 01:16:45.119]  That's where it begins.
[01:16:45.119 --> 01:16:48.102]  It begins with not caring what happens to your individual person.
[01:16:49.608 --> 01:16:58.036]  And when you have that attitude, when you have that attitude, then the enemy doesn't have anything over you anymore.
[01:16:58.036 --> 01:17:01.779]  Stop being gilded, domesticated garbage.
[01:17:01.779 --> 01:17:04.021]  Stop being weak!
[01:17:04.021 --> 01:17:10.747]  And when you see a threat coming down on you, deal with it!
[01:17:10.747 --> 01:17:13.670]  Become a human again!
[01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:14.831]  Stop being weak!
[01:17:16.172 --> 01:17:18.414]  We got a bunch of criminals coming down on us!
[01:17:18.414 --> 01:17:21.217]  God!
[01:17:21.217 --> 01:17:22.798]  Murdering scum!
[01:17:22.798 --> 01:17:24.660]  I want to get humanity awake!
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.482]  I want to get our forces up!
[01:17:26.482 --> 01:17:28.223]  And then I want to bring these people to justice!
[01:17:28.223 --> 01:17:30.125]  And you know what I mean!
[01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:31.506]  You know what I mean!
[01:17:31.506 --> 01:17:33.648]  I want to unleash humanity!
[01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:39.114]  Not have a bunch of con artists, pot belly, chicken neck, pieces of garbage running our world!
[01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:46.913]  More importantly, they act like a feminine cowardly chicken neck because they want to train you to act like that.
[01:17:46.913 --> 01:17:52.656]  They want to train you to be weak!
[01:17:52.656 --> 01:17:54.337]  They want to train you.
[01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:56.198]  That's a nasty taste coming up in my mouth.
[01:17:56.198 --> 01:17:58.379]  I'm tasting those globalists.
[01:17:58.379 --> 01:18:02.641]  I can taste their fear and their weakness.
[01:18:02.641 --> 01:18:03.401]  I taste metal.
[01:18:03.401 --> 01:18:04.222]  I taste blood.
[01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:08.791]  Probably shouldn't be on there today.
[01:18:08.791 --> 01:18:12.093]  I almost didn't do the show today because I'm in a bad mood, man.
[01:18:12.093 --> 01:18:15.496]  And looking at Al Gore's fat, ugly face doesn't help!
[01:18:15.496 --> 01:18:18.459]  And pulling up the image of Bill Gates, that piece of garbage!
[01:18:18.459 --> 01:18:21.481]  And all the stuff he's done to innocent people makes me want to throw up!
[01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:24.090]  Oh, boy, I tell you!
[01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:29.335]  I tell you we're gonna get people awake to you, you bastards, and we're coming for you.
[01:18:29.335 --> 01:18:31.236]  We're coming straight for you, and you know it.
[01:18:31.236 --> 01:18:32.477]  That's why you're so scared.
[01:18:32.477 --> 01:18:34.779]  That's why you're moving so fast now.
[01:18:34.779 --> 01:18:42.185]  And you just better keep doing that dance, because you can feel that flame of rebellion starting to lap up and lick right up there.
[01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:45.808]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:45.808 --> 01:18:46.228]  Oh, boy.
[01:18:49.963 --> 01:18:56.509]  Man, you know what it's like to be able to see these people, to know who they are, to just see them conning everybody?
[01:18:56.509 --> 01:18:59.572]  I am so sick of it.
[01:18:59.572 --> 01:19:00.793]  I am so tired of it.
[01:19:00.793 --> 01:19:04.076]  I've never liked con artists.
[01:19:04.076 --> 01:19:10.542]  I've never liked scammers and bullies and scum, and I don't want to be ruled by them, and I sure don't want you to be ruled by them.
[01:19:11.817 --> 01:19:13.057]  Alright, we're going to break and I'll come back.
[01:19:13.057 --> 01:19:13.498]  I'll come back.
[01:19:13.498 --> 01:19:13.918]  I'll come back.
[01:19:13.918 --> 01:19:14.378]  I'll come back.
[01:19:14.378 --> 01:19:19.180]  I'll come back with Jason and Adam and Chris and Tim and Severin and everybody else.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:19.860]  We're going to come back.
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:20.800]  I'm going to try to settle down.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:30.984]  But I start thinking about all those effeminate men with their legs all crossed, little twitly looks on their face, giggling about killing humanity.
[01:19:30.984 --> 01:19:37.767]  I mean, it's a normal response to a pack of scum saying they're going to kill you to get angry, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:38.027 --> 01:19:55.365]  And then to have to fight them day after day after day and know the facts and know the proof upon proof upon proof of their guilt and then to sit there and have ninnies on the street argue with me and throw cliched statements about conspiracy theories back when I'm giving you history and facts.
[01:19:55.365 --> 01:20:00.391]  That's why I get enraged here on air because it is just ridiculous!
[01:20:00.851 --> 01:20:04.836]  Hey guys, are weaker testosterone levels taking you out of the game?
[01:20:04.836 --> 01:20:05.937]  Are you gaining fat?
[01:20:05.937 --> 01:20:06.918]  Feeling tired?
[01:20:06.918 --> 01:20:09.000]  Losing desire in the bedroom?
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.642]  Get back in the game!

[01:21:00.871 --> 01:21:02.012]  You've been lied to.
[01:21:02.012 --> 01:21:06.495]  Lied to by the Wall Street propaganda machine, the government, and the talking heads in the media.
[01:21:06.495 --> 01:21:10.418]  The market has proven that it's more like a casino than an investment.

[01:21:20.786 --> 01:21:21.546]  I said enough.
[01:21:21.546 --> 01:21:31.171]  Since then, I discovered a way to safely grow your money, cut taxes dramatically, get potential double-digit gains, but also have my money protected when the crashes come.
[01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:38.014]  Get a free copy of my new book, Safe Money Millionaire, where I share this powerful tool that people like Walt Disney and JCPenney used
[01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:38.714]  Thank you.
[01:22:00.413 --> 01:22:01.994]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:22:01.994 --> 01:22:05.435]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and eFoods Direct.
[01:22:05.435 --> 01:22:08.036]  I have eFoods for my own emergency food supply.
[01:22:08.036 --> 01:22:11.097]  You know, Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[01:22:11.097 --> 01:22:11.897]  Very different.
[01:22:11.897 --> 01:22:21.861]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season, and we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[01:22:21.861 --> 01:22:23.842]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[01:22:24.102 --> 01:22:28.225]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[01:22:28.225 --> 01:22:31.888]  The huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's mind.
[01:22:31.888 --> 01:22:38.273]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[01:22:38.273 --> 01:22:39.974]  So everyone needs food security.
[01:22:40.134 --> 01:22:44.035]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from eFoodsDirect.

[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:02.223]  They're poisoning the water with fluoride.
[01:23:02.223 --> 01:23:04.386]  They're spraying the air with heavy metals.
[01:23:04.386 --> 01:23:07.049]  Why and what can you do to defend your family?
[01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:14.319]  This week at WaterWebinar.com, in an all new free live online webinar, Earth's most powerful cleansing secret is being revealed.

[01:23:17.363 --> 01:23:17.983]  I don't know.
[01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:38.353]  It was even used during Chernobyl to clean up nuclear contamination.
[01:23:38.353 --> 01:23:47.359]  Go to WaterWebinar.com now and sign up for free to find out how to turn the worst water on this planet into pristine, clear drinking water which heals your body.

[01:23:53.104 --> 01:23:54.405]  Don't get left behind.
[01:23:54.405 --> 01:23:56.847]  It's your life, your water, your freedom.
[01:23:56.847 --> 01:23:57.427]  Fight for it.
[01:23:57.427 --> 01:23:59.589]  Go to WaterWebinar.com now.
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:10.102]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[01:24:10.102 --> 01:24:19.527]  Said the Joker to the thief.
[01:24:19.527 --> 01:24:23.829]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[01:24:23.829 --> 01:24:25.509]  Said the Joker to the thief.
[01:24:25.509 --> 01:24:28.171]  There's too much confusion.
[01:24:28.171 --> 01:24:32.573]  There's too much confusion.
[01:24:32.573 --> 01:24:34.174]  I can't get no relief.
[01:24:36.894 --> 01:24:38.795]  Alright, I'm going to your calls and I'm going to the news.
[01:24:38.795 --> 01:24:41.035]  I'm out of control today.
[01:24:41.035 --> 01:24:42.556]  But we need to get out of control.
[01:24:42.556 --> 01:24:52.079]  We need to get angry about being pushed around and bossed around by a bunch of murdering scumbag control freak demons.
[01:24:52.079 --> 01:24:54.959]  Our world is run by psychopath sadists, okay?
[01:24:54.959 --> 01:24:56.980]  And I don't think it's funny or cute.
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:59.881]  And it's only going to get worse from here unless we beat these people.
[01:24:59.881 --> 01:25:03.282]  These arrogant, leering creatures that try to make us feel powerless.
[01:25:04.292 --> 01:25:10.179]  They have to spike our food and water just to try to destroy our testosterone, to try to make us weak.
[01:25:10.179 --> 01:25:11.540]  You are under chemical attack!
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:12.401]  It's on record!
[01:25:12.401 --> 01:25:14.964]  You gotta get angry!
[01:25:15.868 --> 01:25:19.091]  You gotta get focused, and you gotta commit.
[01:25:19.091 --> 01:25:21.813]  The enemy's all around us, and we're gonna bring them down together.
[01:25:21.813 --> 01:25:29.660]  Because we're gonna wake up all these other sheeple, we're gonna get them out of the trances that are in, we're gonna restore the Republic, and then it's 1776 worldwide.
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:36.546]  Where you're honored for your ideas, and your strength, and your beauty, and your creativity, and what you stand for.
[01:25:36.546 --> 01:25:41.130]  Not because you're some multinational that buys off politicians and shuts down their competition.
[01:25:41.974 --> 01:25:48.736]  We're not going to value a bunch of painted up whores and other people in Hollywood and all the diversions.
[01:25:48.736 --> 01:25:55.079]  And we're not going to force anybody to follow our ideas, we're going to lead by example.
[01:25:55.079 --> 01:25:59.040]  We're caught in the jaws of a dehumanization and I will not be part of it.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:04.082]  And I will yell and I will scream and I will struggle and I will try to break others loose from it.
[01:26:04.082 --> 01:26:06.003]  And we've had great success, that's what's empowering.
[01:26:08.117 --> 01:26:09.758]  Think of all the victories we've had.
[01:26:09.758 --> 01:26:11.160]  The globalists are now being identified.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.661]  The Federal Reserve is now the enemy.
[01:26:12.661 --> 01:26:14.162]  People know it.
[01:26:14.162 --> 01:26:22.729]  All the major Republican candidates are talking like Ron Paul about the New World Order and Gardasil brain-damaging people and getting rid of the Federal Reserve.
[01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:33.138]  Even though they're operatives, the very fact that they have to speak the truth shows the revolution of awakening that is happening and how close we are to getting our hands around the enemy's throats.
[01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:37.831]  I'm not going to hurt my voice anymore.
[01:26:37.831 --> 01:26:41.493]  Let's go to David Adam in Puerto Rico!
[01:26:41.493 --> 01:26:42.333]  You're on the air!
[01:26:42.333 --> 01:26:42.954]  Come on!
[01:26:42.954 --> 01:26:45.835]  Hi, how are you?
[01:26:45.835 --> 01:26:49.216]  Welcome, sir!
[01:26:49.216 --> 01:26:58.340]  The reason I'm calling is, I don't know if you've translated your movies to Spanish, your documentaries.
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:26:59.421]  Some of them have been.
[01:26:59.421 --> 01:27:01.582]  You can just type in Obama Deception, Spanish.
[01:27:02.901 --> 01:27:06.905]  In game Spanish, and it's in Chinese, German, other things.
[01:27:06.905 --> 01:27:12.009]  But we don't have the money or the systems officially on DVDs and films.
[01:27:12.009 --> 01:27:14.130]  In the future, we are going to try to pay them.
[01:27:14.130 --> 01:27:22.117]  I don't know, it's thousands and thousands to get them added to the DVD, and then it makes them bigger, data-wise, and there can be more errors.
[01:27:22.117 --> 01:27:23.418]  But we need to get to that point.
[01:27:23.418 --> 01:27:25.500]  We need to come out with Blu-ray, everything else.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.981]  But yes sir, it's a great idea.
[01:27:26.981 --> 01:27:30.664]  I just tell people, go ahead and translate them into whatever non-language you want and put them on the web.
[01:27:31.715 --> 01:27:34.556]  Okay, yeah, I've always wondered about that.
[01:27:34.556 --> 01:27:36.216]  So how do you do that?
[01:27:36.216 --> 01:27:39.498]  You put Spanish Obama?
[01:27:39.498 --> 01:27:42.318]  Obama's Deception?
[01:27:42.318 --> 01:27:44.479]  No, no, there's definitely Spanish translations.
[01:27:44.479 --> 01:27:51.561]  Guys, try it on air with Google in front of everybody that's watching PrisonPlanet.tv, because we're simulcasting this, of course, on the web as TV.
[01:27:51.561 --> 01:27:55.423]  For listeners that are wondering what I'm talking about, just go to Google Live on screen.
[01:27:55.423 --> 01:27:59.284]  Go to the NSA tracking system, the Crystal Ball system.
[01:28:00.084 --> 01:28:04.749]  Uh, and, uh, type in to that two-way system where they're watching everything we're doing.
[01:28:04.749 --> 01:28:05.290]  Just remember that.
[01:28:05.290 --> 01:28:06.891]  They're not giving you the data for nothing.
[01:28:06.891 --> 01:28:09.034]  They're tracking everything you do and building an algorithm.
[01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:11.176]  And just type in the Spanish Obama Deception.
[01:28:11.176 --> 01:28:12.297]  And there it is.
[01:28:12.297 --> 01:28:15.140]  The Obama Deception, subtitled Spanish.
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:23.068]  So I know it's, they're all subtitled, and I think I've seen one, two, or at least pieces of it that fade us down and, you know, did a pretty good job of then speaking in Spanish over it.
[01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:29.291]  You know, I had a radio program here in Puerto Rico.
[01:28:29.291 --> 01:28:33.073]  I'm a chiropractor, and I warn all my patients about, you know, vaccines.
[01:28:33.073 --> 01:28:41.837]  And today I was speaking to some of my patients about hyperactivity disorder, how that's really created to dumb down the children.
[01:28:41.837 --> 01:28:47.520]  And, you know, I give movies out to my patients, but I always want... Some of them don't know English.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:53.283]  I mean, so it's something that I've always wanted to do, and I'm glad you're doing it,
[01:29:01.001 --> 01:29:02.261]  Well done my friend.
[01:29:02.261 --> 01:29:05.022]  How's everything going in Puerto Rico?
[01:29:05.022 --> 01:29:10.965]  I know they like to bomb a lot of your little islands with DU and people come up sick in the area and the Pentagon doesn't care.
[01:29:10.965 --> 01:29:12.506]  It's true.
[01:29:14.136 --> 01:29:22.942]  We, um, you know, people drove out the Marines from Vieques Island, but it's really, uh, far, you know, they're still there.
[01:29:22.942 --> 01:29:26.104]  But... Yeah, I know, then they called you anti-America.
[01:29:26.104 --> 01:29:30.847]  Anti-America dropping DU bombs on there for years, poisoning all the fish.
[01:29:30.847 --> 01:29:35.190]  Everybody else, I guess it's anti-American a Marine doesn't want to breathe deadly poison.
[01:29:35.190 --> 01:29:39.093]  It's always like, give us all your rights, let us run over you, or you're anti-American.
[01:29:39.093 --> 01:29:39.653]  No.
[01:29:39.653 --> 01:29:42.575]  Those are the people that are anti-American and anti-freedom.
[01:29:42.575 --> 01:29:43.136]  God bless you.
[01:29:43.536 --> 01:29:44.558]  Good to hear from you.
[01:29:44.558 --> 01:29:45.299]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:45.299 --> 01:29:46.722]  Stay with us, straight ahead.
[01:29:46.722 --> 01:29:48.384]  More calls, tons of news.
[01:29:48.384 --> 01:29:50.147]  I'm fired up!
[01:29:50.147 --> 01:29:51.530]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:54.054]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.054 --> 01:29:56.759]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.105 --> 01:30:06.787]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:30:06.787 --> 01:30:13.209]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:30:13.209 --> 01:30:15.490]  Number one, study the past.
[01:30:15.490 --> 01:30:17.891]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:30:17.891 --> 01:30:21.613]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:30:22.734 --> 01:30:25.836]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:30:25.836 --> 01:30:29.678]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:30:29.678 --> 01:30:34.722]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:30:34.722 --> 01:30:38.144]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:30:38.704 --> 01:30:42.126]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:30:42.126 --> 01:30:46.628]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:30:46.628 --> 01:30:51.551]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:30:51.551 --> 01:30:56.173]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:30:56.173 --> 01:30:58.335]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:31:01.485 --> 01:31:03.187]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:03.187 --> 01:31:08.492]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:08.492 --> 01:31:10.034]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.034 --> 01:31:18.822]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:19.543 --> 01:31:27.088]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.088 --> 01:31:35.093]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:35.093 --> 01:31:42.477]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:31:45.259 --> 01:31:48.462]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:31:48.462 --> 01:31:50.664]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:31:50.664 --> 01:31:52.966]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:01.320]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:08.243]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:32:08.243 --> 01:32:10.784]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:32:10.784 --> 01:32:16.186]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:32:16.186 --> 01:32:19.207]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:32:19.207 --> 01:32:21.528]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:32:21.528 --> 01:32:27.790]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:28.210]  In fact,
[01:32:28.490 --> 01:32:31.152]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:31.152 --> 01:32:36.936]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:32:36.936 --> 01:32:38.577]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:32:38.577 --> 01:32:39.878]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:32:39.878 --> 01:32:42.560]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:46.782]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:32:46.782 --> 01:32:51.406]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:32:51.406 --> 01:32:54.007]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:32:54.007 --> 01:32:57.029]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:07.533]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:33:07.533 --> 01:33:13.075]  Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you.
[01:33:13.075 --> 01:33:17.177]  By now you should have somehow realized what you gotta do.
[01:33:17.177 --> 01:33:24.219]  I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now.
[01:33:24.219 --> 01:33:25.940]  I'll tell you the phenomenon, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:28.993 --> 01:33:42.777]  Why I get on air sometimes and blow up, it's because every night, every morning, even when I'm reading a book to one of my children, I'm thinking about the crimes of the New World Order.
[01:33:42.777 --> 01:33:52.099]  And a lot of times I get in here, some shows that don't ever end up really getting into anything, because I've already read all this, I'm already aware of what they're doing, and I'm so angry by the end of it, I don't even know what to say.
[01:33:52.099 --> 01:33:54.720]  It's like, look at how crazy our world's gotten!
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.621]  Checkpoints all over the highways!
[01:33:56.621 --> 01:33:57.361]  Police state!
[01:33:58.533 --> 01:34:08.544]  Cancer, diabetes, off the charts, confirmed radioactive isotopes being added to water supplies all over the country.
[01:34:08.544 --> 01:34:15.992]  And it's just gotten to a point where we've been in evil so long that now it's getting worse and worse by the minute, and it's just like, well, that's the way it is.
[01:34:15.992 --> 01:34:17.094]  Well, they're the authorities!
[01:34:18.342 --> 01:34:21.965]  I mean, have you ever had any doubts about how evil the people are we're facing?
[01:34:21.965 --> 01:34:27.128]  Maury Strong, Al Gore, all of them, who go to these conferences and call for all this population reduction.
[01:34:27.128 --> 01:34:29.410]  And then you wonder why they're spiking your food and water.
[01:34:29.410 --> 01:34:32.492]  Folks, these people are murdering control freaks.
[01:34:34.281 --> 01:34:35.022]  I'll say it right here.
[01:34:35.022 --> 01:34:45.613]  Al Gore's policies, they've had big news articles admitting this, would kill over a billion people in the next decade if they cut the carbon output of the third world where most people are on $2 a day or less.
[01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:50.459]  There's already 15 million children starving to death a year and another 10 million adults.
[01:34:50.459 --> 01:34:51.300]  Guys, search...
[01:34:53.582 --> 01:34:58.443]  How many people starve to death a year, numbers, and just show them, they don't believe it.
[01:34:58.443 --> 01:35:05.724]  15 million people, children, it's 25 million total on average, starve to death.
[01:35:05.724 --> 01:35:14.365]  And when they got the Copenhagen Treaty two years ago, it was right at double the taxes on the third world and a death sentence.
[01:35:14.365 --> 01:35:20.587]  In the first decade of the plan, conservatively, 1 billion people dead.
[01:35:20.587 --> 01:35:22.467]  And you're like, well, I hear about that on the news.
[01:35:22.467 --> 01:35:23.127]  No, you don't.
[01:35:28.783 --> 01:35:33.909]  There's a number from Answers, which you never know if the Yahoo Answers is right in that Yahoo.
[01:35:33.909 --> 01:35:36.792]  How many people starve to death each year worldwide?
[01:35:36.792 --> 01:35:42.178]  It's around 5 million people per year from starvation, not including malnutrition.
[01:35:42.178 --> 01:35:45.042]  Oh, there's the little caveat.
[01:35:45.042 --> 01:35:45.803]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:35:47.344 --> 01:35:50.305]  15 million children from starvation and malnutrition.
[01:35:50.305 --> 01:36:01.311]  Oh, you didn't get enough so your bones were sticking out and you looked like a concentration camp victim, but you didn't actually shrivel down to nothing and then die of that.
[01:36:01.311 --> 01:36:05.473]  You died of then a cold you got.
[01:36:05.473 --> 01:36:12.657]  But if you had malnutrition, it's 15 million children, 10 million adults, 25 million.
[01:36:12.657 --> 01:36:15.339]  Type in number of deaths from starvation and malnutrition combined.
[01:36:16.121 --> 01:36:18.022]  I want to show folks that number.
[01:36:18.022 --> 01:36:22.665]  Now, you'd think that's a big deal to people.
[01:36:22.665 --> 01:36:23.745]  Yep, there it is.
[01:36:23.745 --> 01:36:27.507]  15 million children die of hunger a year.
[01:36:27.507 --> 01:36:29.448]  And it's got all down at the bottom of the bibliograph.
[01:36:29.448 --> 01:36:31.409]  That's from UNICEF.
[01:36:31.409 --> 01:36:32.690]  The UN's doing a good job.
[01:36:34.565 --> 01:36:38.989]  And then they collect your money to feed the kids and actually use it to shoot them up with soft kill weapons.
[01:36:38.989 --> 01:36:41.111]  See, that's the great part about the globalists.
[01:36:41.111 --> 01:36:43.294]  They don't just carry out the crimes.
[01:36:43.294 --> 01:36:44.555]  It's full spectrum dominance.
[01:36:44.555 --> 01:36:47.337]  They then are the response to their carnage.
[01:36:48.914 --> 01:37:04.629]  It's a 21st century model of the Rothschilds funding both armies or all three armies, all three or four factions depending on what war it was, the perpetual continental European conflict that was eternal and was their economy.
[01:37:06.235 --> 01:37:17.218]  I remember reading letters from cousins, you know, English royalty to their French Norman cousins about, I'm having uprisings, can we start a war in the spring?
[01:37:17.218 --> 01:37:18.698]  Yes, cousin.
[01:37:18.698 --> 01:37:23.099]  This time I shall take back the lands you took.
[01:37:23.099 --> 01:37:24.739]  We'll kill off some of the rabble.
[01:37:24.739 --> 01:37:25.420]  It's so much fun.
[01:37:33.561 --> 01:37:35.003]  I like that line from Braveheart.
[01:37:35.003 --> 01:37:39.088]  Not really historical, but there have been cases of similar things.
[01:37:39.088 --> 01:37:47.759]  They're having the archers fire into the general battle, and they say, Your Highness, that will kill some of our troops!
[01:37:47.759 --> 01:37:49.661]  Well, it'll kill some of theirs as well!
[01:37:49.661 --> 01:37:50.362]  Open fire!
[01:37:53.564 --> 01:38:00.312]  I mean, what does Henry Kissinger say in State Department memorandum 200 and the accompanying CIA documents that Maury Strong put into UN law?
[01:38:00.312 --> 01:38:01.813]  He said we're going to use food as a weapon!
[01:38:01.813 --> 01:38:03.696]  We gotta kill these people!
[01:38:05.202 --> 01:38:08.823]  And a lot of yuppies and people kind of go, well there are too many people, I guess kill them.
[01:38:08.823 --> 01:38:10.804]  Listen, you little moron.
[01:38:10.804 --> 01:38:13.505]  You're having stuff putting your food in water too.
[01:38:13.505 --> 01:38:15.445]  You're not part of the establishment.
[01:38:15.445 --> 01:38:18.886]  And that goes for the cops and the military, everybody else.
[01:38:18.886 --> 01:38:21.427]  Stop thinking you're on the winning team.
[01:38:21.427 --> 01:38:24.848]  There's less than 6,000 globalists in their own words.
[01:38:24.848 --> 01:38:29.710]  Rothkopf, head of the Kissinger Group, best-selling book, super classy, wrote three years ago.
[01:38:29.710 --> 01:38:31.850]  Now four years ago.
[01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:32.351]  There's 6,000 gophers.
[01:38:34.343 --> 01:38:36.165]  There's less than 20 families.
[01:38:36.165 --> 01:38:39.908]  You aren't part of the team.
[01:38:39.908 --> 01:38:41.210]  Got that, Jack?
[01:38:41.210 --> 01:38:46.014]  You're down here in the mud and the guts and the poison with the rest of us.
[01:38:46.014 --> 01:38:48.617]  Even if you think you're part of the power structure.
[01:38:48.617 --> 01:38:51.820]  Or even if Glenn Beck's gone to dinner and had Bill Gates pat him on the head.
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:57.806]  Yeah, as soon as Glenn Beck started talking about eugenics, he had the heavy guys want to have dinner with him every night.
[01:38:58.919 --> 01:39:00.441]  And try to explain things to him.
[01:39:00.441 --> 01:39:05.687]  And Glenn Beck comes up and says, I've been having big powerhouse meetings and they've been explaining things to me.
[01:39:05.687 --> 01:39:06.749]  Yeah, I bet they have been.
[01:39:06.749 --> 01:39:10.393]  Did you get a memo about what to not give your kids?
[01:39:11.691 --> 01:39:16.754]  Beck, you've had enough problems with children with all sorts of serious illnesses.
[01:39:16.754 --> 01:39:18.775]  You might want to find out what did that.
[01:39:18.775 --> 01:39:21.917]  It's kind of like when you said you were getting macular degeneration.
[01:39:21.917 --> 01:39:27.300]  All the medical doctors I've talked to for years have linked it, and it's now in major studies, to Diet Coke.
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:30.161]  You admit you're a Diet Coke aspartame addict.
[01:39:30.161 --> 01:39:37.966]  We put an article out, Drudge picks it up, and you make jokes about us and talk trash about us, and then say that I'm having sex with
[01:39:40.427 --> 01:40:00.455]  People just out of the blue bizarre insane gibbering behavior That's not the act of a godly person when I was trying to help you not lose your eyesight you fool So you could then warn other people and save tens of millions of folks But you know full well if you came out against aspartame and more than 10,000 products that you wouldn't be the golden boy anymore
[01:40:01.275 --> 01:40:07.300]  Now I challenge you, that now as you launch your own quote independent system, to come out against the Aspartame.
[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.121]  To come out against the GMO.
[01:40:09.121 --> 01:40:12.324]  And I will fully get behind you and support you.
[01:40:12.324 --> 01:40:13.405]  If you come all the way.
[01:40:14.451 --> 01:40:18.792]  Because I don't care about who the big swingin' Mac Daddy is.
[01:40:18.792 --> 01:40:33.817]  In fact, I would rather have five or six real people out there, bigger and better than I am, and I will tell you right now that I would hand this operation over to people here in my own group, as long as they follow the code of liberty and freedom, and I would step to the back and wouldn't even be on air.
[01:40:33.817 --> 01:40:35.317]  I don't want to be on air.
[01:40:35.317 --> 01:40:36.778]  I don't want to be doing this.
[01:40:36.778 --> 01:40:38.078]  I don't like doing this.
[01:40:38.078 --> 01:40:40.559]  But I gotta do this, and I'm sick of it!
[01:40:43.246 --> 01:40:47.569]  I'm sick of all the Ron Paul counterfeits, the Rick Perry's, the Michelle Bachman's.
[01:40:47.569 --> 01:40:49.830]  I've even had family taken in by her now.
[01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:52.612]  It is never ending.
[01:40:52.612 --> 01:40:56.294]  Because she's so convincing with that deadpan stare and everything, and she's pretty.
[01:40:56.294 --> 01:41:01.938]  Alright, I said I'd take your calls.
[01:41:01.938 --> 01:41:05.240]  It's just that I want to defeat the globalists.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.241]  That's what I'm out for.
[01:41:07.241 --> 01:41:08.122]  That's what I want to do.
[01:41:11.178 --> 01:41:19.213]  And I know there'll still be evil in the world, but we've got a particularly virulent, nasty system coming down on us right now.
[01:41:19.213 --> 01:41:19.334]  And...
[01:41:21.886 --> 01:41:22.847]  The big battle's here.
[01:41:22.847 --> 01:41:26.149]  The big acceleration of their program and our resistance.
[01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:27.550]  This isn't slow motion anymore.
[01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:29.852]  We're entering the time of great tumult.
[01:41:29.852 --> 01:41:34.315]  Do you understand there's no future for my children and your children if we don't turn this around?
[01:41:34.315 --> 01:41:40.239]  Do you understand that globalism is a curse on a country and all of the good is being removed?
[01:41:40.239 --> 01:41:46.164]  That we're being conquered to financial fraud that's impossible to pay back because we don't owe it and it's a derivatives fraud?
[01:41:48.396 --> 01:41:51.718]  We are in a trap that leads us one place.
[01:41:51.718 --> 01:41:55.141]  Destruction, enslavement, bondage, humiliation.
[01:41:55.141 --> 01:42:05.468]  And you know, I had a guy call me at the end of the show yesterday and he goes, Alex, you know, I come from this prominent globalist family and the guy sounded incredible, like a high powered salesman.
[01:42:05.468 --> 01:42:08.911]  And, uh, you know, I heard a lot of truth in his voice.
[01:42:08.911 --> 01:42:12.133]  Uh, and he's like, you know, I can triple companies and all this other stuff.
[01:42:12.133 --> 01:42:14.355]  And you need to, this is not an info war.
[01:42:14.355 --> 01:42:15.596]  This is a psi op.
[01:42:17.426 --> 01:42:21.130]  And you know, I joined the Globalists because I got tired of being harassed.
[01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:22.972]  You didn't join anybody.
[01:42:22.972 --> 01:42:26.276]  You decided to jump off a cliff like a delusional PCP head.
[01:42:28.171 --> 01:42:30.392]  You don't join the New World Order.
[01:42:30.392 --> 01:42:32.713]  You don't join with extermination.
[01:42:32.713 --> 01:42:54.404]  You don't win for a time because you buy some time for yourself and get to hang around in a rich neighborhood and feel powerful and get off on having a fancy car and pulling up at the country club and the local rich guys come over and it's a self admiration club while you're drinking drinks that have got deadly poison added to it.
[01:42:54.404 --> 01:42:57.046]  You don't get a memo on that stuff and I know you don't.
[01:42:58.507 --> 01:43:00.152]  You're not part of the New World Order.
[01:43:00.152 --> 01:43:03.521]  You didn't decide to join it and start winning.
[01:43:03.521 --> 01:43:05.507]  You decided to give up.
[01:43:05.507 --> 01:43:05.788]  And so...
[01:43:06.858 --> 01:43:08.759]  I'm not in a PSYOP here.
[01:43:08.759 --> 01:43:12.702]  I'm not using things that are simple or easy or just slogans.
[01:43:12.702 --> 01:43:17.045]  It's what comes out of my gut, what comes out of my veritas, what comes out of my research.
[01:43:17.045 --> 01:43:18.766]  I'm not trying to make it easy.
[01:43:18.766 --> 01:43:20.567]  I'm not trying to make it palatable.
[01:43:20.567 --> 01:43:22.509]  I'm not trying to sell people.
[01:43:22.509 --> 01:43:33.716]  I'm throwing the gauntlet down, spilling my guts and saying, this is what it is, this is what it's about, and I don't care what happens to me or my family to try to save humanity.
[01:43:33.716 --> 01:43:36.338]  I'm trying to literally put it all on the table.
[01:43:36.778 --> 01:43:43.924]  All in, all the chips, this is it, what are you going to do about it?
[01:43:43.924 --> 01:43:55.814]  That's always the line from people in the establishment, people that are in the lower rings of it or think they're part of it, is, oh, you've got to compromise and get in and win and use their systems against them.
[01:43:55.814 --> 01:43:56.234]  No.
[01:43:56.234 --> 01:43:57.255]  No.
[01:43:57.255 --> 01:44:01.799]  It's easy to sit back and say, Alex could do this better, Alex could do that better, and there is a lot of stuff I could do better.
[01:44:02.659 --> 01:44:06.522]  But you can't argue with success from nothing.
[01:44:06.522 --> 01:44:13.326]  I wasn't picked up by Clair Channel and then given national TV shows and given everything on a silver platter.
[01:44:13.326 --> 01:44:22.172]  I started at zero, zero, zero and said no to the deals, said no to being elevated to the mountain.
[01:44:24.482 --> 01:44:30.866]  Can you imagine the devil to Christ saying, look at the world, look at all the kingdoms up there on the mountaintop.
[01:44:30.866 --> 01:44:33.787]  You know, in this vision, you could have it all.
[01:44:33.787 --> 01:44:35.068]  It's like a joke.
[01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:36.569]  Oh, I could have it all?
[01:44:36.569 --> 01:44:45.894]  All the problems, all the infighting, all the wealth, and people hating you for the wealth, and all the bobbles and the crud.
[01:44:45.894 --> 01:44:50.557]  I mean, it's a joke.
[01:44:50.557 --> 01:44:52.018]  And the devil offers us all that.
[01:44:53.479 --> 01:45:00.500]  And I'll tell you, when you actually get things, because you need them to be strong and protect yourself and also fight the globalists, they're a hassle.
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.581]  They're a trouble.
[01:45:01.581 --> 01:45:03.341]  They're a responsibility.
[01:45:03.341 --> 01:45:09.462]  It is not some... That's the big con game, is that we're going to sell out and get something great.
[01:45:09.462 --> 01:45:13.963]  We're going to sell out and get something wonderful.
[01:45:13.963 --> 01:45:20.224]  And the globalists know that most good people actually don't want to sell out and won't sell out.
[01:45:22.082 --> 01:45:32.566]  So they organize the people that will sell out to be their enforcers, but then they seek to cut off resources to everybody because people won't sell out for gleaming palaces.
[01:45:32.566 --> 01:45:34.847]  Good, average, normal, meek people.
[01:45:34.847 --> 01:45:37.908]  But a lot of them will sell out to put food on the baby's table.
[01:45:40.851 --> 01:46:05.107]  And that's why the globalists work around the clock to shut off economies and only have big globalist corporations that you work for who can condition you and change your culture and turn you into a Borg, turn you into one of them, a empty biological android who's used up and thrown away, who's implanted with viruses that trigger at certain hormone flux levels in life to get rid of you right as you're about to get your Social Security.
[01:46:07.006 --> 01:46:08.928]  I am not a biological android.
[01:46:08.928 --> 01:46:09.849]  I am not an animal.
[01:46:09.849 --> 01:46:11.551]  I am a human being.
[01:46:11.551 --> 01:46:14.994]  And my intellect burns.
[01:46:14.994 --> 01:46:21.201]  Burns with a reflection of God's glory and creativity as each and every one of you out there does as well.
[01:46:22.315 --> 01:46:29.581]  But you won't know about that creativity, you won't know about that strength and that power until you open the door.
[01:46:29.581 --> 01:46:38.909]  The globalists teach you from birth that you're trash, that you're garbage, that you're exhaled carbon dioxide is poisonous, not life to plants, and they give us life back.
[01:46:40.066 --> 01:46:43.207]  They teach you that you're trash, that women are ugly.
[01:46:43.207 --> 01:46:48.189]  I mean, I see beautiful women everywhere that all are obsessed that they're ugly and all obsessed.
[01:46:48.189 --> 01:46:51.670]  What's good looking is a woman who's into herself and feels good about life.
[01:46:51.670 --> 01:46:53.371]  That's what's sexy.
[01:46:53.371 --> 01:47:00.113]  Men seek for these trappings of false gladiatorial power and of a bearing of strength.
[01:47:00.113 --> 01:47:02.994]  But most of them cry like little babies when they actually get hurt.
[01:47:06.596 --> 01:47:14.038]  Until you are ready to sacrifice yourself on the altar of liberty, you have no future.
[01:47:14.038 --> 01:47:18.680]  And it's the moment that you're willing to give it all that you find victory.
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:20.140]  What's that song?
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:23.541]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[01:47:23.541 --> 01:47:26.782]  And we ain't got nothing if we ain't free.
[01:47:26.782 --> 01:47:30.484]  Understand that?
[01:47:30.484 --> 01:47:33.304]  You ain't got nothing if you're not free.
[01:47:33.304 --> 01:47:34.805]  You ain't got nothing!
[01:47:37.162 --> 01:47:46.764]  The fake prosperity of the 90s as they were building up the Ponzi bubble, laughing at us, shutting up the police state grid, going, folks are going to get mad when we pull the trigger on them.
[01:47:46.764 --> 01:47:51.125]  And Bloomberg, I was listening to Bloomberg Radio yesterday, they were laughing at their listeners calling them stupid.
[01:47:51.125 --> 01:47:56.486]  Because they're talking to the intelligentsia class of business people that like to think of everybody as dumb.
[01:47:56.486 --> 01:48:03.368]  And let's figure out how to fleece dumb people instead of let's build up society so our sons and daughters have good people to be around.
[01:48:04.398 --> 01:48:10.349]  All you people that think you're part of the establishment, who think you prey on people, you're being preyed on as well.
[01:48:10.349 --> 01:48:12.052]  And you pollute the society.
[01:48:12.052 --> 01:48:14.556]  You pollute the culture.
[01:48:14.556 --> 01:48:16.700]  Jason in Connecticut, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:17.060]  Go ahead.
[01:48:18.274 --> 01:48:19.194]  Thank you for having me on.
[01:48:19.194 --> 01:48:21.235]  You're my Vince Lombardi, by the way.
[01:48:21.235 --> 01:48:22.716]  You know, forget these NFL guys.
[01:48:22.716 --> 01:48:24.196]  You're my Vince Lombardi.
[01:48:24.196 --> 01:48:31.459]  First, I want to take this moment and just say I want to remember my cousin John Sherry who died on 9-11 at the World Trade Center.
[01:48:31.459 --> 01:48:34.100]  He was a beautiful man and his life was taken.
[01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:38.221]  I speak for myself, not my family, when I know it was an inside job.
[01:48:38.221 --> 01:48:45.184]  You know, I was in Australia last year just walking around and, man, I saw guys in orange suits in people's yards.
[01:48:45.993 --> 01:48:47.754]  Digging through people's garbage.
[01:48:47.754 --> 01:48:49.515]  I mean, I wish I had a camera.
[01:48:49.515 --> 01:48:50.996]  No, no, it's on the news.
[01:48:50.996 --> 01:48:52.397]  It's funny you say orange.
[01:48:52.397 --> 01:48:53.677]  In some regions, they're yellow.
[01:48:53.677 --> 01:48:55.038]  In others, it's orange.
[01:48:55.038 --> 01:48:57.039]  And then they're the little minimum wage people.
[01:48:57.039 --> 01:49:01.582]  Then they call guys in green SWAT uniforms in with combat boots.
[01:49:01.582 --> 01:49:03.643]  And yeah, they dig through your garbage.
[01:49:03.643 --> 01:49:04.603]  They read your mail.
[01:49:04.603 --> 01:49:06.565]  They demand to come in your house.
[01:49:06.565 --> 01:49:12.408]  And the sheep farmers now pay, in the line item, a carbon footprint for the gas of the sheep.
[01:49:14.156 --> 01:49:15.518]  Alex, it was insane.
[01:49:15.518 --> 01:49:17.781]  I mean, they had trucks up and down the street.
[01:49:17.781 --> 01:49:19.944]  People just digging through garbage.
[01:49:19.944 --> 01:49:21.085]  I don't know what they were looking for.
[01:49:21.085 --> 01:49:22.327]  You probably know better than I do.
[01:49:22.327 --> 01:49:26.112]  No, a battery or plastic you were supposed to recycle and you go to jail.
[01:49:26.112 --> 01:49:27.253]  Oh, it's crazy.
[01:49:27.253 --> 01:49:27.894]  It's crazy.
[01:49:27.894 --> 01:49:28.815]  But let me ask you this.
[01:49:28.815 --> 01:49:32.240]  What is your prediction for this country in the next five years?
[01:49:34.269 --> 01:49:37.411]  My prediction is the destiny is in your hands.
[01:49:37.411 --> 01:49:39.333]  History is not a foregone conclusion.
[01:49:39.333 --> 01:49:45.117]  If we stand up and do the right thing, we can be given a reprieve like Nineveh.
[01:49:45.117 --> 01:49:47.518]  But it's going to be incredible tumult.
[01:49:47.518 --> 01:49:51.761]  They'll finally have to admit we're in a depression in the next six months to a year.
[01:49:51.761 --> 01:49:57.665]  They will, of course, offer new horrible global carbon taxes and VAT as Europe is now being offered.
[01:49:57.665 --> 01:50:00.187]  Our future is what you see happening in Europe now.
[01:50:00.187 --> 01:50:02.449]  Giant new taxes, major benefits cut.
[01:50:03.949 --> 01:50:16.573]  Military pensions slashed, police pensions slashed, and told, well at least you still got a job, as everything is paid to the foreign bankers who will then hoard the money and make sure it doesn't go back into the economy.
[01:50:16.573 --> 01:50:28.117]  While they hyperinflate the currency, so you both have a depression in the real economy, but also hyperinflated so what you've got doesn't buy as much, so it gets worse and worse and worse, and then only federal governments can come in
[01:50:28.957 --> 01:50:31.598]  And quote, bring order so we get sold on that.
[01:50:31.598 --> 01:50:35.759]  Just like they're saying in Europe, only a total dictatorship of the banks can fix this.
[01:50:35.759 --> 01:50:41.642]  They're like, we'll fix the economy, higher taxes, foreign banks run us, conquering them.
[01:50:41.642 --> 01:50:42.742]  That's what I see happening.
[01:50:42.742 --> 01:50:50.305]  Giant terror attacks blamed on domestic groups, secret arrest, crackdowns on political speech, paramilitary police executing people.
[01:50:50.305 --> 01:50:51.325]  You already see that happening.
[01:50:51.325 --> 01:50:54.706]  And it's like, oh well, they killed another guy.
[01:50:54.706 --> 01:50:56.227]  What's your prediction for the next five years?
[01:50:57.682 --> 01:50:59.463]  Something major is coming to play.
[01:50:59.463 --> 01:51:02.226]  I mean, there's a big event.
[01:51:02.226 --> 01:51:06.689]  Fight back this cold and flu season with the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[01:51:06.689 --> 01:51:07.550]  Why Ali-C?
[01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:11.113]  Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
[01:51:11.113 --> 01:51:18.799]  Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[01:51:19.159 --> 01:51:24.743]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[01:51:24.743 --> 01:51:29.967]  Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[01:51:29.967 --> 01:51:33.669]  One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:39.814]  Ali-C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

[01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:06.583]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:52:06.583 --> 01:52:13.008]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:52:13.008 --> 01:52:15.289]  Number one, study the past.
[01:52:15.289 --> 01:52:17.691]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:52:17.691 --> 01:52:21.414]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:52:22.529 --> 01:52:25.632]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:52:25.632 --> 01:52:29.455]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:52:29.455 --> 01:52:34.519]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:52:34.519 --> 01:52:37.922]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:52:38.502 --> 01:52:41.926]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:52:41.926 --> 01:52:46.410]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:52:46.410 --> 01:52:51.355]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[01:52:55.979 --> 01:52:58.121]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:53:00.399 --> 01:53:07.724]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.

[01:53:29.978 --> 01:53:31.219]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:53:31.219 --> 01:53:35.782]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:53:35.782 --> 01:53:41.606]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:53:41.606 --> 01:53:45.248]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:53:45.248 --> 01:53:48.070]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:53.013]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:53:53.013 --> 01:53:53.314]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:53:53.314 --> 01:53:54.675]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:54:01.919 --> 01:54:06.703]  It was an inside job.
[01:54:06.703 --> 01:54:09.164]  By the well-connected.
[01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:38.912]  Going back to Jason in Connecticut.
[01:54:38.912 --> 01:54:40.312]  So you say something big's coming.
[01:54:40.312 --> 01:54:42.132]  Clearly they've got the whole thing lined up.
[01:54:42.132 --> 01:54:44.373]  They're saying don't trust any of your neighbors.
[01:54:44.373 --> 01:54:56.377]  The FBI, I was reading an article this morning, admitted there were more than 50 flights grounded with abject total hysteria because there were brown people on board.
[01:54:56.377 --> 01:54:58.837]  One lady was Jewish.
[01:54:58.837 --> 01:55:00.158]  Strip searched everything.
[01:55:02.194 --> 01:55:06.095]  And it's just the wicked fleeth when none pursue.
[01:55:06.095 --> 01:55:14.699]  Meanwhile, in Mexico, LA Times reports more Mexico youth die from violence than car wrecks.
[01:55:14.699 --> 01:55:18.860]  Car wrecks under the age of 55 worldwide is the number one cause of death.
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:19.620]  Number one.
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:20.861]  But you still get your car.
[01:55:20.861 --> 01:55:24.402]  Because it's fun to drive and go places and you're brought up and taught it's safe.
[01:55:24.402 --> 01:55:26.543]  Mommy and Daddy put you in and drive off like it's no big deal.
[01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:28.811]  But we looked it up.
[01:55:28.811 --> 01:55:30.613]  On average, there's three shark deaths a year.
[01:55:30.613 --> 01:55:32.354]  People are totally scared to death of them.
[01:55:32.354 --> 01:55:34.196]  Tens of millions of deaths from automobiles.
[01:55:34.196 --> 01:55:35.157]  Not scared.
[01:55:35.157 --> 01:55:36.458]  Three shark deaths.
[01:55:36.458 --> 01:55:37.098]  Nightmares.
[01:55:37.098 --> 01:55:38.600]  Everyone afraid in the water.
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:40.701]  Flopping around in total fear.
[01:55:40.701 --> 01:55:42.423]  Mexico.
[01:55:42.423 --> 01:55:47.788]  There is, through movies and culture, I see it, a fear that Minutemen are killing thousands of Hispanics.
[01:55:47.788 --> 01:55:48.849]  Minutemen have never killed anybody.
[01:55:49.810 --> 01:55:51.531]  But they put it in movies, so it must be true.
[01:55:51.531 --> 01:55:56.052]  See, because all the death in Mexico is, I guess, in a way it is America.
[01:55:56.052 --> 01:55:58.253]  It's the ATF shipping the guns down.
[01:55:58.253 --> 01:56:03.655]  But they report on the thousands and thousands of young people absolutely murdered.
[01:56:03.655 --> 01:56:04.756]  And there's another report here.
[01:56:04.756 --> 01:56:10.098]  Hanging corpses of two young people, French news agency, carry threat to Mexico internet users.
[01:56:11.454 --> 01:56:15.860]  If you just comment on the drug gangs in Mexico, you're murdered.
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:26.293]  If you even report on it, the blood-stained bodies of a man and woman were found hanging from a bridge in Northeast Mexico yesterday, along with threatening messages to people who report drug violence on social networks.
[01:56:28.547 --> 01:56:30.469]  And that's why a lot of reporters here in the U.S.
[01:56:30.469 --> 01:56:32.831]  still say, oh, nobody's dying.
[01:56:32.831 --> 01:56:33.671]  There's no kidnappings.
[01:56:33.671 --> 01:56:34.732]  There's nothing going on.
[01:56:34.732 --> 01:56:37.294]  And the police roll over and take the payments.
[01:56:37.294 --> 01:56:39.777]  In Mexico, it's totally lawless now.
[01:56:39.777 --> 01:56:42.098]  The globalists bit off more than they could chew six years ago.
[01:56:43.086 --> 01:56:50.472]  They attempted to send in U.S.-trained troops, Los Zetas mainly, to knock out the three or four other big cartels.
[01:56:50.472 --> 01:56:59.600]  And the war just started, and quite frankly, the Mexican government and the globalists, because they're so corrupt and they're just drug gangs as well, they're losing.
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:00.921]  And humanity's losing.
[01:57:00.921 --> 01:57:04.905]  Of course, if you decriminalize drugs, it would all end overnight.
[01:57:06.837 --> 01:57:12.942]  But they've grown the gangs up so huge now that they would move on into other things like kidnapping, extortion.
[01:57:12.942 --> 01:57:15.404]  Oh, you want your Mexican football team to come here and play?
[01:57:15.404 --> 01:57:17.225]  Pay us $30,000 and we'll kill you.
[01:57:17.225 --> 01:57:19.086]  And they will kill you.
[01:57:19.086 --> 01:57:20.567]  And now it's starting to happen in the U.S.
[01:57:20.567 --> 01:57:22.049]  and the government just covers it up.
[01:57:22.049 --> 01:57:24.590]  Instead, it's see something, say something.
[01:57:24.590 --> 01:57:25.471]  It's a tea party.
[01:57:25.471 --> 01:57:26.712]  Watch out, they're going to kill you.
[01:57:26.712 --> 01:57:28.413]  And they've got cops and seminars trained.
[01:57:28.413 --> 01:57:29.394]  I've seen the video.
[01:57:29.394 --> 01:57:32.236]  It was on 60 Minutes last week.
[01:57:32.236 --> 01:57:32.937]  Re-aired on cable.
[01:57:34.485 --> 01:57:37.407]  Just literally going, we will all be attacked.
[01:57:37.407 --> 01:57:38.088]  Guaranteed.
[01:57:38.088 --> 01:57:38.688]  All Americans.
[01:57:38.688 --> 01:57:40.029]  There will be terror everywhere.
[01:57:40.029 --> 01:57:42.131]  We need armed guards everywhere.
[01:57:42.131 --> 01:57:43.071]  And who's going to attack?
[01:57:43.071 --> 01:57:44.973]  The evil right-wingers.
[01:57:44.973 --> 01:57:46.754]  Meanwhile, it's 30 plus thousand dead.
[01:57:46.754 --> 01:57:47.335]  Total battle.
[01:57:47.335 --> 01:57:48.195]  I'm pouring across.
[01:57:48.195 --> 01:57:50.077]  Absolute hell on earth.
[01:57:50.077 --> 01:57:51.698]  The government shipping the cocaine in.
[01:57:51.698 --> 01:57:52.859]  Guns into Mexico.
[01:57:52.859 --> 01:57:53.399]  All confirmed.
[01:57:53.399 --> 01:57:54.100]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[01:57:55.393 --> 01:57:57.014]  And it's the drug war will continue.
[01:57:57.014 --> 01:58:01.597]  Because the cops are laundering the money and the banks are, and this is what America is!
[01:58:01.597 --> 01:58:05.200]  And the eugenicists sit up on top of it all, laundering the money, putting poison in the water.
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:06.421]  So of course they're dealing the drugs.
[01:58:06.421 --> 01:58:08.162]  I mean, this is criminals we're talking about.
[01:58:08.162 --> 01:58:09.763]  Finishing up, Jason, you got about one minute.
[01:58:09.763 --> 01:58:11.925]  We'll come back with more calls than our guest.
[01:58:11.925 --> 01:58:14.427]  Jason, something big is coming, you said.
[01:58:14.427 --> 01:58:14.987]  Absolutely.
[01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:17.188]  You know, yesterday, I live in Fairfield County.
[01:58:17.188 --> 01:58:18.029]  People in Connecticut know that.
[01:58:18.029 --> 01:58:22.152]  I don't give my city away, but yesterday I was driving by a building.
[01:58:22.152 --> 01:58:23.133]  It's gated up.
[01:58:23.133 --> 01:58:23.393]  I saw 15
[01:58:25.305 --> 01:58:30.947]  Police cars from different cities, unmarked police cars, civilian cars at this one building.
[01:58:30.947 --> 01:58:32.828]  I think it's a brand new Fusion Center.
[01:58:32.828 --> 01:58:34.548]  They know something.
[01:58:34.548 --> 01:58:35.829]  They're preparing for something.
[01:58:35.829 --> 01:58:38.790]  It's going to be, I think it's going to make 9-11 look like a two-story building.
[01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:41.511]  I agree!
[01:58:41.511 --> 01:58:45.032]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.032 --> 01:58:47.193]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.916 --> 01:58:52.498]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:58:52.498 --> 01:58:55.941]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and eFoods Direct.
[01:58:55.941 --> 01:58:58.524]  I have eFoods for my own emergency food supply.
[01:58:58.524 --> 01:59:01.587]  You know Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[01:59:01.587 --> 01:59:02.388]  Very different.
[01:59:02.388 --> 01:59:05.892]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season.
[01:59:06.192 --> 01:59:12.316]  And we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[01:59:12.316 --> 01:59:14.577]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[01:59:14.577 --> 01:59:18.679]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[01:59:18.679 --> 01:59:22.341]  The huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's mind.
[01:59:22.341 --> 01:59:28.705]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses, and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[01:59:28.705 --> 01:59:30.386]  So everyone needs food security.
[01:59:30.546 --> 01:59:34.447]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from eFoods Direct.
[01:59:34.447 --> 01:59:37.667]  That's right, every order gets free shipping starting September 6th.

[01:59:53.890 --> 01:59:56.270]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:59.011]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:10.501]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.501 --> 02:00:12.081]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.081 --> 02:00:13.642]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.642 --> 02:00:17.822]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.822 --> 02:00:29.225]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.225 --> 02:00:34.606]  Alright, the FDA is moving to try to ban vitamin C. You cannot make this up.
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:38.922]  We're going to break down Codex Alimentarius and what's going on.
[02:00:38.922 --> 02:00:39.903]  I'll continue with your calls.
[02:00:39.903 --> 02:00:42.125]  I've been a bit wound up today.
[02:00:42.125 --> 02:00:45.227]  I'm also going to hit a smattering of more of the international news.
[02:00:45.227 --> 02:00:46.889]  Libya is still going on.
[02:00:46.889 --> 02:00:52.213]  They're going for Palestinian statehood, look for a big crisis to happen there.
[02:00:52.213 --> 02:00:56.016]  You've got Weiner, the Weiner seat lost in New York to a Republican.
[02:00:56.016 --> 02:00:58.978]  That's just people desperately running from party to party.
[02:00:58.978 --> 02:01:00.720]  We don't like Bush, Obama save us!
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:03.161]  We don't like Obama, Bachman save us!
[02:01:05.384 --> 02:01:09.927]  I don't know, the media does attack Bachman more than Mitt Romney or Rick Perry.
[02:01:09.927 --> 02:01:15.371]  So I guess that's why Ron Paul says he likes her, he just disagrees with her on some things.
[02:01:15.371 --> 02:01:23.357]  I mean, I gotta say, it's like Ron Paul, Bachman, and then you just can't vote for any of the others.
[02:01:23.357 --> 02:01:27.180]  And Bachman is not good compared to Ron Paul, I've just made a study of her.
[02:01:30.562 --> 02:01:39.008]  The word is you're going to get a Rick Perry Sarah Palin if that works or it's going to be a Rick Perry Bachman but now they've been fighting with each other so much.
[02:01:39.008 --> 02:01:40.789]  There was never behind the scenes stuff going on.
[02:01:40.789 --> 02:01:42.370]  There was behind the scenes with Palin.
[02:01:42.370 --> 02:01:43.471]  I've confirmed that.
[02:01:43.471 --> 02:01:45.252]  Do you understand me how big of news this is?
[02:01:45.252 --> 02:01:47.714]  The average person doesn't even believe me when I say this stuff.
[02:01:48.382 --> 02:01:52.903]  I told you Perry was going to have a pledge and break it and he wouldn't run and all this stuff and it happened.
[02:01:52.903 --> 02:01:57.044]  I told you that Lou Dobbs was going to Fox News three months before it happened.
[02:01:57.044 --> 02:01:58.545]  Everybody was blown away by that.
[02:01:58.545 --> 02:02:02.546]  And I said, we Fox business because I had that from sources.
[02:02:02.546 --> 02:02:09.167]  And I told you that Rick Perry and Sarah Palin, like two dogs have been sniffing each other's, you know, watch.
[02:02:09.167 --> 02:02:12.688]  They are looking at that.
[02:02:12.688 --> 02:02:13.909]  That is in the cards.
[02:02:13.909 --> 02:02:14.689]  I will tell you that.
[02:02:16.018 --> 02:02:17.419]  That is in the cards.
[02:02:17.419 --> 02:02:21.122]  Bigger than Dallas.
[02:02:21.122 --> 02:02:27.407]  And it could end up being a Romney-Bachman too.
[02:02:27.407 --> 02:02:30.969]  Oh, man.
[02:02:30.969 --> 02:02:32.891]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Iowa.
[02:02:32.891 --> 02:02:34.752]  Chris, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:02:34.752 --> 02:02:36.554]  Hey, I love your show.
[02:02:36.554 --> 02:02:38.035]  I would disagree just with that.
[02:02:38.035 --> 02:02:39.896]  I think Ron Paul is going to take it.
[02:02:39.896 --> 02:02:41.497]  I think there's enough Ron Paul people.
[02:02:41.497 --> 02:02:42.098]  I'm calling from
[02:02:42.637 --> 02:02:43.698]  Central Iowa.
[02:02:43.698 --> 02:02:45.259]  I was at the straw poll.
[02:02:45.259 --> 02:03:00.673]  It was Ron Paul people everywhere Michelle Bachmann people a little here a little there But Ron Paul people were everywhere and I found out a week later that if you want to see Randy Travis in concert I was confirmed you had to buy a ticket in the straw poll for her.
[02:03:00.673 --> 02:03:08.480]  No she bought 4,000 over 4,300 votes so Ron Paul beat her by about 90% even though he was a statistical
[02:03:09.401 --> 02:03:12.923]  The polls obviously are run by people that want you to... Even Jon Stewart, I can't really use that guy.
[02:03:34.847 --> 02:03:38.690]  But he did a great parody on how the media has been treating Ron Paul.
[02:03:38.690 --> 02:03:39.411]  It wasn't a parody.
[02:03:39.411 --> 02:03:41.813]  He showed the clubs how it's a talking point.
[02:03:41.813 --> 02:03:43.575]  And you know the fix is in.
[02:03:43.575 --> 02:03:45.336]  You said you disagree.
[02:03:45.336 --> 02:03:52.102]  If you took away from what I'm saying that Ron Paul isn't going to win, he can win, he should win, and he wins just by running.
[02:03:52.102 --> 02:03:58.448]  If he doesn't win the big prize, he wins by fighting and getting the word out and illustrating real issues and growing liberty.
[02:03:59.068 --> 02:04:00.590]  But he can win.
[02:04:00.590 --> 02:04:06.676]  I'm saying the establishment intends for the president to be Rick Perry.
[02:04:06.676 --> 02:04:07.357]  Okay?
[02:04:07.357 --> 02:04:13.703]  Inside baseball, Republicans, they want Rick Perry and they have put him and
[02:04:16.067 --> 02:04:17.587]  I believe you're probably right.
[02:04:17.587 --> 02:04:18.508]  I know they don't like Ron Paul.
[02:04:18.508 --> 02:04:19.928]  It's become so dang obvious.
[02:04:19.928 --> 02:04:21.469]  I mean, what if he had such a huge showing?
[02:04:44.025 --> 02:04:47.246]  That they can't, you know, they can't suppress him.
[02:04:47.246 --> 02:04:48.406]  Well, that's what's happening.
[02:04:48.406 --> 02:04:52.768]  That's what's happening right now, Chris.
[02:04:52.768 --> 02:04:54.468]  Beautiful.
[02:04:54.468 --> 02:04:55.769]  I agree with you.
[02:04:55.769 --> 02:04:56.849]  Ron Paul's dominating.
[02:04:56.849 --> 02:04:59.910]  That's why they're going, he can't win, he can't win, he can't win, he can't win, he can't win.
[02:05:02.327 --> 02:05:06.348]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:06.348 --> 02:05:09.589]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:14.390]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:20.772]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:20.772 --> 02:05:23.013]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:23.553 --> 02:05:23.853]  Tim Geithner?
[02:05:23.853 --> 02:05:24.373]  Bernanke?
[02:05:24.373 --> 02:05:25.033]  They're arsonists!
[02:05:25.033 --> 02:05:26.314]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:26.314 --> 02:05:28.554]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:42.458 --> 02:05:49.741]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:05:49.741 --> 02:05:58.844]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:06:02.082 --> 02:06:03.784]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:03.784 --> 02:06:09.091]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:06:09.091 --> 02:06:10.634]  Saving means to make money.
[02:06:10.634 --> 02:06:19.425]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:06:20.146 --> 02:06:27.668]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:06:27.668 --> 02:06:35.671]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[02:07:00.523 --> 02:07:05.087]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.087 --> 02:07:05.987]  Number one.
[02:07:05.987 --> 02:07:09.410]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.410 --> 02:07:10.271]  Number two.
[02:07:10.271 --> 02:07:15.174]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.174 --> 02:07:15.915]  It's true.
[02:07:15.915 --> 02:07:20.799]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.799 --> 02:07:21.619]  Number three.
[02:07:21.619 --> 02:07:25.202]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.202 --> 02:07:28.885]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.105 --> 02:07:29.886]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.886 --> 02:07:32.668]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.668 --> 02:07:36.331]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.331 --> 02:07:37.132]  Number 5.
[02:07:37.132 --> 02:07:41.276]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.276 --> 02:07:46.040]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:50.482]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:08:04.308 --> 02:08:07.109]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:29.588 --> 02:08:35.391]  We are live now, eight minutes into the third and final hour today.
[02:08:35.391 --> 02:08:38.332]  And of course, I'll be back tonight, seven o'clock.
[02:08:38.332 --> 02:08:50.658]  We're getting into this new Obama organization that openly says, report anyone that criticizes Obama and talks about basically going after people.
[02:08:50.658 --> 02:08:58.042]  We're gonna be talking about that towards the end of the show too today, but we're gonna have a special report tonight, seven o'clock, PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com.
[02:08:59.232 --> 02:09:15.618]  Now, I heard this last year, and I heard it earlier this year, but now they're moving forward with it, not just with injectable, but with all sorts of other forms, if you claim that it can have medical benefits.
[02:09:15.618 --> 02:09:21.740]  And what's happening is, two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling,
[02:09:22.819 --> 02:09:35.780]  Proved in major medical studies with animals that mega doses of huge overdoses of vitamin C, if it's raw real vitamin C, has near fountain of youth type effects.
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:40.022]  If you're not too far gone.
[02:09:40.022 --> 02:09:41.964]  And of course, everybody knows this.
[02:09:41.964 --> 02:09:54.879]  500 years ago, the Spanish, the French, everybody else couldn't go on long journeys because they didn't know why their teeth fell out and why old wounds opened up and why they got wrinkles all over them and collapsed and died.
[02:09:54.879 --> 02:09:55.240]  Scurvy!
[02:09:56.451 --> 02:10:10.099]  And the British, I don't know, it was like almost 400 years ago, you can look it up in their Royal Academy and Royal Society, they figured out that it was vitamin C. They didn't call it vitamin, they just said the essence of certain fruits.
[02:10:10.099 --> 02:10:17.984]  It was actually a British secret document for over 100 years and the French and others would still make fun of them.
[02:10:18.444 --> 02:10:19.485]  Because they found out about it.
[02:10:19.485 --> 02:10:28.131]  They said, oh yeah, you squeeze limes into the rum, because they all got their allotment of rum and water mixed together called grog.
[02:10:28.131 --> 02:10:34.636]  And they would, they would, there's accounts of them calling the British limeys.
[02:10:35.816 --> 02:10:43.722]  Because everywhere they went, they had big baskets and nets, including dried, hanging outside of limes.
[02:10:43.722 --> 02:10:48.485]  And the sailors didn't like to take baths, they didn't like to swim, they had all their own superstitions.
[02:10:48.485 --> 02:10:53.949]  In fact, a hundred years later, they were still complaining about the lime being added to their rum.
[02:10:53.949 --> 02:10:54.930]  They would throw fits about it.
[02:10:55.886 --> 02:11:05.712]  Uh, but, uh, it even became regulations on ships that weren't military, uh, because most of the captains were former military, uh, and, and would make them drink it.
[02:11:05.712 --> 02:11:09.835]  And so a British ship would be 5,000 miles away from home, pull up on a French ship.
[02:11:10.785 --> 02:11:21.494]  They could be outnumbered 2 to 1, and the French or the Spanish or the Portuguese would be hanging on the sides, almost dead, because people didn't even like fruit back then.
[02:11:21.494 --> 02:11:24.717]  They wouldn't even, when they got into ports, eat a lot of fruit.
[02:11:24.717 --> 02:11:28.040]  They thought for scurvy you ate a rat, which was actually true.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:32.264]  Rodents produce vitamin C naturally in their intestines.
[02:11:33.084 --> 02:11:48.030]  So it is true, if you eat a rat, even if you don't eat the intestines, it's in the bloodstream, that you will get a... Well, we have an expert on with us, pharmacist Ben Fuchs, and for those that don't know, pharmacists tend to know more than doctors.
[02:11:48.030 --> 02:11:53.932]  I know my dad's an oral surgeon and dentist, and he will call pharmacists, you know, ask them questions because they're the specialist.
[02:11:54.452 --> 02:11:59.015]  In these areas, they have to go through a lot of stuff even more rigorous than what doctors go through.
[02:11:59.015 --> 02:12:00.256]  They've got to know the interactions.
[02:12:00.256 --> 02:12:01.757]  They've got to know the biology.
[02:12:01.757 --> 02:12:03.558]  They've got to know the chemistry.
[02:12:03.558 --> 02:12:05.779]  And Ben Fuchs has been a pharmacist for decades.
[02:12:05.779 --> 02:12:10.022]  He's a leading health expert, and I haven't implemented all the stuff he does yet.
[02:12:10.022 --> 02:12:14.325]  I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about this, but I might as well.
[02:12:14.325 --> 02:12:14.905]  Aaron's proud of it.
[02:12:14.905 --> 02:12:20.048]  Aaron has lost over 40 pounds following what Ben Fuchs does exactly in two months.
[02:12:20.048 --> 02:12:20.489]  The guy
[02:12:21.710 --> 02:12:24.211]  is going to be skinny soon.
[02:12:24.211 --> 02:12:26.832]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:12:26.832 --> 02:12:30.794]  I've got family that started to implement it and it is miraculous.
[02:12:30.794 --> 02:12:33.535]  So I'm trying to do what Fuchs says.
[02:12:33.535 --> 02:12:41.099]  And I've actually, I don't know if you can tell, and I always lose some weight and gain it back, but I've lost about eight pounds the last two weeks just doing part of what Fuchs says to do.
[02:12:41.099 --> 02:12:43.480]  But that's another issue for another day.
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:50.083]  The reason I've got him on with us is FDA outlawing injectable vitamin C to further destroy health of Americans.
[02:12:50.703 --> 02:12:56.990]  And they've had a lot of mainline clinics, of course, injecting it intravenously and things.
[02:12:56.990 --> 02:13:00.334]  But now they're moving to say you can't take it as pill form.
[02:13:00.334 --> 02:13:03.658]  And if anybody advertises and says this has a health effect, you can't.
[02:13:03.658 --> 02:13:08.563]  Ladies and gentlemen, everyone knows that vitamin C, since the British discovered it,
[02:13:10.558 --> 02:13:21.927]  Everyone knows that it's an essential vitamin for the entire body's metabolic system, just as vitamin A that you don't really produce properly until you get sun.
[02:13:21.927 --> 02:13:23.288]  That's why you need some moderate sun.
[02:13:23.288 --> 02:13:25.769]  It's like the old doctor thing a hundred years ago.
[02:13:25.769 --> 02:13:31.894]  Eat some good fresh food, vegetables, fruits, and get some sun.
[02:13:31.894 --> 02:13:32.575]  Old nursing homes.
[02:13:32.575 --> 02:13:36.397]  I used to visit my great-grandmother in Dallas at her nursing home.
[02:13:36.397 --> 02:13:37.518]  She was 97 years old.
[02:13:37.518 --> 02:13:38.519]  They would roll her out
[02:13:41.627 --> 02:13:50.512]  Even when she was, you know, pretty much senile, didn't know who a lot of people were, they would roll them out and you'd see all the old folks lined up outside out there on a nice sunny spring day.
[02:13:50.512 --> 02:13:54.334]  Now, under federal guidelines, they say do not let them get any sun.
[02:13:54.334 --> 02:13:55.134]  None.
[02:13:55.134 --> 02:13:58.055]  And Cass Sunstein says he wants to make it the law.
[02:13:58.055 --> 02:14:01.357]  So vitamin C's bad, sunlight's bad.
[02:14:01.357 --> 02:14:05.219]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, they're really moving with Codex Alimentarius.
[02:14:05.219 --> 02:14:10.582]  Thank you for joining us and please break down exactly some of the big attacks we're seeing on health freedom right now.
[02:14:11.127 --> 02:14:13.889]  Well, first of all, thank you so much for all the kind words.
[02:14:13.889 --> 02:14:14.749]  I appreciate that, Alex.
[02:14:14.749 --> 02:14:16.390]  And thank you so much for the work that you're doing.
[02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:17.931]  I really appreciate that.
[02:14:17.931 --> 02:14:19.712]  And I know all of your listeners do as well.
[02:14:19.712 --> 02:14:30.058]  As far as vitamin C goes, the FDA is probably going to let Codex Alimentarius take care of their dirty work as far as outlawing certain supplements and keeping us from getting the doses that we need already.
[02:14:30.058 --> 02:14:37.642]  You can't get the doses that you need of vitamin C and other nutrients in places like Germany and Canada and some other countries in Europe.
[02:14:37.822 --> 02:14:48.551]  This whole thing around vitamin C is more like the FDA protecting drug manufacturers' turf against small manufacturers and against compounding pharmacists.
[02:14:48.551 --> 02:15:04.903]  It was in December of last year that this whole thing came about where the FDA ordered manufacturers to stop making injectable vitamin C and compounding pharmacists to stop making injectable vitamin C because, as you pointed out in your monologue there, vitamin C is amazingly powerful.
[02:15:04.903 --> 02:15:06.725]  It stands out singularly
[02:15:07.125 --> 02:15:08.266]  Among all nutrients.
[02:15:08.266 --> 02:15:11.067]  All nutrients are powerful in the sense that they're essential.
[02:15:11.067 --> 02:15:14.910]  The word essential means you better get it in your diet or you better be supplementing.
[02:15:14.910 --> 02:15:21.854]  And for people that don't know though, even people's pharmacy, great folks here in town, it's taking over and supplanting Walgreens.
[02:15:21.854 --> 02:15:23.995]  They're building locations everywhere.
[02:15:23.995 --> 02:15:29.879]  Medical doctors are now more and more ordering stuff from these original compounding pharmacies.
[02:15:30.539 --> 02:15:35.421]  And I've heard on local radio shows they have on 590 on the weekend, and I went and looked it up, it's true.
[02:15:35.421 --> 02:15:43.784]  They're trying to ban natural hormones that they're giving women that have had two or three miscarriages so they can have the baby with that supplement.
[02:15:43.784 --> 02:15:59.250]  They're trying to, I hear them griping about, they're trying to tell them they can't compound vitamin C. More and more, because real medicine, real natural drugs that are things like natural hormones, natural fats, natural vitamin C, is really starting to anger Big Pharma.
[02:15:59.890 --> 02:16:00.890]  That's the problem.
[02:16:00.890 --> 02:16:12.533]  It's big pharma, it's centralization, it's this massive monster in Washington that is protecting the turf of these big mega multinational corporations.
[02:16:12.533 --> 02:16:19.495]  And so the battle that we're witnessing is really between the FDA and local pharmacies who are responsive to
[02:16:19.875 --> 02:16:20.555]  They're clients.
[02:16:20.555 --> 02:16:28.360]  But the biggest statement that we can make as individuals, in my humble opinion, is to get ourselves on a good nutritional supplement program.
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:33.743]  Until we are well-nutriented, Alex, it will be like shooting fish in a barrel.
[02:16:33.743 --> 02:16:36.624]  It will be fodder for these big companies.
[02:16:36.624 --> 02:16:40.446]  Because when we're not healthy, we don't make good decisions.
[02:16:40.446 --> 02:16:43.728]  When we're not healthy, we will not be able to withstand this assault
[02:16:44.008 --> 02:16:44.228]  I think so.
[02:17:00.143 --> 02:17:00.383]  I think?
[02:17:20.382 --> 02:17:22.904]  And to commit to being conscious about how we eat.
[02:17:22.904 --> 02:17:30.651]  And like you were saying, how difficult it is sometimes to fight the urges, to fight the addictive drives for processed foods.
[02:17:30.651 --> 02:17:39.819]  The reason we have these addictive drives, and the reason we have these compulsions for food is because food manufacturers understand how to hit our hot buttons.
[02:17:39.819 --> 02:17:46.725]  And our hot buttons are around salt, and they're around fats, and they're around sweets, because we have certain hardwired drives
[02:17:47.045 --> 02:17:47.806]  That's what you've done.
[02:17:47.806 --> 02:17:52.673]  Aaron is taking the plant and animal derived essential fatty acids so he's not getting the calories.
[02:17:52.673 --> 02:17:53.774]  He's taking the whey shakes.
[02:18:02.546 --> 02:18:05.588]  He's eating the salads and he says he can eat all he wants.
[02:18:05.588 --> 02:18:06.969]  It tastes great.
[02:18:06.969 --> 02:18:09.630]  And he literally is shriveling up in there.
[02:18:09.630 --> 02:18:11.572]  And I am in the next few weeks.
[02:18:11.572 --> 02:18:14.133]  I've got to just fully launch on it.
[02:18:14.133 --> 02:18:16.795]  It's just it takes time and preparation to make sure I do it all.
[02:18:16.795 --> 02:18:19.156]  And I know my wife's going fully on it.
[02:18:19.156 --> 02:18:26.541]  I mean, well, I mean, I hate to bring him in here like a guinea pig, but in a few weeks, I'll bring Aaron in here and we'll show you a before and after of him on the show.
[02:18:26.541 --> 02:18:27.942]  It is miraculous.
[02:18:28.626 --> 02:18:44.767]  Well, you see, that's the reason I talk about the power of nutritional supplementation so much, is because when you start to meet your body's basic requirements for minerals, when you meet your body's basic requirement for essential fatty acids, when you meet your body's basic requirements for protein, you're not going to want the french fries.
[02:18:44.767 --> 02:18:45.708]  I hate willpower.
[02:18:45.868 --> 02:18:47.930]  I don't have any willpower at all.
[02:18:47.930 --> 02:18:52.373]  To me, it sounds like this horrible battle that's going on inside your body.
[02:18:52.373 --> 02:18:56.696]  Directing yourself towards good nutrients should be simple and should be easy.
[02:18:56.696 --> 02:19:04.001]  Once you've gotten yourself on a good nutritional supplement program, and that's one of the main reasons why I'm so big on Dr. Wallach's program at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:19:04.001 --> 02:19:06.823]  If anybody's interested, by the way, in learning more about these products, 877-551-1301.
[02:19:10.786 --> 02:19:11.067]  I think so.
[02:19:37.702 --> 02:19:40.323]  Stay there, I've got a lot of questions I want to go over.
[02:19:40.323 --> 02:20:00.850]  And yes, I was going to mention at the end that the particular formulations of Dr. Wallach, I know you've been involved in some of that, they're all available at InfoWarsTeam.com and your purchase of high quality vitamins, minerals and other supplements at InfoWarsTeam.com that Aaron and Rob Jacobson are now completely on, funds this operation.
[02:20:00.850 --> 02:20:01.230]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.230 --> 02:20:07.252]  Hey Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[02:20:07.552 --> 02:20:08.553]  That's easy, Bill.
[02:20:08.553 --> 02:20:12.696]  I'd head straight to soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:20:12.696 --> 02:20:14.197]  Soupbeansurvival.com?
[02:20:14.197 --> 02:20:24.365]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy, but this ancient secret has been around for over 8,000 years, and it truly is nature's super survival food.
[02:20:24.365 --> 02:20:24.965]  Really, Brian?
[02:20:24.965 --> 02:20:26.987]  The number one survival food?
[02:20:26.987 --> 02:20:28.848]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[02:20:29.108 --> 02:20:30.129]  Absolutely, Bill.
[02:20:30.129 --> 02:20:41.559]  The folks at soupbeansurvival.com scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds to truly find nature's super survival food.
[02:20:41.559 --> 02:20:43.660]  Brian, these aren't grocery store beans, are they?
[02:20:43.660 --> 02:20:44.541]  No way, Bill.
[02:20:44.541 --> 02:20:47.223]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[02:20:47.223 --> 02:20:47.704]  These are the
[02:20:47.984 --> 02:20:48.505]  Absolutely.
[02:21:11.007 --> 02:21:11.387]  I don't know.

[02:24:06.665 --> 02:24:13.109]  Alright, look, I'm going to get to Tim, Severin, and CJ at least, all the other callers.
[02:24:13.109 --> 02:24:16.812]  I'm sorry, we're not going to have time to get to you in the time we have left today.
[02:24:16.812 --> 02:24:24.337]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, um, isn't like the normal groups that are out there, hey, lose weight by taking speed and starving yourself.
[02:24:25.057 --> 02:24:33.265]  And then your body goes into a critical mode and as soon as you go off the diet you gain all the weight back and more.
[02:24:33.265 --> 02:24:36.288]  And I listen to his show almost every morning when I have a chance.
[02:24:36.288 --> 02:24:39.631]  It's on right before mine here at Genesis on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:39.631 --> 02:24:42.914]  And the rest of the office started listening and family of mine started listening.
[02:24:42.914 --> 02:24:46.717]  I mean I know he knows what he's talking about because I've been around the country with him at events.
[02:24:48.052 --> 02:24:52.934]  Met him out in California as well when I was out there speaking at an event.
[02:24:52.934 --> 02:24:58.936]  And talking to Ben, I never had time to implement it all.
[02:24:58.936 --> 02:25:03.557]  I have started doing the Tangy Tangerine and beyond Tangy Tangerine that is available.
[02:25:03.557 --> 02:25:11.079]  I do promote this stuff because I went out and searched the best stuff out there that I was going to start taking that's available in fullworksteam.com.
[02:25:11.079 --> 02:25:15.361]  But the issue here is that that has given me a lot more energy.
[02:25:16.321 --> 02:25:16.461]  I don't
[02:25:34.889 --> 02:25:35.350]  I don't know.
[02:25:52.428 --> 02:26:02.295]  Uh, and that's how, without even increasing my exercise, because I've been exercising forever basically, uh, I've been losing weight and getting in a lot better shape even though I'm under incredible stress.
[02:26:02.295 --> 02:26:08.779]  Now going back, this is a short segment, long one coming up, but pharmacist Ben, what else is going on out there in the news?
[02:26:08.779 --> 02:26:13.243]  Because, uh, I see a lot of attacks now on basic vitamins and minerals.
[02:26:13.243 --> 02:26:14.844]  I mean, if they're going after vitamin C now,
[02:26:15.464 --> 02:26:16.965]  And they're going after fish oil now.
[02:26:16.965 --> 02:26:18.627]  They're going after mainline stuff.
[02:26:18.627 --> 02:26:21.689]  That must mean that people are really starting to wake up.
[02:26:21.689 --> 02:26:23.070]  And then I go look at the market numbers.
[02:26:23.070 --> 02:26:23.991]  It's true.
[02:26:23.991 --> 02:26:27.714]  People are really discovering common sense nutrition now.
[02:26:27.714 --> 02:26:30.556]  Do you think the system's going to be successful in trying to clamp down on it?
[02:26:31.107 --> 02:26:38.071]  Oh heck no, there's no way they're going to be successful because people aren't satisfied with their prescription drugs that are being marketed as the alternative.
[02:26:38.071 --> 02:26:43.615]  Prescription drugs are being sold to us the way commodities are sold on television.
[02:26:43.615 --> 02:26:46.437]  You see pretty models and you see spokespeople and you see
[02:26:47.197 --> 02:26:49.738]  All kinds of sneaky marketing messages being sold.
[02:26:49.738 --> 02:27:01.202]  Do you ever notice how these cholesterol drugs that they're selling always feature these big buff guys who are mountain climbing or riding a mountain bike down a steep mountain road and they always look like the picture of health?
[02:27:01.202 --> 02:27:05.184]  The model that we're being sold is that prescription drugs are part of being healthy.
[02:27:05.524 --> 02:27:08.806]  And I'm telling you, as a pharmacist, nothing could be further from the truth.
[02:27:08.806 --> 02:27:12.348]  In fact, it's 180 degrees opposite from that.
[02:27:12.348 --> 02:27:27.057]  When you take a prescription drug, not only are you not healthy, not only are you not doing anything to improve your state of well-being, but prescription drugs are processed by the body as poison, and you begin to degrade the body's ability to do its work, to do what it's supposed to be doing.
[02:27:27.057 --> 02:27:33.021]  Pharmacist, let's be clear then for people, because I see different numbers, even in mainline media, but
[02:27:33.681 --> 02:27:37.762]  You know, I always say there's more deaths from automobile accidents than anything else.
[02:27:37.762 --> 02:27:46.044]  But really, from numbers I've seen, it's about to be eclipsed by prescription drug interaction deaths.
[02:27:46.044 --> 02:27:48.605]  And that's just the ones that are being confirmed.
[02:27:48.605 --> 02:27:51.566]  The medical community generally likes to cover up their own mistakes.
[02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:53.590]  Much worse than that.
[02:27:53.590 --> 02:28:12.159]  They're about the third or fourth leading cause of death right now that we know of, but many times people die of a heart attack supposedly, but they've been on polypharmacy, they've been on multiple drugs, and even though it says on the death certificate that their heart gave out, we don't know if it's the body's attempt to process eight or nine or ten different medicines that caused their heart to give out.
[02:28:12.159 --> 02:28:16.781]  So I suspect as a pharmacist that you're looking at much more than the third leading cause of death.
[02:28:16.781 --> 02:28:18.782]  It could conceivably even be one of the
[02:28:19.222 --> 02:28:20.023]  Here's an example.
[02:28:20.023 --> 02:28:20.483]  Exactly.
[02:28:20.483 --> 02:28:22.484]  Talk about this briefly because we've got a break.
[02:28:44.116 --> 02:28:57.992]  Shingles is a record rise, but I've read, even the old wives' treatments for this, that certain foods with minerals and vitamins, that it's a deficiency, has a much, much better effect rate than drugs or vaccines.
[02:28:59.326 --> 02:29:04.527]  The herpes zoster virus that causes shingles lives inside cells and it's an opportunistic virus.
[02:29:04.527 --> 02:29:06.248]  It waits for you to be sick.
[02:29:06.248 --> 02:29:08.408]  It waits for your immune system to be suppressed.
[02:29:08.408 --> 02:29:10.649]  It waits for you to be nutritionally deficient.
[02:29:10.649 --> 02:29:14.870]  It waits for you to be on prescription drugs so that your immune system is compromised.
[02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:16.290]  And then it bursts on you.
[02:29:16.290 --> 02:29:17.430]  Then it attacks.
[02:29:17.430 --> 02:29:21.291]  So if you have shingles and you're concerned about that, build your immune system up.
[02:29:21.291 --> 02:29:23.492]  Make sure you're taking your vitamin C and your nutrients.
[02:29:23.492 --> 02:29:24.812]  Reduce your sugar intake.
[02:29:25.092 --> 02:29:26.313]  Get out there and exercise.
[02:29:26.313 --> 02:29:31.115]  These are all powerful alternatives that not only will eliminate shingles but improve your health in general.
[02:29:31.115 --> 02:29:33.736]  I want to talk about eczema on the other side.
[02:29:33.736 --> 02:29:37.478]  A lot of people, that's as you know, pharmacists exploding.
[02:29:37.478 --> 02:29:41.459]  I want to get into weight loss briefly as well and then take some phone calls.
[02:29:41.459 --> 02:29:47.442]  And I want to talk about all this news coming out on Gardasil that they are buying off legislatures and Rick Perry.
[02:29:47.442 --> 02:29:48.242]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:48.242 --> 02:29:50.463]  GCNlive.com.
[02:29:50.463 --> 02:29:51.844]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.844 --> 02:29:53.345]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.364 --> 02:30:01.587]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.587 --> 02:30:08.230]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:13.372]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:13.372 --> 02:30:19.655]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:22.113 --> 02:30:28.544]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[02:30:30.455 --> 02:30:35.176]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:30:35.176 --> 02:30:39.017]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:30:39.017 --> 02:30:40.257]  Others don't.
[02:30:40.257 --> 02:30:42.398]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:30:42.398 --> 02:30:44.178]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:30:44.178 --> 02:30:47.079]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:30:47.079 --> 02:30:51.300]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:53.700]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:30:53.700 --> 02:30:56.401]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:30:56.401 --> 02:30:58.762]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:30:58.762 --> 02:30:59.262]  Others don't.
[02:31:02.641 --> 02:31:05.062]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:31:05.062 --> 02:31:06.323]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:06.323 --> 02:31:10.005]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:10.005 --> 02:31:12.506]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.506 --> 02:31:18.350]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:18.350 --> 02:31:24.573]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:25.013 --> 02:31:30.996]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:30.996 --> 02:31:35.178]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:35.178 --> 02:31:39.460]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:39.460 --> 02:31:45.403]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:45.403 --> 02:31:48.965]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.965 --> 02:31:50.946]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:50.946 --> 02:31:51.366]  It's here.

[02:32:00.629 --> 02:32:02.229]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:32:02.229 --> 02:32:05.671]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and eFoods Direct.
[02:32:05.671 --> 02:32:08.251]  I have eFoods for my own emergency food supply.
[02:32:08.251 --> 02:32:11.313]  You know Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[02:32:11.313 --> 02:32:12.093]  Very different.
[02:32:12.093 --> 02:32:15.594]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season.
[02:32:15.914 --> 02:32:22.036]  And we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[02:32:22.036 --> 02:32:24.297]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[02:32:24.297 --> 02:32:28.398]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[02:32:28.398 --> 02:32:32.060]  The huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's mind.
[02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:38.422]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses, and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[02:32:38.422 --> 02:32:40.263]  So everyone needs food security.
[02:32:40.263 --> 02:32:43.964]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from eFoods Direct.
[02:32:44.164 --> 02:32:44.805]  That's right.
[02:32:44.805 --> 02:32:47.387]  Every order gets free shipping starting September 6th.
[02:32:47.387 --> 02:32:53.712]  Get stocked up with the best storable foods out there with eFoods Direct and be prepared for any emergency before it happens.
[02:32:53.712 --> 02:32:56.474]  To take advantage of this special, call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:32:56.474 --> 02:32:57.194]  I just had an idea.
[02:33:14.159 --> 02:33:16.720]  I bet I can sell Aaron Dykes on it.
[02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:18.701]  You know, Aaron hosts this show sometimes.
[02:33:18.701 --> 02:33:24.444]  He also is going to be hosting InfoWars Nightly News one night coming up next week.
[02:33:24.444 --> 02:33:27.566]  Because I want to, you know, get him into that role.
[02:33:27.566 --> 02:33:30.928]  Also got some other interesting reporters I'm looking at hiring.
[02:33:30.928 --> 02:33:32.008]  One of them, well known.
[02:33:32.008 --> 02:33:35.370]  We'll just talk about that in the next few weeks if that does happen.
[02:33:35.370 --> 02:33:36.971]  Or InfoWars Nightly News, but I...
[02:33:38.300 --> 02:33:39.161]  I had the idea.
[02:33:39.161 --> 02:33:44.325]  That's a great banner campaign idea for InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:33:44.325 --> 02:33:47.728]  Because nothing sells like the truth and success.
[02:33:47.728 --> 02:33:50.871]  I was planning to do this with myself, but I've got to actually do the program fully.
[02:33:53.151 --> 02:33:59.934]  But I can take, we never did before and after too bad with Aaron, but we've got shots of him from when he's been on TV.
[02:33:59.934 --> 02:34:06.697]  And then we'll get him back in here and get another shot off the same camera, you know, video still of him literally losing like 40 pounds.
[02:34:06.697 --> 02:34:09.998]  And he's totally following pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[02:34:09.998 --> 02:34:12.239]  And he's saying, yeah, I've had diets before.
[02:34:12.239 --> 02:34:14.640]  Cause you know, he sits in there and works 18 hours a day.
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:15.601]  I can't even get him out of here.
[02:34:16.161 --> 02:34:17.583]  It's not like he's a slave in a cage.
[02:34:17.583 --> 02:34:21.487]  I'm like, sometimes I come here and he's up the next day working with no, nothing but coffee.
[02:34:21.487 --> 02:34:23.029]  And I'm like, dude, go home.
[02:34:23.029 --> 02:34:24.610]  He's like, but I got to battle these people.
[02:34:24.610 --> 02:34:25.892]  I got to finish this project.
[02:34:25.892 --> 02:34:27.393]  Look at all these documents I discovered.
[02:34:27.393 --> 02:34:29.335]  They really are putting cancer viruses in Alex.
[02:34:29.335 --> 02:34:30.136]  We ain't got to warn them.
[02:34:30.136 --> 02:34:31.738]  I'm like, I know, I know.
[02:34:31.738 --> 02:34:32.979]  That's why he's great.
[02:34:32.979 --> 02:34:34.581]  But this has really worked for Aaron.
[02:34:35.442 --> 02:34:42.686]  So yes, I'm pitching you to also sign up at Infowarsteam.com and a little bit of profit we make when you buy the great products.
[02:34:42.686 --> 02:34:45.867]  You can also sign up, become a distributor and get a big discount.
[02:34:45.867 --> 02:34:49.889]  You can also just be a buyer at Infowarsteam.com with the Young Jevity products.
[02:34:49.889 --> 02:34:53.771]  Then that goes on to support this radio show and that's what I believe in.
[02:34:53.771 --> 02:34:56.813]  Promote things I believe in like gold and silver, look what they've done.
[02:34:56.813 --> 02:35:01.835]  Promote really good, true, scientific health products where they really know what they're doing.
[02:35:01.835 --> 02:35:02.856]  That's what Young Jevity does.
[02:35:03.696 --> 02:35:05.057]  It's the same thing across the board.
[02:35:05.057 --> 02:35:11.561]  Our political analysis, our news analysis, our historical analysis, it's spot on because we do the work.
[02:35:11.561 --> 02:35:14.682]  That's what InfoWarsTeam.com is all about.
[02:35:14.682 --> 02:35:16.203]  But I want to get to some of your calls.
[02:35:16.203 --> 02:35:20.006]  But here's some of the news that's just come out in the last 30 minutes at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:20.006 --> 02:35:21.286]  Really creepy.
[02:35:21.286 --> 02:35:25.048]  British footballer under investigation for 9-11 comments.
[02:35:25.048 --> 02:35:26.549]  That's right now.
[02:35:26.549 --> 02:35:29.091]  In England, if you now criticize global warming.
[02:35:29.755 --> 02:35:32.417]  You get a police visit, like it's illegal.
[02:35:32.417 --> 02:35:39.240]  If you say 9-11 is an inside job, then you get a police visit.
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:41.181]  You can't make this up.
[02:35:41.181 --> 02:35:48.786]  And the article's up at Infowars.com, and Kurt has links to the BBC, who's reporting on it like it's a good thing!
[02:35:49.676 --> 02:35:53.482]  See, they're getting so desperate now, they're like, we'll arrest you, okay?
[02:35:53.482 --> 02:35:54.784]  It's not an inside job.
[02:35:54.784 --> 02:35:55.785]  Shut up.
[02:35:55.785 --> 02:35:57.508]  Don't talk about it anymore.
[02:35:57.508 --> 02:36:00.312]  We really want to stage this again.
[02:36:00.312 --> 02:36:01.854]  You're taking our favorite tool away!
[02:36:01.854 --> 02:36:02.916]  Stop it!
[02:36:02.916 --> 02:36:04.898]  We want another Oklahoma City to blame domestic groups!
[02:36:06.752 --> 02:36:08.273]  Well, I'll cover this more.
[02:36:08.273 --> 02:36:09.113]  There's another one.
[02:36:09.113 --> 02:36:19.480]  Nigel Farage, one of the big leaders of the UK Independence Party, Greece under full globalist dictatorship, EU head, calls for more European federalism.
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:20.681]  That's what I've been warning you about.
[02:36:21.553 --> 02:36:26.778]  They engineered the crisis, signed over to the foreign banks, and then tried to hand the entire country over.
[02:36:26.778 --> 02:36:29.060]  I want to get Nigel Farage back on.
[02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:32.784]  UKIP members emailed me and said, we want Nigel, we want Nigel, we want Nigel.
[02:36:32.784 --> 02:36:33.845]  I know you want him.
[02:36:33.845 --> 02:36:36.307]  He's been so busy and he barely survived that plane crash.
[02:36:37.168 --> 02:36:40.912]  And he's busy in the EU Parliament, and he said, good job.
[02:36:40.912 --> 02:36:42.574]  Will you interview one of my other party members?
[02:36:42.574 --> 02:36:44.355]  I'm so busy.
[02:36:44.355 --> 02:36:46.257]  But you tell him to come on.
[02:36:46.257 --> 02:36:47.398]  We'll get Lord Monkton on too.
[02:36:47.398 --> 02:36:48.520]  He's part of UKIP.
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:49.741]  But Farage is a great guy.
[02:36:49.741 --> 02:36:51.723]  That's a key article up there.
[02:36:51.723 --> 02:36:54.225]  So the power grab is going on pell-mell.
[02:36:54.225 --> 02:36:57.669]  But I'm telling you, if you get your body in gear,
[02:36:59.195 --> 02:37:08.117]  And again, I've just been doing this really, I was barely doing it for the last six months, barely, just the energy drinks that are vitamins and minerals that didn't help me.
[02:37:08.117 --> 02:37:16.400]  But then the last two weeks, I've been doing the whey shakes and doing the products that Phibbs particularly recommends from Infoworksteam.com.
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:19.341]  And I mean, usually I run a mile and a half, I've got to stop.
[02:37:19.341 --> 02:37:20.301]  I'm running three miles now.
[02:37:21.301 --> 02:37:23.082]  I'm having a lot more energy.
[02:37:23.082 --> 02:37:27.525]  My wife's been talking about it, so she started it as well, having big effects.
[02:37:27.525 --> 02:37:29.206]  And again, I know I'm pitching, pitching, pitching.
[02:37:29.206 --> 02:37:30.647]  It's because it really works.
[02:37:30.647 --> 02:37:34.149]  Talk about weight loss, because Aaron can listen every day.
[02:37:34.149 --> 02:37:35.750]  I can only listen a few days a week.
[02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:40.252]  Break down in like four or five minutes your weight loss.
[02:37:40.252 --> 02:37:41.353]  You don't even call it weight loss.
[02:37:41.353 --> 02:37:43.714]  You say, get healthy, you'll lose weight.
[02:37:43.714 --> 02:37:44.535]  Explain this to us.
[02:37:46.204 --> 02:37:47.325]  We're good to go!
[02:38:16.124 --> 02:38:16.424]  I think?
[02:38:31.673 --> 02:38:31.954]  I think so.
[02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:47.331]  I think so.
[02:39:10.186 --> 02:39:19.571]  Not stopping the potato chips and the french fries and all these foods that have the fake satiety button, satisfaction button chemicals, but not the real nutrients.
[02:39:19.571 --> 02:39:26.135]  So the key to being able to withstand the assault from the french fries and the potato chips and the pizza and all the fast foods that we like.
[02:39:26.135 --> 02:39:29.757]  And by the way, notice that all the foods that we like are combinations of salt,
[02:39:30.137 --> 02:39:30.557]  We're good to go!
[02:39:53.573 --> 02:39:58.758]  And when we supplement with minerals, we can withstand the salt cravings, and that's the key.
[02:39:58.758 --> 02:40:12.752]  It's to outsmart the food processors and to outsmart your drives by giving yourself protein to withstand sugar, giving yourself minerals to withstand salt cravings, and by giving yourself essential fatty acids to withstand the fat cravings.
[02:40:12.752 --> 02:40:17.877]  And if I had to pick one thing, one single supplement to tell everybody to take right away, I would tell you it's essential
[02:40:18.097 --> 02:40:18.917]  Okay, what's the best kind?
[02:40:18.917 --> 02:40:25.040]  Because you've got the fish oil based at Infowarsteam.com, and you've got the plant based, and I've heard you say taking both is good.
[02:40:36.605 --> 02:40:39.246]  Well, as far as fats, you're talking about essential fatty acids?
[02:40:39.246 --> 02:40:40.066]  Yes.
[02:40:40.066 --> 02:40:41.466]  I like the Ultimate EFAs.
[02:40:41.466 --> 02:40:45.027]  The Ultimate EFAs are balanced with the two main essential fatty acids.
[02:40:45.027 --> 02:40:49.168]  They're very reasonably priced, and it doesn't take very long for you to notice a fact.
[02:40:49.168 --> 02:40:51.168]  You were talking about eczema before we went to break.
[02:40:51.168 --> 02:40:53.329]  That's plant-derived, though, right?
[02:40:53.329 --> 02:40:54.729]  Well, essential fatty acids are not.
[02:40:54.729 --> 02:40:55.550]  You're thinking of minerals.
[02:40:55.550 --> 02:40:56.670]  Minerals are plant-derived.
[02:40:56.670 --> 02:41:01.371]  The essential fatty acids... No, I know, but they have some essential fatty acids that are plant-derived.
[02:41:01.371 --> 02:41:01.991]  They are.
[02:41:01.991 --> 02:41:04.612]  Omega-6 fats... No, I know, because I just started taking those.
[02:41:06.152 --> 02:41:06.532]  That's right.
[02:41:06.532 --> 02:41:07.773]  They are vegetable-based.
[02:41:07.773 --> 02:41:10.334]  Those are flaxseed-based.
[02:41:10.334 --> 02:41:15.977]  Omega-6 oils come from sunflower and safflower, and omega-3 oils come from flaxseed.
[02:41:15.977 --> 02:41:17.758]  So those are vegetable-based.
[02:41:17.758 --> 02:41:24.122]  The only essential fatty acid that's found in animals is fish oil, and that's not really a parent essential fatty acid.
[02:41:24.122 --> 02:41:33.247]  That is a derivative essential fatty acid, and it's important, but it's not as important as real parent essential fatty acid oils, which are flaxseed oil and then sunflower and safflower.
[02:41:33.247 --> 02:41:34.107]  Okay, get back to the eggs.
[02:41:35.928 --> 02:41:36.529]  That's right.
[02:41:36.529 --> 02:41:38.090]  Skincare is one of my specialties.
[02:41:38.090 --> 02:41:42.173]  I've been formulating skincare products for almost 30 years now and I know a lot about the skin.
[02:41:42.173 --> 02:41:47.036]  And let me tell you something, when you have something going on in your skin, you can rest assured it's not in a vacuum.
[02:41:47.036 --> 02:41:49.298]  You have something going on in the rest of your body.
[02:41:49.298 --> 02:41:54.942]  When you see eczema, psoriasis, acne, dry skin, rosacea, you have a biochemical breakdown.
[02:41:55.182 --> 02:41:55.983]  I think?
[02:42:18.422 --> 02:42:25.343]  Eczema, by the way, is attached to digestive problems, especially with children, dairy allergies, wheat allergies.
[02:42:25.343 --> 02:42:32.905]  If you have a digestive issue and a skin care problem, more than likely your skin care problem is related to something you eat.
[02:42:32.905 --> 02:42:39.306]  There is an intimate connection between the cells that make up the digestive system and the cells that make up the skin.
[02:42:39.306 --> 02:42:41.686]  There's a connection between the two.
[02:42:41.686 --> 02:42:44.967]  When you have a digestive problem, it very often will show up on the skin.
[02:42:45.327 --> 02:42:45.547]  I think?
[02:43:02.285 --> 02:43:03.347]  And zinc!
[02:43:03.347 --> 02:43:12.878]  Zinc deficiency is one of the most unfortunate nutritional deficiencies we confront because it's so inexpensive, yet zinc is involved in hundreds of different chemical reactions.
[02:43:12.878 --> 02:43:21.549]  It's stored in the skin, it's involved in making collagen, it's involved in fighting bacteria and fighting acne, yet most Americans who are not supplementing are going to be deficient in zinc.
[02:43:24.147 --> 02:43:29.291]  What would you recommend just for overall general health?
[02:43:29.291 --> 02:43:34.615]  How would you start out if you were going and getting some of the vitamins and minerals and other things that are at Infowarsteam.com?
[02:43:34.615 --> 02:43:39.598]  Healthy Start Pack is the first thing I would do, and if you want to throw something else in, I'd throw the Ultimate Multis.
[02:43:39.598 --> 02:43:48.705]  The Healthy Start Pack is your OsteoFX, it's your essential fatty acids, and my favorite product in that whole line, and let me tell you, that is a very respectable line, and I formulate products myself.
[02:43:49.065 --> 02:43:54.590]  So when I look at formulations, I'm looking at them not only as a pharmacist and as a consumer, but also as a formulator.
[02:43:54.590 --> 02:44:00.134]  And my favorite product in that entire line is the Beyond Tangy Tangerine because it's liquid nutrition.
[02:44:00.134 --> 02:44:07.700]  And when you get yourself nutrients without having to put a digestive or a caloric load on your system, your body loves you.
[02:44:07.700 --> 02:44:13.085]  And one of the beautiful things about nutritional supplementation is the more deficient you are, Alex, this is so cool to me.
[02:44:13.485 --> 02:44:18.147]  The more deficient you are, the faster your body absorbs those nutrients.
[02:44:18.147 --> 02:44:21.488]  Like a dry sponge sucks up more water than a wet sponge.
[02:44:21.488 --> 02:44:25.750]  So when you get on the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, it doesn't take you a month to notice results.
[02:44:25.750 --> 02:44:27.630]  It doesn't even take you weeks to notice results.
[02:44:27.630 --> 02:44:29.891]  You notice results within days.
[02:44:29.891 --> 02:44:34.333]  And the sicker you are, the more nutritionally deficient you are, the faster you notice results.
[02:44:34.333 --> 02:44:39.955]  And given that over 100 million Americans are suffering from digestive issues and digestive problems, it makes
[02:44:40.575 --> 02:44:50.716]  Amazing sense to give yourself dense nutrition without having to interface with the digestive system, without putting stress on the digestive system, on enzymes, on the liver, on the gallbladder, on the pancreas.
[02:44:52.225 --> 02:44:54.206]  Yontang Tangerine to answer your question.
[02:44:54.206 --> 02:45:10.697]  Well that's, I mean, I've noticed that if I've got to do like some midnight radio show and I ate dinner at like 7 and I'm like, I'm hungry again, I could drink orange juice before, I could even eat a hot dog out of the refrigerator, something unhealthy, whatever, it would not satisfy me.
[02:45:10.697 --> 02:45:21.024]  But if I just go do a Tangy Tangerine, there's almost no calories in there but there's all the vitamins, all the minerals, bam, drink that, and I really feel it and go to bed and feel great.
[02:45:21.685 --> 02:45:24.896]  And so, that's the main thing I've been doing is the Tangy Tangerine.
[02:45:25.345 --> 02:45:25.865]  That's another.
[02:45:25.865 --> 02:45:26.846]  You raised a very good point.
[02:45:26.846 --> 02:45:30.407]  You know, sometimes people wake up in the middle of the night and they can't go back to sleep.
[02:45:30.407 --> 02:45:33.069]  That's because you've got this hypoglycemia going on.
[02:45:33.069 --> 02:45:36.150]  Your body is trying to process things and it's requiring nutrients.
[02:45:36.150 --> 02:45:42.653]  But if you don't have nutrients in your body or enough nutrients in your body in the middle of the night, you're going to go into low blood sugar.
[02:45:42.653 --> 02:45:42.953]  Bam!
[02:45:42.953 --> 02:45:44.594]  Your adrenal glands are going to kick in.
[02:45:44.594 --> 02:45:48.956]  You're going to pump out stress hormone and you will wake up and you're not going to be able to go back to sleep.
[02:45:48.956 --> 02:45:54.339]  But if you do some Slender FX protein or some Beyond Tangy Tangerine or some magnesium before you go to bed,
[02:45:54.759 --> 02:45:57.443]  That will help your body do its work during the night.
[02:45:57.443 --> 02:46:02.812]  It won't have to go into cortisol or adrenal energy, and you'll be able to sleep better through the night.
[02:46:02.812 --> 02:46:09.342]  So taking Beyond Tangy Tangerine, taking protein before you go to bed, is one of the best strategies you could do to get yourself a good night's sleep.
[02:46:10.523 --> 02:46:14.086]  Well, we're gonna do this side-by-side with Aaron.
[02:46:14.086 --> 02:46:19.630]  I can probably twist his arm into doing it just so people can see it, but people can watch him on the nightly news when he files reports.
[02:46:19.630 --> 02:46:25.274]  He did one, what, Friday night, and people were watching it and going, whoa!
[02:46:25.274 --> 02:46:27.655]  I mean, where did Aaron Dykes go?
[02:46:27.655 --> 02:46:29.216]  And it's just in a couple months.
[02:46:29.216 --> 02:46:32.959]  And he says, the thing about it before is, dieting would be like torture.
[02:46:32.959 --> 02:46:34.120]  It's the same for me.
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:36.562]  But not when you take the essential fatty acids
[02:46:37.062 --> 02:46:39.845]  And the other thing is because your body's like, Oh, I'm getting what I need.
[02:46:39.845 --> 02:46:43.108]  And then you just eat moderate, healthy food and you feel great.
[02:46:43.108 --> 02:46:44.970]  And I'm going to, I'm going to do it.
[02:46:44.970 --> 02:46:59.205]  I mean, I've launched the TV show and I've got all these other things happening and going on, but I'm going to announce here on air that I'm going to really try to follow your regimen to a T with the longevity products at info wars team.com.
[02:46:59.205 --> 02:46:59.646]  And I'm so
[02:47:00.226 --> 02:47:01.467]  So very excited about that.
[02:47:01.467 --> 02:47:08.712]  Now, I've got callers that have been holding, and they're going to be all over the map, and I'm sure you can comment on these modern-day issues they're raising as well.
[02:47:08.712 --> 02:47:11.633]  Let's go to Severin in California.
[02:47:11.633 --> 02:47:13.355]  Thank you, California.
[02:47:13.355 --> 02:47:14.715]  Severin from California.
[02:47:14.715 --> 02:47:16.357]  That's a new town.
[02:47:16.357 --> 02:47:17.217]  I'm like Schwarzenegger.
[02:47:17.217 --> 02:47:19.018]  California!
[02:47:19.018 --> 02:47:20.319]  Severin, welcome.
[02:47:20.319 --> 02:47:21.240]  Thanks for having me.
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:26.723]  I actually just have three quick stories that I want to get through just so everyone can hear them.
[02:47:26.723 --> 02:47:28.945]  First off, I don't know if you guys have heard, but
[02:47:29.969 --> 02:47:49.785]  The EU has leaked plans for, and this is courtesy of Zero Hedge, plans for formulating Euroteams in order to, I'll read you the quote, in order to, get that up here, in conjunction with Eurobonds, EU officials have been working on plans to create Euroteams for the Olympics, World Cup, and Eurovision Song Contest.
[02:47:49.785 --> 02:47:57.411]  Officially, the effort is supposed to solidify the fiscal union that will have to occur to make Eurobonds a success the market has already decided they would be.
[02:47:58.674 --> 02:48:02.176]  So basically that just, you know, lines up with what you've been saying for years.
[02:48:02.176 --> 02:48:18.684]  Second story, as I'm sure everyone knows, the markets are rallying today and the primary reason for that, I work in the stock market so I've got all this news pouring in, over the past day we've had rumors, first Russia was going to bail out the Eurozone, then Britain.
[02:48:18.684 --> 02:48:19.225]  China!
[02:48:19.225 --> 02:48:20.185]  China!
[02:48:20.185 --> 02:48:21.566]  Italy's openly gone to them, yeah.
[02:48:22.734 --> 02:48:24.414]  The question is, who's going to bail out China?
[02:48:24.414 --> 02:48:30.416]  There's a report out today that China's basically in the same situation that we were in before the housing bubble burst.
[02:48:30.416 --> 02:48:36.837]  So my commentary on that is maybe Paul Krugman was right about his alien invasion predictions.
[02:48:36.837 --> 02:48:39.218]  Maybe the Martians will bail us out this time.
[02:48:39.218 --> 02:48:44.679]  And the last one is actually, it's borderline Enron type news.
[02:48:44.679 --> 02:48:50.500]  There's a company, a Canadian company called Silver Corp Metals, they're a silver mining company.
[02:48:50.942 --> 02:48:59.805]  The Canadian company that operates primarily in China, on the 2nd of September, there was an anonymous letter sent to the Canadian and U.S.
[02:48:59.805 --> 02:49:04.507]  SEC, basically accusing them of $1.5 billion of accounting fraud.
[02:49:04.507 --> 02:49:08.568]  That sent the price of the stock down about 20-plus percent.
[02:49:08.568 --> 02:49:10.009]  They refuted the claims.
[02:49:10.009 --> 02:49:11.910]  They came out with plenty of documentation.
[02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:18.452]  They posted all their bank statements and everything showing that they had all the money they said that they had, and the stock rallied on the news.
[02:49:19.365 --> 02:49:33.637]  Then yesterday, there was another report leaked by some completely anonymous little-known website, basically written in the same style, but they denied being associated with it, set the price down to new 52-week lows.
[02:49:33.637 --> 02:49:41.843]  And basically what's happening, in my opinion, is that the same people that rigged the COMEX and all the silver and gold manipulators, they're losing control of that.
[02:49:41.843 --> 02:49:46.847]  And so now they're taking an aim at legitimate equities to get people scared out of gold and silver.
[02:49:48.144 --> 02:49:48.610]  It's just, it's...
[02:49:49.778 --> 02:49:55.462]  Completely ridiculous that an anonymous report these days from some, you know, somebody that's openly shorting the stock.
[02:49:55.462 --> 02:49:59.685]  Well, that's what WikiLeaks is all about, is to selectively target people.
[02:49:59.685 --> 02:50:00.866]  You know, I'm glad you raised this.
[02:50:00.866 --> 02:50:02.928]  I'd actually seen this a few weeks ago.
[02:50:02.928 --> 02:50:06.230]  I don't think it's really breaking, but I do like Zero Hedge.
[02:50:06.230 --> 02:50:09.192]  In fact, I want to get some of the people from Zero Hedge on.
[02:50:09.192 --> 02:50:10.573]  That's some of the guests I want to get on.
[02:50:10.573 --> 02:50:14.836]  I know that they do do interviews through Nom to Gares.
[02:50:14.836 --> 02:50:18.059]  But secret EU plans to create Euro teams leaked.
[02:50:19.008 --> 02:50:19.168]  I don't
[02:50:41.523 --> 02:50:44.405]  And North America and Asia, then they merge all of those.
[02:50:44.405 --> 02:50:46.967]  I'll get Ben Fuchs' take on that on the other side.
[02:50:46.967 --> 02:50:48.848]  Glad you raised those points.
[02:50:48.848 --> 02:50:51.070]  More calls straight ahead after this break.
[02:50:51.070 --> 02:50:53.311]  We'll talk to Tim, CJ, and others.
[02:50:53.311 --> 02:50:55.212]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs is our guest.
[02:50:55.212 --> 02:50:57.354]  The website's infowarsteam.com.

[02:51:31.008 --> 02:51:32.249]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:32.249 --> 02:51:36.832]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:51:36.832 --> 02:51:42.636]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[02:51:42.636 --> 02:51:46.278]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:51:46.278 --> 02:51:49.000]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:54.043]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:52:02.569 --> 02:52:13.256]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:52:13.256 --> 02:52:20.461]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.

[02:54:01.506 --> 02:54:03.247]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[02:54:07.447 --> 02:54:18.096]  You know, in the past, I would say, I'll see you tomorrow because the show's almost over after a few more calls, but I'm back tonight with a focused, hard-hitting, condensed news transmission.
[02:54:18.096 --> 02:54:27.085]  Now, on average, the nightly news is about an hour long, but I've got to start behaving myself soon and holding it 230 minutes for television, but then we'll have special reports that come after it.
[02:54:27.085 --> 02:54:29.327]  I'm also thinking about just making it an hour long every night.
[02:54:30.799 --> 02:54:34.851]  But, and I plan to add more shows and do a lot, but we need your support first.
[02:54:34.851 --> 02:54:36.576]  And when you're a prisonplanet.tv member.
[02:54:37.997 --> 02:54:45.262]  When you support us at Infowarsteam.com and get great products, when you buy the books, the t-shirts, all of it, that's what builds this alternative media system.
[02:54:45.262 --> 02:54:53.448]  Also, be sure and support your local AM and FM affiliates, support their local sponsors, spread the word about those stations as well.
[02:54:53.448 --> 02:54:59.112]  What do you make of the banking takeover, Ben Fuchs, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs joining us?
[02:54:59.112 --> 02:55:01.374]  I mean, it's just open banker dictatorship.
[02:55:02.034 --> 02:55:05.575]  With the very authors of the financial implosion posing as the saviors.
[02:55:05.575 --> 02:55:08.696]  And now they say you must cheer the Euro.
[02:55:08.696 --> 02:55:12.557]  We're getting rid of your football teams.
[02:55:12.557 --> 02:55:21.480]  You've got to join the global Euro team so that everybody can feel their, their, not their national patriotism, but their worship of the Euro.
[02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:23.020]  I mean, can this get any more transparent?
[02:55:23.624 --> 02:55:26.465]  It's all about centralization, Alex, and that's the big problem.
[02:55:26.465 --> 02:55:32.707]  It's all about power being centralized in one place, away from the people, into centralized powers.
[02:55:32.707 --> 02:55:35.607]  And that's what we as individuals have to stand up for.
[02:55:35.607 --> 02:55:39.468]  We have to disengage from the monster, the leviathan, the machine.
[02:55:39.468 --> 02:55:44.510]  And that's why I'm so big on the power of nutritional supplementation and the power of taking back our health.
[02:55:44.510 --> 02:55:46.930]  Hey, briefly, briefly.
[02:55:46.930 --> 02:55:48.851]  I want to put in a few calls here.
[02:55:48.851 --> 02:55:51.252]  I heard you're speaking out in
[02:55:52.512 --> 02:55:54.833]  The Central California area coming up.
[02:55:54.833 --> 02:55:59.454]  It's still working on that, but it should be, hopefully it'll be sometime end of October, beginning of November.
[02:55:59.454 --> 02:56:15.898]  Okay, well I want to plug some of those events you've got coming up, because I've heard a lot of talk and seen a lot of bull, but I'm just glad that Ted Anderson got me in contact with you, I don't know, six, eight months ago and everybody else, because I study things for a while, but then you look into them and I know you guys are getting results, and so I'm about to
[02:56:16.741 --> 02:56:23.086]  Really try to wade into this up to my eyeballs and certainly get the great response that others around me are.
[02:56:23.086 --> 02:56:24.768]  Infowarsteam.com.
[02:56:24.768 --> 02:56:25.568]  I'm talking the talk.
[02:56:25.568 --> 02:56:27.050]  It's time to walk the walk.
[02:56:27.050 --> 02:56:29.552]  Stuck my toe in and my leg in and I'm liking it.
[02:56:29.552 --> 02:56:30.292]  The water's good.
[02:56:30.292 --> 02:56:31.914]  I'm going all the way in.
[02:56:31.914 --> 02:56:33.755]  Tim in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:56:33.755 --> 02:56:34.356]  Thanks for holding.
[02:56:38.766 --> 02:56:39.866]  Hey, your phone's bad, bro.
[02:56:39.866 --> 02:56:41.067]  I gotta let you go.
[02:56:41.067 --> 02:56:41.487]  I'm sorry.
[02:56:41.487 --> 02:56:44.148]  It's just too distorted.
[02:56:44.148 --> 02:56:44.989]  We don't screen calls.
[02:56:44.989 --> 02:56:46.049]  You just got in a few days ago.
[02:56:46.049 --> 02:56:48.230]  You're a great guy, but the phone is too distorted.
[02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:49.570]  I'm sorry.
[02:56:49.570 --> 02:56:52.171]  CJ, you're on the air from Michigan.
[02:56:52.171 --> 02:56:52.552]  Go ahead.
[02:56:52.552 --> 02:56:54.332]  Hey, Alex.
[02:56:54.332 --> 02:56:54.772]  Thanks.
[02:56:54.772 --> 02:57:01.035]  Yeah, I want to weigh in on what looks like they're cooking up the next false flagger, Jared Tagg.
[02:57:01.727 --> 02:57:06.391]  Alright, obviously they got Bin Laden just before the 10th anniversary.
[02:57:06.391 --> 02:57:10.134]  Can't have the boogeyman out at large for 10 years.
[02:57:10.134 --> 02:57:16.559]  They're, uh, they're shifting from the Muslim extremists to the white, you know, patriots.
[02:57:16.559 --> 02:57:31.091]  So, now, they want to implode the economy even more, so look for, you know, right after Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Mall of America, they've already beta tested the Norway thing, you know,
[02:57:31.539 --> 02:57:40.786]  They're going to do something that will implode the economy more, plus you throw in the Second Amendment, so... No, I agree with you.
[02:57:40.786 --> 02:57:41.347]  I agree with you.
[02:57:41.347 --> 02:57:43.648]  They've been beta testing and have told cops it is coming.
[02:57:43.648 --> 02:57:45.530]  I mean, how ridiculous?
[02:57:45.530 --> 02:57:54.437]  Shopping malls will be attacked and schools everywhere, and we're going to take the Second Amendment when it happens, and the cops are like, too bad we've got to take the guns, but the right wingers are about to hit.
[02:57:55.274 --> 02:57:57.416]  And then they can declare war on the American people.
[02:57:57.416 --> 02:57:59.038]  I totally agree with you.
[02:57:59.038 --> 02:58:02.321]  That's why they're so angry that we're exposing what they're doing.
[02:58:10.643 --> 02:58:14.826]  At the, you know, the heart of the shopping season and all this stuff.
[02:58:14.826 --> 02:58:16.106]  I mean, it's over.
[02:58:16.106 --> 02:58:19.268]  Well, and then, oh, the TSA will be there.
[02:58:19.268 --> 02:58:22.930]  They've already run the promos that they're going to be at the shopping malls.
[02:58:22.930 --> 02:58:25.532]  And sorry, got to stick my hand in your pants.
[02:58:25.532 --> 02:58:27.293]  Again, just random checkpoints everywhere.
[02:58:27.293 --> 02:58:30.315]  We saw Beta tested that all over the country on 9-11.
[02:58:30.315 --> 02:58:31.556]  Great points.
[02:58:31.556 --> 02:58:34.998]  The official global radio transmission is now over.
[02:58:34.998 --> 02:58:36.178]  I'll be back tonight.
[02:58:37.299 --> 02:58:42.869]  Seven o'clock, PrisonPlanet.tv, but I'm doing Overdriver in a moment.
[02:58:42.869 --> 02:58:46.295]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.295 --> 02:58:48.498]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.408 --> 02:58:52.589]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:58:52.589 --> 02:58:59.515]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:58:59.515 --> 02:59:02.057]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:59:02.057 --> 02:59:07.441]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:59:07.441 --> 02:59:10.483]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:59:10.483 --> 02:59:12.565]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:59:12.805 --> 02:59:19.049]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:59:19.049 --> 02:59:22.431]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:59:22.431 --> 02:59:28.214]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:59:28.214 --> 02:59:29.855]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:59:29.855 --> 02:59:31.156]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:59:31.156 --> 02:59:33.818]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:59:33.818 --> 02:59:38.060]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:59:38.060 --> 02:59:40.082]  You can find the video at www.
[02:59:40.842 --> 02:59:42.663]  End of America 3.com.
[02:59:42.663 --> 02:59:45.245]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:59:45.245 --> 02:59:49.107]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:59:49.107 --> 02:59:52.249]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:59:52.249 --> 02:59:53.770]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.770 --> 02:59:55.831]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.831 --> 02:59:59.053]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:16.988 --> 03:00:27.154]  They're now announcing that pre-crime face scanners are to be used for security at shopping malls, other high security locations, soft targets.
[03:00:27.154 --> 03:00:32.617]  And they admit that it's, quote, two-thirds of the time accurate, which means never accurate.
[03:00:32.617 --> 03:00:36.380]  They aim a machine at your face, and it's supposedly off the faces you make.
[03:00:37.853 --> 03:00:39.514]  Shows them you're a terrorist.
[03:00:39.514 --> 03:00:45.778]  Now they have behavior police out at the airports and all the time they're like pulling over somebody and they're like, why do you look upset?
[03:00:45.778 --> 03:00:53.603]  Well, I've got gallbladder stones or I've got a toothache, man.
[03:00:53.603 --> 03:00:57.005]  I'm late, I just hauled my bags in here.
[03:00:57.864 --> 03:01:09.300]  And they'll go, oh, that's it, you're not flying, it's this new thing where, and it's total quackery, they sent hundreds of thousands of people to prison, conservatively, with fake lie detector tests.
[03:01:09.300 --> 03:01:14.387]  And now they've just moved on to a video camera they aim at you and it supposedly tells if you're lying or not.
[03:01:16.397 --> 03:01:21.361]  I've had people email me before and say, when you're talking sometimes, you look over to the right.
[03:01:21.361 --> 03:01:26.206]  And I guess sometimes, statistically, somebody could be lying if they're kind of, well, I don't know.
[03:01:26.206 --> 03:01:27.247]  Hey, did you get in the cookies yard?
[03:01:27.247 --> 03:01:29.228]  You know, my kids, uh, no, daddy.
[03:01:29.228 --> 03:01:30.109]  Uh, no, no.
[03:01:30.109 --> 03:01:32.451]  Sometimes I'm looking, well, do I have time?
[03:01:32.451 --> 03:01:33.152]  How long do I have?
[03:01:33.152 --> 03:01:34.433]  I'm looking at my clock.
[03:01:34.433 --> 03:01:35.434]  I'm looking at a television.
[03:01:37.796 --> 03:01:38.736]  So that's what I mean.
[03:01:38.736 --> 03:01:42.077]  The cops are like, oh, you just looked to the side when you said that.
[03:01:42.077 --> 03:01:44.698]  Oh, sometimes I'm looking down for a news article.
[03:01:44.698 --> 03:01:46.058]  Oh, proof.
[03:01:46.058 --> 03:01:48.159]  The computer says you're a terrorist.
[03:01:48.159 --> 03:01:49.059]  Total quackery.
[03:01:49.059 --> 03:02:00.523]  In closing with Ben Fuchs, it's coming out, he's being grilled in all the debates by the mainline Republican candidates, Bachman and others, about him with forced inoculations.
[03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:04.623]  And the Gardasil, it's coming out that Gardasil does kill people.
[03:02:04.623 --> 03:02:06.704]  It's turning out that it is contaminated.
[03:02:06.704 --> 03:02:08.025]  Well, of course it is.
[03:02:08.025 --> 03:02:09.927]  What is your view on that being a victory?
[03:02:09.927 --> 03:02:11.548]  I mean, do you agree that's a victory?
[03:02:11.548 --> 03:02:16.733]  That it's becoming so mainstream, pharmacist Ben Fuchs, that more and more people aren't taking vaccines?
[03:02:17.518 --> 03:02:20.380]  It's like we were talking about with the shingles, Alex.
[03:02:20.380 --> 03:02:25.984]  Gardasil, the human papillomavirus, the HPV virus attacks a weak immune system.
[03:02:25.984 --> 03:02:37.211]  If you're eating the standard American diet, if you're driving through the fast food, if you're eating a lot of sugar, if you're drinking the Slurpees and the Coke, your immune system is going to be compromised and you are going to be more prone towards viral infections.
[03:02:37.211 --> 03:02:40.033]  People, get on a nutritional supplement program.
[03:02:40.033 --> 03:02:42.175]  I cannot emphasize that enough.
[03:02:42.175 --> 03:02:44.616]  Disengage from the fast food and the processed food.
[03:02:44.616 --> 03:02:46.217]  Get to InfoWarsTeam.com.
[03:02:46.217 --> 03:02:47.178]  Get on the Alex Pack.
[03:02:47.758 --> 03:02:52.942]  There are so many wonderful options for building our health so we don't have to worry about the drugs.
[03:02:52.942 --> 03:02:54.823]  We don't have to worry about the vaccines.
[03:02:54.823 --> 03:03:01.568]  You can tell them to stick it with the human papillomavirus inoculation, the Gardasil inoculation.
[03:03:01.568 --> 03:03:03.009]  Tell them to take it themselves.
[03:03:03.009 --> 03:03:03.630]  You don't need it.
[03:03:03.630 --> 03:03:08.773]  Well, the crazy part is I've read the insert back during the trials after it came out and it says
[03:03:09.634 --> 03:03:12.056]  This doesn't protect you from papillomavirus.
[03:03:12.056 --> 03:03:13.477]  It's not been proven.
[03:03:13.477 --> 03:03:16.039]  It's thought it might help with a few strains.
[03:03:16.039 --> 03:03:19.882]  Then you learn there's thousands of strains, 300 plus they think can kill you.
[03:03:19.882 --> 03:03:21.924]  It's one of the rarest forms of cancer.
[03:03:21.924 --> 03:03:27.168]  They admit it's normally autoimmune suppressed people who can get the form of cervical cancer.
[03:03:30.137 --> 03:03:36.719]  They admit it causes all sorts of immune problems, and now I was reading 15 million American girls have taken it.
[03:03:36.719 --> 03:03:39.420]  And it is just absolutely linked.
[03:03:39.420 --> 03:03:46.042]  All these vaccines are screwing up your immune system, where your white blood cells can't recognize cancer in the future.
[03:03:46.042 --> 03:03:50.564]  And then there's a new electron microscope video out today the Daily Mail has.
[03:03:50.564 --> 03:03:51.724]  I meant to play it.
[03:03:51.724 --> 03:03:53.285]  Perhaps tonight I'll cover it on the nightly news.
[03:03:54.733 --> 03:03:57.895]  And it shows white blood cells eating new cancers.
[03:03:57.895 --> 03:04:20.186]  Well, what the scientists have told me, and I want you to briefly comment on this, is that under electron microscopes, when you've taken vaccines over and over again, you lose your immunity, your body stops fighting, and that's what the HPV or the flu shot showed two years ago in a Canadian government study, that when you took the H1N1 shot, it lessened your immune response to regular flu by 50%.
[03:04:21.715 --> 03:04:24.177]  You want to up-regulate your body's immune system.
[03:04:24.177 --> 03:04:26.178]  You never want to do something that's going to down-regulate it.
[03:04:26.178 --> 03:04:30.941]  Do you know, Alex, that people faint after they get the Gardasil injection?
[03:04:30.941 --> 03:04:35.464]  Dizziness, vomiting, nausea, headache, fever, pain, swelling.
[03:04:35.464 --> 03:04:36.384]  These are all side effects.
[03:04:36.384 --> 03:04:40.067]  These are all normal side effects of the Gardasil injection.
[03:04:40.307 --> 03:04:47.815]  I want to have you back up on the news soon via video Skype, if you can do it, to really break down Gardasil and the side effects.
[03:04:47.815 --> 03:04:51.159]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, InfoWarsTeam.com.
