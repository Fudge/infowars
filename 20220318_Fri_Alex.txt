[00:00.000 --> 00:29.120]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:29.120 --> 00:35.720]  The question for Mr. Austin, at the Ukrainian President Zelensky called again and again
[00:35.720 --> 00:40.400]  for an off-lie zone over Ukraine at the level of NATO.
[00:40.400 --> 00:47.240]  There were discussions about that at the NATO level, and if yes, what was the conclusion?
[00:47.240 --> 00:55.160]  Well, from a U.S. perspective, our President, President Biden, has been clear that we would
[00:55.160 --> 01:01.760]  not have U.S. forces fighting in Ukraine.
[01:01.760 --> 01:06.600]  Having said that, we'll do everything within our power to support Ukraine and their efforts
[01:06.600 --> 01:08.600]  to defend their territory.
[01:08.600 --> 01:17.760]  We've also stated that enforcing a no-fly zone actually means that you're in combat,
[01:17.760 --> 01:21.720]  you're in a fight with Russia.
[01:21.720 --> 01:27.200]  And that's one of the things that we have said that our President has said that we weren't
[01:27.200 --> 01:30.440]  going to do, getting in a fight with Russia.
[01:30.440 --> 01:34.440]  So what this really means is that in order to control the skies, you have to shut down
[01:34.440 --> 01:41.880]  the air defenses that are on the ground, and some of those air defense systems are in Russia.
[01:41.880 --> 01:47.960]  And so, again, there's no easy or simple way to do this.
[01:47.960 --> 01:50.920]  There's no such thing as a no-fly zone light.
[01:50.920 --> 01:55.760]  A no-fly zone means that you're in a conflict with Russia.
[01:55.760 --> 02:01.120]  So from a U.S. perspective, again, our position remains that we're not going to do that.
[02:01.120 --> 02:10.960]  Now you have Ireland and Great Britain and, you know, the Republic standing together against
[02:10.960 --> 02:17.360]  a murderous dictator, a pure thug who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.
[02:17.360 --> 02:21.400]  I just want to know what you suggest, because back then, when I was in your position, I
[02:21.400 --> 02:24.400]  was suggesting we bomb Belgrade.
[02:24.400 --> 02:31.080]  I was suggesting that we send American pilots in and blow up all the bridges on the Drina.
[02:31.080 --> 02:33.840]  I was suggesting we take out as oil supplies.
[02:33.840 --> 02:36.440]  I was suggesting very specific action.
[02:36.440 --> 02:38.800]  And it is interesting that we do.
[02:38.800 --> 02:40.320]  SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
[02:40.320 --> 02:48.280]  I think no radders declare DEF CON 3, scramble all alert aircraft, I repeat, scramble all
[02:48.280 --> 02:49.280]  alert aircraft.
[02:49.280 --> 02:52.640]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War II.
[02:52.640 --> 02:53.960]  Target selection complete.
[02:53.960 --> 02:56.080]  Time on target sequence complete.
[02:56.080 --> 03:04.240]  22 Typhoon class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning south out of Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[03:04.240 --> 03:08.840]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaska near Defensa.
[03:08.840 --> 03:12.760]  From the front lines of the information war.
[03:12.760 --> 03:18.960]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode, we are at DEF CON 1.
[03:18.960 --> 03:21.400]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[03:21.400 --> 03:22.400]  You bet!
[03:22.400 --> 03:26.760]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:26.760 --> 03:30.280]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[03:30.280 --> 03:35.080]  Three, two, one, impact.
[03:35.080 --> 03:37.200]  Shall we play a game?
[03:37.200 --> 03:43.120]  How about global thermal nuclear war?
[03:43.120 --> 03:47.920]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47.920 --> 03:51.800]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready awaiting launch codes.
[03:51.800 --> 03:53.480]  We are in a launch mode.
[03:53.480 --> 03:57.360]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[04:01.760 --> 04:02.760]  We're in.
[04:02.760 --> 04:04.760]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[04:04.760 --> 04:07.440]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[04:07.440 --> 04:09.440]  I wish I didn't know all about any of this.
[04:09.440 --> 04:11.440]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[04:11.440 --> 04:27.440]  Things can't be only when it is not to play.
[04:27.440 --> 04:31.280]  Biological attack is imminent, imminent.
[04:31.280 --> 04:32.280]  It's going to happen.
[04:32.280 --> 04:36.040]  It's not a question of when it happens, but when it happens.
[04:36.040 --> 04:40.800]  A bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to
[04:40.800 --> 04:45.720]  counter a global problem, and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing
[04:45.720 --> 04:47.760]  that may save their world government.
[04:47.760 --> 05:00.680]  This is a biological warfare agent that had the out of the Wuhan laboratory.
[05:00.680 --> 05:03.440]  It's been noted by many a historian.
[05:03.440 --> 05:10.240]  The first casualty of war is the truth, and the next big casualty isn't even the people
[05:10.240 --> 05:11.240]  that die.
[05:11.240 --> 05:19.000]  No, that invariably follows, but first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.120]  and speech and massive censorship.
[05:22.120 --> 05:27.760]  And now across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[05:27.760 --> 05:36.240]  that if you amplify any, quote, pro-Russian information, you can be censored.
[05:36.240 --> 05:37.640]  You can be arrested.
[05:37.640 --> 05:38.640]  You can be imprisoned.
[05:38.640 --> 05:44.560]  And of course now Canada is under this legislation that if you have a thought crime and they
[05:44.560 --> 05:50.440]  think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored
[05:50.440 --> 05:51.440]  and arrested.
[05:51.440 --> 05:55.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around
[05:55.720 --> 06:02.720]  the world against humanity that makes them fullers.com more important than ever.
[06:25.720 --> 06:46.320]  The
[06:46.320 --> 06:52.480]  first nation to successfully weaponize and mass produce deadly pathogens was Great Britain
[06:52.480 --> 06:55.240]  during the start of World War II.
[06:55.240 --> 07:00.920]  Britain followed by the United States, Germany, France, and Japan.
[07:00.920 --> 07:07.800]  While many nations mass produced them, Japan was notorious for deploying biological weapons,
[07:07.800 --> 07:14.480]  killing almost a half a million Chinese soldiers and civilians in several military campaigns,
[07:14.480 --> 07:21.760]  including the 1940 bombing of Ningbo, China, when Japan's secret bio weapons unit 731
[07:21.760 --> 07:28.280]  dropped ceramic bombs full of living fleas carrying the bubonic plague.
[07:28.280 --> 07:34.480]  German pharmaceutical company IG Farben Bayer conducted fatal human experiments on prisoners
[07:34.480 --> 07:40.880]  and killed over a million people with its cyanide-based Zyclon B.
[07:40.880 --> 07:47.640]  The U.S. established their own bio weapons program at Fort Dietrich, Maryland in 1942.
[07:47.640 --> 07:53.360]  And by the end of the war, brand new facilities were completed for mass production of anthrax
[07:53.360 --> 07:55.560]  and other bio weapons.
[07:55.560 --> 08:00.440]  After the war, the directors of IG Farben were punished at the Nuremberg trials, but
[08:00.440 --> 08:06.840]  the scientists were secretly absorbed into America's bio weapons program.
[08:06.840 --> 08:12.480]  Japan was planning to attack the city of San Diego, California with weaponized plague,
[08:12.480 --> 08:16.360]  but they surrendered three weeks prior to the scheduled attack.
[08:16.360 --> 08:22.520]  And while Japanese researchers arrested by Soviet forces were tried for war crimes, those
[08:22.520 --> 08:28.080]  captured by the United States were secretly given immunity in exchange for working with
[08:28.080 --> 08:31.400]  the U.S. bio weapons team.
[08:31.400 --> 08:37.960]  Long after World War II, the U.S. bio weapons program continued to expand with the help
[08:37.960 --> 08:41.160]  of Japanese and German war criminals.
[08:41.160 --> 08:47.600]  And in 1969, the U.S. government officially terminated their offensive biological weapons
[08:47.600 --> 08:54.200]  program, continuing on with a defensive biological weapons program, which was nothing more than
[08:54.200 --> 09:00.200]  a change of language ahead of the biological weapons convention in 1972.
[09:00.200 --> 09:05.920]  The U.S. would continue to experiment with and produce deadly pathogens, but now under
[09:05.920 --> 09:12.160]  the guise of defense and mostly defense against Russia.
[09:12.160 --> 09:18.240]  Of all the nations involved in bio weapons research, Russia factors in very little.
[09:18.240 --> 09:23.120]  The U.S. government claims that the Soviet Union had the biggest bio weapons program
[09:23.120 --> 09:30.640]  in history, but this is based solely on a mysterious 1979 anthrax leak and the lone testimony
[09:30.640 --> 09:37.120]  of Soviet defector Ken Alebeck, who has also been absorbed into the U.S. bio weapons program
[09:37.120 --> 09:43.800]  and who has helped the U.S. surround Russia with dangerous bio weapons labs.
[09:43.800 --> 09:48.200]  Russia is now releasing confiscated documents of the work that was being conducted in the
[09:48.200 --> 09:52.160]  NATO backed bio labs they have secured in Ukraine.
[09:52.160 --> 09:58.360]  These labs were allegedly developing genetically engineered bio weapons to target specific
[09:58.360 --> 10:05.440]  Slavic people and experimenting with ways of spreading pathogens via bats, ticks, lice,
[10:05.440 --> 10:11.920]  and fleas, like the work Japan's Unit 731 was doing before being secretly brought into
[10:11.920 --> 10:12.920]  the U.S.
[10:12.920 --> 10:19.080]  Meanwhile, Bill Gates is currently allowed to release hundreds of millions of genetically
[10:19.080 --> 10:26.480]  modified mosquitoes within the United States as some sort of disease control experiment.
[10:26.480 --> 10:31.160]  You can say what you want about Vladimir Putin and Russia, but they aren't the ones waging
[10:31.160 --> 10:34.040]  war against the people of the West.
[10:34.040 --> 10:39.520]  That would be the World Economic Forum, the big banks, and their lackeys of the Great Reset
[10:39.520 --> 10:41.280]  Agenda.
[10:41.280 --> 10:47.200]  After the U.S. government sanctioned all the Russian people, Putin responded by only targeting
[10:47.200 --> 10:53.640]  a few known criminals of the Great Reset Cabal, as if sending a message to the Americans that
[10:53.640 --> 10:56.520]  we share the same enemies.
[10:56.520 --> 11:03.560]  Whereas the global elites are working towards destroying the nation states, Russia is reinventing
[11:03.560 --> 11:05.520]  the nation state.
[11:05.520 --> 11:11.840]  Russia hopes to be the world's biggest producer of organic farming, while the globalists are
[11:11.840 --> 11:17.800]  pushing for genetically modified foods, bugs, and synthetic meat.
[11:17.800 --> 11:23.400]  The globalists are actively destroying the family down to the mother's womb.
[11:23.400 --> 11:29.400]  While Russia seeks to build a society based on family and Christian values, the Russian
[11:29.400 --> 11:35.200]  government provides fallout shelters for the civilian population to potentially survive
[11:35.200 --> 11:41.720]  a nuclear war, and the U.S. government has absolutely nothing for the people.
[11:41.720 --> 11:48.360]  We are on our own, but FEMA reminds us to remain socially distanced, while our government
[11:48.360 --> 11:53.360]  robs us blind and starts a nuclear war.
[11:53.360 --> 12:22.640]  Waiting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[12:23.680 --> 12:27.600]  Well, he trended number one on the Internet yesterday with tens of millions of views on
[12:27.600 --> 12:28.600]  Twitter alone.
[12:28.600 --> 12:34.440]  It's got to be 50 million views, just from the links I saw on Instagram and YouTube.
[12:34.440 --> 12:37.520]  It's flooding the zone, as they say.
[12:37.520 --> 12:43.480]  Alex Stein is a Texas-based comedian, and he likes to go rap at city councils.
[12:43.480 --> 12:46.160]  And I don't think this is even his best one.
[12:46.160 --> 12:47.160]  It's excellent, by the way.
[12:47.160 --> 12:48.160]  It's hilarious.
[12:48.160 --> 12:52.600]  A little bit of mic problems, but his last one, I think, was the best.
[12:52.600 --> 12:54.560]  He's joining us.
[12:54.560 --> 12:55.560]  He's a big friend of the show.
[12:55.560 --> 12:56.840]  He's never been on my show.
[12:56.840 --> 12:57.840]  I play clips of him.
[12:57.840 --> 12:58.840]  He's been on Owens.
[12:58.840 --> 13:03.080]  And, of course, he's been on the American Journal.
[13:03.080 --> 13:05.040]  And so Alex Stein's going to be joining us next segment.
[13:05.040 --> 13:09.840]  We have a little bit of fun here during the absurdity, because, folks, I'm not even playing
[13:09.840 --> 13:12.400]  these clips of Biden and Pelosi.
[13:12.400 --> 13:18.000]  I mean, I guess I might play some, but talk about flooding the zone.
[13:18.000 --> 13:25.040]  Every day, there's like two, three minute long times when nothing Pelosi says makes
[13:25.040 --> 13:26.040]  sense.
[13:26.040 --> 13:31.040]  And anyone that's been around somebody with full-on Alzheimer's who's 90 years old,
[13:31.040 --> 13:36.680]  my grandmother, the week she died at 92, here in Austin a few years ago, was talking
[13:36.680 --> 13:37.680]  like that.
[13:37.680 --> 13:40.400]  But, I mean, she died a couple days later.
[13:40.400 --> 13:43.400]  We were like, oh, gosh, Grandma's going to die.
[13:43.400 --> 13:47.560]  She doesn't know who she is, and it's gibbering, and that's what it's like.
[13:47.560 --> 13:56.120]  And instead, this is a person clearly with serious dementia on TV, and Biden's almost
[13:56.120 --> 13:57.120]  as bad.
[13:57.120 --> 14:03.800]  I mean, we're a cursed country, folks, and we have a psychotic Bill Gates who, in not
[14:03.800 --> 14:10.080]  just Florida and California, he tested them in Texas, these GMO mosquitoes that they released
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.640]  in South America that caused a bunch of mutations and are linked to actually creating Zika.
[14:15.640 --> 14:20.080]  And Gates separately says he's going to create vaccines that are delivered through food you
[14:20.080 --> 14:22.840]  eat, through the air, and, of course, through mosquitoes.
[14:22.840 --> 14:26.800]  So we're all being biologically and chemically tested on.
[14:26.800 --> 14:28.440]  We're being tested on with nanotech.
[14:28.440 --> 14:30.160]  What do you think COVID-19 is?
[14:30.160 --> 14:31.680]  What do you think the spike protein is?
[14:31.680 --> 14:33.000]  And it's just outrageous.
[14:33.000 --> 14:34.000]  We're being assaulted.
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.600]  So when that criminal group is telling us the Russians are bad and the Russians are
[14:37.600 --> 14:41.400]  evil and the Russians have to be destroyed, you've got to take it with a grain of salt.
[14:41.400 --> 14:45.040]  Doesn't mean you think the Russians are perfect or agree with them invading their neighbor.
[14:45.040 --> 14:49.600]  It just means you're like, OK, but the criminals want to start a larger war, and they were
[14:49.600 --> 14:54.400]  running biolabs there, and then lying doesn't say they aren't, even though it's in thousands
[14:54.400 --> 14:58.960]  of news articles previously, the U.S. government bragging about the labs, maybe like saying
[14:58.960 --> 15:00.560]  the Dallas Cowboys never existed.
[15:00.560 --> 15:05.360]  You're like, well, I've got thousands of articles that they've existed since the 1940s
[15:05.360 --> 15:12.000]  or 50s or whatever they got started, and Roger Stalback and all those people, and I went
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.440]  and saw Dallas Cowboys games, and they're like, nope, they never existed.
[15:16.440 --> 15:20.600]  Yeah, they got baby blue and silver uniforms with a navy blue star.
[15:20.600 --> 15:21.600]  No, they don't.
[15:21.600 --> 15:23.680]  Yeah, Tom Landry was their founding coach.
[15:23.680 --> 15:24.680]  No.
[15:24.680 --> 15:27.640]  Well, my grandfather was almost best friends with them, probably best friends.
[15:27.640 --> 15:31.080]  They prayed multiple times a week and went to college together with the Army Air Corps.
[15:31.080 --> 15:33.560]  Nope, Tom Landry didn't exist either.
[15:33.560 --> 15:34.560]  No one exists.
[15:34.560 --> 15:35.560]  Nothing exists.
[15:35.560 --> 15:36.560]  We tell you.
[15:36.560 --> 15:37.560]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[15:37.560 --> 15:38.560]  It's freaking crazy town.
[15:38.560 --> 15:43.840]  And men can be women and women can be men and pedophilias all over the news is a good
[15:43.840 --> 15:44.840]  thing now.
[15:44.840 --> 15:50.760]  I mean, these people are out of control and we are letting them do this.
[15:50.760 --> 15:51.760]  Or did we really?
[15:51.760 --> 15:53.600]  No, they stole that election.
[15:53.600 --> 15:54.600]  Obviously they did.
[15:54.600 --> 15:55.600]  We have all the evidence.
[15:55.600 --> 15:56.600]  Big show today.
[15:56.600 --> 15:57.600]  Stay with us.
[15:57.600 --> 16:06.520]  Taking advantage of one of nature's most nutrient dense ingredients, Vaso Beats will be your
[16:06.520 --> 16:11.240]  new favorite infowars life formula.
[16:11.240 --> 16:16.000]  Using only water and beetroot, Vaso Beats is the most concentrated liquid extracts
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.600]  of meat on the market.
[16:18.600 --> 16:25.960]  With concentrated beet extract, you can get the high levels of betaine, nitrates and antioxidants
[16:25.960 --> 16:32.560]  you want to help support a healthy liver, athletic performance, blood vessels and more.
[16:32.560 --> 16:36.840]  Don't overlook the power of beetroot.
[16:36.840 --> 16:44.000]  Get your naturally occurring potassium, folate, vitamin C, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin K

[20:01.040 --> 20:27.320]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:27.320 --> 20:29.800]  These are not edited tapes.
[20:29.800 --> 20:32.000]  These are real things that happen.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.600]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:34.600 --> 20:46.080]  Pelosi, Biden and many other members of Congress can hardly even form a Senate and make absolutely
[20:46.080 --> 20:51.160]  no sense and then contradict themselves within the same speeches.
[20:51.160 --> 20:58.760]  It would be embarrassing if these people were the spokesperson for a funeral home, though
[20:58.760 --> 21:02.640]  they'd be emblematic of death and decay and collapse.
[21:02.640 --> 21:07.320]  It would be embarrassing if they were a spokesperson at the Rotary Club.
[21:07.320 --> 21:11.640]  It would be embarrassing if they were the principal of a school and were having to give
[21:11.640 --> 21:16.540]  a commencement speech or talk about the commencements that were happening and unable to speak.
[21:16.540 --> 21:22.440]  But no, they are in control of the most powerful country, the most powerful monetary and most
[21:22.440 --> 21:28.880]  powerful weapon system in the world.
[21:28.880 --> 21:34.720]  And they are actively declaring their political opposition to be terrorist.
[21:34.720 --> 21:48.160]  They are actively destroying and demolishing every single bedrock system that made us great
[21:48.160 --> 21:59.360]  and made us successful and made us secure and made us free and empowered and, of course,
[21:59.360 --> 22:00.360]  safe.
[22:00.360 --> 22:05.200]  I mean, I probably, without even trying to look for these, see about 10 of these a day
[22:05.200 --> 22:07.880]  and it's Jared Nadler and just all of them.
[22:07.880 --> 22:12.040]  I mean, it is a freak show.
[22:12.040 --> 22:17.080]  And what's even scarier is they're in that D.C. bubble and these people get driven around
[22:17.080 --> 22:19.920]  in limos and SUVs, private jets.
[22:19.920 --> 22:24.080]  Their butts get wiped literally in some cases.
[22:24.080 --> 22:30.560]  As Biden said, my butt's been wiped, my butt's been wiped because he will get mad and take
[22:30.560 --> 22:31.560]  a dump in his pants.
[22:31.560 --> 22:34.800]  I've talked to the Secret Service and others that confirmed it.
[22:34.800 --> 22:35.800]  It's not made up.
[22:35.800 --> 22:41.680]  They had to carry multiple changes of clothes for him because he is incontinent.
[22:41.680 --> 22:45.680]  And that happens.
[22:45.680 --> 22:47.000]  We're not putting him down for that.
[22:47.000 --> 22:56.120]  It's his crimes that matter, but we have a president that shits all over himself.
[22:56.120 --> 23:04.160]  So here's Pelosi, who really should be auditioning for the Crip Keeper, no makeup needed.
[23:04.160 --> 23:08.160]  And here she is, not a word of what she says makes any sense.
[23:08.160 --> 23:15.680]  I watched this twice last night, laying in bed on an iPad, and I could not make out what
[23:15.680 --> 23:18.120]  in the world she was talking about.
[23:18.120 --> 23:21.880]  In fact, some of the words she was saying, I looked them up, they don't exist.
[23:21.880 --> 23:23.880]  Because I like words.
[23:23.880 --> 23:24.880]  I hear words all the time.
[23:24.880 --> 23:25.880]  I don't know.
[23:25.880 --> 23:26.880]  I go look them up.
[23:26.880 --> 23:27.880]  Kind of a word Smith guy.
[23:27.880 --> 23:28.880]  I really like them.
[23:28.880 --> 23:29.880]  I think you like them too.
[23:29.880 --> 23:31.200]  We all like them.
[23:31.200 --> 23:33.080]  But I'm like, what was that a word?
[23:33.080 --> 23:35.400]  Did I back it up and write it down and go look it up?
[23:35.400 --> 23:37.800]  No, they're not a word.
[23:37.800 --> 23:39.400]  He's now inventing words.
[23:39.400 --> 23:41.440]  They don't just not make sense.
[23:41.440 --> 23:43.440]  They're not just jumbled.
[23:43.440 --> 23:44.760]  They're not just incoherent.
[23:44.760 --> 23:46.280]  They're not even real words.
[23:46.280 --> 23:47.960]  Here it is for yourself.
[23:47.960 --> 23:52.120]  But they know that we can't go there.
[23:52.120 --> 23:59.800]  Putin is trying to bake the trap so that we go in, and that could be the beginning of
[23:59.800 --> 24:01.400]  World War III.
[24:01.400 --> 24:07.680]  Putin told the irresponsible using weapons that are not allowed under the Geneva Convention.
[24:07.680 --> 24:13.720]  Putin who threatens use of chemical weapons, nuclear and the rest.
[24:13.720 --> 24:15.320]  So they know that we can't.
[24:15.320 --> 24:16.320]  But it's the ask.
[24:16.320 --> 24:26.520]  Now, he was this morning more, if we can't have a no fly zone, let us have our own.
[24:26.520 --> 24:28.480]  And we need the airplanes to come in.
[24:28.480 --> 24:31.480]  Was he going to test out in the middle of the night?
[24:31.480 --> 24:33.080]  No, no, no, no.
[24:33.080 --> 24:43.680]  This morning he was less on the ask for the policy, more on let us do it, help us get
[24:43.680 --> 24:44.680]  the planes.
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.840]  But also, there is a school of thought that thinks the anti-aircraft missiles and the
[24:49.840 --> 24:52.280]  rest are a very important way.
[24:52.280 --> 25:00.480]  Myself, when I see those tanks at 40 miles of tanks, I'd like to take out those tanks.
[25:00.480 --> 25:10.400]  I mean, I think that them having more planes might be useful, but I'm not a military strategist.
[25:10.400 --> 25:12.960]  We hope that we will be able to get to a place.
[25:12.960 --> 25:13.960]  I hope.
[25:13.960 --> 25:19.280]  You asked me how I hope that we can get to a place where the MiGs, which are the kinds
[25:19.280 --> 25:27.040]  of planes they've been trained on, can go to Ukraine at 16, especially if we have an
[25:27.040 --> 25:30.680]  excess of them, can backfill for Poland.
[25:30.680 --> 25:32.360]  Okay, and the crew is great.
[25:32.360 --> 25:34.280]  I didn't want to view all these clips beforehand.
[25:34.280 --> 25:36.320]  I sent a bunch yesterday and today.
[25:36.320 --> 25:37.920]  That's a little more coherent one, though.
[25:37.920 --> 25:42.160]  She's lying a bunch and calling for World War Three and how she wants to start a bigger
[25:42.160 --> 25:44.840]  war with the Russians and some babbling.
[25:44.840 --> 25:48.120]  There's one I've got to look at my phone that I sent last night, where she's talking about
[25:48.120 --> 25:52.320]  the Republicans and spending packages, and it just makes no sense.
[25:52.320 --> 25:54.920]  It's a complete gibbering jabble.
[25:54.920 --> 26:01.480]  So I'll find that, and we'll have that for you coming up, but seeing Biden say that Russia
[26:01.480 --> 26:08.120]  has attacked Russia, seeing Biden say that Iran attacked Ukraine, remember that?
[26:08.120 --> 26:11.480]  That was in the State of the Union, both of those.
[26:11.480 --> 26:17.440]  And it's just emblematic, and it's really frightening that these people are this out
[26:17.440 --> 26:19.560]  of their minds, but again, they're not really running things.
[26:19.560 --> 26:24.600]  There are powerful, corrupt bureaucracies behind them that are running things, but then these
[26:24.600 --> 26:29.480]  puppets will get the blame, and that's why the Klaus Schwab's and the Bill Gates's
[26:29.480 --> 26:34.880]  of the world, who have even more powerful people behind them, are able to get away with
[26:34.880 --> 26:35.880]  all of this.
[26:35.880 --> 26:41.240]  And we have so much news, biggest developments yet on the Russia situation, really what's
[26:41.240 --> 26:43.800]  going on, and what we think is going to unfold from that.
[26:43.800 --> 26:47.120]  We'll be getting to that after our special guest leaves us.
[26:47.120 --> 26:50.360]  We also have a bunch of breaking pedophile news.
[26:50.360 --> 26:56.280]  Disney employees, among 100-day arrested in Florida, human trafficking sting, and that
[26:56.280 --> 27:00.480]  ties into Oregon Top Children's Hospital, teaches young boys to tuck their genitals
[27:00.480 --> 27:06.600]  and directs kids to a toy shop at the porn shop, and teaches children as young as five
[27:06.600 --> 27:11.480]  years of age how to do some really horrible stuff.
[27:11.480 --> 27:16.000]  Polls, 66% of Democrats believe changing one's biological sex is possible.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.600]  They probably also believe in the tooth fairy.
[27:19.600 --> 27:24.320]  So that is all coming up here today as well.
[27:24.320 --> 27:29.560]  You can change someone's sex in utero with chemicals, but it doesn't create a classic
[27:29.560 --> 27:31.760]  male or female flip.
[27:31.760 --> 27:37.000]  It creates a mutant, and a lot of times creates a hermaphroditic individual who we do not
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.680]  hate and who is not bad.
[27:39.680 --> 27:45.240]  But this is a process of mutating men and women and creating mutants, and that's the
[27:45.240 --> 27:46.240]  New World Order plan.
[27:46.240 --> 27:50.360]  And then the young Turks make jokes and say, what's wrong with gay frogs?
[27:50.360 --> 27:51.360]  What's wrong if they're all gay?
[27:51.360 --> 27:54.200]  Well, they go extinct, dummy.
[27:54.200 --> 27:58.560]  And also the young Turks, it doesn't really matter, and I think I forgot to send this
[27:58.560 --> 28:01.280]  to the crew because I didn't see it on the list.
[28:01.280 --> 28:04.120]  But I think I'm going to play it because it's so incredible.
[28:04.120 --> 28:12.120]  They play an edited tape with like two and three second cuts with me saying, I support
[28:12.120 --> 28:14.320]  Russia invading and I support Putin.
[28:14.320 --> 28:17.280]  They'll probably take what I just said there and take that out of context.
[28:17.280 --> 28:22.280]  I mean, this is next level fraud.
[28:22.280 --> 28:25.480]  But I guess they say the first casualty of war is the truth.
[28:25.480 --> 28:26.920]  Everyone knows I'm against the war.
[28:26.920 --> 28:29.960]  I've shown the Ukrainian side, the Russian side.
[28:29.960 --> 28:34.000]  I pointed out what the great reset globalists like what's happening so we can get full spectrum
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  analysis.
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.480]  But to watch this edited tape they play and about a third of the folks on YouTube comments
[28:40.480 --> 28:41.480]  got it.
[28:41.480 --> 28:42.480]  And so this is edited.
[28:42.480 --> 28:44.200]  But the others are like, arrest him.
[28:44.200 --> 28:45.200]  He's a Russian agent.
[28:45.200 --> 28:49.320]  I mean, this is beyond the deep fake because you can see it's fake.
[28:49.320 --> 28:51.840]  You can see it's jump cuts and edited together.
[28:51.840 --> 28:55.400]  You know, like those magnet games with the refrigerator, you can take the words and make
[28:55.400 --> 29:00.200]  whatever you want, that's what they did.
[29:00.200 --> 29:07.640]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[29:07.640 --> 29:10.840]  until the populations rebelled.
[29:10.840 --> 29:16.360]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[29:16.360 --> 29:19.240]  anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[29:19.240 --> 29:24.800]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[29:24.800 --> 29:30.520]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[29:30.520 --> 29:34.800]  that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[29:34.800 --> 29:38.080]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[29:38.080 --> 29:42.480]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[29:42.480 --> 29:48.840]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[29:48.840 --> 29:51.200]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[29:51.200 --> 29:56.800]  So pray for these folks big time, it's a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowars.com
[29:56.800 --> 29:59.200]  because truth is absolutely paramount.
[29:59.200 --> 30:01.840]  So I did it.
[30:01.840 --> 30:04.000]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.680]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[30:08.680 --> 30:10.680]  and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[30:10.680 --> 30:16.880]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to
[30:16.880 --> 30:17.880]  get going.
[30:17.880 --> 30:23.240]  Besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep
[30:23.240 --> 30:28.400]  me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy giving
[30:28.400 --> 30:31.040]  me the best chance at getting through the training.
[30:31.040 --> 30:34.640]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' sore list.
[30:34.640 --> 30:36.960]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[30:36.960 --> 30:41.600]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation
[30:41.600 --> 30:44.000]  support and extra flexibility.
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.640]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[30:48.640 --> 30:53.320]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can
[30:53.320 --> 30:57.320]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep
[30:57.320 --> 30:59.760]  you moving and feeling great at any age.
[30:59.760 --> 31:05.040]  The first 10 amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[31:05.040 --> 31:10.000]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[31:10.000 --> 31:16.240]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference
[31:16.240 --> 31:18.920]  and restraint by the government.
[31:18.920 --> 31:25.440]  231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack.

[33:01.360 --> 33:21.160]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:21.160 --> 33:29.440]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[33:29.440 --> 33:33.040]  I tell you, this guy is amazing, he's been on with Owen Shroyer on the war room, he's
[33:33.040 --> 33:36.920]  been on American Journal, there is a Smith, we of course play clips of him here, but he's
[33:36.920 --> 33:41.680]  a fellow Texan and he's on air with us right now, he's got the number one video, tens of
[33:41.680 --> 33:48.000]  millions of views all over the internet, top story breaking yesterday, Alex Stein.
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.760]  He's our prime time guest, we really appreciate him coming on, he's on YouTube with Conspiracy
[33:53.760 --> 33:59.240]  Castle, he's also on Twitter at Alex Stein 99, Instagram at Alex Stein and of course
[33:59.240 --> 34:06.920]  he's got a band.video account, the Conspiracy Castle that is also extremely popular.
[34:06.920 --> 34:10.160]  Now I don't think this is his best rap, I think it's world class, it's broken the internet,
[34:10.160 --> 34:16.240]  it's super funny because the mic was overdriven, it's not a 100% out of the park Grand Slam
[34:16.240 --> 34:20.560]  like his previous rap that I think was the best I ever saw, but never fear, we're not
[34:20.560 --> 34:24.200]  having technical difficulties here today like they had in Plano, my old stomping grounds
[34:24.200 --> 34:26.560]  outside Dallas, I literally grew up right by there.
[34:26.560 --> 34:30.400]  You know ladies and gentlemen, we have him via Skype, he's going to be in studio with
[34:30.400 --> 34:37.080]  us Sunday and so he's going to do the same rap or more improv here for us in just a moment.
[34:37.080 --> 34:41.520]  But first, let's go to the incredible developments that have taken the internet by storm.
[34:41.520 --> 34:57.560]  I'm the proof when I'm in a boo, spitting on the mic, Santa Vox, Putin hates all of them
[34:57.560 --> 35:06.560]  blacks, Putin is a bad racist, put them in the ground, white or brown, and I'm in Plano
[35:06.560 --> 35:18.720]  and you know I'm brown and shine, one more time I'm teaching class, this is your whole
[35:18.720 --> 35:27.000]  pie, Zelensky is a VIP, Ukraine and I go insane, put a bullet in Putin's brain, you
[35:27.000 --> 35:36.120]  know that is the plan, I'm a Zelensky stan, I love you, Vladimir Zelensky, you are so smart,
[35:36.120 --> 35:42.280]  what's a smart, there's somebody fat, know what, what can you say, fascinate me straight
[35:42.280 --> 35:50.720]  or gay, I love you and I love you, wild and grind all the time, and you got that sanitizer
[35:50.720 --> 35:57.000]  and you know I got that Pfizer, you know I stick it in my bag, put a bullet in Putin's
[35:57.000 --> 36:05.800]  brain, go in for the Ukraine, before I go insane, let me anti-bacterial my body, at
[36:05.800 --> 36:16.080]  the party, you know the flow, and I am a pimp, cause I am on a blim, it lasts a steak and
[36:16.080 --> 36:23.880]  shrimp, one more time I'm 99, and you know I grind and shine, gas price is way too high,
[36:23.880 --> 36:31.720]  Vladimir Putin needs to die, gas price is way too high, Vladimir needs to die, I'm the
[36:31.720 --> 36:39.840]  pro and the boo, take my picture, I'm a winner, I'ma eat you for dinner, okay, I just wanna
[36:39.840 --> 36:44.560]  say, I love you, we need to take out Vladimir Putin, like Lindsey Graham said, thank you
[36:44.560 --> 37:12.560]  Mayor Mons, I appreciate the time, peace, God bless you all,
[37:12.560 --> 37:16.320]  thanks for joining us, what do you want to say for yourself, are you kidding Alex, listen
[37:16.320 --> 37:19.680]  I want to tell you something, you are my personal hero, I'm not just saying that, I know a lot
[37:19.680 --> 37:23.280]  of people come on your show in knee pads to kiss your derriere, but I'm telling you, I
[37:23.280 --> 37:27.520]  mean forget about building 7, forget about you know the destabilization and the control
[37:27.520 --> 37:31.120]  demolition of America, I would have never known about that, I was a guy that listened
[37:31.120 --> 37:36.200]  to Howard Stern and kind of believed all the bull crap, and right around 2016 you woke
[37:36.200 --> 37:40.640]  me up realizing about pizza gate, realizing that these people in power are sick perverted
[37:40.640 --> 37:45.600]  satanist, and I'm just telling you, I mean this from the bottom of my heart, thank you,
[37:45.600 --> 37:49.240]  because I've always considered myself a comedian and entertainer, but when I realized that
[37:49.240 --> 37:53.960]  we're living in a world of lies, and you showed me those lies, it changed my life, it gave
[37:53.960 --> 37:56.560]  me freedom, and I'm not being sarcastic, I know I just-
[37:56.560 --> 38:02.080]  No brother, listen and I take that as a huge comment from a man that said that I'm a pimp,
[38:02.080 --> 38:04.480]  I own a blimp, that is super hard.
[38:04.480 --> 38:09.360]  Well I mean listen, I'm a comedian, I like to joke around, but Alex you don't get enough
[38:09.360 --> 38:14.280]  credit, you are one of the most talented entertainers out there, I mean people want to demonize
[38:14.280 --> 38:17.680]  you and say oh you're a conspiracy theorist, but we know that was created by the CIA after
[38:17.680 --> 38:22.280]  the JFK assassination to demonize people looking to the official story, so when I see that
[38:22.280 --> 38:25.840]  they're using that same game plan on you because you're so effective, because you're not only
[38:25.840 --> 38:30.120]  smart, you're not only well versed, but you're entertaining, you're funny, you and I grew
[38:30.120 --> 38:34.520]  up in the same place, Dallas, you're in rock wall, you know, what I'm saying is we're kind
[38:34.520 --> 38:39.480]  of cut from similar claws, and that's why I look up to you so much because you're not afraid
[38:39.480 --> 38:43.560]  to go and blaze your own trail, and this world that everybody wants to be a sheep, everybody
[38:43.560 --> 38:48.400]  wants to fit in, you sir have been demonized, been kicked off every single platform, and
[38:48.400 --> 38:51.720]  you're still successful, you're still grinding, I think you're actually even more popular
[38:51.720 --> 38:55.080]  now even though the numbers might not show it to the mainstream media, but I'm telling
[38:55.080 --> 38:57.200]  you I owe you a debt of gratitude.
[38:57.200 --> 39:03.160]  Alex, thank you and back at you brother, let's talk about conspiracy castles, you don't
[39:03.160 --> 39:08.560]  just do these hilarious raps in front of different city councils, you also go out and do stuff
[39:08.560 --> 39:12.520]  in public with people, that's pretty amazing, you also go and try to interview leftists,
[39:12.520 --> 39:17.600]  they attack you and you're being totally, but the way you handle it is really cool.
[39:17.600 --> 39:22.520]  Well listen, the thing is like, look at this world we're living in, Leah Thomas is a NCAA
[39:22.520 --> 39:27.040]  champion, a person that was born a male that swam on the men's team, and what he is doing
[39:27.040 --> 39:31.160]  is actually destabilizing women's rights, I mean it's the feminization of men and then
[39:31.160 --> 39:35.560]  the masculinization of women, so we're literally like you said in the upside down world, you
[39:35.560 --> 39:40.560]  predicted this and I know I'm going to stop kissing your dairy air, but I'm saying we're
[39:40.560 --> 39:44.560]  too far now, we're almost too far gone where people can actually defend that, because in
[39:44.560 --> 39:48.600]  my mind we're supposed to protect women, I think we should actually put women on a pedestal,
[39:48.600 --> 39:53.800]  yet when you let a man take puberty blockers or excuse me hormone blockers or estrogen,
[39:53.800 --> 39:59.040]  whatever the pill is, I'm not even quite sure what they took, and gets to go smash women's
[39:59.040 --> 40:02.320]  teams, there's women that spend every weekend of their life from high school to college
[40:02.320 --> 40:06.920]  in a swimming pool, they make it to the NCAA championship and then you get second place
[40:06.920 --> 40:11.360]  and you lose to a person like Leah Thomas, that's a disgrace, that should be a crime,
[40:11.360 --> 40:15.960]  but that's the world we live in and people don't want to admit it to themselves, we
[40:15.960 --> 40:20.000]  have a self awareness problem in this country and you are shining a light on that and that's
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.360]  exactly what I'm trying to do, I'm just trying to shine a light on it, when I do these raps,
[40:23.360 --> 40:27.280]  I'm just putting a mirror to the mainstream media, because the mainstream media is so
[40:27.280 --> 40:31.680]  absurd, anything that comes out of Brian Seltzer's mouth, Don Lemon's mouth, if you just repeat
[40:31.680 --> 40:37.160]  that you sound like a buffoon because they are such clowns and sadly the world we live
[40:37.160 --> 40:40.360]  in, there's not enough people exposing it in my opinion Alex.
[40:40.360 --> 40:45.640]  I totally agree and soon they're going to have a biological women's league only that
[40:45.640 --> 40:49.840]  bars biological men, even though they should be barred, because men are now dominating
[40:49.840 --> 40:56.420]  track and field, swimming, wrestling, weightlifting, MMA, biological men are in some cases killing
[40:56.420 --> 41:00.360]  women in the ring and it's funny, for the last.
[41:00.360 --> 41:04.160]  Well Alex, this is the thing is they try to find dirt on me and all they can say is,
[41:04.160 --> 41:07.640]  oh you're transphobic, I'm not transphobic, if a person wants to transition they're sex
[41:07.640 --> 41:11.600]  when they're an adult, go ahead, they can wear tin dresses, I don't care, but the idea
[41:11.600 --> 41:15.260]  that you're doing this to children, you're letting three-year-olds pick their sexuality
[41:15.260 --> 41:19.520]  when they have never even had sex and you're coming to confuse them so you can claim that
[41:19.520 --> 41:23.160]  you're the shepherd leading them into this, it's total grooming and they've even lost
[41:23.160 --> 41:28.000]  Bill Maher, Bill Maher now says it's pedophilia, leave the freaking kids alone, keep your damn
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.240]  hands off of them, let them be innocent.
[41:30.240 --> 41:35.680]  Yeah, 100% and this is the thing, you have guys like, I keep on bringing up Howard Stern,
[41:35.680 --> 41:39.280]  but he still does a bit where he has to use you for clout Alex, I don't know if you see
[41:39.280 --> 41:40.280]  this, I don't want to show anymore.
[41:40.280 --> 41:41.280]  It's pretty funny, yeah.
[41:41.280 --> 41:44.680]  But I'm just, I say funny bit, but that shows you how pathetic he is for content because
[41:44.680 --> 41:48.520]  he's a loser because anybody that listens to him, they've woken up by now to his garbage.
[41:48.520 --> 41:52.440]  You know, he says, oh you should die if you're not boosted, I mean these people that are
[41:52.440 --> 41:58.080]  in power, they literally are giving us a bio weapon that is created by multinational corporations
[41:58.080 --> 42:02.280]  that don't care about America, these corporations are globalist, they care about having world
[42:02.280 --> 42:06.680]  dominance, so they want to destabilize America in order to gain power everywhere else.
[42:06.680 --> 42:11.880]  And that's the problem with this country is we're not run by people, we're run by stockholders
[42:11.880 --> 42:15.240]  of corporations that are able to give the money to the political action committees that
[42:15.240 --> 42:19.480]  make these politicians that I call puppets make decisions that are not in our best interest
[42:19.480 --> 42:22.040]  because think about it, it doesn't matter if you're on the right or the left, there's
[42:22.040 --> 42:26.160]  so many rhinos, Dan, Crenshaw, all those guys, they're all world economic forum, they give
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.160]  us the, you know, the government likes to tee tee on us and tell us it's raining and
[42:30.160 --> 42:31.840]  sadly it comes from both sides.
[42:31.840 --> 42:36.280]  I totally agree, stay right there, it's a corrupt out of control, anti-American globalist ruling
[42:36.280 --> 42:39.520]  class, as we go to break, you're going to rap for us when we come back, but can you
[42:39.520 --> 42:46.600]  just say for us all as we go to break, I'm a pimp, I own a blimp, I'm a pimp, I own
[42:46.600 --> 42:53.120]  a blimp, eat lots of steak and shrimp, you know, I'm on a grant all the time, let's go,
[42:53.120 --> 42:54.120]  I'm going to be continued.
[42:54.120 --> 43:24.080]  I'm a pimp, I own a blimp.
[43:24.080 --> 43:48.200]  Let's go back to what had happened in Russia, to what
[43:48.200 --> 43:50.440]  will be censored and arrested.
[43:50.440 --> 43:54.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around
[43:54.360 --> 43:59.280]  the world against humanity that makes M4 Wars.com more important than ever.
[43:59.280 --> 44:03.940]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[44:03.940 --> 44:09.200]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalists on the other
[44:09.200 --> 44:13.200]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[44:13.200 --> 44:17.400]  For the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations
[44:17.400 --> 44:21.040]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[44:21.040 --> 44:26.480]  That's why they launched their Great Reset and their program after collapsing us of Build
[44:26.480 --> 44:28.240]  Back Better.
[44:28.240 --> 44:34.240]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[44:34.240 --> 44:38.520]  Because they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is
[44:38.520 --> 44:43.880]  the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win, they released a biological weapon
[44:43.880 --> 44:44.880]  on us.
[44:44.880 --> 44:49.880]  And now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago, except simple,
[44:49.880 --> 44:54.280]  they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns, so the global corporate compound
[44:54.280 --> 44:57.480]  released COVID-19, and you know the rest is history.
[44:57.480 --> 44:59.480]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[44:59.480 --> 45:03.000]  This is a great sponsor.
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.200]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated

[47:24.160 --> 47:29.080]  Looks like Tucker Carlson is the smartest Tucker Carlson, but he's also a great comedian.
[47:29.080 --> 47:33.000]  So I know Tucker Carlson, a lot of folks watching, listening, probably say hi to him, Alex,
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  but everybody's saying hi to you.
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.120]  In fact, I bet you're going to end up on Carlson tonight or so if I know him because
[47:38.120 --> 47:40.080]  this is just a huge story and we love it.
[47:40.080 --> 47:43.640]  We're about to go back to you in a moment and he's told us he will grace us with a live
[47:43.640 --> 47:48.880]  rendition of one of his great political satirical rap songs.
[47:48.880 --> 47:53.480]  But first, you know, you talk about Infowars being a 28-year survivor in the fight against
[47:53.480 --> 47:54.480]  the globalists.
[47:54.480 --> 47:56.740]  It's all because of the support and prayer.
[47:56.740 --> 48:05.720]  But we are in the crucible right now facing five trials in the next eight months, one
[48:05.720 --> 48:10.880]  that starts next month with all of the rig courts and kangaroo garbage and total fraud
[48:10.880 --> 48:15.320]  where the Democrats sued us in key areas where they knew that it was all controlled.
[48:15.320 --> 48:17.440]  Literally, it's all come out.
[48:17.440 --> 48:21.960]  And we're still going to battle through that and show it and appeal it and never stop fighting.
[48:21.960 --> 48:26.920]  But that will take millions of dollars to have five trials that they're telling them
[48:26.920 --> 48:33.440]  are going to last up to six weeks apiece with just constant demonization of Alex Jones
[48:33.440 --> 48:35.720]  for months on television.
[48:35.720 --> 48:39.240]  As long as we can stay on air and fund our operation, this will make the broadcast bigger
[48:39.240 --> 48:43.080]  in a way and will backfire on these new world order anti-free speech people and anti-gun
[48:43.080 --> 48:44.080]  folks.
[48:44.080 --> 48:45.480]  So I need your support now.
[48:45.480 --> 48:47.640]  We are maxed out.
[48:47.640 --> 48:48.640]  I have a backup reserve.
[48:48.640 --> 48:52.160]  I've already spent a third of it in the last few months and those reserves will be gone
[48:52.160 --> 48:53.160]  in a few months.
[48:53.160 --> 48:56.040]  We're bringing a few sponsors on and things.
[48:56.040 --> 48:57.040]  Try to cover the shortfall.
[48:57.040 --> 49:01.000]  But I'm just asking listeners that have been on the fence that have never gone to infowarstore.com
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.960]  because the folks that have been going to infowarstore.com, you've done a great job.
[49:03.960 --> 49:04.960]  You're amazing.
[49:04.960 --> 49:08.080]  We've also had supply chain problems and so a lot of the products haven't been in.
[49:08.080 --> 49:10.320]  That's the real reason we're having problems.
[49:10.320 --> 49:14.040]  But there's a lot of great books, a lot of great films, a lot of great t-shirts, a lot
[49:14.040 --> 49:20.400]  of great supplements, a lot of preparedness items at infowarstore.com.
[49:20.400 --> 49:25.240]  And we've got back in stock vitamin D3 gummies that are delicious and so good for your immune
[49:25.240 --> 49:28.480]  system and your bodies, adults and children.
[49:28.480 --> 49:33.160]  We also have the fizzy magnesium, the very best you're going to find out there for your
[49:33.160 --> 49:35.800]  whole body, your whole life, but also for better sleep.
[49:35.800 --> 49:36.800]  Doesn't make you sleepy.
[49:36.800 --> 49:40.280]  It makes you sleep better, especially take it before bedtime, but it's really a pre-workout,
[49:40.280 --> 49:41.280]  post-workout.
[49:41.280 --> 49:42.280]  It's just everything.
[49:42.280 --> 49:45.120]  It's magnesium, highest quality, sold out for eight months.
[49:45.120 --> 49:51.240]  It's back in stock at infowarstore.com and Vaso Beats is 40% off, BioTree Selenium is
[49:51.240 --> 49:52.240]  40% off.
[49:52.240 --> 49:53.240]  Those are back in stock.
[49:53.240 --> 49:54.760]  The others are 25% off.
[49:54.760 --> 49:58.480]  So thank you all for keeping us on the air, infowarstore.com.
[49:58.480 --> 50:02.760]  We need it now more than ever and we're a four on the global side and we're under major
[50:02.760 --> 50:06.080]  attack and they're coming after us because they want to get through us to get to you
[50:06.080 --> 50:07.440]  as President Trump would say.
[50:07.440 --> 50:09.120]  So Alex Stein, please continue.
[50:09.120 --> 50:12.560]  One of the other points you'd like to make it is anytime you feel like it, just bring
[50:12.560 --> 50:14.680]  us to that magic place you bring everybody.
[50:14.680 --> 50:17.960]  Well, I want to say this guys, you need to support Alex.
[50:17.960 --> 50:22.920]  You need to go to infowarstore.com because listen, this guy is not pumped up by the mainstream
[50:22.920 --> 50:27.400]  legacy media and anything you hear from the mainstream, I call the lame stream media is
[50:27.400 --> 50:29.720]  going to be fake news, like Trump said.
[50:29.720 --> 50:34.960]  So this is one of the few places in the world where you can actually get the real truth.
[50:34.960 --> 50:38.880]  So I want to say that support, it doesn't go to some Don Lemon boat party with a bunch
[50:38.880 --> 50:44.280]  of whatever they do on those boats, it goes to a real man that's actually fighting the
[50:44.280 --> 50:48.720]  globalist personally and he's being ramrodded in court, which is totally unfair and we
[50:48.720 --> 50:51.920]  know that he's an innocent man and that it's all BS.
[50:51.920 --> 50:55.960]  But I just want to say I'm primetime 99 so we got to get high vibrational.
[50:55.960 --> 51:02.680]  So for the people at home, I'm a pimp on a blend and you know, I'm eating steak and
[51:02.680 --> 51:11.680]  shrimp infowarstore.com, I get it for my mom, did I play some Donkey Kong and I wear my
[51:11.680 --> 51:19.160]  big old thong, Lindsey Graham was Putin's dad, put a bullet in his head, go insane for
[51:19.160 --> 51:26.520]  the Ukraine, put a bullet in Putin's brain, one more time I'm 99 and you know I grind
[51:26.520 --> 51:33.760]  this ass and you know I blow your mind, Alex Jones ain't no clown, kill your butt with
[51:33.760 --> 51:42.640]  a drone Obama, his wife's a boy, I'ma play you like a toy, you know I am the man, I
[51:42.640 --> 51:50.320]  love Alex Jones, I'm his biggest fan, I'm a pimp on a blend and I got lots of shrimp,
[51:50.320 --> 51:58.680]  don't you know that I flow, that I take it to the flow, to the dome, no clown and I do
[51:58.680 --> 52:05.720]  it on Alex Jones and I love you and I love y'all, we're in Texas, we flexes, you can
[52:05.720 --> 52:13.400]  stop our sign cause I'm 99, info wars will blow your mind, let's go Alex Jones, my
[52:13.400 --> 52:21.520]  hero, who's a zero, you know it's all day long, vaccinate me in my phone, I love you
[52:21.520 --> 52:29.800]  AJ, what more can I say, I love you real king, I love you AJ, you're the man, I appreciate
[52:29.800 --> 52:32.800]  that, I appreciate it and you're the best, I love you too and you're coming to be in
[52:32.800 --> 52:38.280]  studio Friday but here's the deal, I mean in studio Sunday but here's the deal, please
[52:38.280 --> 52:41.680]  cause the audio was messed up on your super number one video in the world, tens of millions
[52:41.680 --> 52:46.480]  of views in 24 hours as you know, number one trending all over the place, can you please
[52:46.480 --> 52:49.840]  or we can wait till next segment if you need to get your breath cause that was amazing,
[52:49.840 --> 52:53.400]  can you repeat or was that just all right off the top of your head what you're saying
[52:53.400 --> 53:00.040]  about Fauci and the New World Order and the one before cause we really, now we got HD
[53:00.040 --> 53:03.640]  audio from you, we want people to see the real magic here.
[53:03.640 --> 53:08.040]  No, I'll bring both, I'll have it prepared, like I said I'm an improvisationalist, I have
[53:08.040 --> 53:12.800]  a few bars as they say in the rap game but I like to go off the dome, Mr. Jones, that's
[53:12.800 --> 53:14.720]  how I do it.
[53:14.720 --> 53:16.960]  Going off the dome.
[53:16.960 --> 53:22.120]  Off the dome and like Obama I'll kill you with a drone, I mean come on, let's talk about
[53:22.120 --> 53:25.120]  that seriously, why are we worried, this is the one serious thing I want to say, this
[53:25.120 --> 53:28.840]  is what makes me so mad, it's Kamala Harris, they're worried about the border between the
[53:28.840 --> 53:33.560]  Ukraine and Russia, yet we're in Texas, one of my good friends died of a fentanyl drug
[53:33.560 --> 53:37.440]  overdose, yet they won't even look at our border, I mean I like to joke around and this
[53:37.440 --> 53:42.200]  and that but it's actually like an open sore in our country, in our state and even our
[53:42.200 --> 53:46.520]  own governor Greg Abbott, they're still not doing enough about it, so I love to joke around
[53:46.520 --> 53:50.280]  and this and that and I will have fun all day long but man it's just really sad that
[53:50.280 --> 53:55.440]  we're about to go into World War 3 for two countries that don't even care about us, whether
[53:55.440 --> 53:59.080]  it doesn't matter which side you're on, I mean I'm not a Putin fan but I'm also not
[53:59.080 --> 54:04.320]  a Zelensky fan of the Azov battalion but I am a fan of Texans, I am a fan of Mexicans,
[54:04.320 --> 54:09.000]  I love Mexicans, I love immigration but the drugs created by the Chinese fentanyl that's
[54:09.000 --> 54:13.000]  coming through our border that's killing my friends and family, it makes me absolutely
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.880]  sick, so just being able to actually talk to somebody that knows what's going on there
[54:16.880 --> 54:19.520]  and that'll actually let you talk about this because you could never bring that up in the
[54:19.520 --> 54:24.080]  mainstream media, oh we gotta worry about World War 3, World War 3, we have World War
[54:24.080 --> 54:28.160]  3 already, it's here at our border in Del Rio and you've exposed that and I hope that
[54:28.160 --> 54:33.360]  I can expose that more and try to fix that problem some sort of way.
[54:33.360 --> 54:36.080]  Really said my friend, we've got three minutes to break, I'll do five more minutes with
[54:36.080 --> 54:40.000]  you before we have our other big news covered and a special guest and a big announcement
[54:40.000 --> 54:45.360]  as well that I'm gonna make better if you leave us but what else is on your radar screen?
[54:45.360 --> 54:50.960]  Well listen Alex, like I said, I mean we talk about, you have really, it's the key point,
[54:50.960 --> 54:54.680]  it's the multinational corporations that are ruining our world and what they're doing
[54:54.680 --> 54:59.000]  is we are the human cattle and I just keep hearing, I don't want to sound like I may
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.440]  just repeat what you say but people need to wake up to what's going on, I mean it's an
[55:03.440 --> 55:08.080]  actual controlled demolition of America and this is what makes me so mad.
[55:08.080 --> 55:11.360]  It's very similar to 9-11, what they did is they brought down those towers and it made
[55:11.360 --> 55:15.420]  us go start a 20 year war in the Middle East and nobody cared, we didn't care about killing
[55:15.420 --> 55:19.080]  a million Muslims, we didn't even talk about the Baki boys that a lot of the Afghanistan
[55:19.080 --> 55:23.640]  guys, they had actual children sex slaves that our own military overlooked.
[55:23.640 --> 55:28.240]  So if people think our military industrial complex has our back, they don't and what's
[55:28.240 --> 55:32.480]  going on right now is this military industrial complex is getting out of a 20 year war in
[55:32.480 --> 55:36.040]  Afghanistan in the Middle East and now they're jumping right into a new one.
[55:36.040 --> 55:40.000]  So this doesn't benefit us, we have drug issues, we have homeless issues, we have all kinds
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.800]  of issues here and if we could just use some of that money to actually fix our problems
[55:43.800 --> 55:47.480]  here, not that money fixes all problems, money doesn't fix drug addiction but it just makes
[55:47.480 --> 55:52.640]  you so mad because we're so incompetent and the people that are running our world are
[55:52.640 --> 55:58.280]  literally satanic worshiping idiots and it comes out of the Bible, Genesis chapter 11
[55:58.280 --> 56:02.880]  verse 9, that's the story of Nimrod wanted to build a tower to the kingdom of heaven
[56:02.880 --> 56:07.640]  to kill God and what God did, he made him speak all different languages so we couldn't
[56:07.640 --> 56:11.480]  communicate and what they're doing is they're trying to reverse engineer Nimrod's plan and
[56:11.480 --> 56:16.520]  they want us under one ruler, one currency, one system so that that system will be ruled
[56:16.520 --> 56:17.880]  by Satan here on earth.
[56:17.880 --> 56:21.880]  So it sounds like a joke, it sounds like I'm kidding, I can joke around all day but that
[56:21.880 --> 56:26.480]  is literally what is happening guys, it is literally out of the Bible, people that like
[56:26.480 --> 56:30.360]  to look at the Bible and they like to invert it, you say oh Alex what are you talking about,
[56:30.360 --> 56:33.040]  just look at Jeffrey Epstein, just look at Bill Clinton, they're hanging out with Marina
[56:33.040 --> 56:37.880]  Abramovich, these people like to be edgy, well it's not that edgy to do spirit cooking,
[56:37.880 --> 56:42.440]  to rub blood and semen on walls and these are top officials that go to these type of
[56:42.440 --> 56:47.200]  parties so I don't worship Satan and I know Alex doesn't worship Satan and that's the
[56:47.200 --> 56:50.040]  problem is the people that are in power actually do worship Satan.
[56:50.040 --> 56:55.160]  That's right, let's be clear, the stuff they're doing in public is the tip of the filthy iceberg.
[56:55.160 --> 57:00.160]  It's nothing, I mean behind closed doors guys, your mind would be, some of the stuff that
[57:00.160 --> 57:03.400]  I've researched makes me sick, it makes me emotional because I'm an emotional person,
[57:03.400 --> 57:07.720]  I wear my heart in my sleep and it's hard, I know the stress you go through knowing the
[57:07.720 --> 57:11.360]  information you know, because there's stuff that you can't even say because you could
[57:11.360 --> 57:14.880]  probably get in trouble, you could worry about actually having a guy jump out of the black
[57:14.880 --> 57:15.880]  band.
[57:15.880 --> 57:18.400]  Well it's just too over the top, I mean people aren't going to believe it exactly like Morpheus
[57:18.400 --> 57:21.640]  says to Neo, I can't tell you about the Matrix, you've got to see it, some of this stuff is
[57:21.640 --> 57:26.860]  over the top, it's documented, I mean if I read Inner Pole and FBI files about real
[57:26.860 --> 57:30.520]  snuff films and real videos that the public never sees and I understand you can't show
[57:30.520 --> 57:35.080]  the public, I mean it is, the descriptions are so horrifying, it makes you physically
[57:35.080 --> 57:39.760]  ill and then you read about how the officers and agents literally have to go into therapy
[57:39.760 --> 57:43.280]  and a lot of them have to end up going into another area of enforcement because it makes
[57:43.280 --> 57:51.520]  them so physically and spiritually sick to see it, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[57:51.520 --> 57:57.000]  Taking advantage of one of nature's most nutrient dense ingredients, VasoBeat will be your new
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.320]  favorite infowars life formula.
[58:01.320 --> 58:06.520]  Using only water and beetroot, VasoBeat is the most concentrated liquid extract to feed
[58:06.520 --> 58:14.680]  on the market. With concentrated beet extract, you can get the high levels of betaine, nitrates
[58:14.680 --> 58:19.880]  and antioxidants you want to help support a healthy liver, athletic performance, blood
[58:19.880 --> 58:28.200]  vessels and more. Don't overlook the power of beetroot, get your naturally occurring
[58:28.200 --> 58:39.520]  potassium, folate, vitamin C, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin K and more. With one of nature's
[58:39.520 --> 58:43.520]  greatest treasures in VasoBeat from infowars life today.
[58:43.520 --> 58:52.600]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we were on the momentum right
[58:52.600 --> 58:56.360]  now, take advantage of this moment and I have all of the idea that something everybody can
[58:56.360 --> 59:01.320]  do with every listener can do. I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to hang banners
[59:01.320 --> 59:06.760]  over highways. Imagine a champion or a piece of a plane, it says Alex George is right infowars
[59:06.760 --> 59:10.120]  dot carm, we stand with the truckers, we'll rest out or whatever it is.
[59:10.120 --> 59:14.400]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this. Yes, now is the time in your small
[59:14.400 --> 59:18.560]  town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on
[59:18.560 --> 59:24.520]  your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction. What do you recommend
[59:24.520 --> 59:25.920]  people say on these banner hangs?
[59:25.920 --> 59:30.760]  I have a few ideas. First of all, help just as much as you can, don't farm, rest out,
[59:30.760 --> 59:34.480]  rest out, swap. The vaccine is poison, there's tons of things. I say just keep it short,
[59:34.480 --> 59:35.480]  keep it concise.
[59:35.480 --> 59:40.000]  No, I agree. Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID-vaxx is poison. Beautiful.
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.520]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be effective though. That's
[59:43.520 --> 59:44.520]  what I'm calling about.
[59:44.520 --> 59:48.760]  God bless you, Chris. In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today. Thank
[59:48.760 --> 59:49.760]  you so much.
[59:49.760 --> 59:56.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:21.760]  Big guess coming up today.
[1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:26.520]  Today about who they are, next segment. And about a huge interview we got coming up very
[1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:31.000]  soon and another big interview that I'm going to be involved in. The word's out on it now
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:34.800]  and it's just started breaking last night, so I'm going to let you know about that coming
[1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:39.000]  up as well. And we got some really bad news, but the good news is when the bad news, we're
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:42.120]  going to be able to stop it. I'll tell you in about six minutes when we start the next
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:43.120]  segment.
[1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:46.680]  Alex Stein will be with us this Sunday. Lord willing, never know, a nuclear war might start
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:50.360]  or a big earthquake like Japan just had. Who knows, but hopefully he'll be here in studio
[1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:56.000]  with us in Austin coming down from up to the DFW area this Sunday, four to six PM central.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:59.240]  But to Alex, we can only salute you. It's got to feel good because I mean, I looked
[1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:04.200]  into you back whenever, six months ago, whatever it was, your first big viral videos, you had
[1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:08.800]  a lot of other big videos as well before and done a lot of really cool stuff and this going
[1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:13.320]  and freestyle rapping that's so popular. That's only a small part of what you do. Tell folks
[1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:15.400]  about what you do at Conspiracy Castle.
[1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:19.520]  Well, the Conspiracy Castle, that's where I like to do long form interviews. I like to
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:23.920]  talk to people of all sides of the aisle and just get people, you know, pick people's brain.
[1:01:23.920 --> 1:01:27.640]  But I want to make this one point is this social media lifestyle that they have is they
[1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:31.920]  literally want to plug us into the metaverse. They want to make you feel guilty about climate
[1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:34.840]  change and they want to hook you up to a machine and they're going to say, Oh, the digital
[1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:39.520]  sex you have in this machine is exactly like real sex. And sadly, though, Alex, they're
[1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:43.240]  making the world hell on earth. So people run to the metaverse. So what I'm trying to
[1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:48.680]  say is, guys, do not plug into the matrix. Stay unplugged. Watch Alex Jones. Watch my
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:52.640]  show. Obviously, we try to give you a little bit of comedy, a little bit of sugar to help
[1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:56.960]  the medicine go down. But in all honesty, guys, if you follow my content, I'm going to give
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:00.920]  you the truth in an entertaining way. That's what I try to do, Alex. That's my plan and
[1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:03.320]  I learned that from you. So I really want to applaud you.
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:08.800]  But isn't it crazy that we're now at the point where the microchipping, the world ID, the
[1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:14.320]  medical tyranny, the social credit score, the metaverse forcing us into this thing and saying
[1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:19.200]  will be forced into it, locking us down, making us telecommute. I mean, we can see their
[1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:23.320]  plan for us. They admit their plan for us. Now it's a question of just saying no.
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:27.080]  Yeah, but Alex, these people are going to run there. They're going to run to the vanilla
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:30.840]  sky because they're there. They could be trans. They can be whatever they want. It's going
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:34.040]  to be like ready player one. People are going to be in trailers and hook on their headset
[1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:37.760]  to their head and probably to their genitals. And I know that sounds like a joke, but that's
[1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:40.840]  literally what it's going to be. No, no, no. And I know some of the top. I mean, literally
[1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:45.760]  I've been out to dinner with some of the top scientists in the world from MIT. You name
[1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:51.480]  it, spacex. You name it. I'm going to leave it at that. And they say the holy grail is
[1:02:51.480 --> 1:02:56.760]  plugging in and giving people endless orgasms and sex spots that are better than human sex.
[1:02:56.760 --> 1:03:00.960]  That's their main directive is take over the procreation of humans.
[1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:04.960]  It's brave new world. I mean, it's just open. That's what they want. They want free sex.
[1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:09.480]  They want you on the anti-depressants. So guys, go to info war store, please go support
[1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:12.840]  Alex like you'd be supporting me if you support Alex. I don't make any money from it, but
[1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:17.080]  I just want to keep Alex on the air as long as possible because he's getting railroaded
[1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:21.880]  in a legal battle that is absurd for him. His free speech has been totally violated.
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:25.520]  Alex should be able to say whatever he said, just like the constitution stated, but unfortunately
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:28.960]  these people have taken away our right to free speech. I've been censored on YouTube.
[1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:31.920]  I'm still on that platform. And the only reason I stay there is because they don't want me
[1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:35.440]  there, Alex. I want to be a thorn in their side. So I do play by their rules. I play
[1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:39.760]  their reindeer games because that's the system that we have. So we have to do it. I have
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:43.920]  to play in color within the lines. But at the same time, you can find this info at band
[1:03:43.920 --> 1:03:48.960]  up video. You can find there are outlets where you can find the truth. So for me, like I
[1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:52.120]  said, I'm not trying to virtue signal. I'm not here to wake people up because most people
[1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:55.680]  don't want to be awake. Most people want to be asleep. But for the people that are out
[1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:59.840]  there that are that are suffering from depression or suffering from anxiety, I'm telling you,
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:03.920]  once you realize the people that are causing that anxiety and depression, it can go away.
[1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:08.600]  You can fix it. And and I said this from the start, I'm not trying to virtue signal one
[1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:11.680]  bit because that's what the left has to do. They say they're virtue signaling yet they're
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:16.680]  destabilizing our country where they do it. So guys, come here, watch this content and
[1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:20.800]  try to try to absorb it as best you can. And that's why I use humor, Alex, because when
[1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:24.440]  you tell people facts like they do on the news, they're people aren't emotionally invested.
[1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:28.480]  No, I agree. We should make it a mantra to cure ourselves from global depression. I am
[1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:32.440]  the pimp. I own the blim because seriously, what you're saying is people subconsciously
[1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:35.880]  are upset because they should be upset because they're not really living in the real world
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:40.800]  by getting out of the matrix. And by facing it, that's what empowers us. That is a very,
[1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:45.840]  very good point. People can find all of the amazing stuff you do. Ben Stein on YouTube
[1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:50.520]  at Conspiracy Castle, Twitter, Alex Stein 99 Instagram at Alex Stein. Congratulations
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:56.240]  on your massive success, sir. Oh, man, I like to forget about it. I'm going to see you Sunday
[1:04:56.240 --> 1:05:05.360]  in studio, man. The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical
[1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:12.920]  tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for
[1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:18.840]  permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[1:05:18.840 --> 1:05:24.360]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:30.040]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[1:05:30.040 --> 1:05:36.520]  that it is a world government corporate takeover. And so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[1:05:36.520 --> 1:05:42.000]  than ever. The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:48.840]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other areas
[1:05:48.840 --> 1:05:53.440]  of the world are following suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time. It's a very
[1:05:53.440 --> 1:06:01.840]  serious situation. Stay tuned into info wars.com because truth is absolutely paramount. Waging
[1:06:01.840 --> 1:06:08.680]  war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info
[1:06:08.680 --> 1:06:24.560]  war. One of the most important guests that you could have on your show to empower people
[1:06:24.560 --> 1:06:30.880]  is going to be joining us in the next segment in about 12 minutes from now, 14 minutes from
[1:06:30.880 --> 1:06:36.400]  now after the break. And I'll tell you who the guest is when they join us. This is so
[1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:41.520]  important. And then have them been, he had been on like almost a year and I'm like why
[1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:44.520]  haven't we gotten Gavin McGinnison? I love Gavin. And Gavin's got so much to say he's
[1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:50.080]  on fire more than ever. The great Gavin McGinnis will be joining us in the third hour today
[1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:54.320]  and the amazing Jay Dyer, expert on the great reset, the new world order, how to stop him.
[1:06:54.320 --> 1:06:59.280]  What a historian. What a mind. What a professor. He'll be covering the transmission in the
[1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:04.280]  fourth hour today. But a very special guest is coming up the next segment. I'll introduce
[1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:11.440]  him when we go to him. Okay. I was sitting here right before I went live and I was very
[1:07:11.440 --> 1:07:16.040]  frustrated and angry today because sometimes I'm locked in loaded and ready to do the show
[1:07:16.040 --> 1:07:22.120]  and I'm in that zone. And then something happens or I get distracted or something else breaks
[1:07:22.120 --> 1:07:25.840]  and then I walk in here. That's why I got to start having a notepad at all times. And
[1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:33.840]  I couldn't remember what it was that made me so upset. And so I said, Hey, Gregory reports
[1:07:33.840 --> 1:07:36.520]  and John Bound reports are more important than anything that I'm going to say. We'll
[1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:42.280]  just air those as I got so angry. It's a weird kind of little OCD thing, but it wasn't that
[1:07:42.280 --> 1:07:45.840]  I was angry that I'd forgotten what the top story was literally out of hundreds here in
[1:07:45.840 --> 1:07:51.560]  front of me was laying right in front of me here. It was that subconsciously my subconscious
[1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:58.720]  mind knew this was horrible, knew this was coming and then was angry at me that I wasn't
[1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:04.320]  in front of the center to address the main threat. So we put a full show headline out
[1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:11.280]  today. That's pretty powerful. But it doesn't really capture it because I dropped the ball
[1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:16.000]  when I was writing the headline. It could not remember it. And the reason I tell the
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:21.120]  story is we're all like this. We're all busy. We all got things going on. And we really
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:25.840]  got to ask ourselves what is most important in our lives? A relationship with God being
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:30.840]  a good person, taking care of our family, enjoying ourselves is important or all work
[1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:35.960]  and no play is going to make you kill yourself and building things and being creative and
[1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:40.960]  challenging yourself and have encouragement first and foremost as God and then family
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:50.320]  and then country. It really comes down to that. And so when I saw this last night and
[1:08:50.320 --> 1:08:54.320]  I remembered all the other statements and all the things that happened, I got very upset.
[1:08:54.320 --> 1:08:59.800]  I had trouble sleeping last night over this. That's why my subconscious mind got so upset
[1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:04.680]  when I got in today and couldn't remember it. And I got literally almost screaming angry.
[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:09.120]  It didn't start screaming, but had to go in my office and breathe deeply for about five
[1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:15.280]  minutes because this is raping that's happening. This is criminal. This is going to kill billions
[1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:21.040]  of people total in starvation. And we have the internal documents out of the EU, out
[1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:28.680]  of the UK, out of Australia, out of New Zealand and out of, did I say Canada and now the U.S.
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:33.800]  that they're going to bring the lockdowns back after the midterms here because it's
[1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:38.200]  such a bad thing for Biden and others. And also in the UK, Boris Johnson was about to
[1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:43.520]  be removed from office. He had a two thirds group in parliament ready to remove him. That's
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:48.000]  how the parliament works. The majority elects the prime minister and you can remove them
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:55.560]  as well with a vote. And so faced with a big build up of awakening, faced with back lashes
[1:09:55.560 --> 1:10:00.240]  around the world, everywhere announced they were going to phase out the controls. And
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:06.640]  I told you then I said they will basically phase them out in some areas of the U.S. but
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:11.360]  not the airports and not the schools and not a lot of the colleges. That's where the enemies
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:19.080]  are strongest, where they control things. So reservations of tyranny, their cancer systems
[1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:26.080]  that they metastasize from, their oppression. And I said in Austria, in Spain, in the UK,
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:29.480]  in Canada, in the U.S., in Australia, it's all going to just come back. In fact, it's
[1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:33.800]  never gone away in Australia or New Zealand. And they don't care how unpopular it is or
[1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:38.600]  how many people commit suicide or how many businesses go out because it's designed to
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:44.640]  be a bank rep who can destroy it. So what am I upset about? Well, Fauci came out. I'll
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:50.160]  play the clipper in a moment. Notice he's been missing the last few months. But now
[1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:56.560]  the leprechaun, the evil leprechaun on St. Paddy's Day has the evil garden gnome, the
[1:10:56.560 --> 1:11:05.440]  anti-St. Patrick's pops out of his rat hole to say, oh, no. Things just can't go back
[1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:10.720]  to normal. The voice of doom, Dr. Fauci warns the U.S. can face more COVID lockdowns as
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:18.440]  he admits latest variant set to hit U.S. is less serious anomachrom. We can't just say
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:23.960]  we're done. No, no, no. We've got to perseverate. And the inventor of the PCR test for COVID
[1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:30.880]  admits that it was so light, without the test, you would have never known you even had it.
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:33.560]  But when it is deadly, is when you're not given medical treatment, if you do get a bad
[1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:37.520]  case, you're not given the steroids, you're not given the intravenous, you're not given
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:42.720]  the ivermectin, you're not given the zinc, you're not given the vitamin D. And so here
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:50.320]  it is. Fauci warns America can face more COVID lockdowns is cases tick up. And it's all based
[1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:57.400]  on a fraudulent PCR test. And so you look at the head of the Canadian Health Ministry.
[1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:02.880]  She said, what, two weeks ago, we played the clip here. She said, oh, it's coming back.
[1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:07.400]  In late November, we're going to put the controls back in. This is a biomedical tyranny. They're
[1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:12.640]  going to release more viruses, not just these lower level variants. And these people must
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:17.240]  be brought to justice, or they're going to continue to launch their same attacks. Pfizer,
[1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:22.160]  Moderna, Fauci Gates, they got caught creating it caught line of Congress caught in gain
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:26.240]  of function, caught covering up data that the vaccine hurt people and didn't protect
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:33.200]  them. It wasn't a vaccine on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. But now
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:39.160]  we're supposed to move. It's all over and move only to the war, which is the new reason
[1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:43.560]  for the global ID and the global sanctions. And Congress passes a law to let Biden sanction
[1:12:43.560 --> 1:12:48.920]  anybody in the world for no reason, including US citizens. So it's all about that bio digital
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:52.720]  tyranny that Trudeau just did, where he said, we can grab your bank account whenever we
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:56.640]  want, however we want, whenever we want. If you're these truckers, and now they say it's
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:02.240]  for everybody. And now it's a permanent emergency. And I said, look for Biden to pull that here.
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:07.920]  And now he's already done it. This is the globalist model. Here's what Fauci had to
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:16.240]  say. Jake, it's not too soon. If you observe the caveat that's associated with that. And
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:22.240]  the caveat is we need to be flexible. And if in fact, we do see a turnaround and a
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:29.720]  resurgence, we have to be able to pivot and go back to any degree of mitigation that is
[1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:35.360]  commensurate with what the situation is. So we can't just say we're done. Now we're going
[1:13:35.360 --> 1:13:41.200]  to move on. We've got to be able to be flexible because we're dealing with a dynamic situation.
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:46.320]  Hopefully the cases will continue to come down as the weather gets warmer. The risk
[1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:51.280]  of being indoor is less. And we'll do well, at least for the coming several months. But
[1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:57.680]  the one thing that's important that's a wild card in this is that there is waning immunity.
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:00.960]  And we got to make sure that those people who that's enough, yeah, we got to have more
[1:14:00.960 --> 1:14:04.640]  vaccines, more shots that actually destroy your immune system. And after eight months
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:08.520]  with the Pfizer, even less of the Moderna, you're at a lower level of immunity before
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:12.760]  you have the shot that you had before it erases your immune system. But the great founder
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:19.120]  and the leader and owner of the UFC who stood up first and said, no mask, had the first
[1:14:19.120 --> 1:14:24.600]  big events, stood up to the fear, totally vindicated. Here's what he had to say yesterday.
[1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:30.400]  Where did COVID go? Where is it? Weeks ago, we all still had to be COVID tested. There
[1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:38.000]  were lines for people to do the drive through COVID testing. Gone. That thing was mutating
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:45.400]  and it was coming through early on. There were these images coming from China. Oh, people
[1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:51.280]  were like, yo, yo, yo, yo, we got this all. What are these images dropping like flies
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:15:01.000]  in the street? We're like, whoa, crazy. So there you go, folks, we can't just let them
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:05.520]  hit us with this, push poisons on us, make hundreds of billions of dollars, create global
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:10.000]  IDs, and then halfway pull it back and hope we just aren't mad and go away and that our
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:14.880]  momentum will all the top scientists and leaders for justice goes away. No, we push harder
[1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:20.520]  and harder. Look at this footage for a TV viewer. It is way scarier than anything ever
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:25.160]  seen a zombie apocalypse movie where the military is going in to stop the zombies, which has
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:28.880]  all been part of the conditioning. It is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:34.400]  vans filling all these lanes of traffic was like thousands going into all these mega cities
[1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:39.800]  that are cookie cutter. These apartment rises, you know, 50 story 100 story insane buildings
[1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:46.640]  rounding up 37 million people to take them to COVID camps. All a giant exercise in biomedical
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:51.600]  tyranny, disappearing whoever the Chinese want and training them all for total submission
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:56.040]  like Jim Jones Kool-Aid drinking drills are huge guests straight ahead in studio. I'm
[1:15:56.040 --> 1:16:02.280]  Alex Jones, anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really
[1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:09.040]  satisfying, empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain. And when it comes to
[1:16:09.040 --> 1:16:16.520]  information, boys, that's true today. We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation
[1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:22.080]  great reset combine trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes. They're they're
[1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:28.480]  transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world
[1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:34.280]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID
[1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:40.520]  this area, their world's gonna end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:45.720]  And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[1:16:45.720 --> 1:16:51.480]  silenced and gas lit. That's why truth comes with hard work and research and diligence.
[1:16:51.480 --> 1:16:55.720]  And that's why it's hard to share in full Wars links and band up video links. That's
[1:16:55.720 --> 1:17:01.560]  why we've got to share them now more than ever. So I did it. I signed up for the Austin
[1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:05.880]  Marathon. I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:11.680]  for prayer and thank goodness for info wars store.com. Before I set out on a run, I throw
[1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:16.520]  down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going. You know, besides the
[1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:22.480]  energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy and
[1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:27.440]  the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance
[1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:32.880]  at getting through the training. And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones, sore less.
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:37.920]  I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they
[1:17:37.920 --> 1:17:43.540]  need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules
[1:17:43.540 --> 1:17:48.360]  help me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy enough
[1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:53.040]  to take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity
[1:17:53.040 --> 1:17:58.400]  you need for every day and so let's keep you moving and feeling great at any age. The first
[1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:04.360]  10 amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791. The first of these broadly
[1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:10.280]  protects the rights of free speech and free press. Free speech means the free and public
[1:18:10.280 --> 1:18:17.040]  expression of opinions without censorship, interference and restraint by the government.
[1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:24.480]  231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack. GCN
[1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:29.480]  is under attack. Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you
[1:18:29.480 --> 1:18:35.920]  to know the truth. I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and help us defend our
[1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:41.760]  right to continue telling you the truth. Would you like to join us? If so, please consider

[1:18:58.720 --> 1:19:02.680]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going
[1:19:02.680 --> 1:19:07.880]  on both at home and the world at large. If you are having trouble getting to that deep
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:14.760]  sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula down and out is just the thing.

[1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:41.000]  you even take it. One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower which
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:46.560]  was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing
[1:19:46.560 --> 1:19:51.400]  qualities. Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because

[1:20:00.480 --> 1:20:09.480]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:09.480 --> 1:20:32.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a very special guest in studio with us. And no, it's not
[1:20:32.080 --> 1:20:37.000]  Mike Tyson. Though that's not going to be happening very, very soon. We've got a big
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:40.960]  in depth interview, amazing behind the scenes, hung out a lot with Mike Tyson. I'm going
[1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:46.240]  to leave it at that. It's going to be airing very, very soon. And there's a lot more. Not
[1:20:46.240 --> 1:20:50.360]  just that. That was one of the things I did when I was out in LA. But that's one of the
[1:20:50.360 --> 1:20:55.240]  biggest. It was amazing, great guy. But, and he has a lot of interesting live experience
[1:20:55.240 --> 1:20:59.360]  and can really empower a lot of people. Talk about a life coach, what he's been through.
[1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:03.200]  It's incredible. But the reason I say this is about as important as a guest as you can
[1:21:03.200 --> 1:21:10.480]  get is because I have friends and family that have used these guys and I sought them out.
[1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:18.480]  And so it's a total 360 win. They can save you up to 90% on taxes, back taxes, real tricks,
[1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:22.320]  not like other tax lawyers that tie you up, get a bunch of money, play games, suck you
[1:21:22.320 --> 1:21:26.560]  dry. They just give you the secrets. It's like magicians that just give you the loopholes,
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:31.720]  give you the secrets on dozens and dozens of different products that they've got. And
[1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:36.880]  when they save you money, up to 90% on average would say a back tax thing or something. They
[1:21:36.880 --> 1:21:41.200]  get part of it and then they sponsor my show, a 360 win. And I hope with the money you save
[1:21:41.200 --> 1:21:44.800]  with just that one big product they've got, one of their biggest, that you'll spend it
[1:21:44.800 --> 1:21:48.920]  at infowarstore.com. So I'm really glad to have him as a sponsor. They were on a few
[1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:54.080]  weeks ago, blew everybody away. They got thousands of calls. This is a product people
[1:21:54.080 --> 1:21:58.880]  really need and it funds the operation. And he exposes the corruption of the IRS and what's
[1:21:58.880 --> 1:22:02.760]  really going on there. And so I wanted to get him in studio. He's Tyler Bennett. He's
[1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:07.520]  a tax professional. They have a whole big giant crew, offices in LA, Vegas, you know,
[1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:13.320]  we went and visited their offices just earlier this week. He's a tax professional, the owner,
[1:22:13.320 --> 1:22:17.920]  operator of the tax firm, American Tax Solutions. Tax Solutions helps individuals and business
[1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:22.760]  owners resolve their tax problems fast, owing money to the IRS to be intimidating and stressful.
[1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:28.000]  They've helped thousands of people lower their liability and get their lives back. Standing
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:32.160]  by your side every step of the way, Tyler has partnered with Alex Jones to provide incredible
[1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:37.680]  savings at jonestaxrelief.com. Takes you to the exact same site, exact same services they
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:43.560]  just then sponsored by the number of customers they get. And it's great because we are battling
[1:22:43.560 --> 1:22:46.600]  just to stay where we're at, folks. If enough people use their services to save a bunch
[1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:50.760]  of money, we can end up actually expanding instead of contracting. So match made in heaven
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:22:55.440]  360 win. Who's partnered with Alex Jones to provide incredible savings at Jones, one
[1:22:55.440 --> 1:23:01.120]  word, Jones tax relief, you can put it on screen, jonestaxrelief.com. Yeah, just that
[1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:11.720]  lower third, jonestaxrelief.com. And you can see 833-900-4285-833-900-4285. Incredible
[1:23:11.720 --> 1:23:17.240]  people and their answer in the phones at 910 at night. This guy is as well. And he is just
[1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:21.160]  absolutely slaying it with the team of people he's got with decades and decades and decades
[1:23:21.160 --> 1:23:26.720]  together of experience as a lawyer, obviously as well. Bookkeeping, business consulting,
[1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:32.680]  business entity selection, estate and trust, tax preparation, financial statements, IRS
[1:23:32.680 --> 1:23:38.640]  representation, payroll services, retirement planning, sales and tax services, tax preparation
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:43.400]  and planning, tax levies and liens release, wage garnishment release, in penalties and
[1:23:43.400 --> 1:23:48.840]  interest, tax negotiations and settlements, reduce IRS tax fee, resolve back taxes, IRS
[1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:53.320]  audit defense, payroll tax negation. And most of their products, you don't pay them any
[1:23:53.320 --> 1:23:56.720]  money. They just go and save you money and then get part of the money they save. So
[1:23:56.720 --> 1:24:00.320]  I'm telling you, this is the type of thing that gets me excited because I only promote
[1:24:00.320 --> 1:24:06.920]  what I believe in, gods, guns, guts, family, red meat, hiking in the woods, standing up
[1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:10.800]  for what you believe in, free speech. This is it. And this guy is a listener and a great
[1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:14.880]  patriot and so are the folks at the company. It was amazing to go there and meet them.
[1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:17.680]  Thank you so much for coming here with your girlfriend and your mom.
[1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:21.800]  Thank you, Alex. Great to be on this show again. Great to be back in the great state
[1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:26.960]  of Texas. I'm a native Texan, haven't been back in a long time. Great to be here. So
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:30.200]  you're telling me you're from Dallas too? I was born in Dallas Children's Hospital.
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:35.760]  Me too. Or I was born in Parkland, but yeah. And now that I see how the guys out in Plano
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:37.960]  are, I'm going to have to come back with a tax rap, clearly.
[1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:43.160]  I tell you, these taxes are causing a lot of trouble. Yeah. So again, I can't hype you
[1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:48.360]  enough because this is something so good. And I remember my dad with a separate company
[1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:53.120]  like yours decades ago with mainline tax lawyers being murdered. And as soon as you found a
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:57.240]  group similar to you, not even as good as you, but great, they fixed all those problems
[1:24:57.240 --> 1:24:59.880]  that you couldn't believe it. And now I've had friends and family that I went and looked
[1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:04.200]  up and recommended you guys years ago, did a great job. That's why I sought you out and
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:06.640]  boom, you're a listener, you're a patriot. It's beautiful.
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:11.000]  Absolutely, Alex, because here's the thing is most tax firms out there, CPA firms, by
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:16.600]  their nature, follow the rules. The IRS makes the rules and they follow the rules down to
[1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:22.080]  a T. Not the law. Not the law. The rules. What they perceive to be the rules. The internal
[1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:28.480]  revenue manual, which is written by attorneys, but interpreted by clerks. So that's who is
[1:25:28.480 --> 1:25:32.920]  making these decisions. And so what you need is not somebody who's just going to listen
[1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:36.880]  what they blindly have to say. You need an advocate who's going to fight so that you
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:40.960]  pay the least amount of taxes. Because even the Bible says, give to Caesar. What is Caesar's?
[1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:42.440]  But don't give them a dime more.
[1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:46.800]  Well, that's right. Explain that to people. All the big wigs basically pay zero or almost
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:50.280]  nothing because they wrote the tax code and the little guy's not supposed to know about
[1:25:50.280 --> 1:25:54.840]  that. And it's just totally insane that the average CPA won't tell you about tax incentives.
[1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:58.240]  They won't tell you about, they won't tell you about all those special write offs. They
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:03.520]  tell you don't take those. You might get audited. But that's really just a straw, straw tiger,
[1:26:03.520 --> 1:26:04.520]  isn't it?
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:10.400]  It sure is, Alex. Since the 16th Amendment was passed in 1913, there's been two basic
[1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:16.460]  systems of taxation in this country. One for the globalist, the elitist, the uber-wealthy,
[1:26:16.460 --> 1:26:21.280]  and one for the entire rest of the country. And that's what we all pay. And what we aim
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:27.760]  to do with my firm and in conjunction with InfoWars is provide the services typically
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:32.120]  of reserve for the elitist, for the average person.
[1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:38.600]  And again, this seems like magic. It's not. Most lawyers and CPAs want to milk you and
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:42.680]  won't tell you about this. And because they never get problems, never have to defend what
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:46.440]  they've done and what they've signed off on, like you guys do, if they just give everything
[1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:50.240]  over to the system, even like blue collar people paying 30, 40% of their income, it's
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:56.240]  total fraud. But with you guys, you go with what the real law is, not just what BS they've
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:26:57.240]  made up.
[1:26:57.240 --> 1:27:02.200]  Right. Alex, so the Internal Revenue Code has been written in a way so it is basically
[1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:06.720]  impossible to understand by the layperson. And they did that on purpose so that they
[1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:12.040]  can take their deductions, not pay anything in taxes, and still hit up the middle class
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:17.720]  with outrageous tax rates. And so what we do is we're knowledgeable in the IRC. We know
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:24.120]  the regs and we can use those same rules, the law actually, to make sure you're not
[1:27:24.120 --> 1:27:25.520]  paying a dime more than you have to.
[1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:30.720]  I had the owner, a friend of mine, but the owner of one of the largest tax-preparing groups
[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:37.800]  in Texas, told me, he said, Alex, you're absolutely right. The 1913 tax code is for
[1:27:37.800 --> 1:27:40.800]  social engineering by the rich to keep the poor poor.
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:41.800]  Absolutely.
[1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:42.800]  They all know that.
[1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:48.680]  Yes. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's, it's, that's actual history. And here's the thing, too,
[1:27:48.680 --> 1:27:54.000]  is if you don't agree with what this administration is doing, you know, your tax dollars are going
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:58.040]  to fund it. Percentage is going to NATO. Percentage is going to the Ukraine war effort. You know,
[1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:01.640]  you're paying for that. So you want to make sure that you're paying the least amount of
[1:28:01.640 --> 1:28:06.240]  possible, because guess what? You're also paying for it at the pump.
[1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:09.120]  Continue on talking about your company and what it does, because I just don't want people
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:14.720]  to understand no client's too small. No client is too big. And people should always get different
[1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:17.840]  tax advice. You guys cut right to the chase.
[1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:23.880]  Absolutely, Alex. No client is too small. No one is too big. Listen, there are, there
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:28.200]  are a multitude of tax issues you could have, but it kind of comes down into one of three
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:34.560]  categories. Okay. The past, the present, and the future. If you already owe money, we can
[1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:39.360]  use government programs and other things that exist that they don't tell you about, but
[1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:43.360]  they have to tell me about because I'm a tax practitioner and we can use that to lower
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:44.880]  your liability. Okay.
[1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:49.160]  That's past. Let's come back with present and future straight ahead with Tyler Bennett,
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:53.920]  Jones tax relief.com. Folks, you need to get involved with these guys. You look at their
[1:28:53.920 --> 1:28:59.840]  website, you need to take action. We'll be right back.
[1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:04.880]  Taking advantage of one of nature's most nutrient dense ingredients, vasobites will be your
[1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:12.680]  new favorite infowars life formula. Using only water and beetroot, vasobite is the most
[1:29:12.680 --> 1:29:20.360]  concentrated liquid extract to feed on the market. With concentrated beet extract, you
[1:29:20.360 --> 1:29:25.560]  can get the high levels of betaine, nitrates, and antioxidants you want to help support
[1:29:25.560 --> 1:29:34.360]  a healthy liver, athletic performance, blood vessels, and more. Don't overlook the power
[1:29:34.360 --> 1:29:41.760]  of beetroot. Figure naturally occurring potassium, folate, vitamin C, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin
[1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:57.880]  K, and more with one of nature's greatest treasures in vasobite from infowars life today.
[1:29:57.880 --> 1:30:04.440]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth. And the
[1:30:04.440 --> 1:30:11.720]  next big casualty isn't even the people that died. No, that invariably follows. But first,
[1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:19.480]  there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty, and speech, and massive censorship.
[1:30:19.480 --> 1:30:25.080]  And now across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation's being introduced
[1:30:25.080 --> 1:30:35.040]  that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can be arrested,
[1:30:35.040 --> 1:30:39.680]  you can be imprisoned. And of course now, Canada's introduced legislation that if you
[1:30:39.680 --> 1:30:46.280]  have a thought crime, and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online,
[1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:51.480]  that you will be censored and arrested. Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being
[1:30:51.480 --> 1:30:56.400]  carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes infowars.com more
[1:30:56.400 --> 1:30:57.880]  important than ever.
[1:30:57.880 --> 1:31:03.480]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here, all over the world, from Australia to
[1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:07.560]  the United States, from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you
[1:31:07.560 --> 1:31:12.000]  do everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases, actually
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:17.280]  taking people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next
[1:31:17.280 --> 1:31:22.160]  year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people
[1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:26.000]  away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:30.880]  law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[1:31:30.880 --> 1:31:34.720]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government
[1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:40.320]  military grade at InfowarsStore.com. We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to

[1:31:55.640 --> 1:31:57.840]  the InfowarsStore.com.

[1:32:08.620 --> 1:32:16.860]  Triple A, 2533139. Triple A, 2533139. Triple A, 2533139 is the InfowarsStore hotline. Triple
[1:32:16.860 --> 1:32:23.820]  A, 2533139. Triple A, 2533139. Triple A, 2533139. Triple A, 2533139 is the InfowarsStore
[1:32:53.820 --> 1:32:58.040]  that's info.com
[1:32:58.040 --> 1:33:05.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:05.900 --> 1:33:19.240]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:19.240 --> 1:33:30.360]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance
[1:33:30.360 --> 1:33:37.520]  with Tyler Bennett, the owner and head of tax professionals over at American Tax Solutions.
[1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:41.760]  You go to jonestaxrelief.com so that when you go get great service, we get the credit
[1:33:41.760 --> 1:33:45.520]  and they continue to be a big sponsor that keeps us on the air.
[1:33:45.520 --> 1:33:48.440]  And again, I only bring you things that I believe in that are amazing.
[1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:56.280]  I can only tell you that this is the area of life that anybody, whether you're a welder
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:00.400]  or whether you are an auto mechanic or whether you're a school teacher, whether you're an
[1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:04.800]  FBI agent, whether you are a movie director, whether you own an auto parts store, whether
[1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:10.360]  you're a farmer or rancher, whether you're a millionaire, a billionaire, it doesn't matter.
[1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:15.160]  Not knowing about these things is what's destroying you.
[1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:19.000]  You can buy these self-help books people put out that are like the size of a phone book
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:22.480]  that have every year whatever the new tricks are that are in the code, but you got to have
[1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:25.760]  an expert that wants to just do it quick, get it done, see what you're doing, sign off
[1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:30.120]  on it so that they're certifying it, their names on it, so you're protected, but they
[1:34:30.120 --> 1:34:31.960]  know they're going to stand behind it.
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:37.040]  That's the key to all of this and that's why these other lazy groups and others don't actually
[1:34:37.040 --> 1:34:38.040]  let you know what's happening.
[1:34:38.040 --> 1:34:40.880]  I'm going to stop ranting though, Tyler, go back to the three things.
[1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:42.320]  The past, the present, and the future.
[1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:43.320]  This is so important.
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:49.440]  Absolutely, Alex, so of the multitude of different problems you could have in the tax arena,
[1:34:49.440 --> 1:34:52.240]  it really comes down to past, present, and future.
[1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:55.320]  As I was just saying, the past means you already owe money.
[1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:57.000]  There's leans out against you.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:01.600]  The IRS and the state might be coming to your door, coming to your business, harassing your
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:02.600]  family.
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:06.480]  We could put that to immediate stop and get those taxes reduced to something you can afford
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:07.960]  to pay back.
[1:35:07.960 --> 1:35:09.600]  Now we have the present.
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:13.760]  The present is this year right now and that means if you need to file, we can help you
[1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:14.760]  file.
[1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:19.640]  Don't go to one of the big box tax shops to file because at the end of the day, a lot
[1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:22.960]  of people don't know, those companies are not tax companies.
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:28.120]  They're technology companies and the clerk that's inputting your information has about
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:31.280]  as much tax education as the layperson, right?
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:34.600]  So you want to go to a true advocate that's going to help you out and get you all the
[1:35:34.600 --> 1:35:35.600]  deductions.
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:38.360]  Again, it's done like that by design because a clerk that doesn't know what they're doing
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:42.200]  is entering it, but also the average IRS agent is a clerk as well.
[1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:43.200]  That's absolutely right, Alex.
[1:35:43.200 --> 1:35:44.200]  So it's dumb and dumber.
[1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:48.960]  Dumb and dumber and they just co-sign each other's BS and that's how it works.
[1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:52.560]  So what we do is we go in there and we say, hey, dumb and dumber, get out of the way.
[1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:53.560]  That's not what their law is.
[1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:56.840]  That's not what the rules are from the IRM and we put it down right, okay?
[1:35:56.840 --> 1:35:57.920]  So that's the present.
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:02.880]  And now arguably, and I'd say definitely the most important is the future.
[1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:08.320]  This is for the person right now who says, hey, Alex, I paid so much in taxes this
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:09.320]  year.
[1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:12.640]  What can I do to make sure I don't pay that much next year?
[1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:17.080]  And what that means is getting you in the proper corporate set up entity, depending
[1:36:17.080 --> 1:36:18.880]  on the type of work you're doing.
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:22.560]  You can't run a business in America without proper tax planning and that's why 90% of
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:27.400]  new businesses fail because they go get their taxes, detonation, or block.
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:28.400]  Absolutely.
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:33.440]  And you know what, when a business fails, the first thing they stop doing is paying
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:38.920]  their taxes, which is just put a knife in the heart because now the state and the IRS
[1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:41.640]  will make sure you get taken out.
[1:36:41.640 --> 1:36:43.160]  Continue please.
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:44.160]  Okay.
[1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:52.880]  So something that, as I was saying before, the really important thing here is that the
[1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:57.000]  government wants to come after the things that make the populace powerful, right?
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:59.240]  And we know they've been coming after your guns for years, okay?
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:05.720]  But they want to come after your money, too, because if the middle class has too much wealth,
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:09.400]  then the globalists, the elite, you're not dependent on the government.
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:10.400]  And the people get this now.
[1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:11.400]  Is this announced?
[1:37:11.400 --> 1:37:12.720]  We want to make you poor to control you.
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:13.720]  You will own nothing, have nothing.
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:17.200]  And they think we're too dumb to get around what they've done because they always leave
[1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:18.760]  escape hatches for themselves.
[1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:19.760]  Right.
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:20.760]  So while they're at the top...
[1:37:20.760 --> 1:37:24.040]  We met for like four or five hours off and on in LA, so we've been talking to each other
[1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:25.040]  zero off about this.
[1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:26.040]  We sure have.
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:31.000]  And yeah, it's like we said, there's two systems in the world where they skate by at the top
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:36.360]  paying next to nothing or nothing, while the middle class is stuck with the highest tax
[1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:41.200]  rates and it's ridiculous and it's not right.
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:45.560]  Well, I just can't stress for people enough they shouldn't feel intimidated like you're
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:48.280]  trying to be a fancy pants lawyer or some group.
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:49.520]  You guys want to hear from everybody.
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:53.520]  So describe the services and some of the average things you can do.
[1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:56.880]  But also you try to get this last time we didn't have time, some of the horror stories
[1:37:56.880 --> 1:38:00.840]  and examples of what they're gearing up to do now with Biden saying he's coming after
[1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:01.840]  the middle class.
[1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:05.840]  They admit almost all these preparers and all these new groups they're having and all
[1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:10.600]  these new investigators, they're saying that they're going after the middle class and poor
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:11.600]  people.
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:15.200]  Well, the thing is they're going after the middle class with a trifecta, right?
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:19.920]  So the inflation is making your dollar worth less, your purchasing power worth less.
[1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:24.560]  At the same time, they have hired 60,000 or they want to IRS agents.
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:27.000]  Well, guess who's going to pay for that?
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  You and me.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  And that's going to come out of our taxes.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:32.600]  And why does the IRS say they want to see everybody's bank accounts at live times anything
[1:38:32.600 --> 1:38:34.480]  over $600 of transactions a year?
[1:38:34.480 --> 1:38:36.000]  That's all bank accounts.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:37.800]  So they're going to watch everything in live time.
[1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:38.800]  They're already doing it.
[1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:39.800]  But why are they announcing it?
[1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:44.720]  Well, do you know the reason why they're doing this, Alex, is because they could very easily
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:46.160]  close the tax gap.
[1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:49.960]  The tax gap is the difference between how much the IRS says they're going to make and
[1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:54.640]  how much they actually do make by taxing the globalist properly.
[1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:59.760]  But instead of doing that, they want to hit up the middle class for $600.
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:00.960]  Please continue.
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:06.800]  So here's the thing is like, let's say I am on eBay and I sell an old pair of shoes or
[1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:10.880]  baby clothes that my son doesn't wear anymore.
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:14.760]  And they know under the great reset, they want to eradicate the underground market.
[1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:21.120]  Yes, they do because in, and here's the thing before Biden passed that bill, if you sold
[1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:25.880]  something on eBay, you're fine unless until you start to have a pattern of 20 more transactions
[1:39:25.880 --> 1:39:27.080]  over $20,000.
[1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:31.160]  And they say, okay, prove to us it's not a business, prove to us it's not income.
[1:39:31.160 --> 1:39:36.720]  Now if you make one transaction over $600, they're saying prove to us it's not a gift,
[1:39:36.720 --> 1:39:37.720]  prove to us it's not income.
[1:39:37.720 --> 1:39:41.240]  As they press us into a system, we will only survive by barter.
[1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:42.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:46.400]  If you're trading a bicycle for two pigs, well now it's the Internet of Things, that
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:49.680]  bicycle has a code on it, they're going to know you transferred it.
[1:39:49.680 --> 1:39:50.680]  That's right.
[1:39:50.680 --> 1:39:52.160]  They know everything.
[1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:53.160]  And that's the thing.
[1:39:53.160 --> 1:39:55.200]  So that, that leads me to another thing.
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:39:59.640]  And so they, they took some flak for this, but they're still doing it under the radar
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:01.720]  is the biometric data, right?
[1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:06.320]  So the IRS started collecting biometric data for regular taxpayers, just trying to access
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:08.760]  their online IRS account.
[1:40:08.760 --> 1:40:11.400]  And then, you know, they got some serious backlash about it and said they were going
[1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:16.760]  to stop doing it, but they've already collected 73 million taxpayers' data.
[1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:18.180]  And they haven't got rid of it yet.
[1:40:18.180 --> 1:40:22.520]  So the thing is, you don't want to give information to the wrong people because they're only going
[1:40:22.520 --> 1:40:23.520]  to use it against you.
[1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:24.520]  Okay.
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:25.520]  The IRS does not have your background.
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:26.520]  Oh yeah, folks.
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:28.280]  You think like, oh, I'll give people all my info.
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:29.280]  What do I have to hide?
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:30.280]  No, they twist it against you.
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:31.280]  Exactly.
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:32.280]  Exactly.
[1:40:32.280 --> 1:40:33.280]  I've learned that in these lawsuits, man.
[1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:35.760]  They'll take the most innocuous thing and turn it into the most horrible thing.
[1:40:35.760 --> 1:40:36.760]  100%.
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:41.200]  So in, oh, speaking of that, so, you know, if there's people out there that have some
[1:40:41.200 --> 1:40:43.920]  kind of legal settlement, let me talk about a horror story.
[1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:44.920]  Okay.
[1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:48.480]  This is, this is, this is, uh, fabulous, something that I, uh, had worked on.
[1:40:48.480 --> 1:40:52.960]  One of my first clients, a great guy, was in a workers' comp oxygen paralyzed from the
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:53.960]  neck down.
[1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:54.960]  Okay.
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:56.800]  Workers' comp is not taxable per the code.
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:40:57.800]  But guess what?
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:41:01.880]  The revenue officer assigned to his case was taxing him a non-taxable income.
[1:41:01.880 --> 1:41:07.240]  They brought this paralyzed man, fully paralyzed, down to the poverty level, and he had to go
[1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:08.240]  collect welfare.
[1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:09.240]  Okay.
[1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:10.240]  And when I got in...
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:11.240]  They were homeless.
[1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:12.240]  Yeah.
[1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:13.240]  Absolutely.
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:16.240]  Because, and he didn't know that, that his rights were being violated, right?
[1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:17.560]  Because they don't tell you.
[1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:18.560]  They don't tell you.
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:19.760]  And it's just like the police.
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:23.000]  Hey, hey, can I, uh, can I look in here, even though I don't have the right to?
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  And you say, yes.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.680]  You're consenting to have your rights violated.
[1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:30.920]  And the IRS uses the exact same logic.
[1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:34.320]  And so you guys are experts of a huge team, man, like a giant.
[1:41:34.320 --> 1:41:36.480]  That's just one of your men at 14,000 square feet.
[1:41:36.480 --> 1:41:37.480]  That's amazing.
[1:41:37.480 --> 1:41:38.480]  Yeah.
[1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:42.520]  Well, because, well, listen, got a lot of attorneys, a lot of CPAs, a lot of enrolled
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:47.800]  agents, um, and then all the people that work under them, of course, because we don't just
[1:41:47.800 --> 1:41:49.080]  deal with the IRS.
[1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:50.080]  We do.
[1:41:50.080 --> 1:41:51.080]  Now you're lucky in Texas here.
[1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:52.080]  There's no income tax.
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:56.760]  Where I'm from, in Commiforna, it's the highest in the nation, and we deal with all 50 state
[1:41:56.760 --> 1:41:58.440]  taxes as well.
[1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:01.440]  So that's why we need to have a varied amount of professionals.
[1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:02.960]  You have experts for every area.
[1:42:02.960 --> 1:42:03.960]  Absolutely.
[1:42:03.960 --> 1:42:04.960]  I was very impressed by it.
[1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:05.960]  You guys are not playing games.
[1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:06.960]  Right.
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:10.840]  They're not playing around, they're playing, uh, you know, you know, playing online, solitary.
[1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:12.640]  They're on the phones, man.
[1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:18.120]  Hey, man, I've been staying there till nine, 10 o'clock at night, you know, because these
[1:42:18.120 --> 1:42:21.880]  people want help and that's what gives me passion.
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:23.560]  That's what I'm emotional about, Alex.
[1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:24.560]  It makes me feel good.
[1:42:24.560 --> 1:42:27.120]  Isn't it great that your lawyer that actually gets to help people and most of them screw
[1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:30.800]  people all day, you're actually like giving them the secrets to how this insiders are
[1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:31.800]  screwing them.
[1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:32.800]  Right.
[1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:35.440]  You know, lawyers get a bad name because the ambulance chasers and all of them and
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:38.040]  they're just trying to screw the hardworking people out of their money.
[1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:40.120]  We're trying to put it back in your pocket.
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:41.360]  And that's what we're going to do.
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:45.160]  I'm telling you, I'm so excited about this relationship, jonestaxrelief.com, and I'm
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:47.480]  so glad that I recommended you guys, people use it.
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:50.040]  So I called you and I'm so glad that you got connected with us.
[1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:51.200]  It's just meant to happen, folks.
[1:42:51.200 --> 1:43:17.200]  It's jonestaxrelief.com, 833-945, we'll be right back.
[1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:46.460]  Thank you.
[1:43:46.460 --> 1:43:51.460]  take them both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[1:43:51.460 --> 1:43:56.180]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarestore.com, where we promise
[1:43:56.180 --> 1:43:59.500]  our rose hips don't lie.
[1:43:59.500 --> 1:44:03.500]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[1:44:03.500 --> 1:44:08.940]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss like everybody else
[1:44:08.940 --> 1:44:19.660]  has. And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[1:44:19.660 --> 1:44:25.660]  and bled and sweat for. And now we're just throwing it all away.
[1:44:25.660 --> 1:44:31.620]  And I see the general public, ENA, medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral,
[1:44:31.620 --> 1:44:37.980]  psychologically controlled, transient. And I know we're being fed into this globalist
[1:44:37.980 --> 1:44:44.980]  nature and it's so incredibly sad. But this is the process of birth and then growth and
[1:44:44.980 --> 1:44:50.900]  then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[1:44:50.900 --> 1:44:55.220]  It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence
[1:44:55.220 --> 1:44:59.700]  and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[1:44:59.700 --> 1:45:05.100]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[1:45:05.100 --> 1:45:09.020]  happening in the atmosphere. But if you look at all the different studies and reports about
[1:45:09.020 --> 1:45:13.820]  my NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening
[1:45:13.820 --> 1:45:20.020]  with the climate. The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[1:45:20.020 --> 1:45:25.300]  So yes, climate change is totally real. But notice first they called it global freezing
[1:45:25.300 --> 1:45:28.620]  back in the 70s and 80s and then it's going to be global warming and when that didn't
[1:45:28.620 --> 1:45:32.620]  really happen the way they wanted it to. Okay, now it's just climate change. But did you
[1:45:32.620 --> 1:45:38.340]  know that manmade climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations
[1:45:38.340 --> 1:45:43.220]  and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN? They have weather control trees
[1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:48.700]  from 1979. Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time. In fact,
[1:45:48.700 --> 1:45:53.100]  back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles
[1:45:53.100 --> 1:45:58.740]  out of jet engines to control the weather. So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[1:45:58.740 --> 1:46:04.260]  It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though
[1:46:04.260 --> 1:46:09.620]  you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[1:46:09.620 --> 1:46:14.780]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what
[1:46:14.780 --> 1:46:20.780]  you do. So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down. Protecting
[1:46:20.780 --> 1:46:24.700]  your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[1:46:24.700 --> 1:46:29.340]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount. That's why everybody
[1:46:29.340 --> 1:46:35.100]  should visit InfowarsStore.com. We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made in

[1:46:53.140 --> 1:47:00.140]  It's amazing.
[1:47:23.140 --> 1:47:39.140]  Give me back my bullets. That's what your money is, is your bullets to live your life
[1:47:39.140 --> 1:47:45.860]  the way you want. Take care of your family and I got to tell you, God is so good because
[1:47:45.860 --> 1:47:50.580]  we need to fund our operations and because of supply chain breakdowns, a lot of the products
[1:47:50.580 --> 1:47:56.740]  that have been best sellers are no longer available. And so I've told listeners, hey,
[1:47:56.740 --> 1:48:00.460]  you were great. We could fund ourselves a few years ago because of the COVID cattywampus
[1:48:00.460 --> 1:48:04.620]  and everything. We can't. So I said, all right, I'll do like every other talk show host
[1:48:04.620 --> 1:48:08.220]  does. We have our own network though, our own infrastructure that costs more. I'm going
[1:48:08.220 --> 1:48:14.940]  to go out and get sponsors, but I could snap my fingers and gotten $10 million like Newsmax
[1:48:14.940 --> 1:48:19.420]  did and $100 million like Fox did to push the COVID garbage. Yeah, that's come out now.
[1:48:19.420 --> 1:48:25.260]  But I didn't. So I've got to go out and get sponsors and make money in ways that I know
[1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:29.820]  are good because God doesn't protect me if I'm not doing good. I mean, I'm not going
[1:48:29.820 --> 1:48:36.180]  to steer somebody somewhere that I don't absolutely believe in is, is there a perfect world? No,
[1:48:36.180 --> 1:48:40.300]  but it's the very best place. I think you can go with the very best options to know
[1:48:40.300 --> 1:48:43.660]  your facts. You only want to get into all this, but you've got a few more of these horror
[1:48:43.660 --> 1:48:48.140]  stories. I want people to actually understand your services and what you do. You go and
[1:48:48.140 --> 1:48:53.500]  negotiate on so many fronts with the IRS, other groups, whatever. And then you simply
[1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:57.780]  explain, okay, here's what they're offering. And here's our fee to get that done. And it's
[1:48:57.780 --> 1:49:03.060]  all completely cut and dry. And people could see that immediately take effect. That's right.
[1:49:03.060 --> 1:49:10.020]  So unlike a lot of law firms that charge expensive retainers and hourly fees, we, we charge simple
[1:49:10.020 --> 1:49:17.060]  flat rates. Also we take crypto. We are one of the few firm tax firms in America that will
[1:49:17.060 --> 1:49:22.340]  help you with all your crypto because you know, even like Deloitte and Ernst and Young,
[1:49:22.340 --> 1:49:26.140]  they don't want to touch that stuff because it's too dicey. We're not scared of it. We're
[1:49:26.140 --> 1:49:29.300]  not scared of the IRS. We will help you with your crypto.
[1:49:29.300 --> 1:49:33.460]  Beautiful. Talk about more of the services you guys have over at JonesTaxRelief.com.
[1:49:33.460 --> 1:49:35.980]  That's the link to follow folks, JonesTaxRelief.com.
[1:49:35.980 --> 1:49:40.780]  So something that's really important, Alex, is protecting the taxpayers right, right?
[1:49:40.780 --> 1:49:46.180]  So the IRS actually has what's called the taxpayers bill of rights and they never actually,
[1:49:46.180 --> 1:49:50.060]  you know, make sure they're following it. But that's where we come in as advocates and
[1:49:50.060 --> 1:49:56.140]  make sure they are because the IRS has become fond of taking people's passports when they
[1:49:56.140 --> 1:50:00.860]  owe money. So they take away your constitutional right to travel because you owe money to the
[1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:04.980]  government. And that's wrong. And if that has happened to you, you need to give us a
[1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:08.940]  call right now because I can get that passport released right now.
[1:50:08.940 --> 1:50:12.780]  I mean, there's so and going to the future, everything is them using the code to jack
[1:50:12.780 --> 1:50:17.460]  with people. Look at this house passes Russian sanctions bill, giving president authority
[1:50:17.460 --> 1:50:22.580]  to sanction virtually anyone anywhere in the world, including Americans with no due process.
[1:50:22.580 --> 1:50:23.580]  This is BS.
[1:50:23.580 --> 1:50:28.140]  Totally. And you remember that first box last year when you filled out your taxes, it says,
[1:50:28.140 --> 1:50:33.580]  do I have any digital assets? That's so that Biden can put you as a part of that group
[1:50:33.580 --> 1:50:37.380]  of people who they have already said are criminals because of the type of asset.
[1:50:37.380 --> 1:50:39.300]  And they're asking you to opt into it.
[1:50:39.300 --> 1:50:44.820]  Exactly. Opt into it. It's like what you say, submit with a smile, you know, and that's
[1:50:44.820 --> 1:50:50.260]  what they want you to do. And look, it's a catch 22 because what if you lied on your
[1:50:50.260 --> 1:50:52.740]  return? Well, then Biden's definitely coming after you.
[1:50:52.740 --> 1:50:59.180]  How do you get by that? It tricks you to either purge it yourself or incriminate yourself
[1:50:59.180 --> 1:51:00.820]  when you've done nothing wrong.
[1:51:00.820 --> 1:51:06.620]  Exactly. So what you need to do is make sure that your crypto taxes are handled correctly.
[1:51:06.620 --> 1:51:10.820]  And we are experts in that and we can do that because you don't want to lie to the government.
[1:51:10.820 --> 1:51:12.900]  That's a felony. I don't want to do that.
[1:51:12.900 --> 1:51:19.540]  But again, it's your right as a taxpayer to not pay a penny more than you owe using all
[1:51:19.540 --> 1:51:24.380]  the deductions, all the loopholes in the code that they leave for themselves that they do.
[1:51:24.380 --> 1:51:28.660]  And because that's the key, folks, while you're all locked down or wearing masks on airplane,
[1:51:28.660 --> 1:51:32.900]  they're all in private jets and they never did that. Everything they do, they give themselves
[1:51:32.900 --> 1:51:37.860]  millions. You find the exemption, have an expert show you how to do it right, do it
[1:51:37.860 --> 1:51:41.340]  for you and then certify it. Don't try it on your own. I'm telling you.
[1:51:41.340 --> 1:51:46.060]  Right. And here's the thing. Even with the self-help books, Alex, is they put it...
[1:51:46.060 --> 1:51:49.900]  Oh, I know so many people did great with those, but they made a mistake with the jail.
[1:51:49.900 --> 1:51:50.900]  Right. Because...
[1:51:50.900 --> 1:51:52.900]  You've got to do it. You've got to have a group that signs on to it.
[1:51:52.900 --> 1:51:57.860]  The globalists change the tax laws every three to four years. So then, unless you spend
[1:51:57.860 --> 1:52:02.140]  all day studying it like we do, you're going to fall behind and the law changes.
[1:52:02.140 --> 1:52:05.780]  And let me guess, even if you suddenly retire but want to know it, you'd never know it all
[1:52:05.780 --> 1:52:07.580]  because you're in there every day while you know it.
[1:52:07.580 --> 1:52:08.580]  Exactly.
[1:52:08.580 --> 1:52:09.780]  It's like, I know politics and I'm in an all-concept.
[1:52:09.780 --> 1:52:13.700]  Exactly. As soon as I retire, I won't know what it is anymore either because they change
[1:52:13.700 --> 1:52:17.340]  it so fast. But I'll probably never retire. I love working.
[1:52:17.340 --> 1:52:20.460]  And my point is you're immersed in your works while you know.
[1:52:20.460 --> 1:52:25.500]  Absolutely. It's my passion. I love saving people money. I love making sure the government
[1:52:25.500 --> 1:52:29.700]  doesn't take your hard-earned income because you work for that.
[1:52:29.700 --> 1:52:33.060]  Well, the way I've had it described to me by other really good tax lawyers like yourself
[1:52:33.060 --> 1:52:38.940]  is, Alex, it takes rocket scientists to understand this. No wonder the average tax preparer can't...
[1:52:38.940 --> 1:52:43.180]  They don't understand it. That's why special firms, these groups use, you guys and others
[1:52:43.180 --> 1:52:44.940]  have reverse engineered that.
[1:52:44.940 --> 1:52:48.740]  We have. And I'd go as far as to say rocket science is probably a lot easier than understanding
[1:52:48.740 --> 1:52:49.740]  the tax code.
[1:52:49.740 --> 1:52:50.740]  Yeah.
[1:52:50.740 --> 1:52:55.900]  They have lobbyists in billions of dollars that their sole purpose is to put loopholes
[1:52:55.900 --> 1:53:00.820]  in the tax code that nobody understands, that so only they can utilize it. Because, again,
[1:53:00.820 --> 1:53:04.780]  it's two systems. They don't want you to take advantage of their loopholes because then
[1:53:04.780 --> 1:53:08.460]  you'll be part of their club. And they have the club and you're not part of it.
[1:53:08.460 --> 1:53:10.980]  So this is the ultimate robin at operation?
[1:53:10.980 --> 1:53:15.700]  Absolutely. Absolutely. Because right now, if you're in the middle class, if you're in
[1:53:15.700 --> 1:53:21.500]  the Nouveau-Riche, if you're making money, but you're not a globalist, okay, guess what?
[1:53:21.500 --> 1:53:22.500]  They're gonna rob you.
[1:53:22.500 --> 1:53:26.340]  They want you to be poor. They want you to be broke. They want you to be dependent on
[1:53:26.340 --> 1:53:30.620]  them. So when they take over the world, you will have no property and you'll be happy
[1:53:30.620 --> 1:53:34.660]  about it. So the name of the game here is keep the most amount of money in your pocket
[1:53:34.660 --> 1:53:35.660]  as possible.
[1:53:35.660 --> 1:53:40.060]  And again, I've just been explained, the money's all comes from monetization of debt and just
[1:53:40.060 --> 1:53:46.500]  QE 500, QE 1 million. They're just making it up. The income tax is all about controlling
[1:53:46.500 --> 1:53:47.500]  people.
[1:53:47.500 --> 1:53:53.380]  It is. It is. And the thing, there actually are provisions written into the internal revenue
[1:53:53.380 --> 1:53:57.900]  code to control people. It's how the United States, how the United States does public
[1:53:57.900 --> 1:54:03.220]  policy is they do it sneakily through the tax code. So they want people to have children.
[1:54:03.220 --> 1:54:06.340]  They say, hey, you can get a deduction for having kids. It's not about anything other
[1:54:06.340 --> 1:54:07.340]  than what they want.
[1:54:07.340 --> 1:54:09.340]  And that's why the Liberals want to get rid of that.
[1:54:09.340 --> 1:54:14.660]  Yeah, exactly. Because they know that that's promoting bigger families.
[1:54:14.660 --> 1:54:18.500]  How much does that make the left mad that G.G. Ping said, we're not going to kill your
[1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:21.620]  second kid. We're going to pay you to have three. That's really made them mad. That's
[1:54:21.620 --> 1:54:25.540]  when George Soros said, destroy the Chinese. I'm not saying G.G. Ping's good, but he went
[1:54:25.540 --> 1:54:29.540]  from pure evil to like one click, like, you know, let's not kill our babies. That's a
[1:54:29.540 --> 1:54:32.900]  big click, you know, back to good. I mean, let's be honest.
[1:54:32.900 --> 1:54:34.140]  Step in the right direction.
[1:54:34.140 --> 1:54:37.460]  Big step in the right direction. So you had another couple horror stories here you wanted
[1:54:37.460 --> 1:54:38.460]  to tell.
[1:54:38.460 --> 1:54:41.740]  Yes. Here's another one that comes up again and again. And let me just practice this by
[1:54:41.740 --> 1:54:46.860]  saying this, you know, when we talk about taxes and owing taxes, there's the IRS. And
[1:54:46.860 --> 1:54:51.500]  but there's also the state, right? And the state, especially since this pandemic has
[1:54:51.500 --> 1:54:56.580]  become so aggressive because they don't have the ability to print off money like the Fed
[1:54:56.580 --> 1:54:58.420]  does. They need money.
[1:54:58.420 --> 1:55:02.340]  And so that's key. The bankers get all the money they want at the top. The state's desperate.
[1:55:02.340 --> 1:55:07.620]  The state is desperate for money and they will come after you with the claws of a tiger.
[1:55:07.620 --> 1:55:12.860]  Okay. And so here's what I have seen happen is, let's say I have a business in the state.
[1:55:12.860 --> 1:55:16.900]  I've seen this happen multiple times. Either the IRS or the state will come up and say,
[1:55:16.900 --> 1:55:21.940]  hey, because you haven't paid taxes, we're going to close your business down. And the
[1:55:21.940 --> 1:55:27.300]  business owner will say to me, this is my only source of income. So so literally, even
[1:55:27.300 --> 1:55:32.780]  though debtor's prison was abolished, you know, 100 years ago, it's the same thing.
[1:55:32.780 --> 1:55:34.140]  Now they just put you on the street.
[1:55:34.140 --> 1:55:37.580]  Exactly. Don't go to jail. We don't want to. They don't want to feed you. Just kick you
[1:55:37.580 --> 1:55:41.460]  on the street. You're not allowed to do business anymore or make you go live with your family
[1:55:41.460 --> 1:55:42.460]  in that break. Yeah.
[1:55:42.460 --> 1:55:46.060]  And if anybody has told you that, give us a call right now. We can put that to a stop
[1:55:46.060 --> 1:55:48.940]  because they are violating your rights by doing that. Yeah. Well, you've been thinking
[1:55:48.940 --> 1:55:52.980]  about taking passports away and you can knock that out. That's unconstitutional. Yes, it
[1:55:52.980 --> 1:55:57.380]  is unconstitutional. They will do it. They don't care. They will take your passport away.
[1:55:57.380 --> 1:56:01.540]  But because it's unconstitutional, we can get ahold of the state department, go over
[1:56:01.540 --> 1:56:06.620]  the IRS's head and get it back. I've had clients that have called me in the ninth inning to
[1:56:06.620 --> 1:56:12.260]  go to a wedding in Europe and he's the groom, but they took his passport and we were able
[1:56:12.260 --> 1:56:15.340]  to get it back. And again, don't feel bad. Folks, you know, all this, neither do I study
[1:56:15.340 --> 1:56:18.540]  it all the time. I still don't know at all. No experts like this understand it. But I
[1:56:18.540 --> 1:56:22.300]  don't understand a lot of it. It's just the point is their experts, they have the blueprints.
[1:56:22.300 --> 1:56:25.660]  The enemy has the blueprint. They're not going to tell you how to get out of the maze. This
[1:56:25.660 --> 1:56:30.940]  guy is right. Absolutely right. Alex is is they have set up this system to where the
[1:56:30.940 --> 1:56:36.380]  average layperson is if they even attempt to learn this stuff, they're going to become
[1:56:36.380 --> 1:56:40.060]  more confused than when they started because that's how it's written. But they know the
[1:56:40.060 --> 1:56:45.460]  rule. They know the actual rule book and they have it out to get the middle class. But we
[1:56:45.460 --> 1:56:51.020]  know the rules to and we will use the actual code against them. And they come to Jesus
[1:56:51.020 --> 1:56:55.740]  quick. They agree with you. That's why it's done. You make an agreement. 100% Alex, because
[1:56:55.740 --> 1:57:02.220]  we have attorneys that make legal determinations to the IRS. When the IRS makes their determination,
[1:57:02.220 --> 1:57:06.100]  it's not from an attorney. It's from a clerk, like we said. And so they have to bring that
[1:57:06.100 --> 1:57:10.900]  to legal who then, of course, reads the actual law and realizes, of course, we're right.
[1:57:10.900 --> 1:57:15.020]  The rights were violated of the taxpayer and they changed their tune real quick. Jones

[1:57:35.580 --> 1:57:41.140]  I'm told, all right, you got more to talk about on there info wars dot com tomorrow's
[1:57:41.140 --> 1:57:54.140]  news today. Adam McGinnis straight ahead anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability,
[1:57:54.140 --> 1:57:58.300]  anything that's really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[1:57:58.300 --> 1:58:04.020]  And when it comes to information, boy, is that true today. We see the entire global corrupt
[1:58:04.020 --> 1:58:11.260]  into a human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to collapse our society to build on
[1:58:11.260 --> 1:58:17.380]  tashes. They're they're transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people
[1:58:17.380 --> 1:58:23.700]  all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives,
[1:58:23.700 --> 1:58:28.820]  their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030 carbon tax, global warming
[1:58:28.820 --> 1:58:34.820]  bull, all of it. And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless
[1:58:34.820 --> 1:58:40.820]  everybody is silenced and gas lit. That's why truth comes with hard work and the research
[1:58:40.820 --> 1:58:44.740]  of diligence. And that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band up video
[1:58:44.740 --> 1:58:48.980]  links. That's why we've got to share them now more than ever. The first 10 amendments
[1:58:48.980 --> 1:58:54.740]  to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791. The first of these broadly protects
[1:58:54.740 --> 1:59:00.860]  the rights of free speech and free press. Free speech means the free and public expression
[1:59:00.860 --> 1:59:08.060]  of opinions without censorship, interference and restraint by the government. 231 years
[1:59:08.060 --> 1:59:14.860]  later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack. GCN is under
[1:59:14.860 --> 1:59:20.100]  attack. Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the
[1:59:20.100 --> 1:59:25.740]  truth. I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and help us defend our
[1:59:25.740 --> 1:59:31.580]  right to continue telling you the truth. Would you like to join us? If so, please consider

[2:00:01.900 --> 2:00:05.740]  Final segment with Tyler Bennett who flew here from Los Angeles. They've got offices
[2:00:05.740 --> 2:00:10.180]  across the country. Incredible. I visited them. Amazing. I mean, these people are the
[2:00:10.180 --> 2:00:15.780]  real deal. They cut right to the chase. They put their name on it. They certify it and
[2:00:15.780 --> 2:00:20.660]  that means they are the ones that are vouching for you and liable for it. That is key. That's
[2:00:20.660 --> 2:00:23.940]  what the other lawyers, the other corrupt CPAs, there are a lot of good ones, a lot of bad
[2:00:23.940 --> 2:00:29.420]  ones won't do. These folks are great. JonesTaxRelief.com takes you right to the great folks at American
[2:00:29.420 --> 2:00:34.660]  Tax Solutions. In closing, Tyler Bennett, you've got a rant for folks. You've got some
[2:00:34.660 --> 2:00:40.300]  key things to tell people. I do, Alex. See, there's two truisms about the IRS and taxes
[2:00:40.300 --> 2:00:45.380]  that everyone should know. The first one, and you might have heard this and catch me
[2:00:45.380 --> 2:00:52.060]  if you can with Leonardo DiCaprio. The IRS only knows what you or somebody else tell
[2:00:52.060 --> 2:00:56.100]  them. Typically, that's your employer or if you're an independent contractor, the person
[2:00:56.100 --> 2:01:02.580]  writing you off. That's why they want to go after, they are starting to go to eBay, Etsy,
[2:01:02.580 --> 2:01:08.740]  all these resellers is so that they're telling them to. Because even though they can close
[2:01:08.740 --> 2:01:14.220]  the tax gap by taxing the globalists, their proper share, they want to get it out of the
[2:01:14.220 --> 2:01:18.340]  middle class because we already know they're out to take all your money.
[2:01:18.340 --> 2:01:23.380]  The second truism in taxes that this is always true, and keep in mind, and we will use this
[2:01:23.380 --> 2:01:29.340]  concept to your benefit, is deferral is always a win. What does deferral mean? That means
[2:01:29.340 --> 2:01:35.140]  paying your taxes as late as possible without incurring penalties and interest. Why is that
[2:01:35.140 --> 2:01:40.580]  a win? It's because the dollar is worth less and less every single day. And that was true
[2:01:40.580 --> 2:01:44.740]  in the 90s, but it's even farther true now with inflation hitting rockets at the levels.
[2:01:44.740 --> 2:01:48.900]  Oh, absolutely. Sorry. Yeah, with inflation, my goodness. You've got to push it off. There's
[2:01:48.900 --> 2:01:55.660]  a year's like 20, 30% inflation now. Right. It's insane. And so it's like, look, the longer
[2:01:55.660 --> 2:02:00.980]  you can delay that, obviously it means when you pay that five years from now instead of
[2:02:00.980 --> 2:02:04.900]  right now, you're paying less in tax. And you guys will advise people that are more
[2:02:04.900 --> 2:02:09.820]  wealthy or whatever on real estate to parlay it and beat inflation. Listen, if you have
[2:02:09.820 --> 2:02:18.420]  money, there are a multitude of things, trust instruments, corporations. Listen, even if
[2:02:18.420 --> 2:02:21.580]  you're a small business owner at all, you need to give me a call so we can get you in
[2:02:21.580 --> 2:02:30.540]  a corporate setup. Since the 2017 tax and jobs cut act TCJ, the best vehicle to be in
[2:02:30.540 --> 2:02:35.420]  and to pay the least amount of taxes is a C corporation. Okay. And so that's how we
[2:02:35.420 --> 2:02:39.340]  can save you lots of money. We can put you on payroll of your own business. You can take
[2:02:39.340 --> 2:02:43.380]  the and again, you cut the fake complexity. As you already know it, these other lawyers
[2:02:43.380 --> 2:02:46.940]  will be at you and have meetings and say, they got to assess your business. It's all
[2:02:46.940 --> 2:02:51.780]  lies. Folks are just milking you. Absolutely. It really doesn't matter what your business
[2:02:51.780 --> 2:02:56.220]  is. At the end of the day, there's only four types of entities, right? You're a sole proprietor.
[2:02:56.220 --> 2:03:01.220]  You're an LLC or an S Corp. You're a C Corp. Okay. And they're all flow throughs except
[2:03:01.220 --> 2:03:06.340]  one. And there's only one that pays a flat tax rate. And that's a C Corp. And it's a
[2:03:06.340 --> 2:03:14.020]  very lower percent, 21% me and you Alex pay 37. That's right. Why the hell? Yeah. Yeah.
[2:03:14.020 --> 2:03:18.260]  This will be a few years ago. Like, why aren't we a C Corp? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. And there
[2:03:18.260 --> 2:03:23.620]  are so many tips and tricks that you can use loopholes that you can use with C Corp because
[2:03:23.620 --> 2:03:31.260]  in in section C of the internal revenue code, that's also in, you know, that Apple is a
[2:03:31.260 --> 2:03:36.500]  C Corp, right? Amazon's a C Corp. So there is so much lobbies to keep those exactly.
[2:03:36.500 --> 2:03:40.180]  They've written it all for themselves. Exactly. And we show Hey, this guy'll tell you how
[2:03:40.180 --> 2:03:44.100]  to do what Apple did. Exactly. You're not running slave camps in China. You're morally
[2:03:44.100 --> 2:03:49.180]  not paying money for wars. Right. Absolutely. And remember, none of the money goes to run
[2:03:49.180 --> 2:03:54.140]  the country folks. So don't feel guilty that you're not paying it. It's all fraud. Listen,
[2:03:54.140 --> 2:03:59.060]  it doesn't matter what they call a tax, the government can spend whatever the money they
[2:03:59.060 --> 2:04:05.940]  get on whatever they want, which is apparently a war in Ukraine and entitlements, you know.
[2:04:05.940 --> 2:04:10.500]  So I'm impressed and I'm just glad I called you guys. Wow. It's been a real blessing
[2:04:10.500 --> 2:04:13.420]  to like I only call like four or five people I thought would be great. They've all are
[2:04:13.420 --> 2:04:17.940]  turning into sponsors. This is just the site guys. It's so beautiful. Jones tax relief
[2:04:17.940 --> 2:04:23.500]  dot com a three three nine zero zero four two eight five. Tyler Bennett. Thank you so much
[2:04:23.500 --> 2:04:27.500]  for all you do at American Tax Solutions. Thanks, Alex. Glad to be on the show. And
[2:04:27.500 --> 2:04:30.660]  I want to meet your mom and I'll meet your girlfriend that came with you. I saw him earlier
[2:04:30.660 --> 2:04:34.140]  going in there. They're great sitting there for hours. We really appreciate it. Absolutely.
[2:04:34.140 --> 2:04:38.980]  And again, it's takes over right now. Thank you so much, brother. I know you're helping
[2:04:38.980 --> 2:04:43.540]  Oh, we forgot to ask you how much have you already saved people that have just called
[2:04:43.540 --> 2:04:50.100]  the last few weeks? Okay, so in the last few weeks alone, we've saved over $5 million.
[2:04:50.100 --> 2:04:55.540]  In the last few years, we've saved closer to $200 million for the taxpayer. Beautiful,
[2:04:55.540 --> 2:05:04.380]  beautiful. The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical
[2:05:04.380 --> 2:05:11.900]  tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for
[2:05:11.900 --> 2:05:17.900]  permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[2:05:17.900 --> 2:05:23.340]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[2:05:23.340 --> 2:05:29.060]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[2:05:29.060 --> 2:05:35.500]  that it is a world government corporate takeover. And so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[2:05:35.500 --> 2:05:41.020]  than ever. The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[2:05:41.020 --> 2:05:47.820]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other areas
[2:05:47.820 --> 2:05:52.420]  of the world are following suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time. It's a very
[2:05:52.420 --> 2:05:57.420]  serious situation. And stay tuned to infowars.com because truth is absolutely bare mountain.
[2:06:22.420 --> 2:06:32.180]  We saw the announcement last week. Facebook said that you're allowed to call for violence
[2:06:32.180 --> 2:06:40.260]  against Russians, period. And then we saw the headlines that German hospitals were denying
[2:06:40.260 --> 2:06:45.300]  Russians health care. Whether you love Vladimir Putin or hate Vladimir Putin or you're neutral
[2:06:45.300 --> 2:06:55.660]  like I am. Do you want to deny Russians health care? Do you want to make top ballerinas and
[2:06:55.660 --> 2:07:05.060]  top pianist and top violinist and top conductors pledge that they hate Putin and want nuclear
[2:07:05.060 --> 2:07:09.300]  war basically or they're fired because that's been happening. This is what McCarthy only
[2:07:09.300 --> 2:07:14.580]  dreamed of. And why do I raise that right now with the great gab McGinnis joining us?
[2:07:14.580 --> 2:07:20.740]  Because three years ago, four years ago, I was banned everywhere. But a year later, they
[2:07:20.740 --> 2:07:25.900]  were banning him so hard that the headlines were you're allowed to call for violence against
[2:07:25.900 --> 2:07:32.860]  Gavin McGinnis. And then a week later, they put 10 more names on the list myself. Paul
[2:07:32.860 --> 2:07:39.220]  Joseph Watson, Lewis Farrakhan, a few others. So when we saw that, that was the headlines.
[2:07:39.220 --> 2:07:45.940]  It was surreal. But here we are, ladies and gentlemen, a few years later, English born,
[2:07:45.940 --> 2:07:51.300]  Canadian writer, actor, comedian and serial entrepreneur, the founder of vice and so much
[2:07:51.300 --> 2:07:57.660]  more censored dot TV. And he's got a bunch of other really, really exciting programs.
[2:07:57.660 --> 2:08:06.220]  He does like get off my lawn. He joins us now to discuss the waterfront and everything
[2:08:06.220 --> 2:08:11.300]  that's happening and this purge of the military and the police departments and the fire departments
[2:08:11.300 --> 2:08:17.300]  and what they're doing once they do the purge, the same model as the South African communist
[2:08:17.300 --> 2:08:22.500]  takeover that's now quadruple crime and poverty in that country. So Gavin, it's great to have
[2:08:22.500 --> 2:08:28.380]  you here, my friend, a true icon this fight. What should we tackle first, the cancel culture,
[2:08:28.380 --> 2:08:35.340]  the takeover of the police and fire departments and leftist cities, the war in Ukraine. I
[2:08:35.340 --> 2:08:42.340]  mean, there's so much to hit here.
[2:08:42.340 --> 2:08:54.580]  All right, Gavin, it's so fun to do these live shows because occasionally you're going
[2:08:54.580 --> 2:08:59.340]  to have issues. So we're going to go back to Gavin in just a minute. You know, this
[2:08:59.340 --> 2:09:04.220]  Greg Rees report is just really, really incredibly important, ladies and gentlemen. And I'm really,
[2:09:04.220 --> 2:09:09.580]  really proud of this report he's done. So let's go ahead and air that Greg Rees report
[2:09:09.580 --> 2:09:17.980]  and we'll be right back.
[2:09:17.980 --> 2:09:23.540]  The first nation to successfully weaponize and mass produce deadly pathogens was Great
[2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:30.220]  Britain during the start of World War Two, soon followed by the United States, Germany,
[2:09:30.220 --> 2:09:37.700]  France and Japan. While many nations mass produced them, Japan was notorious for deploying
[2:09:37.700 --> 2:09:43.700]  biological weapons, killing almost a half a million Chinese soldiers and civilians in
[2:09:43.700 --> 2:09:50.180]  several military campaigns, including the 1940 bombing of Ningbo, China, when Japan's
[2:09:50.180 --> 2:09:57.780]  secret bio weapons unit 731 dropped ceramic bombs full of living fleas carrying the bubonic
[2:09:57.780 --> 2:10:04.980]  plague. German pharmaceutical company, IG Farben Bayer, conducted fatal human experiments
[2:10:04.980 --> 2:10:13.780]  on prisoners and killed over a million people with its cyanide based Zyclon B. The US established
[2:10:13.780 --> 2:10:20.900]  their own bio weapons program at Fort Detrick, Maryland in 1942. And by the end of the war,
[2:10:20.900 --> 2:10:27.220]  brand new facilities were completed for mass production of anthrax and other bio weapons.
[2:10:27.220 --> 2:10:32.100]  After the war, the directors of IG Farben were punished at the Nuremberg trials, but
[2:10:32.100 --> 2:10:38.660]  the scientists were secretly absorbed into America's bio weapons program. Japan was
[2:10:38.660 --> 2:10:44.260]  planning to attack the city of San Diego, California with weaponized plague, but they
[2:10:44.260 --> 2:10:50.620]  surrendered three weeks prior to the scheduled attack. And while Japanese researchers arrested
[2:10:50.620 --> 2:10:56.700]  by Soviet forces were tried for war crimes, those captured by the United States were secretly
[2:10:56.700 --> 2:11:03.820]  given immunity in exchange for working with the US bio weapons team. Long after World
[2:11:03.820 --> 2:11:11.140]  War Two, the US bio weapons program continued to expand with the help of Japanese and German
[2:11:11.140 --> 2:11:18.900]  war criminals. And in 1969, the US government officially terminated their offensive biological
[2:11:18.900 --> 2:11:25.260]  weapons program, continuing on with a defensive biological weapons program, which was nothing
[2:11:25.260 --> 2:11:31.980]  more than a change of language ahead of the biological weapons convention in 1972. The
[2:11:31.980 --> 2:11:38.340]  US would continue to experiment with and produce deadly pathogens, but now under the guise
[2:11:38.340 --> 2:11:46.140]  of defense and mostly defense against Russia. Of all the nations involved in bio weapons
[2:11:46.140 --> 2:11:52.620]  research, Russia factors in very little. The US government claims that the Soviet Union
[2:11:52.620 --> 2:11:59.900]  had the biggest bio weapons program in history, but this is based solely on a mysterious 1979
[2:11:59.900 --> 2:12:06.500]  anthrax leak and the lone testimony of Soviet defector Ken Alebeck, who has also been absorbed
[2:12:06.500 --> 2:12:12.420]  into the US bio weapons program and who has helped the US surround Russia with dangerous
[2:12:12.420 --> 2:12:18.700]  bio weapons labs. Russia is now releasing confiscated documents of the work that was
[2:12:18.700 --> 2:12:24.620]  being conducted in the NATO backed bio labs they have secured in Ukraine. These labs were
[2:12:24.620 --> 2:12:31.660]  allegedly developing genetically engineered bio weapons to target specific Slavic people
[2:12:31.660 --> 2:12:39.100]  and experimenting with ways of spreading pathogens via bats, ticks, lice and fleas like the work
[2:12:39.100 --> 2:12:46.740]  Japan's unit 731 was doing before being secretly brought into the US. Meanwhile, Bill Gates
[2:12:46.740 --> 2:12:52.260]  is currently allowed to release hundreds of millions of genetically modified mosquitoes
[2:12:52.260 --> 2:12:59.140]  within the United States as some sort of disease control experiment. You can say what you want
[2:12:59.140 --> 2:13:04.340]  about Vladimir Putin and Russia, but they aren't the ones waging war against the people
[2:13:04.340 --> 2:13:10.340]  of the West. That would be the world economic forum, the big banks and their lackeys of
[2:13:10.340 --> 2:13:17.660]  the great reset agenda. After the US government sanctioned all the Russian people, Putin responded
[2:13:17.660 --> 2:13:23.860]  by only targeting a few known criminals of the great reset cabal, as if sending a message
[2:13:23.860 --> 2:13:31.300]  to the Americans that we share the same enemies. Whereas the global elites are working towards
[2:13:31.300 --> 2:13:38.940]  destroying the nation states, Russia is reinventing the nation state. Russia hopes to be the world's
[2:13:38.940 --> 2:13:44.980]  biggest producer of organic farming. While the globalists are pushing for genetically
[2:13:44.980 --> 2:13:52.700]  modified foods, bugs and synthetic meat, the globalists are actively destroying the family
[2:13:52.700 --> 2:13:58.940]  down to the mother's womb. While Russia seeks to build a society based on family and
[2:13:58.940 --> 2:14:08.260]  the family's
[2:14:08.260 --> 2:14:12.740]  of problems fixed. Wow. What do you want to get into first when we come back, my friend?
[2:14:12.740 --> 2:14:17.780]  What is front and center on your radar? You know, a long time ago, Ezra Levant told
[2:14:17.780 --> 2:14:23.460]  me he said, I like to go to Britain because it's a dystopian time machine and I can see
[2:14:23.460 --> 2:14:29.380]  where we're going to be in five years. And Britain has had their police force totally
[2:14:29.380 --> 2:14:34.780]  castrated. It's all affirmative action and rainbows and refugees are welcome. Crime
[2:14:34.780 --> 2:14:40.420]  is rampant. Muslims run that country. And I'm seeing it here in America, not Muslims
[2:14:40.420 --> 2:14:47.340]  running the country, of course, but crime running rampant. And the NYPD is totally debauled.
[2:14:47.340 --> 2:14:53.300]  The new officers that are coming out today are completely useless, affirmative action
[2:14:53.300 --> 2:14:59.100]  hires. These these weak women with the fattest asses you've ever seen in your life. I don't
[2:14:59.100 --> 2:15:03.700]  know where they get their pants made. I think they're going to have to make NYPD sweat pants
[2:15:03.700 --> 2:15:08.780]  for these women. And they're inept. We're up to a murder a day here in New York. We're
[2:15:08.780 --> 2:15:14.220]  getting back to Dinkins, New York. And it's all because of this socialist affirmative
[2:15:14.220 --> 2:15:19.180]  action crap. I totally agree. And what is the end game? Why are they doing it? Gavin,
[2:15:19.180 --> 2:15:22.540]  I watch you all the time. I'm so glad you come on. It's been a while since you were
[2:15:22.540 --> 2:15:27.860]  on. We're going to break in 30 seconds. But where do people find everything? Gavin McInnes.
[2:15:27.860 --> 2:15:35.180]  I'm also on gab. I'm on telegram. I'm on getter. And you're a beautiful American. We'll be
[2:15:35.180 --> 2:15:40.380]  right back with Gavin McInnes on the other side of this quick break info wars dot com
[2:15:40.380 --> 2:15:59.220]  tomorrow's news today sensor dot TV. Another thought criminal channel. The powerful combination
[2:15:59.220 --> 2:16:05.180]  of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life. Info wars
[2:16:05.180 --> 2:16:09.140]  has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement that
[2:16:09.140 --> 2:16:14.740]  contains both. This info wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should
[2:16:14.740 --> 2:16:19.380]  be your next purchase from the info wars store. The rose hips contained within are a part
[2:16:19.380 --> 2:16:25.340]  of the rose flower just below the pedals that contain the rose plant seeds. Natural chemicals
[2:16:25.340 --> 2:16:30.060]  found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including
[2:16:30.060 --> 2:16:35.380]  those with osteo arthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown as for
[2:16:35.380 --> 2:16:39.620]  vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[2:16:39.620 --> 2:16:44.300]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has
[2:16:44.300 --> 2:16:49.540]  been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like
[2:16:49.540 --> 2:16:53.820]  here in America. So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at info wars store dot
[2:16:53.820 --> 2:17:00.500]  com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie. I am a worldly person, meaning I like
[2:17:00.500 --> 2:17:05.060]  going to ball games. I like going to concerts. I like going to play golf. I like going out
[2:17:05.060 --> 2:17:10.220]  to dinner. I like the metropolitan life. I like everything that comes with this. But
[2:17:10.220 --> 2:17:16.260]  see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat run cities,
[2:17:16.260 --> 2:17:20.860]  get the hell out of major metropolitan areas, because unless we change course soon, it's
[2:17:20.860 --> 2:17:25.140]  all crashing down. Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece
[2:17:25.140 --> 2:17:28.900]  of property in the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just
[2:17:28.900 --> 2:17:33.140]  live off the land? That's the survival instinct. But see the worldly part of me that's still
[2:17:33.140 --> 2:17:37.940]  probably the majority part of me says no, no, no, no, stay in the city. The survival instinct
[2:17:37.940 --> 2:17:41.260]  says get the hell out of anywhere they've ever notion that you need to get a vaccine
[2:17:41.260 --> 2:17:46.060]  or a mask. That's the that's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in
[2:17:46.060 --> 2:17:51.740]  the audience are facing as well. But you can at least have some comfort if you have the
[2:17:51.740 --> 2:17:57.420]  emergency food supplies. And so we have the best ones at info wars store dot com. Mike
[2:17:57.420 --> 2:18:01.100]  in California. Thanks for calling. I think we're barking up the wrong tree, calling
[2:18:01.100 --> 2:18:07.220]  this gain of function research. Now, if you read the actual 2014 legislation, the US government
[2:18:07.220 --> 2:18:12.660]  gain of function, deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of
[2:18:12.660 --> 2:18:17.460]  function research involving influenza, MERS and SARS viruses does nothing about SARS like
[2:18:17.460 --> 2:18:22.500]  viruses. And it's a research funding pause. It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition.
[2:18:22.500 --> 2:18:26.180]  It's when you come to a four way intersection, there's the stops on you stop, you look both
[2:18:26.180 --> 2:18:30.780]  ways and then you proceed. And so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function, just
[2:18:30.780 --> 2:18:35.180]  selected gain of function. But they'll argue that this is actually characterization and
[2:18:35.180 --> 2:18:39.700]  qualification research. So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right.
[2:18:39.700 --> 2:18:42.820]  They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function. You know,
[2:18:42.820 --> 2:18:45.980]  that's why he didn't perjure himself. That's why he hasn't been arrested because they're
[2:18:45.980 --> 2:18:50.300]  literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do. But in the
[2:18:50.300 --> 2:18:54.500]  main definition, it's still a gain of function. You're making something deadly that spreads
[2:18:54.500 --> 2:18:59.420]  more easily to hurt people. Thank you, Mike. We love you. Sleepless nights seem to be a
[2:18:59.420 --> 2:19:04.460]  lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world
[2:19:04.460 --> 2:19:09.220]  at large. If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more

[2:19:36.780 --> 2:19:42.020]  the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally used
[2:19:42.020 --> 2:19:47.500]  by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities. Be sure

[2:19:58.700 --> 2:20:05.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:05.700 --> 2:20:15.700]  It's so easy to blow up the problems. It's so easy to play up the breakdown.
[2:20:15.700 --> 2:20:21.860]  The global fascists using a model of communism have a plan to take over all the major cities
[2:20:21.860 --> 2:20:29.860]  of the world and install their leftist minions. And Gavin McEnnis is the icon of researching
[2:20:29.860 --> 2:20:35.380]  this sensor.tv. He was just getting into what's happening in the blue cities. Similar programs
[2:20:35.380 --> 2:20:39.620]  have been done in Europe as the beta test and where he sees this going. Gavin, break
[2:20:39.620 --> 2:20:44.420]  down these horrifying developments for us.
[2:20:44.420 --> 2:20:50.320]  Well what's happening is they are replacing all of the top brass at the NYPD with affirmative
[2:20:50.320 --> 2:20:55.260]  action hires. And if you criticize this, you're racist. They say, oh, you have a problem with
[2:20:55.260 --> 2:21:01.820]  blacks and women taking over the FDMY and the NYPD. And you go, no, if it was albinos
[2:21:01.820 --> 2:21:07.740]  or Amish, I'd have the same problem. You chose a random group and has said this group has
[2:21:07.740 --> 2:21:12.700]  to take over. And they're not being hired for their expertise. They're being hired for
[2:21:12.700 --> 2:21:18.660]  their race. And the mayor is one of these guys. He was a transit cop who was a member
[2:21:18.660 --> 2:21:23.580]  of, I think it's called a hundred black officers or something like that. He was constantly
[2:21:23.580 --> 2:21:29.660]  suing the city for racism. And every time things didn't go his way, he sued and filed
[2:21:29.660 --> 2:21:34.020]  a complaint. And the next thing you know, he's the mayor of the city hiring his brother
[2:21:34.020 --> 2:21:40.900]  now. His brother is the head of the crime fighting division that he chose for him. He's
[2:21:40.900 --> 2:21:41.900]  hiring all of us.
[2:21:41.900 --> 2:21:46.020]  By the way, he ran, just to interrupt you on not hiring family members, but gave a special
[2:21:46.020 --> 2:21:51.420]  dispensation for himself saying because of racism, he needs his brother. He can't trust
[2:21:51.420 --> 2:21:57.100]  the other police. Wow. He's leading the police and can't trust white cops or Hispanic cops
[2:21:57.100 --> 2:22:00.380]  or black cops to protecting.
[2:22:00.380 --> 2:22:05.740]  They're all the same as Juicy Smule. They have the same mentality. Remember, Jesse, when
[2:22:05.740 --> 2:22:11.100]  he got his sentence, he goes, that's racist. We go, Jesse, you're being prosecuted for
[2:22:11.100 --> 2:22:16.820]  calling everything racist, you boob. Okay, then that's racist. And you go, no, I'm sick
[2:22:16.820 --> 2:22:22.220]  of this ending the conversation. We need to check in the new officers again. I know these
[2:22:22.220 --> 2:22:26.660]  guys in the 52nd precinct, right? They're detectives and they're being stalked by this
[2:22:26.660 --> 2:22:31.940]  lunatic who has, I don't know where he got this, but he has a sheriff uniform with a
[2:22:31.940 --> 2:22:36.420]  drop holster and a gun and everything. And he goes to the 52nd precinct the other day
[2:22:36.420 --> 2:22:42.180]  and he goes, Hey, is the detective Nelson and McGill in here? And they go, no. And he
[2:22:42.180 --> 2:22:47.380]  goes, Oh, okay, well, I'll come back later. And they go, okay, bye. This guy's wearing
[2:22:47.380 --> 2:22:52.900]  a fake uniform with a gun that's not registered him to him. But because he's polite and likely
[2:22:52.900 --> 2:22:57.300]  because he's black, the officers went, okay, bye. So the detectives call and they go, where'd
[2:22:57.300 --> 2:23:00.740]  you let that where'd he go? And they go, we don't know. We just said bye to him. So the
[2:23:00.740 --> 2:23:05.660]  detectives have to come in and go arrest him because he was there to kill them. Now that's
[2:23:05.660 --> 2:23:11.220]  just one little tiny anecdote, but it shows you the totally feckless police force we're
[2:23:11.220 --> 2:23:16.140]  dealing with now in New York City. Well, they hide the ball to left become mentally. I asked
[2:23:16.140 --> 2:23:19.700]  you like six years ago, what's peak leftist? You said, Oh, I think it's gonna get a lot
[2:23:19.700 --> 2:23:23.860]  worse. It's created a bunch of mentally ill, crazy people that are taught to hate different
[2:23:23.860 --> 2:23:27.540]  groups because of what color they are. And then you put in a bunch of George Soros prosecutors
[2:23:27.540 --> 2:23:31.500]  and police chiefs that won't prosecute. And then they just let these armies of zombies
[2:23:31.500 --> 2:23:35.380]  go around destroy civilization. And when it collapses, the big central banks come in and
[2:23:35.380 --> 2:23:43.820]  take over. They are hiring racists too. Like these dispatchers, these fat black dispatchers
[2:23:43.820 --> 2:23:50.420]  in the Bronx, they don't like cops. They don't, they don't enjoy their job. They go on Facebook.
[2:23:50.420 --> 2:23:54.740]  And I say to other cops, I go, this bitch was just on Facebook posting BLM stuff and
[2:23:54.740 --> 2:23:58.900]  they go, yeah, can't do anything about it. She's an affirmative action hire. We'll get
[2:23:58.900 --> 2:24:03.860]  fired if we complain. So we just let her go. They've all given up. None of them want their
[2:24:03.860 --> 2:24:08.540]  kids to be cops anymore. And so what is the end effect are the globalist wanting? What
[2:24:08.540 --> 2:24:12.740]  is the end effect? Is it the current effect exploding crime? We know that and then Biden
[2:24:12.740 --> 2:24:22.940]  tries to deny it. The end game is South Africa. But instead of race, it is political affiliation.
[2:24:22.940 --> 2:24:27.540]  You know, that by using the word racist, they depersonize and in Britain, they were talking
[2:24:27.540 --> 2:24:32.340]  about not giving racist healthcare. And at first glance, you go, Oh, okay, I don't care
[2:24:32.340 --> 2:24:37.500]  if Hitler can't get a triple bypass. But then you go, wait a minute, what defines a racist?
[2:24:37.500 --> 2:24:41.420]  And you realize it's just being right wing. It's being a Trump supporter. Well, yeah,
[2:24:41.420 --> 2:24:46.020]  Biden's new perspective is put out of June of last year, says questioning elections,
[2:24:46.020 --> 2:24:52.740]  questioning lockdowns, questioning open borders is terrorist and it's white supremacy. Yes.
[2:24:52.740 --> 2:24:58.660]  And what did Merrick say? The DA, he said, it's white supremacy is the number one threat
[2:24:58.660 --> 2:25:03.460]  to this country. Now I looked up the numbers. There's about three deaths a year related
[2:25:03.460 --> 2:25:09.460]  to white supremacy. Jihadists are responsible for about six deaths a year. But the real
[2:25:09.460 --> 2:25:14.980]  threat to this country is this fascist dictatorship where we're getting, we're getting into like
[2:25:14.980 --> 2:25:21.540]  shoot the ball, shoot to kill. And soon we're going to have these these Soros appointed DA's
[2:25:21.540 --> 2:25:26.860]  police firemen deciding who gets what services. And the next thing you know, it's like South
[2:25:26.860 --> 2:25:30.620]  Africa where there's these squatter camps. Now they've decided white people are evil.
[2:25:30.620 --> 2:25:33.940]  So they're sent to squatter camps. They're going to decide you and I are evil. I mean,
[2:25:33.940 --> 2:25:39.260]  we're at the forefront of this, by the way. No, you're right. So, so is anybody fighting
[2:25:39.260 --> 2:25:45.820]  back in these police departments being taken over by the globalist left? Yes, there's Alex
[2:25:45.820 --> 2:25:52.300]  Jones over at info wars. There's Gavin McKinnis at censored die TV. Laura Loomer, by the way,
[2:25:52.300 --> 2:25:56.140]  who was banned when you and I were banned and was and Facebook said you can threaten their
[2:25:56.140 --> 2:26:03.260]  lives. She's kicking ass now. She's got a real shot at Congress over by Orlando, that
[2:26:03.260 --> 2:26:09.260]  district that she's running in. James O'Keefe is kicking ass. He's on fire these days. And
[2:26:09.260 --> 2:26:13.580]  we we're getting a lot of guys from the left because the left has gone so woke and they
[2:26:13.580 --> 2:26:17.740]  see this. And if they're logical and honest with themselves, they go, what's going on
[2:26:17.740 --> 2:26:22.100]  here? Trevor Noah of all people. Yeah, what do you make of him if I get that clip from
[2:26:22.100 --> 2:26:26.420]  last week I ever played where it comes out endorses Trump as a better president against
[2:26:26.420 --> 2:26:32.900]  Putin. He endorsed Trump and he recently was talking about the Vax and he brought up the
[2:26:32.900 --> 2:26:38.340]  logical point, which is how can a basketball player not be allowed on the court as a player?
[2:26:38.340 --> 2:26:42.500]  Yet he can buy tickets, watch the game and then go hug his teammates at the end of the
[2:26:42.500 --> 2:26:48.300]  game. That doesn't seem logical. That's a thought crime. He's engaging in logic. Yeah,
[2:26:48.300 --> 2:26:54.660]  well, this is the problem with the left. When they they dare go near curiosity, they start
[2:26:54.660 --> 2:26:59.220]  drinking that juice and they get that red pill down their gullet. And next thing you
[2:26:59.220 --> 2:27:05.780]  know, they're they're unwoke, they're awake. And it's inevitable. Look at what's his name,
[2:27:05.780 --> 2:27:10.540]  the Russell brand. He said, wait a minute, why is everyone calling people they don't
[2:27:10.540 --> 2:27:17.140]  like right wing? It's becoming a moniker that means don't listen to that Giza. And now the
[2:27:17.140 --> 2:27:21.220]  Guardian is trying to cancel him for daring to notice that.
[2:27:21.220 --> 2:27:26.580]  Well, that's right. And he's a classical liberal. I mean, he's just promoting freedom and look
[2:27:26.580 --> 2:27:33.780]  out how far Joe Rogan's come. Yeah, Joe Rogan is and he's still like everyone talks about
[2:27:33.780 --> 2:27:38.740]  Joe Rogan going right. No, Joe Rogan stayed pretty straight and narrow. It's the background
[2:27:38.740 --> 2:27:44.380]  that changed. Like Bill Maher was talking about this on Ben Shapiro's show of all places.
[2:27:44.380 --> 2:27:48.700]  He was saying, I didn't change. And I would argue that you and I haven't changed either.
[2:27:48.700 --> 2:27:56.620]  I don't even see myself as particularly right wing. I would call you a classical liberal.
[2:27:56.620 --> 2:28:01.820]  They call they call me neo fascist, whatever the hell that means. But I just am a libertarian
[2:28:01.820 --> 2:28:07.140]  for close borders. I'm I'm socially liberal until you start getting kids and sex together.
[2:28:07.140 --> 2:28:10.860]  And then I start going away. What are you doing? Why are you telling my three year old
[2:28:10.860 --> 2:28:16.500]  what polyamorous means? But I think what's happening right now culturally is the left
[2:28:16.500 --> 2:28:24.140]  is going full bore communist lunatic, affirmative action, South African nut bar. And the rest
[2:28:24.140 --> 2:28:30.060]  of us and what they're doing is they're ostracizing the normies like this new Supreme Court chick,
[2:28:30.060 --> 2:28:36.460]  this black woman, I forget her name, Jackson. We just discovered yesterday that she's been
[2:28:36.460 --> 2:28:43.020]  incredibly lenient when it comes to pedophiles and usually giving them the minimum sentence
[2:28:43.020 --> 2:28:49.260]  for a kitty porn for rape for molesting children, gather again and stay there on fire. We're
[2:28:49.260 --> 2:28:59.220]  going to talk about this. That was in my stack straight ahead. Stay with us.
[2:28:59.220 --> 2:29:04.260]  Taking advantage of one of nature's most nutrient dense ingredients, vaso beats will be your
[2:29:04.260 --> 2:29:12.100]  new favorite infowars life formula. Using only water and beetroot, vaso beats is the most
[2:29:12.100 --> 2:29:19.740]  concentrated liquid extracts of heat on the market. With concentrated beat extract, you
[2:29:19.740 --> 2:29:24.980]  can get the high levels of the pain, nitrates and antioxidants you want to help support
[2:29:24.980 --> 2:29:30.740]  a healthy liver, athletic performance, blood vessels and more.
[2:29:30.740 --> 2:29:37.540]  Don't overlook the power of beetroot. Get your naturally occurring potassium, folate,
[2:29:37.540 --> 2:29:48.100]  vitamin C, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin K and more. With one of nature's greatest treasures
[2:29:48.100 --> 2:29:57.420]  in vaso beat from infowars life today.
[2:29:57.420 --> 2:30:03.860]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research. If you read
[2:30:03.860 --> 2:30:09.700]  the actual 2014 legislation, the U.S. government gain of function deliberative process and
[2:30:09.700 --> 2:30:14.940]  research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza, MERS
[2:30:14.940 --> 2:30:19.660]  and ZARS viruses. There's nothing about ZARS like viruses and if the research funding
[2:30:19.660 --> 2:30:24.540]  pause, it's not a stop, it's not a prohibition. When you come to a folate intersection, there's
[2:30:24.540 --> 2:30:29.500]  a stop sign, you stop, you look both ways and then you proceed and so it doesn't pause
[2:30:29.500 --> 2:30:33.460]  all gain of function, just selected gain of function. But they'll argue that this is
[2:30:33.460 --> 2:30:39.500]  actually characterization and qualification research. So Rand and others, maybe Fauci was
[2:30:39.500 --> 2:30:42.900]  right, they don't quite know what they're talking about, calling it gain of function.
[2:30:42.900 --> 2:30:45.940]  That's why he didn't perjure himself, that's why he hasn't been arrested.
[2:30:45.940 --> 2:30:50.140]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do.
[2:30:50.140 --> 2:30:54.140]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function. They're making something deadly
[2:30:54.140 --> 2:30:57.220]  that spreads more easily to hurt people. Thank you, Mike. We love you.
[2:30:57.220 --> 2:31:03.540]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training, probably not as much
[2:31:03.540 --> 2:31:07.820]  as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for InfowarsStore.com.
[2:31:07.820 --> 2:31:14.060]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need
[2:31:14.060 --> 2:31:18.940]  to get going. You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins
[2:31:18.940 --> 2:31:24.100]  I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acid
[2:31:24.100 --> 2:31:28.460]  for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training. And then
[2:31:28.460 --> 2:31:34.660]  every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' sore list. I have bad joints, thanks mom. So this
[2:31:34.660 --> 2:31:39.780]  is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support
[2:31:39.780 --> 2:31:44.900]  and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the
[2:31:44.900 --> 2:31:50.180]  training. Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, turbo force
[2:31:50.180 --> 2:31:54.620]  that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep
[2:32:20.260 --> 2:32:26.140]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly. With practically half the population
[2:32:26.140 --> 2:32:31.140]  wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the traders know they can shut us down by
[2:32:31.140 --> 2:32:37.860]  force. But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially. So be it. Make them silence
[2:32:37.860 --> 2:32:45.220]  us by force. This is the final battle of the information war. Give now, buy products,
[2:32:45.220 --> 2:32:51.500]  donate. Before everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end. Victory
[2:32:51.500 --> 2:33:01.820]  or death, go now to infowarstore.com Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New
[2:33:01.820 --> 2:33:29.580]  World Order. It's Alex Jones live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:29.580 --> 2:33:36.540]  It's Trevor Noah. Saudi Arabia isn't playing ball with Joe Biden. And you know what? You
[2:33:36.540 --> 2:33:44.260]  can say what you want. But this would have never happened to Donald Trump. Never. No
[2:33:44.260 --> 2:33:48.780]  one was ever ignoring Donald Trump's calls. Yeah, because if you ignored Donald Trump's
[2:33:48.780 --> 2:33:54.140]  calls, you didn't know how he would respond. Maybe he'd send an angry tweet. Or maybe he
[2:33:54.140 --> 2:33:58.580]  just like ban your country from everything. You don't know. That's why I bet in these
[2:33:58.580 --> 2:34:03.500]  situations, Biden actually wishes that he could hire Trump to step in as president wildcard.
[2:34:03.500 --> 2:34:07.300]  You know, just keep everyone on their toes. Because if Trump was calling, you best believe
[2:34:07.300 --> 2:34:11.140]  the UAE, they'll be racing to pick up the phone. Oh, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, we're here.
[2:34:11.140 --> 2:34:16.980]  We're here. Hello. Too late, Ahmed. You made me wait two rings. We're bombing the UAE and
[2:34:16.980 --> 2:34:22.620]  the UFC just in case. There is no denying that. Well, so finally, because I mean, Trevor
[2:34:22.620 --> 2:34:26.620]  Noah used to be funny till he became political. Finally, he's being funny. He got censored
[2:34:26.620 --> 2:34:31.460]  for saying, why do we got to take vaccines? They don't work. Seems like he's maybe finding
[2:34:31.460 --> 2:34:35.540]  his soul. So is Bill Maher. What is happening here, Gavin? And let's get back into what
[2:34:35.540 --> 2:34:42.500]  you were talking about. This Pito news with the new Supreme Court Justice nominee. Well,
[2:34:42.500 --> 2:34:46.940]  the Supreme Court, what's happening to Supreme Court is exactly what's happening in America.
[2:34:46.940 --> 2:34:52.660]  And it links to that Trevor Noah thing. The left has gone so far woke that they're ostracizing
[2:34:52.660 --> 2:34:58.340]  their own and they're losing liberals like Russell Brand, like Bill Maher, like Trevor
[2:34:58.340 --> 2:35:04.140]  Noah to their radical leftist politics. And this is happening. The Supreme Court before
[2:35:04.140 --> 2:35:09.380]  when you had Breyer on the Supreme Court, the guy that retired, he was a moderate and
[2:35:09.380 --> 2:35:17.540]  he would pull in Roberts and Kavanaugh and they would get work done and pass bills that
[2:35:17.540 --> 2:35:23.780]  were laws that were left. Relatively leftist because he was normal. This bitch is a Trotskyite
[2:35:23.780 --> 2:35:29.420]  pedophile lunatic. And there's she's not pulling Roberts and Kavanaugh and remotely
[2:35:29.420 --> 2:35:35.100]  near her. So just like the left is ostracizing their liberal comedians, this bitch is going
[2:35:35.100 --> 2:35:42.180]  to ostracize all of the moderates on the Supreme Court. She 100% of the time is lenient on
[2:35:42.180 --> 2:35:46.780]  sexual predators who prey on children. If it's looking like they're going to get 10
[2:35:46.780 --> 2:35:51.860]  years, she'll give them 60 months. She always gives the minimum. I think she's a pedophile
[2:35:51.860 --> 2:35:52.860]  herself.
[2:35:52.860 --> 2:35:57.660]  Well, I know this. I mean, even mainline news admits they've never seen a federal judge
[2:35:57.660 --> 2:36:02.300]  this easy on pedos. What do you think is going on there?
[2:36:02.300 --> 2:36:08.860]  A competence. I like, I don't want to think that Joe Biden is knowingly appointing a pedophile,
[2:36:08.860 --> 2:36:13.140]  but I'm not going to rule that out. But I think Mr. Magoo over there in the White House
[2:36:13.140 --> 2:36:18.020]  just said, we got to get a black woman. Who's a smart black woman? Oh, this lady's been
[2:36:18.020 --> 2:36:21.180]  a lawyer for a long time. Let's make her a Supreme Court judge.
[2:36:21.180 --> 2:36:26.700]  And again, I've got the article right here. Even the New York Times admits she's given
[2:36:26.700 --> 2:36:33.220]  under the minimum every time. So she even violates the law every time and violates her
[2:36:33.220 --> 2:36:38.740]  position. That enough is insane. Why would you always go easy on pedos?
[2:36:38.740 --> 2:36:44.060]  It's her trademark, too. It's not like she's also known for being lenient on guns or hard
[2:36:44.060 --> 2:36:48.700]  on guns or no. Anyone who's in the industry who knows this woman goes, oh, yeah, that's
[2:36:48.700 --> 2:36:52.980]  Katanji Jackson. She's the chick who's really easy on pedophiles. If you molest a kid, you
[2:36:52.980 --> 2:36:58.580]  want her as your judge boy, you're going to come out smelling like roses. And like, does
[2:36:58.580 --> 2:37:03.700]  I know Mr. Magoo is an imbecile, but doesn't he have people who have access to Google?
[2:37:03.700 --> 2:37:08.140]  Everyone knows this about her. And now it's becoming mainstream news. Are they knowingly
[2:37:08.140 --> 2:37:13.140]  sabotaging the country or are we just seeing extreme incompetence?
[2:37:13.140 --> 2:37:16.380]  Very well said. Let me show you a few articles since you mentioned this. This is the New
[2:37:16.380 --> 2:37:22.300]  York Post. Disney employees among 108 arrested in Florida, human trafficking sting, trafficking
[2:37:22.300 --> 2:37:26.580]  children, you name it, they're supposed to the big state run orphanages outside Austin,
[2:37:26.580 --> 2:37:31.340]  run by a liberal group that was raping children in mass as young as seven, producing child
[2:37:31.340 --> 2:37:37.900]  porn. Oregon's top children's hospital teaches young boys to tuck their genitals and directs
[2:37:37.900 --> 2:37:42.900]  kids to sex toy porn shops as young as seven years old out of by a dildo. I don't want
[2:37:42.900 --> 2:37:47.820]  to talk about this on air, folks. That's what's going on with our children. Medical kidnapping,
[2:37:47.820 --> 2:37:51.740]  breast milk dependent infant taken away because they're breastfeeding. We've just got all
[2:37:51.740 --> 2:37:57.500]  of this. And then you've got this whole backdrop of Jeffrey Epstein. And then now you've got
[2:37:57.500 --> 2:38:01.580]  the New York Post and others confirming the FBI goes, okay, it is his laptop as if we
[2:38:01.580 --> 2:38:06.260]  didn't know that 15 months ago in the middle of the election. So you've got all of that
[2:38:06.260 --> 2:38:12.020]  with Biden making weird comments about it. I mean, what is going on here, Gavin?
[2:38:12.020 --> 2:38:17.380]  Here's what's really happening. The left when they're radicalizing the country, they put
[2:38:17.380 --> 2:38:22.860]  up a curtain and the curtain says, don't be racist, don't be homophobic. And I don't,
[2:38:22.860 --> 2:38:27.620]  I think a lot of the people who put up that curtain are good people and they genuinely
[2:38:27.620 --> 2:38:33.100]  think I'm worried about some gay five year old getting beat up. So I don't want that.
[2:38:33.100 --> 2:38:40.100]  So they put up this force field. Now predators, perverts and weirdos use that force field
[2:38:40.100 --> 2:38:45.860]  to do bad things. So under the premise, under the guise of let's not hurt people, we have
[2:38:45.860 --> 2:38:50.100]  drag queen story hour where the guys are showing up with no underwear, flashing their genitals
[2:38:50.100 --> 2:38:54.780]  to kids and twerking for kids. And we've got Desmond the entertainer, whatever the hell
[2:38:54.780 --> 2:39:00.460]  his name is, Desmond is amazing, getting money put into his underpants at gay bars in New
[2:39:00.460 --> 2:39:05.380]  York at three in the morning. And we have teachers saying, I tell my kiddos that I'm
[2:39:05.380 --> 2:39:09.620]  polyamorous and they can use these pronouns and look at all the rainbow flags. And the
[2:39:09.620 --> 2:39:15.900]  next thing you know, you've made a space for groomers. Like I bet when the Boy Scout said
[2:39:15.900 --> 2:39:19.980]  Oh, exactly. No, no, start over. But I'm interrupting. That's what it is. It's literal grooming of
[2:39:19.980 --> 2:39:24.620]  children. Even Bill Maher said, leave him alone. It's obvious sexualization of grooming
[2:39:24.620 --> 2:39:29.420]  of children when they're not sexual, but the perverts, whether they're heterosexual or
[2:39:29.420 --> 2:39:33.020]  homosexual, whether they want little girls, little boys, same sex or not, it's all just
[2:39:33.020 --> 2:39:38.380]  as bad. They want to get it innocent children because they can't form adult relationships
[2:39:38.380 --> 2:39:46.740]  because the most of them were abused. Gay is a type of sex. Now kids don't like hearing
[2:39:46.740 --> 2:39:52.460]  about relationships. I have kids, if they're watching a TV and the straight couple kisses
[2:39:52.460 --> 2:39:57.820]  on TV, they go, they don't want to hear, they don't like it. And it's a genetic thing that's
[2:39:57.820 --> 2:40:02.340]  in them so they don't get molested. It's good. Thank God it exists. Absolutely. Children
[2:40:02.340 --> 2:40:07.340]  don't like even mild sexual stuff like kissing. They go, why something else? Because that's
[2:40:07.340 --> 2:40:12.900]  not what they're supposed to be doing. Now there's a cartoon out the crudes or the droods
[2:40:12.900 --> 2:40:17.340]  or something. And I was watching it with my nine year old and the beginning of the movie,
[2:40:17.340 --> 2:40:21.220]  this teenage girl is obsessed with this guy. And every time he's near, she swoons and little
[2:40:21.220 --> 2:40:25.860]  hearts come out of her head. He was watching it like this. It's not sexual, but there's
[2:40:25.860 --> 2:40:30.940]  love there. And he was, he couldn't bear to look at it. It was so gross to him. Why are
[2:40:30.940 --> 2:40:37.140]  you telling children how you fornicate? Say I only had anal sex. That was my thing. Never
[2:40:37.140 --> 2:40:41.540]  in the normal hole. I'm straight, but I only did it anally. Can you imagine me telling
[2:40:41.540 --> 2:40:45.820]  my kindergarten class? Hey guys, I thought you should know this. I don't do the normal
[2:40:45.820 --> 2:40:51.100]  hole. I only do the butthole. That's kind of me. That's my thing. You don't want a heterosexual,
[2:40:51.100 --> 2:40:54.580]  homosexual, any talk and interrupt you earlier, but you're making the point. This is grooming
[2:40:54.580 --> 2:41:00.220]  spaces and that keeps happening. Drag queen story time, girl scouts, boy scouts is basically
[2:41:00.220 --> 2:41:06.060]  bankrupt because of it. They have opened them up as free spaces for pedophiles under, you
[2:41:06.060 --> 2:41:11.660]  know, not being anti, you know, whatever to come in and do this, right? The road to hell
[2:41:11.660 --> 2:41:15.380]  is paved with good intentions. And I bet you when the boy scout said, we should let gay
[2:41:15.380 --> 2:41:22.460]  leaders in, they, they didn't intend to groom, but groomers see this window, this opportunity
[2:41:22.460 --> 2:41:28.300]  and they go, I'm going to go be a boy scout. And I can go rape kids. And this is what we're
[2:41:28.300 --> 2:41:34.220]  doing with, with the NYPD, with FDMI, not grooming kids, but under the guise of fighting
[2:41:34.220 --> 2:41:40.180]  racism, we're letting incompetent boobs and, and parasites. Eric Adams is a parasite.
[2:41:40.180 --> 2:41:45.500]  The mayor of New York is a scam artist. He has no intention of fixing the city. He's
[2:41:45.500 --> 2:41:51.660]  like Ratso Rizzo for midnight. Perhaps because he's a little bit more well spoken and he's
[2:41:51.660 --> 2:41:58.300]  black so he can't be attacked. They're the same thing. DeBlasio wasn't DeBlasio. DeBlasio
[2:41:58.300 --> 2:42:03.300]  is pussy whipped. He's his black wife. She runs the show and she makes sure she gets
[2:42:03.300 --> 2:42:09.380]  $800 million to thrive, whatever the hell that means. Uh, so they're, they're all the
[2:42:09.380 --> 2:42:15.220]  same. Socialists who take advantage of people's good nature and we all hear something like,
[2:42:15.220 --> 2:42:19.980]  Hey, I'm going to be fighting racism. And you go, that sounds good. I don't like Nazis.
[2:42:19.980 --> 2:42:24.780]  And the next thing you know, they're depersoning people, banning people, putting Nick Fuentes
[2:42:24.780 --> 2:42:31.460]  on a no fly list, telling Laura Loomer, she can't use Uber, tying you up in legal BS
[2:42:31.460 --> 2:42:36.340]  for years at a time to the tune of millions of dollars all under the guise of equality
[2:42:36.340 --> 2:42:42.340]  and justice. It's Orwellian. It's a lie. I totally agree. We got one more segment with
[2:42:42.340 --> 2:42:46.860]  the legend. He is a legend. Gavin McGinnis of censored.tv. Go there. Check it out. Be
[2:42:46.860 --> 2:42:50.100]  part of the resistance. What do we, we're gonna come right back. You got a lot more
[2:42:50.100 --> 2:43:18.100]  to say. And it's where to see where Gavin's going to go next. Please stay with us.
[2:43:18.100 --> 2:43:23.820]  And now across the world from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[2:43:23.820 --> 2:43:32.500]  that if you amplify any quote pro Russian information, you can be censored. You can
[2:43:32.500 --> 2:43:38.140]  be arrested. You can be at prison. And of course now Canada is under this legislation that
[2:43:38.140 --> 2:43:44.180]  if you have a thought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate
[2:43:44.180 --> 2:43:49.820]  speech online, that you will be censored and arrested. Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism
[2:43:49.820 --> 2:43:54.980]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes infowars.com
[2:43:54.980 --> 2:43:56.660]  more important than ever.
[2:43:56.660 --> 2:44:01.700]  We here at Infowars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[2:44:01.700 --> 2:44:07.540]  is now available at InfowarsStore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in
[2:44:07.540 --> 2:44:11.540]  the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the
[2:44:11.540 --> 2:44:17.660]  Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend,
[2:44:17.660 --> 2:44:23.740]  Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler
[2:44:23.740 --> 2:44:28.820]  and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings
[2:44:28.820 --> 2:44:33.820]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by
[2:44:33.820 --> 2:44:39.420]  many who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains
[2:44:39.420 --> 2:44:45.340]  a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German
[2:44:45.340 --> 2:44:51.220]  Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Valerian Root. We do expect to sell this new product
[2:44:51.220 --> 2:44:56.220]  quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[2:44:56.220 --> 2:44:59.860]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we rise to momentum right now,
[2:44:59.860 --> 2:45:03.260]  take advantage of this moment, and I have always an idea that something everybody can
[2:45:03.260 --> 2:45:07.580]  do, that every listener can do. I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to, you know,
[2:45:07.580 --> 2:45:12.100]  hang banners over highways. Imagine a champion, an artist, and a leader, a painter. It says,
[2:45:12.100 --> 2:45:17.100]  Alex Jones is right, InfowarsStore Farm. We stand with the truckers, or restouts, or whatever.
[2:45:17.100 --> 2:45:21.260]  Brother, I'm so glad you called, elaborate on this. Yes, now is the time in your small
[2:45:21.260 --> 2:45:25.260]  town, or your big city, to write something on the bathroom wall, or to put a sticker
[2:45:25.260 --> 2:45:30.900]  on your car, or banner hangs over highways, and it will be a chain reaction. What do you
[2:45:30.900 --> 2:45:34.900]  recommend people say on these banner hangs? I have a few ideas. First of all, I'll just
[2:45:34.900 --> 2:45:38.420]  give you a quick summary of what you call InfowarsStore Farm, a restout, a restout swab.
[2:45:38.420 --> 2:45:41.900]  The vaccine is poison. There's tons of things. I said, just keep it short, keep it concise.
[2:45:41.900 --> 2:45:47.180]  No, I agree. A restfouchy, arrest bill gates, the COVID-vaxx is poison. Beautiful. Yeah.
[2:45:47.180 --> 2:45:50.500]  There's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be effective, so that's what
[2:45:50.500 --> 2:45:54.860]  I'm calling about. God bless you, Chris. In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling
[2:45:54.860 --> 2:45:59.140]  us today. Thank you so much. Experience the next level in high-powered energy

[2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:27.060]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:27.060 --> 2:47:39.740]  We are back live. Ladies and gentlemen, with Gavin McGinnis, one of the people I really
[2:47:39.740 --> 2:47:44.620]  respect. There's not many people out there, more demonized and more punished than me and
[2:47:44.620 --> 2:47:50.300]  I gotta say, he's about as punishment attack as I've been. Maybe Laura Loomer, maybe President
[2:47:50.300 --> 2:47:53.420]  Trump, but we're not like victims. We're not trying to be punished here. We want to
[2:47:53.420 --> 2:47:57.780]  persevere and win the fight. We only win the fight thanks to your prayers, your support
[2:47:57.780 --> 2:48:03.020]  and your word of mouth, but I was about to ask Gavin, what are the solutions? And I was
[2:48:03.020 --> 2:48:07.660]  talking to him about coming next week and maybe coming in for part of the show or something
[2:48:07.660 --> 2:48:11.300]  because I just miss him so much. He was here a few years ago. We had a great time, met
[2:48:11.300 --> 2:48:15.060]  him years before that, of course, and he said, listen, that's great, Alex. I'll come next
[2:48:15.060 --> 2:48:19.500]  week, but can we talk about solutions? That's exactly where I wanted to go. So the 10 minutes
[2:48:19.500 --> 2:48:28.140]  we have left, what do we do about this, Gavin? If they shoot at your feet, don't dance. Don't
[2:48:28.140 --> 2:48:33.100]  apologize. Don't make excuses. And I've made this mistake a hundred times. I'm not racist.
[2:48:33.100 --> 2:48:37.780]  I'm anti-semitic. No, no, that's not what I meant. Don't say that. Go. Yeah, whatever.
[2:48:37.780 --> 2:48:41.900]  What are you going to do about it? Because they're not looking for the truth. They want
[2:48:41.900 --> 2:48:48.380]  a villain. So go. Yeah, I'm your bad guy. F you. I hate you. You know, like I had someone
[2:48:48.380 --> 2:48:53.660]  who accused me of being at January 6th recently. And my first instinct is to go, no, no, no,
[2:48:53.660 --> 2:48:58.300]  I wasn't there. You're thinking of this guy who lives in Arizona. He has my same glasses
[2:48:58.300 --> 2:49:03.180]  and mustache. He's actually in jail now. And then I thought, so what if I was at January
[2:49:03.180 --> 2:49:08.140]  6th? Screw you. You know, I'm not, I'm not ashamed of the people who were there. I think
[2:49:08.140 --> 2:49:12.500]  they're patriots. I think they're being framed by the government. Yeah, you know what? I
[2:49:12.500 --> 2:49:17.220]  was there. How about that? You know, you're racist. Yeah, yeah, I'm racist, whatever you
[2:49:17.220 --> 2:49:22.380]  say. Got me. Don't apologize. Plow through it. If people are genuinely curious and they
[2:49:22.380 --> 2:49:26.540]  say, Hey, man, I read that you Zeke Hild or something. You go and it's a friend and they're
[2:49:26.540 --> 2:49:30.500]  coming at you in a genuinely curious way. You go. No, no, no, that I was waving goodbye
[2:49:30.500 --> 2:49:35.740]  or whatever you you could explain it to them. Yeah, but even John Cleese made jokes about
[2:49:35.740 --> 2:49:40.900]  Hitler and Charlie Chaplin. Why? Why are you even? Why aren't we allowed? Like I'm good
[2:49:40.900 --> 2:49:45.780]  friends with Jesse James. Great guy. You know, totally pro Israel, but it'd be okay if he
[2:49:45.780 --> 2:49:49.660]  wasn't. He did a joke once when somebody gave him a Nazi out of a Zeke Hild. They tried
[2:49:49.660 --> 2:49:54.460]  to do platforming for that. It's BS, man. Why can, why can Arnold Schwarzenegger say he
[2:49:54.460 --> 2:50:00.420]  loves Hitler in Rolling Stone, which is his free speech. His dad's an SS officer, but
[2:50:00.420 --> 2:50:07.220]  then we can't make Hitler jokes. That's why can't Count Dankula had his pug do how Hitler.
[2:50:07.220 --> 2:50:14.220]  That's funny. We can is the answer to that. We can make any jokes we want because as soon
[2:50:14.220 --> 2:50:19.020]  as you appease them, they don't stop. Like right now they're going back through history
[2:50:19.020 --> 2:50:24.220]  and erasing any joke that had blackface. They're not racist jokes. They're just jokes where
[2:50:24.220 --> 2:50:29.180]  there was blackface in it. Sarah Silverman program. David Cross was wearing blackface
[2:50:29.180 --> 2:50:35.420]  as a when he portrayed an idiot racist on a Mr. Show. Little Britain had a character
[2:50:35.420 --> 2:50:40.100]  that was a black woman played by a guy that it had nothing to do with race. But yes, he
[2:50:40.100 --> 2:50:44.780]  was wearing coloring to play the character. Remember on SNL, Fred Armisen would play
[2:50:44.780 --> 2:50:50.220]  Obama without any makeup. So he'd look like a pale, like he looked like Obama had food
[2:50:50.220 --> 2:50:53.900]  poisoning or something and was about to throw up. Well, what are you doing? But think about
[2:50:53.900 --> 2:50:59.940]  what mind control. This is that you can't make fun of a Nazi in a Nazi uniform that
[2:50:59.940 --> 2:51:05.780]  you means you're a Nazi. This is just meant to murder common sense. You know, and I remember
[2:51:05.780 --> 2:51:11.500]  years ago, maybe 20 years ago, we knew these guys and they were making anti Nazi stickers.
[2:51:11.500 --> 2:51:15.420]  It was a swastika with the line through it. And they were arrested because it's illegal
[2:51:15.420 --> 2:51:21.060]  to make a swastika. And that New York Times article. But I'm against it. Exactly. Well,
[2:51:21.060 --> 2:51:25.620]  say that again, because I interrupt you. This is important. You just said, yeah, he was
[2:51:25.620 --> 2:51:29.060]  making stickers that had a swastika with a line through it. And he was arrested for it
[2:51:29.060 --> 2:51:32.180]  because there's a swastika there. But he's like, no, no, no, I'm again. And they go,
[2:51:32.180 --> 2:51:36.860]  it doesn't matter. Any kind of swastika is verboten. And that's in Germany. So let's
[2:51:36.860 --> 2:51:41.580]  expand on that. Once you take the Nazis rights, you take everybody's rights. I had a fake
[2:51:41.580 --> 2:51:46.540]  New York Times article written about me, when employees said they saw shoes with swastikas
[2:51:46.540 --> 2:51:52.420]  on them. And yes, a Japanese lady, mailed us little leather hand-dumped things with
[2:51:52.420 --> 2:51:58.020]  Pelosi and a swastika over her with a cross through it. Same deal. Now I'm a Nazi that
[2:51:58.020 --> 2:52:05.580]  wears Nazi shoes because someone nailed mailed me something saying Pelosi's a Nazi. Don't
[2:52:05.580 --> 2:52:12.900]  apologize. Don't explain yourself. Say, yes, I wear Nazi shoes. You got me. Giving them
[2:52:12.900 --> 2:52:17.260]  any kind of explanation, it's like giving a vampire just a little shot of your own blood
[2:52:17.260 --> 2:52:20.220]  and saying, there, will you leave me alone now? And yeah, but this is something I don't
[2:52:20.220 --> 2:52:24.020]  understand. You understand it. You warned me years ago. I bet they're like, hey, you've
[2:52:24.020 --> 2:52:27.460]  hurt people's feelings with this. Even if you're right, just say you're sorry. And as
[2:52:27.460 --> 2:52:31.380]  soon as you say you're sorry, they go, we got you. You lied on purpose. It's all over.
[2:52:31.380 --> 2:52:35.940]  Why are they obsessed with having us say we're sorry because it makes them morally superior
[2:52:35.940 --> 2:52:42.980]  or what? Yes, it's power. It's power. It's shooting at their feet and making us dance.
[2:52:42.980 --> 2:52:47.220]  That's what they're doing. So the more you dance, the more they shoot at your feet. Don't
[2:52:47.220 --> 2:52:52.380]  give them the power. Remember that dude, Brett Reichman Reisner. What the hell was his name?
[2:52:52.380 --> 2:52:58.260]  The producer who directed a high tower with Eddie Murphy, they said to him, hey, does
[2:52:58.260 --> 2:53:02.740]  Eddie Murphy rehearse? And he says, excuse my language. He goes, ah, rehearsals are for
[2:53:02.740 --> 2:53:07.500]  fags. They made him apologize for that. He was canceled from the Golden Globes. He was
[2:53:07.500 --> 2:53:12.620]  supposed to be directing that. And then after his apology, they said, that's not good enough.
[2:53:12.620 --> 2:53:18.940]  They made him go on an apology tour around the country to various LGBT institutions.
[2:53:18.940 --> 2:53:26.060]  They did like an entire bus tour of apologizing that it became their currency. They will never
[2:53:26.060 --> 2:53:31.340]  be satisfied. It's like a crazy jealous girlfriend who thinks you're cheating on her. Do you
[2:53:31.340 --> 2:53:36.000]  think wearing a GPS tag is going to satiate her and she'll stop freaking out about everyone
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:41.380]  who calls you? No, she's insatiable. Give up.
[2:53:41.380 --> 2:53:46.380]  Yeah, but getting back to solutions is I mean, you really are a smart guy. Really the audience
[2:53:46.380 --> 2:53:50.700]  values your opinion, your trailblazer, people who don't know you are the minority out there.
[2:53:50.700 --> 2:53:54.460]  How do you see this ending? If you told me six years ago, I think I see it peaking. This
[2:53:54.460 --> 2:53:58.300]  is too ridiculous. You said it'll get a lot worse. They'll take over the institutions.
[2:53:58.300 --> 2:54:01.620]  They'll persecute us. Alice is going to get a lot worse. Okay. Tell me that how bad does
[2:54:01.620 --> 2:54:05.340]  it get? And where is the light at the end of the tunnel?
[2:54:05.340 --> 2:54:10.180]  The light at the end of the tunnel is Trump. Trump is coming back. He's going to get reelected.
[2:54:10.180 --> 2:54:15.740]  He's going to be president. And this time around, we've experienced life without Trump.
[2:54:15.740 --> 2:54:21.540]  We've experienced the Mr. Magoo presidency. We've seen a nuclear war almost break out,
[2:54:21.540 --> 2:54:27.860]  possibly break out in Eastern Europe. We've seen gas go to prices so high that it's the
[2:54:27.860 --> 2:54:33.660]  same as the movie I Am Legend when Will Smith is pumping gas at the abandoned gas station
[2:54:33.660 --> 2:54:39.460]  with vines all over it. The movies that have apocalypses are here now live.
[2:54:39.460 --> 2:54:43.620]  So when Trump comes back and says, you see what it was like without me, we're going to
[2:54:43.620 --> 2:54:47.980]  go, yes, yes, we're sorry. I can't believe I said that about you. Please, can you fix
[2:54:47.980 --> 2:54:54.740]  this mess? He's now coming back with after the spoiled brats, after the lunatics have
[2:54:54.740 --> 2:55:00.140]  run the asylum and they want him back too. I'm telling you, the left wants Trump back.
[2:55:00.140 --> 2:55:06.100]  The left wants gas prices low. The left wants people employed. The left sees Eric Davis
[2:55:06.100 --> 2:55:11.300]  destroy the FDMY and destroy New York City. We all want jobs and safety. So he's going
[2:55:11.300 --> 2:55:15.420]  to come back and clean house and it's not going to be hard because the left has become
[2:55:15.420 --> 2:55:19.140]  so deranged and woke that even the left hates them.
[2:55:19.140 --> 2:55:23.740]  Russell Brant. It's a new liberal fetish to like Trump, which Trump's not perfect. I
[2:55:23.740 --> 2:55:27.660]  was mad about his vaccine stuff. I know he means well. But here's the deal though. They've
[2:55:27.660 --> 2:55:33.380]  got all these Clinton lawyers and Obama lawyers running around trying to outlaw Trump rerunning.
[2:55:33.380 --> 2:55:37.100]  He's been failing in court, but they're trying to ban members of Congress running again.
[2:55:37.100 --> 2:55:41.620]  I mean, it's very fascist. Talk about trying to block elections. What do you see them doing
[2:55:41.620 --> 2:55:47.380]  with 235 days out from the midterms? Because they're branding everywhere. Questioning elections
[2:55:47.380 --> 2:55:51.900]  is terror and the proud boys, which you founded, which were peaceful, which you have been part
[2:55:51.900 --> 2:55:56.220]  of for years, which are setting up, they're claiming they are going to do stuff all obviously
[2:55:56.220 --> 2:56:01.940]  completely made up. But we really see them building towards a crescendo.
[2:56:01.940 --> 2:56:09.940]  Yes. And what happens with that? Revolution happens. This is unsustainable. And I think
[2:56:09.940 --> 2:56:14.660]  the left secretly wants us to rise up. They're saying, can you go take care of this? Can
[2:56:14.660 --> 2:56:20.220]  you go fix? You're the tough guy. Go fight them. Go be a, go candle this complete limited.
[2:56:20.220 --> 2:56:24.500]  Like where does AOC and Pelosi go on vacation? They go to Florida. They want to be under
[2:56:24.500 --> 2:56:29.380]  DeSantis. They want the freedom that DeSantis provides. And all of America wants the freedom
[2:56:29.380 --> 2:56:35.300]  that Trump is like all the left is flooding and running to Texas. Why do they do that?
[2:56:35.300 --> 2:56:40.180]  Because Texas is the free estate in the union. We're all, all the, everyone's moving south.
[2:56:40.180 --> 2:56:44.780]  The left is moving south. And the, the south is saying, we don't want you here. You're
[2:56:44.780 --> 2:56:48.660]  just going to turn this. I know you got to go to the other side. Yeah. But I want to
[2:56:48.660 --> 2:56:53.020]  ask you the question now with, with a minute left, it's true geographically with their
[2:56:53.020 --> 2:56:57.860]  money and with their actions, the left wants to be populist, right wing, which is smart.
[2:56:57.860 --> 2:57:03.220]  But with all their rhetoric or the opposite and 45 seconds, why is that?
[2:57:03.220 --> 2:57:07.260]  Because of white guilt, whites genetically have something in them that no other race
[2:57:07.260 --> 2:57:11.980]  has. And it's self-hatred and ethnomasticism. I don't know why it's been programmed into
[2:57:11.980 --> 2:57:16.980]  us, but we want to self-destruct when we reach a certain level of success. It's a bizarre
[2:57:16.980 --> 2:57:22.300]  trait that no Japanese Mexicans blacks, no one else has this trait. It's weird. Now you're
[2:57:22.300 --> 2:57:27.740]  right. All the old white people out of Cleveland family just are like guilty and hate themselves.
[2:57:27.740 --> 2:57:31.500]  You want to just, I don't even know what the hell is going on here. Well, I don't have
[2:57:31.500 --> 2:57:35.860]  that gene. Gavin, stay there five more minutes with you and you're going to be in studio
[2:57:35.860 --> 2:57:42.420]  next week. And coming up, ladies and gentlemen, we have J. Dyer as well in full wars.com tomorrow's
[2:57:42.420 --> 2:57:47.540]  news today, today, today.
[2:57:47.540 --> 2:57:54.980]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[2:57:54.980 --> 2:58:01.140]  until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[2:58:01.140 --> 2:58:07.340]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their laws. But because
[2:58:07.340 --> 2:58:13.740]  of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[2:58:13.740 --> 2:58:20.420]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[2:58:20.420 --> 2:58:26.620]  takeover. And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem is some globalist
[2:58:26.620 --> 2:58:32.220]  controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover like Canada. They've now declared
[2:58:32.220 --> 2:58:37.460]  a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following
[2:58:37.460 --> 2:58:42.820]  suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time. It's a very serious situation. Stay
[2:58:42.820 --> 2:58:47.900]  tuned into info wars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.

[2:59:49.060 --> 3:00:08.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:08.180 --> 3:00:11.740]  Kevin McGinnis in his final segment he's agreed to come to Austin next week and co-host with
[3:00:11.740 --> 3:00:16.780]  us a couple days. Myself I want to try and others are really look forward to that.
[3:00:16.780 --> 3:00:22.820]  Gavin we've got to win we've got to beat this this fascism this race-based mind control
[3:00:22.820 --> 3:00:28.060]  this the opposite of what they claim they are. What other hopes do you have for humanity
[3:00:28.060 --> 3:00:33.420]  what other angles you think people should be made aware of incredible day and age we're
[3:00:33.420 --> 3:00:36.140]  in. I'm really excited about the zoomers I by
[3:00:36.140 --> 3:00:41.260]  something earlier I said give up and it had a lot of annunciation to it. I meant give
[3:00:41.260 --> 3:00:45.980]  up trying to appease the left they don't really want your piece but never give up at the end
[3:00:45.980 --> 3:00:51.860]  of my show I say get fired get in trouble be brave and never stop fighting you can never
[3:00:51.860 --> 3:00:56.660]  ever stop fighting you always got to get up off the mat and keep doing this they don't
[3:00:56.660 --> 3:01:02.620]  have the kind of long term strength that we have they don't have the tenacity or the fortitude
[3:01:02.620 --> 3:01:08.740]  to keep damaging us of being on cocaine like Don Jr. and me I mean I'm not on cocaine I
[3:01:08.740 --> 3:01:16.020]  had to take alcohol to get myself down I have too much energy yeah I think they're surprised
[3:01:16.020 --> 3:01:21.820]  how long it is like you look at someone like Michelle Malkin go read her college newspaper
[3:01:21.820 --> 3:01:28.060]  articles from 1992 she's been fighting the good fight for for almost half a century like
[3:01:28.060 --> 3:01:33.980]  she's 30 years she's been going non-stop you you can see you can see you on public access
[3:01:33.980 --> 3:01:38.020]  as a as a little kid almost like we're in it for the long haul and you think of these
[3:01:38.020 --> 3:01:42.820]  nightmares these people that torment us they have these little blips and then they die
[3:01:42.820 --> 3:01:48.700]  out because their heart isn't in it they have no character and they have no true love of
[3:01:48.700 --> 3:01:53.980]  faith in this country it's just fashion for them and fashion fades fast exactly you're
[3:01:53.980 --> 3:01:59.180]  saying we went in the end because we have heart and perseverance correct and we have
[3:01:59.180 --> 3:02:03.900]  families and we love them and we want there to be a future and we also want our kids to
[3:02:03.900 --> 3:02:10.380]  say my dad was a handshake guy and if he said something his word mattered and when they tried
[3:02:10.380 --> 3:02:16.020]  to cancel him he told them all to screw off he fought every day of his life and he never
[3:02:16.020 --> 3:02:20.980]  let it get him down and he never apologized and that's something you wanted to last after
[3:02:20.980 --> 3:02:25.460]  you die the left they don't even have kids like they don't care about any of this it's
[3:02:25.460 --> 3:02:29.180]  meaningless to them I've noticed too when I bring it up with them I'll be like hey that
[3:02:29.180 --> 3:02:32.820]  article you wrote three years ago where you said blah blah blah they'll go what I don't
[3:02:32.820 --> 3:02:36.700]  know what you're talking about like they don't remember what they said because they don't
[3:02:36.700 --> 3:02:40.900]  mean what they say they have no responsibility because they think that's weakness responsibility
[3:02:40.900 --> 3:02:48.660]  is strength yeah they want to travel what's so fun about sunbathing yeah how many women
[3:02:48.660 --> 3:02:53.620]  say nothing I love traveling too but how many women say oh my profession is traveling or
[3:02:53.620 --> 3:03:01.300]  my hobby is traveling no no no hobbyist would work or rock climbing or helping disabled
[3:03:01.300 --> 3:03:07.420]  children or helping people at a nursing home it's not traveling yeah traveling is just
[3:03:07.420 --> 3:03:11.020]  trying different foods now you see what's happening with these women they're becoming
[3:03:11.020 --> 3:03:15.660]  obsessed with their dogs they're getting photo shoots with their dogs they call themselves
[3:03:15.660 --> 3:03:20.780]  fur mommies their maternal instinct has been shifted to this thing that we bred to love
[3:03:20.780 --> 3:03:25.900]  them it might as well be a stuffed animal it's pathetic and the I think younger people
[3:03:25.900 --> 3:03:30.780]  zoomers zoomers like Nick Fuentes I got to say I was at AFPAC and there was tons of
[3:03:30.780 --> 3:03:36.900]  black people there and that it was a room of people a thousand people who were over
[3:03:36.900 --> 3:03:43.420]  racism they didn't point is not a racist he's made a few jokes about it and and again basically
[3:03:43.420 --> 3:03:48.020]  why do you defend it because if I thought he was a really somebody that hated Hispanics
[3:03:48.020 --> 3:03:52.820]  and blacks whatever I would not like him but he's made a few jokes and he's also not apologizing
[3:03:52.820 --> 3:03:58.540]  being white like you said stop apologizing I've done nothing wrong yeah these guys hung
[3:03:58.540 --> 3:04:03.020]  out with these kids after the show they had rented a big party house and these kids were
[3:04:03.020 --> 3:04:08.300]  smart brave articulate you know what they were doing at their party house a guy upstairs
[3:04:08.300 --> 3:04:15.100]  was doing a tax seminar and talking about how to save money and how to invest and they
[3:04:15.100 --> 3:04:19.380]  were doing Bitcoin workshops and have and getting wasted and wearing Hawaiian shirts
[3:04:19.380 --> 3:04:23.980]  and jumping in the pool that these zoomers are I'm not even going to call them right
[3:04:23.980 --> 3:04:31.500]  wing they're just done with identity politics and all this stuff and it's a yes it all falls
[3:04:31.500 --> 3:04:36.140]  all these and racist and bigot and antisemite it goes like water off a ducks back to them
[3:04:36.140 --> 3:04:40.660]  they couldn't care less and it's pretty inspiring it's like Martin Luther King said you judge
[3:04:40.660 --> 3:04:45.780]  somebody about what they do what they stand for not what color they are or even what
[3:04:45.780 --> 3:04:51.100]  gender they are Gavin you're coming to town next week we're getting it set up right yes

[3:05:11.820 --> 3:05:17.260]  into the night to their facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their
[3:05:17.260 --> 3:05:22.100]  shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities
[3:05:22.100 --> 3:05:25.940]  for their safety this is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to
[3:05:25.940 --> 3:05:30.700]  fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages many of which are made here in America

[3:14:18.460 --> 3:14:25.020]  the marvel universe now so i'll i'll i'll speak in the batman voice i don't need according
[3:14:25.020 --> 3:14:30.180]  to the mainstream mind we live in a marvel universe and they actually tailor the marvel
[3:14:30.180 --> 3:14:35.300]  propaganda so that the redditors the reddit brigade all these weirdos think that they're
[3:14:35.300 --> 3:14:40.740]  participating in this grand sort of uh you know avengers quest to you know destroy the
[3:14:40.740 --> 3:14:47.460]  bad guys or whatever and it's just so inane as we both said this week satires now reality

[3:14:53.020 --> 3:14:57.900]  what let's talk first about the the we'll get into what the funk apocalypse is a little
[3:14:57.900 --> 3:15:02.420]  bit but um well actually we're going to go to a breaker in a second but um before we
[3:15:02.420 --> 3:15:08.460]  go to that let's let's remember that uh this is like the ultimate period of psychological
[3:15:08.460 --> 3:15:12.940]  warfare i mean what we see is unparalleled i mean the stories for example the last few
[3:15:12.940 --> 3:15:18.300]  weeks about kia it's it's almost like you can't even figure out what's real you're
[3:15:18.300 --> 3:15:23.620]  sort of you're loose and and you know you don't have any bearing and i think that part
[3:15:23.620 --> 3:15:28.140]  of the job of the mainstream media now is to actually just gaslight us so that we don't
[3:15:28.140 --> 3:15:33.860]  have any bearings at all we can't get a fixed you know place to analyze anything and this
[3:15:33.860 --> 3:15:37.940]  just puts everybody into a catatonic state it's again it's the mass media is mind control
[3:15:37.940 --> 3:15:41.740]  so we're going to go to a breaker in a second but uh what reminds you guys to check out the

[3:21:47.420 --> 3:21:55.340]  need a ride i need more ammunition you know it's completely cartoonish the the reality
[3:21:55.340 --> 3:22:00.180]  that we're given right but what's not cartoonish are the results of this what are the results
[3:22:00.180 --> 3:22:06.460]  of sanctions on russia well it's increased fuel prices right it's a lack of grain and
[3:22:06.460 --> 3:22:11.660]  wheat which this lack of grain and wheat and fertilizer for growing the foods that much
[3:22:11.660 --> 3:22:16.540]  of the population is relying on this is nothing new as you and i have talked about many times
[3:22:16.540 --> 3:22:21.100]  over the last six months a fertilizer shortage a food shortage has been in the works has been
[3:22:21.100 --> 3:22:26.860]  engineered over the last couple years shoot the engineering of this goes back to the 1970s
[3:22:26.860 --> 3:22:31.740]  and before with the rockefeller foundation uh you're essentially consolidating the food
[3:22:31.740 --> 3:22:37.660]  supply through massive influx of money into genetic modification technologies the patents
[3:22:37.660 --> 3:22:42.380]  well that was the one under what underlies the state department member end of 200 uh
[3:22:42.380 --> 3:22:47.980]  you know model for kissinger saying we have to depopulate the third world give them give them
[3:22:47.980 --> 3:22:53.420]  less and less food cut out their food give them genetically modified grains that's the kissinger
[3:22:53.420 --> 3:22:58.540]  model the brzezinski model of attacking the food supply it's an ancient warfare technique it's
[3:22:58.540 --> 3:23:05.500]  mentioned in the uh well the way back to the art of war uh it's mentioned in art of war by uh
[3:23:05.500 --> 3:23:09.660]  mocky belly he has his own art of war he talks about all the strategies of attacking the food
[3:23:09.660 --> 3:23:13.820]  we know trawls galtender when we know birch and ross all these guys attack the food attack the
[3:23:13.820 --> 3:23:19.980]  food and that's one area that you are really good at and you actually woke me up to a lot of diet
[3:23:19.980 --> 3:23:26.700]  issues um and so let's get into that a little bit because that's you know what you're so good at is
[3:23:26.700 --> 3:23:31.740]  i mean as well as doing nails and hair i mean you you are on fleek i have to say but when it comes
[3:23:31.740 --> 3:23:42.380]  to diet your diet is on fleek okay so what is it about the malthusian policy that the deep state
[3:23:42.380 --> 3:23:49.180]  allied with or basically bought off by you know big pharma big ag um what is it that that's their
[3:23:49.180 --> 3:23:55.260]  modus operandi that they that they need to use uh why do they need to use food as a weapon
[3:23:55.260 --> 3:24:02.300]  yeah well i mean obviously this is there are a lot of reasons why food is an effective weapon i mean
[3:24:02.300 --> 3:24:08.140]  we all require fuel right as we see with this fuel price crisis we all require fuel to run vehicles
[3:24:08.140 --> 3:24:13.740]  we all require fuel to run our bodies right um there are certain minerals and certain nutrients
[3:24:13.740 --> 3:24:19.100]  where if we are deficient in them our body is not going to function correctly and our brains
[3:24:19.100 --> 3:24:23.660]  do not function correctly if they lack nutrients as well there are certain things like iodine
[3:24:23.660 --> 3:24:30.780]  right zinc copper selenium these are found primarily in animal foods right these fat soluble
[3:24:30.780 --> 3:24:37.020]  vitamins like vitamin d vitamin a vitamin k2 these are fat soluble vitamins that are found
[3:24:37.020 --> 3:24:42.620]  strictly in animal foods in their bioavailable forms like vitamin a uh you know a lot of the
[3:24:42.620 --> 3:24:46.380]  the plant-based diet components will say well you can get vitamin a from beta carotene well
[3:24:46.380 --> 3:24:52.380]  beta carotene is a plant form of vitamin a not the retinal form of vitamin a which your body
[3:24:52.380 --> 3:24:55.980]  actually needs for the development of your sexual nervous system so when you're taking you know when
[3:24:55.980 --> 3:25:00.220]  you're eating carrots yes you're getting vitamin a on paper but it's not the fat soluble form that
[3:25:00.220 --> 3:25:05.100]  you're going to get when you eat a food like liver when you eat a food like beef when you have
[3:25:05.980 --> 3:25:10.700]  fatty animal foods you are getting nutrients that you're not getting anywhere else and
[3:25:12.060 --> 3:25:17.340]  just coincidentally these are also the foods that you can produce locally on your own land
[3:25:17.340 --> 3:25:23.500]  in your own neighborhood right uh and without the need for heavy agrochemical inputs imf
[3:25:23.500 --> 3:25:28.540]  loans heavy machinery and tilling and these are also the foods that you can produce in a way
[3:25:28.540 --> 3:25:35.420]  that will improve soil quality right and improve the uh carbon deposits in the soil now i'm not
[3:25:35.420 --> 3:25:38.940]  saying that you know we need to reduce carbon in the atmosphere but if you want to build healthy
[3:25:38.940 --> 3:25:45.020]  soil that includes uh you know putting more carbon into the soil rumen and animals do this like
[3:25:45.020 --> 3:25:49.900]  nothing else in the world you cannot replace animals with technology they want to replace our
[3:25:49.900 --> 3:25:56.700]  food stuffs our food our animal foods with technological products they want to uh replace
[3:25:56.700 --> 3:26:03.260]  ourselves our own labor with technological uh replacements right and you're seeing this with
[3:26:03.260 --> 3:26:08.540]  the rollout of the great reset you're seeing a great replacement not just of our food supply
[3:26:08.540 --> 3:26:13.660]  and the animals in the livestock that build our soil uh that help us to build our communities
[3:26:13.660 --> 3:26:17.580]  and that help us to build our health and our bodies up um but it's also an attack
[3:26:18.380 --> 3:26:24.220]  on our on our very humanity they want to replace us and turn us into robots as well
[3:26:25.500 --> 3:26:31.020]  no no not true no you have to go into your soul and fight your father's demon
[3:26:31.900 --> 3:26:36.380]  no i'm i'm i joke about dorm peterson but actually i have to give a shout out to uh both
[3:26:36.380 --> 3:26:41.500]  dorm peterson and mikaela peterson and the fact that you had mikaela on and y'all did a couple
[3:26:41.500 --> 3:26:45.740]  interviews where you discussed diet and i noticed you know she had some of the same diet issues that
[3:26:45.740 --> 3:26:50.860]  i had and then i heard uh you know jordan peterson and mikaela on with joe rogan and uh those interviews
[3:26:50.860 --> 3:26:55.900]  actually changed my life because i couldn't find any solutions to my issues and and what that ended
[3:26:55.900 --> 3:27:01.420]  up being was what i'd already heard you promoting for a couple years before that which was the meat
[3:27:01.420 --> 3:27:06.460]  based diet not saying it's not a cult it doesn't mean everybody has to only eat meat but for people
[3:27:06.460 --> 3:27:12.140]  that have you know certain issues that result i think from glyphosate that's used you know to to
[3:27:13.020 --> 3:27:18.700]  to be a weed killer for gmo this kind of stuff has damaged our guts and this kind of stuff
[3:27:19.660 --> 3:27:25.340]  you know you really sort of got me looking into that so real briefly like what is what's the benefit
[3:27:25.340 --> 3:27:29.820]  of and that doesn't mean you can't use supplementation either guys so remember go you know a lot of
[3:27:29.820 --> 3:27:33.660]  what tristan recommended is over in the info war store you can go over there and find a lot of those
[3:27:33.660 --> 3:27:40.300]  um excellent supplements that will uh you know you you can add to your diet because we're so
[3:27:40.300 --> 3:27:46.460]  nutrient and mineral deficient what is it about a a largely meat based diet that would move jordan
[3:27:46.460 --> 3:27:52.620]  peterson joe rogan these people to really look at that as a viable alternative yeah yeah and i like
[3:27:52.620 --> 3:27:56.540]  the way that you call it a meat based diet i mean for a while there the the keyword was kind of a
[3:27:56.540 --> 3:28:00.860]  carnivore diet and it would lead some people to think that you're only able to eat animal foods
[3:28:00.860 --> 3:28:05.020]  now this is something that's been explored by a lot of doctors as well like dr natasha camble
[3:28:05.020 --> 3:28:09.740]  mcbride and her gaps the gut and psychology syndrome diet that she used to treat autistic
[3:28:09.740 --> 3:28:16.460]  children um this works for many reasons one of those reasons is our guts are thrashed right i mean
[3:28:16.460 --> 3:28:21.100]  the chemicals uh that are used in agriculture you mentioned glyphosate glyphosate is patented
[3:28:21.100 --> 3:28:27.420]  as an antibiotic it was first developed as a pipe cleaner as an industrial pipe cleaner for cleaning
[3:28:27.420 --> 3:28:33.820]  out uh you know corroded and and gunked up pipes it is patented as an antibiotic because what it
[3:28:33.820 --> 3:28:39.340]  does is it kills the soil microbes and that actually allow the production of uh things like
[3:28:39.340 --> 3:28:45.820]  manganese and the uptake of manganese into the the plants so hold on hold on i want to get deeper
[3:28:45.820 --> 3:28:49.340]  into this trip so we're gonna have to go to a break um and this is one of the best parts it's

[3:33:13.500 --> 3:33:23.020]  j dire of jsonosis.com my guest host is the most base most beautiful transitioned person on the
[3:33:23.020 --> 3:33:29.340]  internet he is a big fan of funko pops he has the whole collection basically his nails are on
[3:33:29.340 --> 3:33:34.860]  fleek and his name is tristan hager of primal edge health and he was just getting into the benefits
[3:33:34.860 --> 3:33:40.300]  of a meat based diet i know he's going to get into some some interesting people that are worth reading
[3:33:40.300 --> 3:33:44.940]  uh what's that classic book that everybody recommends the guy who went and studied all the
[3:33:44.940 --> 3:33:50.380]  tribes uh i always forget the guy's the guy's book what is that book weston a price right
[3:33:51.660 --> 3:33:58.300]  yeah yeah i mean at weston a price and his work on healthy populations and it wasn't just
[3:33:58.300 --> 3:34:03.820]  indigenous tribes i mean he visited the hevertees islands uh off of scotland he visited uh the
[3:34:03.820 --> 3:34:08.860]  lochental valley of swiss and he noticed there are certain commonalities among all these healthy
[3:34:08.860 --> 3:34:16.540]  cultures where there weren't people dying from tuberculosis from cancer and these were what he
[3:34:16.540 --> 3:34:22.780]  called the diseases of civilization and essentially what caused this he found was the introduction
[3:34:22.780 --> 3:34:27.980]  of processed foods right all of these cultures were weston a price found in his book which is a
[3:34:27.980 --> 3:34:33.740]  really important work on history anthropology and diet his book is called nutrition and physical
[3:34:33.740 --> 3:34:37.980]  degeneration i think that's a great read for people who are looking at what a healthy human
[3:34:37.980 --> 3:34:44.140]  diet looks like and what was common across the board from uh you know south pacific islanders
[3:34:44.860 --> 3:34:50.380]  healthy swiss populations american indian populations south american populations who
[3:34:50.380 --> 3:34:57.340]  didn't have the dental caries the dental disease the uh you know the the soy boy sucked in chin
[3:34:57.340 --> 3:35:02.220]  that was so prominent now in the west they all focused heavily on animal foods right so we're
[3:35:02.220 --> 3:35:07.500]  talking a little bit at the end there about life estate how it's a patented antibiotic and a lot
[3:35:07.500 --> 3:35:14.140]  of these agrochemicals that you know i mean alex so famously exposed the the atrazine right all of
[3:35:14.140 --> 3:35:21.420]  these destroy the gut they destroy our our circulatory system they destroy our fertility
[3:35:21.420 --> 3:35:27.020]  and our hormones and they do this they're doing damage to the gut entering in through the most
[3:35:27.020 --> 3:35:33.020]  sensitive area in the body is actually the gut you have more nerves and more highly sensitive
[3:35:33.020 --> 3:35:37.900]  uh nerve endings within the intestines and in the gut than you do in the tip of your fingers
[3:35:37.900 --> 3:35:42.540]  while you use people get a gut feeling right hormones get produced in the gut you destroy
[3:35:42.540 --> 3:35:47.740]  the gut microbiome and you destroy and organisms health you destroy its ability to reproduce and
[3:35:47.740 --> 3:35:53.820]  you destroy its vitality so a lot of us are wrecked by the glyphosate by the heavy antibiotic
[3:35:53.820 --> 3:36:00.780]  use by chemical fertilizers by uh chemicals in our atmosphere right that whether it be in our water
[3:36:00.780 --> 3:36:06.460]  uh in the fluoride the chlorine that gets put in the water uh are the things that are even sprayed
[3:36:06.460 --> 3:36:11.820]  in our environment so a lot of people let's a lot of people have been calling attention to
[3:36:11.820 --> 3:36:15.980]  seed oils too and this is something that gets overlooked because we think oh well i'll just
[3:36:15.980 --> 3:36:22.140]  avoid gmo stuff and i'll just you know uh focus on vegetables or something like that but actually
[3:36:22.140 --> 3:36:26.780]  it's not just glyphosate the glyphosate that's used it's also things like the seed oils that
[3:36:26.780 --> 3:36:32.460]  restaurants cook the food in um i don't even i mean i consider myself fairly health uh you know
[3:36:33.660 --> 3:36:38.460]  aware i didn't even realize that seed oils are like that bad right a lot of people are
[3:36:38.460 --> 3:36:41.500]  calling attention to this i know you've been calling attention to it for a long time and
[3:36:41.500 --> 3:36:47.260]  this is again just basically like you know corporate sludge that they sell just like the
[3:36:47.260 --> 3:36:51.980]  hydrofluorosalicylic acid that they dump into the water supply or it's just corporations basically
[3:36:51.980 --> 3:36:57.980]  saying oh this is now quote healthy so uh cities you need to buy this for most and dump it in your
[3:36:57.980 --> 3:37:04.700]  water supply yeah the seed oils are a huge one i mean this is a new invention the seed oils are
[3:37:04.700 --> 3:37:11.100]  all polyunsaturated fatty acids which are highly easily oxidized right any oil that is liquid at
[3:37:11.100 --> 3:37:16.620]  room temperature right that that comes from plant other than olive oil right olive oil is a lot of
[3:37:16.620 --> 3:37:22.860]  monounsaturated fatty acids in it um very low poofa in olive oil the poofa is the polyunsaturated
[3:37:22.860 --> 3:37:28.780]  fat and that is basically chemical sludge uh crisco it was a criminal invention that was
[3:37:28.780 --> 3:37:34.460]  marketed to people instead of butter instead of tallow instead of lard butter tallow lard these
[3:37:34.460 --> 3:37:38.780]  are animal fats these are saturated fats that are stable at room temperature that at high
[3:37:38.780 --> 3:37:45.260]  temperatures do not oxidize these are the fats that we should be focused on well i thought hold
[3:37:45.260 --> 3:37:51.740]  on Tristan i thought fats were bad for us and according to jimmy carter's food pyramid uh don't
[3:37:51.740 --> 3:37:58.540]  i need like 15 servings of grain as the basis of my food pyramid yeah exactly this this is the
[3:37:58.540 --> 3:38:04.540]  mistake that we've made as a culture we've been duped by industrial kibble suppliers right they
[3:38:04.540 --> 3:38:10.380]  want to sell you basically the equivalent of human pet food because that's what they want you to be
[3:38:10.380 --> 3:38:15.420]  human pets who are easily managed from the biological level on up and this is why a more meat based
[3:38:15.420 --> 3:38:22.060]  diet a carnivorous diet uh in a diet based on quality locally produced animal foods is going
[3:38:22.060 --> 3:38:26.220]  to result in better health first of all because it's these are the most easily digested foods
[3:38:26.220 --> 3:38:30.300]  they lack the toxic compounds that we find in so many of the mass produced plant foods not that
[3:38:30.300 --> 3:38:36.700]  plant foods are bad but many of us have damaged guts and are unable to handle a lot of legumes
[3:38:36.700 --> 3:38:41.420]  even a lot of you know nightshades many people do not handle and digest these foods well so when
[3:38:41.420 --> 3:38:46.460]  you remove the possible irritants from the diet and focus on the most easily digested foods which
[3:38:46.460 --> 3:38:51.580]  are animal foods you're not only getting everything your body needs but you're not giving it all the
[3:38:51.580 --> 3:38:56.380]  crap that it doesn't need and that it rejects these seed oils that people are eating those actually
[3:38:56.380 --> 3:39:00.780]  get integrated into our mitochondria they get integrated into our cell membranes and they make
[3:39:00.780 --> 3:39:07.580]  our cell membranes more prone to oxidation to destruction right and then that leads to inflammatory
[3:39:07.580 --> 3:39:13.820]  processes going wild throughout the body autoimmune conditions and just general you know obesity
[3:39:13.820 --> 3:39:21.900]  diabetes cancers right when they the these seed oils can greatly increase your risk of cancer
[3:39:21.900 --> 3:39:26.460]  the mechanisms mechanisms are well known this has been studied but of course these are profitable
[3:39:26.460 --> 3:39:33.100]  foods right uh guess guess what one of the the biggest the biggest exporter of sunflower seed
[3:39:33.100 --> 3:39:41.260]  oil in the world is president batman Zelensky's ukraine right i don't need i don't need any beef
[3:39:41.820 --> 3:39:47.100]  give me the beyond meat give me the soy burger right i don't i don't need a well you know that's
[3:39:47.100 --> 3:39:52.940]  funny that you said that because this this week i've seen multiple articles coming out uh about
[3:39:52.940 --> 3:39:58.540]  not just in regard to the bio labs but how there is evidence of or at least the russian
[3:39:58.540 --> 3:40:04.780]  government is claiming evidence of experimentation done by these bio labs and my assumption would be
[3:40:04.780 --> 3:40:09.580]  if this is quote the bread basket of the world right ukraine is the bread basket then i'm assuming
[3:40:09.580 --> 3:40:14.380]  that they're also doing genetic modification experimentation there as well and that would
[3:40:14.380 --> 3:40:18.780]  make sense with all of these you know pentagon funded bio bio labs there i'm sure they're doing
[3:40:18.780 --> 3:40:23.820]  gmo experimentation too and you know people are always asking you know why are you always wiping
[3:40:23.820 --> 3:40:28.060]  your eyes always snorting it's because i've got mega allergies dude you think it's my fault you
[3:40:28.060 --> 3:40:35.020]  think i wanted to have spurgatron level allergies spurgatron 5000 no bill gates was basically standing
[3:40:35.020 --> 3:40:39.740]  over my crib when i was born and he pretty much said i'll give him a bunch of acts i want him to
[3:40:39.740 --> 3:40:45.500]  get all the vaccines give him all the value and get his numbers down so i've been you know vaccinated
[3:40:45.500 --> 3:40:51.340]  by bill that's how i look at it and so that's why i have allergies that's why in order to treat allergies
[3:40:51.340 --> 3:40:56.220]  i resorted to the kind of diet that you're talking about because there is a connection between
[3:40:56.220 --> 3:41:01.900]  the gut biome and allergies and so uh you know again all of these things go together is the
[3:41:01.900 --> 3:41:07.500]  point right the foods that we're getting the water that we drink it's it's a binary weapon that's
[3:41:07.500 --> 3:41:13.340]  where you have two different compounds that come together to actually create the toxic effect
[3:41:13.340 --> 3:41:16.460]  or a lot of people don't know about that but a lot of the global elite books talk about
[3:41:16.460 --> 3:41:20.700]  binary weapons and uh you and i are going to get into when we come back with this uh
[3:41:21.420 --> 3:41:27.020]  this book that i've not yet covered so actually tristan stumbled upon a really relevant global
[3:41:27.020 --> 3:41:31.580]  elite books as you guys know we did the global elite book series where i lecture 350 to 60 of
[3:41:31.580 --> 3:41:37.340]  the writings of the elite themselves and one of those books he found from a rockefeller funded
[3:41:37.340 --> 3:41:45.100]  study slash researcher lily k is about the molecular vision of life and so we're going to
[3:41:45.100 --> 3:41:48.380]  look at that here in a minute but once you finish up tristan with what you want to say about
[3:41:49.340 --> 3:41:57.740]  big big ag big food and how it's not food right exactly i mean these these are biotech products
[3:41:57.740 --> 3:42:03.500]  and this does tie into the rockefeller foundation and what they call the new science of man right
[3:42:03.500 --> 3:42:07.420]  which is essentially eugenics right so they've degraded our immune systems you know nobody
[3:42:07.420 --> 3:42:11.660]  had freaking allergies to every type of grass like uh you know i mean i grew up with allergies as well
[3:42:11.660 --> 3:42:16.460]  that's why you're gonna you frequently see like white powder all over jay and my nose and that's
[3:42:16.460 --> 3:42:19.180]  that's from we were having to sniff and we have white powder all over our nose and our
[3:42:19.180 --> 3:42:23.900]  moustache is because of allergies for sure well the coating is the point that helps me breathe
[3:42:23.900 --> 3:42:29.260]  clearly right so and then you're uh you're basically down there in Panama or one of those
[3:42:29.260 --> 3:42:34.300]  countries where you're a drug lord so it's easy for you to get it but yeah exactly exactly so the
[3:42:34.300 --> 3:42:38.540]  foods we eat are important right so and a big shout out to my wife who has the the carnivore
[3:42:38.540 --> 3:42:43.820]  cookbook you can get that at the website primaledgehealth.com a lot of people when they go meat base
[3:42:43.820 --> 3:42:49.020]  they find that all of these little autoimmune things improve all right uh so we're going to go
[3:42:49.020 --> 3:42:52.780]  to the commercial break remember to go to the informer store get those health products that you
[3:42:52.780 --> 3:42:59.260]  need and don't go anywhere with your back anything of real quality anything of lasting durability anything
[3:42:59.260 --> 3:43:06.380]  that's really satisfying empowering and fulfilling it's going to be hard to attain and when it comes
[3:43:06.380 --> 3:43:13.980]  information boy is that true today we see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation
[3:43:13.980 --> 3:43:20.460]  great recent combine trying to collapse our society to build on tashes their their transhumanist
[3:43:20.460 --> 3:43:27.180]  nightmare vision suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and
[3:43:27.180 --> 3:43:33.420]  scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives their covid hysteria their world's
[3:43:33.420 --> 3:43:39.900]  going to end in 2030 carbon tax global warming bull all of it and none of it can succeed none of it
[3:43:39.900 --> 3:43:46.860]  can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gaslit and that's why truth comes
[3:43:46.860 --> 3:43:51.580]  with hard work and the research of diligence and that's why it's hard to share info wars links
[3:43:51.580 --> 3:43:57.180]  and band up with elix that's why we've got to share them now more than ever you deserve a deep

[3:45:55.420 --> 3:45:59.900]  micah california thanks for calling i think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain
[3:45:59.900 --> 3:46:05.420]  of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation the u.s. government
[3:46:05.420 --> 3:46:11.660]  gain of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research
[3:46:11.660 --> 3:46:17.100]  involving influenza mers and stars viruses there's nothing about stars like viruses and if the
[3:46:17.100 --> 3:46:21.420]  research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's when you come to a
[3:46:21.420 --> 3:46:25.980]  four-way intersection there's the stops done you stop you look both ways and then you proceed and
[3:46:25.980 --> 3:46:31.180]  so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function but they'll argue
[3:46:31.180 --> 3:46:36.060]  that this is actually characterization and qualification research though you know rand
[3:46:36.060 --> 3:46:39.820]  and others you know maybe Fauci was right they don't quite know what they're talking about calling
[3:46:39.820 --> 3:46:43.820]  it gain of function you know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's why he hasn't been arrested
[3:46:43.820 --> 3:46:48.460]  because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in
[3:46:48.460 --> 3:46:52.940]  the main definition it's still a gain of function they're making something deadly that spreads more
[3:46:52.940 --> 3:46:59.980]  easily to hurt people thank you mike we love you leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[3:46:59.980 --> 3:47:02.620]  world order it's alex jones
[3:47:08.940 --> 3:47:13.580]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your guest host j direb j's analysis you know i did
[3:47:13.580 --> 3:47:19.740]  a live stream last week over my youtube channel where i ranted about funko pops for like three
[3:47:19.740 --> 3:47:25.020]  hours i don't know if it's that long but uh it seemed to be a hit amongst the the audiences except
[3:47:25.020 --> 3:47:28.940]  for the soy boys they really they really got mad about that but uh the reason i did that was that
[3:47:28.940 --> 3:47:34.060]  i was at a bookstore and i noticed a bunch of soldiers came into the bookstore and of course
[3:47:34.060 --> 3:47:38.860]  as you know bookstores now aren't really bookstores they're basically toy stores because people don't
[3:47:38.860 --> 3:47:43.980]  read books they go and they play with toys and so i thought well these soldiers they must be
[3:47:43.980 --> 3:47:49.900]  heading to the von clausiewicz section to go study warfare techniques they must be going to read sun
[3:47:49.900 --> 3:47:57.180]  zoos art of war no no they went to the funko pops section to buy toys so uh you know if this is a
[3:47:57.180 --> 3:48:03.580]  foreign operation to weaken our troops to basically make them play with toys i mean now would be the
[3:48:03.580 --> 3:48:06.940]  time for the enemy armies to invade right i'm not calling for that i'm just making a joke but
[3:48:07.660 --> 3:48:13.900]  why one of the reasons that we've gotten to this just totally emasculated soyified culture
[3:48:13.900 --> 3:48:19.260]  right where people are literally obsessed with i mean when i was a kid it was like girls bought
[3:48:19.260 --> 3:48:29.660]  cabbage patch kid okay dudes didn't do this now middle aged men buy funko pops and they all smell
[3:48:29.660 --> 3:48:35.020]  like but i'm not joking like you go into a bookstore and it's like you're in a at a gaining
[3:48:35.020 --> 3:48:40.380]  convention like everybody smells like sweat and but it's disgusting and i'm not joking people
[3:48:40.380 --> 3:48:45.020]  think that's an exaggeration or go to a bookstore it's not it's all toys now right it's like a
[3:48:45.020 --> 3:48:50.700]  toys are us is what is what's replaced books so yeah there you go all of those dudes that's who
[3:48:50.700 --> 3:48:57.180]  you is in the bookstores now that's the troops by the way that's probably footage of the troops
[3:48:57.180 --> 3:49:05.260]  that uh were there collecting their funko pops and this was actually done as a scientific social
[3:49:05.260 --> 3:49:09.740]  engineering strategy i think that's what's really hard for most people to to grasp to comprehend
[3:49:09.740 --> 3:49:15.740]  and one of the ways that we can help to understand that methodology is through understanding the
[3:49:15.740 --> 3:49:19.980]  global elite books and so i want to get to that book that tristan came across which was which
[3:49:19.980 --> 3:49:25.260]  was an excellent find and it's it's the molecular vision of life can you tell us about this rock
[3:49:25.260 --> 3:49:31.740]  a feller research project and why this is such an insightful text into the global elite mindset
[3:49:31.740 --> 3:49:40.860]  yeah yeah jay so um this is actually a book by dr lily ek and she's an mit researcher she
[3:49:40.860 --> 3:49:44.620]  as far as i know was not funded by the rock a feller foundation but in fact was
[3:49:44.620 --> 3:49:50.460]  investigating the history of the rock a feller foundation and the formation of these uh kind
[3:49:50.460 --> 3:49:58.060]  of interdisciplinary studies type projects that led to essentially the entire field of molecular
[3:49:58.060 --> 3:50:04.780]  biology so wait a minute so is she is she one of their people or is she writing an expose
[3:50:05.820 --> 3:50:11.660]  no no she she wrote this as more of an academic report right she didn't mean this to be some
[3:50:11.660 --> 3:50:16.700]  sort of this isn't like a conspiracy theorist or anything she worked for mit and was studying the
[3:50:16.700 --> 3:50:22.860]  history of the rise of the new science of man and molecular biology it actually ended up inadvertently
[3:50:22.860 --> 3:50:30.940]  being a massive expose on the worldview the eugenics roots and the the funding mechanisms for social
[3:50:30.940 --> 3:50:37.580]  control and social engineering so she she came at this academically um but i mean she she published
[3:50:37.580 --> 3:50:43.020]  this in 1993 and this book it's called uh the molecular vision of life caltech the rock a
[3:50:43.020 --> 3:50:48.460]  feller foundation and the rise of the new biology it's a fascinating look at the history of the rise
[3:50:48.460 --> 3:50:53.420]  of what the rock a feller foundation called the new science of man and they wanted to engineer a new
[3:50:53.420 --> 3:50:59.420]  man by breaking man down to its his smallest components essentially down to the molecular level
[3:50:59.420 --> 3:51:09.980]  and what's fascinating is it talks about here on uh what's it like page uh page 273 how the
[3:51:09.980 --> 3:51:18.780]  messenger rna technology was the result of massive funding programs who coordinate universities the
[3:51:18.780 --> 3:51:25.580]  military right and the post world war two economy in order to fight communism and destroy the
[3:51:25.580 --> 3:51:30.860]  communes was the excuse but they needed international participation and uh the the new buzzword these
[3:51:30.860 --> 3:51:38.060]  days is public private partnerships the rock a feller foundation championed this they spearheaded
[3:51:38.060 --> 3:51:45.180]  this style of uh corporate uh and government projects working with universities and academia
[3:51:45.180 --> 3:51:51.820]  in order to engineer a new man now she talks about here on page 273 uh the development of the this
[3:51:51.820 --> 3:51:58.460]  huge breakthrough in what they call the chemical feat of synthesizing a heterogeneous messenger
[3:51:58.460 --> 3:52:05.260]  rna by 1965 the representation of heterocatalysis in terms of a genetic code had been completed
[3:52:05.260 --> 3:52:10.700]  the transcriptional specifications for all the amino acids were on paper and in theory molecular
[3:52:10.700 --> 3:52:17.580]  biology had the cognitive apparatus for direct genetic intervention and for designing artificial
[3:52:17.580 --> 3:52:22.620]  life so remember when elon musk said you can basically turn a human into a butterfly using mrna
[3:52:23.420 --> 3:52:27.100]  then of course you know operation warp speed brought to us by fiser in the united states
[3:52:27.100 --> 3:52:33.260]  government the public private partnership in the war effort against the the virus right uh the war
[3:52:33.260 --> 3:52:38.380]  effort effort against the coup this is all the same modus operandi that was used by the rock
[3:52:38.380 --> 3:52:45.660]  a feller foundation to bring about new geomo food technologies to bring about new social sciences
[3:52:45.660 --> 3:52:53.420]  right in university the psychology psychiatry and the marriage between government pharmaceutical
[3:52:53.420 --> 3:52:59.980]  companies and the public and private sector it's the same exact modus operandi and she wrote in
[3:52:59.980 --> 3:53:06.460]  this book in 1993 about the breakthroughs that happened in the night in 1964 right they have been
[3:53:06.460 --> 3:53:13.180]  postulating that we can use mrna and injections and modification at the cellular level in order to
[3:53:13.180 --> 3:53:19.100]  transform man and mutate him to create whatever we want out of him yeah exactly that that was
[3:53:19.100 --> 3:53:23.740]  something that surprised me when i came across you know certain alternative media people who had
[3:53:23.740 --> 3:53:29.020]  been claiming that uh i heard that first about 10 years ago and i went and found the actual papers
[3:53:29.020 --> 3:53:35.580]  you can look up dr holger hyden's papers that he presented at the 1969 ca mind control conference
[3:53:35.580 --> 3:53:40.300]  yes that's real i'm making it up that's an actual conference they had out in i think san francisco
[3:53:40.300 --> 3:53:45.340]  bunch of doctors came a bunch of medical professionals a bunch of uh psychologists
[3:53:45.340 --> 3:53:50.620]  psyops people went and gave these lectures on controlling the mind and they shouldn't be surprising
[3:53:50.620 --> 3:53:55.900]  given the fact that dr jose delgado the famous mk ultra doctor actually wrote physical control of the
[3:53:55.900 --> 3:54:01.500]  mind right the guy who you know famously put the uh the electrodes in the in the brains of the bowls
[3:54:01.500 --> 3:54:08.140]  and whatnot yeah exactly um and by the way same publisher of uh you know all the jones salt books
[3:54:08.140 --> 3:54:11.980]  right so if you want if you're looking for the writings of the elite just look up the publisher
[3:54:11.980 --> 3:54:16.540]  of those books there they they publish all of them but um i say that to point out that in the
[3:54:16.540 --> 3:54:24.780]  holger hyden papers back from the 1960s he was talking about how the uh reversing the the genetics
[3:54:24.780 --> 3:54:30.940]  to make the men more feminine and the and the women more masculine so in the late 60s they
[3:54:30.940 --> 3:54:37.260]  already had that as a plan and it wasn't to create the uber mensch they're not doing it to make you
[3:54:37.260 --> 3:54:44.620]  into a superhero right you the marvel soyman are not being made into a hero they don't like you
[3:54:44.620 --> 3:54:50.140]  you're not the star of this show here you are slated to destruction in the same way that
[3:54:50.140 --> 3:54:55.420]  thanos snapped his fingers and depopulated the universe if you if you did happen to see the
[3:54:55.420 --> 3:55:01.580]  marvel avengers uh last a few installments right thanos depopulates he has this eugenics mindset
[3:55:01.580 --> 3:55:05.580]  which is odd that they put that in the film but he gets rid of half the beings in the universe
[3:55:05.580 --> 3:55:10.460]  because he believes you know something like depopulation anyway the point is that in the 1960s
[3:55:10.460 --> 3:55:16.380]  the holger hyden papers uh which are cited by arthur kessler in ghosts in the machine he says
[3:55:16.380 --> 3:55:23.260]  these are binary weapons where we will flip everybody's uh basically genetic code so that when
[3:55:23.260 --> 3:55:27.900]  the women become become more masculine and the men become more feminine the whole point of this
[3:55:27.900 --> 3:55:32.300]  is just to to depopulate so that they don't have offspring so it's an attack on the pp basically
[3:55:32.300 --> 3:55:42.540]  and the ovaries wow yeah well said man yeah there's a it's an attack on biology from the
[3:55:42.540 --> 3:55:48.940]  fundamental level and again these are these are reductionist materialists at least the uh at the
[3:55:48.940 --> 3:55:53.820]  lower levels at the universities the people who are studying this stuff so when you read somebody
[3:55:53.820 --> 3:55:59.100]  like dr hosea delgado the book physical control of the mind that jay was just talking about which
[3:55:59.100 --> 3:56:03.900]  i'm i don't know maybe like a third through this book kind of making my way through it slowly it
[3:56:03.900 --> 3:56:09.660]  is a fascinating look into the mind of absolute psychopaths right this guy basically said there
[3:56:09.660 --> 3:56:15.900]  is no reason to believe in human beings having an internal state at all all we care about is the
[3:56:15.900 --> 3:56:21.900]  physical manifestation in the uh in in the external world all we care about is they're all
[3:56:21.900 --> 3:56:27.580]  ranked materialists yes and that's a great point so the the presupposition that's that's running
[3:56:27.580 --> 3:56:32.940]  through the rockfiller foundation in terms of the molecular vision of life the attitude of big pharma
[3:56:32.940 --> 3:56:37.740]  is that human beings are just a collection of chemicals anyway so we can alter them to be
[3:56:37.740 --> 3:56:42.940]  what we want them to be in a domesticated way by just throwing chemicals at them right so mind
[3:56:42.940 --> 3:56:47.420]  control because the mind is the brain i mean that's the presupposition of hosea delgado and
[3:56:47.980 --> 3:56:54.460]  even all the behaviors watson uh jb watson pavlov all of those people had the assumption that

[3:57:03.980 --> 3:57:09.260]  look up the skinner box all funded by the rock fillers by the way because they view us as merely
[3:57:09.260 --> 3:57:15.100]  by a lot meat sacks we're just meat sacks that can be programmed or deprogrammed as we need so

[3:58:49.340 --> 3:58:54.860]  i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard doctor group
[3:58:54.860 --> 3:58:59.420]  on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival shield the x1
[3:58:59.420 --> 3:59:03.260]  and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that you had
[3:59:03.260 --> 3:59:06.860]  you know with a deep virgin source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and

[3:59:13.180 --> 3:59:18.220]  know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next
[3:59:18.220 --> 3:59:22.700]  couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements
[3:59:22.700 --> 3:59:27.580]  they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it literally

[3:59:31.660 --> 3:59:36.060]  we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way
[3:59:36.060 --> 3:59:41.260]  to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much
