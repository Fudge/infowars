[00:00.000 --> 00:09.600]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:09.600 --> 00:12.880]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12.880 --> 00:17.840]  Let's hear from Donald Trump, who is down with TPP, then Hillary.
[00:17.840 --> 00:19.880]  Hillary Clinton and her campaign.
[00:19.880 --> 00:26.000]  She's not a trade woman, you already have a trade war.
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.000]  Badly, badly.
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.600]  Kind of like him like that, even though it's an accident.
[00:30.600 --> 00:31.600]  She has it completely backwards.
[00:31.600 --> 00:36.120]  Hillary Clinton on a lease to trade war against the American worker when she supported one
[00:36.120 --> 00:38.320]  terrible deal after another.
[00:38.320 --> 00:42.440]  From NAFTA to China to South Korea, it doesn't matter.
[00:42.440 --> 00:47.960]  No matter where she went, the American worker was hurt.
[00:47.960 --> 00:54.880]  And you will be hurt worse than ever before if she becomes President of the United States.
[00:54.880 --> 01:02.000]  That I can tell you.
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.280]  A Trump administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the American people
[01:07.280 --> 01:09.160]  and the American worker.
[01:09.160 --> 01:13.160]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[01:13.160 --> 01:14.160]  It'll be over.
[01:14.160 --> 01:17.360]  May I just put this on a loop, just personally at home?
[01:17.360 --> 01:21.680]  I can't guarantee it because after me they'll probably start doing it again, but we will
[01:21.680 --> 01:27.840]  have four, maybe eight great productive years, and we'll never go back and we'll make sure
[01:27.840 --> 01:30.040]  we never go back.
[01:30.040 --> 01:36.320]  Plants have higher yields and cornfields are now starting to play down in front.
[01:36.320 --> 01:39.600]  I'm being sarcastic for the New York Times.
[01:39.600 --> 01:41.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:41.600 --> 01:45.520]  Well, actually, plants do go faster when you let them listen to Donald Trump, I'm going
[01:45.520 --> 01:46.520]  to be honest.
[01:46.520 --> 01:47.520]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[01:47.520 --> 01:48.520]  I appreciate it.
[01:48.520 --> 01:49.520]  Probably is true.
[01:49.520 --> 01:52.760]  But the majority will finally begin.
[01:52.760 --> 01:57.040]  America will be independent once more.
[01:57.040 --> 01:58.040]  Independent once more.
[01:58.040 --> 01:59.040]  Wow.
[01:59.040 --> 02:00.040]  That sounds great.
[02:00.040 --> 02:01.040]  Not run by foreign megabanks?
[02:01.040 --> 02:02.040]  That's racist.
[02:02.040 --> 02:09.640]  Under a Trump presidency, the American worker will finally have a president who will protect
[02:09.640 --> 02:12.520]  them and fight for them.
[02:12.520 --> 02:15.520]  By the way, folks, we don't normally carry a lot of Trump speeches because they were
[02:15.520 --> 02:16.520]  actually getting on the news.
[02:16.520 --> 02:19.360]  We will stand up to trade cheating.
[02:19.360 --> 02:23.200]  Now they're never playing, so we're going to start playing large portions every day.
[02:23.200 --> 02:26.520]  We will stand up to trade cheating.
[02:26.520 --> 02:34.320]  I'm going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not
[02:34.320 --> 02:36.320]  yet been ratified.
[02:36.320 --> 02:41.080]  You need to paint Trump in the Sistine Chapel.
[02:41.080 --> 02:46.920]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests.
[02:46.920 --> 02:50.040]  I'm not always gay when I am, but for a long time.
[02:50.040 --> 02:51.040]  Rape our country.
[02:51.040 --> 02:53.160]  Just a continuing rape of our country.
[02:53.160 --> 02:54.160]  That's what it is, too.
[02:54.160 --> 02:55.160]  It's a harsh word.
[02:55.160 --> 02:57.240]  It's a rape of our country.
[02:57.240 --> 03:03.840]  This is done by wealthy people that want to take advantage of us and that want to sign
[03:03.840 --> 03:04.840]  another partnership.
[03:04.840 --> 03:12.520]  So Hillary Clinton, not so long ago, said, this is the gold standard of trade packs,
[03:12.520 --> 03:13.520]  the gold standard.
[03:13.520 --> 03:15.640]  And she's down and saying, this is the gold standard.
[03:15.640 --> 03:19.480]  In fact, I saw it on television this morning, the gold standard.
[03:19.480 --> 03:25.320]  Then when I got involved, and I started pointing out all the flaws, especially the fact that
[03:25.320 --> 03:31.400]  monetary manipulation, currency manipulation, which is a primary tool that other countries
[03:31.400 --> 03:37.360]  use, especially China, to destroy our companies and to take our business, okay?
[03:37.360 --> 03:41.000]  It's not properly addressed and practically not even discussed at all.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.800]  And he's forcing it in.
[03:42.800 --> 03:49.520]  So it's fair to say that our economies are entwined, and we need to keep upping our gains,
[03:49.520 --> 03:56.480]  both bilaterally and with partners across the region, through agreements like the Trans-Pacific
[03:56.480 --> 03:59.480]  Partnership, or TPP.
[03:59.480 --> 04:01.400]  Australia is a critical partner.
[04:01.400 --> 04:09.480]  This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open trade, transfer, fair trade, the kind
[04:09.480 --> 04:16.600]  of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field, and when negotiated,
[04:16.600 --> 04:23.440]  this agreement will cover 40% of the world's total trade, and build in strong protections
[04:23.440 --> 04:28.200]  for workers and the environment.
[04:28.200 --> 04:33.080]  I'm translating live for you, like in Star Trek, I can decipher the alien language for
[04:33.080 --> 04:36.160]  you and actually give you what they're really saying and meaning.
[04:36.160 --> 04:37.160]  We'll be back, folks.
[04:37.160 --> 04:40.680]  I'll stop with the satire, but I've got to have some gallows humor up front at the start
[04:40.680 --> 04:43.280]  of the broadcast because this is going to be a big one.
[04:43.280 --> 04:47.160]  By the way, if you ask for brownies on the menu, you will have the police called on you.
[04:47.160 --> 04:49.400]  Shame on the word brownie is now racist.
[04:49.400 --> 04:51.800]  The police have been called.
[04:51.800 --> 04:53.840]  They have responded in Philly.
[04:53.840 --> 04:54.840]  Stay with us.
[04:54.840 --> 04:58.840]  You cannot make this up on Alex Jones, InfoWars, the doggo.
[04:58.840 --> 05:05.200]  No matter where he goes, they're one, two, and three, cause we're always together.
[05:05.200 --> 05:11.320]  As the three amigos of NAFTA, the presidentes of the US, Mexico, and Canada met today, Obama
[05:11.320 --> 05:17.760]  said Trump has worked against economic opportunity for workers and ordinary people, but the record
[05:17.760 --> 05:19.880]  of the last 20 years is clear.
[05:19.880 --> 05:24.080]  It is NAFTA that has worked against economic opportunity for ordinary people.
[05:24.080 --> 05:28.280]  The 22 years of NAFTA have been a giant sucking sound.
[05:28.280 --> 05:33.600]  One million US jobs lost, hundreds of millions paid to multinational corporations by investor
[05:33.600 --> 05:38.040]  state tribunals, and hundreds of billions in US trade deficits.
[05:38.040 --> 05:42.720]  Trump warned us about NAFTA as it was being created 30 years ago, and he has made a NAFTA
[05:42.720 --> 05:45.480]  exit a central issue of his campaign.
[05:45.480 --> 05:49.480]  But the three amigos think you're too stupid to know what they've done to you.
[05:49.480 --> 05:54.080]  These three clowns are just the latest globalist puppets with a song in dance to distract you
[05:54.080 --> 05:57.360]  while their globalist masters pick your pockets.

[06:57.120 --> 06:58.960]  Check it out for yourself today.
[06:58.960 --> 07:02.160]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[07:02.160 --> 07:03.520]  It took you over a year to do it.
[07:03.520 --> 07:05.240]  Why is this so good?
[07:05.240 --> 07:09.920]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[07:09.920 --> 07:14.560]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[07:14.560 --> 07:20.280]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[07:20.280 --> 07:23.600]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[07:23.600 --> 07:28.680]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[07:28.680 --> 07:29.960]  going on everywhere.
[07:29.960 --> 07:30.960]  These are all parasites.
[07:30.960 --> 07:33.680]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[07:33.680 --> 07:34.920]  You have the neem in there.
[07:34.920 --> 07:38.000]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.280]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[07:41.280 --> 07:42.280]  All right.
[07:42.280 --> 07:44.480]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[07:44.480 --> 07:47.480]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarsteam.com.
[07:47.480 --> 07:51.280]  Hey folks, you can't lose, it's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[07:51.280 --> 07:54.560]  And you support the broadcast, infowarsleif.com.
[07:54.560 --> 07:56.800]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[07:56.800 --> 08:05.760]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[08:05.760 --> 08:09.280]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[08:09.280 --> 08:12.080]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:12.080 --> 08:20.880]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time.
[08:20.880 --> 08:29.160]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down, sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[08:29.160 --> 08:35.960]  Go tell that long-tongued liar, go and tell that midnight writer, tell the rambler, the
[08:35.960 --> 08:41.920]  gambler, the back-fighter, tell him the God's gonna cut him down, tell him the God's gonna
[08:41.920 --> 08:42.920]  cut him down.
[08:42.920 --> 08:47.720]  Obama has come out in a statement and badmouthed populist movements in the United States and
[08:47.720 --> 08:53.960]  Europe, and that just made me think of Sunday, the German president, coming out and saying
[08:53.960 --> 08:57.880]  the elites are not the problem, the populations are the problem.
[08:57.880 --> 09:01.720]  And then that made me think of one of the top people at the Council on Foreign Relations
[09:01.720 --> 09:06.760]  that was established in 1922 at Pratt House, New York, openly by British Intelligence to
[09:06.760 --> 09:12.520]  establish an intelligence agency under a National Security Act that would create a silent dictatorship
[09:12.520 --> 09:13.720]  over the United States.
[09:13.720 --> 09:19.040]  That was affected, finally, in their main mission in 1947 with the National Security
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.480]  Act and the establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency, merging that with the
[09:23.480 --> 09:26.160]  1913 Private Fellow Reserve.
[09:26.160 --> 09:30.600]  They had a secret shadow government and the control of currency and credit.
[09:30.600 --> 09:35.640]  The British Empire had reconquered the United States.
[09:35.640 --> 09:42.400]  The victory of the 1780s had been reversed, but let's be clear, that's not the British
[09:42.400 --> 09:44.560]  people that are our enemy.
[09:44.560 --> 09:51.600]  It was the British Imperial shadow government model of Cecil Rhodes deployed and adopted
[09:51.600 --> 09:52.600]  here.
[09:52.600 --> 09:57.360]  It was more of a merger of the British Empire into the United States, but the same management
[09:57.360 --> 10:02.280]  techniques and they're now a merger with the European system and their oligarchs to establish
[10:02.280 --> 10:05.880]  a eugenics-based world government.
[10:05.880 --> 10:10.000]  And that's why we have, if you're a TV viewer, look at the arrogance of this person's face
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.560]  and just this classic look.
[10:12.560 --> 10:18.400]  So many of these billionaires and elitists are inbred, they are mentally ill, they have
[10:18.400 --> 10:19.920]  a lot of genetic problems.
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.720]  I don't care if they're Jewish in background, German in background, Chinese in background,
[10:24.720 --> 10:30.680]  Japanese in background, Russian in background, Spanish in background.
[10:30.680 --> 10:34.960]  Their eyes normally don't point in the same directions, that scene is a sign of elitism
[10:34.960 --> 10:35.960]  in England.
[10:35.960 --> 10:40.400]  If one eye points in another direction, and I'm not being mean to folks that have that
[10:40.400 --> 10:45.840]  genetic disorder from interbreeding, the Gypsies have that, the Romanovs have that a lot too.
[10:45.840 --> 10:49.760]  But you gotta have a lazy eye there, that scene is a, I mean if you have a lazy eye,
[10:49.760 --> 10:53.240]  you're gonna have the best private clubs, if you're wearing a tuxedo and got a lazy
[10:53.240 --> 10:59.520]  eye and you can't even hardly talk, like, who are you with, what club, you're like,
[10:59.520 --> 11:06.120]  oh good lord, come on in, I'm not kidding, I'm not joking.
[11:06.120 --> 11:11.800]  So, got an extra finger, you know, you're all good lord, so this is all about, in fact
[11:11.800 --> 11:17.280]  the British royal family even, the BBC has reported that it has another strand of DNA,
[11:17.280 --> 11:22.080]  not a double helix, but a triple helix, has a delicious little mutated something, they're
[11:22.080 --> 11:27.840]  not quite sure what it is, but the royalties sure what it is, and keeps that little antenna
[11:27.840 --> 11:31.720]  in the family to get those transmissions, they believe.
[11:31.720 --> 11:34.680]  Now continuing, CFR member calls on elites
[11:35.680 --> 11:39.920]  to rise up against ignorant masses.
[11:39.920 --> 11:43.220]  Wealthy air, the blooming dales chain,
[11:43.220 --> 11:47.600]  smears as populist voters who cherish values and tradition.
[11:47.600 --> 11:50.960]  And notice his eyes do not point same direction.
[11:50.960 --> 11:55.680]  He's in the club, the psycho interbred nutcase club.
[11:55.680 --> 11:57.240]  It doesn't mean everybody whose eyes point different
[11:57.240 --> 11:58.720]  directions is like that.
[11:58.720 --> 12:01.600]  Okay, it can be from damage or car wrecks or whatever.
[12:01.600 --> 12:03.440]  But with these guys, it's all the same.
[12:03.440 --> 12:06.680]  I call it the little twinkle of El Diablo.
[12:06.680 --> 12:08.320]  Look at Zuckerberg, everybody has the little
[12:08.320 --> 12:10.360]  twinkle of El Diablo.
[12:10.360 --> 12:14.960]  Continuing, in a column for Foreign Policy Magazine,
[12:14.960 --> 12:16.480]  where they openly announced world government
[12:16.480 --> 12:18.640]  and how they're chemtrailing us, how they run al-Qaeda,
[12:18.640 --> 12:20.400]  they just ride it like we're total idiots
[12:20.400 --> 12:21.980]  and it doesn't even matter.
[12:21.980 --> 12:23.780]  Because criminals always brag.
[12:23.780 --> 12:27.860]  But they tell you, it's a greater good.
[12:27.860 --> 12:30.100]  They're so intellectual, they understand,
[12:30.100 --> 12:31.780]  the injustice of the means.
[12:31.780 --> 12:33.300]  In a column for Foreign Policy,
[12:33.300 --> 12:34.420]  I'm going to cover this three days ago,
[12:34.420 --> 12:35.820]  I'm covering it now because it ties in everything.
[12:35.820 --> 12:39.140]  In a column for Foreign Policy Magazine,
[12:39.140 --> 12:43.860]  Council on Foreign Relations member, James Trobb,
[12:43.860 --> 12:46.740]  argues that the elite need to rise up,
[12:46.740 --> 12:50.580]  these are quotes against the mindlessly angry,
[12:50.580 --> 12:55.580]  ignorant masses in order to prevent globalization
[12:55.740 --> 12:58.420]  from being derailed by the populist revolt
[12:58.420 --> 13:03.420]  that has led to the Brexit and the rise of DJT or the Centipede.
[13:07.340 --> 13:09.260]  That's one of Trump's nicknames,
[13:09.260 --> 13:10.780]  the most fond of on the internet.
[13:11.780 --> 13:13.580]  And then we, those that support Trump
[13:13.580 --> 13:16.260]  are known as baby centipedes.
[13:16.260 --> 13:19.740]  I've coined the term Trumpkins, that's what I prefer.
[13:19.740 --> 13:23.380]  My children are Trumpkins, I'm not really a Trumpkin.
[13:23.380 --> 13:26.060]  But continuing, citing, here, let me read
[13:26.060 --> 13:28.780]  in a fake Atlantic elitist accent that was affected
[13:28.780 --> 13:31.140]  by the 20s when British intelligence made it popular
[13:31.140 --> 13:35.060]  in early, early talkies when those first came out.
[13:35.060 --> 13:37.420]  So you could really show you were in the in-club,
[13:37.420 --> 13:39.780]  you had to speak with a slight British accent,
[13:39.780 --> 13:41.260]  but that's what we've mutated into,
[13:41.260 --> 13:44.540]  a thirst and thirst and howl of third.
[13:44.540 --> 13:48.860]  Oh, boffy, lovey, which we like to buy
[13:48.860 --> 13:53.220]  some mining stock, Gilligan, perhaps some derivatives.
[13:53.220 --> 13:57.180]  Yeah, let me show you that I can talk like room here.
[13:57.180 --> 13:59.260]  Let me talk just like he does.
[14:00.860 --> 14:04.180]  Concerned that today's citizen revolt,
[14:04.180 --> 14:06.260]  see, I can talk like them too.
[14:06.260 --> 14:10.380]  In the United States, Britain and Europe may up in politics
[14:10.380 --> 14:12.740]  if nothing else has a lifetime,
[14:12.740 --> 14:16.660]  Troub notes that Britain and the Brexit was a quote,
[14:16.660 --> 14:21.660]  utter repudiation of bankers and economics.
[14:22.340 --> 14:25.580]  Know of mega five banks above the law,
[14:25.580 --> 14:29.060]  tax exempt, that have diplomatic immunity,
[14:29.060 --> 14:31.140]  that openly are funding, taking our guns,
[14:31.140 --> 14:34.380]  taking our property, shutting down local banks.
[14:34.380 --> 14:37.900]  The head of the Texas Banking Association four years ago,
[14:37.900 --> 14:41.340]  wrote a 18, 19 page giant article
[14:41.340 --> 14:43.140]  that was in the Austin Business Journal.
[14:43.140 --> 14:45.580]  I was just sitting there and I was at a restaurant
[14:45.580 --> 14:47.500]  waiting to pick up some food and she was, oh my God,
[14:47.500 --> 14:48.620]  did Alex Jones write this?
[14:48.620 --> 14:50.900]  And I found out it was in newspapers all over the state.
[14:50.900 --> 14:52.940]  And he was just saying, it's a global elite taking over,
[14:52.940 --> 14:54.420]  they're shutting down all the local banks,
[14:54.420 --> 14:55.820]  they're shutting down the credit unions,
[14:55.820 --> 14:56.940]  they're shutting down loans,
[14:56.940 --> 14:58.300]  they want to collapse on the economies,
[14:58.300 --> 15:00.060]  they can consolidate it, they're giving themselves
[15:00.060 --> 15:01.380]  the trillions in bailout money
[15:01.380 --> 15:03.340]  and not delivering it actually to the people
[15:03.340 --> 15:05.020]  so that we can loan it out.
[15:05.020 --> 15:06.300]  And then meanwhile, the average idiot
[15:06.300 --> 15:08.420]  thinks the bank down the street
[15:08.420 --> 15:10.300]  that's local or regional is their enemy
[15:10.300 --> 15:12.700]  when almost all of those are collapsing right now.
[15:12.700 --> 15:14.300]  But I digress.
[15:14.300 --> 15:18.460]  He just goes, they're just against civilization
[15:18.460 --> 15:22.700]  and in economics, we're speaking of economics here,
[15:22.700 --> 15:25.700]  something you little people don't know anything about.
[15:25.700 --> 15:30.100]  Well, let me see, 68% of the first two years of bailout
[15:30.100 --> 15:33.300]  was in the tens of trillions, not 800 and something billion.
[15:33.300 --> 15:37.460]  And it was given the vast majority, almost 70%,
[15:37.460 --> 15:41.580]  to foreign banks and still is secret to this day.
[15:41.580 --> 15:45.500]  And then almost none of it,
[15:47.020 --> 15:48.740]  less than 10%, look it up yourself,
[15:48.740 --> 15:51.980]  has ever actually been put into the economy and to the people.
[15:51.980 --> 15:53.740]  That's how they stopped too bad inflation.
[15:53.740 --> 15:56.620]  They go, oh, we're going to have unlimited free money
[15:56.620 --> 15:59.940]  for ourselves, but make sure that we don't spend it anywhere
[15:59.940 --> 16:03.100]  in the retail low level market.
[16:03.100 --> 16:05.980]  Don't make no, you don't get any of this money,
[16:05.980 --> 16:07.620]  it might inflate things.
[16:07.620 --> 16:11.100]  So yachts and real estate for the super rich inflate
[16:11.100 --> 16:12.260]  and that's where the inflation is,
[16:12.260 --> 16:13.420]  that's why it's stratospheric.
[16:13.420 --> 16:15.580]  But don't worry proletariat,
[16:15.580 --> 16:19.780]  we have confined it to luxury penthouses
[16:19.780 --> 16:23.820]  and 300 foot yachts and private floating cities
[16:23.820 --> 16:27.060]  and private airports and pleasure palaces
[16:27.060 --> 16:32.060]  and armored keeps, redoubts, fortresses, castles,
[16:34.420 --> 16:36.740]  or you could simply call them hideouts.
[16:36.740 --> 16:41.740]  Take your vaccines and drink your aspartame, they're there.
[16:42.900 --> 16:46.980]  Now there's a haze, just go to sleepy there.
[16:46.980 --> 16:48.580]  Yes, in all our white papers,
[16:48.580 --> 16:51.580]  we say we put fluoride in the water to dumb you down
[16:51.580 --> 16:53.980]  and we announce that we're in a war with you.
[16:53.980 --> 16:57.140]  But Pepsi for one year took aspartame out
[16:57.140 --> 16:59.500]  because of lawsuits and because no one was buying it,
[16:59.500 --> 17:01.780]  but they snuck it back in last week.
[17:01.780 --> 17:05.340]  Don't worry, drift away, drift away,
[17:05.340 --> 17:10.340]  enjoy the brain tumors and enjoy the baby flavoring.
[17:11.300 --> 17:14.860]  Now they take baby flavoring and then synthesize it
[17:14.860 --> 17:17.220]  into a synthetic baby flavoring,
[17:17.220 --> 17:22.220]  but they test the baby flavoring with a DNA cue
[17:22.700 --> 17:24.680]  that is fresh baby.
[17:25.620 --> 17:30.540]  So to be technical, your Pepsi and Pepsi products
[17:30.540 --> 17:34.020]  is baby flavoring, not baby.
[17:34.020 --> 17:36.860]  So, but tested by babies.
[17:36.860 --> 17:40.100]  But let me continue here, I'll be intellectual today
[17:40.100 --> 17:43.780]  and speak in this vernacular for you, how does that sound?
[17:43.780 --> 17:46.140]  Ah, continuing, citing the potential
[17:46.140 --> 17:48.260]  for a Trump to split the Republican party,
[17:48.260 --> 17:51.100]  even if he does lose an increasing unpopularity
[17:51.100 --> 17:52.740]  of France's socialist government,
[17:52.740 --> 17:55.740]  Trob argues, oh another billionaire for socialism,
[17:55.740 --> 17:57.780]  that establishment of political parties
[17:57.780 --> 18:01.740]  in major Western countries must combine forces
[18:01.740 --> 18:06.500]  to keep out the nationalist, that's a quote.
[18:06.500 --> 18:11.500]  We must combine forces, stop, we claim we just rule you
[18:15.140 --> 18:19.540]  and we're tax exempt and we do all these wonderful things
[18:19.540 --> 18:21.500]  like funding radical Islamists to come in
[18:21.500 --> 18:23.780]  and then you don't like us, but look,
[18:23.780 --> 18:27.580]  I'm standing on the street in my photo smiling arrogantly
[18:28.500 --> 18:31.720]  and that's what it's, and he's so-called elitist,
[18:31.720 --> 18:33.820]  they're a bunch of psychopaths and sociopaths,
[18:33.820 --> 18:36.180]  but they're not even that smart.
[18:36.180 --> 18:37.980]  They just have management systems
[18:37.980 --> 18:40.340]  that have been sputtering on for hundreds of years,
[18:40.340 --> 18:42.460]  dumbing everyone down and engaging
[18:42.460 --> 18:44.980]  in all this criminal activity and wrecking countries
[18:44.980 --> 18:48.020]  and wrecking economies so you can perch on top of them
[18:48.020 --> 18:51.060]  because you can't compete with prosperity.
[18:51.060 --> 18:54.020]  And then you misrepresent what we say about you trash.
[18:55.580 --> 18:57.580]  And guys like this, Rothkopf and others
[18:57.580 --> 18:59.780]  have been like, join us Alex, you're smart,
[18:59.780 --> 19:02.060]  come, you'll be very successful with us.
[19:02.060 --> 19:05.500]  And then later they just, you don't want to be with us
[19:05.500 --> 19:09.020]  because you go to Harvard and all these places
[19:09.020 --> 19:10.260]  and you work and work and work
[19:10.260 --> 19:11.980]  and I guess you're from the right family
[19:11.980 --> 19:14.940]  and you work 18 hours a day for years in some law firm
[19:14.940 --> 19:17.220]  and then finally they invite you to go play golf for them.
[19:17.220 --> 19:19.620]  They're like, judge Smills in Cadicek, he says,
[19:19.620 --> 19:21.540]  how would you like to come by, huh?
[19:21.540 --> 19:23.140]  And mow my lawn.
[19:23.140 --> 19:25.180]  And then after you've done that for another 10 years or so,
[19:25.180 --> 19:28.540]  maybe you marry one of their inner bread mentally ill
[19:28.540 --> 19:31.660]  daughters and put up with her crap.
[19:31.660 --> 19:34.220]  And then I guess you go in the steam room with dad
[19:34.220 --> 19:38.940]  and then service him with your father-in-law.
[19:38.940 --> 19:41.420]  And seriously folks, then you go to a little satanic ritual
[19:41.420 --> 19:43.380]  and then next you're at the mansion
[19:43.380 --> 19:46.140]  having some pedophile fun and Jerry Sandusky drops by
[19:46.140 --> 19:47.820]  and then you're in the club and they say,
[19:47.820 --> 19:50.420]  oh man, it's time to run you for Congress.
[19:50.420 --> 19:52.580]  That's right, we'll have you in in two years.
[19:54.080 --> 19:55.220]  I'm just hypothetically talking about
[19:55.220 --> 19:57.740]  the whole genre of these people, certainly not this guy.
[19:57.740 --> 19:58.900]  He's a wonderful person.
[20:00.260 --> 20:01.820]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[20:01.820 --> 20:03.700]  I'm a former 22 year congressman
[20:03.700 --> 20:05.980]  and Republican presidential candidate.
[20:05.980 --> 20:07.580]  I'm here to tell you about something
[20:07.580 --> 20:09.700]  that just might save your lives.
[20:09.700 --> 20:12.020]  You never know when there will be another Katrina
[20:12.020 --> 20:14.540]  and economic collapse or a serious drought.
[20:14.540 --> 20:16.240]  We should all have a little food storage
[20:16.240 --> 20:18.220]  that will carry us through tough times.
[20:18.220 --> 20:21.020]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[20:21.020 --> 20:24.400]  A U.S. company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance
[20:24.400 --> 20:26.340]  that can help you be prepared.

[22:06.700 --> 22:10.060]  disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramides
[22:10.060 --> 22:11.700]  and pharmaceuticals like statins,
[22:11.700 --> 22:13.340]  pain meds and antidepressants.
[22:13.340 --> 22:15.460]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped

[24:08.380 --> 24:11.020]  you're used to me.
[24:11.020 --> 24:13.980]  I'm the face that you have to face,
[24:13.980 --> 24:16.620]  you're in your stand.
[24:16.620 --> 24:19.380]  I'm what's left, I'm what's right.
[24:19.380 --> 24:20.500]  I'm the enemy.
[24:20.500 --> 24:22.140]  I'm the enemy.
[24:22.140 --> 24:25.100]  I'm the weapon that will take you down,
[24:25.100 --> 24:26.180]  and you to your...
[24:26.180 --> 24:27.260]  Who are you?
[24:27.260 --> 24:29.220]  So who are you?
[24:29.220 --> 24:30.820]  Who are you, folks?
[24:30.820 --> 24:33.140]  What's that, John?
[24:33.140 --> 24:35.100]  Got good will for people?
[24:35.100 --> 24:38.900]  Are you a bunch of vampires creeping around?
[24:38.900 --> 24:41.380]  Like a council on foreign relations,
[24:41.380 --> 24:45.140]  publishing articles,
[24:45.140 --> 24:47.900]  saying we must join forces against the people
[24:47.900 --> 24:50.060]  and bring in tyranny.
[24:50.060 --> 24:53.580]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[24:53.580 --> 24:55.260]  I don't want to kill on your red carpets,
[24:55.260 --> 24:57.140]  I don't want to fly around on your private jets,
[24:57.140 --> 24:58.060]  I don't want to sit there and hang out
[24:58.060 --> 24:59.940]  with a bunch of mummies.
[24:59.940 --> 25:01.860]  I want to be with the people that are alive.
[25:01.860 --> 25:04.500]  You're trying to kill spiritual.
[25:04.500 --> 25:06.420]  I want to see humanity rise.
[25:08.820 --> 25:10.220]  You are the pretenders.
[25:10.220 --> 25:11.820]  I will never surrender.
[25:12.980 --> 25:14.700]  All right, let me give you a smattering of the news.
[25:14.700 --> 25:16.340]  It's a big news day, obviously,
[25:16.340 --> 25:18.940]  and a lot of big guests joining us as well.
[25:18.940 --> 25:20.300]  We have the Secret Service agent
[25:20.300 --> 25:22.540]  who's valiantly exposed the bizarre behaviors
[25:22.540 --> 25:24.500]  and criminal behaviors going on inside
[25:24.500 --> 25:29.500]  the globalist infestation known as the White House.
[25:31.700 --> 25:33.580]  He says people need to know the real Hillary Clinton
[25:33.580 --> 25:35.180]  and how dangerous she really is.
[25:35.180 --> 25:36.740]  He calls her a dictator.
[25:36.740 --> 25:40.940]  That is coming up, Gary Byrne.
[25:42.540 --> 25:45.260]  We're working on getting Roger Stone on on short notice.
[25:45.260 --> 25:48.220]  There's so much stuff breaking on that front.
[25:48.220 --> 25:52.540]  I talked to some folks involved with the campaign
[25:52.540 --> 25:55.220]  and then I'm able to bounce that off stone.
[25:55.220 --> 25:57.420]  And he likes to be not pessimistic
[25:57.420 --> 25:59.180]  but likes to really low ball things.
[25:59.180 --> 26:01.020]  And he confirmed to me when I talked to him on Sunday,
[26:01.020 --> 26:02.540]  this wasn't off the record,
[26:02.540 --> 26:04.620]  but he said he was gonna wait till the polls
[26:04.620 --> 26:06.660]  started coming out and sure enough,
[26:06.660 --> 26:09.340]  they don't really release their own internal polls.
[26:09.340 --> 26:12.940]  Hillary does that or they have their friends do polls
[26:12.940 --> 26:15.540]  and then skew them and then she has them released
[26:15.540 --> 26:17.260]  and claims that they're independent.
[26:17.260 --> 26:20.220]  The Trump people, of course,
[26:20.220 --> 26:22.020]  have Ron Paul's former pollster.
[26:22.020 --> 26:24.060]  He's a libertarian and some other groups
[26:24.060 --> 26:25.100]  and they're doing real polls.
[26:25.100 --> 26:28.020]  They really wanna know real optics, what's going on.
[26:28.020 --> 26:30.660]  And what was it, three polls?
[26:30.660 --> 26:33.460]  He's basically margin of error, three points ahead,
[26:33.460 --> 26:35.780]  two points behind, basically dead heat.
[26:35.780 --> 26:37.380]  Several other big polls nationally.
[26:37.380 --> 26:39.300]  He is seven to 10 points ahead.
[26:39.300 --> 26:42.540]  That was this Sunday, internal Trump polling.
[26:43.420 --> 26:45.980]  And I know there's some infighting reportedly inside there
[26:45.980 --> 26:47.740]  about the fact that they're not releasing these,
[26:47.740 --> 26:49.700]  but whatever reason they're not.
[26:49.700 --> 26:52.340]  And then of course, I told you on Sunday that Trump,
[26:52.340 --> 26:53.860]  and I told you on Monday that Trump
[26:53.860 --> 26:55.940]  was in a dead heat or seven to 10 points ahead.
[26:55.940 --> 26:59.460]  That's now you notice coming out in separate polls
[26:59.460 --> 27:03.420]  by Rasmussen, by Gallup,
[27:03.420 --> 27:07.700]  a bunch of others, Rasmussen poll,
[27:07.700 --> 27:11.180]  Trump pulls ahead of Hillary, the tables have turned.
[27:11.180 --> 27:12.700]  And every time he takes the gloves off
[27:12.700 --> 27:14.900]  and savages her, she goes down.
[27:14.900 --> 27:18.180]  Now, understand folks, you're going to see polls out there
[27:18.180 --> 27:21.180]  with Jimmy Fallon or whoever having Hillary,
[27:21.180 --> 27:23.780]  I'm going, man, congratulations, you're 15 points ahead.
[27:23.780 --> 27:25.500]  He might say she's 300 points ahead.
[27:25.500 --> 27:26.940]  And you're like, well, that's impossible.
[27:26.940 --> 27:28.540]  She got 100% of the vote.
[27:28.540 --> 27:30.820]  She'd be in only 60% vote in national elections.
[27:30.820 --> 27:31.740]  That's impossible.
[27:31.740 --> 27:32.780]  That's my point.
[27:32.780 --> 27:35.020]  I mean, why not just have Jimmy Fallon or whoever
[27:35.020 --> 27:36.940]  just announce, oh, I hear you're 15 points ahead
[27:36.940 --> 27:40.500]  of that racist, bigot, homophobe, Donald Trump?
[27:40.500 --> 27:41.860]  I mean, none of it's true.
[27:43.540 --> 27:44.500]  None of it's true.
[27:46.460 --> 27:47.820]  In fact, if you get down to brass tax,
[27:47.820 --> 27:49.580]  he's economically conservative.
[27:50.980 --> 27:52.940]  He's very socially liberal folks.
[27:52.940 --> 27:54.660]  That's the truth about Donald Trump.
[27:54.660 --> 27:55.980]  He's a nationalist.
[27:55.980 --> 27:57.660]  I want the states to decide social stuff,
[27:57.660 --> 27:59.260]  the people to decide social stuff.
[27:59.260 --> 28:04.260]  Well, frankly, it's important to me, but that's not
[28:04.340 --> 28:06.380]  overall a president's job.
[28:06.380 --> 28:08.540]  I mean, what they do personally in their life is an example,
[28:08.540 --> 28:10.740]  but it's the states, as Ron Poles always said.
[28:10.740 --> 28:11.940]  So it's not on my radar.
[28:12.900 --> 28:15.060]  He's a very moral person, though, when it comes to courage
[28:15.060 --> 28:16.340]  and God hates a coward.
[28:19.100 --> 28:20.780]  And so that's why I admire Donald Trump,
[28:20.780 --> 28:25.140]  but he is ahead in a lot of polls.
[28:25.140 --> 28:28.140]  These are scientific polls or he's in a dead heat.
[28:28.140 --> 28:31.820]  The tables have turned, well, that's a Rasmussen article.
[28:31.820 --> 28:33.500]  They haven't turned.
[28:33.500 --> 28:35.580]  He's been ahead of Hillary the whole time.
[28:36.660 --> 28:37.780]  You've heard the callers call in
[28:37.780 --> 28:38.980]  and you've seen the examples.
[28:38.980 --> 28:40.060]  Callers go, it's incredible.
[28:40.060 --> 28:41.700]  I saw a story and now I can't search for it
[28:41.700 --> 28:42.860]  about Hillary and her crimes.
[28:42.860 --> 28:44.340]  Google admits they're censoring.
[28:44.340 --> 28:46.140]  They've been caught doing it.
[28:46.140 --> 28:48.780]  Facebook admits they've been caught doing it.
[28:48.780 --> 28:49.620]  People just can't believe it.
[28:49.620 --> 28:50.900]  They're like, Alex, Alex, they're censoring.
[28:50.900 --> 28:52.100]  Yes, I know.
[28:52.100 --> 28:54.500]  So we need to let everybody else know what's going on.
[28:55.500 --> 28:57.580]  But just tell other people it's an illusion
[28:57.580 --> 29:00.060]  to make you feel like if you're supporting Trump,
[29:00.060 --> 29:01.780]  you're a loser so that you may be go,
[29:01.780 --> 29:03.300]  okay, well, I want to bet on a winner.
[29:03.300 --> 29:05.060]  It's a well-known phenomenon in football
[29:05.060 --> 29:08.660]  or other sports hockey where if a team is looking
[29:08.660 --> 29:09.580]  like it's going to go on the playoff,
[29:09.580 --> 29:10.940]  suddenly they start selling more jerseys,
[29:10.940 --> 29:14.260]  more hats, selling more tickets, more hot dogs, more beer.
[29:14.260 --> 29:17.420]  But suddenly they have a big upset and lose.
[29:17.420 --> 29:20.260]  Well, people will just jump and stop wearing those jerseys
[29:20.260 --> 29:22.020]  and just go out and buy the other team's jerseys.
[29:22.020 --> 29:24.100]  They want to be associated with a winner.
[29:24.100 --> 29:27.820]  And yeah, it's kind of if you're associated
[29:27.820 --> 29:31.140]  with a winning family or you're associated with a winning,
[29:31.140 --> 29:34.100]  or your man married, a powerful woman or vice versa,
[29:34.100 --> 29:34.940]  then that matters.
[29:34.940 --> 29:37.420]  But being associated with a, quote, winning team,
[29:37.420 --> 29:38.700]  it's all just delusional.
[29:38.700 --> 29:40.180]  And it's the same thing with Hillary.
[29:40.180 --> 29:41.900]  Cause you're a chump if you vote for Hillary.
[29:41.900 --> 29:43.180]  You're an idiot, you're a moron.
[29:43.180 --> 29:44.540]  She's laughing at you.
[29:44.540 --> 29:48.780]  I mean, she is an absolute criminal psychopathic dirt bag.
[29:48.780 --> 29:49.620]  Stay with us.
[29:49.620 --> 29:53.460]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:53.460 --> 29:56.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.300 --> 30:02.900]  We all know that drinking enough water is essential
[30:02.900 --> 30:04.740]  for the body to function properly.
[30:04.740 --> 30:06.500]  But you might not know that drinking water
[30:06.500 --> 30:09.580]  at the correct time increases its effectiveness.
[30:09.580 --> 30:12.220]  Drinking two glasses of water right when you wake up
[30:12.220 --> 30:14.380]  helps to activate your internal organs,
[30:14.380 --> 30:17.940]  flushing out toxins and waste, and speeding your metabolism.
[30:17.940 --> 30:21.820]  Drink water 30 minutes before a meal to aid in digestion.
[30:21.820 --> 30:23.980]  And it also helps you feel fuller if you're trying
[30:23.980 --> 30:24.820]  to lose weight.
[30:24.820 --> 30:26.940]  However, you should avoid drinking while eating
[30:26.940 --> 30:29.660]  because the fluids will dilute your digestive juices.
[30:29.660 --> 30:32.500]  Feeling hungry, sluggish, or have a headache?
[30:32.500 --> 30:34.700]  You should always pour yourself a tall glass
[30:34.700 --> 30:36.540]  of fresh drinking water first,
[30:36.540 --> 30:38.780]  as these are signs of dehydration.
[30:38.780 --> 30:41.060]  Drinking a glass of water before bed
[30:41.060 --> 30:44.020]  helps the cellular renewal process while you sleep,
[30:44.020 --> 30:46.420]  and it could even prevent stroke or heart attack.
[30:46.420 --> 30:48.780]  Proper hydration will boost your brain,
[30:48.780 --> 30:49.940]  improve your moods,
[30:49.940 --> 30:52.660]  and give you better physical performance overall.
[30:52.660 --> 30:55.780]  So stay hydrated, my friends, and stay healthy.
[30:55.780 --> 30:58.700]  This is Leanne McAdoo with your InfoWars tip of the week.
[31:00.220 --> 31:01.900]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[31:01.900 --> 31:03.380]  You can't survive without it.
[31:03.380 --> 31:04.540]  But where do you get it?
[31:04.540 --> 31:07.460]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking

[31:09.460 --> 31:10.580]  that is like no other.
[31:10.580 --> 31:12.860]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water

[31:14.620 --> 31:16.460]  into clean, healthy drinking water,
[31:16.460 --> 31:19.180]  pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power
[31:19.180 --> 31:20.980]  of an all-new gravity block core.
[31:20.980 --> 31:22.700]  With a hybrid chromatic shell,
[31:22.700 --> 31:26.940]  it removes up to 99.999% of impurities,
[31:26.940 --> 31:29.780]  including bacteria, viruses, fluoride,
[31:29.780 --> 31:33.700]  disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[31:33.700 --> 31:36.100]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons,

[31:38.700 --> 31:40.500]  low maintenance, replacement filters

[33:09.540 --> 33:10.660]  This is a fun song.
[33:10.660 --> 33:13.260]  You're driving war on corruption in the desert.

[33:16.140 --> 33:18.820]  on the front lines of the Info War.
[33:18.820 --> 33:20.180]  Whoo!
[33:20.180 --> 33:22.460]  You're out driving in the desert,
[33:22.460 --> 33:24.700]  big long straightaways in West Texas,
[33:25.860 --> 33:28.340]  high desert of California and Elada,
[33:29.780 --> 33:30.620]  and you
[33:33.460 --> 33:34.620]  lean your seat back,
[33:38.660 --> 33:41.100]  switch the gear down,
[33:42.460 --> 33:43.500]  fifth gear to fourth gear,
[33:43.500 --> 33:46.460]  seventh gear to sixth gear,
[33:46.460 --> 33:47.300]  hear that engine.
[33:47.300 --> 33:48.140]  Whoo!
[33:49.140 --> 33:51.780]  Superchargers coming to effect.
[33:51.780 --> 33:54.220]  780 horsepower at your disposal.
[33:55.300 --> 33:56.140]  That's living.
[34:00.940 --> 34:03.220]  But that's what human freedom is about.
[34:03.220 --> 34:04.620]  Being able to put yourself at risk,
[34:04.620 --> 34:05.940]  being able to go to the edge,
[34:05.940 --> 34:07.900]  that's where you expand your mind,
[34:07.900 --> 34:09.700]  expand your neurons.
[34:09.700 --> 34:11.220]  It's where you join really
[34:11.220 --> 34:16.220]  your people, your ancestors in all the bold things they did.
[34:17.180 --> 34:18.660]  But we shouldn't risk our lives
[34:18.660 --> 34:20.780]  on just cheap thrills or fun.
[34:22.340 --> 34:25.420]  All of us are guilty of it at a certain extent.
[34:25.420 --> 34:27.740]  We're meant to have those instincts and those drives
[34:27.740 --> 34:30.620]  to dare greatly and to stand up against bad people.
[34:33.900 --> 34:38.660]  And it's the failure to face down these demons
[34:38.660 --> 34:40.780]  that has brought us to the state we're at now,
[34:40.780 --> 34:42.780]  and you see civilization society
[34:42.780 --> 34:47.780]  drifting towards societal collapse and oblivion.
[34:47.820 --> 34:49.460]  Later in the broadcast, I'm not sure when,
[34:49.460 --> 34:50.300]  but I will air it,
[34:50.300 --> 34:52.780]  there is a special report that Rob Do took about two,
[34:52.780 --> 34:55.620]  three days to edit together with clips and documentation
[34:55.620 --> 34:57.420]  where I really break down the globalist plan
[34:57.420 --> 34:58.460]  to use food as a weapon
[34:58.460 --> 35:01.380]  and trigger a worldwide financial collapse
[35:01.380 --> 35:04.340]  to try to terrorize the population back into submission.
[35:04.340 --> 35:08.700]  And when you actually hear what the head of the EU says
[35:08.700 --> 35:10.940]  and the deputy head and the German chancellor
[35:10.940 --> 35:12.700]  and the German president,
[35:12.700 --> 35:13.700]  and when you actually hear
[35:13.700 --> 35:16.580]  what the council on farm relations is saying,
[35:16.580 --> 35:21.220]  and Obama, when you see everything that they're pushing
[35:21.220 --> 35:23.140]  and everything that they're engaged in,
[35:28.100 --> 35:30.820]  it's amazing because they're actually saying,
[35:33.940 --> 35:34.940]  and we've got their quotes,
[35:34.940 --> 35:35.780]  we've got the articles,
[35:35.780 --> 35:37.020]  we've got the statements in the video.
[35:37.020 --> 35:39.500]  In fact, the video is now on infowars.com.
[35:39.500 --> 35:41.060]  We can put it up on screen for TV viewers,
[35:41.060 --> 35:42.220]  I can give you the headline
[35:42.220 --> 35:43.620]  that I was going from memory,
[35:43.620 --> 35:45.020]  give you the actual headline.
[35:49.220 --> 35:50.780]  There it is, globalists intend to use food
[35:50.780 --> 35:52.620]  as key weapon in world takeover.
[35:52.620 --> 35:53.460]  Yeah.
[35:54.820 --> 35:56.300]  That's not a sensational headline.
[35:56.300 --> 35:58.060]  That's really what they say they're doing.
[35:58.060 --> 35:59.460]  It's amazing.
[36:01.220 --> 36:03.860]  Look at these quotes out of council on farm relations.
[36:03.860 --> 36:06.940]  Farm policy magazine,
[36:09.660 --> 36:12.260]  where they talk about the Brexit being a quote,
[36:12.260 --> 36:14.700]  utter repudiation of bankers and economists,
[36:14.700 --> 36:17.660]  an example of how extremism has gone mainstream
[36:17.660 --> 36:22.260]  and how they must quote combined forces to stop us
[36:23.220 --> 36:25.020]  and stop today's citizen revolt
[36:25.020 --> 36:26.820]  in the United States, Britain, Europe,
[36:28.900 --> 36:30.540]  where we may up in politics
[36:30.540 --> 36:34.380]  and nothing else has in his lifetime.
[36:34.380 --> 36:37.180]  And they go on to talk about how to control us
[36:39.580 --> 36:43.100]  with our incomes and with our growth rate.
[36:43.100 --> 36:44.860]  As if, oh, if you don't let us run things,
[36:44.860 --> 36:45.700]  things are gonna get bad
[36:45.700 --> 36:49.140]  when their own stated goals are a post-industrial world
[36:49.140 --> 36:51.900]  where we work for less, have less pay higher taxes
[36:51.900 --> 36:56.900]  to live in a 220 foot square foot coffin apartment
[36:56.980 --> 36:59.140]  that costs more than 1,000 square foot.
[36:59.140 --> 37:00.380]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[37:00.380 --> 37:01.860]  They admit their program
[37:01.860 --> 37:04.620]  and they just think you're too stupid to go figure it out.
[37:04.620 --> 37:06.660]  Well, even folks that don't wanna be informed,
[37:06.660 --> 37:08.700]  as they start to lose everything,
[37:08.700 --> 37:10.900]  they're going to go and find out who's done it
[37:10.900 --> 37:13.580]  and they're gonna find out it's people like you.
[37:16.220 --> 37:19.620]  James Trobb, that are guilty.
[37:21.340 --> 37:22.700]  What is the sentence?
[37:22.700 --> 37:29.700]  Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.
[37:29.700 --> 37:32.220]  We sentence you to the phantom zone.
[37:34.940 --> 37:36.300]  I wish we could do that.
[37:37.740 --> 37:40.460]  It's like hell, just go be with people like yourself.
[37:43.220 --> 37:44.940]  What is the sentence?
[37:47.140 --> 37:47.980]  Guilty.
[37:47.980 --> 37:52.980]  Guilty. And their arrogance convicts them.
[37:54.340 --> 37:56.380]  Public statements.
[37:56.380 --> 37:57.460]  German president.
[37:57.460 --> 37:59.340]  The elites are not the problem, this is a quote.
[37:59.340 --> 38:00.980]  The elites are not the problem.
[38:00.980 --> 38:02.900]  The populations are the problem.
[38:03.860 --> 38:05.300]  And then what do they recommend they use?
[38:05.300 --> 38:08.700]  Same thing, they need to keep you out of the Brexit.
[38:10.900 --> 38:13.900]  The economy will implode, you'll all be homeless.
[38:13.900 --> 38:17.100]  You need us, we run everything.
[38:17.100 --> 38:20.420]  Submit us, we'll bring you to your knees.
[38:21.700 --> 38:24.100]  They'll bring you to your knees
[38:24.100 --> 38:27.940]  if you let the boa constrictor that's wrapped around you
[38:27.940 --> 38:28.980]  maintain control.
[38:28.980 --> 38:31.900]  We figured out it was a boa constrictor.
[38:31.900 --> 38:33.020]  It's hissing in your ear saying,
[38:33.020 --> 38:35.700]  there's no global government, there's no tyranny,
[38:35.700 --> 38:37.220]  there's no problem, and you're like,
[38:37.220 --> 38:38.620]  okay, boy, it's hard to breathe though,
[38:38.620 --> 38:40.620]  just go to sleep, it tells you in your ear
[38:40.620 --> 38:41.820]  as it's wrapped around you.
[38:41.820 --> 38:43.500]  And the patriots are there going,
[38:43.500 --> 38:48.500]  no, it's a boa constrictor, the patriots are a little angel
[38:48.500 --> 38:51.700]  on our collective shoulder, no, it's a boa constrictor.
[38:51.700 --> 38:54.100]  See it, spot, see it, are you having trouble breathing?
[38:54.100 --> 38:56.260]  That's a snake tongue coming out, looking your face,
[38:56.260 --> 38:58.540]  it's not kissing you, it's getting ready to crush you
[38:58.540 --> 38:59.380]  and eat you.
[38:59.380 --> 39:04.380]  And so, but the snake says if I resist, it'll eat me.
[39:04.860 --> 39:07.140]  It's already eating you sweetheart.
[39:09.380 --> 39:10.340]  It's a snake.
[39:12.100 --> 39:13.380]  What did Donald Trump say?
[39:13.380 --> 39:15.420]  We've surrendered, Hillary's a foreign agent
[39:15.420 --> 39:16.940]  of the Chinese that run the trade war.
[39:16.940 --> 39:19.580]  Total veritas, total honor, total courage.
[39:19.580 --> 39:21.700]  I mean, I guarantee you, Hillary Clinton throws fits
[39:21.700 --> 39:23.540]  when a newspaper writes a bad article about her
[39:23.540 --> 39:25.380]  or she sees a YouTube video making fun of her.
[39:25.380 --> 39:30.380]  Can you imagine that veritable witch creature,
[39:32.540 --> 39:36.700]  the witch bitch, can you imagine the convulsions
[39:36.700 --> 39:37.860]  she's having right now?
[39:38.740 --> 39:42.340]  And so she just peacocks that crazy Joker face,
[39:42.340 --> 39:45.620]  like all the time she looks completely nuts.
[39:45.620 --> 39:48.100]  I think Hillary, I'm serious, I think she may go
[39:48.100 --> 39:49.860]  completely insane before the election.
[39:51.780 --> 39:54.340]  And I think we all, metaphysical's real folks,
[39:54.340 --> 39:57.700]  we should all pray for justice against Hillary Clinton.
[39:57.700 --> 40:00.020]  We should all ask God to lead God and direct us
[40:00.020 --> 40:02.940]  and just help us together, focus our wills
[40:02.940 --> 40:04.140]  against Hillary Clinton.
[40:07.900 --> 40:09.740]  What we all need to do, my friends,
[40:09.740 --> 40:14.140]  that means politically at every level
[40:14.140 --> 40:16.380]  and spiritually and culturally and economically,
[40:16.380 --> 40:18.420]  this is a war.
[40:18.420 --> 40:21.340]  You don't lose engaging in this war,
[40:21.340 --> 40:25.260]  you spread your wings, you begin to truly live.
[40:25.260 --> 40:26.660]  I know our audience already knows that,
[40:26.660 --> 40:28.940]  but I'm talking to new viewers.
[40:28.940 --> 40:30.620]  And we're starting to see a lot of control leftist,
[40:30.620 --> 40:32.260]  a lot of control right wing folks,
[40:32.260 --> 40:34.340]  high level editors, the major newspaper,
[40:34.340 --> 40:37.100]  major publications are calling me up and apologizing.
[40:37.100 --> 40:38.260]  It's been happening the last decade,
[40:38.260 --> 40:41.100]  but it's epidemic now, saying,
[40:41.100 --> 40:43.380]  oh my God, it's all real, it's really happening.
[40:43.380 --> 40:44.940]  I just met with a bunch of current generals
[40:44.940 --> 40:46.340]  and they said, listen to Alex Jones,
[40:46.340 --> 40:47.820]  he knows what's going on.
[40:47.820 --> 40:48.860]  This is the truth.
[40:48.860 --> 40:50.380]  We can't tell you what's going on,
[40:50.380 --> 40:52.820]  it's all classified, listen to him.
[40:52.820 --> 40:55.900]  And by the way, I wanna say something.
[40:55.900 --> 40:57.780]  We've had everybody on from Psy Hirsch
[40:57.780 --> 41:00.460]  to Daniel Ellsberg of the Pentagon Papers
[41:00.460 --> 41:05.460]  to Colonel Schaefer to former KGB folks
[41:05.460 --> 41:09.860]  that are whistleblowers to, I mean, you name it,
[41:09.860 --> 41:11.060]  Charlton has in the whole nine yards.
[41:11.060 --> 41:12.340]  I mean, we've interviewed the people
[41:12.340 --> 41:13.980]  that write the biological weapons treaties.
[41:13.980 --> 41:15.980]  And we've had, you know, people on
[41:15.980 --> 41:17.700]  that were the roommates of Mitt Romney.
[41:17.700 --> 41:19.260]  I mean, we've just had everybody on.
[41:19.260 --> 41:21.700]  We've looked at every angle basically.
[41:21.700 --> 41:23.020]  But let me continue to look at the new angles
[41:23.020 --> 41:24.380]  that come up from different perspectives,
[41:24.380 --> 41:26.140]  but we've looked at a lot of angles, okay?
[41:26.140 --> 41:27.060]  I don't wanna say every angle,
[41:27.060 --> 41:29.500]  but more angles than probably anybody else ever has.
[41:29.500 --> 41:31.100]  Because most people that are in the CIA
[41:31.100 --> 41:32.340]  or different analyst agencies,
[41:32.340 --> 41:35.020]  they kinda study one little discipline
[41:35.020 --> 41:36.940]  because they wanna be the experts on that, okay?
[41:36.940 --> 41:39.380]  We are organic human intelligence
[41:39.380 --> 41:41.100]  against the new world order.
[41:41.100 --> 41:43.860]  And so I study everything, wide spectrum.
[41:43.860 --> 41:48.860]  And the globalists are failing,
[41:51.420 --> 41:53.020]  the globalists are falling apart,
[41:53.020 --> 41:54.420]  the globalists are a joke.
[41:54.420 --> 41:55.820]  That's why they claim,
[41:55.820 --> 41:58.660]  oh, we're collapsing everything to build on its ashes.
[41:58.660 --> 42:02.060]  That's true at a way because they help grease the skids
[42:02.060 --> 42:04.900]  but insulate themselves with the last man standing scenario.
[42:04.900 --> 42:06.980]  But the truth is they can't manage anything
[42:06.980 --> 42:09.100]  and they screw everything up
[42:09.100 --> 42:11.140]  and their spirit is destructiveness.
[42:11.140 --> 42:14.740]  So they just claim they are deploying destruction,
[42:16.180 --> 42:18.780]  command destruction to rebuild something on it
[42:18.780 --> 42:22.060]  to hide their spiritual ineptitude.
[42:22.900 --> 42:25.660]  Because the devil is never a maker.
[42:25.660 --> 42:28.740]  The less that they give, they're a taker.
[42:28.740 --> 42:31.780]  And it goes on and on, on and on and on.
[42:31.780 --> 42:36.780]  And they'll tell you that the moon is just the sun at night.
[42:40.660 --> 42:43.100]  And when you walk in golden halls,
[42:43.980 --> 42:46.740]  they'll tell you you can keep all the gold at falls.
[42:51.220 --> 42:53.540]  Quoting some poetry, I forget who wrote it.
[42:53.540 --> 42:56.820]  CFR member calls on a leech to rise up
[42:56.820 --> 42:59.300]  against ignorant masses.
[42:59.300 --> 43:01.620]  Wealthy air to Bloomingdale's chain.
[43:01.620 --> 43:05.140]  I always love how it's some fourth generation phop
[43:05.140 --> 43:07.540]  whose eyes don't even point the right direction
[43:07.540 --> 43:10.260]  to snuggling around, groveling like,
[43:10.260 --> 43:12.140]  we've got to take their rights.
[43:12.140 --> 43:13.500]  We've got to show them who's boss.
[43:13.500 --> 43:17.900]  Yeah, we've got to, I'm so cuckold.
[43:17.900 --> 43:19.540]  Let's bring in a bunch of radical Muslims
[43:19.540 --> 43:21.300]  to come in and blow everything up and shoot everything up
[43:21.300 --> 43:24.500]  and we'll take the general public's freedoms away.
[43:24.500 --> 43:26.820]  And we've got to have a war against common knowledge
[43:26.820 --> 43:28.300]  and common sense.
[43:28.300 --> 43:31.140]  So let's not let anybody say all these attacks are Islamic.
[43:31.140 --> 43:33.020]  I mean, no one's saying they're Islamic now.
[43:33.020 --> 43:34.380]  Look at this mirror story,
[43:34.380 --> 43:36.140]  they usually at least admit it's Islamic.
[43:36.140 --> 43:39.460]  Killing pictures of smiling Istanbul airport suicide bombers,
[43:39.460 --> 43:41.300]  seconds from death mission
[43:41.300 --> 43:43.180]  as police fear another attack imminent.
[43:44.900 --> 43:47.300]  Never is it Islamic, never.
[43:47.300 --> 43:48.940]  I mean, you know, a group of Boy Scouts went
[43:48.940 --> 43:49.860]  and did it to be Boy Scouts,
[43:49.860 --> 43:51.540]  sort of a group of right wingers, a group of,
[43:51.540 --> 43:54.380]  but no, this is just this talking point.
[43:54.380 --> 43:56.220]  You will not say it's Islamic.
[43:56.220 --> 43:59.600]  That is so authoritarian that the media is so controlled.
[43:59.600 --> 44:04.600]  You know, they tell us, don't use this word.
[44:05.760 --> 44:07.720]  This is now the proper word to use.
[44:07.720 --> 44:09.480]  People go, okay, I will now dutifully use
[44:09.480 --> 44:11.440]  whatever words you tell me in terms.
[44:11.440 --> 44:14.560]  What type of cult did the West become?
[44:14.560 --> 44:17.520]  Since when did I wake up in a lunatic asylum?
[44:19.880 --> 44:21.520]  Since when did I wake up at some, you know,
[44:21.520 --> 44:25.840]  Eastern ashram, you know, in the 60s going,
[44:25.840 --> 44:28.680]  you know, chanting until my brain is gone,
[44:28.680 --> 44:32.080]  you know, before some weirdo with an eight foot beard.
[44:34.120 --> 44:36.680]  But instead it's Obama and Hillary hopping around.
[44:36.680 --> 44:38.720]  It's a total joke.
[44:41.280 --> 44:42.680]  But as I said earlier,
[44:42.680 --> 44:44.120]  let me just go through a bunch of news right now.
[44:44.120 --> 44:49.120]  First off, briefly here, the special is unprecedented.
[44:49.160 --> 44:51.000]  We normally only run this once a year.
[44:51.000 --> 44:52.320]  We did this a few months ago
[44:53.480 --> 44:55.280]  because of all the mainstream news articles
[44:55.280 --> 45:00.120]  about FEMA saying, we believe, actually say,
[45:00.120 --> 45:02.920]  we believe, I'm gonna play this clip next hour,
[45:02.920 --> 45:07.920]  we believe that it's probable
[45:09.280 --> 45:13.480]  that we will have the scenario 395% food prices.
[45:13.480 --> 45:16.160]  Cause I actually went and watched the actual video briefing
[45:16.160 --> 45:17.840]  that FEMA did on it and there,
[45:17.840 --> 45:19.680]  and my original interpretation was correct
[45:19.680 --> 45:21.720]  that they're saying they believe this is happening.
[45:21.720 --> 45:23.440]  Cause I know that was in British reports
[45:23.440 --> 45:26.840]  and Pentagon reports that we also cite
[45:26.840 --> 45:28.360]  in the upcoming report,
[45:28.360 --> 45:31.080]  but to actually see them saying,
[45:31.080 --> 45:33.560]  and they're kind of smiling while they talk about it,
[45:33.560 --> 45:34.680]  it's uber creepy.
[45:37.880 --> 45:40.760]  So all I'm saying is you need to get water filtration,
[45:40.760 --> 45:41.880]  you need to get storeable foods,
[45:41.880 --> 45:44.080]  you need to get prepared.
[45:44.080 --> 45:46.440]  If you can with family, get together,
[45:46.440 --> 45:47.960]  and I don't care what's even five, 10 acres,
[45:47.960 --> 45:50.800]  I'm a middle of nowhere that's got well water or whatever,
[45:50.800 --> 45:52.520]  just so you can get away from major cities
[45:52.520 --> 45:54.920]  during a collapse or have a place to grow a garden,
[45:54.920 --> 45:58.080]  whatever, everybody in Europe has that even poor people do.
[45:58.080 --> 45:59.200]  That's just part of being human.
[45:59.200 --> 46:00.720]  People need to get back to the land.
[46:00.720 --> 46:02.680]  We sell high quality non-GMO seeds.
[46:02.680 --> 46:06.920]  Everything for the 4th of July, mega specials are now live.
[46:06.920 --> 46:08.680]  We're gonna do this on Friday through Monday,
[46:08.680 --> 46:10.840]  but I'm gonna just start today.
[46:10.840 --> 46:13.080]  20% off survival shield X2,
[46:13.080 --> 46:15.960]  20, 40% off InfoWars select storeable food,
[46:15.960 --> 46:18.160]  20% off Alexa pure water filters,
[46:18.160 --> 46:20.200]  20% off Alexa pure air filters.
[46:20.200 --> 46:21.640]  These specials will run for a limited time
[46:21.640 --> 46:22.800]  while supplies last.
[46:22.800 --> 46:25.160]  This Independence Day is a great time
[46:25.160 --> 46:29.120]  to support the real tip of the spear
[46:29.120 --> 46:31.800]  when it comes to the fight for liberty.
[46:31.800 --> 46:33.680]  Your support makes everything we do possible
[46:33.680 --> 46:35.400]  from exposing Hillary Clinton to fighting
[46:35.400 --> 46:36.360]  for the Constitution.

[46:42.040 --> 46:43.560]  while supplies last.
[46:43.560 --> 46:44.840]  One more thing, our air conditioner,
[46:44.840 --> 46:46.440]  speaking of society breaking down,
[46:46.440 --> 46:47.360]  isn't working too well.
[46:47.360 --> 46:49.120]  It's kind of hot in here.
[46:49.120 --> 46:50.320]  I always meant to do this.
[46:50.320 --> 46:51.800]  Somebody just go get me some basic,
[46:51.800 --> 46:55.160]  cheap cotton hankerchiefs
[46:55.160 --> 46:57.680]  because I expect this will be broken for a while.
[46:57.680 --> 46:59.760]  And I'll take them home.
[46:59.760 --> 47:00.760]  I'll wash them tonight.
[47:00.760 --> 47:01.640]  I'm gonna get a stack of those
[47:01.640 --> 47:03.200]  because I don't like wiping my face with napkins.
[47:03.200 --> 47:04.440]  It gets chemicals into my face and stuff.
[47:04.440 --> 47:05.640]  I just don't like it.
[47:07.640 --> 47:08.680]  Little pieces of lint, whatever.
[47:08.680 --> 47:09.920]  Thank you.
[47:09.920 --> 47:10.760]  My assistant or whoever.
[47:10.760 --> 47:11.600]  Thank you.
[47:11.600 --> 47:12.440]  I just say that on air
[47:12.440 --> 47:13.720]  because I'm gonna forget to say it during the break
[47:13.720 --> 47:16.240]  and then I just have to get it out there now.
[47:16.240 --> 47:18.560]  Anyways, the point is this funds the operation.
[47:18.560 --> 47:19.400]  It's a great deal.
[47:19.400 --> 47:22.560]  Super high quality, durable foods, the highest quality.
[47:22.560 --> 47:24.200]  It's very hard to get specials like this
[47:24.200 --> 47:25.760]  and to line it up with all these different companies
[47:25.760 --> 47:28.080]  to allow us, because we already have contracts
[47:28.080 --> 47:32.080]  that say this is the lowest advertised price we can do.
[47:32.080 --> 47:34.000]  And then we have to reach out to our suppliers
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.440]  and get agreements for how long we can do it.
[47:36.440 --> 47:37.560]  That's how this stuff works.
[47:37.560 --> 47:40.520]  When we're already selling stuff at Amazon level.
[47:40.520 --> 47:42.360]  When we go below that,
[47:42.360 --> 47:44.400]  a whole bunch of different things trigger.
[47:44.400 --> 47:46.880]  And so it's very hard to do specials like this.
[47:46.880 --> 47:48.520]  And quite frankly, my accountant argues with me
[47:48.520 --> 47:49.680]  on the shows me numbers and stuff.
[47:49.680 --> 47:51.280]  It says you shouldn't always discount this much.
[47:51.280 --> 47:53.000]  That's why you sell so much stuff,
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.600]  but then the profit isn't big enough
[47:54.600 --> 47:56.800]  for the expansion plans you have.
[47:56.800 --> 47:57.640]  Whatever.
[47:59.040 --> 48:00.200]  You wanna support us, get the Hillary
[48:00.200 --> 48:02.320]  for present t-shirt, this back in stock, a new design,
[48:02.320 --> 48:05.560]  but they're even better than the last one at full price, 1995.
[48:08.320 --> 48:09.720]  But at the same time,
[48:11.080 --> 48:13.040]  you need to take advantage of 20 to 40% off
[48:13.040 --> 48:14.360]  when info or select storeable food.
[48:14.360 --> 48:16.280]  That is the best deal right now.
[48:16.280 --> 48:17.200]  And even if you've already gotten
[48:17.200 --> 48:18.480]  this high quality food before,
[48:18.480 --> 48:19.920]  I would suggest getting more
[48:20.760 --> 48:22.400]  so that you have it for friends and family.
[48:22.400 --> 48:23.800]  And then you can give it to them at Christmas
[48:23.800 --> 48:25.080]  or for their birthday or whatever.
[48:25.080 --> 48:26.800]  And they've got week packs, month packs,
[48:26.800 --> 48:28.920]  three month packs, six month packs, year packs,
[48:28.920 --> 48:30.360]  all these different special diets,
[48:30.360 --> 48:31.720]  a huge selection, whatever you want.
[48:31.720 --> 48:33.360]  It's powered by my patron supply
[48:33.360 --> 48:38.200]  at infowarstore.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139,
[48:38.200 --> 48:41.200]  888-253-3139.
[48:42.640 --> 48:44.120]  Okay, I'm gonna stop at that point.
[48:44.120 --> 48:45.600]  Please support our local affiliates
[48:45.600 --> 48:48.200]  and become sponsors or support sponsors
[48:48.200 --> 48:51.000]  as well, but just one last piece on that front.
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.000]  Secret government warehouse stockpiling for pandemic
[48:54.000 --> 48:55.960]  can't be discussed publicly.
[48:55.960 --> 48:57.640]  It is clear they're gearing up for something.
[48:57.640 --> 48:59.960]  Yeah, I mean, I've gotta say the preparation
[48:59.960 --> 49:02.120]  for martial law and civil unrest
[49:02.120 --> 49:04.520]  and economic disaster and bio disaster
[49:04.520 --> 49:06.600]  and earthquakes, volcanoes,
[49:06.600 --> 49:09.200]  it's 10 times anything I've ever seen.
[49:09.200 --> 49:11.720]  And I'm just hoping it's just alluding
[49:11.720 --> 49:14.760]  by special interest through the COG,
[49:14.760 --> 49:16.040]  continuity of government systems.
[49:16.040 --> 49:17.240]  I mean, that's bad enough,
[49:17.240 --> 49:20.280]  but at least some money from taxpayers
[49:20.280 --> 49:21.720]  will actually go into an economy,
[49:21.720 --> 49:23.560]  even if it's government employees and contractors,
[49:23.560 --> 49:26.040]  because most of the trillions just get locked up
[49:26.040 --> 49:28.400]  in big mega banks vaults
[49:28.400 --> 49:31.120]  that they just use to leverage everybody else out
[49:31.120 --> 49:31.960]  to put us in debt.
[49:31.960 --> 49:32.960]  They create tens of trillions
[49:32.960 --> 49:34.360]  and bail out to themselves,
[49:34.360 --> 49:36.600]  freeze the money just to say we're in debt
[49:36.600 --> 49:38.280]  to them and get interest.
[49:38.280 --> 49:41.440]  I mean, you talk about raping somebody with sandpaper.
[49:41.440 --> 49:45.080]  I mean, this is brutal, brutal, brutal, brutal, brutal.
[49:45.080 --> 49:46.320]  But I mean, what more do you expect?
[49:46.320 --> 49:47.480]  They're assaulting us.
[49:47.480 --> 49:49.800]  They're announcing they're in a war against us.
[49:49.800 --> 49:50.880]  They're so arrogant.
[49:50.880 --> 49:52.320]  And then when we dare stand up to them,
[49:52.320 --> 49:55.200]  they panic and go, fine, where are your enemies?
[49:55.200 --> 49:56.040]  Where are your elite?
[49:56.040 --> 49:58.000]  Our eyes don't point the right directions.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.480]  We were given our well five generations ago
[50:00.480 --> 50:01.920]  by people that robbed others.
[50:01.920 --> 50:04.800]  Oh my God, we're foppish, worship us.
[50:04.800 --> 50:07.240]  And just, no, I do not worship you.
[50:07.240 --> 50:11.360]  A bunch of sycophantic morons who are OCD mentally ill.
[50:12.680 --> 50:14.400]  I don't wanna insult the average OCD person,
[50:14.400 --> 50:16.400]  you get around inbred elites.
[50:18.080 --> 50:21.120]  I don't care if it's rich African royalty
[50:21.120 --> 50:25.440]  or European royalty or Arab royalty, royalty.
[50:25.440 --> 50:28.240]  They're a bunch of inbred, crazy people
[50:28.240 --> 50:31.240]  that are spoiled brat potentates that think they're God
[50:31.240 --> 50:34.640]  and we're facing the same fight we fought in 1776.
[50:34.640 --> 50:37.000]  A bunch of trash saying they're God
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.760]  and it's their right to rule over us
[50:38.760 --> 50:40.960]  because they're hunchbacked
[50:40.960 --> 50:42.960]  and their eyes don't point the right direction,
[50:42.960 --> 50:45.760]  but they own the power structure through fraud
[50:45.760 --> 50:47.520]  and now wanna have a class warfare
[50:47.520 --> 50:49.960]  with a bunch of stupid dumb down people
[50:49.960 --> 50:52.160]  to wage war against what's left of the middle class
[50:52.160 --> 50:54.760]  so they can blow up the stairway that's left
[50:54.760 --> 50:56.840]  to poor people to upper mobility.
[50:56.840 --> 50:58.280]  They wanna sew this thing up
[50:58.280 --> 51:00.360]  and I'm not gonna sit here and watch this screw job.
[51:00.360 --> 51:01.680]  Are you prepared to bug out?

[54:51.900 --> 55:00.000]  keeps on raining love is gonna break going down going down now going down
[55:00.000 --> 55:11.720]  down to Chicago where do you start it really is amazing that they're now in
[55:11.720 --> 55:17.280]  full panic mode and now things that we were talking about 20 years ago 20 years
[55:17.280 --> 55:25.720]  ago I was interviewing Ron Paul 21 years ago it was about 20 years ago he's
[55:25.720 --> 55:30.440]  running for Congress again in 1996 and again Austin was part of his district
[55:30.440 --> 55:36.120]  and so he really wanted on my show a lot he would come on like every week and he
[55:36.120 --> 55:40.440]  wouldn't go super far on New World Order or World Government he would talk a
[55:40.440 --> 55:44.840]  little bit about it and and listeners like wow he admitted New World Order
[55:44.840 --> 55:48.280]  global government you asked and I mean no one would talk about that I mean the
[55:48.280 --> 55:52.280]  ADL would say that you were a racist it didn't exist I remember hearing
[55:52.280 --> 55:58.120]  national talk show hosts say the CFR did not exist when I was in high school in
[55:58.120 --> 56:06.840]  1992 about to graduate I remember Rush Limbaugh and I'm not bashing him because
[56:06.840 --> 56:13.080]  they'd fire him at the time if he did it Roger else by the way the word is Roger
[56:13.080 --> 56:18.960]  else I'd like to go over either he's on a leash it was so unsafe then and by
[56:18.960 --> 56:22.280]  way this isn't about info wars getting credit it's about you getting credit and
[56:22.280 --> 56:27.200]  it's about realizing we're winning we're on the March the global Empire of the
[56:27.200 --> 56:31.440]  new royalty of the Kim Jong-un's and the and the CFR's and the Hillary
[56:31.440 --> 56:36.360]  Clinton's they're losing that that isn't hype when I've been telling you the last
[56:36.360 --> 56:39.800]  five years I'm sort of getting more optimistic that that we're on the March
[56:39.800 --> 56:45.560]  the Empire is on the run and that I talked to so many people in media and
[56:45.560 --> 56:49.320]  government and worldwide they they are so awake but scared to speak out and
[56:49.320 --> 56:54.920]  people like myself and and and those of you out there and the drudge report and
[56:54.920 --> 57:02.480]  world that daily and others have really forced reality in to the debate and that
[57:02.480 --> 57:08.840]  is the most valuable thing in the universe to me a brand new million
[57:08.840 --> 57:13.800]  dollar Bentley would mean nothing to me the very nice I'm sure very cool cars I'd
[57:13.800 --> 57:18.480]  sell it and you know buy a Ford Raptor and then give the rest of charity or
[57:18.480 --> 57:20.920]  something the point is I'm not saying it's bad to own something nice that's
[57:20.920 --> 57:26.320]  what you like I don't value things I value a flower garden in my backyard more
[57:26.320 --> 57:33.680]  than I value a big diamond ring on my wife's finger hypothetically and that
[57:33.680 --> 57:38.240]  just shows the type of folks we are in the Liberty Movement type of folks you
[57:38.240 --> 57:42.360]  are versus them most people would sell their mommy out for a 10 carat diamond
[57:42.360 --> 57:46.720]  ring most people want to pull up in the most expensive Bentley at the country
[57:46.720 --> 57:51.600]  club because they want people to know they're successful now the super rich
[57:51.600 --> 57:55.000]  are going to pull up in the Ford F-150 and have a t-shirt with holes on it
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.720]  because actually you're more sophisticated than that but there's this
[57:57.720 --> 58:03.480]  whole sycophantic underclass of wealthy that will do anything to feel like they're
[58:03.480 --> 58:10.640]  accepted by the upper elite and the so-called wannabe elite never understand
[58:10.640 --> 58:15.040]  why they're not let into the elite and that's because you aren't into slitting

[58:19.960 --> 58:26.600]  like raping children so you're not gonna be let in okay so you just drive your

[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:56.760]  the clip chewed up where he talked about her being a dictator Hillary wanted to
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:01.320]  put it CMBC talking on the top internet viewers say about Zuckerberg they said
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.600]  he's he's dictator of the biggest nation on earth over two million people Facebook
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:11.160]  that's exactly what these people are technocratic systems just means a
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:18.320]  dictatorship of a technological elite and then I have this tendency to not
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.480]  even mention our most powerful articles up front everyone should be
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:26.240]  constantly at info wars calm prison planet calm because there's just such
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.640]  bombshell stuff up there I mean this is mainstream news in Philadelphia with a
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:36.640]  straight face school calls police on nine-year-old for racist remark called
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:43.960]  snack brownies this is not the onion this is real remember when Seattle said
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:47.720]  don't bring brown paper bags and no one and they admit it no one ever said they
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.600]  were racist no one ever said a brown bag was meant anything I'm wearing brown
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:55.720]  shoes right now folks I got brown skin
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:03.600]  white brown I'm evil one of my daughters has got brown eyes others have got
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:08.160]  green I love those little Cookie Monster eyes
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:15.920]  and of course it's illogical it's just about the logic it's about being a
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:23.120]  logical and this is in Philadelphia Philly calm reports it with a straight
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:29.640]  face I mean the kids are just being turned into basket cases the white kids
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.960]  but then if a minority wants to knock a white kid out and almost kill them a
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.080]  brass knuckles that's okay because they're white and they deserve it that's
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.240]  in the news you want to kill somebody because they're white that's all right
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.840]  cracker had it coming and again most people who are minorities aren't like
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:52.400]  this it's the media pushing this telling them it's okay to act like this
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.720]  that's why the Klan was so bad in the 2030s and 40s because a lot of media in
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:02.560]  the South was promoting it like it was a good thing
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:10.280]  and now the media promotes go out and attack Trump people go beat up women and
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:15.480]  the LA Times is like hey they deserve it a bunch of men waving Mexican flags
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:22.000]  beating a woman up and it's not racial because she's white no the truth is
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.080]  every group can act like a bunch of tribal morons and while you're busy
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:29.360]  doing that all of our freedoms are being taken and we're being chemically
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.560]  attacked with the fluoride and all the rest of it during an end-of-year class
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.760]  party at a New Jersey elementary school a nine-year-old boy this was out of
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.040]  Philly comm was in New Jersey said something about brownies and was
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.480]  subsequently questioned by a police officer who was called by the school
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:52.680]  to investigate an incident racism oh yeah it was another student that accused
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:55.760]  the boy of saying something racist cuz see you don't want a reader right now
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.800]  you've learned how to hear things upset you but the boys mother said he was
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:05.840]  talking about snacks not skin color and there's a new thing where they're
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:08.920]  telling bartenders I heard about this few years ago and then I've talked to
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.280]  bartenders they tell especially Hispanic bartenders or people that are
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.600]  serving drinks that are from Mexico or here legally or whatever you know at the
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:20.980]  restaurant but don't come up and ask if you want a longer or a dog like you
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:27.680]  asked if you asked for a modello they're actually telling bartenders cuz
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:32.740]  they'll say like when you're in Mexico they'll say blonde or Negro and they're
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:37.680]  telling them don't say that because not just black people who are ignorant but
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.880]  white people especially will flip out on you when you say the Spanish word for
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.080]  black just means
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.940]  Negro just means I mean words are now evil folks that have nothing to do
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:53.880]  anything this is the mass mental illness we're dealing with while all of us are
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.320]  having our rights taken and freedoms taken we are obsessing over stuff like
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.640]  this it is crazy
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:05.200]  no matter where he goes they want to win free cause we're always together as the
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:10.040]  three amigos of nefta the president days of the u.s. Mexico and Canada met
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:14.640]  today Obama said Trump has worked against economic opportunity for workers
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:20.360]  and ordinary people but the record of the last 20 years is clear it is nafta
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:23.960]  that has worked against economic opportunity for ordinary people the
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:29.360]  22 years of nafta have been a giant sucking sound 1 million u.s. jobs lost
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.480]  hundreds of millions paid to multinational corporations by investor
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:37.920]  state tribunals and hundreds of billions in u.s. trade deficits trump
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:42.000]  warned us about nafta as it was being created 30 years ago and he's made a
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.860]  nafta exit a central issue of his campaign but the three amigos think
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:50.280]  you're too stupid to know what they've done to you these three clowns are just

[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.640]  remember all the deaths i remember fbi agents that were in the winehouse coming
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.840]  out and some of the bizarre stuff they saw that later hillary admitted she goes
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.520]  oh it's a joke that i've got crack pipes and mouse a tongue on the christmas
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:08.080]  tree remember that what's wrong with you these are from the outside looking in
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:14.880]  seem like degenerates seem like mentally ill people that are just into doing
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.600]  weird stuff perverts basically i mean i don't have a degree in criminology you
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.840]  know like our next guest does but sitting back watching this and studying
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.760]  kim jong-un and his megalomania i look at hillary it it seems like she's a
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.000]  would-be dictator and we're gonna go to our guest
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.040]  who's the valiant secret service agent that's had the will to go public
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.360]  dan bonjino another guy that has a lot of courage
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:39.600]  is going to be joining us tomorrow a crisis of character
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:44.800]  gary j burn a white house secret service officer discloses his first-hand
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.760]  experience with hillary bill and how they operate
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:51.440]  and i have just started reading the book and it is just nightmarish
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.880]  because it fits into everything we've already seen and know i mean
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.560]  this woman is is it has a criminal mind she is
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.240]  he has criminal energy that's a layperson's view we're going to get his
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.280]  view here just a moment but first here's a clip of where he called it like it is
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.920]  and said she's a dictator here it is and in 2016 she's running again
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.280]  and you felt compelled to tell the story because you
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:17.040]  because why let me ask that because i want the people i want the americans to
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.720]  know with the real clinton administration's like mrs clinton is not a
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.640]  leader she's a very very angry person all the time she's
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.760]  i've seen many instances i talk about in my book
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.960]  crisis of character where she displays this
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.760]  um holier than now attitude do as i say not as i do she's she's a dictator she
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.400]  comes across as a dictator i've seen him berate many people
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.640]  and myself included it and i've never seen any example that would lead me to
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.080]  believe that she um could lead this country
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:50.400]  you know you describe a woman uh that is very phony in other words
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:54.240]  you talk about how she'd tell you to go to hell or tell another agent to go
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.520]  blank himself correct and how she threw a bible at it
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.960]  at a secret service officer or agent agent yes sir
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.880]  okay and the base story which we'll get to in a minute right but if the cameras
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.080]  were on she was close to bill but it was manufactured it was not real
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.720]  absolutely camera goes off different person yeah yeah
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.000]  let's go to him now but i want to show that clip from hannity
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.800]  now now i've had bongino on i've talked to other secret service folks off
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.360]  record they didn't give me anything secret they just said look it's worse than
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.520]  you know it's worse than you're saying
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.800]  and i was once at a party with a celebrity and there was a current secret
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.080]  service guy they're pretty senior and he he's he's he said no alex
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:35.280]  you're dead on but it's worse than you're saying and then i've talked to
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.640]  bongino said the same thing and he never told me anything secret they
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:41.760]  started threatening him when he came on what'd you tell alex because i was
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.240]  saying some stuff on air about what we know about the clinton's and then they
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.080]  thought he told me his house got broken into his car did his kids basically got
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.320]  threatened he doesn't want me to talk about it because it sounds
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:53.440]  wimpy to you know talk about threats but it's not
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.880]  these guys have real courage i gotta tell you mr burn
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:00.240]  i mean we uh i hope you didn't have any car accidents or airplane accidents or
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:03.120]  anything because the clinton's are organized criminals in my view and
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.680]  there's a lot of death around them but i'm gonna stop right there mr burn thank
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:09.280]  you so much for coming on crisis of character book dot com
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:12.320]  let's let's go to the waterfront here let's end i mean tell us i mean you're
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.600]  putting your life on the line here i i i think that goes unsaid
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.200]  so thank you this isn't about just selling a book tell us the truth sir your
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.960]  warning america sure i wrote my book uh first of all
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.760]  thank you for having me i wrote my book because i want people to know the
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.200]  truth just like you said and all those things that you were
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.320]  you were uh in your people mr stars telling you that
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.400]  everything you said before is true and that's one of the reason i want people
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.200]  to know what the real hillary clinton's like
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:45.280]  listen if she she wasn't running for office i wouldn't care
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.880]  i wouldn't hear it all but she's about to she has a good chance of becoming the
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.600]  next president of the united states and i want people to know
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:57.200]  that um that is not a good thing she has a an explosive dangerous personality
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.960]  um she she has this ability she has this inability
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.160]  to focus on the problem she seems to focus on
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:08.720]  what caused the problem um you know i've seen her berate her
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:12.000]  staff that were supposedly friends of hers to the point where they were
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.760]  terrified of her and it just goes from one thing to the other
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.520]  there's been reports of her by other secret service says a punching bill
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.320]  clinton repeatedly i mean almost knocking him down
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:28.800]  are those reports accurate so i've never witnessed that but i did see the
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.680]  president show up at the oval office one morning
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:35.120]  after a bad fight up at the mansion the night before
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.120]  where a vase got broken and when he showed up at the oval office out
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.160]  be at a black eye at a mark under his eye and he was trying to conceal it with
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:45.360]  makeup at to the point where i actually said to his
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:49.120]  secretary and his assistant um what's that mark under the president's eye and
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.320]  they said oh uh the one assistant said oh
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.680]  he's allergic to coffee i see allergic to coffee under one eye
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.960]  and um as i walked out of the room i actually turned to the other assistant
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.800]  the secretary and i said uh i'm allergic to the back of somebody's hand
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.400]  and i was just trying to get a some you know a rise out of him to see what the
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.920]  deal was and uh it was just so bizarre i mean i
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:13.920]  realized people fight at times but once you hear these you know you
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.960]  witness these things and and my co-workers you know we don't talk
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.920]  about these things because we have nothing else to do we we pass this
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.680]  information on so the next part i don't understand it's unprecedented to have
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.640]  the secret service and you're not the only one coming out
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.320]  uh but i mean it obviously has to be done i mean the word i get from
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:34.720]  high level pentagon high level state department high level former cia
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.080]  and is that hillary basically is a chinese agent
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.520]  slash shoddy rabion agent and i want to see we can segue into some of that
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.160]  because you've mainly you know just covered her her outburst but but
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.640]  correct me if i'm wrong they're at the white house for quite a while you might
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.800]  get into that history but it it looks like following her for 20 years i'm
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.760]  being forced to nothing just like i want to watch her or read her see what she
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:58.400]  does it seems like her lies are getting wilder she seems more unstable looks
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.000]  even crazier than she did 20 years ago she seems to be deteriorating is what
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.160]  i'm getting at yeah so i've never seen anything that would
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:10.000]  lead me to believe that she's i mean other than like her policies seem to
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.200]  learn to lean to some of these countries but i've never seen anything that i
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:16.800]  would call you know out of the ordinary but what i along the lines you were
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:22.080]  talking about as she's getting older is um my take on it out is that she's
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.280]  getting more and more comfortable with it that that she's being more and more
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:29.280]  the real hillary which i i in my opinion she's more of a
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.960]  dictator than anything else i think she's getting comfortable with it i think
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.000]  it's she feels like it's been accepted by the people who are going to vote her
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.600]  in and that's the way it's going to be
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.760]  well expanding on that i don't normally go off a a a a a book by their cover
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.280]  but but but clearly sometimes you're pumping gas and some thugs pull up
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.080]  it doesn't matter whether black thugs white thugs whoever you just pick up
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.720]  these guys are thugs and sure enough you see one of them you know shoot their
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.360]  mouth off it you know an old lady or something and
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.280]  when you look at her though she just radiates like she could play a female
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:05.200]  joker i mean if i was in casting in hollywood and i i actually have been
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:09.440]  worked in some films and consulting uh i would cast her as a female super villain
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:12.560]  i mean i'm not being sarcastic as a guy you know that has a gut instinct
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.880]  criminology background just her demeanor the way she looks and acts sometimes
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.320]  and the way her face has changed so suddenly what's going on there because
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.280]  to me she looks like she's mentally ill
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:29.280]  well i'll give you two examples of kind of the outburst that you're you're
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.880]  talking about when i was still working at the white house
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.840]  we had hired some new employees and these two young officers one young i was
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.280]  down in the break room and a young officer came down and he said man
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.480]  what a weird day and we said you know what's going on he said well
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:48.960]  he passed by the first lady and he said hello and she told him to you know
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:54.400]  to go to hell and you know we said well you know that's
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.520]  that's the way it is around here you know she doesn't seem to like us much
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:01.760]  and then another guy came in he walked up and he said that's nothing he said
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:05.360]  last month i was walking past her down the west colony
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.440]  and he said good morning to her and she told him to go at himself
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:15.520]  and so that's two examples and and this happened the way it happened
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:19.200]  out a sergeant overheard them telling the stories to the other
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:23.520]  myself and the other people down there and they investigated and the agents
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.800]  the senior agents of the agency took the associates they came down to talk to
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.440]  this guy two inspectors and they and they actually
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.640]  apologized and said just understand this but you know you're not going to get
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:35.680]  an apology from anyone else and the bizarre thing about that out
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:39.920]  was the second guy who she told to go at himself
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.400]  he had been in the army a couple years before and he had been in Somalia on a
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.680]  mission basically to President Clinton and Sanamon
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.400]  and it wasn't you know today we know that the Somalia because of the
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:56.000]  the movie black hawk down they hung him up is right
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.320]  right this was before that like the first deployment to Somalia
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.920]  and this guy was wounded and and received the purple heart
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.200]  and a couple years later he comes to work for the secret service uniform
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.840]  division and the first lady tells him to go at himself
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:13.520]  it's just so bizarre i don't even i mean this is one of the reasons i felt
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.920]  compelled this is the person that people want to put
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.680]  in the oval office yeah i think it's insane well bottom line
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:23.440]  Gary i i've just noticed you've been around a few years
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:29.520]  that criminal types don't like police officers uh
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.200]  folks like that it's not that police are perfect or secret service are perfect
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.960]  they just don't like the manliness they don't like the straightforwardness they
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.400]  don't like being looked in the eye and i've confirmed with dozens of reporters
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.600]  over the 20 years and and people that have worked around her
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:47.360]  meetings she goes to like Davos and others that they tell people and i've
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.280]  interviewed the people at the hotels after these events are over
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.880]  i mean i've made films on this that they tell people in briefings
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.680]  do not look Hillary in the eye so as bad as you've been getting it and other
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:02.800]  law enforcement officers the word is when she is out
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:09.280]  around just general folks no tips uh and it's not just her it's this whole group
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.920]  you know no tips very rude very hateful uh i mean separately i don't want to
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:17.680]  say go off of hillary but i mean i'm told it's not as bad but it's similar
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.480]  with obama and it's similar with um with his wife
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.760]  yeah that i don't know about because i left before they got there i actually
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.960]  left when um when george w bush was president
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.160]  sure 2003 i transferred to the air marshall so
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.880]  that i don't have any information on i'm sorry it's been in the press though
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:41.920]  yes yes i've seen it yeah i've seen it and uh i've read some of the same story
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.040]  you have absolutely well i'll tell you this when they bring up our show or
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:48.960]  info words to her we play the video she she all the sudden goes and her eyes get
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.480]  wide and she has like an adrenaline rush and just gets scared and it sounds to
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:56.320]  me like that's the type of response she has around guys like you
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.200]  yes yes i i think that's uh i agree with you um
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.440]  yeah the uh it's so bizarre to think about the things that
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.720]  that i've written when when i was writing my book crisis of character and you
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:12.800]  look at the the stuff in there and you know uh writing a book you review it
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.160]  and you edit it you edit it and some of the stuff i was like oh my god it's
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:20.000]  just so crazy it's just um and then and you know
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.280]  she's it she's about she could be the next president of the united states and
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:27.440]  she's under fbi investigation how does that how does that keep going on how
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:31.040]  was that possible and she's been caught lying from every angle it's ridiculous
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:35.920]  oh absolutely absolutely well you know uh according to the history of the
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.520]  watergate investigation she was fired from that
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:43.520]  because of of uh unseen new behavior i mean that just sounds so bizarre
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.320]  well you know fbi agents that works in the white house and others have been
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.600]  audited harassed all sorts of things have happened i don't want to
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.880]  eat you know get into speculation areas here sure
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:55.520]  make them a decision with you and your family to write this book i mean really
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.720]  nobody else has had the wavos to do this maybe one other person
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.480]  i mean i gotta say sir uh i really hope you've got a big insurance policy
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.760]  taken out for your family and yeah so we um
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.560]  you know we we knew what we were getting into and we've we've taken our
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:12.640]  precautions and uh and did her due diligence so
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:16.320]  yeah uh keep our fingers crossed well you know what you're on the side of right
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.040]  and and just we really i mean i'm i'm serious i'm not kissing your butt i don't
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.640]  do this with a lot of guys i understand i and i appreciate that
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:25.280]  i admire your courage i mean we had more people like you sir we wouldn't be in
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:29.360]  such trouble well thank you so much i i greatly appreciate it what can you talk
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:33.200]  about the process of deciding to write this book uh crisis of character uh
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:36.960]  sir sure you know uh you know 10 years ago somebody
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.920]  suggested i was going to do this i would have said they were crazy i thought i
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:44.320]  would take this stuff to my grave and um but things changed over the years uh
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.720]  alexon and and as it got closer and closer to this election and i thought
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.080]  she was more likely to win i thought how can this happen how can somebody
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:56.160]  that operates like this um have an opportunity to become president of this
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:00.960]  country and so i decided that i would write a book about my life and and i
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:06.080]  would of course include all of it and um um and my time there and you know the
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.720]  original the original title of my book was actually
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:12.800]  fence jumpers to hijackers you know my time at the white house and then
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:16.320]  my time is an air marshal but as they got more to time to
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:20.640]  put the book out and as we developed it it became crisis of character and it's
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:24.400]  not just about her crisis of character it's it's a little bit about my
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:28.080]  crisis of character too to you know the the process of uh
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:31.440]  deciding to do this and putting your yourself and your family at this kind
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.960]  of risk yeah i can hear it in your voice you have
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:38.960]  really put yourself at rest folks up listeners understand this is not a game
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.360]  uh i have been i have been seriously threatened by the clinton's years ago
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.040]  and went and had some really nasty experiences that are almost unbelievable
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.160]  haven't even gotten into them on air and so i can imagine what i mean you know
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:53.440]  but have you ever met dan bonjino do you know him

[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:10.160]  he's an upstanding guy but he didn't even really write a book about them he
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.640]  just wrote a book about taking america back in there and they're coming after
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:17.280]  him so boy they're really gonna whoo right i mean i don't know that bizarre

[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:44.400]  over tv they're all over the trump rallies it was the number one meme

[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.160]  fact that we have basically started this meme and that you the listeners have
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:58.960]  taken to the next level so i want to say that i am right behind this man i don't
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:02.240]  have any of the courage he's got to be doing this but i'm we're in the same
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.760]  same arena here and i hope you'll join him in the arena and get the book crisis

[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:12.320]  of stuff's in the book but uh you know spill your guts to folks you're putting
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:16.240]  your life on the line tell people uh what you really think about hillary
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:21.680]  sure thank you so my time at the white house i explained like i said before i
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:26.640]  explained experienced many bizarre things and you know you can understand
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.000]  some are hangers sometimes when she finds out what her husband's doing with
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.920]  these affairs but my question is why do you stay in that relationship to keep
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.800]  exposing yourself to all this mental damage and and and my fear is at this
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.840]  point in her life which is about to become president of the united states
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:45.360]  i mean how damaged is she i mean how emotional can she really get
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:51.040]  and that's what concerns me and the things that i saw um when i worked there
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:59.200]  uh many examples of her um her anger and and really to me um her inability to
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:04.320]  function normal i mean how is it you can you can um treat your your staff so
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:10.720]  poorly that they're afraid of you and um so that that's what really uh one of
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:14.400]  the things is amongst others that greatly concern me
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:19.600]  um is there is there any particular uh part of the book that you talk about
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:23.200]  out well i mean i've only gotten you know a
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:28.240]  little bit into it it's amazing uh i just you know to me it just shows how
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.800]  unstable she is and i know you're being a nice guy and you're going with what you
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.840]  can totally prove but the word is she just gets mad
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.280]  she just gets mad when she doesn't get a piece of the tail now the word is you
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:41.040]  know uh clinton used to joke and so did roger his brother that she's
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:44.320]  sees more tail than bill does we're not attacking her in the fact that she's
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.320]  bisexual but it's pretty evident that she is i'm worried about that from the
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:51.600]  blackmail uh perspective the word is she'd beat bill up
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:55.440]  when when when he didn't follow orders i mean from from the inside sources we
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:59.520]  have it and and they've kind of bragged about this it wasn't just co-presidency
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.880]  a lot of the time hillary was more of a president than bill because he was so
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:06.320]  busy partying and so so can you speak to that i mean their real
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.880]  relationship uh right the fact that she could be blackmailed
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:16.480]  sure the um i definitely saw a different like you know when the cameras
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:20.080]  weren't on she's always to me she's always the
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.600]  loof even when the cameras are on like to me she's never genuine
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.520]  i think every time in the last year you've heard messages from her campaign
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:30.320]  where they're rebooting to make mrs clinton more
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:35.120]  more likable more so who is the real past the aloof past the little fake robot
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.200]  lady with this with the joker smile who is she you were around her for years
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.200]  she she's somebody who's very angry for some reason i i don't really understand
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:48.080]  besides the actions of her husband she's somebody who is to me is incompetent i
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:51.680]  mean look what happened you know she was secretary of state for years and we got
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.160]  been gawzy and as soon as it was as soon as it happened she got out she left a
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:01.120]  real leader alex would have stayed there and picked the problems so never again
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:04.400]  is one of our ambassadors murdered like that so you're just too you're just too
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:08.960]  honorable of a guy brother to see that then gawzy was on purpose to
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:12.640]  ship the missiles to al-qaeda to take over syria and the turkish ambassador
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:15.200]  was there that morning and ambassador steven said no so they pulled the
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.480]  security and had him whacked but i mean i'm not gonna like like get off on a
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:21.920]  rabbit trail it's just that she's way more evil uh than i think you're even
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:25.360]  getting it now you're well obviously she is and
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:28.960]  that's not something i experienced but i certainly believe that to be true i mean
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.800]  nothing would surprise me anymore after what i saw those years and what i
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:35.600]  mean what's happened since then
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:42.560]  the like i there are many examples i put my i put my book you know also
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:48.080]  details that but um yeah i didn't i never i never
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.520]  thought that we'd be in the position where um
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.160]  that she was getting ready to become president of the united states
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:58.160]  alex years ago when they first started running from arkansas i ran into this
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:01.520]  deputy down there and we were talking we were working together for about four
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.720]  hours outside this restaurant protecting uh president clinton
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:08.320]  and this or i'm sorry not president clinton president bush uh bill clinton
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.840]  was just starting to run sure first president bush and we were talking and
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.360]  i said what about this guy that this governor yours wants to run and he goes
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:18.320]  and i said you know all these affairs in these rumors he'll never get elected
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:21.200]  and the guy looked at me i mean right through me and he said let me tell you
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.320]  something darry these guys can spend manure in the gold
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.640]  everything you hear about them is true i believe it and he will get elected and
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:34.160]  he'll be there eight years and this guy was serious at the heart attack and then
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.400]  he he told me all these bizarre stories about all these rumors of people that
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:42.320]  you know i've had accidents and stuff that you were referring to before
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:47.360]  so um yeah i definitely think that if she gets elected that we're going to see
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:51.040]  the crazy stuff we've seen for the last eight years is going to unfortunately
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.840]  is going to look like a walk in the park well let me give you the intel directly
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:57.520]  from the pentagon you name it across the board and of course you were there
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:59.760]  when they were bringing the chinese generals in and all that
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:04.720]  she basically is a chinese agent a communist agent but but for money and
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:06.800]  other elites are so she's too big to fail
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:10.160]  she's so corrupt and so bad and has done stuff so horrible
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:13.680]  it'll bring down the whole government so she thinks she's invincible
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:17.440]  yeah well my fear is what if she is that's my fear
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:20.560]  i mean what if she does get in we only got 30 seconds i want to have you back
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:23.360]  crisis of character the book dot com but sir yeah what do you think will happen
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.280]  if she gets in in 30 seconds in 30 seconds i think
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:32.080]  the after the all the parties are over i think the uh the market's gonna swing
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:36.560]  that's my fear uh i also think that um she's gonna
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:39.920]  move towards more of a dictatorship more socialism
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:44.960]  we're gonna see more wow so you think yellow will move towards a dictatorship
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:48.960]  yeah i think she will i think she'll move more towards socialism
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:53.280]  incredible sir thank you so much for your courage the empires on the run
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:58.160]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:08.960]  as the three amigos of nafta the president pays of the us
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:13.600]  mexico and canada met today obama said trump has worked against economic
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:17.200]  opportunity for workers and ordinary people
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:20.720]  but the record of the last 20 years is clear it is nafta
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:23.920]  that has worked against economic opportunity for ordinary people
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:28.080]  the 22 years of nafta have been a giant sucking sound
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:32.240]  one million u.s jobs lost hundreds of millions paid to multinational
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:37.040]  corporations by investor state tribunals and hundreds of billions in us trade

[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:41.120]  and you notice the new world orders leading to death right now
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:47.360]  and i'm afraid it's going to continue
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:51.200]  because every tyrant every group of oligarchs always thinks they're invincible
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:54.640]  throughout history hitler didn't know he was
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.400]  going to lose until the russians encircled
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:05.920]  berlin and he finally figured out he was done
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:13.040]  and it's the same psychology over and over again
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:21.360]  hillary clinton will fall you can bet your bottom dollar on that one
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:28.720]  and everything she symbolizes will fall for me it's not hill it's not personal
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.640]  the clinton stuff because i was told leave the clinton's alone i was fired for
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:38.080]  my job number one at night on local radio
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:43.120]  and then i was physically attacked and then i was threatened in parking lots
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:46.400]  and then they kept they kept saying why don't you shut your mouth we're
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.440]  gonna we're gonna kill you
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:53.200]  and so i just let them know when they call me well i'm carrying a gun now
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:56.880]  so you better get me first they stopped coming around
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:03.920]  and again i beat the living hell out of the people they sent
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.840]  i broke their ribs i broke their noses
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:16.400]  they had a lot of trouble getting in their blue asterovan i can tell you that
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:19.760]  and that's what i'm going to do politically to the globalist and
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:24.800]  that's what you're going to do they want to fight they got one
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:29.520]  remember that guy broke my nose the sucker punch and he thought i was going
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:32.800]  to go down and instead i just crawled right on
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:35.760]  top of him and i crawled on all those other guys too
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:40.000]  and they were freaking out and my blood was spraying out of my nose on them
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:46.320]  and i was tearing them up
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:54.560]  don't talk about the clintons
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:04.400]  ideas are bulletproof figure that out yet i don't think i'm invincible
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:10.720]  but the truth and justice long term is invincible
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:16.080]  in fact we have a v for vendetta intro roger stone's coming on he's late getting
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:20.800]  to his to his sky because he did this last minute
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:24.000]  and that's just such a powerful part when they've shot v about a hundred times
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.440]  and he doesn't matter he's already won the mission he gets the gun he goes
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.600]  you may have taken me out i'm taking you out and ideas are bulletproof
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:34.880]  and that's really living right there is not being a coward folks and not letting
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:39.920]  these parasites feed on people anymore they're going to go down
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.560]  they will fall
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:47.200]  in the final equation uh briefly other news we haven't gotten to i mentioned
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:50.400]  this but just look at this school calls police on nine-year-old for racist
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:55.200]  remark calling brownies brownies
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:58.640]  tommy robinson accused by police of inciting racial hatred
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:02.960]  over a f isis flag in england that that's one of the nationalist groups i mean
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:05.600]  they're talking about arresting him he's been on the show before
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:09.200]  for having an f isis flag with the st george flag
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.280]  oh by the way they say the st george flag i guess that's the red
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.120]  cross on the white original english flag that they're saying don't fly that the
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.760]  police show up if you fly that now because it's it's a symbol of england
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:24.320]  that's racist i mean what i mean this is this is really going on
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.520]  but look at this breaking paris terror attack weapon
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:30.880]  linked to fast and furious who broke here years ago that guns were going from
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:34.960]  fast and furious not just into mexico but al qaeda and ices
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:39.120]  we had the whistleblowers on it's now judicial watch has it
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.760]  leon mackey reported on it it's also on info wars dot com an article
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:49.040]  cliford cuttingham wrote about such a big deal
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:52.320]  now before i go any further secret government warehouse stockpiling for
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:56.000]  pandemic can't be discussed publicly i'd say info wars dot com posted
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.880]  article max slavo here's another report in from mpr inside
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:07.200]  a secret government warehouse prep for health catastrophes
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.680]  the globalists want to make us dependent now's the time to get
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:16.480]  independent and we are running a special right now through the fourth of july
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:20.960]  that is the biggest ever 30 to 40 off on storeable foods we do that like once a
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:24.560]  year i did it a few months ago and because their things are getting so
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.360]  serious i've just had the idea this week i said we're just going to go all out
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:30.480]  with a special on all preparedness items
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.680]  from 20 to 40 off on survival shield x2
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:37.600]  24% off on all info or select storeable food 20% off on a lexapure
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:41.760]  water filters 20% off a lexapure air filters these
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.640]  specials will run right through the fourth of july i'll probably keep until
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:50.000]  tuesday you're crazy and in my humble opinion
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.160]  if you're not self-sufficient every government agency every major corporation
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:58.560]  stockpiles food stockpiles weapons stockpiles communications
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.400]  and has getaway plans for their executives helicopters and jets on
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.960]  standby and they didn't used to do this they're all
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:08.240]  gearing up and it's because things are we're sitting
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.640]  on a whole bunch of bubbles the globalist are starting wars are
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:14.320]  bringing in giant millions of of military age men into europe that are
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:17.840]  jihad forces if they bring down europe and let me tell you something folks
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:23.120]  you start having a hundred attacks a week it'll cause a great depression
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.440]  it could be a thousand a week with the numbers we're talking about this is a
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:30.000]  planned invasion of europe a total invasion a land
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.280]  invasion directed by the globalist working with
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:36.560]  saudi arabia and islam i mean this is a total double
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:39.760]  cross who would think they'd use a islamic army
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.520]  80 percent of our military age men and i used to hear this you know i criticize
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:46.640]  glenn beckon people he was here for other people but he would say this like
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:49.600]  eight years ago and i'd say that's ridiculous okay they're doing a class
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.680]  of civilizations i know they're funding radical islam
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:54.400]  i know saudi arabia is doing bad stuff another use terror attacks take our
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:57.200]  rights but they're not gonna you know invade us
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:02.720]  with muslims i was wrong i've looked at the force structure
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:08.080]  the numbers and it is five million quote refugees
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:12.160]  that were invaders into syria almost all of them
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:15.440]  80 percent military age men
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:18.800]  i've been like 15 percent of them are combatants i mean that's just a
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.520]  conservative number and we're talking about hundreds of thousands i mean
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:26.080]  if you have any idea what a hundred and something thousand people running around
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:29.680]  and by the way they've all got full auto guns that they're getting
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:32.960]  that were military grade being shipped into mexico to them
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.240]  from the united states they're also getting weapons from saudi arabia
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:41.840]  they have weapons but i'm digressing take advantage of these specials get
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:45.760]  prepared because it's not enough to have firearms it's not enough to have a
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:50.800]  defense plan for you and your family you need to be able to deal with months of
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:54.720]  not having food or electricity or water you need to have a backup plan
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:58.400]  patriots must be self-sufficient to a certain extent
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:02.800]  and believe me i've never put in extra generators at the office
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:07.120]  and i mean i've actually got more solar panels in my house i'm actually going
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:10.720]  over plans going over road routes uh to to uh if
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.920]  things totally collapse i mean look the new order they could set
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:17.920]  nukes off folks i'm telling you in my gut i can also intellectually see it
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:22.720]  this election all the destabilization garbage the the the the the race war
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:28.080]  stuff for soros funding this guy overthrows countries all
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:31.520]  the time he's not playing games he's talking about a euro superstate with
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:34.400]  armies taking over countries to try to leave i mean
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.840]  that's in mainstream news they are hard core
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:40.160]  so i don't know exactly what they're going to pull because they don't know
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:44.800]  exactly there they're kind of they got a bunch of irons in the fire here but
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.240]  am i trying to scare you absolutely because i'm concerned i'm scared you're
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:51.040]  not going to be prepared and i'll be quite honest this is a pure symbiotic
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.920]  360 win i need more money to fund our operation
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:56.640]  especially if a total depression is going to hit
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:00.320]  i don't want to have to downsize and lay a bunch of people off and who knows
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:03.440]  go off the here everybody else is either downsizing right now or going
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:06.960]  bankrupt in media because it's such a huge bloom of so much media
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:11.040]  i want to be one of the people standing at the end and we're in a position to do
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:14.240]  that we're at every metric we're exploding in viewers and readers
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:17.760]  and listeners and we are doing okay in revenue but used to when
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:21.280]  when revenue when when when audience exploded revenue followed it
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:25.120]  audience explodes revenue explodes i expand not now
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:32.400]  audience is just just blastings just like super no but just
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:34.960]  just super dangerous the globalists are flipping out
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:39.040]  so i don't even like this okay i hoped other people would be as big as i was
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:42.960]  because i'm not i'm not a coward but i'm also not stupid i don't want the limelight
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.400]  i don't want to have to do this act like a crazy man at the time because i'm so
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:50.800]  real i just don't care um when i look at idiot i like
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.000]  when i want to make jokes i do it i just you know i'm i mean i'm for real everybody
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.480]  knows that the globalists hate me because they know i'm for real
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:59.120]  and they know i'm committed and and and they know you're committed they hate you
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:03.440]  as well but i you know it's yeah you need
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:06.160]  this you need these filters these are the best filters these are the best shortway
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:09.120]  radios these are the best non-gmo heirloom seeds wide spectrum
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:13.360]  14 16 different brands now we i had them checked last week to make sure we have
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:17.360]  the lowest prices available in many cases we have the lowest prices
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:20.240]  whatever we shouldn't even have to have the lowest prices everybody should go
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:23.280]  buy this stuff in fact i'm thinking about starting to offer
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:27.280]  some items that are it like retail where we actually get like a hundred percent
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:30.480]  you know profit or something you know on it so that i can really not have to
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:34.000]  worry about making money because listen i would cut way
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.200]  back on sponsorship if if you know a certain point
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:40.960]  i'm not just going to keep expanding forever because it's dangerous to expand
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.760]  you can get infiltrated it's hard to manage things
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:46.640]  i need like four or five more editors four or five more camera people
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:51.200]  four or five more writers and some more customer service and it people i mean
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:54.240]  i need like 10 more people
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.360]  the problem is i hire those people i then can't give raises the other people
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:00.480]  unless we expand which is still a good mission
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:03.680]  because we need to expand i mean it's just it's all 360 win everything i do is
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:08.000]  about it's got to be a 360 win it's got to benefit everybody
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.600]  unless it's the globalist they're the parasites overrunning us giving us no
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:15.840]  quarter they must be defeated are we at roger stone yet
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:20.000]  all right we're getting him we're getting him lined up he came on on short
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.760]  notice and i'm yes some technical issues let's just go with oh if we can do that

[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:22.160]  of stonezone.com former head of the campaign
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:25.120]  the trump campaign his business partner of course is currently the head of the
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:28.560]  campaign and roger stone join us via video skype
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:31.680]  has written a powerful article for town hall about wood
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:37.840]  ronald reagan vote for donald trump and another powerful
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:41.760]  article that we've been covering the fact that he had many polls like rasmussen
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:45.120]  is now a head of hillary and i know i talked to stone and others over the
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:47.440]  weekend he said look at most polls they're dead here
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:51.760]  trumps ahead but that's internal polling hillary's putting out all these fake
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:55.120]  polls so to talk polls and to talk ronald reagan the gipper
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:58.960]  that's his article what would he think of the great trumpkin
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:03.360]  thank you for joining us mr stone alex great to be back with you
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:06.640]  i'm calling from the new york bunker today where i'm
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:10.640]  hunkered down in front of the computer writing well you've got the floor thank
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:14.080]  you for your time tell us tell us first about these polls
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:16.720]  uh and i know you like to be too optimistic but this is pretty exciting
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.800]  let's get into your article in town hall sure i think it's very important
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:25.280]  to understand the dynamics of this election in donald trump and hillary
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:29.760]  clinton uh you have uh very polarizing figures
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:32.880]  who have great intensity among their supporters
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:38.880]  and great animosity against their detractors there those who are opposed
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:43.520]  the end and the country is fairly evenly divided
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:50.400]  between left and right therefore um this race i think is never going to be
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:55.280]  in a situation in which either candidate is out of range
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:59.520]  of winning so it doesn't really matter whether
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:04.320]  donald trump is down five points next week but leading by five points
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:08.720]  the week after that i expect the race to seesaw
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:15.920]  polling is an art form but there are good pollsters and bad pollsters by me
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:20.240]  by that i mean there are accurate pollsters and there are pollsters who
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:25.600]  make methodological errors in terms of sure to try to create the
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:30.400]  perspective that hillary is really wanting well some of them certainly are
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:34.160]  the left-leaning polls take ppp for example
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:38.080]  um they'll never show uh the republicans winning in any state or
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:41.600]  or they'll never show numbers that are the hillary's 800 points ahead according
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:46.080]  to them yeah but look in all honesty we're starting the
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:50.800]  rasmussen poll today i would i've been very critical of rasmussen
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:56.800]  alex because uh three four years ago um he continued to take surveys
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:00.720]  without including gary johnson uh and judge dim gray
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:05.280]  two good friends of mine uh in his ballots uh and that's
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:09.040]  that's unprofessional they were on the ballot in 48 states absolutely what's
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:12.560]  the what can you tell us about internal polling i know some of that's held close
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:17.040]  to vest but i've talked to other folks they said well here all i can say
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:22.240]  and i can't this is anecdotal of course and in no way formal but i it is my
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:26.960]  understanding that in certain swing states uh
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:31.360]  acknowledging that uh the trump had a rough couple weeks
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:35.360]  uh but i think has certainly turned the corner on that and is now back on the
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:42.240]  upswing uh helped ironically uh by uh additional issues pertaining to
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:46.240]  uh international islamic terrorism uh
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:50.560]  in the several key states that you and i would both refer to as
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.560]  a swing state particularly some of the medium-sized swing states
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:58.880]  trump continues to lead and all the others he continues to hold his own
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:03.360]  uh if you're in this race if you're up three points well that's probably within
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:06.720]  the margin of error now there is a problem of
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:12.720]  chronically uh under uh sampling republicans that i have
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:15.680]  seen in many of these mainstream polls that's one way to
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:19.120]  cook the poll sometimes they over sample
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:24.400]  key democratic that key democratic groups that's also a way to cook these
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.440]  polls but so i just think all uh any consumer out there reading the media
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:33.520]  who reads about the polls should take them with a grain of salt
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:37.600]  uh trump's own polling and polling friendly to him shows that he is
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:41.200]  certainly in a position to win this race
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.360]  you never gave me any trump secrets uh i mean obviously that's why you're
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.320]  confident but but you did a few times say this is
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.120]  what you're going to see in wisconsin well this has been the real numbers
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:53.200]  this is what you're going to see in this state and you were just incredibly
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:57.040]  accurate every time so i know you like to low ball things so that people don't
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:00.640]  get too optimistic but i tell you he keeps getting more and more of these
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:03.840]  Reagan democrats and people that have never voted and i see the internet
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:07.600]  searches uh google can track this are a lot of people that have never voted
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.880]  are now really getting involved in looking at trump uh and a lot of folks
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:13.680]  are also scared to say there for trump is a political correctness but i think
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:16.720]  you're really going to go for trump i think you add that into the skew
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:21.520]  of the polls and i think trump really is i think trump's probably really about
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:24.320]  five points ahead i think he keeps hammering and savaging
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:27.520]  hillary then he's going to end up maybe beating urinal
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:33.120]  landslide well that is of course the strategic imperative of his campaign
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:36.560]  look alex if this election is about Donald Trump
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:41.120]  then then trump will lose but if this election is about hillary clinton
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:44.320]  which it should be because it's a referendum on the
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:48.160]  the past eight years and i think we all acknowledge her policies are
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:52.400]  essentially be a continuation of stay there she's the
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:56.480]  establishment it needs to be hey he's new she's old we need to get rid of her
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:59.360]  she's guilty for where we are great point roger stone stay with us

[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:51.520]  of the chinese he said the chinese are in a trade war with us and she's an
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:55.360]  agent against us in that war and the era of surrender is over
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:55:01.600]  we're already in a trade war and we're losing badly this is pure veritas

[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:07.280]  and then let's get into what the ronald reagan
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:10.640]  think of trump because you know you know both men very very well
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:13.360]  and no trump
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:18.240]  so alex um first of all i appreciate uh info wars uh
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:22.720]  publishing my my piece which makes the very case that reagan
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:25.920]  and trump were very similar in many ways both
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:31.600]  on the back the leaders in american power and american sovereignty uh both
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:36.720]  nationalists both outside the control of the wall street
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:42.160]  uh k street elite certainly reagan had his relationship
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:45.600]  with them but he was it like trump he was an outsider
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:50.240]  he came from a different discipline than politics that being entertainment
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:54.560]  uh but he also had the larger than life
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:59.520]  celebrity quality that trump has when you meet trump you know you've met a
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:03.840]  superstar i mean he has a presence
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:07.760]  that is filling arenas across the country in the last year
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:14.240]  and like uh reagan i think donald has ability to make himself understood he
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:19.520]  talks in a way that people can relate to uh like reagan he talks
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:23.280]  in a way that working people particularly
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:28.560]  can relate to beyond that he has a great sense of humor as reagan did
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:33.120]  and uh he's a he's a fighter they were both a fighter when reagan
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:36.800]  um was on the verge of knockout in the 1976
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:40.720]  campaign after taking beating after beating after beating
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:45.680]  by juror ford he stayed in the race when all of his top advisors and i was a
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:49.280]  junior advisor but or junior staffer but
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:53.120]  all of his top advisors and his wife were telling him to get out you're done
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.360]  get out and he dropped out then in 1976
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:01.040]  he would never have been the nominee four years later it was only seeing it
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:05.520]  through to the convention and fighting it out and losing by a handful of votes
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:09.040]  that positioned him for the nomination four years later
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:14.240]  so trump has that fighter instinct that that you know he's a brawler this guy
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:19.280]  can't wait to take on the left uh and hillary clinton uh must know at this
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:22.400]  point that all of her crimes are going to be
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:26.800]  delineated by the republican candidate every single one of them
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:30.320]  in terms that people can understand
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:34.480]  i mean i know that trump and reagan had had dinner at some dinners and had had
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:38.640]  met each other do you know what reagan thought of trump or did it ever come up
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:42.800]  well it's interesting uh president reagan like president nixon who
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:46.080]  met dialed trump in george steinbrenner's private box in
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:50.080]  stadium uh both reagan and nixon urged
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:54.240]  trump to run for public office now in nixon's case
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:56.960]  he said you know donald you might want to take a look at
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:00.480]  the governor's office first but uh trump um
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:03.360]  it frankly is too big for the governor's office i should say the governor's
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:07.760]  office is too small for him his focus has always been on
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:11.120]  national issues and international issues like trade
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:16.240]  so uh but it's interesting that two of the best politicians of the last 40
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:20.640]  years both met trump and urged him to run for public
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:23.840]  office absolutely but you know having
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:25.840]  trump running just be a governor that's like
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:29.360]  shamu at sea world it just doesn't fit that's why it's
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:32.080]  animal torture in my view and i'm not even a pete supporter
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:35.440]  we'll be back in 70 seconds with one more segment with roger stone then it's

[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:28.800]  we started the term 1776 worldwide popularized the term that an economist
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:34.080]  gave me dancer 1974 1776 but now from the financial times of
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:37.520]  london to new yorker magazine to you name it
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:41.920]  they're saying alex jones the mad prophet of the tea party it's spreading
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:46.240]  worldwide and of course trump is now the big mega god of the
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:49.920]  movement they use terms like that with a horrible infection and
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:54.880]  the cfr says it's spreading worldwide it's like they're having 1776 in europe
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:59.040]  now 30 because they've got 30 members would want to leave
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:04.080]  it was eight i mean i mean they are panicking nationalism is exploding
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:08.000]  our terms are getting picked up everywhere this is crazy roger
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.960]  i mean i'm telling you trump myself everybody this is the zeitgeist
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:14.480]  we ought to just be celebrating that populism is being reawoken your view on
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:19.120]  the brexit how big a deal is that it's enormous it shows that the new world
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:21.520]  order is being overturned and that the people are
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:26.640]  rising up they're no longer sheep being led to losing their freedoms and their
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:31.120]  economic prosperity so alex first of all as you know i
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:36.400]  keep a rule book called stone's rule yes and it guides everything it's the
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:41.760]  rules for politics and rules for food and rules for dressing and one of my
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:46.800]  favorite rules is white shirt can face equals confidence

[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:10.240]  so quickly before today's broadcast getting back to brexit in the few
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:13.520]  minutes we have left and then other tidbits we should know about
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:18.400]  well the the globalists are in full panic now because their their lives are no
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:21.600]  longer working uh trump gave an excellent trade speech
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:25.680]  yesterday uh he gave uh uh he is going to continue
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:31.520]  i think to decimate uh hillary clinton every day new things are learned
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:38.400]  uh today there is a story uh based on uh a a uh blockbuster new book by dr
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:41.920]  gerome coursey that clinton foundation funds were used to
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:45.680]  pay for a vacation for chelsea a foreign vacation
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:49.280]  used to pay huma avidine on the side while she was uh
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:54.960]  theoretically a full-time government employee uh used to pay uh all kinds of
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:59.520]  improper uh expenses to augment the lifestyle of the
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:04.640]  epically greedy uh hillary clinton
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:09.360]  can she withstand all this corruption and the secret service agents coming out
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:14.080]  against her and saying she's a demon i mean how can she stand
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:18.960]  well first of all we uh see the material and we probably think that it is
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:23.840]  getting wider distribution than is true the clittons are still very adept at
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:27.200]  using their spin machine oh they've had you banned everywhere in fact that's my
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:29.680]  last point for you i really noticing this more than ever
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:32.560]  they know trump gives them ratings so they show show short clips that don't
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:36.480]  really aren't powerful out of context and then talk about him but don't let
[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:39.520]  him be heard are you seeing that more and more on the tv
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:44.000]  well we can't complain about the coverage uh of his entire speeches
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:49.920]  in by the two cable networks but what you say say is particularly true of cnn
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:54.560]  there has been a sharp uh change in cnn's uh
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:58.560]  programming uh after trump wrapped up the nomination
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:01.680]  prior to that uh while i'm not saying that they were
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:04.880]  advocates or patrons in any way their coverage was
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:10.000]  somewhat fairer but now i think the clinton news network has uh has kicked
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:15.200]  in the high gear uh and therefore the greatest fears that trump will be heard
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:20.800]  fully heard if he is fully heard um you know they will lose
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:26.400]  roger we got 30 seconds left stonezone.com what other things are on your radar
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:31.920]  well we have to continue to look at the uh the money situation the gap between
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:36.240]  the hillary super PACs and the pro trump super PACs is daunting
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:39.200]  hillary's got 50 million listen if you can't do it because you're right in
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:41.360]  articles understand you do like four more minutes on the other side of this
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:44.640]  break because i want to ask you about just a message to trump saying he should
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:46.320]  spend his own money i want to get your view on that
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:49.280]  hey can you say five more words all right we'll be right back with roger
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:52.880]  stonezone.com we sell both his latest best-selling books
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:57.600]  at infowarstore.com discounted and that is hillary's war on women that i know
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:00.320]  you know about but give it to women that don't
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:05.360]  what the hell is the government up to government ran a simulation exercise in
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:10.640]  which there was a 10 year long global food crisis an info wars report by
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:15.360]  michael snider says that news of what is called the strategic national stockpile
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:20.000]  program which is very very secretive is storing at the very least
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.400]  seven billion dollars worth of medical supplies the npr reports that there are
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:28.480]  at least six of these warehouse locations across the nation and it's not
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:32.800]  even verified exactly how many there are the reason for secrecy is understandable
[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:35.600]  on the face of it you don't want some antagonistic group
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:39.520]  attacking a source of vital supplies during a crisis but what's up with the
[02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:42.640]  un vehicles by now everyone knows about the video
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:46.880]  recorded by jeff stern of heavily armed vehicles being transported on the

[02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:22.240]  from deep in the heart of texas it's alex jones
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:25.360]  thank you for joining us i'm alex jones your host roger stone saying a few more
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:28.400]  minutes with us because he's got a few other big bomb shells to
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:31.680]  lay on folks i was talking to him during the break so let's get to this first
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:35.280]  then the issue of Trump raising money uh and then
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:39.440]  one other tidbit he wanted to get to but i just sit there and monitor foxy and
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:42.960]  nms nbc you name it just kind of spot checking in
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:47.360]  i saw that incredible speech he gave um
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:51.040]  a few days ago and it got almost no coverage
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:54.000]  they would kind of miss report on what he'd done or just oh yeah we make better
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.880]  trade deals no it was hillary's working for the chinese
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:01.440]  we're already in trade war you know the surrender is over if americans saw that
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:05.120]  even brainwashed establishment liberals you gotta be for it i mean you know we're
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:08.480]  getting screwed over and and you know he's a great guy
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:12.400]  because if he was a shell he wouldn't give speeches like that this is causing
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:16.640]  irrevocable danger for them and i knew when i saw the speech
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:20.560]  uh because it was i guess monday or whatever when i was still on air
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:24.080]  and i saw it afterwards i sat there with my mouth hanging open with the crew
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:27.920]  we shot a video about it uh rob do it like tears in his eyes and literally it
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:32.160]  was it was so powerful and so real anti-new world order i mean he was this
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:36.160]  was amazing and then they just had little clips out of
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:40.800]  context real milk toast didn't play a lot of large pieces of it and so he's
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:44.480]  re-gibbing the speech i guess today because stone brought that up he said
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:47.840]  yeah they're trying to block this out so i'm gonna play basically that whole
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:51.680]  speech some of his other speech sunday and i think everybody should just
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:54.480]  really get these send these to friends and family
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:58.000]  really promote these your drudge link to it of course you know maybe drudge talks
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.480]  about how they're blackening out put it back out because
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:03.680]  i'm telling you what he's doing in in in my humble view
[02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:09.440]  is like absolute high noon to count dracula roger
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:14.000]  roger is this high noon to count dracula if we're able to get this uh
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.120]  info out to people are they blocking trump's speech
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:20.800]  what they're attempting to the problem is that was very easy to do
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:24.880]  in the 80s when the clintons had their political heyday because there were only
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:28.560]  three national networks cable tv was still in its infancy
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:32.400]  the internet is was not nearly as developed uh so
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:36.160]  but today consumers in this case voters
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:41.680]  have so much access to information that the the true story of bill clinton's
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:44.720]  sexual assaults and the fact that he's a sexual predator
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:48.800]  and the fact that hillary ran up ran the cover up and it was hillary who
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:54.080]  directed the campaign to threaten and bully and intimidate his victims
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:57.920]  is going to become public the the facts about the
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:02.560]  the death of vince foster uh by the way i don't think he was murdered but i do
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:07.120]  think she ordered his body moved uh we're going to learn the facts
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:13.520]  about the uh the clinton slush fund the so-called clinton foundation which is
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:18.560]  you know the largest international money laundering conspiracy
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:25.200]  in world history alex this is a maybe a three billion dollar fraud now so uh
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:29.200]  those kinds of blockbuster facts cannot be
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:35.600]  suppressed by a feeble outdated uh you know mainstream media
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:38.800]  i agree with you uh we're going to play that clip after you leave us here in a
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:42.000]  few minutes for folks that just tuned in part of the speech while i think it's
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:47.600]  the most powerful part but isn't the establishment media
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:53.440]  filled with hubris fueled with arrogance aren't they at risk of totally
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:56.800]  discrediting themselves and actually completely collapsing i mean the
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:00.400]  number show they've gone from you know 11 or 12 percent a few years ago in ap
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:04.000]  polls of the public trusting mainstream media to 6 percent i mean do they
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.400]  understand how they're really self-immolating and
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:10.160]  could this election for better or worse for trump
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:14.880]  really be the demarcation point of the death of the dinosaur media
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:18.400]  well it is conceivable alex never underestimates their
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:22.320]  their own their arrogance and their beliefs in their own power
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:27.680]  uh and sometimes they they do not have a recognition that uh that that power is
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:33.520]  dwindling so uh they they tend to mock what they can't
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:37.600]  understand and they don't know what the communications depends on the
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:43.360]  new age their savages well they they're it's it's arrogant then
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:48.160]  secondarily of course they have fewer and fewer and fewer voters and
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:52.240]  listeners as media becomes less diffuse and the fewer less
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:55.760]  listeners and viewers they have the less influenced sure and by savages
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:59.840]  they're playing an old 70s 80s 90 uh disinfo game would just
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:03.440]  blatant lies and and they don't understand they're fighting in 21st century
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:08.560]  theater well and and trump understands how to garner
[02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:14.320]  publicity free publicity in all mediums uh in a way that no one in our lifetime
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:17.440]  knows how to do he is the greatest showman who ever lived
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:20.880]  he's broken on through to the other side let's let's look at money then what i
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:22.720]  mean let's that when i mean obviously that's a problem
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:25.680]  i mean i don't see it as bad he said i'm not gonna take big money
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:28.720]  uh he wasn't really clear about it but okay he did that in the primary no one's
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:32.720]  ever done that in one he did it but i mean he's got to he's not bad for him
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:37.280]  to raise money as long as he sticks to his platform right
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:40.320]  well uh i think a couple things first of all
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:43.840]  money is not going to decide this race because no matter what trump does
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:48.640]  hillary will hillary's campaign and the efforts of her wealthy patrons like
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:53.120]  soros they will always have uh more money but
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:57.040]  hundreds of millions of dollars were spent against trump in the primaries
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:00.960]  uh and some well-crafted uh negative television ads
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:05.520]  were put up at velocities that should have had an impact but they simply
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:10.400]  have it the voters have wiped up so trump needs
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:14.880]  enough money to be competitive he doesn't need as much as she does but he
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:19.360]  needs enough to fly the plane to uh travel to
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:23.440]  he needs the tactical you know to like say she puts out of this info ad
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:27.920]  at 10 to 1 the truth trumps that pun intended he just puts out the truth to
[02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:31.280]  respond and then that gives him the the ability to beat her is that what you're
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:34.560]  saying i am i also urge anybody who's trying to
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:40.240]  understand the mind of donald trump uh to carefully watch his twitter feed
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:45.040]  uh he has he has said some things about globalism and americanism this week
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:50.880]  which i think are a signal to every patriot but he gets it
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:54.160]  amazing i'm gonna let you guys i know you're busy just ran over from
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:57.200]  from towers put back to the house where you go back over and in some meetings
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:00.480]  but uh roger stone joining a stonezone.com what was the other point
[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:02.320]  during the break you wanted to make it was one of the thing you brought up
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:07.920]  well i'll i get many many patriots ask keep asking me uh what is happening
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:11.280]  with the cleveland rally you you will remember that
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:15.200]  this began as the staff of the steel rally uh
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:19.520]  you and i and other others were uh booked to speak
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:23.120]  uh and then after trump wrapped up the nomination
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:26.400]  uh we converted it to the american unity rally
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:29.840]  the city of cleveland uh put forward a series of
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:33.520]  restrictions on our free speech our right to assemble those we couldn't could
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:36.800]  not do guaranteed hurting our people into a
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:41.120]  penned-off area with leftist clubs so you would have had violence
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:45.040]  uh right now uh so we went to federal court uh citizens
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:49.760]  for trump a fine grassroots organization that folks should sign up in that is
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:53.120]  distinct from the campaign but very well run and very effective
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:58.160]  was the plaintiff the left-wing aclu represented us because they agreed that
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:01.600]  the restrictions by the city were unconstitutional
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:08.080]  we won that lawsuit they changed the safety perimeter from four miles out
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:12.080]  from the stadium to one mile far more reasonable
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:15.280]  but they continue to stall on our permit
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:19.360]  now they're telling us we need a union approved soundstage
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:23.680]  uh that we need special city permits for what's going on here is
[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:27.440]  the democratic machine that runs cleveland
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:32.560]  knows that the longer they can delay our ability to both raise money to pay for
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:37.520]  and rally bodies for this rally they're enhancing the chances that it will not
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:40.800]  be a success so they intend to give us our permits
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:45.280]  i think knowing that we'll go litigate again if we must
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:49.120]  but that um in the end they'll they'll make their bar approvals
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:51.920]  so late that we will be precluded from having
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:55.440]  yeah they're running the clock on us so everybody just be there
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:58.320]  we're protesting for free speech we're protesting against globalism
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:01.680]  we're protesting against the sorrow scum that's going to be bused in
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:06.160]  and and everybody better be there okay i mean this is people's about 1776 and

[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:53.920]  directly to your calls in the next segment with a little bit of that
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:57.040]  speech where he talks about her being a foreign agent where we already have
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:00.160]  surrendered we're not going to surrender anymore uh this this is the
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:03.200]  speech hillary's afraid of this is the speech he gave a few days ago he gave
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:07.680]  it again today here it is hillary clinton and her campaign of fear
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:13.280]  will try to spread the lie that these are the trade war you already have a
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:22.560]  trade war and we're losing badly badly
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:26.800]  she hasn't completely backwards hillary clinton unleashed a trade war against
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:31.520]  the american worker when she supported one terrible deal after another from
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:35.600]  nafta to china to south korea it doesn't matter no
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:40.880]  matter where she went the american worker was hurt
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:44.240]  and you will be hurt worse than ever before
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:47.840]  if she becomes president of the united states
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:50.800]  that i can tell you
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:59.200]  a trump administration will end that war by getting a fair deal
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:04.560]  for the american people and the american worker the era of economic surrender
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:09.600]  will finally be over it'll be over you're not going to see it anymore
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:13.440]  although i can't guarantee it because after me they'll probably start doing
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:16.720]  it again but we will have four and maybe eight
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:21.200]  great great great productive years and we'll never go back and we'll make sure
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:24.160]  we never go back
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:38.160]  thank you thank you very much
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:41.120]  you know this is really important i'm going to come back and take your calls
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:43.920]  but when we post this to youtube places i'm going to put the rest of the speech
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:47.040]  on here because this is the speech hillary is scared of this is the
[02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:49.680]  donald trump speech they don't want you to see and it just gets more and more
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:54.880]  powerful and it's all true true true true true
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:20:00.240]  okay this is amazing i feel so good that i north john trump a year ago

[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.760]  right now on any issue uh you wish to break down or get into
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:28.000]  Jason in the great north of canada uh you're on the air welcome
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:31.920]  hi Alex yes sir yeah I had an idea regarding uh
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:37.040]  trump if he needs funding and uh I just I just want to share with you I don't
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:39.680]  know if it's a good idea or not you know I I don't understand all the election
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:43.600]  rules or anything like that but um if Trump needs money
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:48.000]  how about uh they set up some sort of donation
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:52.240]  uh type setup online or whatever uh with a fixed amount
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:55.840]  so either uh you know a dollar donation or
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:25:02.880]  like $17.76 something like that then what you do is you raise money
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:06.160]  all the donors you can't really call them lobbyists
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:12.640]  at $17 or $1 and you also have a very accurate count of the people
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:17.120]  supporting trump that you can use against the false narrative
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:21.760]  of Hillary's uh uh success
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:25.120]  that's a good idea I appreciate your call Jason I'm gonna go through a lot of
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:27.360]  calls quickly here but let me just briefly comment
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:30.240]  I didn't get Roger to talk about this we talked about it linked to conversations
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:33.440]  Sunday afternoon and this was not off record that this part because I have
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:37.920]  notes here that Trump won't sit there and do what
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:40.800]  Adelson wants to get the 100 or 200 million he's been offered so that's
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:44.160]  withdrawn to a great extent and that's that's newsworthy
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:47.440]  and these other people are offering big money and he just won't agree to do
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:50.880]  stuff when they tell him so he's not getting big money and that's just
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:54.480]  another endorsement of the guy it's like wow that that never happens to the
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:59.520]  presumptive nominee that said though the smart
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:02.960]  money is on the fact that Trump needs to just
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:06.640]  not just sell fun it's been it's 55 million now it was 45
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:12.080]  of his own money if he says he's got 10 billion dollars that's not just the assets
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:15.680]  of his buildings and golf courses and stuff
[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:18.720]  I know he's always used other people's money and investments made them money and
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:22.480]  made him money that's that's fine that's ethical you're running for the
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:25.920]  united states during a global crisis of world
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:30.240]  government you will be george washington 21st century if you deliver
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:32.880]  and stop this
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:36.560]  I mean most these guys are about to die with cancer and then they give all
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:39.360]  their money to some charity or something that the globalist grab and use
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:43.760]  you know don't be like Carnegie or melon of the fords or whatever
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:47.760]  the word is trump does have probably 15 20 million dollars in assets but it
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:50.720]  liquid maybe a couple billion and I don't know if that's wrong but
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:54.400]  that's how it usually works okay I know he wants to keep some money to battle
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:58.720]  the war chest that's smart spend a billion
[02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:02.080]  and I know he's a smart guy he thinks he could somehow sell fun it isn't
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:04.960]  happening so far you know or small donations and I think
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:09.120]  Trump should just say something like I'm giving 10 million dollars
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:14.560]  will you match it and then people do give 1776
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:18.000]  so we can call this this video right here's we're live
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.200]  a plan for Trump to raise a billion dollars release I mean that's a smart
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:23.920]  plan you know he starts giving a 10 million
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:28.240]  dollars a week of his own money he goes out pledges it has the check
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:32.480]  and then it's a you know publicity event and as he goes to these states he says
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:36.560]  I need all you to go to my political website and he gives out the URL
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:40.640]  I need you all to give 1776 and invest in your children's future and our
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:43.840]  whole future that's what I'm doing and I'm giving back now
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:48.240]  I know it's very hard for people that are able to amass these giant fortunes
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:52.400]  to just just just just put money out there without other people
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:57.680]  being part of it so I think that's probably the way for him to do this but
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:00.960]  I think that says everything I mean look they've got it all written where
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:03.200]  special interests can come in and manipulate stuff but they don't want
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.800]  rich people who could be mavericks like a Ross Perot or a Donald
[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:10.400]  Trump to do this and that's the other issue we know
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:13.760]  they threatened Ross Perot's family threatened to kill his wife he said the
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:16.400]  Bushes did it I mean they came out in the news he gave a press conference
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:19.200]  almost nobody covered it yes my wife and daughter were
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:21.760]  threatened and you know I'm done but you want them
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:26.080]  you're crazy if you go with this bush all I'm telling you're right now
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:30.480]  by the way napkin get you're here giant second sound you want to lose your jobs
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:34.080]  I've got polls out where 37 percent of employers say if things go to $15 an
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:37.600]  hour minimum wage they're gonna lay people off you'll have to those are
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:40.640]  entry-level jobs where you're hiring some teenager for six seven
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:45.280]  bucks an hour they're not even worth it to train them at that level
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:49.120]  I mean you got to bring in say five six interns before you find a couple that
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:51.440]  are good we just do paid interns but then
[02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:54.160]  people better work immediately and we find some really good people
[02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:57.840]  but usually interns are so dumb in college that they go get a job at a radio
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:02.240]  station just kind of lazy kind of do anything get you any lunch
[02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:05.360]  oh what do I do man I went an intern in radio I was like
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:07.760]  let me help you cut those ads let me learn to splice that back there was
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:13.920]  still cutting the the uh you know the film the uh tape
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:16.640]  and let me get into sales yeah let me go into sales meetings let me go to a
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:19.280]  sales lunch with you let me get into sales let me see what I can do yeah I
[02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:22.640]  want to get on air yeah yeah yeah
[02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:25.360]  then of course the jealousy kicks into the sales people's a year later when
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:28.720]  you're making more money than they are and you're younger you're better looking
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:31.680]  you got top ratings better than Howard Stern had at night
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:34.240]  he was on the same station as me I had better ratings at night than Howard
[02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:37.280]  Stern had locally they were paying like 300 grand a year for a show
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:39.680]  and they just flood they just it was really where they got a new manager
[02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:42.720]  they were like so jealous that's what I started to figure out a lot of people
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:45.920]  don't like success really hold on we're gonna go right back to your calls
[02:29:45.920 --> 02:29:49.520]  Nathan, Trance, Margaret, Mika, Buckley and others
[02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:58.240]  on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:05.280]  what the hell is the government up to government ran a simulation exercise
[02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:09.120]  in which there was a 10 year long global food crisis
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:13.360]  an info wars report by Michael Snyder says that news of what is called the
[02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:18.080]  strategic national stockpile program which is very very secretive is
[02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:23.040]  storing at the very least seven billion dollars worth of medical supplies
[02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:26.720]  the NPR reports that there are at least six of these warehouse locations
[02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:31.040]  across the nation and it's not even verified exactly how many there are
[02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:34.480]  the reason for secrecy is understandable on the face of it you don't want some
[02:30:34.480 --> 02:30:38.480]  antagonistic group attacking a source of vital supplies during a crisis
[02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:42.640]  but what's up with the UN vehicles by now everyone knows about the video
[02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:47.440]  recorded by Jeff Stern of heavily armed vehicles being transported on the highway
[02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:51.680]  in virginia again i ask what the hell is the government up to
[02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:54.880]  what's going on and what are they preparing for

[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:01.520]  all right i'm gonna shut up i apologize uh let's go to uh mica
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:06.320]  in california you're on the air worldwide hi alex
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:13.280]  um i know you like to um cover cps stories about
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:18.640]  um the cps taking away children needlessly well i don't like to cover
[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:21.680]  it and quite frankly i kind of shy away from it because it gets me really
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:26.720]  freaked out but but but yes we do cover it sometimes cover it better and
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:32.480]  more than most so um one thing that i've noticed is that
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:37.120]  no one has really asked the question why have the children
[02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:41.440]  of the fan burr dino shooter and the orlando shooter
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:45.440]  not been taken away from their families holy mackerel i didn't even know that
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:48.640]  was the case yeah they can take your kids away for
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:51.280]  some cases yelling at them they claim or letting your 10-year-old play in the
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:54.640]  backyard at six o'clock in the afternoon if you go to get a pizza uh
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:58.880]  everything we did as kids but but but you're or or or i guess your kid says i
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:02.160]  want brownies the word brown is is racist now or whatever the police get
[02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:05.840]  called you're you're telling me i i didn't know that they didn't take the
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:10.240]  kids away from those freaks if they have i haven't heard about it and
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:13.680]  that's what's concerning me they can take it away if you smoke pot
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:17.120]  but when your family members shoot 50 people
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:20.720]  you know then the kids go to the grandparents i was about the or the
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:25.040]  wife i was about to add it's apples and oranges
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:29.120]  but bill clinton's the one that set a quota where every year if the locals get
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:32.400]  federal money the quota on the number of kids taken has to
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:35.760]  increase just like it was bill clinton came up with minimum
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:38.160]  sentencing and then black people worship him
[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:42.480]  when he's totally a known racist i mean you did have a baby with a black lady
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:46.560]  but the point is in the deep south stuff it's like a culture to feed on black
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:49.760]  people like tulia texas were you know and 90 something
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:53.680]  percent of the prison population was black and then uh and then the local
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:56.480]  town whites actually own the private prison
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:59.920]  they were planning drugs on the remaining like 85-year-old black people
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:02.880]  with no criminal record just to put them in prison and take their property i mean
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:06.400]  there is that type of racism that goes on and then when it goes on nothing's
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:09.920]  done about the real bona fide that you can have through a police state but
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:12.560]  yes sometimes social workers do a great job i know
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:14.800]  social workers that help old people do a wonderful job
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:17.520]  sometimes they work with realtors to know when somebody's old and sick to help
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:21.040]  take their house uh so it does attract predators
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:23.680]  there's a lot of child molesters that get into it
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:27.840]  and uh absolutely uh they let muslims do stuff to their women and their kids
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:30.720]  that's illegal because it's quote their culture
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:34.000]  uh and so i should look into that i mean are you sure that or are you asking
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.560]  that question no this is this is something that i
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:40.960]  haven't heard anyone follow up on and i would love to hear you follow i know
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:44.400]  this what type of freaks would go kill their co-workers for a la and then not
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:48.720]  and do that i mean and leave your kids behind that's a great point
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:53.440]  but again the this is the freakish behavior i appreciate those points
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:56.720]  and i'll tell you it's the worst i've ever seen it even in british news papers
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:00.640]  now they won't say islamic terror and i sat there
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:04.800]  yesterday and some this morning watching manouche
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:08.560]  and they would not call it islamic terror or jihad or even isis
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:11.840]  okay i mean they won't even say who takes credit for stuff now you got to dig
[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:16.160]  that isis took credit for the attack in uh turkey that killed
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:19.600]  40-something people the bombs machine guns oh guns are illegal but it still
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:24.320]  happened and but but they say we've got to
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:26.720]  have more checkpoints and more of your rights taken
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:33.520]  because this happened in turkey it's very very very very very very frustrating
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:36.960]  i want to go to more of your calls and then i've got to get to this clip
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:39.360]  that was matt pointed this out this morning he said you got to play this
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:41.840]  alex and he's absolutely right i'm really bad
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:46.960]  i'm gonna get to these bombshell clips um morning show blast loretta lynch
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:50.400]  for privately meeting with bill clinton i'm an email probe
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:54.560]  msnbc meanwhile lynch said no conflict of interest in clinton
[02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:57.440]  investigation despite obama endorsing of hillary
[02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:02.800]  ladies and gentlemen it is totally illegal
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:07.360]  when the justice department is over the fbi and the fbi is involved in a
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:11.920]  criminal admittedly investigation of hitlery
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:14.880]  to have her meet
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:20.720]  with the clinton's i mean this is unbelievable
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:23.600]  but it's just like obama saying i'm gonna open the borders up to illegals
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:27.280]  and not even test them for diseases you don't even care about the illegals
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:32.160]  no it's about just just like i need another book or something like a smash
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:34.560]  something together let me bring another book please

[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:05.520]  stinking globalist who just like buzzards they want rotten dead
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:14.560]  societies they can feed on

[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:39.440]  but i started thanks for my child i kind of put together
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:43.200]  um i was growing up a good friend of mine actually my best friend
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:48.960]  um their family hosted the clinton at their private house
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:53.200]  uh for a campaign for one of the democratic
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:57.440]  um i believe it was a governor running at the time back in 2000
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:03.200]  but they hosted the clinton's at their private residence um
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:07.440]  and the guy what he's a arab american a therian
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:10.640]  american and i was researching just as of late

[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:28.640]  interests it's sickening
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:32.960]  well what i was seeing is i'm thinking is you know this may be wide that uh
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:35.840]  the trump campaign is having some problems in cleveland getting things you
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:38.880]  know going and just from growing up in cleveland i know how
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:43.600]  kind of backdoor mobish like uh under the table
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:47.280]  dealings there is and especially you know when you got somebody
[02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:50.880]  sure well i want to explain something to everybody when they act like thugs and
[02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:54.480]  try to block us and we win the federal lawsuit and then they still
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:57.440]  claim they're going to back off but just give us a new bs plan
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:00.480]  we're winning we're making them act like the thugs they are
[02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:03.520]  and we're showing up
[02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:07.600]  and we're going to be mental cultural and physical giants
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:12.640]  compared to the drooling idiot rena mobs of uh you know the slaves of sauron
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:17.360]  the slave excuse me the slaves of soros and that was actually a Freudian slip
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:21.520]  i literally just said that that was not on purpose uh the slaves of the nazi
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:24.800]  collaborator dart bag so i'll be there we're all going to be there
[02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:28.240]  and we're going to have airplanes flying around hillary for president i got a
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:31.840]  bunch of tricks up my slave so get ready
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:35.200]  um we had to go get water for bill clinton
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:39.520]  because he actually wouldn't drink any water that was uh i think it was
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:44.480]  avian that at the time um that they had for the party the
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:47.120]  fundraising we actually had to go get him some kind of different kind of water
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:50.640]  what kind of water do you want what kind of water do you want
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:55.600]  well actually uh he wanted something american made which i can respect that
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:59.600]  but if you want to get better you know political um correctness you know wouldn't
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:02.720]  that be racist i mean well that's his friend on it he probably had a
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:06.560]  particular brand he wanted was it uh
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:11.040]  no i believe it was just something that they had um in the cleveland area

[02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:01.360]  a scope of it um so you've been listed since you were a little kid
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:05.360]  who wasn't your family but they have you listed short waiver
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:10.480]  no i'm i'm you know young hacker i did my own
[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:14.640]  priority and sure i must have misheard you i thought you said you're 22 years
[02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:18.000]  old you've been listening for 20 years i must have misheard that
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:22.320]  oh no i'm 26 i all right i guess you had a little trouble with your audio go
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:26.320]  ahead all right um i was calling because i wanted
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:32.240]  to uh speak on the globalist weapons and their uh newest
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:38.720]  methods of invading every bit of our lives and one thing that most people
[02:47:38.720 --> 02:47:42.320]  haven't even really recognized this is something that i recognized
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:46.800]  after uh my father had been in the military for 20 years and
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:53.360]  i joined when i was uh old enough i found there were some things that
[02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:57.040]  the people should know but i couldn't speak on them because of my clearance
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:48:00.400]  even to the day i still can't say exactly what they are
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:07.920]  but i can uh give you a taste of something that i found odd
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:11.440]  uh yesterday i was just you know writing my bite
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:18.880]  coming from an interview and my phone did something really odd it
[02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:24.080]  started to uh dial some numbers that i've never seen
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:28.080]  sure and i don't even know and then once they do that to you
[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:31.360]  they can then claim those are numbers of watch
[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:34.960]  and so then they can legally open up an investigation on you or your phone's
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:37.200]  been hacked by somebody else but let me give everybody a big secret about
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:39.520]  classification our government since the national
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:44.160]  security act in 47 has classified hundreds of millions of news articles
[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:48.080]  that were in the newspaper that means their own people can't talk
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:51.200]  about it in the government so they classify it when they show you they're
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:56.640]  spying on us illegally and stuff show that you feel like you can't ever talk
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:48:59.920]  about something that was illegal even though the illegal program had
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:04.960]  congressional funding you understand so so they tend to
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:10.320]  classify general program systems but the pieces they had to build it had to
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:12.320]  be approved and run through and weren't classified
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:16.160]  that's why i don't need cy hirsch or i don't need steve pacinic
[02:49:16.160 --> 02:49:20.320]  or i don't need tim kennedy to tell me any stuff that's going on with things
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:23.520]  i've already reverse engineered it all and it's all in white papers or i can
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:26.400]  go read what the globalists wrote in the 50s and they they've done everything
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:30.080]  they wanted that far now i see the next phase of what they want to do
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:35.120]  and my god if they get this in i mean 20 30 years maybe sooner we're all dead i
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:38.800]  mean they plan to set up a total robot takeover get every form of the economy
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:41.120]  controlled get everything actuary down and then just
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:43.680]  start bio wepting whoever's left i'm sorry though
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:46.720]  what do you think's going on with your phone my friend
[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:50.640]  um honestly i know exactly what it is that's what disturbs me because it was
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:54.800]  a system that i worked on with in the military okay well was i correct or
[02:49:54.800 --> 02:49:58.400]  was it a thing to the geo located
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:01.920]  it's a yes you're right it's a geo it is a geo located
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:05.680]  certainly this is what i told you that was in the 1996 telecommunications
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:09.200]  act by law about 2000 all quote new phones
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:12.640]  have to have that uh and but i don't understand the reason you say it was
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:16.320]  randomly dialing numbers uh unless the cell tower it was
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:22.000]  sending out a code to basically integrate that into a local
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:25.760]  template of some local governmental or substrata group
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:29.280]  that was jacking into that data not pulling it off the main central nsa
[02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:33.760]  control panel it was uh it was uh how do you say it was a
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:37.120]  encryption the way i know it was encryption was because these numbers
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:40.640]  weren't phone numbers they were codes they were codes that
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:46.080]  are used on certain systems that um sure that but i'm saying you were seeing a
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:48.480]  readout probably i mean i'm not the engineer there's too many different
[02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:51.440]  programs but it was hitting your phone with the commands is what you're
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:54.800]  saying yeah but what i'm telling you is
[02:50:54.800 --> 02:50:58.080]  that's not secret though i know you were in a secret program they told you that
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:02.160]  was secret their their operation isn't here's Dr. Paul Meyer Christian

[03:00:20.240 --> 03:00:23.360]  where they're trying to turn everything into supposed racism they're there

[03:00:33.600 --> 03:00:37.520]  saying it's a hate crime against a loving group
[03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:40.800]  i mean it's it's just it's just unbelievable
[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:44.480]  that we have gotten to this point meanwhile guns from fast and furious
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:49.760]  show up in the paris attack that's up on infowars.com
[03:00:49.760 --> 03:00:55.840]  let's go to matthew in new york you're on the air thank you for calling
[03:00:55.840 --> 03:00:59.920]  hey alex that will face it here i've been thinking about uh how trump could pull
[03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:02.880]  off his terrorist his uh terror threats and when i'm
[03:01:02.880 --> 03:01:05.680]  discussing it with friends they immediately think the plans are too risky
[03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:09.040]  and he'd they'd rather sit back and write like we are today
[03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:12.320]  but uh what do you think of when he gets an office he makes a statement that
[03:01:12.320 --> 03:01:16.080]  like on july 4th 2018 usa will start to enforce
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:19.840]  terrorist imports and countries were in violation but before he does all that
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:23.200]  his staff creates a comprehensive list of all the industries that are lacking
[03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:26.880]  in the usa and start like a one trillion dollar grant program
[03:01:26.880 --> 03:01:30.560]  to start to encourage americans not the elite not people currently own businesses
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:34.240]  to start businesses so that by july 4th 2018 whatever
[03:01:34.240 --> 03:01:37.760]  date he actually sets will be prepared and we won't have to
[03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:40.480]  that's right that's right i mean i mean it's in the campaign he look he's saying
[03:01:40.480 --> 03:01:43.920]  he's not going to let china have these these manipulated internal tariffs that
[03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:46.320]  are illegal uh and then he's going to leverage and get
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:49.280]  better deals well that's very easy to do because the globalist plan
[03:01:49.280 --> 03:01:52.960]  is to deindustrialize us and to make us dependent that's why it's the deals are
[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:57.040]  all so horrible and one-sided is because it's meant to be that way the only thing
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:01:59.120]  they were supposed to protect their globalism
[03:01:59.120 --> 03:02:02.720]  if you know it's the whole rollerball scenario where
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:06.240]  you know this country's over this and you know one's over energy one's over
[03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:09.120]  media one's over military one's over manufacturing
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:12.640]  there's been a deal made china's been cheating and i'm against the globalist
[03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:15.440]  deal where they get to be the world economic power and have all the rare
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:18.720]  of minerals and the ports and then we get to be the military power and then we
[03:02:18.720 --> 03:02:21.600]  counterbalance each other but of course it's a double
[03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:24.400]  cross from the beginning but that's the essence of what globalism
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:28.240]  is uh so absolutely and plus china's already been double crossing the
[03:02:28.240 --> 03:02:32.160]  the Anglo-americans so that's why there's a little more support in some sectors
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:35.600]  that are more patriotic of the power structure to let trump get in and do
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:38.880]  this anyways because the elite realize they're being screwed over and the
[03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:40.800]  chinese are like just come on over and live here
[03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:44.480]  like george soros and people like that just come over here and retire and
[03:02:44.480 --> 03:02:48.640]  you know just we're gonna win so just go with us uh i appreciate
[03:02:48.640 --> 03:02:52.480]  your call let's talk it was good point talk to derrick in the great state of
[03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:56.640]  tennessee the volunteer state go ahead derrick
[03:02:56.640 --> 03:03:01.520]  hey there alex hey brah i've just got one question for uh i've had this question
[03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:05.280]  on my mind for quite a while and uh i really don't know any other
[03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:08.000]  platform to maybe get noticed with it
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:11.360]  you know i've got one question that uh donald trump could ask this the american
[03:03:11.360 --> 03:03:15.520]  people and the u.s government and that is how can
[03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:19.440]  anyone the government anyone force a free people such as ourselves
[03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:23.360]  to purchase an imaginary product like obama care
[03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:28.000]  from a third party profiteering entity the insurance company
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:33.040]  which is predominantly foreign i mean it's a foreign global tax
[03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:38.240]  our political elite have rented us out like a like a like a cheap pour
[03:03:38.240 --> 03:03:42.480]  who's got cigarette burns all over and pus dripping out of her eyes
[03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:46.880]  uh i mean i mean they've already beat us with coat hangers
[03:03:46.880 --> 03:03:50.400]  uh but now we're so sick and you know feeble and basically they're renting
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:53.840]  us out to a vampire that wants to drink what's left of our precious bodily
[03:03:53.840 --> 03:03:57.280]  fluids to quote jack t ripper i mean it's such an
[03:03:57.280 --> 03:04:02.960]  galactic supreme overlord screw job that i totally absolutely agree with you i
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:06.320]  don't have any words to describe how redonkulous it is
[03:04:06.320 --> 03:04:11.200]  and then a trump just gets up and says i'm gonna make the vampires you know
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:14.560]  you know get off of you for a little while they're like how dare you
[03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:20.000]  do you see how sparkly their white teeth are i mean it's just amazing
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.960]  yeah i like i say i just uh that's the one question it would come out of
[03:04:22.960 --> 03:04:26.000]  donald trump's mouth um you know maybe we get enough people
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:29.520]  behind us and it'd be that leonidas spear moment it lurks absolutely
[03:04:29.520 --> 03:04:32.720]  yeah brother good point darryl i'm gonna come back and finish up real fast with a
[03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:35.280]  few more calls and hand the baton to nthony gucciardi
[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:37.600]  and then you guys a special video come with the bottom of the hour i still
[03:04:37.600 --> 03:04:40.000]  haven't aired the rob new video it's a special report
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:43.360]  but it's up on info wars dot com i'm gonna retweet it out right now how the
[03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:46.480]  global elite have been caught red-handed admitting they're gonna use food as a
[03:04:46.480 --> 03:04:49.840]  global weapon that's one more reason i'm saying right now
[03:04:49.840 --> 03:04:53.200]  20 to 40 off one of the best specials you've ever done
[03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:57.280]  very hard to get the the the the maker of this let us do it but it's available
[03:04:57.280 --> 03:05:02.800]  right down in four store dot com what the hell is the government up to
[03:05:02.800 --> 03:05:07.840]  government ran a simulation exercise in which there was a 10 year long global
[03:05:07.840 --> 03:05:11.600]  food crisis an info wars report by michael snyder says
[03:05:11.600 --> 03:05:15.840]  that news of what is called the strategic national stockpile program
[03:05:15.840 --> 03:05:19.840]  which is very very secretive is storing at the very least
[03:05:19.840 --> 03:05:24.320]  seven billion dollars worth of medical supplies the npr reports that there are
[03:05:24.320 --> 03:05:28.400]  at least six of these warehouse locations across the nation and it's not
[03:05:28.400 --> 03:05:32.000]  even verified exactly how many there are the reason for secrecy is
[03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:35.520]  understandable on the face of it you don't want some antagonistic group
[03:05:35.520 --> 03:05:39.360]  attacking a source of vital supplies during a crisis but what's up with the
[03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:42.480]  un vehicles by now everyone knows about the video
[03:05:42.480 --> 03:05:47.280]  recorded by jeff stern of heavily armed vehicles being transported on the highway
[03:05:47.280 --> 03:05:50.960]  in virginia again i ask what the hell is the government
[03:05:50.960 --> 03:05:54.720]  up to what's going on and what are they preparing for
[03:05:54.720 --> 03:05:59.680]  this is gave gold diamond reporting for info wars dot com

[03:06:11.680 --> 03:06:15.440]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[03:06:15.440 --> 03:06:19.440]  and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they
[03:06:19.440 --> 03:06:22.880]  took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in
[03:06:22.880 --> 03:06:26.640]  and when the fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today

[03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:55.680]  maximum electricity with minimum money go to grid wars dot com
[03:07:55.680 --> 03:08:00.960]  that's grid wars dot com
[03:08:00.960 --> 03:08:16.880]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones only on the gcm radio network
[03:08:16.880 --> 03:08:31.120]  we now take you live to austin texas and a desperate attempt to fend off the
[03:08:31.120 --> 03:08:35.520]  globalist would you like to know more
[03:08:36.080 --> 03:08:40.480]  anthony good shardy riding shotgun with me in this hour tell me my friend what
[03:08:40.480 --> 03:08:43.520]  you have coming up and i'm gonna finish up with a few new stories and clips and
[03:08:43.520 --> 03:08:47.360]  hand the baton to you when they say it's a slow news day that just means there's
[03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:50.240]  more time to research stuff that no one else noticed
[03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:54.400]  like this is apple patent could prevent quote illegal iphone recording
[03:08:54.400 --> 03:08:58.560]  the patent could prevent iphone cameras from being able to record in concerts
[03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:02.560]  and classified facilities and they've always wanted that just like drones we
[03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:05.360]  buy suddenly won't even fly you know near areas they don't want
[03:09:05.360 --> 03:09:09.440]  downtown this is the pre-programming of everything to control society
[03:09:09.440 --> 03:09:12.800]  it's a total nightmare scenario i said this 10 years ago save your old
[03:09:12.800 --> 03:09:16.400]  camera save your old equipment because in the future you'll have to have that to
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:19.440]  be able to videotape anywhere they could turn them off nationwide if they want
[03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:22.400]  i mean who's to say what illegal is right i mean what if you're out
[03:09:22.400 --> 03:09:25.760]  and uh the police come and you want to film something but it's illegal you
[03:09:25.760 --> 03:09:29.200]  can't film oh no the police have already tried to get patents and again i'm not
[03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:32.320]  against the police themselves i mean it's big brother to where they can city
[03:09:32.320 --> 03:09:36.480]  wide turn stuff off or in a certain protest area exactly that's outrageous
[03:09:36.480 --> 03:09:40.000]  yeah there's there's no stopping it there's a bunch of news articles on zd net
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:44.000]  and tech sites apple granted patent for a way to stop iphone from taking photos
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:47.920]  or quote sensitive location so it means nothing it's it's it's a branch all
[03:09:47.920 --> 03:09:50.160]  term and we show up at the end of San Antonio right
[03:09:50.160 --> 03:09:53.760]  next to a walmart they're spying on us we're videotaping their front gate they
[03:09:53.760 --> 03:09:57.600]  come and say you can't do that there's no law and you know what also happens you're
[03:09:57.600 --> 03:10:00.160]  illegally spying on us while the border's wide open
[03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:03.520]  yeah exactly but we've been out before shooting stuff and security people come
[03:10:03.520 --> 03:10:06.560]  oh there's our logo in the background there's a bank or something you can't
[03:10:06.560 --> 03:10:10.480]  shoot here it's illegal right it's really not you can shoot whatever you want
[03:10:10.480 --> 03:10:14.000]  but in their words oh you can't have our logo in it anymore you're near a bank
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:16.640]  so what if they just say we can't shoot near this bank anymore and when we
[03:10:16.640 --> 03:10:20.880]  comply it creates this false illusion and illusion that's why whether it's a
[03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:23.920]  security guard whether it's a code enforcer or police officer
[03:10:23.920 --> 03:10:27.120]  don't let people give you orders that violate your own rights
[03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:29.680]  i remember a few years ago when we were still putting out the magazine it was a
[03:10:29.680 --> 03:10:32.240]  success but in the aggregate not as successful as digital
[03:10:32.240 --> 03:10:34.640]  so i got rid of it was just taking up too much time but
[03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:38.960]  i was handing out 50 000 free magazines over a week of south by southwest
[03:10:38.960 --> 03:10:41.680]  we hired official teams that do it for everybody else
[03:10:41.680 --> 03:10:45.120]  for restaurants bars you name it and they had the code enforcers come and say
[03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:47.840]  you can't do this i checked the code and i said no that's illegal we're not
[03:10:47.840 --> 03:10:50.560]  setting up vendor stuff whatever you can't stop us
[03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:53.440]  they ordered the cops to arrest our people and the austin police department
[03:10:53.440 --> 03:10:57.040]  said no to their credit because then i went down there to protest that the
[03:10:57.040 --> 03:11:00.560]  cops were like yeah no it's it's just outrageous
[03:11:00.560 --> 03:11:05.200]  but that shows who the chronicle that and lewis black who owned south by southwest
[03:11:05.200 --> 03:11:12.080]  what they think of america these are dangerous fascists
[03:11:12.080 --> 03:11:16.240]  well i mean obviously and also look at this majority of americans oppose
[03:11:16.240 --> 03:11:18.640]  political correctness i like this article from paul
[03:11:18.640 --> 03:11:22.480]  watson's on info wars common sense defies decades of media and entertainment
[03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:25.120]  industry reeducation i know you talked about this a little bit
[03:11:25.120 --> 03:11:29.120]  but what's interesting is i think if they rephrase the question in the poll
[03:11:29.120 --> 03:11:33.200]  the poll question was which is closer is there more political correctness in the
[03:11:33.200 --> 03:11:35.920]  united states or is there too much prejudice
[03:11:35.920 --> 03:11:39.040]  they should have just said do you support political correctness but even though
[03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:41.920]  they said it in such a way 51 percent of americans
[03:11:41.920 --> 03:11:45.120]  thought political correctness had gone too far in comparison
[03:11:45.120 --> 03:11:48.720]  to prejudice going too far so if they were to say do you support political
[03:11:48.720 --> 03:11:51.760]  correctness i bet it would have been way more but even though
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:55.680]  it was kind of like a tricky almost loaded question
[03:11:55.680 --> 03:11:59.920]  still the majority of americans say no political correctness is more prevalent
[03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:05.040]  than actual prejudice and what it is is cult language brainwashing to induce
[03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:10.480]  everyone into a totalitarian system of total language control beyond 1984
[03:12:10.480 --> 03:12:13.200]  thank you anthony we'll hand the baton to you in a moment now
[03:12:13.200 --> 03:12:18.320]  folks i've made films on this i have talked about this probably 3 000 times
[03:12:18.320 --> 03:12:23.200]  since the tsa was established 15 years ago i have always exposed that we've
[03:12:23.200 --> 03:12:26.240]  been dead on i remember seeing the tsa when they were
[03:12:26.240 --> 03:12:30.320]  getting uh congressional funding in 2002 about to become a cabinet level
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:34.320]  group underneath homeland security i remember
[03:12:34.320 --> 03:12:37.280]  watching a two-hour c span that we actually played clips up on there i
[03:12:37.280 --> 03:12:40.480]  wish i could find it somebody should go research because all the archives of
[03:12:40.480 --> 03:12:44.880]  of uh it was homeland security was becoming that
[03:12:44.880 --> 03:12:49.440]  national post and in the cabinet but tsa was about
[03:12:49.440 --> 03:12:52.560]  the national takeover in the uh the two-hour discussion
[03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:56.880]  so somebody should go find that and governor ridge was the head then
[03:12:56.880 --> 03:12:59.760]  and they were licking their chops about how soon there'll be checkpoints on
[03:12:59.760 --> 03:13:02.560]  highways bus terminals roads everything will be
[03:13:02.560 --> 03:13:05.360]  infrastructure protection not just bridges and dams and nuclear power
[03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:07.280]  plants and that soon you'll have to get government
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:11.520]  approval to have a job through the tsa
[03:13:11.520 --> 03:13:13.840]  and then sort of seeing them on the streets and the checkpoints and the
[03:13:13.840 --> 03:13:17.600]  mission creep and high schools using tsa for proms and
[03:13:17.600 --> 03:13:20.800]  then the fbi said we're going to have checkpoints at malls in case terrorists
[03:13:20.800 --> 03:13:24.480]  hit so you can't call it islamic terror you bring in the islamic terror you let
[03:13:24.480 --> 03:13:27.920]  the islamic terror strike the orthodox islamic
[03:13:27.920 --> 03:13:33.280]  mainline religion of peace you tell the public it's not islamic you can't say
[03:13:33.280 --> 03:13:38.800]  that and the media is so cult-like under political correctness they won't say it
[03:13:38.800 --> 03:13:42.000]  and now they're doing it oh my gosh you saw turkey
[03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:45.600]  we've got to put checkpoints they actually said
[03:13:45.600 --> 03:13:50.160]  when you enter the airport or maybe the parking lot or maybe at the entrance to
[03:13:50.160 --> 03:13:53.600]  the overall airport on the freeway you heard me right
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:58.080]  and all it'll be is more and more and more and more and more checkpoints
[03:13:58.080 --> 03:14:01.280]  and they even admit they're just going to keep them all now
[03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:03.920]  and then if you're a good little globalist you get let right through but
[03:14:03.920 --> 03:14:06.720]  if you're not oh sorry it's going to take eight hours
[03:14:06.720 --> 03:14:10.560]  this is the end of free travel the end of being open so i drew a little picture
[03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:14.240]  here for tv viewers let me describe this for radio listeners
[03:14:14.240 --> 03:14:17.920]  let's just say this is a normal terminal here i just scribbled this
[03:14:17.920 --> 03:14:21.360]  while auntie was talking and let's say this is the old classic
[03:14:21.360 --> 03:14:24.720]  thing you go through where you come into the airport and you go to the ticket
[03:14:24.720 --> 03:14:27.920]  machines or whatever or you go to the tellers
[03:14:27.920 --> 03:14:30.480]  and then you get your ticket and you just come over here you put your stuff on
[03:14:30.480 --> 03:14:33.920]  the line you take your shoes off and get trained how to be a slave then it
[03:14:33.920 --> 03:14:36.320]  goes to the metal detectors the naked body scanners that
[03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:41.520]  turn off makes all the money off up and you've got a big crowd of people
[03:14:41.520 --> 03:14:45.440]  you know a couple hundred of them all lined up here and a terrorist wants to
[03:14:45.440 --> 03:14:51.200]  hit a dense group of people with a bomb so that it kills hundreds
[03:14:51.200 --> 03:14:55.040]  kills the maximum amount you know their bomb of nails or whatever bb's all
[03:14:55.040 --> 03:15:00.000]  jacketed in her broken glass boom oh so let's just move it here
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:04.720]  so it so they don't hit here but now it's the same checkpoint right here
[03:15:04.720 --> 03:15:08.320]  now they're just going to blow this up okay well let's just move it out here
[03:15:08.320 --> 03:15:13.040]  to the parking lot then you know where we've got all the cars
[03:15:13.040 --> 03:15:15.760]  and they'll put a fence up around it they already have this set up i mean our
[03:15:15.760 --> 03:15:19.040]  austin berkshire just built this is a new airport and it's already set up to be a
[03:15:19.040 --> 03:15:22.400]  prison and then now you go through a checkpoint here
[03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:25.360]  and get searched oh but the terrorists would just blow that up okay well now
[03:15:25.360 --> 03:15:29.200]  we'll just go down the highway and you're like that doesn't make
[03:15:29.200 --> 03:15:32.640]  any sense you just need to stop folks coming in or
[03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:35.360]  profile people with terrorist connections and allow them to be rolled up
[03:15:35.360 --> 03:15:39.120]  oh no no no no no no no because then you can't indict
[03:15:39.120 --> 03:15:43.840]  with suspicion the all 330 million people so it's the criminal government at
[03:15:43.840 --> 03:15:46.080]  the top it's working with the islamics that's
[03:15:46.080 --> 03:15:49.440]  bought and paid for by saudi arabia that is letting saudi arabia build hundreds
[03:15:49.440 --> 03:15:52.160]  of mosques a year in the u.s that they pay for
[03:15:52.160 --> 03:15:55.440]  with their radical form of islam that is orthodox islam this is this is two plus
[03:15:55.440 --> 03:15:58.880]  two equals four it's not even that it's one plus one equals two it's not even
[03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:02.240]  that it's just how many fingers am i holding up
[03:16:02.240 --> 03:16:08.320]  five i mean it there is no debating this
[03:16:08.320 --> 03:16:11.840]  and so oh we're gonna let the illegals come in i'll even check if they have tv
[03:16:11.840 --> 03:16:16.240]  or all these other diseases kbz you name it uh we're gonna put them in school
[03:16:16.240 --> 03:16:20.720]  we're gonna let your kids get it it's a form of hospitality
[03:16:21.360 --> 03:16:24.880]  you're like how about treating the illegals no sorry
[03:16:24.880 --> 03:16:29.040]  oh later we'll treat them it'll be taxpayer expense so it is a collapse
[03:16:29.040 --> 03:16:32.640]  economy it is the sickest thing you could ever imagine
[03:16:32.640 --> 03:16:36.400]  and it it's a war on logic because these criminals know
[03:16:36.400 --> 03:16:40.160]  that they have got to destroy logic and common sense to win
[03:16:40.160 --> 03:16:45.040]  their in game and they dream of making your kids a bunch
[03:16:45.040 --> 03:16:47.920]  of lazy stupid jellyfish with worthless educations
[03:16:47.920 --> 03:16:50.720]  so they'll conform with the system and be socially engineered
[03:16:50.720 --> 03:16:56.160]  where you'll get your precarious paycheck every month on top of your job
[03:16:56.160 --> 03:16:59.120]  your job won't be enough to allow you to survive you'll have to have the
[03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:02.080]  supplemental income that's the model as walmart said
[03:17:02.080 --> 03:17:06.000]  where we pay you too little to live but you're allowed under law to get food
[03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:09.440]  stamps and some other welfare so you're actually working as a slave
[03:17:09.440 --> 03:17:13.520]  but you got to get money as welfare to survive and now you got to have
[03:17:13.520 --> 03:17:16.400]  inoculations this is what they're already doing in australia this is the
[03:17:16.400 --> 03:17:18.960]  plan here you've got to go to the social training we want
[03:17:18.960 --> 03:17:22.960]  you got to do national compulsory service not in the military but in new
[03:17:22.960 --> 03:17:27.600]  domestic stuzzy style creeperzoid grips this is all being set up
[03:17:27.600 --> 03:17:33.200]  it's all happening this is it to where no matter how much money you got you're
[03:17:33.200 --> 03:17:36.880]  going to have to serve the system total cult brainwashing
[03:17:36.880 --> 03:17:40.720]  this is so pathetically evil
[03:17:41.120 --> 03:17:44.320]  and everything they do is about getting you off the land getting you into
[03:17:44.320 --> 03:17:47.440]  controlled areas getting you into the system getting i mean i'm
[03:17:47.440 --> 03:17:51.360]  totally going more and more analog in my life i'm disconnecting more and more
[03:17:51.360 --> 03:17:54.560]  i come into fight in the matrix inside bathed in
[03:17:54.560 --> 03:17:58.480]  electromagnetic radiation and lights and all this it's like being tortured in
[03:17:58.480 --> 03:18:00.880]  here for four hours i'm much smarter when i'm not being you know
[03:18:00.880 --> 03:18:04.080]  blurring why it's my you know what i'm doing i love it it's even hurt my eyesight
[03:18:04.080 --> 03:18:08.800]  i don't care i love it but the point is i if you cannot be part of this
[03:18:08.800 --> 03:18:12.160]  it's a luxury not to it's a luxury to have a garden
[03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:15.840]  it's a luxury to have a little piece of land it's a luxury to carve wood
[03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:19.920]  it's a luxury to work on your own carburetor it's a luxury
[03:18:19.920 --> 03:18:24.480]  to prune your own roses it's a luxury to spend time with your kids on a hike
[03:18:24.480 --> 03:18:28.240]  everything the globalists are selling is death and lies and fraud everything
[03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:32.640]  trendy is pure evil to hurt you and your family
[03:18:32.640 --> 03:18:36.000]  period now before i go any further speaking of that i'm going to hand the
[03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:39.200]  baton to gucciardi we're running one of the biggest
[03:18:39.200 --> 03:18:41.840]  specials ever because i think everybody should get prepared everybody should get
[03:18:41.840 --> 03:18:45.040]  ready 20 to 40 off on info or select storeable foods i know i'm going to do
[03:18:45.040 --> 03:18:48.880]  this once a year or so i did a few months ago
[03:18:48.880 --> 03:18:52.160]  but because things are so serious i was able to call the producer

[03:26:57.840 --> 03:27:01.040]  hey it's good to be a little crazy right who wants to be normal
[03:27:01.040 --> 03:27:04.880]  i'll tell you what it's about to be independence day you know fourth of
[03:27:04.880 --> 03:27:09.040]  july and it makes me wonder also if you ask people what independence day is if
[03:27:09.040 --> 03:27:11.840]  they'd even know what it is if you didn't say fourth of july
[03:27:11.840 --> 03:27:18.080]  but you see independence is a scary thing it's independence from all forms
[03:27:18.080 --> 03:27:22.640]  of oppression and domination and that doesn't just mean
[03:27:22.640 --> 03:27:26.880]  you know in a government sense it means independence
[03:27:26.880 --> 03:27:31.040]  as in you're not depending on anything independence is scary
[03:27:31.040 --> 03:27:34.720]  independence of all forms right so independence from things
[03:27:34.720 --> 03:27:38.400]  like the social domination the verbal domination we get every single day with
[03:27:38.400 --> 03:27:41.440]  political correctness and that's one of the articles i'm going to talk
[03:27:41.440 --> 03:27:44.560]  about today that uh poll majority of americans oppose
[03:27:44.560 --> 03:27:47.600]  political correctness and how they kind of asked it in a weird way
[03:27:47.600 --> 03:27:51.520]  we're going to talk about real persecution instead of just fake
[03:27:51.520 --> 03:27:55.840]  political correctness when one gets upset and that is gay men in ivory coast
[03:27:55.840 --> 03:27:58.880]  attacked for showing support to orlando victims
[03:27:58.880 --> 03:28:03.680]  so in africa six gay men in ivory coast were abused and forced to flee their
[03:28:03.680 --> 03:28:06.720]  homes after they showed some support for the
[03:28:06.720 --> 03:28:10.000]  elando tax at pulse that's actual persecution
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:13.200]  we're going to talk about the grand illusion that we're all under in some
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:17.360]  ways and how that ties into this mutilated bodies wash up on the rio
[03:28:17.360 --> 03:28:20.480]  beach right right before the olympics exactly where they're going to play
[03:28:20.480 --> 03:28:24.880]  volleyball but everything's fine you know you think we might all be uh
[03:28:24.880 --> 03:28:28.480]  told some illusions as well and then some weird news too
[03:28:28.480 --> 03:28:31.760]  japanese porn industry says it's it's very sorry
[03:28:31.760 --> 03:28:35.520]  that actress was forced to have sex on camera extorted
[03:28:35.520 --> 03:28:38.880]  um french beach police are now going to carry guns
[03:28:38.880 --> 03:28:43.680]  with their swimming trunks and bulletproof vests because of terror threats
[03:28:43.680 --> 03:28:46.880]  and then we're going to talk about cannabis compounds could treat Alzheimer's
[03:28:46.880 --> 03:28:50.320]  by removing plaque forming proteins from brain cells and we're also going to
[03:28:50.320 --> 03:28:52.800]  talk about the truth about marijuana and how it has nothing to do with getting
[03:28:52.800 --> 03:28:55.520]  high in this sense and then another weird one too
[03:28:55.520 --> 03:29:00.800]  mounting evidence evidence suggests hobbits were wiped out by modern humans
[03:29:00.800 --> 03:29:04.880]  so hey lord of the rings was a true story all right Frodo was out there
[03:29:04.880 --> 03:29:11.040]  about 30 000 years ago apparently uh hobbits did exist but before that and
[03:29:11.040 --> 03:29:14.160]  before we get into apple this new patent that could prevent illegal phone
[03:29:14.160 --> 03:29:17.760]  recording so you're out at a public event or a concert or something and say
[03:29:17.760 --> 03:29:22.080]  sorry can't take a video something amazing happens you know
[03:29:22.080 --> 03:29:25.200]  asteroid coming down through the sky up you're at a concert can't take a picture
[03:29:25.200 --> 03:29:29.200]  of video um just doesn't work of course i've been
[03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:32.480]  talking about that for a long long time and now it's about to come
[03:29:32.480 --> 03:29:35.920]  we'll be right back and we are going to play a special report
[03:29:35.920 --> 03:29:38.640]  from alex in the next segment stay tuned
[03:29:38.640 --> 03:29:48.560]  baby baby i'm gonna leave you

[03:30:00.320 --> 03:30:05.200]  what the hell is the government up to government ran a simulation exercise
[03:30:05.200 --> 03:30:09.040]  in which there was a 10 year long global food crisis
[03:30:09.040 --> 03:30:13.280]  an info wars report by michael snyder says that news of what is called the
[03:30:13.280 --> 03:30:17.840]  strategic national stockpile program which is very very secretive

[03:30:22.960 --> 03:30:26.640]  the npr reports that there are at least six of these warehouse locations
[03:30:26.640 --> 03:30:30.960]  across the nation and it's not even verified exactly how many there are
[03:30:30.960 --> 03:30:34.400]  the reason for secrecy is understandable on the face of it you don't want some
[03:30:34.400 --> 03:30:38.400]  antagonistic group attacking a source of vital supplies during a crisis
[03:30:38.400 --> 03:30:42.560]  but what's up with the un vehicles by now everyone knows about the video
[03:30:42.560 --> 03:30:47.360]  recorded by jeff stern of heavily armed vehicles being transported on the highway

[03:34:29.760 --> 03:34:38.720]  and go to this report by alex right now
[03:34:39.040 --> 03:34:43.680]  42 years ago dr henry kissinger the known war criminal
[03:34:43.680 --> 03:34:48.480]  was secretary of state in the richard millhouse nixon administration
[03:34:48.480 --> 03:34:52.080]  and he authored national security study memorandum
[03:34:52.080 --> 03:34:56.320]  200 that remained classified for several decades
[03:34:56.320 --> 03:35:00.800]  in that memorandum now publicly available they talk about using food as a
[03:35:00.800 --> 03:35:05.440]  weapon and as a tool of social control not a new idea
[03:35:05.440 --> 03:35:09.360]  the romans have carried it out so the babeloneans the egyptians
[03:35:09.360 --> 03:35:14.400]  the ancient chinese it's known as siege control of food control of water
[03:35:14.400 --> 03:35:19.200]  you control a population but his aim wasn't just to use it for control
[03:35:19.200 --> 03:35:23.600]  his aim was to use it for depopulation to ship the west
[03:35:23.600 --> 03:35:27.440]  toxic waste of the third world that was just one of the sickening ideas
[03:35:27.440 --> 03:35:32.880]  in the declassified portion of this memorandum fast forward to 1992 in the
[03:35:32.880 --> 03:35:36.640]  Rio de Janeiro earth summit in Rio de Janeiro
[03:35:36.640 --> 03:35:42.240]  there globally we saw the planet codify a plan
[03:35:42.240 --> 03:35:47.360]  to not push for expanding human wealth and expanding human success and
[03:35:47.360 --> 03:35:50.960]  expanding the living standard but to reducing it
[03:35:50.960 --> 03:35:55.760]  and setting up a society based on making the people poor
[03:35:55.760 --> 03:35:58.560]  and setting up a global structure where having children
[03:35:58.560 --> 03:36:03.840]  is next to near impossible that is the world we live in
[03:36:03.840 --> 03:36:09.120]  if you go back to 2007 the british ministry of defense came out and
[03:36:09.120 --> 03:36:13.200]  echoed a department of defense report from here in the u.s saying
[03:36:13.200 --> 03:36:18.080]  the beginning in the year 2016 right through 2020 to 2030
[03:36:18.080 --> 03:36:21.840]  that they believe there would be massive multi hundred percent
[03:36:21.840 --> 03:36:26.400]  food price increases worldwide and that during
[03:36:26.400 --> 03:36:29.440]  that global meltdown that there would be incredible
[03:36:29.440 --> 03:36:34.000]  social unrest that would depopulate much of the earth
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:41.920]  now in 2016 vice magazine and other publications are reporting
[03:36:41.920 --> 03:36:46.720]  on a 2015 report produced by the u.s government the un
[03:36:46.720 --> 03:36:51.120]  and scores of foreign nations as well as the state department
[03:36:51.120 --> 03:36:55.360]  overseen by food giant cargill the world bank
[03:36:55.360 --> 03:37:00.560]  and most importantly the world wildlife fund the world wildlife fund
[03:37:00.560 --> 03:37:06.080]  is a eugenics anti-human organization set up by prince Bernhardt who also
[03:37:06.080 --> 03:37:09.360]  founded the Bilderberg group and it was a nazi officer
[03:37:09.360 --> 03:37:14.000]  he was also cousins and best friends with prince philip queen elizabeth's
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:17.440]  husband who says he liked to come back to the earth as a virus
[03:37:17.440 --> 03:37:22.880]  to kill 80 of the population he also doesn't believe that africans
[03:37:22.880 --> 03:37:28.080]  are people this organization sells environmentalism
[03:37:28.080 --> 03:37:32.080]  to make the elite look like heroes saving the earth when in truth
[03:37:32.080 --> 03:37:36.320]  they are ushering in a planetary tyranny that is irrevocably
[03:37:36.320 --> 03:37:39.840]  damaging the fabric of our planet in this new
[03:37:39.840 --> 03:37:44.800]  fema report with headline fema contractor predicts social unrest
[03:37:44.800 --> 03:37:50.800]  caused by 395 food price spikes you learn that this is a report filed with
[03:37:50.800 --> 03:37:54.480]  governments and major institutions overseen by a
[03:37:54.480 --> 03:37:59.440]  contractor that since the 1940s has been the main
[03:37:59.440 --> 03:38:05.040]  advisor for the us navy marine corps the game itself created an opportunity to
[03:38:05.040 --> 03:38:08.160]  live into the future it caused people to think through what the
[03:38:08.160 --> 03:38:10.880]  possibilities are and in that process i think they
[03:38:10.880 --> 03:38:14.560]  realized what they have to start to do today to prepare for the future
[03:38:14.560 --> 03:38:18.080]  the challenges and crises that we were assigned are exactly
[03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:21.840]  what we expect to see in the future so you've got famine you've got increased
[03:38:21.840 --> 03:38:24.720]  pests you've got the role of climate change in the world
[03:38:24.720 --> 03:38:28.400]  it's a world where it's getting hotter and it's getting drier
[03:38:28.400 --> 03:38:32.720]  we're also seeing increased social unrest because of the volatility in the
[03:38:32.720 --> 03:38:36.160]  food system food prices are going up 400 percent
[03:38:36.160 --> 03:38:40.080]  we've got a flood of migrants coming in the world is starting to fall apart
[03:38:40.080 --> 03:38:44.240]  everything we do is going to have some negative effect we are going to have a
[03:38:44.240 --> 03:38:48.960]  pretty hard world to live in the new normal is volatility
[03:38:48.960 --> 03:38:52.320]  you need to read the report and the articles about the report for yourself
[03:38:52.320 --> 03:38:56.960]  because it fits in to the defense department report
[03:38:56.960 --> 03:39:00.640]  now from about eight years ago nine years ago and the british report
[03:39:00.640 --> 03:39:04.880]  where they're acting like oh this is terrible but we believe this is coming
[03:39:04.880 --> 03:39:09.360]  from all of our experts but the experts are the eugenicists at
[03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:12.560]  goldman sacks jp morgan and other major institutions
[03:39:12.560 --> 03:39:18.080]  that have been admittedly artificially jacking up food prices worldwide
[03:39:18.080 --> 03:39:21.920]  financing the arab spring financing other revolutions
[03:39:21.920 --> 03:39:26.800]  to consolidate control everywhere whether it's venezuela or brazil
[03:39:26.800 --> 03:39:31.520]  or whether it is areas of spain or greece or idly
[03:39:31.520 --> 03:39:35.280]  central banks private banks are installing presidents
[03:39:35.280 --> 03:39:39.920]  and prime ministers they're threatening a eu military to take over eight nations
[03:39:39.920 --> 03:39:44.480]  they're trying to leave the euro who never even voted to enter it
[03:39:44.480 --> 03:39:48.480]  we are seeing an iron curtain of tyranny descend
[03:39:48.480 --> 03:39:53.040]  and it's the globalists that have been orchestrating a financial world meltdown
[03:39:53.040 --> 03:39:58.320]  that is triggered by a food meltdown there are major studies you can look into
[03:39:58.320 --> 03:40:02.560]  that win 50 of someone's paycheck or a family's earnings
[03:40:02.560 --> 03:40:08.160]  each month goes towards food civil unrest riots and destabilization are
[03:40:08.160 --> 03:40:11.920]  triggered if you look back at major university studies
[03:40:11.920 --> 03:40:15.520]  that have analyzed from the public records what happened during the 10-year
[03:40:15.520 --> 03:40:21.680]  depression from 1929 until about 1939 or 1940
[03:40:21.680 --> 03:40:25.680]  7 million americans starved to death or died
[03:40:25.680 --> 03:40:30.000]  from complications resulting from malnutrition to be clear
[03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:34.720]  upwards of 90 percent of the american population in the great depression
[03:40:34.720 --> 03:40:38.320]  lived in rural areas and more than half of them were self-sufficient
[03:40:38.320 --> 03:40:41.920]  today only 10 percent live in rural we're 90 percent urban
[03:40:41.920 --> 03:40:45.440]  and only half of the rural population is estimated
[03:40:45.440 --> 03:40:49.120]  to be self-sufficient that is five percent
[03:40:49.120 --> 03:40:53.120]  of the population think about it seven million dead with more than half
[03:40:53.120 --> 03:40:55.920]  self-sufficient what's going to happen when only five
[03:40:55.920 --> 03:41:00.160]  percent are self-sufficient and in this report
[03:41:00.160 --> 03:41:04.800]  put out by the world bank and the state department
[03:41:04.800 --> 03:41:11.600]  they talk about societal collapse due to this problem from crop failure
[03:41:11.600 --> 03:41:16.240]  to system failure but they're the ones managing the crisis
[03:41:16.240 --> 03:41:19.280]  that they've helped create they're the ones that think they're going to ride
[03:41:19.280 --> 03:41:24.560]  this tiger to burn down society and have a global
[03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:28.400]  fund set up like the marshal plan after this meltdown
[03:41:28.400 --> 03:41:32.000]  and after the depopulation to basically control
[03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:36.000]  planetary development all of their world government projects have been
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:39.440]  failing over and over and over again they can't
[03:41:39.440 --> 03:41:43.920]  democratically get it done england just left the euro or began the
[03:41:43.920 --> 03:41:46.960]  process because they never voted to enter it
[03:41:46.960 --> 03:41:51.600]  it's unelected the globalists that run it are tax exempt the eu
[03:41:51.600 --> 03:41:54.880]  parliament is ceremonial and the people of england across the political
[03:41:54.880 --> 03:41:59.120]  spectrum have learned about this they've learned that
[03:41:59.120 --> 03:42:02.880]  the globalists have fed on third world populations enslaved them
[03:42:02.880 --> 03:42:08.000]  absolutely poisoned them weaponized crops against them engage in genetic
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:11.200]  engineering engage in secret testing and
[03:42:11.200 --> 03:42:15.040]  much of it's been declassified and now these giant hordes
[03:42:15.040 --> 03:42:18.800]  of poor desperate people are being directed into the west
[03:42:18.800 --> 03:42:22.640]  not to be empowered but to bring the west down
[03:42:22.640 --> 03:42:27.600]  this is the sabotage of the carbon taxes this is the sabotage of the globalist
[03:42:27.600 --> 03:42:30.720]  program this is the essence of what the new world order
[03:42:30.720 --> 03:42:34.640]  is trying to do to society to make you so poor and pathetic they can dictate
[03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:38.640]  the terms of your total surrender remember obama a few years ago when he
[03:42:38.640 --> 03:42:42.160]  traveled to africa and he told aspiring africans
[03:42:42.160 --> 03:42:46.320]  who are looking up to him as success he said you can't have air conditioning or
[03:42:46.320 --> 03:42:50.080]  a car if everybody's raising living standards to
[03:42:50.080 --> 03:42:53.840]  the point where everybody's got a car and everybody's got air conditioning
[03:42:53.840 --> 03:42:59.280]  everybody's got a big house well the planet will boil over
[03:42:59.280 --> 03:43:02.080]  you should have said we're going to develop cleaner cars in air conditioning
[03:43:02.080 --> 03:43:05.680]  and out of these new innovations we'll have the next generation
[03:43:05.680 --> 03:43:10.000]  of success but that's what they teach americans it's what they teach
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:13.200]  nigerians it's what they teach japanese they're
[03:43:13.200 --> 03:43:16.000]  teaching everyone that you should just lay down and die
[03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:20.320]  you should hate yourself you should just turn
[03:43:20.320 --> 03:43:23.760]  your whole will over to them because you're an evil dirty human
[03:43:23.760 --> 03:43:28.000]  that's poisoning the earth and they know that once you industrialize a
[03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:31.600]  country people have less than two children in population declines
[03:43:31.600 --> 03:43:36.400]  that if you go back to the british commission in 1949
[03:43:36.400 --> 03:43:40.160]  they say if we industrialize the third world will empower them
[03:43:40.160 --> 03:43:43.600]  and they won't have too many kids but we won't control them because they'll have
[03:43:43.600 --> 03:43:47.200]  their own industrial base we move to let them overpopulate
[03:43:47.200 --> 03:43:50.800]  then use them as a political weapon exploit them and then use them to
[03:43:50.800 --> 03:43:53.600]  conquer the west once their population's balloon
[03:43:53.600 --> 03:44:00.960]  this is a cold blooded plan by the most wicked people the world could ever
[03:44:00.960 --> 03:44:05.120]  imagine this is the ultimate divide and conquer great game
[03:44:05.120 --> 03:44:09.200]  play one side off against each other's system and it's absolutely a threat to
[03:44:09.200 --> 03:44:14.320]  humanity food riots now have killed yet another venezuelan
[03:44:14.320 --> 03:44:18.480]  according to Reuters they're reporting that a man was shot dead on tuesday
[03:44:18.480 --> 03:44:21.840]  during looting and food riots that were proliferating
[03:44:21.840 --> 03:44:25.760]  round the crisis hit venezuela that's according to an opposition
[03:44:25.760 --> 03:44:30.160]  legislator who issued that report bringing it to at least a number of four
[03:44:30.160 --> 03:44:33.680]  four of four in the number of fatalities for this month's wave of
[03:44:33.680 --> 03:44:38.720]  unrest these were the chaotic scenes as residents of a city in southeast and
[03:44:38.720 --> 03:44:42.880]  venezuela went on the rampage in search of basic food items
[03:44:42.880 --> 03:44:47.360]  people desperate for staples like milk rice and flour stormed a supermarket
[03:44:47.360 --> 03:44:52.000]  warehouse in guayana city a 21 year old man was shot dead during the
[03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:55.920]  unrest as the government has reportedly neglected
[03:44:55.920 --> 03:44:59.440]  to pay the ebt benefits for eight days
[03:44:59.440 --> 03:45:02.400]  michael snider of the economic blog reports
[03:45:02.400 --> 03:45:06.880]  widespread reports continue to pour in from all over the nation of glitches
[03:45:06.880 --> 03:45:10.880]  with the food stamp system it is eight days into the month and large
[03:45:10.880 --> 03:45:14.240]  numbers of people still have not received their benefits
[03:45:14.240 --> 03:45:19.040]  and in other instances it is being reported that ebt cards are simply not
[03:45:19.040 --> 03:45:23.840]  working correctly michael snider continues on down detector.com there are
[03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:28.480]  scores of reports of problems with the ebt system from people all over the
[03:45:28.480 --> 03:45:31.360]  nation could this simply be another example of
[03:45:31.360 --> 03:45:36.480]  government incompetence or is something else at work here
[03:45:36.480 --> 03:45:40.080]  now the big question is what are we going to do about it
[03:45:40.080 --> 03:45:44.240]  the advice i give you is the same advice that i carry out in my own personal
[03:45:44.240 --> 03:45:48.000]  life number one everybody needs to be able to
[03:45:48.000 --> 03:45:51.120]  protect themselves everybody needs friends and family they can rely on
[03:45:51.120 --> 03:45:53.840]  in crises and everyone needs high quality
[03:45:53.840 --> 03:45:56.960]  storeable foods and high quality water filtration systems
[03:45:56.960 --> 03:45:59.760]  not just for collapse when it comes to water filters all the garbage in our
[03:45:59.760 --> 03:46:02.640]  water you'd be insane to drink well water or tap water with the
[03:46:02.640 --> 03:46:05.920]  glyphosates on the rest of it but we're offering
[03:46:05.920 --> 03:46:09.440]  the biggest wide spectrum sale ever on preparedness items

[03:46:42.320 --> 03:46:45.920]  helps us in these times to continue our operation
[03:46:45.920 --> 03:46:49.520]  and expand it in the face of the globalist because people are listening
[03:46:49.520 --> 03:46:52.880]  to what we're saying more than ever because we've been proven right because
[03:46:52.880 --> 03:46:56.240]  we've been reading their own documents their own memorandums
[03:46:56.240 --> 03:47:01.040]  the globalist are eugenicist technocrats they're orchestrating a world meltdown
[03:47:01.040 --> 03:47:05.200]  to reduce population and bring in crisis and bring in control
[03:47:05.200 --> 03:47:08.560]  while they pose as the saviors and establish a world government
[03:47:08.560 --> 03:47:12.240]  on the ashes of our society everything they're doing is about making us
[03:47:12.240 --> 03:47:16.240]  dependent that's why it's key to have a
[03:47:16.240 --> 03:47:19.760]  emergency plan for disasters that's why it's key to have storeable foods
[03:47:19.760 --> 03:47:23.760]  that's why it's key to have water filtration and in non-gmo seeds
[03:47:23.760 --> 03:47:28.560]  we have it all shortwave radios crank radios solar panel systems the very
[03:47:28.560 --> 03:47:32.800]  best preparedness items out there at the lowest prices i was just at a meeting
[03:47:32.800 --> 03:47:36.080]  today with welton and others saying i want you to continue to research the
[03:47:36.080 --> 03:47:39.280]  best products and i want you to continue to buy in bulk and give people the
[03:47:39.280 --> 03:47:42.960]  lowest prices and we sat there and compared our products even to amazon
[03:47:42.960 --> 03:47:47.520]  and in most cases we beat them that is unprecedented so that's my commitment to
[03:47:47.520 --> 03:47:51.040]  you and a win-win i'm selling products i personally use
[03:47:51.040 --> 03:47:55.920]  and that i know we need that make us independent that i think you really need
[03:47:55.920 --> 03:47:59.120]  and it also funds the tip of the spear and the fight against the globalist
[03:47:59.120 --> 03:48:02.880]  so take advantage of this july 4th holiday special that runs right through
[03:48:02.880 --> 03:48:07.760]  next monday of 20 to 40 off all preparedness items
[03:48:07.760 --> 03:48:12.320]  but the water filters and the food is paramount and look you don't just need
[03:48:12.320 --> 03:48:14.800]  food for yourself you need extra food to take care of
[03:48:14.800 --> 03:48:18.240]  friends and family and others that don't listen or didn't listen and here's the
[03:48:18.240 --> 03:48:21.280]  good news you can eat this insurance this isn't like
[03:48:21.280 --> 03:48:24.720]  car insurance or fire insurance on your house that you know thank god you never
[03:48:24.720 --> 03:48:27.920]  have a record your house ever burns down so you don't need it
[03:48:27.920 --> 03:48:31.600]  this is insurance that lasts 25 years that's super high quality
[03:48:31.600 --> 03:48:34.720]  i've got storeable foods i bought 10 years ago the last 20 something years i
[03:48:34.720 --> 03:48:39.040]  just gave it to a homeless group i've given storeable foods to friends and
[03:48:39.040 --> 03:48:41.760]  family that are down and out they're high quality they're delicious
[03:48:41.760 --> 03:48:46.000]  this is insurance that you 100 percent will be able
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:50.960]  to eat and what's crazy about this is finding a silver lining in that cloud
[03:48:50.960 --> 03:48:55.200]  is that if they're looking at scenarios of 395 percent
[03:48:55.200 --> 03:48:59.680]  increases in food prices on average worldwide
[03:48:59.680 --> 03:49:04.640]  i was saying 20 30 might go up next year if they're looking at something like
[03:49:04.640 --> 03:49:08.480]  that well imagine buying storeable food at the
[03:49:08.480 --> 03:49:11.760]  prices it is today that blocks out the inflation we're
[03:49:11.760 --> 03:49:14.160]  starting to see in food that's rearing its head
[03:49:14.160 --> 03:49:17.520]  and so you're able to save money if inflation kicks in
[03:49:17.520 --> 03:49:21.360]  down the road because you bought your high quality delicious storeable foods
[03:49:21.360 --> 03:49:25.200]  at infowarstore.com i'm giving you the advice that i've taken
[03:49:25.200 --> 03:49:29.280]  i've never bought this much horrible food i've never gone out and got this much
[03:49:29.280 --> 03:49:32.960]  water filtration systems or put in extra solar panels or generators here at the
[03:49:32.960 --> 03:49:35.680]  office but i don't want to be dependent on the
[03:49:35.680 --> 03:49:40.080]  system because everything they're doing points towards an engineered collapse
[03:49:40.080 --> 03:49:43.360]  hopefully enough people get prepared and are ready so that we the people
[03:49:43.360 --> 03:49:47.120]  that are the patriots are informed not just here in the u.s but worldwide
[03:49:47.120 --> 03:49:50.240]  can stand up and tell everybody see we told you so
[03:49:50.240 --> 03:49:53.760]  and hopefully help folks around us and organize some type
[03:49:53.760 --> 03:49:57.840]  of political economic resistance to this agenda 21
[03:49:57.840 --> 03:50:01.920]  agenda 2030 globalist program but regardless as a father
[03:50:01.920 --> 03:50:05.760]  of three children i'm doing everything i can to really get ready
[03:50:05.760 --> 03:50:10.080]  to protect my family into the future that's coming because as i said earlier
[03:50:10.080 --> 03:50:14.640]  this is gone from a possibility of collapse to a probability to more and
[03:50:14.640 --> 03:50:18.160]  more an inevitability there's always hope
[03:50:18.160 --> 03:50:21.200]  but as the battle and say trust in god but tie up your camel
[03:50:21.200 --> 03:50:25.600]  i know i personally am getting prepared the warning signs are insane
[03:50:25.600 --> 03:50:28.960]  i'm hoping for the best but i'm preparing for the worst
[03:50:28.960 --> 03:50:32.880]  take advantage 20 to 40 off until early next week with the

[03:53:20.560 --> 03:53:23.840]  emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun
[03:53:23.840 --> 03:53:28.160]  whether it's dangerous summer storms blackouts intensifying civil unrest

[03:54:07.760 --> 03:54:12.320]  you know we had a lot of special reports to play and intros and videos to play on
[03:54:12.320 --> 03:54:15.680]  this fourth hour we didn't get a chance to cover much news but we did talk about
[03:54:15.680 --> 03:54:19.200]  it and the big news of course is that iphone
[03:54:19.200 --> 03:54:22.240]  apple rather is developing a patent or has a patent
[03:54:22.240 --> 03:54:26.480]  that could prevent filming of so-called illegal situations like
[03:54:26.480 --> 03:54:30.960]  concerts and what they deem to be classified areas which
[03:54:30.960 --> 03:54:34.800]  is the beginning of something that is very very disturbing
[03:54:34.800 --> 03:54:39.040]  because you know you can take your iphone out i do all the time take a quick
[03:54:39.040 --> 03:54:41.760]  video of something how many youtube videos have you seen
[03:54:41.760 --> 03:54:45.520]  there's just an iphone video usually in the wrong aspect ratio right
[03:54:45.520 --> 03:54:50.480]  but that's something amazing it is something very very valuable for
[03:54:50.480 --> 03:54:54.240]  history or or just whatever finding out what happened
[03:54:54.240 --> 03:55:00.160]  and this sets a precedent that deemed illegal your phone just won't take
[03:55:00.160 --> 03:55:03.440]  video or photos so we've hit on that a few times but you
[03:55:03.440 --> 03:55:07.200]  can't hit on it enough because of how important it really is
[03:55:07.200 --> 03:55:10.560]  now there's so much debate for no reason
[03:55:10.560 --> 03:55:15.360]  about marijuana and whether it's oh could we have some health implications
[03:55:15.360 --> 03:55:18.240]  from it or is it a evil evil thing or whatever
[03:55:18.240 --> 03:55:21.920]  but i'm going to settle that debate by saying
[03:55:21.920 --> 03:55:25.040]  all of the evidence that we're talking about that i'm talking about in articles
[03:55:25.040 --> 03:55:27.920]  like this have nothing to do with getting high
[03:55:27.920 --> 03:55:31.280]  so this is an article uh cannabis compounds could treat
[03:55:31.280 --> 03:55:34.880]  Alzheimer's by removing plaque forming proteins from brain cells research
[03:55:34.880 --> 03:55:40.960]  suggests now here's the key this is uh cannabis compounds can fight toxic
[03:55:40.960 --> 03:55:43.760]  proteins which calls all Alzheimer's disease
[03:55:43.760 --> 03:55:48.560]  research has suggested now cannabis compounds what does that mean
[03:55:48.560 --> 03:55:52.080]  well if you break down what is actually in marijuana you find
[03:55:52.080 --> 03:55:56.080]  that something known as the cannabinoids or cannabinoids
[03:55:56.080 --> 03:56:01.040]  are really the crux of it the thc which is what makes you high has a lot of
[03:56:01.040 --> 03:56:05.040]  beneficial beneficial properties too but the actual
[03:56:05.040 --> 03:56:08.560]  cannabinoids or cannabinoids however you choose to pronounce it
[03:56:08.560 --> 03:56:12.640]  is a lot of the health benefit and those don't make you high
[03:56:12.640 --> 03:56:16.640]  you could put that in a protein shake and it's not going to make you high
[03:56:16.640 --> 03:56:19.200]  it doesn't do anything you could take that as a supplement it doesn't make you
[03:56:19.200 --> 03:56:21.840]  high and the quote from the researcher is
[03:56:21.840 --> 03:56:25.280]  although other studies have offered evidence that cannabinoids
[03:56:25.280 --> 03:56:29.040]  might be neuro protective against the symptoms of Alzheimer's
[03:56:29.040 --> 03:56:33.040]  we believe our study is the first to demonstrate that cannabinoids affect
[03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:37.600]  both inflammation and amyloid beta accumulation in nerve cells
[03:56:37.600 --> 03:56:43.360]  so it's not the high factor that is doing this you could
[03:56:43.360 --> 03:56:48.240]  take these beneficial compounds from the marijuana itself from the cannabis
[03:56:48.240 --> 03:56:51.280]  right and put it into something just like regular hemp
[03:56:51.280 --> 03:56:55.760]  hemp does not make you high if you're taking the non-thc form of hemp so if
[03:56:55.760 --> 03:56:59.040]  you're making a protein shake with hemp you're getting a lot of the benefits
[03:56:59.040 --> 03:57:03.200]  still can't make it in the United States so there's no debate
[03:57:03.200 --> 03:57:08.320]  there's no debate why should you not be able to get hemp it does not contain
[03:57:08.320 --> 03:57:12.160]  THC it doesn't make you high doesn't make you paranoid or
[03:57:12.160 --> 03:57:16.320]  whatever they're going to say right it's not even making you high and it's just
[03:57:16.320 --> 03:57:20.160]  loaded with health benefits so in my view the debate is completely over
[03:57:20.160 --> 03:57:24.400]  what a joke on that and you don't have to even smoke marijuana to get the
[03:57:24.400 --> 03:57:28.000]  benefits from that right so i'm not even advocating that
[03:57:28.000 --> 03:57:32.960]  but back to this so you know we see the majority of Americans opposed political
[03:57:32.960 --> 03:57:36.560]  correctness i wanted to break down earlier what i was saying when i said
[03:57:36.560 --> 03:57:40.240]  this uh that if they asked the question differently would be huge
[03:57:40.240 --> 03:57:43.120]  difference as well so paul watson wrote this article he's always on top of
[03:57:43.120 --> 03:57:46.240]  stuff just such a genius guy a majority of Americans opposed the
[03:57:46.240 --> 03:57:49.840]  politically correct environment that many claim has chilled free speech
[03:57:49.840 --> 03:57:53.280]  according to a new poll now they asked people
[03:57:53.280 --> 03:57:56.240]  which is closer to your point of view there's too much political correctness
[03:57:56.240 --> 03:57:59.600]  today or there's too much prejudice i mean there's
[03:57:59.600 --> 03:58:03.840]  still a lot of prejudice that's kind of a loaded question i still think political
[03:58:03.840 --> 03:58:06.880]  correctness is bad but there is prejudice right so i can see why some
[03:58:06.880 --> 03:58:11.280]  people would say there's more prejudice but guess what 51 percent still said
[03:58:11.280 --> 03:58:15.040]  political correctness is even more prevalent than prejudice
[03:58:15.040 --> 03:58:18.400]  people are tired of it told you for a long time people are going to backlash
[03:58:18.400 --> 03:58:22.400]  against this big time it's over this establishment system political
[03:58:22.400 --> 03:58:26.800]  correctness is failing it's losing the facade is falling down
[03:58:26.800 --> 03:58:29.840]  hey thanks so much for joining the fourth hour of the alex joneshaw manthony
