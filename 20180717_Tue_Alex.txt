[00:00.000 --> 00:18.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.280 --> 00:26.160]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones well there's
[00:26.160 --> 00:32.520]  no longer any doubt it is completely official multiple members of Congress
[00:32.520 --> 00:37.360]  former head of the CIA former deputy director of the FBI they're all on the
[00:37.360 --> 00:42.560]  news and Fox News is agreeing saying remove President Trump from office he
[00:42.560 --> 00:47.600]  is a Russian agent they're saying remove President Trump from office with no
[00:47.600 --> 00:52.040]  evidence total fraud they are calling for the military to have a coup against
[00:52.040 --> 00:56.240]  the president and then Brian Stelter strangely enough comes out and does a
[00:56.240 --> 01:00.640]  five-minute piece calling for me to be removed from the air because I say
[01:00.640 --> 01:04.880]  they're making a move on the president meanwhile I said hey watch the House
[01:04.880 --> 01:08.440]  Judiciary Committee hearings on censoring conservatives where they're
[01:08.440 --> 01:13.040]  calling for it we turn on the YouTube live feed of it five minutes ago and
[01:13.040 --> 01:17.960]  they're talking about me saying I said nobody died at Parkland and I bullied
[01:17.960 --> 01:23.240]  these students total lie but they don't care because they're lying scum they're
[01:23.240 --> 01:27.840]  absolute criminals making their move on this country now what do they do when
[01:27.840 --> 01:31.760]  they get ready to launch a coup against the president with the media backing
[01:31.760 --> 01:35.600]  whatever small paramilitary force they get to do it they'll still say that
[01:35.600 --> 01:38.880]  represents our military and they hope to bluff the military into going along
[01:38.880 --> 01:42.200]  with it we are literally in the middle of history right now they're making their
[01:42.200 --> 01:48.360]  move they need a crackdown on the internet and I've said they're gonna
[01:48.360 --> 01:51.440]  build up towards the end of the summer into the fall with fake indictments all
[01:51.440 --> 01:55.280]  of this beating the drum the summer of raids they're activating all their
[01:55.280 --> 01:59.120]  antifa their communists you name it and then they are going to try to set the
[01:59.120 --> 02:03.760]  precedent to have the 25th Amendment take place to remove the president ahead
[02:03.760 --> 02:08.640]  of a military coup or have them claim 25th Amendment during a coup and then
[02:08.640 --> 02:13.200]  have members of the cabinet at least play ball with the Democrats and claim
[02:13.200 --> 02:16.800]  that they're going along with it but then those individuals will also be set up
[02:16.800 --> 02:20.480]  and removed as well because the Democrats a year and a half ago in
[02:20.480 --> 02:24.720]  Atlantic Monthly put out a plan to the establishment of how they would do this
[02:24.720 --> 02:28.880]  first remove Trump get Republicans to go along with it out of fear then they'll
[02:28.880 --> 02:34.320]  overturn the entire 2016 election have Homeland Security under Democrat
[02:34.320 --> 02:38.080]  control come in and take control of future elections will be like Venezuela
[02:38.080 --> 02:44.960]  and never have a new real election again tomorrow's news today next year's news
[02:44.960 --> 02:50.280]  today they are in over a thousand publications a day saying ban info wars
[02:50.280 --> 02:54.600]  they're having judiciary hearing committees lying about us right now to
[02:54.600 --> 02:59.160]  set the precedent to ban info wars off the internet as we know it fact that
[02:59.160 --> 03:02.040]  we're grabbing the clip right now just happened like seven eight minutes ago
[03:02.040 --> 03:07.320]  this is a concerted effort this would not be done unless they were making their
[03:07.320 --> 03:16.320]  move so this is it ladies and gentlemen toe-to-toe with the globalist it's
[03:16.320 --> 03:21.480]  incredible it's absolutely incredible that on the Russia issue Trump has been
[03:21.480 --> 03:24.760]  manipulated into sending tow missiles into Ukraine to attack the Russians
[03:24.760 --> 03:29.800]  massive sanctions on them massive energy deals crushing Russian companies
[03:29.800 --> 03:34.200]  which is fine with me that's free market I mean Trump has been kicking the
[03:34.200 --> 03:39.400]  Russians upside the head and then they sit there in the media and act like he's
[03:39.400 --> 03:43.200]  Putin's puppet and Arnold Schwarzenegger the admitted Nazi
[03:43.200 --> 03:49.200]  Roy head drug addict you know total joke fraud comes out and says he was a he
[03:49.200 --> 03:54.360]  was a wimp that Trump was a wet noodle no you are a wet noodle you're the one

[03:57.960 --> 04:03.480]  massive you know steroid use you're the joke Trump is 72 years old and a bull

[06:24.840 --> 06:28.640]  back even in just a short time after this and say what next you've seen
[06:28.640 --> 06:33.080]  senators come out in the past we've seen a senator who's in the midst of a
[06:33.080 --> 06:35.920]  painful illness center mccain you've seen centers like Jeff flake who are
[06:35.920 --> 06:38.960]  leaving the Senate now you see Marco Rubio still obviously in the fight
[06:38.960 --> 06:43.760]  speaking out my question would be when the members of the the president's
[06:43.760 --> 06:48.520]  inner circle start to say look we have an overseas dilemma where you are
[06:48.520 --> 06:53.600]  portraying us in terms of the American government as worse than a tyrant that
[06:53.600 --> 06:57.480]  is Vladimir Putin. Secretary of Homeland Security came out with statements this
[06:57.480 --> 07:01.000]  week about continued Russian interference this was not on Obama's watch
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.600]  that's this week FBI director continues the investigation Department of Justice
[07:05.600 --> 07:09.240]  continues support for the investigation Congress continues saying that this
[07:09.240 --> 07:12.800]  investigation is legitimate curious point in American government when do we
[07:12.800 --> 07:16.680]  see almost a shadow government come out and say we cannot side with the
[07:16.680 --> 07:19.080]  government whether it's the cabinet or the Senate I think that's the big
[07:19.080 --> 07:23.240]  question let me give you one bottom line as a former government official
[07:23.240 --> 07:30.320]  government's gonna kill this guy. Phil Mudd former CIA director Brennan all the
[07:30.320 --> 07:35.000]  usual suspects congressman Cohen are out saying the military should be used
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.040]  against the president for meeting with Putin a lot of weak-minded conservatives
[07:40.040 --> 07:45.720]  have jumped on the bandwagon Fox News has had its contributors come out all
[07:45.720 --> 07:48.680]  these folks that act like their supporters of make America great again
[07:48.680 --> 07:51.760]  supporters of the president all completely turned on him and said there's a
[07:51.760 --> 07:59.600]  consensus in America that trumped through America under the bush by being
[07:59.600 --> 08:05.360]  cordial with Vladimir Putin the second biggest nuclear arms country in the
[08:05.360 --> 08:09.520]  world and the country that Trump has sent tow missiles to fight in Ukraine
[08:09.520 --> 08:14.160]  Trump's put crippling sanctions on him he's done energy deals further
[08:14.160 --> 08:21.320]  decimating Russian energy sales and putting Russia into a serious recession
[08:21.320 --> 08:27.040]  America first China is who is selling our country out China is who owns our debt
[08:27.040 --> 08:31.200]  who owns Hollywood China is the group that is absolutely working on the
[08:31.200 --> 08:35.360]  Democratic Party and financing them publicly and involved in massive
[08:35.360 --> 08:39.800]  censorship of US media even the New York Times admits that and buying up our
[08:39.800 --> 08:42.880]  universities but here are the traders here are the globalists here's the big
[08:42.880 --> 08:46.680]  takeaway that don't want America to be great again that want China and all these
[08:46.680 --> 08:51.400]  countries have huge tariffs on us but we have no tariffs on them you know the
[08:51.400 --> 08:54.680]  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals saying you can't wear American flags in school
[08:54.680 --> 09:00.960]  if they're a gang symbol flyover country bigger bitter clingers they're the ones
[09:00.960 --> 09:05.000]  that don't want to fix the VA they're the ones that want open borders they're
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.920]  the anti-American globalist they're the people that openly hate sovereignty
[09:08.920 --> 09:11.960]  they're the people that don't want America to be successful again they're
[09:11.960 --> 09:16.120]  the ones that don't want free market for the general public they're the crony
[09:16.120 --> 09:19.880]  capitalists that create these horrible blue state blue city areas everybody's
[09:19.880 --> 09:24.640]  fleeing like Chicago and San Francisco we have video of their mayor touring it
[09:24.640 --> 09:29.160]  saying I've never seen so much feces anywhere all the conferences are getting
[09:29.160 --> 09:33.320]  canceled the tourism is getting canceled same thing in Paris but they don't care
[09:33.320 --> 09:38.920]  because they're bringing in client populations that are fully dependent on
[09:38.920 --> 09:44.720]  government like Chicago's moving forward with a universal wage where you were
[09:44.720 --> 09:51.440]  everyone's just paid money without working they're just paid a guaranteed
[09:51.440 --> 09:59.160]  wage Chicago to test universal basic income program so this is the plan just
[09:59.160 --> 10:02.600]  draw as many people as you can from all the world get them under your political
[10:02.600 --> 10:06.800]  control with no jobs totally dependent on you now you've got an army you've got
[10:06.800 --> 10:14.560]  a group to control things same thing was done by that yogi con man
[10:14.560 --> 10:20.760]  bogline you know out in Oregon in the wild wild country and they brought in ten
[10:20.760 --> 10:26.160]  thousand homeless people to then vote the county out and take over it's just a
[10:26.160 --> 10:30.840]  basic Democrat party operation and they're the traders they're the enemy
[10:30.840 --> 10:35.240]  Trump gets in immediately thousands of new factories come back immediately the
[10:35.240 --> 10:40.880]  stock market gains two trillion three trillion immediately we see wages
[10:40.880 --> 10:46.280]  explode immediately we see all these good things happening because the
[10:46.280 --> 10:49.800]  globalists have been siphoning off the country the CFR is an anti-american
[10:49.800 --> 10:53.960]  institution that talks about the Chinese century and how America is over
[10:53.960 --> 10:57.720]  everybody knows the Democrats hate America everybody knows the blue blood
[10:57.720 --> 11:02.360]  Republicans are these new older people and then they've got the nerve to all
[11:02.360 --> 11:05.640]  get up there Fox News a year and a half ago was anti-trump member but it killed
[11:05.640 --> 11:08.720]  their ratings in half so then they came back and were pro-trump a little bit of
[11:08.720 --> 11:12.800]  the time and then now they made their move and so they've got all these hosts
[11:12.800 --> 11:18.600]  and all these people saying Trump did it it's a consensus it's over oh my gosh
[11:18.600 --> 11:22.360]  those are all the same cowards that said he never win all the same cowards that
[11:22.360 --> 11:25.920]  never backed him all the same cowards that would never talk about all the real
[11:25.920 --> 11:29.600]  things that are happening and unfolding with the real Russia gate and Hillary and
[11:29.600 --> 11:36.000]  Mueller on tarmacs in Moscow with you weapons grade uranium samples so that
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.120]  Russia could then buy off 20 plus percent of our uranium stockpile and
[11:40.120 --> 11:45.080]  uranium one true espionage Russia is involved in espionage against this
[11:45.080 --> 11:51.360]  country it's probably it's not even one-tenth the Chinese level I mean it's
[11:51.360 --> 11:56.520]  just the Chinese are dominating this country because they have elites here
[11:56.520 --> 11:59.960]  that worked with them day one to set it up and do it so if Russia was a threat
[11:59.960 --> 12:04.240]  other than nuclear weapons I'd be talking about it Russia has more resources
[12:04.240 --> 12:11.520]  than even Africa and it's not a continent it's a country and we need to go in
[12:11.520 --> 12:17.400]  there Russia is wanting to merge with the West Russia is wanting to be free
[12:17.400 --> 12:22.320]  market Russia is wanting to be Americana with its own flair it's that's why the
[12:22.320 --> 12:27.760]  globalist are panicking because it's the perfect alliance against the Chai comms
[12:27.760 --> 12:31.080]  and the EU and the globalist we get Russia on our side just because they're
[12:31.080 --> 12:35.320]  geographic control of Eastern Europe right through the stands into Central Asia
[12:35.320 --> 12:40.800]  into Asia all the way into Far East Asia we have global domination of the chess
[12:40.800 --> 12:47.400]  board as it's called by Brzezinski but Russia sovereign just like America is
[12:47.400 --> 12:51.960]  becoming sovereign and they can't have that happen when we come back from
[12:51.960 --> 13:01.600]  break we have Congress members just 30 minutes ago saying we want Alex Jones
[13:01.600 --> 13:04.640]  taking off social media for questioning MSM narrative since they actually say
[13:04.640 --> 13:08.040]  and then they lie about what I say even if I have the right to say nobody died
[13:08.040 --> 13:11.840]  at Parkland but I didn't and I have a right to say their crisis actors I
[13:11.840 --> 13:15.840]  didn't I said they picked four kids out of 3,000 to be the spokespersons who
[13:15.840 --> 13:18.680]  happen to be in the drama club so they can read off a script and then we have
[13:18.680 --> 13:24.520]  them reading off scripts on video at the drama club saying that and hog saying
[13:24.520 --> 13:27.480]  he wasn't at school when it happened and then saying he was that's video of hog
[13:27.480 --> 13:32.760]  I don't think it didn't happen I think there's some scripting going on here on
[13:32.760 --> 13:38.960]  how they respond but this is incredible ladies and gentlemen and it ties in
[13:38.960 --> 13:44.600]  Facebook kills pro-trump account hours after calling for info wars to be
[13:44.600 --> 13:48.360]  censored it's all coming up ladies and gentlemen it's an amazing time to be
[13:48.360 --> 13:54.320]  alive now that said why are they making such a dangerous move to call for us to
[13:54.320 --> 13:59.240]  be banned on major internet platforms when it's so unamerican so authoritarian
[13:59.240 --> 14:03.200]  because they're getting ready to make their move on Trump and on the entire
[14:03.200 --> 14:06.200]  electoral process and on the 2016 election they say they're gonna
[14:06.200 --> 14:09.920]  overthrow that whole election have new elections run by the Democrats and the
[14:09.920 --> 14:15.080]  new Homeland Security Group they'll have some ceremonial Republicans in there
[14:15.080 --> 14:17.640]  but they know there's a political realignment against the Democrats they
[14:17.640 --> 14:21.240]  know their party's dead so they're making their move to end elections that's
[14:21.240 --> 14:26.120]  what authoritarians do they'll still have stage ones this is America fighting for
[14:26.120 --> 14:30.760]  its life now people better understand they want us shut down because we study

[20:44.280 --> 20:51.480]  war USA Today says we're in a civil war but Brian Stelter says I should be taken
[20:51.480 --> 20:54.440]  off the air because I said the Democrats are launching a civil war this
[20:54.440 --> 20:58.520]  summer I also said they're trying to take the president out I have all these
[20:58.520 --> 21:02.800]  video clips and mainstream news articles with former head of the CIA former
[21:02.800 --> 21:07.480]  deputy director of the FBI congressman Cohen saying we need a military coup
[21:07.480 --> 21:13.240]  against the president so because I'm up here saying that's wrong they go oh you're
[21:13.240 --> 21:18.880]  crazy it doesn't exist just during the break we're grabbing all of this I was
[21:18.880 --> 21:22.640]  watching the House Judiciary Committee Jim Jordan's talking right now but they
[21:22.640 --> 21:27.600]  had the Democrat before him say well diamonds and silk and Alex diamond and
[21:27.600 --> 21:32.080]  silk and Alex Jones are fake news and Facebook Twitter and Google your private
[21:32.080 --> 21:37.000]  companies so just take them off oh kind of like Google said all Republican
[21:37.000 --> 21:43.120]  candidates are Nazis because you see they don't just take you off these things
[21:43.120 --> 21:48.400]  they say are public Commons and public utilities that are monopolistic 90 plus
[21:48.400 --> 21:53.120]  percent of web searches or Google they then lie about you once they silence you
[21:53.120 --> 21:58.240]  you notice the Judiciary Committee didn't ask me to come testify even though
[21:58.240 --> 22:03.440]  every time I go to break and I go watch it for a minute or two they're talking
[22:03.440 --> 22:09.640]  about me or diamond and silk why are they so scared of them you could never
[22:09.640 --> 22:13.440]  even claim any form of fake news with them I mean any big news operation makes
[22:13.440 --> 22:17.640]  mistakes sometimes they go oh you're fake news but diamond and silk are just
[22:17.640 --> 22:20.920]  charming smart black ladies and the Democratic Party thinks they own black
[22:20.920 --> 22:24.480]  people and so they've been demonetized they've been blocked on Facebook and
[22:24.480 --> 22:27.880]  there are the Democrats going oh you're a private company just deep six of them
[22:27.880 --> 22:37.000]  they said bury Alex Jones and diamond and silk bury us there you go bury us
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.600]  well that's what you do once you take somebody's speech you then to tend to
[22:39.600 --> 22:43.520]  actually financially and then physically bury them and how are they doing it
[22:43.520 --> 22:49.040]  they're saying I said Parkland didn't happen total lie there is no clip but
[22:49.040 --> 22:52.840]  they don't care this is how the lynching happens and they're making their move
[22:52.840 --> 22:57.120]  that's why we had the emergency report the censorship master plan decoded by
[22:57.120 --> 23:00.640]  Mike Adams working with myself and Paul Watson I'm gonna retweet it right now
[23:00.640 --> 23:05.360]  guys at real Alex Jones please retweet Paul's article that has a minute I need
[23:05.360 --> 23:10.440]  everybody to send this to Jim Jordan I need this to be in his in his in his
[23:10.440 --> 23:13.920]  email a thousand times I know it's been given to the president I know it's been
[23:13.920 --> 23:18.120]  given to the campaign head I know it's been given but this is the blueprint and
[23:18.120 --> 23:22.440]  they admit in their own statements in this report that once they get me shut
[23:22.440 --> 23:26.360]  down and I guess diamond and silk's been chosen the main targets the president
[23:26.360 --> 23:31.720]  you can read the quotes where they say they want him silenced they want him
[23:31.720 --> 23:36.000]  silenced so here's just one of the clips we don't have a big crew but I've got
[23:36.000 --> 23:42.920]  one person Matt just in there watching it right now it is unbelievable this is
[23:42.920 --> 23:46.520]  America right now because they're launching their call for the coup their
[23:46.520 --> 23:50.840]  call for civil insurrection their call for hashtag hunt Republicans their call
[23:50.840 --> 23:56.840]  for the border to be collapsed this is them making their move emergency report
[23:56.840 --> 24:01.080]  the censorship master plan decoded get it from him for wars get it out to
[24:01.080 --> 24:05.800]  everybody this is a fight now they've got more articles doing well we are
[24:05.800 --> 24:10.480]  Pavlovian Lee using conditioning to block conservatives that promote Trump or
[24:10.480 --> 24:13.840]  Alex Jones and we don't need to totally ban them because we're using it for
[24:13.840 --> 24:19.200]  social engineering exactly but we're not animals we can go through pain to make
[24:19.200 --> 24:24.040]  our objective we understand they're trying to condition us and block us and
[24:24.040 --> 24:29.520]  demonize us so that we don't win a war Hitler said bad things about our troops
[24:29.520 --> 24:32.720]  when they were invading the Japanese said bad things about our troops we were
[24:32.720 --> 24:36.000]  fighting them you think we listen to their propaganda in World War two
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.080]  unbelievable but there are a lot of Americans don't realize America was
[24:40.080 --> 24:44.280]  close to being shut down under Hillary we're just coming back from the dead
[24:44.280 --> 24:47.560]  right now but we haven't won the fight and they want this country under global
[24:47.560 --> 24:51.440]  government and Trump's saying no I'm gonna be a US president I'm a stand-up for
[24:51.440 --> 24:55.720]  our country and what's good and you've seen the results night and day and they
[24:55.720 --> 25:02.240]  are angry they want to stop it they are the enemies but all these cowards get
[25:02.240 --> 25:07.680]  on the fence Jim Jordan's not a coward so they look back 25 years ago no police
[25:07.680 --> 25:14.040]  reports no allegations no nothing that he didn't abuse any young people but that
[25:14.040 --> 25:19.640]  somebody might have abused somebody well that's the Justice Department still
[25:19.640 --> 25:23.320]  run by the Clintons Trump never got control of it just putting that crap
[25:23.320 --> 25:28.080]  out because he has the courage to get ready to impeach Rosenstein so I stand
[25:28.080 --> 25:32.640]  with Trump and and and Jordan and everybody else but the hearings are
[25:32.640 --> 25:37.520]  going on right now they're happening right now can we punch up to show TV
[25:37.520 --> 25:41.520]  viewers the Judiciary Committee hearings here it is they want Alex Jones
[25:41.520 --> 25:46.640]  taking off social media for questioning MSM narratives that's it they don't want
[25:46.640 --> 25:51.720]  us questioning narratives then they misrepresent that's mr. Dutch here it
[25:51.720 --> 25:58.360]  is I represent Parkland Florida and in this discussion of social media the
[25:58.360 --> 26:01.920]  first thing that comes to mind for me is that the savage attacks on the student
[26:01.920 --> 26:05.520]  survivors of Stoneman Douglas one of the most very long strains of these attacks
[26:05.520 --> 26:08.360]  was that the students didn't survive a school shooting that they were crisis
[26:08.360 --> 26:16.600]  actors hit boss how do you pronounce his name Deutsch that Dutch D.E.U.T.C.H yeah
[26:16.600 --> 26:22.200]  Dutch I think I'm gonna go to his office nicely friendly though and I need
[26:22.200 --> 26:26.680]  constituents of his to go to his office and I need to go to his home office and
[26:26.680 --> 26:30.880]  go to the office in DC and just come to his door and say hey man show me a
[26:30.880 --> 26:35.280]  video of me saying nobody died show me a video of saying that they're crisis
[26:35.280 --> 26:42.720]  actors that's a lie of Brian Stelter and CNN and they know it that's what they
[26:42.720 --> 26:48.360]  do so he can be the victim and say I'm beating up these kids the four chosen
[26:48.360 --> 26:52.240]  out of thousands to go out and be anti-gun because they're anti-gun their
[26:52.240 --> 26:54.960]  parents are anti-gun they're spokespersons they're flown around on
[26:54.960 --> 26:58.800]  Democrat Party airplanes they have speeches they say gun owners are bad
[26:58.800 --> 27:04.440]  people hog calls me names and calls me a con man all I say is come on and debate
[27:04.440 --> 27:09.520]  me hog he won't do it but here he is misrepresenting that I'm hurting

[27:12.840 --> 27:16.920]  birthright here he is by some mysterious cabal to finally get Congress to do
[27:16.920 --> 27:21.160]  something about gun violence and in the weeks after the shooting Alex Jones's
[27:21.160 --> 27:26.480]  YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers so
[27:26.480 --> 27:32.160]  alleging that these were merely that these were actors and not real students
[27:32.160 --> 27:36.360]  who had experienced the most horrific thing anyone could possibly imagine the
[27:36.360 --> 27:40.240]  video violated YouTube's rules against bullying and it was removed an article
[27:40.240 --> 27:44.000]  posted to Slate.com describes this as a strike against the channel Ms. Downs
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.840]  how many strikes does a channel get three typically a channel gets three
[27:50.840 --> 27:56.480]  strikes and doesn't matter they removed them and it was in Bloomberg that that I
[27:56.480 --> 28:00.280]  didn't say that and that it was a fraud and that Southern Parvy Law Center crew

[28:05.120 --> 28:10.400]  servers they got 14 million views buddy and everybody saw what I really said the
[28:10.400 --> 28:14.480]  video was about the police stand down and that's why you wanted it down and
[28:14.480 --> 28:20.720]  we've broke it first with eyewitnesses and a week later it was confirmed let's

[32:04.440 --> 32:08.360]  drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big
[32:08.360 --> 32:13.040]  island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[32:13.040 --> 32:18.520]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[32:18.520 --> 32:23.520]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[32:23.520 --> 32:29.120]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[32:29.120 --> 32:34.280]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[32:34.280 --> 32:38.600]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[32:38.600 --> 32:43.880]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
[32:43.880 --> 32:49.840]  it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
[32:49.840 --> 32:54.080]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[32:54.080 --> 33:01.080]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[33:01.080 --> 33:08.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:14.560 --> 33:18.840]  summer of rage is here they're making their move on our counter strike to
[33:18.840 --> 33:24.840]  restore the republic aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to
[33:24.840 --> 33:33.640]  choose a side you're listening to alex jones the globalist and their allied
[33:33.640 --> 33:37.840]  traders their collaborators think you're stupid they think I'm dumb they think
[33:37.840 --> 33:42.160]  we're weak I think they've got us coming up I've got a bunch of clips of
[33:42.160 --> 33:46.800]  Putin being interviewed by Wallace on Fox I've got clips of Putin pointing out
[33:46.800 --> 33:51.760]  the 400 million laundered out of Russia to manipulate the election what really
[33:51.760 --> 33:56.080]  happened and how they've had giant anti-russian forces in Russia that Soros
[33:56.080 --> 33:59.720]  and Obama were funding and Hillary was funding now they use those forces
[33:59.720 --> 34:04.240]  including Ukrainian forces they had in the election which is all admitted now
[34:04.240 --> 34:09.440]  the real meddling is by the Democrats and I thought that and then media matters
[34:09.440 --> 34:13.600]  run by George Soros the Nazi collaborator has headlines like jones
[34:13.600 --> 34:20.120]  backs Putin puts out Russian propaganda it's admitted that 80% of the bots out
[34:20.120 --> 34:23.200]  of Russia were Hillary funded it's admitted 80% of the money in the
[34:23.200 --> 34:28.400]  campaign was Hillary that's all admitted just like they spied on Trump during the
[34:28.400 --> 34:34.480]  campaign they denied it they admitted it before now I don't want to make this
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.120]  broadcast about me here's the headline they're having house judiciary
[34:38.120 --> 34:42.240]  committee hearings that aren't even on c-span they're online that we're trying
[34:42.240 --> 34:47.120]  to watch in live time and all they're talking about is me and diamond and silk
[34:47.120 --> 34:50.240]  trying to ban those poor black ladies from being on the internet and they're
[34:50.240 --> 34:57.160]  defaming them but they've got immunity in Congress you've got this congressman
[34:57.160 --> 35:01.560]  Dutch from the Parkland area reading a southern poverty law center script I mean
[35:01.560 --> 35:04.200]  I know what he's gonna say next that is southern poverty loss will play at the
[35:04.200 --> 35:11.600]  minute we just joined us saying Joan says nobody died at Parkland and bullied
[35:11.600 --> 35:16.240]  the students and said that they were crisis actors no and he says YouTube
[35:16.240 --> 35:23.080]  took down the video and bit of strike no they took down our video on the police
[35:23.080 --> 35:31.480]  stand down that was later confirmed with eyewitness students on the show and we
[35:31.480 --> 35:35.960]  posted ourselves and got 14 million views put Bloomberg up please we're gonna
[35:35.960 --> 35:38.520]  send this to the Google and the congressman all of them
[35:38.520 --> 35:43.160]  YouTube's new moderators mistakenly pull right-wing channels and they go on to
[35:43.160 --> 35:47.080]  admit that they took our videos down had to put them back up and then indeed we
[35:47.080 --> 35:50.440]  didn't even do what they said but why would you take our video down if we
[35:50.440 --> 35:55.160]  didn't believe their official story there I'm now told I haven't seen it yet
[35:55.160 --> 35:58.880]  they're talking about moon hoaxes saying I said we didn't go to the moon I say we
[35:58.880 --> 36:03.840]  went to the moon but Fox News has had specials about nobody going to the moon
[36:03.840 --> 36:09.120]  does that mean Fox News is banned CNN's been caught line about WMD's and
[36:09.120 --> 36:12.360]  staging debates and giving the questions to Hillary should they ever get it
[36:12.360 --> 36:16.000]  a debate again they shouldn't be able to hold the debate again they're totally
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.080]  discredited but they shouldn't be taken off the air they should just be to
[36:19.080 --> 36:23.760]  discredited and go bankrupt because people know they're a lie so you think
[36:23.760 --> 36:26.280]  about the magnitude this is just one clip I'm gonna give it I'm told there's a
[36:26.280 --> 36:31.560]  bunch of others I can't watch it in lifetime I'm going he hurt the children
[36:31.560 --> 36:36.600]  he did bully them he need to be off David hogs a politician flying around the
[36:36.600 --> 36:41.760]  day after on Democratic Party George Soros funded planes as an anti-gun
[36:41.760 --> 36:46.200]  spokesperson then they called me to be taken down for pointing that out that
[36:46.200 --> 36:52.560]  doesn't mean David hog said he wasn't at the school and then he said he was I'm
[36:52.560 --> 36:55.600]  not saying it didn't happen I'm saying the guy's saying a bunch of different
[36:55.600 --> 37:03.640]  stuff so which David hog do I believe and again people don't believe mainstream
[37:03.640 --> 37:06.960]  media anymore that's why you guys just can't get rid of me and have all this
[37:06.960 --> 37:10.480]  get better and they know that they're setting the precedent with Diamond and
[37:10.480 --> 37:15.400]  Silk Alex Jones and WikiLeaks and oh I was watching video or how they're lying
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.160]  about those sweet ladies calling them fake news they're fake because their
[37:19.160 --> 37:22.320]  average video got a couple million views they're fake because they can in their
[37:22.320 --> 37:26.960]  house have more viewers and CNN anytime they want and you guys don't like it
[37:26.960 --> 37:30.360]  because you're a bunch of liars and you don't want me to be able to counter you
[37:30.360 --> 37:42.600]  Mr. Dutch Wow so they're there calling for them to be taken off air as well so
[37:42.600 --> 37:47.720]  let's start over with his lies here it is I represent Parkland Florida and in
[37:47.720 --> 37:51.720]  this discussion of social media the first thing that comes to mind for me is
[37:51.720 --> 37:56.240]  that the savage attacks on the student survivors of Stoneman Douglas one of the
[37:56.240 --> 37:59.000]  most virulent strains of these attacks was that the students didn't survive a
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.840]  school shooting that they were crisis actors that they were planted by some
[38:02.840 --> 38:06.880]  mysterious cabal to finally get Congress to do something about gun violence and
[38:06.880 --> 38:10.680]  in the weeks after the shooting Alex Jones's YouTube channel posted a video
[38:10.680 --> 38:16.600]  that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers alleging that these were merely
[38:16.600 --> 38:21.080]  it was again they don't let us go to our subscribers that's the shadow ban there
[38:21.080 --> 38:25.600]  so that's everything he says is wrong because he's a liar and he's ignorant
[38:25.600 --> 38:29.920]  this is the frauds that run our country and they're trying to say that Trump's
[38:29.920 --> 38:35.040]  an enemy when they're the people holding the country back just all lies
[38:35.040 --> 38:40.880]  continue actors and not real students who had experienced the most horrific thing
[38:40.880 --> 38:44.320]  anyone didn't say that I imagine the video violated YouTube's rules against
[38:44.320 --> 38:48.280]  bullying and it was removed an article posted to Slate.com describes this as a
[38:48.280 --> 38:52.440]  strike against the channel Ms. Downs how many strikes does a channel get
[38:52.440 --> 38:58.920]  but it goes again it gets three but that isn't the issue they were all removed
[38:58.920 --> 39:03.200]  and they had so many people there that they had like six or seven at once people
[39:03.200 --> 39:07.320]  go well you're supposed to be removed at that point it was all fake they had
[39:07.320 --> 39:11.640]  CNN on TV saying we've gone and filed complaints we want Alex off the air I
[39:11.640 --> 39:16.000]  just showed that think about the organized crime nature of another media
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.960]  outlet who's the kings of fake news trying to smother the truth then lying
[39:19.960 --> 39:26.080]  Democrats up there talking to Google the head of YouTube knows full well there
[39:26.080 --> 39:29.960]  was a mutiny full well they lied about us full well they had to put it up but
[39:29.960 --> 39:36.240]  look what she says continue typically a channel gets three strikes and then we
[39:36.240 --> 39:40.480]  terminate the channel so the reason I ask is Alex Jones obviously is a one
[39:40.480 --> 39:45.880]  of conspiracy theorists theorists whose brand is bullying he wants to win a tax
[39:45.880 --> 39:50.720]  I'm a conspiracy theorist like I said Trump would win he did win I said
[39:50.720 --> 39:54.360]  cell phone radiation causes brain cancer it's all admitted so you just label me
[39:54.360 --> 39:58.800]  a conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying no you're branding me as
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.160]  bullying because you're the Democrats who use tragedies to bully gun owners and
[40:03.160 --> 40:07.520]  Americans you're the bullies saying hashtag hunt Republicans go out and get
[40:07.520 --> 40:12.560]  in our face make us uncomfortable everywhere have a civil war God these
[40:12.560 --> 40:16.840]  people are scum continue families who's six and seven year old day up kids were
[40:16.840 --> 40:21.320]  slaughtered at Sandy Hook back up ten seconds the internet did not believe
[40:21.320 --> 40:25.340]  some of the anomalies at Sandy Hook I looked at both sides Megan Kelly came
[40:25.340 --> 40:28.600]  down here I said I believe it happened she edited the tape that's all gonna come
[40:28.600 --> 40:32.000]  out in court these lawsuits are all getting thrown out so then he brings in
[40:32.000 --> 40:38.080]  his next lie let's continue who's brand is bullying he launched similar attacks
[40:38.080 --> 40:41.720]  against the families who's six and seven year old kids were slaughtered at
[40:41.720 --> 40:46.440]  Sandy Hook and he's not the only one truthers have spread these lies claiming
[40:46.440 --> 40:51.560]  that Sandy Hook never happened at all a slate article references a study by
[40:51.560 --> 40:54.280]  Jonathan Albright director of the Tau Center for Digital Journalism at
[40:54.280 --> 40:58.520]  Columbia who found 9,000 videos on YouTube with titles that are and I quote
[40:58.520 --> 41:03.200]  a mixture of shocking vile and promotional themes that include rape game
[41:03.200 --> 41:07.720]  jokes shock reality social experiments celebrity pedophilia false flag rants
[41:07.720 --> 41:11.800]  and pause again they let Google got caught YouTube got caught member in a
[41:11.800 --> 41:17.200]  big national scandal where they let all the pedophilia stuff and all the leftist
[41:17.200 --> 41:21.720]  shock videos that they sponsored stay up then they mix us into that see the next
[41:21.720 --> 41:26.120]  trick by the scumbag continue you see theories dating back to the Oklahoma
[41:26.120 --> 41:31.560]  City attacks in 1995 well that wasn't in such downs does Google think that this
[41:31.560 --> 41:36.440]  is a problem and what is the solution that you're coming up with to address it
[41:36.440 --> 41:41.640]  thank you for the question so as you noted when Alex Jones posted the video
[41:41.640 --> 41:46.400]  you described saying that the survivors of the Parkland massacre were crisis
[41:46.400 --> 41:50.000]  actors that violated our harassment policy we have a specific policy that
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.520]  says if you say a well documented violent attack should happen and you use
[41:54.520 --> 41:57.960]  the name or image of survivors or victims of that attack that is a
[41:57.960 --> 42:01.800]  malicious attack and it violates our policy in terms of conspiracy theory
[42:01.800 --> 42:06.400]  content generally our goal is to promote authoritative content to our users so
[42:06.400 --> 42:10.520]  we have two principles establishment did pause again they force feed mainstream
[42:10.520 --> 42:15.840]  garbage and then they force feed mainstream lies about us she knows it
[42:15.840 --> 42:19.760]  was a big controversy in our videos a reinstatement she heads it so she's
[42:19.760 --> 42:25.080]  there knowingly defaming me it's all for the lawsuits it's all for the anti-trust

[48:46.160 --> 48:50.400]  same things i never did and then lying about their response when they had to
[48:50.400 --> 48:54.520]  remove their strikes against me because they were frauds because it was a lie
[48:54.520 --> 48:59.800]  and the democrat congressman dutch and the rest of them this is sick to watch
[48:59.800 --> 49:05.880]  cnn the new york times the washington post all the mainstream media together
[49:05.880 --> 49:11.560]  lying about the free press lying about us lying about trump and then lying in
[49:11.560 --> 49:17.040]  hearings and calling for an end to the first amendment it is outrageous it is
[49:17.040 --> 49:22.440]  incredible and america needs to stand up it needs to be antitrust suits there
[49:22.440 --> 49:25.960]  needs to be unlimited lawsuits there needs to be serious racketeering
[49:25.960 --> 49:31.080]  charges for fraud this is a coordinated evil attack on america's basic
[49:31.080 --> 49:37.360]  underpinning principles and it is incredible we've got more of the clips
[49:37.360 --> 49:42.680]  coming up later but first let's get into what happened with trump and putin
[49:42.680 --> 49:48.560]  and all the rest of it there's a viral article up on info wars dot com that's
[49:48.560 --> 49:58.000]  very very important putin bombshell deep state moved 400 million from russia to
[49:58.000 --> 50:03.920]  hillary clinton campaign jamie white article info wars dot com collusion
[50:03.920 --> 50:09.400]  actually between us intelligence and democrats there's another article out
[50:09.400 --> 50:13.240]  of zero hedge putin claims us intelligence agents funneled 400 million
[50:13.240 --> 50:17.680]  to clinton campaign by u.s. state department money they sent into russia
[50:17.680 --> 50:21.080]  which they've been they spend billions a year trying to overthrow putin that's
[50:21.080 --> 50:24.680]  on record and then bringing the money back it's been confirmed ukrainian money
[50:24.680 --> 50:31.080]  that the west put in billions then came back to hillary as well so again
[50:31.080 --> 50:35.480]  they're the ones caught red-handed meddling they're the ones caught involved
[50:35.480 --> 50:43.040]  in all of this so let's go ahead and play a clip of putins from yesterday's
[50:43.040 --> 50:49.800]  press conference with president trump talking about it for instance we can
[50:49.800 --> 50:56.920]  bring up the mr. broder in this particular case business associates of
[50:56.920 --> 51:03.800]  mr. broder have earned over one and a half billion dollars in russia they
[51:03.800 --> 51:08.160]  never paid any taxes neither in russia nor in the united states and yet the
[51:08.160 --> 51:14.280]  money escape the country they were transferred to the united states they
[51:14.280 --> 51:19.600]  sent huge amount of money 400 million as a contribution to to the campaign of
[51:19.600 --> 51:25.480]  hillary clinton well that's their personal case it might have been legal the
[51:25.480 --> 51:29.680]  contribution itself but the way the money was earned was illegal so we have a
[51:29.680 --> 51:34.760]  solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers accompanied and
[51:34.760 --> 51:41.320]  guided these transactions so we have an interest of questioning them we can all
[51:41.320 --> 51:48.920]  that could be a first step and we can also extend it options abound and they
[51:48.920 --> 51:53.840]  all can be found in an appropriate legal framework and that's bill brouder so
[51:53.840 --> 51:57.720]  he's talking about the articles up on info wars comm will retweet it right
[51:57.720 --> 52:02.080]  now at real alec jones but this is a total war they don't want this being
[52:02.080 --> 52:06.160]  discussed and trump brought up hillary server who cares who got into it she had
[52:06.160 --> 52:09.120]  it illegally she was letting all these countries get into it selling out our
[52:09.120 --> 52:13.960]  secrets that was a dropbox to foreign countries the all these fake indictments
[52:13.960 --> 52:18.600]  by Mueller they keep getting thrown out so he follows new ones but then you get
[52:18.600 --> 52:22.320]  into the republican leadership and all these fox newshoes saying there's a
[52:22.320 --> 52:30.880]  consensus trump through america under the bus it goes on and on and on so the
[52:30.880 --> 52:34.840]  question is even the London independence reporting on this who is bill
[52:34.840 --> 52:38.200]  brouder and why did russia issue an interpol arrest warrant for the British
[52:38.200 --> 52:44.840]  Putin critic and then it goes in to all of it but the claim that the Russians
[52:44.840 --> 52:48.320]  are involved in our elections when they can barely stabilize their own country
[52:48.320 --> 52:55.680]  and rt is a bunch of watered-down cnn crud when the west spends billions trying
[52:55.680 --> 53:01.080]  to overthrow Russia every year and that's public that's public and they hate
[53:01.080 --> 53:04.440]  russia now the left loved it bernie sanders honeymoon there when it was a
[53:04.440 --> 53:08.640]  place to go torture and kill christians and you know piss all over the cross
[53:08.640 --> 53:12.640]  and that's where little devil worshipers like bernie sanders go to have their way
[53:12.640 --> 53:17.200]  we know how much you know the socialist and communist hate christians but now
[53:17.200 --> 53:21.400]  you see it's christian again now it's free market now it's coming back now
[53:21.400 --> 53:24.680]  they're letting white farmers being murdered in South Africa by the
[53:24.680 --> 53:30.200]  thousands immigrate there as real refugees and so that's why russia is
[53:30.200 --> 53:35.800]  now the big fat enemy that's why russia has to be destroyed I haven't even gotten
[53:35.800 --> 53:40.640]  to brian stelter says info or should be banned of course he does brian stelter

[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.960]  offended for other reasons trace lice it a transgender actress who plays a
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.960]  transgender character on the amazon series transparent didn't protest the
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.440]  casting of joe hanson because the character was an insult to the
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.920]  transgender lice it was offended that joe hanson was taking work from people
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:32.120]  like her lice it complained on twitter that not only do you play us and steal
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:35.480]  our narrative in our opportunity but you pat yourselves on the back with
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:42.120]  trophies and accolades for mimicking what we have lived so twisted i'm so done
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.520]  forget acting chops transgender should get every role in hollywood because of
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:51.240]  their sexual identity that's straight up pc racketeering and recently papa
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.800]  johns founder john schnatter faced the pc mob after complaining during a
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:00.840]  conference call that kfc's colonel sanders use the n word but never face
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:05.080]  public criticism of course schnatter actually use the n word you use the
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:09.880]  word you tell us the regret as soon as it came out did you regret what
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.680]  what prompted the use they were promoting that kind of vocabulary and they
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.480]  kept hitting it i'm like no we're not going to go we're not going to do that
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.880]  that's not how we we uh that's not what we're about in our our heart and soul
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:26.920]  of papa johns and they kept going and i said listen so-and-so used the n word
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:31.160]  i don't use the n word we don't use the word and we've never used the n word
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:36.440]  so that's dead in the conversation they had another party that they wanted us
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:43.080]  to partner with and this other party used that word a lot and um nothing against
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:48.680]  the other party but i don't want to be part of it and um by the fourth or fifth
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.200]  pass i just said no you know we're not going to be we're not going to be part
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.160]  of any such thing papa johns ceo steve richie responded to the mob saying
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.480]  this past week was the hardest week in my 22 years with papa johns i know the
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.320]  words of john schnatter were offensive and nothing pains me more than knowing
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.480]  they hurt you to be clear those words in no way represent my views or the values
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.640]  of our company as the leader of papa johns i'm sorry racism and insensitive
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:19.000]  language no matter the context will not be tolerated at any level of our company
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.760]  period richie ignored that schnatter was simply making a point
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:27.160]  but the adults in the room were nowhere to be found we all know why schnatter is
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:32.120]  in the hot seat he's a trump supporter but it's fine with the blood drenched pc
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:37.800]  culture mob if every other word used by the now dominant music genre of rap
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:43.320]  is the n word no problem there just complete totalitarian politically

[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:09.480]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.680]  i want to go back
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:16.920]  to some of the press conference yesterday because the media is totally
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:20.040]  ignoring what actually happened there and is calling it treasonous that
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.160]  trump would meet with the russian leader and not telling that he hated him or
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:27.240]  punch him in the nose uh it's it's just incredible when all
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:31.400]  other presidents have done that even back when there was a cold war going on
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.600]  and said nice things to each other
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:38.040]  but meanwhile trump is a very very strong stance on russia
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.800]  and i think has actually been bamboozled into expanded sanctions a lot of
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.840]  things that are extreme or backing these
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:48.920]  ukrainians with with toe missiles and rand paul has made that point
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:52.280]  he's been demonized by cnn and others being called a traitor so these are the
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.480]  guys that love socialism love venezuela love communism
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.160]  hate america but now they're the guardians of america and then i'll get to
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:03.480]  some clips uh of chris wallace and the
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:08.120]  putin interview that was really shameful uh i mean putin tore him up and
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.800]  wallace was just going for political stunts and then rufio panman you know
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.960]  the guy that knocked out three uh anti-fudge just at that one
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.920]  event whether we actually have the other footage as well and he goes after
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.480]  these events where they try to attack men women and children and fights them
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.360]  he's gonna be riding shotgun with us coming up at the bottom of the hour
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.560]  we're gonna open the phones up on all these issues as well the congressional
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:30.360]  hearings going right now or they're misrepresenting what i've said
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:34.760]  calling for us to be banned not admitting that youtube had to remove the
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.280]  strikes against us and admitted that they were fraudulent
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:44.920]  the head spokesperson for youtube just glazed over all that pretty
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:48.520]  incredible when you're in the middle of this and history is happening but the
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:53.480]  big news is we've got four articles on info wars dot com
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:58.120]  with mud former deputy director of the fbi and cia
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:04.280]  he's mueller's literal aid to camp muller's muller muller's aid to camp
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.520]  and then you've got brennan saying trump's guilty of treason and congress
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.920]  from cohen saying we need a military coup mud also said we need a military coup
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:17.640]  this is all yesterday and today they're calling it a civil war but then brian
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:20.760]  stelter comes out and says i should be taken off the air
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:24.200]  because i said the democrats were launching a civil war this summer
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.800]  and i saw the demarcation line of when you could say they were gonna escalate
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:32.760]  as july 4th i was very clear they semantically used that to deceive their
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:37.240]  audiences with a giant rollout over the july 4th and ongoing in thousands of
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:40.760]  publications on every major tv news program that i've seen

[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.320]  real and then they have linguists and people going one of them
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.520]  sounds like a real russian well yeah daria is
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.720]  russian she moved here when she was a kid parents are anti-communist
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.760]  she's been in army special operations command a patriot
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.320]  honorably discharged but that's not enough you see yes a real live russian
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.080]  works here i was thinking about doing a stunt going
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:09.240]  to russia a few months ago and had got my russian visa i tweeted it
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.760]  the media grabbed it and said that they had gotten a copy of it that they'd
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.040]  found a secret document
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.440]  this is the next level meanwhile i support making the country great again
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.680]  rebuilding our military cutting taxes getting thousands of factories back

[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.680]  well i guess they did support trump putin said he liked
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:35.640]  trump over hillary because he thought there might be better chances at better
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:40.440]  relations well you can't say that you evil christian nation
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.600]  meanwhile there's congressional hearings right now going on
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.520]  calling for us to be taken off the air democrat or democrat
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:52.840]  lies about us and then says take us off air and they lie about diamond and silk
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:56.440]  and say take them off because they really fear
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:01.080]  black people saying they support trump that's a no no
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.000]  they've already seen double poll numbers for trump with the black americans
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.320]  they are scared the democrats are dying people are are leaving them so now
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:13.640]  they're panicked okay let's go ahead and go to
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:18.440]  trump on hillary's secret server uh and the awan brothers
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.640]  this is what they changed the subject off of here it is
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:25.960]  you have groups that are wondering why the fbi never took the server
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:31.240]  haven't they taken the server why was the fbi told to leave the office of the
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:34.600]  democratic national committee i've been wondering that i've been
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.360]  asking that for months and months and i've been tweeting it out and calling it
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.680]  out on social media where is the server i want to know where
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:46.840]  is the server and what is the server saying
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:50.040]  with that being said all i can do is ask the question
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.720]  my people came to me dan coats came to me and
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.640]  some others they said they think it's russia uh i have
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.480]  president putin uh he just said it's not russia
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:04.520]  i will say this i don't see any reason why it would be
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:08.760]  but i really do want to see the server uh but i have
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:14.360]  uh i have confidence in both parties i i really believe that this will probably
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.360]  go on for a while but i don't think it can go on without finding out
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.920]  what happened to the server what happened to the servers
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.920]  of the pakistani gentlemen that worked on the dnc
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:30.360]  where are their servers they're missing where are they
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:37.000]  what happened to hillary clinton's emails 33 000 emails gone just gone
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  i think in russia they wouldn't be gone so easily i think it's a disgrace that
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.760]  we can't get hillary clinton's 33 000 emails i have great confidence in my
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:51.160]  intelligence people but uh i will tell you that
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:54.920]  president putin was extremely strong and powerful
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.840]  in his denial today and what he did is an incredible offer
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.000]  he offered to have the people working on the case
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.760]  come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people i think
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:13.000]  that's an incredible offer okay thank you
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.680]  because the russians showed up in court three months ago
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:23.240]  their companies basically us said we most our money was from hillary
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.080]  uh yeah we do show some packs ran some pro gun stuff
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.040]  on facebook and twitter yes yes we ran some pro
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.160]  prompt stuff here here here like 20 000 dollars worth and then from hillary
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:41.160]  groups over a couple hundred thousand yeah yeah we ran pro here's our books

[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:49.000]  that's what we do
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.760]  and putin's like come on come on in and by the way let us in your stuff too
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.680]  because 400 million we saw shipped over out of money or and trump those full
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.960]  well billions are being used currently to try to overthrow russia
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.080]  he knows what a joke it is we're like just punching them in the nose moving

[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.160]  with uh putin on miller indictments you can trust no one
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:22.520]  did you get this idea that president trump trusts me or i trust him
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:26.760]  he defends the interests of the united states of america and i do defend the
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:32.600]  interest of the russian federation we do have interests that common we are
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:38.280]  looking for points of contact there are issues where our postures diverge

[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.920]  how to make our effort and more that was total straight shooting from poot

[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.200]  it really is the real drama can be found here in
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.560]  leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:11.880]  rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:15.320]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.240]  and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:23.400]  to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:28.440]  alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.400]  of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.240]  next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:38.760]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:42.440]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:47.720]  as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:51.880]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:55.160]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:59.400]  water filtration system will purify it
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:28.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:32.280]  history is passing in front of us right now
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:36.440]  i have more articles coming in with democrats calling for the overthrow
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:41.000]  of trump military coups his death uh the 25th amendment
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.280]  his removal they have fox news hosts saying
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:48.840]  the president the consensus is you know uh is a traitor and he needs to be
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.240]  removed and he's going to regret this day
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:55.160]  all these fox hosts that i've watched that the president be nice to
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:58.920]  they are making their move as i told you they've called it a civil war
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:03.000]  a coup you name it and to do that ahead of 2018
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.360]  not just in the election but whatever they've got planned they are
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.960]  shadow banning diamond and silk they are shadow banning info wars
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:14.520]  they are shadow banning all the major pro trump sites
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:18.040]  and then lying about the defamation i saw in hearings today that are still
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.320]  ongoing in the house judiciary against diamond and silk are unbelievable
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:24.280]  they're such sweetie pies they're so charming and nice
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.480]  they're not even political they're just pro america and like trump but because
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:31.800]  they're so lovable and likable they were defamed today
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.920]  they were mixed in with child molesters they would say
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.600]  youtube lets child molesters on and people that show death art and suicide
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:42.440]  that's all the sponsored channels of youtube then they said and jones says no
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:46.440]  kids died at parkland and he bullies them total defamation
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:50.200]  and there was the head of youtube saying well we banned those videos of alex
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.920]  jones no you reinstated him because i had lawyers
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:56.360]  send you letters and sent you the real videos and you went oh
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:00.040]  we had moderators that lied from the southern poverty loss center
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:03.080]  we can put on screen bloomberg even admitted it
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.440]  so now they've gone into famed us again but it's bigger than info wars
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:09.640]  understand this folks they're making their move
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:15.560]  they're saying overthrow the president on television on cnn
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:21.400]  so look at this headline news wars dot com facebook kills pro trump account
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.520]  hours ahead of censorship hearing that's now ongoing
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:29.480]  tom papper has the very popular god emperor trump that's a
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:32.200]  tongue-in-cheek deal a lot of satire a lot of fun reddit stuff
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:36.040]  really nice mainline nation was conservative stuff i like god emperor
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:40.040]  uh at facebook it was at god emperor trump that's gone now at twitter
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:46.280]  real uh g e trump well that's still there uh and so they they started with alex
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:51.160]  jones and mylo and then it's everybody else uh so so give us your take on what
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:53.960]  happened to you i know you've been persecuted a lot because you're so
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.560]  popular dominant on reddit uh and and and now they're
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:00.920]  trying to silence you uh and then of course they defame you while
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:05.000]  they do it they silence you and then defame you so you can't defend yourself
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.920]  they're claiming oh it's a it's a it's a it's a private thing no they operate as
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:12.520]  a utility people communicate now over facebook twitter youtube just like
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.960]  telephones are about to be obsolete and then they tell you it's a commons and
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:19.720]  then don't let you go to the lunch line because you're a conservative uh so
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.840]  tom tell us what's what's happened and you agree with me that
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:27.800]  clearly the the the censorship is a thousand times what it was
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:31.240]  two years ago it's exponential going towards complete
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:35.480]  clearly ahead of some move this is such a bold move
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:38.840]  i don't see how they think they're gonna get away with it well you're
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:42.040]  absolutely right because it's escalating you know a lot of people say
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:45.240]  well what do you want tom and i say well it would be nice if they would just go
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:49.320]  back to how it was two years ago where i could share an info wars article and
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.960]  people would actually get to see it but of course now
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:55.560]  we all get so punished in the algorithm it's impossible for anybody to get out
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.920]  there so this is the sixth time they've come
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:02.440]  after my facebook page got in for trump which is just a fun
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:06.600]  joking page you know we are not bad people we're just trump supporters like
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:09.480]  you say we're just mainstream trump supporters
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:13.880]  sixth time they've gone after us what they did at one in the morning
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:17.160]  uh as soon as everybody was in bed and going to sleep
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:21.320]  they took down the page they unpublished it they didn't remove any content
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.160]  they didn't give us an explanation as to what we did wrong
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:31.400]  nobody individually was punished so it's kind of like yeah you did a bad thing
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.840]  but we're not going to tell you what it is and then as you say alex they won't
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:39.720]  let us defend ourselves because you know they come after us elsewhere they
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:44.440]  reduce the reach of our organic posts on our remaining facebook page so they
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:48.120]  take us down they remove our ability or at least mitigate our ability to
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:51.000]  defend ourselves and then that leaves people like
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.480]  yourself and other conservative journalists and
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:57.160]  conservative media outlets when you guys yourselves are being punished so
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:01.880]  it's just this all across the board multi-front assaults on what's left of
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:07.400]  freedom of speech in this country by these power mad leftists at facebook
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:11.160]  that's right and and something's different now though starting last week
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.840]  about a week and a half ago thousands of articles against info wars misrepresenting
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:19.000]  what i've said never actually showing a clip or a link just saying outrageous
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.960]  you know there's slave colonies on mars never said that there you know no kids
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:26.600]  died at parkland all out of context all eyes but then they brag
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.920]  that oh we're making our move once jones is gone we'll ban everybody
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:33.880]  and then you got cnn the washington post all of them
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:38.200]  new york times saying we want him completely banned it isn't enough and then
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.480]  they go on to say and all conspiracies and all hate
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:45.800]  well that means everybody who is right of mouse a tongue
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.160]  right that's exactly right they want to remove everybody i say to the right of
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:52.280]  stalling because that's exactly what it will take
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.400]  and that i love when they do that don't they they say you know they'll throw out
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:59.400]  three nasty horrible names you never want to hear and then they'll say comma
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.160]  alex jones and it's like one of these things is not like the other alex jones
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:06.680]  is not like these other people you've mentioned but that's how they trick the
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:10.440]  masses that's how they slip the kool-aid into the water supply i guess
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:14.280]  they tell you well you see alex jones is just like these bad people god emperor
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:16.840]  trump is just like these bad people you've heard about
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:20.440]  and so when we punish alex when we punish this little facebook page
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.200]  it's okay because we're helping fake news and it's just you know it's the
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:28.440]  it's the laziest non-argument i've ever heard of this person's bad
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:31.720]  let's gun him down that's essentially what it amounts to it's the
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:35.880]  it's it's childlike and i think like you say i don't think they can get away with
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.400]  it because americans and patriots all across the globe
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:43.160]  anybody who hates the globalists really we're all very smart people
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.760]  and they expect us to believe this nonsense that you know probably wouldn't
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.680]  have worked if it had been pushed in the 1960s
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.360]  uh exactly in a month ago they started hitting amazon over films i uploaded
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.160]  years ago weren't even making any money now now we've actually
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.800]  strized that effect we've we've actually gotten some decent revenue
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:04.040]  of old films we just put on facebook and i'm on facebook on amazon
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:08.040]  and they went to amazon and said all over the news in a major
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:13.720]  rollout ban his videos they're evil and hateful they called in-game a nazi movie
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.080]  the film is about the nazis and says they're bad
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:21.720]  and exposes eugenics and how the nazis were leftist
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:25.160]  and you know what that does it removes people a bit people's ability to learn
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:29.080]  what made you famous i mean back when i was a kid when i was a teenager i had a
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:32.760]  friend who would bring over his alex jones documentary collection we would
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:36.600]  watch that over the weekend and if people can't go back and see what you
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.840]  were saying at the beginning of your career
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.440]  well then the media just gets to say what you were saying at the beginning of
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.120]  your career and so it just it it layers this
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.320]  propaganda so you know you can no longer defend yourself you can no longer
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.920]  say well look what i was saying back in 2004 which is the credibility because we
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:55.880]  laid out the whole thing about globalism the new world order it became the
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:00.040]  operating system of the new republic launch and they know that we
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:02.920]  help reboot the deal so they want to get rid of that history because the
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:06.200]  credibility goes straight up and we've got a rufio the
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:11.000]  antifa slayer coming on to stay with us when he comes on let's talk about all

[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:28.280]  they always go oh the republicans have the house the senate judiciary the
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:32.200]  legislature uh the executive the three branches of
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:37.800]  government the legislator the executive judiciary but
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:41.160]  that's not the real power all the big corporations hollywood all the big
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.440]  money all of it is attacking nationalists attacking
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:48.360]  conservatives and this is like america's last stand we're going under globalist
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:51.560]  control if we don't turn this around they're having
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:55.240]  hearings right now on banning in full wars and banning
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:59.560]  diamond and silk uh tom pappert of trump god emperor

[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:06.520]  thousand on their one fan page uh obviously everybody knows you know
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:10.360]  trump god emperor is just you know fun reddit type stuff but because he's
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.960]  popular he was banned today ahead of these hearings we're gonna go
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.160]  back to him in a moment but coming up the next hour and 15 minutes we have
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:20.280]  rufio what are some of the areas you want to get into
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:23.000]  um well just like you said you know patrice are being attacked all over the
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.400]  place whether it's funding um support just you know living their daily
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:31.640]  lives um on any level whether you're as involved as i am on the
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:35.560]  streets or just barely supporting by you know using facebook
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.720]  um people are attacking you and um and it's it's a serious problem a lot of us
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:42.600]  facing i never asked you this question when you were
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:45.880]  last on because i know you use a known deployment which is great and it's good
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:48.520]  to have your cake and eat it too have your free speech but not have them
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:52.680]  target your family i would imagine you're quite the target now at these
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:56.200]  antifa rallies where there's a prayer vigil and they try to come attack
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.800]  folks i mean i'm gonna imagine you're now kind of like you know one of the top
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.560]  guys they're gunning for oh yeah i'm sure it's all over twitter facebook
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:07.480]  instagram everything um but what they need to realize is i have my boys too
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:11.560]  and um just like you know a lot of people say it's uh takes about 10 of them to
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:14.680]  take out one of us so you know that's that's where we stand in the
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:18.280]  city why is it that case all over europe all over the u.s it's i mean a woman
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:21.320]  will beat up three or four of them yeah and that's a victory to them
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:24.920]  you know they'll go and brag about that to their comrades but uh
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:29.400]  which shows what man would be proud of attacking a woman
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.320]  yeah there is no man no man that can claim being an actual man
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.360]  that's that's what i would say
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:42.040]  let me ask that question uh of the fella uh who heads up trump got emperor
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:44.600]  tom papper who just got censored out of these hearings today
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:48.360]  what do you think's going on in the mind of these mentally ill people
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:52.680]  well you know i think they're very very lonely first of all and so part of it
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:57.000]  is you know you go out you get five of your your toughest little stick friends
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.080]  together and you go and you beat up a woman and that is to them that's a
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:04.520]  wonderful social event and it's an opportunity for them to all come
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.800]  together and really fight back and resist the evil
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:11.320]  trump administration and so you know it just it goes
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:14.200]  a lot of what you talk about you know they have no community they have no
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:18.360]  friends they have no tribe they're not like you know a patriot where i can
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.760]  pick up the phone and talk to any number of people
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:24.040]  who will say what on earth is going on with facebook now
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:29.240]  they're just lonely cripplingly sad people and i think that going and
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:32.280]  beating up a woman or getting beat up what buy a woman
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:36.360]  as it more than often ends up being i think that's just an exciting way for
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:39.080]  them to get out and make friends to be completely honest
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:43.640]  and then they're backed by all these tech heads of slave factories in china
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:46.920]  who don't allow free speech who don't pay taxes
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.400]  and then they run around beating up middle-class people saying we're
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:53.800]  communists we're anti free market they couldn't be a more pathetic group
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:57.960]  yeah definitely yeah they're attacking everybody this is where their strength
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:01.240]  is uh just by attacking everybody on social media trying to take away your
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:04.360]  funds trying to uh ruin your reputation anyway they
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:08.040]  can they're the ultimate bullies right and then they say we're bullies they
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:10.360]  said that in congress today congressman dutch
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:15.080]  said that jowitz jones's media system is bullying he is bullying no they're the
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.800]  bullies uh in the three minutes we've got left tom other
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:22.360]  points you want to add about the systemic uh um censorship manipulation
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:25.080]  you've seen and and how do you think trump should counter this i think one of
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:29.080]  his only big failings is he really needs to go with antitrust they need to
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.960]  really go i mean i've been watching these hearings i got
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:35.480]  our tech people watching it and and just these congressmen and women are so
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:38.360]  ignorant the republicans just don't understand it's why we wrote this big
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:41.480]  report for them they just need to get this
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:45.640]  well i i think reading that report is a good place to start for all legislators
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:48.440]  you know those are the people who need to read it you know what was it 10 years
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:52.200]  ago you had the one legislator saying well the internet that's tubes right
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:56.920]  you know these are not the most tech savvy people out there first of all so
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:02.360]  we need to somehow have a big public campaign to explain this issue to our
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:05.880]  legislators that there will never be another trump president there will
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:09.000]  never be another conservative populist uprising
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.200]  if we allow them to demolish our first amendment like this
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.400]  and reading what was happening to you rufio it just in the last couple of
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:19.080]  minutes on a twitter that's disgusting the fact that they're taking away your
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:22.840]  money they're attacking people's funds our ability to get out there and really
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:25.160]  fight this fight and i think it goes back to the
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:29.640]  fact that these are cripplingly lonely people they look at our supplies of
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:32.840]  popular this is a war they're trying to cut our supplies off

[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.320]  listeners and others don't support all of us and realize it's a war if people
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:10.600]  don't resupply us who are listening and understand they can't just count others
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:14.280]  now we could lose let's see that's the trick we need

[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:28.600]  in the house judiciary committee meeting where the democrats are up there
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:33.720]  defaming and slandering and libeling conservatives libertarians myself
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:38.200]  mainly diamond and silt saying horrible lies we need to be de-platformed
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:42.040]  we're holocaust deniers we're nazis we say no kids died at parkland

[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:51.160]  part when they brought it up and now we have congressman matt gates
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:56.360]  i just wonder who briefed him on all this uh blast social media giants over
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:00.840]  free speech protection hypocrisy it is powerful
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:04.760]  it's coming up at the end of this segment in a moment but riding shotgun with me
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:09.800]  is rufio panman uh on facebook for now at rufio panman
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:13.480]  pb and instagram rufio underscore panman listen

[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:20.680]  go follow him there so do it yes we know they don't let us
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:23.800]  share on facebook twitter or youtube we're there to fight because they don't
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:27.000]  want us there to then reach out to people and bring them to our own
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.520]  websites to build a resistance so that we're able to reach out to congress
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:33.000]  educate the president i've written a report with mike
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.560]  adams with paul watcher that's gone to the president
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:39.240]  it's gone to the congressman we are forming the resistance
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:43.320]  just like 25 years ago we began forming the resistance is against globalism
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:47.800]  now it's all over the world we defined it exposed it was a covert operation
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:51.320]  now if we expose their censorship things don't happen right away
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.240]  but it's going to happen in in just a year or so or less
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:58.920]  if you look at history so now things are compressed and our victories are
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:04.200]  assured if you the listeners on am fm on tv you name it
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:07.720]  every time you're watching you spread the word you do that with people power
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:12.120]  will override their machines we will override their algorithms and we've
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:14.680]  already beaten them and they don't know what to do so they're going to pure
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:17.640]  censorship which calls them out and pulls them out
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:20.680]  rufio you've got the floor here is your nice polite guy you came to austin
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:22.280]  texas i want to talk about working with you and
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:24.920]  didn't you and some of the guys be reporters for us there's auxiliary
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:27.160]  reporters but hopefully some have a paid gig but
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.840]  those got to financially buy products for us to do that just just what's most on
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:34.280]  your mind the sense of where we are historically it's all over the news they
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:38.120]  say kill the president military coup against team congressman are saying
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.560]  military congressman cohen of tennessee move against the president
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:45.720]  i mean they are really moving and we're just kind of sitting here like oh well
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:49.240]  we're america that'll never happen but you're on the front line you see what's
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:53.640]  happening cnn anderson cooper phil mud said deep state needs to remove
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:57.560]  trump last night i mean this is intensifying and i just think
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:00.600]  people don't realize this why are you so upset what do you have so much energy
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:04.200]  well i'm sitting around fishing or sitting around you know with my family
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:08.280]  around the campfire i'm i don't hardly talk this is history happening and
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:12.520]  people needing out of their comfort zone yeah exactly
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:16.280]  um i mean whether whether you're going to be as involved as i am or or barely
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:19.880]  involved at all um the second people start to wake up and
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:24.200]  start to act on what's going on they get attacked whether it's fear tactics
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:28.280]  showing up to your house slashing your tires or trying to uh remove any kind
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:31.240]  of donation funding like you want to go out on the streets you want to go
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:34.680]  travel the country and be involved with these free speech events and just
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:38.600]  protect people protect yourself uh that requires finance
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:42.200]  and uh a lot of people out there are willing to to donate but what's
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:45.080]  happening is these platforms are being attacked they're being bombarded by
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:48.040]  antifa let's get into that you've got the courage to go out 10 to one when
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:51.800]  these guys are trying to beat women and and and defensively beat their ass
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:55.400]  but just like a soldier if he doesn't have backing or he doesn't have a ship
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:58.520]  to get him to the foreign shore or he doesn't have a pack with food in it
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:01.640]  you've got the heart and guts to fight but but they've cut off your funding
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:05.560]  which is tell folks about that well yeah you're you're certainly right that
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:10.360]  does affect uh a lot of us um i would say for you know for proud boys we go
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:14.280]  out there completely uh voluntarily we have that's gavin mcginnis's group
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:18.680]  yes gavin mcginnis is a founder of our of our fraternity um we're all going out
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:22.760]  there without any financial backing it and also we're going out there knowing
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:25.240]  that there's a possibility that we're going to get injured or that our
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:28.520]  property is going to get vandalized so we have to deal with that as well um and
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:31.160]  you were talking about that you've had go fund me's you name it they kick off
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:34.360]  yeah just thousands of dollars just gone when you need it most when you're out
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:37.320]  in the middle of these cities and all of a sudden your funding is gone
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:41.560]  and so it can be a very dangerous situation for some people
[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:46.120]  well trump and congress need to do something how do we educate them
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:51.640]  um you know i i would say just uh bring more awareness what's going on more
[01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:55.000]  people showing up more optics on this situation the better
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.160]  um people need to get as as involved as involved as possible
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:03.320]  um whether that's you know you know helping out a patriot with
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:06.360]  financial support or being out there yourself on the street or
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:10.200]  whatever that may look like for you whatever you can do um send a
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:14.840]  write a letter uh to your local um politician whatever you can do
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:19.080]  um it it helps the smallest thing helps the thing is is
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:21.720]  not a lot of people are really going out and doing it because they don't think
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:24.920]  it'll really make a difference and well yeah we have tens of millions of
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:28.600]  listeners but only a fraction ever buy any products or do anything right and
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:31.480]  i'm not complaining the other listeners okay fine at least spread the word but
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:35.000]  you understand this is a real war this is real
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.160]  you know nip and tuck this is like down to the wire
[01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:42.680]  with horrible evil authoritarians backed by the chai comms
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:47.800]  trying to take the country down yeah and i don't think people realize how easy
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:51.480]  it is to become a target you don't have to go to a free speech event like me
[01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:54.600]  and be out there on the front lines in front of antifa to become a target to
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:58.680]  where you and your family are now vulnerable it takes a simple facebook post
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:02.280]  a simple like or share of a video um maybe you support
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:06.040]  president trump mildly or maybe you support him 100 percent
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:09.480]  it any one of those things could make you a target and then now you're a part of
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:13.560]  this fight that uh and if we give into this cult
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:17.080]  next they dictate everything it's like once you give into that it's like their
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:20.520]  own cult members scarlett joe hanson tries to make a movie praising
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:24.040]  transgenderism but because she's a woman they don't want her playing it all gang
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:26.280]  up on her it's all about you in fighting
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:30.360]  weird people that want to control reality yeah it's all fear tactics
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:34.200]  in person they don't really amount to anything but uh in the age we live in
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:38.120]  with social media and everything tied in your whole life is tied in over
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:41.880]  uh you know your finances and things like that fear tactics
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:45.400]  become very um and take out uber you know says oh you're
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:48.920]  conservative get out of my car or oh you work for the president get out of my
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:51.400]  restaurant i wish they'd hang a shingle in their
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:55.720]  window saying conservatives libertarians uh christians national it's not wanted
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:58.760]  we've got the money we're the hard workers so i think they're creating a
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:02.680]  system that will further isolate the coastal elites
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:07.080]  right yeah it's bad business it's it's horribly bad business and if they want
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:10.680]  to keep doing that you know so be it but other businesses are going to rise
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:14.280]  and they're going to overcome as long as we keep pushing forward you know
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:17.000]  we're uh worse there's tons of patriots out there establishing
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.560]  businesses right now exactly we've got to hold the line and we've got to
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:24.200]  continue we're on the front line so we're going to get the main brunt but
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:26.920]  we're winning the war yeah go and support your fellow
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:30.760]  patriots and their businesses if you know somebody who's a you know uh loves
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:33.480]  america and they're running a business go support their business
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:39.240]  because right now uh business is being attacked and it's it's on a grand scale
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:42.520]  all over the nation this is this is this is 21st century war we're under
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:46.120]  globalist attack we're this is the attempt to take down america and thank god
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:49.320]  some of our own patriots in the government out saw it and said this is
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:52.920]  too evil to in free speech bankrupt america put us under china and so yeah
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:55.400]  there are patriots in our government working with everybody
[01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:58.920]  and trump is it took it like a suicide mission i can tell you
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:01.960]  very fatalistic he's going to execute he doesn't care what happens
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:05.480]  he's going all the way yeah i admire him 100 he's
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:09.880]  renewed hope in me for for the political system and uh definitely
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:15.160]  put a spark into my butt to get out there and and do what i can as an american
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:18.520]  it's amazing to see somebody like him committed and then the fact that he
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:20.920]  stepped into that office with that power of commitment
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:24.600]  and then the power of the office and it just it terrifies him because
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:27.080]  he just he's gonna do the right thing and that's it and they don't know what
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:29.880]  to do yeah it's hilarious really when you stand
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:33.080]  back and you really see the reactions of everybody whether it be
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:36.520]  you know russia or stormy daniels it's just funny how they keep back going
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:40.040]  back and forth trying to find something to pin on him and he just keeps being
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:42.920]  he keeps moving forward and he keeps achieving all of these things that he
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:46.120]  said he was going to and it's amazing to watch well it's thanks to listeners of
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:48.920]  this broadcast the enemy has identified the truth that we are
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:52.040]  the main core that helped launch the whole trump operation and trump knows
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:54.680]  that uh his his campaign knows that and then
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:58.760]  they're great people by the way they listen all the time uh and
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:02.520]  they they just say keep it up we're not gonna betray you don't betray us
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:06.040]  we're gonna win and then they say we don't have a choice think about how bad
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:09.240]  the global star if they get control that's what we should be worrying about
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:12.440]  it's not a sacrifice we're making you know we can trick ourselves and say oh
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:15.880]  we're making these sacrifices no the real sacrifice would be letting real
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:18.920]  tyranny come in because they want to break america's back and teach us a
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:22.360]  lesson yeah definitely and go ahead no one

[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:47.080]  i've gone back there like eight times they've got it on the tv and
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:49.800]  every time i walk back there i'm being talked about
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:53.320]  i mean this is getting surreal okay and they're just lying
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:56.360]  and they're banning everybody i keep explaining it's not just me they're
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:00.280]  using me as the poster child and now diamond and silk i guess they
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:03.880]  pick on the two black ladies because they're so effective uh rufio panman
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:07.160]  is our guest in studio here there's a bunch of videos we keep
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:09.640]  showing the one that i forgot to give them the crew of just
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:13.240]  anti-free trying to hit him with metal batons attacking ladies and him knocking
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:16.360]  them out we've obviously shown the tommy robinson footage of him
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:19.080]  taking on a bunch of them and you know knocking a couple out he's not even a
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:22.680]  big guy uh like uh rufio will play some of those clips
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:25.720]  in the next segment and the congress from gates clip but in the four or five
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:28.840]  minutes we have here get into just your background your life
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:32.280]  type of americana guy that never got politically involved until he saw
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:36.200]  women and children getting beaten up uh well you know i've always been
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:40.280]  pretty patriotic uh you know i grew up on country music you know i
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:45.880]  i've always just kind of been very passive and kind of a shy person and
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:48.680]  it wasn't until recently after trump got elected obviously where everything
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:51.560]  started to get crazy and i started started seeing people getting
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.760]  attacked in the streets for wearing a trump hat
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:57.640]  and uh i just knew that that wasn't something i could stand for i didn't
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:01:59.720]  want to see that come to my city i didn't want to see
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:02.680]  you know my future children have to deal with that
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:05.800]  um so i started getting involved and that's when i met proud boys uh gab
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:11.160]  mcginnis's group that he created back in 2016 and it's ever since then it's
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:14.440]  just been a you know a bit of huge learning experience and seeing what's
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:17.480]  really happening you know once you kind of test the water you start to see
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:20.680]  what's under the surface and it's it's really ugly when you start to
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:24.680]  you know see what's under the surface a lot of evil stuff going on and uh
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:27.800]  left his cities left his police defending people that attack women and
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:30.200]  children yeah exactly you know it doesn't really get
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:34.120]  any worse than that um but hopefully you know we'll cross your fingers and hope
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:36.920]  it doesn't get worse than that and we can kind of get handle on it but again
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:41.640]  you know that requires a lot of support from other people other than just us
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:45.160]  when i see you knock one of these guys out or
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:47.640]  other people when they're trying to kill you with them we're talking with metal
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:49.880]  baton that'll kill somebody break an arm you name it
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:53.880]  break somebody's neck knock their eye out give them a concussion subgeneral
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:57.960]  hematoma because he because always you know it's footage we
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:01.240]  don't get all the audio with little details or or all what happens but they
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:05.160]  just cut and run when one person fights back it's the
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:08.680]  archetypal coward i mean what are the little images that people don't catch
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:13.160]  because they weren't there um well you know obviously it's very chaotic
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:17.080]  everything happens very fast when you're up on you know hyped up on adrenaline
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:20.840]  but i'll tell you right now uh when you have when our boys are out there when
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:24.600]  our proud boys are out there strong it's it's the strongest feeling it's almost
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:28.440]  palpable the energy of this the freedom that the american spirit
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:32.280]  running through the streets and i think that once they start to see
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:35.960]  you know these quote-unquote casualties happen around them it's in it's
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:39.160]  extremely intimidating to see the you know the american spirit and raw
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:42.520]  force like that and uh you know that's what we have going for us and as long
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:46.440]  as we can keep that going uh we can be extremely effective
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:49.640]  who's the christian fellow that puts on these pervigil since he saw women getting
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:54.120]  beaten up what's his name joy gibson there's there's iconic photos like the
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:57.880]  marines raising the flag or whatever but it's very iconic where he's pointing at
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:01.160]  some of these people and you're looking with some other folks and it's like you
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:04.280]  just pick up the image of folks ready to exercise the first
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:07.480]  of them they see the enemy they're ready you're confident it's just a very
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:11.640]  iconic photo if they can try to find that you know the photo
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:15.320]  um i've seen multiple photos i don't know uh which one specifically you're
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:18.040]  talking about i think he's wearing like a red hat and he's pointing
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:20.360]  and then and then and then you're sitting there looking where he's pointing it's
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:23.320]  just a very iconic photo it might have been uh from a
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:26.920]  seattle rally i think i know what you might be talking about um
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:32.360]  because this is all very iconic yeah yeah it's it's very easy to capture the
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:36.280]  optics are so easy it's you know you don't it's all organic and all the
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:39.480]  stuff that none of this stuff is scripted out none of it's it's a bunch of rats
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:45.480]  right attacking people's free speech exactly i just it's so i keep saying
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:48.760]  this i just can't imagine being a bunch of men and knowing
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:52.200]  out and trying to target somebody in a wheelchair or a woman i just i mean i
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:54.760]  would never kill myself but if i was like that i would kill myself we'll be
[02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:58.280]  right back living in volcano may sound more
[02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:02.520]  dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:05.320]  estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:09.640]  rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:13.160]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:17.000]  and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.240]  to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:25.400]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact
[02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:29.240]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:33.080]  next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:36.600]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:40.280]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:45.560]  as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:49.720]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:53.400]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water
[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:57.000]  filtration system will purify it
[02:06:00.200 --> 02:06:05.080]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:27.560]  it's alex jones
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:31.400]  rufio panman is in studio with us he's a member of gavin mcgenus's
[02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:34.680]  proud boys and he got involved with the last year and a half seeing women and
[02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:38.360]  children beaten up by antifa prayer vigils pro gun rallies not even
[02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:42.280]  trump supporters sometimes being attacked so he's become well known
[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:46.360]  if you just joined us going out and uh standing up for people and you know
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:49.480]  famously knocking a lot of these guys out and i forgot you were coming to
[02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:52.200]  town i invited you there's several other films of you
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:55.000]  clocking these guys out so maybe during the break you can tell the crew to find
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.040]  those i've seen them but it's just amazing that guy's swinging one of those
[02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:01.720]  extendable metal batons there's a deadly weapon at you
[02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:05.240]  and he's swinging it at you like it's a switch thank god he didn't know how to
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:08.200]  put it above his head or the side and use it properly but you still
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:11.160]  he still swings it you're pretty good and tries to hit you in the head with it
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:14.600]  and uh you're strong enough to catch him in full swing
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:17.960]  that would have broken your hand easily look it looks like you grab it in
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:21.000]  flight when he's swinging it over a hundred miles an hour so
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.160]  i don't know if i could have myself have made that catch so just congratulations
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:28.520]  yeah man uh you know adrenaline does great things for you but uh this isn't my
[02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:31.960]  first time uh going out to these things i've been
[02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:35.080]  you know i'm pretty well versed with dealing with antifa and
[02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:40.520]  and uh you know like-minded people by the way slow that down because you do this
[02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:45.080]  Popeye wind up but then you decide not to go full power why was that
[02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:49.480]  um yeah i couldn't tell you you know i think uh everything happens in the
[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:51.800]  moment i think your gut was don't break your hand you're
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:54.760]  gonna have more to fight right yeah because both my hands have been roughed
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:57.720]  up pretty good from defending myself against these guys on multiple
[02:07:57.720 --> 02:08:01.160]  occasions i've been hit with clubs and stuff on my hands and so
[02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:05.000]  you know um going full power obviously in defense is
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:09.800]  sometimes uh makes you vulnerable but you know i did the best i could and
[02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:12.040]  obviously i think about the brain though like you said in an adrenaline
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:15.960]  everything slows down and your body's like no i'll take this guy out with a
[02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:19.160]  half punch you see you like the governor kick in he goes
[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:22.840]  it's just awesome yeah yeah you know everything happened
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:25.640]  naturally and organically there how does he not smack the chick that was like
[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:28.280]  once he was going to hit you that was real control
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:32.040]  uh gotta show it really really slowly i go ahead
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:35.320]  yep there you go those sunglasses are still flying how does you i'm good job
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:38.040]  not smacking her but how did you not do it because that's what they try to do
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:41.720]  when i was at the uh inauguration they kept punching me pushing me
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:46.280]  trying to get me to do something well i i saw that as a female you know and uh
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:50.120]  she she wasn't wearing a mask so that was instantly my my thought was okay
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:54.120]  she's not an immediate threat even if she decides to be aggressive with me
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:57.480]  she doesn't have a weapon um and then my focus became on
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:00.760]  grabbing that baton that went to the ground and confiscating that weapon
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:03.480]  well obviously again you use an alias because they'll threaten your family
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:06.120]  come after you they've attacked a reporter's cars you name it we know
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:09.640]  how dangerous they are but but just your family background because you
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:12.920]  because i mean it seems like you have a lot of control a lot of cops and
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:16.040]  military that watch the video comment on impulse wars they were really impressed
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:20.200]  with the control you had um yeah you know it's it's it's
[02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:24.760]  hard to say uh yeah i was raised pretty well um i've always been
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:29.320]  kind of a patient person shy um and i do really well in chaotic
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:32.920]  environments that's my strong suit uh so you know obviously in this type of
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:37.640]  environment it's it's where i thrive and where i try and take leadership and uh
[02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:41.400]  a lot of my boys are the same way so we do we're really effective out there
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:45.080]  when we work together not that we're afraid of anti-fab but i may actually
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:48.280]  go there tonight uh and and so it's up to you guys if you want to tell
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:52.280]  folks where we're going to eat tonight uh and then i mean if i is here in austin
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:55.560]  they are malibu gay they've they've threatened to kill oh and myself and
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:10:00.120]  others obviously we'll be packing uh but for defensive purposes but do we want
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:03.160]  to tell folks we're having dinner tonight
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:08.200]  you know uh are you coming i think so but i might bring my wife so i don't want
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.760]  to bring her into something like that i'm i'm serious but we kind of get to a
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:13.880]  point where as a man i want to kind of say where we're going to eat but at the
[02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:17.800]  same time you know the guys i got around here you know packing that they won't
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:20.920]  like it if i do that so to a certain point you know it i don't know it's
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:23.560]  just it just we get this point where i want to invite folks out where we're
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:27.080]  going tonight but at the same time i don't want to literally give the enemy
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:30.600]  who will show up like cowards hiding behind trash cans
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:34.360]  to do and lord knows what oh definitely yeah they would definitely
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:39.160]  show up especially if you and i are there um even if it was just proud boys in
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:43.240]  general or one of your guys's you know guys out there um so you know that's
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:49.000]  your call our guys are always ready to go um anytime any day um but yeah you know
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:52.920]  i i always welcome it because it's a challenge it's a challenge to show them
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:55.960]  their weakness um but at the same time i don't want to make
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:10:59.720]  other people you know vulnerable well it's almost tempting fate and see that's
[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:03.720]  why i haven't gone to a lot of events publicly because once i get to them i
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:06.920]  feel great and i love it but then i've got a wife children i know i'm a major
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:10.120]  target uh and i've seen what they've done to so many other people and then my
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:14.120]  gut level says just hold back uh and but then you just get sick of doing that
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:18.280]  you know yeah yeah how much how much i was i was uh talking about this earlier
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:23.400]  today how how much attacks can you endure before you're less of a man
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:27.720]  you know what what what is the line for you that that tells you i need to
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:31.160]  stand up and do something and i ask people that all the time and it seems
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:34.680]  like people don't really know you know they weren't raised to have that long
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:38.040]  because we've had it so good as a rancid exactly yeah we've had it so good for so
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:41.320]  long and uh we're used to being comfortable and we don't have that line
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:44.600]  established in our life and and i'm one of those people that has had that line
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:47.720]  in a lot of uh other like-minded patriots out there that line has been
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:52.760]  crossed a long time ago and and expanding on that that's so critical
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:57.160]  that i i was ever anti-police i didn't want the left and the globalists who
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:00.040]  were trying to take police over and turn them into their political police against
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:04.040]  patriots for that to happen so the media would always misrepresent that i hated cops
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:07.560]  but then when i saw obama and the justice department trying to cause race wars we
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:10.760]  got the documents when they knew the police shootings were justified they
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:13.480]  were lying about it like the latest chicago one where the guy pulls the guy to
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:16.760]  shoot the cop the cop shoots him and they say it's racially motivated
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:19.880]  and they still have riots and i feel sad for everybody no matter what color they
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:23.640]  are it's all manipulation but that's when you pull back and you realize wait a
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:27.720]  minute they're literally on cnn when cops are getting killed
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:32.200]  by black lives matter folks budget cops got shot protecting their rally in
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:37.560]  dallas five cops killed cops got killed in louisiana couple of black cops again
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:42.520]  by other races black folks who were so brainwashed and cnn said
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:45.880]  it's about what two three years ago cnn said well the police they're do bad
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:49.560]  things so they need to clean themselves up as if a cop does something bad
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:52.680]  a thousand miles away and it's proven didn't even happen did do anything bad
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:56.200]  and then you go randomly shoot a cop pumping gas in houston or you go
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:00.280]  randomly shoot cops responding to a murder scene in louisiana
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:04.120]  where you go shoot five five cops guarding your black lives matter event
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:08.040]  uh and and you're like my god this is really an attempt at overthrow so
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:12.200]  imagine what it's like for the police and this isn't some butt-kissing event for
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:14.600]  the police i just get the whole corporate media
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:17.880]  attacking them because they want to bully them like us under their globalist
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:21.800]  control and the whole strong cities initiative run by the un
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:25.560]  where they were going to federalize and internationalize all our police you
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:29.240]  really see it and then i always thought of the cops is kind of neutral then i
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:32.680]  now realize that once the fight for america really kicked off the police are
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:36.040]  at the heart of stopping the globalist and that's another thing that really
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:39.160]  makes the establishment mad except for the few blue cities and that's what's
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:43.400]  a shame because those police departments at the top have really criminal
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:46.520]  individuals running yeah well like we've seen
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:49.480]  previously in berkeley and what we've seen recently in portland
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:54.360]  um that police presence um has been completely stood down
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:58.600]  uh dhs department homeland security they do a fantastic job but
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:02.440]  once you have to rely on um major city police like portland and
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:07.000]  and berkeley sometimes you know it's it's it's crazy to see as an american when
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:10.120]  you see the police standing down in a riot situation explosives going off
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:13.240]  a couple feet from your women and children all over the place elderly
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:17.560]  you know what do you do it's it's really hard to be in that situation when
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:19.560]  you're in a major city in america where you should be
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:23.560]  feel protected and um you know that's just where we're at right now
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:27.080]  and the media and the control left they want to get their little methods come
[02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:29.880]  back we're going to come back with congressman gage powerful video
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:33.160]  defending free speech he devastated him the ongoing hearings calling for
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:36.920]  free speech be banned with us as the poster child this is surreal
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:41.560]  rufio the minute we have left what is the profile
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:44.680]  of the average handy if i kind of see the young method type
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:48.120]  but then i kind of see the professor type in the background directing
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:51.480]  yeah well i always say they it seems like they all kind of came from the same
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:54.760]  kind of like inbred family you know they just come out of these holes you
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:58.440]  don't really know where they come from i'm sure they congregate from somewhere
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:02.120]  but uh yeah they're all these just schmiegel looking people
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:06.280]  um or their women so you know they have the women on the front line and then
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:10.680]  they have these you know sketchy looking uh cockroaches kind of
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:14.200]  you know wandering in the back with weapons and uh and there's nobody
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:18.520]  really prominent in there in there um in there uh within their
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:22.440]  stature there and it's it's very odd to say the least if you had to
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:26.280]  define them it's weakness and dishonor and what you don't want to be
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:29.560]  it's like wow they don't even know they are the literal
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:35.560]  stench of cowardice yeah yeah they're they're they're what i would

[02:20:22.600 --> 02:20:27.640]  it's alex jones
[02:20:27.640 --> 02:20:32.040]  all right rufio panman is a cool cat great patriot
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:35.480]  he's here with us learned a lot about him and i said what are the threats like
[02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:39.720]  he said well antifa obviously is doxing us they've got law enforcement help in
[02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:43.240]  these blue city areas and he just laid incredible stuff
[02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:47.160]  of attempted murder in the last week on him and the rest of the proud boys
[02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:50.840]  they're on the west coast so this war is hot
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:54.280]  just like our law enforcement sources told us months before it came out that
[02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:58.600]  they were planning all this violence that they were targeting police
[02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:02.840]  republican members of congress who are the freedom caucus
[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:06.680]  um i think a big part of this is you get this on record it makes a move i think
[02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:10.360]  you guys need to go into the fbi yeah i mean i personally have done that before
[02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:13.400]  on this stuff and the average rent fbi person rank and falls good it's the
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:17.160]  democrats on top that are bad the scum on top is as the president's pointed out
[02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:20.360]  we'll get to that in the next segment though but man that's amazing what you
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:25.320]  told me they've been doing to you guys um so
[02:21:25.320 --> 02:21:29.080]  i tell you this is a two-way streak though punks i tell you they are really
[02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:31.800]  pushing it aren't they yeah i mean you know how
[02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:35.000]  like i said what's your line you know how much are you willing to take until
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:39.400]  you go full blown uh retaliation well i don't want to say too much but i know
[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:44.680]  there's a lot of former military um and people that live right here in austin
[02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:49.000]  former still team six leaders you name it that just everything they said they
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:52.120]  were trained to do you know uh helped the oppressed
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:56.280]  you know the the uh green beret motto all of it
[02:21:56.280 --> 02:21:59.800]  they said finally we're seeing what we trained to fight in america
[02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:03.000]  and i don't know what's going on or what's happening but let me tell auntie
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:07.080]  foe auntie foe is being closely watched by just private operators and when the
[02:22:07.080 --> 02:22:09.720]  stuff kicks off they think we're flat-footed that we're not
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:14.040]  yeah well if this bill if this law comes through that the demasking law
[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:17.800]  um who knows what that'll do to antifa you know i don't i don't think they'll
[02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:21.240]  have a whole lot of confidence coming out to these things without a mask so
[02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:25.240]  it'll be interesting to see how that pans out well but let's remember these
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:28.440]  are the methods scum hired by the globalists they're just throw away
[02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:31.560]  they're the cover for the detonators these documents we have will show next
[02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:35.560]  segment show but it's only blue cities that allow this the police
[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:39.720]  are in on it it's it's been admitted and it's and a lot of the cops low level
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:42.520]  are the reason we have the documents is they don't like this
[02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:45.560]  they're they have to stand there while bottles are thrown at them and stuff is
[02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:50.360]  burned and they're told stand out yeah i've talked to multiple police officers
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:54.200]  and a lot of them are saying you know we'd love to be out there with you guys
[02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:57.320]  fighting these people but this is just what we have to do these are orders
[02:22:57.320 --> 02:23:00.360]  um and unfortunately this is how the way it goes when you're a government
[02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:03.400]  employee you know and uh you have to abide by who's
[02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:07.320]  who's on top um it's pretty sad really to say the least
[02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:10.760]  i trust the president he's smarter than i am in many ways but he
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:14.600]  thinks giving this attention and admitting that his supporters are being
[02:23:14.600 --> 02:23:18.200]  attacked gives the enemy strength i don't think so i think if he recognizes it
[02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:21.400]  like he did during the campaign that people are being attacked that shows
[02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:25.160]  they're the bad guys and it helps all of us i i disagree with the president he
[02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:28.920]  needs to have a task force against antifa and these thugs need to be exposed
[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:33.400]  and then he needs to stand up for his supporters yeah well the antifa is the
[02:23:33.400 --> 02:23:38.040]  front line to these fear tactics being used against uh people being
[02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:42.520]  you know able to openly be pro-trump you know think about when you go down into
[02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:46.200]  seattle or portland or you know a lot of places in california even here in
[02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:50.280]  texas uh wearing a maga hat is you know can be
[02:23:50.280 --> 02:23:53.480]  dangerous and so uh well tonight we'll go out on the
[02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:57.880]  street and let me tell you 99 of people are going to be supportive
[02:23:57.880 --> 02:24:00.760]  black white old young but man when you run are the ones that don't they are
[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:04.520]  rabbit yeah well they can try i don't think anything will
[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:07.320]  really happen in austin i mean it's always just some trendy that
[02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:14.200]  sneaks up now let me do this big piece congressman gates and i've
[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:18.120]  canvas congress i'll leave it at that about who wants to be free speech
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:22.360]  champion who understands the left's attack on free speech and how they're
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:26.360]  demonizing conservative libertarian pro america speech and then how they're
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:30.600]  pushing a program to end free speech and congressman gates gets it so they're
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:34.040]  having ongoing hearings in the house judiciary right now where they
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:37.320]  misrepresent what i've said diamonds and silk and others and then call for us to
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:40.680]  be banned well i'm sorry jim jordan didn't get it the
[02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:45.160]  others didn't get it and but gates did he is a smart cookie
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:49.160]  and so here's matt gates uh blast social media giants over free speech
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:52.200]  protection hypocrisy because the argument of the democrats is well it's
[02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:55.800]  your own company well but you're a medium of everybody communicating
[02:24:55.800 --> 02:24:58.840]  so you're gonna have live time computers watching what we say and then
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:00.680]  restricting it and saying it's hate speech because it's
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:05.480]  conservative uh so here is congressman gates destroying
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:09.640]  them in a big way as expired i'll now recognize myself for five minutes and
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:14.120]  i'll begin by associating myself with some of the comments from mr lu and mr
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:16.840]  raskin when they indicate that the government should not
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:20.840]  foist upon the technology community the um
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:25.240]  you know the over regulation of the government i completely agree i'll
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:29.960]  say right there this is my bad i didn't realize it's a five minute clip
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:32.600]  we're about to go to break i'm not cliffhangering here we'll come back and
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:35.720]  reintroduce it and get to it and then we'll get into the doxing and the
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:40.040]  attempted murder against you guys uh the last week or so
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:42.600]  we got a few minutes we go to break though because you've got so many points
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:45.240]  i've been guiding with discussion rufio what else you want to get into for
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:49.400]  listeners and viewers um you know uh other than what we're
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:54.520]  about to talk about uh uh we do have the up and coming
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:59.240]  rally in portland off fourth yeah that's august four tell folks about that
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:03.560]  yeah well you know obviously we're eager to get back because of
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:08.200]  the failure of the protection of the citizens that the city showed
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:11.320]  down in portland um it was a complete failure on their part and
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:14.920]  complete lack of leadership and people's lives are put at risk
[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:20.120]  and thank god that the proud boy showed up in numbers and protect those people
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:22.520]  i don't know what would have happened if we weren't there but it wouldn't have
[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:25.800]  been good and maybe we should show the police marching
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:29.800]  antifa up against the demonstration the prayer vigil let's show that footage if
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:33.480]  we can and and and then what transpired out of that because this is the
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:36.760]  first ever rally a few months ago women and children get beaten up
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:39.800]  so you guys come out you still kick their ass with the police stand down
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:43.960]  so you're saying three is the trifecta it's the charm have a really huge group
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:47.400]  come out and once and for all and antifa no this is still america
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:51.800]  yeah well it doesn't take you know if as long as there's a you know
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:56.440]  50 to 100 of us we can take on a thousand of them that's fine um but you know if
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:58.920]  you want to get involved there's no better time than now to get involved
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:02.520]  find your local chapter hit them up um we'll be we'll be in portland august
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:05.960]  fourth and again tell folks about the rally why
[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:09.320]  you're doing it again uh well we're going to see how the
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:13.240]  city reacts and we'll see if they step up their leadership and actually provide
[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:16.920]  security and for protection against these antifa thugs
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:20.760]  we're also going to you know take another stand against antifa
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:23.800]  because of their violence that they've portrayed against the people of portland
[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:27.640]  and really up and down the west coast um and for folks that don't know they're
[02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:31.720]  throwing mortars at people that you shoot in the big cannons that every
[02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:35.720]  year blow people's arms or hands off so those are explosives
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:39.160]  so they're throwing explosives at people yeah there was one that landed
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:42.040]  maybe three feet from me this was i saw good i had a
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:46.200]  uh you know i'd seen it in person and it was a homemade explosive it looked
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:49.800]  like they'd taken my fireworks apart and put together something that was more
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:54.040]  a lot more dangerous than what it originally was intended for
[02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:57.720]  well you could see stuff flying off from the explosives pieces well we had some
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:01.400]  people uh later get back with us saying that they had actually had shrapnel
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:05.400]  uh injuries uh some some women and uh one of my proud boys actually and that's
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:08.840]  part about conservatives or christians we don't grandstand it's like oh there's
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:11.960]  congressional hearings saying ban us democrats say kill me oh it's no big
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:15.160]  deal and at a certain point it's kind of good to be john wane but
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:19.320]  we've got to tell people how bad it is yeah yeah and thankfully we had a lot of
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:22.520]  people getting out there with the video because uh i don't there was no mainstream
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:26.040]  media there hardly at all so it was these you know small
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:28.520]  time people with their cell phones and their go pros and
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:32.840]  and everything and on our side doing the filming and that's the only reason why
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:36.280]  people saw what they saw otherwise i i don't think it would have been public
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:43.240]  well a a a mortar bomb for a mortar shell wrapped in nails is a atf bomb and
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:46.360]  the police see that they need to shoot the people doing it

[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:12.440]  murders on you guys and the doxing and how antifa gets government files on
[02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:16.840]  the ice and really this this this communist invasion we're looking at
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:19.560]  this attempted bullying and everything that's happening but
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:22.680]  looking at congressman gates i i mentioned this they have the shareings
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:25.560]  ongoing how should you share it the democrats are lying about what i've
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:29.000]  said lying about diamond and silk lying about trump and saying band
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:32.760]  conservatives how are you going to stop conservatives kicking leftist
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:37.480]  but politically with ideas online and facebook twitter and youtube are like
[02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:40.920]  we've already shadow banned everybody listen you effectively ban them they
[02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:42.840]  know they're banned they're gonna have court cases
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:45.960]  that's all in the news we have the censorship master plan to cut it by
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:50.200]  mike adams on info wars dot com get it get it out the folks
[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:53.880]  but thank god congressman gates knows what's going on let's go ahead and hear
[02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:58.040]  what he had to say when they claim oh we're the private corporation we can do
[02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:01.800]  whatever we want he fires big torpedoes that hit
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:05.320]  broadside as expired i'll now recognize myself for
[02:35:05.320 --> 02:35:09.000]  five minutes and i'll begin by associating myself with some of the
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.840]  comments from mr lu and mr raskin when they indicate that the government
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:16.280]  should not foist upon the technology community
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:21.880]  the um you know the over regulation of the government i completely agree
[02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:25.640]  my question is when you avail yourself to the protections
[02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:29.800]  of section 230 do you necessarily surrender some of your rights as a
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:33.640]  publisher or speaker the way i read that statute now it's pretty
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:36.120]  binary it says that you have to be one or the
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:39.800]  other you have to be a section 230 protected or you're a speaker with the
[02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:42.200]  full complement of your first amendment rights
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:46.760]  i'm cool with that i would love you guys to make the choice i come from the
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:50.760]  libertarian leaning segment of my party i just think it's confusing
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:53.960]  when you try to have it both ways when you try to say that you know we get
[02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:56.840]  these liability protections but at the same time we have the right
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:00.280]  to throttle content we have the right to designate content
[02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:04.760]  and and in the most extreme examples when you have a twitter attorney saying in
[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:07.480]  court we would we would never do this but we would
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:11.720]  have the right to ban people based on their gender or their sexual orientation
[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:14.440]  so i wanted to clear up those comments but um
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:18.120]  my question my next question is for you miss bicker um i've provided to you a
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:21.320]  screenshot i've taken from content that was published on facebook
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:25.480]  from a page that is milkshakes against the republican party
[02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:28.680]  there are two posts would you read the first one and there is one naughty word
[02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:38.680]  there that you're welcome to skip over
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:41.560]  will you read it aloud
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:49.000]  congressman this is a post milkshakes against the republican party
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:54.760]  um it has a picture and it says parents in the waiting area for today's school
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:57.960]  shooting in florida and then it says you remember
[02:36:57.960 --> 02:37:01.880]  the shooting at the republican baseball game one of those should happen every
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:05.720]  week until those n r a and then there are
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:09.640]  unpleasant words um and then there's i i'm not sure if this is
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:12.920]  another post beneath it or not yeah that's a second post we read that that
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:16.040]  has no naughty words it says dear craze shooters the
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:20.200]  gop has frequent baseball practice you really want to be remembered that's how
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:23.160]  you do it signed americans tired of our politicians
[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:26.440]  bathing in the blood of the innocent for a few million dollars from the terrorist
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:29.800]  organization n r a do these posts violate your
[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:33.560]  terms of service a call for violence violates our
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:37.080]  terms of service so why is milkshakes against the republican
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:40.280]  party a still alive page on your platform let's
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:43.960]  hit pause this is critical because there's facebook twitter and youtube
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:47.560]  things with millions of views saying kill republicans kill trump
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:51.880]  rapist children get alex jones all of this and that's the point
[02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:55.720]  is they're out calling for violence they're all allowed to have a free hand
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:59.000]  uh you know all these different talk show hosts
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  uh like he's oberman can call for violence he's got his thing up but
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:06.680]  but roger stone's band and and and that's the point here we're gonna go back
[02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:10.440]  to it rufio is that they misrepresent what we've said to ban us
[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:14.280]  but then they let the left do whatever they want yeah well just like that uh
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:17.720]  kino or keto guy the guy that took that maga hat off that kid he got full
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:20.760]  funding and all sorts of support from the left but the second you defend
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:24.680]  yourself against the left like myself you get all sorts oh yeah all sorts of
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:27.640]  flak let's show that in water burger of a few
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:30.920]  weeks ago yeah that guy became a hero go fund me
[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:34.280]  you know he said f u threw t on somebody took stole their hat
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:38.760]  he's a hero yeah assault apparently is what gets you fame and fortune in
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:42.840]  in today's day and age and uh you know defending yourself and other people is
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:46.200]  what gets you banned and uh your funding taken away so
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:48.760]  you know if that's what you want to support as a business in america go
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:52.680]  ahead and feel free but don't be surprised if you go bankrupt
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:55.960]  again i'm begging democrats these shops put
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:59.240]  a computer program for uber whatever it is if you don't want to carry me as a
[02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:02.600]  libertarian as a nationalist a white guy whatever tell me if you don't want me
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:05.240]  in your shop you don't want to bake my cake just say
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:09.880]  put a shingle on the window not welcome i believe me i don't want to give you my
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:13.560]  money yeah yeah they're they're asking people to
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:16.760]  to not give them their money it doesn't make sense at all you're you're
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:20.440]  you're segregating an entire part of the country who's willing to give you
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:22.920]  money and you're saying well we're not going to take your service and it's like
[02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:26.600]  okay well fine we'll move on to the next person the next rising power to
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:29.560]  you know support uh patriots and like minded americans
[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:32.840]  yeah this is the end of the globalist this is the end of this corrupt system
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:35.880]  there's going to be other stuff we have to face we're not offering some utopia but
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:39.480]  from the grave they are clawing us with them they
[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:42.040]  yeah they really want to and they're not dragging me into your grave
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:45.720]  idiots my victory is destroying you whatever happens in full wars that's
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:49.720]  secondary it isn't about me it's about defeating you that's my measure
[02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:55.800]  let's go back to congressman uh gates here it is
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:59.400]  can't speak i haven't reviewed this page i can't speak to why any page is up or
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:01.880]  not up um but we can certainly follow up with it
[02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:05.800]  so a member of my staff provided these comments to facebook
[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:09.720]  and we said based on our reading of your terms of service and frankly based on
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:12.600]  your testimony today where you say we are committed to
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:15.320]  removing content that encourages real world harm
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:18.760]  based on that this would be a facial violation but
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:23.160]  i received back what i've provided to you and the highlighted portion of
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:26.520]  facebook's message back to my staff includes
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:31.240]  it doesn't go against one of our specific community standards
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:36.200]  so do you see the tension between your public testimony today
[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:39.480]  your terms of service and then your conduct
[02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:45.960]  when you're presented with violent calls to shoot people who are members of my
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:49.720]  party at baseball practice
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:54.440]  congressman we there's no place for any calls for violence on facebook i will
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:57.640]  certainly follow up after the hearing and make sure that we're addressing
[02:40:57.640 --> 02:41:01.240]  um content you bring to our attention thank you yeah i mean i i brought it to
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:04.280]  your attention when i emailed it to you and then i brought it to your
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:07.880]  attention when i went to facebook with mr rackliffe we went to california we
[02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:11.720]  went to your corporate headquarters i showed these posts to your executives
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:15.560]  and the response i got from your executives is well we removed those
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:18.760]  specific posts but that we're not going to remove
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:25.960]  the entire page so i i guess if a page hosts repeated content
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:29.960]  that threatens violence and that references the shooting
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:36.040]  of republicans at a baseball game why would you not remove the page
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:39.240]  thank you congressman okay so these posts were removed but the page has not been
[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:44.120]  removed is that correct okay um so we remove pages or groups or
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:47.400]  profiles when there is a certain threshold of
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:51.720]  violations that has been met so and this depends if somebody for instance
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:55.320]  posts an image of child all right we got to come back and finish this because the
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:58.360]  democrats jump in and say why is m full war still up but but but here's the
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:00.840]  deal people mainly communicate through facebook
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:03.560]  twitter and youtube they've got all these private messengers it's like
[02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:06.280]  telephones so if the government jumps in or
[02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:11.000]  corporations jump in during your conversations with ai computers like
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:14.840]  not letting you share an emoji of the taiwanese flag because apple's owned
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:17.800]  by china now officially that is prior
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:21.160]  constraint and so we're saying hey if somebody says kill somebody send the
[02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:24.760]  cops ban them for that but don't lie about info wars
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:28.200]  and then call for us to be banned when you won't even show what we said notice
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:32.440]  gates read what they said go kill congressman
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:36.360]  we didn't say that if i said that that's not free speech that's a call to action
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:39.080]  so we come back we'll finish up with this and get into
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:43.000]  their actions against the proud boys they're on the west coast
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:46.360]  and their attempts to savage break lines you name it with

[02:51:47.480 --> 02:51:51.080]  yeah i had a question i i'm agreeing with the chairman about this and i think
[02:51:51.080 --> 02:51:54.040]  we arrived at the exact same place when we were talking about it what
[02:51:54.040 --> 02:51:58.280]  threshold does info wars have their page taken down after they
[02:51:58.280 --> 02:52:03.400]  repeatedly deny the historical reality of massacres of children in
[02:52:03.400 --> 02:52:07.880]  public schools um and so but when you follow up with it and
[02:52:07.880 --> 02:52:11.240]  obviously you want to back that up because if you just joined us i played
[02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:14.840]  the clip earlier where congressman dutch of the
[02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:20.840]  parkland area lies and says that
[02:52:21.800 --> 02:52:24.360]  yet it's right it's the last guy just i don't want to go all the way back just
[02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:26.440]  just just just right to the other congressman
[02:52:26.440 --> 02:52:30.280]  they then misrepresent and say that i said nobody died and they're all crisis
[02:52:30.280 --> 02:52:33.800]  actors i never said that youtube took my youtube down
[02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:36.280]  and then when i threatened to sue them and showed the real videos they put it
[02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:40.200]  back up they never admit all that these democrats just keep lying no matter how
[02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:44.200]  many times they publish these lies it doesn't make it true
[02:52:44.200 --> 02:52:48.120]  it's incredible so let's go back to it
[02:52:48.120 --> 02:52:51.640]  first i have a question i i'm agreeing with the chairman about this and i
[02:52:51.640 --> 02:52:54.760]  think we arrived at the exact same place when we were talking about it what
[02:52:54.760 --> 02:52:58.280]  threshold does info wars have their page taken
[02:52:58.280 --> 02:53:03.000]  down after they repeatedly deny the historical reality of massacres of
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:08.600]  children in public schools um and so but when you follow up with it and
[02:53:08.600 --> 02:53:11.640]  obviously you want to look in this specific case i would love it if you
[02:53:11.640 --> 02:53:14.680]  would follow up also about alex jones and info wars
[02:53:14.680 --> 02:53:18.200]  if certain content you're saying has been taken down
[02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:22.360]  when they are taunting the students from parkland the pause again
[02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:26.520]  never talk to the students that's the lying sick mouth of hollywood and you
[02:53:26.520 --> 02:53:30.520]  you you liar again show the video show the quote
[02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:35.000]  like gates did you can't do it you dirty murderer of the first amendment
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:38.280]  and so you want us to be taken down which i'm not afraid of by the way because
[02:53:38.280 --> 02:53:41.720]  the lawsuits are ready and you want to sit there and play those games
[02:53:41.720 --> 02:53:45.720]  and then lie about and defame me from congress about what i said while you're
[02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:48.840]  using the blood of those kids you dirtbag to try to kill the first
[02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:54.200]  amendment you are a sick freak raskin here he is taken down and i agree
[02:53:54.200 --> 02:53:57.480]  certainly that the um that these posts should be
[02:53:57.480 --> 02:54:00.040]  taken down that the chairman's talking about a yield back
[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:03.720]  i thank the gentleman and would concur with his sentiments my time
[02:54:03.720 --> 02:54:08.760]  has expired and seeing no further business before the committee
[02:54:08.760 --> 02:54:11.480]  this concludes today's hearing thank you to the distinguished witnesses for
[02:54:11.480 --> 02:54:14.600]  attending without objection all members will have five legislative days to
[02:54:14.600 --> 02:54:16.920]  submit additional written questions for the witnesses
[02:54:16.920 --> 02:54:20.440]  or additional materials for the record the hearing is adjourned
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:24.680]  so so you notice even though gates kind of gets it he doesn't fully get it he's
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:28.040]  just gonna you know play it save okay i i i agree with you raskin
[02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:31.240]  this is the front just like you were saying during a break they call you
[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:35.160]  white supremacist on the news they say go out and attack them
[02:54:35.160 --> 02:54:37.720]  and then crazy people come out and attack you when you're having a prayer
[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:40.760]  vigil it's the same crap they're doing right there
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:45.480]  yeah and people's lives are uh you know being threatened because of it people
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:47.800]  like nancy pelosi and all these senators and and
[02:54:47.800 --> 02:54:51.240]  and what you just saw there they're they're undermining the real threat
[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:55.640]  that's really going on um and they're painting people like me and
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:59.880]  other patriots like minded patriots and even yourself alex as these
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:03.240]  these terrorists that we should be worried about and people are showing up
[02:55:03.240 --> 02:55:06.840]  in flocks to come and attack us and it's just not the truth at all
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:10.680]  if anything we're there to support everybody like minded
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:13.480]  so you know we're seeing it all over the country
[02:55:13.480 --> 02:55:17.160]  um you're seeing it on your level i'm seeing it on my level
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:19.960]  so you know and their answer is well just don't go out and
[02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:24.040]  demonstrate shut up and crawl in a hole right this is a total intimidation of
[02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:27.320]  bullying at every level yeah it's an infringement of free
[02:55:27.320 --> 02:55:31.400]  speech um all across the board and then they're using fear tactics
[02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:35.720]  uh you know whatever level you're on however active you are within your
[02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:39.240]  country or however proud you are of your country they're they're finding a way to
[02:55:39.240 --> 02:55:42.520]  silence you well you remember they were always saying get rid of free speech
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:44.840]  because of bullying that's their first so now
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:48.600]  they've chosen info wars as the poster child that they misrepresent
[02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:52.760]  to end free speech folks this is important this is the big battle if they
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:55.240]  can get rid of free speech they could win
[02:55:55.240 --> 02:55:58.040]  that's why i tell our affiliates thank you and our listeners thank you and our
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:00.280]  supporters thank you and all of you because
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:05.960]  this is an epic battle and we need to flood uh congressman gates and jordan
[02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:09.800]  and on all these people with the articles and videos we wrote showing that
[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:13.080]  we were lied about and that we were hoaxed but even though we said nobody
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:16.280]  died at parkland that's all right right you know david hogs running around
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:18.920]  demonizing the second amendment and saying you know calling people names
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:23.560]  but i didn't even say that and then hog goes on tv and plays along with a lie
[02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:27.720]  because he's putting out perfect democratic party talking points
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:31.240]  doesn't mean the shooting didn't happen he's an anti-gun spokesperson
[02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:34.600]  that's a fact yeah well regardless of what you say
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:37.560]  happened or didn't happen you're talking about a past event where these people
[02:56:37.560 --> 02:56:41.320]  are calling for future violence they're encouraging future violence on things
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:44.600]  that haven't yet happened and so that's right they're trying to incite the
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:48.680]  president being overthrown and his son being kidnapped and raped by pedophiles
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:52.520]  and then they look at us and say we're bullying kids but never show the source
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:55.960]  yeah that's all they can cling on to just like calling us racist it doesn't
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:56:59.640]  make sense there's no logical behind it there's no evidence behind it but they'll
[02:56:59.640 --> 02:57:03.080]  keep cling into that narrative in hopes that people you know that have been
[02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:06.200]  brainwashed will fall along with that narrative well they don't want minorities
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:09.720]  who are the majority now in most areas to feel like america belongs to them
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:13.160]  so just like oh you don't want guns or private property or wealth that's the
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:17.160]  white people just the don't go be a conservative the nazis will get you
[02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:21.640]  yeah totally horrible to have property and guns and wealth
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:24.440]  it's unbelievable all right brother well you're gonna be back on the war room

[03:00:25.880 --> 03:00:30.680]  than the war rooms coming up then we're going to have more
[03:00:30.680 --> 03:00:33.400]  live coverage tonight with some of the proud boys here they're in town
[03:00:33.400 --> 03:00:39.080]  gab mcginnis's group like rufio panman but first i just saw trump live
[03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:42.600]  moments ago so we're going to back this up and play it
[03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:47.240]  i don't want to say capitulating but saying you know
[03:00:47.240 --> 03:00:51.160]  i say i have no question that russia did this to us
[03:00:51.160 --> 03:00:55.640]  i guess because miller says so and it just gives into this whole trap
[03:00:55.640 --> 03:00:58.840]  so like i don't want to see this as a flip-flop but they put major pressure on
[03:00:58.840 --> 03:01:03.000]  trump over this in the deep state over him daring to meet with the russian
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.960]  leader which is totally normal so here's some of what president trump just
[03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:09.240]  said
[03:01:09.240 --> 03:01:16.200]  so i'll begin by stating that i have full faith and support for america's great
[03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:22.360]  intelligence agencies always had and i have felt very strongly that while
[03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:28.280]  russia's actions had no impact at all on the outcome of the election
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:34.040]  let me be totally clear and saying that and i've said this many times i accept
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:38.280]  our intelligent community's conclusion
[03:01:38.280 --> 03:01:44.840]  that russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place
[03:01:44.840 --> 03:01:49.720]  could be other people also there's a lot of people out there
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:54.520]  there was no collusion at all and people have seen that and they've seen that
[03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:57.880]  strongly the house has already come out very strongly on that
[03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:01.720]  a lot of people have come out strongly and then i thought that i made myself
[03:02:01.720 --> 03:02:05.720]  very clear by having just reviewed the transcript
[03:02:05.720 --> 03:02:10.600]  now i have to say i came back and i said what is going on what's the big deal
[03:02:10.600 --> 03:02:14.600]  so i got a transcript i reviewed it i actually went out and
[03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:19.080]  reviewed a clip of an answer that i gave
[03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:24.680]  and i realized that there is a need for some clarification
[03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:28.360]  it should have been obvious i thought it would be obvious but i would like to
[03:02:28.360 --> 03:02:33.720]  clarify just in case it wasn't and a key sentence in my remarks
[03:02:33.720 --> 03:02:38.920]  i said the word would instead of wouldn't the sentence should have been
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:45.720]  i don't see any reason why i wouldn't or why it wouldn't be russia so
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:49.960]  just to repeat it i said the word would instead of wouldn't
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:55.000]  and the sentence should have been and i thought it would be maybe a little bit
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:59.800]  unclear on the transcript or unclear on the actual video
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:03.800]  the sentence should have been i don't see any reason why it wouldn't
[03:03:03.800 --> 03:03:11.000]  be russia sort of a double negative so you can put that in and i think that
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:14.120]  probably clarifies things pretty good by itself
[03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:18.280]  i have on numerous occasions noted our intelligence findings that
[03:03:18.280 --> 03:03:21.960]  russians attempted to interfere in our elections
[03:03:21.960 --> 03:03:26.840]  unlike previous administrations my administration has and will continue
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:31.640]  to move aggressively to repeal any efforts and repel
[03:03:31.640 --> 03:03:35.880]  we will stop it we will repel it all right let's stop right there i think this
[03:03:35.880 --> 03:03:39.320]  will be blood in the water he went he was nice we've been super tough on russia
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:42.920]  with trump too tough buying into this neocon crap
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:45.560]  and i think this is blood in the water and they're just going to go more insane
[03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:49.400]  they're saying deep stating 25th amendment him removing
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:53.080]  use the military against him these are the globalist
[03:03:53.080 --> 03:03:56.280]  that have had their boot on our neck for decades that have run the country into
[03:03:56.280 --> 03:03:59.640]  the ground come out and say you're the traders
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:03.080]  you're the globalist you're the enemy i should have met with putin a year ago i
[03:04:03.080 --> 03:04:09.240]  mean with other world leaders you people are a joke but fox news
[03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:12.200]  you know gets we have a compilation coming up at the start of the segment
[03:04:12.200 --> 03:04:15.720]  then paul takes over i'ma play fox news is like the talking
[03:04:15.720 --> 03:04:18.200]  points well he jumped the shark it's over for him
[03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:20.920]  they've been trying to get rid of trump day one the murdox
[03:04:20.920 --> 03:04:25.240]  but when they lost half their ratings because of it
[03:04:25.240 --> 03:04:29.160]  about a year ago they went back to liking trump they're all a bunch of globalist
[03:04:29.160 --> 03:04:32.760]  scum and all these other cowards and if america didn't want to return
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:35.800]  didn't want our economy back and wants to be under global stuff then hell let's
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:39.400]  get rid of trump hell let's put hillary and polosian bankrupt everything
[03:04:39.400 --> 03:04:43.240]  and be venezuela and not even have sewage or lighting and just have
[03:04:43.240 --> 03:04:47.240]  feces flowing down the streets like uh san francisco
[03:04:47.240 --> 03:04:54.120]  let's do it let's all be blue state and just slit our wrists then
[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:58.040]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[03:04:58.040 --> 03:05:01.320]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[03:05:01.320 --> 03:05:04.840]  but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be
[03:05:04.840 --> 03:05:09.640]  concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy
[03:05:09.640 --> 03:05:13.160]  metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of
[03:05:13.160 --> 03:05:17.960]  the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[03:05:17.960 --> 03:05:23.400]  for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact
[03:05:23.400 --> 03:05:27.240]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water
[03:05:27.240 --> 03:05:31.080]  next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[03:05:31.080 --> 03:05:34.600]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:05:34.600 --> 03:05:38.280]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels
[03:05:38.280 --> 03:05:43.560]  as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water
[03:05:43.560 --> 03:05:47.720]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[03:05:47.720 --> 03:05:51.000]  rain water supply but more importantly a good
[03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:55.240]  water filtration system will purify it
[03:05:58.600 --> 03:06:05.000]  the year is 1995 and info wars launches the last of america's counter
[03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:09.400]  globalist probes in a freak mishap info wars dot com
[03:06:09.400 --> 03:06:12.680]  and alex jones are blown out of their trajectory
[03:06:12.680 --> 03:06:16.520]  into an orbit which freezes his life support systems
[03:06:16.520 --> 03:06:21.160]  and returns alex jones to earth 25 years later
[03:06:21.160 --> 03:06:24.920]  trans dimensionally over the spacetime continuum through full space
[03:06:24.920 --> 03:06:29.320]  where people are extremely lazy the social engineers are there laughing
[03:06:29.320 --> 03:06:32.440]  what we envisioned a hundred years ago 20 years ago
[03:06:32.440 --> 03:06:35.880]  is now already open while the society unravels
[03:06:35.880 --> 03:06:39.320]  men run around totally frantic not knowing how to be men and women run
[03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:42.600]  around frantic not knowing how to be women and they don't understand that
[03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:46.600]  it's an animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be
[03:06:46.600 --> 03:06:51.480]  informed it's fulfilling to be involved it's fulfilling info wars
[03:06:51.480 --> 03:06:56.280]  tomorrow's news today well i could have never imagined 20
[03:06:56.280 --> 03:06:59.240]  something years ago getting on air that we'd have congressional hearing saying
[03:06:59.240 --> 03:07:02.680]  ban me off the air misrepresenting what i'm saying congressional hearing saying
[03:07:02.680 --> 03:07:08.680]  ban paul watson just a few months ago uh all congressmen saying military take
[03:07:08.680 --> 03:07:12.440]  trump out he's a russian agent when hillary was in bed with russia
[03:07:12.440 --> 03:07:15.400]  but i want to play a compilation as we hand the baton to paul watson of
[03:07:15.400 --> 03:07:19.640]  democrats and republicans throwing trump under the bus and misrepresenting
[03:07:19.640 --> 03:07:23.080]  what happened in that press conference yesterday and i gotta tell you
[03:07:23.080 --> 03:07:27.160]  i think trump coming out clarifying will be blood in the water
[03:07:27.160 --> 03:07:30.760]  i mean how dare a president meet with a russian leader
[03:07:30.760 --> 03:07:34.120]  my god and these are the same globalists selling out our sovereignty
[03:07:34.120 --> 03:07:37.720]  the same ones opening our borders and then they turn around at us the patriots
[03:07:37.720 --> 03:07:41.720]  and say to the bad guys paul watson takes over in a minute and a half but first
[03:07:41.720 --> 03:07:46.280]  here's this compilation first of all i just have to say i'm sick to my stomach
[03:07:46.280 --> 03:07:51.160]  i'm really feeling nauseous stunned gobsmack we're hearing words like i
[03:07:51.160 --> 03:07:56.200]  feel sick uh this is frightening you're such an american patriot they care so
[03:07:56.200 --> 03:07:59.480]  much genuinely stunning what is going on
[03:07:59.480 --> 03:08:04.520]  unbelievable astonishing just astonishing it is astonishing it's
[03:08:04.520 --> 03:08:08.680]  heartbreaking and it represents i think to the talking point uh in our nation's
[03:08:08.680 --> 03:08:11.720]  history it's time for americans to be out on the
[03:08:11.720 --> 03:08:14.040]  street there are people protesting the streets every
[03:08:14.040 --> 03:08:17.400]  day in the 70s why is that not gonna make an american
[03:08:17.400 --> 03:08:20.200]  right again he's a russian shadow government come out and say
[03:08:20.200 --> 03:08:24.040]  we cannot side with the government as an american citizen i i just
[03:08:24.040 --> 03:08:27.160]  personally think today is just an incredibly depressing
[03:08:27.160 --> 03:08:30.840]  uh moment oh my gosh it's so horrible as an american

[03:08:41.080 --> 03:08:46.040]  anti-american guy the free world ahead he didn't even meet his own low bar for
[03:08:46.040 --> 03:08:50.680]  not screwing this up i mean it is an absolute disgrace it's a parody of the
[03:08:50.680 --> 03:08:54.200]  disgrace this entire week of president trump abroad has made hillary clinton
[03:08:54.200 --> 03:08:57.240]  seem uh all the more oppression oh he's such a
[03:08:57.240 --> 03:08:59.800]  angel put on jammies and crawl under the covers with
[03:08:59.800 --> 03:09:03.560]  latin america and he couldn't do that the white house officials
[03:09:03.560 --> 03:09:08.680]  realize how horrifying so many americans are today mr putin now

[03:09:24.040 --> 03:09:28.120]  paul joseph watson taken over from london england paul
[03:09:28.120 --> 03:09:32.520]  thanks alex yeah just an illustration of the uh the sheer level of history on
[03:09:32.520 --> 03:09:37.000]  x and hyperbole with this russian neo mccarthyism today
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:40.600]  there was a there was a writer for mike.com which is a big left-wing website
[03:09:40.600 --> 03:09:44.920]  headline fake news mike's emily singer detects alleged russian spy in the oval
[03:09:44.920 --> 03:09:50.440]  office literally she had a fever dream that there was a russian spy lurking in
[03:09:50.440 --> 03:09:53.800]  the background of an official white house photograph
[03:09:53.800 --> 03:09:57.720]  from the oval office and of course she got it completely wrong
[03:09:57.720 --> 03:10:01.000]  this is an illustration of the atmosphere that creates these kind of
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:05.160]  fever dreams amidst this russian collusion delusion
[03:10:05.160 --> 03:10:08.840]  there's emily singer a senior political reporter for mike.com
[03:10:08.840 --> 03:10:13.080]  set off a mini red scare tuesday morning by suggesting a white house staffer
[03:10:13.080 --> 03:10:16.360]  pictured in the oval office was actually an alleged russian spy
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:20.120]  then scrubbed the quickly debunked claim from her verified twitter
[03:10:20.120 --> 03:10:23.080]  account so this was actually a picture from
[03:10:23.080 --> 03:10:28.680]  may 10th 2017 wasn't even a new picture over a year old
[03:10:28.680 --> 03:10:32.600]  showing then ambassador to the u.s. surgey kizlyak and foreign minister surgey
[03:10:32.600 --> 03:10:35.240]  labrov seen in a new york times story covering that
[03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:41.080]  meeting and zeroed in on a red-headed woman in the door of the oval office
[03:10:41.080 --> 03:10:45.080]  she went she said on twitter i thought this was a photo shot but it's not this
[03:10:45.080 --> 03:10:48.760]  is maria batina arrested for being a russian spy
[03:10:48.760 --> 03:10:53.240]  in the oval office with trump she's literally going back over a year
[03:10:53.240 --> 03:10:56.760]  to white house photographs from a meeting that occurred over a year ago
[03:10:56.760 --> 03:11:00.680]  and having fever dreams about russian spies in the oval office
[03:11:00.680 --> 03:11:04.920]  tweeting it she attached the to attach the photo to the tweet
[03:11:04.920 --> 03:11:09.400]  but she soon expressed doubt over whether she correctly identified batina in
[03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:12.760]  the photo conceding that it may be curry lukkin the
[03:11:12.760 --> 03:11:15.320]  member of the white house national security council
[03:11:15.320 --> 03:11:19.000]  i may delete a sweet thing it told her 20 000 twitter
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:23.160]  followers i don't no doubt this was shared feverishly around the blue check
[03:11:23.160 --> 03:11:25.960]  marks on twitter before she did delete it
[03:11:25.960 --> 03:11:29.880]  lacklin marquette of the far left daily b said that former ys staffer also
[03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:33.400]  suggested the picture showed lukkins saying her all includes
[03:11:33.400 --> 03:11:39.080]  logistics for events like labros visit so she then deleted the tweet
[03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:42.120]  tweeting i've deleted the tweet i cannot confirm that it's batina
[03:11:42.120 --> 03:11:46.200]  and maybe an nsc staffer so even with the
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:50.600]  correction when she deleted the tweet oh it's we we can't confirm this no
[03:11:50.600 --> 03:11:56.760]  it's a white house staffer in a year plus old photo from the oval office
[03:11:56.760 --> 03:12:00.760]  and she comes out and tweets oh we we can't confirm it maybe maybe is a russian
[03:12:00.760 --> 03:12:03.960]  spy but paul that's just like them saying that he took the bust of martin
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:07.720]  lizard king out or didn't visit scolese they know it's a lie they know it's a
[03:12:07.720 --> 03:12:11.240]  fraud meanwhile they're the globalists that hate america and hate nation
[03:12:11.240 --> 03:12:14.040]  states and hate riggs it and are the ones trying to
[03:12:14.040 --> 03:12:17.880]  take us over for foreign powers and then trumps clearly
[03:12:17.880 --> 03:12:21.880]  is trying to restore america this is so crystal clear why do you think
[03:12:21.880 --> 03:12:25.240]  she came out and clarified and you know said oh yeah you know i believe the
[03:12:25.240 --> 03:12:28.520]  russians were involved in the election it's just it's i don't know why he's
[03:12:28.520 --> 03:12:34.920]  giving into the hysteria even a fox news fox news a year ago was against him
[03:12:34.920 --> 03:12:38.760]  well the fact is that you know 77 percent of the american public
[03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:43.240]  believe that mainstream news stations put out on a regular basis fake news
[03:12:43.240 --> 03:12:48.200]  so why he would be shocked at returning from this meeting in helsinki to see
[03:12:48.200 --> 03:12:52.440]  that um media outlets that have given him what 90 plus percent negative
[03:12:52.440 --> 03:12:55.960]  coverage for the past 18 months would be giving him more negative
[03:12:55.960 --> 03:12:59.400]  coverage um it's it's very confusing indeed the
[03:12:59.400 --> 03:13:02.760]  outrage machine is in full till every single day from these
[03:13:02.760 --> 03:13:06.040]  networks so why he was surprised by this
[03:13:06.040 --> 03:13:09.240]  you know remains a mystery maybe it's some people from within
[03:13:09.240 --> 03:13:12.040]  oh i'm gonna get out of here let you take over you're in a great job but
[03:13:12.040 --> 03:13:16.680]  it's crystal clear big multinational own media that's been screwing america is
[03:13:16.680 --> 03:13:19.880]  pissed the country's back and we have a real president they're the enemy
[03:13:19.880 --> 03:13:23.720]  they're on the chai comp payroll game over it's so obvious how long does this
[03:13:23.720 --> 03:13:27.640]  go on i mean it's very simple why should we
[03:13:27.640 --> 03:13:31.400]  trust the deep state this is not america this is they are the enemy they're not
[03:13:31.400 --> 03:13:35.080]  america when trump goes against the deep state he's going against the deep state
[03:13:35.080 --> 03:13:39.320]  he's not going against true americana they lied about everything else they've
[03:13:39.320 --> 03:13:42.840]  meddled in all these foreign governments for years down the line
[03:13:42.840 --> 03:13:45.960]  you know they've caused things like the rise of isis they've caused things like
[03:13:45.960 --> 03:13:50.760]  the migrant crisis as a direct consequence of meddling in the affairs
[03:13:50.760 --> 03:13:54.120]  of foreign countries that is the deep state that is their
[03:13:54.120 --> 03:13:57.240]  speciality so now trump gets blamed for that it's
[03:13:57.240 --> 03:14:01.640]  absolutely incredible you've got people on msnbc saying
[03:14:01.640 --> 03:14:06.840]  this is like crystal nacked this is the equivalent of pearl harbor attack
[03:14:06.840 --> 03:14:12.440]  absolute feverish hyperbole and histrionics every single time
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:16.440]  we had you know obama meeting with medvedev years ago saying oh you know
[03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:20.680]  i've got more leeway after the election he tried to press the reset button with
[03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:25.000]  russia he met medvedev he met putin so did hillary clinton
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:28.440]  there was nothing like the neo mccarthyism we're seeing now and again it's
[03:14:28.440 --> 03:14:32.200]  because they've been discredited now they're freaking out about how much
[03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:36.200]  they've been discredited which leads us to the to the congressional hearing
[03:14:36.200 --> 03:14:41.400]  today which you've obviously talked about directly insinuating
[03:14:41.400 --> 03:14:45.560]  the info wars should be banned not just insinuating it lobbying
[03:14:45.560 --> 03:14:51.240]  we saw last week oliver darcy cnn senior media reporter directly lobbying
[03:14:51.240 --> 03:14:55.720]  facebook on three separate occasions to ban info wars
[03:14:55.720 --> 03:15:00.120]  trying to silence independent voices to strangle their competition
[03:15:00.120 --> 03:15:04.280]  which gets back to what we pushed yesterday with this massive report that
[03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:07.080]  people need to get out about social media censorship
[03:15:07.080 --> 03:15:11.320]  because if if this is allowed to pass without complaint without a digital
[03:15:11.320 --> 03:15:14.680]  rights act an online digital rights act being passed
[03:15:14.680 --> 03:15:18.440]  to make it a level playing field then they're going to win them in terms they're
[03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:23.240]  going to win 2020 because they've rigged the game people need to understand
[03:15:23.240 --> 03:15:26.680]  how serious this is and how much they need to pressure lawmakers
[03:15:26.680 --> 03:15:30.520]  to make this a level playing field now we've got cnn i'll get into this after
[03:15:30.520 --> 03:15:34.040]  the break saying that the walk away movement
[03:15:34.040 --> 03:15:39.400]  is being led by russian bots literally everything that challenges their narrative
[03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:43.000]  is being led by russian bots the feverishness knows
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:53.400]  no bounds this is the alex germshaw live fourth hour info wars dot com will be back

[03:20:34.280 --> 03:20:38.600]  info wars to be censored on social media yeah that wasn't the idea
[03:20:38.600 --> 03:20:42.200]  the idea was to address the problem of social media censorship

[03:22:27.160 --> 03:22:33.560]  at info wars store dot com now getting back to what we're talking about before
[03:22:33.560 --> 03:22:37.000]  the big tech censorship issue which of course we released the big report
[03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:40.680]  yesterday by uh Mike Adams in coordination with Mike Adams
[03:22:40.680 --> 03:22:45.720]  the censorship master plan decoded which everybody needs to get and share
[03:22:45.720 --> 03:22:49.480]  right now that you see a copy of it on screen
[03:22:49.480 --> 03:22:52.760]  now i did a report about this as well which is headlined
[03:22:52.760 --> 03:22:56.520]  emergency big techs plot to kill free speech revealed
[03:22:56.520 --> 03:23:00.280]  in this article i talk about how we're all slaves to the algorithm
[03:23:00.280 --> 03:23:03.720]  this is one of the biggest issues if not the biggest issue it's certainly the
[03:23:03.720 --> 03:23:07.240]  biggest uh tech free speech issue for me
[03:23:07.240 --> 03:23:11.640]  and it will be for the foreseeable future now i'm going to read this because
[03:23:11.640 --> 03:23:15.000]  this is the key part of the article which most people don't really seem to
[03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:19.560]  understand how important it is says algorithms are the most
[03:23:19.560 --> 03:23:21.880]  pernicious form of censorship because the target cannot
[03:23:21.880 --> 03:23:25.080]  conclusively prove they're being censored yet experience the impact of
[03:23:25.080 --> 03:23:28.440]  censorship anyway i've mentioned it before
[03:23:28.440 --> 03:23:32.600]  okay i will search for articles i've written for info wars
[03:23:32.600 --> 03:23:36.280]  when i'm writing a new article about a similar topic
[03:23:36.280 --> 03:23:39.960]  so say it's about migrant crime in sweden or something like that
[03:23:39.960 --> 03:23:43.880]  i will remember almost word for word the headline of a previous article that i
[03:23:43.880 --> 03:23:49.000]  written for info wars google search it on google.com
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:51.800]  and what are the top results top results should be
[03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:56.040]  that article if i'm putting in the exact search terms
[03:23:56.040 --> 03:23:59.640]  that should come up with the article that i'm looking for what does it come up
[03:23:59.640 --> 03:24:02.840]  with it comes up with snopes.com it comes up
[03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:06.280]  with washington post it comes up with articles attacking
[03:24:06.280 --> 03:24:10.200]  alex jones which have nothing whatsoever to do with the search terms
[03:24:10.200 --> 03:24:15.560]  that i put into the search but simply because i put info wars in the search
[03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:19.560]  or because i put my own name in the search what goes to the top
[03:24:19.560 --> 03:24:23.560]  articles attacking us every single time so they're subverting
[03:24:23.560 --> 03:24:27.640]  their undermining the infrastructure the architecture of their own
[03:24:27.640 --> 03:24:33.080]  search engine simply to smear to demean to denigrate info wars.com and
[03:24:33.080 --> 03:24:36.920]  prevent people getting access to that information they're willing to sabotage
[03:24:36.920 --> 03:24:41.400]  that the very essence of what google.com is supposed to be about
[03:24:41.400 --> 03:24:47.400]  simply to sabotage us simply to reign in our reach basically
[03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:50.680]  and why are they doing this well as robert eppstein has documented and you
[03:24:50.680 --> 03:24:55.080]  can link through to the study in this article google search algorithm can
[03:24:55.080 --> 03:24:59.080]  easily shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by twenty percent
[03:24:59.080 --> 03:25:02.360]  or up to eighty percent in some demographic groups
[03:25:02.360 --> 03:25:05.240]  with virtually no one knowing they're being manipulated
[03:25:05.240 --> 03:25:08.760]  now they tested this in big elections and found that
[03:25:08.760 --> 03:25:12.600]  if you put certain positive search results about a political candidate
[03:25:12.600 --> 03:25:17.880]  above the other so you you search for two different political candidates you
[03:25:17.880 --> 03:25:22.040]  make sure the positive or the negative ranks in the one or two
[03:25:22.040 --> 03:25:26.920]  search result on google it can shift millions of votes literally millions
[03:25:26.920 --> 03:25:29.400]  of votes this article explains it and you can link
[03:25:29.400 --> 03:25:32.440]  through to it from my article iro yesterday
[03:25:32.440 --> 03:25:37.080]  now eppstein asserts google has the power to flip over 25 percent of elections
[03:25:37.080 --> 03:25:39.720]  worldwide and that the search giant algorithms
[03:25:39.720 --> 03:25:43.000]  are manipulating people every minute of every day
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:47.240]  that's his quote the manipulating people every minute of every day
[03:25:47.240 --> 03:25:51.000]  simply through the algorithm simply through deciding what search result
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:55.000]  appears where page one page two or number one or number two in the search
[03:25:55.000 --> 03:25:58.920]  terms because that is a hotspot that is that can they use that to
[03:25:58.920 --> 03:26:03.240]  manipulate people it's been proven by favouring certain search results over
[03:26:03.240 --> 03:26:06.360]  others eppstein and his team discovered that google could
[03:26:06.360 --> 03:26:09.880]  well boost the proportion of people who favoured any candidate
[03:26:09.880 --> 03:26:13.800]  by between 37 and 63 percent after just one
[03:26:13.800 --> 03:26:19.160]  search session this is absolutely huge they're literally deciding the results
[03:26:19.160 --> 03:26:23.800]  of the elections based on which search result appears where
[03:26:23.800 --> 03:26:27.480]  this is a quote from eppstein from this article
[03:26:27.480 --> 03:26:31.800]  more alarmingly we also demonstrated this shift with real voters
[03:26:31.800 --> 03:26:36.040]  during an actual electoral campaign in an experiment conducted with more than
[03:26:36.040 --> 03:26:40.760]  2000 eligible undecided voters throughout india during their 2014
[03:26:40.760 --> 03:26:43.720]  election now this was the largest democratic
[03:26:43.720 --> 03:26:47.640]  collection in history they had more than 800 million
[03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:52.440]  eligible voters and 480 million votes ultimately ultimately cast
[03:26:52.440 --> 03:26:56.120]  says even here with real voters who are highly familiar with the candidates
[03:26:56.120 --> 03:26:58.920]  and who are being bombarded with campaign rhetoric every day
[03:26:58.920 --> 03:27:02.600]  we show that search rankings could boost the proportion of people favouring
[03:27:02.600 --> 03:27:06.280]  any candidate by more than 20 percent and more than 60 percent in some
[03:27:06.280 --> 03:27:09.560]  demographic groups in other words it's entirely
[03:27:09.560 --> 03:27:13.480]  possible that google determined the winner of the largest democratic
[03:27:13.480 --> 03:27:18.760]  election in history and could do so over and over again
[03:27:18.760 --> 03:27:21.720]  they can literally shift the votes of millions of people
[03:27:21.720 --> 03:27:26.280]  on election day now they didn't do it to the extent that they would have hoped
[03:27:26.280 --> 03:27:29.720]  to have during the 2016 presidential election
[03:27:29.720 --> 03:27:32.680]  which is why everybody freaked out in the aftermath
[03:27:32.680 --> 03:27:36.600]  and created this phony narrative about fake news
[03:27:36.600 --> 03:27:41.240]  now there are fake news websites do they have anything like the reach
[03:27:41.240 --> 03:27:46.120]  to reach the level of hysteria spoken about them by the mainstream media no
[03:27:46.120 --> 03:27:49.640]  and in fact there's a Stanford University study which proved that
[03:27:49.640 --> 03:27:54.040]  this was a fake narrative created in the aftermath of the election much like the
[03:27:54.040 --> 03:27:57.560]  post-truth world narrative was created after the election
[03:27:57.560 --> 03:28:00.680]  because they were absolutely flabbergasted and shocked
[03:28:00.680 --> 03:28:05.480]  that they let this happen they ain't gonna let it happen again
[03:28:05.480 --> 03:28:09.400]  which is why we need to fight back with this online digital rights act

[03:33:15.160 --> 03:33:20.680]  and now your host paul joseph watson
[03:33:20.680 --> 03:33:23.720]  we're back in the fourth hour of the alex jones show we're gonna get into
[03:33:23.720 --> 03:33:26.920]  some more news here in a second but again we're in the constant attack
[03:33:26.920 --> 03:33:30.040]  you've seen cnn lobbying to shut down our youtube channel you've seen them
[03:33:30.040 --> 03:33:34.280]  lobbying to shut down our facebook channel you've seen democratic lawmakers
[03:33:34.280 --> 03:33:38.840]  back in november last year when they tried to get twitter they pressured twitter to
[03:33:38.840 --> 03:33:42.760]  shut us down and twitter agreed they said this is not going to happen again
[03:33:42.760 --> 03:33:46.680]  you remember that it was after the terrorist attack in new york on
[03:33:46.680 --> 03:33:51.080]  october 31st halloween basically the story was
[03:33:51.080 --> 03:33:57.160]  imam tawhidi who is on twitter and muslim imam said that he warned mayor
[03:33:57.160 --> 03:34:02.120]  bill de blasio of new york that there was radicalization taking place in mosques
[03:34:02.120 --> 03:34:06.120]  in new york it was a real story he posted the letter
[03:34:06.120 --> 03:34:09.080]  that he sent to the blasio warning him about this
[03:34:09.080 --> 03:34:13.480]  massive problem i wrote an article about it for him for wars dot com
[03:34:13.480 --> 03:34:17.080]  tweeted it out with the hashtag that was trending at the time for the
[03:34:17.080 --> 03:34:21.720]  new york attack it was a real story it wasn't fake news
[03:34:21.720 --> 03:34:25.560]  yes there was an imam that warned mayor bill de blasio about radicalization in
[03:34:25.560 --> 03:34:29.400]  mosques in new york whether you think he should have reacted to that in
[03:34:29.400 --> 03:34:32.600]  whatever way doesn't matter it was a real story
[03:34:32.600 --> 03:34:35.800]  how did they react there you see the story right there
[03:34:35.800 --> 03:34:39.080]  well a democratic congressman raised it during a hearing in
[03:34:39.080 --> 03:34:42.680]  in committee and basically said to a twitter executive
[03:34:42.680 --> 03:34:46.760]  how on earth has this got to the top of twitter's trending hashtag
[03:34:46.760 --> 03:34:50.600]  because at least for a few hours if you clicked on the trending hashtag
[03:34:50.600 --> 03:34:54.680]  a link to that story appeared at the top of the hashtag
[03:34:54.680 --> 03:34:58.600]  they weren't best pleased about that so this democratic
[03:34:58.600 --> 03:35:02.760]  lawmaker basically pressured the twitter executive into making a promise that
[03:35:02.760 --> 03:35:05.160]  that wouldn't happen again fast forward again to
[03:35:05.160 --> 03:35:08.760]  today where we have another democratic congressman
[03:35:08.760 --> 03:35:12.280]  you can see the headline up on info wars dot com
[03:35:12.280 --> 03:35:16.920]  dem congressman pressures facebook to ban info wars during live hearing
[03:35:16.920 --> 03:35:21.560]  this was a ted deutch and he basically said no you're not going to be able to
[03:35:21.560 --> 03:35:25.320]  challenge a major news narratives when a breaking news event happens that
[03:35:25.320 --> 03:35:27.880]  shouldn't be allowed how many strikes is it going to take
[03:35:27.880 --> 03:35:31.400]  to take info wars down first he asked youtube then he asked
[03:35:31.400 --> 03:35:36.440]  facebook basically the same question this is after cnn's media
[03:35:36.440 --> 03:35:39.240]  report a senior media reporter oliver darsi who has an
[03:35:39.240 --> 03:35:42.680]  absolute obsession with getting info wars banned by the way
[03:35:42.680 --> 03:35:47.080]  this is a self-proclaimed conservative somebody who should believe in free
[03:35:47.080 --> 03:35:50.760]  speech in the first amendment he worked for conservative media in the past now
[03:35:50.760 --> 03:35:53.400]  he's gone to cnn i don't know whether they're
[03:35:53.400 --> 03:35:57.240]  you know paying him to do this whether they're giving them him the instructions
[03:35:57.240 --> 03:36:00.760]  to go out and do this or whether it's his own choice to do this
[03:36:00.760 --> 03:36:04.280]  but this guy's leading a campaign a lobbying campaign
[03:36:04.280 --> 03:36:08.200]  he did it back in february with youtube repeated attempts
[03:36:08.200 --> 03:36:13.240]  to contact youtube to shame youtube into shutting down the alex jones channel
[03:36:13.240 --> 03:36:16.920]  then again last week repeated attempts to contact facebook
[03:36:16.920 --> 03:36:20.440]  not only face to face but afterwards as well when they had a get together
[03:36:20.440 --> 03:36:24.920]  to try to pressure facebook to ban info wars they failed with the youtube ban
[03:36:24.920 --> 03:36:27.880]  we were one strike away from the channel being deleted
[03:36:27.880 --> 03:36:31.880]  so far they've failed with the facebook ban it's still live as of
[03:36:31.880 --> 03:36:35.720]  right now there you see his tweet from last week
[03:36:35.720 --> 03:36:39.160]  literally this is a guy who would have supported but burnings
[03:36:39.160 --> 03:36:42.280]  they moan all day about russia well what does russia do
[03:36:42.280 --> 03:36:45.880]  they shut down media outlets what does turkey do
[03:36:45.880 --> 03:36:48.680]  they shut down media outlets the islamist dictator
[03:36:48.680 --> 03:36:52.920]  erdogan has shut down over 100 media outlets in turkey
[03:36:52.920 --> 03:36:58.920]  since late 2016 by decree this is what authoritarians do
[03:36:58.920 --> 03:37:02.760]  this is what dictators do but apparently cnn thinks that that's
[03:37:02.760 --> 03:37:07.400]  its role in the united states of america they bang on about donald trump
[03:37:07.400 --> 03:37:11.160]  you know democracy dies in darkness they park on about him
[03:37:11.160 --> 03:37:15.400]  attacking the media threatening the first amendment threatening the
[03:37:15.400 --> 03:37:19.240]  freedom of the press constantly yet this is a guy a senior media
[03:37:19.240 --> 03:37:23.240]  reporter who's on a campaign to shut down a smaller
[03:37:23.240 --> 03:37:27.480]  independent media outlet think of that for a second
[03:37:27.480 --> 03:37:31.480]  cnn's vast resources their international acclaim
[03:37:31.480 --> 03:37:35.320]  devoted to shutting down info wars dot com this isn't news
[03:37:35.320 --> 03:37:39.800]  this is a lobbying effort they're directly contacting youtube and facebook
[03:37:39.800 --> 03:37:43.080]  and trying to shame them trying to pressure them with
[03:37:43.080 --> 03:37:46.360]  again the threat of more negative media coverage
[03:37:46.360 --> 03:37:50.920]  into shutting down info wars dot com now it's percolated once again down to the
[03:37:50.920 --> 03:37:54.920]  congressional level where literally they they're up on their
[03:37:54.920 --> 03:37:58.120]  demanding during a social media censorship hearing which should be
[03:37:58.120 --> 03:38:01.800]  about how to stop social media censorship how to return things to a
[03:38:01.800 --> 03:38:05.000]  level playing field they're doing the exact opposite
[03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:09.480]  after facebook already admitted that they downrank
[03:38:09.480 --> 03:38:13.240]  info wars content i mean how we're still getting through i don't know
[03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:17.480]  because i'm so on some stories i could still get 50 000 facebook shares there
[03:38:17.480 --> 03:38:20.040]  was a one a couple of weeks ago about 10 days ago
[03:38:20.040 --> 03:38:23.880]  that's still got 50 000 facebook shares so i guess that's not going to happen in
[03:38:23.880 --> 03:38:28.120]  future either they are deathly afraid of a level
[03:38:28.120 --> 03:38:32.680]  playing field because 2016 proved that when it was that to some extent
[03:38:32.680 --> 03:38:37.640]  not to completely they lose they lose that's why we're all slaves to the
[03:38:37.640 --> 03:38:40.200]  algorithm that's why this is a massive issue
[03:38:40.200 --> 03:38:43.640]  and that's why we need your support by getting the products out info wars
[03:38:43.640 --> 03:38:48.120]  store.com because again we're not dependent on sponsors that can be
[03:38:48.120 --> 03:38:51.960]  boycotted we're not dependent on fat checks from george soros
[03:38:51.960 --> 03:38:55.480]  we're not dependent like cnn is on fat checks from
[03:38:55.480 --> 03:39:00.200]  gulf state dictatorships like Bahrain that kill protesters
[03:39:00.200 --> 03:39:04.200]  and then they pay cnn to make puff pieces about how great their country is
[03:39:04.200 --> 03:39:08.440]  no we don't take the money from islamist dictators like you see at cnn
[03:39:08.440 --> 03:39:10.840]  we only take money from our loyal audience
[03:39:10.840 --> 03:39:15.080]  who have the choice even though all our content is completely free

[03:39:47.640 --> 03:39:51.800]  and it's really needed now more than ever your support
[03:39:51.800 --> 03:39:55.800]  given this trifecta of attacks from all different angles
[03:39:55.800 --> 03:40:00.600]  on a merely our ability to have a voice on the internet whatsoever because we've
[03:40:00.600 --> 03:40:03.560]  all been pressured we've all been pushed into these social
[03:40:03.560 --> 03:40:07.000]  media ghettos you can't be in the debate if you're not on the field
[03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:11.000]  of the debate so we had to go there now they're trying to shut us down so we
[03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:15.880]  appreciate your support. Now going back to this absolute hysteria
[03:40:15.880 --> 03:40:20.360]  you've got a headline here Jill Wine Banks this is an MSNBC contributor
[03:40:20.360 --> 03:40:24.040]  she said Trump's performance his performance he met with the leader of
[03:40:24.040 --> 03:40:27.560]  Russia oh my god shock horror just like Obama
[03:40:27.560 --> 03:40:30.920]  did just like Hillary Clinton did Trump's performance will live in him for me
[03:40:30.920 --> 03:40:35.000]  as much as the Pearl Harbor attack or crystal net.
[03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:40.120]  She's actually claiming that what Trump did or what he said to Putin yesterday
[03:40:40.120 --> 03:40:43.480]  during that press conference will live in him for me will have the same
[03:40:43.480 --> 03:40:49.320]  historical import as two of the biggest events of the 20th century
[03:40:49.320 --> 03:40:52.680]  if not the biggest in the case of Pearl Harbor.
[03:40:52.680 --> 03:40:57.080]  Now that's how you know how the weapons grade insanity
[03:40:57.080 --> 03:41:03.400]  this feverish hysteria is hyperbole. When it gets to that level even Trump's
[03:41:03.400 --> 03:41:08.760]  most ardent critic cannot say that this isn't complete
[03:41:08.760 --> 03:41:13.960]  derangement it's Trump derangement syndrome. She said quote
[03:41:13.960 --> 03:41:17.960]  we were burglarized this time by foreign agents and it's just as serious to me as
[03:41:17.960 --> 03:41:21.880]  the Cuban missile crisis. I mean let's just hold it right there
[03:41:21.880 --> 03:41:26.440]  the Cuban missile crisis which basically almost said about the onset of
[03:41:26.440 --> 03:41:31.080]  apocalypse of the planet we were on the verge of absolute
[03:41:31.080 --> 03:41:35.240]  disaster she's comparing Trump saying a few
[03:41:35.240 --> 03:41:39.560]  you know little toast things about Putin to that.
[03:41:39.560 --> 03:41:42.760]  You cannot deny that that is complete derangement you cannot
[03:41:42.760 --> 03:41:46.200]  deny even Trump's most ardent critics cannot deny that.
[03:41:46.200 --> 03:41:52.200]  He goes on to compare it to 9-11 3000 people dead the world change
[03:41:52.200 --> 03:41:56.440]  two wars the migrant crisis can be traced back to 9-11
[03:41:56.440 --> 03:42:00.680]  ISIS can be traced back to 9-11 she's comparing what Trump said in a press
[03:42:00.680 --> 03:42:04.840]  conference to that absolute complete feverish
[03:42:04.840 --> 03:42:07.880]  derangement these people should not be given platforms
[03:42:07.880 --> 03:42:11.480]  because they're obviously insane this is like people who claim that
[03:42:11.480 --> 03:42:15.080]  Barack Obama was a secret muslim you know sent to
[03:42:15.080 --> 03:42:18.280]  sent to subvert and infiltrate and take over America.
[03:42:18.280 --> 03:42:23.160]  We criticize Barack Obama a lot of people did but the sheer level of hysteria
[03:42:23.160 --> 03:42:27.400]  with this neo-mccarthyism compared to what we had on the right
[03:42:27.400 --> 03:42:30.680]  we had a little bit of that during the obama years you know he's a secret
[03:42:30.680 --> 03:42:34.840]  muslim sent to take over but that wasn't legitimized
[03:42:34.840 --> 03:42:39.080]  that wasn't embraced by the mainstream everything that they say
[03:42:39.080 --> 03:42:42.840]  about this russian derangement trump derangement syndrome is embraced by the
[03:42:42.840 --> 03:42:46.040]  mainstream is legitimized by the mainstream that
[03:42:46.040 --> 03:42:50.360]  is what makes it a whole lot worse we'll be back on the fourth hour of the Alex
[03:42:50.360 --> 03:42:54.520]  Jones show live info wars.com don't go away. Living in volcano
[03:42:54.520 --> 03:42:59.000]  may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in
[03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:02.360]  Lailania states but a lot of us on the big island rely on
[03:43:02.360 --> 03:43:06.680]  rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:43:06.680 --> 03:43:10.120]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[03:43:10.120 --> 03:43:14.040]  and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels
[03:43:14.040 --> 03:43:18.280]  to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[03:43:18.280 --> 03:43:22.360]  alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[03:43:22.360 --> 03:43:26.280]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[03:43:26.280 --> 03:43:30.120]  next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[03:43:30.120 --> 03:43:33.640]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:43:33.640 --> 03:43:37.320]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[03:43:37.320 --> 03:43:42.600]  as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[03:43:42.600 --> 03:43:46.760]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[03:43:46.760 --> 03:43:50.360]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water
[03:43:50.360 --> 03:43:55.800]  filtration system will purify it info wars life and info wars life.com

[03:47:07.160 --> 03:47:11.000]  live from the info wars dot com studios
[03:47:11.000 --> 03:47:14.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now
[03:47:14.920 --> 03:47:20.040]  your host paul joseph watson
[03:47:20.040 --> 03:47:24.280]  you're back in the final segment of the fourth hour of the alex jones show got
[03:47:24.280 --> 03:47:27.960]  this clip from barack obama from his speech today coming up here in a second
[03:47:27.960 --> 03:47:33.320]  where he basically assumes identity politics and says god forbid
[03:47:33.320 --> 03:47:37.240]  if a man is white if you have a white man making a statement making an
[03:47:37.240 --> 03:47:41.480]  argument about a political subject you shouldn't discount what he's saying
[03:47:41.480 --> 03:47:45.160]  based on his sexuality or his skin color
[03:47:45.160 --> 03:47:49.560]  oh my gideon even though we've got a democratic party which is moving
[03:47:49.560 --> 03:47:53.480]  further and further towards the deranged left embracing
[03:47:53.480 --> 03:47:57.000]  its radical fringe extremists like antifa
[03:47:57.000 --> 03:48:02.600]  embracing people like uh akosio carcortes with all her inane drivel
[03:48:02.600 --> 03:48:07.560]  this was quite the event for him to admit that identity politics should be
[03:48:07.560 --> 03:48:11.480]  distanced from should be assured this is a big event let's go to this clip right
[03:48:11.480 --> 03:48:15.640]  now barack obama basically saying that you should listen
[03:48:15.640 --> 03:48:19.480]  to white men absolutely incredible here it is
[03:48:19.480 --> 03:48:25.480]  but democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people
[03:48:25.480 --> 03:48:29.080]  who are different than us so we can understand their point of view
[03:48:29.080 --> 03:48:35.480]  maybe we can change their minds but maybe they'll change ours
[03:48:35.480 --> 03:48:39.240]  and you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have
[03:48:39.240 --> 03:48:42.200]  to say from the start
[03:48:42.360 --> 03:48:47.320]  and you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you
[03:48:47.320 --> 03:48:51.400]  because they're white or because they're male that somehow
[03:48:51.400 --> 03:48:55.080]  there's no way they can understand what i'm feeling
[03:48:55.080 --> 03:48:59.160]  that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters
[03:48:59.160 --> 03:49:06.360]  madiba he lived this complexity in prison he studied africans so that he
[03:49:06.360 --> 03:49:10.520]  could better understand the people who were jailing him
[03:49:10.520 --> 03:49:14.360]  and when he got out of prison he extended a hand to those who had jailed
[03:49:14.360 --> 03:49:18.040]  because he knew that they had to be a part
[03:49:18.040 --> 03:49:21.720]  of the democratic south africa that he wanted to build
[03:49:21.720 --> 03:49:26.360]  so there you have it barack obama basically telling democrats that if they
[03:49:26.360 --> 03:49:29.800]  continue with this feverish obsession with identity politics
[03:49:29.800 --> 03:49:33.000]  they're going to lose further support we already know they've lost nine percent
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:35.480]  i think it was nine percent of millennial support
[03:49:35.480 --> 03:49:39.480]  since 2016 in fact there's an article out of reason here new poll shows
[03:49:39.480 --> 03:49:42.520]  millennials are defecting from the democratic party
[03:49:42.520 --> 03:49:47.240]  so again they are distancing themselves from this party because of their
[03:49:47.240 --> 03:49:50.760]  obsession with identity politics because it's divisive
[03:49:50.760 --> 03:49:54.680]  because it's hateful as we've seen over the course of the past 18 months
[03:49:54.680 --> 03:49:58.840]  now we have a headline out of rasmussen which ties into this
[03:49:58.840 --> 03:50:03.800]  73 percent of democrats want a fresh face as 2020 nominee
[03:50:03.800 --> 03:50:07.400]  hila ricklinson bernie tanders joe biden amongst those how does serious
[03:50:07.400 --> 03:50:10.120]  democratic presidential contenders in 2020
[03:50:10.120 --> 03:50:13.720]  but three out of four democrats think their party needs to turn to someone
[03:50:13.720 --> 03:50:17.480]  new new rasmussen reports national telephone survey says that
[03:50:17.480 --> 03:50:21.640]  73 percent of likely democratic voters believe their party should look for a
[03:50:21.640 --> 03:50:24.760]  fresh face to run for president in 2020
[03:50:24.760 --> 03:50:28.520]  so they're sick of what they were getting so far basically they've also lost
[03:50:28.520 --> 03:50:32.040]  nine percent of millennial support since 2016
[03:50:32.040 --> 03:50:35.160]  and now even barack obama is warning them
[03:50:35.160 --> 03:50:38.520]  that if they continue down that same road it's probably going to be disaster
[03:50:38.520 --> 03:50:42.600]  ones again will they listen no no they won't listen they're
[03:50:42.600 --> 03:50:46.920]  still obsessed with dividing people by race by religion
[03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:50.120]  and they're going to continue on that course and it's going to cause them a
[03:50:50.120 --> 03:50:53.720]  lot of problems electorally so don't interrupt the enemy when
[03:50:53.720 --> 03:50:56.440]  they're making a mistake is basically the message here
[03:50:56.440 --> 03:51:00.520]  but barack obama is trying to do an intervention trying to perform an
[03:51:00.520 --> 03:51:03.240]  intervention on that basically they're not going to listen they haven't listened
[03:51:03.240 --> 03:51:06.120]  so far it remains doubtful as to whether they
[03:51:06.120 --> 03:51:10.600]  will in the immediate future this is up on in four wars europe
[03:51:10.600 --> 03:51:16.280]  world cup multiculty france burns dignified Croatian celebrate loss so
[03:51:16.280 --> 03:51:18.760]  of course france beat Croatian the world cup
[03:51:18.760 --> 03:51:22.840]  final people are basically obsessed with the fact
[03:51:22.840 --> 03:51:26.680]  that the french team was majority black in fact let me find this tweet
[03:51:26.680 --> 03:51:31.160]  basically someone made the argument that because about 50%
[03:51:31.160 --> 03:51:35.640]  of the french team were muslims i think it was something like 18 out of the 23
[03:51:35.640 --> 03:51:41.240]  total squad were black they make this observation
[03:51:41.240 --> 03:51:45.800]  about identity politics about the fact that this was a win for diversity well
[03:51:45.800 --> 03:51:49.720]  i'm still recovering from watching the world cup from the shocking lack of
[03:51:49.720 --> 03:51:53.400]  diversity in the egyptian moroccan and senegalian
[03:51:53.400 --> 03:51:56.360]  teams absolutely shocking lack of diversity
[03:51:56.360 --> 03:52:00.600]  the senegal team from africa obviously had no white people in it
[03:52:00.600 --> 03:52:04.200]  when are we going to address that shocking lack of diversity
[03:52:04.200 --> 03:52:09.000]  for example in the japanese team no black people in the japanese team
[03:52:09.000 --> 03:52:12.200]  but now if you're talking about france then they want to talk about it that's
[03:52:12.200 --> 03:52:15.240]  interesting isn't it so there's this ridiculous sweet there you see it up on
[03:52:15.240 --> 03:52:18.600]  screen dear france congratulations on winning the
[03:52:18.600 --> 03:52:24.040]  world cup by the way this tweet got 514 000 likes this
[03:52:24.040 --> 03:52:27.320]  is the level of idiocy that dominates twitter
[03:52:27.320 --> 03:52:32.600]  goes on to say 80% of your team is african cut out the racism and xenophobia
[03:52:32.600 --> 03:52:35.720]  50% of your team are muslims cut out these lamophobia
[03:52:35.720 --> 03:52:39.080]  africans and muslims delivered you a second world cup now deliver them
[03:52:39.080 --> 03:52:42.280]  justice well first of all the vast majority of that french team
[03:52:42.280 --> 03:52:46.520]  were born in france they have to be born in france to play for the french
[03:52:46.520 --> 03:52:50.680]  national team secondly that tweet collectively
[03:52:50.680 --> 03:52:54.120]  thanks muslims for winning france the world cup
[03:52:54.120 --> 03:52:56.840]  okay so if you want to set up the rhetorical argument
[03:52:56.840 --> 03:53:01.720]  that muslims are collectively to to thank for france winning the world cup
[03:53:01.720 --> 03:53:05.880]  do you want to also agree by that same logic that muslims are collectively
[03:53:05.880 --> 03:53:10.520]  to blame for other acts committed by muslims in france
[03:53:10.520 --> 03:53:13.800]  because over the past few years there's been quite a few acts committed by
[03:53:13.800 --> 03:53:17.800]  muslims in france that aren't very positive to say the least you
[03:53:17.800 --> 03:53:21.080]  want to talk about charlie hebdo you want to talk about the paris massacre
[03:53:21.080 --> 03:53:23.960]  you want to talk about the bataclan massacre you want to talk about the
[03:53:23.960 --> 03:53:27.800]  killing of numerous police officers in france so the past few years by muslim
[03:53:27.800 --> 03:53:30.840]  terrorists so again the left plays this game when
[03:53:30.840 --> 03:53:34.600]  it's good for them when it's convenient for their logic to collectivize
[03:53:34.600 --> 03:53:38.920]  in the positive sense oh they're all for it whether it's race or religion
[03:53:38.920 --> 03:53:43.000]  but as soon as you start to talk about it in a negative context
[03:53:43.000 --> 03:53:46.920]  your racist you're an islamophobe but again
[03:53:46.920 --> 03:53:50.200]  five hundred thousand likes on this dumb tweet
[03:53:50.200 --> 03:53:54.200]  there was another one it's medihassan it's in the same article
[03:53:54.200 --> 03:53:57.400]  he says it was a victory for france well-deserved oh and le pen and all the
[03:53:57.400 --> 03:54:00.520]  other racist french nationalists you can shut your mouths and hang your heads in
[03:54:00.520 --> 03:54:06.040]  shame amazing team amazing diversity amazing talent again
[03:54:06.040 --> 03:54:09.480]  why does france have to be lectured and put on the rack for its
[03:54:09.480 --> 03:54:12.600]  for its so-called diversity and then praise for its diversity
[03:54:12.600 --> 03:54:16.280]  no criticism for the shocking lack of diversity
[03:54:16.280 --> 03:54:20.360]  in the egyptian team in the moroccan team in the senegal team
[03:54:20.360 --> 03:54:24.840]  in the nigerian team why is it only imposed on western countries that's
[03:54:24.840 --> 03:54:29.400]  interesting that isn't it but again aside from that the vast majority of
[03:54:29.400 --> 03:54:32.440]  them were born in france why are you bringing up race
[03:54:32.440 --> 03:54:36.360]  why are you calling them african when they were born in france
[03:54:36.360 --> 03:54:39.880]  they lecture other people about being obsessed with race and ethnicity
[03:54:39.880 --> 03:54:43.880]  the first opportunity that they get to obsess about race and ethnicity
[03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:47.800]  they do it they're french who cares what color they are
[03:54:47.800 --> 03:54:51.320]  you know as long as they embrace ideals
[03:54:51.320 --> 03:54:54.440]  that we should you know encourage for the greatest society that benefit
[03:54:54.440 --> 03:54:58.360]  everybody who cares now they always want to make it about that
[03:54:58.360 --> 03:55:02.600]  and they want to collectively thank muslims for winning france the world cup
[03:55:02.600 --> 03:55:06.520]  all right try having a poll in france no it might be close
[03:55:06.520 --> 03:55:09.640]  i mean that country's basically on the right now it's being on the wrong way
[03:55:09.640 --> 03:55:12.840]  for many years you want to have a poll in france
[03:55:12.840 --> 03:55:16.440]  should we uh should we keep the world cup or should we bring back all those people
[03:55:16.440 --> 03:55:19.720]  slaughtered in the paris massacre let's have a poll
[03:55:19.720 --> 03:55:23.480]  then we'll see who's collectively to thank or who's collectively to blame
[03:55:23.480 --> 03:55:26.920]  of course nobody's collectively to blame because collectivism
[03:55:26.920 --> 03:55:32.040]  is racism but they jump to it at the very first opportunity when it suits their
[03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:36.600]  narrative oh but where is lamaphobic you know on the flip side of it
[03:55:36.600 --> 03:55:39.720]  you can't play that game without losing you can't say that muslims are
[03:55:39.720 --> 03:55:42.920]  collectively to thank for france winning the world cup because there are some
[03:55:42.920 --> 03:55:46.440]  muslims in the french team and then say when people say there's a problem
[03:55:46.440 --> 03:55:50.680]  with islam in terms of violent extremism no you how dare you collectively
[03:55:50.680 --> 03:55:54.280]  blame all muslims even though we're not collectively blaming all muslims
[03:55:54.280 --> 03:55:59.960]  they try to play it both ways but again people are so dumb 500 000 likes
[03:55:59.960 --> 03:56:04.280]  500 000 likes on twitter that is why it is a dumpster fire
[03:56:04.280 --> 03:56:08.920]  for logic and rationality on a daily basis
[03:56:08.920 --> 03:56:13.240]  swedish broadcaster deletes peace on muslim anti-semitism after threats
[03:56:13.240 --> 03:56:16.520]  the now deleted article maintained that the main threat against swedish Jews
[03:56:16.520 --> 03:56:19.720]  was not right when radicals but islamic anti-semitism
[03:56:19.720 --> 03:56:23.400]  so basically sweden's national broadcaster svt
[03:56:23.400 --> 03:56:26.520]  published an opinion piece penned by a person attached to the stock home
[03:56:26.520 --> 03:56:30.200]  jewish assembly they put it up saying that
[03:56:30.200 --> 03:56:33.480]  writhing extremism while it should be deplored while it should be monitored
[03:56:33.480 --> 03:56:38.920]  is not as big a threat as anti-semitic muslim extremism
[03:56:38.920 --> 03:56:43.480]  the article was deleted because the author got death threats to himself and
[03:56:43.480 --> 03:56:47.640]  his family kind of proving his point right
[03:56:47.640 --> 03:56:51.560]  it's this argument no free speech has consequences you should you should pay
[03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:55.480]  the consequences like the charlie hebdo cartoonist who was slaughtered
[03:56:55.480 --> 03:57:00.280]  had to pay the consequences so this this cucked news organization national
[03:57:00.280 --> 03:57:03.480]  broadcaster just deleted the article altogether
[03:57:03.480 --> 03:57:08.920]  and caved in like intellectual cowards they're in sweden what do you expect
[03:57:08.920 --> 03:57:13.880]  the latest ugov survey this is in europe finds that majorities in all seven
[03:57:13.880 --> 03:57:17.080]  nations are opposed to taking in more migrants
[03:57:17.080 --> 03:57:21.320]  absolutely massive poll you can read that on westmonster.com
