[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  You didn't listen on President Trump's call and President Lissie's call?
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.000]  I did not.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  You've never talked with Chief of Staff Mulvaney?
[01:06.000 --> 01:07.000]  I never did.
[01:07.000 --> 01:08.000]  You never met the President?
[01:08.000 --> 01:09.000]  That's correct.
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  You had three meetings again with Zelensky and it didn't come up.
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  And two of those they had never heard about as far as I know.
[01:14.000 --> 01:15.000]  There was no reason for it to come up.
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  President Lissky never made an announcement.
[01:18.000 --> 01:19.000]  This is what I can't believe.
[01:19.000 --> 01:21.000]  And you're their star witness.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.000]  You're their first witness.
[01:23.000 --> 01:24.000]  You're the guy.
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  You're the guy based on this.
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  I mean, I've seen church prayer change that are easier to understand than this.
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told...
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  Now again, this is hereby swear and affirm from Gordon Sondland.
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yarmouk on September 1, 2020.
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  This all happens by the way.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  This all happens by the way in Warsaw where Vice President Pence meets with President Zelensky.
[01:51.000 --> 01:52.000]  And guess what?
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  They didn't talk about any linkage either.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  Time the gentleman's expired.
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  President Zelensky had to commit to an investigation of Bidens before the aid got released.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  And the aid got released and he didn't commit to an investigation.
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  Mr. I was not wrong about what I told you, which is what I heard.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  That's all I've said.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  I've told you what I heard.
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.000]  And that's the point.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  What you heard did not happen.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  It didn't happen.
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  You had three meetings with the guy.
[02:18.000 --> 02:19.000]  He could have told you.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  He didn't announce he was going to do an investigation before the aid happened.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  It's not just could it have been wrong.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  The fact is it was wrong because it didn't happen.
[02:28.000 --> 02:35.000]  The whole point was you had a clear understanding that aid will not get released unless there's a commitment.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  Not maybe not.
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  I think the aid might happen and it's my hunch it's going to get released.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  You use clear language, clear understanding and commitment.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  And those two things didn't happen.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  So you had to be wrong.
[02:47.000 --> 03:01.000]  Mr. Jordan, the other thing that went on when that when that assistance was on hold is we shook the confidence of a close partner in our reliability.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  And that's not what this proceeding is about.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  Ambassador Jaylor has expired.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  That's not what this whole thing started on.
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.000]  I think Eric Charmel needs to be pulled in for testimony and then I think it'll be ultimately determined at that point.
[03:14.000 --> 03:23.000]  I think he is a person of interest in the sense that he was at the Ukraine desk when Joe Biden was there when Hunter Biden was working for the Ukrainian oligarch.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  So simply for that alone, I think he's a material witness and needs to be brought in.
[03:27.000 --> 03:35.000]  The other question is while the whistleblower is protected from being fired and from retaliation and I think for court proceedings,
[03:35.000 --> 03:47.000]  the whistleblower is not protected from being asked who gave him the information because we can't have a country where the private contents of the president's phone call are leaked to people who are not supposed to be in.
[03:47.000 --> 03:54.000]  Just to ask a clarifying question, do you anticipate when we might vote on the ability to have the whistleblower in front of us?
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  Something you, the 435 members of Congress, you are the only member who knows who that individual is.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  And your staff is the only staff of any member of Congress who has a chance to talk with that individual.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  We would like that opportunity. When might that happen in this proceeding today?
[04:09.000 --> 04:17.000]  First, as the gentleman knows, that's a false statement. I do not know the identity of the whistleblower and I'm determined to make sure that identity is protected.
[04:17.000 --> 04:26.000]  But as I said to Mr. Conaway, you will have an opportunity after the witnesses testify to make a motion to subpoena any witness and compel a vote.
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000]  I said this last week, but this is a sad day. This is a sad day for this country.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  You think about what the Democrats have put our nation through for the last three years.
[04:35.000 --> 04:43.000]  It started July of 2016 when they spied on two American citizens associated with the presidential campaign and all that unfolded with a Mueller investigation after that.
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.000]  And when that didn't work, here we are based on this.
[04:49.000 --> 05:00.000]  The American people see through all this, they understand the facts support the president, they understand this process is unfair, and they see through the whole darn sham.
[05:00.000 --> 05:09.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.000]  I could see where the globalists were going. I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[05:15.000 --> 05:34.000]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be deplatformed, that they were really setting the president to take everybody off air, to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.000]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[05:40.000 --> 05:51.000]  It was the model of Info Wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[05:51.000 --> 06:11.000]  That's why keeping Info Wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[06:21.000 --> 06:40.000]  Gentlemen, it is Thursday, November 14, 2019, and I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:40.000 --> 07:02.000]  And we are broadcasting worldwide with 354 days left until the historic election. And I got to tell you, I've got some really, really good news today, and I've got some really, really bad news for everybody here today.
[07:02.000 --> 07:17.000]  Now, we're going to lay all this out, we're going to roll through all this today as we broadcast live worldwide on this Thursday edition.
[07:17.000 --> 07:36.000]  But I got to tell you that we've got a lot of stuff going on, we've got a lot of big interesting developments that are unfolding, and that is, they want to basically railroad Roger Stone, as we all know.
[07:36.000 --> 07:48.000]  And once they set the precedent for that, they think they're going to railroad everybody else. And it's real cheering, and it's woken a lot of people up.
[07:48.000 --> 07:56.000]  And I've learned a lot of really horrible things about the trial from the Stone Camp last night this morning, and from some reporters that are going to be joining us.
[07:56.000 --> 08:06.000]  And this whole thing is a lot bigger than Roger Stone. This is about due process in this country being flushed down the toilet.
[08:06.000 --> 08:18.000]  Because once due process is gone, if you think there's already tyranny in this country, well, wait, we'll get as bad as North Korea, probably a lot worse, because we tend to do everything real big here in America.
[08:18.000 --> 08:29.000]  So as soon as I'm able to tell you the stuff that's going on behind the scenes in the Stone Trial, I will. I'm able to tell you a lot that I already know, and I'll be getting to that coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[08:29.000 --> 08:45.000]  But that's the bad news. I'm going to give you the good news when we come back at the start of the next segment.
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.000]  Because I'm always trying to get people to be realists.
[08:51.000 --> 09:02.000]  I want people to know how serious the fight is and how the establishment's trying to overwhelm us and get us to give up.
[09:02.000 --> 09:12.000]  Other people think that everything's going to be just fine if we all just stick with the plan, whatever magic plan that is.
[09:12.000 --> 09:22.000]  But the rot of the Democrats and their arrogance is their strength, but it's also their weakness.
[09:22.000 --> 09:37.000]  And if you look at the headlines that are up at infowars.com and newswars.com, they're pretty amazing because it's from the Associated Press.
[09:37.000 --> 09:47.000]  It's from the Hill. Hell, it's even a couple of the headlines at CNN.
[09:47.000 --> 09:56.000]  And there it is. AP calls impeachment hearings a scam because it is a scam.
[09:56.000 --> 10:05.000]  Everybody can see that they're calling it the biggest bombshell ever against Trump and proof of quid pro quo.
[10:05.000 --> 10:12.000]  And then all it is is people saying again they heard it third hand and could ever say who actually originally heard it.
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.000]  And now Adam Schiff says there is no whistleblower basically, which we originally said at the start of all this.
[10:18.000 --> 10:28.000]  Mike Adams called it first. He said it's Clapper and Brennan and Hillary and Obama know that Trump was exposing the corrupt Ukrainian deal they were all involved in.
[10:28.000 --> 10:36.000]  Yet Romney was involved as well. And so because Trump was getting close, they would just turn it around and say it was Trump.
[10:36.000 --> 10:43.000]  Just like they did with the whole Russia gate situation.
[10:43.000 --> 10:51.000]  And that's really it. So the wheels have come off, almost no viewers.
[10:51.000 --> 10:59.000]  And you could say oh well then Trump's going to be fine. No. Because they have the votes in the House to pass the impeachment.
[10:59.000 --> 11:05.000]  And that's the next phase is the Democrats are now calling for there not to be a trial in the Senate.
[11:05.000 --> 11:12.000]  Just if the House votes that impeachment proceedings have initiated, well they already had the trial they're claiming.
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.000]  That's not how it works with the show trial. And so the Senate doesn't need one.
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.000]  Because if they have a real trial, Trump will be totally and completely exonerated just like Roger Stone would have been.
[11:24.000 --> 11:37.000]  I am predicting that Roger Stone will be found guilty on all six counts probably by the rigged jury.
[11:37.000 --> 11:46.000]  And believe me, is it rigged? Remember we exposed those in the news that a major Democrat official from the Obama administration's husband worked in the Mueller probe.
[11:46.000 --> 11:56.000]  Was selected for the jury when we exposed that and said you shouldn't have Obama or Hillary or anybody else that worked for him on a high level on the jury.
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  They said I should be arrested for jury tampering when all I was doing was exposing corruption.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  Of course it turned out it was all totally legal.
[12:04.000 --> 12:11.000]  But now we know that there are a bunch of other Obama officials and Hillary officials and spooks from the CIA or indeed.
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  On that jury, one juror clearly was supporting Stone.
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.000]  She fell down yesterday and hit her head and was replaced by an alternate juror as they call them.
[12:22.000 --> 12:32.000]  No, you can't make this up and we'll have reporters on the ground who've been in the trial, Jacob Engels and Joe Biggs, at the bottom of the hour.
[12:32.000 --> 12:47.000]  And this is a window into this evil corrupt world, but first I'm going to get into the wheels flying off the fake impeachment charade fiasco.
[12:47.000 --> 12:55.000]  But they don't care because they're going to bring more hoaxes forward and get the legalese in position.
[12:55.000 --> 13:04.000]  They believe to blackmail and threaten the Senate with all sorts of criminal destabilization, they're going to pull into Christmas and into next year.
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  Now I think the wheels coming off in the house means they probably won't get the trial going until early next year.
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  They're getting behind on their timetable.
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  But the fact that they're so bold, even though it's badly coordinated, is their strength.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  They're on the attack. They're on the offensive.
[13:23.000 --> 13:30.000]  The fact that it's been so discrediting, though, if Trump would take action, if we would take action, if we would get on the offense, there's a lot of ways to do that.
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  We could really mop up these guys peacefully, legally and lawfully right now.
[13:35.000 --> 13:48.000]  But the longer that the more sane people in the establishment have this sit back and watch attitude, the worse things are going to get and the more things are going to deteriorate.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  So to say that we're in dangerous or interesting times is really an understatement.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  This is an incredibly important point in human history right now.
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  And I can tell you that when Roger is convicted and I'm almost always right, maybe a miracle is going to happen.
[14:02.000 --> 14:10.000]  You know, I talked to him last night and he said only a miracle of God right now is going to stop this.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  And he said he wouldn't talk about what happened inside.
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.000]  He's not going to give the judge any reason to nail him even harder.
[14:15.000 --> 14:27.000]  So I talked to people who were in the courtroom and they said that the jury shakes with hate at him and stares at him like they want to kill him in their virtue signaling to the media and all of the intelligence
[14:27.000 --> 14:36.000]  agency operatives in Obama and Hillary officials that are in there staring at Roger like they want to kill him.
[14:36.000 --> 14:47.000]  So I would expect a quick verdict. They have been deliberating since 10 a.m.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  Eastern. So that's two hours and 14 minutes.
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  And we'll be watching that as it unfolds live here at band.video and infowars.com.
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  And I know I talk about this a lot and it's because it's the absolute truth.
[15:02.000 --> 15:09.000]  And I'm a fish. Info Wars audience is the ocean.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  And without you, we're not here.
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  But really, we're all just fish in this ocean together and free speech and liberty and freedom is the ocean.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  And the globalists are trying to poison that sea.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  They're trying to drain that sea.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  They're trying to boil that sea.
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  And they're openly admitting a post human world and I don't want to let them win.
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  And so this is the great animating contest of liberty and things are getting really, really hot right now.
[15:33.000 --> 15:44.000]  There's so much more coming up today on this November 14th, 2019, Thursday live broadcast teleprompter free.
[15:44.000 --> 15:49.000]  I'm real. You're real. God's real. But the devil's real as well.
[15:49.000 --> 15:58.000]  We've got to make our cosmic eternal infinity decision which side we're on.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker.

[17:23.000 --> 17:28.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  I can help you too.
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[17:49.000 --> 18:00.000]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[18:00.000 --> 18:10.000]  About a month ago President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida where he's always said he planned to retire too.
[18:10.000 --> 18:21.000]  And the left got so excited they said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  Well, now we know why the president did that.
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  He knew the leftist controlled appeals courts.
[18:26.000 --> 18:33.000]  We're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got.
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with.
[18:37.000 --> 18:47.000]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign.
[18:52.000 --> 18:58.000]  In his words, we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[18:58.000 --> 19:12.000]  Beto Roark came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles and he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others to agree and said that he was a hero.
[19:12.000 --> 19:13.000]  Think about that.
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.000]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[19:17.000 --> 19:26.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  They know what they're doing.
[19:28.000 --> 19:36.000]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[19:40.000 --> 19:52.000]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[19:52.000 --> 19:58.000]  So you see, a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens. Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[20:22.000 --> 20:37.000]  November 14th, 2019 on this live Thursday edition.
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[20:42.000 --> 20:52.000]  We have Roger Stone is found guilty by what appears to be a kangaroo railroad court operation.
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  Then we launch operation free Roger Stone.
[20:57.000 --> 21:03.000]  And we have already launched that contingency.
[21:03.000 --> 21:18.000]  We're going to put that down more next segment. But when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails and those that cry to peas appease are hung by those they tried to please.
[21:18.000 --> 21:26.000]  But let's get to the impeachment fiasco yesterday.
[21:26.000 --> 21:40.000]  And now today, and the wheels, as I've said, completely coming off, just like Russiagate collapsed, but they will simply come up with a new scam.
[21:40.000 --> 21:51.000]  And I predict they will vote in the House of Representatives by the end of this year to initiate the trial in the Senate.
[21:51.000 --> 22:01.000]  That's the indictment in the House. Now, that's the way this jurisprudence works when it comes to the legislative body of the three branches of government.
[22:01.000 --> 22:04.000]  One of the three branches.
[22:04.000 --> 22:12.000]  And so yes, this is a big victory that this was so hollow, so flat, and they had to have sickening operatives.
[22:12.000 --> 22:23.000]  Mr Wallace on Fox News. Call it very damaging to Trump. And then he gushed over one of the ambassadors.
[22:23.000 --> 22:38.000]  Edward Armuro voices. Oh, his voice sounded so amazing. He heard from somebody that heard Trump on the phone saying he wanted them to have a criminal investigation.
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  Of the deep state's criminal activities.
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  Even if that was true, wow, how horrible.
[22:47.000 --> 22:54.000]  But you see their real success here is sucking all the oxygen out of the room.
[22:54.000 --> 23:04.000]  Because while we're defending the fact that we're not Russian agents, while we're defending the fact that Trump wasn't engaged in corruption.
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.000]  He's doing his job as a chief executive trying to root out corruption if people are going to get money from us.
[23:10.000 --> 23:31.000]  All the other big issues are going on and the Democrats have their jurisdictions collapsing into crime and feces and homelessness and drugs and earthquakes and burning cities and just giant illegal alien invasions and attacks on our free speech
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  and massive censorship.
[23:34.000 --> 23:42.000]  Unprecedented levels of suicide.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  Now, let's look at some of these headlines.
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  Sad day or scam what to watch.
[23:48.000 --> 23:51.000]  AP saying is it a scam.
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.000]  The fact that they would even say something like that because it is a scam.
[23:56.000 --> 24:01.000]  All based on hearsay.
[24:01.000 --> 24:07.000]  But I'll tell you what's beautiful about this due process, though it's fighting for its life.
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  Came through again.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  Because Eric.
[24:13.000 --> 24:19.000]  Sierra Mela of the CIA, who it turns out was involved with Hunter Biden.
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  And the shady dealings presiding over some of it.
[24:24.000 --> 24:32.000]  Had the motive to attack Trump and make this up had bosses above him like Obama, Hillary, Brennan.
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  That he worked directly for.
[24:35.000 --> 24:41.000]  Hates Trump, his lawyer hates Trump in between praising Epstein and praising.
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  Well, helping pedophiles.
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  What a group of scum.
[24:48.000 --> 25:00.000]  That no one was supposed to say his name so no one could challenge him and find out that he wasn't the first hand person either because that person doesn't exist.
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.000]  And now.
[25:03.000 --> 25:09.000]  This morning.
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.000]  She has to admit.
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  That their quote is no whistleblower.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  Mike Adams, the guy smart.
[25:19.000 --> 25:26.000]  First predicted on this show months ago.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  They just made it up in a committee.
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  They all met secretly with shift.
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  We know that they cooked up this giant fraud.
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.000]  And then they just hoped having enough people say they heard it third hand.
[25:39.000 --> 25:46.000]  Would make quid pro quo a reason to move Trump, but it turns out under the Constitution quid pro quo is not bad.
[25:46.000 --> 25:52.000]  If Kennedy says we'll take our missiles out of Turkey if you take your missiles out of Cuba.
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.000]  That's tit for tat.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  That's what the executive branch does.
[25:55.000 --> 26:05.000]  It would have Trump would have said, I'll give you a billion dollars if you license my hotels all over your country and wave the taxes, then I would call for Trump to be impeached.
[26:05.000 --> 26:13.000]  And he would be impeached because it's called quid pro quo bribery.
[26:13.000 --> 26:17.000]  As the type of stuff the Democrats do all day long.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  And Trump doesn't like that is trying to stop it.
[26:19.000 --> 26:26.000]  And that's why this group of arrogant crooks is so upset.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  So we'll play all those clips coming up, but this is really a big, big deal.
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  Here's the problem.
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  They're going to move forward with new lives.
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  They're going to get their impeachment, I predict, in the house, and then they're going to twist arms in the Senate.
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  And now it's in the news that they're challenging McConnell.
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  The Democrats are, oh, we'll show enough evidence here.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  You don't need to have the trial in the Senate.
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.000]  Shifts already done that and are going to do that in the other committees.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  What a sick joke.
[26:55.000 --> 27:02.000]  They tried to get all their ponies in a row, they tried to have their dress rehearsals in the basement of the Capitol.
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.000]  That didn't work.
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.000]  And so now they're just going to continue the process on.
[27:13.000 --> 27:24.000]  And the Democrats under Pelosi's control are going to order their members of their evil party to vote for the impeachment.
[27:24.000 --> 27:30.000]  And it's going to drag into the election year with no shame by these crooks.
[27:30.000 --> 27:40.000]  You know, Abinadi has been indicted again for reported scams and blackmail with Nike.
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  And that's really the path here.
[27:45.000 --> 27:51.000]  He was the big darling of the media running all these clear criminal scams, and it finally caught up to him.
[27:51.000 --> 28:01.000]  But what shifts done, and what Hillary's done, and what Pelosi's done, and what CNN's done, and what all the media has done,
[28:01.000 --> 28:17.000]  aiding and abetting this fraud, is a giant criminal fraud way bigger than the creepy porn lawyer ever could imagine.
[28:17.000 --> 28:25.000]  And you're still going to have people like Chris Wallace, that little bootlicker.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  Just gush over, damning, incredible, amazing.
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.000]  Oh my gosh, Trump is in so much trouble. That will still fool a certain percentage of people,
[28:35.000 --> 28:42.000]  but the vast majority know enough about due process in America to hear the same rumors over and over again
[28:42.000 --> 28:49.000]  and say the crime is what these people are all doing, trying to block the 2016 election and nullify it
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.000]  and steal the upcoming election because they don't like what the people did.
[28:54.000 --> 29:15.000]  This is an attack on us.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  National treatment advisers.
[29:26.000 --> 29:33.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.000]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse. Get clean.
[29:42.000 --> 30:00.000]  Call now and learn more.
[30:00.000 --> 30:03.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[30:03.000 --> 30:12.000]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit?
[30:14.000 --> 30:21.000]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[30:21.000 --> 30:27.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[30:27.000 --> 30:33.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist.
[30:33.000 --> 30:36.000]  Or that there's no free will. There's no devil or the God.
[30:36.000 --> 30:44.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  and what our houses can be like.
[30:46.000 --> 30:50.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  Oxford's banned clapping.
[30:52.000 --> 30:59.000]  Universities in the U.S. have banned 21 Gun Salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[30:59.000 --> 31:03.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[31:03.000 --> 31:07.000]  I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[31:07.000 --> 31:10.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[31:10.000 --> 31:16.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity.
[31:16.000 --> 31:24.000]  To see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[31:28.000 --> 31:38.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswars.com,
[31:38.000 --> 31:47.000]  infowars.com and banned.video and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have
[31:47.000 --> 31:50.000]  is at infowars.com.com.
[31:50.000 --> 31:59.000]  So take heart folks, they've had to censor everybody and show everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[31:59.000 --> 32:08.000]  Infowars Life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet, super silver whitening toothpaste.
[32:08.000 --> 32:15.000]  This is proprietary, this is with the top lab in the country and it is incredibly high quality.
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.000]  This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[32:18.000 --> 32:26.000]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria, it recalcifies the teeth, it does so many things on so many fronts.
[32:26.000 --> 32:34.000]  These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates.
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.000]  It's as low as we can go and they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit.
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[32:43.000 --> 32:49.000]  I want to thank my father, a retired dentist for spearheading this the last two years and developing it.
[32:49.000 --> 32:57.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates, that's as low as we can go because it's very, very expensive to produce.
[32:57.000 --> 33:26.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:26.000 --> 33:37.000]  We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else.
[33:37.000 --> 33:42.000]  Hitler took the guns. Stalin took the guns. Mal took the guns. Fidel Castro took the guns.
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  Do the Chavez took the guns.
[33:45.000 --> 34:08.000]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms. The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[34:08.000 --> 34:22.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[34:22.000 --> 34:27.000]  I want them shut down. I want them silent. I want them muted. I think they are horrible for our society.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  Why are they doing this now?
[34:29.000 --> 34:41.000]  It's a good question as to why they waited this long.
[34:41.000 --> 34:48.000]  Now that they kick them off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[34:48.000 --> 35:00.000]  You have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now. I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[35:00.000 --> 35:07.000]  I have no issue with it at all. I want them shut down. I want them silent. I want them muted. I think they are horrible for our society.
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.000]  I want them shut down. I want them silent. I want them muted.
[35:12.000 --> 35:25.000]  But don't worry. These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[35:25.000 --> 35:48.000]  All right. I have talked to Roger Stone last night and this morning, and I've talked to a lot of the reporters that were in the trial yesterday where the closing statements of the defense and the prosecution ended at 10 a.m. Eastern about two and a half hours ago.
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  They began deliberations.
[35:52.000 --> 36:02.000]  Now, Roger hasn't violated his gag order, getting into the case with me. He just said that he leaves it in God's hands and that he's praying for a miracle.
[36:02.000 --> 36:07.000]  And then I talked to reporters like Joe Biggs, Jacob Ingalls, and others.
[36:07.000 --> 36:17.000]  Jacob Ingalls has been threatened with arrest if he talks about the Obama officials that they put on the jury, not just the one that we exposed, the judge removed, but others.
[36:17.000 --> 36:28.000]  And as soon as the verdict comes out, you're going to get to learn about what is undoubtedly the fakest trial I've ever heard of in U.S. history.
[36:28.000 --> 36:35.000]  And I've studied a lot of history. I'm addicted to it. I've never heard of a kangaroo court like this in the U.S.
[36:35.000 --> 36:48.000]  Before we had our main due process and things, there were violations of it. We'd like to sail on witch trials and things. So that went on. But that was pre-1776 and our Revolutionary War and what we went to war for.
[36:48.000 --> 36:53.000]  A lot of it was due process. And you read that, the Declaration of Independence.
[36:53.000 --> 37:00.000]  And the special courts that the king had set up that were really violating people that were packed with picked juries and grand juries.
[37:00.000 --> 37:10.000]  So we're all Roger Stone. You know, Trump acts tough, and he is tough, and he's hardworking, and he cares about the country, but he's really a nice guy.
[37:10.000 --> 37:19.000]  Stone's been called a villain by these people for years. He just played into it. The guy's not a villain at all. It's more like Mr. Magoo, but he is smart.
[37:19.000 --> 37:32.000]  And he did help get Trump elected, and he was advising Trump on a every other day basis throughout the campaign. And I was there in some of those phone calls.
[37:32.000 --> 37:38.000]  I mean, Stone would say, hey, Alex is getting married next week. Call and congratulate him and boom, Trump would call.
[37:38.000 --> 37:45.000]  And they had Trump's phones tapped during the campaign, and they had him tapped once he was at the White House. We knew that. We first broke that.
[37:45.000 --> 37:56.000]  And it came out in court. White House age testified that Trump was talking to Stone every other day, sometimes for an hour.
[37:56.000 --> 38:04.000]  Hell, I got invited once to Mar-a-Lago, and it goes to the secret tunnel, but I didn't go because I had a family emergency.
[38:04.000 --> 38:16.000]  But, you know, Roger went. And I'm not telling any secrets here that the establishment doesn't know because the president's phones are tapped by the criminal permanent deep state.
[38:16.000 --> 38:25.000]  And so that's why they got enraged by Stone and were obsessed with him was because he was giving the president great advice.
[38:25.000 --> 38:38.000]  Because they go back 44 years now. And Stone used to be Trump's wingman dating and Trump's beard. And again, Trump is not having a beard for homosexual sex.
[38:38.000 --> 38:45.000]  Beards go the other way, too, where your buddy goes out with you and your girlfriend when you're famous, so people don't know that you're out with your girlfriend.
[38:45.000 --> 38:54.000]  They think it's their girlfriend. And that's what Stone and Trump go way back in is originally sometimes dating the same women.
[38:54.000 --> 39:04.000]  So, yeah, they've gotten water out of the same well, as they say. So that's what's going on here. And they know all that about Trump.
[39:04.000 --> 39:12.000]  Okay. And they want his wingman in prison as a message to Trump, we're going to get you.
[39:12.000 --> 39:20.000]  And I can tell you the two getting fights with each other, too. I mean, they, Stone talked straight to the president, and they get big arguments and all the rest of it.
[39:20.000 --> 39:25.000]  So, and they've gotten in fights over girlfriends that they, that each other had back and forth.
[39:25.000 --> 39:31.000]  They never double teamed any chicks. And I'm not trying to get graphic here, but the media will, you know, spin all this stuff.
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.000]  So that's why they want to put him in prison. He had nothing to do with WikiLeaks. He didn't lie about it.
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  Assange was saying it's going to hurt Hillary really bad. Everybody knew that. We were saying, oh, it's huge. It's huge.
[39:41.000 --> 39:48.000]  We believed it was huge. And Assange delivered. And the president said, hey, I don't know who's got all this stuff.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  But whoever's got it, WikiLeaks, whoever released it. Russians, if you've got it, release it.
[39:52.000 --> 39:58.000]  It's about what Hillary did wrong. Not about who got the stuff.
[39:58.000 --> 40:04.000]  But again, they changed the subject. The Clintons, Obama, Romney.
[40:04.000 --> 40:12.000]  Oh, Romney is the Obama phone lady calls him. The whistleblower CIA Ramallah.
[40:12.000 --> 40:19.000]  He was involved. Now he's not a whistleblower anymore. He never heard it firsthand either.
[40:19.000 --> 40:24.000]  It's all made up. Shift down. Oh, you can't call him. He wants it a whistleblower. He's not a witness.
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  He's just the star witness that Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter wouldn't let you say his damn name.
[40:29.000 --> 40:39.000]  They call for Donald Trump Jr.'s arrest for saying it. They call for my arrest for exposing jurors whose husbands were in the Mueller probe.
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  Oh, he's such a tough CIA agent. He wants to sink the president and never get face down.
[40:44.000 --> 40:50.000]  Well, Rand Paul just exposed his ass. I'm public. My name's out in the open.
[40:50.000 --> 40:57.000]  My phones are tapped because I support America. I got the criminal deep state up my rear end.
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  Let's go to Joe Biggs. He's with Free Speech TV and the great work over there with Gavin McGinnis.
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  Glad to have been kept him off the air. Former importers reporter. Joe, you've been there.
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  The judge just threatened everybody and says, don't talk about anything in here.
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  Well, nobody's ever supposed to be like that. I mean, this is crazy.
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  And other people I talked to are just too scared to even come on here.
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  Hell, they're calling for my arrest for just exposing what this judge is doing. These people are crazy.
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  But you notice there are facades coming down. The impeachment fiasco is collapsing. Total lies.
[41:27.000 --> 41:33.000]  Now they're saying CIA, Ramallah is not a whistleblower. In fact, there's just not one.
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  I mean, this is crazy. What have you been witnessing? I know the jury's out for Roger right now.
[41:38.000 --> 41:43.000]  Yeah, so we're standing outside of the Barrett Prettyman Courthouse in Washington, D.C.,
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  where the jury is currently deliberating over what they're going to do.
[41:48.000 --> 41:55.000]  You know, we're expecting it to be just not good. You know, we've seen that this has been a hit from the get-go,
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  but we're all hoping for the best. You know, one of the jurors got sick.
[41:58.000 --> 42:04.000]  She was a lady that would actually kind of snarl at the sight of Roger. So she's not been replaced with someone else.
[42:04.000 --> 42:11.000]  So that could be good news. You never know. But what we've seen is just complete and total BS from the prosecution.
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  They don't have anything. They're trying to word stuff a certain way.
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.000]  So it comes off to the jury as if it were wrongdoing when, in fact, it's not wrongdoing.
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  A lot of the stuff that they're going after Roger for things that already happened after the president was elected.
[42:24.000 --> 42:31.000]  It really has no bearing on the entire narrative that this helped influence the election of Donald Trump.
[42:31.000 --> 42:38.000]  So we just see it's a giant kangaroo court, you know, and it's sad that it's come to the point where it's the Department of Injustice.
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  There's no more justice here that whenever the president goes after someone and actually calls out wrongdoing
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  and the Democrats, what do they do? They flip it and go after him.
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  They flip it and they go after someone else that he cares about, someone close to him.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  And that's what we're seeing happening right here today.
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  That's right. And we're learning a lot from the final days of the prosecution.
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  You'll learn about exclusively straight ahead.
[42:58.000 --> 43:08.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[43:08.000 --> 43:14.000]  I could see where the globalists were going. I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[43:14.000 --> 43:22.000]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be de-platformed, that they were really setting the president to take everybody off air,
[43:22.000 --> 43:33.000]  to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.000]  It was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced,
[43:44.000 --> 43:50.000]  because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[43:50.000 --> 43:56.000]  And that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[44:02.000 --> 44:10.000]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit?
[44:12.000 --> 44:19.000]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[44:19.000 --> 44:25.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[44:25.000 --> 44:34.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist, or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the guy.
[44:34.000 --> 44:44.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  Oxford's banned clapping.
[44:50.000 --> 44:59.000]  University of the U.S. has banned 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[44:59.000 --> 45:06.000]  Beto Roark came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles.
[45:06.000 --> 45:12.000]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that he was a hero.
[45:12.000 --> 45:13.000]  Think about that.
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.000]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[45:17.000 --> 45:26.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  They know what they're doing.
[45:28.000 --> 45:36.000]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[45:40.000 --> 45:49.000]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens.
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[45:59.000 --> 46:10.000]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War when 3 million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  More than 50 to 1 some estimates have it.
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.000]  But the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told, General, we're completely surrounded.
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.000]  He said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  And it really is epic. It really is biblical.
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  And we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[46:33.000 --> 46:40.000]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete.
[46:40.000 --> 46:52.000]  And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[46:52.000 --> 46:58.000]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform, that checkmate's the globalist.
[47:22.000 --> 47:42.000]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  I'll tell you, I'm not somebody that acts like I have empathy.
[47:46.000 --> 47:52.000]  I'm not somebody that acts like I'm concerned about somebody unless I really am.
[47:52.000 --> 47:59.000]  And I'm really surprised how much I'm worried about Roger Stone.
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  I mean, I like the guy. I know the guy. He's a man. I'm a man.
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  He knows the business he's in. It's a dangerous game fighting these tyrants.
[48:07.000 --> 48:19.000]  Watch them systematically rig the media, rig the indictment, rig the jury, and to learn the judge laughing and snorting and cackling and not letting him have any of his witnesses.
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  And then to learn what was in the prosecution as they closed, making it all about Trump.
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.000]  He was never allowed to make it about politics, but the prosecutors, oh, I've got it all right here.
[48:29.000 --> 48:38.000]  USA Today, prosecutor says Roger Stone lied to Congress to protect Trump. And they go on to say it's proof of the Russians when there was no proof.
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.000]  Stone couldn't bring into evidence that they admitted that they had no proof of a Russian act.
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.000]  The judge said it's not political. It's not about Russians. You can't bring that in.
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  It's all about you lying to Congress, which he didn't do.
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  But then they all make it about Russia and she lets them.
[48:56.000 --> 49:01.000]  When you sit there and you watch a rigged game.
[49:01.000 --> 49:17.000]  And you see the things they do. And then the judge has their operatives call for me to be arrested in the Washington Post for her trying to appoint the head of an Obama cabinet position, whose husband was on the Mueller report.
[49:17.000 --> 49:26.000]  I mean, it's like the Sierra Mala guy is involved in the whole Biden thing involved in the meetings running it.
[49:26.000 --> 49:31.000]  And we're not supposed to say his name. We're supposed to just let him take down the president. These people are sick.
[49:31.000 --> 49:40.000]  And as soon as Congress demanded, he testified they first leaned on big tech to censor anybody that said his name.
[49:40.000 --> 49:47.000]  And now he says, actually, I'm not a whistleblower. Actually, I didn't hear anything. I heard the third hand. Oh, will they get indicted for lying?
[49:47.000 --> 49:53.000]  Will they get indicted? No, no, no, no, no, no, it's just Roger Stone.
[49:53.000 --> 50:00.000]  They want to put in prison if he gets convicted of all six counts for as long as 55 years.
[50:00.000 --> 50:07.000]  And in federal prison, that's about 50 years you'll serve. He's almost 70.
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.000]  And they're gunning for me, folks. They tried to set me up with fake Russian stuff. They tried to set me up with child porn.
[50:12.000 --> 50:18.000]  Thank God nobody buys it. Let's go to Joe Biggs. Joe, you were inside there. You witnessed all of this.
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.000]  You were on fire last night when I talked to you just rattling off everything that happened.
[50:21.000 --> 50:25.000]  Then I talked to I talked to other reporters. They confirmed what you were saying.
[50:25.000 --> 50:35.000]  And we let's talk about what happened in there. And then let's talk about what's going to happen if he is convicted, the operation free Roger Stone.
[50:35.000 --> 50:41.000]  Well, it's one of the interesting things, too, that I've noticed that I've really picked up on inside the courtroom when listening to the prosecution.
[50:41.000 --> 50:49.000]  It's just the condescending attitude towards our president. Whenever they bring up President Trump, they call him Trump.
[50:49.000 --> 50:54.000]  They call him, they never want to ever call him Otis and never want to call him president.
[50:54.000 --> 51:00.000]  It's just when he does this, when he's talked to Trump, when he's done this, they never give the respect that this man deserves.
[51:00.000 --> 51:08.000]  He won an election against the rig system. And now we have this party that is still doing everything they can to go after this man.
[51:08.000 --> 51:14.000]  Why? Because he simply wants to make the country great. And everything that he's done that's been good, they try to demonize it.
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.000]  They try to flip it on him. He wants to call out corruption from the Bidens. What are they doing now?
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  They have these impeachment hearings. They want to call out the corruption of Hillary Clinton.
[51:22.000 --> 51:27.000]  Then we have this whole entire Russian investigation. It's all complete and total BS.
[51:27.000 --> 51:31.000]  They're pandering, they're pushing everything off, but they just have no respect.
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.000]  There's no respect from anybody in this town or our president.
[51:35.000 --> 51:42.000]  And it's sad because he's been doing a damn amazing job. And it's sad to see someone like Roger Stone, such a stand-up guy, to be out here.
[51:42.000 --> 51:47.000]  He's dedicated his life to serving this country, to see people walk all over him, to throw him under the bus,
[51:47.000 --> 51:55.000]  because he simply supports a man that he knew from day one years ago would have the best chance at saving this country.
[51:55.000 --> 51:58.000]  And it's just sad to see this kind of stuff happen.
[51:58.000 --> 52:05.000]  Well, they know that Roger knows all of Trump's secrets, and they think if they squeeze him hard enough, he'll make something up.
[52:05.000 --> 52:12.000]  And they're also, again, mad that he advised the president very, very successfully, and that Trump was talking to him basically every day,
[52:12.000 --> 52:18.000]  sometimes for hours, and that he was just as important as Steve Bannon or others in the White House.
[52:18.000 --> 52:25.000]  And then when they open the fake Russia and get investigation into Stone, remember for over a year and a half before he got indicted,
[52:25.000 --> 52:32.000]  that's when Trump wouldn't talk to him anymore because his lawyers said, oh, don't talk to him. They'll think you're obstructing.
[52:32.000 --> 52:37.000]  So that's how they paralyzed Trump from any of his support base.
[52:37.000 --> 52:43.000]  And now they've moved on to Ukraine, and there's got to be some pushback here. They've got to get in trouble.
[52:43.000 --> 52:48.000]  Yeah, I mean, anyone who supported this president has been guilty from day one. They've already found him.
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.000]  He's the bad guy, and now they're creating these issues.
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  They're creating these crimes, and then they're trying to backtrack to find proof to something.
[52:56.000 --> 53:02.000]  And then if they stumble upon something along the way, then that's when the whole narrative changes and it switches from one thing to the next.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  But they're simply trying to find him on anything they can.
[53:05.000 --> 53:10.000]  They need just whatever dirt they can, but the guy is doing an amazing job, and they just can't do it.
[53:10.000 --> 53:17.000]  And Teflon Don keeps shooting them down. But it's sad to see people like Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, they're going to have to take the fall.
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.000]  What we're seeing right now, Michael Flynn, his case might get thrown out.
[53:21.000 --> 53:25.000]  And if that happens, that gives us a really good chance in the future for Roger.
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.000]  But right now, we just can hope and pray, man. We've got to sit here. We've got friends here. We've got family.
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  We're doing everything we can to support this man, and I know everybody out there watching InfoWars right now watching the show.
[53:35.000 --> 53:43.000]  They love Roger, and he knows that. We talk about it at nighttime, and he's just extremely grateful to have such a huge family from this.
[53:43.000 --> 53:47.000]  And it brings tears to our eyes. It's hard to be here.
[53:47.000 --> 53:54.000]  What is it like for you, Joe, who they've de-platformed? You're a soldier, you're a veteran.
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  We're not whims. We expect to get attacked.
[53:56.000 --> 54:04.000]  But to watch the persecution, the crimes that all of us have gone through, to be physically attacked, that if you fight back, you get sent to prison.
[54:04.000 --> 54:12.000]  And to see the arrogance of these people never getting in trouble, being caught in criminal hoax after criminal hoax after criminal hoax.
[54:12.000 --> 54:18.000]  But I think it's coming to the end, even when AP calls the fake impeachment a scam.
[54:18.000 --> 54:24.000]  And the witnesses all go, I just heard it third or fourth hand, and now they admit there is no original whistleblower,
[54:24.000 --> 54:29.000]  because no one wants to say they heard what they heard because it didn't happen.
[54:29.000 --> 54:35.000]  That is incredible. But Chris Wallace says it was stunning and powerful and Trump's in trouble.
[54:35.000 --> 54:42.000]  And then to watch people defending the hoax, I mean, I'm just wondering where all this goes. It's insane.
[54:42.000 --> 54:47.000]  I mean, you know what they say, you know, this kind of stuff happens with people that can handle it.
[54:47.000 --> 54:56.000]  And I see right now the people that we have, the president that we have, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, you know, Jacob Beagle, all these guys here with me right now,
[54:56.000 --> 55:02.000]  Enrique Tario, I mean, we can take this on. We can take being banned. We can take being censored and all that.
[55:02.000 --> 55:06.000]  We can stand up against it and continue to fight and continue to move forward, just like you've done.
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.000]  You know, you've been banned everywhere as well, and you're continuing to fight on.
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  And we're the people that are meant to be here to deal with this fight.
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.000]  And luckily, I believe we'll come out on top, but we're going to have a few speed bumps on the way.
[55:17.000 --> 55:18.000]  We're going to have to keep our head held high.
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.000]  But I think at the end, we will come out victorious and we will win.
[55:21.000 --> 55:32.000]  Well, you just said it that God literally has chosen all of us, the listeners, the viewers, this family of a race, color and creed, the bleed red blood for this moment.
[55:32.000 --> 55:39.000]  The globalists in Hollywood and the trillions of stolen dollars, they all believe they're invincible because they have the mainstream media.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  They have the money, but all of that's crap.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  Once the people don't believe their lives anymore.
[55:43.000 --> 55:50.000]  And I believe we've already reached that tipping point and Epstein blew a giant hole in their ship of lies and they're sinking.
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  And that's not wishful thinking. They're sinking. Here's the problem.
[55:53.000 --> 55:58.000]  They're trying to take us down with them so that we don't have maximum effort here.
[55:58.000 --> 56:04.000]  It's like Gandalf when he knocks the borag off the cliff, but the borag puts the whip up and grabs us by the leg.
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  We need to be looking for that so that we don't get taken down with it.
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  That's all I'm saying. I get chills when I say it.
[56:10.000 --> 56:15.000]  Yes, we're winning, but we've got to be maximum engaged here or they're going to take us down with them.
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  And I mean the whole damn planet, Joe.
[56:18.000 --> 56:23.000]  Look at these young men and women right now that are standing up in their states and their districts and they're running for Congress.
[56:23.000 --> 56:28.000]  The first speed bump that you have in doing that is just getting over that fear.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  Can I do it? And going to do in the paperwork.
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.000]  You got Enrique here. We've got Laura Loomer. We've got Catalina Hoffman.
[56:33.000 --> 56:38.000]  We've got all these different people all over the country right now standing up and saying, you know what? I can make a difference.
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  I'm part of this generation right now that's had everything thrown at it.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  We've been banished everywhere.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  Stay there. I'll come right back to you. Two minute break.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  I want to come back to you, Joe. You're absolutely right.
[56:48.000 --> 56:54.000]  And again, if it wasn't for all these ragtag reporters, folks, we wouldn't know what's going on in that courtroom.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  Instead, the media's lies would just win.
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  But you're getting the truth. You're getting the reality.
[56:58.000 --> 57:02.000]  We bust our ass to not exaggerate, but to bring you what's really going on.
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  And everybody's starting to see that no matter how crazy the stuff is, I've talked about in our guest staff.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  It's all real, folks. It's all real, except it's worse than we said.
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  In fact, we have, we have stirred you wrong.
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  We, it's worse than we thought. And you know that, too.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  We're all in this together. We'll come right back with Joe Beggs.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  Please don't forget, I barely haven't plugged the sour.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  Without you supporting us financially, they will win.
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  And it is hit or miss right now. Everything counts.
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  InfoWarsStore.com. InfoWarsLife.com.
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  We have the new Big Black Friday sales here.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  Storewide free shipping, double-patriot points.
[57:34.000 --> 57:41.000]  And we have the new Super Silver whitening toothpaste with the patented nano silver
[57:41.000 --> 57:48.000]  and the above-sea oral calcium that re-mineralizes the teeth.
[57:48.000 --> 57:55.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  that without you, we won't be on the air.
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.000]  and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres.
[58:07.000 --> 58:14.000]  Something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there,
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  the air filtration, the water filtration.
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[58:23.000 --> 58:29.000]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[58:29.000 --> 58:33.000]  So it's not a burden to support InfoWars.
[58:33.000 --> 58:40.000]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.000]  and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[58:44.000 --> 58:49.000]  So visit infowarsstore.com today.
[58:49.000 --> 58:55.000]  InfoWars life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet,
[58:55.000 --> 58:59.000]  Super Silver whitening toothpaste.
[58:59.000 --> 59:05.000]  This is proprietary. This is with the top lab in the country, and it is incredibly high quality.
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[59:08.000 --> 59:12.000]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria.
[59:12.000 --> 59:16.000]  It recalcifies the teeth. It does so many things on so many fronts.
[59:16.000 --> 59:24.000]  These beautiful tubes of Super Silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates.
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.000]  It's as low as we can go, and they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.000]  Super Silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit.
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[59:34.000 --> 59:39.000]  I want to thank my father, a retired dentist, for spearheading this the last two years and developing it.
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  That's as low as we can go, because it's very, very expensive to produce.
[59:45.000 --> 59:59.000]  Get yours today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Joe Beggs is our guest. I'm going to talk about the real nature of the fight and where we are.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  We come back in the next segment, and I'm going to open the phones up throughout the broadcast.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  Paul Watson is going to host the fourth hour.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  So much is happening. So much is unfolding that you've just got my commitment that I'm going to turn the heat up even more.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  We tend to get negative about how corrupt the globalist are, but we're forcing that all out in the open.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  But Joe, I want to talk about this.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  The judge has really intimidated everybody and really threatened, and we know is going to absolutely, once she gets this guilty verdict, throw the book at Stone.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  They've telegraphed to Stone if he just doesn't respond and rolls over to their fake trial that they might not give him the whole 50-something years.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  But we are going to have to stand up for Stone, and we're going to have to speak up for Stone.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  And as soon as I was making some calls this morning, people are like, well, we don't want to get Stone in trouble.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  We don't want to get in trouble with this judge. This judge is not God, folks.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  She called for my arrest last week, and then the whole law profession said, no, what he did is totally legal, and this is dangerous to have a judge saying, you can't question jurors.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  Juror infos public. Okay, doesn't matter if MSNBC says it isn't. But I can tell people that this is what Rogers wishes are.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  And so it's not just me up here coming up with a plan, free Rogers Stone.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  That's Rogers' right, if he's wrongfully convicted, to watch the media, you'll say it's not, to call for the president to pardon him.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  And he helped get Sheriff Arpaio, pardon, we did, and Arpaio came on and thanked us and said the president, said he learned about it from Imple Wars and Rogers Stone.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  He didn't know that a judge had found Arpaio guilty, wouldn't let him have a jury trial, was going to put him in jail for seven years for contempt.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  So that channel between Trump and Stone is so important, and it's ongoing because of the Secret Service and others.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  But just going back to Joe Biggs, Joe, obviously you've been let in on the plan, and if and when he is convicted, which I would expect will be this afternoon or tomorrow.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  It's good news, the longer they're out, they've been out three hours now. We need everyone to go to the White House and surround it for days.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  We need more and more people to come there for due process and for justice, and to say and to chant free Rogers Stone.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Your comments on that.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  No, I agree 100%. I mean, that's something that should definitely be done.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  And like I said, the outcome of this shouldn't deter people from continuing to fight.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Right now, that means we need to push harder. We need to fight back harder. We need to make our voices louder.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  We need to go out here in the streets. We need to do more videos. We need to expose more corruption.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  The work that you guys are doing, Project Veritas, all of us out here are coming together to expose this cancerous DC element.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  And we need to do everything we can to fight back. We need to do it for Roger. We need to do it for our country. We need to do it for our family and our future.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  And that's why I'm so proud to see these guys around me here.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  That's why I feel good to have friends like this, because when you see someone like Roger and the character of Roger, have these kind of people around him that care about him.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  It shows you what kind of a good man he is.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  And when you see the amount of people that are standing up for our president right now through everything, it shows you that we're doing the right thing.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  So right now, as dark as this looks at this time, we still need to just push through, track through, and continue kicking ass.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  And I think that's something that we're going to have to do. And we're not doing it for ourselves. We're doing it for Roger.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  He wants to see us continue to take down these people.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  Well, Jacob Ingalls and others are going to be joining us later. And as soon as the trial's over, we're going to be able to really unload on just how rigged this was.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  I've been asked not to get to it yet by a lot of parties, obviously, people very close to Roger, very close.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  And it's just, it's truly been a three-ring circus.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  But I think that's the silver lining here, and I'm not just making lemonade out of lemons here, Joe.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  They convicted innocent man. They put the president's component in jail.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  That's a message to everybody that we've got to fight even harder, and it shows what tyrants they are.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  They think this intimidates us. I know this just makes all of us fight harder.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Well, you know, you take the most flack when you're over the target, and right now we're taking a whole lot of flack.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  I bless you, Joe Biggs at Prespeech.tv with the great Gavin McGinnis. Thank you. Please check in with us.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  The minute that verdict comes out, you just, any show we've got going, buddy, you call us, you're on, you've got the producer's number.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  We love you, Joe. Can't wait to see you in person again, get dinner.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  All right, we'll be right here. I can't wait to see Stone again and get some dinner, man. I love the guy more than ever now. Gosh.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to? How far will they go? What's their limit?
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will. There's no devil or the God.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  Oxford's banned clapping.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  University of the U.S. has banned 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:06.000]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  You had some things to hide.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a question for you.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  From Roger Stone, who's got a gag ball in his mouth politically right now and who is facing certain conviction in my view any minute now at the hands of a true kangaroo court and the Red Cross.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  And that's who Roger Stone really is, not his chief political advisor. He's that too. But he is Trump's wingman.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  And that's what you get for being a president.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  And that's what you get for being this great president's wingman of 44 years is solitary confinement.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  That's where they put Manafort.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  By the way, folks that know Manafort, smart, tough, won the election for Trump, stopped the delegate theft, wouldn't have Trump without him.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  He didn't pay taxes like all these other rich people. He was offshore and they even had previous waivers from the Justice Department for what he did.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  But they burned him for the things they routinely do and that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden have done.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  But with Stone, he's completely innocent.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  And so at the bottom of the hour, I've got Roger's message through me to you.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  And I'm just going to leave it at that. I have to be very, very careful about what I say because they'll try to use it to put him in prison longer.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  But I obviously have talked to Roger and I'm not going to bow down to these criminals. We have three speech in this country.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  I have consulted more than nine attorneys now, many of them known as being preeminent when it comes to law, but I don't need them.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  I remember in my family law case, the judge gagged my ex-wife and my lawyers said, that's unconstitutional and we didn't try to uphold the gag order because there's nothing to hide.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  So I mean, I've been around this rodeo a lot and gag orders are not real unless it's children or something like that.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  They're not. And this is bigger than Roger Stone and I keep saying that because I don't just want you to have empathy.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  I want everybody to understand this is a skeleton key, a keyhole view and the things, a Rosetta Stone, a microcosm of everything.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  So I'll talk about a big victory right now before I get into anything negative because the two are bound at the hip.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  The fact that that bug-eyed, pencil-neck, central casting, pedophile, aesthetics, I'll say he's a pedophile.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  Adam Schiff tried to suppress five billion people on terra firma, this planet, the surface of this ball.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  The fact that he tried for the last two weeks working with big tech and five billion internet users out of seven and a half billion people to say you couldn't say or print the name Eric Sierra Mala
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  This is a bird's-eye view. It's a 35,000-foot view. It's a one-inch away view. It's an electron microscope view. It's a spectometer view. It's a radio telescope view.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  It's everything. The Hutzpah, the Bravada, the reckless, beady-eyed hubris, the insolence, the snakiness, the creepiness.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  Of this man is incredible. And all of big tech in unison, like a team of horses, trained, you know how hard it is to get two horses to work together, three horses, four horses, six horses is about the most you can get pulling a big old carriage.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  And boy, those horses have got to be just absolutely the best, totally trained. They usually have dogs as what Dalmatians are running in their legs to keep them in line.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  They bite them if they don't do what they're supposed to. I mean, the fact that they had big tech in the whole corporate media in lockstep saying arrest Senator Paul, arrest Don Jr., arrest Alex Jones. Oh, they had that about me, too, saying Eric Sierra Mala went under jurisprudence, common law, federal law, state law, first amendment.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  This person supposedly firsthand heard Trump doing something illegal.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  And so he wants to challenge anybody, a bookkeeper, a maid, an auto mechanic, a police officer, a factory worker, a farmer, or the president of the United States. We're all equal when it comes to our damn due process that people have fought for 800 years for.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  805 years since running me since Magna Carta.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  That a man's homeless is castle that people have got to have a jury of their peers that they get to face their accusers.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  The fact that they would try to do that and then get the entire media, Fox News included, Twitter, Facebook, Google, YouTube, banning hundreds of thousands of people that would type his name or AI listening to streams.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  It was in the news.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  You say his name, they can scan that file instantly when it uploads or when it's complete. The computer sees his name and takes the video down.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  That's AI control. See that's why I say it's a Rosetta Stone. It's all these angles.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  It's the AI takeover. It's them butchering due process. It's them trying to overthrow an election of the people. And it's the arrogance of it with a weird beady eyed snake.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  Like the snake from Jungle Book tried to hypnotize us. You wouldn't buy a used car from that guy. You wouldn't have dinner with that guy. You wouldn't go fishing with Schiff. You wouldn't turn your back on him.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  I mean the guy looks like a pedophile just like Ryan Stelter and most of them up there are.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  Hell you can't swing a stick and not hit one. Everybody sees that now. It's a cult.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile. He just looks like an evil pedophile.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  Now I'm sorry. What he is doing is raping our due process. And then Rand Paul last week was like well I'll say his name if I want to.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  That's totally legal and awful. They all freak out and flap their wings and then Rand Paul releases it.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  And now everybody's saying the name like Jeffrey Epstein and they don't know what to do and they're freaking out even more.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  And it's just so good to see their bluff called. But at one level I'm like how the hell did they almost complete that?
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  How did they have my phone ringing off the hook knowing you released the name of the whistleblower. You could get arrested.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  Or you released the name of a juror and tried to tamper them. I'm like that he tried to tamper.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  The woman's husband instead worked for Mueller on the damn probe. Of course this woman can't be on the Jerry.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  My exposing corruption is not corruption. I am not corrupt. I don't like corruption. I can't stand it.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  It's like I don't like finding a cockroach in my dinner.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  I don't like it. All these globalists they love it. So we'll play those clips when we come back. But part of me feels good.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Hey this whole thing's collapsing. But we let them get that far and big tech in the media are in such lockstep like robots.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  That when they say don't show a Taiwanese flag don't cover their peace movements. Don't show Alex Jones' name in a positive mention.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  The fact that Zuckerberg tells people you only talk bad about him like he's some damn cult leader. He was out in the farmhouse with 20 followers.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  He'd be in a nut house. But because he has all the control he's got.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  We all agree these are troubled times right. So do you know who's on your wireless network. Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker.

[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps general in the Korean War when 3 million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  But the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told general were completely surrounded he said good we can attack in all directions.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  Well that's the point that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete and it's not just Americans but folks all over the world are completely silenced.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  When it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars having its own platform that checkmates the globalist.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true but I'm here to tell you most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball I could see where the globalists were going I could see what their in game agenda was what their goal was.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  And I knew that when they were setting a sub PD platform that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:20:00.000]  That's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  Yeah old Adam Schiff is big buddies with Ed Buck the guy indicted for all the folks that are dying over there from meth overdoses at his house.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  They're a real real couple there.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  And that's the guy that just has that demonic energy to always double down and always put out bigger hoaxes and bigger lies and so after telling the world you can't say the name of the whistleblower that firsthand heard Trump commit the crime even though all the other witnesses including those hostile the president
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  say the same thing was in the transcripts but Chris Wallace and Fox News and others just oh it's bombshell did you hear the voice of that ambassador like Edward R Murrow.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  But even AP calls it a scam they just say there's nothing there.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  Because you flush Trump and Roger Stone and Alex Jones down the toilet even if you hate us you're flushing your own due process in your own rights down the toilet.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  Oh yeah now they're calling the death of these black men sacrifices.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  He's at Ed Bucks meth mansion. Feds probe Adam Schiff dressed like Egyptian at bizarre sacrifice parties at Ed Bucks meth mansion 14 hours ago see I didn't even know that.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  That's true pundit and Rolling Stone has an article about as well.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  I didn't even know that I was telling you that he's a devil worshipping pedophile.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  Look at the man in my God. You're not in the club unless you are. I mean my God they put out Twitter ads the lawyer the whistleblower saying I'll get pedophiles national security clearances.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  I love to go to water parks by myself. Here I am a little kids behind me. I love to go to Disney World. Oh my gosh I love prepubescent girls.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  And I like Jeffrey Epstein. I'd be proud to be associated with Jeffrey Epstein when they busted his island and put him back in prison.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  Oh but they want you to show how tolerant you are and have federally funded big fat man and a clown outfit time with your kid they call it drag queen story time.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  So that's who these boys are.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  And it's in the diaries and the reports that.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  Buck was killing people on purpose.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  And they would beg and he'd grab that incredible force like big black man. He's a little white he would grab it.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  I'm liberal. Let me tell you liberal.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  Give me your children liberal.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  You take one look at shift size. That's a demon walking the earth.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  And you wonder why it doesn't stop. Why it's not why it lies constantly. That's what demons do.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  And it wants to take full control.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  And however they can kill people they're going to do it.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  Because they want to kill us.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  The Bible says they come to kill, steal and destroy.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  Reportedly Ed Buck would tackle black man who would cry and beg crawling away as he would plunge needles into them.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  And his over at his house.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  Mr. Schiff dressed as an Egyptian God.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  And I don't know how all this stuff works but they particularly like to get black people.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  Some weird ass stuff man. Hillary and her foundation head got caught shipping all those little black kids out of Haiti a bunch of them ended up dead.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  Disappeared.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  You haven't heard damn word out of Van Jones man.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  Jones knows full well they got a taste for black meat.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  They know those devil worshipers want that blood. They're going to get it.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  They're going to get the black babies too.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  And then Jones ain't going to say nothing about it.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  Because he knows where he gets the money from.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  So he can point at me and say I'm the racist because I don't want to kill the black babies.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  And every other damn baby they can get their hands on.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Remember those Aleister Crowley sex rituals. They like the walnut sauce. They want the brown babies.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  That's what that is.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  And they're going to get your babies.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  And you're going to like them for it.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  Because they're liberal.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  And remember who else dressed up in Egyptian outfits.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  Aleister Crowley.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  And what do they do in the WikiLeaks.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  They dress up in the Egyptian outfits and they go and they get them some black people for it.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  Because back in the rituals the Pharaohs were getting the Africans.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Pharaohs were some type of weird hybrid group.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  Seen those skeletons. Don't look too human to me.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  And they were killing the black people.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  Oh, it's so liberal.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  So walnut sauce those black people.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  Let's make sure we ban Lady and the Tramp because it's racist.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  But you want to dress up like Pharaoh and a quote human sacrifice ritual.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  And some black men go out the door dead.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  Well, that's all right because you're Adam Schiff and you got little bug eyes.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  Like a snake laser beams going to get you on target attack attack attack.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  That's all he does 24 seven.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  He's going to get you America.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  He's going to get your kids.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  Oh, he's going to get him.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  And now he says he doesn't know anything about a whistleblower.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  He's never heard a word of what what there's no such thing.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  You're like you just lied to my face.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  Give me your children.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  Give me your children.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  Give them the chairman.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  Give them to me.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  Sorry.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  Wouldn't it just be better if we let him run the country like he runs California in his own district hundreds of thousands homeless total destruction.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  You know, why do they do that?
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  Because when you're one of these things, that's what you like to see a starving people, desperate people drugged out of their minds.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  You like the wavelength.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  You like the spirit.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  Then California lately just just get just bad.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  You just feel empty.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  You want to get out of there as the planes coming in.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  You feel it because it's a big vampire kingdom.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  And they're having a lot of fun down there with men, women and children, especially the children.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  You know what?
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  Let's go to this clip because I haven't gotten to the clips yet.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  Shift says he does not know identity of the whistleblower.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  So now Eric Ciaramella was the whistleblower, but now he knows nothing.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  Here it is.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  Just to ask a clarifying question, do you anticipate when we might vote on the ability to have the whistleblower in front of us?
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  Something you, the 435 members of Congress, you are the only member who knows who that individual is.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  And your staff is the only staff of any member of Congress is at a chance to talk with that individual.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  We would like that opportunity.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  When might that happen in this proceeding today?
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  First, as the gentleman knows, that's a false statement.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  I do not know the identity of the whistleblower, and I'm determined to make sure that identity is protected.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  But as I said to Mr. Conaway, you will have an opportunity after the witnesses testify to make a motion to subpoena any witness and compel a vote.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  By the way, it's known that Eric Ciaramella is the final staffer.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  They said, hey kid, you're the one caught in the corruption.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  You're going to say you heard it, okay?
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  Well, just don't say who I am.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  I mean, I won't have to testify.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  I'm a little chicken neck whip.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  I'm CIA.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  I'm Rambo.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  I'm tough.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  I've got a little chicken neck like shift.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  I'm supposed to rule all these slaves.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  I can help you too.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  Your Family Survival to SurvivalistCamps.com
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the Info Wars family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air.
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  Something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  So it's not a burden to support Info Wars. It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  So visit InfoWarsStore.com today.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to? How far will they go? What's their limit?
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the God.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  Oxford's banned clapping. Universities in the US have banned 21 guns to loot for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times, I will never give in. I will never give up, but I could give out.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity, to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com and banned.video.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at infowords.com forward slash show and banned.video.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:57.000]  So take heart, folks. They've had to censor everybody and shut everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  We're going to knock the globalists dead. I can feel the spirit of life and our destiny pouring in to this plane. This planet is preparing to go to the next level.
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  There's going to be a long struggle and a long war against Satan's forces, but I can tell you I can see the other side and we're going to make it through the enemy and leave Satan behind us in the hell he's already created as we jump into the future.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Knock them dead. I am fired up today, boy, because their entire impeachment hoax has collapsed into a giant slag heap, but they're going to rebuild it again.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  That's how globalism works. Right as their world government, AI finally goes live. Sometimes in the next few decades, maybe even sooner, it will be collapsing from the moment it materializes.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  And so, yes, the fight goes on and yes, they're going to relaunch again and again, but the devil worship and Satanism of Schiff is coming out in the mainstream news and Ed Buck and I'm glad the crew reminded me of that.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  And I already know all this stuff, so I'm just up here saying he's a devil and they're like, yeah, it's in the news, actually. All it's the Crowley rituals with the black people trying to escape.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  And they got movies like, you know, get out and I'm over there on TI show in LA and he's like, you haven't heard about how white people invite blacks over and then kill them and eat them.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  And I'm like, well, that's not what any Christians do. But see, that's why black folks in LA won't even go to a white person's house because they'll kill your ass.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  And they're called Democrats. They're really called devil worshipers. And you see folks, I'm saying all this fantastic crazy stuff and it's mainstream news.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  This back of the paper, okay, they like to dress up like Egyptians and do rituals and they call them black people dying, but it's okay because he's liberal.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  And he's got little bug eyes.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  If you pulled up to take your child and check out a highly rated daycare, say your two year old daughter or son and no matter how high rated it was, you walked in and the headmaster walked out and was Adam Schiff looked like Adam Schiff had those eyes.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  You'd get creepy crawlies up and down the back of your neck and you'd say, actually, I'm late for a meeting. I forgot. I gotta go.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  And you would drive out of that parking lot quickly and you'd feel sorry for the kids that were there.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  You know what I mean? You have instincts for a reason.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  I was telling TI off here. I said, hey, you're coming in for South by Southwest.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  Go to my house, meet my family, man. I swear to God, the average white person doesn't want to hurt black people.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  He's like, man, I'm not going to white people's house. They end up killing us when they're in there.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  Habits you've seen get out and I go, man, that's some leftist Hollywood movie. That's not really goes well. That actually does go on.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  You're the one talking about all this occult stuff. You don't know about this. How white people get black people.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  And I go, actually, I do know about the Clintons doing that. And I do know about that. You keep saying it's Trump. Trump's never done that.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  But see, that's how crazy all this is.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  And then Hollywood knows this type of stuff is going on and they make a movie about it.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  But they say the white people want to kill you because they're racist.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  No, the white people are killing white people too. And there are some black devil worshipers.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  They get into voodoo and stuff, but you don't really find a lot of black folks.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  I've studied it that are kidnapping kids and raping them and having sex with them and stuff.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  There seems to be a taboo there. Now some racist black guys will grab white kids and pour gasoline on them and kill them in Alabama and Michigan in places.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  That kind of stuff goes on. But it is true that I've noticed a pattern of black people being targeted by Alistair Crowleyites.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  And I've studied a lot of that stuff and I'm going to go back and research it again and I've got a good idea why they do that.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  But I don't want to say it on air because I need to go refresh my memory.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  But see now, now I know why TI was telling me about black people getting grabbed up by folks in LA and disappearing because that really goes on.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  Now Millie Weber is going to be with us for a couple segments coming up next segment.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  She's got really big important news.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  But I'm wound up right now because the zeitgeist is on fire and we're all tuned into it intellectually.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  I'm very excited and spiritually I'm very excited.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  You know, people go to a football game and when they're there and they see their team, they've been fans up for 30 years, win the Super Bowl and you're on the 50 yard line.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  And you just feel elated for days and you're on cloud nine with the endorphins and the adrenaline.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  Well, I'm like that when I see each step of their fraud failing and I see them failing on every front.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  It makes me get really, really excited and makes me think the good Lord above my guiding light.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  And I just want to thank the listeners and the viewers as well because a lot of bad stuff is going on.
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  But we are pulling away from the globalist and humanity is making its decision.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  And a lot of people are waking up right now and it's going to get rough with the AI and other levels of the seduction.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  So I don't want to tell people that we won this thing yet like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  Let's not start doing you know what yet, but there's not just evil in this universe and it's the animating contest of liberty opposing evil that God wants to see.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  And it's in that opposition to evil and it's in the courage to stand against the evil and to go through the fire that you then find enlightenment and fulfillment at levels
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  that are just unbelievable. I mean, I am so much more fulfilled than I ever was when I was 20 years old and I was very happy fulfilled person.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  And so many people don't feel fulfilled because they're not carrying out their destiny.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  If you just take care of your children and a loving good person and stand up for what's right in little ways, you're fulfilling your destiny.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  You're not going to be fulfilled carrying out evil and corruption. It's just that simple.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  So I said I've got a message from Roger Stone to the world.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  If I would say when he's convicted by that kangaroo jury, maybe I'm wrong.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  Maybe God's going to intervene, but pray for Roger and I'll do that.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  The jury could come out at any moment, but I'm going to do that start of the next hour.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  Now I'm going to open the phones up and really we were going to write shotgun with the sum.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  The great work she's doing. So amazing.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  And that's really only the frustration I have is there's so much big bombshell stuff happening that it's hard to give any of it the proper coverage it needs.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  But shift attempting with corporate media and big tech to not let you know who the fake whistleblower was underpinning the entire fake impeachment of the president of the United States,
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  who's trying to restore power back to the Republic and get us on the right direction again.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  The fact that that's blown up and fallen apart and that they even tried that is incredible.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  So now they're not going to say that Eric Sierra Mala was the whistleblower.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  And I predicted when it came out that it was all just fake and there was nothing there.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  They just ordered him to say this, that they would suddenly say he was withdrawn and that's what's happened.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  This is just huge and that people understand what's happened.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  It isn't just some blip we forget in all the fog of war.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  It's devastating.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  We're going to go to break him back with Billy Weaver.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  Our mission to defeat the globalist is very, very simple.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  Study history, understand the enemy's plans and resist them and speak out and have courage and we'll beat them.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  But in the modern realm and the modern systems, it takes money to fund this thing.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  And if we had twice the money we have, I could radically expand things and absolutely defeat the enemy counter initiatives very, very quickly and easier,
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  where I could spend more time getting information out instead of going around just keeping the operation running,
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  which I absolutely hate doing because that distracts my energy from what I really need to be doing.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  I'll be out in armored vehicles and confronting globalists face to face every day.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  I'll be doing all sorts of stuff.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  So I'm just telling you, listeners, commit today to go to infowarstore.com.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  We have the big Black Friday sales of the gun, still store-wide free shipping.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  A lot of items sold out.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  A lot of new items came in.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  Really, one of the best items you should get is DNA Force Plus.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  It's back in stock with the PQQ, the CoQ10.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  It's 50% off, double Patriot points and also free shipping.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  And what it does for your telomeres and your cells is just everybody should be taking it, especially anybody above 40.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  A lot of great Patriot apparel as well at infowarstore.com.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  And we have the new above-sea coral calcium toothpaste that also re-generalizes the teeth and has the patented nano silver in it and is a whitening toothpaste.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  It's just amazing.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139 is about to sell out.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War,
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  when 3 million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  More than 50 to 1, some estimates have it.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  But the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told,
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  General, we're completely surrounded.
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  He said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  Well, that's the point that info wars has reached.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  And it really is epic.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  It really is biblical.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  And we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  When it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  Because by info wars having its own platform, that checkmates the globalist.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  Info wars life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet.
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  This is proprietary.
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  This is with the top lab in the country.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  And it is incredibly high quality.
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria.
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  It recalcifies the teeth.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  It does so many things on so many fronts.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  It's as low as we can go.
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  And they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  I want to thank my father, a retired dentist for spearheading this the last two years and developing it.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  It's as low as we can go because it's very, very expensive to produce. Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  I could see where the globalists were going.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  And I knew that when they were setting a sub-PD platform that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air, to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  It was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  And that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to? How far will they go? What's their limit?
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the God.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  Oxford's banned clapping. Universities in the US have banned 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, November 14, 2019, Global Transmission.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  Okay, so as a lot of you know, Sunday, we had Millie Weaver on and we broke down on the Sunday show.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  Eyewitnesses by name had recordings of the Secretary of State's office in Kentucky of immigrants who never voted.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  Names being put on the rolls as Democrats and Republicans who lived in other states for eight years being put on there.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  And it being an ongoing problem and then people voting in their names.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  Well, since then they've had press conferences with the governor.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  Other witnesses have come forward with the paperwork.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  It's massive. 175,000 names put back on the rolls by the Democrats months before giving the election to the Democrat.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  The governor's still contesting, but there's almost no news coverage of this.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  Well, Millie, we were covered it live and streamed it yesterday for Infowars.com. That's up on the site.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  But NBC has responded by saying in MSNBC that it's bots.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  The bots just went out and said Kentucky was stolen.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  Now, we've gotten all these documents as well, but see Millie Weaver's a bot.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  The governor's a bot. Those recordings of the Secretary of State are bots.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  Let's play some of the MSNBC disinformation report, the full reports on Infowars.com.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  But they turn you, you hear a witch hypothetically can turn somebody into a toadstool or a frog or a toad or a, you know, that doesn't exist.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  But the media can turn you when your identity is stolen by them by the Democrats and then they vote in your name.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  And you catch them. Well, they just say you're a bot. You're a Rusky. Here it is.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  It's reporting that last week's election in Kentucky could be a hint of things to come for all of us in 2020.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  According to the paper, quote, a few hours after polls closed in Kentucky last Tuesday,
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  a Twitter user posted a message to his 19 followers saying he had just shredded a box of Republican mail-in ballots.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  It wasn't true, but that seldom matters on social media anymore.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  In the Times reports, the account does not appear to be from Kentucky. For starters, Louisville was misspelled.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  Twitter has since suspended that account, yet the damage has been done and the false claim is still spreading on its own tonight.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  Oh, no, let's stop right there. Is it a false claim that Brian Williams said he got shot down on a helicopter by an RPG?
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  Well, that Hillary basically said the same thing about Serbia or Bosnia-Herzegovina. I mean, remember Brian Williams and then he's back lying to you.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  And then what they do is just like we had real devil worship in WikiLeaks.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  They, the media focuses on a pizza place, puts out this info. We cover what they're covering. They say it's from us.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  And then it discredits all the real stuff. It's the same thing.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  So somebody on Twitter said this that wasn't true. So all the rest of it isn't real. The damage has been done, Millie.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  It's incredible. Give us the latest on this. You evil bot.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  I know. I guess I'm a Russian bot because I'm a journalist that actually looks into allegations of voter fraud.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  Well, at the press conference yesterday outside the governor's office in the capital of Kentucky, there was a group that was called Kentucky
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  Citizens for Election Integrity and they presented evidence and sworn signed affidavits that a young man who is off to college living in Florida,
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  somehow he ended up voting in the Kentucky election despite the fact that he was over a thousand miles away.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  Problem is he didn't vote. His mother was the one who discovered that somebody had actually voted for him and signed for him.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  When she talked to the poll workers, they said somebody had presented an ID on his behalf and that's how come his signature was on the form.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  And this is crazy. This is evidence of voter fraud. And you know, Alex, it's like with rats. If you see one, you know, there's a lot more.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  So we've been seeing floods of people coming and contacting us now saying, look, I checked and I found out I'm also registered.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  I lived in Florida for years. I lived in Indiana, Michigan, wherever for years. Minnesota, Indiana, I'm being flooded right now.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  And I'm going to be working with the writers to try to put out a story on all this information that I've been gathering, Alex.
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  But it's so overwhelming. The information is just coming to us so fast.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  We've been in contact with the whistleblower that originally dumped hundreds of documents at our feet on Friday.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  And it appears there's a possibility we could even get more information.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  There has already been an investigation going on apparently into a lecture election voter machine fraud going on in Kentucky.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  So we actually have spoken with forensic analysis analysts and they have confirmed that there's definitely anomalies.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  This is a serious issue and we're just doing everything we can right now to collect as much evidence so that something can be done.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  Now, what's important to note here is that there's a major conflict of interest.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  Okay, this company, Harp Enterprises, that owns all the electronic voting machines in Kentucky.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  Well, the problem is they also have another company, a shell company, in which that same owner is listed as the owner.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  He owns all the computer systems that run all of Kentucky's government computers.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  That's the problem.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  That's right. And so the Secretary of State, the county clerks, all of the interfaces, and I want to be clear here, Millie.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  When we found out there was a high-level Obama official on the jury, they confirmed it.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  Then they said we were wrong about the name. We weren't.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  They just put out a fake name of somebody else and said we did that. We didn't do that.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  So they play lots of tricks. And so voter fraud is when someone gets the name of a dead person or somebody off the rolls and does it themselves.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  This is election fraud, stealing individuals, voters in mass off of lists that they use of who's registered in another state.
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  And so they can then knowingly put those over using the databases for the reverse of what is meant.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  Heart Enterprises, Heart Entercivix, all these subcompanies are world famous.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  There's a bunch of them. I've had Bev Harrison probably a hundred times.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  You've talked to her. She's looked at your documents as they're real.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  They're well known for this. So you're basically telling me that a black cat's black.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  You're telling me water is wet. You're telling me the Easter Bunny doesn't exist.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  You're dead on. And they're just pissed that you've had people come out that were screwed over.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  Now there's press conferences. Now all these witnesses are showing up.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  But we can get distracted off into the voting machines and the fraud.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  That's ongoing and how easily they can be hacked and how they're designed to.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  That's important. What's totally documented that you broke with the witnesses and they went public
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  and you had the recordings, the Secretary of State confirming their cases is people that are Republicans
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  and other states having their names put on the rolls there as Democrats and their husband that's an immigrant
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  who's never voted being put on it as Democrats and then all these other witnesses.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  So it's that 175,000 lists the Democrats sued a year ago had put on one month before the election in October
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  and got that baby in there and have done this. And then that's all they've done.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  And the governor's got to get that list, run it through a database of people that are supposedly off the rolls
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  and live in other states. He'll get way more than 5,000 people and he'll win the race.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  That's it. Sorry. Go ahead.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  Now here's the problem. The governor's waiting on a re canvassing, a recounting.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  The problem is the Secretary of State's computer systems, the same company that runs all the machines.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  They also have access to the computer systems.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  So they're essentially asking, we're asking the same company that might have committed this election fraud
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  to investigate themselves and give us the reports, the reports themselves.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  Absolutely right. The Democrats and the company and the software it's got, the modems all between it,
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  perfect circle of control, they're now going to run the recount.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  Oh, yeah. So we're not going to get any justice here unless more whistleblowers come forward.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  And the other thing is we're working on analyzing these logs that the whistleblower dumped
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  and seeing if we can pinpoint what the actual voter logs in the machines correlate with these air gaps
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  and with the, what is it called, when they essentially were doing these logoffs
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  and machine maintenance that was definitely suspicious activity.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  Updates.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  Updates, yes. They're doing updates.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  We've been down this road a billion times.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  And what I'm getting at here is judicial watch sued and got three million names in California alone
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  that voted illegally against Trump, totally proving everything he said.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  2016, 2018 same deal, even more numbers.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  It's all over the country. It's totally, all the Democrat officials on video saying they engage in this fraud.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  We know the machines are doing this. We all know this information.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  And so I'm not poo-pooing what you're saying. You've done a great job exposing it.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  I'm just wondering why the media, why the people buy into it.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  I guess they don't with Brian Williams that own fraud.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  Not attacking what you said or what you brought forward. It's totally true and huge.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  But bringing up some little fake thing and not even showing it to then say it's all a lie.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  Don't look here. Don't investigate.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  That's really the proof there is them saying don't look into fraud when the known fraud of all this is on record.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  And the Democrats have, what is it, 14 states where illegal aliens get driver's license
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  and then vote. We know what's going on. California does that. Kentucky does that.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  That's what's happening. We need voter ID.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  Let's come back with Millie Weaver to talk more about this on the other side.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  Because there you saw them saying it's all made up.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  Brian Williams, he wouldn't lie to you. He told you so.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  Think of the nerve of these people relaunching that criminal.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  Beto Rourke came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:59.000]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that he was a hero.
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  Think about that.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  They know what they're doing.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  And they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  So you see, a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens. Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida,
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  where he's always said he planned to retire to.
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  And the left got so excited.
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:09.000]  They said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida.
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  Well, now we know why the president did that.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  He knew the left is controlled appeals courts.
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  We're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  In his words, we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:17.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  Now look, I've been all over the map with Millie last second and I'm not frustrated with her.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  I've just done this rodeo over and over again.
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  And yes, it's big that they got a big tranche of thousands of pages of documents showing all these anomalies they show them to Bev Harris, the preeminent crime investigator.
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  He's been a federal crimes investigator of big corporations, the expert on election frauds.
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  He said, yeah, this looks bad.
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  And of course we know the name of the company.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  It always pops up.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  They all do.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  Okay, it's about power.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  It's about control.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  You've seen how the deep state operates.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  They think they're invincible.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  I'm saying the names and the first story Millie broke.
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  They're saying that's why they're so powerful.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  And they're so powerful.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  And they're so powerful that they're so strong.
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  And they're so powerful that they can go look and see that they're on the Kentucky rolls when they've never lived there, haven't lived there.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  And they're 18 years old or they're an immigrant.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  And so people are coming out of the woodwork and they're showing up at the secretary's state's office and they're coming to press conferences and they're proving it.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  They're posting it online.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  And Brian Williams is saying it doesn't exist.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  It's made up.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  It's a Russian bot.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  You saw that earlier.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:32.480]  known lying criminal that said he was shot down in a helicopter by an RPG. So Millie you're
[2:01:32.480 --> 2:01:37.280]  doing a superlative job. I just haven't ever found a way to capture the public's attention or the
[2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:42.640]  government about the election machines and about the fraud and about the same company and about
[2:01:42.640 --> 2:01:47.680]  how they're interconnected and control the modems at the county clerk's office to be able to coordinate
[2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:53.120]  that. I get what you're saying. Yes, I understand that you're absolutely right. But the public can
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:57.840]  go find out how they're on voting rolls or their immigrant husband is and someone's voting in the
[2:01:57.840 --> 2:02:04.000]  name. That's the proof where we can get them where people experience their identity being stolen.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:07.360]  That's how we're going to get people to start countering this because there's not enough dead
[2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:12.800]  people to get it done. They're going to do it to people in other states and they're going to put
[2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:16.960]  immigrants on it which they've already done. That's a Democrat plan and I'm saying therein
[2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:22.320]  is where we're going to beat them because people who have their identity stolen legally will be
[2:02:22.320 --> 2:02:29.920]  shareholders and will have standing in court when this doesn't get reversed to sue these
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:35.760]  institutions into oblivion. And that I'm telling you is a real path and this gets people's attention.
[2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:40.800]  Does that make sense, Melanie? Oh yeah, it makes total sense, Alex. And that's why yesterday
[2:02:40.800 --> 2:02:46.400]  over a hundred testimonies have been submitted to the Attorney General's office in Kentucky.
[2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:51.600]  But we know that the Attorney General right now is Andy Beshear. So how can we expect him to do
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:58.560]  an investigation into himself when he benefits from winning this race? There's a major conflict but
[2:02:58.560 --> 2:03:03.680]  yes, more and more people are coming forward and this young man who's very brave named Jake Bird,
[2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:08.080]  who's a college student in Florida, decided he was going to make a video. He has posted the video
[2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:13.840]  of his own testimony that he was not in the state of Kentucky when somebody voted on his behalf,
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:20.160]  used his ID to do so and his mother discovered that. So that's a major breakthrough right there.
[2:03:20.160 --> 2:03:25.200]  We've had immigrants being put on the voter rolls, tons of people being put on the voter rolls.
[2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:29.840]  If you are a resident or have been a resident of Kentucky and you've noticed any suspicious
[2:03:29.840 --> 2:03:36.000]  activity, you can submit that to Citizens for Election Integrity on Facebook because
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:40.880]  they are handing all of this information off to proper investigators. But it's important to note,
[2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:47.200]  Alex, that when Open Records requests have been submitted to the Secretary of State's office,
[2:03:47.200 --> 2:03:52.720]  they've then deferred to Harp Enterprises and said, oh, well Harp Enterprises declined that request
[2:03:52.720 --> 2:03:58.960]  and they're a private company so you'd have to subpoena the logs. So we're being stonewalled here
[2:03:58.960 --> 2:04:03.360]  by a bunch of corrupt people in power. That's right. It's always the same. It's a big corporate
[2:04:03.360 --> 2:04:07.280]  takeover. That's what the new owner is and then they've got all your private info. They're in
[2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:12.160]  control of the government but you can't investigate them because they're gone. And the votes are being
[2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:20.160]  tallied. They're being put up on cloud services that are out of the EU. So this is foreign interference.
[2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:24.080]  Alex? Milly, stay there. I'm going to come back and try to shut up and give me the floor to just
[2:04:24.080 --> 2:04:28.720]  recap all your findings. It just makes my head want to explode. I get so angry. And again,
[2:04:28.720 --> 2:04:33.280]  if you think shifts corrupt folks hiding in plain view, making up fake whistleblowers saying you
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:38.400]  can't release their names, not saying there never was a whistleblower. While he's at Ed Buck's house
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:43.200]  doing satanic ceremonies, he's just being reported. If you think that's crazy, imagine what we don't
[2:04:43.200 --> 2:04:49.280]  know about. These people have been getting away with literal murder. And now they want big fat
[2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:52.000]  men dressed as clowns to have sexual access to children.
[2:04:55.200 --> 2:05:00.160]  In Full War's Life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet.
[2:05:00.800 --> 2:05:07.600]  Super silver whitening toothpaste. This is proprietary. This is with the top lab in the
[2:05:07.600 --> 2:05:14.080]  country. And it is incredibly high quality. This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:19.440]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria. It recalcifies the teeth.
[2:05:19.440 --> 2:05:25.200]  It does so many things on so many fronts. These beautiful tubes of super silver
[2:05:25.200 --> 2:05:31.280]  toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates as low as we can go.
[2:05:31.280 --> 2:05:36.400]  And they're going to sell out very, very quickly. Super silver whitening toothpaste
[2:05:36.400 --> 2:05:41.760]  is going to be a hit. I'm very, very proud of it. I want to thank my father, a retired dentist,
[2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:46.720]  for spearheading this the last two years and developing it. It's 25% off out of the gates.
[2:05:46.720 --> 2:05:51.760]  That's as low as we can go because it's very, very expensive to produce. Get yours today at

[2:06:12.320 --> 2:06:19.520]  We are now taking live for Central Texas Commands in the heart of the Resistance.
[2:06:19.520 --> 2:06:26.880]  You know, they got that movie, Field of Dreams, where Kevin Costner's walking around and
[2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:35.920]  here's his voice. Well, I didn't really hear a voice. I just had a vision of the globalist
[2:06:35.920 --> 2:06:39.760]  and what they'd try to do, the technocracy and the world government, the chai comms,
[2:06:39.760 --> 2:06:42.800]  and the one child policies and the breakup of the family and their whole plan.
[2:06:42.800 --> 2:06:49.840]  About 27 years ago, I just had a compulsion to get involved and to get into the media and to
[2:06:49.840 --> 2:06:55.280]  make films and to get on the radio and to raise the alarm. And it was God guiding my mind and my
[2:06:55.280 --> 2:07:05.200]  steps the entire time. And boy, I was a sweet boy back then. I have turned into a
[2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:16.240]  vicious, ogre-like creature. But that's okay. That's God's plan because I'm going
[2:07:16.240 --> 2:07:20.000]  after the New World Order. But I am now completely compelled to fight them.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:29.760]  It's not courage. It is commitment and just being taken over. And you have to understand the
[2:07:29.760 --> 2:07:36.400]  enemy is taken over by their evil force. But I tell you, there's nothing more satisfying than
[2:07:36.400 --> 2:07:41.360]  being committed to what you do and knowing it's the right thing. It is fulfillment. And I can
[2:07:41.360 --> 2:07:45.920]  tell you, people out there who don't feel good or don't have fulfillment, if you have a relationship
[2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:48.800]  with God, you've got it all. And just look at these articles coming up after Millie Weaver
[2:07:48.800 --> 2:07:54.480]  leaves us and I'm going to open the phones up. Feds probe, Adam Schiff dressed like
[2:07:54.480 --> 2:08:02.560]  Egyptian at Bazaar, sacrifice parties at Ed Buck's meth mansion. This is all over the news.
[2:08:05.600 --> 2:08:12.960]  Sink ogre files to run for disgraced Congresswoman Katie Hill's seat. I'm suing him, by the way,
[2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:22.560]  for saying that I'm basically a child molester with no proof. Sanders AOC unveiled 172 million
[2:08:22.560 --> 2:08:26.080]  green New Deal for public housing. Gotta give all those illegal aliens free housing.
[2:08:29.200 --> 2:08:33.440]  More on Disney putting trigger warnings on outdated movies. They say they're evil,
[2:08:33.440 --> 2:08:39.040]  like Lady in the Tramp. Another bizarre mainstream article saying the stone trial
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:44.240]  is still ongoing. The jury's out right now. That's not true. It says testimony continues on Friday.
[2:08:44.240 --> 2:08:49.360]  No, they rested yesterday. We're watching that. I've got my message of stone. I'll do that before
[2:08:49.360 --> 2:08:55.360]  I go to your calls. I've already posted an article dealing with it. I believe he's going to be convicted
[2:08:55.360 --> 2:08:59.120]  because it's kangaroo court. I'll talk about that. The toll free number to talk about any of these
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:09.520]  issues is 877-789-2539-8777-89 Alex. What do you make of the whole impeachment thing collapsing?
[2:09:09.520 --> 2:09:15.760]  That's the word. Even mainstream news had those headlines. Are the Democrats building a collapsible
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:29.600]  impeachment? AP calls it a scam? What are they going to do? So much more on that coming up,
[2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:35.360]  but going back to Millie Weaver. Millie, you've done a just amazing job with you and your team
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:40.240]  in between Ohio and Kentucky and on the road when you're a mother with two children.
[2:09:40.240 --> 2:09:46.320]  I've been working with this eight, nine years, so the babies came later, but you and your husband
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:54.320]  and your camera team and just witnessing the witnesses and the documents and the state admitting
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:09:58.560]  you're right and going and filing the info and meeting the Secretary of State's office,
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:02.080]  not just on the phone, but going there and having press conferences at the governor's office and
[2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:07.040]  then to watch Brian Williams not show you, not show what you said so folks could decide
[2:10:07.040 --> 2:10:10.480]  just saying you're a bot and then he made up something that wasn't true. Of course he's
[2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:14.880]  Brian Williams, but the fact that they're just doing it, what is it like for you
[2:10:14.880 --> 2:10:19.040]  to witness it for yourself, to stay up late at night going over all these documents now for
[2:10:19.040 --> 2:10:23.760]  four or five days, to have Bev Harris, the top researcher confirming it, and to just
[2:10:25.440 --> 2:10:30.000]  just know that that's business as usual. Well, you know, they're just setting the narrative.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:34.880]  They're getting ready to start the smear campaign because they're anticipating all of this information
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:39.600]  coming out and it will be coming out soon. And I do believe that this is going to become a national
[2:10:39.600 --> 2:10:45.040]  story shortly here when we start to see people being put behind bars. Okay. And that very well
[2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:50.000]  could happen soon, Alex. And people need to remember, you know, everyone goes up in arms when
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:54.800]  there's any talk about infringing on our gun rights or taking away our gun rights. Well,
[2:10:54.800 --> 2:11:00.240]  people should be just as concerned if not more concerned about taking away our free and fair
[2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:06.480]  elections. Because if we don't have our elections, we don't have the ability to vote for keeping our
[2:11:06.480 --> 2:11:11.200]  gun rights, you know, vote for the rights that we want to maintain. They'll just take them all
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:15.360]  from us and they'll say we willingly forfeited them. So that's what we're up against. And as
[2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:23.760]  far as this impeachment inquiry, well, that's plan A, Alex, but plan B is stealing the election
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:29.120]  via vote rigging in 2020. And that's what we're trying to stop right now. And we are doing all,
[2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:33.920]  we're putting all of our resources and effort into investigating this. We have forensic analysts.
[2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:38.880]  We are going through this data. We're trying to figure out how we can expose this the proper way
[2:11:38.880 --> 2:11:44.880]  without interfering with investigations and to essentially do the most damage to this corrupt
[2:11:44.880 --> 2:11:52.080]  system that's stealing Americans votes from them. It's a major issue. You can even see it yourself
[2:11:52.080 --> 2:11:56.800]  when you go to the Kentucky elections website. And you'll when you click on the voter results,
[2:11:56.800 --> 2:12:03.200]  it'll take you to clarity. And that is when you can see that Cytal and these foreign software
[2:12:03.200 --> 2:12:07.600]  companies, they even stated on the website that those are the companies that are tallying the
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:12.240]  votes that are being put up in clouds and being put up on servers that are out of Europe.
[2:12:12.800 --> 2:12:17.600]  So how is that not foreign interference? They want to talk about foreign interference meddling
[2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:22.960]  in elections with this Russian story that they investigated for two years against President
[2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:29.040]  Trump? When we've heard no mainstream media outlets pick up this story, despite that evidence
[2:12:29.040 --> 2:12:33.840]  is coming out. It's unbelievable. There was a press conference yesterday where you had this
[2:12:33.840 --> 2:12:39.040]  group go over all of this information and the mainstream media has been silent with it.
[2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:45.920]  They only were there to try to bully and interrogate these women that are concerned citizens in
[2:12:45.920 --> 2:12:50.880]  Kentucky that have had floods of information of voter fraud coming to them. They just wanted to try
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:57.760]  to bully them and shut them down. And they didn't even air the press conference, Alex. It's unbelievable.
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:04.400]  The mainstream media is full of Democrat operatives that are doing the deep states bidding,
[2:13:04.400 --> 2:13:09.600]  trying to suppress this information from getting out. Wow, Millie powerfully said,
[2:13:09.600 --> 2:13:12.720]  we're going to put this interview out. Hopefully you can post it to your YouTube.
[2:13:13.600 --> 2:13:18.720]  But this is just amazing. And again, you had all those news media there and you had evidence
[2:13:18.720 --> 2:13:22.720]  and you had witnesses, you had people showing how they had been put on the Democrat rolls.
[2:13:23.600 --> 2:13:31.440]  And that is so huge. Their identities stolen and no coverage of it. But we're here. We're on air.
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:34.560]  We're exposing it. Thank you so much, Millie. We will continue to watch your great work.
[2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:40.400]  Thank you, Alex. It's all at infowars.com and newswars.com. She's got her own channel at
[2:13:40.400 --> 2:13:44.640]  band.video. So it's backed up there in case any of our other material gets censored. All right,
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:53.920]  877-789-2539. You notice that it's infowars over and over and over and over again that exposes
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:14:00.320]  the Obama department juror whose husband is working on the Mueller probe. That's textbook
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:04.800]  conflict of interest. You notice it's us doing that. You notice it's us exposing that idea
[2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:09.840]  to the whistleblower. You notice it's us doing it two plus years ago. You notice it's us exposing
[2:14:09.840 --> 2:14:13.920]  the Soros moles. You notice it's us exposing Jeffrey Epstein. You notice it's us exposing it
[2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:19.280]  all because we do the homework. We are totally focused on this and we've got all the sources
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:24.400]  across the country in the world that care about freedom. They're all over the place. There's good
[2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:30.240]  people everywhere, but they're trying to put us in prison. They're trying to bankrupt us.
[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:38.480]  They want to demonize us, censor us, boycott us, silence us, and then they can set us up and try
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:44.480]  to put us in prison. So it's personal with me. I want to defeat the globalists for everybody,
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:48.400]  for all the innocent children, and for all of our futures, and for society. I mean, it's because
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:53.600]  what God wants and because evil must be confronted. That's what this animating contest of consciousness
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:15:00.960]  is all about. But yeah, I want to beat the globalist. I'm not even scared of what will happen if they
[2:15:00.960 --> 2:15:07.360]  ever get me down. I'm really worried that I don't have the energy and the focus and the stamina
[2:15:07.360 --> 2:15:13.760]  and the will to really do my best. And I'm constantly chomping at the bit to do more
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:17.760]  and to stay in the fight. So I'm just asking viewers and listeners, keep info wars in the fight
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:22.800]  financially and spread the word about our videos and our articles and everything we do,
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:29.600]  because that's how we are going to stay in the game and ensure that the next hundreds huge
[2:15:29.600 --> 2:15:39.360]  stories we break that devastate the enemy. Get out there. We really have put out half the reports
[2:15:39.360 --> 2:15:45.280]  that devastated the NWO. I mean, it's just insane. And it's because of you backing us. So you've got
[2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:50.240]  the commitment that we're not going to back down, but we'll collapse unless you back us. So please
[2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:55.280]  continue to back us. Huge sales and for more store.com. Take action. Finally, there's a way for you
[2:15:55.280 --> 2:16:00.640]  to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation. No, enjoy a

[2:16:15.840 --> 2:16:20.400]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets,
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:25.360]  not a security IPO or note. Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale lease

[2:16:56.400 --> 2:17:01.760]  founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com. Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:06.560]  until one day I chose to lead my family to freedom. Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead
[2:17:06.560 --> 2:17:11.120]  where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state
[2:17:11.120 --> 2:17:15.920]  looking over us. If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black

[2:17:46.240 --> 2:17:56.640]  A
[2:17:56.640 --> 2:18:05.840]  question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will
[2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:12.000]  take humanity to? How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the limit to which
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:21.600]  other men and women will submit. The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[2:18:22.800 --> 2:18:29.360]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free
[2:18:29.360 --> 2:18:34.960]  will. There's no devil or the god. But those very same people have all these rules for us about
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:42.240]  speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like. They just don't
[2:18:42.240 --> 2:18:48.800]  want us to have any values so they can run over us. Oxford's banned clapping. University's the US
[2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:53.680]  have banned 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to
[2:18:53.680 --> 2:19:00.560]  reject them. The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times,
[2:19:00.560 --> 2:19:08.480]  I will never give in. I will never give up but I could give out. And it's very, very frustrating
[2:19:08.480 --> 2:19:14.720]  to see them committing all their crimes against humanity. To see evil running rampant like this
[2:19:14.720 --> 2:19:21.280]  and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace. That most Americans have
[2:19:21.280 --> 2:19:27.360]  already been shadow banned by big tech. And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't
[2:19:27.360 --> 2:19:35.120]  realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com and
[2:19:35.120 --> 2:19:39.760]  banned.video. And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever. And that if you tell
[2:19:39.760 --> 2:19:45.760]  people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at infowords.com forward slash show
[2:19:45.760 --> 2:19:50.960]  and banned.video. So take heart folks. They've had to censor everybody and show everybody down
[2:19:50.960 --> 2:20:00.080]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square. You're listening to the Alex
[2:20:00.080 --> 2:20:23.200]  Jones show.
[2:20:30.080 --> 2:20:52.160]  I have a message. I have a message for the world from Roger Stone. And that message is your basic
[2:20:52.160 --> 2:21:01.600]  liberties, your basic freedoms and due process is under attack. And if Roger Stone can be found
[2:21:01.600 --> 2:21:09.440]  guilty on any of the six counts against him by this kangaroo court and this Obama appointed
[2:21:10.880 --> 2:21:19.760]  tyrant fake judge, then no one in this nation is safe. And we see in Congress the fake star
[2:21:19.760 --> 2:21:25.760]  chamber secret trials where they were having rehearsals on how they would testify. But even
[2:21:25.760 --> 2:21:29.840]  once they testified, it turned out that everything that we'd heard from Adam Schiff
[2:21:30.720 --> 2:21:39.600]  and Buck's best buddy was a lie. So Roger Stone's message is this. He expects to be convicted.
[2:21:40.400 --> 2:21:44.400]  He said only a miracle can save him now. That's his exact words to me last night
[2:21:44.400 --> 2:21:57.360]  and this morning. And he said to me, Alex, barring a miracle, I appeal to God and I appeal to your
[2:21:57.360 --> 2:22:08.160]  listeners for prayer and I appeal to the president to pardon me because to do so would be a
[2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:16.960]  action that would show these corrupt courts that they're not going to get away with persecuting
[2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:22.800]  people for their free speech or for the crime of getting the president elected. If we don't do that,
[2:22:23.520 --> 2:22:30.880]  it will embolden their criminal activity. Now, there is a press release in an article on
[2:22:30.880 --> 2:22:41.840]  newswars.com and infowars.com that has the number to the White House on it.
[2:22:46.800 --> 2:22:55.200]  And even when he is convicted by this jury, it is vital that everyone share the information
[2:22:55.200 --> 2:23:04.400]  graphic posted at infowars.com and newswars.com with everyone you know on Twitter, Facebook,
[2:23:04.400 --> 2:23:13.040]  YouTube, by hand, you name it, and that everyone who can, in the area of Virginia or Maryland or
[2:23:13.040 --> 2:23:19.120]  West Virginia or all over the country, travel to D.C. any time for the week after this conviction
[2:23:19.120 --> 2:23:25.520]  and encircle the White House with bullhorns demanding President Trump take action.
[2:23:28.560 --> 2:23:31.360]  They have packed the court full of Obama, Hillary,
[2:23:32.320 --> 2:23:39.200]  appointees and operatives, CIA spooks, you name it. The jury reporter has been looking at
[2:23:39.200 --> 2:23:48.480]  Roger and shaking with hatred and he's done absolutely nothing wrong. They've put President
[2:23:48.480 --> 2:23:54.080]  Trump on trial saying that it came from the Russians with no proof. They're hoping this
[2:23:54.080 --> 2:24:00.080]  show trial and conviction of stone will somehow claim that Russiagate was real, but it's already
[2:24:01.040 --> 2:24:06.640]  collapsed. He's not on trial for Russia. He's on trial for supposedly telling Congress he wasn't
[2:24:06.640 --> 2:24:13.040]  direct contact with Julian Assange. Well, he never was in direct contact with him. He worked here at
[2:24:13.040 --> 2:24:18.560]  the time. We know he was talking to him through people like credit code and others and Assange was
[2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:24.480]  talking to mainstream media at that time. That's not illegal. But CNN tells you that if you read
[2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:28.720]  WikiLeaks, you're going to jail. They tell you have you say the name of this whistleblower you're
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:34.560]  going to jail, but Rand Paul has because it's the law that when you accuse somebody, your name is
[2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:40.160]  public, but the Democrats are trying to intimidate the world and anybody that would support President
[2:24:40.160 --> 2:24:49.200]  Trump. So Roger Stone's message is this. He prays by a miracle that he's not convicted, but the tea
[2:24:49.200 --> 2:24:56.960]  leaves are clear. He believes he will be convicted. They now have been deliberating for five hours or
[2:24:56.960 --> 2:25:06.080]  so. And as soon as the verdict comes out, we'll let you know that right now, barring that miracle,
[2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:11.600]  you'll be convicted on many of the six fake counts. And that's why we have a separation of
[2:25:11.600 --> 2:25:17.520]  power so that when there is misjustice, higher courts can override lower courts and overturn
[2:25:17.520 --> 2:25:24.080]  convictions. And Congress can pass laws that override the courts or even the executive in many
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:31.440]  cases. And the executive has the power of the pardon. Only an impeachment for what they believe is
[2:25:31.440 --> 2:25:37.520]  an improper pardon can stop the president. And will Americans be mad at Trump if he pardoned Stone?
[2:25:39.200 --> 2:25:44.880]  Stone stopped being able to communicate with Trump once they said that Stone and Trump were
[2:25:44.880 --> 2:25:49.600]  implicated the fake Russia gate. That was meant to break them off from each other. Now that's
[2:25:49.600 --> 2:25:55.040]  been proven to be a hoax. So will the president listen to his cowardly advisors and not pardon Stone?
[2:25:55.040 --> 2:26:01.520]  Because he believes, if he does, that that somehow validates a Russia connection when this man has
[2:26:01.520 --> 2:26:06.320]  not been indicted for Russia connection. And the judge wouldn't let Stone bring into his defense
[2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:12.400]  that there was no Russia connection. She said this trial isn't about Russia. So you can't bring in
[2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:16.560]  that no proof was ever shown that the hack was Russian. But then the entire prosecution is about
[2:26:16.560 --> 2:26:22.800]  Trump and the Russians and Stone and the Russians in front of these jurors and these libtard jurors,
[2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:29.760]  no damn well he's innocent. But they want to sit there and feel all officious and powerful and
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:37.200]  send him to prison hoping for some victory against flyover country that they despise so much that
[2:26:37.200 --> 2:26:44.240]  they're so angry they don't have control of. So write down the number. It's Roger Stone's request
[2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:51.600]  that if he's convicted, you call the White House 202-456-1414. And you let them know repeatedly
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:58.640]  that you want this man that got Trump elected. And it's now been indicted for that crime according
[2:26:58.640 --> 2:27:04.960]  to the deep state. And I point out in the article that Kit and I wrote during the breaks
[2:27:07.200 --> 2:27:14.480]  and in FullWars.com that if he is found innocent by a miracle, still it's good to call the White
[2:27:14.480 --> 2:27:19.760]  House and tell the president, indict the deep state, bring out the Inspector General report,
[2:27:19.760 --> 2:27:24.480]  indict them for the fake Russiagate hoax, indict them for their crimes, indict them for the fake
[2:27:24.480 --> 2:27:29.440]  whistleblower. But they now have an ongoing impeachment proceedings based on a lie and
[2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:34.400]  Schiff says the whistleblower doesn't even know who it is now. And he said it was Eric
[2:27:35.840 --> 2:27:42.160]  Sierra Mala. Think about how crazy things have gotten. Think about how dumb they think you are.
[2:27:42.160 --> 2:27:47.440]  They think you have no memory. Like Jonathan Gruber said, he wrote Obamacare, to triple your
[2:27:47.440 --> 2:27:54.480]  prices. He said thank God you don't have a memory. Thank God you're so stupid. But are you really
[2:27:54.480 --> 2:28:00.080]  stupid? No, you're not stupid. And it's this audience of activists they fear. So again,
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:06.640]  not just one day, but many days for due process, for justice, for freedom, and to say no to the
[2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:12.880]  Russiagate hoax and all of the judicial tyranny and the deep state political prosecutions of
[2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:20.560]  political prisoners like Roger Stone. We say no now. So I'm not waiting until he's convicted
[2:28:20.560 --> 2:28:25.040]  to come out here and tell you the battle plan because I believe he is going to be convicted
[2:28:25.040 --> 2:28:31.600]  because the intel we got from witnesses and reporters. And I hope I get egg on my face
[2:28:31.600 --> 2:28:36.560]  because I rarely do. I'll be very glad to come on here and say I was wrong. But I think we all know
[2:28:36.560 --> 2:28:43.680]  a kangaroo court fraud when we see it. They packed that court with deep staters and the
[2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:49.200]  benches were just full of globalists, cackling and laughing at their petty power. These people
[2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:55.520]  have no power. They're pumps of the satanic pedophile network. We can all agree these are
[2:28:55.520 --> 2:29:01.360]  troubled times, right? So do you know who's on your wireless network? Whether it's a big company

[2:29:51.120 --> 2:30:01.200]  Beto Rourke came out dozens of times instead. We're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic
[2:30:01.200 --> 2:30:07.040]  rifles and he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that he was
[2:30:07.040 --> 2:30:12.960]  a hero. Think about that. Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[2:30:12.960 --> 2:30:20.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:25.920]  incredible levels of violent crime. They know what they're doing. And now the Supreme Courts
[2:30:25.920 --> 2:30:31.360]  come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do
[2:30:31.360 --> 2:30:35.520]  using their firearms. My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible
[2:30:35.520 --> 2:30:41.680]  attack, but more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment
[2:30:41.680 --> 2:30:45.840]  and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're not going to
[2:30:45.840 --> 2:30:50.960]  help in the confiscation of guns. So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens. Well,
[2:30:50.960 --> 2:30:59.200]  we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws. A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[2:31:00.000 --> 2:31:08.960]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to? How far will they go? What's
[2:31:08.960 --> 2:31:17.360]  their limit? And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit. The answer is
[2:31:17.360 --> 2:31:25.360]  there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit. We've been taught in modern culture and society
[2:31:25.360 --> 2:31:32.240]  that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will. There's no devil or the God. But those very
[2:31:32.240 --> 2:31:39.760]  same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live
[2:31:39.760 --> 2:31:45.280]  and what our houses can be like. They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[2:31:45.840 --> 2:31:51.200]  Oxford's banned clapping. University of the U.S. of banned 21 gun salutes for veterans.
[2:31:51.200 --> 2:31:56.960]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them. I spend a lot of time
[2:31:56.960 --> 2:32:03.360]  reminding the info wars, the family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the
[2:32:03.360 --> 2:32:08.160]  air. And I spend a lot of time thanking you. But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping
[2:32:08.160 --> 2:32:12.640]  us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball
[2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:19.200]  reviewers. But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are
[2:32:19.200 --> 2:32:23.840]  really amazing. You've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third-party test out there,
[2:32:23.840 --> 2:32:28.560]  the air filtration, the water filtration. The supplements are all the very best you're going
[2:32:28.560 --> 2:32:35.200]  to find out there. And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this
[2:32:35.200 --> 2:32:44.080]  hard. So it's not a burden to support info wars. It really is something that is good for everybody
[2:32:44.080 --> 2:32:49.120]  that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's
[2:32:49.120 --> 2:32:54.720]  life so much better. So visit infowarstore.com today.
[2:33:19.120 --> 2:33:43.600]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide. I'm your host Alex Jones. We're going to your phone calls
[2:33:43.600 --> 2:33:48.400]  here right now. And then I'm going to get into some of the other big breaking news. It's just
[2:33:48.400 --> 2:33:55.040]  crazy. Their whole system of lies is coming down. The elections they've been rigging almost all of
[2:33:55.040 --> 2:34:01.120]  those. The establishment has basically just run every scam you can imagine. The average
[2:34:01.120 --> 2:34:05.120]  mortgage has been sold more than 50 times by the big banks over and over again to investors.
[2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:11.760]  Major mutual funds are coming out and warning investors not to buy too many stocks.
[2:34:11.760 --> 2:34:19.280]  They're doing that. So they have liability protection when the market crashes.
[2:34:19.280 --> 2:34:26.960]  A lot of listeners are probably well that's kind of oxymoronic. You say you don't want to plunge the
[2:34:26.960 --> 2:34:33.120]  stock market but then you also get up on air and point out that a lot of it is over inflated.
[2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:38.560]  We're in a global race with the chai comms devaluing currency. Donald Trump didn't do that.
[2:34:38.560 --> 2:34:47.680]  I didn't do that. And if you look at Bill Gates, it was worth $4 billion in 1995.
[2:34:49.440 --> 2:34:53.360]  But that $4 billion then would be about $50 billion today.
[2:34:55.760 --> 2:35:02.720]  The devaluation is happening very, very quickly. Inflation has been kept at bay partially,
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:09.520]  but it's out of control in some cities. And so I don't like fractional reserve banking.
[2:35:09.520 --> 2:35:16.800]  I don't like all the manipulation, but it's the bubble we live on. And so the globalists
[2:35:16.800 --> 2:35:22.000]  have been trying to pop the U.S. bubble while propping up the chai comm bubble.
[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:28.560]  And so I've been, okay, let's politically get good judges in. Let's expose the corrupt
[2:35:28.560 --> 2:35:32.960]  pedophile regime. Let's reverse a lot of the new older operations, secure the borders.
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:37.440]  And then we're going to have a real discussion with Rand Paul and others
[2:35:38.160 --> 2:35:42.560]  who's very fiscally smart with Trump about being honest with the people about what we're going to do.
[2:35:45.600 --> 2:35:51.760]  But it's a global system. And so the private federal reserve
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:36:00.320]  and the very central banks talking about how the economies and the stock markets over inflated,
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:06.720]  they're the very ones that did it. And they're now getting the benefit of doing it,
[2:36:06.720 --> 2:36:11.120]  creating all this fiat currency that they used first, but it had more value.
[2:36:11.120 --> 2:36:14.160]  And then they inflate it more and they use it again, but it has more value.
[2:36:14.160 --> 2:36:18.880]  But it's declining value for us. And then they tell us, oh, here's a message to you.
[2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:26.320]  You better watch out and you better not invest too much in the stock market, young people.
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:34.080]  Fidelity warns boomer generation to stop buying stocks as hero hedge.com article
[2:36:34.080 --> 2:36:38.160]  up on news wars.com and info wars.com. And it's just a very important article.
[2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:44.080]  I want to go to your phone calls, but there's just so much happening, so much unfolding.
[2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:51.760]  Interesting story here. Amateur astronomer discovers comment ahead of NASA report.
[2:36:51.760 --> 2:36:54.000]  That's from RT. We posted it up on a fours.com.
[2:36:56.640 --> 2:37:01.280]  Not content with leading NASA to detect water from an alien star system or
[2:37:01.280 --> 2:37:14.880]  board on those teller visitor. Crimean amateur astronomer. Gennady Borsov has discovered another comment.
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:17.280]  Dubbed two I. Bors eyes off. I say that right.
[2:37:18.960 --> 2:37:22.160]  A new resident of our solar system. Now, why is that an important article?
[2:37:22.160 --> 2:37:32.320]  I'll go to your calls. I back in college, went with my dad to buy a 12 inch diameter
[2:37:32.320 --> 2:37:36.640]  reflector refractor. I should know all this telescope, but the big, you know, they're short
[2:37:36.640 --> 2:37:41.920]  and fat and all the computer controls and that was the first coming out. And my favorite thing
[2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:45.600]  was the black filter you put on it and you couldn't see through it. You look at the sun,
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:49.200]  you could see the sun and you'd go away and have some lemonade or whatever come back an hour later.
[2:37:49.200 --> 2:37:53.440]  You'd see sunspots. It turned, you know, the things moving. It's round.
[2:37:55.680 --> 2:37:59.440]  And when I talk to the flat earth folks, they say it's like a dome above us in the sun,
[2:37:59.440 --> 2:38:04.560]  just like a digital thing. And it's all fake. And you sit there, but you realize they've been
[2:38:04.560 --> 2:38:09.920]  lied to so much by the media and culture. They don't know what's true now. That's a logical
[2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:14.720]  extension of learning. Brian Williams is a liar and massive election frauds, real and
[2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:20.160]  bunch of devil worshipers run stuff. Well, in hell, if those people are telling you the world's round,
[2:38:20.720 --> 2:38:27.920]  it's probably flat, right? But it's not. It's not always been lies at this level.
[2:38:27.920 --> 2:38:31.360]  And they used to think it was flat. Then they said it was round. The Bible says it's round.
[2:38:33.200 --> 2:38:36.560]  But it's healthy that people have that level of doubt. You're supposed to be able to doubt things,
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:43.200]  but it's just, I sit there and I tell the flat earthers, hey, I'm able to look at moons orbiting
[2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:48.000]  Jupiter on a clear night and I can see them turning.
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:39:00.320]  And they say, no, you can't. And they get mad. And they got little sayings like the cube group.
[2:39:01.120 --> 2:39:06.400]  Oh, why are you so obsessed with the ball? Oh, you're in love with your ball. And it's just like,
[2:39:07.760 --> 2:39:11.520]  but see, that's just a way when things are so crazy with devil worship and world government,
[2:39:11.520 --> 2:39:14.720]  New World Order and all these serious things just kind of go down if it matters.
[2:39:16.880 --> 2:39:22.240]  It's, it's a realm. And then, and then, you know, and then it's an ice wall and just all of this.
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:31.840]  But those folks, the media attacks, but they don't attack the head of Bank of America.
[2:39:31.840 --> 2:39:36.400]  A few years ago said, we've got mathematical equations. We believe the world is a simulation
[2:39:36.400 --> 2:39:41.520]  held by something or an artificial reality. And we want to develop plans to break out of it. And
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:45.600]  then all these billionaires are saying that's what their religion is. We're trapped in a false
[2:39:45.600 --> 2:39:50.960]  reality. We must build supercomputers to break out of it. That's like Satan. It's all fake. God's,
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:55.360]  God's bad. This is all fake. We've got to break away from it and make our own universe. See,
[2:39:55.920 --> 2:40:02.000]  it's, we're now at that level where the devil was. Oh, that's completely normal to say everything's
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:06.960]  held in place and it's all a simulation. That's all over the news now. The last five years. All
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:13.760]  those atheists suddenly tell you that everything is a simulation. Yeah, there's a Venus is beginning
[2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:19.360]  it's transit soon. I forget when it's very soon across the sun. I have sat there with my telescope.
[2:40:19.360 --> 2:40:23.840]  It's in storage someplace. That might have time to do such things. Wouldn't that have, I've watched
[2:40:23.840 --> 2:40:29.360]  that myself. I've sat there with my telescope. It's glass with the magnifier. And I've sat there
[2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:35.920]  in my yard in the daytime looking at the sun and I've watched Venus go across it. But it's not real.
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:43.520]  Everything's fine because Q's real. We're bringing in the whole deep state. Well, I hope that's true
[2:40:43.520 --> 2:40:48.240]  because the deep state isn't a lot of trouble, but not because of some magical group battling them
[2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:54.000]  because Schiff and all these people are so hamfisted. I'm going to go to Brad and I'm going to go to
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:58.080]  Wilde and I'm going to go to Carlos and Gary and Michael and Kevin and Sargent and many others
[2:40:58.080 --> 2:41:02.800]  when we come back for two segments and then Paul Joseph Watson takes over. He's ready to ready to go.
[2:41:08.640 --> 2:41:09.760]  But Roger Stone,
[2:41:12.960 --> 2:41:17.600]  I believe will be convicted and it's a frightening thought. And first they silenced him and took
[2:41:17.600 --> 2:41:22.240]  him off social media, you know, just right before the indictment. And then his wife and people had
[2:41:22.240 --> 2:41:25.600]  some social media and he'd comment on it and they say, Oh, you threatened the judge when he didn't.
[2:41:25.600 --> 2:41:33.760]  So they'll put you in jail if you talk now. That's why they want to shut me up so they can take me
[2:41:33.760 --> 2:41:39.440]  off air, lie about me and create this new cartoon character that's Alex Jones. They'll use it as
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:43.520]  credit to Liberty Movement. They want to steal my identity, my essence. They want to steal your
[2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:50.800]  essence, your children's essence. They want to control you. Don't let them. And you see everybody
[2:41:50.800 --> 2:41:55.840]  rioting for Popeye's fried chicken sandwiches that really aren't even that good. I've had one.
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:01.680]  And will they riot for iodine that's on record boosting your IQ and increasing fertility and
[2:42:01.680 --> 2:42:05.760]  health? Will they riot for fish oil that's so good for your brain, your cardiovascular system,
[2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:11.840]  your eyesight, your whole way of life? I'm just addicted to fish oil. No. Notice the system gives
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:17.120]  you some gross GMO crappy tasting thing that people riot believing they're getting something
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:22.160]  really special because they heard it was great. That's all false. But we're promoting things.
[2:42:22.160 --> 2:42:26.240]  There aren't like magic lottery tickets that won 10 million when you still feel like you're part
[2:42:26.240 --> 2:42:30.640]  of something. So you get into it. This is something where DNA Force Plus really does make your
[2:42:30.640 --> 2:42:35.360]  telomeres last longer, really does clean out your DNA, really does clean out your mitochondrial DNA,
[2:42:35.360 --> 2:42:39.440]  really does amazing things with the PQQ and the CoQ 10. It's 50% off right now.
[2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:43.520]  Double patriot points free shipping. That's the big special DNA force. You owe it to yourself to
[2:42:43.520 --> 2:42:48.480]  research it at informerstore.com and find out why it's such an amazing formula. DNA Force Plus,
[2:42:48.480 --> 2:42:52.000]  DNA Force Plus, DNA Force Plus, DNA Force Plus.
[2:42:53.920 --> 2:43:00.320]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times, I will never give
[2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:08.480]  in. I will never give up, but I could give out. And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing
[2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:15.520]  all their crimes against humanity, to see evil running rampant like this, and to know that most
[2:43:15.520 --> 2:43:21.600]  Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace, that most Americans have already been shadowband
[2:43:21.600 --> 2:43:28.400]  by big tech, and to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they
[2:43:28.400 --> 2:43:35.920]  have by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com, and band.video, and that people
[2:43:35.920 --> 2:43:40.800]  are hungry for the truth now more than ever, and that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth
[2:43:40.800 --> 2:43:47.440]  they don't want you to have is at infowords.com.com, slash show, and band.video. So take heart, folks.
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:51.920]  They've had to censor everybody to show everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't
[2:43:51.920 --> 2:43:58.560]  beat us fair and square. I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to
[2:43:58.560 --> 2:44:04.080]  tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[2:44:04.080 --> 2:44:08.880]  I could see where the globalists were going. I could see what their in-game agenda was,
[2:44:08.880 --> 2:44:13.760]  what their goal was, and I knew that when they were setting us up to be deplatformed,
[2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:17.040]  that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody
[2:44:17.680 --> 2:44:25.440]  off air, to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers,
[2:44:25.440 --> 2:44:30.720]  so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed. What the globalists really feared
[2:44:30.720 --> 2:44:37.440]  was independent media and platforms in the future. It was the model of info wars as much as the
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:43.600]  information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous
[2:44:43.600 --> 2:44:48.400]  lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed, and that's why keeping info wars on the air
[2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:51.360]  is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[2:44:51.360 --> 2:45:01.440]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War when 3 million
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:08.000]  Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines. More than 50 to 1,
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:13.840]  some estimates have it, but the point is they were outnumbered and the General was told,
[2:45:13.840 --> 2:45:18.480]  General, we're completely surrounded. He said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:25.520]  Well, that's the point that info wars has reached and it really is epic. It really is biblical and
[2:45:25.520 --> 2:45:31.120]  we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support, but it's going to become more critical
[2:45:31.680 --> 2:45:37.600]  than ever as the censorship becomes complete and it's not just Americans, but folks all
[2:45:37.600 --> 2:45:43.120]  over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower
[2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:49.840]  or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars having
[2:45:49.840 --> 2:45:58.960]  its own platform, that checkmate's the globalist. A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[2:45:59.680 --> 2:46:08.480]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to? How far will they go?
[2:46:08.480 --> 2:46:15.040]  What's their limit? And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[2:46:16.320 --> 2:46:24.080]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit. We've been taught in modern
[2:46:24.080 --> 2:46:30.480]  culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will. There's no devil or
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:37.600]  the God, but those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress
[2:46:37.600 --> 2:46:43.840]  and where we can live and what our houses can be like. They just don't want us to have any values
[2:46:43.840 --> 2:46:49.920]  so they can run over us. Oxford's banned clapping. University's the U.S. of banned 21 guns salutes
[2:46:49.920 --> 2:47:08.080]  for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[2:47:20.320 --> 2:47:26.960]  All right, let's go right to your phone calls ladies and gentlemen. Carlos,
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:30.000]  because we've got open phones for everybody, is a regular caller always smart.
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:35.280]  We're going to move quick. Carlos in Canada, what is your view on the show trial of Roger Stone?
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:39.680]  It's a pity that it wasn't like Jesse Smollett, right?
[2:47:40.880 --> 2:47:44.080]  Yeah. He got a nice break, didn't he?
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:50.240]  That's because he was trying to start a race war. He was doing his job. Yeah, exactly. Well,
[2:47:50.240 --> 2:47:58.720]  it's actually, Judge Amy Berman Jackson is a very experienced lawyer. She was in fact so
[2:47:58.720 --> 2:48:04.160]  experienced that she dismissed the case and the allegations and the charges against Hillary Clinton
[2:48:04.160 --> 2:48:12.240]  in the Benghazi case. And it seems to me that have been an appointee of President Obama.
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:19.040]  This might have been irrelevant. Again, it demanded for a case subsequently and now Roger Stone.
[2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:24.080]  Now, basically, a judge knows how to run a case and from what I read in the literature,
[2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:32.880]  Roger Stone wasn't very wise in depicting with crosshairs and a picture and so on. I think he
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:43.280]  lost it for a while. But I hope that this judge will take relevance and in fact that she has to
[2:48:43.280 --> 2:48:49.040]  be objective as a judge and I hope that in all fairness, it doesn't go any further than that
[2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:54.720]  because there is an underlying story that people very little talk about and that is that the
[2:48:54.720 --> 2:49:02.480]  financing of judges and district attorneys by George Soros' organization is very, very advanced
[2:49:02.480 --> 2:49:09.280]  in the United States and the judicial system is under the risk of being corrupted by gazillionaires
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:16.560]  who choose in district attorneys the particular agendas they want to carry.
[2:49:18.320 --> 2:49:21.840]  Well, Brother Carlos, I appreciate your call and you've been calling in for years and I usually
[2:49:21.840 --> 2:49:25.840]  agree with you but maybe you missed it because I haven't really closed the case. Thanks for the call.
[2:49:27.040 --> 2:49:32.000]  Roger Stone did not put out on the Instagram a picture of crosshairs over the judge.
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:38.720]  He posted an article from a site that had bullet points with a circle with lines that's the site's
[2:49:39.360 --> 2:49:44.560]  symbol that they put out by bullet points with bullet points on how she was corrupt
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:52.240]  and so they just said that was crosshairs. Kind of like, there it is on screen, kind of like
[2:49:53.600 --> 2:49:57.840]  we had the grim reaper in here talking about Jeffrey Epstein during a four-hour show
[2:49:57.840 --> 2:50:02.800]  and then the national news said we had a grim reaper in here saying we'd kill the juries.
[2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:07.040]  Of course, the news didn't show that. Even Brian Williams had a report on it. I'm told,
[2:50:07.040 --> 2:50:13.200]  what a fraud. No, no, they just say, oh, we had a grim reaper on there. So it's my grim reaper is
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:18.160]  even more removed than that but that's what they do. If anybody's lost in the last few years,
[2:50:18.160 --> 2:50:22.720]  it's me sometimes but I'm losing it in a good way, you know what I mean? Okay, thank you, sir.
[2:50:22.720 --> 2:50:30.000]  Let's talk to Gary in Florida then Sergeant Gary on the air. Welcome. How are you doing, Alex?
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:35.600]  Good, brother. I want to tell you my first transmission for you, all your listeners
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:42.400]  is that 12 years ago I was given a year and a half to live with the fourth stage cancer
[2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:48.000]  and I told them to get their dumb medicines that don't work, started some herbs,
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:53.360]  went on a lot of your stuff and I'm still here fighting. So that's first the transmission.
[2:50:53.360 --> 2:50:58.640]  Beautiful. The second transmission I have for the followers, I called before and I said,
[2:50:58.640 --> 2:51:03.840]  Roger, it was one of the keys. And I said, you're also a key and I'll tell you why.
[2:51:05.120 --> 2:51:12.720]  I said they let Assange go and that was Pompeo and everything is tied to Russia and the reason
[2:51:12.720 --> 2:51:19.600]  they're using Russia is we know with that whole thing with the Mueller. The Ukraine thing now
[2:51:19.600 --> 2:51:25.680]  we're noticing is being tied back to Russia. He was weak on Ukraine because Ukraine is fighting
[2:51:25.680 --> 2:51:32.880]  Russia, so forth and so on. The correlation with Roger to Assange, he's part of Russia. You,
[2:51:33.760 --> 2:51:40.400]  same thing. And we're going to use all these different things we thought was to get Hillary in.
[2:51:40.400 --> 2:51:45.120]  Okay. Now the next thing after Ukraine, if they throw a shift over the thing,
[2:51:45.760 --> 2:51:50.480]  they're going to go after his taxes and if they open the taxes, they'll tie it to Russia.
[2:51:50.480 --> 2:51:55.200]  They're going to keep going one thing after the next and keep tying it to Russia.
[2:51:55.760 --> 2:52:00.000]  That's the one thing. The next thing I'm going to say is one way or another, we're going to get
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:07.040]  Roger out. The last part of the transmission, because I know I'm in limited time, when I listen
[2:52:07.040 --> 2:52:14.080]  to you, you're like a bow in a china shop. You know so much. You have knowledge. You have content.
[2:52:14.640 --> 2:52:20.880]  You have contacts. That's why you're a threat to them. But you also have great people and you
[2:52:20.880 --> 2:52:30.080]  can't listen to everyone show. You had a guy, Matt Bracken, and he did a show with this ex-CIA guy.
[2:52:30.800 --> 2:52:35.280]  I think his name was Johnson. I saw it. We need to get that fellow back on. Yeah, he was a high
[2:52:35.280 --> 2:52:42.480]  level CIA. That was a good interview. He explained that not only does Brennan still have his
[2:52:45.280 --> 2:52:52.320]  what do you call it? Security clearance. Right. But oh, Brennan still commands a whole deep state
[2:52:52.320 --> 2:52:57.440]  group and they literally, Trump ordered him to lose his security clearance. The deep state wouldn't
[2:52:57.440 --> 2:53:03.200]  do it. Well, then Trump literally fires and has indicted who did that. It's a governmental
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:08.400]  mutiny against the president and the people. I mean, that's what it is. So Haskell's still in
[2:53:08.400 --> 2:53:14.480]  charge. I remember Ray. See, unlike they were, I remember things. That guy, Ray, was in front.
[2:53:14.480 --> 2:53:20.240]  They asked him, what is the number one problem with, and what's going on? What is the number one
[2:53:20.240 --> 2:53:26.000]  problem? He said white nationalists. Okay, so they tell you what they're planning in the future.
[2:53:26.560 --> 2:53:31.040]  This guy, Barr, is supposed to. That's right. White people have been chosen as the group to
[2:53:31.040 --> 2:53:35.680]  persecute and then to identify the Bill of Rights Constitution and freedom with white people so
[2:53:35.680 --> 2:53:39.840]  that all the new immigrants want to reject Americana because they see it as white supremacist and then
[2:53:39.840 --> 2:53:45.040]  they themselves never get to enjoy that great birthright. Great points. God bless you, Gary.
[2:53:46.080 --> 2:53:49.760]  We're unified by the Bill of Rights and Constitution. We're unified by love of America.
[2:53:51.040 --> 2:53:56.160]  They want to taint nationalism. The existence of the country itself with these white elites that
[2:53:56.160 --> 2:54:01.200]  don't like the brown people so that brown people then hate America. It's just totally cold-blooded.
[2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:05.760]  It's in the WikiLeaks and you're absolutely right, sir. God bless you. Okay, Sergeant in
[2:54:05.760 --> 2:54:10.960]  California, you're on the air. Good afternoon, sir. How are you today? I'm good. Thanks for calling.
[2:54:11.920 --> 2:54:17.280]  Thank you for having me. I just wanted to let you know I'm a daily user of the Real Red Pill Plus
[2:54:17.280 --> 2:54:21.680]  Ultimate Fish Oil and, of course, the Alexa Pure Breathe. I have two of those in my house.
[2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:27.360]  Your products are phenomenal. The iodine, I forgot the X2. Can't forget the X2. Love, love,
[2:54:27.360 --> 2:54:32.880]  love the iodine. I actually, believe it or not, I put a drop or two into my kid's bottle every
[2:54:32.880 --> 2:54:39.040]  week. Once a week, every week, you know, just give him a little iodine kick. And, man, he's not even
[2:54:39.040 --> 2:54:43.520]  two years old yet. He knows colors and, you know, he's already saying- Oh, my daughter's a little
[2:54:43.520 --> 2:54:47.680]  more than two and a half years old and everyone freaks out. She knows hundreds of songs. She
[2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:53.680]  speaks in complete sentences. She can literally, you know, jump on top of a table from the ground.
[2:54:53.680 --> 2:54:59.360]  People go, what is this, a Tasmanian di-devil or something? And that's because fish oil, clean
[2:54:59.360 --> 2:55:04.880]  fish oil, iodine, everything. And, of course, no vaccines. Yeah. She basically has, like,
[2:55:04.880 --> 2:55:10.480]  lasers shooting on the rise. Yes, sir. That's exactly how I feel about my son. And before I
[2:55:10.480 --> 2:55:15.520]  ask my question here, I just want you to know you are a breath of fresh air in this toxic world.
[2:55:15.520 --> 2:55:22.000]  Not to sound too sycophantic or anything. No, brother, it's not that. It's just that all of us
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:26.640]  are in this fight. You're awesome. And I'm just saying you are the answer. That's all I'm saying.
[2:55:27.520 --> 2:55:31.520]  And I bring you to the third dimension all the time to people I know. I mean,
[2:55:31.520 --> 2:55:36.160]  I'm out at Swatmeats and I see these beautiful families together. And the first thing I think of
[2:55:36.160 --> 2:55:39.840]  is, you know, when we're talking about California and how bad it is here, and I'm like,
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:42.400]  well, if you're in the Gulf of Alaska in the Civil War, they're like, no. And I'm like,
[2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:46.640]  you need to get into that. You need to get into the arena. You need to help us out. So I'm spreading
[2:55:46.640 --> 2:55:52.000]  word about you. I'm hacking the third dimension every day for you. And my question, where's Gerald
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:58.400]  Maddler? You know, that's a great point. He's supposedly running all this in the house. And
[2:55:58.400 --> 2:56:03.760]  he's MIA after it looked like he had that stroke. Remember on TV a few months ago? He collapsed?
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:09.600]  Yes, sir. In that question in response to a great point you had it, you brought up yesterday that
[2:56:09.600 --> 2:56:15.840]  you didn't even really elaborate on was this impeachment inquiry hearing crap is all going on
[2:56:15.840 --> 2:56:21.040]  in an intelligence committee. That's unprecedented and unheard of. Where's the judiciary committee?
[2:56:21.040 --> 2:56:26.400]  It's a coup by the rogue intelligence agencies run by John Brennan. John Brennan was on C-SPAN.
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:30.480]  They go, thank God for the deep state. We're taking Trump out. They're all like, yay. And like,
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:34.960]  there's the enemy, anti-American globalists that sold us out, that hate the country.
[2:56:34.960 --> 2:56:40.240]  And then, and they're all a bunch of chicken net devil worshipers and pedophiles and the
[2:56:40.240 --> 2:56:45.520]  and the Crip Keepers and they can't even walk. We're all just bowing to their evil. Oh, Hillary,
[2:56:45.520 --> 2:56:50.080]  you stinking witch. People go, oh my God, she'll kill you. You went and bullhorned her and got
[2:56:50.080 --> 2:56:55.200]  in her face. Whatever. I get killed. I'm not looking for that. But whatever, it's a war.
[2:56:56.240 --> 2:56:59.920]  All I know is we're going to win this thing. We have to get past the fear, stop caring what
[2:56:59.920 --> 2:57:02.640]  people think and tell the truth and damn, you're damn right. I appreciate you. God bless you.
[2:57:02.640 --> 2:57:07.600]  Sergeant, just keep spreading the word for all of us and say it's forbidden information. It's
[2:57:07.600 --> 2:57:10.960]  the most demonized show in the world. Why do you think they attack it? Why do they have all
[2:57:10.960 --> 2:57:15.280]  the shows like Homeland and the Good Doctor attacking Alex Jones and admitting it and all of
[2:57:15.280 --> 2:57:21.120]  this? Why? Because we've got their number and we're not afraid. And I'm nothing special, folks.
[2:57:21.920 --> 2:57:27.840]  I'm telling you, once you get triggered into the real reality of this, you're like, whoa.
[2:57:28.480 --> 2:57:32.160]  And all of a sudden you turn these parts of your brain on that are to fight evil and build the next
[2:57:32.160 --> 2:57:37.120]  level. It's like you've got the whole operating system. God knows. Here you want it? Turn it on
[2:57:37.920 --> 2:57:42.080]  and you'll have discernment. You'll see with the new eyes. We'll be back hour number four.
[2:57:45.520 --> 2:57:50.560]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from
[2:57:50.560 --> 2:57:56.560]  New York City to Florida where he's always said he planned to retire to and the left got so
[2:57:56.560 --> 2:58:05.040]  excited. They said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running
[2:58:05.040 --> 2:58:10.800]  to Florida. Well, now we know why the president did that. He knew the leftist-controlled appeals
[2:58:10.800 --> 2:58:15.440]  courts were going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and
[2:58:15.440 --> 2:58:22.560]  harass every business partner he's got. They want to terrorize people that he's worked with.
[2:58:22.560 --> 2:58:28.080]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed
[2:58:28.080 --> 2:58:34.400]  to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private. So all those people out there holding
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:41.520]  their breath for the president to resign, in his words, we're kicking the deep states ass and he's
[2:58:41.520 --> 2:58:51.200]  never going to resign. A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level
[2:58:51.200 --> 2:58:59.920]  of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to? How far will they go? What's their limit? And he
[2:58:59.920 --> 2:59:08.640]  said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit. The answer is there is no limit to
[2:59:08.640 --> 2:59:17.200]  evil. It is a bottomless pit. We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist
[2:59:17.200 --> 2:59:23.200]  or that there's no free will. There's no devil or the god. But those very same people have all
[2:59:23.200 --> 2:59:30.400]  these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses
[2:59:30.400 --> 2:59:36.800]  can be like. They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us. Oxford's band
[2:59:36.800 --> 2:59:42.480]  clapping. University of the U.S. of band 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous
[2:59:42.480 --> 2:59:50.400]  cult leaders and it's time to reject them. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:55.680 --> 3:00:01.600]  News, analysis, reports. It's the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:04.000 --> 3:00:07.280]  All right, let's move quick through more of your great calls. I've been trying to go to more calls.
[3:00:07.280 --> 3:00:10.720]  I've been doing a little bit better job but you've got my commitment. Tomorrow I'm going to take at
[3:00:10.720 --> 3:00:14.960]  least two hours of calls. More calls come out during the war room with Owen Schreuer. More
[3:00:14.960 --> 3:00:20.000]  calls coming up during firepower with the great crew there. I'm going to go to Kevin and a few
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  others. I want to get jammed in here really quickly here. Brad NPA you're on the air. Thanks for calling.
[3:00:27.440 --> 3:00:31.040]  Good afternoon, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Thanks for all you do. Thanks for all your great
[3:00:31.040 --> 3:00:35.520]  products. Thank you. Love the toothpaste. Can't wait to try that new toothpaste that your dad
[3:00:35.520 --> 3:00:40.000]  developed. Thank you. And thanks for humanizing everything because you do a great job of that.
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:46.400]  I mean, you've been on the air so long and done so much work. It works so hard for so long. It's
[3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:52.720]  just hard to believe but great job. Keep it up. Thank you. I wanted to just say that I think
[3:00:52.720 --> 3:00:56.800]  the deep state, we need to throw that term out and just say CIA because I think they're running
[3:00:56.800 --> 3:01:02.080]  everything. They are. They're trying to run Trump out of the office. They're running all the
[3:01:02.080 --> 3:01:08.800]  shenanigans with the elections probably, I'm guessing. And it's just a bunch of corrupt bureaucrats.
[3:01:08.800 --> 3:01:16.560]  It's not James Bond. It's a bunch of hunchbacks like Brennan and Clapper and this wimpy little,
[3:01:16.560 --> 3:01:24.160]  you know, lib turd, Sierra Mella. What a joke. These people are pathetic. They're a bunch of
[3:01:24.160 --> 3:01:29.920]  Ed Box. They all dress up little outfits, new rituals and a bunch of sick freaks.
[3:01:31.200 --> 3:01:35.680]  Then they must all be compromised obviously because they just push their buttons and they get
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:42.240]  to get these people up on fake chargers. I can't believe Roger Stone would be convicted. They've
[3:01:42.240 --> 3:01:49.200]  got nothing on him. They take Biden who is caught on the council foreign relations bragging about
[3:01:51.040 --> 3:01:55.840]  the Ukraine and what he did and then out Trump's going to be impeached. I mean,
[3:01:55.840 --> 3:02:02.480]  this is upside down world. It's unbelievable. You're absolutely right, sir. What do you think
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:07.040]  about the Kentucky situation? I saw that's why you called. Yeah, well, I was another thing. I mean,
[3:02:07.040 --> 3:02:12.320]  I was watching the returns come in that night and I saw that the Kentucky governor was ahead and I'm
[3:02:12.320 --> 3:02:17.200]  like, uh-huh. I know what's going to happen. I know they're going to say he lost and it's going to be
[3:02:17.200 --> 3:02:23.120]  close and that's exactly what they did. And of course, I knew there was going to be shenanigans
[3:02:23.120 --> 3:02:27.840]  and you definitely need to get Bev Harrison. And they do it close because if they steal it big,
[3:02:27.840 --> 3:02:31.120]  there's more fake votes to be found. That's why they only stole it by 5,000.
[3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:36.800]  And it's not unlike assassinations. And I'm just throwing that out there because
[3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:40.880]  you kill President Kennedy, you kill Bobby Kennedy, you kill Martin Luther King,
[3:02:40.880 --> 3:02:47.360]  you kill and you steal an election. Once it's done, what can you do? They're just going like,
[3:02:47.360 --> 3:02:53.600]  hey, there's nothing wrong here. Nothing to see. Move along. That's exactly what they do. God
[3:02:53.600 --> 3:02:57.120]  bless you. Amazing callers. And I went to him late. I feel bad. I'm not going to get to all these.
[3:02:57.120 --> 3:03:03.600]  I'm trying to get to Wilde, Eli, and a few others. Let's go to the caller in Ohio. I think it's
[3:03:03.600 --> 3:03:10.720]  Eli. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. How's it going? Good, brother. Go ahead. Hey, so a couple things I wanted
[3:03:10.720 --> 3:03:17.120]  to talk about. Number one is the saturation of information. It seems like in the last three
[3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:22.960]  years, things have just accelerated to the point where you can't even keep up with everything.
[3:03:22.960 --> 3:03:29.280]  And they're using that as cover. When they come out with one thing, it's the parlor trick.
[3:03:29.280 --> 3:03:34.000]  While the magician is using his left hand to dazzle you, you're ignoring what his right hand's
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:40.720]  doing. And of course, what his right hand's doing is, you know, more of this crap with the
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:46.560]  it's the P and the three cups game. And that's why they hate enforcers. We laser beam in on
[3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:52.560]  what they're really doing. Well, it's what people are willing to accept. It's how far can you push
[3:03:52.560 --> 3:04:00.480]  the overton window before you dial back and say, okay, well, we were a little off base here with
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:06.000]  Beto O'Rourke and saying, hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. And now they're
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:12.160]  going to dial it back and say, well, we're just going to ask for magazine limitations or ban
[3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:16.800]  certain semi-autos and things like that. What I really think they're trying to cover up right now
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:23.120]  is the fact that if Donald Trump gets to 2020 and he wins the election, which we all know,
[3:04:23.120 --> 3:04:29.600]  if he makes it that far and they don't impeach him, he will. That's the whole reason why they're
[3:04:29.600 --> 3:04:33.920]  running this. Oh, they're in trouble. Paul Watson's about to take over about the huge rebellion in
[3:04:33.920 --> 3:04:37.680]  Europe against the globalist. They're in trouble, but the fight's very, very, really, very, very
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:41.520]  intense. I'm sorry to Kevin. I'm sorry to Wilde. Thank you, sir. Call me back tomorrow. We go to
[3:04:41.520 --> 3:04:47.280]  the Heatherline guys. Love you. Paul Watson takes over from England and then the war room with
[3:04:47.280 --> 3:04:52.000]  Owen Schreuer is coming up and then it's seven o'clock. Firepower will Johnson, Tom Pepper.
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:58.160]  In full war's life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet.
[3:04:58.720 --> 3:05:05.600]  Super silver whitening toothpaste. This is proprietary. This is with the top lab in the
[3:05:05.600 --> 3:05:12.080]  country and it is incredibly high quality. This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:16.720]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria. It recalcifies
[3:05:16.720 --> 3:05:23.120]  the teeth. It does so many things on so many fronts. These beautiful tubes of super silver
[3:05:23.120 --> 3:05:29.280]  toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates as low as we can go
[3:05:29.280 --> 3:05:35.040]  and they're going to sell out very, very quickly. Super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be
[3:05:35.040 --> 3:05:40.880]  a hit. I'm very, very proud of it. I want to thank my father, a retired dentist for spearheading this
[3:05:40.880 --> 3:05:45.920]  the last two years and developing it. It's 25% off out of the gates. That's as low as we can go
[3:05:45.920 --> 3:06:12.720]  because it's very, very expensive to produce. Get yours today at infowarslife.com and I got
[3:06:12.720 --> 3:06:19.120]  the commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against a state
[3:06:19.120 --> 3:06:23.440]  prosecutor and they didn't. So they said they were walking out to Prescott. I said,
[3:06:23.440 --> 3:06:29.120]  no, we're not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority.
[3:06:29.120 --> 3:06:33.840]  You're not the president. The president said, I said, call them. I said, I'm telling you,
[3:06:33.840 --> 3:06:37.440]  you're not getting a billion dollars. I said, you're not getting a billion. I'm going to be
[3:06:37.440 --> 3:06:41.360]  leaving here. I think it was about six hours. I looked. I said, we're leaving in six hours.
[3:06:41.360 --> 3:06:45.440]  If the prosecutor's not fired, they're not getting the money. Little son of a bitch.
[3:06:45.440 --> 3:07:15.280]  Yeah, you're fired. And they put in place someone who was solid.
[3:07:15.680 --> 3:07:28.800]  Live from London, England. It's Paul Joseph Watson with summit.news.
[3:07:30.240 --> 3:07:37.680]  And when the 14th edition of the show, I just got back from Poland, spent most of the week
[3:07:37.680 --> 3:07:44.480]  in Poland having traveled there from Budapest, Hungary. Last week to attend the Polish
[3:07:44.480 --> 3:07:51.840]  Independence Day march of 2019. This is the big patriotic march to celebrate Poland's independence
[3:07:52.480 --> 3:07:57.040]  from back in 1918. Of course, Poland ceased to exist as a country for about, I think it was
[3:07:57.040 --> 3:08:05.280]  about 123 years before that. So we got to march with the apparent extremist far right as the media
[3:08:05.280 --> 3:08:10.080]  has announced and decried them for years and years and years. Turns out they're not actually
[3:08:10.080 --> 3:08:17.520]  that extremist that far right at all. It was mainly from what I saw patriotic families fighting for
[3:08:17.520 --> 3:08:24.240]  the future of their country, fighting to avoid the same fate as Western countries in terms of
[3:08:24.240 --> 3:08:29.280]  the revolt against globalism. So we're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about
[3:08:30.320 --> 3:08:34.480]  Europe in general. We've got massive problems with grenade attacks in Sweden.
[3:08:34.480 --> 3:08:40.720]  We've got more terror attacks in France. We have a situation in the Netherlands where
[3:08:40.720 --> 3:08:44.960]  the Islamic call to prayer is now being blasted out. People are revolting against that.
[3:08:45.520 --> 3:08:51.200]  The Vox party in Spain, the populist party is more successful than ever before. So we've really
[3:08:51.200 --> 3:08:56.800]  got a lot of positive news today regarding the revolt in Europe against globalism.
[3:08:57.600 --> 3:09:03.760]  But we spent about four days in Warsaw, Poland this week, not only marching on the independence
[3:09:03.760 --> 3:09:08.960]  march, but meeting with members of parliament. We actually got to visit, we're shown around
[3:09:08.960 --> 3:09:14.960]  the Polish parliament yesterday because there's a new federation. There's a new coalition of populist
[3:09:14.960 --> 3:09:19.360]  right-wing parties that in the recent Polish election, which took place, I think, as recently
[3:09:19.360 --> 3:09:24.640]  as last week, won 11 seats in parliament. And now they are going to be able to push back
[3:09:25.280 --> 3:09:30.800]  against the more centrist, conservative party in Poland, the ruling party. They call it the
[3:09:30.800 --> 3:09:36.880]  nationalist party, but it seems to be getting less nationalist or more globalist by the day,
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:41.520]  similar to the conservative party in Britain, which, of course, led to the creation beforehand of
[3:09:41.520 --> 3:09:48.160]  UKIP as a more populist pressure party, and then the Brexit party with Nigel Farage. So we have a
[3:09:48.160 --> 3:09:56.800]  lot of similarities taking place in Poland. We got to meet Janusz Korwin-Micker, who, of course,
[3:09:56.800 --> 3:10:02.560]  became a very controversial figure last year when he did a UK TV interview. He had his opinions,
[3:10:02.560 --> 3:10:08.800]  his thoughts completely misrepresented. We got to meet him. We got to meet Christoph Bozak,
[3:10:08.800 --> 3:10:14.480]  who is also a newly elected member of parliament in Poland as part of this, they called right-wing
[3:10:14.480 --> 3:10:22.080]  coalition. And of course, we got to meet Gregor Brown, who is also a member of parliament. So big
[3:10:22.080 --> 3:10:27.840]  things happening in Poland, and they were very hospitable, very interested to work
[3:10:29.040 --> 3:10:33.680]  with the media world, the online world coming out of the United Kingdom and the United States.
[3:10:33.680 --> 3:10:39.200]  So many exciting projects planned for that. But to just give you an idea of how this has been
[3:10:39.200 --> 3:10:43.920]  risk-represented by the media, this is their national independence day. They have a march every
[3:10:43.920 --> 3:10:51.360]  year to celebrate Poland, to celebrate patriotism, to celebrate families, a form of resistance
[3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:56.800]  against the globalism, the cultural impositions that are being foisted on the West in many
[3:10:56.800 --> 3:11:02.800]  other countries. And how does the media portray it? We have a headline out of Vice,
[3:11:03.520 --> 3:11:09.760]  Bigotry and Fear Filled Warsaw Streets on Polish Independence Day. Really, I was right in the
[3:11:09.760 --> 3:11:16.720]  middle of it, marched with them for about five hours, didn't see much bigotry, certainly didn't
[3:11:16.720 --> 3:11:23.520]  feel any fear whatsoever. It says on Monday, the crowd of thousands celebrated the national holiday
[3:11:23.520 --> 3:11:31.760]  by taking aim at Jewish people, Islam, abortion, and the LGBT community. Now, to get this right,
[3:11:31.760 --> 3:11:40.320]  there are 150,000 people on the streets. The vast, vast majority of them were just patriotic,
[3:11:40.320 --> 3:11:46.240]  family-loving, country-loving Poles, were their tiny pockets of actual right-wing extremists
[3:11:46.240 --> 3:11:52.160]  wearing Nazi memorabilia and things like that. Yes, but in comparison to the vast majority,
[3:11:52.160 --> 3:11:58.720]  it was miniscule, absolutely miniscule. And many of these Poles carrying banners
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:04.240]  were carrying banners that said they were against fascism, they were against communism,
[3:12:04.240 --> 3:12:09.520]  they were for Poland, for the territorial sovereignty and against the European Union.
[3:12:09.520 --> 3:12:14.240]  That's why they're being attacked by the media. The article says, in recent years, Poland's
[3:12:14.240 --> 3:12:18.720]  independent state celebrations on the 11th of November have increasingly become a show
[3:12:18.720 --> 3:12:26.560]  of far-right extremism. Again, I did not see with my own eyes any far-right extremism whatsoever.
[3:12:27.280 --> 3:12:31.120]  This year's edition was no different, with the largest events again organized by
[3:12:31.120 --> 3:12:36.720]  extreme right-wing and nationalist groups. Recently, Polish voters reinstated the Law and
[3:12:36.720 --> 3:12:42.560]  Justice Party, that is the mainstream nationalist party, they call it nationalist,
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:46.400]  but it's really centrist, whose campaign was largely based on protecting Polish
[3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:51.280]  values by furiously attacking LGBT minorities. It goes on to say,
[3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:56.160]  the gathering in the center of Warsaw kicked off with a prayer, God forbid, because of course,
[3:12:56.160 --> 3:13:01.520]  this is an overwhelmingly Catholic country, the media absolutely hates that,
[3:13:01.520 --> 3:13:06.880]  before organizers address the crowd. From the podium, Robert Bakowitz, head of the
[3:13:06.880 --> 3:13:12.160]  Independence March Association and a former district head of the far-right national radical
[3:13:12.160 --> 3:13:18.880]  camp said, there is no Polishness without Catholicism. How dare he, before making anti-submitted
[3:13:18.880 --> 3:13:24.240]  claims from what I heard from the translation, no, no, anti-submitted claims. There is an issue
[3:13:24.240 --> 3:13:30.800]  in Poland, which is a lot of countries in Europe have this issue, whereby Jewish people who have
[3:13:30.800 --> 3:13:37.200]  inheritance and no family to pass it on to, certain lobby groups within Poland are trying to get that
[3:13:37.200 --> 3:13:45.040]  money sent to Israel, but Polish people want the money to stay within the country. Is that anti-Semitic
[3:13:45.040 --> 3:13:50.000]  or is that merely protecting the interests of your own country? We met members of the Warsaw
[3:13:50.000 --> 3:13:55.760]  Resistance uprising, a 90-year-old woman who was a member of that, was she a neo-Nazi too?
[3:13:56.480 --> 3:14:02.640]  We met people carrying banners with the swastika crossed out saying they were against fascism,
[3:14:02.640 --> 3:14:09.040]  and here's Vice demonizing them as neo-Nazis. The article continues, the crowd's hateful chance
[3:14:09.040 --> 3:14:14.160]  took aim at a range of perceived enemies from communist, leftist, and Muslims to the LGBT
[3:14:14.160 --> 3:14:21.040]  community. Well, no, what they were chanting about mainly is the fact that Poland, the main
[3:14:21.040 --> 3:14:26.000]  party in Poland, the ruling party has introduced a law which basically says you can't propagandize
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:33.440]  sexually or you can't encourage children to have sex. It's an anti-pedophilia law. The European
[3:14:33.440 --> 3:14:39.920]  Union is now railing against that. Apparently to oppose that is to attack the LGBT community.
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:46.960]  I think honest people within the LGBT community will really want their movement, their rights,
[3:14:46.960 --> 3:14:52.080]  or what they represent linked with pedophilia, which is what this Polish law actually tackles.
[3:14:52.080 --> 3:14:57.840]  And I'm going to get into that on the other side. But the article continues, at one point a group
[3:14:57.840 --> 3:15:02.240]  of cancer protesters from the anti-fascist group citizens of Poland attempted to block the march
[3:15:02.240 --> 3:15:07.520]  didn't see them, basically saw no cancer protests whatsoever in the area that I was in,
[3:15:07.520 --> 3:15:14.480]  again, 150,000 people marched. Late to a guest of the organizers, a discredited American psychologist
[3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:19.120]  Paul Cameron told the crowd brave polls saved Europe from Islam. Now they will save it from
[3:15:19.120 --> 3:15:25.760]  the deadly LGBT invasion. Yes, there was a lot of chance against LGBT because they see what's
[3:15:25.760 --> 3:15:33.040]  happening in America, in Sweden, in many of the European countries, with drag queen story time
[3:15:33.040 --> 3:15:40.560]  and this effort to impose in the culture war, not just a respect for LGBT people, not tolerance of
[3:15:40.560 --> 3:15:47.760]  LGBT people, but actual sexualization of children. And that's part of what they were marching against.
[3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:51.840]  We're going to get back into it more on the other side. Breaking news at summit.news.

[3:17:54.480 --> 3:17:59.680]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New
[3:17:59.680 --> 3:18:05.440]  York City to Florida where he's always said he planned to retire to and the left got so
[3:18:05.440 --> 3:18:13.040]  excited. They said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and
[3:18:13.040 --> 3:18:18.240]  he's running to Florida. Well, now we know why the president did that. He knew the left
[3:18:18.240 --> 3:18:22.880]  has controlled appeals courts. We're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns
[3:18:22.880 --> 3:18:28.880]  so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got. They want to terrorize
[3:18:28.880 --> 3:18:34.640]  people that he's worked with. And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets
[3:18:34.640 --> 3:18:41.120]  around the New York law they've passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:47.520]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign, in his words,
[3:18:47.520 --> 3:18:51.440]  we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[3:18:53.680 --> 3:18:59.120]  Beto Roark came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic
[3:18:59.120 --> 3:19:04.560]  rifles. And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that
[3:19:04.560 --> 3:19:09.920]  he was a hero. Think about that. Now, those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities
[3:19:09.920 --> 3:19:17.200]  they control. Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug
[3:19:17.200 --> 3:19:23.520]  dealing and incredible levels of violent crime. They know what they're doing. And now the Supreme
[3:19:23.520 --> 3:19:29.280]  courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do
[3:19:29.280 --> 3:19:33.440]  using their firearms. My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country's under such incredible
[3:19:33.440 --> 3:19:39.600]  attack. But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment
[3:19:39.600 --> 3:19:43.760]  and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're not going to
[3:19:43.760 --> 3:19:48.720]  help in the confiscation of guns. So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens.
[3:19:48.720 --> 3:20:05.520]  Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:05.520 --> 3:20:13.920]  Transmitting worldwide from the summit.newstudios in the United Kingdom. You're listening to Paul
[3:20:13.920 --> 3:20:23.040]  Joseph Watson. So Vice magazine and much of the mainstream media demonized the Polish
[3:20:23.040 --> 3:20:28.640]  Independence Day march by calling it in their words a display of bigotry and fear. I was there
[3:20:28.640 --> 3:20:36.480]  amongst the 150,000 marches in Warsaw did not see much evidence whatsoever of bigotry and fear.
[3:20:36.480 --> 3:20:43.520]  I just saw a huge mass of people, families, young and old celebrating their country and
[3:20:43.520 --> 3:20:49.520]  embracing its true ideals, celebrating Catholicism, their faith, huge banners of Jesus Christ
[3:20:49.520 --> 3:20:56.400]  everywhere, people dressed up in military gear, again to celebrate Poland's independence and
[3:20:56.400 --> 3:21:01.920]  reformation as a country which didn't exist for over 100 years before that. But of course,
[3:21:01.920 --> 3:21:08.720]  what does vice show in their photos? They show scary weapons being carried by men in military
[3:21:08.720 --> 3:21:14.480]  uniforms. Yes, it's a celebration of Poland's military history. What do you expect? You know,
[3:21:14.480 --> 3:21:20.480]  there were hussars on horseback. It was really good. The energy was great. People flying flares.
[3:21:21.200 --> 3:21:27.600]  People really united, bonded together in love of patriotism and opposition to globalism.
[3:21:27.600 --> 3:21:34.640]  They carried anti-EU flags. They carried a flag of Poland throughout the whole march, which looked
[3:21:34.640 --> 3:21:39.360]  like it basically went on for a mile. You were watching it at the end of the march as the people
[3:21:39.360 --> 3:21:44.560]  carrying the flag marched through the field, which was the site of the end of the march.
[3:21:44.560 --> 3:21:50.400]  And it literally went on for about half an hour, this flag going through the field with no signs
[3:21:50.400 --> 3:21:56.960]  of it ending. So an absolutely fantastic few days in Poland met a lot of great people there who
[3:21:56.960 --> 3:22:03.200]  were fans of Alex Jones, fans of Infowars, fans of what we do. We had a great meetup afterwards.
[3:22:04.000 --> 3:22:08.320]  And then, of course, we were lucky enough to get a tour of the Polish parliament
[3:22:08.320 --> 3:22:15.040]  from members of the new coalition, the new federation they call it, of populist, quote,
[3:22:15.040 --> 3:22:19.840]  right-wing groups that are now being elected to parliament. They've got 12 seats in parliament.
[3:22:20.720 --> 3:22:24.160]  And one of the issues they're going to be pushing, having seen what's happened
[3:22:24.160 --> 3:22:29.440]  in the West, in America, in many European countries with this drag queen story time,
[3:22:29.440 --> 3:22:34.880]  with the increasing effort to make sexual education in schools applicable to younger and
[3:22:34.880 --> 3:22:42.080]  younger children in the UK now in some schools, children as young as five are being pushed,
[3:22:42.080 --> 3:22:47.680]  having forms of sexual education pushed on them. Polish people, Poland in general,
[3:22:47.680 --> 3:22:53.280]  despite the fact that in comparison to countries like Sweden, which they see recently granted,
[3:22:53.280 --> 3:23:00.960]  the equivalent of $175,000 to directly from the government fund drag queen shows for children,
[3:23:01.520 --> 3:23:06.400]  they're using the inheritance money from people who don't have family, don't have anyone to pass it
[3:23:06.400 --> 3:23:13.120]  on to, basically stealing that money for the purposes of propagandizing LGBT propaganda,
[3:23:13.120 --> 3:23:19.360]  sexualization of children. That's happening in Sweden. Polish people are absolutely dead set
[3:23:19.360 --> 3:23:25.120]  on not allowing that kind of propaganda to infiltrate their own country, which is why we
[3:23:25.120 --> 3:23:30.080]  have this policy being pushed in Poland by the new coalition parliamentarians and there's a
[3:23:30.080 --> 3:23:36.480]  headline out of Reuters. Polish lawmakers vote for bill criminalizing promoting underage sex.
[3:23:37.120 --> 3:23:43.280]  Again, how dare they promote a piece of legislation that discourages pedophilia? How dare they?
[3:23:44.160 --> 3:23:48.640]  Polish lawmakers on Wednesday voted in favor of a bill to criminalize the promotion,
[3:23:48.640 --> 3:23:54.240]  this is a direct quote from the bill, the promotion of underage sexual activity in a move
[3:23:54.240 --> 3:23:59.440]  seen by some as a government effort to court conservative support, which outraged liberals
[3:23:59.440 --> 3:24:05.680]  who say the bill aims to ban sex education. It doesn't seek to do that. In fact, there's a quote
[3:24:05.680 --> 3:24:13.360]  from the bill directly in this second article, which is out of Euro news. It says MEPs vote to
[3:24:13.360 --> 3:24:19.680]  condemn Poland's anti-sex education bill. So members of the European parliament, globalist
[3:24:19.680 --> 3:24:23.840]  members of the European parliament have voted to condemn a bill in Poland which they believe
[3:24:23.840 --> 3:24:28.480]  will criminalize sex education in schools. This is what the actual text of the bill says.
[3:24:29.600 --> 3:24:35.920]  Anyone who promotes or approves sexual intercourse or other sexual activity by a minor
[3:24:36.960 --> 3:24:42.080]  keyword there being minor a child in connection with performing the position, occupation or
[3:24:42.080 --> 3:24:47.120]  performing activities related to upbringing, education, healthcare or care of minors or
[3:24:47.120 --> 3:24:53.760]  operating on school premises is liable to imprisonment up to three years. So they literally
[3:24:53.760 --> 3:25:00.320]  just wrote a bill that says you can't encourage children to have sex illegally with pedophiles
[3:25:00.320 --> 3:25:06.400]  and now members of the European parliament have voted to condemn it. The Polish government
[3:25:06.400 --> 3:25:11.360]  insists this legislation is to protect vulnerable children from pedophilia. This paragraph under
[3:25:11.360 --> 3:25:17.920]  the head of stock pedophilia. This law doesn't speak about any education issues. It only prohibits
[3:25:17.920 --> 3:25:25.680]  promoting pedophilia Polish MEP beta camper insists. However, MEPs, globalist MEPs of the
[3:25:25.680 --> 3:25:36.640]  European Union disagreed. In fact, they voted 471 in favor and only 128 against condemning a bill
[3:25:36.640 --> 3:25:43.200]  which solely discourages promoting pedophilia in schools. Is there any wonder why more and more
[3:25:43.200 --> 3:25:50.000]  Polish people are out on the streets talking about not wanting this LGBT agenda pushed on their
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:25:57.680]  school children when in many cases it's characterized as actually promoting pedophilia as we've seen
[3:25:57.680 --> 3:26:04.640]  with the drag queen story time? Several members of which these drag queens were not getting
[3:26:04.640 --> 3:26:09.360]  background checks were being allowed around children. And in a couple of cases in Houston as
[3:26:09.360 --> 3:26:16.880]  we covered what actual child sex offenders actual pedophiles being allowed into libraries and schools
[3:26:16.880 --> 3:26:22.400]  to talk to children about their lifestyles. Polish people are out on the street saying no,
[3:26:22.400 --> 3:26:26.800]  we don't want to be like that. We don't want to be like Sweden. We don't want to be like the UK
[3:26:26.800 --> 3:26:31.760]  where kids as young as five are being taught about sex education. Now they're being demonized
[3:26:31.760 --> 3:26:38.800]  as racist, bigots and right wing extremists and MEPs are voting to condemn it. Absolutely
[3:26:38.800 --> 3:26:45.600]  incredible. But just the sheer energy, the sheer authenticity of what I saw in Warsaw
[3:26:45.600 --> 3:26:51.040]  was very, very uplifting. And that's the thing. You just don't see that in the UK. In the UK
[3:26:51.040 --> 3:26:56.560]  there have been cases where people who simply try to fly the British flag on their own property,
[3:26:56.560 --> 3:27:02.400]  get threatening letters from local government telling them to take it down because it could
[3:27:02.400 --> 3:27:08.640]  offend minorities and other people who live in the area. And then if they don't take the flag down,
[3:27:08.640 --> 3:27:13.360]  the flag of their own country, which is being flown on their own property in some cases,
[3:27:14.320 --> 3:27:20.960]  other residents nearby tear it down. So yes, Poland sees what's happening in Europe. They see
[3:27:20.960 --> 3:27:27.280]  themselves as the vanguard of a new revolt against globalism and many young people at this march
[3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:32.240]  by being involved in this, by being so patriotic wanting to protect their country.
[3:27:34.160 --> 3:27:37.920]  You know, living lives of authenticity and meaning. This is the thing. This is the same
[3:27:37.920 --> 3:27:44.560]  thing I saw in Hong Kong. In the West, where beset by nihilism, atomized societies where people
[3:27:44.560 --> 3:27:48.560]  don't even talk to each other anymore, don't even talk to their neighbors. They're told that they
[3:27:48.560 --> 3:27:54.160]  should be ashamed of their country, ashamed of their history, ashamed of their skin color.
[3:27:54.160 --> 3:28:01.840]  But in places like Poland, that backlash is really starting to brew. We've seen it in Hungary and
[3:28:01.840 --> 3:28:08.000]  other places as well. So we're going to go back to Poland. It looks like in four or five months
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:13.840]  time and really talk to more of these MPs and try to help them get the message out, try to rally
[3:28:13.840 --> 3:28:21.920]  around this populist, patriotic message that seeks to restore faith, family, and reason
[3:28:22.640 --> 3:28:26.800]  in a clown world, which has now come to the point where literally, as I said before in Sweden,
[3:28:27.360 --> 3:28:32.480]  they're taking the money, the inheritance money from their own citizens and directly funding
[3:28:32.480 --> 3:28:38.560]  through government programs, drag queen story time, where these drag queens, many of them,
[3:28:38.560 --> 3:28:44.880]  not background checked to be around children, are literally being allowed to propagandize
[3:28:44.880 --> 3:28:50.720]  their increasingly bizarre lifestyles to our children. Poland is rejecting that in droves.
[3:28:50.720 --> 3:28:55.840]  Don't go away. We'll be back. We can all agree these are troubled times, right? So do you know

[3:29:49.120 --> 3:30:03.760]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will
[3:30:03.760 --> 3:30:10.000]  take humanity to? How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the limit to which
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:19.040]  other men and women will submit. The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless
[3:30:19.040 --> 3:30:26.800]  pit. We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's
[3:30:26.800 --> 3:30:32.240]  no free will. There's no devil or the God. But those very same people have all these rules for us
[3:30:32.240 --> 3:30:38.960]  about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[3:30:39.520 --> 3:30:45.680]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us. Oxford's banned clapping.
[3:30:45.680 --> 3:30:50.720]  University's the U.S. has banned 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult
[3:30:50.720 --> 3:30:56.480]  leaders and it's time to reject them. The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[3:30:57.440 --> 3:31:04.400]  I've said it many times. I will never give in. I will never give up. But I could give out. And
[3:31:04.400 --> 3:31:09.040]  it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity.
[3:31:09.040 --> 3:31:15.680]  To see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been
[3:31:15.680 --> 3:31:21.360]  silenced in cyberspace. That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[3:31:22.080 --> 3:31:27.760]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have
[3:31:28.480 --> 3:31:34.240]  by spreading the word about news wars dot com, info wars dot com and banned on video.
[3:31:34.240 --> 3:31:38.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever. And that if you tell people,
[3:31:38.000 --> 3:31:43.680]  hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at info wars dot com forward slash show
[3:31:43.680 --> 3:31:48.880]  and banned on video. So take heart folks. They've had to censor everybody to show everybody down
[3:31:48.880 --> 3:31:54.720]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square. I've made a lot of
[3:31:54.720 --> 3:32:00.640]  predictions that have come true. But I'm here to tell you most of those really weren't predictions
[3:32:00.640 --> 3:32:06.080]  that came out of a crystal ball. I could see where the globalists were going. I could see
[3:32:06.080 --> 3:32:11.200]  what their in game agenda was what their goal was. And I knew that when they were setting a
[3:32:11.200 --> 3:32:16.000]  sub PD platformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody
[3:32:16.640 --> 3:32:24.400]  off air to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[3:32:24.400 --> 3:32:29.680]  so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed. What the globalists really feared
[3:32:29.680 --> 3:32:35.920]  was independent media and platforms in the future. It was the model of info wars as
[3:32:35.920 --> 3:32:41.600]  much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance
[3:32:41.600 --> 3:32:46.240]  for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed. And that's why keeping info
[3:32:46.240 --> 3:32:58.560]  wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[3:32:58.560 --> 3:33:17.200]  show live from the summit dot news headquarters. It's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:20.800 --> 3:33:27.040]  We're back on the show before we get into more news out of Europe including what's happening

[3:35:21.840 --> 3:35:29.520]  Now back in March 2017 I put out a tweet which coincided with Trump making comments about the
[3:35:29.520 --> 3:35:35.440]  state of criminality in Sweden which was of course greatly exacerbated by the migrant crisis the
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:40.880]  fact they took in more migrants over that two year period than any other European country.
[3:35:40.880 --> 3:35:47.760]  I put out a tweet challenging journalists to go and visit to go and film the no go zone
[3:35:47.760 --> 3:35:54.320]  ghetto areas of Sweden specifically Malmo where before that tweet was put out. You had a camera
[3:35:54.320 --> 3:36:00.000]  crew from Australia go there and get physically attacked. You had soaring rapes. You had soaring
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:06.480]  violent crime. Trump pointed it out is famous last night in Sweden comment. I challenge journalists
[3:36:06.480 --> 3:36:11.120]  to go out there. And then there was like an international media smear campaign against yours
[3:36:11.120 --> 3:36:17.600]  truly simply for telling journalists to go and do journalism. Of course Tim pool a couple of
[3:36:17.600 --> 3:36:23.280]  weeks later went out and was kicked out or at least forced to leave one of these no go migrant
[3:36:23.280 --> 3:36:29.760]  ghettos proving what I had said. And for the next two years Sweden's violent crime rate has been
[3:36:29.760 --> 3:36:36.960]  soaring their rape statistics have been getting worse. And finally two years later two and a half
[3:36:36.960 --> 3:36:45.360]  years later the mainstream media is finally asking with the BBC headline Sweden's 100 explosions this
[3:36:45.360 --> 3:36:53.200]  year what's going on. It took them two and a half years to ask this question after having demonized
[3:36:53.200 --> 3:37:00.080]  anyone who asked the same question for the past two and a half years. Article reads when three
[3:37:00.080 --> 3:37:04.400]  explosions took place in one night across different parts of Stockholm last month it came as a shock
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:08.880]  to residents there have been blasts in other cities or suburbs but never on their doorstep.
[3:37:09.760 --> 3:37:15.360]  Swedish police are dealing with unprecedented levels of attacks targeting city centre locations too.
[3:37:15.360 --> 3:37:21.440]  The bomb squad was called to deal with 97 explosions in the first nine months of this year.
[3:37:21.440 --> 3:37:27.680]  Now what they like to do apart from attack Christian churches which is happening more
[3:37:27.680 --> 3:37:34.720]  and more in Sweden is attack apartment buildings. This is mostly gang on gang violence but it's gangs
[3:37:34.720 --> 3:37:42.320]  concentrated in these no go ghetto areas. It's second and third generation migrants.
[3:37:43.360 --> 3:37:50.640]  So as the category of crime explosions was not even locked prior to 2017 then in 2018
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:56.320]  there were 162 explosions and in the past two months alone the bomb squad had been called to
[3:37:56.320 --> 3:38:02.960]  almost 30 grenade attacks off the charts. We've got shootings off the charts. What otherwise
[3:38:02.960 --> 3:38:09.920]  should be a very peaceful crime free Sweden and only at the very end of the article that they
[3:38:09.920 --> 3:38:15.280]  actually introduced the idea that this could be related to them bringing in hundreds of thousands
[3:38:15.280 --> 3:38:21.040]  of migrants which exacerbate the problem but again they claim that it's just socioeconomics
[3:38:21.040 --> 3:38:26.240]  that it's not the newly arrived migrants not making the obvious connection that of course
[3:38:26.240 --> 3:38:31.440]  those newly arrived migrants later go on to become second and third generation migrants.
[3:38:31.440 --> 3:38:37.920]  The spectator was more honest in its article about this. They put out an article bomb attacks
[3:38:37.920 --> 3:38:43.280]  in our normal part of Swedish life. Again this is the cultural enrichment the diversity that
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:49.440]  polls are out on the march on the streets marching against. Spectator article makes the point.
[3:38:49.440 --> 3:38:53.760]  Normalization is a term that we've come to associate with domestic violence. The victim
[3:38:53.760 --> 3:39:01.120]  begins to think of abuse as part of everyday life. That classic frog boiling in the pot idea.
[3:39:02.320 --> 3:39:07.440]  Explosions have become so normalized in Sweden that SVT, Sweden's equivalent of the BBC did not
[3:39:07.440 --> 3:39:14.800]  even mention the three explosions in the country's capital on its national news program that evening
[3:39:14.800 --> 3:39:20.320]  and in fact we've covered other stories where left wing Swedish newspapers will literally
[3:39:20.320 --> 3:39:26.240]  send out reporters to harass people who've posted comments online about maybe diversity
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:31.760]  not being such a strength to go out literally bang on their doors and you know accuse them of
[3:39:31.760 --> 3:39:38.800]  being hateful bigots. So the news the main news network in Sweden when they had three
[3:39:38.800 --> 3:39:44.720]  explosions in their capital city did not even mention it on that night's news program.
[3:39:45.600 --> 3:39:50.240]  Consider the statistics between January and June this year more than 100 explosions were
[3:39:50.240 --> 3:39:56.400]  reported in the country of prom 70 last year a total of more than 160 suspected attacks with
[3:39:56.400 --> 3:40:03.440]  explosives were reported last year and that went from basically no grenade attacks no explosive
[3:40:03.440 --> 3:40:10.560]  attacks to 160 a year the mainstream news is not talking about it and listen to this this is what
[3:40:10.560 --> 3:40:16.400]  Wilhelm Agrell professor of intelligence analysis at Lund University said he said that the situations
[3:40:16.400 --> 3:40:24.240]  become so dire that the integrity of the Swedish state is in jeopardy. Does that signify to you
[3:40:24.240 --> 3:40:29.760]  that diversity is a strength when the problem is so dire according to this Swedish professor
[3:40:29.760 --> 3:40:34.800]  by no means a right wing extremist saying it literally threatens the power monopoly of the
[3:40:34.800 --> 3:40:41.200]  state and talking about a mini civil war in some areas the postmen in Sweden can't even go out and
[3:40:41.200 --> 3:40:48.240]  deliver packages and parcels in these no go net no go area ghettos because they get attacked the fire
[3:40:48.240 --> 3:40:53.040]  service gets attacked they get stones they get bricks thrown at them if they try to put out fires
[3:40:53.040 --> 3:41:00.560]  because of course car fires are another offshoot aspect of this great cultural enrichment program
[3:41:01.760 --> 3:41:07.040]  so agrell said quote the state's monopoly on violence the actual token of a sovereign government
[3:41:07.040 --> 3:41:12.720]  has been hollowed out bit by bit and no longer exists the armed criminal violence is having
[3:41:12.720 --> 3:41:18.640]  effects that are increasingly similar to those of terrorism so you actually have a state of low
[3:41:18.640 --> 3:41:26.640]  level urban terrorism pre civil war type scenarios and again the statistic show and we had the one
[3:41:26.640 --> 3:41:31.440]  of the big police chiefs in sweden a couple of years ago come out and say his name was pizza
[3:41:31.440 --> 3:41:36.880]  spring air he went down the list of suspects in these violent attacks these explosive attacks
[3:41:36.880 --> 3:41:42.880]  these grenade attacks and he said virtually every name was an islamic name that is the source of the
[3:41:42.880 --> 3:41:50.560]  problem meanwhile in sweden swedish teen has ear cut off in brutal gang robbery an 18 year old
[3:41:50.560 --> 3:41:54.480]  young man had his ear partially or totally cut off by youth gang or said to have robbed him of
[3:41:54.480 --> 3:42:01.280]  everything except his underwear and in fact there was a local government that put out a commercial
[3:42:01.280 --> 3:42:08.080]  video advertising for people to come and live in its area to come visit its area comparing
[3:42:08.080 --> 3:42:14.480]  their relative tranquility to what's happening in some of these no go areas such as malmo and
[3:42:14.480 --> 3:42:20.240]  areas of stock home of course for merely putting out an ad that said let's make sweden look like
[3:42:20.240 --> 3:42:26.240]  sweden again they were dragged they were demonized as racist of course the government's response to
[3:42:26.240 --> 3:42:32.000]  all this despite the sweden democrats the populist party getting into into parliament
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:36.320]  18 percent of the national vote but the swedish government's response to the soaring violent
[3:42:36.320 --> 3:42:42.560]  crime to the soaring rape stats is to take the money from inheritance which is they've got nobody
[3:42:42.560 --> 3:42:47.920]  to pass on to because they've got no relatives who are alive and give it to fund drag wean
[3:42:47.920 --> 3:42:52.480]  story time that's the swedish government's response absolutely despicable will be right if
[3:42:52.480 --> 3:43:00.480]  war's life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet super silver whitening
[3:43:00.480 --> 3:43:07.120]  toothpaste this is proprietary this is with the top lab in the country and it is incredibly high
[3:43:07.120 --> 3:43:13.360]  quality this is the best toothpaste you're going to find it's called whitening toothpaste but really
[3:43:13.360 --> 3:43:19.360]  it knocks out the bacteria it recalcifies the teeth it does so many things on so many fronts
[3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:25.760]  these beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25
[3:43:25.760 --> 3:43:31.200]  percent off out of the gates it's as low as we can go and they're going to sell out very very quickly
[3:43:31.200 --> 3:43:36.720]  super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit i'm very very proud of it i want to
[3:43:36.720 --> 3:43:42.000]  thank my father a retired dentist for spearheading this the last two years and developing it it's

[3:43:47.360 --> 3:43:55.920]  get yours today at info wars life dot com a question was once posed to thomas jefferson
[3:43:56.640 --> 3:44:05.840]  what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to how far will they go what's their
[3:44:05.840 --> 3:44:14.560]  limit and he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit the answer is there is
[3:44:14.560 --> 3:44:22.960]  no limit to evil it is a bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil
[3:44:22.960 --> 3:44:29.600]  doesn't exist or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god but those very same people
[3:44:29.600 --> 3:44:36.800]  have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our
[3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:43.600]  houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us oxford's band
[3:44:43.600 --> 3:44:49.280]  clapping universities the u.s. of band 21 guns salutes for veterans these people are dangerous
[3:44:49.280 --> 3:44:57.360]  cult leaders and it's time to reject them beto roark came out dozens of times and said we're
[3:44:57.360 --> 3:45:02.560]  going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles and he got all the other democrats on the stage
[3:45:02.560 --> 3:45:08.720]  nine others to agree and said that he was a hero think about that now those democrats have taken
[3:45:08.720 --> 3:45:15.760]  all the guns in the cities they control their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles
[3:45:15.760 --> 3:45:21.760]  and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing
[3:45:22.400 --> 3:45:27.760]  and now the supreme courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion
[3:45:27.760 --> 3:45:32.560]  for what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country's
[3:45:32.560 --> 3:45:38.400]  under such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries
[3:45:38.400 --> 3:45:42.880]  for the second amendment and they're going to follow the original bill of rights and constitution
[3:45:42.880 --> 3:45:47.680]  and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these cities ignore
[3:45:47.680 --> 3:45:54.800]  illegal aliens well we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws i spend a lot of time
[3:45:55.680 --> 3:46:01.840]  reminding the info wars of family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the

[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:15.440]  broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters in the united kingdom it's paul
[3:47:15.440 --> 3:47:27.840]  joseph watson we had 100 000 150 000 polls marching on the streets again in revolt in resistance
[3:47:27.840 --> 3:47:35.200]  to the globalist agenda to the cultural imposition the both islam and the lgbt agenda has had on other
[3:47:35.200 --> 3:47:42.880]  european countries several more examples of that here again exemplifying why those polls were so
[3:47:42.880 --> 3:47:48.800]  energetic so engaged in marching against this kind of thing because in sweden we've also had massive
[3:47:48.800 --> 3:47:56.240]  problems with the islamic call to prayer being broadcast on loudspeakers in local areas and
[3:47:56.240 --> 3:48:03.040]  local residents protesting against that but the government um shoving it through headliner voice
[3:48:03.040 --> 3:48:09.200]  of europe netherlands mosques amplified call to prayer silence by a cut cable intensely amplified
[3:48:09.200 --> 3:48:14.640]  call to prayer amsterdam's blue mosque which was set to be heard for the first time last friday
[3:48:14.640 --> 3:48:19.680]  in the new west district of amsterdam was silenced by someone who cut the sound
[3:48:19.680 --> 3:48:24.960]  sound systems cable tomorrow they're just going to do it again the blue mosque was set to be the
[3:48:24.960 --> 3:48:30.160]  first mosque in the dutch capital where the call to prayer broadcast would be amplified over loud
[3:48:30.160 --> 3:48:35.520]  speakers dutch daily newspaper the telegraph reports of course the reason they're doing it
[3:48:35.520 --> 3:48:41.680]  is because they want to turn amsterdam into islamabad basically that's what it's all about
[3:48:41.680 --> 3:48:47.040]  occupying this territory if you can broadcast that out you know to where it reaches people
[3:48:47.920 --> 3:48:52.960]  half a mile down the road that then becomes your territory basically the controversial
[3:48:52.960 --> 3:48:56.880]  planners face plenty of resistance from amsterdam locals who believe the amplification of the
[3:48:56.880 --> 3:49:02.880]  call to prayer to ungodly levels is aggressive unnecessary obnoxious and runs counter to dutch
[3:49:02.880 --> 3:49:07.840]  values despite this they went ahead with it anyway because it had been approved by the
[3:49:07.840 --> 3:49:13.120]  government and somebody cut the cord but they're just going to do it again good vile does the
[3:49:13.120 --> 3:49:16.800]  leader of the national populist freedom party voices feelings about the mosque plan to amplify
[3:49:16.800 --> 3:49:22.800]  its call to prayer in a tweet writing screaming hate palaces must all close do it in saudi arabia
[3:49:22.800 --> 3:49:28.480]  but not here this is our country and islam does not belong in the netherlands but again it's the
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:36.000]  local politicians who by the way when you look at the stats none of them live even the leftists
[3:49:36.000 --> 3:49:41.840]  the greens none of them choose to live in the areas with the highest concentration of mosques
[3:49:42.400 --> 3:49:47.600]  or anywhere near the so-called no go zones isn't that interesting don't really tend to practice
[3:49:47.600 --> 3:49:53.200]  what they preach do they meanwhile in other culture and enrichment news in germany syrian and
[3:49:53.200 --> 3:49:59.440]  afghan asylum seekers attack village disco with machetes syrian and afghan asylum seekers attack
[3:49:59.440 --> 3:50:04.640]  to village disco in a small german village on with machetes after two were kicked out by a bouncer
[3:50:04.640 --> 3:50:09.120]  this is another one of their favorite things that seemed to like to do there was a case in
[3:50:09.120 --> 3:50:15.840]  frankfur when a group of asylum seekers did basically the same thing you know a couple of them what
[3:50:15.840 --> 3:50:20.640]  happens you know a couple of them will get in the club or in the disco they'll start harassing women
[3:50:20.640 --> 3:50:26.880]  they'll get kicked out by the bouncers and then half an hour later a gang of 20 or 30 of their
[3:50:26.880 --> 3:50:31.520]  friends just turn up and start attacking the building with clubs and machetes we've seen
[3:50:31.520 --> 3:50:38.640]  this in numerous european cities over the past three years this incident occurred on saturday
[3:50:38.640 --> 3:50:43.440]  in the village of trebin in brandenburg a group of around 10 migrants attempted to hack down the
[3:50:43.440 --> 3:50:48.080]  door to the building with their machetes the bouncer said the asylum seekers attempted to
[3:50:48.080 --> 3:50:52.880]  slash him in the neck but he was able to fend them off and get inside and then of course they
[3:50:52.880 --> 3:50:58.480]  brought their friends and the situation got worse as they're prone to do meanwhile france's target
[3:50:58.480 --> 3:51:04.160]  of more Islamic terror attacks than any other EU state and he studied shows that over half of the
[3:51:04.160 --> 3:51:10.960]  terror attacks in the EU occurred in france they also have massive problems with actual jihadists
[3:51:10.960 --> 3:51:17.760]  working in airport security what could possibly go wrong also in france it's coming up to the one
[3:51:17.760 --> 3:51:22.800]  year anniversary of the yellow vest demonstrations which of course is part of this theme of the
[3:51:22.800 --> 3:51:28.400]  rival against globalism naturally that's going to die down and it has over the past few months but
[3:51:28.400 --> 3:51:33.600]  it seems like it's going to be back in bigger numbers than we've seen in recent times headline
[3:51:33.600 --> 3:51:38.080]  out of voice of europe yellow vest planned demonstrations for the protest movement's first
[3:51:38.080 --> 3:51:43.760]  birthday of course the origins of that demonstration that massive protests that massive uprising
[3:51:43.760 --> 3:51:49.520]  was the globalist imposition on the rural communities in france when they hiked the gas
[3:51:49.520 --> 3:51:56.400]  taxes and other taxes related to livestock and farming that brought the farmers out onto the
[3:51:56.400 --> 3:52:02.800]  streets of paris then we saw a similar thing in holland with the pot farmer protest there because
[3:52:02.800 --> 3:52:08.720]  of course they're trying to slash their ability to produce livestock in half again to satisfy
[3:52:08.720 --> 3:52:14.880]  green new deal style climate taxes the massive revolt against globalism against carbon taxes
[3:52:14.880 --> 3:52:20.080]  is accelerating in virtually every european country and now the yellow vest organizers have
[3:52:20.080 --> 3:52:26.080]  called on the french public to gather next saturday on the sean's alize in paris the sean's alize of
[3:52:26.080 --> 3:52:32.560]  course the site where they banned protests entirely back in march to try and put a cap on this but on
[3:52:32.560 --> 3:52:37.440]  tuesday the co-founder of the yellow vest citizen sent a request to hold the new demonstration the
[3:52:37.440 --> 3:52:44.800]  one-year anniversary demonstration on the sean's alize and the authorities are likely to say no
[3:52:44.800 --> 3:52:49.840]  so again there's going to be another clash between the yellow vest and the police likely to happen
[3:52:49.840 --> 3:52:55.440]  this weekend will continue to monitor that but it seems like the yellow vests are back
[3:52:55.440 --> 3:53:01.520]  as a revolt against globalism across europe accelerates meanwhile we've had a lot of fake
[3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:08.320]  hate crimes fake racist attacks in the united states they're also not uncommon across europe
[3:53:08.320 --> 3:53:14.000]  when we had another one today in helsinki finland somali social democrat politician faked racist
[3:53:14.000 --> 3:53:21.280]  taxi story this was a social democrat party politician adhira heem hassein who admitted to
[3:53:21.280 --> 3:53:29.120]  making up a hate hoax about a racist passenger in his taxi because he was quote angry the somali
[3:53:29.120 --> 3:53:33.600]  an immigrant and left-wing politician retracted his fictitious account of expiring racist verbal
[3:53:33.600 --> 3:53:39.760]  abuse from a passenger in his taxi after the taxi company found that gps data from the cab tracker
[3:53:39.760 --> 3:53:46.320]  refuted his claims he apologized for lying of course he'll face no consequences whatsoever
[3:53:46.320 --> 3:53:50.880]  and it's likely that the raft of left-wing politicians and commentators who supported
[3:53:50.880 --> 3:53:58.800]  his initial claims will also face no consequences whatsoever meanwhile in hong kong where they're
[3:53:58.800 --> 3:54:04.560]  having their own backlash against authoritarianism headliner breitbart 15 year old boy hospitalized
[3:54:04.560 --> 3:54:10.800]  70 year old man killed in hong kong street battles the 15 year old boy in hong kong is in critical
[3:54:10.800 --> 3:54:15.760]  condition after undergoing emergency brain surgery on wednesday night after a blow to his head most
[3:54:15.760 --> 3:54:21.680]  likely the impact of a tear gas canister fired by the police and a 70 year old man died after
[3:54:21.680 --> 3:54:26.480]  spending the night in intensive care for a head injury from a brick thrown during a street battle
[3:54:26.480 --> 3:54:32.480]  while a man dressed in black clothing favored by protesters fell to his death under unclear
[3:54:32.480 --> 3:54:37.920]  circumstances now remember one of the primary reasons the hong kong demonstrators are out on
[3:54:37.920 --> 3:54:46.800]  the streets is because of their opposition to mass migration from china chinese people can move to
[3:54:46.800 --> 3:54:52.720]  hong kong they can immediately get welfare health benefits they can become citizens of hong kong
[3:54:52.720 --> 3:54:57.600]  basically immediately they introduce their own culture it clashes with the more westernized
[3:54:57.600 --> 3:55:04.320]  hong kong culture and that's why many of those protesters are still out on the streets and today
[3:55:04.320 --> 3:55:11.280]  we have yet another warning that the crackdown the military beijing tiananmen square style
[3:55:11.280 --> 3:55:19.200]  crackdown could be imminent because the president of china has remarked zero hedge reports president
[3:55:19.200 --> 3:55:25.200]  g won stopping the storm and restoring order in hong kong is china's top priority he said it was
[3:55:25.200 --> 3:55:30.640]  their most urgent task and basically a lot of people are asking the question which has been
[3:55:30.640 --> 3:55:37.840]  asked before is a crackdown imminent hong kong's already gone into recession i think that gdp was
[3:55:38.640 --> 3:55:45.200]  minus 3.2 tons of money is flooding out of hong kong into singapore it's no longer becoming
[3:55:45.200 --> 3:55:51.280]  a trustworthy place to invest of course the dichotomy is if china rolls in with tanks and
[3:55:51.280 --> 3:55:57.120]  enforces a brutal crackdown tiananmen square style hong kong will never probably recover
[3:55:57.120 --> 3:56:02.480]  from that and it will never be a major financial hub ever again so these are the high stakes we
[3:56:02.480 --> 3:56:09.120]  have right now they rotated troops into hong kong they called it a rotation and several months ago
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:14.240]  it wasn't a rotation it was actually beefing up the number of chinese troops within hong kong
[3:56:14.240 --> 3:56:20.880]  in preparation for this potential crackdown which again some people are now saying could be imminent
[3:56:22.560 --> 3:56:29.120]  meanwhile disney puts outdated cultural depictions trigger warning on old movies
[3:56:29.760 --> 3:56:36.400]  because we had the controversy last week over the john legend song he rewrote baby it's cold outside to
[3:56:36.400 --> 3:56:45.040]  retract the misogynistic nature of the lyrics what's funny about that is he changed all the
[3:56:45.040 --> 3:56:50.400]  lyrics to make it look as if you know in the song there's the relationship between the guy and the
[3:56:50.400 --> 3:56:54.800]  girl the girl saying oh i should really go home he's saying no you should stay it's cold outside
[3:56:54.800 --> 3:57:00.640]  that's of course rape culture now in 2019 but they had to change the lyrics of that to such an
[3:57:00.640 --> 3:57:07.120]  extent that they changed the entire meaning of the song so now it looks like the singer john legend
[3:57:07.120 --> 3:57:14.400]  in this case is trying to hide his affair from his wife who's just arrived home by basically telling
[3:57:14.400 --> 3:57:19.600]  her to leave that she has to leave immediately so they completely changed the entire premise of the
[3:57:19.600 --> 3:57:26.160]  song just to make it woke and it actually looks even less woke well now disney's new streaming
[3:57:26.160 --> 3:57:31.120]  service has included trigger warnings on old movies that caution the viewer about outdated
[3:57:31.120 --> 3:57:37.600]  cultural depictions again genuflecting at the altar of political correctness it's going to wrap
[3:57:37.600 --> 3:57:56.480]  it up the show warren with orange fries coming up next frankie news at summit dot news don't go away
