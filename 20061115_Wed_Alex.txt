[02:44.600 --> 02:48.600]  okay let's get serious now ladies and gentlemen
[02:48.600 --> 02:53.920]  uh... the democrats and bush are now openly saying no fence
[02:53.920 --> 02:56.000]  there was never a fence
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.240]  it was election smoke and mirrors if you read the bill it said
[02:59.240 --> 03:02.440]  it authorized a fence to be built if the money
[03:02.440 --> 03:05.840]  was ever appropriated we read the subsection of the bill
[03:05.840 --> 03:09.520]  but lying neocons on top radio use it as a way to neutralize
[03:09.520 --> 03:13.640]  conservatives as usual to lie to you
[03:13.640 --> 03:15.880]  and uh...
[03:15.880 --> 03:18.640]  will be discussing that in more detail a little bit later we don't have any
[03:18.640 --> 03:22.360]  guest today because i wanted to have time to take all your
[03:22.360 --> 03:23.800]  calls
[03:23.800 --> 03:25.200]  wanted to have time
[03:25.200 --> 03:27.480]  to speak with everyone
[03:27.480 --> 03:30.840]  well to be technical i was actually gonna have uh... i tried this morning to
[03:30.840 --> 03:33.520]  get uh... the resistance manifesto guy on
[03:33.520 --> 03:35.480]  john color
[03:35.480 --> 03:39.000]  and i was unable to we got him coming on i think tomorrow but i just last
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.720]  minute would have him on for a few minutes to get a video clip of him
[03:41.720 --> 03:44.600]  invading a giant uh...
[03:44.600 --> 03:48.120]  university classroom with like four hundred students
[03:48.120 --> 03:51.960]  you screaming about nine eleven being an inside job that's what everybody needs
[03:51.960 --> 03:52.960]  to do in fact
[03:52.960 --> 03:56.440]  the next few weeks i think i'll go down to ut and just pop into a class
[03:56.440 --> 03:59.320]  and uh... do the same thing we should all do it it's it's
[03:59.320 --> 04:02.920]  what it takes to get this country back but i'm i'm already digressing
[04:02.920 --> 04:06.560]  i'm off on a weird foot i've never started a radio show like i just started it
[04:06.560 --> 04:08.800]  but so what sale of the so-is-life
[04:08.800 --> 04:11.240]  as the uh... friendship saved
[04:11.240 --> 04:14.320]  uh... really serious broadcast today
[04:14.320 --> 04:16.920]  democrat control means hate bill
[04:16.920 --> 04:21.560]  will pass uh... you they will kill the fence that was never born
[04:21.560 --> 04:26.160]  uh... also uh... will get into basically the mind control propaganda in this
[04:26.160 --> 04:26.800]  country
[04:26.800 --> 04:30.400]  bush senior ways and on the eagles of the blogosphere
[04:30.400 --> 04:34.480]  and but bush junior shrub wants to regulate it
[04:34.480 --> 04:39.640]  i will get into the pc madness spreading across the world
[04:39.640 --> 04:44.480]  basically just wait when we get back i am really wound up there is a lot of
[04:44.480 --> 04:46.200]  really important news
[04:46.200 --> 04:48.400]  we will cover it all
[04:48.400 --> 04:52.760]  and it's all posted by the way person planet dot com info wars dot com
[04:52.760 --> 04:56.840]  the information war continues this is your wartime broadcast
[04:56.840 --> 05:03.120]  i'm alex jones
[05:03.120 --> 05:07.240]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[05:07.240 --> 05:09.720]  the information war continues
[05:09.720 --> 05:16.720]  it's alex jones and the gc n radio network
[05:16.720 --> 05:21.720]  uh...
[05:21.720 --> 05:25.160]  i'm gonna get right into the fact that bush and the democrats are announcing
[05:25.160 --> 05:26.680]  no border fence
[05:26.680 --> 05:31.160]  blisters of this broadcast knew that it was dead on arrival it was never funded
[05:31.160 --> 05:34.080]  it was textbook smoking mirrors
[05:34.080 --> 05:37.600]  of the democrats are swearing to pass a total
[05:37.600 --> 05:40.920]  uh... restriction on free speech with the hate crimes act
[05:40.920 --> 05:43.560]  similar to what they have in europe and i want to look at some of the stuff that's
[05:43.560 --> 05:45.000]  developed the last few days
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.480]  in europe and in england and in this country
[05:47.480 --> 05:49.280]  concerning speech
[05:49.280 --> 05:51.840]  and just how bad it's really gotten we've been
[05:51.840 --> 05:54.840]  kind of like a frog slowly boiling so i don't think we realize
[05:54.840 --> 05:56.160]  even myself
[05:56.160 --> 06:00.120]  uh... sometimes how bad it's gotten it's good to reset and reassess and
[06:00.120 --> 06:01.600]  really look around us
[06:01.600 --> 06:05.320]  and uh... a lot of times we can use that to really wake people up including
[06:05.320 --> 06:07.200]  ourselves we think we're awake but
[06:07.200 --> 06:09.280]  not as awake as we should be we kind of get
[06:09.280 --> 06:11.600]  punch drunker battle fatigue
[06:11.600 --> 06:13.880]  uh... in this fight
[06:13.880 --> 06:18.760]  and i was thinking this morning about the actual numbers of that iraqi's
[06:18.760 --> 06:22.320]  the british medical journal in an in-depth two-year study
[06:22.320 --> 06:25.440]  uh... and could and their conservative estimate is six hundred and fifty four
[06:25.440 --> 06:26.440]  thousand
[06:26.440 --> 06:29.720]  yeah that's more than six-tenths of a male
[06:29.720 --> 06:32.760]  uh... dead and i look at some of the old numbers this morning and it's actually
[06:32.760 --> 06:35.080]  two point one five
[06:35.080 --> 06:38.240]  uh... million dead i wanted to talk a little bit about that
[06:38.240 --> 06:40.280]  uh...
[06:40.280 --> 06:42.560]  uh... in the stack just goes on and on in fact
[06:42.560 --> 06:45.680]  i did have one guest i cancelled them and then we got another guest working on
[06:45.680 --> 06:46.480]  for tomorrow
[06:46.480 --> 06:48.480]  one of the guests in the next two days
[06:48.480 --> 06:51.440]  showing stay with us but but it's good we don't have a guest today because i
[06:51.440 --> 06:54.000]  want to go over news throughout the broadcast
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.280]  and take calls when i do have guests i tend to run out of time and not get to
[06:57.280 --> 07:01.440]  it all before i plunge into all this key information
[07:01.440 --> 07:03.520]  this is going to be important info by the way
[07:03.520 --> 07:07.680]  i'm asking you as listeners to email your entire email list
[07:07.680 --> 07:10.520]  and tell them about the radio show
[07:10.520 --> 07:12.120]  that's how we grow
[07:12.120 --> 07:15.400]  uh... whether you have an m or f of affiliate your area listed on short
[07:15.400 --> 07:16.840]  wave or satellite
[07:16.840 --> 07:19.600]  the internet's really the key we have the biggest internet listenership on
[07:19.600 --> 07:20.640]  shout cast
[07:20.640 --> 07:25.440]  just one of our screams not normally number one and we have a total of
[07:25.440 --> 07:29.080]  seven streams now but one of them is number one
[07:29.080 --> 07:32.360]  what i'm going to put them all together we dwarf all others
[07:32.360 --> 07:35.600]  uh... just hundreds of thousands per broadcast tune in
[07:35.600 --> 07:39.120]  just on the internet that's just one little small sampling there
[07:39.120 --> 07:41.920]  and i'm very proud of that but but what would happen
[07:41.920 --> 07:45.600]  you've all of you out there email your entire email list
[07:45.600 --> 07:47.280]  went on message boards
[07:47.280 --> 07:48.840]  i mean i'm risking my life here
[07:48.840 --> 07:52.360]  i'm walking point i'm ready to go down with the ship i'm ready to
[07:52.360 --> 07:56.360]  hit the bar bar i am having a bar bar i'm happy i'm honored
[07:56.360 --> 08:00.160]  uh... if i need to be the sacrificial uh... you know cat here
[08:00.160 --> 08:03.040]  uh... but uh... the point is
[08:03.040 --> 08:07.240]  i just want to reach people that to me is is the equivalent
[08:07.240 --> 08:11.280]  of all the treasure in the world unlocking minds defeating tyranny
[08:11.280 --> 08:15.000]  giving bullies uh... black eye breaking their noses
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.320]  uh... you know is the analogy
[08:17.320 --> 08:18.760]  in this info war
[08:18.760 --> 08:21.800]  that's what it's all about it's why i put terry storm out for free
[08:21.800 --> 08:24.880]  on google video uh... last time i looked over six million
[08:24.880 --> 08:27.240]  views of you add up all the different versions that are up there on google
[08:27.240 --> 08:28.240]  video together
[08:28.240 --> 08:30.960]  we have no idea how many on the share networks and the
[08:30.960 --> 08:33.000]  torrents and all the other ways that
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.560]  uh... videos are shared millions
[08:35.560 --> 08:38.360]  uh... copies we know from the thousands of you that have gotten them
[08:38.360 --> 08:41.480]  have gotten out of the people that's another effective way with the dvds in
[08:41.480 --> 08:43.400]  the vhs
[08:43.400 --> 08:46.720]  and so please continue with that activism
[08:46.720 --> 08:50.240]  uh... i talked in the last segment about uh... watching a video that's up
[08:50.240 --> 08:51.800]  on present planet dot com of
[08:51.800 --> 08:54.960]  john connor the resistance manifesto
[08:54.960 --> 08:57.400]  and we should all do what he does you know that that's what i've been doing
[08:57.400 --> 09:00.840]  for twelve years calling into talk radio shows being guessed on talk radio
[09:00.840 --> 09:02.000]  shows
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.640]  uh... going up and confronting prominent people
[09:04.640 --> 09:08.280]  but just walking into a major university which you can do
[09:08.280 --> 09:11.800]  and just walking into the
[09:11.800 --> 09:14.640]  uh... you know big auditorium for some of these classes there's five hundred
[09:14.640 --> 09:17.560]  people's like the one he's in scott about four hundred five hundred
[09:17.560 --> 09:21.280]  you start saying i love it's an inside job operation or towards google it
[09:21.280 --> 09:24.200]  and he handed out a thousand copies of loose change at the loose change boys
[09:24.200 --> 09:25.680]  gave him
[09:25.680 --> 09:28.560]  that's the kind of stuff we need to see
[09:28.560 --> 09:31.440]  that's the type of action we need to see
[09:31.440 --> 09:33.840]  and and and and again so
[09:33.840 --> 09:36.360]  the easy thing to do with the email your whole email list
[09:36.360 --> 09:39.400]  on a weekly basis they had to do the elections he was talking about this
[09:39.400 --> 09:41.000]  they learn about the north american union
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.720]  they learn about cancer viruses and sodium and stannous fluoride in your
[09:43.720 --> 09:44.400]  water
[09:44.400 --> 09:46.520]  hey learn about mercury in the vaccines
[09:46.520 --> 09:49.600]  hey learn about how they killed our trips with nerve gas our own government
[09:49.600 --> 09:50.600]  here is you know
[09:50.600 --> 09:54.280]  hey go to go to info wars dot com go to present planet dot com
[09:54.280 --> 09:58.480]  i mean we are having a huge effect we are growing exponentially the patriot
[09:58.480 --> 10:00.360]  movement the crew movement but it isn't
[10:00.360 --> 10:04.800]  fast enough so i'm asking you to be activist to go on message boards to go
[10:04.800 --> 10:06.280]  on my space accounts
[10:06.280 --> 10:08.840]  to get aggressive it's fun
[10:08.840 --> 10:11.680]  and just go plant the seeds like johnny apple seed
[10:11.680 --> 10:13.440]  fire and forget folks
[10:13.440 --> 10:15.640]  she can destroy the new world order
[10:15.640 --> 10:19.400]  literally you are info warriors i mean envision yourself
[10:19.400 --> 10:23.640]  you know going over the enemy wire going in at night and again this is an
[10:23.640 --> 10:28.600]  analogy the info war putting that c four explosive on their fuel tanks and i
[10:28.600 --> 10:31.960]  mean that's what happened when you fire out mass emails when you go on message
[10:31.960 --> 10:33.720]  boards exposed northwoods
[10:33.720 --> 10:37.600]  you expose nine eleven you give them a link to tear storm on google video
[10:37.600 --> 10:40.000]  you're literally the escaping over the line
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.280]  getting back to the woods
[10:42.280 --> 10:44.560]  ammo dumps exploding
[10:44.560 --> 10:49.800]  you know we're crushing the scum they're getting more and more scared
[10:49.800 --> 10:52.400]  fact that's why they're not killing a lot of the leaders of this movement
[10:52.400 --> 10:54.000]  because there's too many of us now
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.080]  and we're just spawning more and more
[10:56.080 --> 10:59.800]  it's a viral we're going into their cell structures and planning our dna of
[10:59.800 --> 11:00.640]  truth
[11:00.640 --> 11:04.520]  m taking over their cellular structures ordering them to mass produce the
[11:04.520 --> 11:08.960]  truth the cells burst and outpour millions more
[11:08.960 --> 11:13.280]  we are going to crush the new world order we're coming for the scum we're
[11:13.280 --> 11:15.360]  going to feed them with god's help
[11:15.360 --> 11:17.760]  well they'll set up their world government for a brief time but it will
[11:17.760 --> 11:19.480]  fall it will fail
[11:19.480 --> 11:24.400]  right as it's completed it will implode you can already see it happening
[11:24.400 --> 11:29.400]  and yes i'm a maniac i'm a maniac for freedom and i'm in a war i'm hyped up
[11:29.400 --> 11:33.720]  i'm fired up i've got my head screwed on straight
[11:33.720 --> 11:36.960]  so let's get our head screwed on straight today and then lastly
[11:36.960 --> 11:42.920]  you know call the arms call the troops in the info war here
[11:42.920 --> 11:45.960]  you need to understand that
[11:45.960 --> 11:48.000]  it is so important
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.800]  that terror storm but a number one on
[11:52.800 --> 11:57.040]  amazon dot com because that is the new york times bestseller list
[11:57.040 --> 12:00.600]  of videos in the industry
[12:00.600 --> 12:04.720]  now we've got to number nine number eight uh... what a week and a half ago it
[12:04.720 --> 12:06.960]  stayed in the top one hundred for over a week
[12:06.960 --> 12:08.960]  then when they sold out
[12:08.960 --> 12:11.960]  it plunged like two hundred fifty you know i saw the three hundred saw the
[12:11.960 --> 12:15.400]  two hundred i'm just saying two fifty
[12:15.400 --> 12:18.760]  well just a day after they were back in stock and they tell you when they're in
[12:18.760 --> 12:21.240]  stock
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.000]  just a day after they got back in stock and really in stock the whole time and
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.440]  i don't know why they lied and didn't do that we have the records but whatever
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.800]  uh... they were saying four to six weeks everybody quit buying
[12:33.800 --> 12:39.360]  and so we bottomed out at number eight and plunge back when they sold out
[12:39.360 --> 12:42.280]  again they never sold out that they were it was delivered to them we have the
[12:42.280 --> 12:43.400]  receipt of it
[12:43.400 --> 12:46.920]  uh... but they just took them a week to put it in the system that they had it
[12:46.920 --> 12:50.240]  which is unheard of by the way uh... we think it was done on purpose
[12:50.240 --> 12:53.680]  because it upsets people folks to have we were going to get number one
[12:53.680 --> 12:55.960]  i just want to get number one one time
[12:55.960 --> 12:59.680]  because that is to be able to say to all the big stores which they just ordered
[12:59.680 --> 13:00.760]  a few copies of peace
[13:00.760 --> 13:02.600]  to be able to say it's number one
[13:02.600 --> 13:04.440]  willing to say number eight or number nine
[13:04.440 --> 13:07.640]  we've got screenshots of it seventeen sixteen we weren't no
[13:07.640 --> 13:08.960]  up at one and uh...
[13:08.960 --> 13:11.960]  i guess the screenshots i was out of the farm and
[13:11.960 --> 13:15.400]  uh... frankly don't know how to do a screenshot of the pc i'm an idiot my
[13:15.400 --> 13:17.680]  people know how to do it on a mac
[13:17.680 --> 13:20.920]  and uh... it's more complex on the pc but but the point is
[13:20.920 --> 13:24.720]  we want to push it to number
[13:24.720 --> 13:26.440]  numero uno
[13:26.440 --> 13:28.680]  and and and then i'll shut up about it
[13:28.680 --> 13:32.240]  for some reason it was eleven dollars and nineteen cents amazon raise it to
[13:32.240 --> 13:34.280]  twelve dollars and nineteen cents but
[13:34.280 --> 13:35.760]  who cares
[13:35.760 --> 13:39.240]  and again this is not about money i put it up for free on the little video
[13:39.240 --> 13:41.440]  this is about setting a standard
[13:41.440 --> 13:44.040]  and being able to say number one
[13:44.040 --> 13:47.160]  number one on the new york times best seller left
[13:47.160 --> 13:48.340]  of video
[13:48.340 --> 13:51.960]  there's no debating it in the industry that is the standard
[13:51.960 --> 13:54.360]  it's already caused a huge way
[13:54.360 --> 13:57.320]  more stores ordered nationwide that went into the top ten
[13:57.320 --> 14:01.320]  let's send it to number one
[14:01.320 --> 14:03.400]  i'm asking you to send it
[14:03.400 --> 14:06.760]  to number one
[14:06.760 --> 14:09.560]  okay it's my first video to ever be distributed
[14:09.560 --> 14:12.560]  i turned out other distributors that i didn't like their terms and they want
[14:12.560 --> 14:13.840]  to be able to control it
[14:13.840 --> 14:16.400]  my new distributor to put out out foxed and
[14:16.400 --> 14:20.040]  you know the book based it's the movie seriana was based on a minute they're
[14:20.040 --> 14:21.320]  they're a big outfit
[14:21.320 --> 14:24.640]  uh... zero censorship total anti-new-world order
[14:24.640 --> 14:28.160]  uh... gary badly the owner sees against the new-world order
[14:28.160 --> 14:30.360]  i've had dinner with him knowing privately
[14:30.360 --> 14:34.880]  and uh... so we're both seething here in a war mentality attacking the enemy
[14:34.880 --> 14:38.360]  uh... it's like the folks at the green dragon and starting the seventeen seventy
[14:38.360 --> 14:39.040]  six

[14:44.000 --> 14:46.480]  the biggest assault on the new-world order this
[14:46.480 --> 14:47.960]  this this this
[14:47.960 --> 14:52.400]  slavering pit bull attack on the ankle of the globalist frankly we're hanging
[14:52.400 --> 14:54.080]  off their throat right now

[14:56.600 --> 14:59.680]  please all of us is a little pit bull that's attached ourselves
[14:59.680 --> 15:01.480]  some of you may even be a little vicious
[15:01.480 --> 15:03.280]  principle dogs doesn't matter
[15:03.280 --> 15:04.760]  we've heard
[15:04.760 --> 15:06.560]  we just need to attack them
[15:06.560 --> 15:09.920]  my ladies and gentlemen i like for a couple of them i just said that
[15:09.920 --> 15:12.920]  i want one of my wife's two dogs is enough but the point is
[15:12.920 --> 15:15.160]  we need to
[15:15.160 --> 15:19.360]  the two lawyers we need to attack now
[15:19.360 --> 15:22.260]  we need to go after them now
[15:22.260 --> 15:25.520]  and this is key so you want us to push it to number one like i do
[15:25.520 --> 15:27.980]  join me now you've already bought copies
[15:27.980 --> 15:29.760]  but i support them as gifts
[15:29.760 --> 15:34.440]  the twelve smackers i mean come on you can only get a mcdonald's meal for that
[15:34.440 --> 15:38.080]  you can't get mcdonald's for two people hardly on twelve bucks

[15:39.520 --> 15:45.400]  and give it to people make copies of it and know you're having a huge effect
[15:45.400 --> 15:49.160]  okay it's it uh... it went to number twenty and kind of settle back to twenty
[15:49.160 --> 15:52.840]  five let's drive it right now it's at number twenty something
[15:52.840 --> 15:56.280]  let's send it to number one right now
[15:56.280 --> 15:58.520]  everyone could merge now
[15:58.520 --> 16:00.680]  and send it to number one
[16:00.680 --> 16:03.200]  who know
[16:03.200 --> 16:06.120]  you can link through the subsection info wars dot com
[16:06.120 --> 16:07.840]  present planet dot com right now
[16:07.840 --> 16:12.360]  and once it's number one i will shut up
[16:12.360 --> 16:14.040]  i mean let me give you an example
[16:14.040 --> 16:17.600]  uh... it's great when you buy from info wars dot com because this office keeps
[16:17.600 --> 16:19.480]  all the profit on it will pay my employees
[16:19.480 --> 16:21.520]  i'm actually losing tons of money
[16:21.520 --> 16:24.800]  by telling you to go to them is on dot com because they sell it to amazon for
[16:24.800 --> 16:26.800]  like five dollars
[16:26.800 --> 16:29.880]  and then i am getting about fifty cents after everything
[16:29.880 --> 16:33.360]  so instead of making ten dollars off the dvd i'm saying go buy it here where i
[16:33.360 --> 16:37.200]  make fifty cents a seat i'm here saying i don't want to make money
[16:37.200 --> 16:39.400]  i'm here saying i want to go number one
[16:39.400 --> 16:42.440]  so everybody gets it out there
[16:42.440 --> 16:43.720]  so just get it
[16:43.720 --> 16:45.560]  please
[16:45.560 --> 16:47.840]  all right i'm gonna stop screaming
[16:47.840 --> 16:52.040]  i want that number one slot it's very important strategically in the info war
[16:52.040 --> 16:55.320]  so that's that's that's the request here from command base
[16:55.320 --> 16:58.600]  alpha delta tango norad
[16:58.600 --> 17:00.720]  all right we'll be right back
[17:00.720 --> 17:07.720]  i have no idea what that acronym just was but i heard on tv
[17:30.720 --> 17:37.720]  uh...
[17:51.280 --> 17:53.640]  welcome back
[17:53.640 --> 17:58.360]  i got a smile for body on me as long as you don't drop a bomb on my street
[17:58.360 --> 18:01.600]  i think that sums up my philosophy
[18:01.600 --> 18:05.040]  all right let me get serious and get into all the news here today it's it's
[18:05.040 --> 18:07.280]  actually pretty bleak and pretty dark
[18:07.280 --> 18:10.120]  but we knew what was going to happen
[18:10.120 --> 18:15.040]  and some had said i had even said uh... i'd ask the question
[18:15.040 --> 18:18.360]  you know keeping the republicans in things will just get worse so that'll
[18:18.360 --> 18:20.280]  wake people up
[18:20.280 --> 18:23.360]  but then i'd also said the democrats are bought and paid for by the same global
[18:23.360 --> 18:27.080]  interest so they'll probably just accelerate the program so
[18:27.080 --> 18:30.200]  you know is it better to just let them run wild and show everybody who they are
[18:30.200 --> 18:34.040]  or is it better to try to fail made them and walk them and stop them
[18:34.040 --> 18:37.640]  and i don't know i mean i just know that duties mine and consequence belongs to
[18:37.640 --> 18:39.080]  god
[18:39.080 --> 18:42.480]  but this is how it works yesterday the associate press comes out of the song
[18:42.480 --> 18:44.400]  drugs
[18:44.400 --> 18:48.080]  for some reason i printed it but it wasn't in my stack
[18:48.080 --> 18:52.880]  and it was you know that the democrats may kill border fence plan
[18:52.880 --> 18:55.600]  you probably heard it on the radio on radio too
[18:55.600 --> 18:59.240]  by this morning though the article had been changed
[18:59.240 --> 19:05.120]  to cherd often democrats agree to waive border fence alternatives she's the new
[19:05.120 --> 19:07.160]  uh... by partisanship
[19:07.160 --> 19:08.720]  and it says the house
[19:08.720 --> 19:11.600]  homeland security committee top democrats and homeland security secretary
[19:11.600 --> 19:12.760]  chartoff
[19:12.760 --> 19:14.480]  said today
[19:14.480 --> 19:16.880]  they will look at alternatives to building more
[19:16.880 --> 19:19.280]  fencing along the nation's borders
[19:19.280 --> 19:23.320]  putting them in odds with top republicans on the panel
[19:23.320 --> 19:24.480]  so
[19:24.480 --> 19:27.600]  you see them but those are outgoing republicans so they don't matter
[19:27.600 --> 19:32.720]  uh... republicans were traitors to we read the subsection of the bill
[19:32.720 --> 19:33.840]  on there
[19:33.840 --> 19:35.000]  and it said
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.880]  that homeland security will allow
[19:38.880 --> 19:43.040]  the building of a limited fence in a seven hundred mile area
[19:43.040 --> 19:46.560]  through texas and arizona
[19:46.560 --> 19:49.120]  if if if the congress later
[19:49.120 --> 19:50.560]  funds it that means
[19:50.560 --> 19:52.600]  nothing
[19:52.600 --> 19:55.640]  i mean they'll pay a billion bucks to build some bridge in the middle of
[19:55.640 --> 19:58.760]  nowhere where twenty people go across the day in alaska
[19:58.760 --> 19:59.960]  literally
[19:59.960 --> 20:02.080]  below no no
[20:02.080 --> 20:03.280]  no uh...
[20:03.280 --> 20:06.840]  you know no fence ladies and gentlemen
[20:06.840 --> 20:10.720]  no seven hundred mile fence uh... uh... but we can build one around afghanistan
[20:10.720 --> 20:15.080]  only only yes thousands of miles they can build one iraq oh yes hundreds of
[20:15.080 --> 20:19.760]  miles already built but you can have one
[20:19.760 --> 20:23.480]  and this big cardinal down in mexico another cardinal the vat again is
[20:23.480 --> 20:26.600]  running around saying it's inhuman to build a fence
[20:26.600 --> 20:29.480]  well hey italy how about we send in uh... thirty million people in your
[20:29.480 --> 20:30.400]  country
[20:30.400 --> 20:33.840]  and again a big parts of the catholic church who can are manipulating and
[20:33.840 --> 20:35.040]  controlling the giant
[20:35.040 --> 20:38.520]  catholic majority down there and they just want their constituents appear for
[20:38.520 --> 20:39.160]  the
[20:39.160 --> 20:41.480]  dying catholic church in this country
[20:41.480 --> 20:45.040]  i mean it's sick folks every establishment every major group
[20:45.040 --> 20:47.120]  once open borders
[20:47.120 --> 20:51.720]  open ninety percent american people don't but what we want doesn't matter
[20:51.720 --> 20:54.640]  what the constitution says about defending our border doesn't matter
[20:54.640 --> 20:56.720]  because we're not america anymore
[20:56.720 --> 20:58.120]  this country's dead
[20:58.120 --> 21:01.840]  now we can resuscitate it but only got a few more years
[21:01.840 --> 21:03.920]  which in the scale of times like a few minutes
[21:03.920 --> 21:05.280]  in the life of the country
[21:05.280 --> 21:07.040]  uh... to shock the chest
[21:07.040 --> 21:10.280]  with the defibrillators and we don't get folks i mean the country's dead right
[21:10.280 --> 21:11.400]  now
[21:11.400 --> 21:15.120]  we've been totally overtaken by foreign lobbyists from china and israel and
[21:15.120 --> 21:17.080]  england we're a whorehouse
[21:17.080 --> 21:18.600]  we're a joke okay
[21:18.600 --> 21:22.120]  and until we start getting honest about it is going to get better
[21:22.120 --> 21:23.520]  homeland security
[21:23.520 --> 21:26.200]  uh... you know the guy who supports israel have in the fence
[21:26.200 --> 21:29.360]  but he's a dual citizen so why should he care you know his his country can have
[21:29.360 --> 21:30.560]  offense but as our
[21:30.560 --> 21:33.840]  css leader we can't have one
[21:33.840 --> 21:37.100]  i mean it's sick the house of my security committees top democrats in
[21:37.100 --> 21:38.560]  homeland security
[21:38.560 --> 21:40.560]  secretary michael chair top said
[21:40.560 --> 21:43.840]  tuesday they will look at alternative to building more fencing along the
[21:43.840 --> 21:45.080]  nation's borders
[21:45.080 --> 21:47.840]  putting them at odds with top republicans on the panel
[21:47.840 --> 21:49.120]  they also agree that they will
[21:49.120 --> 21:51.040]  make a major push in the next congress
[21:51.040 --> 21:53.120]  legislation giving the department authority
[21:53.120 --> 21:56.200]  to distribute homeland security grants based on risk assessments
[21:56.200 --> 22:00.920]  federalizing local communities to make sure the border stays wide open
[22:00.920 --> 22:04.920]  but bush and perry and all of them lie about funding the border and all that they
[22:04.920 --> 22:07.880]  talked about a hundred million dollars for the border in texas
[22:07.880 --> 22:10.080]  they talked about it's all lies
[22:10.080 --> 22:12.240]  well they got what six cameras down there
[22:12.240 --> 22:15.600]  in the border patrol stations where the legals don't come across and they call
[22:15.600 --> 22:18.680]  that getting's getting tough
[22:18.680 --> 22:20.880]  so that's the kind of news i have on that front
[22:20.880 --> 22:24.760]  when we get back democrat control means a bill will pass
[22:24.760 --> 22:27.000]  i'm afraid for
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.440]  and then i want to go through the type of free speech
[22:29.440 --> 22:32.080]  restrictions that are going on here in england and europe
[22:32.080 --> 22:34.480]  right now
[22:34.480 --> 22:38.080]  by the way people kissing on a plane and a man putting his head down his
[22:38.080 --> 22:40.320]  girlfriend's lap
[22:40.320 --> 22:43.680]  on a long flight
[22:43.680 --> 22:47.800]  we're going to spend twenty years in prison peace
[22:47.800 --> 22:49.400]  it's freedom
[22:49.400 --> 22:54.560]  we'll talk about that too stay with us
[22:54.560 --> 22:58.520]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[22:58.520 --> 23:05.520]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[23:06.320 --> 23:08.320]  good evening
[23:08.320 --> 23:13.560]  we'd like to report on the state of our war against the american people
[23:13.560 --> 23:16.440]  we're mounting a sustained campaign
[23:16.440 --> 23:20.040]  to crack down on every american
[23:20.040 --> 23:22.440]  and every person of every faith
[23:22.440 --> 23:24.640]  every nation
[23:24.640 --> 23:28.440]  and to bring us justice
[23:28.440 --> 23:31.640]  all missions are being executed according to plan
[23:31.640 --> 23:35.120]  without warning of publication
[23:35.120 --> 23:39.400]  american's are being swept up in the international dry net
[23:39.400 --> 23:43.800]  thousands of FBI agents are on the trail of other citizens here in abroad
[23:43.800 --> 23:46.160]  it has everything to do with hate and evil
[23:46.160 --> 23:48.160]  and murder and pregnancy
[23:48.160 --> 23:49.600]  america's strong
[23:49.600 --> 23:50.680]  federal agents
[23:50.680 --> 24:17.160]  we are
[24:17.160 --> 24:39.160]  I see a message from the government like every day I watch it and listen and call them all suckers
[24:39.160 --> 24:44.160]  They wanted me about a summer or whatever picture me buying the scam I said never
[24:44.160 --> 24:49.160]  You ain't tuned to a hard tool so just spitin' I say committed give a s**t and I lose commission
[24:49.160 --> 24:52.160]  It's all a part of fighting devil's safe mind control
[24:52.160 --> 24:54.160]  And all about the battle for your body mind and soul
[24:54.160 --> 24:57.160]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind until they shape you
[24:57.160 --> 25:00.160]  Don't forget they made a slave gave a taze and raped her
[25:00.160 --> 25:05.160]  Another push season in another war for profit all in secret so the public never sick to stop it
[25:05.160 --> 25:10.160]  The Illuminati triple six all connected so the folks they control the race and take elections
[25:10.160 --> 25:16.160]  It's the stalling bones remaking till committed see the dragon gettin' in every city
[25:16.160 --> 25:18.160]  What would you do with it?
[25:18.160 --> 25:21.160]  Give it all up between the moon
[25:21.160 --> 25:23.160]  Would you stand up for truth?
[25:23.160 --> 25:26.160]  Or would you turn over truth?
[25:26.160 --> 25:28.160]  And then what if you saw?
[25:28.160 --> 25:31.160]  All I thought was you that's all
[25:31.160 --> 25:34.160]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[25:34.160 --> 25:36.160]  Or would you turn over truth?
[25:36.160 --> 25:40.160]  Now ask yourself who's the one with the most to gain?
[25:40.160 --> 25:41.160]  Hold on eleven more
[25:41.160 --> 25:42.160]  Couldn't stand his name
[25:42.160 --> 25:45.160]  Not even waving flags like they lost their mind
[25:45.160 --> 25:47.160]  Everybody got opinions but don't know the time
[25:47.160 --> 25:49.160]  Cause America's gettin' sick
[25:49.160 --> 25:50.160]  It's plain to see
[25:50.160 --> 25:52.160]  The oldest trick in the book is making enemies
[25:52.160 --> 25:55.160]  A phony evil soul of government can do it dirty
[25:55.160 --> 25:57.160]  And take over your freedom lock and load
[25:57.160 --> 25:58.160]  Keepin' search
[25:58.160 --> 26:00.160]  Ain't nothin' changed but more pellets people locked in prison
[26:00.160 --> 26:03.160]  These pins still beat us but it seems we forgetting
[26:03.160 --> 26:06.160]  But I remember before September how these devils do it
[26:06.160 --> 26:08.160]  Juliani asked Diallo how he's doin'
[26:08.160 --> 26:11.160]  We in the streets high like jail to the feet follow
[26:11.160 --> 26:13.160]  Waving flags bring these dragons to their knees
[26:13.160 --> 26:16.160]  Oil, blood, money make these chillers wild cold
[26:16.160 --> 26:19.160]  To split your suicide people dying never told
[26:19.160 --> 26:21.160]  It's all a part of playing God so you think we need them
[26:21.160 --> 26:24.160]  While being ass-crossed take away your rights to freedom
[26:24.160 --> 26:26.160]  Bear witness to the sickness of these dictators
[26:26.160 --> 26:29.160]  Hope you understand the time brother cause it's nature
[26:29.160 --> 26:34.160]  What does it do? It's what you do
[26:34.160 --> 26:36.160]  What does it stand for?
[26:36.160 --> 26:39.160]  What does it turn over?
[26:39.160 --> 26:42.160]  And then what if we're so strong?
[26:42.160 --> 26:45.160]  All that's left is that strong
[26:45.160 --> 26:47.160]  What does it stand for?
[26:47.160 --> 26:49.160]  What's strong?
[26:50.160 --> 26:52.160]  Now you askin' why my records always come the same
[26:52.160 --> 26:54.160]  Keep it real ain't no fellas
[26:54.160 --> 26:57.160]  Blingin' my eyes seen the glory of the coming of the beast
[26:57.160 --> 27:00.160]  So every story, every word I'm sayin' peace
[27:00.160 --> 27:03.160]  So you can witness the Illuminati body count
[27:03.160 --> 27:05.160]  Don't be surprised these are devils that I'm talkin' bout
[27:05.160 --> 27:07.160]  You think a couple thousand lies means
[27:07.160 --> 27:09.160]  The killers, nigga I'm spread of God
[27:09.160 --> 27:12.160]  We the one and ain't no villains or any other word
[27:12.160 --> 27:14.160]  They think the demon eyes are conscious
[27:14.160 --> 27:16.160]  Ain't no terror threaten less approval rate and slumpin'
[27:16.160 --> 27:18.160]  So I'ma say it for the record we the ones that planned it
[27:18.160 --> 27:21.160]  Ain't no other country took a part had they hand in
[27:21.160 --> 27:24.160]  Just go there to keep you scary so you think you need them
[27:24.160 --> 27:26.160]  Praise and push while that killer take away your freedom
[27:26.160 --> 27:29.160]  How many of us got discovered but ignore the symptoms?
[27:29.160 --> 27:31.160]  I'm talkin' loud but ain't nobody sayin'
[27:31.160 --> 27:34.160]  Now with the purple mimic on, eyes are on the first
[27:34.160 --> 27:37.160]  That's why I'm spittin' side-night each and every verse
[27:37.160 --> 27:39.160]  I see the Carlisle group and Harris tank accounts
[27:39.160 --> 27:42.160]  I see them pre-defeat each and every session now
[27:42.160 --> 27:44.160]  Now why a white stag burns, see the public buy it
[27:44.160 --> 27:47.160]  I see the profile and see the media's compliance
[27:47.160 --> 27:50.160]  Wards, cuts for business, see the vicious maker save it
[27:50.160 --> 27:52.160]  Hope you understand the time, brother, cuz it's made
[27:52.160 --> 27:55.160]  What would you do if you knew
[27:55.160 --> 27:57.160]  All the things we do
[27:57.160 --> 28:00.160]  What would you stand up for to know
[28:00.160 --> 28:03.160]  What would you turn away to
[28:03.160 --> 28:05.160]  And what if you saw
[28:05.160 --> 28:08.160]  All the things that's wrong
[28:08.160 --> 28:10.160]  All right
[28:10.160 --> 28:13.160]  Will you stand tall and strong?
[28:13.160 --> 28:15.160]  Well, I tell ya, that song's been out for about
[28:15.160 --> 28:17.160]  two and a half, three years, Paris, but
[28:17.160 --> 28:20.160]  that's our own little special mix, cutting out the
[28:20.160 --> 28:23.160]  non-Kings English, but absolutely true
[28:23.160 --> 28:25.160]  What you hear there
[28:25.160 --> 28:28.160]  So go ahead and serve the system, those of you out there
[28:28.160 --> 28:30.160]  listening that hate me and hate Paris and hate the truth
[28:30.160 --> 28:33.160]  Go ahead and serve your masters, go ahead and enjoy it
[28:33.160 --> 28:36.160]  Because they treat you even worse than they treat us
[28:36.160 --> 28:38.160]  They at least respect us and fear us
[28:38.160 --> 28:40.160]  You know, we're not afraid of them
[28:40.160 --> 28:42.160]  A lot of us aren't afraid to die, a lot of us aren't afraid
[28:42.160 --> 28:45.160]  to tell the truth, a lot of us just don't care anymore
[28:45.160 --> 28:48.160]  We're standing up against this dragon system
[28:48.160 --> 28:50.160]  And with God's help, we're gonna make this dragon fall
[28:50.160 --> 28:52.160]  The dragon does go down in the end
[28:52.160 --> 28:54.160]  All right, I know I said we'd have open phones today
[28:54.160 --> 28:58.160]  and we are gonna have them at 1-800-259-9231
[28:58.160 --> 29:02.160]  1-800-2599-231
[29:02.160 --> 29:04.160]  I want to get your take on the fact that they're
[29:04.160 --> 29:06.160]  telling you they're never gonna build a fence
[29:06.160 --> 29:09.160]  They never funded it to begin with, it was all lies
[29:09.160 --> 29:11.160]  And so we'll be getting into that
[29:11.160 --> 29:14.160]  Also, now they almost passed the
[29:14.160 --> 29:17.160]  free speech restricting hate crimes law
[29:17.160 --> 29:20.160]  the last eight sessions of Congress
[29:20.160 --> 29:24.160]  This time, it looks like they're gonna do it
[29:24.160 --> 29:27.160]  And it's just gonna get worse and worse
[29:27.160 --> 29:28.160]  So I want to go over what's happening here
[29:28.160 --> 29:30.160]  and around the world with the police tape
[29:30.160 --> 29:32.160]  just on that front of free speech
[29:32.160 --> 29:34.160]  and what people were saying
[29:34.160 --> 29:37.160]  And then there's just a bunch of other news
[29:37.160 --> 29:38.160]  There is so much to cover
[29:38.160 --> 29:40.160]  Israel and the US are saying they may go ahead
[29:40.160 --> 29:41.160]  and hit Iran
[29:41.160 --> 29:44.160]  They've been saying this for a year and a half
[29:44.160 --> 29:47.160]  But we still, they always say they're gonna hit somebody
[29:47.160 --> 29:49.160]  and then they say it, they say it, they say it
[29:49.160 --> 29:51.160]  and then they finally do it
[29:51.160 --> 29:53.160]  And then, of course, the Associated Press
[29:53.160 --> 29:54.160]  reported yesterday
[29:54.160 --> 29:56.160]  but it didn't get a lot of traction
[29:56.160 --> 30:00.160]  that they found plutonium in
[30:00.160 --> 30:03.160]  highly enriched plutonium in some junkyard
[30:03.160 --> 30:05.160]  It sounds like a total setup to me
[30:05.160 --> 30:10.160]  So we'll be going over that report as well
[30:10.160 --> 30:13.160]  Before I do that
[30:15.160 --> 30:17.160]  Let me just go over the
[30:17.160 --> 30:19.160]  hate crime legislation briefly
[30:19.160 --> 30:21.160]  to give you a smattering of what's going on
[30:21.160 --> 30:23.160]  In the next hour, I will spend about 15 minutes
[30:23.160 --> 30:25.160]  after we take some calls
[30:25.160 --> 30:27.160]  just getting into that
[30:27.160 --> 30:30.160]  Democrats' control means
[30:30.160 --> 30:32.160]  hate bill will pass Ted Pike
[30:32.160 --> 30:34.160]  This is up on prisonplanet.com
[30:34.160 --> 30:35.160]  Pastor Ted Pike
[30:35.160 --> 30:37.160]  For the past eight years, the Anti-Defamation League
[30:37.160 --> 30:40.160]  of the Nine Breath has tried unsuccessfully
[30:40.160 --> 30:42.160]  to pass a sort of well-infederal anti-hate bill
[30:42.160 --> 30:44.160]  It has failed largely from one reason
[30:44.160 --> 30:46.160]  Republican control of Congress
[30:46.160 --> 30:48.160]  Repeatedly, Republican opponents of the hate bills
[30:48.160 --> 30:50.160]  is Representative Roy Blunt
[30:50.160 --> 30:52.160]  and Senator Bill Frist have enabled
[30:52.160 --> 30:54.160]  the Republican congressional backing
[30:54.160 --> 30:56.160]  to block its passage
[30:56.160 --> 30:58.160]  With Democrats now in control
[30:58.160 --> 31:00.160]  such freedom-saving clout
[31:00.160 --> 31:03.160]  no longer exists
[31:03.160 --> 31:05.160]  ADL's Federal Thought Crimes Bill
[31:05.160 --> 31:07.160]  the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act
[31:07.160 --> 31:09.160]  which puts ADL basically in control
[31:09.160 --> 31:12.160]  of every local apartment, puts Israel in control
[31:12.160 --> 31:14.160]  I mean, I'm just stating the facts
[31:14.160 --> 31:17.160]  Okay, here, this is a sparring occupation
[31:17.160 --> 31:21.160]  We'll be reintroduced soon after January 1st
[31:21.160 --> 31:23.160]  since no Democrat in Congress
[31:23.160 --> 31:25.160]  has ever voted against the bill
[31:25.160 --> 31:26.160]  It will pass
[31:26.160 --> 31:28.160]  President Bush has said he will sign
[31:28.160 --> 31:30.160]  a modified hate bill
[31:30.160 --> 31:31.160]  If he does, free speech in America
[31:31.160 --> 31:33.160]  will quickly come to an end
[31:33.160 --> 31:35.160]  Well, I'm going to get Pike on
[31:35.160 --> 31:37.160]  Pastor Pike, but I disagree
[31:37.160 --> 31:42.160]  They passed the legislation
[31:42.160 --> 31:45.160]  what, five years ago
[31:45.160 --> 31:48.160]  The Campaign Reform Act
[31:48.160 --> 31:50.160]  which restricted free speech
[31:50.160 --> 31:51.160]  and told talk show hosts
[31:51.160 --> 31:52.160]  six weeks before an election
[31:52.160 --> 31:54.160]  I can't interview a gun rights group
[31:54.160 --> 31:56.160]  an environment group, it doesn't matter
[31:56.160 --> 31:58.160]  They told talk show hosts not to do it
[31:58.160 --> 32:01.160]  We all just said, you know what, take a hike
[32:01.160 --> 32:03.160]  They try to prosecute one or two of us
[32:03.160 --> 32:05.160]  just, you know, let us be political prisoners
[32:05.160 --> 32:07.160]  I'm ready to go to prison
[32:07.160 --> 32:09.160]  In fact, that's when we're going to start winning this thing
[32:09.160 --> 32:11.160]  That's why they haven't been put
[32:11.160 --> 32:13.160]  killing some of us, jail and others
[32:13.160 --> 32:15.160]  but those of us that are out in the spotlight
[32:15.160 --> 32:16.160]  right out on the field
[32:16.160 --> 32:18.160]  they're afraid to go up against our champions
[32:18.160 --> 32:20.160]  because even if they strike us down
[32:20.160 --> 32:23.160]  you know, if we put our champions out on the field
[32:23.160 --> 32:25.160]  and they send out ten of their gladiators
[32:25.160 --> 32:27.160]  and take down one of our champions
[32:27.160 --> 32:29.160]  just the gang attack
[32:29.160 --> 32:31.160]  will enrage our forces
[32:31.160 --> 32:33.160]  We win either way
[32:33.160 --> 32:35.160]  If our champions defeat the enemy we win
[32:35.160 --> 32:37.160]  and we rally
[32:37.160 --> 32:39.160]  he even rally
[32:39.160 --> 32:41.160]  or if they take us down we win
[32:41.160 --> 32:44.160]  We can't lose as long as we're committed to the fight
[32:44.160 --> 32:46.160]  That's the secret
[32:46.160 --> 32:48.160]  You'll just get on the field
[32:48.160 --> 32:50.160]  You cannot be defeated
[32:50.160 --> 32:51.160]  They're afraid of you
[32:51.160 --> 32:53.160]  So they tell you, oh, there's no hope
[32:53.160 --> 32:55.160]  You can't win, oh, you have no power
[32:55.160 --> 32:58.160]  because their knees are knocking
[32:58.160 --> 33:00.160]  their teeth are chattering
[33:00.160 --> 33:02.160]  and they should be afraid
[33:02.160 --> 33:05.160]  We need courage to virally spread
[33:05.160 --> 33:07.160]  We need manhood
[33:07.160 --> 33:09.160]  to spring in the heart of men again
[33:09.160 --> 33:11.160]  We need to stand tall
[33:16.160 --> 33:18.160]  It goes on
[33:18.160 --> 33:20.160]  Unless that is
[33:20.160 --> 33:23.160]  there arises an upheaval of protest from American people
[33:23.160 --> 33:25.160]  How can that happen? Answer alternative
[33:25.160 --> 33:27.160]  Right Wing Talk Radio has helped make it happen before
[33:27.160 --> 33:29.160]  It can do so again
[33:29.160 --> 33:31.160]  Well, I call it Libertarian Talk Radio
[33:31.160 --> 33:34.160]  Really, what you call Right Wing was pushing for these laws
[33:34.160 --> 33:36.160]  The Sean Hannity's of the world
[33:36.160 --> 33:38.160]  He said all militia should be arrested
[33:38.160 --> 33:40.160]  and every child should be given a chip
[33:40.160 --> 33:42.160]  I have one video, folks, you people are fruits
[33:42.160 --> 33:47.160]  Spreading the net of thought crimes laws
[33:47.160 --> 33:49.160]  Today in Canada and California
[33:49.160 --> 33:51.160]  to Europe and Australia
[33:51.160 --> 33:53.160]  ADL inspired, and they do, they go consulting
[33:53.160 --> 33:55.160]  about the laws, thought crime laws
[33:55.160 --> 33:57.160]  are stripping nations of free speech
[33:57.160 --> 33:59.160]  in Canada and many European countries
[33:59.160 --> 34:01.160]  It is a crime punishable by heavy fines
[34:01.160 --> 34:03.160]  and even imprisonment to make use of the internet
[34:03.160 --> 34:05.160]  to criticize federally protected groups
[34:05.160 --> 34:07.160]  such as homosexuals and Muslims
[34:07.160 --> 34:09.160]  Now, let's get something straight
[34:11.160 --> 34:13.160]  I don't hate Muslims
[34:13.160 --> 34:15.160]  and I don't hate homosexuals
[34:15.160 --> 34:18.160]  and I don't hate any other group
[34:18.160 --> 34:20.160]  but I will fight to the death
[34:20.160 --> 34:22.160]  for neocons
[34:22.160 --> 34:24.160]  but it will always be selectively enforced
[34:24.160 --> 34:26.160]  to say nuke, Iraq, kill all the Muslims
[34:26.160 --> 34:28.160]  That's all going to be allowed to happen
[34:29.160 --> 34:32.160]  In this country, in Europe it isn't, they arrest you
[34:32.160 --> 34:34.160]  You just say you don't like
[34:34.160 --> 34:36.160]  you know, Arabs, you're arrested, folks
[34:36.160 --> 34:38.160]  Like Paul in an article, Paul Watson
[34:38.160 --> 34:40.160]  in your state detailing dozens
[34:40.160 --> 34:42.160]  I think it was like 15 examples
[34:42.160 --> 34:44.160]  mainstream where somebody just says
[34:44.160 --> 34:46.160]  oh, I believe farmers deserve the same rights
[34:46.160 --> 34:48.160]  as gays, and they're arrested
[34:48.160 --> 34:50.160]  He said homosexual
[34:50.160 --> 34:52.160]  and they say that word is derogatory
[34:52.160 --> 34:54.160]  when it's the six-ing heterosexuals
[34:54.160 --> 34:56.160]  scientific term
[34:56.160 --> 34:58.160]  and make no mistake, you know
[34:58.160 --> 35:00.160]  remember what happened in Philadelphia
[35:00.160 --> 35:02.160]  the Christians being arrested for praying
[35:02.160 --> 35:04.160]  praying
[35:04.160 --> 35:06.160]  they were facing 47 years in prison
[35:06.160 --> 35:08.160]  this is here
[35:08.160 --> 35:10.160]  and the ADL was driving that whole deal
[35:10.160 --> 35:12.160]  it's a terrorist organization
[35:12.160 --> 35:14.160]  they've been sued and lost
[35:14.160 --> 35:16.160]  and they terrorized people
[35:16.160 --> 35:18.160]  it isn't a foreign intelligence arm
[35:18.160 --> 35:20.160]  and again, folks
[35:20.160 --> 35:22.160]  I was exposing Chinese infiltration
[35:22.160 --> 35:24.160]  in the 90s
[35:24.160 --> 35:26.160]  and I'm exposing Israeli infiltration now
[35:26.160 --> 35:28.160]  it's a real thing
[35:28.160 --> 35:30.160]  and it's scary, folks
[35:30.160 --> 35:32.160]  there's a lot of coffeeers running our cops
[35:32.160 --> 35:34.160]  they already run most of the departments
[35:34.160 --> 35:36.160]  give them the handbooks, the training
[35:36.160 --> 35:38.160]  they're the ones writing the stuff that
[35:38.160 --> 35:40.160]  land rights activists are terrorists
[35:40.160 --> 35:42.160]  homeschoolers are terrorists
[35:42.160 --> 35:44.160]  I mean, I have the actual manuals
[35:44.160 --> 35:46.160]  I mean, this is happening
[35:46.160 --> 35:48.160]  this is happening, folks
[35:48.160 --> 35:50.160]  and we're in trouble
[35:50.160 --> 35:52.160]  a top Canadian hate laws
[35:52.160 --> 35:54.160]  senior policy advisor recently described
[35:54.160 --> 35:56.160]  the power of his country's speech crime
[35:56.160 --> 35:58.160]  tribunal courts, the Canadian human rights tribunal
[35:58.160 --> 36:00.160]  is a quasi-judicial body
[36:00.160 --> 36:02.160]  it can force a web site to shut down
[36:02.160 --> 36:04.160]  or risk $10,000, $20,000 fine
[36:04.160 --> 36:06.160]  in extreme cases
[36:06.160 --> 36:08.160]  if one ignores the tribunal, one can be tried
[36:08.160 --> 36:10.160]  in a federal court
[36:10.160 --> 36:12.160]  of contempt, risking a nine month jail sentence
[36:12.160 --> 36:14.160]  for the first time, offence
[36:14.160 --> 36:16.160]  and that's a quote out of the
[36:16.160 --> 36:18.160]  Jewish Tribune
[36:18.160 --> 36:20.160]  English-Turkish cyber-hate expert
[36:20.160 --> 36:22.160]  Professor Yaman Akdenes
[36:22.160 --> 36:24.160]  speaking at the Nine Breath Conference
[36:24.160 --> 36:26.160]  on how to end
[36:26.160 --> 36:28.160]  dissent on the net rejoices that
[36:28.160 --> 36:30.160]  David Irving is behind bars
[36:30.160 --> 36:32.160]  he said continental European countries
[36:32.160 --> 36:34.160]  such as Denmark and Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland
[36:34.160 --> 36:36.160]  Hungary, Austria and Belgium
[36:36.160 --> 36:38.160]  have strong anti-hate laws
[36:38.160 --> 36:40.160]  and again, whether you think 6 million Jews
[36:40.160 --> 36:42.160]  died, 10 million, 100 million
[36:42.160 --> 36:44.160]  or 2 million
[36:44.160 --> 36:46.160]  it's your right to say it, well not anymore
[36:46.160 --> 36:48.160]  in this country have they passed this
[36:48.160 --> 36:50.160]  now let me show you what else is happening
[36:50.160 --> 36:52.160]  okay, I can spend all day on this
[36:52.160 --> 36:54.160]  and we're gonna do more this week
[36:54.160 --> 36:56.160]  and we'll do a whole hour on it
[36:56.160 --> 36:58.160]  but let me get into this now
[36:58.160 --> 37:00.160]  there's a long article Paul wrote
[37:00.160 --> 37:02.160]  he wrote two yesterday
[37:04.160 --> 37:06.160]  he wrote one about
[37:08.160 --> 37:10.160]  how in England
[37:10.160 --> 37:12.160]  a soccer coach said that
[37:12.160 --> 37:14.160]  there's horrible refs and they've got token women
[37:14.160 --> 37:16.160]  refs out here, they don't have the proper training
[37:16.160 --> 37:18.160]  and it's just horrible
[37:18.160 --> 37:20.160]  and so they're talking about resting and firing
[37:20.160 --> 37:22.160]  and right now, I mean I thought in England
[37:22.160 --> 37:24.160]  there's a place of modern free speech in Europe
[37:24.160 --> 37:26.160]  12-15 boys and girls
[37:26.160 --> 37:28.160]  Magna Carta
[37:28.160 --> 37:30.160]  that no, it's not there
[37:30.160 --> 37:32.160]  I mean every day I see articles in England
[37:32.160 --> 37:34.160]  where some columnist
[37:34.160 --> 37:36.160]  says they should quit recruiting
[37:36.160 --> 37:38.160]  in the schools
[37:38.160 --> 37:40.160]  which they do, there should be no sexual recruiting
[37:40.160 --> 37:42.160]  but homosexual recruiting in the schools
[37:42.160 --> 37:44.160]  something happens here and then people get arrested folks
[37:44.160 --> 37:46.160]  I mean they send
[37:46.160 --> 37:48.160]  they have police
[37:48.160 --> 37:50.160]  that sit in restaurants listening for a
[37:50.160 --> 37:52.160]  racial slur
[37:52.160 --> 37:54.160]  under your breath and they arrest you on the spot
[37:54.160 --> 37:56.160]  that's BBC
[37:56.160 --> 37:58.160]  a headline, hundreds arrested in hate speech
[37:58.160 --> 38:00.160]  sweep
[38:00.160 --> 38:02.160]  I mean they're not playing around folks
[38:02.160 --> 38:04.160]  and again that's the start for secret police
[38:04.160 --> 38:06.160]  for what you say
[38:06.160 --> 38:08.160]  now they're pushing in Europe to ban
[38:08.160 --> 38:10.160]  saying 9-11's an inside job
[38:10.160 --> 38:12.160]  claiming that it's hateful
[38:12.160 --> 38:14.160]  and claiming that the speech is all against Israel
[38:14.160 --> 38:16.160]  so it's anti-Jewish
[38:16.160 --> 38:18.160]  but then saying anything about 9-11 period
[38:18.160 --> 38:20.160]  I don't believe Israel ran the attacks
[38:20.160 --> 38:22.160]  I don't
[38:22.160 --> 38:24.160]  Military National Complex did
[38:24.160 --> 38:26.160]  Israel was involved
[38:26.160 --> 38:28.160]  boom folks you get off a plane in Europe
[38:28.160 --> 38:30.160]  boom you go to jail
[38:30.160 --> 38:32.160]  I mean this is freedom
[38:32.160 --> 38:34.160]  Bush Senior has said that the internet is run by terrorists
[38:34.160 --> 38:36.160]  that there's this hate speech that's got to be restricted
[38:36.160 --> 38:38.160]  well now Daddy Bush
[38:38.160 --> 38:40.160]  we got the clip we'll play it later
[38:40.160 --> 38:42.160]  try and be on Fox News saying it's the internet
[38:42.160 --> 38:44.160]  that's caused this evil climate of hate
[38:44.160 --> 38:48.160]  that's what we're talking about
[38:48.160 --> 38:50.160]  London Guardian reports
[38:50.160 --> 38:52.160]  press freedom being eaten away
[38:52.160 --> 38:54.160]  says watchdog chief reporters are getting restricted
[38:54.160 --> 38:56.160]  all over the western world
[38:56.160 --> 38:58.160]  here's another one
[38:58.160 --> 39:00.160]  the nurse-free-ride police
[39:00.160 --> 39:02.160]  parents to take lessons in reading and singing
[39:02.160 --> 39:04.160]  you see now in England and I've got
[39:04.160 --> 39:06.160]  it's like where did it go
[39:06.160 --> 39:08.160]  they brought it into me yesterday
[39:08.160 --> 39:10.160]  it was mailed to me from England
[39:10.160 --> 39:12.160]  it was in here in my stack
[39:12.160 --> 39:14.160]  any any social behavior
[39:14.160 --> 39:16.160]  any cussing
[39:16.160 --> 39:18.160]  any flatulence
[39:18.160 --> 39:20.160]  any spitting
[39:20.160 --> 39:22.160]  if somebody's rude to you give us their name
[39:22.160 --> 39:24.160]  or you get off the bus report them to us
[39:24.160 --> 39:26.160]  and we'll go ahead and bring them in for questioning
[39:26.160 --> 39:28.160]  see it's just getting everybody used to
[39:28.160 --> 39:30.160]  oh we just take you in
[39:30.160 --> 39:32.160]  we just take you in in fact where did that go
[39:32.160 --> 39:34.160]  I want to do an article on that
[39:34.160 --> 39:36.160]  that's a problem I just wallow in this stuff
[39:36.160 --> 39:38.160]  I had it here in the stack
[39:38.160 --> 39:40.160]  but see
[39:40.160 --> 39:42.160]  it's not just hate speech
[39:42.160 --> 39:44.160]  now it's
[39:44.160 --> 39:46.160]  parents could be forced to go to special classes
[39:46.160 --> 39:48.160]  to learn to sing to their children
[39:48.160 --> 39:50.160]  nursery rhymes the minister said
[39:50.160 --> 39:52.160]  those who fail to read stories or sing to their youngsters
[39:52.160 --> 39:54.160]  threaten their children's future
[39:54.160 --> 39:56.160]  and the state must put them right
[39:56.160 --> 39:58.160]  children's minister Beverly Hughes said
[39:58.160 --> 40:00.160]  the children's well-being is at risk unless we actually declare
[40:00.160 --> 40:02.160]  and so they're now going to start spying on parents
[40:02.160 --> 40:04.160]  and everyone in England will get CPS visits
[40:04.160 --> 40:06.160]  this is already starting here
[40:06.160 --> 40:08.160]  and then they will address
[40:08.160 --> 40:10.160]  the social worker
[40:10.160 --> 40:12.160]  statistically in England and in Australia
[40:12.160 --> 40:14.160]  and the US are all the same
[40:14.160 --> 40:16.160]  it's meant to break up families of their own documents
[40:16.160 --> 40:18.160]  but I mean think about how
[40:18.160 --> 40:20.160]  chilling this is
[40:20.160 --> 40:22.160]  oh we're going to come into your house
[40:22.160 --> 40:24.160]  and now under new freedom it says the same thing
[40:26.160 --> 40:28.160]  4 years age to 18 years of age
[40:28.160 --> 40:30.160]  you all get psychological evaluations
[40:30.160 --> 40:32.160]  now in Illinois they make all the pregnant women do it
[40:32.160 --> 40:34.160]  no matter if you're 45 years old
[40:34.160 --> 40:36.160]  or 20
[40:36.160 --> 40:38.160]  now if you put your kid in head start
[40:38.160 --> 40:40.160]  you get three CPS visits
[40:40.160 --> 40:42.160]  you don't know oh you're here to help me open the door
[40:42.160 --> 40:44.160]  boom dirty plate your kids are gone
[40:44.160 --> 40:46.160]  a week later they're being raped by CPS workers
[40:46.160 --> 40:48.160]  or having
[40:48.160 --> 40:50.160]  you know being given
[40:50.160 --> 40:52.160]  Ritalin Prozac
[40:52.160 --> 40:54.160]  we're being shipped off to a
[40:54.160 --> 40:56.160]  medical experimentation facility
[40:56.160 --> 40:58.160]  I'm not joking we're in hell on earth
[40:58.160 --> 41:00.160]  we're in hell right now
[41:00.160 --> 41:02.160]  we are just surrounded
[41:02.160 --> 41:04.160]  by scum
[41:04.160 --> 41:06.160]  we're going to drive back
[41:06.160 --> 41:08.160]  I haven't scratched the surface
[41:16.160 --> 41:18.160]  Mark, Ted, Eric
[41:18.160 --> 41:20.160]  many others that are patiently holding
[41:20.160 --> 41:22.160]  the phone system holds 25 calls
[41:22.160 --> 41:24.160]  we can only get to
[41:24.160 --> 41:26.160]  four of them on the board because the board's
[41:26.160 --> 41:28.160]  shorting out and our lured ship won't
[41:28.160 --> 41:30.160]  is trying to get a new one
[41:30.160 --> 41:32.160]  up there okay I'm being sarcastic
[41:32.160 --> 41:34.160]  I'm going to call to the next hour
[41:34.160 --> 41:36.160]  I'm going here
[41:36.160 --> 41:38.160]  I don't want to say I'm on fire but I'm mad
[41:38.160 --> 41:40.160]  by the way
[41:40.160 --> 41:42.160]  I counted it during the break
[41:42.160 --> 41:44.160]  I have 14 articles about
[41:44.160 --> 41:46.160]  thought crime and CPS
[41:46.160 --> 41:48.160]  grabbing children and total micromanagement
[41:48.160 --> 41:50.160]  there's no way to cover them all
[41:50.160 --> 41:52.160]  and I did find a little handout here
[41:52.160 --> 41:54.160]  total policing keeping public transport
[41:54.160 --> 41:56.160]  safe it says that they will be on all buses
[41:56.160 --> 41:58.160]  on the streets questioning everyone
[41:58.160 --> 42:00.160]  tells them to report things
[42:00.160 --> 42:02.160]  crimes, they'll take people into custody
[42:02.160 --> 42:04.160]  any social activity
[42:04.160 --> 42:06.160]  will not be tolerated
[42:08.160 --> 42:10.160]  again the social engineers turn our people
[42:10.160 --> 42:12.160]  into animals and then they turn those of us
[42:12.160 --> 42:14.160]  that aren't animals into prisoners
[42:14.160 --> 42:16.160]  I got to write an article about this
[42:16.160 --> 42:18.160]  I just can't, this is out of England
[42:18.160 --> 42:20.160]  look at this right here this is out of the
[42:22.160 --> 42:24.160]  London evening standard
[42:24.160 --> 42:26.160]  the nursery rhyme police parents to take lessons
[42:26.160 --> 42:28.160]  in reading and singing goes on
[42:28.160 --> 42:30.160]  that
[42:30.160 --> 42:32.160]  misused the head of the program said
[42:32.160 --> 42:34.160]  the state would train a new parenting workforce
[42:34.160 --> 42:36.160]  to get states now to do their duty
[42:38.160 --> 42:40.160]  the call for standards in the UN
[42:40.160 --> 42:42.160]  and families of labor efforts
[42:42.160 --> 42:44.160]  to improve educational standards by imposing
[42:44.160 --> 42:46.160]  rigorous controls on the lives of the youngest
[42:46.160 --> 42:48.160]  children
[42:48.160 --> 42:50.160]  the children at the age of
[42:50.160 --> 42:52.160]  five in England all children are putting
[42:52.160 --> 42:54.160]  a police database to start two years ago
[42:54.160 --> 42:56.160]  BBC
[42:56.160 --> 42:58.160]  they're assessed each month by police officers
[42:58.160 --> 43:00.160]  and
[43:00.160 --> 43:02.160]  talking back everything is noted
[43:02.160 --> 43:04.160]  and then they get them into the system
[43:04.160 --> 43:06.160]  poor little children
[43:06.160 --> 43:08.160]  and of course when they mess with them
[43:08.160 --> 43:10.160]  and get them in
[43:10.160 --> 43:12.160]  it's to turn everybody into criminals
[43:12.160 --> 43:14.160]  and harass them it's just poor children
[43:16.160 --> 43:18.160]  and all the same stuff starting here
[43:18.160 --> 43:20.160]  we're about three years behind England on that front

[44:02.160 --> 44:04.160]  aboard a Southwest Airlines flight from Los Angeles
[44:04.160 --> 44:06.160]  got them charged
[44:06.160 --> 44:08.160]  with violating the Patriot Act
[44:08.160 --> 44:10.160]  intended for terrorists
[44:10.160 --> 44:12.160]  no it's all misdemeanors

[44:14.160 --> 44:16.160]  Section 802
[44:16.160 --> 44:18.160]  and could land them in jail for 20 years
[44:18.160 --> 44:20.160]  and then I looked up the actual code
[44:20.160 --> 44:22.160]  all are fine
[44:22.160 --> 44:24.160]  according to their indictment

[44:32.160 --> 44:34.160]  you can't keep your hands off of them
[44:34.160 --> 44:36.160]  making other passengers uncomfortable
[44:36.160 --> 44:38.160]  when a flight attendant asked them to stop
[44:38.160 --> 44:40.160]  what were they doing? kissing
[44:40.160 --> 44:42.160]  then later one of them laid their head down
[44:42.160 --> 44:44.160]  the woman laid their head down on the lap
[44:44.160 --> 44:46.160]  my wife's done that on buses
[44:46.160 --> 44:48.160]  and they walked up
[44:48.160 --> 44:50.160]  and they were observed
[44:50.160 --> 44:52.160]  this was the indictment
[44:52.160 --> 44:54.160]  nuzzling and kissing on the neck
[44:54.160 --> 44:56.160]  and the face
[44:58.160 --> 45:00.160]  and the flight attendant walked up
[45:00.160 --> 45:02.160]  and got in their face
[45:02.160 --> 45:04.160]  and boy they're like little Nazis now a lot of

[45:06.160 --> 45:08.160]  looking for trouble
[45:08.160 --> 45:10.160]  walked over to them and they just said

[45:12.160 --> 45:14.160]  listen there's going to be serious consequences
[45:14.160 --> 45:16.160]  if you keep getting in my face
[45:16.160 --> 45:18.160]  that was taken as a terror threat
[45:18.160 --> 45:20.160]  and they're throwing the book at them
[45:20.160 --> 45:22.160]  and I've got another article here

[52:18.160 --> 52:20.160]  i've been a long time listener and i just
[52:20.160 --> 52:22.160]  wanted to quickly tell you what happened to me recently
[52:22.160 --> 52:24.160]  on monday
[52:24.160 --> 52:26.160]  i was actually dismissed from where i was working
[52:26.160 --> 52:28.160]  for trying to tell co-workers
[52:28.160 --> 52:30.160]  about 9-eleven and how it's an inside job
[52:32.160 --> 52:34.160]  where did you work
[52:34.160 --> 52:36.160]  actually i'm with aerotech
[52:36.160 --> 52:38.160]  which is a temporary placement
[52:38.160 --> 52:40.160]  or a job placement firm
[52:40.160 --> 52:42.160]  and the assignment
[52:42.160 --> 52:44.160]  that i was at or the company that i was at
[52:44.160 --> 52:46.160]  was called eges finance corporation
[52:46.160 --> 52:48.160]  and i'm a chemist
[52:48.160 --> 52:50.160]  so that's the kind of work that i do
[52:50.160 --> 52:52.160]  and i was there for about a month
[52:52.160 --> 52:54.160]  well last week on friday
[52:54.160 --> 52:56.160]  we went out me and some co-workers
[52:56.160 --> 52:58.160]  not allowed to talk at lunch
[52:58.160 --> 53:00.160]  you gotta have that chilling effect
[53:00.160 --> 53:02.160]  here in the new shelby union
[53:02.160 --> 53:04.160]  yeah exactly and so
[53:04.160 --> 53:06.160]  it was close to the midterm elections
[53:06.160 --> 53:08.160]  were all last week and everything
[53:08.160 --> 53:10.160]  was going on at the dinner table
[53:10.160 --> 53:12.160]  about
[53:12.160 --> 53:14.160]  democrats republicans
[53:14.160 --> 53:16.160]  and what had happened
[53:16.160 --> 53:18.160]  and different opinions and things
[53:18.160 --> 53:20.160]  you talked about your opinion about 9-eleven
[53:20.160 --> 53:22.160]  at a dinner
[53:22.160 --> 53:24.160]  you talked in america about what
[53:24.160 --> 53:26.160]  84% of americans don't believe the official story
[53:26.160 --> 53:28.160]  you're part of that 84% of evil
[53:28.160 --> 53:30.160]  exactly
[53:30.160 --> 53:32.160]  tell me what happened to thought criminal
[53:32.160 --> 53:34.160]  yeah i was trying to tell some people
[53:34.160 --> 53:36.160]  my opinion and what i thought about the democrats
[53:36.160 --> 53:38.160]  republicans and how they're controlled
[53:38.160 --> 53:40.160]  by the finance fears and how both sides
[53:40.160 --> 53:42.160]  are funded by the banks
[53:42.160 --> 53:44.160]  and this one co-worker kept telling me
[53:44.160 --> 53:46.160]  that i was crazy that i was just
[53:46.160 --> 53:48.160]  i didn't have anything to back about
[53:48.160 --> 53:50.160]  i'm sure they reported on you just like the 10 year old
[53:50.160 --> 53:52.160]  at the elementary school
[53:52.160 --> 53:54.160]  at steiner ranch
[53:54.160 --> 53:56.160]  and we got the after
[53:56.160 --> 53:58.160]  the report of his evil
[53:58.160 --> 54:00.160]  and it said suspension
[54:00.160 --> 54:02.160]  and psychological testing is now needed
[54:02.160 --> 54:04.160]  because during the lab
[54:04.160 --> 54:06.160]  he visited info wars dot com
[54:06.160 --> 54:08.160]  and which they say is a horrible
[54:08.160 --> 54:10.160]  side and they can't believe the filter
[54:10.160 --> 54:12.160]  didn't block it and in front of the class
[54:12.160 --> 54:14.160]  and they said it was terrorist and he was
[54:14.160 --> 54:16.160]  and he was shunned and had to go
[54:16.160 --> 54:18.160]  oh but see we're
[54:18.160 --> 54:20.160]  but it's freedom and
[54:20.160 --> 54:22.160]  we gotta arrest these people
[54:22.160 --> 54:24.160]  i mean you're bad so this co-worker
[54:24.160 --> 54:26.160]  i guess they went and denounced you the next day
[54:26.160 --> 54:28.160]  yeah what happened was
[54:28.160 --> 54:30.160]  i just got tired of the apathy
[54:30.160 --> 54:32.160]  i got tired of the arrogance
[54:32.160 --> 54:34.160]  around me and i finally
[54:34.160 --> 54:36.160]  in the restaurant
[54:36.160 --> 54:38.160]  in a loud voice i got the courage
[54:38.160 --> 54:40.160]  and i said listen
[54:40.160 --> 54:42.160]  9-11 is an inside job
[54:42.160 --> 54:44.160]  it was carried out by i'll see i aida
[54:44.160 --> 54:46.160]  look it up for yourself
[54:46.160 --> 54:48.160]  get informed know your bill
[54:48.160 --> 54:50.160]  of rights know your constitution
[54:50.160 --> 54:52.160]  because i'm telling you right now this republic
[54:52.160 --> 54:54.160]  is under attack
[54:54.160 --> 54:56.160]  and it is turning into a fascistic
[54:56.160 --> 54:58.160]  military police
[54:58.160 --> 55:00.160]  state these globalists
[55:00.160 --> 55:02.160]  want to turn this world
[55:02.160 --> 55:04.160]  into a hell on earth just like
[55:04.160 --> 55:06.160]  you were saying earlier and i mean
[55:06.160 --> 55:08.160]  i just got bold and i said it in the restaurant
[55:08.160 --> 55:10.160]  everybody was looking at me and everything
[55:10.160 --> 55:12.160]  got quiet and then
[55:12.160 --> 55:14.160]  yeah exactly monday i go
[55:14.160 --> 55:16.160]  to work and they're like well
[55:16.160 --> 55:18.160]  you know the director he called
[55:18.160 --> 55:20.160]  the temp agency
[55:20.160 --> 55:22.160]  and told them that i was no longer
[55:22.160 --> 55:24.160]  welcome to come back to work because some co-workers
[55:24.160 --> 55:26.160]  had come in and told him
[55:26.160 --> 55:28.160]  that my behavior was unprofessional
[55:28.160 --> 55:30.160]  and then i was no longer welcome
[55:32.160 --> 55:34.160]  i'd like you to write this up
[55:34.160 --> 55:36.160]  in an email and give us permission if it's okay
[55:36.160 --> 55:38.160]  to post it we don't have to use your full name
[55:38.160 --> 55:40.160]  if you just tell the story i'd like to post
[55:40.160 --> 55:42.160]  that at info wars dot com
[55:42.160 --> 55:44.160]  but privately i do need your full name and stuff to vet the story
[55:44.160 --> 55:46.160]  and give the place a call
[55:46.160 --> 55:48.160]  and you know have them say that mr
[55:48.160 --> 55:50.160]  uh... mark blah blah doesn't work here anymore
[55:50.160 --> 55:52.160]  and that he indeed was let go
[55:52.160 --> 55:54.160]  but we cannot tell you why
[55:54.160 --> 55:56.160]  but but i mean listen
[55:56.160 --> 55:58.160]  i've been arrested kelly rushing a prominent member of the community
[55:58.160 --> 56:00.160]  in lyon county kentucky
[56:00.160 --> 56:02.160]  uh... for just giving a police officer
[56:02.160 --> 56:04.160]  ron paul video
[56:04.160 --> 56:06.160]  i mean they think the speech is in the well
[56:06.160 --> 56:08.160]  of the house are illegal
[56:08.160 --> 56:10.160]  i mean this is what state police think that's illegal folks
[56:10.160 --> 56:12.160]  look i just want to tell the listeners
[56:12.160 --> 56:14.160]  i'll finish up with this
[56:14.160 --> 56:16.160]  these globalists
[56:16.160 --> 56:18.160]  they are luciferians
[56:18.160 --> 56:20.160]  they want to turn this planet into a hell
[56:20.160 --> 56:22.160]  because their motto is this
[56:22.160 --> 56:24.160]  and i truly am convinced and i believe this
[56:24.160 --> 56:26.160]  motto is it's better to serve
[56:26.160 --> 56:28.160]  or it's actually better to reign and rule
[56:28.160 --> 56:30.160]  it's better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven
[56:30.160 --> 56:32.160]  exactly so that's what they're doing
[56:32.160 --> 56:34.160]  they're turning this planet and i agree with you
[56:34.160 --> 56:36.160]  variant of that is it's better to burn out than fade away
[56:36.160 --> 56:38.160]  or go ahead
[56:38.160 --> 56:40.160]  yeah i agree with you alex like you said before
[56:40.160 --> 56:42.160]  that's exactly what they're turning this planet into
[56:42.160 --> 56:44.160]  is a hell on earth
[56:44.160 --> 56:46.160]  well that's why we call it prisonplanet.com
[56:46.160 --> 56:48.160]  we're not joking with that name
[56:48.160 --> 56:50.160]  prisonplanet.com
[56:50.160 --> 56:52.160]  i mean that's what we're facing here
[56:52.160 --> 56:54.160]  it's not a joke
[56:54.160 --> 56:56.160]  and see that's how this purple correctness enforces
[56:56.160 --> 56:58.160]  it's a chilling effect
[56:58.160 --> 57:00.160]  where they fire professors
[57:00.160 --> 57:02.160]  they arrest people
[57:02.160 --> 57:04.160]  they chastise children
[57:04.160 --> 57:06.160]  but we're the majority
[57:06.160 --> 57:08.160]  again it's that minority of cowardly scum
[57:08.160 --> 57:10.160]  defending this evil
[57:10.160 --> 57:12.160]  yeah if you ask a question
[57:12.160 --> 57:14.160]  you ask lord taney a question
[57:14.160 --> 57:16.160]  you get arrested
[57:16.160 --> 57:18.160]  you ask lord bush a question
[57:18.160 --> 57:20.160]  i thought that was being patriot
[57:20.160 --> 57:22.160]  places over and over again
[57:22.160 --> 57:24.160]  it is al-qaeda-ish
[57:24.160 --> 57:26.160]  to even question 9-11
[57:26.160 --> 57:28.160]  it's insane
[57:28.160 --> 57:30.160]  it's crazy
[57:30.160 --> 57:32.160]  let me just finish with this alex
[57:32.160 --> 57:34.160]  in the end
[57:34.160 --> 57:36.160]  when jesus was facing his accusers
[57:36.160 --> 57:38.160]  or they were persecuting him and taking him to trial
[57:38.160 --> 57:40.160]  and about to put him to death
[57:40.160 --> 57:42.160]  who was the one
[57:42.160 --> 57:44.160]  who were the ones in the end who were crying out
[57:44.160 --> 57:46.160]  to him to be killed
[57:46.160 --> 57:48.160]  it was the people it was the multitude
[57:48.160 --> 57:50.160]  dissuaded by the religious
[57:50.160 --> 57:52.160]  father all the
[57:52.160 --> 57:54.160]  you know
[57:54.160 --> 57:56.160]  first seas and Sadducees
[57:56.160 --> 57:58.160]  exactly the multitudes had been brainwashed
[57:58.160 --> 58:00.160]  they had been deceived
[58:00.160 --> 58:02.160]  and that's exactly what happened
[58:02.160 --> 58:04.160]  and today i see the same thing happening around me
[58:04.160 --> 58:06.160]  it's just ignorance
[58:06.160 --> 58:08.160]  there was only one person where i worked
[58:08.160 --> 58:10.160]  that could give me even two of their rights
[58:10.160 --> 58:12.160]  nobody else could even give me two
[58:12.160 --> 58:14.160]  i'm not saying you did wrong
[58:14.160 --> 58:16.160]  but i wouldn't jump up in front of the co-workers
[58:16.160 --> 58:18.160]  and say that when you're by yourself
[58:18.160 --> 58:20.160]  but you took a lot of courage and i commend you
[58:20.160 --> 58:22.160]  and say i'm saying you did a good job
[58:22.160 --> 58:24.160]  what i would do is i would have just brought them dvds
[58:24.160 --> 58:26.160]  i would have been nice and said okay
[58:26.160 --> 58:28.160]  i would make it a challenge just check this out
[58:28.160 --> 58:30.160]  i did do that too alex
[58:30.160 --> 58:32.160]  oh you did that too and then what they refused to watch them
[58:32.160 --> 58:34.160]  there was only one person there that would listen to me
[58:34.160 --> 58:36.160]  and he actually took terror storm
[58:36.160 --> 58:38.160]  i gave him a copy of terror storm
[58:38.160 --> 58:40.160]  good job
[58:40.160 --> 58:42.160]  yeah i'm determined now to give everybody
[58:42.160 --> 58:44.160]  i've got freedom to fascism
[58:44.160 --> 58:46.160]  all the dvds actually the ones that i've
[58:46.160 --> 58:48.160]  earned off the internet
[58:48.160 --> 58:50.160]  well i think you're going to be blessed
[58:50.160 --> 58:52.160]  we've got to go through the fire to make it to the other side
[58:52.160 --> 58:54.160]  alex i'm with you man
[58:54.160 --> 58:56.160]  i'm your brother here
[58:56.160 --> 58:58.160]  well listen i commend you mark
[58:58.160 --> 59:00.160]  send us an email say to kevin at info wars
[59:00.160 --> 59:02.160]  or erin at info wars to make sure we get it
[59:02.160 --> 59:04.160]  write down an account of what happens
[59:04.160 --> 59:06.160]  and give me your phone number we'll take that off
[59:06.160 --> 59:08.160]  but then we'll check on it the next few days
[59:08.160 --> 59:10.160]  and we'll post it okay
[59:10.160 --> 59:12.160]  kevin at info wars.com
[59:12.160 --> 59:14.160]  i read those email accounts too
[59:14.160 --> 59:16.160]  so that way we have multiple people reading it
[59:16.160 --> 59:18.160]  sometimes we miss it in between the spam and stuff
[59:18.160 --> 59:20.160]  let's go ahead and talk to ted
[59:20.160 --> 59:22.160]  and mark and saw ted thanks for holding your on the air
[59:22.160 --> 59:24.160]  yes alex how you doing
[59:24.160 --> 59:26.160]  good sir
[59:26.160 --> 59:28.160]  alex look i feel the same way mark does
[59:28.160 --> 59:30.160]  he just called i mean i kind of feel this
[59:30.160 --> 59:32.160]  pressure when i'm at work and i'm trying to wake people up
[59:32.160 --> 59:34.160]  and show them the truth
[59:34.160 --> 59:36.160]  and talk to them about these things that are going on around us
[59:36.160 --> 59:38.160]  that are very dangerous
[59:38.160 --> 59:40.160]  you're an american who thinks they can talk
[59:40.160 --> 59:42.160]  about things
[59:42.160 --> 59:44.160]  you're not supposed to do that in church
[59:44.160 --> 59:46.160]  anyway work nowhere you just submit
[59:46.160 --> 59:48.160]  and keep your mouth shut buddy
[59:48.160 --> 59:50.160]  well that's the kind of treatment i'm getting
[59:50.160 --> 59:52.160]  so it's kind of like i'm
[59:52.160 --> 59:54.160]  i'm not going to stop i'm not going to listen to them
[59:54.160 --> 59:56.160]  listen to pearls before swine
[59:56.160 --> 59:58.160]  you gotta know when to hold them know when to fold them
[59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.160]  if there are a bunch of work with hogs
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.160]  that don't appreciate how you're trying
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.160]  to warn them of something bad
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.160]  move on and wake up others in your community
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.160]  that's what i'm doing
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.160]  i did that last night running to a person
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.160]  who does believe in our cause
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.160]  and it was really refreshing
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.160]  out of the tens and 20 of people i've
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.160]  talked to about it
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.160]  we got a t-shirt
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.160]  or make your own i don't care
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.160]  that is $12.95
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.160]  we're selling them for $12
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.160]  you can get them for $9.95 when you buy two
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.160]  we're selling a t-shirt that says 9-11
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.160]  was an inside job on the front
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.160]  and it says 9-11 equals inside job on the back
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.160]  you wear that shirt brother
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.160]  it's got a lot of like minded people
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.160]  you don't have to be just oh i like that shirt
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.160]  that's a great idea i'll be sure to do that
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.160]  something very weird is happening
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.160]  a friend of mine came in and talked to me
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.160]  about what he had heard on the radio the other day
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.160]  the police had pulled over
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.160]  a guy in a car
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.160]  they called on star
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.160]  had them lock him in his car
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.160]  and then they went to arrest him
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.160]  well he was so angry
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.160]  cause he was locked in his car and couldn't get out
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.160]  by on star in the police department
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.160]  and he had to of course shoot him
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.160]  this was in the news
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.160]  yes sir on the radio
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.160]  when did this happen?
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.160]  this happened two days ago and i tried to call that day
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.160]  that it happened
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.160]  i will get with my friend and i will try to get more details
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.160]  i'm not sure if the radio will show you
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.160]  he was listening to but i can get some details on that
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.160]  well we ran a spoof
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.160]  that was done by michael corbin about three years ago
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.160]  where they do that
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.160]  cause on star we told you
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.160]  the FBI and others use it to randomly listen to your cars
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.160]  they track everywhere you go
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.160]  that's why they put it on standard so you can't escape it
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.160]  you gotta have it disabled
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.160]  you gotta have a technician go in and cut the wires to the unit
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.160]  you gotta have the tracker box removed
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.160]  and they are using it
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.160]  to lock people down in their cars
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.160]  see everything's having built in
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.160]  all the new computers have built in microphones
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.160]  and cameras
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.160]  and then they announce they're gonna use it
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.160]  to watch us and listen to us but they say it's no big deal
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.160]  and again
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.160]  again it's insane
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.160]  it's worse than 1984
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.160]  and it's all going in
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.160]  it's all lies and they're doing these things
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.160]  not to protect us but to harm us
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.160]  you're right about all the things you're talking about
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.160]  these people that call in and disagree with you
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.160]  without having any facts
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.160]  and just call the number and waste our time
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.160]  they're not really thinking right
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.160]  look in arkansas we've got
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.160]  youth lock up
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.160]  i'm looking at the paper right now
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.160]  november 4th cornell companies
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.160]  running alexander youth services
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.160]  63 shots
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.160]  a day of these stores
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.160]  and psychotropic drugs to calm them down
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.160]  we've also got an article here
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.160]  about the altered rice
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.160]  our food has been genetically altered
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.160]  and is contaminated
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.160]  and they admit that rice is causing
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.160]  major health problems and so what
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.160]  it's admitted in the paper just like you said
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.160]  and have been saying for a long time
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.160]  it's all right here in the paper
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.160]  i appreciate your call sir keep it up
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.160]  we'll be right back
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.160]  here's the t-rex of political talk
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.160]  alex jones on the gcm
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.160]  radio network
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.160]  you cannot
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.160]  articulate how bad it is
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.160]  how focused
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.160]  how crafted
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.160]  how it hits every little minutia
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.160]  of life
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.160]  and they even know how to teach
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.160]  the slaves to love it
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.160]  and to make them giggle and snicker
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.160]  like they're part of the system
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.160]  while they're ingesting all the poisons
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.160]  that have been designed to kill them
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.160]  just enjoy yourselves then
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.160]  let's go ahead and take a call

[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.160]  within the time allotted that we have
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.160]  possible sure go ahead
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.160]  way way back when uh
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.160]  there was a helicopter
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.160]  storming around this place
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.160]  and you know the governments around this place
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.160]  and all i could think to myself
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.160]  at the time mind you
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.160]  was why don't they just go in there
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.160]  and get this guy why don't they just go in
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.160]  and shoot their way in
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.160]  okay two years later
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.160]  oklahoma city bombing
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.160]  took place
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.160]  and i was standing in my room
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.160]  at my parent's house
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.160]  and i remember
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.160]  the formulation of the ogama
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.160]  federal building i had tears
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.160]  going down my face as i watched
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.160]  that building fall
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.160]  and some clicked inside of me
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.160]  some clicked and said
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.160]  why are they destroying all this evidence
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.160]  yeah veritas clicked
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.160]  let me go back to wake up briefly
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.160]  six days a week
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.160]  he took about a seven
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.160]  mile jog he was a pretty good jogger
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.160]  sometimes longer
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.160]  out and then down basically to the highway
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.160]  and back
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.160]  and they could have picked him up
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.160]  anytime but they didn't want to
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.160]  the batf has the videos in one of the films
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.160]  where they're talking about how they're going to get
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.160]  increased funding they were going to kill kooks
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.160]  they were going to have fun
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.160]  and they thought they could just shoot
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.160]  and mow them all down they got freaked out
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.160]  when they shot back and they put their hands up
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.160]  and then they didn't fire and then calard snuck off
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.160]  and later came back and burned it down
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.160]  but that's how they wanted to have
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.160]  that confrontation with the kooks go ahead
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.160]  yeah and mr. koresh
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.160]  himself he went into town
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.160]  on several occasions
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.160]  and the sheriff himself
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.160]  they had a auto parts in an auto repair place
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.160]  two miles outside the compound
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.160]  and he went down there they could have grabbed him
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.160]  at any time
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.160]  I've interviewed the now
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.160]  sheriff and everything
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.160]  the sheriff's deputies went out there to their shooting range
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.160]  every week
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.160]  koresh vernon howell real name
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.160]  was in there almost every
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.160]  day
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.160]  okay but that isn't what it's about
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.160]  these are want to be warriors these are all
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.160]  flunky lawyers and accountants at the
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.160]  batf who want more funding
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.160]  the government wants to have this confrontation so they
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.160]  authorize them to do it and they want to go
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.160]  not fight real enemies but kill people
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.160]  it's about that's why they pose with skulls
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.160]  of the dead bodies of the kids afterwards
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.160]  they think it's manly
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.160]  to kill women and children
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.160]  absolutely I just a week and a half ago
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.160]  I bought your movie terror storm
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.160]  from front to back
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.160]  about the terror storm off the market
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.160]  and then I saw you
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.160]  at the symposium in Los Angeles with Charlie Sheen
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.160]  with everybody up on stage
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.160]  I've known about the government
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.160]  doing all this kind of stuff
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.160]  way back since
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.160]  since the mid 90's
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.160]  and when I
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.160]  saw all them speaking
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.160]  my jaw hit the floor
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.160]  it's almost like reality
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.160]  kicked in I'm like oh my god this is all happening
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.160]  it is I appreciate your call

[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.160]  he predicts he's going to be the new
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.160]  prime minister of the Netherlands
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.160]  and this guy just used to work for a shelf
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.160]  it should be no surprise
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.160]  well of course you're going to have the queens man
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.160]  running her private country

[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.160]  yeah that's right

[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.160]  I mean that's the front
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.160]  you got the other parties like the Christian
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.160]  conservatives so called
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.160]  the guys that take the dives
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.160]  that's right exactly and that's happening
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.160]  exactly right now
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.160]  of course you don't want the American Union
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.160]  your people don't like anything that's happening
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.160]  but your government too just says
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.160]  we have men with black uniforms and machine guns
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.160]  shut up slaves
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.160]  right that's just going on
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.160]  you've got these so called liberals also
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.160]  I mean they're taking the position
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.160]  we've got to bring out
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.160]  global government
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.160]  that's their position
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.160]  it's just out in the open
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.160]  very strange here
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.160]  I've written a little article about Prince Bernard
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.160]  which I wanted to pitch to you
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.160]  I've called that
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.160]  I've shined it over to Kevin and Info Wars
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.160]  or Aaron and Info Wars
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.160]  I've attended a couple days ago or something
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.160]  oh you want us to post it
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.160]  well whatever you want
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.160]  I'd love to post it
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.160]  on one of your websites
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.160]  stay there I want to hear about the article
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.160]  and I don't know why it wasn't brought to my attention
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.160]  we just don't have enough people
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.160]  everything else you can imagine
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.160]  literally swimming in evidence
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.160]  this is an orgy of evidence
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.160]  the new order is letting it all hang out
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.160]  stay there I'm going to let you finish up on the other side
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:09:04.160]  we'll talk to Peter and many others
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:12.160]  music
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.160]  knowing it's half the battle
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.160]  taking action is the other half
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.160]  and we know who the murder ambassadors are
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.160]  with God's help we're going to move forward
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.160]  no amount of nitting
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.160]  fake Christians attacking this show
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.160]  or telling us to stand down
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.160]  is going to work we're going to take action
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.160]  we're going to do as God commands us
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.160]  and stand up against evil
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.160]  you're going to go to the police
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.160]  and all the police and all the rest of you
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.160]  hey if you're good people you go check out what we laid out here
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.160]  you find out it's true because I know it's true
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.160]  I wish it wasn't true
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.160]  and you decide who's side you're on
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.160]  don't you sit there and deny what I'm saying
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.160]  because if you're in that point of denying
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.160]  and it means you haven't looked it up
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.160]  and I don't mean go read some strongman
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.160]  attack on us one little piece
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.160]  its made up and said oh it's all not true
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.160]  everything we're talking about is happening
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.160]  and you're being used
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.160]  You mean absolutely nothing to the New World Order.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:07.160]  I found they abused their own people even more than the general public.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:11.160]  I don't know why, it's kind of like a culture of fear and control.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:18.160]  Take Paul who was Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.160]  He persecuted Christians, he arrested them, he tortured them, he executed them.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:29.160]  He was one of the big enforcers for the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Sanhedrin, the council.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:36.160]  And he saw a Christian being stoned to death and just there praying to God.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:41.160]  And it hit him and he said, who are these Christians? Who is this man Jesus?
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:48.160]  And he asked that question and God showed him and hit him with a white light, a bolt of lightning, knocked him off his horse.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.160]  And a lot of you have been knocked off your horse.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:11:01.160]  Former head of the CIA's Foreign Threat Assessment Division, Bill Christensen, said he couldn't believe it, he couldn't believe it.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.160]  He looked at the evidence and he was knocked off his horse.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:09.160]  Ray McGovern, CIA, Ronald Reagan and George Bush's chief analyst and briefer knocked off his horse.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:12.160]  The German defense minister knocked off his horse.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:17.160]  Michael Nietzsche, number three in Blair's cabinet knocked off his horse.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:23.160]  So many other prominent people, underwriting laboratories, chief engineer over a whole division, Kevin Ryan,
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:31.160]  looked at the evidence, looked at their own internal reports on tower one and two and seven, knocked off his horse.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:36.160]  Listen, I was knocked off my horse when I was about 18 years old.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:41.160]  I was, frankly, pretty evil, folks, very worldly.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:47.160]  I liked to fight, liked to womanize, liked to, I got knocked right off my horse.
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.160]  My family's like, you totally change.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:52.160]  All you do is read now and take walks in the woods.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.160]  And I said, I've been knocked off my horse.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:04.160]  And I pray, I pray that God will move the hearts of millions of enforcers on this planet and that you be knocked off your horse.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:07.160]  You know, a lot of you listening aren't going to check out the facts I bring forward.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.160]  If you believe in God, why don't you just ask God to show you the truth?
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.160]  And if you ask God to do it, if you say, who is this man Jesus?
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.160]  Who is this?
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.160]  You will be knocked off your horse.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.160]  That's God's will.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.160]  We face very serious times ahead.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.160]  Very serious times.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.160]  We're in very serious times.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.160]  I got a lot of news I need to go over.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.160]  We're going to get back.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:35.160]  I'm going to at least finish up with Uriam and the Netherlands, Rick, Peter and Dave.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.160]  And then everybody else needs to hold because I need to get into the thought crime legislation coming upon us.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:46.160]  The big picture there, what's really happened in Iraq, just a lot of key issues today.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:54.160]  The AP claims they found highly enriched, whatever that means, plutonium in Iran.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.160]  Not uranium, but plutonium.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.160]  I don't believe that, but we'll get into it.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.160]  But right now, the next four or five minutes, Debbie Morrow hadn't been on in a week or two.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.160]  Then William Concepts made to Merica, supports this broadcast.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.160]  Best Gravity Fed Filters out there.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:14.160]  You buy made to Merica for $100 cheaper on average than some Indian or Chinese knockoff.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.160]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.160]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.160]  Thanks for inviting me.
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.160]  Well, thank you for coming on.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.160]  Why don't you tell us about Big Berkey and why we need to get it?
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:33.160]  Well, Berkey water filters will really take the guesswork out of whether or not you're drinking good, clean, healthy water.
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:44.160]  So I just wanted to invite people to call in and request a catalog or go to our website at berkeywater.com,
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:49.160]  which is B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R.com.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:57.160]  And see for themselves why you should take control of what you're putting in your body so that you can keep as healthy as possible
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:07.160]  and not drink the chemicals and the bad things that are in the water that they're trying to tell people it's okay to drink.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:17.160]  A friend of mine calls it industrial poisoning that we get from everything that we put in our body these days,
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.160]  especially the water that's processed.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:27.160]  Well, I like to point out the fact that the chlorine and all the rest of the styrene, all the other stuff that's in there,
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:32.160]  it just kills all the bacteria too, so you're basically like getting slow food poisoning
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:37.160]  because you're literally drinking in a week out of tap water millions of dead bacteria.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.160]  That's right.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.160]  You're just drinking sludge.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.160]  Yeah.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:44.160]  So with a Berkey, you can take that out of the fact people ask me all the time,
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.160]  do I use the filters over and over again?
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.160]  And I say, yeah, but you have to clean them once in a while because they get real slimy.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.160]  Yeah, they do.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:58.160]  What's the new black element, even a new standard to non-detectable level cuts out everything?
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.160]  Is it 10,000 gallons?
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.160]  They'll do 3,000 gallons per filter.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:06.160]  So with a system, you get 6,000 gallons.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.160]  Oh, but that's a standard with two.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.160]  I've got one that's got three, so it's 9,000.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.160]  Right.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.160]  One with four, then it's 12,000.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.160]  Oh, OK.
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.160]  So, yeah, it just depends on which system you have.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.160]  And then basically every six months, so you do need to clean them because the scum does get on them.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:25.160]  Oh, yeah, they get real slimy even if you're just using tap water.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:29.160]  You just pull them out, put them under hot water and just get with a bristle pad, just kind of scrub them.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.160]  Uh-huh.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.160]  That's it.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.160]  Very outside-ish.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:38.160]  We are here and we're answering phones and we're calling people back if we do leave a number.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.160]  Yeah, I just want to point out to people that I don't sell magic machines that heal you.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:50.160]  I don't sell magical creams and I don't, you know, if I don't endure something and it means I either don't believe in it or I'm neutral.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:58.160]  I totally believe in these water filters and I totally know with the evidence that the water is full of every toxin you unknown demand.
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:02.160]  And it's just time to stop drinking it and take control of this one area of your life.
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:08.160]  And you get a big discount, you get to wholesale prices and it's made in America and they support what we're doing.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.160]  I don't know how people couldn't order this.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.160]  You already have one.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.160]  Buy one for your son or daughter, your neighbor.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.160]  I've bought over the years.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.160]  I quit counting.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.160]  I probably bought, what, five units last year, four or five the year before that, four or five.
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.160]  I just buy them all the time.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.160]  Yeah.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.160]  In fact, I think my parents just bought one another one to give us a gift.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:33.160]  Well, they're such great gifts and if you don't want to give out big burke, you know, give out burky sport bottles.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.160]  There's a story I never told.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:50.160]  My sister, who's 15 years younger than me, she and her senior trip, some or two ago, Time Flies, went to, I forget, it was like New Guinea or what's that place off the coast of Australia.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:17:01.160]  And everybody in her group of like 50 people from her school got sick, but her and her partner, because they partner together in these little tents and they stay with the natives and there's all these mosquitoes and the rest of it.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.160]  But sorry for interrupting, you know, I'm the king of that, Debbie.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.160]  I just want to, I never told this story.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.160]  I don't think I need to tell it.
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:19.160]  And I told him, I said, you better take these burky sports bottles because you can't trust the water there and they're telling me use filters there, but that never works right.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:23.160]  Other people brought these big fancy filters and stuff or cheap filters.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:33.160]  Well, these $225 sports bottles they took to do 600 plus refills of tap, 100 and what is it, 30 refills of swamp water, huge elements.
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:38.160]  It's like three times the size of an element you see at a sports filter bottle at the camping store.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:41.160]  Burky makes these themselves, Burky America.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.160]  And guess what?
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.160]  My sister and her friend did not get sick and I think they were there three weeks.
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.160]  That is so great.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.160]  I'm going to shut up now. Go ahead, Debbie. Sorry.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:55.160]  Oh, that's okay. I love hearing stories like that because it's true.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:04.160]  I mean, they really work and it's great to hear stories of people who have, you know, done exactly what she did.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:11.160]  She took it with her and then proofs in the pudding, you know, and I'm sorry to hear that everybody else got sick.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.160]  And, you know, so we just, you know,
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:19.160]  the diarrhea, vomiting, basically, monosumas revenge.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.160]  Yeah, that's what they call it.
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:24.160]  And, you know, by people calling in and placing Burky orders,
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:31.160]  they are helping support your shortwave airtime too and we really like doing that.
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:36.160]  That's right. WWCR, two frequencies, day and night, six hours a day, five days a week,
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.160]  our international outreach that we do have to pay for, I think it's like $10 grand a month.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:44.160]  So it's very expensive and you guys help us with that a lot.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:53.160]  Let me give the number out. It's 888-803-4438-888-803438,
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:59.160]  or burkywater.com. That's burkywater.com or infowars.com.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.160]  There's a big hyperlink to it. You can get it off our secure shopping cart.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.160]  We give them those orders each day.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.160]  Burkywater.com. They ship it out to UPS.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:10.160]  Burkywater.com. You get a free gift. This has got a bunch of different stuff.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:15.160]  Just give Debbie a call. 888-803-4438. Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.160]  Oh, Alex, thank you very much for having me.
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.160]  You bet. God bless you. Always good to hear from you.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:24.160]  Yeah, I think I mentioned that that my sister took some to a trip overseas and then get sick,
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.160]  but I never told the whole story.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.160]  Of course, I was the one going, you need to take these.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:33.160]  I saw a little handout. I was at my parents and saw the handout on the table saying,
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:38.160]  get ready to get sick. We'll provide water filtration, but get ready to get sick.
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.160]  Everyone does. It's okay. Well, they didn't.
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:44.160]  You've got to be careful, though, when you're in those outdoor showers.
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.160]  You can't even let that stuff get in your mouth.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.160]  I mean, I've been in Mexico and stuff on trips in college and people just, you know,
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.160]  let a little bit get in their mouth or take some ice cubes in their drink.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:59.160]  I mean, I do not like getting sick, so I don't know.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:04.160]  But now when I go out of country, which I did last year for a few days,
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:09.160]  down to Mexico, I take a Berkey Sports Filter.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.160]  I got those for normally 30-something bucks at a store.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:16.160]  You can get five for $100 or buy them. I think they're 30 bucks a piece from them.
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.160]  888-803438. Okay.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:26.160]  Let's go back to Uriam in the Netherlands, who said he wrote an article about the loving queen
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:29.160]  whose wealth is secret in the Netherlands. Finish up what you were telling us.
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:34.160]  Tell us about your article and then we'll move on. Go ahead.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:38.160]  Sure. Well, it's about Bernard, the mother of the queen,
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:45.160]  and his Nazi track record, actually, which is quite huge.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:50.160]  I mean, he worked at E.G. Farben, the company that supplied the Cyclone B stuff.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:53.160]  It was the SS Colonel. It's the equivalent of a burger to a general.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:21:02.160]  Yeah, that's right. He was with the writer SS, which is the cavalry version of these fascist people.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:07.160]  He also enjoyed marching with Hitler's three fighters, the SA, in his spare time.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:10.160]  And well, I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:15.160]  And he like switched it immediately when the war started in 1939.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:18.160]  As the German dictator increasingly guessed wrong in military affairs,
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:23.160]  he was evenly mistaken about the prince himself because Bernard was not an idiot.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:28.160]  I mean, he just switched sides when the Second World War broke out,
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:31.160]  and he just flipped sides in the blink of an eye.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:34.160]  He had changed from an outright Nazi to an Allied Air Force hero.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.160]  Now, the prince, the queen's son, it was going to be the king.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:42.160]  He was actually in Germany during World War II and had to be flown out to Franco fascist Spain.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.160]  I mean, that's how ingratiated the Nazis were.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:48.160]  And then, of course, their top agents, the Bushes, got most of the money,
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.160]  and that's why they're in power today.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:55.160]  The Nazi-Nashtag put Bush in, and they run the Democrats, too, and we're entering hell on Earth.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:58.160]  I talked to Kevin. He didn't get your email. Send it again.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.160]  All right.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:05.160]  We have spam filters. It might be your ISPs being blocked by us, but try to send it again.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.160]  Will you send it right now?
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.160]  I'll send it right now.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.160]  Thank you, sir. Good to have you on board with us.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.160]  Rick in Oklahoma, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.160]  Thanks.
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.160]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:22.160]  Yeah. I listen to you every day, man. I'm really in love with what you're doing, Alex.
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.160]  I want to thank you for that.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:28.160]  Well, it's a labor of love for the good folks and a labor of hatred for the new old order, but thank you.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.160]  Okay. Let me get some points real quick, because I know time is limited.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:39.160]  I don't know if you've seen this movie that's showing on Google, and it's called Monopoly Man, the Federal Reserve fraud.
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.160]  Yes.
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.160]  Have you seen that?
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.160]  Yeah, it's good.
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:46.160]  Yeah, I'd watched that this morning. I was impressed, and I learned quite a bit from that.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:51.160]  You can also watch America Freedom to Fascism on Google, and you can watch Terror Storm there, yeah?
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:56.160]  Yes. I've seen everything you've done. I've seen it, and now I have a collection.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.160]  Well, good.
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:07.160]  But hey, I want to hit a point real quick. I did some checking, and on JFK, Martin Luther King, and RFK, you know, John F. Kennedy's brother?
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.160]  Yeah.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:16.160]  Robert, I did some checking, and I found out that those guys, when they were assassinated, the connection was with the Federal Reserve.
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.160]  Did you know that?
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:23.160]  Yeah. Kennedy signed an executive order basically abolishing its power to coin the money.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:34.160]  He started issuing the first $5 billion, a $44 billion, and $5 bills, reissuing Lincoln greenbacks, and that's one of the reasons they capped him.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:39.160]  Yeah. I didn't know it went all the way back to Abraham Lincoln. I looked him up, too.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:47.160]  It sure does. When you go to a gun show or a coin collection shop, tell them I want a Lincoln greenback 1962, reissued by Kennedy.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:48.160]  1962?
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:54.160]  And they usually go for about $15. It's a red-stamped $5 bill that says United States note.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.160]  Okay.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:00.160]  It's still a fee-out currency, but it's issued with no debt. See, the government can just print money, and that's what they're supposed to.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:08.160]  Instead, the private banks did a deal where they print a dollar, a dollar of debt is created, and given to the private banks for the privilege of having money.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.160]  Exactly.
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.160]  It's a little fraud.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:17.160]  Exactly. Because I found out monopoly money, and it's the money that the Federal Reserve French model have, a blank piece of paper, because it equals the same thing.
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:24.160]  Well, it's even worse, though, because in the past it was a blank piece of paper backed up by the faith, and then previously with gold and silver.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.160]  Right.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:32.160]  That's the advantage. Now it's backed up by the national parks, the water, your children. Our birth certificates, it is confirmed.
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:36.160]  Our traffic has collateral of the global debt. I appreciate your call.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.160]  Okay.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.160]  It's very serious. Good to have you call in, Rick. I appreciate it.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.160]  Dave in California, you're on the year worldwide. Go ahead, Dave.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.160]  Good morning, Commander Jones.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.160]  How you doing?
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:53.160]  I'm Dave Short of the American Tyranny Destruction Nationalist Group. That's Alpha Tanga Delta, NORAD reporting.
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.160]  Thanks for calling in. What's on your mind?
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:04.160]  Well, I got a question and a short statement. I'm with the people for 9-11 Justice Forum, and we're putting together a new front on 9-11 Truth.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:11.160]  We're collecting the absolute best pieces of video evidence we can gather and making a DVD out of it, sort of a compressed one.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:17.160]  Then we're going to send it out to the most powerful state political law enforcement religious and bureaucratic leaders we can find.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:25.160]  We're going to send them out certified mail with return receipt. This force is their office to sign for them and give us a record that they received them.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:35.160]  The package will include a DVD, a brief cover letter, and an overview with bullet points on 9-11 Truth and the police state, followed up by phone conversations, and possibly other letters.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.160]  Good.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:41.160]  Okay. I encourage everyone to use return receipt on any further correspondence with any officials.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:49.160]  It forces them to sign, and it also protects the sender as a piece of admissible evidence relating to the document in case there's any further legal action.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:55.160]  Sort of like a poor man's subpoena, and it forces people to take action or to expose themselves as...
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:00.160]  Well, that's the key. A lot of police and detectives are actually good people. They're just totally ignorant, like the general public.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:07.160]  And I remember the time I was in the Travis County SWAT team, who's done a lot of bad things, by the way, but Lieutenant Beck was a good guy.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:12.160]  And I walk in there, they invited me up, because it was above the County Commissioner building. It was actually across the street.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:18.160]  But to make a long story short, there's all these Oklahoma City inside job videos and all these others on the shelf.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:24.160]  And I saw them way across. They weren't trying to, like, lead me past them. And then, yeah, that was pretty interesting.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:27.160]  Yeah. Well, anyway, so I got a question for you real quick.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.160]  Sure.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:32.160]  And a statement for the New World Order. So the Supreme... As Supreme Commander...
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.160]  Tell me to wait.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.160]  Okay.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.160]  Please knock it off, sir.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.160]  Okay. Well, anyway.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.160]  We got a big problem about the Supreme Commander.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.160]  It's cool, though.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:45.160]  Plus, it's like me dancing around in a general's, you know, cap and lapels out on the front line.
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.160]  Well, it's a joke about it.
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.160]  I understand, but they take that stuff serious.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.160]  All right.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:52.160]  We'll be right back. No, I'm just a private.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:59.160]  If you want to get down to it, I'm a special forces commander deep behind enemy lines, force multiplying for the overthrow of the New World Order.
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:10.160]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:26.160]  Please visit infoawards.com to get America freedom to fascism, exposed in the Federal Reserve, the IRS, the North American Union.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.160]  Great film, 1995.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:32.160]  You can get Terra Storm for $9.95 with it, if you wish, or get it by itself.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.160]  Terra Storm, normally $9.95, but I want you to get freedom to fascism so you can get that combo deal.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:41.160]  And, yeah, we're trying to drive Terra Storm right now to number one on Amazon.
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.160]  It's working.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.160]  It's in stock.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.160]  It's like $12 now.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.160]  They upped the price of dollar, but it's still a great deal.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:50.160]  And we're at, like, number 20 right now.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.160]  Let's drive it to number one.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.160]  It's got to happen now, not tomorrow.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.160]  Let's drive it to number one.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.160]  Please visit infoawards.com if you're online.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.160]  Link through and do that.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.160]  I'm going to cover tons of news in the next hour.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.160]  Continue with calls at first news when we start the next hour.
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.160]  A bunch of it, so stay with us.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:07.160]  But right now, let's go back to Dave in California.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.160]  Finish up your point.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.160]  Thanks for holding me over, Alex.
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:13.160]  So as Special Forces Commander of the Front to Liberate Occupied America,
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:20.160]  I'd like your two favorite pieces of 9-11 DVD evidence to use in our effort.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.160]  I would have to say building seven information with them blowing it up,
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.160]  and then other people admitting they blew it up.
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.160]  Now there's footage of police saying, get back.
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.160]  They're going to blow it up.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:36.160]  I would also get into the NORAD stand down and Norm Manetta testimony,
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.160]  talking about how Dick Cheney said the order still stood.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:42.160]  And then I'm thinking about it.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.160]  There's so many areas.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:48.160]  There's been a lot being CIA, the insider trading,
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:52.160]  the hijackers trained at U.S. military bases.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.160]  That's really some of the key stuff.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.160]  Thank you very much.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.160]  Can I make a brief statement for the New World Order?
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:00.160]  To the New World Order out there.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.160]  I don't care what you say.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.160]  I'm not afraid and I'm way too old to change.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.160]  I'm never going to stop.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:10.160]  I'm going to keep yelling until all you freaks are in prison.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.160]  I'm going to spend every dime.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.160]  I'll starve if I have to.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:15.160]  I do not care.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:18.160]  I'm not going to your stinking FEMA camps.
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.160]  I'm not going to vow.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.160]  I'm going to go down fighting.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:26.160]  In fact, I'm so glad to be alive and free at this time.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.160]  This crucial time in our history.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:31.160]  I'm so glad not to be one of your dumbed-down,
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:35.160]  propagandized, frightened, debt-ridden brainwashed trolls.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:39.160]  In fact, it's a total privilege to expend my life,
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:44.160]  my treasure, and my sacred honor to defeat you monsters.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:45.160]  I love it.
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.160]  I love it.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:47.160]  Thank you.
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.160]  You said it all there.
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:49.160]  Really, that's the maximum of this broadcast.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:54.160]  And listen, I am just the equivalent of one Special Forces
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:57.160]  Commander over to small group behind enemy lines,
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:00.160]  training the indigenous population to defend against the
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.160]  tyranny of men.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:05.160]  So I'm not anybody's commander, folks, joking around there.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.160]  But we are using those tactics.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:09.160]  The truth, micro printing presses,
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:12.160]  I see equivalent of the Internet, the DVDs.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.160]  We're educating the indigenous population.
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.160]  We're winning.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:19.160]  We're winning on every front, every major pole.
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:22.160]  Again, I heard top strategist on Beyond the Beltway,
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.160]  the TV show out of Chicago.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:27.160]  It's also on radio admitting that the new world order is the
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.160]  new issue.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.160]  It's never going away.
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:31.160]  The general public doesn't trust anybody in the government.
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:34.160]  The North American Union is the issue.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.160]  So go ahead and get rid of the borders, you bastards.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.160]  Excuse me.
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.160]  I don't need to be like that.
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.160]  Go ahead and get rid of the borders.
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:41.160]  Go ahead and ban our free speech.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.160]  It isn't going to work.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:47.160]  Just show everybody who you are you have failed.
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:50.160]  And I do pledge myself eternally to resist you.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.160]  And I ask God for all the guidance.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:54.160]  You know, I don't ask God for anything other than to leave
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:55.160]  God and direct me.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:59.160]  And that God's will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:01.160]  And I am honored to be alive right now.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:04.160]  I am so blessed and it's scary sometimes.
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:06.160]  You know, in the middle of the night, you wake up,
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:09.160]  you think about, my gosh, you know, I'm really in the thick of it.
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.160]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.160]  I wouldn't have it any other way.
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.160]  I wouldn't change anything.
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.160]  I am honored to be here.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:18.160]  And I'm honored that you're tuning in to listen to me.
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:22.160]  I just beg you to take action in this fight like you never had before.
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:23.160]  All right.
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:24.160]  I covered a lot of news in the first hour.
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:28.160]  I want to go back over, but get into more detail and cover a bunch of news I haven't covered.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.160]  It's going to be exhausting.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:33.160]  I kind of look at these stacks each day and I'm daunted, but when we get back,
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:36.160]  I'll recap some of the news and I'll get into what's happening in Iraq.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:53.160]  Then I'll get into the free speech annihilation here domestically and a lot more.
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:58.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.160]  You want answers?
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:01.160]  Well, so does he.
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:05.160]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:11.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:18.160]  We are now into hour number three in this global transmission against tyranny and dehumanization.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:24.160]  I'm Alex Jones, your wartime broadcaster in a battle for the republic against the enemy combatant
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:29.160]  puppets Bush, Pelosi, and their Rockefeller Rothschild, World Bank IMF,
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:35.160]  Saxe-Coburg, Gotha, Queen Beatrix, Allied Crime Syndicate owners.
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:37.160]  We will defeat the Allied Crime Syndicate.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.160]  We will.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:39.160]  We don't have a choice.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:44.160]  They are coming to build a worldwide control grid to then orderly have one child policies,
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:49.160]  force-drugging, force vaccination, and math eugenics culling.
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:52.160]  This is a worldwide alert, a worldwide mayday.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:33:00.160]  Humanity is under massive, scientifically crafted, focused bombardment using the basic psychology,
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.160]  sociology, and group dynamics.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:09.160]  They are waging war against every existing system that is the bedrock of human activity on the globe.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:16.160]  They are attempting to perfect a worldwide control slave prison grid, a prison planet.
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:22.160]  Worldwide mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday, and I mean it when I say that.
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.160]  Mayday, mayday, mayday.
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.160]  Humanity is being dehumanized.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:27.160]  We're under attack.
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:31.160]  Mayday, mayday, mayday.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:35.160]  Break your conditioning out there, and your gut, you know I'm telling you the truth,
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:39.160]  and your heart and soul, and your bones, and your marrow.
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:43.160]  In the heart of your marrow, you know the truth.
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:48.160]  Get out of the fear, join us in the final battle for the republic.
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:51.160]  Join us in the battle for humanity.
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.160]  Realize how serious things are.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:34:00.160]  Realize the incredible, bizarre tyranny taking place all around us.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:07.160]  I have a huge stack of news I mentioned earlier concerning out-of-control police state off of what people say.
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:11.160]  Mid-flight sexual play lands US couple of fouls of anti-terror law.
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:14.160]  They were kissing and cuddling, and were told to stop.
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:19.160]  And they're being charged with 20 years in prison under the Patriot Act and million-dollar fines.
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:22.160]  That's AP.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:27.160]  In Singapore, a 67-year-old Australian man was joking about what Australian doesn't joke around.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.160]  They're pretty nice folks.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:30.160]  And so there's no room in here for my bag.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.160]  Where do you guys put the bombs?
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:35.160]  He's being charged under international UN law.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.160]  We'll detail that.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.160]  Terror law.
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:43.160]  Press freedom being eaten away, says the London Guardian.
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:46.160]  PC Mad Britain savages Newell's thought crime.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:53.160]  Shocker manager Newell slammed, castigated for saying he's sick of the new women rafts that haven't been properly trained.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:56.160]  They're talking about his arrest and his firing now.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.160]  Yeah, that's the freedom.
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:59.160]  Don't criticize a woman. You go to jail.
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:05.160]  And again, even if you're against men saying women can't do this or can't do that, men can't have babies.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.160]  Men don't look super beautiful like you do.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.160]  Men aren't as smart as you in a lot of ways.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.160]  They're not as good as a lot of it, but I'm just telling you, we're different.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:21.160]  You can't carry an 80-pound pack, 50 miles, and you sure can't take on, you know, 10 guys in a trench with a dagger.
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:24.160]  And women can't take as many knife wounds as a man can and keep fighting them.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:27.160]  Your nervous system and your organs aren't built the same.
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:31.160]  But again, this has been turning us all against each other is what it's about.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:38.160]  Now, Daddy Bush is saying that you get infections, by the way, living in a foxhole for a month. I could continue.
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:47.160]  Now, Daddy Bush slams bloggers, blames internet for ugly climate, echoes vitriolic rhetoric of web haters.
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:50.160]  I need to ban that web immediately.
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:54.160]  Hate crime bill will become law, total emergency alert by Pastor Ted Pike.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:56.160]  Democrats' control means hate bill will pass.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:03.160]  We'll get into all of this and more. GPS surveillance creeps into daily life.
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:07.160]  Reuters official says U.S. main mole preempt to strike on Iran.
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:09.160]  Another article out on the Malaysian Sun.
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:14.160]  Israeli defense official says Israel may attack Iran within a month.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:20.160]  Ahmed Denizah's nuclear success celebration set for next month.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.160]  We'll cover it all.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:27.160]  Cardinal says they've got to get rid of our government and our border and get rid of it now.
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:32.160]  They're going to butcher the border fence that never was going to be built.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.160]  Don't tell me hiccups are coming up.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.160]  It's when I eat my lunch too fast and one minute breaks.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:43.160]  And when we get back, I'm getting into Iraq and one of the greatest crimes in modern history.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:49.160]  Stay with us. Fire up your soul. Wake up. Tune into reality.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:55.160]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:37:00.160]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.160]  Hold on. I'm going to get it all renewed and continue to take your phone calls.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:11.160]  I've been trying to get Dr. Paul Craig Robertson, former head of the policy department of Treasury,
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:16.160]  for about a week but he was moving from, I think it was Georgia to Florida.
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:19.160]  And he's at his new house and he said he could come on today but not the rest of the week.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:22.160]  So at the bottom of the hour, he will be joining us.
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:26.160]  I wanted to have him Thursday or Friday but we can't so we'll have him on to the spot of the election.
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:31.160]  Everything that happened here in about 23 minutes from now.
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:35.160]  Okay, 24 minutes and 14 seconds to be exact.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:38.160]  If we're able to get him, we're calling back right now.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.160]  I know we got a lot of calls here. We'll get to you too. Let me just briefly get into Iraq.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:47.160]  I was thinking about it this morning and it really hit me and I called Paul Watson and gave him the download
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:50.160]  and told him I think he ought to do a report on it.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:57.160]  He or Steve or somebody around here and that is, you know, the headline should be
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:05.160]  2.15 million Iraqis dead, 22 million to go.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:13.160]  Since 1990, okay, that is 16 years ago. It's right at 16 years.
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:19.160]  They have been under sanctions. They have been dehumanized. They've gone from first world to well below third world.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:24.160]  Lancet, the British Medical Journal, who was allowed access to Iraq as a part of the Coalition of the Willing,
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:31.160]  did a 2.5 year study and concluded that since the war began, the new one, the 3.5 year old war,
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:39.160]  it's 154,000, and then it was 200 and something. I forget the exact number.
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:44.160]  Iraqis have died from war related incidents.
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:51.160]  Okay, over 12,000 US troops have died from complications, but they say only 3,000, you know, died on the ground before they were flown out.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:54.160]  If you die in Ramstein, Germany, it doesn't count.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:39:00.160]  Okay, over 1,000 in Afghanistan. I mean, these are bad numbers.
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:06.160]  But think about the Iraqis. Over a million and a half, but we're being conservative with the admitted number of a million and a half
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:15.160]  from the late 1990 through 2003, March 23rd of 2003, over 1,500,000.
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:20.160]  Think of, visualize how many sports stadiums that is with 100,000 people in each one.
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:25.160]  I'm going to have a calculator in front of me. Maybe you can do it, Scott, or maybe I can just do the math right here.
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:27.160]  I can't really do it while I'm talking.
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:34.160]  Okay, I meant to do that earlier. How many 100,000s goes into 2.15 million?
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:44.160]  2,150,000. That is conservative guaranteed. The number is probably a few hundred thousand higher.
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:52.160]  But conservatively, 2.15 million.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:55.160]  How many sports stadiums is that?
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:40:01.160]  And this isn't at all Fentler 60 years ago. This isn't Joseph Stalin 55 years ago.
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:07.160]  This isn't Mao 45, 30 years ago. He did it during that period 45 and 30 years ago.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:13.160]  The biggest killing still goes on. It's ongoing. It was 55 million a decade ago. Now it's up to 60 million.
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:16.160]  I mean, let's talk about that.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:21.160]  Okay, I mean, this is massive concerted program.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:26.160]  And the Pentagon wrote about breaking it up, Balkanizing and driving it down a third world status. They're doing it.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:35.160]  I mean, do you really believe that hundreds of troops in official uniforms driving armored vehicles just pull up out of nowhere in downtown Baghdad,
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:43.160]  right by the green zone, and grab 150-plus people? Now the number is growing out of a university just magically.
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:55.160]  And no one stops them. It's just like US Anglo troops go in with over 50 Iraqi National Guard go into that mosque for an entire evening
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:00.160]  planning bombs and then blow the roof off, and none of our troops stop because it's an inside job.
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:04.160]  Clearly, we've had the former top CIA analyst here on to tell you that.
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:07.160]  Ray McGovern said, oh, clearly, that's an inside job.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:18.160]  I mean, this is bad. I mean, this is Pol Pot. Our government's just come here rouging. So when you hear that the new Iraqi military is insurgent.
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:23.160]  Well, because our government is the insurgent. See, that's how the new order wins, folks. They play both sides.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:30.160]  So the university is trying to stay open. Every university is closed indefinitely in Iraq now.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:32.160]  And it's going to continue.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:41.160]  So think about that. 2.1.5 million. 2 million, 150,000. Keep saying that number. And counting.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:51.160]  I mean, you've got a country, a country depending on the estimate, 1990, between 24 and a half and 25 mil.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:55.160]  And it's admittedly now 22 million and going down.
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:42:05.160]  I mean, they're bubbles doing a pretty darn good job. A place used to have rock and roll western music stations and women running around without wearing their headdresses.
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:12.160]  And most of the graduates were women. We talked about all this. That is swimming pools and everything, movie stars.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:20.160]  I mean, the whole deal, folks. Christians, Jews living in peace. Good because, again, Saddam had been put in by the U.S. back when there was a different policy.
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:28.160]  But he was popping too much oil and giving it to his people. And that is just not allowed. Serbia, it's not allowed either.
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:34.160]  And so now they have a quadrupling in birth defects. It wasn't tripling. Now, a quadrupling, that's official medical journals as well.
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:50.160]  A lot of trips come back and have the same thing. What DU does, it settles in tissues that, and a regular tissue, they'll just get cancer later. Some muscle tissue in your bicep. But things that are very hormonal and have a big exchange.
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:59.160]  That's why normally the glandular organs get cancer, not to mention the trips getting testicular and ovarian and liver cancer from it and lung cancer.
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:13.160]  So it's a hell on earth. And it's all by design and the mass extermination is going on in plain view in front of everyone. And there's your agenda. 2.15 million.
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:23.160]  And that isn't discussed enough. The Lansing Journal comes out with their doctors in the field and say, well, our conservative estimate is 654,000.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:32.160]  And they stressed and published their data and all these other scientists and statisticians looked and said, oh yeah, it's accurate. It's probably much worse.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:40.160]  Probably hundreds of thousands higher. Now, I want that to burn in and sink in real good.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:51.160]  There's a lot of soft good old boys out there listening who make the parking lot comment every day about just nuke them. You don't know these people. You don't know their history. You can't find them on a map. You're shameful.
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:59.160]  And do you think a government that'll do that to those men, women and children and those wonderful Iraqis are wonderful people? I know some of them.
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:04.160]  Wonderful smart people. Funny people.
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:12.160]  And I look at the photos and the video of those women and children and it makes my guts boil.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:17.160]  And again, empathy isn't something a wimp does on this bleeding heart that literally just got terrorism eyes.
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:27.160]  It's because empathy is recognizing something happening to someone you want to help them because subconsciously in your in grain program and you don't want it to happen to you and your people.
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:37.160]  And none of us are safe. I mean, if these globalists will kill 2.15 million right in front of everybody. Right in front of everybody.
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:40.160]  What will they do to us?
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:49.160]  And let me tell you that the new order has always hated America. They're getting rid of our borders, butchering, attacking the family. They've always wanted to pull pot America.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:57.160]  They've always wanted to come out of America. They've always wanted to Stalin and Hitler and Mao and Fidel America.
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:05.160]  And you know what? When they get their thing in place and they decide and they do their threat assessments and they decide that they want you to fight back.
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:11.160]  But they decide you can win and repulse first the first wave of our own military in the second wave of foreign occupation.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:19.160]  If they think they can win that, they're going to do it. Let me tell you something. You're going to see New Orleans type gun confiscation everywhere.
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:27.160]  You're going to see your children broken up from you and put on trucks and taken away from you. They're planning it. Northcom says it.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:36.160]  I remember seven years ago Marine Corps colonels saying on video, this is for America. Our video taped them breaking up the families.
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:44.160]  And I'd much rather wake those Marines up, but I tell you right now, folks, that if they, are you going to lay down and get on the trains,
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.160]  which they've got with the shackles and the boxcars that's admitted now, that urban legend turned out to be true.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:54.160]  Are you going to go with them in their vans and their flatback trucks?
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:01.160]  I'm asking you right now. I'm asking you right now, are you going to let them do that to this country?
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:05.160]  Are you going to let them do to us what they've done to the Iraqis?
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:10.160]  Now, they're sophisticated. We tried to say no to the Iraq war. We told the world we're against it.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:15.160]  That's the only good thing that came out of this. All the bad now comes. The free speech restrictions, the hate crimes legislation,
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:23.160]  the open borders, the North American Union. Bush couldn't get out of the Republican Congress.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:32.160]  She's so sad. It's so sad to see this happen.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:39.160]  And I'm not going to be part of it. I'm not going to go along with it. That's why I'm here.
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:43.160]  That's why I was here at one o'clock in the morning last night.
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:48.160]  And this while I'll be here at one o'clock in the morning tonight.
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:47:03.160]  Because everything in my body, every cell in my body, believe me, I'd rather be making love and eating good food and hunting and fishing.
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:07.160]  But I don't even really do that, folks.
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:13.160]  I literally am totally committed to this fight.
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:19.160]  And when I do take all the few days, I feel racked with guilt because I realize, man, it's on.
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:22.160]  I'd like to live a normal life.
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:28.160]  I'd like to not have fear of a SWAT team kicking down my door and dragging me out of my house with some trumped-up charge.
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:33.160]  I'd like to not have those concerns, but I'd like to not have to worry about my family.
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:42.160]  But I have to go through that fear and use that fear and transmute that fear into courage and honor and stand tall.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:50.160]  And stand up for those Iraqi children because if we don't stand up for those little babes, it's better for us to tie a millstone around our neck.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:55.160]  To tie a boulder around our throats and tie it around our neck and throw it in the deepest sea.
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:59.160]  I will not be part of the dying court kidnapping rings.
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:02.160]  And you are part of it when you don't speak out against it.
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:06.160]  I will not be part of CPS Coast to Coast taking children from medical experiments.
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:09.160]  I will not be part of any of it.
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:12.160]  And there's not even a choice.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:15.160]  There's not even a discussion of this.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:18.160]  There shouldn't even be a debate going on in your mind.
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:24.160]  You should commit wholesale right now.
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:30.160]  You should be running to the guns in the Influ war before it goes hot.
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:39.160]  You should turn up the heat on this cold war of information and wield the sword of truth and cleave the enemies' heads from their bodies.
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:42.160]  Move forward, never stop, know we're winning.
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.160]  Don't listen to enemy transmissions saying we're losing.
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.160]  That's their desperation.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:50.160]  Move forward, rise, sleeping giant.
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:49:08.160]  Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:12.160]  Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:15.160]  Welcome back.
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:19.160]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:22.160]  Let's blitz through your calls as quickly as possible.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:26.160]  They're saying they're going to euthanize any disabled babies and now even premature babies.
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:27.160]  Just kill them.
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:28.160]  Not let them die.
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:30.160]  Kill them in England.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:36.160]  Again, you don't care about a million, two million, 2.1 million, 2.15 million dead Iraqis.
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:38.160]  They'll just kill you.
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:42.160]  You see, if you think their life's worthless, your life's worthless too, Baba.
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:44.160]  You didn't know that's how the world works.
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:45.160]  What comes around goes around.
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:47.160]  You reap what you sow.
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:55.160]  Let's talk to James in Michigan and then we'll talk to Keith and Chris and Barbara and others.
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:56.160]  Go ahead, James.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.160]  Hey, Alex.
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:02.160]  I just wanted to say thank you so much for doing what you do.
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:10.160]  I will woke up to everything that was happening about three years ago when I first watched a road to tyranny film.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:19.160]  Ever since then, I've been researching and putting up the good fight against the New World Order, telling all my friends and my family.
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:22.160]  Yeah, five years ago when I made road to tyranny, we were on the road.
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:23.160]  Now we arrived.
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:24.160]  Yes.
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:25.160]  Yes.
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:28.160]  And I just want to thank you so much for what you do.
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:30.160]  You're a real patriot, Alex.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:33.160]  And I just can't thank you enough.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:35.160]  God's really leading you.
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.160]  He opened my eyes.
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:42.160]  And I thank him for you and what you do and the truth movement.
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.160]  We will win.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:45.160]  We will win the fight.
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:47.160]  And I want to thank you.
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:48.160]  Well, I know this.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.160]  We've got to do the right thing.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:52.160]  And it's going to be a lot better fighting than rolling over to them.
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.160]  They've told us no quarter, folks.
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:55.160]  That means they're not going to stop.
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:59.160]  It means you can get on your knees and they're going to run up in battle actually in the head.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:00.160]  Of course, that'd be a sweet way to go.
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:02.160]  They're going to drug you into believing in one child.
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:04.160]  You've euthanized you.
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:05.160]  Thanks for the call.
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:09.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Keith in New Jersey.
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:10.160]  Go ahead.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:11.160]  Hello?
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:12.160]  Yeah.
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:13.160]  Go ahead.
[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:14.160]  All right.
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:15.160]  A couple things.
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:16.160]  I'll make it real quick.
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:21.160]  Number one, as far as a lot of people not believing about gun confiscation, I just found that in Illinois.
[01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:23.160]  I'm not sure if you're familiar with Cage.
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:25.160]  Chicago anti-gun enforcement.
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:27.160]  They said Cage up five years ago.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:28.160]  They go around the minute.
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:31.160]  You know, 85 year old World War II veterans gun permit goes out.
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:34.160]  They swat team their houses and confiscate all the guns.
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:35.160]  Yep.
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:37.160]  They did it again two days ago.
[01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:38.160]  Law abiding citizen.
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:39.160]  Not a gun runner.
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:40.160]  Not a drug dealer.
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:41.160]  A law abiding citizen.
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.160]  That's the whole point.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:46.160]  Illinois is a great state, great people, but it's run by the mafia going back to the old
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:47.160]  daily machine.
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:50.160]  It was the puppet towards Al Capone and others.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:51.160]  They're not going to stop.
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:55.160]  I mean, you think a guy breaking in your house wants you to be armed?
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:56.160]  Criminals run the country.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:58.160]  They want our guns.
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:00.160]  What is a criminal doing?
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:01.160]  He robs a bank.
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:04.160]  The security guard, the off duty cop, drop your gun on the ground.
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.160]  Put your hands up.
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:06.160]  They told us.
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:07.160]  They came in.
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:08.160]  They're sticking us up.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:09.160]  They're going, put your guns down on the ground.
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:10.160]  It's real simple.
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:11.160]  And another thing.
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:15.160]  Since we're using military nomenclature, as far as being special forces, I know a lot
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:17.160]  of people don't want to take the plot lines on the Info War.
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:20.160]  Here's what I suggest for you college and high school students.
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:25.160]  If ever you have to do a report on banking or history, flip in a few things about the
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:26.160]  New World Order.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:27.160]  At least plant the seeds.
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:32.160]  So when people run across this information in the future, they'll be more receptive to
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:33.160]  it.
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:34.160]  Another thing, Christmas is coming up.
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:37.160]  Now, I know a lot of, I know you've been saying to buy your videos and give them out
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:38.160]  as gifts.
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:39.160]  Here's a better idea.
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:40.160]  Buy these three videos.
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:44.160]  Loose change, freedom of fascism, terror storm.
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:46.160]  Find your local police department.
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.160]  Think about five or six different cops.
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:50.160]  The higher the length, the better.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:51.160]  And here you go.
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:54.160]  And most of the time they'll thank you.
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:59.160]  Everywhere isn't like Lyon County, Kentucky, where they arrest you.
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:00.160]  But yeah.
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:02.160]  Yeah, and I've done that a couple times.
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:05.160]  And last but not least, donate to a couple libraries.
[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:08.160]  Oh, and also public access.
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:13.160]  If you have public access available to you, just run now to your local cable station.
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:14.160]  And I like to film play.
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:16.160]  I don't care if it's played at one in the morning.
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:17.160]  Hey, good job.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:18.160]  Good to hear from you.
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:19.160]  Gotta jump.
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:21.160]  Chris in Texas, go ahead.
[01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:22.160]  Chuck in Texas.
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.160]  Sorry.
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:26.160]  Alex, I wanted to make this quick here.
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:29.160]  Hey, Chuck, you hadn't called in about two years.
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:30.160]  Good to hear from you.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:31.160]  You remember me.
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:32.160]  All right.
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:33.160]  I remember you.
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:34.160]  You're from San Antonio.
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:35.160]  Uh-huh.
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:36.160]  That's the fact.
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:37.160]  Elephants don't forget, usually.
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:44.160]  Yeah, I just, I've been having a lot of stuff going on here.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:45.160]  I understand.
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:47.160]  Had to call in on this one.
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:53.160]  We had a new police chief, oh, about a year ago, William McManus.
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:57.160]  Yeah, he replaced Ali Phillips, a great American.
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:53:58.160]  Uh-huh.
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:06.160]  And now, this guy, he went to top school there in Washington, D.C.
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:09.160]  He was from Dayton, Minneapolis.
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:17.160]  And the whole time, so far, he only passed his Texas peace officer's exam.
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:19.160]  I think it was a couple of days ago.
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:26.160]  But they have a story on 8A about how now he's allowed to carry a gun.
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:29.160]  Yeah, they train them all in D.C. or L.A.
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:32.160]  And most of them are CIA and they ship them in.
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:33.160]  Stay there.
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:34.160]  I'm gonna let you finish up real quick on the other side.
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:43.160]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us a lot more.
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:45.160]  We're on the march.
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:47.160]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:56.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:01.160]  Come, you masters of war.
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:05.160]  Here they build the big guns.
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:09.160]  Here they build the death planes.
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:14.160]  Here they build all the bombs.
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:18.160]  Here they hide behind walls.
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:22.160]  Here they hide behind desks.
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:29.160]  I just don't want you to know I can see through your masks.
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:38.160]  You have never done nothing but build to destroy.
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:42.160]  You play with my world.
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:46.160]  I got your little toy.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:51.160]  You put a gun in my hand.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:55.160]  And you hide from my eyes.
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:56:01.160]  And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:06.160]  Well, I could do this of old.
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:10.160]  You lie in D.C.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:14.160]  I will work and be one.
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:19.160]  You want me to believe.
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:23.160]  But I see through your eyes.
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:27.160]  And I see through your brain.
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:38.160]  Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:46.160]  You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:51.160]  And then you set back and watch.
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:55.160]  When death counts get higher.
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:57:00.160]  You hide in your mansion.
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:04.160]  When the young people's blood
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:11.160]  flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:15.160]  You throw in the worst fear.
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:20.160]  That can never be hurled.
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:28.160]  To bring children into the world.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:32.160]  A horse riding in my baby.
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:37.160]  Unborn and unnamed.
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:42.160]  You eat worth the blood that runs in your veins.
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:45.160]  Welcome back.
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:49.160]  I think Bob Dylan says it all there, doesn't he?
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:51.160]  And Paul Craig Roberts joins us.
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:53.160]  Barbara, you'll be the only caller I have time to get to
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:55.160]  because of our guest being here.
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:57.160]  But I will get to you if you hold in the final segment.
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:57:59.160]  I'd love to hear from you, Barbara, in Texas.
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:01.160]  Or is it Tennessee?
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:05.160]  I never look at this on my riding ride here.
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:07.160]  I wanted to give Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on.
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:10.160]  He's the head policy number two, Department of Treasury.
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:13.160]  The father of Reaganomics, a real conservative.
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:16.160]  I wanted to get him on just to get his take.
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:19.160]  I said we're screwed and he said, yeah, we're screwed.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:21.160]  We're in deep trouble, folks.
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:24.160]  The Democrats did worse than I thought they would.
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:26.160]  No fence. We already knew that.
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:28.160]  They didn't really fund the fence.
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:31.160]  They're going to pass a hate crimes bill banning free speech in America.
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:34.160]  Preachers are already being arrested for praying on street corners.
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:36.160]  Preachers are already being fined for reading out of the Bible.
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:40.160]  This is happening in America, not Canada, not Germany.
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:45.160]  They are just butchering the entire country.
[01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:49.160]  And it's just horrible.
[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:52.160]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, thank you for joining us
[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:55.160]  and giving us your analysis of the election
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:58.160]  and where you think things are going from here, sir.
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:02.160]  Well, you've made me a seer, have you, Alex?
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:09.160]  You know, I don't know that they're going anywhere favorable,
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:14.160]  but they may not be going as many unfavorable places.
[01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:22.160]  I don't know whether the Bush regime will be able to attack Iran now.
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:26.160]  I think that the people voted against Republicans.
[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:29.160]  They did not vote for a Democratic agenda.
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:32.160]  And I think they're hoping to get the war over with.
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:37.160]  And I think they're concerned about this torture legislation
[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:40.160]  and the detainee legislation.
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:46.160]  The most serious thing that has happened to the United States
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:50.160]  in my lifetime happened last month
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:55.160]  when Bush got the detainee legislation passed
[01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:57.160]  and the torture legislation passed.
[01:59:57.160 --> 02:00:03.160]  And what this now means is that anyone in the United States,
[02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:11.160]  a citizen, a permanent resident, an illegal anyone,
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:16.160]  can be designated by any of a large number of government officials
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:20.160]  and military officers as a suspect.
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:23.160]  And if they're so designated,
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:29.160]  they can be arrested and imprisoned forever.
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:35.160]  And administratively have their citizenship revoked.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:37.160]  And then something that kind of went unnoticed
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:41.160]  was the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007.
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:44.160]  That abolishes the governor's and Posse common taught us.
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:47.160]  That's now been analyzed in top legal scholars on the left and right
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:49.160]  say it clearly does that.
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:51.160]  And now the Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and others,
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:53.160]  seem like they've circled the wagons with Bush.
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:54.160]  You're right.
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:55.160]  We sent them there.
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:57.160]  People sent them there to stop the war, to repeal that stuff.
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:59.160]  They're saying we're not going to repeal any of it.
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:01.160]  And you can go fly a kite.
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:03.160]  What do you say to that?
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.160]  Well, I think we have to take it with a grain of salt
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:11.160]  until they actually get in office in the next Congress.
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:14.160]  Because right now, if they make too many threats,
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:18.160]  how do you know Bush won't declare martial law and arrest them all?
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:20.160]  Or mail more anthrax to the Capitol?
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:22.160]  Yeah, right.
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:27.160]  You don't know.
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:30.160]  I think that they're corrupt too, of course.
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:34.160]  But I think that they will take some notice of the public
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:44.160]  and they will not expose themselves to any sort of detrimental position.
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:48.160]  So they can't start yelling and screaming now because they're not in power.
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:56.160]  Sure, Dr. Congressman Ron Paul, Dr. Roberts, also on the show said overall it's good.
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:59.160]  But how can it be good if they're saying they're going to ram through
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:05.160]  First Agenda, open borders, amnesty, guest worker, and the hate crimes legislation?
[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:09.160]  And how can it be good if they're saying they're not going to investigate Bush
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:10.160]  or not have impeachment?
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:14.160]  I mean, you and a few others are saying that maybe they'll do good.
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:18.160]  I'm seeing such unified since last week on Wednesday, the day after the election,
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:20.160]  before even the Senate was decided.
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:23.160]  They were already, you know, on the same talking points.
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:25.160]  I don't see good indicators there.
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:29.160]  Yeah, well, there may not be good indicators,
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:35.160]  but you can imagine how much worse they would be had the Republicans kept control of Congress.
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:40.160]  So I think that we can have some hope.
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:44.160]  And of course, we do have a conious impeachment report that's pretty thorough.
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:50.160]  So you think that the separation of powers is key and that the very nature of men and women
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:54.160]  shaking power, the Democrats won't be able to keep their hands off the zeitgeist,
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:55.160]  the lever of power.
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:59.160]  And so just for political selfishness, they're going to launch salvos at Bush?
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:04.160]  Yeah, I think that there is interested in power as he is.
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:12.160]  And they will have it in the Congress and they will probably not, for party reasons,
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:19.160]  be willing to sacrifice the legislative power to the executive the way the Republicans were.
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:25.160]  And I think the war thing is worn off and we know it's a disaster.
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:30.160]  Do you agree with the analysis that the Baker boys, the oil companies, the cleaners have come in
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:34.160]  to kind of spank the neocons and now deescalate things?
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:36.160]  Because Israel is saying they may go ahead and attack this month.
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:42.160]  Bush said yesterday when he met with the Israeli ambassador that he may go ahead and then back up and attack.
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:44.160]  Do you think that's just sword rattling?
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:50.160]  Yeah, I think it's pushed this into another war right now when we've already lost two
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:54.160]  and we don't have any way of getting the troops out of Iraq.
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:04:02.160]  That he will push far beyond what he can get away with. That's just my sense of it.
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:15.160]  And I think that the Israelis can create as much hell for themselves until they just won't be there.
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:21.160]  But if Israel, through insane Hutzpah attacks Iran, that's going to send the world into
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:26.160]  an economic spiral. I mean, all of the financial experts have said the dollars, teetering.
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:29.160]  There's all sorts of serious problems everywhere and that it's going to cause,
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:33.160]  that it's guaranteed to trigger a global recession bare minimum.
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:39.160]  Well, it'd be a very reckless thing to do for a number of reasons and that, of course, would be one of them.
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:42.160]  But Israel is reckless. Why do you think Israel is so...
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:47.160]  I mean, there's no reason for them to attack Iran. Why are they so wild?
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:56.160]  Well, it's the government they've got now. It's probably the least competent of all of their incompetent governments.
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:05:08.160]  And it's also, they were trying to seize the chance with the neocons and power in America
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:14.160]  to clean all of their enemies, potential enemies out of the Middle East.
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:27.160]  And what they've done instead is to create that shite crescent that runs now from Iran through Southern Iraq and Lebanon.
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:36.160]  And they have weakened all of our puppets, our puppets in Egypt and Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Pakistan,
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:49.160]  so that if they keep pushing the way they're doing, attack Iran, we could see regime change in Egypt and back then...
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:51.160]  Haji Mubarak, the lifetime dictator.
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:57.160]  Going back, we're talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, father of Reaganomics, former Wall Street Journal editor,
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:01.160]  and number two, Department of Treasury, really the head of the Treasury, the head technician there.
[02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:08.160]  What's, I should say, tactician? You've been at the highest levels of government.
[02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:14.160]  You've been around the Republicans that kind of spawned the neocon progeny.
[02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:22.160]  You've been there. What do you think after this election is going on in the White House right now with their insane hubris?
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:36.160]  Well, I think they've been chastened, and I do think that the old Republican establishment has decided that they can't let this neocon madness continue
[02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:41.160]  because it's wrecking the Republican prospects.
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:56.160]  So I do think that they will reassert some control, and one consequence I think will be the professional bureaucracies in the executive branch
[02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:06.160]  will regain some of their power, which has been completely taken away from them by the neocons,
[02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:14.160]  so that things will get back and do more balance and less recklessness.
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:17.160]  Dr. Roberts, you agree with me there in the break, though, that we're in a lot of trouble.
[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:20.160]  This is, I mean, I respect a lot of your opinions and your analysis.
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:24.160]  You're saying things are looking a little bit better now with what you're saying here on air,
[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:30.160]  and there is another kind of wild card joker in all of this,
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:38.160]  and that's that they were having trouble containing leaks on planet WMDs and white slave rings and everything else.
[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:42.160]  Now, with the Democrats coming in, most of the analysts are saying,
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:48.160]  we're going to see an explosion in the leakers as the perceived power of the neocons has been dimmed.
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:54.160]  How do you think that wild card may play into things?
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:08:05.160]  Well, if the leaks are explosive, it may lead to some serious thought about impeaching Bush.
[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:10.160]  I agree with you we're in a serious situation, and the main reason, in my view,
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:13.160]  we're in a serious situation is we've lost habeas corpus,
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:20.160]  and we have lost the protection from arbitrary and tyrannical government power.
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:24.160]  And we've had that since 1215 and running me in the Magna Carta.
[02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:28.160]  I mean, Hillary and the Schumers of the world are going to love having those powers.
[02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:31.160]  The Democrats, I don't think are going to repeal any of that unless we force them.
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:40.160]  Well, you know, the ACLU is very much trying to get these things repealed.
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:45.160]  But you know they're infiltrated, and I think they're there to drop the ball and create bad precedent.
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:54.160]  Well, I don't know. In my opinion, all of this happened because of 9-11,
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:09:04.160]  and the interpretation put on 9-11, and it was a cover for stealing power from the people
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:07.160]  and making the people vulnerable to police state actions.
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:09.160]  I agree. Stealing America. Here's my question.
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:20.160]  If 84% in a Anguson Reed scientific poll conducted for the New York Times and ABC News believe the official 9-11 story is a lie,
[02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:23.160]  then that shows that even though they've not been convicted in a physical court,
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:27.160]  the court of public opinion, it's a big, fat elephant in the living room.
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:34.160]  I mean, everybody knows now what you, you know, tentatively and tenuously said 9-11's an inside job.
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:39.160]  Clearly, so do you think that's broken their back to a certain extent?
[02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:48.160]  I think if there's ever a real investigation of 9-11, it'll break their back.
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:55.160]  But Bush could actually get impeached without 9-11 ever getting officially cleared.
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:58.160]  It's like getting Al Capone on tax evasion instead of murder.
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:02.160]  Right. That sort of thing can happen.
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:11.160]  You see, Alex, I agree that things are bad and the Democrats are weak-read and unreliable just like the Republicans.
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:22.160]  But the consequence of Bush has been to weaken the United States in every respect financially, economically, diplomatically.
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:30.160]  We're more isolated. We can't pull the same strings and issue the same orders.
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:32.160]  We meet resistance in the world.
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:34.160]  The soft power's been flushed down the toilet.
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:39.160]  The soft power's totally gone and the hard power is bogged down and back dead.
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:41.160]  They can't occupy back dead.
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:44.160]  So how are they going to conquer the Middle East?
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:51.160]  And Israel couldn't defeat 5,000, his bowl of fighters.
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:11:00.160]  So I think that there was a lot of hubris and overreach.
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:07.160]  And so we may gain back some of our rights and we may actually get some accountability.
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:12.160]  Unless they pull a rabbit out of a hat and blow up a city or release a bio-weapon.
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:20.160]  Well, I think now that's more risky for them to do it because as you pointed out many people don't believe them about 9-11.
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:25.160]  And a repeat performance could be harder to get away with.
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:34.160]  Well, that's been my goal every waking hour, waking up in cold sweats, trying to prove it as an inside job to break that tool in front of their faces.
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:36.160]  And I think we've to a great extent done it.
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:39.160]  And I just thank God for everybody's action on that.
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:42.160]  But it's like a 12-round heavyweight prize fight.
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:46.160]  I mean, we're in the 12th round, but we're both bloody and stumbling around.
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:49.160]  Folks, we're far from winning this thing, but we are in the fight.
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:52.160]  Yeah, I think there is a fight.
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:12:03.160]  And I think that the rest of the world looks a scans at the United States and at the Bush administration and at the neoconservatives.
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:10.160]  So in a way that also robs them in.
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:15.160]  You see, I mean, Rumsfeld is gone and they're filing charges against him in Germany.
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:20.160]  Now, he may go nowhere, but he'll never know if he travels abroad.
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:21.160]  Well, exactly.
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:22.160]  You can beat the rap.
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:23.160]  He's going to be picked up somewhere.
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:25.160]  You can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:29.160]  The image of him being indicted, exactly.
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:30.160]  That's right.
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:34.160]  And this will happen to the rest of them, too.
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:36.160]  It'll happen to the rest of them.
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:43.160]  And none of them will ever be sure where they can go without somebody knocking on the door or resting.
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:47.160]  Well, it's like Soros and Kissinger already can't go to 50-something countries.
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:48.160]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:50.160]  I knew Kissinger had some trouble.
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:51.160]  I didn't know about Soros.
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:52.160]  Oh, yeah.
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:55.160]  We'll be right back with some final comments from Dr. Paul Gert Roberts.
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:13:01.160]  We'll also talk to Barbara.
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:04.160]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:08.160]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:20.160]  Yeah, for me, just watching the Democrats come in is like seeing an old disgusting neighbor or enemy you thought you'd never have in your life again being back and all their little bug eyes and all the sick stuff they do.
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:23.160]  They're totally controlled by the globalist.
[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:26.160]  But, yeah, it is a defeat for the overall agenda.
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:32.160]  But the problem is the big banks and the moneymen and the defense contractors, they've made their trillions now off this fiasco.
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:35.160]  They just kind of blame their front men, the neocons.
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:45.160]  But, I don't know, before we go back to Dr. Roberts and take a final call here, Terror Storm, the last time I checked, was number 17 on the Amazon.com bestseller list.
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:48.160]  That is the New York Times' video sales list.
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:49.160]  We want to push it to number one.
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:51.160]  I'm asking for the help to do it.
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:54.160]  It'll be key for getting it placed in more stores around the country.
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:55.160]  It's so important.
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:56.160]  It's only $12.
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:01.160]  It's available at infowars.com, linked through over to Amazon.com.
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:03.160]  I want to go to number one.
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:09.160]  And we can do that if you go buy a copy today, or multiple copies, and then give them as gifts and do your Christmas shopping and be done.
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:10.160]  Go buy 20 copies.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:12.160]  You can't bid it at that price.
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:15.160]  We discounted it down to nothing, so it would move.
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:24.160]  And Terror Storm is available right now by linking through to infowars.com, where you can call and get a copy, 888-253-3139.
[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:30.160]  Dr. Roberts, what do you say to the whole police state, as you said, is still in place?
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:36.160]  Sure, the neocons may short circuit, but the Democrats just take the baton and move forward.
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:39.160]  How do we stop Hillary and others?
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:41.160]  Well, I don't know.
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:53.160]  What we want to do, and what we most important thing that we do is to be sure we repeal the detention and torture legislation.
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:54.160]  That's essential.
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:56.160]  I think it can be done because it's unconstitutional.
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:59.160]  I don't even think the current Supreme Court would uphold it.
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:03.160]  Do you see the Posse Comintatus annihilation that happened last month?
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:12.160]  Well, I think we have to reinstate that as well, because we don't want the military serving as domestic police.
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:16.160]  But actually, Alex, the police already militarized.
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:17.160]  I know, yeah.
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:18.160]  They have these SWAT teams.
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:20.160]  They've all got military weapons.
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:23.160]  It's already militarized.
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:30.160]  And so, in a sense, the Posse Comintatus is lost with these SWAT teams.
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:36.160]  But still, it's the federalization and the integration and Chertops integrating in the CIA.
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:37.160]  That's right, Alex.
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:45.160]  But just remember, the most important thing is that they can knock on your door right now and carry you off and nobody ever see you again.
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:46.160]  A judge will never know about it.
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:48.160]  You'll never appear in court.
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:50.160]  That's the most important thing.
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:57.160]  This has been impossible since about 1680 in England.
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:15:59.160]  And it's now possible in the United States.
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:00.160]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:03.160]  I really appreciate you joining us.
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:06.160]  I appreciate your patriotism, Dr. Roberts.
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:09.160]  And I hope to get you back onto the next few weeks for more analysis.
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:12.160]  Folks can read your great writing at Lou Rockwell and many other places.
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:14.160]  We have stories up on infowars.com.
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:16.160]  Godspeed, my friend.
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:18.160]  Well, I know you'll stay on your case.
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:19.160]  Oh, don't worry.
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:21.160]  I'm a pit bull on their throat.
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:22.160]  That's right.
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:23.160]  That's where you belong.
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:24.160]  God bless you, sir.
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:25.160]  All right.
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:26.160]  Let's go to Barbara in Tennessee.
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:28.160]  Let him go early so we can talk to you.
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:29.160]  Barbara, go ahead.
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:30.160]  You've got about a minute.
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:31.160]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:37.160]  Listen, I've been listening to you for five years and I just want to let you know my heart breaks, too, for the Iraqi people.
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:45.160]  And I also wanted to let you know that I received my freedom to fascism and the terrorist storm.
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:53.160]  My freedom to fascism last night, I was so motivated and encouraged just to know that we have someone like Aaron Russo with us in the fight.
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:55.160]  And I wanted to share this with everyone.
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:17:03.160]  Bush Sr. referred to all of us as budsters, which means we're broke, useless, and depressed.
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:06.160]  Yeah, you said the budsters on the blogs, yeah.
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:10.160]  Yeah, so that's what the arrogant elitists think of us.
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:15.160]  And we need to keep that in mind and just keep fighting.
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:18.160]  Well, it's like James Bond said in that movie.
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:19.160]  He said, do you expect me to talk?
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:22.160]  And they say, no, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:23.160]  They want to kill us.
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:24.160]  That's right.
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:25.160]  That's right, Alex.
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:27.160]  I'm not joking when I say that, boys and girls.
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:28.160]  It's true.
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:29.160]  He's right.
[02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:30.160]  Hey, I really appreciate you.
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:31.160]  Call me back another time, okay?
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:32.160]  And thanks for your support.
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:35.160]  Back to night, nine to midnight, back tomorrow, 11 to two.
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:36.160]  God bless you all.
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:37.160]  Get the terrorist storm.
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:45.160]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNLive.com or call 877-376-45.
