[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.000]  Well, I told you Air Raid Sirens were coming.
[00:32.000 --> 00:44.000]  There's Biden marching through Kiev with Zelensky today with Air Raid Sirens, real ones, going off in the background.
[00:44.000 --> 00:57.000]  And their new Minister of Defense has called for an invasion of Russia and occupying Moscow that would 100% lead to nuclear war.
[00:57.000 --> 01:06.000]  And Biden has said that the U.S. is with Ukraine and NATO all the way. Here's what he had to say.
[01:06.000 --> 01:15.000]  Remind us that freedom is priceless. It's worth fighting for, for as long as it takes.
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.000]  And that's how long we're going to be with you, Mr. President, for as long as it takes.
[01:21.000 --> 01:28.000]  We'll do it.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  But he won't go visit the collapsed southern border that's a war zone.
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  He won't go to Ohio and the train wreck or send federal aid.
[01:36.000 --> 01:43.000]  Doesn't care about the 25 veterans who've been in suicide today or the hundreds of day dying from opiates and fentanyl.
[01:43.000 --> 01:51.000]  Or another Chinese balloon. It's the exact same model floating over Hawaii right now.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  Or all the millions sick and dying from the poison shots.
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  Because he's a puppet in chief. We're going to be covering all that today.
[02:01.000 --> 02:10.000]  You know, I knew from sources that Tucker Carlson was working very hard behind the scenes on exposing that January 6th was an inside job.
[02:10.000 --> 02:19.000]  And he had some of his production crew here last week. I'll just leave it at that here in studio with us.
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  And I was getting critical of McCarthy saying, where is the January 6th foot of 12?
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  Turns out he's given all 42,000 hours of it to Tucker Carlson.
[02:32.000 --> 02:42.000]  And he's directed the Capitol Police to sit there with Carlson's crew. It's working around the clock to go through the 42,000 hours.
[02:42.000 --> 02:54.000]  Pretty amazing stuff. Exclusive from Axios when McCarthy gives Tucker Carlson access to Trove of January 6th riot footage.
[02:54.000 --> 03:02.000]  And just so happens, we already have Jim Hoff from Gateway Pundit who's been on this more than anybody other than Tucker Carlson.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  To talk about the 15 smoking guns of it being an inside job.
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  15 facts on the dozens of federal operatives who infiltrated the Trump crowds on January 6th.
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  The US Capitol or the hundreds of armed snipers that were there and helped execute the whole operation.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  The head of the Gateway Pundit will be joining us at the bottom of the next hour and an hour and a half from now.
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  We're going to be looking at all of this. It's a big deal because this can really bring down the deep state.
[03:29.000 --> 03:36.000]  Also, careful what you ask for. Fox is in that big multi-million dollar Dominion butting machine lawsuit.
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  Turns out in discovery, they've gotten some interesting documents.
[03:40.000 --> 03:48.000]  Fox versus Dominion discovery docs show employees admitting their products were quote, riddled with critical bugs leading to incorrect tallies.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  Incorrect results. We've got that news.
[03:54.000 --> 04:02.000]  Also, ATF leak documents reveal the Biden regime's plan outside of law to close down gun stores across the nation.
[04:02.000 --> 04:11.000]  A really incredible group of stories. British taxpayer funded anti-extreme study run by British intelligence.
[04:11.000 --> 04:18.000]  They find Shakespeare, Orwell, Tolkien, key texts for white supremacists, all for them to be restricted or rewritten.
[04:18.000 --> 04:27.000]  And guess what? The great author that wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and many books that I loved as a child, many books that my children love.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  I was just reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory last week to my five-year-old daughter.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  We've almost finished the book with nightly chapters.
[04:34.000 --> 04:41.000]  Instead of burning books, they just rewrite them. Now the Oompa-Lompas are trans and they're not allowed to call somebody fat.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  This is beyond book burning. It's all coming up today.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  And so much more.
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  infowars.com, band.video, and newswars.com with the coordinates of freedom.
[04:53.000 --> 05:01.000]  If you want to beat the New World Order and override their censorship, share those links now.
[05:01.000 --> 05:04.000]  Well, that's fantastic stuff.
[05:04.000 --> 05:12.000]  Diet Force is amazing. I'm 45 and I have bits. I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  Under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking Diet Force two tablets a day.
[05:21.000 --> 05:29.000]  Man, if you're struggling to get chip shaped for the ladies, mate, Diet Force is the go.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  You have to get to Diet Force and have two a day and just keep active.
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  infowarsstore.com, X7 Diet Force.
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  infowarsstore.com, baby.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  Now on sale.
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  We're cutting that call into an ad. I can guarantee you that.
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  God bless Australia. We'll be right back, folks. Don't go anywhere.
[05:49.000 --> 06:01.000]  infowarsstore.com, Diet Force. Get it now.
[06:19.000 --> 06:27.000]  If you had an analogy or an allegory or a parable where tyranny was symbolized by horses,
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  not picking on horses, you're using that as an allegory,
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  then the current New World Order system we've got out of the whole history of horses
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  is the Kentucky Derby winner or the Triple Crown winner.
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  It is the race horse of race horses.
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  It is the tyranny of tyranny.
[06:45.000 --> 06:50.000]  They're going to rewrite and destroy all literature, all art, all culture.
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  It's all being run out of the UK.
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  That's the center of the New World Order.
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  And a British intelligence funded report is calling for restricting Tolkien, Orwell,
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  and of course the evil Shakespeare as white supremacy.
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.000]  They are rewriting all of the author who wrote Charlie the Chocolate Factory's books.
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  The Olympus will be trans and so much more.
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  This isn't just book burning.
[07:17.000 --> 07:23.000]  This is defiling people and great artists and stealing their identities.
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  I knew citizenship was bad, but when I became the most censored person in the world
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  by the establishment and Patient Zero for it,
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  I learned that the worst part is they can misrepresent what you've said and done
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.000]  and you can't challenge it in those forums in any way
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  and they literally create a new identity for you or a straw man.
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  Now, I've been prominent enough that enough people have realized that I was a symbol
[07:49.000 --> 07:53.000]  of their attempted tyranny, which I've been defended by a lot of folks.
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  But for the tens of millions of others that have now been silenced and censored,
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.000]  they don't get to do that because they aren't as prominent.
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  So, remember, what's done to Alex Jones today is done to Donald Trump tomorrow
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  and done to you next.
[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  First, they came for the, and I did nothing because I wasn't a,
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  then they came for this group and I wasn't one of them, I didn't stand up.
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  By the time they got to me, well, there was nobody left to stand up.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  We have Jim Hoff, the head of Gateway Pundit, who's done, for any print publication,
[08:23.000 --> 08:30.000]  the best job, exposed the inside job that was January 6 and his research and his team's research
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  and their tireless dedication to this, which I appreciate
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  because they've helped keep my ass out of the gulag and many others,
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  and they're fighting for those that are in the gulags,
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  has been used as the blueprint of research for so many.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  And now Tucker Carlson, who's for a national talk show host
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  and the best job of exposing January 6 as an inside job,
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  I knew was doing a big in-depth investigation.
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.000]  Some of his crew was his producer, his main producers was here last week.
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  I'll just leave it at that and with us at the office.
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  But now it can be discussed because it's in the news.
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  Exclusive from Axios.
[09:04.000 --> 09:10.000]  McCarthy gives Tucker Carlson access to Trobe of January 6, riot footage.
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  And Tucker Carlson's people are inside the Capitol 24 hours a day,
[09:14.000 --> 09:22.000]  pouring over the 40 plus thousand hours of footage, a true Herculean, a gene-stable effort.
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  And I'm told in the coming weeks and months, you're going to see bombshell after bombshell after bombshell.
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.000]  I can also tell you from sources inside the Proud Boys trial that's ongoing,
[09:34.000 --> 09:41.000]  they've now entered the fifth week of that, that they're covering up the feds that actually ran the attack
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  and led the attack, and that the federal informants admit that the Proud Boys
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  and as well as the Oathkeepers were not planning to attack,
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  the judge is openly keeping those informants from being able to testify to the truth,
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  and no one is reporting on it other than Info Wars and Gateway Pundit,
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  and soon Tucker Carlson will blow the thing wide open.
[10:01.000 --> 10:08.000]  CIA operatives with sex operatives, infiltrating Proud Boys, planning capital attack documents on them,
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  this has all been confirmed.
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.000]  So CIA, and years ago I'd tell you that, you'd say, oh yeah, right, now it's like, well yeah,
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  they run the censorship, they're everywhere, yeah.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  CIA's not something special, it's like saying, well I drove down the highway and saw Walmart,
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  or I drove down the highway and I saw a buzzard flying around her.
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  I drove down the highway and I saw an 18-wheeler.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  I drove down the highway and I saw a Burger King.
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.000]  The CIA is a giant organization, one of 16 intelligence agencies.
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  It's the biggest and most corrupt, and all it is is a giant interface for woke terrorists
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  to attack this country and everything decent and good.
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  But they ran the whole attack.
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  No doubt we're working with elements of the Secret Service to try to set up Trump and myself,
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  and the Secret Service tried to get me to the head of the line and lead the march.
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  Thank God I was confused and just, my instinct told me wait 20, 30 minutes
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.000]  and try to find out what was going on, because how was I supposed to lead hundreds of thousands of people
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.000]  with no police escort?
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.000]  I was like, this just feels bad, let's wait here, let's see what Trump's going to do,
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  and thank God I wasn't there when they first breached, or I'd be in a gulag right now,
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  like 800 other people, but this is just incredible, that is coming up.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  Now I haven't talked a lot about it the last few months, because it's been waiting under the surface,
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  but now it's coming to a head, you're going to get all the exclusive information,
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  because I can tell you what you're going to get from Tucker with video evidence from the Capitol
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  is what Jim Hoff, who is the MVP with his crew of exposing this.
[11:42.000 --> 11:51.000]  So that's coming up bottom of the next hour, in about an hour and 20 minutes from now.
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  I also intend to open the phones up on January 6th, if you were there,
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  and it is what you think of this incredible information, and also Biden going to Ukraine,
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  the new defense minister in Ukraine calling for an invasion of Russia,
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  and the occupying of Red Square with Ukrainian tanks, that's a quote.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  So this is escalating extremely quickly, and so much more.
[12:15.000 --> 12:23.000]  Here today, the UN official treaty is now out to set up a UN run program
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  over all major healthcare systems in the world, and over your body,
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  a bunch of key smart city news, the British government and British intelligence involved
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  in trying to ban classical literature.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  They are really jumping the shark here, ladies and gentlemen, but it's actually happening,
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  moving to ban and restrict and rewrite William Shakespeare,
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Nobles and so much more.
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  There's also some amazing footage that I saw yesterday,
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.000]  and I've seen even more incredible footage now, it's a national news story,
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  very close to where my parents live.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  I know this because my 18-year-old daughter really loves my parents,
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.000]  so she lives with them, they've got a bigger house than I do, so she lives with them,
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  and she saw it happening, she called me this morning.
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  They blocked off probably two miles of South Lamar,
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  one of the main thoroughfares in Austin that runs through the middle of the city,
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  and they had drag racing and cars crashing and police being injured
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  and police being chased off, total lawlessness in the streets of Austin, Texas,
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  less than a mile from where my parents live.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  You have fires in the streets, robberies, assaults, just fireworks,
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  powerful mortars being shot at police,
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  and a city council woman saw this happening, people being caught on fire,
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.000]  just total bad luck, again police cars being attacked, overturned, it just went on and on,
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  and it took the city council woman more than 30 minutes,
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  35 minutes to get 911 to answer, and they said, we can't help you.
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  So when I talk about what Austin, Texas is like now, it's like Philadelphia,
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  it's like Chicago in many areas,
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  and if you shoot somebody trying to carjack you,
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.000]  the district attorney who is an admitted communist put in by George Soros will indict you,
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  no matter how innocent you are,
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  and the same is for the judge that found me guilty in the Sandy Hook kangaroo garbage
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  and then told the jury that I was guilty,
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  she literally is an anti-George Soros funded creature.
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  So this is what it's like to live with these folks, people say, well, why don't you leave Austin?
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  All our infrastructure is here, I don't have the money to set up an infrastructure like this,
[14:50.000 --> 14:59.000]  my crew lives here, but yes, we live in a city unrecognizable for what it was,
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  and when I say they closed off miles of streets,
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  reportedly by the time this ended after several hours,
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  it was backed up four or five miles in each direction.
[15:09.000 --> 15:17.000]  So imagine just running into something like this on a Friday night when you're trying to get home.
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  That's exactly what happened to my 18-year-old daughter while this idiocy was going on.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  I mean, I'll say this is tame compared to the muggings and the shootings and the stabbing.
[15:27.000 --> 15:34.000]  Remember last year, two black teens that were like 17 and 18 just shot up a whole crowd of people
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.000]  in downtown Austin on South Lamar where South Lamar crosses over by 6th Street,
[15:40.000 --> 15:47.000]  and they were out the next day the District Attorney released them because they were black.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  All right, we'll be right back.
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  So much huge news.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  We'll go to Ukraine and the unbelievable spiraling out of control there
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  and so much more straight ahead of this live Monday broadcast.
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.000]  Stay with us.
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes and full wars this had.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.000]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[16:19.000 --> 16:23.000]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  five, six, seven days a week.
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  It's really just incredible.
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[16:37.000 --> 16:38.000]  I know you spread the word.
[16:38.000 --> 16:39.000]  I know you pray for us.
[16:39.000 --> 16:40.000]  And that's wonderful.
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.000]  Keep doing it.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  all at the same time, keep us on air.
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarstore.com,
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  our funding problems will be over.
[16:58.000 --> 16:59.000]  Please take action now.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow Info Warriors here in the United States
[17:04.000 --> 17:05.000]  and around the world.
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000]  We are so excited to announce Info Wars MD.
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  It turns out the top company in the U.S. for supplements is owned by a patriot.
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.000]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  because they want to support Info Wars and keep us on the air.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.000]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands of the highest rated
[17:31.000 --> 17:37.000]  under the Info Wars label, Info Wars MD, exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  Check out the first of 10 new products at infowarstore.com
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  whether it's turmeric or whether it's joint care or whether it is super greens.
[17:46.000 --> 17:54.000]  We have them all at infowarstore.com under the banner of Info Wars MD.
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  This is the best deal out there and it keeps Info Wars on the air.
[17:58.000 --> 17:59.000]  Info Wars MD.
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  There is a war on for your mind.
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  This is an information war.
[18:05.000 --> 18:10.000]  Info Wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  they're all using the terms that Info Wars has popularized
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.000]  because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them.
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  But we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  and power you and your immune system and your family as well.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  You can also make straight donations at infowarstore.com
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.000]  clicking on the big red banner.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  A one-time or recurring, but I'm asking you to take action.
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.000]  We're non-violent.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.000]  you are literally non-violently politically punching the new world order in the nose.
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  We are going to defeat the new world order.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  We're going over the top, but right now is the critical juncture.
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  So please go to infowarstore.com and donate now.
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  Donate now.
[19:01.000 --> 19:06.000]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[19:06.000 --> 19:11.000]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  so that you will be safe.
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.000]  But the injection is not ready.
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors
[19:22.000 --> 19:26.000]  for the next 15 days to flatten the can.
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  I also need you to wear masks
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.000]  and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  That way we can consolidate control
[19:38.000 --> 19:45.000]  and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  You will then be my slave.
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  And then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  who will move your immune system
[19:55.000 --> 20:19.000]  to be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[20:19.000 --> 20:23.000]  I'm going to open the phones up and there's first news right through the bottom of the next hour.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  I'm going to give the toll free number out here in just a few minutes.
[20:26.000 --> 20:29.000]  On the specific issue of World War III
[20:29.000 --> 20:32.000]  and what you think of Biden's trip over there while ignoring,
[20:32.000 --> 20:35.000]  well, he's not ignoring, he's helping quarterback
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  as the figure had the destruction of our republic.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  Here's the headlines.
[20:39.000 --> 20:43.000]  World War III watch Ukraine's Defense Minister calls for invasion of Russia
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  while British intelligence declares classical literature terrorism.
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  These are not satire headlines. These are real.
[20:50.000 --> 20:55.000]  Biden turns up in Ukraine as disaster in Ohio rages.
[20:55.000 --> 20:58.000]  Kiev security chief thousands expel Russian troops from Ukraine's soil
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.000]  and Dubbs-Putin's Hitler's twin.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  Escalation in Kiev security chief thousands invade Russia
[21:05.000 --> 21:10.000]  as Biden visits Ukraine as they will capture Moscow.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  Hungary's Orban says Europe may end up sending troops to Ukraine.
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  It's already happening.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  America last Biden is in Ukraine.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  Trump is heading to Ohio.
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.000]  Strong reaction to secret Kiev trip.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  Biden's Secretary of State Blinken announced 1.85 million in aid to Turkey
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  following earthquake administration ignores East Palestine.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  Zelensky warns new evil actions of China and Russia
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.000]  could spark World War III as G-backs bloodthirsty Putin.
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  Blinken warns China against providing aid to Russia
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  says balloon surveillance must never occur again.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  Ukraine refugee girl finds San Francisco school so violent
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  she wants to go back.
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  Large white balloon spotted northeast over Hawaii.
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  Air traffic control confirms.
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000]  Here's shots of it. It's exact same type as the last one
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  shot down on the coast of South Carolina.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  So it goes on and on.
[22:10.000 --> 22:16.000]  That's odd. Air raid sirens sound off as Joe Biden's Zelensky walked through Kiev.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  Rage against the war.
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  Ron Paul, Tulsi Gabbard and Jimmy Dore, Roger Waters for peace.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  The big peace rally.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  Russia files for UN Nord Stream Inquiry.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  EU will neither confirm nor deny speculations.
[22:30.000 --> 22:38.000]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  I want to open the phones up and get your take on that situation
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  and then this because it's now ripe.
[22:46.000 --> 22:47.000]  It's now all coming out.
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  They've included their fake January 6 investigation where they sealed
[22:52.000 --> 22:57.000]  the file for at least 25 years a few months ago
[22:57.000 --> 23:01.000]  and are attempting to seal the 40 plus thousand hours.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  But now that McCarthy and the Republicans are in,
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  McCarthy has reportedly made good on his promise
[23:06.000 --> 23:09.000]  at least partially to release the footage he's doing with Elon Musk did
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.000]  or he's giving it in tranches or in segments to Matt Taibi.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  That's what Elon Musk is doing and deciding who he exposes and when.
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  Still hasn't released the Fauci files as he promised months ago.
[23:23.000 --> 23:27.000]  But in the case of McCarthy, he's gone further, not all the way,
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  but I like it.
[23:29.000 --> 23:35.000]  Access to the 40 plus thousand hours of footage to Tucker Carlson's producers.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  He's got a big team but not big enough.
[23:39.000 --> 23:40.000]  I mean, a hundred people couldn't go through that properly,
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  but I'm glad Tucker's on it.
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.000]  The thing to do is like WikiLeaks does where they post the tens of thousands of documents online,
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  then the public can crawl through them and find all the nuggets very,
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.000]  very quickly like with Hunter Biden's laptop.
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  McCarthy gives Tucker Carlson access to Trobe January 6 riot tape.
[23:58.000 --> 24:08.000]  Bigger Kevin McCarthy has given Fox News to Carlson exclusive access to 41,000 of those 40,000 hours of capital surveillance footage from the January 6 riot.
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.000]  McCarthy sources tell me Carlson TV producers were on Capitol Hill last night to begin digging through the trove,
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  which includes multiple camera angles from all the capital grounds.
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  Excerpts will begin airing in the coming weeks.
[24:22.000 --> 24:32.000]  Why it matters is it's an inside job and that ties into this big report with Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit at the bottom of the next hour.
[24:32.000 --> 24:38.000]  15 facts on the dozens of federal operatives infiltrated the Trump crowds on January 6 at the U.S. Capitol.
[24:38.000 --> 24:47.000]  This is a big deal and that is coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[24:47.000 --> 25:02.000]  But I want to give the toll free number out on Biden's visit on January 6 and on this subject that I'm going to cover next and then do your calls.
[25:02.000 --> 25:07.000]  Now, we become accustomed, even myself, and I know a lot of you as well, to living in this tyranny.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  It's how we cope.
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.000]  We fight it.
[25:09.000 --> 25:10.000]  We resist it.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  We speak out against it.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  We try to build a better world to compete with it.
[25:13.000 --> 25:18.000]  Another is to build our own good, positive little microcosms that others can see and follow by example.
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  We can follow their example when it's good.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  Competition.
[25:23.000 --> 25:32.000]  But I knew when they came out with Shazam over a decade ago, that app where you could hold up your phone at the mall and it would tell you in seconds what a song was.
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  They could use that to then voice print somebody, not just a song, and then erase it off the web and off the cloud.
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.000]  These things aren't really held on private servers anymore, they're held in the cloud and now indeed they can go through and erase things across the web whenever they want.
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.000]  You really upload it, they take it back down.
[25:47.000 --> 25:54.000]  Now, they aren't just doing this in the US or the UK, they're doing it all over the world.
[25:54.000 --> 26:06.000]  Private publishers and governments are going in and saying that book is improper and the publishers are then having them rewritten to be politically correct.
[26:06.000 --> 26:15.000]  So that's what Stalin would do after he'd kill or imprison one of his former aides or generals, minions.
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  They would just airbrush their photos out of the newspaper.
[26:21.000 --> 26:34.000]  And so every dystopic film, book, the famous Fahrenheit book that deals with this, Fahrenheit 451, Equilibrium, it's an excellent movie.
[26:34.000 --> 26:42.000]  With Christian Bale, they want ugliness, they want ugly architecture, they want you to give up, they want you to roll over, that's the plan.
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  You see these movies, you read these books, you say, this is ridiculous, this has never happened.
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  This is what happens in authoritarian regimes.
[26:47.000 --> 26:56.000]  And now with AI and computers, they can do it so much easier and they call themselves the liberals, the guardians of culture, the guardians of art,
[26:56.000 --> 27:04.000]  when they are outrageous criminals involved in crimes against humanity.
[27:04.000 --> 27:12.000]  British taxpayer-funded anti-extremist study finds Shakespeare Orwell tolking key texts for white supremacists.
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  British governments involved.
[27:13.000 --> 27:19.000]  UK's counterterrorism programs, this interest in great literature, a sign of far-right extremism.
[27:19.000 --> 27:27.000]  Lord of the Rings, George Orwell, Shakespeare, the list goes on and on.
[27:27.000 --> 27:37.000]  It's not satire, this is not the Babylon Bee, this is worse than burning books, this is rewriting them and stealing people's art and stealing their identities.
[27:37.000 --> 27:47.000]  And the left is a evil worldwide corporate dictatorship of transhumanists with a bunch of useful idiots following along with it, believing they're part of the winning team.
[27:47.000 --> 27:55.000]  No one on the face of this should go along with any of this garbage.
[27:55.000 --> 28:00.000]  Roland Dahl's book's rewritten to remove language-deemed offensive, London Guardian.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  Oompa-loompas are trans.
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.000]  You can't call violet mean or call the other girl fat.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  You can't call people mom and dad.
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  What a sick cult, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:13.000 --> 28:20.000]  Absurd censorship, UK publisher slam for making countless changes to Roland Dahl's books.
[28:20.000 --> 28:27.000]  He's internationally known for hitting children's classes as Charlie in the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, James the Giant Peach.
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.000]  I loved all those books.
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  Fantastic, Mr. Fox, many others.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  However, it looks like the new editions of his works have been altered.
[28:33.000 --> 28:41.000]  Critics have lashed out the changes, the children's books by the British publisher, using it of distorting the context he offers words.
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  They're lying to people and saying it's his work.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  When it's not, do you think he approved of this?
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  Think you could have ever imagined something like this would be going on?
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  More on this, and I'll give out the number when we come back.
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  Stop the censors.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  Spread the links.
[28:56.000 --> 29:11.000]  The Cavalry has arrived.
[29:11.000 --> 29:16.000]  Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken based bone broth you're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart, but more importantly, your immune system.

[32:16.000 --> 32:20.000]  And the good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[32:20.000 --> 32:27.000]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front but I'm not going to back down and I'll never give up but I could give out.

[32:52.000 --> 33:08.000]  Thank you for your support. Now take action. The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[33:22.000 --> 33:27.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:27.000 --> 33:36.000]  Well, Ben Garrison is the most prolific political cartoonist of our lifetime.
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.000]  He stands down the most popular and the most truthful.
[33:39.000 --> 33:51.000]  And he put on an image last week that's up on M4WareStore.com that shows the well of knowledge in the center square of the Ivy League University with a big trans rainbow flag flying up in the background.
[33:51.000 --> 34:00.000]  And it shows the dean with a big urn of poison lies, woke lies, dumping it into the well to kill the well of knowledge.
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.000]  And that's what the fuzzy math 2 plus 2 equals 10 and all the rest of it's about.
[34:05.000 --> 34:16.000]  And now thousands of so-called independent school districts around the country don't have one student that can pass a reading, writing or arithmetic test.
[34:16.000 --> 34:22.000]  That's right. There are thousands of schools where not one student in whole grades can pass.
[34:22.000 --> 34:28.000]  That's how you overturn society as you dump people down. You don't teach them knowledge or business or life or morals.
[34:28.000 --> 34:37.000]  You teach them how to have a chip on their shoulder and be part of a different organization or group in the mob that the government controls.
[34:37.000 --> 34:44.000]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen. Right here, this image says it all.
[34:44.000 --> 35:00.000]  Now, imagine British intelligence funding studies saying that Shakespeare, Tolkien, Orwell are bad.
[35:00.000 --> 35:05.000]  And the publishers immediately get in line and say, we'll rewrite everything.
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  Did those authors say you could rewrite their books? Is it still that author's book?
[35:09.000 --> 35:15.000]  No, it's a fraud and it's beyond book burning and it's next level evil.
[35:15.000 --> 35:22.000]  British taxpayer-funded anti-extreme study finds Shakespeare, Orwell, Tolkien, Keytext for white supremacists.
[35:22.000 --> 35:31.000]  Several of the UK's most respected TV shows, movies and works of literature have been included in a list of works that could potentially encourage far-right sympathy.
[35:31.000 --> 35:41.000]  Anything that encourages it is not going to be outlawed. Compiled by taxpayer-funded government-led prevent counter-terrorism program.
[35:41.000 --> 36:00.000]  The Daily Mail reports the works of some of the world's greatest writers, including examples of the warning signs potentially streaming this include Shakespeare, Chaucer, Milton, Tennyson, Orwell, Huxley, Kipling, Edmund Burke.
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.000]  UK's counter-terrorism program says interest in great literature assign far-right extremism.
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  You're like, well, that'll never happen.
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.000]  Roland Dahl's book's rewritten to remove language-deemed offensive.
[36:12.000 --> 36:18.000]  And the Daily Mail loves it and thinks it's really good. Can't use the word ugly and beastly.
[36:18.000 --> 36:27.000]  Can't say ugly, can't say fact. The Opalumpas are trans.
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  It goes on from there.
[36:30.000 --> 36:39.000]  Absurd censorship. UK publisher slammed wrinkly countless changes to Roland Dahl's books.
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  And it goes on from there.
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  You got to read these changes.
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.000]  It's up on infowars.com.
[36:48.000 --> 36:53.000]  Talk about turning over in your grave.
[36:53.000 --> 37:00.000]  Augustus Gloop from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory can't be fat, but gender-neutral Opalumpas aren't small.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  Small's bad too.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  And even the BFG's gone PC.
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  Woke publishing censors rewrite his classic books for new editions that remove all language.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  Slowfakes might find offensive.
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  But it's not for the snowflakes. They're just the menus that go along with it.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  It's the establishment. It's the intelligence agencies.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  All of them being rewritten.
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  And it's just the beginning.
[37:24.000 --> 37:31.000]  Beyond Fahrenheit 451, you don't burn books, you just rewrite them.
[37:31.000 --> 37:40.000]  But of course, books themselves were outlawed in that dystopic projection of Ray Bradbury.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  Here's a report on infowars.com.
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.000]  Study finds people with higher cognitive ability care more about free speech than political correctness.
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.000]  We don't just care about it. We have political correctness as a cancer.
[37:53.000 --> 38:00.000]  Meanwhile, we're spending too much time on Don Lemon being backmenched,
[38:00.000 --> 38:12.000]  maybe even removed for saying that the Republican female that's announced she's running is past her prime.
[38:12.000 --> 38:18.000]  Let's see how this can be used against everybody.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  Nikki Haley.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  So that's just the beginning of all of this.
[38:23.000 --> 38:30.000]  They want to control every facet of your life and they want everything that makes us strong,
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  everything that makes us secure, everything that works to destroy.
[38:34.000 --> 38:40.000]  You can't go to CNN or The Washington Post any day without finding an article saying how wonderful it is for you and your wife
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.000]  to decide to start having other relationships, even though 95% of the time it breaks up the marriage.
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  They're saying, especially if you have kids, go out and have an affair.
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.000]  Boy, they're really your friends, aren't they?
[38:52.000 --> 38:58.000]  A monogamous couple happily become non-monogamous.
[38:58.000 --> 39:05.000]  School district enlists Black Lives Matter force, called a force, to march the white kids out into the parking lot
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  and teach them that they're bad. That's gang psychology, folks, driving them into submission.
[39:10.000 --> 39:17.000]  Parents outright, children told they must wear pride shirts to play at league halftime game.
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.000]  Woke AZ Teacher Slam's anti-porn bill, it's actually an anti-child porn bill,
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.000]  which shows kids having sexual kids and adults, says parents are not qualified to decide what their children learn.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  There's video of her saying that.
[39:30.000 --> 39:36.000]  Trans female offended when asked if she has a penis after she brought it up. That's horrible.
[39:36.000 --> 39:43.000]  They're completely fine with talking to your children about their genitals, but you can't ask them.
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.000]  These are the people that have gone under the globalist mind control. This is the cult.
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  Look at these people.
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.000]  It's a coincidence that this trans woman with trans partner has not one but two transgender kids.
[39:56.000 --> 40:07.000]  Of course not. And it goes on and on and on and on.
[40:07.000 --> 40:18.000]  Man goes into female locker room and sues woman who asked him to leave for being transphobic.
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  Absolute target of our children by this cult.
[40:21.000 --> 40:28.000]  They're arrested in Florida for human trafficking a youth pastor and a foster parent tied in to the illegal aliens being brought in.
[40:28.000 --> 40:37.000]  Loudoun County school board refuses to release internal report detailing the district's mishandling of sexual assaults by transsexual students in the bathrooms.
[40:37.000 --> 40:47.000]  Illinois governor, the trans cult leader, lashes out at Chicago police for hosting governor to San us at police event and admits he supports comic book porn in classrooms.
[40:47.000 --> 40:56.000]  It's not porn, it's child porn. Three small details in the photo of first Taliban trained pilots could be damning for Biden.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  Wait till we get to that.
[40:58.000 --> 41:05.000]  Look at this. According to the 17 count indictment, the adoptive dads who are LGBT activists allegedly performed oral sex on both boys,
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  forced their children to perform oral sex on them and aimily raped their sons.
[41:09.000 --> 41:15.000]  They were trying to sell them as sex slaves and shooting child porn with them.
[41:15.000 --> 41:21.000]  Now notice when this was reposted on Twitter, the left was all in there saying it isn't real, really not real daily mail.
[41:21.000 --> 41:29.000]  Gay Atlanta couple charged with raping adopted sons who then pimped them out to other local pedophiles.
[41:29.000 --> 41:34.000]  Gay couple accused of raping multiple adopted children will face trial.
[41:34.000 --> 41:43.000]  Atlanta father charged with raping sons was accused of another sex crime seven years ago with a child.
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  Georgia couple charged with using their adopted children to make porn.
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.000]  Metro Atlanta couple charged with using adopted kids to make child porn.
[41:52.000 --> 41:57.000]  And this is something the left is defending and agreeing with.
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.000]  Let me give the toll free number out. We'll start taking your calls next segment.
[42:01.000 --> 42:09.000]  877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex, 877-789-2539.
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.000]  Let's do first time callers please. Give first time callers a chance.
[42:13.000 --> 42:18.000]  And we're talking about January 6 information coming out in Tucker Carlson getting the footage.
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  Hallelujah. You know the deep state's scared.
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.000]  Biden in Ukraine the whole World War III situation.
[42:27.000 --> 42:38.000]  Those are two giant topic areas that I would ask you to call in on those specifically 877-789-2539.
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  We don't assist your calls. We don't screen your calls.
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.000]  All we ask is you have a clean phone line and be ready to talk.
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  This and so much more coming up today.
[42:49.000 --> 42:55.000]  And when we come back, we'll look at your brain on drugs in 877 versus 2003.

[44:04.000 --> 44:07.000]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  They told you we were going to be shut down. They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  None of that's true. It's all being appealed.
[44:16.000 --> 44:21.000]  They want you to think M4 Wars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support M4 Wars,
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.000]  we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.

[47:32.000 --> 47:35.000]  and recognize how truly tyrannical this is.

[47:41.000 --> 47:47.000]  and Biden visiting Ukraine and the Defense Minister calling for an invasion of Russia
[47:47.000 --> 47:50.000]  that would lead to a certain nuclear war.

[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  The bad news is we're barely in the black treading water.

[48:13.000 --> 48:18.000]  I'd like to be able to spend more time on news and information instead of funding.

[49:39.000 --> 49:45.000]  Nobody has got this quality of CBD oil in 1,000 milligram, 25 milligram and 10 milligram
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  anywhere near this, so it's something everybody should be taking.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  It's so good for your body, so good for your nervous system.

[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  Also, Nitric Boost, Dr. Mikovits looked at it, so this is the best formula you've seen
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  for known compounds to clean out your blood and naturally thin it.
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  And the counter, the garbage that's out there bombarding us.
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  So, Nitric Boost is available at infowarstore.com as well.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  Nitric Boost, infowarstore.com.
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  Okay, I told you about this latest meme.
[50:18.000 --> 50:23.000]  I think it says it all. It's an image of the egg and the frying pan from the 1980s
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.000]  anti-drug ad. This is your brain on drugs.
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  Again, I'm never ready for radio listeners.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  In 1987, this is your brain on drugs.
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  A frying pan with an egg in it, frying.
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  In 2023, you can't afford the egg.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  The gas stub is being outlawed.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  The only thing you can get is the drugs.
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  Bingo, ladies and gentlemen. Bingo.
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.000]  All right, without further ado, let's go to your phone calls.
[50:55.000 --> 50:59.000]  Let's go to Matt in New Jersey on the war buildup and the Biden visit to Ukraine.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  Welcome, sir.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  Go ahead.
[51:04.000 --> 51:09.000]  I think it's disgusting that he goes over to Ukraine and gives them probably a bunch more money,
[51:09.000 --> 51:13.000]  or he got a check, I don't know, either way.
[51:13.000 --> 51:17.000]  How much longer are we going to poke Russia before they strike back at us?
[51:17.000 --> 51:22.000]  How much more money are we going to give until we don't have anything left?
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  Well, that's the name of the globalist game.
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  Turn off our pipelines, blow up the pipeline into Germany,
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  grab us all into total debt, send $200 billion.
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  It's almost $200 billion. It's like $192 billion as of last week.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  $192 billion.
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.000]  It's been sent by other countries, so that's $290 billion.
[51:41.000 --> 51:45.000]  And a lot of it's been laundered back out of the country. It's just incredible.
[51:45.000 --> 51:53.000]  What do you make of the new Ukrainian defense minister saying that they want to invade Russia and take over Moscow?
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  It's the start of World War III.
[51:56.000 --> 52:03.000]  I mean, Russia's got the long-range missiles, too, and they're going to attack Ukraine from all ends, I can say it.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  And this is going to escalate into World War III. It's horrible.
[52:05.000 --> 52:13.000]  It is, brother. I appreciate your call. How do we stop? It's a question. Franklin and Virginia, go ahead.
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on. I'm a first-time caller.
[52:17.000 --> 52:26.000]  I'll just call on your thoughts on how do you think China's positioning themselves with the Ukraine-Russia conflict.
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.000]  The Chinese diplomat came to Moscow today.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  So how do you think China's going to position themselves?
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.000]  Well, we know. China's giving them weapons, though they've denied it. They're giving them raw material.
[52:39.000 --> 52:45.000]  Iran's sending them a lot of weapons. Israel's now been attacking with drones inside Iran.
[52:45.000 --> 52:49.000]  So this is how World War start. You have different alliances that start clashing.
[52:49.000 --> 52:54.000]  Things escalate and then you wake up and you're in a giant World War, this time with nuclear weapons.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  So that's where I see it going, my friend.
[52:56.000 --> 53:02.000]  But historically, Russia and China have been really allies, especially during the Cold War.
[53:02.000 --> 53:07.000]  Well, that's right. They were competing forces in their communist evil.
[53:07.000 --> 53:11.000]  China wanted to control Southeast Asia with its brand of communism in other areas.
[53:11.000 --> 53:17.000]  And Russia was a competitor in the region. But this has only driven the two powerful blocks together,
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.000]  which is why, even from a geopolitical view, it's not a good idea.
[53:21.000 --> 53:28.000]  But our ruling class wants to launder money and wants to sell out of weapons and wants a political distraction.
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  Where do you think it's going?
[53:30.000 --> 53:37.000]  I do think that China and Russia are definitely going to form some sort of alliance, especially economically.
[53:37.000 --> 53:42.000]  But it's not good because we're kind of stretching out our resources here.
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.000]  I don't think we can fight a two-front war like how we did in the 40s.
[53:46.000 --> 53:52.000]  I totally agree with you. And also, India historically has not been big buddies with China, but now they are.
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.000]  So they've been driven closer to China and Russia, who they have been historical friends with.
[53:56.000 --> 54:02.000]  How much Franklin? Pro or pro in Seattle? You're on the air. Go ahead.
[54:02.000 --> 54:08.000]  Yeah, thanks, Alex. I was just figuring it out that, you know, they said they're going to do a book banning,
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.000]  and the words in the book, this is all leading up to banning the Bible.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  They want to get rid of everything else, so then they can say,
[54:15.000 --> 54:19.000]  well, see the Bible is the evil thing and what it has to say.
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.000]  That's right. They set the precedent with all these other books, and then they say,
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  see, now we've got to ban the Bible. I totally agree with you.
[54:27.000 --> 54:36.000]  Canada and Germany in places already arrest preachers that read verses out of the Bible that they say are, quote, homophobic.
[54:36.000 --> 54:42.000]  Yeah, and I listen to people like Boxing Body, who's not even in our nation anymore.
[54:42.000 --> 54:47.000]  He's in the African country, but he reads the Bible by the word of the Bible, not by his interpretation.
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.000]  They want to interpret the Bible, not the true word of Christ.
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  And they have to do this in order to bring on the world order.
[54:54.000 --> 54:58.000]  Well, I'm glad you raised the Bible, because I thought of that this morning when I was going to cover this for a while here.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  They've already written thousands of different versions of it.
[55:01.000 --> 55:10.000]  The left's already tried to flood the zone with twisted interpretations and twisted versions of the Bible.
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  So this is really nothing new.
[55:13.000 --> 55:18.000]  Yeah, it's all perversions. It's perversions, deception of princes and principalities.
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.000]  The question I have is, when will the saints rise?
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  When will we say enough's enough and take it back?
[55:24.000 --> 55:31.000]  We're trying to do it peacefully, but we will not be led to slaughter to the lions, you know, to the guillotines.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  We will fight back.
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.000]  I agree with you. Thanks for the call.
[55:34.000 --> 55:39.000]  I mean, what happened is the Rockefellers and others started the extremenical movement about 130 years ago.
[55:39.000 --> 55:45.000]  And so they've infiltrated the seminaries and taken over most of the churches, Protestant, Catholic, you name it.
[55:45.000 --> 55:53.000]  Those that stay traditional, that are Protestant or Catholic, are now being listed as the number one terror threat by the FBI in this country and similarly in Europe.
[55:53.000 --> 55:59.000]  I mean, these are the bad guys, folks. British intelligence is coming out and saying William Shakespeare is bad.
[55:59.000 --> 56:05.000]  These are the bad guys. They're saying Orwell books are bad because it exposes them.
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  They're the bad guys, folks.
[56:07.000 --> 56:11.000]  Rich in Tennessee. Richer on the air.
[56:11.000 --> 56:21.000]  Yeah, hi, Alex. It's an honor. We go way back. I even remember you as a host on coast, but at any rate, I just want to say that this is probably a good thing.
[56:21.000 --> 56:27.000]  These people are overplaying their hands and everything they attack, they're going to hit on a certain group.
[56:27.000 --> 56:36.000]  And, you know, when all this shakes out, I mean, I think they're probably going to hit us with biological weapons and a war and destroying the economy.
[56:36.000 --> 56:43.000]  But when all this shakes out, none of these people that want to be at the top are going to be at the top, but we're going to start over with sovereign states again.
[56:43.000 --> 56:48.000]  I agree. The millions of the New World Order have been set up by Satan.
[56:48.000 --> 56:53.000]  Right, right. No doubt there's a lot of dark, evil things going on right now.
[56:53.000 --> 57:01.000]  Can you believe how the mask is off and how they're just right out in the open, pushing total censorship, pedophilia, open borders, the end of the family?
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.000]  I mean, why would anybody sign on to these people when you can see as soon as they get control, everything falls apart?
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  Why do their minions follow it? Because it's a spiritual thing.
[57:10.000 --> 57:19.000]  I can believe it because they've got nothing to hide now. This is the last card they have to play. That's another indication. We're at the end game here.
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  They can't hide it anymore.
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.000]  I agree. And the time we have left, Rich, do you think this Russia war is going to peter out?
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  Biden says it's going to go on forever, basically. It looks like it's only going to get worse.
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  No, I think it's going to escalate. That's where we're headed.
[57:33.000 --> 57:44.000]  It wouldn't surprise me if Russia finally got sick of being the beat-up boy all the time and, you know, maybe they didn't even shoot a nuke at once.
[57:44.000 --> 57:50.000]  I agree. Hour number two with Stu Peters, Jim Hopton, war coming up.
[57:50.000 --> 57:56.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes and full wars this had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[58:00.000 --> 58:09.000]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[58:09.000 --> 58:18.000]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[58:18.000 --> 58:27.000]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[58:31.000 --> 58:37.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTour.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[58:37.000 --> 58:43.000]  All at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[58:43.000 --> 58:49.000]  If just 1% more of you took action at InfoWarsTour.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[58:49.000 --> 58:55.000]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness company.
[58:55.000 --> 59:03.000]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company. I contribute with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[59:03.000 --> 59:13.000]  Far and away, the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement that features natokinase. It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[59:13.000 --> 59:19.000]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein. This is very important.
[59:19.000 --> 59:24.000]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[59:24.000 --> 59:32.000]  People are low with the spike protein. They don't feel well. This is a potential solution. Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[59:32.000 --> 59:36.000]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase. Isn't it interesting?
[59:36.000 --> 59:42.000]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[59:42.000 --> 59:49.000]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support. And thank you for getting into that because it's important. You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[59:49.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  The breaking news. Stay at home. That is the order tonight from four state governors. You absolutely must stay at home. You must stay at home.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  All gatherings are canceled until further notice.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  I have issued an executive order. It's not a suggestion. It's an order.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  We will shut you down. We will cite you. And if we need to, we will arrest you and we will take you to jail.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  This means no weddings, in-person services, or even parties.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  The time for educating people into compliance is over.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  I'm using my power as governor under an emergency declaration to order you to close.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  Quarantine will be mandatory.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  Those few bad actors will be identified and the Tampa Police Department will handle it.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  We're watching you and we are going to take decisive action.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information that's powerful. And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims. This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  Everything that's in the other documents, but this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  And the hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics mad men.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends. You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  It's scary.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  One thing the NFL really plans to do this year is take as many precautions as possible just to keep everybody safe.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  And that starts with a vast majority of teams deciding already that there will be no fans at all allowed inside the stadium for the games.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  And every single player in the league has been given a smart tag tracking device to help them keep their distance off the field and for contact tracing should it become necessary.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  Players are not excited about this kind of idea of no fans.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  Yes, but they may have to get used to it.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  But all around the country there will be empty stadiums and masks on the sidelines. No fans will be allowed in.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  I can't imagine how he playing in the NFL this day and time with no fans there. I honestly can't even conceive that.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends. You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Don't get the vaccine. You can't go to the supermarket. Don't have the vaccine. You can't go to the ball game.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  Don't have the vaccine. You can't go to work.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  Because everybody in the establishment will still kind of halfway listen now and go listen around about everything else.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  Maybe we should look into this. Look, you'll believe it if they release it. So just remember this transmission then.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  The Orange County Coroner's Office is investigating the death of a woman who passed away several days after getting her second Moderna vaccine.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  She died after suffering blood clots just over a week after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  Her 58-year-old mother died less than an hour after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  My little sister just died. Her first dose.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  And in Orange County, an x-ray technician has died after getting his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  His dad died four days after getting his second shot of Pfizer vaccine.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion. I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  You really need to get vaccinated.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  Don't resist when they release a bio-weapon. Submit and die with pleasure.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  I have fantastic stuff.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  Diet Force is amazing. I'm 45 and I have bits. I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  Under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking Diet Force two tablets a day. Man, if you're struggling to get my chip shape for the ladies,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  Diet Force is the go. You have to get the Diet Force and have it to a day.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, X7 Diet Force.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, baby.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  Now on sale.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  We're cutting that call into an ad. I can guarantee you that.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant. God bless Australia. We'll be right back, folks.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  Don't go anywhere. InfoWarsStore.com, Diet Force. Get it now.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  Most of human history has been competing systems of tyranny, fighting with each other,
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  but only in the Renaissance age, the last 550 years that we've seen a move to try to empower humanity and lift up the masses.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  And it did it. But the globalists have made the conscious decision to reverse all that, destroy culture, art, literature, the family,
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  prosperity, and create a nightmare system for 99.99% of the public.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  They don't want anyone to support what they do.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  But they trick people through the educational system and through the culture to think they're winners if they go along with the New World Order.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  Now we're already in a war with Russia. It's spiraling out of control.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  There's massive censorship and control, book banning going on everywhere.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  And then the left accuses populistic conservatives and nationalist and classical liberals of book banning when we don't want pedophilic books
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  given to elementary and middle schoolers teaching them to have pedophilic sex with adults.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  Now that's not book banning. That's saying don't give those books to children.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  The left are the ones banning films, banning individuals, banning literature, rewriting books.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  And we covered a lot of that in the last hour. As British Intelligence openly says, Shakespeare and George Arwell and J.R.R. Tolkien are bad.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  We're taking your calls on those subjects and McCarthy has made good on his promise to release the January 6th footage.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  I would have done an open source to the world, but he's giving it to Tucker Carlson, who I do trust.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  I don't know how Tucker's going to digest all that.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  Jim Hoff joins us at the bottom of the hour to discuss it. We're going to go back to your phone calls here in a moment, Allison in the UK and others.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  But first, Jimmy Dore was at the big peace rally Saturday with Ron Paul and others.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  I really like Jimmy Dore. I want him on the show, but he doesn't ever come on.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  We send him emails, but he says nice stuff about me everywhere.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  The guy's really funny and smart, even though he's kind of reproved now and kind of woken up from the old days.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  He was spinning on me in public and things at the Young Turks at the RNC in 2016.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  Here's Jimmy Dore on Patrick Bendabid's program just yesterday, knocking it out of the park.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  The only difference between a Democrat and a Republican, as Ralph Nader said, is the speed at which their knee hits the floor when a donor walks in the room.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  And so it doesn't matter who's president.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  Barack Obama was not a departure from George Bush. He was a continuation of George Bush. He took us from two wars to seven wars.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  He kicked 5.1 million families out of their homes while he made sure the bankers didn't miss their bonuses.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  He deported twice as many Hispanics as Donald Trump. He built those cages that put those people and he dropped 26,000 bombs.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  The Air Force ran out of bombs. That's a fact. They ran out of bombs. He dropped so many bombs.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  There was a drone program that killed 90% innocent people. If somebody walks into a mall and shoots 15 people down with this gun,
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  that's the biggest thing. Oh my God, Barack Obama was doing that on a daily basis, killing women and children with his drone war.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  And he got a Nobel Peace Prize. He got a Nobel Peace Prize. He didn't even do anything.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  And so it's a unit party. And so when Trump got in office and he mentioned that there's a deep state,
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  they're like, you can't say that. What are you doing? And when he said, hey, when they asked him, why are you leaving your troops in Syria?
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  And he said, for the oil. They're like, you get my good for good. He goes, no, it's for the oil. No, it's for liberty.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  It's for helping the people. No, it's for the oil. It's our oil. And so he let the cat out of the bag and they can't have that.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  That's what he blew the whistle on what's actually going on. Our wars are for oil. Our wars are economic wars, just like what's happening in Ukraine.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  This is an economic war. We're trying to put a hurt and isolate Russia.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  We're afraid of Russia and their natural resources and their manpower coming together with Germany with their technology and their capital.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  And we've been saying that for decades. And so that's why we blew up the Nord Stream pipeline. And that's why this Ukraine war is happening.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  And people have no idea what's happening. And what's worse is they have no idea that they have no idea what's happening.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  That's the crazy part.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  Very well said. Absolutely true.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  I want to play one more clip. I'm going to go to your calls. This is a woman in Brazil where the convicted felon communist has been installed by the State Department Election fraud.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  Talking about two to three years in prison and your children being taken away and all of this and they'll still forcibly inject you with the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA shots.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  That's where they want to take us. And it's only one election away. You're able to get their way. Look what they've done in Brazil. Here it is.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  This is completely insane. This is a nightmare. Listen very well.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  The penalty is imprisonment from two to eight years plus fine if you refuse vaccination without just cause.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  The same penalty is incurred by anyone who creates, disseminates or propagates by any means fake news regarding vaccines in the National Immunization Program or their effectiveness, which in any way disures vaccination.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  Right now, I'm sure that my life is in danger. I have no doubt about.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  Now that's always been the plan through the UN announcements and now the UN Treaty to arrest those that don't take shots and put them in jail and then give you a special high powered mRNA shot,
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  which they arrested thousands that protested the election fraud and gave them shots that reportedly were even far deadlier than the normal ones.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  This is all just a cover for execution. This is how they come in a biomedical tyranny.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  They're not starting World War Three. They're coming up for a bodily autonomy. Allison in the United Kingdom. Thanks for calling. You're on the air.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  Yes. Hi.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  Welcome.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  Hi. Thank you.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  Raised by you earlier about how to stop World War Three. And I wanted to say, I think there should be a neutral territory between, you know, Poland and between Russia and Poland, where it's just no government should be exercised.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  And it should be equal parts according to the ratio of space to people from each country so that there's no tip about who should fight over what area.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  You know, you know what I mean, I think.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  Hello.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  And good products too, by the way. And I got your great reset book as well. I haven't read it yet, but it's a signed copy.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  Well, thank you for the support. It's people like you, Allison, that keep the broadcast on the air. And look, my big issue is why aren't there bigger protests?
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  Why are more people upset about something that is quickly, again, escalating into nuclear war? That's my issue.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  Yeah, prayer and fasting too, of course, to stop a war like this.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  Well, you sound like you're an American or a Canadian. How long have you lived in the UK?
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  Not long. I moved here because I married someone.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  How are you liking it?
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  Well, it's a big adjustment, trust me. But the people here are very nice.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  They're too nice. And that's why the globalists are conquering the UK and Canada and everywhere else. It's time to stop being so nice.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  That's what the New World Order is doing. But no, I absolutely hear you. I appreciate your call. Thank you.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to another caller. Let's go ahead and talk to...
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  Hmm. Let's talk to Linda in Oklahoma. Linda, you're on the air on China and the Fentanyl crisis. Go ahead.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  Thank you for having me. I just want to call and ask people that claim to be Christians, please pray for the church.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  They have failed us. They are falling right in line with all of this propaganda.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  I just lost my grandson to Fentanyl and he's 33 years old with a four-year-old. And it should have never happened.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  And we had a woman there that used to be an awesome pastor in that town.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  She got up and started talking about loving Mother Earth and how we can talk to the dead and we can raise the dead.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  And they can walk with us. We just don't see them.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  But God talked to me before I went to the funeral and I was washing my car and crying my eyes out.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  And God said, where you stand up and say something for me if you get asked to speak.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  And I said, yes, Lord, I want everybody to know about this killer drug and I want everybody to know that we better get in prayer.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  Linda, don't hang up. I want you to repeat what you said at your grandson's funeral when we come back.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  Now, don't hang up, Linda. Stay right there. I want to hear what you said there.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  And whether it's at a funeral or whether it's at city council or whether it's the church or whether it's at work, we all need to start being hurt.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  None of us have to reach a million people, but we've all got to reach 10, 20 people a day.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  This is an information war. It's a spiritual war. Linda, sweetheart, stay right there.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  Well, I have fantastic stuff.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  Diet Force is amazing. I'm 45 and I have bits. I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits like under my pack, my belly.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  I'm just taking Diet Force two tablets a day. Man, if you're struggling to get chip shaped for the ladies,
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  mate, Diet Force is the go. You have to get the Diet Force and have two a day and just keep active.

[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020,
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  Alex Jones's InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  This is why they attack us.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  This is why we need your support.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  Join the resistance. Buy products.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  Donate to the cause. Share the links.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  Very thankful with all those wonderful affiliates. Please support them.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  We've got some big guests coming up.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  Stu Peters had been on a while. He's been on fire.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  He's going to cover a ton of big issues with us in the next hour.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  We've got Jim Hoff, the Gateway Punnett, hopping in.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  We'll continue with calls and be hosting the fourth hour today.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  Let's move through your calls quickly as possible,
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  but I want to go back to Linda in Oklahoma who lost her grandson to fentanyl.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  And that's one of my biggest concerns.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  My children, two of them are completely grown up.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  One of them is in high school and another one is five.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  But so many of these drugs out there, like even marijuana,
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  get laced with fentanyl and kill people.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  And everybody knows about that.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  Hundreds of thousands a year. It's getting worse all the time.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  That's why young people can't experiment, folks.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  You don't want to think, oh, let me experiment with marijuana.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  Let me experiment with something else because you don't know.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  And most people getting killed don't even know that they took fentanyl.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  And so I would just tell young people, do not take anything.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  What did you say to your church that God laid on your heart, Linda?
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  I got up. God knew that this woman was going to be there.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  And we all started praying and binding and gagging that spirit.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  So when I got up there, I told them about my car wash experience.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  And I said, I'm here to tell you there was a bunch of drug addicts out there.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  And God wanted to talk to them.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  And I said, if you're doing drugs, or if you've tried it,
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  or if you're thinking about it, I said, call on God. Get down on your knees.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  Go to your car right now. You need God. He can help you through this.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  And I said, Cameron went to every rehab.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  Sometimes they were $20,000 and $30,000 and we've been trying to help him for 16 years.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  And then fentanyl came along and I said, you've got to try God.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  And I was just speaking as a grandmother and I said, you don't want to see,
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  you don't want your grandparents to see you here.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  And God was just pleading with them because I didn't even want to go up there if it was me.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  And I can't remember everything I said because it was God.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  That's beautiful. And I would just say this.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  For anybody thinking about using any drugs, street drugs, you name it,
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  it's like putting a revolver of 357 magnum in your head that has one bullet in it
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  and pulling the trigger and playing Russian roulette.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  Folks, you cannot use any street drugs, period. I know they're everywhere.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  You cannot do it. Drugs are just everywhere now.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  And I've been in hotels and bars and people, you know, the bartenders try to sell me drugs.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  I mean, are you kidding? I mean, A, I wouldn't be taking them anyways.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  But I did experiment some in high school and college.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  Never a lot because it always made me feel so bad.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  But I don't know how anybody takes like methamphetamine or cocaine.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  I've taken both of them a few times.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  You talk about feeling like you were run over by a car the next day.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  But folks, for young people listening, don't ever use any of it.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  And don't go to parties where it's going on because they'll put it in your drink.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  Ma'am, I love you and I appreciate you and you'll hopefully see your grandson in the future.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  God bless you. Hopefully he'll be with us in heaven.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  Kelly in Chicago, thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  Hi, Alex. How are you?
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  I'm pretty bummed out with the World War III and all the fentanyl and it just we're under attack.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  Same, same here.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  So I'm calling because I'm very interested in what Tucker's going to find, what he's going to release.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  I was at January 6th. I was at St. D.C. November, December,
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  hung out with some of your crew outside the Marriott, some of those trips.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  But we, when we went there, my sister and I and some other girls that we were friends with,
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  we went, we went there and we were, you know, walking up to the Capitol.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  We were making our way up there and now I know who it is.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  But Kevin Greason's body was brought down right next to us.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  You there?
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  I'm listening, yes.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  Yeah. So I looked and looked and tried to find for months and months who that was.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  You knew the person was, at that point, you know, we could see clearly he was either deceased at the time or close to it.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  I couldn't find anything on him. It wasn't till about six months ago.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  I'm not sure if it was one of the Epoch Times releases or one of the other ones that finally came out about six months ago,
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  where we were able to actually even learn that this person existed other than what we saw with our own two eyes.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  And I can tell you the spirit of myself who went there and so many others that I spoke with that trip.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  You know, we went with a group of strangers that we met on the previous trip and we were there, you know, to support our president.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  There was no ill will, no bad intentions.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  When we walked up the Capitol, what we saw was something I had never experienced in any other trip to D.C.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  I looked at my sister-in-law and I said, those are not our people.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  Those cannot be our people. People climbing on statues and gas masks with weapons.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  It was not typical of the Trump supporters and the America First group.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  So I'm very interested to see what he uncovered.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  Well, there's tons of footage of patriots trying to stop the people breaking in.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  They tricked a few people to join them, but overall it was feds and it's all coming out.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  I can tell you, I know it's come out in the court. It's been secret.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  And it was being run by the CIA and the FBI. They had sex operatives. They had everything.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  They had a battle plan to attack the Capitol. They were trying to shop around.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  They were trying to set us all up, including myself.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  But I'm just glad, Kelly, that it's all going to be coming out.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  God bless Tucker Carlson and everybody else. Thank you so much, Kelly.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  All right, let's go to Wendy in Alaska. Go ahead, Wendy, you're on the air.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  Well, good morning, Alex. How are you today?
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  I mean, I just love my family and love everybody else. And I can't believe we're already entering World War Three.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  I'm pretty upset.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  Yeah, well, I just want to say thank you to InfoWars, the whole staff, and especially to you for all that you have sacrificed, as well as your family.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  We're pretty heavy duty in Alaska, as far as Alex supporters.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  And I just want to let you know that we love your products. The Winter Son, the X-T-Spray, the Super Blue toothpaste were the gift to all the teenagers for Christmas this year to get them off the junk.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  But I'm calling about a book that we're dealing with in the state of Alaska right now.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  The educational system is trying to incorporate, it's called Let's Talk About It.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  And it's by Erika Mohan, and it's a book basically that relates to adult sex with children, teaching kids how to get on to porn on the Internet, how to do some pretty aggressive and very unnatural things and to accept it and to be glad for it.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  Oh, the head censor at Twitter, remember, defended children getting on homosexual hookup sites. Yeah.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  I mean, they are literally trying to tell children to have sex with adults.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  Now, it's disgusting. We went to the school board, and actually the school board shut down one of the lead speakers because they didn't want to hear about it.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  Basically told them to just walk out the door.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  So my other topic basically is, you know, up in Alaska, we have limited information along the Aleutian chain.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  And I think, you know, we look at the borders with that crazy Newsom in California, you got that Hobbs in Arizona, and up here with Trudeau, you know, were basically wide open.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  It's a perfect triad for World War III, and we're all sitting ducks off the Aleutian chain.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  We have head sightings of ships that are not American ships, and people up here are pretty concerned.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  Absolutely. You're on the front lines of this thing goes nuclear with Russia.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  But what you mentioned is big news.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  Alaska board members brawl over silencing dad exposing book on kinks and sexting.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  I'm going to interrupt you. So they won't let the parents read what's in the book.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  They just give it to your sixth and seventh graders. This is sick.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  These people are evil beyond belief, corrupting our children. Thank you, Wendy.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  All right, we got a bunch of other calls. I'll get to you all.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  But we got Jim Hopp, a gateway pundit, giving us a little prelude on what's going to be coming out with this big Tucker Carlson situation where he has gotten the January 6th footage.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  It's really just incredible.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTour.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:59.000]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTour.com, our fighting problems will be over. Please take action now.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:12.000]  The cavalry has arrived. Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken-based bone broth they're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  But more importantly, your immune system. Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with chaka mushroom and a whole bunch of other ingredients like turmeric, the list goes on and on.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  This is definitely the strongest, best bone broth out there and your purchase supports the InfoWare 360 win.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  If you've not experienced bone broth and even the regular ones have great effects, believe me, you want to get InfoWarsLife Ultimate Bone Broth at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  Now, it'll take an hour to tell you all the great stuff about it. Just go to InfoWarsTour.com, read the facts there and then order some and you can't lose.

[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  So, Ultimate Bone Broth, now back at stock at InfoWarsTour.com for 25% off.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:10.000]  There is a war on for your mind. Your mind is a battlefield. This is an information war. InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:30.000]  But we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products that empower you and your immune system and your family as well.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:35.000]  You can also make straight donations at InfoWarsTour.com, clicking on the big red banner, a one-time recurring.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  But I'm asking you to take action. We're non-violent. But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally non-violently politically punching the New World Order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  We are going to defeat the New World Order. We're going over the top. But right now is a critical juncture. So please go to InfoWarsTour.com and donate now.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  InfoWars is winning. InfoWars is reaching more people than ever. We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true. They told you we were going to be shut down. They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars. None of that's true. It's all being appealed.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:24.000]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead. But if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win. Don't let the globalist sigh up you and your family.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  Go to InfoWarsTour.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts. You name it.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  They fund the InfoWars and empower your life and let the globalists know their sigh up has not worked. Thanks for keeping us on the air. Take action at infowarstore.com today.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  Because the only people that can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners. The majority of you have not been sigh up.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:07.000]  But some of you have. Do not let the globalist brainwash you. Go to InfoWarsTour.com and keep us on the air.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  The Resistance, live from Austin, Texas. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  TheGatewayPunda.com, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, James O'Keefe. You can really count on one hand who the real fighters are.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  And it's you, the viewers and listeners that make it all possible. We've got some really bad news. We knew it was coming.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  It was a lie that James O'Keefe resigned. It was put out yesterday by the board, it looks like. James O'Keefe has been removed.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  He's been fired from the organization he founded and led for eating someone's sandwich. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, eating someone's sandwich and he yelled at someone once.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  So there you go. And they're threatening to criminally indict people. The last straw was that coup when he exposed Pfizer, head of mRNA.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  InfoWars doesn't have a board. InfoWars has you, the listeners, and I'm the leader of InfoWars.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  My board is the listeners and viewers of the show. If you decide to buy products at InfoWarsTour.com, we stay on air.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  If you decide not to get the products, we go off air. And we're barely in the black right now. I'd like to expand.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  I don't want to just tread water here. So please go to InfoWarsTour. We have great products that enrich your life.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  Our ultimate bone broth is finally back in stock. Our prebiotics back in stock. They're both massively discounted 40% off.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  We've got the best CBD oil that's so good for your body, your brain, your joints, your bones, and more.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  Highest quality at less than half the price. It's sold in stores. Our nitric oxide is the best.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  All the products are great. InfoWarsTour.com. Brainforce Plus and Brainforce Ultra, great new tropics.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  They're both 50% off right now as well. Take action. Go to InfoWarsTour.com today so we don't suffer the same fate as James will keep.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  I've been talking to James some off air. I'm going to leave it at that. And we'll probably get him on here very, very soon.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  But he's getting ready to make some big moves. But this is outrageous and disgusting.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  Now we go now to Jim Hoff, the founder of Gateway Pundit.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  What I can say is the most prolific, patriot, populist organization in the world. Without them, we'd be up the creek without a paddle.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  I know their deep research in January 6th has been critical to Tucker Carlson's in-depth research.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  So I want to just cover the waterfront here. Hey, James O'Keith and Veritas. Now serious this is.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  Your view on that is this is just now breaking one of our great colleagues, one of our peers here.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  I wish we had more peers, but we don't. A lot of great people, but nobody's reached this level in it.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  And that's not bragging. It means we're under attack, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  We need your support. We're under globalist bombardment because we are the most effective.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  And then I want to obviously get into the big January 6th developments.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  Tucker Carlson we now learn has been given the January 6th footage or is being allowed to go through it by McCarthy.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  I know he's hot on the trail. I've got a lot of inside baseball on what's happening in the January 6th trial.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  The Proud Boys. I know Hoff is all over it as well. It has the same sources.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  CIA operatives, CIA sex operatives. It looks like just incredible information.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  So Jim Hoff, thegatewaypundit.com. Thanks for being here, sir.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  Please go ahead and give us your views on Veritas on the January 6th information coming on and so much more.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  Good morning, Alex. Great to be with you on the Info Wars crowd.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  I think this news about James O'Keeffe is tragic. I don't know how Project Veritas is going to have the same feel.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  It's going to be able to put out the same products, the excellence in reporting that they've had without James O'Keeffe.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  I think they might be fooling themselves. I'm really looking forward to what you just teased and that is James may have an announcement on his future.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  I don't think James O'Keeffe is going away. And what he has done to help expose so much in this country, the guy deserves a medal.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  Instead, we have Joe Biden giving medals to people like Ruby and Shay from Georgia, election workers there and different people.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  And yet, James O'Keeffe is the one who really is saving this country. So, you know, I totally support James.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  I've known him for, you know, a dozen years. Like you, I think he's phenomenal.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  And I look forward to more work by James O'Keeffe. And as far as Project Veritas, I don't know how they feel that huge hole that James will leave behind.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  Well, the evidence is overwhelming. The FBI was putting pressure on the board threats of indictments and now they've choked.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  I know O'Keeffe deserves a medal not to be indicted. They've already tried to arrest him in indicted one other time, supposedly for wiretapping, which wasn't true.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  Now getting into January 6th, nobody's been on this like Gateway Pundit other than Tucker Carlson.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  We've obviously been very close to it. They've been trying to put me in jail. They're trying to put two of my crew members in jail for just being outside the Capitol as well.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  I know you've got some of the same sources, but man, this Proud Boys trial, so much is coming out.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  You wrote a great report. The 15 points that prove it was an inside false flag operation.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  Give us a little prelude on what you're working on and what you make of this development that Tucker Carlson has been given access to the 42,000 hours of footage.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  Well, I'm glad that it's coming out over the weekend. We saw a couple of reports that Kevin McCarthy was going to renege on what he had promised, and I'm glad that that isn't the case.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  And so I'm very excited to hear and to see some of this footage. I suspect that McCarthy will release it publicly.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  I believe that he has the duty to do that, and I know that Gateway Pundit, we will be looking forward to finding and scouring through all of that footage.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  I think, Alex, and I know that you'll agree with this, and that is that the more that we look at January 6, and by the way, I was sitting with an arms reach from you on January 6 at the Ellipse before people marched over to the U.S.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  Capitol. And I'd never seen a larger crowd in my life. There was a million people there, at least I would estimate.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  It went as far as I could see. Everyone was peaceful like every Trump rally. Everyone was peaceful.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  We were very hopeful that day. Unfortunately, it did not turn out the way that we had planned. It did not turn out the way that Mike Pitts had promised us just within 48 hours beforehand.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  And so we saw what happened later on. But you know, Alex, the more we look into this, the more people we talk to, it appears that this was a planned, organized, coordinated event to attack the American people.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  And the violence was started by the police who started firing rubber bullets and then firing off these gas canisters into the crowd.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  We now have footage that we're going to be putting up. One of these canisters, you know, people are getting a little more bold now.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  They're sending us some stuff. A canister exploding right on somebody's, you know, right next to them.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  That's right. A lot of the victims of January 6th have been afraid to speak out because of the persecution.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  And look at how the January 6th Commission came out and tried to seal it for 20-plus years.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  They've got to be really concerned right now because just the footage you and others dug up shows Ray Epps not just calling for an attack, but helping Ram signs over the police and into the structure.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  So they have got to be really concerned right now.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  I think you're absolutely right, Alex. They should be scared unless this Cheney is probably the one who's most upset because the truth is going to come out.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  And again, like I was saying, this was all premeditated. This was a coordinated attack on the American people.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  We have the evidence now. We're going to see more evidence coming forward.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  Now, we posted something last week on that Proud Boy trial that's going on and how Tario, the leader of the Proud Boys, was approached by this woman who says that she says now that this FBI-trained,
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  FBI CIA-trained agent had told her to send this footage to Tario and make sure that he got it.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  Well, she sent it to him and now we know that this guy was working, I believe, as a Fed, certainly was trained as a Fed that he admits to.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  And so this is, again, another setup before that day.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  It's really horrible, Alex, to see that this is what our government has been doing.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  I know you've been shouting this from the rooftops for years, but now we're really seeing this government was attacking its own people.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  And the disgrace is that these gentlemen and women who go to trial in D.C. who were there that day, they're getting the book thrown at them for things like walking inside the Capitol.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  And I know you and the fact that you were outside that day. You didn't even go in. You were telling people to be calm, and yet here they come and harass you and your staff.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  It's really horrible what we witnessed.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  And Ray Epps has never... We can turn it around.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  That's right, Ray Epps testified at the committee that he, quote, orchestrated it.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  But he's not been arrested like Owen Schreuer and Sam Won't Tell You.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  Let's come back to more about this with the one and only Jim Hoff, The GatewayPundit.com.

[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with a globalist.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason you've had the success.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight,
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out, and to intensify them.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now,
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  because we are over the target, and this victory is happening.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform,
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted, because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  So go check out the store, go support their store, go support InfoWars, leave a donation right now.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  Don't wait until they're gone.

[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  you are literally non-violently politically punching the New World Order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose.

[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:23.000]  All right, Jim Hoft is our guest, ladies and gentlemen, thegatewaypundit.com.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  Another big guest coming up next hour, your phone calls, and more.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  He wrote an excellent article, a boil down at thegatewaypundit.com, thegatewaypundit.com.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  Fifteen facts on the dozens of federal operatives that infiltrated the Trump crowds on January 6th and the U.S. Capitol.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  And I've been told by people inside the trial, I'll leave it at that, the judge kicks everybody out,
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  has these in-chamber meetings, also runs a white noise machine up at the judge's platform where you can't hear
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  and then tells the lawyers and people, you can't bring up the federal informants,
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  you can't bring up the police with badges, you can't bring up the CIA people or the anti-terrorism teams that were there.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  You can't bring any of that up, but then they'll let information from informants come out by the prosecution,
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  but not the informants like the one that was driving the car that took Enrique Tarrio to the parking garage meeting
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  with Stuart Rhodes and the Oathkeepers.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  That individual and others have testified in the reports that they saw no plans to attack the Capitol,
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  but the judge is keeping that out. This is a rigged kangaroo trial and it looks like D.C. is their special star chamber facility, Jim.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  Yeah, absolutely. It's heartbreaking to see that this is happening.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  There's no justice being served and like you said, it's a kangaroo court and these men are just like sheep to slaughter.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  It's disgusting. I don't know how these people sleep at night, these judges, these prosecutors,
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  but they're destroying so many lives across the country. They just don't care.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  We're not dealing with very good people here, Alex. They're just not very good people.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  Gut level. What do you think happens, because we're already in the footage we have as bombshell,
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  when Tucker gets all the HD footage and the public gets, we were talking during the break,
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  just like, you agree with me, just like WikiLeaks, when they released 50,000 pages or 100,000 emails or 200,000 emails,
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  there's no way one organization or one Matt Taibbi can take all the Twitter files and decide what to put out for Elon Musk.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  I mean, it's something, but really it's close to nothing instead of just releasing the Twitter files,
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  releasing the 42,000 hours. That's the only way we get to the bottom of it, because then hundreds of thousands of people will go download it,
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  they'll pour over it, and we will get major results.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  Yeah, I believe you're right, Alex. And I think the biggest news to come out of this document drop will be after Kevin McCarthy releases it publicly.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  I think Tucker will be able to find some things, but you know, one person just can't go through that many hours worth of footage.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  But I'm looking forward to it. I think what Americans need to be looking for is why did the violence start? Who started the violence?
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  Why was there no police saying, you know, leave the area or get arrested? There was no warning, they just started firing.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  I think that's going to be pivotal. I think Americans need to see that.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  And I think these people from that J6 committee need to be publicly shamed for the lies that they've been spreading for several years.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  I hope people never forget the lies that they told the American public.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  This Democrat Party, including Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, after the truth finally is released.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  And Jim, here's the key for me. I know you know that you write about it constantly.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  They have branded the American people in any opposition as terrorists off of January 6th and any Trump supporters as terrorists.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  So they're hanging their hat on this fraud. That's why it's so important to take down.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  Our listeners write me, they email me, they say, why are you covering January 6th? We know it was staged.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  Okay, well, the audience here and Gateway Pundit readers know it, but the general public still doesn't fully get it.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  Sure, in polls, like 6% of Americans think it's important.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  It's something like 80-something percent, you know, are against the war or think inflation is bad.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  The American people get it, but they don't understand we're all being branded as terrorists based on this fraud.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  We've got to bring this lie down.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  You know, a great example of that too, Alex, and I agree with you 100% is the fact that Americans,
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  if you asked most Americans about that day, they would say maybe five police officers were killed that day
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  because we have the president of the United States and Democrats spreading that lie continuously to this day.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  Of course, every bit of that is a lie. Not one police officer died that day.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  Officer Sicknick, of course, died the following day from a stroke, and then they're trying to say
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  that these other policemen who committed suicide months later somehow did that because of January 6th.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  We have no proof of that at all. Neither do they.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  There were four individuals who did die that day. They were all Trump supporters.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  And, you know, we put up a video this past weekend, too, of this woman, Victoria White, who was there.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  She's from Minnesota, you know, lower middle class, real sweet lady.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  She went there, she got pushed in this tunnel, and they beat the living hell out of her.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  You know, there's one cop, and we identified him in our report.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  He beat her with his bare fist for like 40 times with a stick and a fist right in her face.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  We showed this horrific video of her as right before they paraded her away, then her shoes were knocked off,
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  her coat was lost, and then they beat the hell out of her and drag her through the U.S. Capitol.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  She didn't get out of jail till later that night. You know, she's not the criminal here.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  This cop is a criminal. How dare he do that to anyone, let alone a woman, beat the living hell out of her
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  when she just got pushed in this tunnel. She had no idea what was going on.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  It's really a horrible story, and there's several stories like that.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  I bet we see more of that as this footage is released.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  Big picture. What do you make of the deep state, the war in Ukraine, just the behavior of the Democrats?
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  They're just going more and more insane by the minute. What concerns you most when you go to bed at night?
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  You know, the fact that we have Joe Biden as president and Mark Milley leading the Pentagon is frightening.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  These clowns don't even don't have any idea what's going on.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  We have Milley, of course, calling China and warning them if we do anything.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  You know, whose side is he on? How come this guy hasn't been court-martialed, and yet he's still leading our troops
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  after they lost and surrendered to the Taliban and armed them with $80 billion worth of U.S. weapons?
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  In fact, Alex, we put something up this weekend on the Gateway Pundit where they're now training pilots over there.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  Americans laugh, ha-ha-ha, they don't have shoes, right? The elites laugh about that. Well, they're training these shoeless pilots
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  to run the helicopters that Mark Milley left there in Afghanistan after we pulled out.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  It's such a disgrace, such a disaster. We see also, one more point quickly, Jimmy Carter, they named a building after Jimmy Carter.
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  They took the previous name off of this building at the Naval Academy. It was named after the founder of Oceanography,
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  his, you know, patriotic American, who also happened to be a Confederate general.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  So they removed his name from Jimmy Carter on there. Think of Jimmy Carter.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  We have Iran today because of Jimmy Carter. We have the Mullahs in charge and wreaking havoc across the world,
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  not just the Middle East, but we saw them bomb down in Argentina years ago.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  This is Jimmy Carter's, you know, legacy, and now they're naming military buildings after him.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  Nothing makes sense, Alex. Nothing.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  Well, that's right. They always say it was Reagan that armed the Taliban.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  It was actually Jimmy Carter. It was the Big New Brzezinski that started all that.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  Reagan adopted that after, and I think that was probably not a good idea.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  But, I mean, Jimmy Carter was super bad news.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  Absolutely. And, you know, the priorities of this administration, I think, you know, Joe Biden, though,
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  and Jimmy Carter makes, you know, or Joe Biden makes Jimmy Carter look like some kind of saint.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  Joe Biden is a complete disaster. Do we want him to lead World War III for America?
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  I don't think so. I don't think so.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  In the time we have left, Jim Hoft, we've talked probably about this, and I concur with what you said.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  Can you repeat what you said during the break about this whole split between Trump and DeSantis and how we should deal with that?
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  Well, I'll tell you one thing, and we, of course, didn't have a primary in 2020, but we did in 2016.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  I know that you were always pro-Trump, so were we, but those primaries get pretty vicious in the Republican side.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  There's a lot of people who really get some heated emotions.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  We put up something last week about DeSantis, and George Sorrell said some things about him that were pretty flattering
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  compared to what he said about Trump, and we just got viciously attacked.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  I don't look forward to a primary between Trump and DeSantis at all, and I think it's going to be really difficult for the party.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  But I think the real foe that we have to worry about is election fraud still.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  I think, as I told you during the break, Democrats could run John Federman from his hospital bed,
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  and he would still beat the Republican if they don't figure out this fraud, because that's the real enemy of the country.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  We have to get that figured out to save this country.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  Is it Federman and Biden emblematic of the rot of the Democratic Party that they both can barely talk?
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  Federman's in the hospital with depression, and they almost killed him running him, and they just don't care?
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  Yeah, they don't care at all.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  I liked his wife's statement, like, yeah, we're going to make sure he gets some rest.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  Well, she didn't feel that way after he had that stroke, because she pushed him out on the campaign trail.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  And, you know, I don't believe that Pennsylvania voters are that stupid to nominate somebody who can't even think to be their senator.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  And what you said during the break was, Trump and DeSantis shouldn't be fighting with each other.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  If they don't fix the election fraud, it's not going to matter.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  That's totally it.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  That's the real enemy, and we have to get that figured out, or this country's lost, and you know it, Alex.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  Well, thegatewaypundit.com, and you're on the trail. We're on the trail. Tucker's on the trail. Cannot wait to see what Tucker puts out with the January 6 motherload.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Thank you so much, Jim Hoff.

[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  All right, thank you, sir. Wow. All right.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  I'm going to jam in a few phone calls when we come back, and then Stu Peters is loaded for bear with a whole bunch of big key topics.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  He's going to be covering coming up here very soon.

[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  The cavalry has arrived.

[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  And I won't ever take you back.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  Let's just go fishing and listen to George Strait. How's that sound?
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  Girl, you remember him.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  To the mushroom clouds will start.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  We'll release a new bio weapon.
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  So we can't.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  I don't love you.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  We've got to fight.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  And I fueled by that.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  I got some motions for unproperty.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  Texas Roughneck in Texas. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  Hey, Alex. We were talking.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  You were mentioning January 6th.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  And I'm just afraid after two years, they've had too much time to do like a Steve Mnuchin production and frame it or even make new video and say it happened on January 6th, putting Patriots in a bad life and how that relates to UK and what you had suggested about them being the hub of the New World Order.
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  Yeah, I think with 41,000 hours of footage, most of those Capitol Police aren't corrupt. They're just brainwashed.
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  They would have too much trouble going in and then deleting stuff.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  They might delete some stuff over that time.
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  I don't think they're going to produce fake stuff and put it on there.
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  Well, and it's when you said that UK was the hub of New World Order.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  I kind of disagree with you.
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  I think, you know, Gregory's did a good report on revelation of the method.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  And, you know, the UK wasn't the ones who canceled Kanye's bank accounts or all of his contracts, all in unison, working together to censor a certain amount of information.
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  If you look at Israel's Supreme Court building, that kind of identifies where the hub of the New World Order is.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  Yeah, sure. It's a big, big pyramid.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  Well, who founded Israel, the modern state of Israel, the Rothschilds?
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  Everybody fights over this group or that group. I'm saying the propaganda, the brainwashing, the development, the British Empire never went away.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  It merged with the American Empire. Israel is a big part of that. The Vatican is a big part of that.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  So I'm not saying Israel is involved in some stuff. You're totally missing my point.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  I'm talking about the city of London within London. That is the admitted financial center of the planet, sir.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  Is that where the bank was that canceled all those accounts and are continually to cancel Patriot accounts?
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  Canada was canceling the truckers' accounts. Canada was doing the same thing.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  See, you want to disagree with me, and I'm not even disagreeing with you, and I really appreciate you.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  Texas, Roughneck, you're not listening to me. You're not listening. It's a global system.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  I'm saying that the – do you understand that the Balfour Agreement, that the UK created Israel, do you understand that?
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  Yes, with the Rothschilds.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  Well, I've just said.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  Yeah, that's what you said.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  I appreciate your call. It's just like people fetishize saying Israel runs everything.
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  And I'm not disagreeing that Israel isn't a big part of the New World Order. There's a lot of good people over there.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  But look how they made them take all the experimental shots, and Netanyahu said they're getting pigs that he basically owns, and it's terrible.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  But I'm explaining to you that the transhumanist stuff, the trans-movement, the whole eugenics operation, Galton in the 1850s,
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  I'm saying the banning of the books, I'm saying China is the big testing ground for the New World Order for the social credit score and all the rest of it.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  I'm not saying China runs the world.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  I'm saying China is the big New World Order economic military army they're using to take over.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  When I say China owns four of the six big Hollywood production houses, I'm not saying they run them.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  I'm saying they own them.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  So every time I talk about China, hey, you don't talk about China. Israel is real.
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  It's like, it just blows me away that people just think that they just magically say something about Israel that does something,
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  that I'm here agreeing with you basically, and then you think that you keep going back.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  Yes, the world financial system, the social credit score system is being run out of Frankfurt, London, and New York City.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  And you're sitting there bashing Israel, well, the people that run Israel run New York as well.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  It's the same global combines and I'm agreeing with you and you won't let me do that because it feels too good to get Alex and say,
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  man, you didn't tell the big dirty secret.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000]  And it's just bizarre.
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  Who brought Kanye West in here?
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  Dodo Bird.
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  All right, I'm not mad at you.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  It's just very frustrating.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  Here's the 60 seconds.
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  Well, I have fantastic stuff.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000]  Diet Force.
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.000]  Diet Force is amazing. I'm 45 and I have bits.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  Under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking Diet Force two tablets a day.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  And if you're struggling to get chip shapes for the ladies,
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  mate, Diet Force is the go.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:31.000]  You have to get the Diet Force and have it to a day and just keep acting.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  X7 Diet Force.

[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  God bless Australia.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000]  Come to our store.com.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000]  Let's get it now.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.000]  It's a CIA that manipulates the news in the United States.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000]  And left the children to die on the cold floor.
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  It was almost as if it were a plant in a bush.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:31.000]  It's got tanks in it.
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000]  You need to go into the capital!
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000]  They are nothing but distract.
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000]  You silenced those voices.
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.000]  What we want to do in Davos is push to reset button.
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:50.000]  But as soon as we start exposing the great preset,
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:54.000]  the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  Popular talk show host Stu Peters is our guest for the hour.
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  StuPeters.com needs no introduction.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000]  Top is where we're getting into his development of the bio weapon,
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  how our own government has used COVID, food plant fires,
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:17.000]  trendy elements, open war on American cities.
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  We live in an empire of lies.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000]  StuPeters, great to have you.
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000]  When I saw the first topic you wanted to get into,
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  I thought of all the hype of the Marburg virus.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.000]  By the UN saying 90% of those who get infected die.
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000]  Imagine the hysteria we saw when something as dangerous as the flu
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  with COVID was something that actually kills 90% of people.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000]  I think that's an exaggeration, but that's what they're saying.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  I think it's pretty clear COVID was a beta test.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000]  They're getting ready for something new.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  Stu, great to have you with us.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000]  Yeah, thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.000]  There's no doubt that 100% of what you just articulated is true.
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  I mean, we have an empire of lies, a fake government,
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000]  a corporate government crime syndicate that has openly declared
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000]  bio warfare on its own citizens.
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000]  And one of the most alarming things is, you know,
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.000]  by omission, the criminal press has completely led people
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000]  to their own slaughter.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000]  And this is like world governments are all in lockstep together
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000]  working to accomplish this.
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.000]  Remember the lies that we were told about COVID-19.
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  We were told lies about spreading and infection.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  We were told lies about masking.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000]  We were told lies about safe and effective vaccines.
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:23.000]  We were told lies about the pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  We were told lies about, you know, hospitals caring for patients,
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.000]  how we couldn't be around grandma and grandpa in the nursing homes.
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:33.000]  We couldn't be next to our loved ones in the hospitals
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  who walked in under their own horsepower,
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000]  who were otherwise perfectly healthy people
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  and reported the sniffles or a cough before anybody knew
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  what this COVID-19 thing was all about.
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000]  We were led to our own slaughter
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  as they were given this deadly remdesivir protocol,
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000]  this venomous product that goes through your veins
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  and courses through causing renal failure.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  It failed an African Ebola trial.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  Tony Fauci knew that.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  He was responsible for getting it into the Ebola trial.
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  The NIH dictated this one single treatment
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  to every hospital facility here
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  and then threatened doctors that if they didn't use this protocol,
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  well, guess what? They were going to lose their licenses.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  So they coerced the doctors.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  They coerced everybody in big corporate America,
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000]  all of the globalist conglomerates.
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  The NFL is a great example.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  You know, they report what, nearly 100% of the players and personnel
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  for these teams are injected with this bioweapon.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  And then, boom, all of a sudden, as, you know, programs like yours
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  and ours start to dig into this,
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  we have people coming forward with patents
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  and all of this was actually developed.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  This is, they tell you right here,
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  this is a pegalated lipid nanoparticle.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.000]  This weapon of biowarfare, according to their patents,
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  and this isn't just some arbitrary patent.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  This is a patent that was used across every single COVID injection,
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000]  vaccine that they told you was safe and effective.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  This instructs your body to produce billions of spike proteins,
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  billions of venomous peptides that course through your veins
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  and cause all kinds of autoimmune deficiencies
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  and antibody-dependent enhancement and guion beret and myocarditis.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  Every single one of these symptoms is listed as the effect,
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  as the adverse event or side effect,
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  we believe in tended consequences of a bioweapon
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  that they unleashed on the world.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  And nobody's talking about it.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  Not one person's talking about it.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  Similar to the same way it took 10 days for the criminal press
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  to talk about how this government
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  churnobled a city in Ohio, East Palestine, Ohio.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  I mean, this is accountability.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  We have to move to the accountability phase right now, I believe.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  And the first people that we should focus on are the press,
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  who have led people directly to their deaths.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  Well, as Trump says, the mainstream media is the enemy of the people.
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  They're totally discredited.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  All the polls show they have less than a 10% approval rating,
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  but they're a zombie organization.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  They're funded by the big banks. They don't stop.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  Pulling back to the million-foot view here,
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  with the open borders and the fentanyl and the pedophilia
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  and the world government being announced,
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  Elon Musk is crying and the war in Russia is spiraling out of control.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  And just all of this together,
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  how would you describe the world today
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  and how would you describe how it's going for the New World Order?
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  For Team Demon versus Team Freedom,
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  if this was a football game at halftime, what's going on?
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  Well, we're getting crushed, and the reason why we're getting crushed
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  is because of the lack of unification.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  There's factions inside of every single quote movement,
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  the health freedom movement, the Republican Party.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  There's factions inside of specific factions like MAGA.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  There's the gay MAGA versus the straight MAGA,
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  and there's Catholics versus Protestants and Jews.
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  And I mean, this is an attempt to divide everybody,
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  and they're doing it successfully.
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  This is Agenda 2030. We're watching it happen right in front of us.
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  This is one world government, world domination.
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  Consider testimony that was given by a former secret agent
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  of an operation called Men in Black who said,
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  look, gave testimony saying, there's going to be an alien invasion.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  And in this alien invasion, people across the globe
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  are going to see, you know, hundreds or thousands of...
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  holograms, and that the attack, in fact, won't come from these holograms,
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  but will come from actual warplanes of governments around the world,
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  including the United States of America,
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000]  which then forces a one-world government that nobody will resist.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  Everybody will be dependent on this one-world government
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  in order to save us, to take care of us.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000]  This is the man riding in on the white horse to save us type thing.
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  Everybody's waiting. They've chilled patriotism.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  They've completely stomped over the Constitution,
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence,
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  the Geneva War conventions.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000]  You talked about Ukraine and Russia, for example.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  We're coming up this Friday on the one-year anniversary
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  of the alleged, you know, warmongering boogeyman, Vladimir Putin,
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  just violently deciding he was going to wake up one day
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  and be a war criminal and go invade some innocent country.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  What's really happening in Ukraine?
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  Well, Victoria Newland tells us directly, right in front of Marco Rubio,
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  who's asking her a question and almost had to go shut her up
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  because she was going to tell us all, everything,
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  dozens of bio weapons laboratories being hidden in Ukraine.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  This is the same government that paid millions,
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  maybe even hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  to Hunter Biden and the Biden crime family
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  through a false and fraudulent energy company called Barisma.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  And now Biden, that's what I wanted to ask you next.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  Now Biden's over there.
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  When we pull back from this,
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  and you have Biden eight months ago saying,
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  we can't send Abrams tanks. That'll be World War III.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  Now he's sent the Abrams tanks. They're now going into combat.
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  What changed the power structure from eight months ago
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.000]  where they said we can't send Abrams tanks to now?
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  They're sending heavier and heavier advanced weapons.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  Well, these corrupt fossils in our uniparty fake government,
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  these war mongers in the D.C. Beltway,
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  have to figure out a way to enrich themselves
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000]  to the military industrial complex.
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  Look, I mean, Alex, you're very well versed in how these wars go.
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  I mean, look back all the way to the lies that got us into Iraq,
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  weapons of mass destruction.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  And then, you know, Saddam Hussein ties to al-Qaeda.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  Whoops, spoiler alert. All that turned out to be fake.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  There were no WMDs.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  Those ties to al-Qaeda were all fake.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  So then it became about, you know, spreading democracy.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  The same thing happened with Obama's red line in Syria.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  The same thing happened to get us involved in Libya.
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  We had Benghazi lies after lies.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  Just cover this up.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  And now you mentioned the pedophilia, Kabbal.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  They've got a lot of bodies to hide in Ukraine.
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  And those people, if you go to the Donbass right now,
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  what do you see there? You see mass graves.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  This happened under Zelensky's leadership.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  Who is Zelensky?
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  I mean, the guy that wears high heels and leather
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  closely tied to the very same people
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  who are right at the epicenter of the elites right here.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  40 million dollar mansions in Miami.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  This is an actor. This is all theatrics
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  to distract away what's actually happening right now,
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  which is that your government has been hijacked
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  via Marxist coup d'etat
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  by some illegitimate force that is controlling
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  what you're seeing happen in the White House right now.
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  There's a reason why they do all their broadcasts
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  from a fake movie set.
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  Nobody has any idea what the power structure is right now,
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  or who's actually pulling the strings.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  Well, you're right. Let's talk about that when we come back.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:21.000]  Let's do Peters here on this Monday edition of the Alex Jones show.
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  Because the globalists really are at war with humanity.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  They're at war with the Russians. They're at war with the Americans.
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  They're at war with productivity, with prosperity,
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000]  with common sense, with logic.
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  What is the end game? How do we stop it?
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  How do we defeat it?
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  I'm going to look at the attacks on the infrastructure
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  and so much more with stoopeders and stoopeders.com
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  and on Twitter at Real Stoopeders.
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, the only way this transmission gets out
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  is you share the links from band.video
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  and infowars.com for its last show.
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  And conspiracyfact.info
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  is a link that's not been censored yet.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  Conspiracyfact.info will be right back.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  Infowars secret weapon is finally here.
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system,
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life,
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  for your libido.
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  And it also keeps infowars on the air.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  And I almost forgot,
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  you save at least 50%
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000]  on these products
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000]  for what you pay for similar products
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  That's because we go right to the highest quality
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000]  manufacturer in the nation
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  that supplies some of the top names.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  They then give us the best deal out there
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  because the owners of Listener are able to bring it to you
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  with massive discounts.
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000]  You're not going to find 1,000mg high quality CBD
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000]  for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  You're not going to find at the 10mg
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  or the 20mg, you're not going to find
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000]  tumor at 95% or humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000]  You're not going to find any of this
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000]  anywhere near that.
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000]  These similar formulas with the same formulas
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000]  sell for up to 200% more
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000]  than we're selling these.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  Infowars MD now available exclusively
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  at infowarsstore.com
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  $361.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  writers and satirist in
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  MISE
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000]  famously said more than 150 years ago
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  rumors of his demise
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000]  had been greatly exaggerated
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  because the newspapers kept saying he died
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000]  decades before he did die
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000]  and it's the same PSYOP today.
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000]  Infowars is more influential
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000]  and more powerful than ever because of your support
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  and because of the facts of what we've covered
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  coming true.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000]  if they can convince you that we're going away
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  and you stop supporting
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  you stop spreading the word then they do win.
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  of people that can shut down Infowars
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  and that's you the viewers and listeners.
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  If you decide to go to
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  infowarsstore.com and get supplements and books
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000]  and films and t-shirts and so much more
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  It is all in your hands.
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  If you want to support stand up against the globalists
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  go to infowarsstore.com right now
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  and keep us on air. It's up to you.
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  We're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  This is very important.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  The spike protein is loaded in the body
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000]  with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  people are lower with the spike protein.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000]  They don't feel well. This is a potential solution.
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  Hydroxychloroquine comes
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  from a natural substance.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  Isn't it interesting
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  natural substances in a sense
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  combating this man-made disaster
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000]  SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000]  OnlineHealthNow.com
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  Thank you for your support
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000]  and thank you for getting into that
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  because it's important. You didn't come here to do that
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  but I made you do it.
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000]  You want to beat the new world order?
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  Well so do I.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  And I've been the most effective individual
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  in the fight against the globalist
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  But ladies and gentlemen
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  I can't do it without your support.
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  And the good news is
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000]  But I'm not going to back down
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000]  and I'll never give up but I could give out.
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  So please keep me on the field.
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000]  while getting great products at the same time
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  that will empower you and your family.

[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  towards the fight not part of it going towards product cost.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  But I thank you all for your support

[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  The globalists are counting on you
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000]  not taking action.
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000]  of the New World Order
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000]  You know
[02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000]  I've reached a surreal moment here
[02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000]  as a father
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000]  and as someone that loves my family
[02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  means I love everybody else
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000]  as we all live on this planet together
[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000]  where I'm just beyond angry at these people.
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000]  You have Joe Biden saying
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000]  if we send heavy battle tanks into the world war three
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000]  it escalates into that
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000]  and then now he's doing it
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000]  and then he's doing it
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000]  and then he's doing it
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000]  and then he's doing it
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000]  and it escalates into that
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000]  and then now he's doing it
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000]  and they just sit back and laugh
[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000]  they have vogue photo shoots with Zelensky
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000]  and he dances around
[02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000]  like a woman in high heels wearing leather
[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000]  and it's all just a sick end of days
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000]  feeling
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000]  but then I get hope I don't trust him much
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000]  but Elon Musk addresses the World Government Summit
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000]  says your world government will collapse civilization
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  here's Biden with the tank comment
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000]  I know it's a month old but it's important
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000]  The idea
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000]  that we're going to send in offensive equipment
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000]  and have planes and tanks and trains
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000]  going in with American pilots
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000]  and American crews
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000]  just understand
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000]  and don't kid yourself no matter what you all say
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:17.000]  that's called World War Three
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000]  okay?
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000]  And now Stu Peters as you know
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  the new Defense Minister
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000]  over in Ukraine today said
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000]  will invade Russia and capture Moscow
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000]  and put our tanks
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000]  in Red Square
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  why would they make such insane provocative statements
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  why a few months ago with Zelensky fire missiles
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  it looks like on purpose
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000]  into Poland and instantly call for nuclear war
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000]  what is going on with these people
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000]  Stu Peters in your view
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000]  they're desperate to bury bodies
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000]  they have to
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000]  absolutely have to seal the deal
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000]  with World War Three in order to have
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000]  enough chaos all over to affect
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000]  the 2030 agenda
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000]  whether they have to fake it with fake Chinese
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000]  spy balloons that
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000]  embarrassingly fly over our country
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000]  while meanwhile an article from just three years ago
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000]  says hey the United States government
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000]  the military apparatus is going to be testing
[02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000]  spy balloons and we're going to be launching them
[02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000]  from South Dakota over the Midwest
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000]  and making their final into Illinois
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000]  as you look around at what's happening with Russia
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000]  and Ukraine
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000]  why is it that we're supposed to believe
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000]  that Vladimir Putin just by sheer numbers
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000]  let's just talk about straight facts here
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000]  without injecting any feelings or subjection
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000]  what so ever
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000]  Vladimir Putin has access to about a million troops
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000]  active duty
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000]  he's got another 2.04 million
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000]  in reserves
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000]  he's got a navy, he's got an air force
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000]  ostensibly he has intercontinental ballistic warheads
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000]  he could take care
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000]  of Ukraine if he really wanted to conquer them
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000]  in a mission that lasts approximately
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000]  20 minutes I mean why not just drop
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000]  one big bomb over the top of Ukraine
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000]  and just turn it into glass
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000]  and just obliterate everything
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000]  why is it taking so long
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000]  why is he strategically targeting
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  specific sites
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000]  why does he have high value targets versus low
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000]  why did Vladimir Putin send in trains
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000]  to try to get people out of there
[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000]  as a humanitarian effort
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000]  why don't people know the real history of Ukraine
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000]  or how it started 400 years ago Ukraine wasn't a country at all
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000]  it was settled by Russians
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  who would rather just be Russia
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000]  most of the time
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000]  and it turns out that the same lies about Afghanistan
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000]  about our government and how disgustingly corrupt it was
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000]  well guess what the people of Afghanistan
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000]  it turns out would rather have the Taliban
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000]  than anything that we did
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000]  turning our heads while warlords rate little boys
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000]  teaching
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000]  Pashtun tribesmen the importance of
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000]  transgenderism these people are freaks
[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000]  he just showed this Volodymyr Zelensky
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000]  fake actor model
[02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000]  dancing around in leather
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000]  he was playing the piano with his penis
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000]  I mean these are disgusting demonic
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000]  depraved sick individuals
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000]  who want to run the world and have everybody
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000]  else be a subservient class
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000]  so of course when anybody starts to adopt
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000]  more pro-russia policies what happens
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000]  well what happened in 2014
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000]  our CIA affected a violent coup d'etat
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000]  for an administration that both sides
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000]  in Ukraine suggest
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000]  and admit the vote was fair
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000]  it was a democratically elected administration
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000]  when that administration started
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000]  to develop more pro-russia policies
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000]  which by the way a pro-russia policy
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000]  is being a nationalist right
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000]  he is a Russian nationalist
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000]  what an idea is that
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000]  how refreshing would that be
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  he is an Orthodox Christian who has built
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000]  40,000 churches in his time there
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000]  and these are not disgusting abominations
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000]  these are beautiful cathedrals
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000]  and places of worship in Skonsten gold
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  he kicked out the
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000]  central criminal banking cabal
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000]  he wanted energy independence
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  all the things that take care of Russians
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000]  and 50% of the Ukrainians didn't want to be there
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000]  in Ukraine so our CIA
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  affected a violent coup
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000]  the BLM style popular uprising
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000]  tactic then they paid off our press
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  to convince the rest of the world that that's what this was
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  when in fact all they were doing in
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  2014 was practicing the same tactics
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000]  that they would later use here in 2020
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  we had George Floyd
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  a career criminal home invading thug
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  die right down the street from me here in Minneapolis
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000]  of a fentanyl overdose
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  he died just like you would expect any career criminal
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  home invading thug to die early
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000]  and with a contact with law enforcement
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000]  they locked those guys up
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  there was a racist attack and a murder
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  they locked people up forever
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000]  Black Lives Matter is their color revolution
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  here in Brzezinski and all of them called for it
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  before he died about 5 years ago
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  6 years ago and on top of that
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000]  we have people like George Soros
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000]  going on CNN over Reed Zechariah
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  5-6 years ago admitting that they'd overthrown Ukraine
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  we're already in a proxy war with Russia
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  these people have been caught
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  telling so many lies
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000]  these lies have directly led
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  to the deaths of millions and millions
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  of Americans they have caused infertility
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  and sterility they have caused a died
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  suddenly pandemic the number one
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  phrase being used in obituaries
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  worldwide this is
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  100% the biggest
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  kill off that we have ever seen and they have to
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  complete it so we need to demand right now
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000]  Nuremberg 2.0
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  these people need to be held accountable
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  and there is a precedent for this it's not
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  hyperbolic in nature don't let
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  anybody gaslight you into believing that
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  you're somehow a violent extremist when
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  you suggest that we should be upholding the rule
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  of law military tribunals
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  that doesn't work because our military is
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  depleted and full of transgender freak shows
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000]  and just compliant sheep
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  who would take the death jab themselves and we've got
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000]  nobody left guess what there are
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  340 million Americans in this country
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  there's a precedent for how we handle
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  these war criminals and people who have been
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  leading people to their deaths
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000]  prematurely for decades now
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  the evidence is here we have the
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  bioweapon we have this Ukrainian
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  debacle that's happening here these are
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  we are now in World War 3
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  the globalists are launching it against
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  all of humanity and they plan on only
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  making it intensify what do you think
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  the next big shoot-a-drops are
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  I mean I think that we need to hold these
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  people accountable the next big shoot-a-drops
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  are going to be more of the Marburg pandemics
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  that you just talked about they're going to have to
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  continue the plan that they have found a successful
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  formula in using pandemics
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  locking people down
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  depopulating the planet scaring the hell out of everybody
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  to push them towards the big pharma injections
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000]  that are bioweapons as per the contract
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  with the DoD who ordered
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000]  these things up and then launched warfare
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  and I'm going to tell you something that you should
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  really be careful about so many people
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  including attorneys and law enforcement
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  individuals are out here telling you
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  that our failure of
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  a congress you know gave immunity
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  to big pharma that is a farce
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  they do not have legal immunity there is not
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  one law in the entire
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000]  state of anywhere in this country
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  that one state in this entire country has a law
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  that enables anyone
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  or any business to deploy a weapon
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  of biowearfare or a weapon
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  of mass destruction against innocents these
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  people need to be held accountable
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  Nuremberg 2 that's what we need to call for
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  we need to call for trials we need to call
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  for indictments these people should be
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  perp walked and marched out
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000]  I totally agree I mean what about the FBI
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  what about the justice department what about the CIA
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  most of those people are compartmentalized can't
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  they see this is a bio attack can't they see
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  that they're so called liability protection
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  before they launched it that doesn't
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  protect them from a crime against humanity
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000]  like this I mean they are they really did
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  it it's not coming it's here
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000]  the CIA is the one who
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000]  instructed the Wuhan lab to do exactly
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  what it is that they did they instructed
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  all of this they're running cover for all of this
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  the FBI is jailing patriots
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  and hunting down grandmas and grandpas who
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  preyed on the capital steps on January 6
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  rather than investigating the real
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000]  black crime epidemic here in this country
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  and the criminals that are unleashing a
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  weapon of bio warfare against
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  against us our people our children
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  they have killed an entire generation
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000]  they need to be held accountable they need
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  to be marched out by the US Marshals
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  indicted tried and if found guilty
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  they need to be fried by the way stay
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  right there as we use the Nazi historical
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  parallel we're finally two years before
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  the end of World War two the Nazis are trying to
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  get rid of Hitler but it was too late
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  how do we stop World War three with
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  straight ahead stay with us
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000]  in full wars this had I don't think
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000]  anybody can deny it and it is
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  because of listeners and viewers
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  supporting us but when we talk
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  about the crew at info wars people behind
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000]  the scenes the researchers the writers
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  they really have been
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000]  the MVPs in this fight
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  and we look at Harrison Smith and Owen
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  Schreuer and the hard work they engage in
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000]  every day five six seven days a week
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000]  it's really just incredible
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  so for myself the whole info wars crew
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000]  I thank you for your past support
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  I only encourage you now to realize
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  that info wars cannot stay on air
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  if you do not support us
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000]  I know you spread the word I know you
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  pray for us that's wonderful keep doing it
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  but most viewers and listeners
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  never go to info wars store.com
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  and you never buy great products that enrich

[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000]  of the nuremberg trials
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000]  in 1946 in europe
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000]  of the nazis and survived
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000]  most of them got hung
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000]  the top ones but their top engineers
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000]  and scientists were brought over here
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000]  to be servants of the new world order system
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000]  syndicated talk show host
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  and smart guy stew peters is here with us
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000]  and he's been fearless
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000]  fighting this and exposing it
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000]  and just cutting the chase
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  it's like if you lived in the soviet union
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000]  or you lived under fidel castrow
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000]  or kim jong-un in their early days
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000]  would you try to stop them
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  what would you do to stop them
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  and look at all the fools that go along
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000]  with political correctness in the modern system
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000]  when it's destroying all of us
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  right in front of our faces
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000]  and they're openly having mi6 come out
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  and say they want to ban
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000]  well i mean i read that in the first hour
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000]  that's mainstream news with a straight face
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  rewriting
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000]  the charlie and the chocolate factory
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  i mean these people want
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  mind control over everybody
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  they are degenerate
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000]  they are pedophiles
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  you say well why are they so bad
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000]  we go through cycles where really bad people get control
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  and then even worse people get control
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000]  and then worse get control
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  that's the cycle of corruption
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000]  until they finally run it in the ground
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  and just last week's stew i'm sure you saw it
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  elon mussel
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000]  beams into the world government summit
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  and says hey i want
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  firewalls or bulkheads
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000]  in a ship so that if one chamber floods
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000]  the whole thing doesn't sink
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  one civilization goes down they don't all go down
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  that's one of the biggest arguments
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  against the one world government obviously
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000]  not to mention those running this attempted world government
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000]  are so psychotic and so anti-human
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  like bill gates and claus schwobs
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000]  i don't see how it's a no brainer
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000]  for everybody worldwide
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000]  to unite against the new world order
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  and the good news is i'm starting to see some real traction
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000]  i've known joe rogan 25 years
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  good friend of mine we talk almost every day
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000]  he knows all the stuff i knew
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000]  he's smart as i am or smarter
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000]  he's finally saying new world order claus schwobs
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000]  they're taking over they're making you eat bugs biometrics
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  four shots he did that right after musk came out
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  last week so i'm seeing that
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000]  courage is contagious
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000]  and cnn's not mainstream media
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  almost no one watches it 100,000 viewers on average
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  but people like joe rogan are
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  the mainstream the mainstream is what's most popular
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000]  and the fact that the mainstream
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000]  elon musk
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  joe rogan sound like stew peters sound like alex jones
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000]  carlson you know says i woke him up 10 years ago
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000]  he's on boards but we've got
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000]  to then push that to the masses
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  and the develop a plan to stop this
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000]  was it heartening for you to see what musk said
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000]  and what's your real take on musk
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000]  i mean i we only have
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  an hour together so but i will just say
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  look i mean i think everybody really needs to use discernment
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000]  when it comes to anybody talking about anything
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  look at their fruits see who they really are
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000]  i mean elon musk
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  apparently is doing some decent things over at twitter
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000]  i'm allowed back on there at real stew peters
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000]  which is great because i'm
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  really getting under the feathers
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  some people who deserve it over on that platform
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000]  but i mean this is also the guy from neurolink
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000]  that wants to put chips in your brain
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  and control your mind and your memory
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000]  and your dreams and your thoughts and your behavior
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000]  so i don't really know how
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  free speech elon musk is and i'm really
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000]  kind of taking my time
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  and making a real judgment about that
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000]  but you asked something interesting before the break
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000]  was how do we stop world war three
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000]  how do we stop the new world order
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  yeah you know you see joe rogan
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  following your lead following my lead
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  talking about accountability now because people
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000]  are finally starting to wake up to the fact that
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  hey my media is all owned by the same people
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  why is the fox news channel
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000]  owned predominantly by black rock
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000]  and funded by vanguard
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  and big pharma 75% of the budget
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  from phyzer or from fox
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000]  is obtained by phyzer the people
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  who developed and helped
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  to unleash the bio weapon
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  on humanity and so it's not going
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000]  to stop they're not going to stop until
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  they are stopped and so when
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  you asked about what do we
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  do to stop them well certainly waiting
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000]  for a man to ride in on a white horse
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  in a fake government corporate crime syndicate
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  is not going to work we see that they rig elections
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  and they steal elections voting
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000]  by all intents and purposes is
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  100% fake at the federal level states
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  have to start ignoring the federal government
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000]  state executives
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  like you know florida's ron disantis
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  actually have to mean what they say
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  and then take steps to do it
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000]  to the extent that ron disantis is
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  useful in any way is only
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  to the extent that he will seize the bio
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  weapon and then have his attorneys general
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000]  law enforcement agencies direct them to
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  go arrest the people who are responsible for deploying
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  the bio weapon on floridians nobody's doing
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  that and so it's going to take
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000]  us here americans and
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  like you said citizens around
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  the world to recognize this is what's happening
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  and then to hold these people accountable
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000]  anybody that you see in our government
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  whether it's marjorie taylor green or kevin mccarthy
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  advocating for sending money or supporting
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  any war efforts in ukraine
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000]  against russia
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  against china to defend the taiwan
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  invasion none of these countries taiwan
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000]  nor ukraine have anything to do
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  with our prosperity our individual liberty
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000]  our freedom our sovereignty here in this country
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000]  we should immediately have
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  an immigration moratorium
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  we should deport every single illegal
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  alien that our law enforcement runs across
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  effective immediately sorry no exceptions
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000]  get out we are
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000]  at war right now and then we need to
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  haul these people in including including
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  those politicians those fake
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  leaders that i just mentioned who are all
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  blackmailed and have inflation of bribery
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  with epstein's client lists and pictures
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000]  of them you know having pedophilia
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  you know depraved behavior with children
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  all these people need to be hauled
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  before nuremberg as well and that includes
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  any representative of our government that
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  advocates for more money or more weaponry
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  that's going to lead us directly and that really is
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  the problem and they need to hear from us
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000]  take senator johnson great gone
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  vaccines great on the border
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  but then he's a total war monger
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  yeah i don't really know if he's great
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000]  on the vaccines the fake vaccine
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  poisoned by a weapon either
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  because you know this was kind of a monkey show
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  where he had this self-proclaimed inventor
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000]  of the mRNA technology there basically
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  dictating the meeting and telling him what to say
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000]  look all of these people every single
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000]  person that goes before a camera
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000]  any congressional hearing that you see on television
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  you have to assume as part of the empire of lies
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000]  and it's a hundred percent scripted and fake this is
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000]  pro wrestling this is the rigged nfl
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  that we're watching here it's all theatrics
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  it's all theater it's meant to lead you
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  right down to the level of bare bone
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  subservience they are following
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  agenda 2030 these people they've
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  said it to you exactly bill gates
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000]  stood before the whole country before the whole world
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  and said how do we how do we take
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  care of this i saw the pictures of the georgia
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000]  guide stones earlier 500 million people
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000]  should inhabit earth that's it the guy
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  that's standing in front of you saying we have an over
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  population problem is also the guy who's the most
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  heavily invested in this vaccine and pandemics
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  why is bill gates
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000]  a health expert what is he
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  doing involved with the because he's really they had
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  a planned parenthood which is the planned extermination
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  operations the eugenics board
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000]  not just for killing babies but what i'm saying
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  to you is
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  i agree with you we've got to be hardcore
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000]  because the enemy's hardcore but do you
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  not see it as i said
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000]  how are we doing earlier you said we're getting our asses kicked
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  but i mean
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000]  when the biggest rogan has
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  like 15 20 million viewers today when he's
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  finally feel safe to go public
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  that shows that the scales are tipping
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  our way and it's very
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  very positive and so overall
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  i agree with you we're in deep
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  trouble but at least i'm starting
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  to see some signs of traction
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  and i want to supercharge that's what i'm saying
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  yeah and look
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  i don't want a black pill anybody i'm just
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000]  trying to accurately depict where we are
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  and yes when you see that information is starting
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  to come out when you see that more people are
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  becoming matrix red pill do you know that was a
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  documentary not a movie obviously we need
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  to continue to put them the the pedal
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000]  all the way to the floor this is the time that we
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  really need to step on the gas we can't play
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000]  politics we can't play politically correct
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  with a group of criminals that's trying to kill us
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  so yeah to the extent that joe rogan is
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  reaching ostensibly millions of people a
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  day or hundreds of millions whatever they
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000]  claim to be reaching that's fantastic now
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  what are we going to do with the information
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  what are we going to do the good news is
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000]  and you want to talk about good news i'll give you some good news
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  the good news is that the
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  constitution and the bill of rights and
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  our declaration of independence that were written by
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  our forefathers tell us exactly what to
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  do when tyrants arrive and the tyrants
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  are here they tell us that in
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  any time that there is an oppressive government
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  that violates or oppresses your
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  inherent god given
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  inalienable rights that you are to
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  abolish or tear down that form of government
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  and replace it with something that is representative
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  of the people short of doing that
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  i don't know how anybody expects
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000]  to continue on the trajectory that we're
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  on right now and actually save a country
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  much less save humanity there
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  are billions of people eight billion people
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  on this planet i've heard that five point
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000]  five to seven billion doses of this have
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  gone out to individuals around the world
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  this is the biggest kill off this is a
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  genocidal level mass killing
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000]  and there's a lot of work to be done to get these
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  people to the doorstep of accountability and
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000]  dragged before a nuremberg tribunal
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  and appropriately punished
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  and sent them no i totally agree with you and
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  we've come a long way and that they intended
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  to still have all this rolling out but
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  the spot all the citizenship control
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  talk shows like yours and many others
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  help push it over the edge and so we're
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  seeing some major victory let's come back to the final
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000]  segment with stupeaters that cover the

[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000]  stu peters
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000]  i'm going to take your phone calls

[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000]  in the next hour but this is a real war
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000]  you have to understand that any talk
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  show hosts that are really fighting
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000]  the globalists they're going to come after
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  look at james oakief
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000]  look at how the board fired him right after the
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  Pfizer coup he had
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  that devastated them and got their head
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  of mRNA admitting it's all a fraud
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  they make the viruses
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  they release the viruses they
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  release them to keep you sick
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  and i know as a normal person you're
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000]  listening thinking that's so evil
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  that's impossible no look at history
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  there are times when this happens
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000]  and so i see this as a very healthy point
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  we're at where more and more people
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  are getting in and i don't say this again to brag
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  i say it because the average person is
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000]  blessed you're not prominent
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000]  you have your privacy with the public
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  you go out you don't know how popular
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000]  liberty is but i can tell you
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000]  i go all over the country and all over the world
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  and before i'd walk down the street
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  twenty years ago and maybe one out of a hundred
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000]  people would shake my hand and then ten years
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  ago it was you know one out of ten
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  would be a listener and everyone saw
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  i'd run into an enemy and then with trump
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  you know i'd walk down the street and
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  i'd shake twenty hands before somebody said fq
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000]  i want to kill you russian agent
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  now all i get is love knock on wood
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  i mean it is very rare to be screamed at
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  to have coffee thrown on me tea thrown
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000]  on me it happens it's happening all the time
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  a lot of footage of that you've seen
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000]  and all i'm getting is basically love
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000]  now even from former leftist so it's
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  got to be the election fraud which we
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  know there's massive evidence of it's allowing
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  them to stay in so you say well how do they save themselves
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  when their debt bubbles coming to an end
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000]  when the pedophilia is coming out well they start
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000]  a war they release the virus i think that's
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  what stu peters is saying we need a real
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  sense of extreme
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  urgency right now
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  to be reaching as many people as we can not
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000]  go oh we kind of back them off on the
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  lockdowns and shots no we have it they're
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  coming back with it
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  and the u.n. is convening
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000]  emergency meetings saying there's a virus
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  that kills 90% of humans marburg
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  out there now whether that's hyper
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  not folks this is what they want
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  this is the control they want
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  and that's where we're at so stew in the
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000]  eight eight minutes or so we have left
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  my friend you've got a lot of information
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000]  i want to give you the floor and hit any other
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000]  key topics you want to cover
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000]  i mean you just mentioned the u.n.
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  and more pandemics who do you think it is
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  it's going to enforce that
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  and then along with that of course you're going to have
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  people that you know claim to be fighting back
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  against you know the mandates and the
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  lockdowns and the tyranny and you're right
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000]  we can't do that again we cannot give these
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  people an inch there will be no more
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  lockdowns there will be no more shots the people
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  that are responsible for that need to be held
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  accountable and brought to justice the u.n.
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000]  will be enforcing that what's left of our
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  military will be enforcing that you don't
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  think that there's a military here right now
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000]  under the control of this illegitimate pedophile
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000]  fake regime right now that would use a
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000]  military against its own people to actually
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  fire on its own people to go door to door
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  and confiscate firearms they're already telling
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000]  the mcloskies you saw it in the wake of
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  the george floyd riots you can't even stand
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000]  on your front step and defend
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  your own life and liberty and property
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000]  you can't do that you're going to be
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  prosecuted and charged and lose your guns
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000]  and thrown in jail look the puppeteers
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  that are controlling biden
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  and china and all of these other people are
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  waging total war on america right now
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000]  i mean what are they doing they're using
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  computers and cyber warfare
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000]  they're smuggling illegal immigrants
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000]  they're manipulating stock markets
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  they're influencing the american
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  media to use weapons
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  of mass destruction against us to light
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000]  trains on fire filled with
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000]  vinyl chloride that will then go into
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  the ohio river responsible for delivering
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  water to five million people by the way
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  the largest tributary to the mississippi river
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000]  which delivers water to an unknown amount
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000]  of people i mean ostensibly 10 20 30
[02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000]  40 million people along the southern
[02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000]  part of the mississippi river this is
[02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000]  all to destroy america and i know
[02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000]  you've seen the footage of the train
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000]  in in in ohio
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000]  going a half mile an hour the tracks
[02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000]  are so crooked when the chinese
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000]  and russians and everybody has and
[02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000]  the europe has speed trains that go
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000]  300 miles an hour cruising speed can go
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000]  400 and then we've got footage
[02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000]  of all the dead dove
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000]  hanging by their feet off the
[02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000]  power lines falling off dead
[02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  miles from the site as they tell you it's
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000]  all safe i mean they are
[02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000]  at war with the american people remember
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000]  biden wouldn't even go to ohio
[02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000]  and block federal funding i mean
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000]  these people are outrageously at war
[02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000]  with us
[02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000]  wouldn't even go to ohio but where did
[02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000]  he make his surprise trip to to write a
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000]  note to this war criminal
[02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000]  zealinski who's running
[02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000]  a literal nazi azo
[02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000]  battalion committing war crimes shooting
[02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000]  people trying to flee in the back
[02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000]  he's got soldiers over there videotaping
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000]  himself actually cannibalizing
[02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000]  eating opposition soldiers
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000]  and you're right they intentionally let this thing
[02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000]  on fire this is warfare they're using
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000]  asymmetrical multi-dimensional
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000]  attacks on almost every aspect of our
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000]  social lives of our economic lives of our
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000]  political lives and you got to be on the
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000]  lookout for you know limited hangouts
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000]  unrestricted warfare that's
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000]  what we need to call this unrestricted warfare
[02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000]  and it's upon us right now that means
[02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000]  there's no longer a distinction
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000]  between what is a battlefield
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000]  and what is not a
[02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000]  battlefield really virtually nothing is
[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000]  safe that we see in our structure
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000]  right now other than going
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000]  full-core with the speed of urgency
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000]  like you just said we need
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000]  to move to citizens grand juries we need
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000]  to move to a lawman who says
[02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000]  look i'm going to take this evidence
[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000]  i'm going to investigate this crime
[02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000]  congressional inquiries congressional
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000]  investigations it's all bs
[02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000]  when is the last time any of your
[02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000]  viewing audience has had
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000]  a difference made in their lives by a
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000]  jim jordan inquiry or
[02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000]  you know a marjorie taylor green
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000]  impeachment proceeding let me ask you
[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000]  though what do you think of the louisiana
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  and missouri attorney generals
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000]  they're going after big pharma they're calling
[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000]  a criminal they're having depositions
[02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000]  if louisiana and missouri
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000]  attorneys general are actually
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000]  willing to arrest
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000]  the people that are responsible
[02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000]  then absolutely that's what
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000]  we need to focus on laser focus
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000]  the real method of action here has
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000]  to be handcuffs arrests
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000]  perp walk stand
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000]  trial become convicted and then have
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000]  sent and if that just happened this whole thing
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000]  would fall like a house of cards but the global
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000]  is keep doubling down getting away with more
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000]  and more what's left but world war three
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000]  and new bio releases
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000]  how is the mainstream media
[02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000]  how are people like the fox
[02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000]  news channel how are these
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000]  people who by the way the fox news channel
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000]  led my own father despite my fight
[02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000]  you said this is war for people like us
[02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000]  and you're absolutely right i've been
[02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000]  watching what you're going through we've been reporting on it
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000]  on the stu petershow it's horrific
[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000]  these people convinced
[02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000]  my dad who by the way knows what his son
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000]  does for a living to go and get
[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000]  not only one injection but two and three
[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000]  and then trump said that they were safe and effective
[02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000]  and encouraged people to go get their boosters said
[02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000]  I got mine total riley that
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000]  how are these people still able to sit on the television
[02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000]  and talk about a safe and effective vaccine
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  when this one shot
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000]  in this short period of time is responsible for killing
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000]  three times as many people as every previous vaccine
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000]  ever rolled out combined how can they do
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000]  and how can they get away with it these people
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000]  are at war with us on absolutely every single
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000]  I totally agree what do you
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  make about James O'Keeffe I mean I say
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000]  Veritas is dead he
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000]  I mean this is so transparent
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  that the FBI certainly knew indict members of project
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  Veritas and they didn't do this this is
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000]  disgusting yeah
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000]  you know James O'Keeffe is project
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000]  Veritas and I will just
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000]  say that you know James O'Keeffe the work that he has done
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  over the years you know I mean
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  the things that he is exposed will salute him
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000]  if this is the last time that we ever see him
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  you know but everybody predicted
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000]  that this was going to happen to anybody who
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000]  brings information like what was exposed
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000]  by project Veritas I mean anybody knows
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000]  that if you bring information like this
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  that impacts the plan of a Jenna 2030
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000]  or a one-world government they're going
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000]  to come after you as hard as they can when I saw
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000]  when I saw
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  that footage he released three weeks ago I said
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  that they're coming after him I said
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  that's it I mean that Pfizer footage
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  is just incredible
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  yeah the amount of
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000]  corruption that has yet to be
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000]  exposed is unthinkable
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000]  but we have
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  enough because of the reporting
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  of James O'Keeffe because of the
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  reporting of you know Alex Jones
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000]  and Info Wars over the years because of the
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  reporting of the Stu Peters Network and Platform
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000]  and our show we
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000]  have exposed enough to take action
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  and these people these so-called
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  elected representatives in this fake
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  constitutional republic where there's some sort of an illusion
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000]  of a you know a
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000]  freedom or individual liberty
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000]  or even that your vote counts
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000]  every single one of them knows
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  every one of them has the same
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000]  information that you do don't let them say
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000]  that they don't know don't let them gaslight
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  you into believing that they're going to launch an investigation
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  the evidence is there
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  it's in black and white it's written on
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000]  their own patents this is a weapon
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000]  of bio warfare it was manufactured
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000]  and deployed against you
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  it has killed an unprecedented
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  number of kids both in the womb and out
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  more people are dying
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  suddenly and dropping dead
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  and it's all a test to see and they can get away with it
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  tell us about the died suddenly
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000]  film

[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000]  and as long as it's happening
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  it's our job to continue to

[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  hour number four straight ahead
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000]  I talk a lot about
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  the great successes info wars has had
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  and it is because of Lister's
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000]  and viewers supporting us
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  when we talk about the crew at info wars
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  people behind the scenes the researchers the writers
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000]  they really have
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  been the MVPs in this fight
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000]  and we look at Harrison Smith
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000]  and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  every day five six seven days a week
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000]  it's really just incredible
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  so for myself the whole info wars crew
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  I thank you for your past support
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  I only encourage you now to realize
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000]  that info wars
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  cannot stay on air if you do not support us
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000]  I know you spread the word

[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000]  but most viewers and listeners
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000]  never go to infowarstore.com
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  and you never buy great products that enrich

[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000]  I know that less than one percent
[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000]  of our listeners actually go buy products
[02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000]  at infowarstore.com
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000]  if just one percent more of you took action
[02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000]  at infowarstore.com our funding problems will be over
[02:58:47.000 --> 02:59:09.000]  please take action now.

[02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000]  than major competitors
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000]  selling the exact high quality
[02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000]  full spectrum CBD

[02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000]  than what they're sold for in stores
[02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:47.000]  infowarstore.com
[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000]  at some stages don't care this first five minutes
[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000]  I'm going to cover some news here we can come back from break
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000]  in six minutes I'm going to write
[03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000]  to Tawana everybody else the order
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000]  your calls are received on this
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  live Monday broadcast we're into
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000]  the fourth hour you know I have
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  known Roseanne Barr for years
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000]  I have tried to interview her
[03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  many many times she always
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000]  says she's going to come on and she does
[03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000]  she lives in Hawaii she invited me
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000]  out to her house in Hawaii she invited me out to her house
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  outside Austin she's a great lady
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000]  people that I know that know her
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000]  but she definitely has courage I need to go out
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000]  and meet whether I need to go out and interview at her house
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000]  that's probably the best way to get her on but I saw
[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000]  some of her new stand-up she told me about
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  a month ago she said I'm going to really
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000]  lay it into them on my new stand-up and she told
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000]  me that she's really getting a good
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  response around the country when she engages
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  in the stand-up so it's super
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000]  hardcore and she told me she's
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000]  mainly only getting love like 95%
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000]  positive feedback so
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000]  again another bellwether that people
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000]  are waking up they think they'll just
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  hit us with a bio weapon and hit us with a poison
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  shot that's 10 times worse and then
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000]  we'll just kind of forget about it and move on to the next thing and the next attack
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000]  no
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  exposing the attack
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000]  hammering the truth
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000]  getting the information out there is the life
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000]  saver that we
[03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000]  absolutely have to have
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000]  we've got to do it
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000]  we've got to do it now it is do or die
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  and I keep hammering
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  this audience not because you haven't done a great job not
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000]  because you aren't amazing people but because you're the best
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000]  we've got you're the most awake people in the
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  world the globalists don't just hate me
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  they hate you
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000]  they hate you and and they want
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000]  to economically destroy you
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000]  so they can have their criminal way
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  with you ladies and gentlemen and I know
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000]  most of you know that but you've got to really let it burn
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  into your head for those of you that have been on
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  the fence hiding doesn't
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000]  protect you from this hiding
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  let these people take over
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000]  we have to stop hiding
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000]  we have to go public
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000]  we have to speak out and we've got to do it
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  right now so here's the clip of
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  Rosie and Barr
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  we'll go to break
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000]  we will come back and go directly to your calls
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000]  how many of you's got the backs
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  you obviously probably had to get it right
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  were you forced to get the backs
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000]  yeah boy what
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  that makes me mad they forced
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000]  people to get the backs
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  I hope they have to pay for that
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000]  what they did to us
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000]  did you get any of that myocarditis
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  or the facial paralysis
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  or you know the adult drop and dead
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  syndrome or any of that
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  did any of that
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  what happened to people
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000]  that they start believing
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000]  for some reason that this
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000]  government had their best
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:03.000]  what is it hard
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  my whole family
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000]  is a bunch of libtards
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  as I said
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000]  that has called me a conspiracy theorist
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000]  the whole time but everything I said
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000]  turned out to be true
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  did they apologize
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  hell no
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  they never apologize
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000]  they never admit they're wrong
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000]  do they
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000]  now my whole family is sick
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  what with blood clots and this and that
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000]  and the other they're all sick
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000]  I'm the only healthy one
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000]  I'm going to miss them
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000]  what happened to people though
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000]  how could they line up
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  to take these shots
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000]  from this government
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000]  knowing that this government gave
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000]  smallpox
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  infested blankets
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  to the first nations people
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000]  gave syphilis
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000]  to black
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000]  prisoners in tuskegee
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000]  told us there was
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000]  weapons of mass destruction
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  before they leveled
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000]  Iraq and destroyed Libya
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000]  told us fen fen was safe
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  and then all the f*** fat people
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000]  died
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000]  what happened
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  they're like hey
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  can I get that booster
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000]  can I get that shot
[03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000]  in those 15 boosters
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000]  would you mind giving my daughter here
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  that shot right in her eyeball
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  after she's born
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  could you give her 10 of those
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000]  right in the eyeball
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000]  could you give her a shot
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  right in her little baby clitoris
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000]  could you do that for me
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000]  Mr. Biden
[03:04:51.000 --> 03:05:13.000]  what's wrong with people
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000]  I'm not going to back down
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  and I'll never give up
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000]  so please keep me on the field
[03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000]  keep me on the front lines

[03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000]  the globalist are counting on you
[03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000]  not taking action
[03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:03.000]  your calls are coming up
[03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000]  right now
[03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000]  resistance to tyrants
[03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000]  is obedience to God
[03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000]  it's Alex Jones
[03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000]  thousands of former Nazis
[03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000]  went to work for the United States
[03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000]  government
[03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000]  applying this has been found
[03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.000]  and is now in the possession of the army
[03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000]  here is a bulletin from cbf news
[03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000]  resident Kennedy has been shot
[03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000]  this is a different
[03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000]  kind of war
[03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000]  the USS Liberty had just been
[03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000]  attacked by Israeli jets and torpedoes
[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.000]  the IA could manipulate
[03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000]  the news in the United States
[03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000]  they took the babies out of incubators
[03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000]  and left the children to die on a cold block
[03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000]  it was almost as if it were a plan
[03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000]  in full action
[03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000]  you will always have conspiracy theories
[03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000]  they are nothing but distract
[03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:59.000]  you guys censored Harvard educated doctors
[03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:01.000]  you silenced those voices
[03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000]  what we want to do in Davos
[03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000]  is to reset
[03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000]  as soon as we start exposing
[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.000]  the great reset the sooner
[03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:13.000]  these globalists start going to prison
[03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:17.000]  alright thanks for holding callers
[03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000]  we are in to hour number 4
[03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.000]  and try to move quickly through your calls
[03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000]  Tawana in Tennessee on Biden Ukraine
[03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.000]  versus Arnold country welcome
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000]  yeah hey Alex
[03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:29.000]  hey I could go on for a month
[03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000]  and not talk about everything I've wanted to talk to you about
[03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000]  over the past 20 years
[03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000]  but let me just say I'm popped up
[03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:37.000]  on fizzy magnesium today
[03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000]  I have Biden and Zelensky
[03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000]  some great greetings
[03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000]  for a wonderful president's day
[03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000]  as they spend the day together
[03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000]  I'm so happy for them
[03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.000]  they're a match made in heaven
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000]  but Alex what's most important is
[03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000]  we haven't talked about the CBDC pilot program
[03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000]  in and in February
[03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:57.000]  for over a week now
[03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.000]  because we have so many other places
[03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:01.000]  that they've got spending
[03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000]  that our minds are just racing like crazy
[03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000]  and I'm telling you Alex
[03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000]  that's the final nail in the coffin
[03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000]  and I think that's what they're working on
[03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000]  well listen I've been hammering the central bank digital currency
[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000]  and did you notice that in the town
[03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000]  in Palestine
[03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000]  10 days before
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000]  in fact I meant to cover this Sunday
[03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.000]  guys reprint it for me I think it's even in the stack
[03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000]  but I can't find it
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000]  FEMA handed out wristbands
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000]  for an emergency pilot program
[03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000]  to the locals
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000]  and came door to door 10 days before
[03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:33.000]  the train blew up
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000]  before they landed on fire
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000]  can you believe that?
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000]  how obvious is that?
[03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  one step away Alex
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000]  we're one step away
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000]  and this is the crescendo
[03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000]  and we've got to start having solutions
[03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000]  you've got to look local
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000]  you've got to look for your community
[03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000]  look for your tribe
[03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000]  and work around how we're going to do this
[03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000]  we've got to work around this
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000]  we are the warriors Alex
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000]  can I let out a primal scream
[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000]  yes
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000]  it's the world order
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000]  let me see your war face
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000]  oh Alex man
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000]  I love you god bless you
[03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:13.000]  god bless all the info warriors
[03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000]  everybody please keep on supporting Alex
[03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000]  so that we can continue to fight
[03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000]  I love it and it's that
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000]  so don't hang up that's a primal spirit Tawana
[03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:23.000]  I interrupted your primal scream with mine
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000]  let me hear your war growl
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:29.000]  that's just another world order
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  yeah baby
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000]  love you I appreciate your call
[03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  making points wow
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000]  Ralph in Mississippi
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000]  it'd be hard to follow that up
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  go ahead Ralph
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000]  okay I've got some info to pass on to you
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000]  yes sir
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000]  Monkey Works US
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000]  that's spelled WERX
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.000]  on
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  2-10-23 this is a Friday a week ago
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000]  broadcast coverage of the actual
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000]  flight
[03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:07.000]  flight line of the plane that flew from the US
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.000]  to Iceland to fuel up
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000]  all the way to the Baltic Sea
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  did a one hour refuel
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:15.000]  marked a spot in the Baltic Sea
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.000]  flew out, returned back on a bombing run
[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  dropped down, unloaded weapons
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  pulled back up the fight height that took back off to the ocean
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:23.000]  and he's got the actual coverage
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  that shows you exactly what happened
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000]  when that's when the pipeline's gone
[03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:29.000]  I know Sy Hershey's done a great job
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.000]  documenting all that
[03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000]  a day into it
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:35.000]  he documented what people want him to believe
[03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  Monkey Works shows you exactly
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000]  what happened
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000]  there's no question about it
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:43.000]  we sent a
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.000]  PA over there
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:47.000]  dropped most likely Hawk missiles
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  took out all the pipelines that hauled back to the US
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  nobody knew that flight was there
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:53.000]  there's a Hawk missile
[03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:55.000]  is that surface to sea? does that go underwater?
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  apparently
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  this is the newest version of stuff they've got
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  and that's apparently what they use
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.000]  all Monkey Works shows
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.000]  if he shows the exact flight coming over
[03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000]  shows it circling around for one hour refuel
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000]  shows it marking a spot
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000]  in the Baltic going out 50 miles
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000]  making a U-turn coming back
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.000]  dropping down to bombing level
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000]  unloading weapons
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  when the plane jumps up in the air
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:21.000]  levels it back off the flight height
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.000]  and hauls back out to you
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  I have a lot of respect for Sy Hershey
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  when I first saw what happened
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:29.000]  months before he came out with his report
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:31.000]  they had a big NATO drill right over the pipeline area
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:33.000]  they said they trained other Navy divers
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:35.000]  so it wouldn't be Navy SEALs
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:37.000]  who report back to Congress
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:39.000]  and that they would use remote detonators
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  so whoever delivered the weapons payload
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:43.000]  wouldn't be over the target when it happened
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.000]  because of all the
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:47.000]  systems that document who's where
[03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.000]  but regardless
[03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:51.000]  Biden said he was going to blow it up
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000]  so did April Gillespie
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  and all the rest of them
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  April Gillespie whatever name is
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000]  I appreciate your call brother
[03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000]  not disagreeing with you we should just look into it
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000]  I'll look into it okay
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:05.000]  Candice in Tennessee thanks for holding go ahead
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:07.000]  Hey Alex
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.000]  Hey I'm great to be talking to you today
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000]  I'm president today
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  it's history month
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:15.000]  and we are currently
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.000]  in psychological, financial, biological
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000]  warfare
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.000]  it's already been going on
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000]  to me specifically I called
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:25.000]  about 7-8 months ago to tell you I've been
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  surviving humiliation rituals
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000]  I'm a satanic ritual survivor
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  I got the IBM
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000]  book that said
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:35.000]  basically what's all rolling out now
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  was pre-planned in the 70's
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000]  I talked about that with you and I called into
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000]  Harrison's show
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000]  about this Adventures of Tomorrow
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:45.000]  book and they looked it up it's about
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000]  $1,000
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.000]  what it's priced at online
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  and I live in the middle
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.000]  Tennessee area in Cheatham County
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  and you've talked about these sex operatives
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.000]  I've been being stalked
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  for an extremely long time
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000]  by FBI
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:03.000]  a local law enforcement
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.000]  in Cheatham County said that they weren't the ones
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.000]  stalking me it's the big government
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000]  I've been complaining so much that
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000]  they sent me a letter saying
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.000]  don't call us you're wasting our resources
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:15.000]  this is the FBI I have all of this
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:17.000]  information
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000]  on the very first day of this year
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:21.000]  January 1st
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:23.000]  there's no doubt that we're all being surveilled
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:25.000]  there's all sorts of criminal activity going on
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:27.000]  I'm sorry to hear that's happening to you
[03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000]  but speaking of books that predict all this
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:31.000]  we're going to grab the clip we'll have it next segment
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:33.000]  on Saturday's show
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.000]  Jade Iyer talked about an Arthur C. Clark book
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.000]  I hadn't read
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:39.000]  in the 80's where it describes
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  the exact world we'd be living in
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  in the year 20 I think it says
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:45.000]  18 but we'll actually show you
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.000]  the book when we come back it's pretty amazing
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  thank you for the call Paul and May
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:51.000]  you're on the air go ahead
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:53.000]  Alex first time
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  long time hey so I just wanted
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000]  to talk about something
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  that Stu Peters just
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000]  mentioned so he was talking
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:03.000]  about unrestricted warfare
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000]  so
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.000]  some people call that fifth generation warfare
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:09.000]  right so it's
[03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000]  I call it full spectrum dominance
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000]  absolutely absolutely
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000]  so the thing
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:17.000]  I worry about when we get into this kind of talk
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.000]  about resistance
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000]  some people are going to get the wrong idea obviously
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000]  they're going to start thinking
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:25.000]  old school they're going to start thinking old ways
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:27.000]  of fighting but I just kind of really want
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:29.000]  to drill into people that
[03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000]  trying to fight this level
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000]  of tyranny and corruption in this age
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:35.000]  of information warfare it's like trying to storm
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  a world war one machine
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:39.000]  the average cop or FBI agent is just
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  departmentalized they're not the enemy they're under attack as well
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:42.000]  you beat it by
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:44.000]  departmentalizing people so they
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:46.000]  see the big picture like Elon Musk did
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:48.000]  when he confronted the world government last week
[03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:50.000]  that's how you get victory is exposing
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:52.000]  that it's a tiny group at the top orchestrating this
[03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:54.000]  and they're the enemy and then you just simply
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:56.000]  expose them where they're the most hated people
[03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:58.000]  on earth and any policy they push
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  everybody turns against and then you have victory
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:02.000]  they need to get full spectrum dominance over
[03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:04.000]  our bodies and over our resources
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:06.000]  first to wralt the rest of their plan
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:08.000]  but now because we've got the jump on them I believe they're going to fail
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:10.000]  absolutely absolutely
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  I just wanted to say that you know what's
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:14.000]  the next level after fifth generation
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:16.000]  warfare that's going to be fixed right what is that
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:18.000]  the levels of warfare been getting finer
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:20.000]  and subtler I don't want to cut you off
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:22.000]  Paul tell us what you think I'm
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:24.000]  smart guy six generational warfare is
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:26.000]  but I mean fifth generation
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:28.000]  is basically full spectrum so she's under level of that
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:30.000]  we'll come right back with Paul to finish up his great points
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:32.000]  and then we'll go to everybody else it's holding
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:34.000]  we can't take any more calls no more calls
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:36.000]  the board guys just the ones working out here this is plenty
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:38.000]  this is 11 phone calls
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:40.000]  and I'm going to jam every single one of you
[03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:42.000]  in here before this transmission ends
[03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:44.000]  and then in 45 minutes from now
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:46.000]  you know what that means oh and the cuck
[03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:48.000]  slayer the cuck destroyer

[03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:00.000]  that this is an information war
[03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:02.000]  and it takes money to find that information war
[03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:04.000]  and everyone should decide
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:06.000]  to take the fight the next level
[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:08.000]  and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear
[03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:10.000]  and ensure we stand the field in this war

[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:18.000]  and I ask you now to count the cost and realize
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:20.000]  that only your commitment
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:22.000]  to keep info wars on the air
[03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:24.000]  will ensure our victory against the new world order
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:26.000]  they're coming for you and your family
[03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:28.000]  they're coming for me
[03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:30.000]  they're coming for the children but to get to the children
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:32.000]  they've got to get through us first
[03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:34.000]  these monsters are all over television
[03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:36.000]  wanting to give these shots to newborn babies

[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:18.000]  supplement that features
[03:19:18.000 --> 03:19:20.000]  it's a natural proteolytic
[03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:22.000]  enzyme this one is
[03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:24.000]  the only enzyme that we're aware
[03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:26.000]  right now that dissolves the spike protein
[03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:28.000]  this is very important the spike protein
[03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:30.000]  is loaded in the body with the covid-19
[03:19:30.000 --> 03:19:32.000]  infection and definitely with the vaccines
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:34.000]  people are low with the spike protein
[03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:36.000]  i don't feel well this is a potential solution
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:38.000]  hydroxychloroquine comes
[03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:40.000]  from a natural substance so does
[03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:42.000]  ivermectin and now natto kinase
[03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:44.000]  isn't it interesting
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:46.000]  natural substances in a sense
[03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:48.000]  combating this man-made disaster
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:50.000]  SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines
[03:19:50.000 --> 03:19:52.000]  online health now dot com thank you for your support

[03:19:54.000 --> 03:20:22.000]  you didn't come here to do that but i made you do it
[03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:24.000]  the screen
[03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:26.000]  for TV viewers
[03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:28.000]  is a CIA
[03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:30.000]  advertisement
[03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:32.000]  online for young people to join the CIA
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:34.000]  and spy
[03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:36.000]  on the American people
[03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:38.000]  skeletons, ghosts, demons, witches
[03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:40.000]  this is just
[03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:42.000]  a bunch of whacked out criminals
[03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:44.000]  that have done
[03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:46.000]  what other people have done throughout history
[03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:48.000]  government gets control it sets up a cult
[03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:50.000]  and it decides to feed on the rest of the people
[03:20:50.000 --> 03:20:52.000]  it always collapses civilization
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:54.000]  the same disease that's killed
[03:20:54.000 --> 03:20:56.000]  so many civilizations and peoples we now have
[03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:58.000]  all in main
[03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:00.000]  yeah not shopping at the box stores
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:02.000]  when you can
[03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:04.000]  supporting independent local business
[03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:06.000]  supporting local farmers
[03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:08.000]  having your own energy systems being self-deficient
[03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:10.000]  it's really how you checkmate these people
[03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:12.000]  and as things get worse and worse
[03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:14.000]  as the globalists turn off the energy and the food supplies
[03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:16.000]  and everything to force you to take the shots
[03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:18.000]  it'll become evident to everybody else
[03:21:18.000 --> 03:21:20.000]  that's really the answer
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:22.000]  but you're going to get into 5th generation warfare
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:24.000]  6th generation warfare go ahead
[03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:26.000]  yeah so
[03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:28.000]  you think about it if you want to defeat an enemy
[03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:30.000]  you have to be one step ahead you have to reach
[03:21:30.000 --> 03:21:32.000]  the next plane of warfare before they do
[03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:34.000]  if you're evenly matched
[03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:36.000]  so as I said
[03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:38.000]  the levels of warfare have been getting
[03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:40.000]  subtler and finer over time we went from bashing each other
[03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:42.000]  skulls in with rocks all the way up to
[03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:44.000]  information warfare in the mind
[03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:46.000]  but I really do believe
[03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:48.000]  this is going to sound like total foolishness
[03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:50.000]  if you are totally anchored to the physical world
[03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:52.000]  but spiritual warfare is the next level of warfare
[03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:54.000]  and some would argue
[03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:56.000]  it's always been the one level of warfare
[03:21:56.000 --> 03:21:58.000]  you know
[03:21:58.000 --> 03:22:00.000]  purification of your thoughts
[03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:02.000]  purification of your actions
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:04.000]  you know real deep soul searching
[03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:06.000]  I really heartily recommend fasting
[03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:08.000]  to really
[03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:10.000]  connect spiritually
[03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:12.000]  and cleanse yourself
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:14.000]  there's all sorts of unseen
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:16.000]  worlds around us
[03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:18.000]  that they echo
[03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:20.000]  what happens here right
[03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:22.000]  so I really do believe that
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:24.000]  well by the way I said what's above fifth generational
[03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:26.000]  because it's attacking everything
[03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:28.000]  and I was wondering what you're going to say but no
[03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:30.000]  the first level and the last level and all the levels
[03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:32.000]  is spiritual it all comes down to our souls
[03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:34.000]  that's what this is all about I totally agree
[03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:36.000]  absolutely
[03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:38.000]  and like I said it sounds like
[03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:40.000]  complete foolishness to people who are still stuck
[03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:42.000]  in rifles and bombs mode
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:44.000]  because they're just still too
[03:22:44.000 --> 03:22:46.000]  anchored to the physical world
[03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:48.000]  I hear you a great point Paul calling in thank you
[03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:50.000]  Mike and Illinois you're on the air
[03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:52.000]  I just wanted to
[03:22:52.000 --> 03:22:54.000]  talk about
[03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:56.000]  I just went on a cruise recently
[03:22:56.000 --> 03:22:58.000]  and I wore your Alex Jones's right shirt
[03:22:58.000 --> 03:23:00.000]  and it was just like
[03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:02.000]  one of the most magical experiences
[03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:04.000]  I've ever had
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:06.000]  ever
[03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:08.000]  what happened tell folks about it
[03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:10.000]  I just
[03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:12.000]  people were Canadians
[03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:14.000]  that approached me
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:16.000]  one lady was from New York
[03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:18.000]  and
[03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:20.000]  her son got myocarditis
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:22.000]  after getting a shot and she didn't know
[03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:24.000]  who you were so she asked me
[03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:26.000]  is that down at the bar next to me
[03:23:26.000 --> 03:23:28.000]  and she was like well who's Alex Jones
[03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:30.000]  like what was he right about
[03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:32.000]  and I was like well where should I start
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:36.000]  and then we just had like
[03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:38.000]  a three hour conversation
[03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:40.000]  and I'm pretty sure she was
[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:42.000]  a very red build after this
[03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:44.000]  even her husband was like
[03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:46.000]  I work a union job so
[03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:48.000]  I can't say that I listened to
[03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:50.000]  Alex Jones but
[03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:52.000]  you should pay attention
[03:23:52.000 --> 03:23:54.000]  to what this guy is saying
[03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:56.000]  wow so she didn't know who I was but her husband did
[03:23:56.000 --> 03:23:58.000]  her husband did
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:00.000]  but he was you know those unions
[03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:02.000]  well that's the thing there's all the secret listeners
[03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:04.000]  what other feedback did you get
[03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:06.000]  just
[03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:08.000]  amazing
[03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:10.000]  the Canadians were just like
[03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:12.000]  oh yeah great you know they give me
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:14.000]  like a high five or
[03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:16.000]  whatever well that's what I'm telling folks
[03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:18.000]  is liberty is so popular but we're all isolated
[03:24:18.000 --> 03:24:20.000]  individuals we don't know it
[03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:22.000]  now you get a hundred to one love
[03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:24.000]  you might also get a beer bottle over your head
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:26.000]  wearing it too so be careful I was afraid
[03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:28.000]  I was going to get thrown over the boat
[03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:32.000]  but I really want to
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:34.000]  promote your red reel
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:36.000]  real red pill plus
[03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:38.000]  oh my god that thing is just
[03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:40.000]  blowing my mind how good it's just
[03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:42.000]  what did it do for you what did
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:44.000]  a real red pill do when you took it
[03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:46.000]  well I have fibromyalgia
[03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:48.000]  and it's made my pain
[03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:50.000]  be reduced by probably 50%
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:52.000]  and I have energy to like
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:54.000]  do things you know
[03:24:54.000 --> 03:24:56.000]  or normally like it was
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:24:58.000]  like oh god I gotta like do my laundry
[03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:00.000]  or whatever no
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:02.000]  this stuff and that and the
[03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:04.000]  brain force ultra
[03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:06.000]  or both of those products
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:08.000]  for me have been transformational
[03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:10.000]  but you're sure the thing about
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.000]  real red pill plus is it's got
[03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:14.000]  some natural healthy stimulant in it but
[03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:16.000]  that's not what does it it's the preglonone
[03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:18.000]  and the other trace elements but the preglonone is
[03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:20.000]  the basis of all your hormones with all
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:22.000]  the hormones that are in the food and water it blocks the preglonone
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:24.000]  is what scientists and doctors have told
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:26.000]  me and so when you take preglonone
[03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:28.000]  especially if you're over 30 or 40 then
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:30.000]  it helps the building blocks of your natural hormones
[03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:32.000]  so it gives you long healthy sustained
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:34.000]  energy so people should get real red pill
[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:36.000]  plus at infowarstore.com
[03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:38.000]  God bless you and I really

[03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:08.000]  it's getting crazy
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:10.000]  yeah man well man just wanted
[03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  to give a shout out to all of my proud boys
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:14.000]  nationwide hold in tight
[03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:16.000]  and a little update on the
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:18.000]  January 6th political prisoners
[03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:20.000]  we had a boy named Ryan Samso
[03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:22.000]  Samso who's
[03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:24.000]  been in contact with the gateway pundit
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:26.000]  and now he's already been assaulted
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:28.000]  three times
[03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:30.000]  keep in mind this guy hasn't even been tried
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:32.000]  and he's been held for two years now
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:34.000]  he's already been beaten, hogtied
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:36.000]  abused, tied to a chair for 12 hours
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:38.000]  denied his medical treatment
[03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:40.000]  one guy had his one guy that
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  one guy the jail guards beat his eye on
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:44.000]  and that's what I'm talking about now
[03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:46.000]  he has no vision in his eye
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:48.000]  and he's even lost his phone
[03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:50.000]  privileges for six months so now he can't even
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:52.000]  speak to the gateway pundit
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:54.000]  to talk about what he needs to talk about
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:56.000]  shine a light on his situation
[03:26:56.000 --> 03:26:58.000]  and that's political persecution
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:00.000]  he's a political prisoner we should pray for him
[03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:02.000]  he is a political prisoner
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:04.000]  and I just want to shout out to Rupio

[03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:18.000]  it might seem like we've been swept under a rug
[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:20.000]  because Biden's in office but I tell you that
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:22.000]  the fire in our souls

[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:48.000]  tried as political prisoners
[03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:50.000]  just for expressing their patriotic
[03:27:50.000 --> 03:27:52.000]  rights and I would ask that you lay
[03:27:52.000 --> 03:27:54.000]  something on Trump's heart as well
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:27:56.000]  and his soul to make him speak out
[03:27:56.000 --> 03:27:58.000]  more and raise more awareness to this situation
[03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  lord

[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:04.000]  a battle that's going to be one
[03:28:04.000 --> 03:28:06.000]  for you ultimately but it's a dark road
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:08.000]  and I just pray you keep
[03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:10.000]  eyes on everybody and pray
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:12.000]  that these guys make it out of these jail cells alive

[03:33:30.000 --> 03:33:32.000]  hi I think
[03:33:32.000 --> 03:33:34.000]  Elon Musk is being
[03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:36.000]  positioned to be the kind of deal out there
[03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:38.000]  he has the public support
[03:33:38.000 --> 03:33:40.000]  because of the millennial support
[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:42.000]  and Gen Z support
[03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:44.000]  because of his involvement in crypto
[03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:46.000]  and also owns an entire
[03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:48.000]  media
[03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:50.000]  social media operation
[03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:52.000]  which is how the younger generation communicates
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:54.000]  he's involved in Starlink
[03:33:54.000 --> 03:33:56.000]  Brainship
[03:33:56.000 --> 03:33:58.000]  everything under the sun and he's trying to be positioned
[03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:00.000]  that's kind of the new Alex Jones
[03:34:00.000 --> 03:34:02.000]  additionally I wanted to say
[03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:04.000]  the basic item
[03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:06.000]  is life changing
[03:34:06.000 --> 03:34:08.000]  one thing I run into is I forget
[03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:10.000]  to
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:12.000]  rebuy it so I'll be out of it and then
[03:34:12.000 --> 03:34:14.000]  I'll listen to you when I drive or when I'm at work
[03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:16.000]  I forget to go on infowarscore and then order it
[03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:18.000]  but I figured out I can do
[03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:20.000]  60 days auto ship or 90 days auto ship
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:22.000]  or whatever you need to do that
[03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:24.000]  and say my cousin Mike
[03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:26.000]  his birthday is coming up
[03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:28.000]  and I was wondering if I could get
[03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:30.000]  Felix the Fetnall Dragon to wish Mike
[03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:32.000]  a happy birthday
[03:34:32.000 --> 03:34:34.000]  well let me think of Fetnall's around here
[03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:36.000]  anywhere
[03:34:36.000 --> 03:34:38.000]  his name's Mike
[03:34:38.000 --> 03:34:40.000]  yeah
[03:34:40.000 --> 03:34:42.000]  you're not going to have a birthday
[03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:44.000]  Mike you take your friends and go
[03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:46.000]  bye bye you stupid American
[03:34:46.000 --> 03:34:48.000]  there is no hope
[03:34:48.000 --> 03:34:50.000]  you do not get a birthday
[03:34:50.000 --> 03:34:52.000]  Mike no no no
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:54.000]  thanks Alex
[03:34:54.000 --> 03:34:56.000]  you bet brother I appreciate your call
[03:34:56.000 --> 03:34:58.000]  Jeremiah in California
[03:34:58.000 --> 03:35:00.000]  go ahead Jeremiah
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:02.000]  hello Alex
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:04.000]  welcome
[03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:06.000]  I have four points
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:08.000]  man here one of them
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:10.000]  hear out the whole thing here
[03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:12.000]  we have to
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:14.000]  if we can bring it to our bring ourselves
[03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:16.000]  to the point of forgiving the people that
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:18.000]  wrong does so badly
[03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:20.000]  in the new world order
[03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:22.000]  there's a possibility that they will see
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:24.000]  mankind go past
[03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:26.000]  the boundaries that we are limited to
[03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:28.000]  in our bodies right now
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:30.000]  and they will see what we have the potential to become
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:32.000]  and
[03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:34.000]  maybe in time
[03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:36.000]  that will be worse than anything
[03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:38.000]  that being outside the light of God
[03:35:38.000 --> 03:35:40.000]  can give them
[03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:42.000]  so but we have to do this not as a
[03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:44.000]  thing to punish them
[03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:46.000]  we have to be honest
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:48.000]  inside thing
[03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:50.000]  to
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:52.000]  seriously be the better person
[03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:54.000]  on the stuff
[03:35:54.000 --> 03:35:56.000]  and not first off with reason
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:35:58.000]  second thing about this is
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:00.000]  what Davos said they were going to do
[03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:02.000]  dispractice with last year was alien stuff
[03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:04.000]  the balloons and UFOs
[03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:06.000]  are distractions from what they are doing
[03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:08.000]  keep in mind what they were talking about this year
[03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:10.000]  is
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:12.000]  their attack on misinformation
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:14.000]  letting people get back on twitter
[03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:16.000]  and stuff it's a
[03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:18.000]  trying to keep the people in the
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:20.000]  sheep in the pen
[03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:22.000]  we can't
[03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:24.000]  try not to fall for that
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:26.000]  and love is the way
[03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:28.000]  love is the way we are going to get through this
[03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:30.000]  loving people
[03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:32.000]  and not
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:34.000]  loving people with our hearts
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:36.000]  and finally
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:38.000]  I would like to know if you can actually put some of your promotions that you put up
[03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:40.000]  as for downloads
[03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  so I can put them in my youtube account
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:44.000]  do what
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:46.000]  promotion was?
[03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:48.000]  those promotions like the one you had with the doctor
[03:36:48.000 --> 03:36:50.000]  that was talking about
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:52.000]  the
[03:36:52.000 --> 03:36:54.000]  nitrous who was talking about
[03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:56.000]  absolutely we should
[03:36:56.000 --> 03:36:58.000]  I think we have a promo page actually on Bandai video
[03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:00.000]  I don't think we put a lot of stuff up there
[03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:02.000]  we'll definitely do that thank you great points
[03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:04.000]  let's talk to Joe in Michigan
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:06.000]  Joe go ahead
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:08.000]  hi it's nice to meet you sir
[03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:10.000]  I
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:12.000]  I've been listening for 15 years
[03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:14.000]  and I've spent thousands
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:16.000]  of dollars at your store
[03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:18.000]  my favorite product is X2
[03:37:18.000 --> 03:37:20.000]  it seems to clear my mind up
[03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:22.000]  and
[03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:24.000]  it increases my vocabulary
[03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:26.000]  and my ability
[03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:28.000]  to express myself much better
[03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:30.000]  but I'd like to
[03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:32.000]  talk about war 3
[03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:34.000]  I got some
[03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:36.000]  bad news
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:38.000]  and some good news
[03:37:38.000 --> 03:37:40.000]  I've been a Christian my whole life
[03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:42.000]  I've known Christ since I was a kid
[03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:44.000]  and I was a preacher for a while
[03:37:44.000 --> 03:37:46.000]  and
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:48.000]  but the bad news I believe is that
[03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:50.000]  the United States will be
[03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:52.000]  destroyed
[03:37:52.000 --> 03:37:54.000]  and there's some biblical
[03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:56.000]  references about that in the book of Jeremiah
[03:37:56.000 --> 03:37:58.000]  but they're kind of
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:00.000]  obscure, kind of hard to
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:02.000]  pan out so to speak
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:04.000]  but the good news
[03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:06.000]  is I've been praying about this lately
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:08.000]  because you know I don't want to get
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:10.000]  blown up in a nuclear holocaust
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:12.000]  I don't want to go off that way
[03:38:12.000 --> 03:38:14.000]  and the Lord brought to my remembrance
[03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:16.000]  through the Holy Spirit
[03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:18.000]  some of the verses in the Bible
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:20.000]  and one story about Lot
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:22.000]  how God sent the angels
[03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:24.000]  to take him and his family out
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:26.000]  not just him, his family too
[03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:28.000]  and
[03:38:28.000 --> 03:38:30.000]  in twice the scriptures once in Jeremiah
[03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:32.000]  like 49 or 50
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:34.000]  he says
[03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:36.000]  come out of her my people
[03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:38.000]  and then again in
[03:38:38.000 --> 03:38:40.000]  chapter 18
[03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:42.000]  of the book of Revelation
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:44.000]  he says come out of
[03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:46.000]  her my people
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  well sure you see that also in Exodus
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:50.000]  thank you for the call great points
[03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:52.000]  let's talk to Ivan in Slovakia Eastern Europe
[03:38:52.000 --> 03:38:54.000]  thanks for calling Ivan
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:56.000]  Mr. Jones it's a pleasure
[03:38:56.000 --> 03:38:58.000]  to be on your
[03:38:58.000 --> 03:39:00.000]  show I mean it's great
[03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:02.000]  three points Mr. Jones
[03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:04.000]  first time caller long-time
[03:39:04.000 --> 03:39:06.000]  listener
[03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:08.000]  graduate in 2014
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:10.000]  and kicked on from listening to you
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:12.000]  three points
[03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:14.000]  everybody knows
[03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:16.000]  Alex Jones here
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:18.000]  I went to a cookout about a year ago
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:20.000]  multi-cultural cookout
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:22.000]  with my fellow Africans
[03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:24.000]  fellow Mexicans
[03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:26.000]  fellow Russians
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:28.000]  fellow people from India
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:30.000]  everywhere
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:32.000]  and I took off my jacket
[03:39:32.000 --> 03:39:34.000]  and I had your shirt on
[03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:36.000]  that stayed info walls in red
[03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:38.000]  it was a black shirt with info walls
[03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:40.000]  in red on the front
[03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:42.000]  and everybody shook my hand
[03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:44.000]  and everybody was in sync with me
[03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:46.000]  they knew what I was thinking
[03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:48.000]  and they knew who you were
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:50.000]  they were so
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:52.000]  I mean the conversations we had
[03:39:52.000 --> 03:39:54.000]  were exhilarating
[03:39:54.000 --> 03:39:56.000]  I mean they were amazing
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:39:58.000]  about you
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:00.000]  about your show about what you talked about
[03:40:00.000 --> 03:40:02.000]  and about disease X
[03:40:02.000 --> 03:40:04.000]  you preached about disease X
[03:40:04.000 --> 03:40:06.000]  for years and it came
[03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:08.000]  and everybody knew about it
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:10.000]  and everybody I talked to at that cookout
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:12.000]  never took a vaccine
[03:40:12.000 --> 03:40:14.000]  never took
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:16.000]  testing nothing
[03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:18.000]  they all had working people
[03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:20.000]  very respectful
[03:40:20.000 --> 03:40:22.000]  but they went on to live
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:24.000]  their lives without any
[03:40:24.000 --> 03:40:26.000]  pressure from any government
[03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:28.000]  and they never took any of those vaccines
[03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:30.000]  second point
[03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:32.000]  Mr. Jones
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:34.000]  if you know
[03:40:34.000 --> 03:40:36.000]  John the Baptist in the Bible
[03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:38.000]  screaming in the wilderness
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:40.000]  about the Messiah

[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:48.000]  paving the way for the Messiah
[03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:50.000]  well in today's world Mr. Jones

[03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:00.000]  but they can't
[03:41:00.000 --> 03:41:02.000]  they cannot
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:04.000]  because you are ordained

[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:14.000]  and it's
[03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:16.000]  right before the pandemic hit

[03:41:38.000 --> 03:41:40.000]  if you have X2
[03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:42.000]  if you have silver bullet

[03:42:32.000 --> 03:42:34.000]  with the tax on free speech

[03:42:56.000 --> 03:42:58.000]  the following is a clarification
[03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:00.000]  correction issued by
[03:43:00.000 --> 03:43:02.000]  myself Alex Jones here
[03:43:02.000 --> 03:43:04.000]  on InfoWars
[03:43:04.000 --> 03:43:06.000]  as many know I was sued by
[03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:08.000]  Miss Scarlett Lewis concerning certain
[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:10.000]  remarks I had made about the shooting
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:12.000]  and death of her son in San Diego Elementary School
[03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:14.000]  in early August of
[03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:16.000]  2022 we were in trial
[03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:18.000]  in Austin, Texas on Miss Lewis claims
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:20.000]  of defamation she filed against me
[03:43:20.000 --> 03:43:22.000]  during that trial Miss Lewis
[03:43:22.000 --> 03:43:24.000]  and her ex-husband approached me to talk
[03:43:24.000 --> 03:43:26.000]  which we did and after a brief conversation
[03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:28.000]  we shook hands later I appeared
[03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:30.000]  on Piers Morgan's television show
[03:43:30.000 --> 03:43:32.000]  talking about the trial and recounted
[03:43:32.000 --> 03:43:34.000]  the brief conversation I had
[03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:36.000]  with Miss Lewis recently I
[03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:38.000]  received a letter from Mark Bankston
[03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:40.000]  one of the lawyers for Miss Scarlett Lewis
[03:43:40.000 --> 03:43:42.000]  in the Texas San Diego trial in which
[03:43:42.000 --> 03:43:44.000]  Miss Lewis lawyer demanded
[03:43:44.000 --> 03:43:46.000]  from me a correction clarification
[03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:48.000]  or retraction of those
[03:43:48.000 --> 03:43:50.000]  few statements I had
[03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:52.000]  made in January
[03:43:52.000 --> 03:43:54.000]  of 2023 on the Piers Morgan
[03:43:54.000 --> 03:43:56.000]  show about the courtroom conversation
[03:43:56.000 --> 03:43:58.000]  with Miss Lewis and I'm happy
[03:43:58.000 --> 03:44:00.000]  to oblige first I
[03:44:00.000 --> 03:44:02.000]  want the viewing audience to understand
[03:44:02.000 --> 03:44:04.000]  what I said and what Mr.
[03:44:04.000 --> 03:44:06.000]  Mason has demanded of me
[03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:08.000]  so that my remarks today will
[03:44:08.000 --> 03:44:10.000]  clarify my retraction
[03:44:10.000 --> 03:44:12.000]  I'm going to make it's important to keep
[03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:14.000]  in mind that during the trial
[03:44:14.000 --> 03:44:16.000]  I continued to produce my live
[03:44:16.000 --> 03:44:18.000]  talk radio show on the morning
[03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:20.000]  of August 2nd 2022
[03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:22.000]  I made certain comments about
[03:44:22.000 --> 03:44:24.000]  the tragic nature of the Sandy Hook
[03:44:24.000 --> 03:44:26.000]  shooting where I confirm that Miss
[03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:28.000]  Lewis was real and the shooting was real
[03:44:28.000 --> 03:44:30.000]  and the death of her son was
[03:44:30.000 --> 03:44:32.000]  real Miss Lewis however
[03:44:32.000 --> 03:44:34.000]  was incorrectly told
[03:44:34.000 --> 03:44:36.000]  that I had attacked her as an actor
[03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:38.000]  in my broadcast and
[03:44:38.000 --> 03:44:40.000]  she so testified not having actually
[03:44:40.000 --> 03:44:42.000]  heard my on-air statements
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:44.000]  from that morning's broadcast
[03:44:44.000 --> 03:44:46.000]  I was called to testify immediately after
[03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:48.000]  Miss Lewis and I immediately corrected
[03:44:48.000 --> 03:44:50.000]  her misperception later
[03:44:50.000 --> 03:44:52.000]  that afternoon at a break
[03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:54.000]  Miss Lewis and her ex-husband walked over
[03:44:54.000 --> 03:44:56.000]  to me in the courtroom Miss Lewis
[03:44:56.000 --> 03:44:58.000]  handed me a bottle of water
[03:44:58.000 --> 03:45:00.000]  and as I recall a cough drop
[03:45:00.000 --> 03:45:02.000]  we shook hands and we exchanged cordial words
[03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:04.000]  Attorney Mark Bankston now
[03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:06.000]  wants me to retract what I remembered
[03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:08.000]  she said to me in that exchange
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:10.000]  not what I told Piers Morgan's
[03:45:10.000 --> 03:45:12.000]  audience that I said to Miss Lewis
[03:45:12.000 --> 03:45:14.000]  I'm going to quote from the letter
[03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:16.000]  Attorney Mark Bankston sent me
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:18.000]  where he repeats my words from the
[03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:20.000]  Piers Morgan show
[03:45:20.000 --> 03:45:22.000]  when I was in the Texas trial you can look at this
[03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:24.000]  they had one of the mothers on who lost her son
[03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:26.000]  and I went on my show that morning
[03:45:26.000 --> 03:45:28.000]  and taped it before I went to the court
[03:45:28.000 --> 03:45:30.000]  and I said I think she is real
[03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:32.000]  I think her son died
[03:45:32.000 --> 03:45:34.000]  I've seen her testimony the day before
[03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:36.000]  and I'm very sorry that Adam Lanza did this
[03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:38.000]  and then she went on
[03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:40.000]  the stand and said
[03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:42.000]  Jones attacked me and said I'm an actress
[03:45:42.000 --> 03:45:44.000]  and it's all fake today
[03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:46.000]  and I walked over to her during the break
[03:45:46.000 --> 03:45:48.000]  and I said watch my show from today
[03:45:48.000 --> 03:45:50.000]  your lawyers lied to you
[03:45:50.000 --> 03:45:52.000]  and the next day
[03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:54.000]  she came up and cried and shook my hand
[03:45:54.000 --> 03:45:56.000]  and it was Scarlett Lewis
[03:45:56.000 --> 03:45:58.000]  and said oh my god it's true
[03:45:58.000 --> 03:46:00.000]  I saw you did say that
[03:46:00.000 --> 03:46:02.000]  and then
[03:46:02.000 --> 03:46:04.000]  Bankston
[03:46:04.000 --> 03:46:06.000]  incorrectly quotes
[03:46:06.000 --> 03:46:08.000]  something I said after that
[03:46:08.000 --> 03:46:10.000]  as a quote attributed to her
[03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:12.000]  I said so there's a lot of manipulation there
[03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:14.000]  but they attribute that to their letter
[03:46:14.000 --> 03:46:16.000]  to something I'm saying she said
[03:46:16.000 --> 03:46:18.000]  Attorney Bankston's demand letter
[03:46:18.000 --> 03:46:20.000]  sets out his complaint as follows
[03:46:20.000 --> 03:46:22.000]  Miss Lewis never spoke those words or anything similar
[03:46:22.000 --> 03:46:24.000]  to Mr. Jones
[03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:26.000]  is disturbed that this lie was broadcast
[03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:28.000]  to millions of people
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:30.000]  exposing her to contempt and ridicule
[03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:32.000]  finally Attorney Bankston's demand letter
[03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:34.000]  concludes with criticism
[03:46:34.000 --> 03:46:36.000]  of my recollection of my conversation
[03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:38.000]  with Miss Lewis writing to me as follows
[03:46:38.000 --> 03:46:40.000]  and I quote
[03:46:40.000 --> 03:46:42.000]  Mr. Jones has now decided
[03:46:42.000 --> 03:46:44.000]  months later to lie
[03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:46.000]  about Miss Lewis again by manufacturing
[03:46:46.000 --> 03:46:48.000]  a fantasy conversation
[03:46:48.000 --> 03:46:50.000]  and spreading it to an audience of millions
[03:46:50.000 --> 03:46:52.000]  to a reputational and emotional detriment
[03:46:52.000 --> 03:46:54.000]  Attorney Bankston now demands
[03:46:54.000 --> 03:46:56.000]  that I retract my recollection
[03:46:56.000 --> 03:46:58.000]  of Miss Lewis's response to me
[03:46:58.000 --> 03:47:00.000]  which I am going to do
[03:47:00.000 --> 03:47:02.000]  but first let me say
[03:47:02.000 --> 03:47:04.000]  that I truly feel sympathy for Miss Lewis and her ex-husband
[03:47:04.000 --> 03:47:06.000]  they did sever the death of their child
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:08.000]  and I have repeatedly said this
[03:47:08.000 --> 03:47:10.000]  so my comments upset them this was the last thing
[03:47:10.000 --> 03:47:12.000]  I wanted to do
[03:47:12.000 --> 03:47:14.000]  now as to Attorney Bankston's demand
[03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:16.000]  that I retract my statement
[03:47:16.000 --> 03:47:18.000]  he quotes regarding Miss Lewis's
[03:47:18.000 --> 03:47:20.000]  response to me on August 2nd
[03:47:20.000 --> 03:47:22.000]  I have gone back and reviewed
[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:24.000]  the video available of that day's event
[03:47:24.000 --> 03:47:26.000]  and I want to show five relevant clips
[03:47:26.000 --> 03:47:28.000]  from these videos
[03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:30.000]  these clips come from August 2nd
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:32.000]  2022, number one
[03:47:32.000 --> 03:47:34.000]  shows Miss Lewis trial testimony
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:36.000]  the second video, my response
[03:47:36.000 --> 03:47:38.000]  in trial testimony
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:40.000]  third video, my actual morning
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:42.000]  on air statements
[03:47:42.000 --> 03:47:44.000]  four, the end of day brief courtroom conversation
[03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:46.000]  and handshake I had with Miss Lewis
[03:47:46.000 --> 03:47:48.000]  and finally number five
[03:47:48.000 --> 03:47:50.000]  my August 3rd, the following morning
[03:47:50.000 --> 03:47:52.000]  my court testimony
[03:47:52.000 --> 03:47:54.000]  about Miss Lewis shaking my hand
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:47:56.000]  and how much I appreciated that handshake
[03:48:02.000 --> 03:48:04.000]  I wanted to tell you
[03:48:04.000 --> 03:48:06.000]  to your face because I wanted you to know
[03:48:06.000 --> 03:48:08.000]  that I am a mother
[03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:10.000]  first and foremost
[03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:12.000]  and I know that you're a father
[03:48:12.000 --> 03:48:14.000]  and my son existed
[03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:16.000]  you're still on your show today
[03:48:16.000 --> 03:48:18.000]  trying to say that I'm
[03:48:20.000 --> 03:48:22.000]  implying
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:24.000]  that I'm an actress
[03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:26.000]  that I'm deep state
[03:48:26.000 --> 03:48:28.000]  you have this week
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:30.000]  and I don't understand
[03:48:32.000 --> 03:48:34.000]  truth, truth
[03:48:34.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  is so vital
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:38.000]  to our world, truth
[03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:40.000]  is what we base our reality on
[03:48:40.000 --> 03:48:42.000]  and
[03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:44.000]  we have to agree on that
[03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:46.000]  and we have to believe
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:48.000]  that we are a society
[03:48:48.000 --> 03:48:50.000]  Sandy Hook is a hard truth
[03:48:50.000 --> 03:48:52.000]  hard truth
[03:48:52.000 --> 03:48:54.000]  nobody would want to ever believe
[03:48:54.000 --> 03:48:56.000]  that 26
[03:48:56.000 --> 03:48:58.000]  kids could be murdered
[03:48:58.000 --> 03:49:00.000]  nobody would ever want to believe that
[03:49:00.000 --> 03:49:02.000]  I understand people not wanting to believe that actually
[03:49:02.000 --> 03:49:04.000]  I don't want to believe it
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:06.000]  Jesse was real
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:08.000]  I'm a real mom
[03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:10.000]  there's nothing out there
[03:49:10.000 --> 03:49:12.000]  nothing
[03:49:12.000 --> 03:49:14.000]  like me
[03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:16.000]  I have a history
[03:49:16.000 --> 03:49:18.000]  and there's nothing that you could have found
[03:49:18.000 --> 03:49:20.000]  because it doesn't exist
[03:49:20.000 --> 03:49:22.000]  that I'm deep state
[03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:24.000]  it's just not true
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:26.000]  I know you know that
[03:49:26.000 --> 03:49:28.000]  that's the problem
[03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:30.000]  I know you know that
[03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:32.000]  and you keep saying it
[03:49:32.000 --> 03:49:34.000]  you keep saying it
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:36.000]  why?
[03:49:36.000 --> 03:49:38.000]  for money?
[03:49:38.000 --> 03:49:40.000]  because you've made a lot of money
[03:49:40.000 --> 03:49:42.000]  you've said it
[03:49:42.000 --> 03:49:44.000]  I know you're
[03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:46.000]  I mean
[03:49:48.000 --> 03:49:50.000]  I know you believe me
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:52.000]  and yet you're going to get
[03:49:52.000 --> 03:49:54.000]  you're going to leave this courthouse
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:56.000]  and you're going to say it again
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:49:58.000]  on your show
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:00.000]  you're saying no
[03:50:00.000 --> 03:50:02.000]  you just did it
[03:50:02.000 --> 03:50:04.000]  you
[03:50:08.000 --> 03:50:10.000]  and you know before we do that
[03:50:10.000 --> 03:50:12.000]  I just do want to say this on right here
[03:50:12.000 --> 03:50:14.000]  because I've said it many times
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:16.000]  I apologize to both
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:18.000]  so Mr. Jones one of the instructions I just gave you
[03:50:18.000 --> 03:50:20.000]  that this is not a conversation
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:22.000]  that I never intentionally
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:24.000]  tried to hurt you
[03:50:24.000 --> 03:50:26.000]  I never even said your name
[03:50:26.000 --> 03:50:28.000]  until this case came to court
[03:50:28.000 --> 03:50:30.000]  I didn't even really know who you were
[03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:32.000]  years ago when all this started up
[03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:34.000]  the internet had a lot of questions
[03:50:34.000 --> 03:50:36.000]  I had questions
[03:50:36.000 --> 03:50:38.000]  and over that 6, 7 year period
[03:50:38.000 --> 03:50:40.000]  before I got sued or 6 year period
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:42.000]  it's clear you can see the whole progression
[03:50:42.000 --> 03:50:44.000]  of us the few times we covered it
[03:50:44.000 --> 03:50:46.000]  trying to actually find out what happened
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:48.000]  and
[03:50:48.000 --> 03:50:50.000]  that's really been my big frustration
[03:50:50.000 --> 03:50:52.000]  is that
[03:50:52.000 --> 03:50:54.000]  the people have said that I'm personally
[03:50:54.000 --> 03:50:56.000]  trying to hurt them or coming after them
[03:50:56.000 --> 03:50:58.000]  when I question every big event
[03:50:58.000 --> 03:51:00.000]  sometimes it turns out that we've not been
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:02.000]  told the truth
[03:51:02.000 --> 03:51:04.000]  and the perfect example
[03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:06.000]  is today where they play a 30
[03:51:06.000 --> 03:51:08.000]  or a 1 minute clip
[03:51:08.000 --> 03:51:10.000]  and I had just done that this morning
[03:51:10.000 --> 03:51:12.000]  and I knew that I said
[03:51:12.000 --> 03:51:14.000]  I believe that
[03:51:14.000 --> 03:51:16.000]  Scarlett Lewis is real
[03:51:16.000 --> 03:51:18.000]  and she's a really nice person
[03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:20.000]  and she's really a sweet person
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:22.000]  and then I went through and talked about her ex-husband too
[03:51:22.000 --> 03:51:24.000]  and then I said I believe
[03:51:24.000 --> 03:51:26.000]  they're being fed and manipulated
[03:51:26.000 --> 03:51:28.000]  and this is the perfect
[03:51:28.000 --> 03:51:30.000]  this is the perfect example
[03:51:30.000 --> 03:51:32.000]  do you feel that the video clip
[03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:34.000]  was a fair representation of
[03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:36.000]  what you meant to convey?
[03:51:36.000 --> 03:51:38.000]  no it had the front and back
[03:51:38.000 --> 03:51:40.000]  no
[03:51:40.000 --> 03:51:42.000]  and why wasn't it there?
[03:51:42.000 --> 03:51:44.000]  because it had the front and back
[03:51:44.000 --> 03:51:46.000]  cut off of it to totally misrepresent
[03:51:46.000 --> 03:51:48.000]  the apology at the end
[03:51:48.000 --> 03:51:50.000]  and at the first where I said
[03:51:50.000 --> 03:51:52.000]  I believe she's a real person and lost
[03:51:52.000 --> 03:51:54.000]  her child so someone edited that
[03:51:54.000 --> 03:51:56.000]  and then showed it to her
[03:51:56.000 --> 03:51:58.000]  and then they brought it in here and played it
[03:51:58.000 --> 03:52:00.000]  to show it to you and I think you should
[03:52:00.000 --> 03:52:02.000]  ask to see the full segment
[03:52:08.000 --> 03:52:10.000]  oh and I gotta say this
[03:52:10.000 --> 03:52:12.000]  I've now met Neil Haslund and his ex-wife
[03:52:12.000 --> 03:52:14.000]  those people are real
[03:52:14.000 --> 03:52:16.000]  once I saw him in person
[03:52:16.000 --> 03:52:18.000]  a lot of anomalies the government lies so much
[03:52:18.000 --> 03:52:20.000]  they have a right to question things
[03:52:20.000 --> 03:52:22.000]  I thought Jesse Smollett was a lie
[03:52:22.000 --> 03:52:24.000]  first went on a limb
[03:52:24.000 --> 03:52:26.000]  I was right
[03:52:26.000 --> 03:52:28.000]  most of the time I'm right
[03:52:28.000 --> 03:52:30.000]  we saw anomalies I wasn't the first to bring up the anomalies
[03:52:30.000 --> 03:52:32.000]  some of the anomalies are going to be a fraud
[03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:34.000]  I've spent days
[03:52:34.000 --> 03:52:36.000]  literally seven feet
[03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:38.000]  eight feet away from Haslund
[03:52:38.000 --> 03:52:40.000]  because we're sitting right there, they're sitting right there
[03:52:40.000 --> 03:52:42.000]  that guy's real
[03:52:42.000 --> 03:52:44.000]  if my asking questions about public events
[03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:54.000]  and anomalies I'm sorry
[03:53:14.000 --> 03:53:16.000]  I hope you say that
[03:53:16.000 --> 03:53:18.000]  and then slow
[03:53:18.000 --> 03:53:20.000]  no I'm slow
[03:53:20.000 --> 03:53:22.000]  yeah
[03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:24.000]  I'll be back
[03:53:24.000 --> 03:53:26.000]  I'll be back
[03:53:26.000 --> 03:53:28.000]  I'll be back
[03:53:28.000 --> 03:53:30.000]  I'll be back
[03:53:30.000 --> 03:53:32.000]  that's it you're not talking anymore
[03:53:32.000 --> 03:53:34.000]  you're not doing this
[03:53:34.000 --> 03:53:36.000]  that's not even a thought
[03:53:36.000 --> 03:53:38.000]  that's not the way this goes
[03:53:38.000 --> 03:53:40.000]  no worship on you
[03:53:40.000 --> 03:53:42.000]  why do you can't feed a fake video anymore
[03:53:42.000 --> 03:53:44.000]  thank you
[03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:08.000]  and that he's slow
[03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:10.000]  no I'm slow
[03:54:10.000 --> 03:54:12.000]  yeah
[03:54:12.000 --> 03:54:14.000]  that's my place to be honest on here
[03:54:14.000 --> 03:54:16.000]  I think the government
[03:54:16.000 --> 03:54:18.000]  all the stuff you said have been manipulated
[03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:20.000]  so that's it
[03:54:20.000 --> 03:54:22.000]  you're not doing this
[03:54:22.000 --> 03:54:24.000]  that's not even a thought, that's not the way this goes
[03:54:24.000 --> 03:54:26.000]  no worship on you
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:34.000]  I'm actually proud of the fact that
[03:54:34.000 --> 03:54:36.000]  I got a chance to
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:38.000]  have
[03:54:38.000 --> 03:54:40.000]  Charlotte come over to me
[03:54:40.000 --> 03:54:42.000]  and shake my hand
[03:54:42.000 --> 03:54:44.000]  and talk to me yesterday
[03:54:44.000 --> 03:54:46.000]  face to face
[03:54:46.000 --> 03:54:48.000]  hopefully after watching
[03:54:48.000 --> 03:54:50.000]  these actual video clips
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:52.000]  several matters are clear
[03:54:52.000 --> 03:54:54.000]  first it shows
[03:54:54.000 --> 03:54:56.000]  that the trial testimony of Miss Lewis
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:54:58.000]  about her understanding of my on-air statements earlier
[03:54:58.000 --> 03:55:00.000]  in the morning of trial
[03:55:00.000 --> 03:55:02.000]  was wrong
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:04.000]  I told her in the courtroom
[03:55:04.000 --> 03:55:06.000]  that I had not attacked her that day
[03:55:06.000 --> 03:55:08.000]  as the video of my actual
[03:55:08.000 --> 03:55:10.000]  on-air statements that morning demonstrate
[03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:12.000]  second
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:14.000]  my on-air video clip that morning
[03:55:14.000 --> 03:55:16.000]  demonstrates that I clearly said
[03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:18.000]  that I know you're real
[03:55:18.000 --> 03:55:20.000]  and I know that the death of your son is real
[03:55:20.000 --> 03:55:22.000]  third
[03:55:22.000 --> 03:55:24.000]  these clips show that after my testimony
[03:55:24.000 --> 03:55:26.000]  that day in the courtroom
[03:55:26.000 --> 03:55:28.000]  I had a conversation that was initiated
[03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:30.000]  by Miss Lewis that ended with Miss Lewis
[03:55:30.000 --> 03:55:32.000]  and me shaking hands
[03:55:32.000 --> 03:55:34.000]  and her ex-husband and I shaking hands
[03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:36.000]  unfortunately
[03:55:36.000 --> 03:55:38.000]  the audio I have of these changes
[03:55:38.000 --> 03:55:40.000]  is poor and you cannot hear much of what we're saying
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:42.000]  but it seems clear that while
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:44.000]  we were shaking hands we were talking
[03:55:44.000 --> 03:55:46.000]  and while they are not all recorded
[03:55:46.000 --> 03:55:48.000]  as the one I just showed
[03:55:48.000 --> 03:55:50.000]  I had several courthouse
[03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:52.000]  conversations with Miss Lewis and all of them
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:54.000]  were polite and civil
[03:55:54.000 --> 03:55:56.000]  to be clear and clarify
[03:55:56.000 --> 03:55:58.000]  I had multiple discussions at least three
[03:55:58.000 --> 03:56:00.000]  with Scarlet Lewis and her husband
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:02.000]  we only caught it on tape one time
[03:56:02.000 --> 03:56:04.000]  and what I said on Pierce Morgan was a
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:06.000]  composite of those discussions
[03:56:06.000 --> 03:56:08.000]  it is the precise
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:10.000]  words that Miss Lewis and I
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:12.000]  exchanged before and after our handshake
[03:56:12.000 --> 03:56:14.000]  that attorney bankson now objects to
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:16.000]  and wants me to retract
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:18.000]  which I am glad to do
[03:56:18.000 --> 03:56:20.000]  I do not wish to harm or damage Miss Lewis
[03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:22.000]  in any way and if she does not agree
[03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:24.000]  with my recollection of her response to me
[03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:26.000]  I will defer to Miss Lewis recollection
[03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:28.000]  of her statements and withdraw
[03:56:28.000 --> 03:56:30.000]  and disclaim my recollections
[03:56:30.000 --> 03:56:32.000]  of what she said in our conversation
[03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:34.000]  while I am sure of what I told
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:36.000]  Miss Lewis I defer entirely
[03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:38.000]  to her recollection of what she said in response
[03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:40.000]  and if she disagrees then I will
[03:56:40.000 --> 03:56:42.000]  withdraw and retract my recollection
[03:56:42.000 --> 03:56:44.000]  of her comments
[03:56:44.000 --> 03:56:46.000]  in conclusion I want to emphasize
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:48.000]  that I have no ill will
[03:56:48.000 --> 03:56:50.000]  ill feelings or any malice
[03:56:50.000 --> 03:56:52.000]  towards Miss Lewis or her ex-husband
[03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:54.000]  I know and understand
[03:56:54.000 --> 03:56:56.000]  they have suffered a tragedy with the murder of their son
[03:56:56.000 --> 03:56:58.000]  and I do not wish
[03:56:58.000 --> 03:57:00.000]  to cause them any further grief
[03:57:00.000 --> 03:57:02.000]  harm or embarrassment
[03:57:02.000 --> 03:57:04.000]  I once again would like to invite them to come
[03:57:04.000 --> 03:57:06.000]  on my show
[03:57:06.000 --> 03:57:08.000]  to promote their charity and to talk about their son's life
[03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:10.000]  if they so choose
[03:57:10.000 --> 03:57:12.000]  I am also trying to reach an agreement
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:14.000]  for another appearance on Pierce Morgan's show
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:16.000]  to let his audience hear this clarification
[03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:28.000]  and correction
[03:57:47.000 --> 03:57:49.000]  Info Wars MD is finally here
[03:57:49.000 --> 03:57:52.000]  it is the very same high quality products
[03:57:52.000 --> 03:57:54.000]  you have been getting through Info Wars Life
[03:57:54.000 --> 03:57:56.000]  but an expanded catalog
[03:57:56.000 --> 03:57:58.000]  and in some cases the prices are lower
[03:57:58.000 --> 03:58:00.000]  because we are going directly
[03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:02.000]  to the source that was
[03:58:02.000 --> 03:58:04.000]  supplying the supplement companies
[03:58:04.000 --> 03:58:06.000]  that we were buying our high quality products from
[03:58:06.000 --> 03:58:08.000]  so we are able to lower prices
[03:58:08.000 --> 03:58:10.000]  and bring you more products
[03:58:10.000 --> 03:58:12.000]  via the Info Wars MD line
[03:58:12.000 --> 03:58:14.000]  the highest quality
[03:58:14.000 --> 03:58:16.000]  triple tested
[03:58:16.000 --> 03:58:18.000]  many of these products are sold on store shelves
[03:58:18.000 --> 03:58:20.000]  for more than twice the cost
[03:58:20.000 --> 03:58:22.000]  you will get them at infowarstore.com
[03:58:22.000 --> 03:58:24.000]  under our exclusive label

[03:58:36.000 --> 03:58:38.000]  so again, introducing Info Wars MD
[03:58:38.000 --> 03:58:40.000]  now exclusively available
[03:58:40.000 --> 03:58:42.000]  at infowarstore.com
[03:58:42.000 --> 03:58:44.000]  massive, massive sales
[03:58:47.000 --> 03:58:49.000]  Info Wars is winning
[03:58:49.000 --> 03:58:51.000]  Info Wars is reaching more people than ever
[03:58:51.000 --> 03:58:54.000]  we were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago
[03:58:54.000 --> 03:58:56.000]  mainstream media told you but it is not true
[03:58:56.000 --> 03:58:58.000]  they told you we were going to be shut down
[03:58:58.000 --> 03:59:00.000]  they told you we owed a billion and a half dollars
[03:59:00.000 --> 03:59:02.000]  none of that is true
[03:59:02.000 --> 03:59:04.000]  it is all being appealed
[03:59:04.000 --> 03:59:06.000]  they want you to think Info Wars is dead
[03:59:06.000 --> 03:59:08.000]  but if you simply stand up and support Info Wars
[03:59:08.000 --> 03:59:10.000]  we have got years and years of appeals
[03:59:10.000 --> 03:59:12.000]  and we will not be taken off the air
[03:59:12.000 --> 03:59:14.000]  but if they can convince you that we have been shut down
[03:59:14.000 --> 03:59:16.000]  they are going to win
[03:59:16.000 --> 03:59:18.000]  don't let the globalists sigh up you and your family
