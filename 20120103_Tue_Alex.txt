[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:31.400]  well it's caucus day in Iowa it's all kicking off and the molders and
[00:31.400 --> 00:36.840]  manipulators of perception and got all these articles out about poll show
[00:36.840 --> 00:43.400]  landslide for mr. abortion mr. open borders mr. carbon tax mr. Obamacare
[00:43.400 --> 00:49.480]  author Mitt Romney all part of the perception management but actually went
[00:49.480 --> 00:54.320]  and looked at more than 10 polls this morning all scientific and Ron Paul is
[00:54.320 --> 01:02.680]  winning five of them and mr. Romney is winning the other five so it is a dead
[01:02.680 --> 01:09.920]  heat if you look at a spectrum of polls there and their photo finish where
[01:09.920 --> 01:13.120]  they've got to you know take that snapshot at the Indy 500 or at the horse
[01:13.120 --> 01:18.560]  race to see which car which horses nose was an inch ahead it's like instant
[01:18.560 --> 01:27.960]  replay did they get the first down on that play but instead the Psyop is
[01:27.960 --> 01:33.640]  running to try to make Iowans feel like well I want to vote for the winner you
[01:33.640 --> 01:39.160]  know I liked Ron Paul but you know they say Romney's gonna win so I better just
[01:39.160 --> 01:43.920]  go ahead and vote for him and after all they say that Iowa is so important but
[01:43.920 --> 01:49.920]  not of Ron Paul wins it does credits Iowa I better vote for Romney and of
[01:49.920 --> 01:56.240]  course even if Paul wins now they're having secret counting of the different
[01:56.240 --> 02:02.960]  precinct tallies at a secret location because anonymous has come to town and
[02:02.960 --> 02:08.440]  is protesting Ron Paul and is threatening to shut down and hack things
[02:08.440 --> 02:14.200]  now anonymous is just some blank wall that good people can do political action
[02:14.200 --> 02:18.280]  under and bad people can but I've always said anything that calls itself
[02:18.280 --> 02:23.520]  anonymous and doesn't have a manifesto is dangerous because then the system can
[02:23.520 --> 02:26.800]  do things in your name kind of like Occupy Wall Street was not supposed to
[02:26.800 --> 02:33.000]  have any political basis any political standing we're just against Wall Street
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.160]  which then translated against capitalism and it turned out it was the
[02:37.160 --> 02:40.880]  White House that was George Soros behind it but they left it as a blank slate so
[02:40.880 --> 02:46.640]  good people would show up diverse crowds so they could then project their
[02:46.640 --> 02:52.160]  ideas of controlled opposition on to them it didn't work so the government
[02:52.160 --> 02:56.320]  first was endorsing and saying come out and take over and we'll pass more taxes
[02:56.320 --> 02:59.680]  to give you what you want but as soon as we went in and woke them up to end the
[02:59.680 --> 03:05.040]  Fed in the New World Order and now the mega rich the mega elite use big
[03:05.040 --> 03:08.720]  government to shut down their competition they flushed Occupy Wall
[03:08.720 --> 03:12.360]  Street down the toilet and demonized it everywhere and now you don't hear about
[03:12.360 --> 03:18.360]  it that was an attempt at triggering a revolution before the real one comes
[03:18.360 --> 03:23.200]  very very simple that's what they're doing it's elementary but the general
[03:23.200 --> 03:27.880]  public is just now starting to get it and the truth is there we've just got to
[03:27.880 --> 03:33.320]  get it out to everyone now obviously we're gonna break down more of NDA a the
[03:33.320 --> 03:38.160]  huge developments in Iran right out of the break a Marine facing a whole bunch
[03:38.160 --> 03:41.760]  of time in prison for walking into the airport and saying I'm here to check my
[03:41.760 --> 03:47.280]  gun which is totally legal in almost every state but they just pounced on him
[03:47.280 --> 03:50.320]  and are throwing the book at him because the system is geared towards law
[03:50.320 --> 03:56.360]  abiding gun owners and particularly veterans so we're gonna be breaking all
[03:56.360 --> 04:00.520]  of that down today as well and I have another London independent article here
[04:00.520 --> 04:06.400]  cracked down on small firms a blind eye for big businesses and this is a
[04:06.400 --> 04:11.200]  breakdown out of England but I've seen similar articles here in the United
[04:11.200 --> 04:17.520]  States where they've almost cut down to nothing IRS enforcers on big fortune
[04:17.520 --> 04:23.640]  100 who were basically exempt and pay no taxes but the general public in fact
[04:23.640 --> 04:28.880]  blue collar workers are having the book thrown at them and then lower middle
[04:28.880 --> 04:33.440]  class and middle middle class and upper middle class are being hammered
[04:33.440 --> 04:38.560]  absolutely hammered you're making $40,000 a year IRS constantly says people
[04:38.560 --> 04:45.400]  letters saying oh we calculated you $2,000 more squeezing the little guy
[04:45.400 --> 04:49.640]  we'll be right back I'm gonna open the phones up in this first hour we've got a
[04:49.640 --> 04:54.440]  lot of big guests today we got Ron Paul's brother joining us we've also got

[05:01.880 --> 05:06.240]  of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[05:06.240 --> 05:11.240]  chance to not relive history as they're finishing off this agenda they'll be
[05:11.240 --> 05:14.840]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in its
[05:14.840 --> 05:19.880]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[05:19.880 --> 05:25.280]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[05:25.280 --> 05:30.200]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[05:30.200 --> 05:34.600]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[05:34.600 --> 05:38.320]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.280]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[05:42.280 --> 05:47.920]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[08:35.000 --> 08:40.800]  election the Iowa caucuses we're gonna be tracking this throughout the three
[08:40.800 --> 08:46.080]  hours and on info wars nightly news tonight seven o'clock transmitted from
[08:46.080 --> 08:53.920]  info wars news dot com and we have Wayne Paul brother of congressman Ron Paul
[08:53.920 --> 09:00.280]  joining us to talk about his view of what's happening in this country Wayne is
[09:00.280 --> 09:06.400]  a longtime anti-fetal reserve anti-New World Order activist and we'll get Wayne
[09:06.400 --> 09:10.920]  to also give us his take on who Ron Paul really is and what he thinks of all of
[09:10.920 --> 09:15.160]  these attacks Emil open the phones up she'll have a chance to talk to Wayne
[09:15.160 --> 09:23.440]  Paul that is coming up today I have a New Year's resolution that when I do take
[09:23.440 --> 09:27.800]  calls I want to go to them quickly and I want to take a lot of them and I have a
[09:27.800 --> 09:35.680]  tendency to get so caught up myopically in news and an analysis and in
[09:35.680 --> 09:40.600]  basically ranting and raving that I don't go to as many calls as I'd like
[09:40.600 --> 09:44.640]  to because there's only one person that's my boss here on the radio and
[09:44.640 --> 09:51.960]  that's that's unfortunately Alex Jones I'm actually an old hand at radio and
[09:51.960 --> 09:59.000]  doing it almost 17 years will be 17 years in about a month but I I tend to
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.600]  like the shows where I mix it up with audio and video clips and analysis and
[10:03.600 --> 10:08.600]  different news items and cover some science and technology and cover some
[10:08.600 --> 10:12.680]  news of the strange and take a lot of calls and have interesting guests on
[10:12.680 --> 10:19.280]  that's the shows that I like and I go off of what I like now listeners have told
[10:19.280 --> 10:22.560]  me they like it when I rant and rave for two hours straight I understand that
[10:22.560 --> 10:27.720]  but callers are so good because they take us in different directions they
[10:27.720 --> 10:32.640]  raise issues I wasn't aware of a lot of times they bring up local news that we
[10:32.640 --> 10:37.720]  then go find write an article about and the next it's on the drudge report so
[10:37.720 --> 10:42.080]  calls are key and my New Year's resolution is to work more of them into
[10:42.080 --> 10:49.240]  the show so here's the deal I'm going to give the number out and I'm going to go
[10:49.240 --> 10:53.800]  to your calls in this segment and throughout the hour interspersed with
[10:53.800 --> 11:01.040]  with key news we're gonna have a lot of calls for Wayne Paul CPA political
[11:01.040 --> 11:06.520]  activist patriot as well and then we're gonna have open phones again in the
[11:06.520 --> 11:12.480]  third hour I was gonna have Jack Baldwin's son is a great patriot on but
[11:12.480 --> 11:15.000]  so much is going on with the caucuses I want to talk about states rights with
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.440]  them I'm gonna work on getting him on tomorrow or on the nightly news because
[11:18.440 --> 11:21.560]  I'd let the note I think the producers will it said get him on today and I
[11:21.560 --> 11:27.000]  meant tomorrow so we're gonna work on doing that to tomorrow apologize to Mr.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.560]  Baldwin because I want to be able to cover the news in the third hour and
[11:31.560 --> 11:40.960]  take your calls here is the toll-free number to join us 1-800-259-9231
[11:40.960 --> 11:46.040]  obviously I'd like to get your take on the presidential election on the
[11:46.040 --> 11:50.040]  Republican saying that they're going to count the votes in secret to protect its
[11:50.040 --> 11:55.680]  integrity see that's the riddle hidden in plain view of national security you
[11:55.680 --> 12:00.880]  let the government operate in secret and have unlimited funds in power and now
[12:00.880 --> 12:04.920]  they're saying we'll kill us citizens will secretly arrest you for national
[12:04.920 --> 12:09.160]  security we're overthrowing the bill of rights and constitution which is the
[12:09.160 --> 12:16.480]  country so the force you set up to supposedly protect the country is what
[12:16.480 --> 12:21.960]  always ends up being used in Rome and many other civilizations and empires to
[12:21.960 --> 12:27.040]  bring it down our founding fathers all of them wrote articles and books and gave
[12:27.040 --> 12:32.080]  speeches where they talked about at nauseam the United States will not fall
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.400]  from without no army can stand against us we have an armed informed citizenry
[12:37.400 --> 12:41.320]  who's ready to fight they just beat in the greatest empire in the world who
[12:41.320 --> 12:46.520]  never been defeated a ragtag band beat them because they were willing to fight
[12:46.520 --> 12:53.160]  they said we will only fall from within and the system ministers the public and
[12:53.160 --> 13:00.560]  says Iran's gonna nuke you if you don't you know elect Mitt Romney or Santorum
[13:00.560 --> 13:05.560]  that was the talking point on talk radio nationally and locally and I just
[13:05.560 --> 13:10.440]  thought here's Israel rumored to have 800 nuclear weapons confirmed to have
[13:10.440 --> 13:17.040]  over 400 cruise missiles submarines ICBM delivery systems
[13:17.040 --> 13:21.960]  Knesset statements about Europe better do what we want we've got nukes I mean
[13:21.960 --> 13:25.360]  Israel's one of the biggest nuclear powers in the world with a super high tech
[13:25.360 --> 13:30.840]  system and nobody is gonna mess with them people say oh well the Iranians want
[13:30.840 --> 13:35.440]  war right now they're crazy they think it's the end of the world funny I see
[13:35.440 --> 13:39.560]  Christian websites I see comments on my videos and I go to the people's YouTube
[13:39.560 --> 13:44.920]  channels and they're like praise the Lord I want Armageddon to begin nuke the
[13:44.920 --> 13:50.800]  Middle East now well Iran's not even in the Middle East but you can't even
[13:50.800 --> 13:54.800]  basically explain that to some people
[13:54.800 --> 14:00.760]  I ran has sat there and taken the West Israel the US and England blowing up
[14:00.760 --> 14:04.840]  their military bases in the last five years five years ago Bush put out a
[14:04.840 --> 14:10.760]  White House press release that we covered here on air saying the White
[14:10.760 --> 14:15.840]  House has activated four freedom fighting groups out of Iraq to attack and
[14:15.840 --> 14:22.120]  destabilize Iran and those groups are all except for the Kurd group Al Qaeda
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.560]  same Al Qaeda our government has now used to take over Libya and has now used
[14:26.560 --> 14:31.280]  to begin the invasion of Syria on record and now it's in what Associated Press
[14:31.280 --> 14:37.840]  press TV and other publications today at the United States on the Lebanese that
[14:37.840 --> 14:41.280]  is the banks that project our country
[14:41.280 --> 14:48.240]  headline US setting up buffer zone on Lebanon Syrian border so the invasion
[14:48.240 --> 14:52.600]  beachhead is now starting that's what they called it of the invasion with US
[14:52.600 --> 14:56.000]  British and other troops backing up the invasion of Libya they called it
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.680]  humanitarian corridors they they're setting up a humanitarian like the
[15:00.680 --> 15:05.560]  humanitarian love bombs and now Obama says he doesn't need congressional
[15:05.560 --> 15:11.880]  approval or even debate or even consultation first it's no declaration
[15:11.880 --> 15:16.120]  of war then it's congressional approval then his congressional consultation and
[15:16.120 --> 15:21.440]  now I don't need your stinking consultation and now the Congress is
[15:21.440 --> 15:26.960]  voted no Obama has signed it the NDAA to empower the president to secretly
[15:26.960 --> 15:32.000]  arrest or kill US citizens in the US or anywhere in the world torture you name
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.480]  it Congress is just seeding all of its power now again Obama himself this is a
[15:38.480 --> 15:42.280]  paradox is a teleprompter reading puppet who's on vacation probably 10 days
[15:42.280 --> 15:46.240]  out of the month on average more vacation than George W. Bush because their
[15:46.240 --> 15:51.280]  puppets Bill Clinton was hardly ever on vacation and when he was he was working
[15:51.280 --> 15:55.400]  because he was a such a wicked globalist that they actually trusted him to
[15:55.400 --> 15:59.920]  actually run things Bill Clinton people say the last president was Kennedy
[15:59.920 --> 16:04.200]  that's not true Kennedy was a president that didn't follow the globalist orders
[16:04.200 --> 16:11.400]  and try to be president they killed him Clinton is the is the last president and
[16:11.400 --> 16:15.040]  George Herbert Walker Bush to a certain extent as well actually ran things but
[16:15.040 --> 16:19.640]  Clinton was the last one to really run things because they're like well you're
[16:19.640 --> 16:24.760]  anti-freedom anti-America anti-Second Amendment total global communist for the
[16:24.760 --> 16:29.920]  megabanks to destroy all competition take over we are gonna let you run
[16:29.920 --> 16:34.400]  things and Clinton would reportedly sleep about three hours a night and was
[16:34.400 --> 16:39.280]  involved in every major decision the point is the power structure the
[16:39.280 --> 16:45.360]  bureaucracy wants the executive to have dictator powers and that's what they're
[16:45.360 --> 16:50.200]  doing now and it's so dangerous words cannot describe it so I want to ask
[16:50.200 --> 16:53.680]  callers what do you make of it and of course Lou Rockwell is pointing it out
[16:53.680 --> 16:57.600]  many others are pointing out this looks super suspicious that they're taking the
[16:57.600 --> 17:04.080]  voting behind closed doors and now saying it's gonna be a Romney landslide
[17:04.080 --> 17:08.760]  but all the polls show Ron Paul in first or second place they're now creating the
[17:08.760 --> 17:12.280]  hoax that nope it's a landslide everybody turned against Paul are they
[17:12.280 --> 17:15.520]  getting ready for a big scam because you know they'll do it I mean these are
[17:15.520 --> 17:21.520]  criminals I want to ask you about that I also want to ask you why do you think the
[17:21.520 --> 17:25.000]  system is openly getting rid of the Bill of Rights in Constitution and openly
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.040]  announcing they're gonna get rid of the First Amendment and have selective
[17:28.040 --> 17:34.200]  internet Chinese style internet kill switches why do you think they're moving
[17:34.200 --> 17:39.960]  so fast now and the tyrants are coming out of the closet let's go to your phone
[17:39.960 --> 17:46.360]  calls Thomas in Illinois you're on the year welcome Alex I'll I'll start your
[17:46.360 --> 17:53.160]  car for you anytime brother thank you well what's on your mind just a couple
[17:53.160 --> 18:01.720]  things here I just wanted to first give give out some props to Stitcher I'm
[18:01.720 --> 18:06.440]  listening on my iPhone app but I first found you through Stitcher you've heard
[18:06.440 --> 18:10.240]  about them I know there's a whole bunch of different systems that list every
[18:10.240 --> 18:15.800]  online radio venue in the known galaxy and but no I haven't heard of that
[18:15.800 --> 18:22.040]  particular one yeah that's how I got you about it about a year ago one quick
[18:22.040 --> 18:27.160]  thing and I'll let you go do you think that that Ron Paul should actually have
[18:27.160 --> 18:34.280]  Secret Service Protection and he is one two or three in every single poll yes but
[18:34.280 --> 18:39.040]  but but again that's another paradox it's normally the Secret Service that'll
[18:39.040 --> 18:42.680]  actually bust a cap in you and then they'll have some little patsy who's
[18:42.680 --> 18:46.160]  drugged up out of their mind who they later tell you when they wake up from
[18:46.160 --> 18:50.960]  the amnesiac like Sirhan Sirhan or others oh you did that did you know that
[18:50.960 --> 18:54.880]  and of course court documents even come out on Sirhan Sirhan that was a stage
[18:54.880 --> 18:59.600]  deal the LAPD knew it was the government they detained the guy who was
[18:59.600 --> 19:04.960]  actually seen shooting RFK but again it just becomes a conspiracy theory because
[19:04.960 --> 19:10.160]  we all know the government wouldn't do wrong so yes Ron Paul should have Secret
[19:10.160 --> 19:14.640]  Service Protection as the you know leading Republican candidate
[19:14.640 --> 19:19.040]  undoubtedly but you don't want Secret Service Protection because they would
[19:19.040 --> 19:22.720]  just put guys in there that would step aside for him to get blown away and
[19:22.720 --> 19:26.960]  undoubtedly spy on Ron Paul so if I was Ron Paul I would not accept Secret
[19:26.960 --> 19:32.360]  Service Protection right right it at least the only really good thing about
[19:32.360 --> 19:37.160]  it was actually give people a second thought of like hey you you really can
[19:37.160 --> 19:41.800]  win well look it's a mind game and and and look the globalist are almost out of
[19:41.800 --> 19:46.240]  political bullets great points before if they said somebody couldn't win he
[19:46.240 --> 19:49.400]  would have gone nowhere but they've said he can't win he can't win he can't win
[19:49.400 --> 19:52.640]  and he's at the front of the pack so now they're pulling out all the stops

[24:07.280 --> 24:12.240]  by the way later we're gonna play the clip of this Fox News talk radio they've
[24:12.240 --> 24:15.760]  all got a talking point going you've heard it in the last month that the Iowa
[24:15.760 --> 24:20.560]  governor said the same thing that if Paul bots give Ron Paul the victory in
[24:20.560 --> 24:25.440]  Iowa they're just going to ignore it and that they've basically changed the
[24:25.440 --> 24:35.320]  rules in the Republican electoral process and that they'll just have a
[24:35.320 --> 24:40.080]  brokered convention and they have changed the rules so this just shows you
[24:40.080 --> 24:44.520]  who the rulers of the Republican Party are I was actually having dinner with
[24:44.520 --> 24:49.800]  one of Rand Paul's staffers or lunch the other day and he was he was here in
[24:49.800 --> 24:57.480]  town and you know he was talking about how just to get Rand into the the the
[24:57.480 --> 25:03.520]  Republican town hall meetings early on in Kentucky they had to get thousands of
[25:03.520 --> 25:07.880]  Ron Paul Rand Paul supporters to threaten to stop giving Republicans
[25:07.880 --> 25:15.760]  donations to even get him in the events even when he had already shown in the
[25:15.760 --> 25:19.440]  polls that he was gonna win the primary I mean that's how these people operate
[25:19.440 --> 25:24.560]  they will do anything to keep real libertarian constitutional conservatives
[25:24.560 --> 25:29.600]  out here is the headline Republican insider GOP establishment planning to
[25:29.600 --> 25:35.160]  subvert Iowa to prevent Ron Paul win and so we're gonna be breaking all of this
[25:35.160 --> 25:39.080]  down and then I saw another analyst last night on Fox saying oh well if he does
[25:39.080 --> 25:45.600]  when we're just gonna ignore it this is mind control speaking of mind control
[25:45.600 --> 25:49.240]  I'm gonna play some clips we put together after I take more calls in the
[25:49.240 --> 25:53.920]  next segment of the John Huntsman ad and we've actually gone and pulled world
[25:53.920 --> 25:58.520]  leaders calling for global government and and saying that New World Order means
[25:58.520 --> 26:02.160]  global government including George Herbert Walker Bush talking about New
[26:02.160 --> 26:07.360]  World Order and then separately Huntsman is spending most of his campaign
[26:07.360 --> 26:13.360]  money in Iowa playing clips from my films with Ron Paul talking about the
[26:13.360 --> 26:17.240]  New World Order and George Herbert Walker Bush saying New World Order and
[26:17.240 --> 26:21.840]  basically implying that Ron Paul's insane so I'm gonna show you the clip and
[26:21.840 --> 26:26.040]  then I'm going to show you the world leaders saying what Ron Paul said they
[26:26.040 --> 26:31.600]  said so if Ron Paul walks out and says the sky is blue but these people say it
[26:31.600 --> 26:35.840]  isn't you're supposed to ignore your lying eyes they think your mindless
[26:35.840 --> 26:43.560]  children they treat you like you're a lobotomized jellyfish they have disdain
[26:43.560 --> 26:48.880]  for you because they sit up there with an appeal to authority in their suits on
[26:48.880 --> 26:55.080]  television looking into a camera and so there's an appeal to authority and it
[26:55.080 --> 27:03.000]  must be true that is so insulting alright I'm going back to your calls Brian in
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.240]  Pennsylvania you're on the air welcome hello Alex big fan of yours whether you
[27:08.240 --> 27:11.000]  know it or not you were part of my intelligence network since you've been
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.480]  public years ago I run a counter terror criminal espionage unit called Aqua
[27:15.480 --> 27:21.440]  Delta 69 I was offered to work for their killing teams Cobra Vector 1 in 1978
[27:21.440 --> 27:26.120]  and 79 is a silent killer both sniper martial artists I've investigated
[27:26.120 --> 27:30.440]  starting with our local police state police department we had New Jersey in
[27:30.440 --> 27:37.400]  1969 and I have continued on with the investigation we can prove team B
[27:37.400 --> 27:42.040]  zebra rattler to kill John Kennedy we have overwhelming evidence to prove it
[27:42.040 --> 27:45.960]  and confessions right from British MI 6 that the Queen of England ordered his
[27:45.960 --> 27:49.880]  assassination everything you say is right on the money well I know that E.
[27:49.880 --> 27:58.520]  Howard Hunt who ran assassination squads on record before he died went public and
[27:58.520 --> 28:07.240]  said that he had run the operation and that dovetailed with LBJ's widow that is
[28:07.240 --> 28:12.320]  mistress who on record was his mistress dattle and Madeline Duncan Brown I'm
[28:12.320 --> 28:17.200]  going for memory here and then we also have his lawyer who went public
[28:17.200 --> 28:21.640]  McClellan and said that LBJ said that he'd had him killed and then people spun
[28:21.640 --> 28:28.320]  that and said well Alex is saying that LBJ ordered the hit and it didn't go
[28:28.320 --> 28:33.880]  above LBJ no all of my sources were under LBJ and that's as high as our
[28:33.880 --> 28:38.520]  confirmation goes but I'd like you to send me some information oh definitely
[28:38.520 --> 28:41.120]  I've tried to send you in the past I don't know if you got it the Queen of
[28:41.120 --> 28:45.000]  England ordered it MI 6 made confessions Bob Fletcher I'm gonna name
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.400]  him on the air Bob Fletcher has a picture of the unit one month before
[28:48.400 --> 28:53.240]  they killed JFK Oswald was Patsy just like he said he was he was working for
[28:53.240 --> 28:58.320]  the ONI CIA and FBI all right sir well I don't know who Bob Fletcher is but I
[28:58.320 --> 29:03.120]  don't want to listen just mail me a letter then with the information if he
[29:03.120 --> 29:07.600]  gets lost in the thousands of emails or send it again to show tips and info

[29:11.560 --> 29:15.880]  I mean I'm not doubting the government tries to hire former military people to
[29:15.880 --> 29:26.080]  be assassins because just separately in my own family I know that most of the
[29:26.080 --> 29:31.320]  people who were Army officers in my family were approached to be domestic
[29:31.320 --> 29:37.560]  assassination teams but not for citizens who were just you know politically
[29:37.560 --> 29:43.240]  involved if they were tried to hire them to be assassins to kill drug dealers who
[29:43.240 --> 29:46.720]  weren't laundering their money through the US government we'll be right back

[33:33.760 --> 33:39.360]  listeners specifically about your view of the Republicans openly announcing on
[33:39.360 --> 33:44.720]  TV and radio that the Republican establishment just won't let Ron Paul
[33:44.720 --> 33:48.920]  win one way or the other that if he wins Iowa they're just gonna ignore it or
[33:48.920 --> 33:52.960]  that they might actually well here's the headline at prismplanet.com
[33:52.960 --> 33:58.800]  Republican insider GOP establishment planning to subvert Iowa to prevent
[33:58.800 --> 34:03.480]  Ron Paul win we've got Ron Paul's brother Wayne Paul joining us to talk
[34:03.480 --> 34:07.840]  about this and a lot more in the second hour today then we'll continue with open
[34:07.840 --> 34:12.840]  phones in the third hour but we'll also take some calls for Wayne Paul Wayne is
[34:12.840 --> 34:16.560]  a great patriot for more than I don't know 40 years or so fighting the private
[34:16.560 --> 34:21.880]  Federal Reserve he's basically just like his brother and he's a CPA that's
[34:21.880 --> 34:25.800]  famously fought the IRS and been involved in court cases beating him I
[34:25.800 --> 34:31.680]  mean this family is just 110% patriot hard charging all the way you see I've
[34:31.680 --> 34:38.960]  known Ron Paul since 1996 and I see all these people saying he isn't real or
[34:38.960 --> 34:45.240]  he's New World Order with no proof or he's Masonic Puba with no proof that is
[34:45.240 --> 34:49.960]  establishment Cohen tell pro attacking him from the bottom as Cass Sunstein said
[34:49.960 --> 34:53.600]  that they would do that the White House regulations are he said that the
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.640]  mainstream media has lost so much credibility that they're no longer the
[34:57.640 --> 35:02.960]  mainstream media so the system has to pose as quote conspiracy theorist and
[35:02.960 --> 35:07.280]  alternative media that means people that aren't bamboozled people that aren't
[35:07.280 --> 35:12.680]  suckers people that aren't fools they have to pose is us because we have
[35:12.680 --> 35:20.480]  credibility to then create infighting but when you see Wayne Paul I've noticed
[35:20.480 --> 35:24.920]  the media never even picked up on this Wayne Paul involved in you know cases
[35:24.920 --> 35:29.240]  out in Las Vegas with you know patriots and big IRS cases and it's
[35:29.240 --> 35:34.600]  challenging the IRS and federal court I mean just the whole family and I know
[35:34.600 --> 35:40.680]  folks behind the scenes with Rand Paul and he is just absolute anti-New World
[35:40.680 --> 35:49.400]  Order right down the line he is just more polished than his father just
[35:49.400 --> 35:55.560]  amazing people and they are great focal points for our movement of liberty to
[35:55.560 --> 36:01.240]  wake people up so that's coming up after I get to some of your phone calls I
[36:01.240 --> 36:08.520]  wanted now though to get to this video this is what Huntsman a gentleman on
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.760]  record who's worked for Obama so he's in good company with Mitt Romney and Newt
[36:12.760 --> 36:20.280]  Gennrich who were for carbon taxes open borders gun control wrote the Obama plan
[36:20.280 --> 36:26.080]  that's Romney Gennrich and a luminous globalist supporting carbon taxes open
[36:26.080 --> 36:32.240]  borders I mean you just can't make up how bad these guys are and the system just
[36:32.240 --> 36:36.800]  keeps cramming them down everybody's throats and as people learn about how
[36:36.800 --> 36:43.000]  bad they are they turn against them but in the case of Mitt Romney if he does
[36:43.000 --> 36:47.800]  get the nomination people are gonna hold their nose and say well at least
[36:47.800 --> 36:52.480]  he's not Obama wait a minute he will continue everything Obama's done he's
[36:52.480 --> 36:59.960]  shown that in his actions but he'll be a new face and so it'll take a few years
[36:59.960 --> 37:04.960]  to expose him as a globalist trader it would be better just to keep Obama in
[37:04.960 --> 37:09.040]  there engaging in all his treason because at least politically he's garbage
[37:09.040 --> 37:16.200]  he's spoiled but it gives them a new fresh horse for the new order to ride on
[37:16.200 --> 37:22.800]  if they get Romney in there remember it's the Republican establishment that's
[37:22.800 --> 37:28.120]  voting for all this draconian police state garbage for Obama all of these
[37:28.120 --> 37:33.800]  Republican and mainline neoconsights are freaking out over the NDA and over all
[37:33.800 --> 37:37.080]  of the different Mayak and Homeland Security reports listing patriots and
[37:37.080 --> 37:42.160]  libertarians and conservatives as terrorists and then meanwhile it's the
[37:42.160 --> 37:48.720]  Republican Congress that's helping write the book on all of this it's a
[37:48.720 --> 37:53.600]  ruling political class who poses and acts like they're having a fight with
[37:53.600 --> 37:58.800]  each other but they're not and I know that's understood by our listeners but
[37:58.800 --> 38:03.680]  the general public hasn't completely figured that out yet the this has been
[38:03.680 --> 38:09.200]  the first time in memory except for Pat Buchanan to a certain extent you saw
[38:09.200 --> 38:12.000]  what they did with him clear election fraud saying you couldn't win
[38:12.000 --> 38:20.640]  demonization same thing with Ron Paul but Ron Paul is five times better than
[38:20.640 --> 38:25.440]  Pat Buchanan and Pat's a good person overall I mean Ron Paul is as good as
[38:25.440 --> 38:31.720]  it gets as good as it gets and so the system is pulling out every stop so if
[38:31.720 --> 38:35.080]  you don't like what the system is doing and you're sick of the status quo and
[38:35.080 --> 38:39.240]  you're tired of things not changing and you want real hope and change Ron Paul
[38:39.240 --> 38:45.200]  and I know our audience understands that but it's so elementary it's so simple
[38:45.200 --> 38:51.560]  and it's so frustrating to see this disinformation now Huntsman is getting
[38:51.560 --> 39:00.680]  desperate right now he is in absolute total and complete panic mode and he's
[39:00.680 --> 39:07.160]  going after Ron Paul because he has zero credibility and everybody knows
[39:07.160 --> 39:16.400]  exactly who he is and what he stands for and we have articles again breaking it
[39:16.400 --> 39:20.840]  down at info wars calm and prison planet calm there's a good new American
[39:20.840 --> 39:25.960]  article by Thomas Edlem breaking it down John Huntsman grasping for straws and
[39:25.960 --> 39:34.280]  attacks on Ron Paul and what do they do in this ad that uses a clip from Endgame
[39:34.280 --> 39:38.520]  my seminal documentary on the globalist mindset not just that they want a world
[39:38.520 --> 39:43.600]  government but what are they after what what drives our enemy it's important to
[39:43.600 --> 39:52.880]  know that it's key to know that now looking at this it is such an
[39:52.880 --> 39:59.600]  illustration that the top political ad companies that Huntsman and others have
[39:59.600 --> 40:06.400]  hired are going after Ron Paul for simply saying yes going bones wields a lot of
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.360]  influence yes CFR interlateral Commission do I mean both these groups
[40:10.360 --> 40:17.960]  have written thousands of publications thousands of publications the
[40:17.960 --> 40:21.840]  trilateral Commission since 74 when David Rockefeller set it up was the
[40:21.840 --> 40:27.280]  Big New Brzezinski the CFR since 1922 I mean they put out magazines internet
[40:27.280 --> 40:30.440]  articles every two months a big book comes out called foreign affairs
[40:30.440 --> 40:34.920]  constantly calling for the end of sovereignty world government and so they
[40:34.920 --> 40:41.360]  take clips of Ron Paul talking about real things and imply that it's crazy now
[40:41.360 --> 40:47.080]  think of the disdain that they have for the viewers all these decades they
[40:47.080 --> 40:51.720]  told you there's no new world order all these decades they said the CFR doesn't
[40:51.720 --> 40:55.600]  exist I remember Limbaugh saying that 15 years ago now he says they don't have
[40:55.600 --> 41:03.440]  power and makes jokes about it but he used to say didn't exist I remember
[41:03.440 --> 41:09.640]  being on talk radio in 96 97 98 and getting phone calls about back then half
[41:09.640 --> 41:13.680]  the callers would disagree with me on average and saying how dare you say
[41:13.680 --> 41:18.640]  there's something called the NSA and echelon listening to our phones and
[41:18.640 --> 41:23.760]  grabbing data there's no such thing and I'd get other calls saying I work for
[41:23.760 --> 41:27.760]  the government buddy and you're not supposed to talk about that the public
[41:27.760 --> 41:34.840]  thought it was a conspiracy theory that the National Security Agency existed
[41:34.840 --> 41:39.680]  then when they admitted it existed by 2000 or so then we had to have a debate
[41:39.680 --> 41:45.600]  about no folks every major phone company hub has NSA rooms and floors in it
[41:45.600 --> 41:49.440]  listening to everything you do here's the congressional funding for it going
[41:49.440 --> 41:55.320]  back to the 50s 60 70s 80s 90s here's the telecommunications act here's nine
[41:55.320 --> 42:01.680]  billion dollars in 1996 to put new hubs in all the facilities here's the
[42:01.680 --> 42:05.800]  standardization for cell phone manufacturers under FCC regulations
[42:05.800 --> 42:09.240]  that want to sell phones in the country they've got to have a back door where
[42:09.240 --> 42:12.920]  they can turn it on listen to you even when it's off here's the telecommunications
[42:12.920 --> 42:20.160]  act I got calls NSA doesn't exist and they wouldn't spy on us today does the
[42:20.160 --> 42:24.880]  NSA exist this is here I am saying there's a world corporate government
[42:24.880 --> 42:28.400]  bankrupting Europe in the US the derivatives told you that 13 14 years
[42:28.400 --> 42:33.840]  ago exactly what they would do top economist on George Humphrey and others
[42:33.840 --> 42:38.200]  told you everything that was gonna unfold and I'm still here playing child
[42:38.200 --> 42:42.440]  like games with people you're playing along the child like game of having to
[42:42.440 --> 42:45.840]  go there really is a world government there really is a mega corporate take
[42:45.840 --> 42:52.720]  over system and I still get to tune in to talk radio randomly almost every week
[42:52.720 --> 42:57.040]  and here's somebody make fun of me a host or callers because I talk about
[42:57.040 --> 43:05.440]  this I mean it's disgusting I'm talking about real things that are happening
[43:05.440 --> 43:09.640]  Ron Paul is and instead of us having a debate about do we want a private
[43:09.640 --> 43:13.240]  corporate unelected world government that's tyrannical and oppressive and
[43:13.240 --> 43:17.360]  anti-free market I have to keep having a debate with childlike people about
[43:17.360 --> 43:21.080]  whether it exists or not now this isn't working anymore that's why the quote
[43:21.080 --> 43:24.920]  mainstream media is falling apart and it's now known for the liars they are
[43:24.920 --> 43:29.760]  but still they think this agenda works so I'm gonna go ahead and play the John
[43:29.760 --> 43:33.560]  Huntsman ad for you here it is
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.960]  Ron Paul Chronicles the assumption is that this guy is like your crazy uncle
[43:43.960 --> 43:47.240]  but you never expected your crazy uncle to get this far the problem with him is
[43:47.240 --> 43:51.400]  that he's got some very sound points but then he's kind of I don't know in other
[43:51.400 --> 43:54.600]  areas scary all I can say is you know people have written about this in
[43:54.600 --> 43:59.880]  the Philippines is a secret order of jail and then the proposition is that
[43:59.880 --> 44:03.960]  people are there groomed for the trial at all commission and the CFR and
[44:03.960 --> 44:07.640]  therefore they will then be in positions of great influence in our
[44:07.640 --> 44:13.520]  government President Bush said that the New World Order was in tune and
[44:13.520 --> 44:17.520]  that's what they were working for 600,000 Americans died in the senseless
[44:17.520 --> 44:22.440]  civil war you buy the slaves and how much would that cost compared to killing
[44:22.440 --> 44:27.080]  600,000 Americans if you look at the history you'll find out that Hamas was
[44:27.080 --> 44:31.560]  encouraged and really started by Israel have you ever read about the reasons they
[44:31.560 --> 44:36.320]  attacked us they attack us because we've been over there we've been bombing Iraq
[44:36.320 --> 44:40.520]  for 10 years are you suggesting we invited the 9-11 attacks sir the
[44:40.520 --> 44:44.680]  Israelis are there the United States is there all these countries China has
[44:44.680 --> 44:48.760]  nuclear weapons why wouldn't it be natural that they might want a weapon
[44:48.760 --> 44:52.360]  there be internationally they'd be given more respect
[44:52.360 --> 44:59.560]  tune in next week for more of the Ron Paul Chronicles with Twilight Zone music
[44:59.560 --> 45:07.160]  okay let's stop right there this is only a small smattering that you're about to
[45:07.160 --> 45:11.120]  see of this what we grabbed yesterday there are hundreds and hundreds of these
[45:11.120 --> 45:16.560]  in fact the best compendium of them is Jason Burmes's seminal film that I
[45:16.560 --> 45:21.640]  produced available at info wars calm invisible Empire it's got hundreds and
[45:21.640 --> 45:29.320]  hundreds of clips and the world leaders openly saying that the New World Order
[45:29.320 --> 45:36.080]  means the global government the new order means the state is God now here is
[45:36.080 --> 45:41.680]  a grouping of clips for people out there I mean there must be groups that don't
[45:41.680 --> 45:44.840]  think there's a New World Order and doesn't and don't think that there's a
[45:44.840 --> 45:48.760]  CFR or Trinidadal Commission and really think it's kooky to talk about the
[45:48.760 --> 45:52.960]  political gangsters that have gotten all their people into power and then a
[45:52.960 --> 45:57.280]  run in this country into the ground and an openly announcing a bank of the world
[45:57.280 --> 46:02.600]  that will pay our carbon taxes to so for you here are world leaders including
[46:02.600 --> 46:09.600]  George Herbert Walker Bush Barack Obama Henry Kissinger and others Gordon
[46:09.600 --> 46:13.720]  Brown Herman von Roompie the head of the European Union the unelected bureaucrat
[46:13.720 --> 46:20.160]  who runs everything openly saying New World Order global governance global
[46:20.160 --> 46:27.040]  government I mean what a hoax these globalists run ads basically saying
[46:27.040 --> 46:30.920]  we're gonna make fun of you they think you're peer pressure driven that if they
[46:30.920 --> 46:34.680]  say the sky isn't blue and they tell you you'll say yes sir boss here's those
[46:34.680 --> 46:39.880]  clips I've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I
[46:39.880 --> 46:43.600]  think all of us would like to see partnership and cooperation among
[46:43.600 --> 46:52.160]  nations is not a choice I think his task will be to develop an overall strategy
[46:52.160 --> 46:57.720]  for America in this period when really a New World Order can be created it's a
[46:57.720 --> 47:06.040]  great opportunity and isn't that a crisis what is at stake is more than one
[47:06.040 --> 47:14.280]  small country it is a big idea a New World Order where diverse nations are
[47:14.280 --> 47:20.520]  drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of
[47:20.520 --> 47:26.680]  mankind now we can see a new world coming into view a world in which there is
[47:26.680 --> 47:34.200]  a very real prospect of a New World Order but it is the awareness itself that
[47:34.200 --> 47:38.840]  will drive the change and one of the ways it will drive the change is through
[47:38.840 --> 47:44.560]  global governance and global agreements but the many business leaders who have
[47:44.560 --> 47:53.240]  been present here are among those taking leadership in other ways yet these
[47:53.240 --> 47:59.120]  problems can be overcome by a joint effort in our and between our countries
[47:59.120 --> 48:04.560]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of a
[48:04.560 --> 48:11.320]  G20 in the middle of the financial crisis the climate conference in Copenhagen is
[48:11.320 --> 48:15.960]  another step towards the global management of our planet this is
[48:15.960 --> 48:21.120]  collective action people working together at their best I think the New
[48:21.120 --> 48:25.080]  World Order is emerging and with it the foundations of a new and progressive
[48:25.080 --> 48:32.600]  era of international cooperation all right that's just a small grouping now I
[48:32.600 --> 48:37.200]  thought I would go and fact-check Huntsman's ads some more for you because
[48:37.200 --> 48:43.440]  it's Herat's Jerusalem Post UPI Washington Post New York Times hundreds of
[48:43.440 --> 48:48.560]  articles if you just type in Israel created Hamas you will get Israeli
[48:48.560 --> 48:52.560]  newspapers by the dozen but here they are I'll put some on screen for viewers
[48:52.560 --> 48:56.880]  for radio listeners just look this up this is the Wall Street Journal January
[48:56.880 --> 49:06.680]  24th 2009 how Israel helped to spawn Hamas and again we have another grouping
[49:06.680 --> 49:10.360]  of a video in there that's the third clip we can just show viewers this on
[49:10.360 --> 49:15.520]  screen or I can do a document cam shot so Ron Paul's bad for saying Israel
[49:15.520 --> 49:26.120]  created and set up Hamas but but I mean there's Herat's H-A-A-R-E-T-Z that's
[49:26.120 --> 49:31.320]  right there for everybody right there I mean they go on admit that Israel
[49:31.320 --> 49:36.200]  created it here's the headline Israel has only one option when it comes to Iran
[49:36.200 --> 49:42.640]  and it goes in the article to Israel creating Hamas so there it is but but
[49:42.640 --> 49:49.040]  you can go further you can type in Israel created fake al-Qaeda or Israel
[49:49.040 --> 49:53.360]  staged attacks against themselves and you'll pull up Jerusalem post Herat's
[49:53.360 --> 49:58.080]  we're supposed to just be stupid see Ron Paul's not supposed to be able to read
[49:58.080 --> 50:05.160]  Israeli newspapers or the Wall Street Journal see our real crime is that we
[50:05.160 --> 50:14.480]  live in the real world our crime is that we know how to count to ten our crime
[50:14.480 --> 50:19.920]  is we know what's up and what's down we know what's black and what's white we
[50:19.920 --> 50:25.280]  know basically how to tie our shoelaces and you're not supposed to know you're
[50:25.280 --> 50:28.720]  just supposed to see a guy in a suit laugh at Ron Paul and go he's worried
[50:28.720 --> 50:31.980]  about a global government ha ha oh Ron Paul's worried about all these
[50:31.980 --> 50:37.600]  derivatives and the banks imploding us aha it's all a planned takeover and of
[50:37.600 --> 50:41.200]  course they have to keep ridiculing just like they ridicule and go they're
[50:41.200 --> 50:45.840]  crazy people they think there's an agency called the NSA and the
[50:45.840 --> 50:51.240]  government's listening to them they're crazy people now it's all admitted just
[50:51.240 --> 50:54.480]  like we told you there was plans to use the military domestically now it's the
[50:54.480 --> 51:02.600]  law and they say they'll secretly disappear you no more time for games folks
[51:02.600 --> 51:06.480]  folks have you launched your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get

[51:13.960 --> 51:19.000]  power outages ahead here's why solar power generators are now available from
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.760]  our friends at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors their
[51:22.760 --> 51:26.520]  emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you
[51:26.520 --> 51:31.120]  need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly amidst no
[51:31.120 --> 51:35.240]  fumes and produces electricity from the sun it's like having an electric power
[51:35.240 --> 51:39.640]  plant running quietly in your own own whether it's ice storms brownouts or
[51:39.640 --> 51:43.240]  blackouts you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again

[56:00.280 --> 56:07.880]  him Mark in Illinois earlier let's just go to MJ in Illinois MJ you're on the
[56:07.880 --> 56:14.520]  air go ahead I just wanted to say that I really do appreciate you because I only
[56:14.520 --> 56:18.640]  listened to you for about two years ago I came across you accidentally on YouTube
[56:18.640 --> 56:24.760]  and these other talk show hosts you just hit it on the money they're just the
[56:24.760 --> 56:28.640]  words can't describe how evil these people are and I'm just trying to be
[56:28.640 --> 56:34.440]  nice as I'm on I'm okay speak I'm on air but the thing I had about Ron Paul is
[56:34.440 --> 56:39.200]  what they're doing to him is criminal and we the American well yeah this is a
[56:39.200 --> 56:43.720]  criminal group that took America over they really are criminals that they're
[56:43.720 --> 56:46.560]  getting ready to start devaluing the currency and grabbing everybody's bank
[56:46.560 --> 56:50.600]  accounts there are a bunch of scum America doesn't exist anymore it's been
[56:50.600 --> 56:55.960]  taken over by mega banks I'm sorry go ahead okay and then also you know prime
[56:55.960 --> 57:00.720]  example when you have these vehicles saying that they're up for the
[57:00.720 --> 57:05.200]  Constitution or for America or for our rights and I don't know if you really
[57:05.200 --> 57:08.880]  talked about it too much like with Rick Perry starting that lawsuit in Virginia
[57:08.880 --> 57:13.600]  because he didn't make the requirement to take out 10,000 signatures because he
[57:13.600 --> 57:17.600]  couldn't be on the ballot none of the candidates in Virginia and other states
[57:17.600 --> 57:21.880]  could get on there but Romney and Paul they're the only major contenders and I
[57:21.880 --> 57:25.920]  was saying that for four months looking at the polls the only two people that
[57:25.920 --> 57:30.760]  could seriously run against Obama are Mitt Romney and Ron Paul with the money
[57:30.760 --> 57:35.840]  the name everything and then with Romney he's an Obama clone so it doesn't
[57:35.840 --> 57:41.600]  matter the only persons Ron Paul it's very simple exactly and the people is
[57:41.600 --> 57:46.240]  right in front of our faces if we don't wake up we are not going to have
[57:46.240 --> 57:52.560]  anything left let me ask you a question because it's important what do you think
[57:52.560 --> 57:56.320]  of Huntsman trying to claim there's no new world order when it's in front of
[57:56.320 --> 58:02.160]  everybody it's just another example of the globe was showing their arrogance
[58:02.160 --> 58:07.520]  thinking that we're stupid and we and we are there are people that are waking up
[58:07.520 --> 58:12.160]  we just need more people waking up and I hope particularly today in Iowa that
[58:12.160 --> 58:17.080]  the people in that state realize what they're doing and still vote their gut
[58:17.080 --> 58:20.760]  and you know we know that Ron Paul is leading these polls to make sure they
[58:20.760 --> 58:24.600]  get out there and vote the way that they feel and stop being sheep on listening
[58:24.600 --> 58:29.560]  to everything other people say exactly MJ I appreciate your call yeah doing what
[58:29.560 --> 58:35.120]  the dominant media says is trendy has destroyed this country we have foreign
[58:35.120 --> 58:40.840]  criminal interest running a giant scythe up against us they're the enemy

[1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:47.400]  prisonplanet.tv and last hour I was playing clips of Henry Kissinger
[1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:51.560]  Obama Bush senior calling for world government New World Order and I just
[1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:56.320]  look at how arrogant they are they're just con men who practice talking real
[1:00:56.320 --> 1:01:01.000]  smooth and real slow to sound reasonable when they're doing horrible
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:04.800]  things and they've taken the wealthiest nation in the world and made it the
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:09.000]  greatest debtor nation they've taken a nation known for liberty and freedom and
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:13.840]  turned it into one known for evil and then and now they're trying to give us
[1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:18.840]  more of the same as the solution and just a decent American who's a
[1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:23.960]  constitutionalist is being called crazy and cookie well then they're saying
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:28.880]  George Washington is crazy and cookie because Ron Paul follows the
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:34.760]  Constitution not to a fault but some would say to a fault to an obsessive
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:41.880]  compulsive level now if you don't like Ron Paul then you don't like what
[1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:49.840]  America is the people demonizing Ron Paul and myself are lecherous un-American
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:54.680]  vipers who want the destruction of our Republic and who are signed on to the New
[1:01:54.680 --> 1:02:00.160]  World Order period let's go back to your phone calls here and I'm sorry well
[1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:04.120]  there was another mark from Illinois so I got confused and thought that was the
[1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:07.880]  same mark but let's go back to Mark in Illinois then Rick and others mark thanks
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:14.040]  for holding welcome are you doing Alex good wonder I have a couple questions for
[1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:19.160]  you one for the police and either watch the movie the second movie lethal weapon
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:23.760]  it tells them there about how they have diplomatic community against us and how
[1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:27.440]  they use it against our mill no no the globalists have diplomatic immunity and
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:32.040]  get caught running white slaves I mean sex slaves folks drugs all the time
[1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:37.200]  that's exactly how the New World Order the UN all these mega groups they all
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:43.360]  declare immunity it's a joke that's what I it's a con game it is a con game you
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:47.520]  got it you nailed it right on the nose of Ron Paul all the way I'm for him I was
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:52.320]  so happy here on CBS morning they have to say that the Newt Gingrich called him a
[1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:58.440]  liar not Ron Paul but called Romney a liar right straight in front of
[1:02:58.440 --> 1:03:01.720]  everybody man I mean everyone had a hard time getting themselves for the
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:05.760]  composer together you're supposed to but look look he's a liar too I mean I
[1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:09.320]  heard Gingrich whining about negative ads Gingrich has been running negative
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:13.840]  ads the New World Order this leader right with them you know what they need to
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:17.200]  take the New World Order and we need to start a new world action against them
[1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:20.800]  take that right to them well again the devil's greatest trick was telling the
[1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:24.680]  world he didn't exist and that's the mind game we can never get rid of this
[1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:29.560]  because they have this weird unified front of none of it exist when it
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:34.800]  exists I mean that shows I appreciate your call the biggest example of fraud I
[1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:39.640]  know of is that every year before school starts they announce everywhere it's the
[1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:45.640]  law to take vaccines there is no law it's a giant criminal hoax and then you
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:50.200]  hear the vaccine ads on the very same TV and radio stations now the average
[1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:54.160]  radio station person is so weak-minded they actually think it's the law too

[1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:39.600]  brothers and for many decades he's been exposing the fellow deserve battling the
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:46.120]  IRS in court he's a CPA he is just a chip off the same block that Ron Paul came
[1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:51.480]  from off the same tree and I wanted to get him on today to talk a little bit
[1:08:51.480 --> 1:08:54.680]  about his brother and who his brother really is I mean I happen to know the
[1:08:54.680 --> 1:08:59.440]  inside baseball on Ron Paul who would basically volunteer for free to work at
[1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:03.440]  charity hospitals because he believes in the free market and the free market
[1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:07.960]  you're supposed to have people that dedicate their own time willingly to
[1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:11.720]  help those that are in need that's what the Bible teaches I happen to know that
[1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:15.760]  Ron Paul routinely would pay the bills of his poor patients that's now coming out
[1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:20.160]  not from his campaign but from others and that Ron Paul would volunteer in the
[1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:25.600]  minority black areas mainly and give them free health care but Ron Paul is
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:32.120]  the type of person who a hero he won't talk about himself he won't allow it
[1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:36.600]  because it's painful for people like him to hear it because he knows he's
[1:09:36.600 --> 1:09:41.320]  doing his duty but I know his brother if we twist his arm might talk about him
[1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:45.640]  and I've never asked you guys about your parents what great people they must
[1:09:45.640 --> 1:09:50.400]  have been to produce such a great family of Liberty lovers across across the
[1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:54.200]  board and now grandchildren I know are involved in the fight against the
[1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:59.520]  globalist and we sure are proud to have you here with us in Texas but Wayne out
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:03.000]  of the gates you know I was saying theater in the break I said Wayne what
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.400]  do you want to talk about first and he said I'd like to mention a website where
[1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:10.760]  they're going to have people at all the caucuses themselves taking a photo of the
[1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:15.960]  tallyboard that's why Ron's gonna probably win Iowa is because it's the
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:19.480]  old-fashioned vote with your hands at the precinct it's tallyed put on a board
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:22.840]  and so the Republicans have announced they're gonna run into secret to
[1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:28.280]  protect it from anonymous hackers who've been protesting Ron Paul obviously
[1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:32.800]  working for them the Republican establishment who's who've openly said
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:36.280]  they want to sabotage Paul and if he wins just ignore him and so they're
[1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:40.880]  saying to protect it it's a secret location but we can stop them from doing
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:45.800]  that and we're gonna have the website up on screen here when do comes in about
[1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:49.400]  20 minutes for a quick report because dues getting a piece together for this
[1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:52.840]  tonight on the nightly news as well but we got to get this going now where they
[1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:57.480]  take a photo of it and then they have a public tabulation of that so that we
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:02.560]  can checkmate the fraudsters and we also have articles at prisonplanet.com
[1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:07.960]  Republican insider the Fox analyst GOP establishment planning to subvert
[1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:13.280]  Iowa to prevent Ron Paul win we've got that audio clip coming up later as well
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:17.360]  but it was funny because that was what I was gonna raise to Wayne first but he
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:22.240]  brought it up to me so Wayne what is first on your radar screen here today my
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:28.320]  friend well I think the biggest thing is how do we know we're gonna have an
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:33.440]  honest tabulation and there's those throughout the country have been
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:37.280]  thinking about this for a long time and there's three or four guys on the East
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:46.600]  Coast that have set up a website called transparent vote net and they put out a
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:52.000]  letter to all the candidates in Iowa saying if you've got people in a
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:59.080]  precinct when the precinct count is finished and sign off one before they
[1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:07.680]  whisk it away asking to put it up and you take a camera picture of it with your
[1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:15.160]  iPhone and then upload it to transparent vote net and they'll run a
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:22.080]  concurrent tabulation that you can watch and of course that's what the
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:26.440]  Republican Party should do to maintain the safety of it but but notice the
[1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:31.560]  anonymous group was just a government cutout has now gone and protested at
[1:12:31.560 --> 1:12:36.800]  Ron Paul's Iowa offices there they're talking horrible trash about him
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:41.200]  everywhere for two weeks and they're the group threatening to disrupt the
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:46.480]  caucus which now demonizes anybody who ever runs under the name anonymous and
[1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:51.600]  then allows the Republican establishment to run and secretly tabulate the vote
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:54.520]  I mean it's pretty obvious what's going on with these stinkers
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:13:01.680]  George did you hear what the governor of Iowa stated yes but I know you've got the
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:06.600]  quote give it to folks well he turned around it was on national television and
[1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:14.520]  said if Ron Paul wins the Ohio Iowa caucuses you have to discount it because
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:24.760]  it wouldn't mean anything it's amazing I want to get into what it's like for the
[1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:29.360]  family and what it's like you know Ron Paul's brother to see them twist things
[1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:35.320]  and tell the lies about him and also see just a pack of mangy jackals that is the
[1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:40.720]  dinosaur prostitute media savaging your brother but also savaging his supporters
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:45.960]  and and and the governor saying ignore the vote if he wins which is saying
[1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:51.200]  ignore the voters I mean they're really showing their arrogance and I think that's
[1:13:51.200 --> 1:14:00.200]  true I think the amazing thing Alex is people are afraid of truth and honesty
[1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:06.560]  and and it's the people that control things that are the most afraid they
[1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:14.880]  can't hammer the truth the thing I'm most amazed about is my brother's
[1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:21.160]  capability of remaining positive and looking at the goal and not being
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:28.800]  deflected by all the other statements that are made that are negative to him
[1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:38.440]  his goal is freedom liberty and privacy for everybody that's what he wants and I
[1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:47.160]  really think Alex we live an exciting time coming up and starting today for
[1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:52.560]  the next six months because economically things are going to get worse and more
[1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:57.160]  and more people are going to say we want to change and there's no ball starting
[1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:02.600]  rolls on the hill and and the powers to beat don't like it and they don't know
[1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:07.480]  what to do about it it was Julius Caesar that said there is a tide in the
[1:15:07.480 --> 1:15:12.520]  affairs of men when taking it the flood leads on to fortune the fortune we seek
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:17.000]  is liberty and freedom in our time and for future generations and not live
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.280]  under a collectivist yoke of communitarianism and imagine your
[1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:25.760]  brother really for 40 years but prominently for three decades traveling
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:31.400]  the country writing books in and out of Congress battling for basic Americana
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:35.520]  liberty I mean really nothing special just basic common sense
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:41.600]  constitution and now here he is right as everything he warned of and you and I
[1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:46.160]  and many others and Jabra Griffin warned of right as it's all happening just as
[1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:51.560]  we have said there is Ron Paul I mean that's God giving us a chance you know
[1:15:51.560 --> 1:15:55.760]  God if you study the Bible Wayne as you know always gives people a way out a
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:03.840]  chance and I'm saying this is our chance well you're right and but Wayne we
[1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:08.680]  cannot lose even if they steal the election down the road by Ron running
[1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:12.600]  and by everybody supporting him this is the greatest awakening and people
[1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:15.480]  learning about the Federal Reserve and the New World Order we've ever seen
[1:16:15.480 --> 1:16:22.040]  Wayne that's absolutely right that's why I tell my friends and neighbors we
[1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:27.960]  live in the most exciting times of our life because we've never had an
[1:16:27.960 --> 1:16:36.040]  opportunity like this in my lifetime and I'm 70 years old and I think it's
[1:16:36.040 --> 1:16:44.000]  exciting I think it's definitive and I think it is going to be something that's
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:49.160]  going to surprise everybody because the time is now it certainly is I don't know
[1:16:49.160 --> 1:16:53.880]  if you've seen this but it's on infowars.com but Huntsman who's worked
[1:16:53.880 --> 1:16:58.240]  for Obama's a total one-worlder he's running an ad playing clips of your
[1:16:58.240 --> 1:17:02.000]  brother talking about George Herbert Walker Bush calling for a new world
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:07.880]  order I mean those are all public clips how is your brother bad for admitting
[1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:11.400]  that world leaders want a world government and that we shouldn't be part
[1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:17.760]  of that I mean how is saying the sky is blue bad I totally understand what
[1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:24.040]  you're saying I just admire my brother for being able to stay positive through
[1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:30.840]  all the swinging that's going on yeah he's done that let's for folks that you
[1:17:30.840 --> 1:17:34.240]  know obviously aren't Ron Paul's brother you know you guys have a large
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:39.040]  family growing up how would you you know characterize him in the family and
[1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:44.120]  then you know throughout his life what type of person is Ron Paul and what do
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:47.320]  you make of all of these you know taking out of tens of thousands of
[1:17:47.320 --> 1:17:51.640]  newsletters taking you know ten lines or something and conflating them with
[1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:56.680]  other things and then attacking your brother well as a little bit of
[1:17:56.680 --> 1:18:02.480]  background there are five boys in our family Ron is the middle of five boys
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:08.560]  my mother and father ran a processing dairy business in the basement of
[1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:16.720]  our house which was a four-room house and they did that up until I believe I
[1:18:16.720 --> 1:18:23.040]  was in fifth or sixth grade before they moved the processing business from the
[1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:29.800]  basement of a house to a separate building and we were all be stopped you
[1:18:29.800 --> 1:18:34.400]  know my my mother and father had to work seven days a week and when we were
[1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:38.960]  old enough to wear some boots and could wash some cans that were in the basement
[1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:45.000]  we put the boots on and went to work and that's just the way we were taught
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:50.440]  raised but every Sunday morning regardless of the fact we had to work we
[1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:56.320]  took time off and went to Sunday school and church the five of us had a paper
[1:18:56.320 --> 1:19:02.040]  route starting with my oldest brother down to me when I gave up the route we
[1:19:02.040 --> 1:19:08.560]  had close to 300 customers we delivered paper to every day and they had to
[1:19:08.560 --> 1:19:14.120]  divide it up into three paper rows after we gave it up because nobody would take
[1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:25.040]  it all right I mean tell us more tell us about your parents well mom and dad
[1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:32.480]  were obvious hard workers they were obvious well grounded in their faith and
[1:19:32.480 --> 1:19:41.160]  they didn't ever try to beat anything into us they just expected us to turn
[1:19:41.160 --> 1:19:47.040]  around and go to Sunday school and church and it was just a way of life for us
[1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:52.920]  and there was never a problem the only problem my mom and dad had is when we
[1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:56.640]  were sitting in church on Sunday morning they couldn't divide themselves among
[1:19:56.640 --> 1:20:01.960]  five boys so there were all these two sitting together and of course any two
[1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:06.880]  sitting together agitated each other but they always had a problem that keep
[1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:14.480]  it calm for the service that lasted maybe 45 minutes or an hour but other
[1:20:14.480 --> 1:20:20.600]  than that we were perfect children you know now how would you describe Ron
[1:20:20.600 --> 1:20:27.480]  Paul I mean at his core what drives your brother well even when Ron was in high
[1:20:27.480 --> 1:20:35.600]  school before he had a driver's license he worked and in a drugstore making
[1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:42.360]  photos and Sunday and then at 9 or 10 o'clock tonight or Friday at 30 90 get
[1:20:42.360 --> 1:20:48.920]  on his bicycle and take him it's about a mile from the house and he would
[1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:55.280]  bicycle home we all work in the dairy on the daily basis once we got licenses we
[1:20:55.280 --> 1:21:01.640]  drove milk trucks every day we all five of us put our way through college when
[1:21:01.640 --> 1:21:07.640]  Ron went to college he went to Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania when he
[1:21:07.640 --> 1:21:13.520]  was the sophomore I believe and I could be wrong on the exact date but I think
[1:21:13.520 --> 1:21:19.160]  he was married roughly in his sophomore year when he graduated from Gettysburg
[1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:25.720]  College I believe he had maybe one or two children and he went to
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:36.080]  South Carolina to graduate school and after that he went to the Air Force for
[1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:43.680]  five years then he went back to get another degree in Michigan then he
[1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:51.640]  came back to Pennsylvania and got his doctor and doctor's certificate as
[1:21:51.640 --> 1:21:59.320]  obstetrics and gynecology doctor and then he went into practice so he always
[1:21:59.320 --> 1:22:05.840]  worked he always of course we always try to kid him a little bit to keep him
[1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:10.360]  humble we always say he was to the forward one of the five of us and as long
[1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:19.120]  as there's four of us who are around we win the battle now what about you know
[1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:23.360]  their false claims of racism and things like that I mean because from people I
[1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:26.000]  know that you know your brother well and of course what's coming out in the
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.160]  media I mean he would volunteer quite a bit always at the charity hospitals to
[1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:37.120]  help people well not only that but he never took Medicare if the patient
[1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:44.680]  come in to his office he took care of him if they didn't have the money they
[1:22:44.680 --> 1:22:50.360]  made an agreement as to how they were going to get paid and he took care of
[1:22:50.360 --> 1:22:57.480]  him but he never took Medicare anytime while he was being a doctor that's
[1:22:57.480 --> 1:23:01.560]  right never took it and in many cases would just give people free health
[1:23:01.560 --> 1:23:06.800]  cares what ended up happening I mean so so so this is and particularly for my
[1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:12.560]  quote minorities I mean most doctors would just turn you away right there but
[1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:17.360]  but there's your brother a hard-working living by example of his parents and all
[1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:21.720]  the things he's done truly understands the issues and that's why the system's
[1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:25.560]  so scared of him because they know he can't be bought and there's no
[1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:29.760]  skeletons in his closet right and they're trying to make up the skeletons
[1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:35.760]  as they go so they go back 20 years to pick up one article in one newspaper
[1:23:35.760 --> 1:23:41.240]  about eight or ten lines long and they're trying to hang their head on that
[1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:48.000]  but the problem they have with that statement is his life does not depict
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:57.760]  what they're trying to make it be so the life the honesty the integrity truth
[1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:04.920]  prevails and and what he uses what he is then that's the problem they have well
[1:24:04.920 --> 1:24:09.920]  you're right but it does show the awakening is huge that despite the the
[1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:15.600]  lying Decepticon media telling everybody that Ron Paul can't win he now is the
[1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:20.400]  front-runner and they are in full panic mode what are some of the dirty tricks
[1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:26.600]  you're expecting them to pull Wayne well I'm concerned not about the caucus
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:32.840]  meetings tonight in Iowa because I believe the people in the in the
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:39.960]  individual precincts and caucus meetings are the grassroots serious minded
[1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:47.320]  individuals and that that means it doesn't matter who they support any one
[1:24:47.320 --> 1:24:54.600]  of the candidates they're normally very dedicated hard-working people that are
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:25:01.320]  going to work for the person they believe that is right I believe those
[1:25:01.320 --> 1:25:10.440]  precinct numbers will be honest and fear in every way shape or form my concern
[1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:19.800]  would be what happens when they go to a secret place and tally the vote that is
[1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:26.560]  not transparency and they can use whatever excuse they want that they want
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:32.880]  to prevent disruption if they want to prevent disruption go to downtown them
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:39.600]  Des Moines sit in a public square and have each precinct captain bring in
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:45.280]  the vote and you think it's going to be disrupted it's not going to be but they
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:48.920]  don't want to make it transfer and that's the biggest thing that frightens
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:55.840]  me well I agree with you and undoubtedly there's going to be election fraud
[1:25:55.840 --> 1:26:00.040]  that there was four years ago but if there's a big enough in places like
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:03.320]  New Hampshire there's a big enough landslide they have trouble spinning it
[1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:07.160]  and cooking it we're gonna have the top election a fraud investigator former
[1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:11.880]  federal fraud investigator Bev Harris on the radio show and the TV show tomorrow
[1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:16.680]  and the aftermath to break all this down and to track it into the next
[1:26:16.680 --> 1:26:22.200]  primaries and caucuses that are coming up but I want to state this again you you
[1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:27.360]  only lose not supporting Ron Paul you only lose not hitting the street and
[1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:32.400]  getting very aggressive with the message of liberty because even if they
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:38.720]  engage in all this fraud and stuff we win by injecting real issues
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:47.960]  absolutely and I see a almost another 50 or 60 percent more knowledgeable
[1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:54.800]  people today is to deal with the issues than it was four years ago you just said
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:27:00.480]  it you just said it more they know more and they have come to the point where
[1:27:00.480 --> 1:27:04.080]  they're not going to put up with the baloney that that's the main just ain't
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:09.560]  put down it's not going to do it well it's like your brother Ron Paul said two
[1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:13.560]  nights ago in fact I meant to pull this clip up when he was on Fox TV on the
[1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:17.920]  weekend and the host you know was saying well do you think you'll slip in Iowa
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:24.560]  as Santorum and people surge and your brother Ron Paul said no once people
[1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:30.400]  convert to liberty and put together all the pieces of it and understand how
[1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:35.880]  things work there's no going back right I mean that's the issue Ron Paul's not
[1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:40.360]  filling people through with his ideology he is getting people to rediscover
[1:27:40.360 --> 1:27:45.040]  history rediscover common sense rediscover what made America great
[1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:49.840]  versus the horrible stuff we're being sold by the establishment it's the
[1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:53.680]  establishment that's got something to hide it's the establishment that's
[1:27:53.680 --> 1:28:00.000]  discredited in kooky not Ron Paul and every month we exponentially grow and
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:05.920]  that's why the system scared yep yep they don't they as I said initially on
[1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:13.000]  this program they can't handle the truth and I have to believe as a God
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:19.600]  fearing Christian that truth is going to prevail and economically we still are
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:24.680]  going to have to take on the sixteen trillion dollars that we've had a lot
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:29.920]  about that's going to come up in the next six to nine months and the truth is
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:34.480]  going to prevail and by the way it's not just the sixteen plus trillion given to
[1:28:34.480 --> 1:28:38.440]  foreign banks but via the Federal Reserve of our tax money and Bernanke and
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:42.360]  others lying to Congress about it now we're learning there's trillions more
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:47.040]  going out I mean this is a big deal the crooks running things are stealing
[1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:53.040]  trillions and telling us it's our debt and in Alex one of the other things that
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:29:01.360]  concerns me as the brother to run is that I have studied enough history in the
[1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:13.240]  last 40 years to understand the type wire that he is walking in terms of what
[1:29:13.240 --> 1:29:20.440]  the establishment is willing to put up with they've been able to control and
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:28.080]  stick them in a hole somewhere and not have to deal with him but those times
[1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:35.360]  are changing now so each day as it changes I am in greater fear of his
[1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:40.760]  life for he and his family no no you're right but he's committed to it as a
[1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:44.680]  champion but no let's elaborate on this after the break this is the next point I
[1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:51.440]  wanted to raise we're right on the same page together we're on the March the
[1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:58.720]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[1:33:38.440 --> 1:33:44.000]  pro-america activists for decades like that's one question I want to ask him
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:50.560]  and go to a few calls is specifically you know what got Wayne and Ron involved
[1:33:50.560 --> 1:33:54.280]  in all this we'll talk to him just in a moment and also talk about Ron Paul's
[1:33:54.280 --> 1:34:01.000]  safety but first off a noble lie Oklahoma City 1995 it's a DVD film that I'm
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:07.640]  in but there's many of the survivors of Oklahoma City are in and also the mother
[1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:10.640]  of a police officer who was murdered because he was going to expose what
[1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:15.720]  really happened this was done to blame the state's rights movement movement of
[1:34:15.720 --> 1:34:20.520]  real Americans to blame us for this attack this film is like cyanide to
[1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:26.600]  tyrants get it at info wars.com and get it out to everyone you know we also are
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:30.400]  still running the everything special because it's so popular all 18 of my

[1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:07.440]  us in this fight it's also very important to support our local AM and FM
[1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:10.480]  affiliates and to become sponsors of those local stations of your local
[1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:14.280]  business but also to support those businesses that are sponsors that's
[1:35:14.280 --> 1:35:18.840]  why we're getting on so many new AM and FM stations here in the United States
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:24.200]  not just XM and we're number one podcast and audio streams on the web
[1:35:24.200 --> 1:35:29.160]  according to a bunch of different actuaries and gauges like Google
[1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:36.000]  Analytics stat brain Alexa and of course shout cast and many others now going
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:40.360]  back to brother of Ron Paul Wayne Paul you got cut off by the break start over
[1:35:40.360 --> 1:35:45.000]  you're saying that before they could ignore your brother but as he you know
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.200]  really becomes a major focal point not just here but worldwide for liberty
[1:35:49.200 --> 1:35:56.240]  you're worried about his safety please elaborate on that Wayne Paul well I look
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:02.800]  back in history and I could probably name you in my lifetime five or six
[1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:14.520]  people who are no longer alive that at one time or another is found many of or
[1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:23.200]  some of Ron's ideas and philosophy and they got to a point that that educated
[1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:31.280]  certain powers to be but now they have an individual that puts them all
[1:36:31.280 --> 1:36:40.400]  together in a very nice common sense human being package and as I said at the
[1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:48.680]  beginning they can't handle that and the more they can't handle that the more I
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:55.600]  fear for the safety of my brother whether it be by because of an aeroplane
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:02.680]  malfunction or a sniper bullet or I don't care what you want to call it I
[1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:09.760]  personally as a God-fearing person I fear and pray for his and his family's
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:16.080]  life on a daily basis and the more he wins the tougher it's going to be but I
[1:37:16.080 --> 1:37:20.440]  can guarantee you he's still going to be out there on the podium preaching what
[1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:26.240]  he believes it to rate as far as the liberty is concerned well here here to
[1:37:26.240 --> 1:37:31.200]  that Wayne Paul who got started waking up to this whole New World Order
[1:37:31.200 --> 1:37:36.960]  collectivist slave system was it you was it another brother was it Ron give us
[1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:44.920]  that lore well I think well Ron was waiting for babies to be born he began
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:52.360]  to read Austrian economic book and so he went all the way back to through
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:59.000]  Ludwig von Mises in Hayek and all those people that believe in the Austrian
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:06.280]  economic theory which is free enterprise private property and liberty to do
[1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:13.760]  what you want he learned and understood this issue and the more he read the more
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:19.480]  he understood it in the more he realized that our government 40 years ago was not
[1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:25.600]  heading in the proper direction from an economic point of view and from a
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:31.360]  liberty point of view of the individual citizens of the United States and that's
[1:38:31.360 --> 1:38:39.720]  when he decided that he felt he was called to turn around and try and educate
[1:38:39.720 --> 1:38:45.360]  the people to have a better understanding of economy a better understanding of
[1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:49.920]  liberty and a better understanding of the Constitution so was he the first
[1:38:49.920 --> 1:38:54.360]  person to I mean obviously the family was very constitutional already awake
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:59.600]  but was he the first person to really wake up I think he was in our family I
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:04.160]  got involved in it from a tax point of view and I started to read the
[1:39:04.160 --> 1:39:11.440]  Constitution from that point of view and from understanding the tax law and I
[1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:16.640]  don't want to go into it now we'll give us the skinny on it well I can go into
[1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:22.280]  the actual can go into the fact that I can show you in chapter and verse who is
[1:39:22.280 --> 1:39:27.920]  required to file tax return but if you don't file tax return you go to jail
[1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:32.180]  but what happens if you're not required to file you're considered a tax
[1:39:32.180 --> 1:39:37.280]  protest and there's court cases all over the country and there's people in
[1:39:37.280 --> 1:39:44.640]  prison who know and understand the law and how it operates and where are they
[1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:49.960]  they're buried in the jail somewhere and there's you know there's 50 or 60 of
[1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:54.520]  these people you can talk about any day of the week but they understand the law
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:40:01.080]  they understand the Constitution and a chapter and verse can show you who's
[1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:05.000]  required well I love it whenever they attack your brother on TV and they go
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:09.680]  how will we fund the government without the income tax and a lot of times he's
[1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:12.600]  standing with the Capitol in the background he goes we built that without
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:17.240]  it it is there to pay the interest to the bankers for the right to have
[1:40:17.240 --> 1:40:28.200]  currency we never had it till 1913 from 1835 till 1913 we had no central bank
[1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:36.840]  if you look at economic history during that 75 years we had more real wealth
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:44.360]  growth per capita for every person in the United States than ever conceived of
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:48.760]  by man that's right it was over 10% a year
[1:40:48.760 --> 1:41:07.760]  absolutely and what happened in November of December of 1913 Federal Reserve Act was passed by three people in the floor of the house and 20 years later in 33 we turned around and Roosevelt declared the United States bankrupt
[1:41:07.760 --> 1:41:16.280]  yep and put us into receivership of the very same megamanks today who aren't trying to fix a crisis they created it they're just
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:23.680]  shearing us again absolutely absolutely but to say that we can't run a government if we
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:31.160]  don't have a tax I would like to see some of the candidates who espouse to be
[1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:39.080]  historian tell me and read me the story about 1835 to 1930 in the real wealth
[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:44.480]  growth of this nation and try to tell me it can't be done now when you talk to
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:47.080]  your brother I mean I mean he was here a few weeks ago and I gave him some of my
[1:41:47.080 --> 1:41:49.880]  advice and he's a very humble person that he'll tell you if he agrees with
[1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:53.720]  he said no that is good advice I said go up against Obama I wouldn't even worry
[1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:56.400]  about attacking these other minions down he agreed that that should be their
[1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:59.160]  next strategy that's actually what Romney and some others have done
[1:41:59.160 --> 1:42:02.680]  effectively but the problem is it's only rhetoric with them it's not real like it
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:05.200]  is with your brother your brother says something you could take it to the bank
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:08.680]  globalists say something it's guaranteed to be a lie even if the truth would
[1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:12.920]  serve him but if you could I mean just watching this you know from afar if you
[1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:20.240]  could give the campaign advice or ideas what would it be well I only disagree
[1:42:20.240 --> 1:42:26.040]  with some of the snippet that I get to see on television because I don't get to
[1:42:26.040 --> 1:42:35.920]  see the full context of what was said but there there are times when we talk
[1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:43.320]  about for instance taxes I think it's important to know that for 75 years we
[1:42:43.320 --> 1:42:48.320]  didn't have any taxes and we ran a government that was very efficient
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:54.560]  ran it according to the Constitution in import export and excise taxes have
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:59.760]  funded every government requirement we needed for those 75 years well that's
[1:42:59.760 --> 1:43:07.640]  what China does right it's actually right so it is and I and I recognize the
[1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:13.920]  fact that when you're standing up in front of an audience how he is able to
[1:43:13.920 --> 1:43:21.600]  maintain the control and keep the positive attitude and try to answer all
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:30.120]  the questions is beyond me I he's got a power that I don't have I'm sure it's
[1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:33.160]  for me and a doctor and all those life-and-death crises it just gets to
[1:43:33.160 --> 1:43:36.440]  where you get where you can really control yourself you know if he's
[1:43:36.440 --> 1:43:44.160]  sitting over a patient and he's got to make a medical decision he turns around
[1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:50.280]  and makes the decision and lives with it in 99.9% of the time it's always been
[1:43:50.280 --> 1:43:56.320]  right yeah he's from the real world yeah and he's up there with a bunch of
[1:43:56.320 --> 1:44:01.360]  insider trading crooks who are just completely arrogant and crazy I want to
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:04.680]  ask you about the NDAA coming up but I want to bring Rob do in one of our
[1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:08.480]  investigative reporters and the director of the nightly news here because he was
[1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:12.720]  raising you know the same point of groups that are trying to get photos at the
[1:44:12.720 --> 1:44:17.120]  precincts of what the hand raised tallies were it should be posted anyways
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:21.120]  yep and so it can all be collated so we're gonna definitely follow and track
[1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:24.360]  this but then he's got some other breaking news Rob give us a report on
[1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:31.760]  that about 2 a.m. last night I got up I couldn't sleep I went online I started
[1:44:31.760 --> 1:44:34.960]  seeing a bunch of the stuff about Ron Paul in the election rigging and I watched
[1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:39.280]  that video that we're gonna show later with this Fox News tart DD Binky
[1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:43.040]  talking about how nobody in the Republican Party wants Ron Paul to win
[1:44:43.040 --> 1:44:46.840]  they're trying to figure out how to split the vote between Romney and Santorum
[1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:50.040]  but they don't want to split it too much because then Ron Paul might win and
[1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:53.760]  she called his supporters Paul bots which I think is funny coming from Fox
[1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:57.680]  News considering they love to regurgitate talking points over and over again
[1:44:57.680 --> 1:45:00.680]  and get people to robotically talk about them and then it led me on to this
[1:45:00.680 --> 1:45:06.400]  website called transparent vote net and that's the one you're talking about
[1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:10.480]  right Wayne that is correct yeah and I mean this has got a great plan and it's
[1:45:10.480 --> 1:45:15.520]  people listening in there in Iowa well all we need is 1784 people to go to each
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:18.840]  precinct what one person at each and don't worry about people doing it over
[1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:22.160]  and over again that's okay yeah don't wait for orders from headquarters go
[1:45:22.160 --> 1:45:26.160]  do it just go do it get the because if we even get part of them we can add it
[1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:29.440]  together and show fraud of us going on sure they did it in 2008 they didn't
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:32.520]  they only have and again that's why we do this even if they try to rig it
[1:45:32.520 --> 1:45:37.000]  because by engaging and we show their fraud this is how you defeat an enemy is
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:50.600]  engaging them because and one of the things the person in the precinct has to realize is one of the precinct count and the sheet is signed off on it it
[1:45:50.600 --> 1:45:57.080]  becomes public and that precinct chairman has the responsibility that if I asked to
[1:45:57.080 --> 1:46:01.840]  see it he's got to show it to me that's key they've got to show it so everybody
[1:46:01.840 --> 1:46:07.120]  get out there and do it I mean how obvious is it they're sending an anonymous the
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:10.720]  only group they protest is Ron Paul and then now the Republicans use that to
[1:46:10.720 --> 1:46:13.960]  make it secret I mean this is oh we got to take your rides because Al Qaeda I
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:16.760]  mean it's the oldest trick in the book well what's gonna happen is these
[1:46:16.760 --> 1:46:21.480]  precinct chairman they've been told to call in their results into this secret
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:24.440]  location where all the votes are gonna be tallied so we're never gonna know what
[1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:27.200]  the real results are unless people get out there and do this yeah this is how
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:31.920]  desperate the I mean they'll lie about WMD's folks they'll stage the golf the tonkin
[1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:35.120]  they'll do this you're the enemy the criminals that run this country are
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:39.400]  hijackers they hate America I mean it's really just that simple now let's get to
[1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:45.280]  DD here this is Fox News correspondent this Fox News I guess analyst as she goes
[1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:49.680]  on there we have the article at info wars.com Republican insider GOP
[1:46:49.680 --> 1:46:53.680]  establishment planning to subvert Iowa to prevent Ron Paul win I want to play
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:59.560]  some of these clips and get Wayne Paul brother Ron Paul's take on this let's
[1:46:59.560 --> 1:47:04.560]  go ahead and go to this first clip here she is on a local radio show in Iowa
[1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:10.600]  breaking this down about Ron Paul showing very well in the caucuses here
[1:47:10.600 --> 1:47:18.480]  because there's concern frankly that Iowa will caucus itself into oblivion
[1:47:18.480 --> 1:47:23.200]  and and the party will say listen if Ron Paul is what Iowa picks for us or gives
[1:47:23.200 --> 1:47:26.800]  Ron Paul this kind of prominence maybe Iowa shouldn't be first in the nation
[1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:30.880]  for our party next time around and we know that the Iowa caucuses are important
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:35.160]  to this state and to the economy is it possible that the party apparatus here
[1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:40.600]  could be silently asking those district chairmen to start swaying some
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:46.440]  important caucus members over to the answer off side which may end up being
[1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:50.280]  sadist from being the beneficiary of that is that again we're just speculating
[1:47:50.280 --> 1:47:54.520]  oh yes I really like that happening well I'm not I'm not speculating up top of
[1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:58.000]  the party official I know they're concerned about it because you know
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:02.120]  that's a significant in Iowa you know they want to keep number one in the
[1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:06.480]  nation and then if you know that nominate someone who doesn't have no
[1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:10.400]  most chance that's not good for them and they know that so now they're like all
[1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:14.240]  right you know what you know what you know what let's get to the real issue
[1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:19.080]  here you know our relevance is important the country's relevance is important
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:22.880]  Ron Paul doesn't do us any good in Iowa doesn't do the country any good we'll
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:26.280]  never get there so let's figure out what we need to do so yeah those
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:30.640]  conversations I know for a factor going on so yeah you are very right and very
[1:48:30.640 --> 1:48:34.720]  right and stew to realize that what do you where do you think of for a
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:39.480]  practical point of view now now again we have up on screen the quote there Ron
[1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:43.760]  Paul won't be allowed to win that that's coming up but I mean here is this
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:48.000]  arrogance that this is a good for the country so we're gonna decide I mean this
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:51.440]  this is crazy now what's the next clip here well she taught during this whole
[1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:55.160]  interview you can go listen to it she talks about and big props to we are
[1:48:55.160 --> 1:48:59.520]  change a Wichita who found this and sent it to us last night and at about 130
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:04.880]  but anyway she talks about how the the chairman are going to sway voters to go
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:08.160]  to a certain candidate that they think needs to be and it's definitely not
[1:49:08.160 --> 1:49:12.480]  gonna be Ron Paul but right there you hear the spin where he's saying oh this
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:16.280]  will discredit Iowa they may lose the caucus oh that's what the governor says
[1:49:16.280 --> 1:49:20.320]  exactly so they're saying if you vote you lose your right to be first I mean
[1:49:20.320 --> 1:49:24.200]  again they it's all about peer pressure it's all about trendiness we're gonna
[1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:26.880]  come back and play some more clips of this and hopefully keep Wayne to about
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:29.960]  five after I know he's got to go and get back to work but Wayne what's your take
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:34.400]  on what you just heard there's more coming up well I could they use I
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:42.160]  believe it you know they're gonna do anything they can you're right are we
[1:49:42.160 --> 1:49:46.240]  ready with the next clip here's the next part here's more of her giggling and
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:50.160]  snickering because Ron Paul's not good for America they're gonna make sure he
[1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:53.680]  doesn't win now here it is you know it's Steve I just think it's a huge struggle
[1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:56.800]  right now because I've talked about both types are like you know we think
[1:49:56.800 --> 1:50:00.120]  Romney you know we want Iowa to pick the winner and we think Rom will be the
[1:50:00.120 --> 1:50:04.160]  winner but it's like all the 10 storms work so hard and he came to my church and
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:08.600]  he came to my diner and I really like him and we think he represents Iowa so
[1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:12.360]  there's a drill split there but so there you know there are concerned about the
[1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:15.800]  Ron Paul thing because if they split that Ron Paul could be number one and they
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:22.000]  really really don't want Ron Paul to win isn't that interesting we've got one
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.960]  more clip of this coming up in fact let's go and go to that clip as we got a
[1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:30.520]  break here yeah okay we're gonna come back from break then and I get to the
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:39.000]  rest of that but more comments on this Wayne well it concerns me I understand
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:44.520]  where they're coming from but that's no balls rolling down the hill and they're
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:48.080]  not gonna be able to stop it they're gonna just try they'll attempt to do
[1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:56.160]  anything that they can but I have to believe that this is under somebody else's
[1:50:56.160 --> 1:50:59.320]  control and they're not gonna be able to stop it yeah they're running around like
[1:50:59.320 --> 1:51:02.640]  chickens with their heads cut off we'll be back does being over 40 make you feel

[1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:23.320]  sunshine everybody needs to get this article at info wars.com out to
[1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:29.120]  everyone you know Republican insider GOP establishment planning to subvert
[1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:34.160]  Iowa to prevent Ron Paul win and there she thinks this is just normal to say
[1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:38.560]  the campaign you know the local chairman the local Republican bigwigs are
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:44.520]  gonna have to sway things for our state or for Iowa or it'll be discredited this
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:48.520]  idea that you know if you vote for Ron Paul it discredits the state so we're
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:52.840]  doing this for your own good it just they're out of touch their arrogance
[1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:57.960]  there they're insane arrogance that that she would say this on a radio program
[1:54:57.960 --> 1:55:02.120]  and the host are getting off on it they're all enjoying it feeling like
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:06.040]  they're playing along with the script and part of the system most people that
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:10.320]  serve the new world order are not even part of it they just regurgitate because
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:14.560]  they know they go up the ladder if they do yeah but now they see the system being
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:17.880]  shut down you're gonna be thrown off that ladder okay it's good that this is
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:21.320]  coming out because it really shows these people's true colors that they don't
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:25.200]  have honest intentions for a fair election well it's more than that
[1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:28.480]  they're right they're saying we're the elitist we know best and we're gonna
[1:55:28.480 --> 1:55:32.400]  pressure people to do this and we're gonna make sure they say it publicly
[1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:36.480]  because they've been operating in the open when nobody opposing them for so
[1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:40.400]  long here comes Ron Paul and says here's the Constitution and act like
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:46.680]  vampires at high noon he's a normal person he's not like us he's bad no
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:49.920]  you're bad let's go to the rest of the clip and get Wayne Paul's take on this
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:54.520]  here's the rest of it a lot of those wrong people coming in because well you
[1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:59.040]  know they'll be coming from school and they're gonna be I don't know I kind of
[1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:02.080]  think they're gonna be able to keep them from from getting the number one spot
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:05.560]  because they are concerned and they get that and they you know they had so much
[1:56:05.560 --> 1:56:09.680]  change with the schedule with you know Florida just making everything crazy
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:13.680]  you know and so Iowa knows that you know they're kind of on chopping block here
[1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:18.000]  they could be so that's very important to them so I'm sure that there are a lot
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:21.400]  of discussions and trying to figure out you know where the votes you want to go
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:26.160]  and I will take this one positive that the party apparatus is very tightly knit
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:30.280]  like it is in Indiana it's very similar so they're trying to figure it out right
[1:56:30.280 --> 1:56:35.840]  now I mean between Romney and the Santorum and how they deal with the
[1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:39.920]  Paul box and you know they're not gonna want him to get number one it's very
[1:56:39.920 --> 1:56:45.160]  bad for Iowa it's terrified if he wins the biggest losers absolutely Iowa so I
[1:56:45.160 --> 1:56:48.440]  hope for my friend that I would you know he had hope that doesn't happen yeah I
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:52.600]  just want to make sure this is devastating and I should have led with
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:56.080]  this today I saw it and never even I'm glad you came up said Alex why aren't
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:56:59.400]  you covering this and I'm glad that you know Wayne brought up the other issue
[1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:02.680]  because I'm just so used to this I'm like well it's part of the course but the
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:07.080]  public doesn't understand the insiders are very tightly knit and the two
[1:57:07.080 --> 1:57:11.040]  reporters are getting off on being let in on the goodie they think we're so
[1:57:11.040 --> 1:57:15.280]  blind culturally spiritually intellectually they can just parade around
[1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:18.600]  in front of us you heard her yeah there's gonna be all the young people
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:22.320]  from the schools how horrible the young people involved I mean it's just this
[1:57:22.320 --> 1:57:26.920]  just this this loving feeling or part of the establishment was that not
[1:57:26.920 --> 1:57:32.120]  disgusting Wayne Paul it sure was but let me point out the other side of the
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:41.560]  coin the Republican Party control of Iowa have their head in the sand they
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:49.840]  have an opportunity to bring on independence and young voters like
[1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:55.200]  they've never seen in their life no they are discrediting their own state they
[1:57:55.200 --> 1:58:01.560]  are they are totally shooting themselves in the foot because they don't
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:08.560]  even care if their party grows in Iowa they don't care if they don't have more
[1:58:08.560 --> 1:58:14.040]  people yet they have a golden opportunity exactly most parties say they
[1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:18.360]  want to grow the party notice they don't want to do that no it's carable
[1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:21.960]  young people are getting involved heavens heavens forbid the average age at
[1:58:21.960 --> 1:58:26.000]  the Iowa caucus voter is 60 so there you go there's a big chance to bring in
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  some youth some some new ideas and you get things but look look even if they
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:33.800]  derail Ron Paul this round and as Wayne said the momentum you can feel it
[1:58:33.800 --> 1:58:38.240]  it's big it's 10 times what it was four years ago it doesn't matter we win by

[2:00:20.040 --> 2:00:28.600]  Alex Jones well your message your mission if you should choose to accept it
[2:00:28.600 --> 2:00:32.920]  is to get this article out to everyone I know that Wayne Ron Paul's brother who's
[2:00:32.920 --> 2:00:38.360]  very involved is gonna get it directly to his brother Republican insider GOP
[2:00:38.360 --> 2:00:42.560]  establishment planning to subvert Iowa to prevent Ron Paul she said the party's
[2:00:42.560 --> 2:00:45.960]  very concerned and they're gonna do something well we know what they've
[2:00:45.960 --> 2:00:50.680]  got anonymous out there protesting Ron Paul clearly works for them they're so
[2:00:50.680 --> 2:00:54.240]  stupid they can't even hide that now running around having it moved to a
[2:00:54.240 --> 2:00:59.760]  secret location okay and now they've got their operatives on the radio saying oh
[2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:04.680]  don't worry we're gonna fix it I mean Ron Paul probably needs to come out and
[2:01:04.680 --> 2:01:11.160]  point this out but Wayne you wanted to add some points to this well the biggest
[2:01:11.160 --> 2:01:16.320]  point I want to add is the fact that the Republican Party of Iowa shooting
[2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:21.840]  themselves in a foot they have an opportunity to do this double their
[2:01:21.840 --> 2:01:27.920]  size and their enthusiasm with young people to turn around and help
[2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:35.320]  Republicans win in Iowa and all over the country and they don't want it they
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:41.240]  they can't they they don't know what to do with it and until that changes and it
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:45.840]  is changing because it's changing in Texas we've got a lot more people in a
[2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:52.480]  grassroots in Texas set up with the Republican Party of Texas and and come
[2:01:52.480 --> 2:01:55.920]  March or April when we have our primaries here they're gonna have another
[2:01:55.920 --> 2:02:00.920]  wake-up call I thought it was called the Perry Party of Texas people are really
[2:02:00.920 --> 2:02:06.480]  waking up in Texas yeah but I mean you see Ron Paul stickers everywhere I mean
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:12.000]  I'm saying you see Ron Paul stickers everywhere oh yeah and one one of the
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:19.280]  chairman of one of the largest precincts Taren County Texas is a fervent Ron Paul
[2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:23.800]  supporter and she is one of the termanship I was in South Carolina over
[2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:29.120]  Christmas and I saw 20 to 30 Ron Paul signs in the yards including a huge one
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:32.760]  right by this highway one of the main highways there and this is a state that
[2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:37.640]  the governor came out and endorsed Mitt Ron a new Gingrich so I mean and
[2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:41.680]  there's I didn't see one new Gingrich one Mitt Romney signed not one Rick Santorum
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:46.440]  signed all Ron Paul well us the board great job do breaking this down for us

[2:03:28.080 --> 2:03:34.000]  change is needed and I think every citizen of the United States can look

[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:47.040]  understand what's going on and we fight for our liberty it's all going to start

[2:03:50.980 --> 2:03:55.240]  globalist documents they always talk about the problem of shutting economies
[2:03:55.240 --> 2:03:59.920]  down that things grow too quick and that that destroys their monopoly their
[2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:03.640]  centralization that's what they admit the federal reserves for as you know to
[2:04:03.640 --> 2:04:08.000]  shut down our productivity because they want us dependent living on a tiny
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:17.080]  chicken feed welfare check yeah the new world order has got to be worried Wayne

[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:39.960]  how we're going to try to stop fraud in Iowa now again anonymous shows up and
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:46.520]  says we're mad about the Iowa caucuses and we're going to disrupt things again
[2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:49.480]  anonymous is just a cutout name the government can use and then blame on
[2:08:49.480 --> 2:08:53.840]  activism not saying everybody in anonymous is bad like Occupy Wall Street
[2:08:53.840 --> 2:08:59.680]  it's a pool so Soros and and those people on record created Occupy Wall
[2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:04.960]  Street put the call out they didn't put any facts or or a manifesto look at
[2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:09.360]  when somebody didn't tell you what they stand for that's always what a honey
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:14.520]  pot or an intelligence operation does I'm the treadmill this morning I was
[2:09:14.520 --> 2:09:19.080]  watching American gangster just based on true story it's got what Denzel
[2:09:19.080 --> 2:09:22.720]  Washington in it and he's got one of the guys that works for him as a drug dealer
[2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:25.960]  he comes over to him and the guys made a bunch of money so he's wearing a pimp
[2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:30.760]  suit fur coat and hat and he goes that's a arrest me outfit you're wearing take
[2:09:30.760 --> 2:09:34.400]  that off that's why I'm always telling militia people why are you at city
[2:09:34.400 --> 2:09:39.160]  council in Southeast Asia camo Vietnam was 30 something years ago I'm not
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:42.280]  making fun of people that want to dress up in camo and go out and do war games
[2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:47.800]  in the woods the point is that that you go to a militia meeting and there's
[2:09:47.800 --> 2:09:51.120]  three feds they're saying what's blow stuff up and they think you're so dumb
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:54.440]  you go outside they're driving unmarked police cars you know the point is just
[2:09:54.440 --> 2:09:59.400]  don't be stupid we're out front we're the good guys we're at city council in a
[2:09:59.400 --> 2:10:03.760]  button-up shirt or a suit and tie we're the good guys we're not hiding in what
[2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:10.200]  we're doing and I've now digressed off into that but you know the the issue is
[2:10:10.200 --> 2:10:14.400]  they're trying to frame us as the outsiders we're the common sense people
[2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:21.640]  here now your phone calls are coming up here at 800 259 92 31 here in just a
[2:10:21.640 --> 2:10:26.320]  moment but I wanted to go back to Rob do will be covering this more on the
[2:10:26.320 --> 2:10:31.520]  nightly news tonight we'll have more on the Iowa caucuses by them Republican
[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:36.600]  insider GOP establishment planning to subvert Iowa to prevent Ron Paul win and
[2:10:36.600 --> 2:10:42.120]  it's not even veiled and the hosts are getting off on this they're all getting
[2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:45.480]  off on like dress up like a four-year-old girl dressing up like a
[2:10:45.480 --> 2:10:49.320]  fairy or a princess you're not a fairy or not a princess they're all dressing up
[2:10:49.320 --> 2:10:53.120]  like like they're part of the power structure you know I've been to different
[2:10:53.120 --> 2:10:56.640]  political meetings before and they'll be just your regular citizens they're
[2:10:56.640 --> 2:11:01.840]  getting off on these power trips repeating the talking points of the county
[2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:07.260]  chairman and and getting off on huh we're going to strategize and and win
[2:11:07.260 --> 2:11:13.040]  we're going to and it's it's so pathetic to see a nation led by fools I
[2:11:13.040 --> 2:11:17.000]  mean that's like Herman Cain didn't know that North Korea had nuclear weapons
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:22.920]  who was it Sarah Palin thought South Korea was the enemy again the people
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:28.480]  they choose are political morons look when you get into the real world it's
[2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:33.080]  addicting to learn places capitals things facts you know how little you know
[2:11:33.080 --> 2:11:36.960]  but compared to somebody thinks they know it all that's why it's so refreshing
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:40.680]  interviewer Ron Paul there's never any news item he doesn't know about you know
[2:11:40.680 --> 2:11:45.040]  why he's obsessed with the truth he knows the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[2:11:45.040 --> 2:11:49.680]  he knows history he knows the facts so he gets up and says Israel created Hamas
[2:11:49.680 --> 2:11:53.520]  they run a national ad saying he hates as real and is evil it's Harats and
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:59.120]  Jerusalem Post and Wall Street Journal I showed you the articles earlier I
[2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:05.600]  showed you the information earlier I mean it's like Ron Paul says water is wet
[2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:10.320]  and they go this is insane he says porcupine has spot spines he says a
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:15.560]  giraffe has a long neck and they're like that's insane he says fire is hot they
[2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:21.680]  go that's crazy and they're now there they're so full of themselves all these
[2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:26.920]  con artists that can't followers that they get on radio over multi-state areas
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:31.080]  and and and snicker about blocking somebody and he's not gonna win and
[2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:35.080]  that's done cynically so that Ron Paul voters on the fence think well I won't
[2:12:35.080 --> 2:12:39.520]  throw my vote away I won't discredit my state as if Ron Paul standing for
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:43.560]  election discredited your state no the control freaks telling you you're
[2:12:43.560 --> 2:12:48.400]  discredited are trying to discredit the entire electoral process Rob do break it
[2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:52.160]  down yeah they're definitely trying to hijack it this came this was in the
[2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:56.480]  email that that took me to transparent vote net which I think we crashed when
[2:12:56.480 --> 2:13:00.640]  we talked about it because I went back to it at the break and it was down so
[2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:05.920]  have patience get on there become a member of it and then upload those videos
[2:13:05.920 --> 2:13:09.640]  if you're in Iowa it's definitely important to go there but it was reported
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:12.760]  to me that each precinct vote is tally tomorrow night the captain is to call
[2:13:12.760 --> 2:13:16.480]  a an 800 number in a secret location which we already reported this was going
[2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:21.160]  on and the count and that they're only to give the count to the person on that
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:25.440]  line and so it's very important that people that violate state election law
[2:13:25.440 --> 2:13:30.560]  sure and so we need they're supposed to publish it right totally and right there
[2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:35.000]  it's on man yeah no and all we need is less than 2,000 people who really care
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:37.920]  about this country even if you're not a Ron Paul supporter get out there and
[2:13:37.920 --> 2:13:40.840]  let's see the results let's let's have an honest election and look so then we
[2:13:40.840 --> 2:13:45.480]  can really talk there's folks with bigger servers that can step up we could
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:50.080]  duplicate this pretty quickly or we can make sure it's all saved you know email
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:52.960]  it all the Ron Paul campaign yeah because this can always be put together
[2:13:52.960 --> 2:13:56.880]  later exactly to show the fraud yeah and then the the other big one is New
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:00.600]  Hampshire you know they need people for New Hampshire to to step up and go out
[2:14:00.600 --> 2:14:04.200]  there and get the real count get a picture of the count the signed card
[2:14:04.200 --> 2:14:08.440]  however they do it and then put that on the web so other people can do it and
[2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:11.320]  then people tabulated there's plenty of people out there that'll do well what we
[2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:16.120]  need is the is the people there at all the caucus points with the state law in
[2:14:16.120 --> 2:14:19.680]  fact we ought to go dig that up I know it's there and Wayne just mentioned it
[2:14:19.680 --> 2:14:23.080]  but I know that's the case in all of these if you want to see those published
[2:14:23.080 --> 2:14:27.120]  because especially in Iowa that's all supposed to be open they're supposed to
[2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:31.200]  publish it put up on the wall yeah and but but but notice the Republicans are
[2:14:31.200 --> 2:14:35.200]  for your safety it'll be secret tell no one but the special person you'll be
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:39.160]  calling yeah and who knows who that in the meanwhile you know they're running
[2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:42.440]  around saying don't worry we'll deal with it he's not gonna win oh yeah they're
[2:14:42.440 --> 2:14:47.120]  openly proclaiming that they're gonna sway voters to go to either Santorum or
[2:14:47.120 --> 2:14:50.960]  Romney because those two have a chance you know and and I don't think either
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:54.400]  one of them have a chance up against Obama honestly they're both Paul does
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:14:57.800]  better in polls than they do sure and I keep hearing this new talking point by
[2:14:57.800 --> 2:15:02.160]  all the repeaters all the jellyfish brains I heard on local radio Ron Paul
[2:15:02.160 --> 2:15:05.720]  can't beat Obama he does bad he's actually in like six polls I've seen or
[2:15:05.720 --> 2:15:09.680]  more in the last month is beat some of the biggest numbers yeah they know that
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:14.360]  they just again the liars on top know it but all these childlike people think
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:19.380]  it's like real cool to repeat what some liars said it's like NFL stats or
[2:15:19.380 --> 2:15:22.040]  something you know it's just it's meaningless half of it you know it
[2:15:22.040 --> 2:15:25.680]  doesn't even matter yeah like you you watch the the sports center she can go
[2:15:25.680 --> 2:15:30.480]  down to the bar after you watch it sir on your buddies and impress them yeah did
[2:15:30.480 --> 2:15:36.080]  you see Drew Brees although I'm a Saints fan I like Drew Brees look at you look
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:40.400]  what you've turned into I'm just teasing no I mean my whole issue is our whole
[2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:42.960]  country's going down they're getting rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:46.840]  they say they're gonna sign us all on to a thousand plus trillion and we're all
[2:15:46.840 --> 2:15:51.240]  gonna be bankrupt and I'm just like folks we better get concerned it'd be like if
[2:15:51.240 --> 2:15:54.840]  you came home and your house was on fire and flames are shooting out of the top
[2:15:54.840 --> 2:15:58.160]  story and instead of calling the fire department you said I'm gonna go in and
[2:15:58.160 --> 2:16:02.920]  turn on sports center I mean it's mentally ill I total it's man and these
[2:16:02.920 --> 2:16:06.800]  men get so obsessed with it it's their little so they want you to talk about it
[2:16:06.800 --> 2:16:10.600]  and then you're weird when you're actually into the real world and not into
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:14.240]  their little you know the you know the jock that they've got a sexual
[2:16:14.240 --> 2:16:17.920]  fantasy for yeah people should be obsessed with this because this is where
[2:16:17.920 --> 2:16:21.680]  we're gonna at least start turning this thing around though in the direction our
[2:16:21.680 --> 2:16:24.960]  country's going in because right now it's going to a dark place and you know
[2:16:24.960 --> 2:16:30.200]  Ron Paul's one step in the change process there's many others and well it
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:33.680]  shows the people are waking up we're doing our job and that's why the system's
[2:16:33.680 --> 2:16:37.000]  like okay we will start shutting down free speech on the web okay we will start
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:40.440]  arresting people okay we will start because they're scared because they're
[2:16:40.440 --> 2:16:44.160]  a bunch of dirty crooks they can all end up going to jail like made off in Ken
[2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:48.960]  Lane but that's why it's a test with the head of MF Global to see if they can
[2:16:48.960 --> 2:16:52.840]  take money get caught lying in Congress and notice he didn't in trouble no
[2:16:52.840 --> 2:16:57.360]  nothing's happened and boy let me tell you Gerald Zelente's hopping mad about
[2:16:57.360 --> 2:17:00.760]  this I mean he's they've they changed his bank statements essentially and said
[2:17:00.760 --> 2:17:04.800]  no now you owe us money after we stole your money you owe us more money it's
[2:17:04.800 --> 2:17:09.080]  it's and it's all on record and folks no one people keep sending me emails us
[2:17:09.080 --> 2:17:12.720]  he comments going but I don't do anything I don't nothing to hide let
[2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:18.080]  there be a tyranny don't you get it tyrants want to shut down free markets
[2:17:18.080 --> 2:17:22.640]  they want to screw up societies they want post industrial world because they
[2:17:22.640 --> 2:17:27.200]  like to control you they want you poor they want to consolidate everything
[2:17:27.200 --> 2:17:31.280]  they're coming after you because you're gullible and have gone along with them
[2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:35.320]  why I mean it's like a gazelle saying I didn't do anything to that lion I don't
[2:17:35.320 --> 2:17:38.480]  know why it just you know it wants to eat me I'm not gonna hide from the lion or
[2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:42.760]  stay out of its way or run from it because because I don't I'm nothing
[2:17:42.760 --> 2:17:49.040]  against the lion it's a lion it's going to eat you it's it's it's the same
[2:17:49.040 --> 2:17:52.560]  reason in criminology that women will get in cars with somebody wearing a
[2:17:52.560 --> 2:17:56.760]  suit and tie the psychopaths will dress up in suits and ties clean haircuts hey
[2:17:56.760 --> 2:18:00.560]  how you doing let me give you a ride you getting off work here at the mall yeah
[2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:05.200]  I'll get a cup of coffee won't have some fun well sure come on get on in with me
[2:18:05.200 --> 2:18:08.840]  then but they would never get in the car with somebody looks like a homeless
[2:18:08.840 --> 2:18:12.040]  person who chances are actually wouldn't hurt you right if you study the
[2:18:12.040 --> 2:18:17.120]  criminology because because well you know Rick Perry's wearing a suit Mitt
[2:18:17.120 --> 2:18:21.000]  Romney's wearing a suit look out folks but I mean what can you say about
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:25.200]  Republicans when it's known that Mitt Romney is for abortion open borders
[2:18:25.200 --> 2:18:30.240]  carbon taxes Obamacare and gun control yeah I mean my you people are and you
[2:18:30.240 --> 2:18:34.040]  talk about how your patriots and Ron Paul's bad and you're too ignorant to
[2:18:34.040 --> 2:18:38.840]  even know who he is look just remember when if Ron Paul doesn't get elected we
[2:18:38.840 --> 2:18:43.440]  don't turn this around remember why your whole future is destroyed I mean these
[2:18:43.440 --> 2:18:47.880]  grown men literally obsessed over being fearful of the Arabs all day and you got
[2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:51.160]  a better chance of being killed by a rattlesnake or champagne cork or a
[2:18:51.160 --> 2:18:56.440]  coconut or a coconut falling on you out of a tree I mean they live to get off on
[2:18:56.440 --> 2:19:01.960]  the fear that they are they they live to be cowards they would do anything they
[2:19:01.960 --> 2:19:05.800]  would give up all their rights all their liberties to call to talk radio and say
[2:19:05.800 --> 2:19:09.560]  Alex Jones loves the Muslims and one is a terrorist I heard that last week on
[2:19:09.560 --> 2:19:15.160]  National Show and the host is like oh yes it's all true and because it just
[2:19:15.160 --> 2:19:18.640]  feels good tribally to be like part of a club and meanwhile if you tell the you
[2:19:18.640 --> 2:19:22.440]  know the so-called good old boy hey the government actually runs all kind of
[2:19:22.440 --> 2:19:26.680]  here's the proof it's just showed up traitor ain't true ain't true they're
[2:19:26.680 --> 2:19:30.880]  children Rob yeah that's why they're all I can't believe Rob Paul says Israel
[2:19:30.880 --> 2:19:35.020]  started Hamas it's in the Wall Street Journal and Jerusalem post I mean can't
[2:19:35.020 --> 2:19:40.480]  we live in reality little boy yeah don't you ever call Obama supporters idiots

[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:49.440]  have their guns taken they want open borders they want their wages driven

[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:49.080]  funded a prostitute operation the zombie control system the zombie control
[2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:53.840]  signal will come out and say it's a conspiracy theory I mean you could have
[2:24:53.840 --> 2:24:58.320]  them you could have them publicly say we're stealing it now and have it all
[2:24:58.320 --> 2:25:04.120]  on video nationally on TV they would still say well totally reasonable
[2:25:04.120 --> 2:25:11.000]  that's how dumb they think you are well whatever we are turning the tide the
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:14.960]  people are waking up and not buying any more every number we've got shows it the
[2:25:14.960 --> 2:25:19.000]  media is not the media it's discredited and that's why they're trying to come
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:23.720]  in and start shutting things down because they're a pack of propagandist for
[2:25:23.720 --> 2:25:27.200]  criminal interests that have hijacked this country through fraud and nothing's

[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:50.000]  new act the National Defense Authorization Act I don't think it's bad to
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:53.080]  let the criminals know we're aware of it but yeah find out those that voted for
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:56.880]  there's list of it and call them but that's why they signed the NDA because
[2:26:56.880 --> 2:26:59.800]  they know you're calling them they know you know their criminals they know they
[2:26:59.800 --> 2:27:04.360]  have a 9% approval rating they know they insider trade publicly and I and help
[2:27:04.360 --> 2:27:08.920]  ship narcotics into the country and guns out of it I mean they're caught they
[2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:12.600]  know their criminals they know we know but yeah call them and let's just call
[2:27:12.600 --> 2:27:16.920]  them let them know that you know their criminals yes sir we need to use our
[2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:22.000]  avenues that are still open my mother grew up under Hitler's tyranny and she
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:26.640]  told me how Hitler took over she grew up in Austria he did the same way he said
[2:27:26.640 --> 2:27:30.080]  be patriotic and lick the government's boots or you're a terrorist I'm sorry
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:34.440]  go ahead tell us what she told you well she said that the first election Hitler
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:39.400]  was in what there were two people on the ballot and every election after that
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:44.240]  there was only one person on the ballot and that was Hitler we are really at
[2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:49.080]  the we are at a very dangerous time we really need to jump up and down right
[2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:53.760]  now yeah really grab grab our rights back mr. we need to grab them back I
[2:27:53.760 --> 2:27:58.080]  agree instead the bankers just finance both parties and always have a stable
[2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:02.100]  of little puppets that don't even know where South Korea is you know Sarah
[2:28:02.100 --> 2:28:08.240]  Palin South Korea's got nukes and and you know Herman Cain you know didn't know
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:12.800]  that China had nukes I mean it's just insane I mean they've got a bunch of
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:17.920]  insane morons when you see those politicians most of them are nobodies
[2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:22.560]  they couldn't figure out how to tie their shoelaces politically but it's the
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:26.440]  controllers above them now when you see a Lindsey Graham or you see a Jay
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:32.000]  Rockefeller or you see a Lieberman or you see a McCain that's a demon I mean
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:35.760]  when they're up there celebrating butchering the bill of rights and and
[2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:39.720]  and getting excited and and Lindsey Graham hopping around on stage we played
[2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:43.360]  last night going we're gonna arrest citizens and when you ask for lawyer
[2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:50.080]  we're gonna say no lawyer for you I mean just some scary power tripping just
[2:28:50.080 --> 2:28:55.720]  just prancing pansy currents are usually little limp-wristed pansies for
[2:28:55.720 --> 2:28:59.000]  whatever reason they like to prance around and I'm just sick of them all
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:03.600]  anything else ma'am yes sir they didn't know at the time what was hitting them
[2:29:03.600 --> 2:29:08.560]  they don't they were fooled they were like we you know like some of us are they
[2:29:08.560 --> 2:29:14.960]  thought oh he's gonna help us after war yes and and also the deep the currency
[2:29:14.960 --> 2:29:20.160]  was worth nothing but that's the deal and that the Hitler type stuff comes
[2:29:20.160 --> 2:29:25.040]  next this banker breakdown that's what the system's gonna call for a
[2:29:25.040 --> 2:29:29.080]  dictatorship is the answer to problems and then the real answer is going the
[2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:32.040]  opposite direction great points good to hear from you appreciate you're holding
[2:29:32.040 --> 2:29:42.040]  alright vulture Andrew Leon Jeff and we got vulture we also have a cabler
[2:29:42.040 --> 2:29:45.240]  darling we're gonna be right back on the other side with your phone call
[2:29:45.240 --> 2:29:49.640]  straight ahead I'm going right into him bam bam bam 800 to 5 and 99 do the
[2:29:49.640 --> 2:29:56.440]  rewind we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[2:29:56.440 --> 2:30:03.960]  network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[2:30:03.960 --> 2:30:08.320]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[2:30:08.320 --> 2:30:12.520]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[2:30:12.520 --> 2:30:16.520]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[2:30:16.520 --> 2:30:20.400]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[2:30:20.400 --> 2:30:24.640]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:30:24.640 --> 2:30:28.880]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[2:30:28.880 --> 2:30:33.160]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[2:30:33.160 --> 2:30:36.880]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[2:30:36.880 --> 2:30:41.080]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[2:30:41.080 --> 2:30:44.440]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[2:30:44.440 --> 2:30:48.080]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[2:30:48.080 --> 2:30:53.720]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[2:30:53.720 --> 2:31:02.080]  doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[2:31:02.080 --> 2:31:05.680]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[2:31:05.680 --> 2:31:10.400]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[2:31:10.400 --> 2:31:14.320]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the

[2:32:01.160 --> 2:32:05.960]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[2:32:05.960 --> 2:32:10.520]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[2:32:10.520 --> 2:32:14.480]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[2:32:14.480 --> 2:32:19.160]  turned menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[2:32:19.160 --> 2:32:23.760]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[2:32:23.760 --> 2:32:28.000]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:33.080]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and
[2:32:33.080 --> 2:32:37.040]  on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their
[2:32:37.040 --> 2:32:40.840]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[2:32:40.840 --> 2:32:44.680]  do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[2:33:46.040 --> 2:33:49.320]  here and he actually ran in the studio I had to kick him out of here before I

[2:35:03.800 --> 2:35:07.800]  go back to the calls vulture in Oklahoma you're on the air welcome
[2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:13.240]  hey how you doing Alex I'm doing good but I'm here with an al-qaeda operative
[2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:17.640]  it supports Ron Paul this dog does so it's not a good person to extremist
[2:35:18.200 --> 2:35:28.200]  operative too and I don't act I'm a veteran and I know I'm going to be targeted later on
[2:35:28.840 --> 2:35:33.400]  I'm probably on some fusion list right now for even calling in and having my Ron Paul
[2:35:33.400 --> 2:35:38.440]  flag outside so oh you got a Ron Paul flag I mean we've got the homeland security memos
[2:35:38.440 --> 2:35:43.240]  they tell cops you see that it's a terrorist I mean if somebody actually supports what America's
[2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:50.760]  founded on that's bad again I want to say this America doesn't exist anymore except in our minds
[2:35:50.760 --> 2:35:55.640]  the criminals that run the government are our admitted criminals the White House has been
[2:35:55.640 --> 2:36:01.080]  caught shipping guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and drugs back in it's in all
[2:36:01.080 --> 2:36:07.400]  the court documents but the dinosaur media will only cover 1% of that it's actually come out in
[2:36:07.400 --> 2:36:13.800]  the New York Times now but the point is these are criminals these are criminals none of us are safe
[2:36:13.800 --> 2:36:20.280]  until they're removed I'm sorry go ahead well no no doubt I agree with you there and I have first
[2:36:20.280 --> 2:36:24.200]  hand experience with dealing with these people I used to work for the Oklahoma Supreme Court here
[2:36:24.200 --> 2:36:31.400]  and you know I've dealt with the some of the justices and these people do not think like most
[2:36:31.400 --> 2:36:36.360]  people walking around they look at us like we're animals I've even heard one of them say that
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:41.720]  that we are you know regular people are animals well they do they put chemicals in the food and
[2:36:41.720 --> 2:36:45.960]  water they treat us just like animals they manipulate us just like animals and they get
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:51.960]  this incredible arrogance but only by us buying into their lives do we become animals tell me
[2:36:51.960 --> 2:36:58.760]  more about how they call us animals well you know people get to keep people get to talking
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:03.160]  when they have a few drinks and I've been to a few events where you know these are the kind
[2:37:03.160 --> 2:37:08.920]  of folks that they like to drink you know that's that's their that's their cup of tea and you know
[2:37:08.920 --> 2:37:14.440]  they're their true self come out I mean they have a fake front they put up for everybody and and
[2:37:14.440 --> 2:37:19.960]  then there's you know there's there's there's the real person behind it and you know especially alcohol
[2:37:19.960 --> 2:37:25.240]  that's that's that's a that's the drug that that's the truth bringer more than any any of them out
[2:37:25.240 --> 2:37:33.800]  there uh people act act the true nature no it's the it's the uh it's the truth serum exactly so
[2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:38.440]  yeah like I guess back in the day when I drink some I buy everybody dinner but people that aren't
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:44.600]  very nice start acting all crazy when they've been drinking now now now let's expand on this
[2:37:44.600 --> 2:37:50.280]  well uh what'd you originally call in about vulture well I originally called in because uh
[2:37:50.280 --> 2:37:56.280]  the reason I left working there I started seeing some things that they were doing some things they
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:38:02.120]  were trying to put in place and uh you know after being a listener for your you know with your show
[2:38:02.120 --> 2:38:06.360]  for a couple years and working where I worked and seeing the things that I saw and the attitudes
[2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:12.680]  you know towards you know people and in general and uh the architecture they were putting in for
[2:38:12.680 --> 2:38:19.240]  their new tracking for people across the state it's the new software they're wanting to put in
[2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:25.240]  it's a unified case management system and this will allow them to swipe your card and I know this
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:31.800]  is available in some other states but there's a big push to nationalize it uh you'll be able to
[2:38:31.800 --> 2:38:35.800]  swipe your card when you get pulled over it'll bring up every bit of information about you though
[2:38:35.800 --> 2:38:40.920]  they won't have to deal with dispatch anymore uh and if you're wanted for something on the other
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:45.640]  side of the state they'll be able to you know haul you in right then in there you get transported
[2:38:46.360 --> 2:38:52.680]  and it's it's all part and again that would be great except that criminals run the system
[2:38:52.680 --> 2:38:58.760]  and so they're undoubtedly the entire architecture of it is pointed at the american people and the
[2:38:58.760 --> 2:39:03.240]  tyrants in many cases and there are some good members of congress some good members you know
[2:39:03.240 --> 2:39:08.920]  some good judges out there but by and large more and more the criminals the control freaks the tyrants
[2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:16.280]  are recruiting their brethren into more and more positions as as the public wakes up to them
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:21.000]  they're going to get more and more disgusted with us and and have more and more hatred for us
[2:39:23.080 --> 2:39:28.280]  well i i scared that i'm i'm scared of the in game like i said i know because i'm a veteran i'm
[2:39:28.280 --> 2:39:34.840]  going to be targeted and i tell you one reason one reason above all veterans are going to be
[2:39:34.840 --> 2:39:41.000]  targeted and it's because we have the training and the ability to create other soldiers now that's
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:46.280]  it force multipliers look i appreciate your call but listen don't be afraid of them coming after you
[2:39:46.280 --> 2:39:50.680]  and i understand you're concerned that's what you mean by afraid be afraid that you're not
[2:39:50.680 --> 2:39:57.000]  going to make every day as full as it should be and treat every day as if it's your last so many
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:40:01.800]  times i look at myself in the mirror before i drive into work i'm brushing my teeth and i think
[2:40:01.800 --> 2:40:08.920]  you could do a lot better job you do this radio and tv so much that it just becomes routine and
[2:40:08.920 --> 2:40:15.480]  you don't rise to the occasion of the magnitude of what you're doing do this next radio show like
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:21.640]  it's your last day i mean i've given speeches to the city council of austin you've seen it in the
[2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:29.000]  matrix of evil and i remember martin sheen and um melio estives that's what turned them on to my
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  show somebody gave them the videotape of that and they were so amazed because you watch it it is like
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:38.040]  a movie some closing argument and and and we didn't have the votes to defeat the patriot act here in
[2:40:38.040 --> 2:40:43.880]  town and have them have a law against it and say that they would uphold the constitution but my speech
[2:40:43.880 --> 2:40:50.280]  turned them in the speech of others and they said some of them to actually vote against the patriot
[2:40:50.280 --> 2:40:55.640]  act and for the constitution but the point is we all have that capability to really communicate
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:41:03.640]  and really cut through all the baloney and really reach people and uh also want to challenge you
[2:41:03.640 --> 2:41:08.760]  out there because every time i get mad at myself i remember hey at least i'm taking action i'm you
[2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:14.680]  know i'm getting in the arena every day and that's why we've been effective uh and yes we should treat
[2:41:14.680 --> 2:41:20.600]  every day like it's our last but now is the time to reach out to people across the board now is the
[2:41:20.600 --> 2:41:25.800]  time to do banner hangs now is the time to call in the talk radio now is the time to send emails now
[2:41:25.800 --> 2:41:30.600]  is the time to shoot your own youtube videos just talking about issues whether they got a hundred
[2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:37.960]  views or ten thousand now is the time to go get a local access tv show or go buy an hour a week on
[2:41:37.960 --> 2:41:42.600]  the local talk station on the weekend if a show gets popular you know in two years or a year you
[2:41:42.600 --> 2:41:48.520]  might end up on weekdays being paid to be on a lot of people done done that what i told them to do
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:53.960]  uh i mean i was blessed i was paid day one to be on the radio because i went and did an access tv
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:42:00.040]  show but paid to be on there a paltry sum and then they saw i had quote talent and were and
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:04.920]  they were patriots i put me on the air then other management came in and tried to tell me not to do
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:11.480]  that and then they fired me but that it didn't matter i had been launched and so many people
[2:42:11.480 --> 2:42:15.800]  called me and they say yeah i went and paid for an hour on sundays and it got popular and so they
[2:42:15.800 --> 2:42:20.600]  gave me two hours and now they've got me filling in for the other host during the week when they're
[2:42:20.600 --> 2:42:27.000]  gone and then they call back now i've been given a weeknight show and and i've got tens of thousands
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:34.040]  of listeners look you're only there was a fellow who works for rand paul's campaign i'll just leave
[2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:40.520]  it at that uh well works in his office in a prominent role and he was one of my listeners
[2:42:40.520 --> 2:42:46.440]  and so he went and volunteered went when when you heard rand paul basically launches candidacy here
[2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:51.240]  and it was our listeners that showed the first interests uh you know the first interest to get
[2:42:51.240 --> 2:42:56.920]  him kind of to go ahead and go for it and so most the people that went and volunteered day one were
[2:42:56.920 --> 2:43:03.640]  my listeners and uh just because he was somebody who was there from the beginning i would actually
[2:43:03.640 --> 2:43:12.760]  get the job done and work 18 hours a day now he is prominent in rand paul's office and now
[2:43:13.720 --> 2:43:20.680]  is going to be involved in other things i mean he was never a a political uh scientist he didn't
[2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:25.880]  go to school from that he was a veteran just a listener of the show and now the his whole
[2:43:25.880 --> 2:43:30.920]  destiny has been changed by going and volunteering he didn't think he'd ever but but see a lot of
[2:43:30.920 --> 2:43:37.800]  times so much of this world is about showing up you want to get in shape show up at the gym
[2:43:37.800 --> 2:43:42.440]  every day see what happens you want to learn a foreign language show up every day and study it
[2:43:42.440 --> 2:43:50.760]  for an hour you'll learn it you want to learn how to defend yourself go take jiu jitsu or taekwondo
[2:43:50.760 --> 2:44:01.320]  or judo you're gonna get good i mean it i mean look i i'm gonna go to your calls i was always a
[2:44:01.320 --> 2:44:06.680]  total you know exercise fiend never really ate that well but i ran six miles every other day
[2:44:06.680 --> 2:44:12.600]  lift weights seven days a week was addicted to it and then i got into radio and tv and got so busy
[2:44:12.600 --> 2:44:17.240]  i just gave it up for about six seven eight years gained 40 50 pounds got totally out of shape and
[2:44:17.240 --> 2:44:21.240]  then the last five years i've been trying to jog trying to lift trying to get back in shape
[2:44:21.240 --> 2:44:26.200]  didn't do it so i said about a month and a half ago i said i'm going whole log i'm gonna jog twice
[2:44:26.200 --> 2:44:31.640]  a day almost every day i'm gonna lift weights at least two or three times a week and i'm not gonna
[2:44:31.640 --> 2:44:41.160]  stop and i've lost now 25 pounds in a month and a half 25 you know what i'm not talking i'm doing it
[2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:53.080]  i'm gonna lose another 35 i'm gonna lose another 35 and again i hit a bump in the road i've never
[2:44:53.080 --> 2:44:56.760]  had a weightlifting accident in all my years of lifting weights playing football everything
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:02.040]  but i was lifting saturday afternoon i've been for a jog i went into lift and i'm and so i don't
[2:45:02.040 --> 2:45:08.840]  injure myself i'm doing light weights 20 reps 30 reps i had 120 pounds you know with the bar
[2:45:08.840 --> 2:45:16.200]  included on an incline and i was watching some of these high schoolers that were in there and they
[2:45:16.200 --> 2:45:21.480]  were doing explosive lifting with pulleys and i thought yeah i ought to try some of that because
[2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:26.040]  that's good to you know you know build the uh the fast twitch muscles i've been pretty much
[2:45:26.040 --> 2:45:31.400]  building slow twitch so that'll burn some weight so i said i'm gonna go put lighter weight on here
[2:45:31.400 --> 2:45:38.600]  and i'm gonna do 30 reps or so and i'm gonna try to explode well i get the weight and of course it's
[2:45:38.600 --> 2:45:43.320]  so light i'm not really having to explode but but about 25 into it i'm having to explode to get it
[2:45:43.320 --> 2:45:49.400]  off my chest well i exploded too much yep and my hands were tired it was the last exercise i was
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:57.800]  doing of about 15 or so it was like my fifth set of it it flies out of my hands another foot in the
[2:45:57.800 --> 2:46:03.960]  air and and i couldn't stop it falls right on my chest i got a huge bruise across me cracked my sternum
[2:46:03.960 --> 2:46:09.800]  it hurts to breathe but you know what i got so out of shape i deserve the pain i've been running
[2:46:09.800 --> 2:46:15.320]  every day despite the fact that it hurts and i'm just doing it it's just like the night saying
[2:46:15.320 --> 2:46:19.080]  you know i don't particularly like night because they're slave camps but the point is just do it
[2:46:19.080 --> 2:46:24.120]  and it's the same thing in politics and everything else there's no half measures here i'm not gonna
[2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:29.080]  jog a couple times a week and go live weights once a week in kind of a you know half measured way
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:35.080]  i've got to get in shape i've got to get obsessed with this you got to decide folks what you want
[2:46:35.080 --> 2:46:40.600]  liberty or tyranny it's the same thing in life i have dedicated myself to fighting tyranny to the
[2:46:40.600 --> 2:46:47.800]  point i was so dedicated i quit working out you know ten or more years ago and so now i've got
[2:46:47.800 --> 2:46:53.720]  to bring balance into that and i'm trying to do that but it anything in life takes a commitment
[2:46:53.720 --> 2:47:02.040]  it takes a commitment i'm gonna stop preaching man i'm a long-winded creature leon good and
[2:47:02.040 --> 2:47:06.920]  andrew and others leon you're on the air go ahead good afternoon alex are you i'm doing pretty good
[2:47:06.920 --> 2:47:10.520]  i'm sorry to hear you about your uh your accident there that's not hey it's fine i think it's gonna
[2:47:10.520 --> 2:47:15.880]  make me stronger you know what honestly i i don't know if you remember we've actually met and i
[2:47:15.880 --> 2:47:22.600]  you know doing radio here in las vegas we've done simulcast it passed oh is it leon catlett
[2:47:22.600 --> 2:47:26.360]  as a matter of fact it is hey how you doing buddy i've gotten your messages i've been wanting to
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:29.800]  come on i just haven't had time to really do any radio but i'd love to come on your show and love
[2:47:29.800 --> 2:47:34.760]  to get you on sometime hey i'd love to anytime you know in fact you know if you ever need anybody
[2:47:34.760 --> 2:47:39.480]  sitting in i'd love to volunteer my services for your effort any day of the week and you know
[2:47:39.480 --> 2:47:44.440]  just knowing the intense person that you are i could just picture you doing the whole explosion
[2:47:44.440 --> 2:47:48.440]  thing lifting the weights and having that thing flying out of your hand and landing on your chest
[2:47:48.440 --> 2:47:52.200]  well it wasn't like something powerful explosion i'm pretty weak now but yeah no i was just
[2:47:52.200 --> 2:47:57.080]  exploding you know to get it off my chest and then just did it too much and it flew yeah exactly
[2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:02.040]  i understand that yeah because i i mean i've lifted a little bit not much in the past but
[2:48:02.040 --> 2:48:06.760]  yeah it likes that knowing how intense you are i could just see that happening anyway you know i
[2:48:06.760 --> 2:48:11.160]  called in because and obviously it's evolved a lot over the show because you've covered so many
[2:48:11.160 --> 2:48:17.000]  different things but this whole boat thing going on in uh in iowa is so important that people get
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:21.560]  involved in and we stopped this vote for adam brought i'm so glad you mentioned uh bev harris
[2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:26.120]  that you're having her on uh black well this lady bragging about how he she's talked to the top
[2:48:26.120 --> 2:48:30.920]  republican party people and they're going to make sure he doesn't win you know we've got ways behind
[2:48:30.920 --> 2:48:37.000]  the scenes ha ha ha she you know if ron paul gets chicane then she needs to be hauled up before a
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:40.840]  grand jury and needs to be asked who told you they were going to fix things
[2:48:45.240 --> 2:48:51.240]  you there leon the glp is is like a corkscrew they're so darn crooked we have seen it time and time
[2:48:51.240 --> 2:48:55.880]  again when erin russo ran for government the core establishment lied cheated and
[2:48:55.880 --> 2:49:00.440]  sealed to to prevent him from being a major candidate and then it came around with the
[2:49:00.440 --> 2:49:07.400]  ron paul with election the uh the first round oh eight and the state the the core glp shut down
[2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:13.240]  the state convention to prevent a ron paul win and now this time of course they and they keep
[2:49:13.240 --> 2:49:18.120]  progressing with all these rules that they put into place to prevent people from uh you know
[2:49:18.120 --> 2:49:22.520]  from getting involved and being part of the process and you can just see this whole thing
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:28.360]  going on in uh in iowa the progression of it ron paul was kicking haini in all the polls they
[2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:33.160]  they had to admit that he was going to win the i was gaining a few points every day two weeks ago
[2:49:33.160 --> 2:49:38.920]  so they went into complete ape mode exactly and then the iowa the governor come out and made his
[2:49:38.920 --> 2:49:43.160]  statement and then this whole stupid anonymous thing is so obvious you know with the uh the
[2:49:43.160 --> 2:49:48.600]  occupy wall street the video i seen that the guys kept holding it in the fed sign
[2:49:49.240 --> 2:49:54.040]  that ron paul is the leader of in the fed no no they did that as a sigh of the confused things
[2:49:54.040 --> 2:49:59.560]  look this is right out of george soros exactly and so i you know like to say the whole what is it
[2:49:59.560 --> 2:50:05.880]  the uh the transparent voting dot org yeah we crash that side but regardless everybody take
[2:50:05.880 --> 2:50:11.960]  photos at your place saying we'll get them collated one way or the other and and and and again demand
[2:50:11.960 --> 2:50:17.000]  to you know that it be openly announced the vote and who won they've always done it before but now
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:23.160]  for security reasons they've got to hide it and and the uh and by the way i've seen the report
[2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:29.560]  the guy with the in the fed sign protesting ron paul he's reportedly the first one to upload the
[2:50:29.560 --> 2:50:37.720]  anonymous video launching all of this i mean how obvious does it have to get hey i hear the music
[2:50:37.720 --> 2:50:42.120]  coming up how it's i want to thank you so much for your efforts you're doing a great job out there

[3:00:15.880 --> 3:00:23.400]  us yet we're going back to your calls so andrew in virginia uh tell us what happened okay so uh
[3:00:23.400 --> 3:00:29.320]  uh this this all started last wednesday when um well first of all my girlfriend is a type one
[3:00:29.320 --> 3:00:36.200]  diabetic that has uh suffered from that since age 15 and also has some additional complications
[3:00:36.200 --> 3:00:42.680]  that so what did they do at the hospital okay so she came in with a wound that um was inflicted
[3:00:42.680 --> 3:00:48.120]  during what what is known as diabetic ketoacetosis where which is essentially unregulated blood
[3:00:48.120 --> 3:00:57.480]  sugar and all once the you know uh levels get so high talk right on your telephone right uh can
[3:00:57.480 --> 3:01:04.120]  hear yes so what did they say okay so we get there and immediately um they take us into the
[3:01:04.120 --> 3:01:09.560]  emergency room and put us in a family room right um at that point instead of focusing on the medical
[3:01:09.560 --> 3:01:13.480]  emergency they were trying to imply that you'd be there because they get some bonus cash if they
[3:01:13.480 --> 3:01:18.440]  send you to the huskow exactly so and now if you ever try to have a baby with her there's no
[3:01:18.440 --> 3:01:23.400]  judgment no arrest or no record they'll say they're gonna try to take your kids saying well you were
[3:01:23.400 --> 3:01:29.000]  there once i know people publicly get their noses broken at softball games and they take people's
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:33.160]  whole families and you've got a hundred witnesses and they're like doesn't matter your kids are gone
[3:01:33.160 --> 3:01:37.720]  we're big fat pedophiles hail the new world order if you don't like it you're evil okay so what
[3:01:37.720 --> 3:01:43.400]  happened that so the control freaks waddle in what happened next right so um it's you know they first
[3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:48.440]  sent an amt and who verify that the wound needed stitches and was serious and the only thing covering
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:52.760]  at this point was gauze we had brought in for no everything is a police state now everywhere you've
[3:01:52.760 --> 3:01:56.600]  got to be treated like a prisoner this is all prisoner training so so the longer short of it
[3:01:56.600 --> 3:02:02.440]  what happened okay so then um they send in the mental health professional yeah which is going to run
[3:02:02.440 --> 3:02:08.440]  a scyop they don't read to your rights anything listen every every time we've had a baby they ask
[3:02:08.440 --> 3:02:13.400]  me oh you go put this paper downstairs for us and then as soon as i leave is he beating you
[3:02:13.400 --> 3:02:17.080]  do you have enough money at home and they're just putting it all in the database sorry go ahead so
[3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:24.360]  how did this end okay exactly so um it ended with essentially them bullying her for the next 48 hours
[3:02:24.360 --> 3:02:29.960]  and uh she had to be admitted for the dka the diabetic ketosis and had to stay in the but they
[3:02:29.960 --> 3:02:35.720]  wanted a juicy plump they wanted to open a perp file on you so they bullied her to do what well
[3:02:35.720 --> 3:02:39.880]  they bullied her they're going here into being committed actually because they're trying to say
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:45.240]  that she was suicidal and a danger oh yeah we'll see a lot of hospitals can get double or triple
[3:02:45.240 --> 3:02:49.720]  funding like when they grab a little baby at two and put it on prozac by saying it's mentally ill
[3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:54.520]  when it cries for its mommy that they've just jacked then federal funding for a uh you know
[3:02:54.520 --> 3:03:00.520]  a quote ill child comes in special needs and so they always jack them on more drugs so they so
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:05.480]  the hospital basically kidnapped her yeah basically they uh just wanted to continually
[3:03:05.480 --> 3:03:10.360]  bully her into signing a uh form saying that she would voluntarily go but okay so how did this how
[3:03:10.360 --> 3:03:15.720]  did this black up end okay well ended with them bullying her for over 48 hours threatening to
[3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:21.320]  drag her out of a hospital bed with the police uh and take her down to the psychiatric yeah just
[3:03:21.320 --> 3:03:27.320]  total control freak nazi zombies everywhere so how did it end it ended with the county actually
[3:03:27.320 --> 3:03:32.040]  coming in because we were refusing everything the hospital was saying so we wanted to leave etc
[3:03:32.040 --> 3:03:38.760]  they bring the county in and they do another bias um yeah the schools the hospitals the car places
[3:03:38.760 --> 3:03:43.560]  they're all little prison induction centers and always a little petty nobody's get off on it
[3:03:43.560 --> 3:03:48.120]  okay so we're almost out of time how did this end okay it ended with her being indefinitely
[3:03:48.120 --> 3:03:53.880]  detained um they they ended up pulling her into signing in definitely detained oh was
[3:03:53.880 --> 3:04:00.520]  oh because she's al-qaeda apparently so so uh they ended up you know bullying her into that
[3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:06.120]  they take her to the facility we just got her out on monday um after fighting you know
[3:04:06.120 --> 3:04:11.400]  tooth and nail threatening lawsuits etc they even admitted that they were in the wrong oh no no no
[3:04:11.400 --> 3:04:14.760]  no no that's a black up you got to get out of town they're going to try to set you up again
[3:04:14.760 --> 3:04:20.920]  this pure evil listen it came out in the in the 90s but when i was in the 80s i had friends who
[3:04:20.920 --> 3:04:25.960]  i played football with and stuff who didn't even smoke marijuana and their parents would grab them
[3:04:25.960 --> 3:04:30.600]  and send them to these centers where they basically tortured them and then they would do all this
[3:04:30.600 --> 3:04:35.160]  stuff to them till their insurance ran out and then release them and and and and again that's
[3:04:35.160 --> 3:04:42.040]  what it is is that uh i guarantee it was probably a charity hospital even though you were probably
[3:04:42.040 --> 3:04:47.080]  paying and see they get all this government funding by doing that and so you just ran into
[3:04:47.080 --> 3:04:54.440]  a nest of vipers uh but look send me your name send me your info write up do a youtube of what
[3:04:54.440 --> 3:04:59.640]  happened get your wife on there with them name names go after them because believe me they're
[3:04:59.640 --> 3:05:12.680]  feeding on kids in there right now
