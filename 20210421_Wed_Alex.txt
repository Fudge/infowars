[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Music
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  Info Wars, Tomorrow's News, Today
[00:18.000 --> 00:41.000]  Music
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  You should come back to our place, baby, don't be afraid of our love
[00:48.000 --> 00:56.000]  On the second floor, darling, in a second flight, hurry up
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.000]  Because down in our caves, if the stores are all closed
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.000]  When the kids bring their hoodies, they dance super slow
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  But we have our lovers
[01:06.000 --> 01:12.000]  And all made of love, you should stay real close to Jesus
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.000]  Keep our blood, I'll let you have mine
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  We have to reach out to God
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  We have to open our hearts and our spirit to goodness
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  We have to transcend all the evil vomit
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  All the evil poison being spewed out by Satan's slaves
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  Thank you for joining us on this live, Wednesday, April 21st, Global Transmission
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones, very honored and blessed to be here
[01:37.000 --> 01:48.000]  We have incredible anti-white vitriol and racism being spewed by brainwashed idiots of every race, color, and creed
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.000]  We're going to play you the shocking video that if it came out of the mouths of the KKK, they would be arrested
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.000]  And they should
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  But when blacks and others call for physical attacks on whites
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  Because of what color they are
[02:04.000 --> 02:11.000]  The controlled corporate media, the enemy of the people, defends it
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  But what's really going on here, we know it's divide and conquer
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  We know it's meant to turn us against each other while they carry out the destruction of the nation
[02:22.000 --> 02:29.000]  Its currency, its morals, its borders, its military, its system, its very essence
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  And that, my friends, is what's happening
[02:33.000 --> 02:42.000]  The United States already has been under 50 years of transfer of our industry and our science to the world
[02:42.000 --> 02:49.000]  But not to build up humanity to enslave it so the global can parlay that ingenuity, that science, that money to them
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  And now we're meant to be finished
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  China builds a coal power plant every three days
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.000]  Under Obama, roughly every week, one was shut down
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  They're like iron skeletons across the country
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  Totally clean power, if you have the scrubbers like we do
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  It's a simple equation
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.000]  No amount of solar, no amount of wind, no amount of geothermal, no amount of hydroelectric
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.000]  Can give us the power we need to compete with communist China
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  But they're actually tearing down dams across America
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  And the Democrats of the United States build to destroy half our dams in the next 10 years that are left
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  Particularly the hydroelectric
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  This is a military attack
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.000]  And this is a tax on all of us and this is the country being shut down
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  The lights being turned off
[03:51.000 --> 03:57.000]  The Chinese communist minion who agrees with Biden that China should take over Hong Kong and Taiwan
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  And the death camps are good
[04:00.000 --> 04:09.000]  Blinken, whose father was the chief lawyer for Robert Maxwell, the pedophile commander
[04:09.000 --> 04:16.000]  The Epstein controller has now announced to the American people that this will hurt you
[04:16.000 --> 04:23.000]  We're going to hurt you, but that's okay because we're going to teach you how bad and racist you are while we screw you all
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000]  Here it is
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.000]  For all the opportunities offered by the unavoidable shift of clean energy
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  Not every American worker will win out in the near term
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  Some livelihoods and communities that relied on old industries will be hit hard
[04:37.000 --> 04:45.000]  Old technologies
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  Yeah, like humans, we're the old technology too
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  We're obsolete as well except for all these little rat-like creatures that serve Satan
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  It's Satan that's obsolete
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  It's your new old order that's totally obsolete
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.000]  You cannot hide a grand assault
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.000]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  It's dollar brought down to nothing
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.000]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  Stop living in fear
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  The enemy is about to expose itself
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  The enemy can't help itself
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  The enemy comes to kill, steal and destroy
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.000]  We sit here as good people get upset about that
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  And try to stop it, we should
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  But once it comes through, once it hits us
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  Once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  We just have to point out we tried to stop it
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  So prepare yourselves, America
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  You're going under judgements just like all the children that were aborted
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  This is the truth
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000]  This is the info war
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  We are still so strange and wild
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  I'm in the wind, I'm in the water
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  Nobody's fun, nobody's dark
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  I'm washing the camp treads over the country club
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  Suburbia, the brandwood market
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  What to do next?
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  The people I've been fighting can't share over the country club
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.000]  Tintrills over the country club
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.000]  I'll hard new albums, even better than the last
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.000]  Amazing, whole album
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  Great Christian album
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  It should obviously be the most avant-garde thing you could ever be
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.000]  It's a real Christian, not a fake one
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.400]  avant-garde the cutting edge the future get behind me Satan
[07:26.840 --> 07:33.240]  Everybody that's bet on the devil is going to get a front-row seat to Armageddon
[07:39.040 --> 07:41.040]  Apocalypse
[07:41.280 --> 07:44.440]  Which really means in the Latin the revealing
[07:45.520 --> 07:47.960]  All the fools thought because the Aztecs
[07:47.960 --> 07:53.280]  Envisioned an end of the world in 2012 is the end of the world. I said it wouldn't be
[07:54.200 --> 07:59.280]  But I said the occultists see it as the beginning of the new world they're building
[08:00.480 --> 08:07.440]  Which is a counterfeit of the real world Christ began to build 2,000 years ago on the cross
[08:10.760 --> 08:14.520]  Everything that Satan does is a twisted counterfeit of what God is
[08:14.520 --> 08:16.520]  is
[08:17.360 --> 08:23.600]  Satan is real and God is real and you are real and this is not a simulation
[08:26.240 --> 08:28.920]  This is the great test of consciousness
[08:28.920 --> 08:41.840]  Consciousness or the seed of the universe the seed of infinity is not just given away freely
[08:44.320 --> 08:49.640]  You must be tested I must be tested
[08:51.400 --> 08:56.120]  And so when you see the Nancy Pelosi's the Maxine waters and the Prince Phillips and
[08:56.120 --> 09:00.640]  The David Rockfellers and the Bill Gates's of the world
[09:01.960 --> 09:05.240]  These are people that failed the test
[09:07.880 --> 09:12.520]  These are people held in mindless clown-like bondage
[09:14.280 --> 09:23.000]  Pretending from their marble fortresses that they are the enlightened and that they are the elect and that they are
[09:23.000 --> 09:30.720]  The Sanhedrin when what they really are is fallen devils that deny God's
[09:31.560 --> 09:33.560]  supremacy
[09:35.800 --> 09:37.800]  Now while we all sit here
[09:38.560 --> 09:41.920]  Then watch the pathetic race war cauldron
[09:43.080 --> 09:48.520]  being stirred up in the brainwashed welfare controlled inner cities of this country and
[09:48.520 --> 09:55.160]  As that poison is injected into our cultural economic and spiritual veins
[09:57.400 --> 09:59.400]  Remember
[10:01.160 --> 10:07.360]  That all of us whether your old young black or white are being hammered by 5G are
[10:08.560 --> 10:15.440]  Being annihilated by gene therapy weapons are being hit by GMO are being sprayed by
[10:15.440 --> 10:18.640]  Aluminum dioxide barium salt weather modification poison
[10:19.280 --> 10:22.200]  now turning the soils infertile across the globe and
[10:23.480 --> 10:28.840]  Then we are in the process of not humans extermination, but the slow
[10:29.880 --> 10:36.720]  Destruction of all carbon-based life forms on this planet is the goal of Satan
[10:37.880 --> 10:39.760]  Because God
[10:39.760 --> 10:43.920]  Created this carbon-based system. We are made in the image of God and
[10:46.800 --> 10:49.760]  Satan hates our supremacy
[10:52.560 --> 10:59.880]  Humans are incredible when we're unchained we are beautiful we can experience the universe and communion with the Creator
[11:02.160 --> 11:04.160]  We're like
[11:04.160 --> 11:06.160]  rods and cones
[11:06.200 --> 11:08.200]  in the eye of God
[11:08.200 --> 11:10.200]  we are
[11:10.480 --> 11:12.480]  God's vessels
[11:12.720 --> 11:17.320]  God's tentacles God's probes God's system
[11:18.160 --> 11:20.160]  experiencing consciousness and
[11:21.160 --> 11:24.320]  Nothing Satan can do will ever change that
[11:26.960 --> 11:28.960]  So don't let the enemy get you down I
[11:29.920 --> 11:31.920]  Know it gets me down. It's sad and
[11:31.920 --> 11:39.360]  And don't let their religion of race war and their religion of worshiping black people on the surface
[11:39.440 --> 11:41.440]  When they're doing the opposite or killing them
[11:45.840 --> 11:47.840]  Ever get you down
[11:48.160 --> 11:52.080]  Because God is in control, but what do we see Nancy Pelosi say we'll play at the moment
[11:52.880 --> 11:58.280]  She said yesterday breathing through her face diaper huffing and puffing at 82 years old
[11:58.280 --> 12:03.160]  With her tenuous grasp to life
[12:05.680 --> 12:10.280]  As her spirit begins its descent to her master
[12:12.480 --> 12:15.360]  And she thanked George Floyd for his
[12:16.240 --> 12:22.280]  Sacrifice like he was a veteran like like he was Jesus on the cross but like like he was a Messiah a
[12:22.280 --> 12:24.280]  drugged out
[12:27.560 --> 12:29.560]  Male prostitute
[12:31.800 --> 12:35.680]  Devastatedly unhappy possessed by the spirit of the world
[12:36.560 --> 12:41.640]  Until the moment he died and she huffing and puffing through her face platter
[12:43.440 --> 12:45.440]  Thanked him for his
[12:45.440 --> 12:53.360]  Sacrifice because the new religion is political correctness the new religion is hating each other in the name of loving each other
[12:53.360 --> 12:58.920]  The new religion is don't go off what somebody does what they stand for and their character and their content of their deeds
[12:58.920 --> 13:00.920]  But what color they are?
[13:02.200 --> 13:08.280]  Biden is now announcing the Justice Department to take over all the police departments under the strong cities initiative
[13:08.280 --> 13:16.440]  But it's under UNESCO control the same treaty organization now turning what's left of our power plants off as we literally and
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  figuratively enter the darkness
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.600]  and
[13:21.600 --> 13:23.600]  there is
[13:25.440 --> 13:29.280]  Pelosi announcing the globalist UN controlled
[13:29.280 --> 13:38.040]  Federal and the feds are run by the UN now meaning UN takeover of our police just like they control our medicine and our speech and
[13:38.640 --> 13:40.640]  Policies of our military
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.440]  We are now a conquered nation and until we realize we're a conquered nation
[13:45.440 --> 13:51.040]  We have no hope but if we unify against their evil we could easily take back our government
[13:51.040 --> 13:53.540]  But until the legislatures and the Congress
[13:53.540 --> 14:02.420]  Realizes the takeover states the takeover and exposes the takeover and fights back against the takeover. We have no future
[14:04.260 --> 14:07.540]  They celebrated last year before they even put the puppet Biden in
[14:08.500 --> 14:11.780]  At the UN as cities went under strong city
[14:11.780 --> 14:18.580]  And they had tears in their eyes at the UN and the mayors were there the mayor of New York was there the communists the Marxist
[14:18.580 --> 14:22.860]  Joyfully saying we're going underneath world government
[14:26.380 --> 14:30.980]  We're at a length said it six years ago that our police will be UN run
[14:31.180 --> 14:37.780]  Not even federally run and that's against the Constitution. We are a conquered occupied nation
[14:38.060 --> 14:44.040]  We've been taught to hate ourselves and believe our nation shouldn't even exist. And so as the old republic goes out
[14:44.040 --> 14:50.160]  The horrible twisted evil comes in and they tell us as the Secretary of State today
[14:50.160 --> 14:58.000]  You will be hurt by your energy being cut. You will pay more. You will not have jobs. You are not essential. That is the way it is
[14:59.600 --> 15:04.280]  No future kill yourself. China is the future. No
[15:04.760 --> 15:09.240]  They want to make us depressed so we don't believe in God and so we bow to them
[15:09.240 --> 15:15.120]  No, we believe in God more than ever and wonder attack because we were a Christian nation and we had the seeds of destiny here
[15:15.120 --> 15:17.120]  And they are scared of that
[15:18.120 --> 15:23.120]  So don't let them ever make you feel bad because you don't have money or because you're black or you're white or any of that
[15:23.120 --> 15:29.360]  Or you're a man or a woman. That's evil and they're evil and they're frauds. Here's Pelosi launching her new religion
[15:30.040 --> 15:32.040]  Thank You George Floyd
[15:32.200 --> 15:34.700]  For sacrificing your life for justice
[15:34.700 --> 15:41.820]  For being there to call out to your mom. How how heartbreaking was that called out for your mom?
[15:41.820 --> 15:46.380]  I can't breathe but because of you and because of
[15:47.340 --> 15:52.340]  Thousands millions of people around the world who came out for justice
[15:52.660 --> 15:58.620]  Your name will always be synonymous. That's the new world order hiding behind a black drug addict
[15:58.620 --> 16:05.380]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting patients
[16:06.060 --> 16:08.060]  hundreds of hospitals in the u.s
[16:08.500 --> 16:16.500]  Injected healthy men women and children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non therapeutic to lethal
[16:16.700 --> 16:18.700]  Killing many of the test subjects
[16:19.340 --> 16:24.380]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made 14 years ago
[16:24.380 --> 16:30.300]  We tracked and documented the build a bird group's activities and they're playing for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus
[16:30.300 --> 16:34.900]  The film now is more important than ever when it's shot to number one on Amazon last year. They banned it
[16:34.900 --> 16:41.300]  We have it back in print available now at info or store.com selling them as low as 395 a piece
[16:41.300 --> 16:45.340]  We abound in bulk and there's a zero country code so anywhere on the planet you can make copies
[16:45.340 --> 16:48.020]  In fact, I want you to make copies. You are the Paul Revere's
[16:48.620 --> 16:50.460]  1776 worldwide
[16:50.460 --> 16:54.860]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement available now at it for store.com
[16:58.540 --> 17:01.820]  So many people say to me Alex, please stop being so negative
[17:02.700 --> 17:08.940]  Well for me admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative. It hurts
[17:09.180 --> 17:15.260]  It stinks. It's got pus coming out of it. I go to the doctor. They fix it. That's not negative. I'm not living in denial
[17:15.260 --> 17:22.140]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we feel yet, but now it's come to the surface
[17:22.140 --> 17:27.740]  That's actually a positive thing. And so yeah, Trump did an overall a great job. They stole the election
[17:27.740 --> 17:32.780]  We can't get down about that. We have forced them out in the open
[17:33.340 --> 17:37.500]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed. They're scared
[17:37.580 --> 17:42.300]  That's why instead of saying oh, we're a bunch of losers. Look what happened. No, we're a bunch of winners
[17:42.300 --> 17:48.620]  They're trying to suppress us let our light of proof shine and tell everybody what's happening your own website
[17:48.620 --> 17:55.580]  Your own show my show other articles other videos. Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're an information war
[17:55.740 --> 17:58.700]  We're going to win this together and the fight starts in fours dot com
[17:58.700 --> 18:09.660]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[18:28.700 --> 18:37.660]  And
[18:42.300 --> 18:44.540]  For sacrificing your life for justice
[18:45.580 --> 18:49.980]  For being there to call out to your mom how how heartbreaking was that
[18:50.540 --> 18:54.460]  Call out for your mom. I can't breathe but because of you
[18:55.340 --> 18:57.180]  and because of
[18:57.180 --> 19:02.140]  Thousands millions of people around the world who came out for justice
[19:02.780 --> 19:06.620]  Your name will always be synonymous with justice
[19:07.500 --> 19:11.100]  That's right. What they're saying is we've stolen george floyd's identity
[19:11.660 --> 19:16.140]  We the democratic party that runs giant slave camps in china and makes money off of them. They literally help run them
[19:17.260 --> 19:19.740]  We the globalist anti-human new world order system
[19:20.300 --> 19:25.820]  We thank you george floyd because you are justice and now you belong to us and we speak for you
[19:25.820 --> 19:32.060]  When briana taylor's mother came out and said i've never had black lives matter. Help me. They're a horrible evil organization
[19:32.460 --> 19:34.460]  They removed her post from facebook
[19:36.060 --> 19:40.860]  When larry pinkney that was a founding member of the black panther party the real deal
[19:42.220 --> 19:44.220]  Came out and criticized all this garbage
[19:45.420 --> 19:49.580]  They just banned him on twitter. He joins us in the third hour today
[19:51.900 --> 19:53.900]  Because you cannot get
[19:53.900 --> 19:59.020]  In the middle of the narrative that black lives matter speaks for black people
[19:59.500 --> 20:01.660]  Do black folks know they've had their identity stolen?
[20:02.700 --> 20:07.580]  Everybody from charles barkley to brown of taylor's mom have said that and that's why they get silenced
[20:08.620 --> 20:10.620]  That's why their voices are even more important
[20:11.340 --> 20:17.340]  That ever but but but here she is again saying thank you george floyd for your sacrifice
[20:18.060 --> 20:20.060]  Like he knowingly went
[20:20.140 --> 20:22.460]  And got killed by a cop who's convicted of killing
[20:22.460 --> 20:26.380]  Even though the reasonable doubts incredible, but i'll be honest with you
[20:26.460 --> 20:29.420]  I don't give at the end of the day a rat's ass about that one cop
[20:34.860 --> 20:42.300]  I do care about this country and our entire future and how now they've set him up as the devil and george floyd up as jesus
[20:46.220 --> 20:48.220]  So to rephrase that
[20:48.220 --> 20:52.940]  I care about that cop a one on the rickshaw scale. I care about the whole country in the world at a 10
[20:53.980 --> 20:58.860]  And so it isn't about oh, that's a white guy and i'm rooting for the white guy. He's my football team
[20:58.860 --> 21:03.180]  He's my basketball team. You know i'm i'm i'm i'm going for tom brady
[21:04.700 --> 21:08.700]  Remember the media said rooting for tom brady was white supremacism. They make everything about race
[21:09.260 --> 21:14.220]  No, the cop obviously didn't want to kill him. Obviously it was bare minimum
[21:14.220 --> 21:18.220]  Man's water
[21:19.260 --> 21:25.980]  But they convicted him on all the counts because they had to virtue signal showing that the media can now
[21:26.780 --> 21:29.180]  Intimidate anybody they want any police department
[21:29.180 --> 21:32.140]  They want to follow their policies and their directives
[21:32.700 --> 21:38.700]  Or the media will come and demand you're all put in jail and the justice department will come and indict you
[21:40.220 --> 21:42.220]  But but when you're a good
[21:42.780 --> 21:44.140]  globalist
[21:44.140 --> 21:53.660]  When you follow all these different globalist operations they want and go after the guns and go after the christians and say that even blue lives matter
[21:54.860 --> 21:59.980]  That's now a white supremacist term the adl says on the southern prairie law center and now the smartphones
[22:01.660 --> 22:05.660]  Are kicking in and taking over when you try to type blue lives matter
[22:06.540 --> 22:08.540]  And not letting you do it
[22:09.500 --> 22:11.500]  That's the ai mind control
[22:11.500 --> 22:19.420]  That's the ai watching and controlling you just like when you try to say f you to somebody on your text message
[22:19.420 --> 22:22.460]  You don't let you because in live time it's in control
[22:22.940 --> 22:26.060]  And now it can endlessly add to the lexicon
[22:26.620 --> 22:31.340]  Of things that says they're evil because it's the god. It's the high priest. It's the ai master
[22:31.500 --> 22:34.860]  It is the one true knowledge and you will follow it
[22:35.100 --> 22:40.300]  This is their excuse for the social credit score in the world is quote racism
[22:40.300 --> 22:45.100]  While they open your borders why they flood you with people they've already been abusing and controlling
[22:46.620 --> 22:48.620]  In the ultimate divide and conquer strategy
[22:49.980 --> 22:51.980]  So one more time here's polosi
[22:52.700 --> 22:57.500]  Launching the new religion the worship of george floyd and george floyd's dead
[22:58.140 --> 23:00.140]  George floyd was such a dragon that he could hardly talk
[23:00.940 --> 23:02.300]  George floyd was a thug
[23:02.300 --> 23:09.500]  But that's okay because the image of george floyd is now the mask that the deep state wears bill gates wears
[23:09.500 --> 23:11.500]  George floyd's mask
[23:11.660 --> 23:18.700]  That's why apple and google and facebook and microsoft gave billions of dollars to black lives matter affiliated groups
[23:18.860 --> 23:24.220]  Because this is their takeover while they rob us and turn off our power and divide us and poison us
[23:24.460 --> 23:27.180]  Oh, but they support the black people
[23:30.940 --> 23:36.780]  Because they know whites have guilt and will do what we're told if there's a black person as the face of it
[23:36.780 --> 23:44.620]  That's why almost every corporate ad you see now voiceover. You name it is black people. That's not because the system likes black people
[23:46.300 --> 23:54.060]  It's like in the 1980s movie the thing the remake john carpenter masterpiece. That's not a dog. That's not a person. That's imitation
[23:54.940 --> 23:57.660]  It's camouflage, you know, you panelist out of a tank
[23:59.500 --> 24:04.060]  Foliage if you're gonna be in the jungle jungle foliage, we're gonna be out the middle of fields you paint them tan
[24:04.060 --> 24:11.660]  You're in the desert. You paint them tan. It's camouflage. And so now the whole new world order ai takeover has got a black face on it
[24:12.940 --> 24:14.940]  Just like obama
[24:15.020 --> 24:16.620]  was quote black
[24:16.620 --> 24:18.620]  But he wasn't he was there to destroy everybody
[24:19.260 --> 24:23.260]  Looks like a dog not a dog looks like a man not a man looks like it's a black person
[24:23.500 --> 24:29.100]  It ain't a black person and it's totally synthetic and it's in the wiki leaks that that's what they're doing
[24:29.340 --> 24:31.420]  So when you go along with it, you're a chump
[24:31.420 --> 24:38.700]  And all these good people oh, they care about black lives all they are is soros's army
[24:39.180 --> 24:41.180]  soros's move on
[24:41.420 --> 24:42.780]  dot org
[24:42.780 --> 24:49.500]  System marching on america with marxism with the end of the country and demanding that you bow to them
[24:49.580 --> 24:52.300]  And you think it's pathetic that they go and harass people in restaurants
[24:53.500 --> 24:58.940]  You think it makes them look bad when they go into a restaurant and scream at white people and say get out of here
[24:58.940 --> 25:05.020]  Open racism. Hope people you know that makes them look bad. No, it's a task to see what they can get their people to do
[25:06.860 --> 25:08.860]  To go to white people's houses
[25:09.260 --> 25:16.380]  And knock their door down or fire bomb them or burn down a police station. You say that's terrible. No, that's good and the fbi likes it
[25:17.820 --> 25:24.220]  Because they are political officers now from the top right down to the bottom and they're taking over
[25:24.220 --> 25:28.860]  They're conquering and their army tank running over you and your family
[25:29.500 --> 25:32.220]  Has got george floyd's face painted on the front of it
[25:32.940 --> 25:36.380]  So if you fight back against that army tank, well, you're attacking a black man
[25:38.460 --> 25:41.660]  I was watching harrison's fit this morning on on the american journal
[25:43.100 --> 25:44.540]  And he had playing eclipse
[25:44.540 --> 25:49.820]  I had seen a drag queen story time at the public schools with men dressed like clowns
[25:49.820 --> 25:54.460]  Because a bunch of men came to a school to be with your kids and have to sit in their lap and go you're a pervert
[25:54.700 --> 25:58.140]  But it's a man dressed like a woman. It's just nice women that drop by
[25:58.380 --> 26:04.460]  We instinctively know that the big bad wolf's a man that the big bad wolf wants little red riding hood and little johnny
[26:05.100 --> 26:07.900]  But now they come in hordes and groups and the weird pedophile
[26:08.300 --> 26:14.860]  Teachers and everybody bring them in and it's a big fetish to watch jenny and johnny sit on the lap with a bulging
[26:14.860 --> 26:20.460]  Erection of a man in an it the clown outfit
[26:21.820 --> 26:24.940]  You wonder why they're making their move with the lockdowns and the force of
[26:25.580 --> 26:28.380]  And everything because they think we'll put up with anything
[26:29.100 --> 26:33.420]  They take our children to their topless bars that aren't topless bars anymore
[26:34.300 --> 26:40.140]  And local christian communities will shut down a topless bar where women take their tops off in front of men
[26:40.140 --> 26:47.260]  But they won't go protest the drag queen pedophile hour with little kids at midnight with men throwing money at them because
[26:47.500 --> 26:53.660]  They've been told that that's politically incorrect because christians aren't christians anymore. They're devil worshipers
[26:53.820 --> 26:57.660]  They're politically correct devil worshipers. The church is the house of satan
[26:57.900 --> 27:01.020]  i'm not gonna sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off
[27:02.140 --> 27:04.540]  The success is simple versus that
[27:05.260 --> 27:07.660]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together
[27:07.660 --> 27:09.660]  But i'll tell you this
[27:10.940 --> 27:14.060]  The technocrats are really up in their game
[27:14.620 --> 27:17.900]  And they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media
[27:18.620 --> 27:26.300]  They're trying to shudder into silence of human resistance. So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[27:26.540 --> 27:29.020]  Everything you warned your friends and family about us are out to be true
[27:29.660 --> 27:31.820]  So it's now that your credibility is way up
[27:32.460 --> 27:34.460]  The power structures are to silence
[27:34.700 --> 27:36.700]  those of us that they can
[27:36.700 --> 27:38.700]  But it's up to all of us
[27:38.780 --> 27:40.780]  To not let them silence any of us
[27:41.500 --> 27:43.180]  We have the power
[27:43.180 --> 27:46.620]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech
[27:47.500 --> 27:52.300]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't come
[27:53.020 --> 27:55.020]  So be the polar bears you are
[27:58.940 --> 28:03.660]  In the early 1990s, it was a really funny movie that came out called lange world
[28:03.660 --> 28:05.660]  lange world
[28:05.660 --> 28:07.660]  lange world
[28:07.820 --> 28:10.380]  Even before i had an access to you show in the mid 1990s
[28:10.940 --> 28:13.580]  I wouldn't call that movie and thought man that was fun
[28:14.460 --> 28:19.260]  Factors to speak out and have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd you're still entertaining because you're real
[28:19.500 --> 28:21.420]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's world?
[28:21.580 --> 28:25.100]  We're not worthy. We're not worthy.
[28:25.260 --> 28:31.100]  Every day when i cover these huge topics, i don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or so real
[28:31.100 --> 28:36.380]  But i'm trying to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right and most of the time we do the globalists love lying to you
[28:36.380 --> 28:38.700]  They love manipulating you. They enjoy
[28:39.340 --> 28:46.460]  Destroying humanity. They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them. That for me is really set down
[28:47.260 --> 28:48.380]  and disgusting
[28:48.380 --> 28:50.860]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole info wars crew
[28:52.220 --> 28:57.740]  That we will never join the globalists. We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together
[28:57.740 --> 29:01.500]  I am a very humble person, but i'm also a bold person
[29:01.900 --> 29:07.020]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity with all the terrible things that are unfolding
[29:07.020 --> 29:11.020]  I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well
[29:11.820 --> 29:15.820]  I'm a public figure. So I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see and let me tell you
[29:16.300 --> 29:23.340]  Whether it's police chiefs or members of congress or even folks in hollywood or or or mainstream media or industry
[29:23.340 --> 29:26.940]  People are really really away from the establishment
[29:27.580 --> 29:31.820]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared. They're looking for leadership
[29:32.300 --> 29:36.780]  Well, that's where info wars comes in you fund us you support info wars.com
[29:36.780 --> 29:38.700]  You get great products at the same time
[29:38.700 --> 29:42.300]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular
[29:42.460 --> 29:47.900]  What the globalists will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat
[29:48.380 --> 29:51.420]  That's our job. So please keep us on air
[29:51.420 --> 29:55.820]  So we can hit the bar wire so we can be the shock groups and the information war
[29:56.220 --> 29:58.220]  Fund us at info wars store.com
[30:00.300 --> 30:03.820]  One of the most popular memes on the internet in the last decade has been
[30:04.140 --> 30:12.380]  Alex Jones was right, but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like twitter and facebook making the globalists
[30:12.620 --> 30:17.580]  Pull their hair out in anger. So let me tell you we are tomorrow's news today. Thanks for your support
[30:17.580 --> 30:22.380]  We're still on air at info wars.com and band on video radio stations and tv stations across the country
[30:22.460 --> 30:27.340]  And our film in game censored and taken offline by amazon when it hit number one a few years ago
[30:27.580 --> 30:31.740]  Is now available again. We have reprinted it on high quality dvd in hd
[30:31.820 --> 30:35.580]  It has a zero country code meaning anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it
[30:35.580 --> 30:38.540]  And i'm asking you to get the original make copies give it to everyone
[30:38.540 --> 30:43.580]  You know aerial local access tv give it to your pastors your police chiefs your state reps your prime ministers
[30:43.580 --> 30:49.580]  Whatever you do warn the world this film uses their own documents and own statements 14 years ago to expose them
[30:49.740 --> 30:56.300]  It's more important than ever available at info wars store.com. That's info wars store.com in game blueprint for global enslavement
[30:56.300 --> 31:09.340]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[31:26.940 --> 31:30.540]  You know my ancestors
[31:33.100 --> 31:37.180]  Are alive right now through my veins in my arteries through my blood through my genetics
[31:39.260 --> 31:41.260]  And so are yours
[31:42.460 --> 31:45.100]  But their spirit transcends as well
[31:47.100 --> 31:49.100]  That's part of the mystery of the universe
[31:49.580 --> 31:51.820]  The multifaceted dimensions of our life
[31:53.100 --> 31:55.100]  We do not just live in one dimension
[31:55.100 --> 31:57.100]  We live throughout the multiverse
[31:58.540 --> 32:02.540]  I want to open the phones up until the bottom of the next hour and the constitutional lawyer joined the storm paddice
[32:02.860 --> 32:07.980]  To talk about the greatest miscarriage of justice the greatest fiasco and he's a big liberal by the way
[32:08.540 --> 32:13.420]  He's ever seen in his life and he's been practicing law 40 years
[32:16.780 --> 32:18.540]  I talked to a lot of other people and they said listen
[32:18.540 --> 32:22.620]  It wouldn't matter if the guy was guilty and you could maybe argue it either way
[32:22.620 --> 32:26.220]  I mean, I certainly didn't like what happened to George Floyd. It looked terrible. I was against it when it happened
[32:28.300 --> 32:30.300]  But with the reasonable doubt
[32:30.780 --> 32:32.780]  well, that's a side issue too
[32:33.180 --> 32:35.900]  with st. Floyd according to Pelosi or
[32:36.460 --> 32:38.140]  Christ Floyd
[32:38.140 --> 32:40.620]  Who they've stolen his identity and use him now for their power
[32:42.460 --> 32:44.460]  The issue
[32:44.940 --> 32:46.700]  Is that
[32:46.700 --> 32:49.740]  You had the president say he needs to be convicted you had
[32:49.740 --> 32:54.140]  Pelosi said you had maxine waters traveled there and called basically for violence
[32:55.500 --> 32:57.820]  You had all this media demonized him as a nazi
[32:59.100 --> 33:01.580]  You had the city of 27 million dollars to his family
[33:02.140 --> 33:05.580]  You had the city spend millions to educate people that the cop was a racist
[33:07.260 --> 33:13.500]  This was an exercise in mob rule and defamation and a high tech lynching
[33:13.500 --> 33:18.140]  I mean if it came out that cop did that on purpose because maybe they were drug dealers together or something which some people think
[33:18.300 --> 33:22.460]  They worked at the same bar as bouncers for years. You know what bouncers really do at a lot of those big bars
[33:22.940 --> 33:27.580]  Especially those big hip-hop techno dance bars are selling drugs. Anybody knows that
[33:28.620 --> 33:32.460]  Where do you get your drugs if you're into drugs? I don't even use drugs when I knew that back in college
[33:32.460 --> 33:37.900]  Is there the right bar? It's the bouncers selling the drugs as a cop selling the drugs. I'm not saying the cop show mom was doing that
[33:37.900 --> 33:41.420]  I'm just saying something didn't add up here. I'm not denying
[33:41.420 --> 33:45.900]  That and if the cops guilty burning throw them in an electric chair, but that's not what this is about
[33:48.060 --> 33:55.500]  It's about a corrupt political system run by the chai comms and the globalists that's anti-american anti-human anti-god anti-family
[33:55.500 --> 33:57.500]  anti-everything
[33:58.940 --> 34:05.100]  Trying to short circuit our political realignment and our great awakening to take our government back all across the world
[34:05.100 --> 34:09.100]  It was happening from Brazil to the UK to Germany to Russia to here
[34:09.100 --> 34:12.220]  to Canada instead. Everything's all about race war
[34:13.340 --> 34:19.980]  So that people like Trudeau can say I want a Chinese dictatorship. I want a dictatorship in Canada. That's a quote
[34:19.980 --> 34:24.060]  These are bad people. They don't even hide it
[34:25.260 --> 34:27.260]  All these different areas of Canada
[34:29.020 --> 34:31.020]  Have basically declared
[34:31.020 --> 34:33.020]  martial law
[34:33.020 --> 34:35.980]  And then you look at the people that have declared martial law in these areas
[34:35.980 --> 34:39.180]  These people are puppets. They're not in charge
[34:40.540 --> 34:42.540]  They announced yesterday
[34:44.060 --> 34:48.140]  That you're about to lose your job and you're about to have your power go up and we're not going to have any factories left
[34:48.140 --> 34:51.900]  Because they're about to cripple us further turning what's left of our damn power off
[34:53.180 --> 34:59.340]  In some religious tithes to the Rothschilds to not just give that owns the global
[34:59.340 --> 35:02.300]  Exchange on carbons the damn Rothschilds can't make that up
[35:02.300 --> 35:07.340]  And who's invested in it? Obama and Hillary and the global initiative and oh and and uh
[35:09.580 --> 35:11.580]  Everybody
[35:11.580 --> 35:13.580]  Al Gore
[35:13.580 --> 35:18.220]  You will pay them for everything you do that has carbon involved, which is everything thousands of things
[35:20.300 --> 35:22.300]  Millions of things
[35:22.300 --> 35:24.300]  everything basically
[35:24.300 --> 35:26.300]  And they're going to surveil your carbon and watch you
[35:26.300 --> 35:28.300]  And they're going to surveil your carbon and watch you
[35:28.300 --> 35:35.660]  While they do it, but that's not even half of it. The other half is that India and China and Mexico
[35:38.300 --> 35:43.660]  I was up at a helicopter on the Texas Mexico border a few weeks ago. We shot a video of it and
[35:44.860 --> 35:48.620]  There's no cold power plants. There's nothing going on the energy shut off here
[35:48.620 --> 35:54.940]  Mexico even supplies a lot of south texas now and I looked over into Mexico and I saw a big giant
[35:54.940 --> 36:01.820]  Coal plants and black smoke that wasn't like water vapor with our coal plants where it goes out because it's hot and the air is cold
[36:01.820 --> 36:05.340]  For a hundred yards and dissipates. That's not smoke. That's that's water vapor
[36:05.340 --> 36:07.980]  But I looked miles and miles into Mexico
[36:07.980 --> 36:11.740]  But you see a city on the horizon and all I saw was smoke stacks
[36:12.140 --> 36:16.620]  Belching black smoke that was going for dozens of miles because it was
[36:18.060 --> 36:20.060]  The opposite of clean burning coal
[36:21.500 --> 36:23.500]  It was the opposite of burning coal
[36:23.500 --> 36:25.500]  It was big
[36:26.700 --> 36:28.220]  giant
[36:28.220 --> 36:32.220]  Stacks not running scrubbers not cleaning out the the the coal
[36:33.660 --> 36:34.700]  fires
[36:34.700 --> 36:36.700]  It was spewing
[36:36.780 --> 36:40.700]  Yeah, what they're showing there is a natural gas refinery off-gassing. That's nothing
[36:41.740 --> 36:45.900]  Type in dirty coal plants china where the sky turns black at noon
[36:46.220 --> 36:49.820]  That's the photos and videos you want to see and I saw it in Mexico
[36:49.820 --> 36:55.100]  You understand we're one world so where it's clean they cut the coal off where it's dirty
[36:55.340 --> 36:58.300]  They crank it up. It has nothing to do with the earth
[36:58.540 --> 37:03.500]  It has to do with power and economic control and the globalists are invested in Mexico
[37:03.820 --> 37:09.340]  And they're invested in india and they're invested in china and it doesn't help the people they breathe the mercury
[37:09.500 --> 37:11.500]  They breathe the lead
[37:11.500 --> 37:20.220]  It's unbelievable ladies and gentlemen
[37:22.780 --> 37:28.220]  And I love how whenever they show china's coal power plants they usually show nuclear reactors. That's not what those are
[37:31.740 --> 37:33.740]  Just happen black skies
[37:34.780 --> 37:36.780]  in china
[37:36.780 --> 37:42.140]  The sky blacked out in china. I mean that's why they were wearing masks long before all this happens
[37:42.140 --> 37:45.340]  Why they're dying of respiratory problems and then claiming it's covered 19
[37:45.420 --> 37:50.300]  That's why they show these x-rays these lungs. They're just look like they're coal miners because they are
[37:52.380 --> 37:55.820]  And look I got all this news to cover so many things ahead. I want to give the number out take your calls
[37:55.820 --> 37:58.220]  but do you understand the fundamentals of
[37:59.340 --> 38:01.340]  the secretary of state says
[38:01.340 --> 38:06.940]  And admits that the new green deal will hurt americans and will take your jobs
[38:08.780 --> 38:14.940]  Oh my god, is that not the most Orwellian photo there from Beijing where they have giant jumbo tron tvs
[38:15.180 --> 38:17.180]  Showing beautiful blue skies
[38:17.340 --> 38:23.660]  Clean vistas and they're in the middle of a giant smoke-filled haze of hell
[38:23.660 --> 38:29.260]  They're coal plants are as dirty as our plants were a hundred years ago
[38:35.100 --> 38:39.580]  It's so dirty that sometimes it looks like it's 10 at night at high noon
[38:40.460 --> 38:44.700]  I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna give the number out. I'm gonna take your calls. I'm gonna play all the rioting and attacks
[38:44.700 --> 38:46.700]  because you know after George Floyd
[38:48.300 --> 38:50.300]  Was turned into a saint yesterday and after
[38:50.300 --> 38:52.300]  We witnessed uh
[38:52.300 --> 38:57.180]  These uh guilty verdicts out of the political orders after we watched the show trial
[38:57.900 --> 39:01.660]  I was in a total mistrial by any special imagination by every yardstick
[39:02.460 --> 39:04.460]  After we watched this miscarriage of justice
[39:05.420 --> 39:09.580]  I predicted on there. I said yesterday when I was doing the uh war room with pepper
[39:10.300 --> 39:15.100]  There's guest housing while oven gets a day off. He's been working like 14 days straight and
[39:15.100 --> 39:22.460]  I said watch a whole bunch of riots and attacks tonight because it's about people exercising their power. Oh, I'm the anointed
[39:22.700 --> 39:27.580]  I can surround white people in a car and beat them up. I can surround white people at a restaurant and throw them out
[39:27.580 --> 39:33.500]  I can go to their houses. I'm good because I'm black. They're bad because they're white and that's the new anti-racism
[39:33.500 --> 39:39.020]  Like oh, you're white. You can't be here this weekend at the college. Oh, you're white. We're not offering rock climbing
[39:39.020 --> 39:41.020]  We're not offering rock climbing
[39:41.020 --> 39:47.500]  At this college for whites anymore because we're going to teach you what discrimination is like because you or your ancestor did something wrong
[39:47.660 --> 39:50.700]  Even though compared to other countries, we've been the nicest best people
[39:50.700 --> 39:54.540]  Which is why everybody wants to get here because we were an open society
[39:56.140 --> 39:58.140]  And a bunch of weird white people
[39:59.100 --> 40:06.540]  Going into restaurants and screaming for black lives matter at white people and disrupting them and smashing things and then
[40:06.540 --> 40:13.100]  Fox News has a guest host on saying well, I mean, this is you know, isolated incidents. This has never happened before
[40:13.340 --> 40:15.820]  Oh, that's like saying Antifa doesn't exist
[40:17.820 --> 40:22.940]  The toll-free number to join this is 877-789-2539 877-789-2539
[40:24.140 --> 40:26.860]  On our power being cut off. I'd like to hear from you on that
[40:27.580 --> 40:33.100]  And on the ongoing race war they're trying to trigger and where they're going to lead this is only to get worse federalization
[40:33.100 --> 40:37.820]  of police tearing them into political officers just like Canada just like Europe hell on earth
[40:39.020 --> 40:47.420]  Unbelievable 877-789-2539 877-789 Alex first-time callers by the way first-time callers first-time callers 877
[40:49.020 --> 40:52.860]  789-2539 will come back and take your calls and play a lot of clips
[40:54.380 --> 40:59.980]  Every product you hear me on air advertising. We have it stock in our warehouse and we have it stock in our warehouse
[40:59.980 --> 41:05.340]  In Austin, Texas every product. So if you order it, we've got it ships out in a couple of days sometimes the same day
[41:05.900 --> 41:12.140]  Letters to get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain's breaking down and its future orders
[41:13.100 --> 41:15.980]  It's product. We're trying to reorder to get back in
[41:16.780 --> 41:21.260]  That we're having trouble with I'm now talking about double triple quadruple delivery times
[41:22.140 --> 41:25.740]  And it's across not just the supplement vitamin mineral industry
[41:25.740 --> 41:30.780]  It's across every industry. So the globalists have successfully devastated the economy
[41:32.060 --> 41:37.180]  That's why I'm saying you need to visit info or store.com today and get high quality supplements while you still can
[41:37.740 --> 41:42.220]  And storeable food at info or store.com because we have it in stock. It's ready to ship
[41:42.860 --> 41:45.500]  But with the supply chain breakdowns prices are going up
[41:46.060 --> 41:51.820]  Availability is going down and it's it's just crazy. So please get products while you still can and support the info or
[41:51.820 --> 41:53.820]  info or store.com
[41:55.180 --> 42:00.540]  Gerald and South Carolina. Go ahead. You're on the air trying to move quicker. Hey, Alex. Welcome. Would like to say first off
[42:00.540 --> 42:05.420]  Thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people
[42:05.420 --> 42:11.260]  I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria
[42:11.820 --> 42:15.900]  Infection on my lung that'll never go away. Living defense saved my life
[42:15.900 --> 42:20.060]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that all I had to do was get a double amputee
[42:20.060 --> 42:24.220]  Antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back
[42:24.460 --> 42:29.820]  I wanted to just quote from the bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now
[42:29.980 --> 42:34.860]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be
[42:35.580 --> 42:41.500]  Afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake
[42:41.660 --> 42:47.100]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another
[42:47.100 --> 42:53.020]  That's right where we're at brother and that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say
[42:53.340 --> 42:56.540]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country
[42:58.780 --> 43:04.460]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world. They are creating insecurity crime war and famine
[43:04.940 --> 43:08.460]  All of this should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready
[43:08.940 --> 43:13.900]  For ourselves and our family's sakes, but also our community and citizens stronghold.com
[43:13.900 --> 43:18.780]  Is the best place to go to get high quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find

[44:07.500 --> 44:09.500]  Earth is dominated by a powerful
[44:10.540 --> 44:12.540]  It's known as the builder bird
[44:13.420 --> 44:15.420]  Both their objectives be world domination
[44:16.300 --> 44:18.860]  For thousands of years their dark order grew
[44:19.660 --> 44:27.100]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is in hand
[44:27.740 --> 44:32.460]  The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago. It is the blueprint for their plan to figure the world

[44:54.220 --> 44:58.700]  That will trigger distribution by proxy meaning we the people cannot be stopped
[44:58.700 --> 45:05.020]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[45:19.260 --> 45:25.740]  Well, you've got your diamond and you've got your pretty clothes
[45:25.740 --> 45:29.900]  And the chauffeur drives your car
[45:30.780 --> 45:32.620]  You let every
[45:32.620 --> 45:34.620]  a jury in minnesota
[45:35.740 --> 45:39.260]  found former minneapolis police officer derek chauvin
[45:39.980 --> 45:41.980]  guilty on all counts
[45:42.940 --> 45:44.940]  and the murder
[45:44.940 --> 45:46.940]  of george floyd last may
[45:48.220 --> 45:50.220]  It was a murder
[45:50.220 --> 45:52.220]  in a full light of day
[45:52.220 --> 45:55.820]  And it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see
[45:56.940 --> 45:59.820]  The systemic racism the vice president just referred to
[46:00.860 --> 46:04.780]  There was systemic racism that's a stain on our nation's soul
[46:05.900 --> 46:09.340]  the knee on the neck of justice for black americans
[46:10.860 --> 46:12.860]  profound fear and trauma
[46:13.420 --> 46:15.420]  the pain the exhaustion
[46:15.660 --> 46:19.340]  And black and brown americans experience every single day
[46:19.340 --> 46:21.340]  The murder george floyd
[46:22.140 --> 46:24.140]  launched a summer of protest
[46:24.700 --> 46:26.620]  We hadn't seen since the
[46:26.620 --> 46:32.220]  All right, so this chinese communist spy that again supports china running a death camp with three million
[46:32.460 --> 46:34.460]  muslim men in it
[46:34.460 --> 46:38.700]  A million buddhist a million christians that's all confirmed all conservative. He said they're allowed to do it
[46:38.700 --> 46:41.100]  It's a ggp. He's the controlled china strong china
[46:42.620 --> 46:43.900]  That's a quote
[46:43.900 --> 46:46.700]  And he can do what he wants in hong kong that monster
[46:46.700 --> 46:50.220]  Knows he can hide behind one black man that died
[46:51.500 --> 46:55.100]  And claim he represents america black people and goodness
[46:55.740 --> 46:57.740]  They said george floyd is justice
[46:58.300 --> 47:01.820]  And they represent george floyd and if you try to criticize anything they do
[47:02.540 --> 47:08.140]  If you're a real black panther member or your brianna taylor's mother or you're anybody you get censored
[47:09.020 --> 47:11.340]  Because they've stolen your identity
[47:11.340 --> 47:15.580]  And they want to play us off against each other
[47:17.740 --> 47:21.500]  And they want to start racial conflict in this country
[47:25.180 --> 47:27.900]  It's already been at historic highs black on white crime
[47:28.620 --> 47:32.380]  There's a lot of black young people are buying into a lie and doing and it's terrible
[47:32.380 --> 47:40.700]  But they're highly impressionable and they're being told that this is what you should do
[47:41.260 --> 47:44.460]  And I just saw a video of this morning and it's an article on informers.com
[47:44.460 --> 47:46.220]  We'll play next hour while we take your calls
[47:46.220 --> 47:47.740]  columbus ohio
[47:47.740 --> 47:52.780]  A quote little black baby the media said she's a big girl for 15
[47:53.660 --> 47:55.660]  Looks like she hasn't missed out on any cheeseburgers
[47:57.100 --> 48:00.380]  She was stabbing a white woman and a black woman
[48:00.380 --> 48:02.940]  With a eight inch knife
[48:04.220 --> 48:06.220]  Looks like a short butcher knife
[48:06.780 --> 48:08.780]  Black people call the police
[48:08.780 --> 48:11.180]  The cop gets there and she keeps stabbing people
[48:13.020 --> 48:15.740]  And so they were stabbed two people were stabbed
[48:18.300 --> 48:20.300]  And because the white devil
[48:20.780 --> 48:27.980]  Shot the black angel black lives matters protesting and rioting and the lawyers are saying she was unarmed and a good person
[48:27.980 --> 48:29.980]  Even though it's all on video that
[48:31.020 --> 48:34.460]  The cops pull up and say stop and they just keep stabbing and keep kicking
[48:35.900 --> 48:37.900]  Until the cops shoot sir
[48:38.460 --> 48:40.620]  But you better believe you see what color his skin is
[48:41.260 --> 48:43.260]  That's a white
[48:43.340 --> 48:45.340]  devil
[48:46.380 --> 48:48.380]  But the black angels called the white devil
[48:49.340 --> 48:51.020]  They conjured him up
[48:51.020 --> 48:53.020]  Out of a pentagram on the ground
[48:53.020 --> 48:55.820]  Let's show the black angel again. Let's show paul joseph watches tweet
[48:55.820 --> 49:00.620]  And that's video where the cops put it on big screen tv and police departments don't have big budgets
[49:00.620 --> 49:02.620]  So the cheaper tvs, you know, we're divided into squares
[49:03.340 --> 49:07.660]  The left's even saying oh, it's fake video. It's not real. The police put out fake video. Yeah, right
[49:08.940 --> 49:13.500]  Look at that little black angel right there stabbing another black angel
[49:15.820 --> 49:19.420]  She's just stabbing somebody full power with an eight inch knife. That's no big deal
[49:19.420 --> 49:25.340]  People say well, why didn't they run? Well, it was a black dude beating them up when they tried to go
[49:26.700 --> 49:29.580]  It was a black guy keeping them there so they can be stabbed
[49:30.300 --> 49:32.300]  I mean, I'm sorry a black angel
[49:32.460 --> 49:35.340]  A black jesus. I mean, well, what what is Pelosi say?
[49:36.060 --> 49:39.900]  Thank you, George Floyd. You are justice. Thank you for your sacrifice
[49:41.100 --> 49:46.300]  I mean, I guess coming up at the next Easter. We'll just worship George Floyd folks
[49:46.300 --> 49:51.020]  You know, I got about 20 videos of white people being attacked
[49:52.220 --> 49:54.220]  But you don't be white supremacist
[49:54.620 --> 49:58.460]  To show you black people attacking white people the white people deserve it. Remember because they're white
[49:58.460 --> 50:02.220]  I mean the media told us if you're white, you're bad. That's anti-racism
[50:03.180 --> 50:07.740]  Remember what Cuomo said last week. He said when we start getting more white kids dead
[50:07.740 --> 50:11.820]  Maybe we'll do something about the epidemic of police killing people. There's not an epidemic of police killing people
[50:11.820 --> 50:18.220]  Police have body cams. So everything they do gets put out. And so every few weeks you get something questionable
[50:18.460 --> 50:22.460]  You know when a cop gets shot on body cam, nobody cares. There's like 10 of those a day
[50:23.020 --> 50:25.020]  But literally
[50:25.020 --> 50:27.020]  About 10 a day cops get shot in some body cam
[50:27.580 --> 50:33.500]  Some dash cam but that's the cop that they deserve it. But oh my gosh, we got a we got them
[50:33.500 --> 50:37.820]  We got a black guy being shot white supremacist killed him. Turns out it's two black cops
[50:37.820 --> 50:41.820]  When he's charging I'm trying to stab him with a butcher knife for three minutes
[50:42.460 --> 50:47.340]  You charge me one time with a butcher knife. I got a gun. I don't care. What color you are. I'm gonna shoot your ass
[50:48.540 --> 50:53.740]  They're letting this guy come on. I'm a black man. I don't want to kill you. Don't no don't do it. Don't do it
[50:53.740 --> 50:58.540]  He's like trying to stab him. I told you don't do it. Let me dodge that. Let me dodge again. Let me dodge again
[50:58.780 --> 51:01.260]  Because there's so black cops are scared
[51:02.540 --> 51:06.140]  To defend themselves because all the media is trying to stab him
[51:06.140 --> 51:08.140]  Themselves because all the media
[51:09.820 --> 51:13.500]  What are we gonna do if the media calls us a white supremac?
[51:17.740 --> 51:21.580]  And and people are so emboldened I don't care what color they are black or white you name it
[51:22.540 --> 51:25.340]  Incidences of cops getting shot at is off the charts right now
[51:28.700 --> 51:34.060]  There's people feeling bold and like the cops the bad guy and I'm moral if I shoot at police
[51:34.060 --> 51:39.260]  I'm moral if I go after the police. I'm moral because they deserve it
[51:39.820 --> 51:44.700]  When somebody's mother or daughter or brother or father calls the police
[51:46.700 --> 51:52.620]  And they show up to some house with some gun or butcher knife wielding lunatic and they
[51:53.340 --> 51:56.700]  Defend themselves immediately. It's white supremacy
[51:56.700 --> 52:05.340]  Yeah, let's show some of the footage from last night
[52:06.700 --> 52:10.620]  Let's go ahead and roll this with audio. This is BLM surrounds truck in Minneapolis
[52:10.620 --> 52:14.620]  How would you and your family like this just because you're white you get surrounded and it's actually again
[52:15.100 --> 52:20.780]  Weirdo white people are always leading it and I'm not defending the blacks who are involved. I'm just saying you should point this out
[52:20.780 --> 52:28.140]  It's disgusting. They're all the professor types out there doing it. Then we've got, uh, cost. I've got so many of these clips

[54:56.060 --> 55:02.140]  9 million or 60 million black people got aborted by market singer. Oh, but you're a big old fat ass welfare head

[57:46.140 --> 57:48.540]  And the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[57:51.980 --> 57:54.620]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[57:56.940 --> 58:02.220]  Minutes ago nancy polosi after a triple guilty verdict by the minnesota jury
[58:02.620 --> 58:04.620]  Said that george floyd
[58:04.620 --> 58:10.860]  Was a saint that she thanked him for his conscious sacrifice. He wasn't killed by officer chauvin
[58:11.100 --> 58:15.900]  He was like jesus in the garden of gas symphony that gave himself up to die
[58:16.620 --> 58:23.020]  He was a sacrifice. She said you are a sacrifice. They're launching a new religion. The cia cooked it up
[58:23.020 --> 58:28.380]  It's called liberation theology and that's what they're doing to divide and conquer this country
[58:28.540 --> 58:31.900]  They're the democrats living the nation. They're the democrats that's all out of the common china
[58:31.900 --> 58:36.860]  They're the democrats that are engaged in every form of corruption you can imagine
[58:37.020 --> 58:41.180]  But now nancy polosi wearing a little face diaper says, oh george floyd
[58:41.900 --> 58:45.260]  Thank you for your death so we can defeat the evil police
[58:45.740 --> 58:53.020]  The lowest level of the government the democrats say they're the resistance, but they have the media the corporations the universities
[58:53.500 --> 58:58.860]  The eu the chai comms hollywood all against the american people and now
[58:58.860 --> 59:03.740]  They're breaking our borders and flooding with third world populations teaching them that white people are evil
[59:04.300 --> 59:09.340]  They're the closest things the nazis i've ever seen with the adl and the southern primary law center
[59:09.420 --> 59:13.900]  They're making their move on us. We got to wake up now. So here's this old evil witch
[59:15.340 --> 59:17.340]  Praying to the heavens to george floyd
[59:17.980 --> 59:22.940]  The sense and all drug addict. It's so sad. Thank you george floyd
[59:23.740 --> 59:26.060]  for sacrificing your life for justice
[59:26.060 --> 59:31.500]  For being there to call out to your mom. How how heartbreaking was that?
[59:31.980 --> 59:35.980]  Call out for your mom. I can't breathe but because of you
[59:36.860 --> 59:38.860]  and because of
[59:38.940 --> 59:43.660]  Thousands millions of people around the world who came out for justice
[59:44.300 --> 59:46.300]  Your name will always be synonymous
[59:47.260 --> 59:52.300]  With justice the jury in minnesota was held hostage in the chauvin trial
[59:52.300 --> 59:59.100]  They were told by nancy polosi by the public president biden buy mad maxine waters that you better
[59:59.180 --> 1:00:05.580]  Convict your white supremacist and america will burn and they came in with all three saying guilty guilty guilty
[1:00:05.900 --> 1:00:12.700]  Political correctness is a religion. It's a cult and now we're being told george floyd is jesus by nancy polosi
[1:00:12.700 --> 1:00:24.300]  We have made the deliberate decision to temporarily enhance police officers authority for the duration of the stay at home order
[1:00:25.180 --> 1:00:31.820]  Moving forward police will have the authority to require any individual who is not in a place of residence
[1:00:32.220 --> 1:00:37.820]  To first provide their purpose for not being at home and provide their home address
[1:00:37.820 --> 1:00:45.900]  Police will also have the authority to stop a vehicle to inquire about an individual's reason for leaving their residence
[1:00:46.140 --> 1:00:50.300]  Stay home. Keep your distance or now pay the price
[1:00:51.660 --> 1:00:57.980]  Police with axes and assault rifles raided this venue in salpaolo and found about 600 party goers
[1:00:58.300 --> 1:01:04.780]  Most without masks. It was a case of asking people to go home and if they didn't arrest him nine police checkpoints
[1:01:04.780 --> 1:01:09.420]  Have now been set up around the perimeter of Auckland as it's 1.6 million
[1:01:09.820 --> 1:01:17.340]  Residents return to level 3 lockdown. This is the video that raised questions about how new york city is enforcing social distancing
[1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:20.540]  The man was handcuffed in the stands for not wearing a mask
[1:01:20.940 --> 1:01:26.700]  Disturbing video showing a violent clash between apparent social distancing violators and police in brooklyn
[1:01:26.700 --> 1:01:34.700]  And this cell phone video capturing the moment an officer waves at taser and repeatedly strikes a bystander during the social distancing bust
[1:01:36.700 --> 1:01:41.340]  Get your hand off of me. You are kidnapping me. I have got nothing illegal
[1:01:47.180 --> 1:01:52.060]  Canadians are being hit with penalties now as governments move to reinforce the shutdowns
[1:01:52.060 --> 1:01:57.420]  Right across the country and the city is also taking their masks mandate seriously later in the hour
[1:01:57.500 --> 1:02:02.300]  I'm going to play the full report by Darren McBreen that just shows some of the violence around the world including the u.s
[1:02:02.860 --> 1:02:04.860]  Under the covid fraud
[1:02:04.860 --> 1:02:10.220]  So when the police brutally beat men women and children with billy clubs in the head for not wearing masks, it's liberal and good
[1:02:12.140 --> 1:02:16.780]  But if somebody's on fentanyl and having a heart attack and the police restraining them, they're bad
[1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:19.900]  This is how the system uses the police against us
[1:02:19.900 --> 1:02:24.140]  But then puts the police on a very short political leash
[1:02:25.740 --> 1:02:28.060]  The video is titled police take crackdown on unmaskers
[1:02:28.300 --> 1:02:30.940]  It's in the Darren McBreen section of ban dot video
[1:02:30.940 --> 1:02:34.220]  So if we click the left hand corner behind the video and share it and point out
[1:02:34.540 --> 1:02:40.140]  Why aren't people upset about this true police brutality and when we come back i'm going to explain something to you
[1:02:40.700 --> 1:02:42.140]  The police
[1:02:42.140 --> 1:02:45.500]  Could be our enemy. They could be our number one enemy
[1:02:45.500 --> 1:02:50.940]  I'll explain that in a moment by clipping the light switch. They could go from being good to being bad
[1:02:57.500 --> 1:02:59.500]  The equation is very simple
[1:03:00.220 --> 1:03:03.260]  The mega banks control the media they control big pharma
[1:03:03.900 --> 1:03:05.900]  They control academia
[1:03:06.460 --> 1:03:09.980]  They control the military industrial complex. They control big tech
[1:03:09.980 --> 1:03:17.340]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world. They have established absolute total despotism
[1:03:18.220 --> 1:03:19.980]  and dehumanization
[1:03:19.980 --> 1:03:25.260]  It is the western christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[1:03:25.740 --> 1:03:30.860]  Women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them. So because they can't defeat that empowering
[1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:35.420]  Ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and use
[1:03:35.420 --> 1:03:43.500]  The idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly some control
[1:03:44.300 --> 1:03:48.460]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them
[1:03:48.780 --> 1:03:53.660]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban dot video
[1:03:53.660 --> 1:04:05.340]  So we double your efforts. We're all in this together
[1:04:09.340 --> 1:04:15.340]  You are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report. It's alex jones
[1:04:16.780 --> 1:04:18.780]  The globalists do not believe in the people
[1:04:18.780 --> 1:04:26.380]  I thought they shoveled pure propaganda and lies at you but published books and white papers and gave speeches to themselves
[1:04:26.860 --> 1:04:31.260]  Admitting they're carrying out world government admitting they're dumbing down the population for control
[1:04:31.900 --> 1:04:33.900]  Admittedly engaged in the population
[1:04:35.020 --> 1:04:37.020]  Well, I've always believed in the people
[1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:44.140]  And that's why I've tailored this broadcast as a populist program to just put out very sophisticated information
[1:04:44.140 --> 1:04:51.500]  But also simple truths at the same time believing that if you up the level of information that ups the level of understanding
[1:04:51.740 --> 1:04:55.740]  Not dumb the information down and dumb down the population of feedback loop
[1:04:57.420 --> 1:05:00.700]  But that said when I do this governmental briefing style
[1:05:01.580 --> 1:05:04.700]  PowerPoints and and Gaston just go over documents
[1:05:05.580 --> 1:05:11.900]  That is extremely effective not just with like general Flynn, but I can tell you prime ministers world leaders
[1:05:11.900 --> 1:05:16.220]  Uh, they had CIA boardrooms two weeks ago and our spars
[1:05:17.100 --> 1:05:22.540]  2025 2028 report because it was done in a briefing format
[1:05:23.500 --> 1:05:30.380]  And so I do the talk radio format. I've been doing it for 27 years 26 years on talk radio 27 years period on air
[1:05:31.660 --> 1:05:33.660]  first year on access tv
[1:05:35.420 --> 1:05:38.380]  And I'm not saying that I want to stop doing this show
[1:05:38.380 --> 1:05:43.340]  It's not that they've ground me down with the media and attacks and all that. It's the opposite
[1:05:43.420 --> 1:05:47.740]  That actually makes me fight harder at a big new york times article about jones is ground down
[1:05:47.820 --> 1:05:49.980]  He's better to quit because of us and
[1:05:50.620 --> 1:05:54.060]  You know, if they do the reverse psychology, it's the opposite that makes me work harder
[1:05:54.060 --> 1:05:57.420]  But I want to transcend that and just do what's right
[1:05:58.060 --> 1:06:01.820]  But I am considering just doing like a podcast once a week
[1:06:02.620 --> 1:06:04.620]  Uh, and then special briefings
[1:06:04.620 --> 1:06:11.020]  A couple times a week that just go through every detail and explain the whole thing because I understand this whole thing
[1:06:11.420 --> 1:06:15.500]  I mean, I really know how it works. I've immersed myself completely in this and
[1:06:17.100 --> 1:06:20.540]  If you can visually show people in a power point
[1:06:21.180 --> 1:06:23.180]  With slides is how people are best
[1:06:24.620 --> 1:06:26.620]  Awakened you can do it because
[1:06:27.580 --> 1:06:33.260]  I don't just need to show you how they're doing it. I can show you them saying they're doing it
[1:06:33.260 --> 1:06:37.340]  It's not just you can see it and know it and and see the pieces
[1:06:38.380 --> 1:06:43.660]  They admit in the wiki leaks. They admit in their statements. They're using racial division to control us
[1:06:44.460 --> 1:06:46.460]  This is an elitism not a
[1:06:47.180 --> 1:06:49.580]  A altruistic thing of the people
[1:06:51.580 --> 1:06:55.820]  So here it is the equation that I'll go to your phone calls is very very simple
[1:06:55.820 --> 1:07:03.820]  The globalist in the last 200 years got control of the printing and issuance of currency in europe
[1:07:04.380 --> 1:07:06.460]  Then they got control of the world after world war two
[1:07:08.140 --> 1:07:10.940]  Again, they financed all three sides of that conflict on record
[1:07:11.740 --> 1:07:18.220]  The same wall street bankers came out in the senator hearings in 1977 the church committees next to Anthony Sutton the congressional
[1:07:18.620 --> 1:07:21.020]  Archivist that was given access to all the classified reports
[1:07:21.900 --> 1:07:23.900]  Hitler was funded by the banks
[1:07:23.900 --> 1:07:26.460]  Lenin and Stalin were funded by the banks
[1:07:28.780 --> 1:07:33.820]  And the united states was funded by the very same banks and the uk so all three factions
[1:07:36.300 --> 1:07:40.780]  And we're sitting here today living in that post world war two world
[1:07:42.140 --> 1:07:44.940]  Well now the decision has been made to get rid of the us and bring us down
[1:07:45.260 --> 1:07:50.380]  So china can be the global dominant force and be the standardizing force with its authoritarianism
[1:07:50.380 --> 1:07:57.740]  Its nightmare ai its its nightmare social credit system for the final planetary takeover and the depopulation
[1:07:59.180 --> 1:08:04.940]  And the chinese government's fully signed on to that and agrees with it and sees their own public as cockroaches they want to get rid of
[1:08:10.460 --> 1:08:13.580]  But there's also a major fissure inside the new world order
[1:08:14.700 --> 1:08:18.780]  Where the chai comms are saying we're going to double cross the globalist down takeover ourselves
[1:08:18.780 --> 1:08:24.860]  And so now they're announcing they're going to have government ordered three children instead of government ordered only one child
[1:08:25.340 --> 1:08:27.740]  So now they're going into a hitlerian breeding program
[1:08:28.220 --> 1:08:33.340]  So that that's how these globalists and how these satanists and how these occultists and how these authoritarians always work
[1:08:33.580 --> 1:08:38.140]  Whether it was a 5000 years ago or 80 years ago or 20 years ago or today
[1:08:38.540 --> 1:08:42.460]  It's the same crap over and over again. They want the authoritarianism to get power
[1:08:42.940 --> 1:08:46.300]  But then they start fighting with each other over the power and it always goes haywire
[1:08:46.300 --> 1:08:51.820]  Human nature is the same over and over and over again
[1:08:54.220 --> 1:08:57.740]  That now china says they want three babies or you'll be executed
[1:08:59.820 --> 1:09:04.540]  So let's expand because they're going to use those men particularly where they they they they encourage having male babies
[1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:11.340]  So that you don't have enough women for the men to get a mate so they can be exported as as part of a genetic colonization program
[1:09:11.340 --> 1:09:19.020]  And they're on words and they're all about we're the master race. We're in charge ggping gives speeches loving Hitler
[1:09:19.660 --> 1:09:21.660]  You're not going to hear a word
[1:09:22.380 --> 1:09:26.300]  Out of the adl because they're riding that ggping peeping
[1:09:27.820 --> 1:09:29.820]  So that's
[1:09:30.060 --> 1:09:32.060]  How all this works
[1:09:33.100 --> 1:09:36.780]  You ought to see what ggping says actually about the adl's owners
[1:09:36.780 --> 1:09:43.820]  It's pretty amazing might want to look it up. See, you never get any of that in our news here folks
[1:09:48.940 --> 1:09:52.700]  So, uh, let me just give you the big enchilada then i'll go to your phone calls
[1:09:56.060 --> 1:09:59.180]  The globalists with their money have got the universities
[1:09:59.740 --> 1:10:00.860]  the banks
[1:10:00.860 --> 1:10:08.060]  The medical system the media system the world council of churches almost all the churches are just country clubs feel good groups
[1:10:09.420 --> 1:10:11.580]  I don't care if it's protestant catholic. That doesn't matter
[1:10:13.180 --> 1:10:17.820]  They've got hollywood. They've got the e.u. They've got radical islam and orthodox islam
[1:10:18.380 --> 1:10:22.140]  They've got israel. They've got south africa. They got everybody
[1:10:23.820 --> 1:10:25.820]  There's one thing they don't have
[1:10:25.820 --> 1:10:27.820]  And that's
[1:10:28.380 --> 1:10:30.380]  the u.s. Military
[1:10:30.380 --> 1:10:35.740]  And police now the u.s. Military's got its own stuff going on. It's got its own problems, believe me
[1:10:36.700 --> 1:10:40.140]  but it's still men and chivalry and
[1:10:40.700 --> 1:10:43.820]  To operate at that level some form of honor even though it's predatory
[1:10:44.540 --> 1:10:50.940]  And so the globalists want to intimidate it attack it cause race riots to selectively demonize the military and police with these purges
[1:10:50.940 --> 1:10:55.420]  To get control of them because once they get the police in the military
[1:10:56.300 --> 1:10:58.300]  And they've got them
[1:10:58.860 --> 1:11:00.860]  in china
[1:11:01.500 --> 1:11:03.500]  In europe
[1:11:04.140 --> 1:11:09.980]  In the blue cities, what do the cops do nothing when you get raped nothing about drug dealers nothing about pedophilia
[1:11:10.300 --> 1:11:12.300]  This is the police deal the drugs so
[1:11:13.100 --> 1:11:17.820]  When I say before the break the police like a light switch can go from being on to off
[1:11:17.820 --> 1:11:22.860]  And when the police fall into the hands of a hitler or a linen
[1:11:23.420 --> 1:11:28.940]  Or a Stalin or a mal or a fidel Castro or a zeezy ping
[1:11:30.620 --> 1:11:32.620]  Or a hugo chavez
[1:11:33.020 --> 1:11:35.020]  They do become your enemy
[1:11:35.900 --> 1:11:37.900]  And right now
[1:11:37.900 --> 1:11:39.900]  You have the intimidation and the attacks
[1:11:40.540 --> 1:11:42.540]  on the police
[1:11:42.940 --> 1:11:45.500]  By the feds by the globalists to put them under arrest
[1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:48.700]  By the feds by the globalists to put them under you in control
[1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:56.380]  And all over the country the police don't just get on their knees to george floyd. They lay on their bellies
[1:11:58.300 --> 1:12:04.540]  And when a father is being attacked at his own home the police come and arrest him when a man's trying to get to his family
[1:12:04.540 --> 1:12:09.020]  In his own neighborhood, but with black lives matter there in his face. He gets arrested
[1:12:11.100 --> 1:12:13.500]  Because the police are just like everybody else
[1:12:13.500 --> 1:12:20.380]  They are folding. They are bowing. They are capitulating because we don't have leadership
[1:12:21.260 --> 1:12:23.980]  And so I want to give you the honest prognosis
[1:12:24.300 --> 1:12:29.820]  I'm not like the cue people to tell you everything's fine. We won the war and just don't we don't know we're losing
[1:12:31.260 --> 1:12:36.060]  And everything's collapsing and we have no future unless you get upset and speak out and take action
[1:12:36.220 --> 1:12:40.460]  Now it's because we were winning culturally. There was a huge awakening great victory
[1:12:40.460 --> 1:12:44.940]  But now the globalists have taken their whole plan
[1:12:45.660 --> 1:12:49.340]  And launched it and accelerated their timetable which is extremely reckless
[1:12:49.660 --> 1:12:55.180]  But because everyone's so busy genuflecting to be politically correct the new religion
[1:12:57.020 --> 1:13:03.820]  It only gets worse and the more the police bow and the more the preachers bow and the more you just go along with it
[1:13:03.900 --> 1:13:06.780]  Like chick filet had the best business ever being conservative
[1:13:06.780 --> 1:13:10.940]  But once they grovel their business went down because they're not conservative anymore. They're leftist
[1:13:11.500 --> 1:13:18.140]  Because they're nothing but a bunch of virtues sigmores because the founder retired. He's senile the sun takes over and starts
[1:13:19.900 --> 1:13:25.660]  Massaging a black person's shoes and shining his shoes like I'm white you shine my shoes
[1:13:25.660 --> 1:13:27.660]  I shine yours as if that even happened
[1:13:27.980 --> 1:13:31.580]  Creating racial division creating the idea that white people are bad
[1:13:31.580 --> 1:13:39.180]  This is the whole idea. This doesn't de-escalate. This gets the mob more hyped up more out of control more crazy
[1:13:40.540 --> 1:13:43.740]  And now you see what the genuflection and the bowling's done
[1:13:44.060 --> 1:13:50.140]  You're now on your knees and the tricoms of the model, but no one dare criticize them
[1:13:50.380 --> 1:13:54.380]  They run real death camps. They've got human animal clones. They're liberal
[1:13:54.380 --> 1:14:02.300]  A hundred and seventy years ago the british royal family financed scientists to develop a plan for scientific
[1:14:02.860 --> 1:14:09.580]  Dictatorship worldwide that grew into the robber barons and then into the eugenics movement hitler and of course the rest is history
[1:14:09.580 --> 1:14:14.940]  Our film in game blueprint for global enslavement has been censored on amazon and many other big platforms
[1:14:15.180 --> 1:14:21.660]  Sending the documentary film back to the top of the charts. It's been selling online for as much as $300 a copy
[1:14:21.660 --> 1:14:25.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have mass produced it again in the highest quality hd

[1:14:44.540 --> 1:14:49.660]  This film predicted the great reset the new order takeover the fake virus and so much more
[1:14:49.660 --> 1:14:55.260]  That's why the film is evergreen and more explosive than ever get it today at infowarstore.com
[1:14:55.500 --> 1:14:59.100]  I'm up here working on a thursday night in mid april 2021
[1:14:59.740 --> 1:15:03.500]  And I just want to say something. I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew
[1:15:04.220 --> 1:15:08.620]  That has come together over the years. It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful
[1:15:09.020 --> 1:15:13.100]  For all of you the listeners of this show. I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you
[1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:16.300]  Whether you are old whether you are spanning white black
[1:15:16.300 --> 1:15:21.820]  It doesn't matter. You got red blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children
[1:15:21.900 --> 1:15:27.980]  We are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years
[1:15:28.460 --> 1:15:31.580]  And it's crazier things are I want to keep working into the future
[1:15:32.380 --> 1:15:34.780]  But again, that's really up to you and up to god
[1:15:35.340 --> 1:15:40.220]  So please I hope god works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us
[1:15:40.620 --> 1:15:42.780]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with god
[1:15:42.780 --> 1:15:46.700]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us of what you've done
[1:15:47.180 --> 1:15:50.860]  And just ask you again to pray to god and ask what god's vision is for you
[1:15:51.260 --> 1:15:54.780]  And hopefully god will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless
[1:15:54.780 --> 1:16:10.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:16:24.780 --> 1:16:28.220]  I'm alive tonight, out on the streets again
[1:16:28.300 --> 1:16:31.820]  Pull me on, I'm the hot stuff, something you'll never forget
[1:16:32.540 --> 1:16:36.300]  Take my bits and break the walls, untie the knot
[1:16:36.300 --> 1:16:39.020]  No, no, no, better tell me no
[1:16:39.020 --> 1:16:40.860]  You better set me free
[1:16:40.860 --> 1:16:43.340]  Cause I'm a hard one, we all rolling free
[1:16:43.340 --> 1:16:45.180]  A little bit better than it used to be
[1:16:45.180 --> 1:16:46.140]  Cause I'm alive
[1:16:47.420 --> 1:16:50.860]  Life won't be hard, come on my life
[1:16:50.860 --> 1:16:55.340]  The communists, the globalist, the rock styles, the sorrows of the world
[1:16:55.340 --> 1:16:57.900]  They don't want to get rid of the police, they want to be the police
[1:16:59.900 --> 1:17:02.140]  They want to run our lives and they're so close to doing it
[1:17:02.140 --> 1:17:05.980]  They want to persecute us, they want to get us in those dungeons like they always do
[1:17:06.860 --> 1:17:08.700]  But this time they're going to meet the American people
[1:17:08.700 --> 1:17:11.260]  And even the skeleton of what we were will defeat them in the end
[1:17:12.220 --> 1:17:16.060]  Because yet this great contest is going to reopen our channel to god
[1:17:16.060 --> 1:17:19.740]  And make us finally become humble and cry out to god
[1:17:19.740 --> 1:17:22.140]  Our heavenly father for protection and he will not
[1:17:23.100 --> 1:17:23.820]  Dessert us
[1:17:25.020 --> 1:17:26.300]  But you must do it humbly
[1:17:30.860 --> 1:17:34.540]  William in California, people are asleep and programmed controlled
[1:17:35.100 --> 1:17:37.500]  I agree, how do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[1:17:39.020 --> 1:17:41.020]  Oh hi, Alex, thanks for taking my call
[1:17:42.620 --> 1:17:46.700]  I'm in Washington, I'm kind of a student of history here to a degree
[1:17:46.700 --> 1:17:50.780]  And I've been watching things here for a long time
[1:17:50.780 --> 1:17:57.980]  From the early days of Rush and the days of Hostage
[1:17:58.700 --> 1:18:02.060]  If you remember the 495th day of Hostage
[1:18:03.100 --> 1:18:05.100]  Sir, 1979, 1980
[1:18:06.780 --> 1:18:09.900]  It was, yeah, the point here
[1:18:10.780 --> 1:18:12.700]  We have so many things going on here
[1:18:12.700 --> 1:18:18.140]  And we have these masks which are being proven to be ineffective
[1:18:18.140 --> 1:18:21.340]  And our leadership is struggling
[1:18:21.340 --> 1:18:24.700]  Like Representative Jordan was struggling the other day
[1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:29.820]  Being told to shut his mouth to establish facts
[1:18:31.260 --> 1:18:33.260]  And where is our leadership?
[1:18:33.260 --> 1:18:36.300]  We have so many things here in front of our face
[1:18:37.420 --> 1:18:39.020]  You know, what do they have assigned?
[1:18:39.020 --> 1:18:41.180]  I agree, people are intimidated
[1:18:41.180 --> 1:18:45.340]  People should be scared of the globalists and fight them hard
[1:18:45.340 --> 1:18:47.740]  Like when I'm being attacked, I fight hard
[1:18:47.740 --> 1:18:51.020]  People get attacked, they run, that's not the instinct
[1:18:51.020 --> 1:18:53.660]  Like when a dog chases you, you don't run, you kick it in the head
[1:18:54.220 --> 1:18:56.540]  And exactly they're attacking us
[1:18:56.540 --> 1:19:00.940]  I don't get this false instinct of just groveling and pissing all of ourselves
[1:19:00.940 --> 1:19:02.300]  I mean, Nunes is a great guy
[1:19:03.180 --> 1:19:08.060]  He just came out and said they are using the CIA on Americans, it's illegal
[1:19:08.060 --> 1:19:09.340]  Who'll arrest their ass?
[1:19:09.340 --> 1:19:10.780]  Oh, it's the CIA
[1:19:10.780 --> 1:19:12.700]  It's a bunch of damn pedophiles, man
[1:19:13.900 --> 1:19:15.580]  Oh, I'm so scared of the CIA
[1:19:15.580 --> 1:19:17.660]  Burn it, hell, CIA, burn it, hell
[1:19:18.860 --> 1:19:21.740]  It's such an insult when people say I'm with the CIA
[1:19:21.740 --> 1:19:25.020]  That's like saying I'm with, I'm with maggots
[1:19:26.300 --> 1:19:30.860]  I'm with God, burn it, hell, burn it, hell, burn it, hell, go ahead
[1:19:31.980 --> 1:19:35.820]  Alex, I equate this, I tell a lot of my friends this
[1:19:35.820 --> 1:19:38.140]  I said, where is our brave heart moment?
[1:19:38.140 --> 1:19:45.020]  The brave heart moment, what I mean is, when the Highlanders finally said that's enough
[1:19:45.820 --> 1:19:48.620]  Okay, when you kill my wife, that's enough
[1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:53.500]  When do we, when we're being shoveled into the Chinese FEMA camps?
[1:19:53.500 --> 1:19:53.980]  What?
[1:19:53.980 --> 1:19:56.540]  Well, that's the thing, the enemy doesn't do frontal assaults
[1:19:56.540 --> 1:19:58.700]  Hitler lost, he's in a frontal assault
[1:19:58.700 --> 1:20:00.620]  The Soviets lost in a frontal assault
[1:20:00.620 --> 1:20:03.900]  This is all creepy, oh, it's not hurting you, it's good, oh, take the shot
[1:20:03.900 --> 1:20:06.780]  Even though it's killing people, and then while they're killing black people,
[1:20:06.780 --> 1:20:11.100]  they hire the black leaders to run around and say horrible stuff to make us hate black people
[1:20:11.100 --> 1:20:12.540]  I mean, you see the equation, right?
[1:20:13.340 --> 1:20:17.420]  Exactly, totally, and it doesn't mean when some group of black
[1:20:17.420 --> 1:20:20.300]  Racists are in my face and I'm not worried about it, but I get
[1:20:20.300 --> 1:20:23.260]  The full lineage of where it came from, does that make sense?
[1:20:24.060 --> 1:20:28.220]  I do, and we should psych off them back, we need to psych off them
[1:20:28.220 --> 1:20:31.820]  We need to get on this playing field with them
[1:20:31.820 --> 1:20:36.300]  And get in their face and say, hey, you know, psych off you
[1:20:36.300 --> 1:20:37.180]  Psych off you
[1:20:37.980 --> 1:20:40.060]  Well, I agree, I want to tell the globalist something to message
[1:20:40.060 --> 1:20:43.740]  You know, they do fake stuff so much, they become fake themselves
[1:20:44.780 --> 1:20:47.820]  When I engage in violence, it's not simulated, it's not like some
[1:20:48.700 --> 1:20:52.460]  People get in a fight, they like simulate breaking somebody's nose or bashing their brains out
[1:20:52.460 --> 1:20:56.460]  And I don't want violence, but they just keep pushing and pushing
[1:20:56.460 --> 1:21:01.020]  And they need to know, once this kicks off the next time, we're not going to give them any quarter
[1:21:01.020 --> 1:21:02.700]  We're going to burn them out of their holes
[1:21:03.500 --> 1:21:04.860]  Right, right
[1:21:04.860 --> 1:21:06.780]  Can I plug Alex real quick?
[1:21:06.780 --> 1:21:07.180]  Yeah, go ahead
[1:21:08.060 --> 1:21:13.260]  Hey, I'm in my 60s and I do the work of 25, 30 year olds
[1:21:13.260 --> 1:21:15.820]  And I work them into the ground and you want to know why
[1:21:15.820 --> 1:21:18.940]  And I've tested this and I've taken your B12
[1:21:19.740 --> 1:21:24.140]  And let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price
[1:21:24.140 --> 1:21:24.860]  I really do
[1:21:26.300 --> 1:21:29.420]  I take that B12 and I'm electric, man
[1:21:30.620 --> 1:21:33.340]  I can run 10 miles
[1:21:33.340 --> 1:21:36.620]  I did some pretty heavy work with the highway department
[1:21:36.620 --> 1:21:39.820]  And my friends will attest to the fact that
[1:21:41.420 --> 1:21:45.100]  Yeah, for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70
[1:21:46.300 --> 1:21:49.820]  And I'm not just blowing smoke here, the B12
[1:21:51.260 --> 1:21:52.460]  Saves my life
[1:21:52.460 --> 1:21:56.620]  Well, Brother, Mark Cuban owns a testing facility and he did a big
[1:21:57.580 --> 1:22:02.140]  Attack articles in Daily Beast, a bunch of publications a few years ago
[1:22:02.140 --> 1:22:03.340]  Like four years ago saying
[1:22:04.060 --> 1:22:09.020]  Jones's B12 is not poisonous, but it's not the highest quality
[1:22:09.020 --> 1:22:12.540]  Then they said, here's the highest quality, which he happened to be selling
[1:22:12.540 --> 1:22:14.060]  Which it was the highest quality
[1:22:14.060 --> 1:22:15.740]  I was private labeling that
[1:22:16.380 --> 1:22:17.180]  You understand
[1:22:17.180 --> 1:22:20.860]  So even their attack piece goes, well, Jones is overpriced
[1:22:20.860 --> 1:22:24.620]  But it is real B12, but we have the best organic highest certified
[1:22:24.620 --> 1:22:26.140]  Which I'd gone out and private labeled
[1:22:26.140 --> 1:22:27.020]  That's how God works
[1:22:27.980 --> 1:22:30.700]  Mark Cuban didn't tell people he owned that facility
[1:22:30.700 --> 1:22:34.540]  That was doing the sales or the testing
[1:22:34.540 --> 1:22:38.380]  He just had an article put out as an ad for his B12
[1:22:38.380 --> 1:22:39.020]  Not knowing
[1:22:39.580 --> 1:22:42.460]  Well, it's not his B12, it's the one he sells on a site
[1:22:42.460 --> 1:22:47.180]  That we were selling a private labeled version of the same B12 that is the highest rating
[1:22:47.180 --> 1:22:48.700]  So see what a sick joke that is?
[1:22:48.700 --> 1:22:51.420]  So yes, this is the highest rated B12 there is
[1:22:51.980 --> 1:22:53.100]  That's non-injectable
[1:22:53.100 --> 1:22:55.500]  It's the same stuff people inject, but don't inject it, folks
[1:22:55.500 --> 1:22:57.980]  It's taken under the tongue, but it's the same stuff
[1:22:57.980 --> 1:23:01.020]  You go to a doctor, get a prescription for it
[1:23:01.020 --> 1:23:04.380]  And it's getting me through, it really is
[1:23:04.380 --> 1:23:08.460]  I appreciate it, I appreciate all you guys deserve a medal of freedom
[1:23:09.260 --> 1:23:11.820]  Journalistic awards, you guys are the top
[1:23:11.820 --> 1:23:13.420]  Well, brother, I appreciate you and God bless you
[1:23:13.420 --> 1:23:15.100]  We're going to take one more call here and then go to break
[1:23:15.100 --> 1:23:16.860]  Got a guest coming up, we're only for a segment
[1:23:16.860 --> 1:23:21.740]  And I promise I'll get to Josh and Ivan and Ben and Stuart
[1:23:21.740 --> 1:23:22.780]  But let me be clear here
[1:23:23.420 --> 1:23:24.300]  I'm a mess
[1:23:24.300 --> 1:23:26.860]  I'm super stressed, I take all this stuff on
[1:23:26.860 --> 1:23:29.020]  I don't take the supplements most of the time like I should
[1:23:29.020 --> 1:23:30.140]  I don't know what my problem is
[1:23:31.180 --> 1:23:32.860]  I'm a wreck, I'm not going to lie about any of that
[1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:35.100]  So just because I'm giving advice out there
[1:23:35.100 --> 1:23:36.540]  Doesn't mean I follow my own advice
[1:23:36.540 --> 1:23:38.140]  People need to get that further ahead
[1:23:38.140 --> 1:23:40.700]  I'm aspiring to be better
[1:23:40.700 --> 1:23:42.860]  I'm aspiring, I'm not a hypocrite
[1:23:42.860 --> 1:23:45.980]  I'm not like overeating a T-bone steak and mashed potatoes
[1:23:45.980 --> 1:23:48.300]  And, you know, drinking two bottles of wine
[1:23:48.300 --> 1:23:49.740]  And then lying about it
[1:23:49.740 --> 1:23:52.460]  I'm saying I shouldn't be doing that and I should be taking the supplements
[1:23:52.460 --> 1:23:54.380]  Like all the time I'm like, why don't I take B12?
[1:23:54.380 --> 1:23:55.580]  Why don't I take the X2?
[1:23:55.580 --> 1:23:58.380]  Why don't I take, you know, vitamin D3?
[1:23:58.940 --> 1:24:00.620]  Because when I do it religiously
[1:24:00.620 --> 1:24:04.460]  My wife keeps moving the Lazy Susan off the dining room table
[1:24:04.460 --> 1:24:05.180]  She doesn't like it
[1:24:05.740 --> 1:24:07.820]  And when she does move it, I suddenly forget
[1:24:07.820 --> 1:24:08.620]  And she did it again
[1:24:08.620 --> 1:24:11.500]  I just realized last week I'm like, I've not been taking my supplements
[1:24:12.220 --> 1:24:14.780]  Because my wife doesn't like it in the middle of the table
[1:24:14.780 --> 1:24:15.660]  She takes hers
[1:24:15.660 --> 1:24:18.140]  She keeps hers in the cabinet by the bathroom
[1:24:18.700 --> 1:24:20.060]  Oh, she takes all her supplements
[1:24:20.060 --> 1:24:21.820]  She looks like the clothes off
[1:24:21.820 --> 1:24:24.460]  She looks like a Greek statue of like a goddess or something
[1:24:24.460 --> 1:24:27.100]  But, I mean, I don't have those genetics of hers
[1:24:27.100 --> 1:24:29.340]  And she also eats all those damn supplements
[1:24:29.340 --> 1:24:32.780]  But all I'm telling you is when I sit here and I tell you these supplements are great
[1:24:32.780 --> 1:24:33.420]  They're great
[1:24:33.420 --> 1:24:36.700]  Just as I look like some hog-like goblin from the 12th dimension of hell
[1:24:37.660 --> 1:24:39.100]  Is not a reflection on this
[1:24:39.100 --> 1:24:41.500]  But I have decided to be Christ-like
[1:24:41.500 --> 1:24:43.660]  And I don't mean that blasphemy, I'm serious
[1:24:43.660 --> 1:24:45.100]  I have taken on the sins
[1:24:45.100 --> 1:24:46.860]  I have taken them on
[1:24:46.860 --> 1:24:50.300]  I am in a poison vision of the enemy
[1:24:50.300 --> 1:24:52.380]  So I can see the enemy's operations
[1:24:52.380 --> 1:24:56.540]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement
[1:24:56.540 --> 1:24:58.300]  Made 14 years ago
[1:24:58.300 --> 1:25:01.180]  Accurately predicted the globalist takeover
[1:25:01.180 --> 1:25:02.780]  Using the great reset
[1:25:02.780 --> 1:25:05.020]  And the threat of a virus
[1:25:05.020 --> 1:25:07.500]  This film is now more important than ever
[1:25:07.500 --> 1:25:09.740]  I noticed just a few months ago that suddenly
[1:25:09.740 --> 1:25:11.260]  The limited supply we had
[1:25:11.260 --> 1:25:13.820]  At m4warstore.com had sold out
[1:25:13.820 --> 1:25:16.300]  And people were really talking about the documentary
[1:25:16.300 --> 1:25:19.420]  Because major platforms like Amazon had banned it
[1:25:19.420 --> 1:25:21.980]  Because the globalists had openly criticized the film
[1:25:21.980 --> 1:25:23.260]  Like the New York Times
[1:25:23.260 --> 1:25:26.300]  And so we printed 20,000 copies
[1:25:26.300 --> 1:25:27.900]  Now back in print
[1:25:27.900 --> 1:25:29.100]  And in less than two weeks
[1:25:29.100 --> 1:25:31.020]  We've already sold half of them
[1:25:31.020 --> 1:25:33.020]  This is very, very exciting
[1:25:33.020 --> 1:25:34.700]  We're selling them close to cost
[1:25:34.700 --> 1:25:37.020]  At 3.95 a piece if you buy them in bulk
[1:25:37.020 --> 1:25:38.940]  Or 14.95 if you buy them individually
[1:25:38.940 --> 1:25:40.700]  There is a zero country code on it
[1:25:40.700 --> 1:25:43.420]  Meaning you can copy this anywhere in the world
[1:25:43.420 --> 1:25:43.980]  Get it
[1:25:43.980 --> 1:25:44.860]  Earn copies
[1:25:44.860 --> 1:25:45.820]  You share it with everyone
[1:25:45.820 --> 1:25:46.940]  It's blowing people away
[1:25:46.940 --> 1:25:47.820]  It's evergreen
[1:25:47.820 --> 1:25:48.780]  It predicted it all
[1:25:48.780 --> 1:25:50.220]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement
[1:25:50.220 --> 1:25:51.580]  Available now in DVD

[1:26:24.620 --> 1:26:26.620]  In inflammatory responses
[1:26:26.620 --> 1:26:28.940]  In joints and the digestive system
[1:26:28.940 --> 1:26:31.100]  Recent studies have suggested
[1:26:31.100 --> 1:26:33.980]  That high EPA and DHA fish oil
[1:26:33.980 --> 1:26:36.060]  Can stimulate immune function
[1:26:36.060 --> 1:26:38.140]  By increasing the concentration
[1:26:38.140 --> 1:26:40.460]  And activity of immune cells
[1:26:40.460 --> 1:26:42.140]  It worked for my family
[1:26:42.140 --> 1:26:45.420]  And now I can have a logical and calm discussion

[1:26:55.180 --> 1:26:56.860]  I'm a very humble person
[1:26:56.860 --> 1:26:58.540]  But I'm also a bold person
[1:26:58.540 --> 1:27:00.140]  And so as bad as things are
[1:27:00.140 --> 1:27:02.060]  With the globalist attack on humanity
[1:27:02.060 --> 1:27:03.660]  Of all the terrible things that are unfolding
[1:27:03.660 --> 1:27:04.860]  I want you to know
[1:27:04.860 --> 1:27:07.660]  That a lot of positive things are happening as well
[1:27:08.460 --> 1:27:09.340]  I'm a public figure
[1:27:09.340 --> 1:27:10.780]  So I get to see things
[1:27:10.780 --> 1:27:11.900]  The zero public doesn't get to see
[1:27:11.900 --> 1:27:13.020]  And let me tell you
[1:27:13.020 --> 1:27:14.220]  Whether it's police chiefs
[1:27:14.220 --> 1:27:15.900]  Or members of Congress
[1:27:15.900 --> 1:27:17.740]  Or even folks in Hollywood
[1:27:17.740 --> 1:27:20.860]  Or mainstream media or industry
[1:27:20.860 --> 1:27:23.500]  People are really, really awake in the establishment
[1:27:24.220 --> 1:27:26.140]  They don't want to go on with the globalist
[1:27:26.140 --> 1:27:27.260]  But they're scared
[1:27:27.260 --> 1:27:28.940]  They're looking for leadership
[1:27:28.940 --> 1:27:30.940]  Well, that's where infowarst comes in

[1:28:47.980 --> 1:28:48.860]  It's evergreen
[1:28:48.860 --> 1:28:49.820]  It predicted it all

[1:29:19.740 --> 1:29:22.860]  There's the great show that we produce here
[1:29:22.860 --> 1:29:24.060]  Calls and guests and so much more
[1:29:24.060 --> 1:29:25.740]  Harrison Smith, American Journal
[1:29:26.540 --> 1:29:28.540]  And our guest, Norm Pattis, constitutional lawyer
[1:29:28.540 --> 1:29:30.540]  Or the top criminal lawyer in the country
[1:29:30.540 --> 1:29:31.260]  Was on yesterday
[1:29:31.260 --> 1:29:33.260]  The great job doing his closing arguments
[1:29:33.980 --> 1:29:36.220]  And then of course you got my show 11-3 Central
[1:29:36.220 --> 1:29:38.220]  And you got the War Room with the O and
[1:29:38.220 --> 1:29:39.980]  And that is 3-6 p.m. Central
[1:29:39.980 --> 1:29:40.940]  He'll be hosting today
[1:29:42.700 --> 1:29:44.220]  But I wanted to get Norm Pattis on
[1:29:44.220 --> 1:29:46.060]  Because he joined us live yesterday
[1:29:46.060 --> 1:29:47.740]  When I was co-hosting with Tom Bappert
[1:29:47.740 --> 1:29:51.020]  The social fourth hour today from nationalfollow.com
[1:29:52.220 --> 1:29:54.460]  On his 40 years as a lawyer or longer
[1:29:55.660 --> 1:29:56.540]  What he thought of this case
[1:29:56.540 --> 1:29:58.940]  He said this was the biggest miscarriage
[1:29:58.940 --> 1:30:00.860]  He's probably ever seen
[1:30:00.860 --> 1:30:02.940]  Maybe one other trial was at that level
[1:30:02.940 --> 1:30:03.580]  Because it doesn't
[1:30:03.580 --> 1:30:04.940]  I mean if Chauvin was guilty
[1:30:04.940 --> 1:30:06.540]  I'd say throw him in a gas chamber
[1:30:09.180 --> 1:30:10.460]  Electrocute him, you know, whatever
[1:30:10.460 --> 1:30:12.380]  See, you know, they used to have the actual gas chamber
[1:30:12.380 --> 1:30:13.260]  Where they killed folks
[1:30:13.260 --> 1:30:16.460]  But you can't have politicians saying
[1:30:16.460 --> 1:30:18.460]  You better convict them or burn down the country
[1:30:18.460 --> 1:30:21.260]  You can't have meddling in a trial like this
[1:30:21.260 --> 1:30:23.260]  You know, remember, you could move venues and things like that
[1:30:23.260 --> 1:30:28.060]  So his basic boil down of what unfolded yesterday
[1:30:28.060 --> 1:30:29.260]  What this does
[1:30:29.260 --> 1:30:31.260]  Why the Justice Department's pushing it
[1:30:31.260 --> 1:30:33.260]  The federal takeover of policing
[1:30:33.260 --> 1:30:35.260]  Which kills the federal system
[1:30:35.260 --> 1:30:37.260]  People think the federalist system means the feds run things
[1:30:37.260 --> 1:30:38.460]  No, it's the opposite
[1:30:38.460 --> 1:30:41.260]  Means there's a separation of powers and other check and balance
[1:30:41.260 --> 1:30:43.260]  So this is a very, very dark day
[1:30:43.260 --> 1:30:44.060]  It's the global agenda
[1:30:44.060 --> 1:30:46.060]  They run Hollywood, they run the media
[1:30:46.060 --> 1:30:48.460]  They run the big banks, they run academia
[1:30:48.460 --> 1:30:50.060]  They run almost every now
[1:30:50.060 --> 1:30:51.260]  They're going to run the police
[1:30:51.260 --> 1:30:55.260]  That's the real Apple and the authoritarian's eye
[1:30:55.260 --> 1:30:57.260]  Is second guessing everything the police do
[1:30:57.260 --> 1:30:59.260]  Not letting grand juries do it or even juries
[1:30:59.260 --> 1:31:02.060]  But having the feds as the garland
[1:31:02.060 --> 1:31:04.060]  The Justice Department has announced
[1:31:04.060 --> 1:31:06.060]  They're going to come in and take over the police departments
[1:31:06.060 --> 1:31:07.260]  Katie bar the door
[1:31:07.260 --> 1:31:10.060]  Because you never hear about the investigations of the feds
[1:31:10.060 --> 1:31:13.260]  Oh, because they check themselves
[1:31:13.260 --> 1:31:15.260]  How do the states then check the feds
[1:31:15.260 --> 1:31:17.260]  Well, that's juries but we're getting rid of those
[1:31:17.260 --> 1:31:19.260]  So thank you for joining us, Norm Pattis
[1:31:19.260 --> 1:31:22.060]  Give us your approximation of what we're witnessing
[1:31:22.060 --> 1:31:24.060]  You know, bad stuff
[1:31:24.060 --> 1:31:28.060]  I mean, Derek Chauvin was involved in the arrest
[1:31:28.060 --> 1:31:30.060]  And apprehension of George Floyd
[1:31:30.060 --> 1:31:32.060]  George Floyd died
[1:31:32.060 --> 1:31:34.060]  But for Chauvin arresting him, he might have lived
[1:31:34.060 --> 1:31:38.060]  But there were significant questions about causation of his death
[1:31:38.060 --> 1:31:40.060]  That is, Mr. Floyd's death
[1:31:40.060 --> 1:31:42.060]  I don't think Derek Chauvin murdered him
[1:31:42.060 --> 1:31:45.060]  I don't think Derek Chauvin engaged in manslaughter
[1:31:45.060 --> 1:31:48.060]  At most, he misjudged a tense
[1:31:48.060 --> 1:31:50.060]  Evolving an uncertain situation
[1:31:50.060 --> 1:31:52.060]  With a man who was intoxicated
[1:31:52.060 --> 1:31:54.060]  And seemingly out of his mind
[1:31:54.060 --> 1:31:56.060]  So what you're saying is negligence
[1:31:56.060 --> 1:31:58.060]  Yeah, and which was the second degree manslaughter account
[1:31:58.060 --> 1:32:00.060]  I mean, I worried about a compromise verdict
[1:32:00.060 --> 1:32:04.060]  I worried that Chauvin could not get a fair trial on that community
[1:32:04.060 --> 1:32:06.060]  And I think events bore that out
[1:32:06.060 --> 1:32:08.060]  I think there's a substantial likelihood
[1:32:08.060 --> 1:32:11.060]  In fact, I'll go so far as to predict here on the air with you
[1:32:11.060 --> 1:32:15.060]  That this case will undoubtedly be overturned on appeal
[1:32:15.060 --> 1:32:18.060]  Why? The trial court erred by not changing venue
[1:32:18.060 --> 1:32:20.060]  I've tried hundreds of cases
[1:32:20.060 --> 1:32:22.060]  Or will the appeals court be intimidated?
[1:32:22.060 --> 1:32:24.060]  Is this not new precedent being set?
[1:32:24.060 --> 1:32:26.060]  I sure hope not
[1:32:26.060 --> 1:32:30.060]  But you know, Alex, I can't think of a case since the Shepard case
[1:32:30.060 --> 1:32:33.060]  In 1954 that was quite this crazy
[1:32:33.060 --> 1:32:35.060]  Even O.J. Simpson's case
[1:32:35.060 --> 1:32:38.060]  In O.J.'s case, there were riots after the fact
[1:32:38.060 --> 1:32:41.060]  There weren't threats of riots beforehand
[1:32:41.060 --> 1:32:44.060]  If the verdict didn't come out the way one side wanted it
[1:32:44.060 --> 1:32:47.060]  But here's what we had in Chauvin's case
[1:32:47.060 --> 1:32:50.060]  You know, the death last summer
[1:32:50.060 --> 1:32:52.060]  Everyone goes to the streets
[1:32:52.060 --> 1:32:55.060]  They declare that this is an instance of systemic racism
[1:32:55.060 --> 1:32:57.060]  There's no evidence that this case was about race
[1:32:57.060 --> 1:33:00.060]  It was made about race by those with an agenda
[1:33:00.060 --> 1:33:02.060]  The city goes up in flames
[1:33:02.060 --> 1:33:05.060]  Tens of millions of dollars of property loss
[1:33:05.060 --> 1:33:08.060]  And now we're going a year later to select a jury
[1:33:08.060 --> 1:33:10.060]  And we expect them to be fair and impartial
[1:33:10.060 --> 1:33:13.060]  Those are the same jurors who were in the community last year
[1:33:13.060 --> 1:33:17.060]  When their city's fate was up for grabs
[1:33:17.060 --> 1:33:21.060]  Those are the same jurors who lived through the defund movement
[1:33:21.060 --> 1:33:24.060]  In the past year and saw the homicide rate in Minneapolis
[1:33:24.060 --> 1:33:26.060]  Go up three times
[1:33:26.060 --> 1:33:30.060]  Those presumably, and we know to a moral certainty
[1:33:30.060 --> 1:33:33.060]  That these were jurors who some of whom were already selected
[1:33:33.060 --> 1:33:35.060]  Somewhere in the process of being selected
[1:33:35.060 --> 1:33:39.060]  When the city of Minneapolis during jury selection
[1:33:39.060 --> 1:33:42.060]  Paid George Floyd's estate $27 million
[1:33:42.060 --> 1:33:44.060]  That alone should have been sufficient grounds
[1:33:44.060 --> 1:33:46.060]  To stop this trial dead in its tracks
[1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:49.060]  You don't pay the decedent of a man's family
[1:33:49.060 --> 1:33:52.060]  Who's working for the city and then expect to send a message
[1:33:52.060 --> 1:33:54.060]  Other than the fact that he was guilty
[1:33:54.060 --> 1:33:58.060]  Then during trial, jurors are coming through
[1:33:58.060 --> 1:34:02.060]  A crazy, immediate gauntlet of people outside the courthouse
[1:34:02.060 --> 1:34:05.060]  The courthouse is barricaded and made to look like
[1:34:05.060 --> 1:34:07.060]  It's part of a war zone
[1:34:07.060 --> 1:34:10.060]  As of deliberations approached rather
[1:34:10.060 --> 1:34:12.060]  The storefronts near the courthouse were boarded up
[1:34:12.060 --> 1:34:15.060]  What's the message that jury's going to get?
[1:34:15.060 --> 1:34:17.060]  And then after the evidence closed
[1:34:17.060 --> 1:34:19.060]  But before closing arguments made
[1:34:19.060 --> 1:34:23.060]  Mean Maxine waters jets in from Washington
[1:34:23.060 --> 1:34:26.060]  To say unless we hear guilty, guilty, guilty
[1:34:26.060 --> 1:34:28.060]  We're going to double down so that they hear
[1:34:28.060 --> 1:34:30.060]  What we have to say
[1:34:30.060 --> 1:34:33.060]  Those jurors undoubtedly were exposed
[1:34:33.060 --> 1:34:36.060]  To an atmosphere of intimidation and fear
[1:34:36.060 --> 1:34:39.060]  And I think this verdict should be thrown out
[1:34:39.060 --> 1:34:42.060]  The case should have been tried in a different community
[1:34:42.060 --> 1:34:44.060]  At a different time
[1:34:44.060 --> 1:34:46.060]  Obviously the community has an interest
[1:34:46.060 --> 1:34:48.060]  In the Chauvin verdict
[1:34:48.060 --> 1:34:50.060]  And in having the case tried there
[1:34:50.060 --> 1:34:52.060]  But Chauvin had a more fundamental interest
[1:34:52.060 --> 1:34:55.060]  He had a fundamental right to a fair trial
[1:34:55.060 --> 1:34:57.060]  In my view it was undermined
[1:34:57.060 --> 1:35:00.060]  And this was more like mob justice
[1:35:00.060 --> 1:35:02.060]  Than it was the calm deliberation
[1:35:02.060 --> 1:35:04.060]  You would expect of a jury
[1:35:04.060 --> 1:35:06.060]  And then today I pick up the newspaper
[1:35:06.060 --> 1:35:08.060]  And what do I see?
[1:35:08.060 --> 1:35:11.060]  This is the first chapter in racial reckoning
[1:35:11.060 --> 1:35:13.060]  What comes next? This was not a race case
[1:35:13.060 --> 1:35:16.060]  People wake up and smell the coffee
[1:35:16.060 --> 1:35:19.060]  George Floyd was a suspect in passing
[1:35:19.060 --> 1:35:21.060]  A counterfeit $20 bill
[1:35:21.060 --> 1:35:23.060]  Police came to investigate
[1:35:23.060 --> 1:35:25.060]  He resisted their efforts to question him
[1:35:25.060 --> 1:35:27.060]  He behaved objectively
[1:35:27.060 --> 1:35:29.060]  In an irrational and crazy manner
[1:35:29.060 --> 1:35:32.060]  Officers used reasonable force to subdue him
[1:35:32.060 --> 1:35:34.060]  And in the end he died
[1:35:34.060 --> 1:35:36.060]  And if Chauvin is to be faulted for anything
[1:35:36.060 --> 1:35:38.060]  It may be that he should have placed him on his side
[1:35:38.060 --> 1:35:40.060]  It may be that he needs better training
[1:35:40.060 --> 1:35:42.060]  As do all police officers
[1:35:42.060 --> 1:35:44.060]  And how to deal with men in these circumstances
[1:35:44.060 --> 1:35:47.060]  But to take this case and to use it
[1:35:47.060 --> 1:35:50.060]  To cynically use the memory of George Floyd
[1:35:50.060 --> 1:35:53.060]  As a brick bat in an ongoing and seemingly
[1:35:53.060 --> 1:35:56.060]  Endless set of racial confrontations
[1:35:56.060 --> 1:35:59.060]  That only benefit certain provocateurs
[1:35:59.060 --> 1:36:01.060]  And there is not unanimity in the black community
[1:36:01.060 --> 1:36:03.060]  By the way about whether this is necessary
[1:36:03.060 --> 1:36:06.060]  To do that is simply irresponsible
[1:36:06.060 --> 1:36:09.060]  And the people who will suffer most
[1:36:09.060 --> 1:36:11.060]  From this defund the police and hostility to police
[1:36:11.060 --> 1:36:13.060]  Are people who need police most
[1:36:13.060 --> 1:36:15.060]  In distressed communities
[1:36:15.060 --> 1:36:17.060]  And largely in communities of color
[1:36:17.060 --> 1:36:21.060]  I have many clients who are law enforcement officers
[1:36:21.060 --> 1:36:23.060]  I speak to a lot of police chiefs on a regular basis
[1:36:23.060 --> 1:36:25.060]  I'm up in New England here in Connecticut
[1:36:25.060 --> 1:36:27.060]  It's a very small state
[1:36:27.060 --> 1:36:30.060]  169 towns you get to know everybody pretty quickly
[1:36:30.060 --> 1:36:33.060]  People are afraid to do their job
[1:36:33.060 --> 1:36:36.060]  Officers are talking about catch and release law enforcement
[1:36:36.060 --> 1:36:39.060]  If they get a call they're not likely to respond aggressively
[1:36:39.060 --> 1:36:41.060]  They're not likely to respond proactively
[1:36:41.060 --> 1:36:44.060]  If there's any risk that they too could be sued
[1:36:44.060 --> 1:36:47.060]  And the Democrats at the same time want our guns
[1:36:47.060 --> 1:36:49.060]  You used to be pro gun control
[1:36:49.060 --> 1:36:51.060]  You were telling me actually on the war room
[1:36:51.060 --> 1:36:54.060]  Until you realized no they're not going to give us support
[1:36:54.060 --> 1:36:56.060]  The police have no responsibility to protect us
[1:36:56.060 --> 1:36:58.060]  But we can't protect ourselves
[1:36:58.060 --> 1:37:00.060]  But the politicians all have bodyguards basically
[1:37:00.060 --> 1:37:02.060]  Absolutely you're going to defund the police
[1:37:02.060 --> 1:37:04.060]  And tell me turn my firearms in
[1:37:04.060 --> 1:37:07.060]  Why so that you can have a fire sale in my home
[1:37:07.060 --> 1:37:09.060]  Somebody can knock on the door and decide
[1:37:09.060 --> 1:37:11.060]  In the name of racial equity
[1:37:11.060 --> 1:37:13.060]  They want some of what I got
[1:37:13.060 --> 1:37:15.060]  It ain't happening
[1:37:15.060 --> 1:37:17.060]  And we already have the blue flu in Chicago and other places
[1:37:17.060 --> 1:37:20.060]  Where 95% of blacks are killed by blacks
[1:37:20.060 --> 1:37:23.060]  And it's getting worse it's actually terrible I hate it
[1:37:23.060 --> 1:37:26.060]  But when a white person kills a black person it's a huge deal
[1:37:26.060 --> 1:37:29.060]  When a black person kills a bunch of black people
[1:37:29.060 --> 1:37:31.060]  The media covers it up
[1:37:31.060 --> 1:37:34.060]  The media is simply not telling you the truth in this case
[1:37:34.060 --> 1:37:37.060]  There are about a thousand police shootings per year
[1:37:37.060 --> 1:37:39.060]  In the United States
[1:37:39.060 --> 1:37:42.060]  More white people are shot per year than are black
[1:37:42.060 --> 1:37:45.060]  Obviously blacks are a small percentage of the population
[1:37:45.060 --> 1:37:47.060]  Population adjusted
[1:37:47.060 --> 1:37:50.060]  The likelihood of you being shot by a cop is greater if you're black
[1:37:50.060 --> 1:37:53.060]  But in both cases you're more likely to be struck by lightning
[1:37:53.060 --> 1:37:55.060]  Than you are to be shot by a police dog
[1:37:55.060 --> 1:37:57.060]  Exactly when they make it the number one issue in the US
[1:37:57.060 --> 1:38:00.060]  It's a distraction from the political gutting of this country
[1:38:00.060 --> 1:38:03.060]  It is I mean you know big tech is taken over
[1:38:03.060 --> 1:38:06.060]  We're losing the right to learn what we need to learn
[1:38:06.060 --> 1:38:09.060]  To make the decisions we want to make in our own community
[1:38:09.060 --> 1:38:12.060]  Carefully to you Alex I work from the bottom up
[1:38:12.060 --> 1:38:14.060]  I see ordinary people in struggles I go to court
[1:38:14.060 --> 1:38:16.060]  You work from the top down
[1:38:16.060 --> 1:38:18.060]  And I sometimes wonder what you're talking about globalism
[1:38:18.060 --> 1:38:20.060]  I think I'm starting to get it
[1:38:20.060 --> 1:38:22.060]  I think I'm starting to see that there is a movement in the world
[1:38:22.060 --> 1:38:24.060]  To deprive communities of local control
[1:38:24.060 --> 1:38:27.060]  And to have the agendas the rules by which we live
[1:38:27.060 --> 1:38:29.060]  Set by people that aren't accountable to us
[1:38:29.060 --> 1:38:32.060]  Who engage in processes that are opaque that we can't understand
[1:38:32.060 --> 1:38:36.060]  Is it any wonder that there's a spike in violence in the country
[1:38:36.060 --> 1:38:39.060]  People are angry and pissed off because we've been taught
[1:38:39.060 --> 1:38:41.060]  That we the people are sovereign
[1:38:41.060 --> 1:38:43.060]  But big tech is saying only when we want you to be
[1:38:43.060 --> 1:38:45.060]  And I'm not buying it
[1:38:45.060 --> 1:38:47.060]  I don't want any violence against big tech
[1:38:47.060 --> 1:38:49.060]  But big tech needs to be sued
[1:38:49.060 --> 1:38:51.060]  They're the enemy I know you're not
[1:38:51.060 --> 1:38:53.060]  Let's come back and talk about solutions with Norm Pattis
[1:38:53.060 --> 1:38:54.060]  Stay with us
[1:38:54.060 --> 1:38:56.060]  Again I don't like to lecture people
[1:38:56.060 --> 1:38:58.060]  I'm a very private person
[1:38:58.060 --> 1:39:00.060]  But because of the globalists and their attack on humanity
[1:39:00.060 --> 1:39:03.060]  I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure
[1:39:03.060 --> 1:39:06.060]  And we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money
[1:39:06.060 --> 1:39:07.060]  Because of God
[1:39:07.060 --> 1:39:11.060]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day
[1:39:11.060 --> 1:39:12.060]  But just give me a break
[1:39:12.060 --> 1:39:13.060]  The Satanism's out in the open
[1:39:13.060 --> 1:39:14.060]  I've always been a Christian
[1:39:14.060 --> 1:39:18.060]  But now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear
[1:39:18.060 --> 1:39:19.060]  And I get it
[1:39:19.060 --> 1:39:21.060]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches
[1:39:21.060 --> 1:39:24.060]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system
[1:39:24.060 --> 1:39:26.060]  And I get it, me too
[1:39:26.060 --> 1:39:27.060]  Believe me, I'm one of them
[1:39:27.060 --> 1:39:29.060]  But it's that relationship with God
[1:39:29.060 --> 1:39:32.060]  And just God's universe that God created
[1:39:32.060 --> 1:39:33.060]  That is so essential
[1:39:33.060 --> 1:39:37.060]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God through
[1:39:37.060 --> 1:39:38.060]  And to have life
[1:39:38.060 --> 1:39:40.060]  And so that's what InfoWars is really all about
[1:39:40.060 --> 1:39:42.060]  So thank you all for your word of mouth

[1:41:00.060 --> 1:41:02.060]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right
[1:41:02.060 --> 1:41:04.060]  Thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead
[1:41:04.060 --> 1:41:07.060]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products
[1:41:07.060 --> 1:41:11.060]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there
[1:41:11.060 --> 1:41:14.060]  That may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me
[1:41:14.060 --> 1:41:18.060]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called
[1:41:18.060 --> 1:41:21.060]  Taking your X2 for the last couple of years
[1:41:21.060 --> 1:41:23.060]  My skin is just really gorgeous, actually
[1:41:23.060 --> 1:41:26.060]  People think I'm 55 years old
[1:41:26.060 --> 1:41:29.060]  And I was already taking your other supplements
[1:41:29.060 --> 1:41:32.060]  But I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[1:41:32.060 --> 1:41:34.060]  Because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[1:41:34.060 --> 1:41:37.060]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately
[1:41:37.060 --> 1:41:40.060]  But, you know, over a period of time
[1:41:40.060 --> 1:41:43.060]  I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket
[1:41:43.060 --> 1:41:45.060]  This is working, this is wonderful, you know
[1:41:45.060 --> 1:41:49.060]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know
[1:41:49.060 --> 1:41:51.060]  So, anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:41:51.060 --> 1:42:16.060]  And it really has totally cleared up my skin
[1:42:16.060 --> 1:42:21.060]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made
[1:42:21.060 --> 1:42:24.060]  Fourteen years ago, we tracked and documented the Bilderberg Group's activities
[1:42:24.060 --> 1:42:28.060]  And they're planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus
[1:42:28.060 --> 1:42:30.060]  The film now is more important than ever
[1:42:30.060 --> 1:42:32.060]  When it's shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it
[1:42:32.060 --> 1:42:34.060]  We have it back in print, available now
[1:42:34.060 --> 1:42:36.060]  At InfowarsStore.com
[1:42:36.060 --> 1:42:38.060]  Selling them as low as $3.95 a piece
[1:42:38.060 --> 1:42:41.060]  We buy them in bulk and there's a zero country code
[1:42:41.060 --> 1:42:43.060]  So anywhere on the planet, you can make copies
[1:42:43.060 --> 1:42:44.060]  In fact, I want you to make copies
[1:42:44.060 --> 1:42:46.060]  You are the Palmer Beers, 1776 worldwide
[1:42:46.060 --> 1:42:48.060]  1776 worldwide
[1:42:48.060 --> 1:42:50.060]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement
[1:42:50.060 --> 1:42:52.060]  Available now at InfowarsStore.com
[1:42:52.060 --> 1:43:18.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:43:18.060 --> 1:43:28.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:43:28.060 --> 1:43:33.060]  He's a very, very famous founder of the Black Panther Party
[1:43:33.060 --> 1:43:35.060]  And he's like Martin Luther King
[1:43:35.060 --> 1:43:36.060]  He's the opposite of a racist
[1:43:36.060 --> 1:43:37.060]  He's a great guy, I love him
[1:43:37.060 --> 1:43:38.060]  He's been here several times
[1:43:38.060 --> 1:43:39.060]  He takes care of family
[1:43:39.060 --> 1:43:41.060]  He came and come down here and see us where he lives
[1:43:41.060 --> 1:43:42.060]  He's joining us next hour
[1:43:42.060 --> 1:43:47.060]  If we take some calls about 15 minutes to the next hour
[1:43:47.060 --> 1:43:49.060]  You know, he's come out against race war
[1:43:49.060 --> 1:43:51.060]  So they just banned him on Twitter
[1:43:51.060 --> 1:43:53.060]  And he wrote books
[1:43:53.060 --> 1:43:55.060]  He's one of the admitted founding members of it
[1:43:55.060 --> 1:43:57.060]  Just like Breonna Taylor's mother said
[1:43:57.060 --> 1:43:59.060]  Black Lives Matter is a race war group
[1:43:59.060 --> 1:44:01.060]  And using her daughter
[1:44:01.060 --> 1:44:03.060]  Well, she just got blocked on Facebook
[1:44:03.060 --> 1:44:06.060]  These big tech companies are using black people
[1:44:06.060 --> 1:44:08.060]  So it's easy to get mad at black people
[1:44:08.060 --> 1:44:11.060]  And they're being beset by a mob of racist black people
[1:44:11.060 --> 1:44:12.060]  Like the KKK
[1:44:12.060 --> 1:44:13.060]  You know, the KKK thought they were doing good
[1:44:13.060 --> 1:44:15.060]  Well, so does Black Lives Matter
[1:44:15.060 --> 1:44:17.060]  If you go to a restaurant, smash your table up
[1:44:17.060 --> 1:44:18.060]  Because you're white
[1:44:18.060 --> 1:44:19.060]  They are KKK
[1:44:19.060 --> 1:44:20.060]  But I don't hate black people
[1:44:20.060 --> 1:44:22.060]  Because they're acting like the KKK
[1:44:22.060 --> 1:44:24.060]  I don't hate white people because there's KKK
[1:44:24.060 --> 1:44:26.060]  But how do we counter this norm?
[1:44:26.060 --> 1:44:28.060]  Where is this going?
[1:44:28.060 --> 1:44:30.060]  Because if you even criticize Black Lives Matter now
[1:44:30.060 --> 1:44:32.060]  I've seen the media say you're a racist
[1:44:32.060 --> 1:44:33.060]  And you're a famous liberal lawyer
[1:44:33.060 --> 1:44:35.060]  For saying, no, I'm not bad because I'm white
[1:44:35.060 --> 1:44:37.060]  That is so fundamentally
[1:44:37.060 --> 1:44:40.060]  The opposite of the common sense Martin Luther King said
[1:44:40.060 --> 1:44:41.060]  Martin Luther King did invent that
[1:44:41.060 --> 1:44:42.060]  He was a great speaker
[1:44:42.060 --> 1:44:43.060]  He put it out and said
[1:44:43.060 --> 1:44:45.060]  We don't judge people of what color they are
[1:44:45.060 --> 1:44:47.060]  But off the character of their deeds
[1:44:47.060 --> 1:44:48.060]  The content of who they are
[1:44:48.060 --> 1:44:49.060]  Well, everybody knows that
[1:44:49.060 --> 1:44:51.060]  I go get a suit because it's a good tailor
[1:44:51.060 --> 1:44:52.060]  I go eat food because it's good food
[1:44:52.060 --> 1:44:54.060]  I go watch a movie because it's a good director
[1:44:54.060 --> 1:44:55.060]  I don't care if they're Mexican
[1:44:55.060 --> 1:44:57.060]  Or if they're African
[1:44:57.060 --> 1:44:58.060]  Or if they're German
[1:44:58.060 --> 1:45:01.060]  I go because it's good and we know it's good
[1:45:01.060 --> 1:45:02.060]  That's common sense
[1:45:02.060 --> 1:45:04.060]  This idea that we're bad because of what color we are
[1:45:04.060 --> 1:45:07.060]  How the hell is the corporate media getting away with this?
[1:45:07.060 --> 1:45:08.060]  I don't
[1:45:08.060 --> 1:45:09.060]  Because we let them
[1:45:09.060 --> 1:45:11.060]  Because we continue to patronize them
[1:45:11.060 --> 1:45:13.060]  Because we continue to be entertainment, wage
[1:45:13.060 --> 1:45:15.060]  And otherwise slaves ourselves
[1:45:15.060 --> 1:45:18.060]  You know, I'm going to take a risk here, Alex
[1:45:18.060 --> 1:45:20.060]  I'm not sure we ever talked about it
[1:45:20.060 --> 1:45:22.060]  But I'm going to recommend to your readers
[1:45:22.060 --> 1:45:25.060]  That they pick up a copy of St. Augustine's Confessions
[1:45:25.060 --> 1:45:28.060]  And I'm recommending the Sarah Rudin edition
[1:45:28.060 --> 1:45:29.060]  It's right there on the screen
[1:45:29.060 --> 1:45:32.060]  Let me read you just a couple lines that are bracing
[1:45:32.060 --> 1:45:34.060]  And you talk a lot about God on your show
[1:45:34.060 --> 1:45:37.060]  Very first, second paragraph of Augustine's books
[1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:40.060]  Our heart is restless until it rests in you
[1:45:40.060 --> 1:45:42.060]  Will anyone emerge, he writes later
[1:45:42.060 --> 1:45:45.060]  As the craftsman who makes himself
[1:45:45.060 --> 1:45:47.060]  He concludes the chapter
[1:45:47.060 --> 1:45:51.060]  I turned myself into a famished land I had lived in
[1:45:51.060 --> 1:45:54.060]  I started to read Augustine about a year ago
[1:45:54.060 --> 1:45:55.060]  Again, reread him
[1:45:55.060 --> 1:45:56.060]  He was a preoccupation
[1:45:56.060 --> 1:45:58.060]  Read more of it, we love it, read more
[1:45:58.060 --> 1:46:02.060]  You know, I mean, well, those are the pieces I took
[1:46:02.060 --> 1:46:04.060]  You'll have to get me back and I'll be happy to do so
[1:46:04.060 --> 1:46:06.060]  But here was Augustine's point
[1:46:06.060 --> 1:46:08.060]  And that is none of us makes ourselves
[1:46:08.060 --> 1:46:11.060]  We all find ourselves in a world as...
[1:46:11.060 --> 1:46:14.060]  Churchill said that most great men were not great
[1:46:14.060 --> 1:46:16.060]  Until the times they were in
[1:46:16.060 --> 1:46:18.060]  The times make you
[1:46:18.060 --> 1:46:21.060]  And even those of us who aren't great
[1:46:21.060 --> 1:46:23.060]  We had to learn to walk
[1:46:23.060 --> 1:46:24.060]  We had to be fed
[1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:26.060]  We were dependent upon the love of others
[1:46:26.060 --> 1:46:29.060]  And I think Augustine's great teaching is that
[1:46:29.060 --> 1:46:31.060]  If we learn to be dependent on the love of God
[1:46:31.060 --> 1:46:33.060]  If we learn to accept grace
[1:46:33.060 --> 1:46:36.060]  And we learn to behave with humility toward one another
[1:46:36.060 --> 1:46:38.060]  And to see the good in one another
[1:46:38.060 --> 1:46:40.060]  And the evil in ourselves
[1:46:40.060 --> 1:46:43.060]  And we resist the temptation to try to recreate the world
[1:46:43.060 --> 1:46:44.060]  In our own image
[1:46:44.060 --> 1:46:47.060]  Which is the very function of identity politics
[1:46:47.060 --> 1:46:49.060]  If we can come together and unite
[1:46:49.060 --> 1:46:51.060]  On a common conception of values
[1:46:51.060 --> 1:46:53.060]  And a common sense of gratitude toward the great powers
[1:46:53.060 --> 1:46:55.060]  That made this universe
[1:46:55.060 --> 1:46:57.060]  You know, I think there's hope
[1:46:57.060 --> 1:46:58.060]  But if we...
[1:46:58.060 --> 1:46:59.060]  Well, you just said it
[1:46:59.060 --> 1:47:01.060]  Only by recognizing God can we be unified
[1:47:01.060 --> 1:47:03.060]  It's all the people playing God
[1:47:03.060 --> 1:47:05.060]  Is what's destroying us
[1:47:05.060 --> 1:47:07.060]  I think the church can save us
[1:47:07.060 --> 1:47:10.060]  You know, I recently reconciled with the Catholic church
[1:47:10.060 --> 1:47:13.060]  Because I thought that there was nowhere else to go
[1:47:13.060 --> 1:47:16.060]  The world was a barren wilderness of identity
[1:47:16.060 --> 1:47:18.060]  Now, do the priests have their issues?
[1:47:18.060 --> 1:47:20.060]  Friends of mine are like, well, cover your rear end
[1:47:20.060 --> 1:47:21.060]  When you go into church
[1:47:21.060 --> 1:47:23.060]  Look what the priests might do
[1:47:23.060 --> 1:47:26.060]  Is that so different than what's going on anywhere else?
[1:47:26.060 --> 1:47:28.060]  I mean, we're now in a position
[1:47:28.060 --> 1:47:29.060]  I talked about yesterday
[1:47:29.060 --> 1:47:31.060]  Where we're letting seven-year-old children decide
[1:47:31.060 --> 1:47:32.060]  What gender they want to be
[1:47:32.060 --> 1:47:35.060]  We're in open revolt against the conditions of nature
[1:47:35.060 --> 1:47:38.060]  We're in open revolt against the obvious truth
[1:47:38.060 --> 1:47:41.060]  That we are objects that did not create ourselves
[1:47:41.060 --> 1:47:43.060]  Now, if you're at mere evolution...
[1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:44.060]  But you're right
[1:47:44.060 --> 1:47:45.060]  It's the search for God
[1:47:45.060 --> 1:47:46.060]  That is the discovery of God
[1:47:46.060 --> 1:47:48.060]  Is the communion with God
[1:47:48.060 --> 1:47:50.060]  So it doesn't matter the venue or where it is
[1:47:50.060 --> 1:47:51.060]  God sees through all that
[1:47:51.060 --> 1:47:53.060]  It's the reaching up to God
[1:47:53.060 --> 1:47:55.060]  That God's looking for
[1:47:55.060 --> 1:47:56.060]  Well, maybe
[1:47:56.060 --> 1:47:58.060]  I'm not going to pretend to play a theologian
[1:47:58.060 --> 1:47:59.060]  In my gigs here with you
[1:47:59.060 --> 1:48:01.060]  All I'm saying is that I go to court every day
[1:48:01.060 --> 1:48:04.060]  And I see the fights that bring out the best
[1:48:04.060 --> 1:48:05.060]  And the worst in people
[1:48:05.060 --> 1:48:07.060]  And I look at what's going on in the country
[1:48:07.060 --> 1:48:09.060]  And I think we're becoming...
[1:48:09.060 --> 1:48:12.060]  We're going down a sinkhole of self-gratification
[1:48:12.060 --> 1:48:14.060]  A sinkhole of self-indulgence
[1:48:14.060 --> 1:48:16.060]  And what made this country great
[1:48:16.060 --> 1:48:18.060]  The heritage that we draw from
[1:48:18.060 --> 1:48:21.060]  Are centuries of the Judeo-Christian tradition
[1:48:21.060 --> 1:48:24.060]  Whether it be a Jewish synagogue
[1:48:24.060 --> 1:48:26.060]  A Catholic church, a Baptist preacher
[1:48:26.060 --> 1:48:28.060]  Who reads the Bible seriously anymore
[1:48:28.060 --> 1:48:30.060]  Who reads the classics seriously anymore
[1:48:30.060 --> 1:48:32.060]  I don't know if you saw the piece
[1:48:32.060 --> 1:48:34.060]  Howard University is banning the great books
[1:48:34.060 --> 1:48:36.060]  And no better leftist than...
[1:48:36.060 --> 1:48:38.060]  Well, there's a direct assault on the classics
[1:48:38.060 --> 1:48:40.060]  Because they're so powerful
[1:48:40.060 --> 1:48:42.060]  And because they speak of enduring truths
[1:48:42.060 --> 1:48:44.060]  Where people didn't use their identity
[1:48:44.060 --> 1:48:46.060]  To get ahead in the grocery line
[1:48:46.060 --> 1:48:48.060]  You know, I mean, it took centuries
[1:48:48.060 --> 1:48:51.060]  To build the moral capital that we're eating from
[1:48:51.060 --> 1:48:54.060]  Exactly, it took thousands of years to build
[1:48:54.060 --> 1:48:56.060]  What the crop we're living on
[1:48:56.060 --> 1:48:58.060]  And now we've eaten it down to the ground
[1:48:58.060 --> 1:49:00.060]  It's about the end
[1:49:00.060 --> 1:49:02.060]  It feels that way to me
[1:49:02.060 --> 1:49:04.060]  And I don't know what happens next
[1:49:04.060 --> 1:49:06.060]  I sometimes think in this country
[1:49:06.060 --> 1:49:08.060]  That we're a foreign policy crisis away from collapse
[1:49:08.060 --> 1:49:11.060]  We're so embittered with respect to one another
[1:49:11.060 --> 1:49:13.060]  And we can't unite about anything
[1:49:13.060 --> 1:49:15.060]  Exactly, we're 4% of the world population
[1:49:15.060 --> 1:49:18.060]  And the average American has the lowest level of passports
[1:49:18.060 --> 1:49:20.060]  The lowest level of travel
[1:49:20.060 --> 1:49:22.060]  They literally believe that we are it
[1:49:22.060 --> 1:49:24.060]  They have no idea what we're surrounded by
[1:49:24.060 --> 1:49:26.060]  And it takes little to divide us
[1:49:26.060 --> 1:49:28.060]  And to get us to tear at one another
[1:49:28.060 --> 1:49:30.060]  What are we going to do when we have our next foreign
[1:49:30.060 --> 1:49:32.060]  Policy crisis? Are we going to be able to
[1:49:32.060 --> 1:49:34.060]  Summon a common will and a common identity?
[1:49:34.060 --> 1:49:36.060]  We're in our foreign policy crisis
[1:49:36.060 --> 1:49:38.060]  The CHICOMZ own Hollywood, they're funding all this race for
[1:49:38.060 --> 1:49:40.060]  This is their plan
[1:49:40.060 --> 1:49:42.060]  Norm Patis, thank you so much for the time

[1:49:50.060 --> 1:49:52.060]  But I've got a few things to say
[1:49:52.060 --> 1:49:54.060]  No, I'm not a fast talker
[1:49:54.060 --> 1:49:56.060]  No, I didn't mean it that way
[1:49:56.060 --> 1:49:58.060]  I know what you mean, it sounds like I talk fast
[1:49:58.060 --> 1:50:00.060]  I actually talk slow in person, I just
[1:50:00.060 --> 1:50:02.060]  No, I don't think that's, I am a fast talker
[1:50:02.060 --> 1:50:04.060]  I got my brains moving, we love you
[1:50:04.060 --> 1:50:06.060]  Alright folks, listen, I know I gave the number out

[1:51:16.060 --> 1:51:18.060]  In the great state of Illinois
[1:51:18.060 --> 1:51:20.060]  You're on the air
[1:51:20.060 --> 1:51:22.060]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[1:51:22.060 --> 1:51:24.060]  Calling from the communist state of Illinois
[1:51:24.060 --> 1:51:26.060]  Welcome
[1:51:26.060 --> 1:51:28.060]  Long time listener, I just want to say
[1:51:28.060 --> 1:51:30.060]  Thank you for the work you've been doing
[1:51:30.060 --> 1:51:32.060]  We all appreciate it
[1:51:32.060 --> 1:51:34.060]  My family loves you, my daughter's a big fan of yours
[1:51:34.060 --> 1:51:36.060]  And we order the
[1:51:36.060 --> 1:51:38.060]  Privacy Pouch, the thing works like a charm
[1:51:38.060 --> 1:51:40.060]  My daughter loves it, I'm going to be ordering a few more
[1:51:40.060 --> 1:51:42.060]  From your site
[1:51:42.060 --> 1:51:44.060]  Thank you for those that don't know, it's just a little pouch
[1:51:44.060 --> 1:51:46.060]  That walks out the cell tower
[1:51:46.060 --> 1:51:48.060]  And it's good to just get in the mode of knowing
[1:51:48.060 --> 1:51:50.060]  You're being tracked, now you've got anything wrong
[1:51:50.060 --> 1:51:52.060]  The bad guys are tracking you
[1:51:52.060 --> 1:51:54.060]  Okay, so
[1:51:54.060 --> 1:51:56.060]  What I'm calling about
[1:51:56.060 --> 1:51:58.060]  Is this whole race for agenda
[1:51:58.060 --> 1:52:00.060]  That the media, the corporate media, social media
[1:52:00.060 --> 1:52:02.060]  Is pushing
[1:52:02.060 --> 1:52:04.060]  I think anyone with half a brain
[1:52:04.060 --> 1:52:06.060]  Can see what's going on here
[1:52:06.060 --> 1:52:08.060]  They're pulling, they're pushing
[1:52:08.060 --> 1:52:10.060]  For a full-on assault against
[1:52:10.060 --> 1:52:12.060]  White people in general
[1:52:12.060 --> 1:52:14.060]  I work at a
[1:52:14.060 --> 1:52:16.060]  You know, I work in the education field
[1:52:16.060 --> 1:52:18.060]  And there's a small population of us that are conservatives
[1:52:18.060 --> 1:52:20.060]  Here, that kind of have to meet together
[1:52:20.060 --> 1:52:22.060]  In secret to talk about
[1:52:22.060 --> 1:52:24.060]  What's going on here, because we see what's going on
[1:52:24.060 --> 1:52:26.060]  But the majority of other people here
[1:52:26.060 --> 1:52:28.060]  Don't
[1:52:28.060 --> 1:52:30.060]  And think about that, meeting in secret in America
[1:52:34.060 --> 1:52:36.060]  And another thing
[1:52:36.060 --> 1:52:38.060]  I used to live
[1:52:38.060 --> 1:52:40.060]  In the suburbs of Chicago
[1:52:40.060 --> 1:52:42.060]  All my life I was born and raised here
[1:52:42.060 --> 1:52:44.060]  Just recently moved after the Biden election
[1:52:44.060 --> 1:52:46.060]  I moved far west out into the country
[1:52:46.060 --> 1:52:48.060]  Into the Republican county
[1:52:48.060 --> 1:52:50.060]  Because pretty much all of Chicago
[1:52:50.060 --> 1:52:52.060]  And all of Chicago land area
[1:52:52.060 --> 1:52:54.060]  Is NWO territory
[1:52:54.060 --> 1:52:56.060]  So when they do kick off
[1:52:56.060 --> 1:52:58.060]  The takeover and the race wars
[1:52:58.060 --> 1:53:00.060]  That whole area
[1:53:00.060 --> 1:53:02.060]  Is going to be affected
[1:53:02.060 --> 1:53:04.060]  It's all liberal, democratic, controlled area
[1:53:04.060 --> 1:53:06.060]  And
[1:53:06.060 --> 1:53:08.060]  Those people are going to be
[1:53:08.060 --> 1:53:10.060]  In a world of hurt once everything goes down
[1:53:10.060 --> 1:53:12.060]  I agree
[1:53:12.060 --> 1:53:14.060]  People go, why would they collapse their own system
[1:53:14.060 --> 1:53:16.060]  Because it's a chain reaction
[1:53:16.060 --> 1:53:18.060]  It's a war, it's about conquering
[1:53:18.060 --> 1:53:20.060]  And there's the will to power
[1:53:20.060 --> 1:53:22.060]  So a good person goes, why would you do that
[1:53:22.060 --> 1:53:24.060]  Well, that's because you're not an evil person
[1:53:24.060 --> 1:53:26.060]  God bless you brother, thanks for the call
[1:53:26.060 --> 1:53:28.060]  I've been really appreciate you holding
[1:53:28.060 --> 1:53:30.060]  All right, Ben and others
[1:53:30.060 --> 1:53:32.060]  We will return in T-minus two minutes
[1:53:32.060 --> 1:53:34.060]  With the third hour
[1:53:34.060 --> 1:53:36.060]  Take a few segments of calls and then
[1:53:36.060 --> 1:53:38.060]  Larry Pinkney, an original
[1:53:38.060 --> 1:53:40.060]  Party member will join us
[1:53:40.060 --> 1:53:42.060]  Stay with us, hour number three
[1:53:44.060 --> 1:53:46.060]  The world is awakening
[1:53:46.060 --> 1:53:48.060]  The world
[1:53:48.060 --> 1:53:50.060]  Is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm
[1:53:50.060 --> 1:53:52.060]  They are discovering the globalist
[1:53:52.060 --> 1:53:54.060]  The elites, the manipulation
[1:53:54.060 --> 1:53:56.060]  The CFR, the trilateral commission
[1:53:56.060 --> 1:53:58.060]  The Bilderberg group, the bohemian grove
[1:53:58.060 --> 1:54:00.060]  The club of Rome
[1:54:00.060 --> 1:54:02.060]  And so
[1:54:02.060 --> 1:54:04.060]  Even though it seems like the globalists are winning
[1:54:04.060 --> 1:54:06.060]  The truth is
[1:54:06.060 --> 1:54:08.060]  They've had to come out in the open
[1:54:08.060 --> 1:54:10.060]  To attack human freedom
[1:54:10.060 --> 1:54:12.060]  Because they're actually losing
[1:54:12.060 --> 1:54:14.060]  We have forced them out in the open
[1:54:14.060 --> 1:54:16.060]  So as bad as these times are
[1:54:16.060 --> 1:54:18.060]  A lot of negative things are about to happen
[1:54:18.060 --> 1:54:20.060]  Realize, humanity is winning
[1:54:20.060 --> 1:54:22.060]  You've got to trust in the plan of God
[1:54:22.060 --> 1:54:24.060]  And trust in the plan of God's justice
[1:54:24.060 --> 1:54:26.060]  That is invincible
[1:54:26.060 --> 1:54:28.060]  That is ethereal
[1:54:28.060 --> 1:54:30.060]  Timeless and unstoppable
[1:54:30.060 --> 1:54:32.060]  So don't trust in man
[1:54:32.060 --> 1:54:34.060]  Trust in God to lead God and direct your soul
[1:54:34.060 --> 1:54:36.060]  And then take action against the globalists
[1:54:36.060 --> 1:54:38.060]  And realize, you've got my commitment
[1:54:38.060 --> 1:54:40.060]  From Alex Jones and my crew to you
[1:54:40.060 --> 1:54:42.060]  We will never back down from the globalists
[1:54:42.060 --> 1:55:04.060]  And we will never surrender
[1:55:12.060 --> 1:55:14.060]  And follow that link
[1:55:14.060 --> 1:55:16.060]  You get all their services
[1:55:16.060 --> 1:55:18.060]  At the lowest price
[1:55:18.060 --> 1:55:20.060]  And 25% of your signup
[1:55:20.060 --> 1:55:22.060]  For a new domain or a domain you move
[1:55:22.060 --> 1:55:24.060]  Goes to fund the info war
[1:55:24.060 --> 1:55:26.060]  And then we get 5% as well
[1:55:26.060 --> 1:55:28.060]  For any servers or any other type of services
[1:55:28.060 --> 1:55:30.060]  That you get from them
[1:55:30.060 --> 1:55:32.060]  So it's a win-win as we build
[1:55:32.060 --> 1:55:34.060]  A true open free internet again
[1:55:34.060 --> 1:55:36.060]  Because the globalists are destroying
[1:55:36.060 --> 1:55:38.060]  What was open and what was free
[1:55:38.060 --> 1:55:40.060]  So info wars
[1:55:40.060 --> 1:55:42.060]  Domains.com
[1:55:42.060 --> 1:55:44.060]  The revolution starts there
[1:55:44.060 --> 1:55:46.060]  Infowarsdomains.com
[1:55:46.060 --> 1:55:48.060]  Take action now
[1:55:48.060 --> 1:55:50.060]  You're listening
[1:55:50.060 --> 1:56:14.060]  To the Alex Jones show
[1:56:14.060 --> 1:56:38.060]  Let's talk to Ben in Florida
[1:56:38.060 --> 1:56:40.060]  Ben, thanks for holding go ahead
[1:56:40.060 --> 1:56:42.060]  Hey
[1:56:42.060 --> 1:56:44.060]  Welcome my friend
[1:56:44.060 --> 1:56:46.060]  Yeah, it's overwhelming
[1:56:46.060 --> 1:56:48.060]  Mainly, I want to get this out of the point
[1:56:48.060 --> 1:56:50.060]  It's overwhelming to finally talk to you
[1:56:50.060 --> 1:56:52.060]  Because for decades people have been telling me
[1:56:52.060 --> 1:56:54.060]  I was too volatile and paranoid
[1:56:54.060 --> 1:56:56.060]  Because I've been telling them about all this stuff
[1:56:56.060 --> 1:56:58.060]  Except the pedophiles
[1:56:58.060 --> 1:57:00.060]  I didn't have your connections
[1:57:00.060 --> 1:57:02.060]  But about the we're all slaves
[1:57:02.060 --> 1:57:04.060]  And China's evil
[1:57:04.060 --> 1:57:06.060]  And how everything's propaganda
[1:57:06.060 --> 1:57:08.060]  Against the white man
[1:57:08.060 --> 1:57:10.060]  And everybody thought I was
[1:57:10.060 --> 1:57:12.060]  Crazy
[1:57:12.060 --> 1:57:14.060]  But what they do is they brand freedom
[1:57:14.060 --> 1:57:16.060]  And guns and private property as the white man
[1:57:16.060 --> 1:57:18.060]  And then communism is the black man
[1:57:18.060 --> 1:57:20.060]  And they go, the black man's good
[1:57:20.060 --> 1:57:22.060]  The white man's bad
[1:57:22.060 --> 1:57:24.060]  But it has nothing to do with white men and black men
[1:57:24.060 --> 1:57:26.060]  It's all branding, does that make sense?
[1:57:26.060 --> 1:57:28.060]  Yeah, and it's been
[1:57:28.060 --> 1:57:30.060]  Even in commercials
[1:57:30.060 --> 1:57:32.060]  The white man's always an idiot
[1:57:32.060 --> 1:57:34.060]  And I was always showing people
[1:57:34.060 --> 1:57:36.060]  How he always shows people
[1:57:36.060 --> 1:57:38.060]  Abusing white men and women hitting them
[1:57:38.060 --> 1:57:40.060]  It was just always just
[1:57:40.060 --> 1:57:42.060]  It goes back to Mary with children
[1:57:42.060 --> 1:57:44.060]  Every white man on TV is an idiot
[1:57:44.060 --> 1:57:46.060]  And then several years ago
[1:57:46.060 --> 1:57:48.060]  I heard you for the first time
[1:57:48.060 --> 1:57:50.060]  And I realized I'm not the only person that sees this
[1:57:50.060 --> 1:57:52.060]  You know, I thought I was like cursed with this
[1:57:52.060 --> 1:57:54.060]  Sight to be able to see this stuff
[1:57:54.060 --> 1:57:56.060]  Because I was always depressed and angry
[1:57:56.060 --> 1:57:58.060]  You know, and then I saw you
[1:57:58.060 --> 1:58:00.060]  And I was like, wow, this guy gets it
[1:58:00.060 --> 1:58:02.060]  And then I realized you had other listeners
[1:58:02.060 --> 1:58:04.060]  And I'm not alone and I'm trying not to lose it
[1:58:04.060 --> 1:58:06.060]  Talking to me
[1:58:06.060 --> 1:58:08.060]  I told you you're evil because of what Color You Are is BS
[1:58:08.060 --> 1:58:10.060]  And what they've done to black people
[1:58:10.060 --> 1:58:12.060]  They're doing to us now, it's the same damn group doing it
[1:58:12.060 --> 1:58:14.060]  That's why we have to transcend it
[1:58:14.060 --> 1:58:16.060]  Even though we're faced with a lot of racist black people
[1:58:16.060 --> 1:58:18.060]  We have to realize they've been manipulated
[1:58:18.060 --> 1:58:20.060]  Just like other people, we've got to transcend it
[1:58:20.060 --> 1:58:22.060]  But still protect ourselves, does that make sense?
[1:58:22.060 --> 1:58:24.060]  Oh, yeah, I mean, I realize I was being used
[1:58:24.060 --> 1:58:26.060]  You know, even by trying to make things racial
[1:58:26.060 --> 1:58:28.060]  When I was younger
[1:58:28.060 --> 1:58:30.060]  And then I realized they were using me
[1:58:30.060 --> 1:58:32.060]  You know what I mean, just like they use black people
[1:58:32.060 --> 1:58:34.060]  Brother, I mean, listen
[1:58:34.060 --> 1:58:36.060]  There's not any black people
[1:58:36.060 --> 1:58:38.060]  That have been attacked, let's not exaggerate
[1:58:38.060 --> 1:58:40.060]  75 times by white people
[1:58:40.060 --> 1:58:42.060]  I have
[1:58:42.060 --> 1:58:44.060]  But I actually enjoyed it
[1:58:44.060 --> 1:58:46.060]  I mean, I grew up with black folks trying to kill me
[1:58:46.060 --> 1:58:48.060]  And I learned how to fight really good
[1:58:48.060 --> 1:58:50.060]  In fact, people ask how Alex Jones did all this
[1:58:50.060 --> 1:58:52.060]  I owe this to black races beating a little bit of shit out of me
[1:58:52.060 --> 1:58:54.060]  I mean, I have just
[1:58:54.060 --> 1:58:56.060]  And I started hospitalizing a lot of black people
[1:58:56.060 --> 1:58:58.060]  And they pretty soon started
[1:58:58.060 --> 1:59:00.060]  You know, appreciated me
[1:59:00.060 --> 1:59:02.060]  And I love those folks
[1:59:02.060 --> 1:59:04.060]  I love the ones even I put in comas
[1:59:04.060 --> 1:59:06.060]  And I beat up the big rednecks
[1:59:06.060 --> 1:59:08.060]  They wanted to line up and see who this big badass was
[1:59:08.060 --> 1:59:10.060]  But I literally owe who I am
[1:59:10.060 --> 1:59:12.060]  Because I got that taste of war
[1:59:12.060 --> 1:59:14.060]  In Dallas that they've taken away
[1:59:14.060 --> 1:59:16.060]  And I'm not into violence, I'm not saying it's a good thing
[1:59:16.060 --> 1:59:18.060]  But I'm just saying, I wouldn't be who I was
[1:59:18.060 --> 1:59:20.060]  If I wasn't putting the hospital
[1:59:20.060 --> 1:59:22.060]  And broken legs and broken arms
[1:59:22.060 --> 1:59:24.060]  And subdermal hematomas
[1:59:24.060 --> 1:59:26.060]  And stabbed and everything else I did
[1:59:26.060 --> 1:59:28.060]  I really want to thank black people for what they did to me
[1:59:28.060 --> 1:59:30.060]  I'm serious, that's why
[1:59:30.060 --> 1:59:32.060]  Victimology is a load of crap
[1:59:32.060 --> 1:59:34.060]  I got the best education you could ever get
[1:59:34.060 --> 1:59:36.060]  And I thank Jesus for what happened to me
[1:59:36.060 --> 1:59:38.060]  The main reason I called to say that
[1:59:38.060 --> 1:59:40.060]  Everybody keeps talking about 2024
[1:59:40.060 --> 1:59:42.060]  Is Trump going to run
[1:59:42.060 --> 1:59:44.060]  Is General Flynn going to run
[1:59:44.060 --> 1:59:46.060]  Is DeSantis going to run
[1:59:46.060 --> 1:59:48.060]  Our great governor here in Florida
[1:59:48.060 --> 1:59:50.060]  But we don't have till 2024, man
[1:59:50.060 --> 1:59:52.060]  I mean, we got to do something
[1:59:52.060 --> 1:59:54.060]  Something's got to be done
[1:59:54.060 --> 1:59:56.060]  We got to meet in the middle and march or something
[1:59:56.060 --> 1:59:58.060]  The way it's going, we ain't going to make it
[1:59:58.060 --> 2:00:00.060]  Or it's a 5-3, man
[2:00:00.060 --> 2:00:02.060]  To think we're going to make it at the rate we're going
[2:00:02.060 --> 2:00:04.060]  Well, it's all to bring down America
[2:00:04.060 --> 2:00:06.060]  And when they're done, they're going to have the whites turn to the blacks
[2:00:06.060 --> 2:00:08.060]  They're setting the blacks up
[2:00:08.060 --> 2:00:10.060]  Their person getting whites worldwide
[2:00:10.060 --> 2:00:12.060]  When they really start exterminating the third world
[2:00:12.060 --> 2:00:14.060]  We go, well, you know, they collapse the third world
[2:00:14.060 --> 2:00:16.060]  Use them against us
[2:00:16.060 --> 2:00:18.060]  And then they want us to join them
[2:00:18.060 --> 2:00:20.060]  And they want us to join in killing everybody
[2:00:20.060 --> 2:00:22.060]  And they're going to kill us in the end, too
[2:00:22.060 --> 2:00:24.060]  God doesn't want us to kill the black people
[2:00:24.060 --> 2:00:26.060]  I can tell you the Holy Spirit does not want that
[2:00:26.060 --> 2:00:28.060]  You know, you can get into race war
[2:00:28.060 --> 2:00:30.060]  You can do it, whatever, any angle you want
[2:00:30.060 --> 2:00:32.060]  God doesn't like that
[2:00:32.060 --> 2:00:34.060]  And so that's where I'm at, I'm going with God
[2:00:34.060 --> 2:00:36.060]  But that doesn't mean somebody starts trying to kill me
[2:00:36.060 --> 2:00:38.060]  I'm going to bash their brains out
[2:00:38.060 --> 2:00:40.060]  I don't care if they're white or black
[2:00:40.060 --> 2:00:42.060]  You try to kill me, I'm going to kill you
[2:00:42.060 --> 2:00:44.060]  I'm going to die trying
[2:00:44.060 --> 2:00:46.060]  But right back in 60 seconds, some more phone calls
[2:00:46.060 --> 2:00:48.060]  I'm out with shows, this is the info
[2:00:48.060 --> 2:00:50.060]  The Globalists are purposely collapsing our world
[2:00:50.060 --> 2:00:52.060]  They are creating insecurity
[2:00:52.060 --> 2:00:54.060]  Crime, war, and famine
[2:00:54.060 --> 2:00:56.060]  All of us should do everything we can
[2:00:56.060 --> 2:00:58.060]  To get prepared and get ready
[2:00:58.060 --> 2:01:00.060]  For ourselves and our family's sakes
[2:01:00.060 --> 2:01:02.060]  But also our community

[2:02:46.060 --> 2:02:48.060]  Right now
[2:02:48.060 --> 2:02:50.060]  We live at an incredible time
[2:02:50.060 --> 2:02:52.060]  It was said by Winston Churchill
[2:02:52.060 --> 2:02:54.060]  And so many others
[2:02:54.060 --> 2:02:56.060]  That so many men
[2:02:56.060 --> 2:02:58.060]  Are actually made by the time that they live in
[2:02:58.060 --> 2:03:00.060]  And what they decide to do during that time
[2:03:00.060 --> 2:03:02.060]  But right now
[2:03:02.060 --> 2:03:04.060]  Let's go back to your phone calls here
[2:03:04.060 --> 2:03:06.060]  In the order that they have been received
[2:03:06.060 --> 2:03:08.060]  Let's talk to Josh in Maryland
[2:03:08.060 --> 2:03:10.060]  You're on the air, go ahead
[2:03:10.060 --> 2:03:12.060]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[2:03:12.060 --> 2:03:14.060]  Yes sir, love you, go ahead
[2:03:14.060 --> 2:03:16.060]  Alex, love you too man, you're a legend
[2:03:16.060 --> 2:03:18.060]  I just wanted to say a few different things
[2:03:18.060 --> 2:03:20.060]  I got some notes in front of me for you
[2:03:20.060 --> 2:03:22.060]  First of all, I love that you keep on getting
[2:03:22.060 --> 2:03:24.060]  All these other podcasts and shares
[2:03:24.060 --> 2:03:26.060]  I think that really helps your message
[2:03:26.060 --> 2:03:28.060]  Especially get to the age bracket that I'm in
[2:03:28.060 --> 2:03:30.060]  For the millennial generation
[2:03:30.060 --> 2:03:32.060]  But
[2:03:32.060 --> 2:03:34.060]  The main thing I wanted to talk about
[2:03:34.060 --> 2:03:36.060]  Was this Derek Chauvin case
[2:03:36.060 --> 2:03:38.060]  And the outcome here
[2:03:38.060 --> 2:03:40.060]  Also related, the main thing
[2:03:40.060 --> 2:03:42.060]  I've been thinking about is
[2:03:42.060 --> 2:03:44.060]  This energy network that you've mentioned before
[2:03:44.060 --> 2:03:46.060]  That kind of all humans
[2:03:46.060 --> 2:03:48.060]  Interact with
[2:03:48.060 --> 2:03:50.060]  It's almost like
[2:03:50.060 --> 2:03:52.060]  Dark energy or something along those lines
[2:03:52.060 --> 2:03:54.060]  That interacts with our thoughts
[2:03:54.060 --> 2:03:56.060]  And our personalities
[2:03:56.060 --> 2:03:58.060]  Well there's definitely
[2:03:58.060 --> 2:04:00.060]  A sidekick internet
[2:04:00.060 --> 2:04:02.060]  Where we're all interfacing
[2:04:02.060 --> 2:04:04.060]  At a
[2:04:04.060 --> 2:04:06.060]  Dimensional level that affects the electrochemical
[2:04:06.060 --> 2:04:08.060]  In the third dimension
[2:04:08.060 --> 2:04:10.060]  It's been proven, it's documented
[2:04:10.060 --> 2:04:12.060]  And that's what the globalists want to control
[2:04:12.060 --> 2:04:14.060]  They don't want us knowing about it
[2:04:14.060 --> 2:04:16.060]  Because once you know about it
[2:04:16.060 --> 2:04:18.060]  Then it becomes obvious
[2:04:18.060 --> 2:04:20.060]  Because if we get caught up in what they're doing to us
[2:04:20.060 --> 2:04:22.060]  That's only the relay information
[2:04:22.060 --> 2:04:24.060]  That asks ourselves, why are they doing it
[2:04:24.060 --> 2:04:26.060]  Then wanting to kill each other
[2:04:26.060 --> 2:04:28.060]  Because of what color we are
[2:04:28.060 --> 2:04:30.060]  And realize why do they want that
[2:04:30.060 --> 2:04:32.060]  Because they want to kill us all
[2:04:32.060 --> 2:04:34.060]  Does that make sense?
[2:04:34.060 --> 2:04:36.060]  Fine, one of my questions is
[2:04:36.060 --> 2:04:38.060]  How much do you think that
[2:04:38.060 --> 2:04:40.060]  These global elitists
[2:04:40.060 --> 2:04:42.060]  That are particularly compromised
[2:04:42.060 --> 2:04:44.060]  Have been able to
[2:04:44.060 --> 2:04:46.060]  Corrupt this network
[2:04:46.060 --> 2:04:48.060]  In order to kind of coerce us
[2:04:48.060 --> 2:04:50.060]  As individuals in this group think
[2:04:50.060 --> 2:04:52.060]  Specifically around
[2:04:52.060 --> 2:04:54.060]  My role that definitely played
[2:04:54.060 --> 2:04:56.060]  I mean, definitely they know
[2:04:56.060 --> 2:04:58.060]  All this and they use it, but they're limited
[2:04:58.060 --> 2:05:00.060]  And that they just use
[2:05:00.060 --> 2:05:02.060]  Massive messages of coding
[2:05:02.060 --> 2:05:04.060]  To try to get us to behaviorally
[2:05:04.060 --> 2:05:06.060]  Change that affect the spiritual
[2:05:06.060 --> 2:05:08.060]  They're not even connected to the spiritual
[2:05:08.060 --> 2:05:10.060]  They know about it, but they're like a machine
[2:05:10.060 --> 2:05:12.060]  They're not able to interface
[2:05:12.060 --> 2:05:14.060]  With it, in fact you see
[2:05:14.060 --> 2:05:16.060]  What they do, so all of it doesn't make sense
[2:05:16.060 --> 2:05:18.060]  Because it's not
[2:05:18.060 --> 2:05:20.060]  Human in origin from my studies
[2:05:20.060 --> 2:05:22.060]  Okay, that definitely makes more sense
[2:05:22.060 --> 2:05:24.060]  Well, do you think that this also
[2:05:24.060 --> 2:05:26.060]  This network in the age of the internet
[2:05:26.060 --> 2:05:28.060]  That we live in right now
[2:05:28.060 --> 2:05:30.060]  Has definitely played a more pivotal role
[2:05:30.060 --> 2:05:32.060]  In that I find myself
[2:05:32.060 --> 2:05:34.060]  Interacting and finding
[2:05:34.060 --> 2:05:36.060]  Encountering people online
[2:05:36.060 --> 2:05:38.060]  Where I probably would have never had that opportunity
[2:05:38.060 --> 2:05:40.060]  Listen, the evils attempt
[2:05:40.060 --> 2:05:42.060]  To make us all kill each other
[2:05:42.060 --> 2:05:44.060]  Is going to backfire
[2:05:44.060 --> 2:05:46.060]  They're the losers
[2:05:46.060 --> 2:05:48.060]  That's why they're trying to do all this
[2:05:48.060 --> 2:05:50.060]  So as negative as stuff gets
[2:05:50.060 --> 2:05:52.060]  This is a very positive moment
[2:05:52.060 --> 2:05:54.060]  For us to transcend it and come together
[2:05:54.060 --> 2:05:56.060]  And just be honest about it, not be victims
[2:05:56.060 --> 2:05:58.060]  And to realize that that which doesn't kill us
[2:05:58.060 --> 2:06:00.060]  Only makes it stronger, I appreciate your call
[2:06:00.060 --> 2:06:02.060]  And again, I say don't be a victim
[2:06:02.060 --> 2:06:04.060]  Because you get into, I'm a victim
[2:06:04.060 --> 2:06:06.060]  So I'm part of a group, protect me
[2:06:06.060 --> 2:06:08.060]  No, you got to stand up for yourself
[2:06:08.060 --> 2:06:10.060]  And demand your rights and your freedoms
[2:06:10.060 --> 2:06:12.060]  And then all humans have rights
[2:06:12.060 --> 2:06:14.060]  All humans have freedoms
[2:06:14.060 --> 2:06:16.060]  And we don't start talking about what group we're in
[2:06:16.060 --> 2:06:18.060]  The leader that comes
[2:06:18.060 --> 2:06:20.060]  And feeds us like we're cows in a field
[2:06:20.060 --> 2:06:22.060]  Or monkeys in a cage
[2:06:22.060 --> 2:06:24.060]  Or whatever you want to call it
[2:06:24.060 --> 2:06:26.060]  We're not, we build the future
[2:06:26.060 --> 2:06:28.060]  Alright, let's take more calls here
[2:06:28.060 --> 2:06:30.060]  Let's go ahead, who's up next
[2:06:30.060 --> 2:06:32.060]  That would be
[2:06:32.060 --> 2:06:34.060]  Brian in Massachusetts
[2:06:34.060 --> 2:06:36.060]  Brian, thanks for calling
[2:06:36.060 --> 2:06:38.060]  Hey Alex, God bless you brother
[2:06:38.060 --> 2:06:40.060]  God bless you, go ahead
[2:06:40.060 --> 2:06:42.060]  So down here in Mass
[2:06:42.060 --> 2:06:44.060]  I actually live in your hamster
[2:06:44.060 --> 2:06:46.060]  I work in Massachusetts
[2:06:46.060 --> 2:06:48.060]  But driving around Massachusetts
[2:06:48.060 --> 2:06:50.060]  Is awful
[2:06:50.060 --> 2:06:52.060]  It's an awful place to be
[2:06:52.060 --> 2:06:54.060]  It's an awful thing to see
[2:06:54.060 --> 2:06:56.060]  I mainly want to talk about the churches
[2:06:56.060 --> 2:06:58.060]  From what I see down here
[2:06:58.060 --> 2:07:00.060]  And you're not exactly
[2:07:00.060 --> 2:07:02.060]  You know what I'd say about Connecticut
[2:07:02.060 --> 2:07:04.060]  And Massachusetts and LA
[2:07:04.060 --> 2:07:06.060]  It has a feeling of emptiness
[2:07:06.060 --> 2:07:08.060]  It's like there's nothing there
[2:07:08.060 --> 2:07:10.060]  There's no spirit, is that what you're talking about?
[2:07:10.060 --> 2:07:12.060]  Absolutely, everybody down here
[2:07:12.060 --> 2:07:14.060]  That you either talk to
[2:07:14.060 --> 2:07:16.060]  I mean, I talk to all sorts of people in Mass
[2:07:16.060 --> 2:07:18.060]  Everyone is an absolute
[2:07:20.060 --> 2:07:22.060]  You know, controlled
[2:07:22.060 --> 2:07:24.060]  I don't really know what we're to use
[2:07:24.060 --> 2:07:26.060]  For them to be nice, but
[2:07:26.060 --> 2:07:28.060]  I mean, let me have a name for it
[2:07:28.060 --> 2:07:30.060]  It's called Flives
[2:07:30.060 --> 2:07:32.060]  Yeah, there you go, but
[2:07:32.060 --> 2:07:34.060]  Let's say the slave church is down here
[2:07:34.060 --> 2:07:36.060]  You're not exaggerating when you say
[2:07:36.060 --> 2:07:38.060]  They're trying to make Black Lives Matter
[2:07:38.060 --> 2:07:40.060]  Into a legitimate religion
[2:07:40.060 --> 2:07:42.060]  Every single church down here
[2:07:42.060 --> 2:07:44.060]  And I've seen in Massachusetts
[2:07:44.060 --> 2:07:46.060]  Flies a Black Lives Matter
[2:07:46.060 --> 2:07:48.060]  Fly and a
[2:07:48.060 --> 2:07:50.060]  LGBTQ flag
[2:07:50.060 --> 2:07:52.060]  There's no American flag
[2:07:52.060 --> 2:07:54.060]  Yeah, that means we've conquered Black people
[2:07:54.060 --> 2:07:56.060]  And we've conquered sexual reproduction
[2:07:56.060 --> 2:07:58.060]  What does Black Lives Matter say?
[2:07:58.060 --> 2:08:00.060]  Don't have a man in the house
[2:08:00.060 --> 2:08:02.060]  No nuclear family and Black men
[2:08:02.060 --> 2:08:04.060]  Should have agendas cut off
[2:08:04.060 --> 2:08:06.060]  That's what the bad guy
[2:08:06.060 --> 2:08:08.060]  They literally want to sterilize men
[2:08:08.060 --> 2:08:10.060]  I mean, think about that
[2:08:10.060 --> 2:08:12.060]  It's obvious
[2:08:12.060 --> 2:08:14.060]  Every single man down there
[2:08:14.060 --> 2:08:16.060]  But if you go to Massachusetts
[2:08:16.060 --> 2:08:18.060]  90% of the men you talk to
[2:08:18.060 --> 2:08:20.060]  Are absolute cut
[2:08:20.060 --> 2:08:22.060]  They're beta male
[2:08:22.060 --> 2:08:24.060]  They're bent over, they're wearing
[2:08:24.060 --> 2:08:26.060]  Two, three masks
[2:08:26.060 --> 2:08:28.060]  I ask them, hey, you're standing alone
[2:08:28.060 --> 2:08:30.060]  In the park over there walking your dog
[2:08:30.060 --> 2:08:32.060]  Why are you wearing a mask?
[2:08:32.060 --> 2:08:34.060]  And the first thing they do is either cut at you
[2:08:34.060 --> 2:08:36.060]  Or they virtue signal at you
[2:08:36.060 --> 2:08:38.060]  Well, that's because
[2:08:38.060 --> 2:08:40.060]  They've gotten in line with the system
[2:08:40.060 --> 2:08:42.060]  And they're going to submit
[2:08:42.060 --> 2:08:44.060]  Once you fall like a domino
[2:08:44.060 --> 2:08:46.060]  Or like a dead tree in the forest
[2:08:46.060 --> 2:08:48.060]  That's all you do, you're down
[2:08:48.060 --> 2:08:50.060]  And so they'll do anything
[2:08:50.060 --> 2:08:52.060]  And so the point is just move forward
[2:08:52.060 --> 2:08:54.060]  God bless you brother
[2:08:54.060 --> 2:08:56.060]  Incredibly sad story
[2:08:56.060 --> 2:08:58.060]  Let's go ahead and take another call
[2:08:58.060 --> 2:09:00.060]  For Larry Pickney to join us
[2:09:00.060 --> 2:09:02.060]  Let's talk to Tom in New York
[2:09:02.060 --> 2:09:04.060]  Go ahead, Tom
[2:09:04.060 --> 2:09:06.060]  How's it going Alex?
[2:09:06.060 --> 2:09:08.060]  Welcome brother, go ahead
[2:09:08.060 --> 2:09:10.060]  Hey, you can't be?
[2:09:10.060 --> 2:09:12.060]  You're a little bit of a muddy call
[2:09:12.060 --> 2:09:14.060]  But go ahead
[2:09:14.060 --> 2:09:16.060]  Sorry about that, big fan
[2:09:16.060 --> 2:09:18.060]  I just wanted to rock and rust
[2:09:18.060 --> 2:09:20.060]  And buy me a deep breath to do this help
[2:09:20.060 --> 2:09:22.060]  I want to talk about what's going on in Brooklyn
[2:09:22.060 --> 2:09:24.060]  Crazy
[2:09:24.060 --> 2:09:26.060]  I live in Bayridge Brooklyn
[2:09:26.060 --> 2:09:28.060]  Talk right into your telephone
[2:09:28.060 --> 2:09:30.060]  I live in Bayridge Brooklyn
[2:09:30.060 --> 2:09:32.060]  It's an Irish, Norwegian
[2:09:32.060 --> 2:09:34.060]  Italian, German area
[2:09:34.060 --> 2:09:36.060]  It's like the last Republican
[2:09:36.060 --> 2:09:38.060]  Stronghold in Brooklyn
[2:09:38.060 --> 2:09:40.060]  So what they're doing is they're sending
[2:09:40.060 --> 2:09:42.060]  People from Park Slope
[2:09:42.060 --> 2:09:44.060]  Other places in Brooklyn to come in
[2:09:44.060 --> 2:09:46.060]  And try and take Bayridge over
[2:09:46.060 --> 2:09:48.060]  And make it a liberal sound
[2:09:48.060 --> 2:09:50.060]  Also what they're doing is
[2:09:50.060 --> 2:09:52.060]  They're shutting down restaurants
[2:09:52.060 --> 2:09:54.060]  They're shutting down all the restaurants
[2:09:54.060 --> 2:09:56.060]  And 11 illegal immigrants
[2:09:56.060 --> 2:09:58.060]  Sell products in the street
[2:09:58.060 --> 2:10:00.060]  Which is crazy to me
[2:10:00.060 --> 2:10:02.060]  I'll elaborate on that
[2:10:02.060 --> 2:10:04.060]  All right
[2:10:04.060 --> 2:10:06.060]  They're sending out
[2:10:06.060 --> 2:10:08.060]  Bars, restaurants
[2:10:08.060 --> 2:10:10.060]  They're making them close
[2:10:10.060 --> 2:10:12.060]  It's 6 o'clock, 6 p.m.
[2:10:12.060 --> 2:10:14.060]  And
[2:10:14.060 --> 2:10:16.060]  When you walk up
[2:10:16.060 --> 2:10:18.060]  One of the big areas like 86th street
[2:10:18.060 --> 2:10:20.060]  You see Mexican immigrants
[2:10:20.060 --> 2:10:22.060]  You see Chinese immigrants
[2:10:22.060 --> 2:10:24.060]  People can't speak English
[2:10:24.060 --> 2:10:26.060]  And let's be clear
[2:10:26.060 --> 2:10:28.060]  The established businesses are not essential
[2:10:28.060 --> 2:10:30.060]  But the big corporate businesses are
[2:10:30.060 --> 2:10:32.060]  And then they let them set up markets
[2:10:32.060 --> 2:10:34.060]  We're not against the poor Mexicans
[2:10:34.060 --> 2:10:36.060]  But the point is
[2:10:36.060 --> 2:10:38.060]  They've been brought in
[2:10:38.060 --> 2:10:40.060]  And authorized to do this
[2:10:40.060 --> 2:10:42.060]  It's all selectively enforced
[2:10:42.060 --> 2:10:44.060]  Which is pure economic warfare
[2:10:44.060 --> 2:10:46.060]  You should shoot video of it, brother
[2:10:46.060 --> 2:10:48.060]  We should get your number
[2:10:48.060 --> 2:10:50.060]  You should show us that
[2:10:50.060 --> 2:10:52.060]  Will you go shoot video of this for us?
[2:10:52.060 --> 2:10:54.060]  Yes, exactly
[2:10:54.060 --> 2:10:56.060]  Walmart's open
[2:10:56.060 --> 2:10:58.060]  Yeah, definitely
[2:10:58.060 --> 2:11:00.060]  I actually live two miles
[2:11:00.060 --> 2:11:02.060]  From Chinatown
[2:11:02.060 --> 2:11:04.060]  And you should see Chinatown
[2:11:04.060 --> 2:11:06.060]  Chinatown is like a third world country
[2:11:06.060 --> 2:11:08.060]  There's a million Chinese people on the street
[2:11:08.060 --> 2:11:10.060]  Just selling stuff in the street
[2:11:10.060 --> 2:11:12.060]  No one speaks the word of English
[2:11:12.060 --> 2:11:14.060]  And all the stores are shut down
[2:11:14.060 --> 2:11:16.060]  At 6 p.m. It's crazy
[2:11:16.060 --> 2:11:18.060]  It's insane
[2:11:18.060 --> 2:11:20.060]  And we've got curfews all over the world
[2:11:20.060 --> 2:11:22.060]  We're being taught to live under martial law
[2:11:22.060 --> 2:11:24.060]  It's not coming
[2:11:24.060 --> 2:11:26.060]  We'll get your name and number
[2:11:26.060 --> 2:11:28.060]  But just don't wait
[2:11:28.060 --> 2:11:30.060]  Shoot video, upload it
[2:11:30.060 --> 2:11:32.060]  Show what's happening
[2:11:32.060 --> 2:11:34.060]  Don't try to be fancy
[2:11:34.060 --> 2:11:36.060]  Wish you could do a better job
[2:11:36.060 --> 2:11:38.060]  Just do it
[2:11:38.060 --> 2:11:40.060]  The journey of a thousand miles
[2:11:40.060 --> 2:11:42.060]  Starts with a single step
[2:11:42.060 --> 2:11:44.060]  All right
[2:11:44.060 --> 2:11:46.060]  A founding member of the Black Panther Party
[2:11:46.060 --> 2:11:48.060]  Not to be confused, the new Black Panther Party
[2:11:48.060 --> 2:11:50.060]  Is joining us Larry Pink
[2:11:50.060 --> 2:11:52.060]  We really appreciate him
[2:11:52.060 --> 2:11:56.060]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet
[2:11:56.060 --> 2:11:58.060]  In the last decade has been
[2:11:58.060 --> 2:12:00.060]  Alex Jones was right
[2:12:00.060 --> 2:12:02.060]  But it now routinely trends
[2:12:02.060 --> 2:12:04.060]  Number one on platforms
[2:12:04.060 --> 2:12:06.060]  Like Twitter and Facebook
[2:12:06.060 --> 2:12:08.060]  Making the globalists pull their hair out in anger
[2:12:08.060 --> 2:12:10.060]  Well, let me tell you, we are

[2:14:15.060 --> 2:14:17.060]  You can run on
[2:14:17.060 --> 2:14:19.060]  For a long time
[2:14:19.060 --> 2:14:20.060]  Run on
[2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:22.060]  For a long time
[2:14:22.060 --> 2:14:23.060]  Run on
[2:14:23.060 --> 2:14:25.060]  For a long time
[2:14:25.060 --> 2:14:27.060]  Sooner or later you've got to cut you down
[2:14:27.060 --> 2:14:29.060]  What's happening is very, very simple
[2:14:29.060 --> 2:14:31.060]  You've got to cut you down
[2:14:31.060 --> 2:14:33.060]  We're not animals, we're humans
[2:14:33.060 --> 2:14:35.060]  We're able to see our environment and know what's happening
[2:14:35.060 --> 2:14:36.060]  And not just react to it
[2:14:36.060 --> 2:14:38.060]  They're trying to cause racial and cultural division
[2:14:38.060 --> 2:14:40.060]  Between men and women
[2:14:40.060 --> 2:14:42.060]  Between black and white, between old and young
[2:14:42.060 --> 2:14:44.060]  While the country literally has
[2:14:44.060 --> 2:14:46.060]  His power plant shut down, while our borders are destroyed
[2:14:46.060 --> 2:14:48.060]  While
[2:14:48.060 --> 2:14:50.060]  Satanism is hopefully promoted
[2:14:50.060 --> 2:14:52.060]  In pedophilia
[2:14:52.060 --> 2:14:54.060]  Larry Pinckney
[2:14:54.060 --> 2:14:56.060]  Just learned today he had his Twitter ban
[2:14:56.060 --> 2:14:58.060]  We were going to link to his Twitter
[2:14:58.060 --> 2:15:00.060]  And oh look, it's banned because
[2:15:00.060 --> 2:15:02.060]  He was promoting Unity in his country
[2:15:02.060 --> 2:15:04.060]  He's a founding member of the Black Panther Party
[2:15:04.060 --> 2:15:06.060]  The real one, not the black KKK version
[2:15:06.060 --> 2:15:08.060]  Is today
[2:15:08.060 --> 2:15:10.060]  And just like the KKK
[2:15:10.060 --> 2:15:12.060]  He said
[2:15:12.060 --> 2:15:14.060]  The people calling for real Unity are put in jail
[2:15:14.060 --> 2:15:16.060]  And so Larry Pinckney joins us
[2:15:16.060 --> 2:15:18.060]  For the next 45 minutes
[2:15:18.060 --> 2:15:20.060]  I really appreciate him coming on with us
[2:15:20.060 --> 2:15:22.060]  He's a very humble guy
[2:15:22.060 --> 2:15:24.060]  He's also a very smart individual
[2:15:24.060 --> 2:15:26.060]  Always asks how do we support you
[2:15:26.060 --> 2:15:28.060]  He doesn't care about that
[2:15:28.060 --> 2:15:30.060]  He just takes care of his family
[2:15:30.060 --> 2:15:32.060]  And he's a soldier for humanity
[2:15:32.060 --> 2:15:34.060]  And a brother
[2:15:34.060 --> 2:15:36.060]  And watching all this go down
[2:15:36.060 --> 2:15:38.060]  Watching all this happen
[2:15:38.060 --> 2:15:40.060]  Get his take on
[2:15:40.060 --> 2:15:42.060]  On this trap that's being set
[2:15:42.060 --> 2:15:44.060]  And what America needs to do
[2:15:44.060 --> 2:15:46.060]  To counter this, what we need to do to counter it
[2:15:46.060 --> 2:15:48.060]  Larry, great to have you on my friend
[2:15:48.060 --> 2:15:50.060]  Well, Alex, first and foremost
[2:15:50.060 --> 2:15:52.060]  Let me say that it's always
[2:15:52.060 --> 2:15:54.060]  And I repeat always
[2:15:54.060 --> 2:15:56.060]  It did light and an honor
[2:15:56.060 --> 2:15:58.060]  To join you
[2:15:58.060 --> 2:16:00.060]  To join info wars
[2:16:00.060 --> 2:16:02.060]  To join
[2:16:02.060 --> 2:16:04.060]  My brothers and sisters of all colors
[2:16:04.060 --> 2:16:06.060]  At info wars
[2:16:06.060 --> 2:16:08.060]  And let me just make that
[2:16:08.060 --> 2:16:10.060]  Very clear, perfectly clear
[2:16:10.060 --> 2:16:12.060]  So thank you
[2:16:12.060 --> 2:16:14.060]  All kudos to you
[2:16:14.060 --> 2:16:16.060]  To the crew
[2:16:16.060 --> 2:16:18.060]  Love to your audience
[2:16:18.060 --> 2:16:20.060]  Or to our audience really
[2:16:20.060 --> 2:16:22.060]  And to your families
[2:16:22.060 --> 2:16:24.060]  Take good care now
[2:16:24.060 --> 2:16:26.060]  Getting on with what
[2:16:26.060 --> 2:16:28.060]  You had said
[2:16:28.060 --> 2:16:30.060]  What is happening today
[2:16:30.060 --> 2:16:32.060]  Clearly is an
[2:16:32.060 --> 2:16:34.060]  Attempt to
[2:16:34.060 --> 2:16:36.060]  Divide and destroy
[2:16:36.060 --> 2:16:38.060]  This republic
[2:16:38.060 --> 2:16:40.060]  I'm going to say that again
[2:16:40.060 --> 2:16:42.060]  It is a very, very
[2:16:42.060 --> 2:16:44.060]  Sustained attempt
[2:16:44.060 --> 2:16:46.060]  To divide
[2:16:46.060 --> 2:16:48.060]  And to destroy this republic
[2:16:48.060 --> 2:16:50.060]  Make no mistake about that
[2:16:50.060 --> 2:16:52.060]  Okay, we
[2:16:52.060 --> 2:16:54.060]  And Alex, I heard you say this
[2:16:54.060 --> 2:16:56.060]  In your introduction
[2:16:56.060 --> 2:16:58.060]  That if we
[2:16:58.060 --> 2:17:00.060]  Are cognizant
[2:17:00.060 --> 2:17:02.060]  If we are aware
[2:17:02.060 --> 2:17:04.060]  Of what is going on
[2:17:04.060 --> 2:17:06.060]  And we know
[2:17:06.060 --> 2:17:08.060]  What is going on, this division
[2:17:08.060 --> 2:17:10.060]  Okay, then we can
[2:17:10.060 --> 2:17:12.060]  Effectively
[2:17:12.060 --> 2:17:14.060]  And successfully
[2:17:14.060 --> 2:17:16.060]  Combat it
[2:17:16.060 --> 2:17:18.060]  We don't have to be quote victims
[2:17:18.060 --> 2:17:20.060]  We are humans, as you said
[2:17:20.060 --> 2:17:22.060]  And humans have the capacity
[2:17:22.060 --> 2:17:24.060]  To both reason
[2:17:24.060 --> 2:17:26.060]  To think, to reason
[2:17:26.060 --> 2:17:28.060]  Okay
[2:17:28.060 --> 2:17:30.060]  It reminds me
[2:17:30.060 --> 2:17:32.060]  Of a biblical passage
[2:17:32.060 --> 2:17:34.060]  That says, come, let us reason together
[2:17:34.060 --> 2:17:36.060]  Well, obviously
[2:17:36.060 --> 2:17:38.060]  We cannot reason
[2:17:38.060 --> 2:17:40.060]  With neoliberal fashion
[2:17:40.060 --> 2:17:42.060]  Okay, we cannot
[2:17:42.060 --> 2:17:44.060]  Even try
[2:17:44.060 --> 2:17:46.060]  To reason with them
[2:17:46.060 --> 2:17:48.060]  But we can reason
[2:17:48.060 --> 2:17:50.060]  With our fellow
[2:17:50.060 --> 2:17:52.060]  Brothers and sisters of all color
[2:17:52.060 --> 2:17:54.060]  Please, I implore
[2:17:54.060 --> 2:17:56.060]  Everyone
[2:17:56.060 --> 2:17:58.060]  To remember
[2:17:58.060 --> 2:18:00.060]  That our struggle is a struggle
[2:18:00.060 --> 2:18:02.060]  For ourselves
[2:18:02.060 --> 2:18:04.060]  Individually and for
[2:18:04.060 --> 2:18:06.060]  Our families
[2:18:06.060 --> 2:18:08.060]  And for our republic
[2:18:08.060 --> 2:18:10.060]  Collectively
[2:18:10.060 --> 2:18:12.060]  We've got to stand up
[2:18:12.060 --> 2:18:14.060]  We have got to educate one another
[2:18:14.060 --> 2:18:16.060]  Back one another
[2:18:16.060 --> 2:18:18.060]  Support one another
[2:18:18.060 --> 2:18:20.060]  And if we have disagreements
[2:18:20.060 --> 2:18:22.060]  Which we surely will have
[2:18:22.060 --> 2:18:24.060]  Do it as brother Malcolm said
[2:18:24.060 --> 2:18:26.060]  In the closet
[2:18:26.060 --> 2:18:28.060]  So the
[2:18:28.060 --> 2:18:30.060]  Mass media
[2:18:30.060 --> 2:18:32.060]  Can take advantage of that
[2:18:32.060 --> 2:18:34.060]  And so seeds of disunity
[2:18:34.060 --> 2:18:36.060]  Okay, we're not robots
[2:18:36.060 --> 2:18:38.060]  I heard the
[2:18:38.060 --> 2:18:40.060]  The gentleman calling from
[2:18:40.060 --> 2:18:42.060]  I believe he said was Massachusetts
[2:18:42.060 --> 2:18:44.060]  Or New Hampshire
[2:18:44.060 --> 2:18:46.060]  And you know
[2:18:46.060 --> 2:18:48.060]  The point is, we are not
[2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:50.060]  Robots, they want us
[2:18:50.060 --> 2:18:52.060]  To be robots
[2:18:52.060 --> 2:18:54.060]  Mentally, first and foremost
[2:18:54.060 --> 2:18:56.060]  We are not
[2:18:56.060 --> 2:18:58.060]  And we shall not
[2:18:58.060 --> 2:19:00.060]  We shall not bend
[2:19:00.060 --> 2:19:02.060]  We will grow stronger
[2:19:02.060 --> 2:19:04.060]  I think the enemy is launching all this
[2:19:04.060 --> 2:19:06.060]  Because they're weak, not because they're strong
[2:19:06.060 --> 2:19:08.060]  It's so transparent, it's so ridiculous
[2:19:08.060 --> 2:19:10.060]  Watching all this unfold
[2:19:10.060 --> 2:19:12.060]  Where do you think it's going?
[2:19:12.060 --> 2:19:14.060]  I think it's going to a point
[2:19:14.060 --> 2:19:16.060]  Believe it or not, that's really going to be
[2:19:16.060 --> 2:19:18.060]  In favor of humanity
[2:19:18.060 --> 2:19:20.060]  You see
[2:19:20.060 --> 2:19:22.060]  Obviously
[2:19:22.060 --> 2:19:24.060]  The globalists are attempting to do
[2:19:24.060 --> 2:19:26.060]  Is to
[2:19:26.060 --> 2:19:28.060]  Show their
[2:19:28.060 --> 2:19:30.060]  Quote unquote
[2:19:30.060 --> 2:19:32.060]  Strength, but the reality is
[2:19:32.060 --> 2:19:34.060]  They are paper tigers
[2:19:34.060 --> 2:19:36.060]  We used to use that expression back in the day
[2:19:36.060 --> 2:19:38.060]  They are paper tigers
[2:19:38.060 --> 2:19:40.060]  Okay, because
[2:19:40.060 --> 2:19:42.060]  Once enough people
[2:19:42.060 --> 2:19:44.060]  Become aware of the game
[2:19:44.060 --> 2:19:46.060]  Of the end game
[2:19:46.060 --> 2:19:48.060]  Of the game plan
[2:19:48.060 --> 2:19:50.060]  Then they are like
[2:19:50.060 --> 2:19:52.060]  The expression, the emperor has
[2:19:52.060 --> 2:19:54.060]  No clothes, okay
[2:19:54.060 --> 2:19:56.060]  And this is why you have
[2:19:56.060 --> 2:19:58.060]  People such as Joe
[2:19:58.060 --> 2:20:00.060]  Biden
[2:20:00.060 --> 2:20:02.060]  Who eulogized
[2:20:02.060 --> 2:20:04.060]  Former Ku Klux Klan leader and recruiter
[2:20:04.060 --> 2:20:06.060]  Robert Byrd
[2:20:06.060 --> 2:20:08.060]  Him
[2:20:08.060 --> 2:20:10.060]  And
[2:20:10.060 --> 2:20:12.060]  Had the unmitigated audacity
[2:20:12.060 --> 2:20:14.060]  To tell
[2:20:14.060 --> 2:20:16.060]  Black Americans
[2:20:16.060 --> 2:20:18.060]  Quote, you ain't
[2:20:18.060 --> 2:20:20.060]  Quote, black if you don't vote for me
[2:20:20.060 --> 2:20:22.060]  Now how more racist
[2:20:22.060 --> 2:20:24.060]  And fascist
[2:20:24.060 --> 2:20:26.060]  Can you possibly be
[2:20:26.060 --> 2:20:28.060]  He owns the identity of black people
[2:20:28.060 --> 2:20:30.060]  It's very insulting
[2:20:30.060 --> 2:20:32.060]  It's degrading, but it's also causing
[2:20:32.060 --> 2:20:34.060]  It's meant to cause
[2:20:34.060 --> 2:20:36.060]  Disunity
[2:20:36.060 --> 2:20:38.060]  It's meant to
[2:20:38.060 --> 2:20:40.060]  And it's disgusting
[2:20:40.060 --> 2:20:42.060]  And we cannot allow
[2:20:42.060 --> 2:20:44.060]  A black person said it would be insulting
[2:20:44.060 --> 2:20:46.060]  He's a white dude with a racist history
[2:20:46.060 --> 2:20:48.060]  I define who you are
[2:20:48.060 --> 2:20:50.060]  It's incredible
[2:20:50.060 --> 2:20:52.060]  I won't even let a black person
[2:20:52.060 --> 2:20:54.060]  Define who I am
[2:20:54.060 --> 2:20:56.060]  I define who I am
[2:20:56.060 --> 2:20:58.060]  We all individually
[2:20:58.060 --> 2:21:00.060]  And collectively define
[2:21:00.060 --> 2:21:02.060]  Who we are
[2:21:02.060 --> 2:21:04.060]  So I keep reminding
[2:21:04.060 --> 2:21:06.060]  People of who
[2:21:06.060 --> 2:21:08.060]  Biden and his
[2:21:08.060 --> 2:21:10.060]  Hinchmen really, really
[2:21:10.060 --> 2:21:12.060]  Are
[2:21:12.060 --> 2:21:14.060]  Keep going, you've got the floor here
[2:21:14.060 --> 2:21:16.060]  Spend a few minutes now
[2:21:16.060 --> 2:21:18.060]  On just where we are, we think we should do
[2:21:18.060 --> 2:21:20.060]  Okay, well let me just
[2:21:20.060 --> 2:21:22.060]  Try to lay the foundation
[2:21:22.060 --> 2:21:24.060]  What I'd like to discuss when we get back
[2:21:24.060 --> 2:21:26.060]  Is examples
[2:21:26.060 --> 2:21:28.060]  Of unity
[2:21:28.060 --> 2:21:30.060]  I would like to discuss
[2:21:30.060 --> 2:21:32.060]  Some of the things that we could
[2:21:32.060 --> 2:21:34.060]  And should and will be doing
[2:21:34.060 --> 2:21:36.060]  And are doing, the media's not going to cover that
[2:21:36.060 --> 2:21:38.060]  We have to cover that
[2:21:38.060 --> 2:21:40.060]  And so that's
[2:21:40.060 --> 2:21:42.060]  Where I want to go from here, Alex
[2:21:42.060 --> 2:21:44.060]  But I will go wherever you take this
[2:21:44.060 --> 2:21:46.060]  No sir, we've got you here
[2:21:46.060 --> 2:21:48.060]  I mean, I know you knew Malcolm X
[2:21:48.060 --> 2:21:50.060]  You were in the middle of all the original stuff
[2:21:50.060 --> 2:21:52.060]  And you saw it, what a learning process
[2:21:52.060 --> 2:21:54.060]  Your knowledge is just incredible
[2:21:54.060 --> 2:21:56.060]  And your wisdom is amazing
[2:21:56.060 --> 2:21:58.060]  And I just feel so sorry for everybody
[2:21:58.060 --> 2:22:00.060]  Buying into this division
[2:22:00.060 --> 2:22:02.060]  Because a lot of folks are rejecting it
[2:22:02.060 --> 2:22:04.060]  A lot of good things are happening, like you said
[2:22:04.060 --> 2:22:06.060]  There's also a lot of people, both black and white
[2:22:06.060 --> 2:22:08.060]  That are becoming serious racists
[2:22:08.060 --> 2:22:10.060]  And now the globalists are about to have
[2:22:10.060 --> 2:22:12.060]  A big conquer they want, it makes me sick
[2:22:12.060 --> 2:22:14.060]  You're right, you're right
[2:22:14.060 --> 2:22:16.060]  But you know, you've heard that expression
[2:22:16.060 --> 2:22:18.060]  You know, that a lot of jazz singers
[2:22:18.060 --> 2:22:20.060]  Use
[2:22:20.060 --> 2:22:22.060]  It ain't over till the fat lady sing
[2:22:22.060 --> 2:22:24.060]  And the fat lady ain't nowhere near singing
[2:22:24.060 --> 2:22:26.060]  Alright
[2:22:26.060 --> 2:22:28.060]  The people will unite
[2:22:28.060 --> 2:22:30.060]  We are uniting
[2:22:30.060 --> 2:22:32.060]  And you know, they can throw up the divide
[2:22:32.060 --> 2:22:34.060]  And conquer things all they want
[2:22:34.060 --> 2:22:36.060]  But as I said
[2:22:36.060 --> 2:22:38.060]  They are paper tigers
[2:22:38.060 --> 2:22:40.060]  And history shows
[2:22:40.060 --> 2:22:42.060]  Evil's always ahead up front
[2:22:42.060 --> 2:22:44.060]  And it's already starting to get a sass kick
[2:22:44.060 --> 2:22:46.060]  Evil's always ahead up front
[2:22:46.060 --> 2:23:08.060]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time
[2:23:08.060 --> 2:23:24.060]  And they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media
[2:23:24.060 --> 2:23:26.060]  So it's now that your credibility is way up
[2:23:26.060 --> 2:23:28.060]  The power structures are to silence
[2:23:28.060 --> 2:23:30.060]  Those of us that they can't
[2:23:30.060 --> 2:23:32.060]  But it's up to all of us
[2:23:32.060 --> 2:23:34.060]  To not let them silence any of us
[2:23:34.060 --> 2:23:36.060]  We have the power
[2:23:36.060 --> 2:23:38.060]  But the sun is setting on humanity
[2:23:38.060 --> 2:23:40.060]  And setting on free speech
[2:23:40.060 --> 2:23:42.060]  We have to make sure that we find hard right now
[2:23:42.060 --> 2:23:46.060]  To make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come
[2:23:46.060 --> 2:23:48.060]  So be the polar bears you are
[2:23:52.060 --> 2:23:54.060]  The people are awakening
[2:23:54.060 --> 2:23:56.060]  They're taking control of their own environment
[2:23:56.060 --> 2:23:58.060]  Cell phones are an amazing tool
[2:23:58.060 --> 2:24:00.060]  Really, they're a super computer that's handheld
[2:24:00.060 --> 2:24:02.060]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers
[2:24:02.060 --> 2:24:04.060]  Governments, foreign governments
[2:24:04.060 --> 2:24:06.060]  The CHICOMS especially
[2:24:06.060 --> 2:24:08.060]  Are using this to steal your data
[2:24:08.060 --> 2:24:10.060]  To share your data
[2:24:10.060 --> 2:24:12.060]  To be able to rig markets
[2:24:12.060 --> 2:24:14.060]  When they're able to scoop up billions of people's data
[2:24:14.060 --> 2:24:16.060]  They can actually predict on record
[2:24:16.060 --> 2:24:18.060]  What's going to happen in mass movements
[2:24:18.060 --> 2:24:22.060]  Cutting them out of that data stream
[2:24:22.060 --> 2:24:24.060]  Absolutely devastates their AI takeover
[2:24:24.060 --> 2:24:26.060]  In their own words, they admit it
[2:24:26.060 --> 2:24:28.060]  So I've been selling privacy pouches
[2:24:28.060 --> 2:24:30.060]  And blocket pockets and things like that
[2:24:30.060 --> 2:24:32.060]  For more than a decade
[2:24:32.060 --> 2:24:34.060]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight
[2:24:34.060 --> 2:24:36.060]  They're faraday cages
[2:24:36.060 --> 2:24:38.060]  They just look like a cloth envelope
[2:24:38.060 --> 2:24:40.060]  They work absolutely great
[2:24:40.060 --> 2:24:42.060]  And it just gives you that security
[2:24:42.060 --> 2:24:44.060]  To have power over your data
[2:24:44.060 --> 2:24:46.060]  And power over your identity
[2:24:46.060 --> 2:24:48.060]  When you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to
[2:24:48.060 --> 2:24:50.060]  Because it's not their business
[2:24:50.060 --> 2:24:52.060]  Get yours at infostore.com today
[2:24:52.060 --> 2:24:54.060]  I'm a very humble person
[2:24:54.060 --> 2:24:56.060]  But I'm also a bold person
[2:24:56.060 --> 2:24:58.060]  And so as bad as things are
[2:24:58.060 --> 2:25:00.060]  With the globalist attacking humanity
[2:25:00.060 --> 2:25:02.060]  Things that are unfolding
[2:25:02.060 --> 2:25:04.060]  I want you to know that a lot of positive things
[2:25:04.060 --> 2:25:06.060]  Are happening as well
[2:25:06.060 --> 2:25:08.060]  I'm a public figure, so
[2:25:08.060 --> 2:25:10.060]  I get to see things that the Republic doesn't get to see
[2:25:10.060 --> 2:25:12.060]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs
[2:25:12.060 --> 2:25:14.060]  Or members of Congress
[2:25:14.060 --> 2:25:16.060]  Or even folks in Hollywood
[2:25:16.060 --> 2:25:18.060]  Or mainstream media or industry
[2:25:18.060 --> 2:25:20.060]  People are really, really away from the establishment
[2:25:20.060 --> 2:25:22.060]  They don't want to go along with the globalist
[2:25:22.060 --> 2:25:24.060]  But they're scared
[2:25:24.060 --> 2:25:26.060]  They're looking for leadership
[2:25:26.060 --> 2:25:28.060]  Well, that's where M4 comes in

[2:25:34.060 --> 2:25:36.060]  What the globalist says unpopular
[2:25:36.060 --> 2:25:38.060]  What the globalist will target you for
[2:25:38.060 --> 2:25:40.060]  To show people that it's safe to tell the truth
[2:25:40.060 --> 2:25:42.060]  And to take the heat
[2:25:42.060 --> 2:25:44.060]  That's our job, so please
[2:25:44.060 --> 2:25:46.060]  Keep us on air
[2:25:46.060 --> 2:25:48.060]  So we can hit the barbed wire
[2:25:48.060 --> 2:25:50.060]  So we can be the shock groups for the information war
[2:25:50.060 --> 2:25:52.060]  Fund us at M4store.com
[2:25:52.060 --> 2:25:54.060]  It is a big idea
[2:25:54.060 --> 2:25:58.060]  A new world order
[2:25:58.060 --> 2:26:00.060]  In the near future
[2:26:00.060 --> 2:26:04.060]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[2:26:04.060 --> 2:26:06.060]  It's known as the Bilderberg
[2:26:06.060 --> 2:26:10.060]  But their objective is the world domination
[2:26:10.060 --> 2:26:12.060]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew
[2:26:12.060 --> 2:26:16.060]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[2:26:16.060 --> 2:26:18.060]  Their great dream of exterminating
[2:26:18.060 --> 2:26:20.060]  80% of humanity is in hand
[2:26:20.060 --> 2:26:22.060]  The globalist feared this film
[2:26:22.060 --> 2:26:24.060]  Made 14 years ago
[2:26:24.060 --> 2:26:26.060]  It is the blueprint for their plan to figure with the world
[2:26:26.060 --> 2:26:28.060]  It is the blueprint for the great reset
[2:26:28.060 --> 2:26:30.060]  It is in-game

[2:26:46.060 --> 2:26:48.060]  You tell others you've given a copy too
[2:26:48.060 --> 2:26:50.060]  That they make copies and share it as well
[2:26:50.060 --> 2:26:52.060]  Meaning we the people cannot be stopped
[2:27:20.060 --> 2:27:24.060]  The real heroes out there are so many times unsung
[2:27:24.060 --> 2:27:27.060]  I've gotten in my 27 years on air
[2:27:27.060 --> 2:27:29.060]  30 years but I've been involved
[2:27:29.060 --> 2:27:31.060]  Meet some incredible people
[2:27:31.060 --> 2:27:33.060]  I could tell you some stories you wouldn't even believe
[2:27:33.060 --> 2:27:35.060]  But I know who Larry Pickney is
[2:27:35.060 --> 2:27:37.060]  I actually have read books, done research to know
[2:27:37.060 --> 2:27:39.060]  All the amazing things he did decades ago
[2:27:39.060 --> 2:27:41.060]  Political presidents, political leaders
[2:27:41.060 --> 2:27:43.060]  And I know who Larry Pickney is
[2:27:43.060 --> 2:27:45.060]  I've actually read books, done research to know
[2:27:45.060 --> 2:27:47.060]  All the amazing things he did decades ago
[2:27:47.060 --> 2:27:49.060]  Political presidents
[2:27:49.060 --> 2:27:52.060]  Put in prison for exposing the FBI corruption
[2:27:52.060 --> 2:27:55.060]  Now that same FBI trying to put me in jail
[2:27:55.060 --> 2:27:57.060]  Running COINTELPRO on me
[2:27:57.060 --> 2:27:59.060]  But that's okay because that's where you are
[2:27:59.060 --> 2:28:01.060]  When you're doing the right thing for humanity
[2:28:01.060 --> 2:28:03.060]  I expect to get flack over the target
[2:28:03.060 --> 2:28:05.060]  Do I blame every FBI agent? No
[2:28:05.060 --> 2:28:07.060]  Do I blame every white person for white supremacist?
[2:28:07.060 --> 2:28:10.060]  Do I blame every black person for black crazy people? No
[2:28:10.060 --> 2:28:12.060]  But that's where we are
[2:28:12.060 --> 2:28:14.060]  We better be honest about the big picture
[2:28:14.060 --> 2:28:16.060]  You get the 35,000 foot view and rise above it
[2:28:16.060 --> 2:28:18.060]  Because if we don't, we're going to be down on the ground
[2:28:18.060 --> 2:28:20.060]  Dealing with this nightmare
[2:28:20.060 --> 2:28:23.060]  Larry Pickney, please continue with what you wanted to get into
[2:28:23.060 --> 2:28:25.060]  About the big picture, how to counter this
[2:28:25.060 --> 2:28:27.060]  Where it's going because you've got a lot of knowledge
[2:28:27.060 --> 2:28:30.060]  Disgorge it on us right now, my brother
[2:28:30.060 --> 2:28:33.060]  Well, thank you again, my brother Alex
[2:28:33.060 --> 2:28:36.060]  Now, let me, you know, as you were speaking
[2:28:36.060 --> 2:28:39.060]  I thought of a song that a few years ago
[2:28:39.060 --> 2:28:42.060]  I used to listen to quite a lot
[2:28:42.060 --> 2:28:46.060]  The name of the song is Back to Living Again
[2:28:46.060 --> 2:28:48.060]  Back to Living Again
[2:28:48.060 --> 2:28:52.060]  It's by the late great Curtis Mayfield
[2:28:52.060 --> 2:28:55.060]  A lot of folks may not know who he was
[2:28:55.060 --> 2:28:58.060]  But this was in his last album
[2:28:58.060 --> 2:29:02.060]  Or CD, you can tell my age, I still say album
[2:29:02.060 --> 2:29:06.060]  Where he had this and many other songs
[2:29:06.060 --> 2:29:08.060]  But Back to Living Again
[2:29:08.060 --> 2:29:11.060]  And essentially what the song is saying
[2:29:11.060 --> 2:29:13.060]  And what Curtis was saying
[2:29:13.060 --> 2:29:18.060]  Is that, look, we have got to get back to the fundamentals
[2:29:18.060 --> 2:29:21.060]  And notice, I thought it was quite ironic
[2:29:21.060 --> 2:29:27.060]  That the title of the album or CD was New World Order
[2:29:27.060 --> 2:29:30.060]  And he breaks it down in various cuts
[2:29:30.060 --> 2:29:33.060]  And when I say cuts, I mean various songs
[2:29:33.060 --> 2:29:38.060]  And this is not simply for black Americans
[2:29:38.060 --> 2:29:40.060]  Or black people
[2:29:40.060 --> 2:29:43.060]  Figures, this was for all of us
[2:29:43.060 --> 2:29:46.060]  Black, white, brown, red, yellow, alright?
[2:29:46.060 --> 2:29:48.060]  Citizens of this republic
[2:29:48.060 --> 2:29:53.060]  So I am urging us all to remember the power of the positive
[2:29:53.060 --> 2:29:56.060]  I repeat, the power of the positive
[2:29:56.060 --> 2:29:59.060]  Let's get back to living again
[2:29:59.060 --> 2:30:04.060]  Let's not let these globalists control us
[2:30:04.060 --> 2:30:07.060]  Mentally or physically
[2:30:07.060 --> 2:30:11.060]  You know, the best way to control people is to
[2:30:11.060 --> 2:30:13.060]  Or I say the best way, I don't like that term
[2:30:13.060 --> 2:30:18.060]  I'll say the most effective way to control people is to what?
[2:30:18.060 --> 2:30:20.060]  Control their minds
[2:30:20.060 --> 2:30:22.060]  Control how they think
[2:30:22.060 --> 2:30:25.060]  Make sure that they really don't critically think
[2:30:25.060 --> 2:30:28.060]  Make sure that they're robots
[2:30:28.060 --> 2:30:30.060]  To be robotic
[2:30:30.060 --> 2:30:32.060]  And I say like Curtis says
[2:30:32.060 --> 2:30:34.060]  Back to living again
[2:30:34.060 --> 2:30:38.060]  Okay, whenever life takes, you know, that I don't know
[2:30:38.060 --> 2:30:40.060]  I'm gonna take my truth
[2:30:40.060 --> 2:30:42.060]  And I'm gonna grow
[2:30:42.060 --> 2:30:44.060]  Alright, and I'm just paraphrasing
[2:30:44.060 --> 2:30:46.060]  But you know, all of us
[2:30:46.060 --> 2:30:48.060]  No, he's saying I've been attacked, but I'm not a victim
[2:30:48.060 --> 2:30:50.060]  I grow
[2:30:50.060 --> 2:30:53.060]  That's right, that's right, that's right
[2:30:53.060 --> 2:30:56.060]  You see, this victim mentality
[2:30:56.060 --> 2:31:01.060]  Is nothing more than a deliberate slave mentality
[2:31:01.060 --> 2:31:03.060]  Oh, I'm a slave
[2:31:03.060 --> 2:31:05.060]  I can't do nothing, I'm a slave
[2:31:05.060 --> 2:31:07.060]  I gotta depend on Big Brother
[2:31:07.060 --> 2:31:09.060]  That's insane
[2:31:09.060 --> 2:31:11.060]  And it's unacceptable
[2:31:11.060 --> 2:31:12.060]  You're not a slave
[2:31:12.060 --> 2:31:15.060]  You don't want to depend on Big Brother
[2:31:15.060 --> 2:31:18.060]  And that's why the press is because they know we got the power
[2:31:18.060 --> 2:31:21.060]  And as we used to say back in the day
[2:31:21.060 --> 2:31:24.060]  In the original Black Panther Party
[2:31:24.060 --> 2:31:27.060]  Not this, it's so-called new Black Panther nonsense
[2:31:27.060 --> 2:31:29.060]  But in the original party
[2:31:29.060 --> 2:31:33.060]  Formed in Oakland, California in 1966
[2:31:33.060 --> 2:31:36.060]  We said all power to the people
[2:31:36.060 --> 2:31:38.060]  Black, white, brown, red, yellow
[2:31:38.060 --> 2:31:40.060]  Okay, our people
[2:31:40.060 --> 2:31:44.060]  Alright, so I get a little passionate about it
[2:31:44.060 --> 2:31:46.060]  I guess, I can't help it
[2:31:46.060 --> 2:31:47.060]  Let me ask this question
[2:31:47.060 --> 2:31:50.060]  What do you make when it's the opposite of Martin Luther King's common sense and truth
[2:31:50.060 --> 2:31:54.060]  When they literally say white people are inherently evil
[2:31:54.060 --> 2:31:56.060]  Obviously, that's meant to create racial division
[2:31:56.060 --> 2:31:58.060]  And make white people become racist
[2:31:58.060 --> 2:32:00.060]  And white people who were never racist are becoming racist
[2:32:00.060 --> 2:32:03.060]  And I explain to them, I go, this is a plan to make us kill each other
[2:32:03.060 --> 2:32:04.060]  You know that, right?
[2:32:04.060 --> 2:32:05.060]  I mean, this is so damn obvious
[2:32:05.060 --> 2:32:08.060]  And it makes me so mad at Apple and Google
[2:32:08.060 --> 2:32:11.060]  Funding all this while they run slave camps in China
[2:32:11.060 --> 2:32:15.060]  Exactly, and it's all a game
[2:32:15.060 --> 2:32:19.060]  A huge, huge, terrible, bloody game
[2:32:19.060 --> 2:32:24.060]  Okay, of course it would make white people angry
[2:32:24.060 --> 2:32:26.060]  Of course, why?
[2:32:26.060 --> 2:32:30.060]  Because the pigmentation of their skin determines their destiny
[2:32:30.060 --> 2:32:32.060]  Excuse me?
[2:32:32.060 --> 2:32:36.060]  That is insane on one hand
[2:32:36.060 --> 2:32:39.060]  But on the other hand, it's a part of a plan
[2:32:39.060 --> 2:32:43.060]  If you keep pounding people and pushing people
[2:32:43.060 --> 2:32:48.060]  Okay, I'm not saying that there is no racism in this country
[2:32:48.060 --> 2:32:51.060]  Of course, but it's not just in this country
[2:32:51.060 --> 2:32:54.060]  And it's not just on one side
[2:32:54.060 --> 2:32:57.060]  It's in many countries all over the world
[2:32:57.060 --> 2:33:00.060]  By the way, including Communist China
[2:33:00.060 --> 2:33:01.060]  All right?
[2:33:01.060 --> 2:33:05.060]  I find it absolutely amazing
[2:33:05.060 --> 2:33:09.060]  That, you know, people are talking about COVID this, COVID that
[2:33:09.060 --> 2:33:12.060]  All right, COVID is real, it's a real virus
[2:33:12.060 --> 2:33:15.060]  And where was that virus released from?
[2:33:15.060 --> 2:33:20.060]  Hello, it was released from and by Communist China
[2:33:20.060 --> 2:33:21.060]  All right?
[2:33:21.060 --> 2:33:24.060]  The most racist country in the world on record
[2:33:24.060 --> 2:33:27.060]  Absolutely, there's no doubt about that
[2:33:27.060 --> 2:33:32.060]  So I'm not anti-Chinese, but I am anti-Terrany
[2:33:32.060 --> 2:33:37.060]  I am anti the propaganda that we get
[2:33:37.060 --> 2:33:41.060]  That passes for so-called news
[2:33:41.060 --> 2:33:43.060]  It's not news, it's propaganda
[2:33:43.060 --> 2:33:46.060]  And there's a big, big difference
[2:33:46.060 --> 2:33:50.060]  So I think all of us need to grow the freak up
[2:33:50.060 --> 2:33:54.060]  Stand up and understand
[2:33:54.060 --> 2:33:58.060]  Once we understand, there's very little they can do
[2:33:58.060 --> 2:34:01.060]  And they respond to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's race-baiting
[2:34:01.060 --> 2:34:06.060]  How do we respond to Cuomo on CNN saying we need white people to die
[2:34:06.060 --> 2:34:08.060]  Clearly trying to create racial division
[2:34:08.060 --> 2:34:11.060]  That's so obviously a divide and conquer
[2:34:11.060 --> 2:34:13.060]  How do we respond to that type of evil?
[2:34:13.060 --> 2:34:18.060]  I respond by saying, oh, so now you're Joseph Stalin, huh?
[2:34:18.060 --> 2:34:21.060]  Now you're Benito Mussolini, huh?
[2:34:21.060 --> 2:34:25.060]  Now you're, okay, we need to call them out for what they are
[2:34:25.060 --> 2:34:29.060]  Just like I called Joe Biden out with his racist nonsense about
[2:34:29.060 --> 2:34:31.060]  You ain't black if you don't vote for me
[2:34:31.060 --> 2:34:33.060]  That's racist!
[2:34:33.060 --> 2:34:37.060]  That's brutally, mockingly, brutally
[2:34:37.060 --> 2:34:39.060]  We now know you were banned on Twitter for that
[2:34:39.060 --> 2:34:43.060]  So as American, as a human, who just so happens to have brown skin
[2:34:43.060 --> 2:34:47.060]  As a black man, you're not allowed to tell Biden he'd unknown you
[2:34:47.060 --> 2:34:51.060]  Why? Because I'm supposed to be, and you too
[2:34:51.060 --> 2:34:53.060]  We're supposed to be his slaves
[2:34:53.060 --> 2:34:54.060]  His slaves!
[2:34:54.060 --> 2:34:55.060]  Exactly
[2:34:55.060 --> 2:34:57.060]  And I'm not exaggerating
[2:34:57.060 --> 2:35:01.060]  Because a slave continues to be a slave
[2:35:01.060 --> 2:35:04.060]  If his or her mind is controlled
[2:35:04.060 --> 2:35:07.060]  Oh my God, so sickening to see this man
[2:35:07.060 --> 2:35:08.060]  He's disgusting
[2:35:08.060 --> 2:35:10.060]  It is over the top to say to somebody
[2:35:10.060 --> 2:35:13.060]  You don't have your identity unless I say so
[2:35:13.060 --> 2:35:15.060]  That's a cult!
[2:35:15.060 --> 2:35:19.060]  Jesus, you don't exist unless you do what I say
[2:35:19.060 --> 2:35:22.060]  That's Jim Jones crap
[2:35:22.060 --> 2:35:27.060]  It's Jim Jones, it's also real mass-dislaid relation
[2:35:27.060 --> 2:35:31.060]  Real, and as far as Pamela Harris is concerned
[2:35:31.060 --> 2:35:33.060]  Who is she?
[2:35:33.060 --> 2:35:35.060]  Where did she come from?
[2:35:35.060 --> 2:35:41.060]  You know, I do know that her formative years were spent in Canada
[2:35:41.060 --> 2:35:43.060]  Not the United States, but in Canada
[2:35:43.060 --> 2:35:45.060]  That's where her formative years were spent
[2:35:45.060 --> 2:35:47.060]  But let's get beyond that
[2:35:47.060 --> 2:35:50.060]  You know, she's like a chameleon
[2:35:50.060 --> 2:35:54.060]  Today she's black, tomorrow she's East Indian
[2:35:54.060 --> 2:35:58.060]  You know, whatever, whatever serves their purpose
[2:35:58.060 --> 2:36:00.060]  Of divide and conquer
[2:36:00.060 --> 2:36:04.060]  So, you know, Pamela Harris is a sick joke
[2:36:04.060 --> 2:36:09.060]  She hurt more black people, and specifically black family
[2:36:09.060 --> 2:36:13.060]  In California, when she was a prosecutor
[2:36:13.060 --> 2:36:16.060]  Than at any, any other time
[2:36:16.060 --> 2:36:17.060]  Well, that's the question I've got
[2:36:17.060 --> 2:36:20.060]  Because even liberals have meant she was the most vicious prosecutor
[2:36:20.060 --> 2:36:21.060]  Probably in modern U.S. history and stuff
[2:36:21.060 --> 2:36:23.060]  People, why does she have such a heart on her
[2:36:23.060 --> 2:36:25.060]  Against black people in 20 seconds?
[2:36:25.060 --> 2:36:28.060]  Well, you know, she may call herself black
[2:36:28.060 --> 2:36:31.060]  But she's a creature, she's a globalist
[2:36:31.060 --> 2:36:35.060]  She wants power, power, power, nothing else
[2:36:35.060 --> 2:36:36.060]  And blacks were a disadvantaged group
[2:36:36.060 --> 2:36:38.060]  She could put in private presence
[2:36:38.060 --> 2:36:40.060]  And try back with Larry Pinkney straight ahead
[2:36:40.060 --> 2:36:43.060]  To lay out the path to human victory
[2:36:43.060 --> 2:36:45.060]  Together, defeating the globalists
[2:36:45.060 --> 2:37:14.060]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021
[2:37:14.060 --> 2:37:16.060]  And if you love freedom and justice
[2:37:16.060 --> 2:37:18.060]  And if you love our innocent children
[2:37:18.060 --> 2:37:20.060]  We are brothers and sisters together
[2:37:20.060 --> 2:37:23.060]  And it has just been an incredible experience
[2:37:23.060 --> 2:37:24.060]  To work with you over the years
[2:37:24.060 --> 2:37:26.060]  And as crazy your things are
[2:37:26.060 --> 2:37:28.060]  I want to keep working under the future
[2:37:28.060 --> 2:37:31.060]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God
[2:37:31.060 --> 2:37:34.060]  So please, I hope God works through you
[2:37:34.060 --> 2:37:36.060]  And puts a message in your heart to support us
[2:37:36.060 --> 2:37:39.060]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God
[2:37:39.060 --> 2:37:41.060]  I just want to thank you all for the years
[2:37:41.060 --> 2:37:43.060]  Of support you've given us and what you've done
[2:37:43.060 --> 2:37:45.060]  And just ask you again to pray to God
[2:37:45.060 --> 2:37:47.060]  And ask what God's vision is for you
[2:37:47.060 --> 2:37:49.060]  And hopefully God will touch your heart
[2:37:49.060 --> 2:37:50.060]  To continue to support Him for worse
[2:37:50.060 --> 2:37:52.060]  God bless
[2:37:52.060 --> 2:37:54.060]  As negative as times are right now
[2:37:54.060 --> 2:37:57.060]  And as depressing as things can be
[2:37:57.060 --> 2:38:00.060]  You have to understand that this is all a test
[2:38:00.060 --> 2:38:03.060]  This experience, this life on this planet
[2:38:03.060 --> 2:38:06.060]  Is a reckoning
[2:38:06.060 --> 2:38:09.060]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out
[2:38:09.060 --> 2:38:11.060]  With third dimension
[2:38:11.060 --> 2:38:13.060]  So we can decide where we want to spend eternity
[2:38:13.060 --> 2:38:15.060]  And what level we want to go to
[2:38:15.060 --> 2:38:17.060]  And it really does come down to that
[2:38:17.060 --> 2:38:19.060]  So as sad as things are
[2:38:19.060 --> 2:38:20.060]  And as evil as things are
[2:38:20.060 --> 2:38:21.060]  Look at all the good in the world as well
[2:38:21.060 --> 2:38:25.060]  And realize that God is the author of our consciousness
[2:38:25.060 --> 2:38:28.060]  God is the author of us having our own will
[2:38:28.060 --> 2:38:31.060]  God is the author of us having free will
[2:38:31.060 --> 2:38:35.060]  And that free will is a beautiful thing
[2:38:35.060 --> 2:38:37.060]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood
[2:38:37.060 --> 2:38:39.060]  And this whole evil culture in Washington, DC
[2:38:39.060 --> 2:38:42.060]  And Fauci and the mass cult
[2:38:42.060 --> 2:38:44.060]  It's all about dominating your free will
[2:38:44.060 --> 2:38:46.060]  It's all about telling you you're dirty
[2:38:46.060 --> 2:38:47.060]  And you're ugly and you're in the bad
[2:38:47.060 --> 2:38:48.060]  Because Satan hates you
[2:38:48.060 --> 2:38:50.060]  Because you're made in the image of God
[2:38:50.060 --> 2:39:18.060]  The creator of the universe
[2:39:18.060 --> 2:39:20.060]  To then flood us with the third world
[2:39:20.060 --> 2:39:22.060]  That the UN will use as a weapon
[2:39:22.060 --> 2:39:24.060]  To then have us under such a crisis
[2:39:24.060 --> 2:39:25.060]  Under such a load
[2:39:25.060 --> 2:39:27.060]  Capitulate to the UN
[2:39:27.060 --> 2:39:29.060]  Whatever agreements they want us to sign
[2:39:29.060 --> 2:39:31.060]  Hoping that they will stop the flood
[2:39:31.060 --> 2:39:33.060]  Of tens of millions of refugees
[2:39:33.060 --> 2:39:36.060]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change
[2:39:36.060 --> 2:39:38.060]  As the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying
[2:39:38.060 --> 2:39:39.060]  And Bill Gates are saying
[2:39:39.060 --> 2:39:42.060]  But fleeing the year long lockdowns
[2:39:42.060 --> 2:39:45.060]  That the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute
[2:39:45.060 --> 2:39:48.060]  Or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money
[2:39:48.060 --> 2:39:51.060]  And that's why we have to really get educated
[2:39:51.060 --> 2:39:52.060]  About the globalists
[2:39:52.060 --> 2:39:54.060]  A hundred and seventy years ago
[2:39:54.060 --> 2:39:57.060]  The British royal family financed scientists
[2:39:57.060 --> 2:40:01.060]  To develop a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide
[2:40:01.060 --> 2:40:03.060]  That grew into the robber barons
[2:40:03.060 --> 2:40:05.060]  And then into the eugenics movement, Kettler
[2:40:05.060 --> 2:40:06.060]  And of course the rest is history
[2:40:06.060 --> 2:40:09.060]  Our film, in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[2:40:09.060 --> 2:40:12.060]  Has been censored on Amazon and many other big platforms
[2:40:12.060 --> 2:40:14.060]  Sending the documentary film
[2:40:14.060 --> 2:40:16.060]  That to the top of the charts
[2:40:16.060 --> 2:40:19.060]  It's been selling online for as much as $300 a copy
[2:40:19.060 --> 2:40:21.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have mass produced it again
[2:40:21.060 --> 2:40:23.060]  In the highest quality HD
[2:40:23.060 --> 2:40:25.060]  It is available after not being available for years
[2:40:25.060 --> 2:40:27.060]  At infowarstore.com
[2:40:27.060 --> 2:40:30.060]  We're selling it for $14.95 for one copy
[2:40:30.060 --> 2:40:32.060]  As low as $3.95 when you buy them in bulk
[2:40:32.060 --> 2:40:33.060]  To share with your friends and family
[2:40:33.060 --> 2:40:36.060]  And every DVD has a zero country code
[2:40:36.060 --> 2:40:38.060]  Meaning you can burn copies of it
[2:40:38.060 --> 2:40:39.060]  Anywhere in the world
[2:40:39.060 --> 2:40:42.060]  I'm asking you to, I'm begging you to
[2:40:42.060 --> 2:40:44.060]  Just don't predict the great reset
[2:40:44.060 --> 2:40:46.060]  The new order takeover, the fake virus
[2:40:46.060 --> 2:40:47.060]  And so much more
[2:40:47.060 --> 2:40:49.060]  That's why the film is evergreen
[2:40:49.060 --> 2:40:50.060]  And more explosive than ever
[2:40:50.060 --> 2:41:14.060]  Get it today at infowarstore.com
[2:41:14.060 --> 2:41:21.060]  So here's the deal
[2:41:21.060 --> 2:41:24.060]  The big globalist assault is here
[2:41:24.060 --> 2:41:26.060]  All over the world they're just doing
[2:41:26.060 --> 2:41:30.060]  Human animal cloning, division, slave camps
[2:41:30.060 --> 2:41:33.060]  All over Africa, all over China
[2:41:33.060 --> 2:41:35.060]  Wars are breaking out everywhere
[2:41:35.060 --> 2:41:37.060]  Evil is taking over
[2:41:37.060 --> 2:41:39.060]  But there's going to be good rising against that
[2:41:39.060 --> 2:41:41.060]  Really positive things are happening as well
[2:41:41.060 --> 2:41:42.060]  Because that's how the paradox works
[2:41:42.060 --> 2:41:45.060]  I mean, Newtonian physics did not invent physics
[2:41:45.060 --> 2:41:47.060]  It was just noticing laws of the universe
[2:41:47.060 --> 2:41:49.060]  And for every action there's an opposite
[2:41:49.060 --> 2:41:50.060]  Equal reaction
[2:41:50.060 --> 2:41:52.060]  So Larry Pickney, I really respect you
[2:41:52.060 --> 2:41:54.060]  Because I know the great work you did
[2:41:54.060 --> 2:41:55.060]  And what you tried to do
[2:41:55.060 --> 2:41:57.060]  And how you tried to empower people together
[2:41:57.060 --> 2:41:59.060]  And how you got targeted under COINTEL PRO
[2:41:59.060 --> 2:42:00.060]  And all the rest of it
[2:42:00.060 --> 2:42:04.060]  And you're 40, 50, I guess it's 50, 60 years of fighting
[2:42:04.060 --> 2:42:07.060]  Against tyranny and being censored and attacked for it
[2:42:07.060 --> 2:42:09.060]  You're a voice people need to hear
[2:42:09.060 --> 2:42:11.060]  A voice people need to know
[2:42:11.060 --> 2:42:13.060]  I was talking to Darren McBreen
[2:42:13.060 --> 2:42:15.060]  Who I know you're friends with for over 10 years
[2:42:15.060 --> 2:42:17.060]  Maybe we should probably get you guys to a weekly podcast
[2:42:17.060 --> 2:42:18.060]  Or something at Band-Aw Video
[2:42:18.060 --> 2:42:20.060]  Because your voice needs to be heard on the latest topics
[2:42:20.060 --> 2:42:22.060]  But I'm intrigued
[2:42:22.060 --> 2:42:24.060]  Say whatever it is you wanted to get to
[2:42:24.060 --> 2:42:25.060]  But I also wanted to ask you
[2:42:25.060 --> 2:42:27.060]  You say a very positive time
[2:42:27.060 --> 2:42:29.060]  And I agree in my spirit, my gut
[2:42:29.060 --> 2:42:30.060]  It's a lot smarter in my brain
[2:42:30.060 --> 2:42:32.060]  It says, hey, things are good, Alex
[2:42:32.060 --> 2:42:33.060]  Don't get depressed
[2:42:33.060 --> 2:42:35.060]  Because I do get depressed and upset
[2:42:35.060 --> 2:42:36.060]  Things are going to work out
[2:42:36.060 --> 2:42:38.060]  So any other points you want to make
[2:42:38.060 --> 2:42:39.060]  We got one segment left
[2:42:39.060 --> 2:42:42.060]  But also, why are you saying things are positive
[2:42:42.060 --> 2:42:44.060]  In the midst of such problems?
[2:42:44.060 --> 2:42:46.060]  Well, I'm saying things are positive
[2:42:46.060 --> 2:42:49.060]  In the midst of these challenges, if you will
[2:42:49.060 --> 2:42:53.060]  Because if they weren't positive
[2:42:53.060 --> 2:42:56.060]  We would not be having these challenges
[2:42:56.060 --> 2:42:57.060]  All right?
[2:42:57.060 --> 2:43:00.060]  And you might say, well, what the heck does that mean?
[2:43:00.060 --> 2:43:03.060]  What it means is obviously
[2:43:03.060 --> 2:43:08.060]  The globalist, the elitist, the real genuine racist
[2:43:08.060 --> 2:43:09.060]  Okay?
[2:43:09.060 --> 2:43:12.060]  The real fascists are pushing their program
[2:43:12.060 --> 2:43:17.060]  Because, look, brother, they not only hate us
[2:43:17.060 --> 2:43:19.060]  And by us, I mean humanity
[2:43:19.060 --> 2:43:21.060]  They fear us
[2:43:21.060 --> 2:43:23.060]  And once we understand that
[2:43:23.060 --> 2:43:27.060]  We realize that we are the ones who have the power
[2:43:27.060 --> 2:43:29.060]  We the people
[2:43:29.060 --> 2:43:30.060]  As our constitution
[2:43:30.060 --> 2:43:32.060]  We want to keep us fighting with each other
[2:43:32.060 --> 2:43:33.060]  What color we are
[2:43:33.060 --> 2:43:35.060]  Our power is coming together
[2:43:35.060 --> 2:43:36.060]  If the situation was hopeless
[2:43:36.060 --> 2:43:38.060]  Their propaganda would be unnecessary
[2:43:38.060 --> 2:43:40.060]  That's my point
[2:43:40.060 --> 2:43:42.060]  You said it far better than I did
[2:43:42.060 --> 2:43:43.060]  Well, that's the famous way
[2:43:43.060 --> 2:43:44.060]  No one knows who said it, brother
[2:43:44.060 --> 2:43:45.060]  I didn't say it
[2:43:45.060 --> 2:43:46.060]  It's what you just said organically
[2:43:46.060 --> 2:43:47.060]  Put it back up there
[2:43:47.060 --> 2:43:48.060]  Put it back up there
[2:43:48.060 --> 2:43:49.060]  Well, you're correct
[2:43:49.060 --> 2:43:51.060]  You're absolutely correct
[2:43:51.060 --> 2:43:53.060]  Keep going, brother
[2:43:53.060 --> 2:43:54.060]  Wow
[2:43:54.060 --> 2:43:56.060]  Well, let me just say this
[2:43:56.060 --> 2:44:01.060]  You know, I don't consider myself deeply necessarily religious
[2:44:01.060 --> 2:44:04.060]  I do consider myself spiritual
[2:44:04.060 --> 2:44:07.060]  And one of the quotes from the Bible
[2:44:07.060 --> 2:44:08.060]  And I want to just throw this out
[2:44:08.060 --> 2:44:11.060]  I read many books, including the Bible
[2:44:11.060 --> 2:44:12.060]  All right?
[2:44:12.060 --> 2:44:15.060]  But one of the quotes that I love so much
[2:44:15.060 --> 2:44:20.060]  Is in the book of James, chapter 2, verse 26
[2:44:20.060 --> 2:44:21.060]  Okay?
[2:44:21.060 --> 2:44:24.060]  And it says that faith
[2:44:24.060 --> 2:44:26.060]  And we should have faith
[2:44:26.060 --> 2:44:29.060]  But it says that faith without work
[2:44:29.060 --> 2:44:30.060]  Is dead
[2:44:30.060 --> 2:44:31.060]  Is dead
[2:44:31.060 --> 2:44:32.060]  All right?
[2:44:32.060 --> 2:44:36.060]  Let us, let our faith, our faiths, plural
[2:44:36.060 --> 2:44:38.060]  Let it be living
[2:44:38.060 --> 2:44:40.060]  Let it be living
[2:44:40.060 --> 2:44:42.060]  Let it be a living faith
[2:44:42.060 --> 2:44:44.060]  Don't give a rat's petonia
[2:44:44.060 --> 2:44:47.060]  What the globalist tries to do
[2:44:47.060 --> 2:44:50.060]  Our faith is alive and it is living
[2:44:50.060 --> 2:44:51.060]  That's right
[2:44:51.060 --> 2:44:52.060]  Stop giving them all the power
[2:44:52.060 --> 2:44:54.060]  We need to move
[2:44:54.060 --> 2:44:55.060]  That's right
[2:44:55.060 --> 2:44:56.060]  You said it
[2:44:56.060 --> 2:44:57.060]  That's right
[2:44:57.060 --> 2:44:59.060]  We need to move
[2:44:59.060 --> 2:45:02.060]  We are the modus and the modi for change
[2:45:02.060 --> 2:45:06.060]  For bringing, getting our republic back
[2:45:06.060 --> 2:45:08.060]  Like Curtis Mayfield said
[2:45:08.060 --> 2:45:10.060]  Back to living again
[2:45:10.060 --> 2:45:11.060]  And you know what?
[2:45:11.060 --> 2:45:13.060]  That's what we are going to do
[2:45:13.060 --> 2:45:16.060]  And we're not going to let these
[2:45:16.060 --> 2:45:19.060]  Sit, demented, despicable
[2:45:19.060 --> 2:45:20.060]  Okay?
[2:45:20.060 --> 2:45:23.060]  Globalists and their neoliberal fascists
[2:45:23.060 --> 2:45:24.060]  Because that's what they are
[2:45:24.060 --> 2:45:26.060]  They are neoliberal fascists
[2:45:26.060 --> 2:45:27.060]  All right?
[2:45:27.060 --> 2:45:29.060]  We're not going to let them stop them
[2:45:29.060 --> 2:45:31.060]  We shall not bend
[2:45:31.060 --> 2:45:32.060]  We shall not
[2:45:32.060 --> 2:45:34.060]  You are my brother
[2:45:34.060 --> 2:45:37.060]  And I have millions of other brothers and sisters
[2:45:37.060 --> 2:45:39.060]  Of all colors out there
[2:45:39.060 --> 2:45:40.060]  And I say again
[2:45:40.060 --> 2:45:41.060]  All power to defeat
[2:45:41.060 --> 2:45:42.060]  That's right
[2:45:42.060 --> 2:45:43.060]  What's beautiful about this is
[2:45:43.060 --> 2:45:45.060]  I know you, whether you're black, white, Asian
[2:45:45.060 --> 2:45:46.060]  Whatever
[2:45:46.060 --> 2:45:48.060]  If you love God and humanity
[2:45:48.060 --> 2:45:49.060]  You're empowered
[2:45:49.060 --> 2:45:50.060]  You're well-spoken
[2:45:50.060 --> 2:45:51.060]  You got energy
[2:45:51.060 --> 2:45:52.060]  Everybody likes this
[2:45:52.060 --> 2:45:54.060]  And then you look at these globalists
[2:45:54.060 --> 2:45:55.060]  They're so unhappy
[2:45:55.060 --> 2:45:56.060]  They're so alone
[2:45:56.060 --> 2:45:58.060]  And that's what slaves the evil
[2:45:58.060 --> 2:45:59.060]  I feel sorry for them
[2:45:59.060 --> 2:46:01.060]  Like, why don't they know what we know?
[2:46:01.060 --> 2:46:03.060]  What happened to them, Larry?
[2:46:03.060 --> 2:46:04.060]  Because we could have no money
[2:46:04.060 --> 2:46:05.060]  But we're rich in spirit
[2:46:05.060 --> 2:46:07.060]  They don't have any of this
[2:46:07.060 --> 2:46:08.060]  They're miserable
[2:46:08.060 --> 2:46:10.060]  They're miserable creatures
[2:46:10.060 --> 2:46:12.060]  They have lost their humanity
[2:46:12.060 --> 2:46:15.060]  I call them so less
[2:46:15.060 --> 2:46:17.060]  They are so less
[2:46:17.060 --> 2:46:19.060]  They have lost their souls
[2:46:19.060 --> 2:46:20.060]  I don't know how
[2:46:20.060 --> 2:46:21.060]  I don't know why
[2:46:21.060 --> 2:46:23.060]  But I know they are so less
[2:46:23.060 --> 2:46:24.060]  They ain't got it
[2:46:24.060 --> 2:46:25.060]  We
[2:46:25.060 --> 2:46:26.060]  And we're not arrogant about it
[2:46:26.060 --> 2:46:28.060]  We're praised God for it
[2:46:28.060 --> 2:46:29.060]  But exactly, they hate us
[2:46:29.060 --> 2:46:31.060]  Because we still got soul
[2:46:31.060 --> 2:46:32.060]  That's right
[2:46:32.060 --> 2:46:33.060]  That's right
[2:46:33.060 --> 2:46:35.060]  And let's remember that
[2:46:35.060 --> 2:46:37.060]  Let's stop letting these people
[2:46:37.060 --> 2:46:39.060]  Dis-empower us
[2:46:39.060 --> 2:46:41.060]  With all their insanity
[2:46:41.060 --> 2:46:44.060]  Because the insanity
[2:46:44.060 --> 2:46:46.060]  Is a part of the game plan
[2:46:46.060 --> 2:46:50.060]  Don't be bamboozled, as Brother Malcolm said
[2:46:50.060 --> 2:46:53.060]  Don't be bamboozled
[2:46:53.060 --> 2:46:55.060]  It's a part of the game plan
[2:46:55.060 --> 2:46:58.060]  To control and to manipulate us
[2:46:58.060 --> 2:47:00.060]  What was Malcolm saying today?
[2:47:00.060 --> 2:47:01.060]  Malcolm mentioned it live today
[2:47:01.060 --> 2:47:02.060]  What would he say?
[2:47:02.060 --> 2:47:04.060]  Oh, my God
[2:47:04.060 --> 2:47:05.060]  Oh, my God
[2:47:05.060 --> 2:47:07.060]  I was saying to another person
[2:47:07.060 --> 2:47:08.060]  Just a few days ago
[2:47:08.060 --> 2:47:10.060]  I said, please don't take this wrong
[2:47:10.060 --> 2:47:12.060]  But I'm so glad that Malcolm
[2:47:12.060 --> 2:47:14.060]  Did not have to see this
[2:47:14.060 --> 2:47:15.060]  For that matter
[2:47:15.060 --> 2:47:17.060]  I'm so glad my own father
[2:47:17.060 --> 2:47:18.060]  Who I love dearly
[2:47:18.060 --> 2:47:21.060]  Who was a U.S. Army veteran
[2:47:21.060 --> 2:47:23.060]  Korean war vet, alright?
[2:47:23.060 --> 2:47:26.060]  But I'm glad that he didn't have to see
[2:47:26.060 --> 2:47:29.060]  This sick insanity
[2:47:29.060 --> 2:47:32.060]  They hate everything that they cannot control
[2:47:32.060 --> 2:47:33.060]  But you know what?
[2:47:33.060 --> 2:47:34.060]  Well, that's it
[2:47:34.060 --> 2:47:35.060]  They just want control, period
[2:47:35.060 --> 2:47:37.060]  People say, what's the mode of control?
[2:47:37.060 --> 2:47:39.060]  And if that means making us a zombie
[2:47:39.060 --> 2:47:40.060]  They're gonna do it
[2:47:40.060 --> 2:47:41.060]  That's right
[2:47:41.060 --> 2:47:42.060]  It's power
[2:47:42.060 --> 2:47:44.060]  Not people power
[2:47:44.060 --> 2:47:46.060]  It's globalist power
[2:47:46.060 --> 2:47:48.060]  It's how can I take over you
[2:47:48.060 --> 2:47:49.060]  Manipulate you
[2:47:49.060 --> 2:47:51.060]  Your family
[2:47:51.060 --> 2:47:52.060]  You know, there was a thing
[2:47:52.060 --> 2:47:53.060]  That Richard Pryor did one time
[2:47:53.060 --> 2:47:54.060]  And he said
[2:47:54.060 --> 2:47:56.060]  The judge said to Richard
[2:47:56.060 --> 2:47:57.060]  It was kind of funny
[2:47:57.060 --> 2:47:59.060]  And kind of sad at the same time
[2:47:59.060 --> 2:48:00.060]  The judge said to
[2:48:00.060 --> 2:48:03.060]  Boy, he said
[2:48:03.060 --> 2:48:05.060]  I'm gonna take everything from you
[2:48:05.060 --> 2:48:06.060]  You got any dreams?
[2:48:06.060 --> 2:48:08.060]  I'm gonna take them too
[2:48:08.060 --> 2:48:09.060]  Okay
[2:48:09.060 --> 2:48:10.060]  You know
[2:48:10.060 --> 2:48:13.060]  And that's exactly what the globalists
[2:48:13.060 --> 2:48:14.060]  Are saying
[2:48:14.060 --> 2:48:15.060]  They're dream stealers
[2:48:15.060 --> 2:48:17.060]  I'm gonna take them too
[2:48:17.060 --> 2:48:20.060]  But we're not gonna let them take it
[2:48:20.060 --> 2:48:21.060]  We've got to create art
[2:48:21.060 --> 2:48:22.060]  We've got to interface
[2:48:22.060 --> 2:48:23.060]  We've got to love each other
[2:48:23.060 --> 2:48:25.060]  And we've got to get past being concerned
[2:48:25.060 --> 2:48:27.060]  Like, oh, you're racist because you're white
[2:48:27.060 --> 2:48:28.060]  So I'm gonna growl to the left
[2:48:28.060 --> 2:48:30.060]  No, you transcend
[2:48:30.060 --> 2:48:31.060]  Or I'm racist because I'm black
[2:48:31.060 --> 2:48:32.060]  So I'm gonna do what the left said
[2:48:32.060 --> 2:48:33.060]  No, I'm gonna transcend that
[2:48:33.060 --> 2:48:34.060]  And expose the whole thing
[2:48:34.060 --> 2:48:36.060]  Stop being intimidated
[2:48:36.060 --> 2:48:37.060]  Stop letting them tell you
[2:48:37.060 --> 2:48:38.060]  You're dirty and bad
[2:48:38.060 --> 2:48:39.060]  Because the devil is the accuser
[2:48:39.060 --> 2:48:41.060]  He tells you you're bad
[2:48:41.060 --> 2:48:43.060]  So you don't follow your impetus with God
[2:48:43.060 --> 2:48:45.060]  So he can run things
[2:48:45.060 --> 2:48:46.060]  That's right
[2:48:46.060 --> 2:48:48.060]  And that's, I mean, it's simple
[2:48:48.060 --> 2:48:50.060]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist
[2:48:50.060 --> 2:48:53.060]  Or physicist to figure that out
[2:48:53.060 --> 2:48:56.060]  Use our common sense
[2:48:56.060 --> 2:48:59.060]  God, look, just our common sense
[2:48:59.060 --> 2:49:00.060]  What God already gave us
[2:49:00.060 --> 2:49:02.060]  All right, well, they took you off Twitter
[2:49:02.060 --> 2:49:04.060]  So on Skype, I'm gonna give that out
[2:49:04.060 --> 2:49:06.060]  But you've been spinning on Twitter
[2:49:06.060 --> 2:49:08.060]  Blackactivistwg.org
[2:49:08.060 --> 2:49:10.060]  Blackagmis.org
[2:49:10.060 --> 2:49:11.060]  Everybody should interview you
[2:49:11.060 --> 2:49:12.060]  I appreciate you
[2:49:12.060 --> 2:49:13.060]  I know you're busy
[2:49:13.060 --> 2:49:15.060]  And in their opinion, we love you, my friend
[2:49:15.060 --> 2:49:16.060]  I bless you
[2:49:16.060 --> 2:49:17.060]  I love you too
[2:49:17.060 --> 2:49:19.060]  And I love all the people supporting
[2:49:19.060 --> 2:49:20.060]  In Four Wars
[2:49:20.060 --> 2:49:21.060]  All power to the people
[2:49:21.060 --> 2:49:22.060]  And listen, I know you're busy
[2:49:22.060 --> 2:49:25.060]  But if you'll do a weekly show with McBreen
[2:49:25.060 --> 2:49:28.060]  Commercial-free, millions will watch it, my friend
[2:49:28.060 --> 2:49:30.060]  Well, Darren and I will talk about it
[2:49:30.060 --> 2:49:31.060]  You know I love Darren
[2:49:31.060 --> 2:49:32.060]  He's my brother
[2:49:32.060 --> 2:49:34.060]  Absolutely are, God bless you
[2:49:34.060 --> 2:49:36.060]  Yeah, folks, these are frustrating times
[2:49:36.060 --> 2:49:38.060]  And they're painful times
[2:49:38.060 --> 2:49:39.060]  And it's all a setup
[2:49:39.060 --> 2:49:40.060]  Just, if you pull back
[2:49:40.060 --> 2:49:41.060]  And see what's going on
[2:49:41.060 --> 2:49:42.060]  You're gonna be able to overcome it
[2:49:42.060 --> 2:49:45.060]  But it is truly disgusting
[2:49:50.060 --> 2:49:52.060]  We got Papert
[2:49:52.060 --> 2:49:54.060]  Tom Papert's gonna take over in the fourth hour
[2:49:54.060 --> 2:49:56.060]  And I'm bigger, I'm busier
[2:49:56.060 --> 2:49:59.060]  Than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest
[2:49:59.060 --> 2:50:02.060]  I got a lot to do to fund this operation
[2:50:02.060 --> 2:50:04.060]  And I'm not bitchin'
[2:50:04.060 --> 2:50:05.060]  But I don't love money
[2:50:05.060 --> 2:50:07.060]  Money means like fuel in my gas tank
[2:50:07.060 --> 2:50:08.060]  And I can go pay for gas
[2:50:08.060 --> 2:50:09.060]  And get in my car real quick
[2:50:09.060 --> 2:50:10.060]  It's not a problem
[2:50:10.060 --> 2:50:11.060]  It takes me five minutes
[2:50:11.060 --> 2:50:13.060]  Squirreling around, trying to get money
[2:50:13.060 --> 2:50:14.060]  To fund this operation
[2:50:14.060 --> 2:50:16.060]  Drives me frickin' nuts
[2:50:16.060 --> 2:50:18.060]  It is the least happy part of my life
[2:50:18.060 --> 2:50:20.060]  And I'm gonna be squirreling around for five hours
[2:50:20.060 --> 2:50:22.060]  After I get on air to fund this operation
[2:50:22.060 --> 2:50:23.060]  So we can keep fighting
[2:50:23.060 --> 2:50:26.060]  So please do me a favor
[2:50:26.060 --> 2:50:28.060]  Please go buy products you already need for you
[2:50:28.060 --> 2:50:29.060]  And your family, my God
[2:50:29.060 --> 2:50:30.060]  You need the highest quality vitamin D3
[2:50:30.060 --> 2:50:31.060]  We've got it
[2:50:31.060 --> 2:50:33.060]  You need the highest quality vitamin B12
[2:50:33.060 --> 2:50:34.060]  We got it
[2:50:34.060 --> 2:50:36.060]  You need our prostaguard
[2:50:36.060 --> 2:50:38.060]  With the Saupal Meadow and all the vitamins
[2:50:38.060 --> 2:50:39.060]  It's good for men and women
[2:50:39.060 --> 2:50:41.060]  But it's mainly a men's product
[2:50:42.060 --> 2:50:43.060]  It's all there
[2:50:43.060 --> 2:50:45.060]  Infowarsstore.com
[2:50:45.060 --> 2:50:47.060]  And I get very excited
[2:50:47.060 --> 2:50:49.060]  About how much of this in-game we're selling
[2:50:49.060 --> 2:50:51.060]  But the average video is selling
[2:50:51.060 --> 2:50:52.060]  For like $4 a piece
[2:50:52.060 --> 2:50:54.060]  Almost everybody's doing the 510
[2:50:54.060 --> 2:50:56.060]  For $3.95 a piece
[2:50:56.060 --> 2:50:58.060]  Which is fine by one for $14.95
[2:50:58.060 --> 2:51:00.060]  But this is the film that exposes it all
[2:51:00.060 --> 2:51:02.060]  It's available at Infowarsstore.com
[2:51:02.060 --> 2:51:03.060]  And we're selling it right down there
[2:51:03.060 --> 2:51:04.060]  Close to cost
[2:51:04.060 --> 2:51:05.060]  So I hope you get it
[2:51:05.060 --> 2:51:06.060]  And I hope you make copies of it
[2:51:06.060 --> 2:51:07.060]  And I hope you share it
[2:51:07.060 --> 2:51:08.060]  And I hope you get it out
[2:51:08.060 --> 2:51:10.060]  Infowarsstore.com
[2:51:11.060 --> 2:51:12.060]  And again
[2:51:12.060 --> 2:51:13.060]  I'm going to be working hard
[2:51:13.060 --> 2:51:14.060]  For you ladies and gentlemen
[2:51:14.060 --> 2:51:15.060]  As hard as I can
[2:51:15.060 --> 2:51:16.060]  You better believe that
[2:51:17.060 --> 2:51:18.060]  But I'm telling you
[2:51:18.060 --> 2:51:19.060]  You need prostaguard
[2:51:19.060 --> 2:51:20.060]  You need all the power
[2:51:20.060 --> 2:51:21.060]  You need one or two
[2:51:21.060 --> 2:51:23.060]  You need our liquid turmeric formula
[2:51:23.060 --> 2:51:25.060]  The body's been sold out for 6 months
[2:51:25.060 --> 2:51:26.060]  We can't get it supplied
[2:51:26.060 --> 2:51:28.060]  Because the lockdowns and everything
[2:51:28.060 --> 2:51:29.060]  That's sold
[2:51:29.060 --> 2:51:30.060]  But this is another great liquid formula
[2:51:30.060 --> 2:51:32.060]  Infowarsstore.com
[2:51:33.060 --> 2:51:34.060]  And that helps fund
[2:51:34.060 --> 2:51:35.060]  The revolution against tyranny
[2:51:36.060 --> 2:51:37.060]  Alright
[2:51:37.060 --> 2:51:38.060]  Power
[2:51:38.060 --> 2:51:39.060]  Straight ahead and stick with us
[2:51:42.060 --> 2:51:43.060]  So many people say to me
[2:51:43.060 --> 2:51:45.060]  Alex, please stop being so negative
[2:51:46.060 --> 2:51:47.060]  Well, for me
[2:51:47.060 --> 2:51:49.060]  Admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth
[2:51:49.060 --> 2:51:50.060]  And going into a root canal
[2:51:50.060 --> 2:51:51.060]  Is not negative
[2:51:51.060 --> 2:51:52.060]  It hurts
[2:51:52.060 --> 2:51:53.060]  It stinks
[2:51:53.060 --> 2:51:55.060]  It's got pus coming out of it
[2:51:55.060 --> 2:51:56.060]  I go to the doctor, they fix it
[2:51:56.060 --> 2:51:57.060]  That's not negative
[2:51:57.060 --> 2:51:58.060]  I'm not living in denial
[2:51:59.060 --> 2:52:01.060]  And so think of globalism as being hidden
[2:52:01.060 --> 2:52:03.060]  As an infection that we feel yet
[2:52:03.060 --> 2:52:05.060]  But now it's come to the surface
[2:52:05.060 --> 2:52:07.060]  That's actually a positive thing
[2:52:07.060 --> 2:52:08.060]  And so, yeah
[2:52:08.060 --> 2:52:09.060]  Trump did an overall great job
[2:52:09.060 --> 2:52:10.060]  They stole the election
[2:52:10.060 --> 2:52:12.060]  We can't get down about that
[2:52:12.060 --> 2:52:15.060]  We have forced them out in the open
[2:52:16.060 --> 2:52:18.060]  So now they're trying to suppress us
[2:52:18.060 --> 2:52:19.060]  Because they know they've been exposed
[2:52:19.060 --> 2:52:20.060]  They're scared
[2:52:20.060 --> 2:52:21.060]  That's why
[2:52:21.060 --> 2:52:22.060]  Instead of saying
[2:52:22.060 --> 2:52:23.060]  Oh, we're a bunch of losers
[2:52:23.060 --> 2:52:24.060]  Look what happened
[2:52:24.060 --> 2:52:25.060]  No we're a bunch of winners
[2:52:25.060 --> 2:52:26.060]  They're trying to suppress us
[2:52:26.060 --> 2:52:28.060]  Let our light of truth shine
[2:52:28.060 --> 2:52:29.060]  Until everybody
[2:52:29.060 --> 2:52:30.060]  What's happening
[2:52:30.060 --> 2:52:31.060]  Your own website
[2:52:31.060 --> 2:52:32.060]  Your own show
[2:52:32.060 --> 2:52:33.060]  My show
[2:52:33.060 --> 2:52:34.060]  Other articles
[2:52:34.060 --> 2:52:35.060]  And videos
[2:52:35.060 --> 2:52:36.060]  Just keep sharing
[2:52:36.060 --> 2:52:37.060]  However you can
[2:52:37.060 --> 2:52:38.060]  And realize
[2:52:38.060 --> 2:52:39.060]  We're an information war
[2:52:39.060 --> 2:52:40.060]  We're going to win this together
[2:52:40.060 --> 2:52:42.060]  In the Fight Start Simplors.com
[2:52:43.060 --> 2:52:44.060]  Gerald in South Carolina
[2:52:44.060 --> 2:52:45.060]  Go ahead, you're on the air
[2:52:45.060 --> 2:52:46.060]  Trying to move quicker
[2:52:46.060 --> 2:52:47.060]  Hey Alex
[2:52:47.060 --> 2:52:48.060]  Welcome
[2:52:48.060 --> 2:52:49.060]  Would like to say first off
[2:52:49.060 --> 2:52:50.060]  Thanks for being the voice of reason
[2:52:50.060 --> 2:52:52.060]  And amongst all this stupidity
[2:52:52.060 --> 2:52:53.060]  Wanted to warn people
[2:52:53.060 --> 2:52:54.060]  I've been trying to get a hold of you
[2:52:54.060 --> 2:52:55.060]  For a year
[2:52:55.060 --> 2:52:56.060]  Okay
[2:52:56.060 --> 2:52:57.060]  I'm a double amputee
[2:52:57.060 --> 2:52:59.060]  And I have bacteria
[2:52:59.060 --> 2:53:00.060]  Infection on my lung
[2:53:00.060 --> 2:53:02.060]  That'll never go away
[2:53:02.060 --> 2:53:03.060]  Living defense
[2:53:03.060 --> 2:53:04.060]  Saved my life
[2:53:04.060 --> 2:53:06.060]  They had me on antibiotics
[2:53:06.060 --> 2:53:07.060]  For two years
[2:53:07.060 --> 2:53:08.060]  That almost killed me
[2:53:08.060 --> 2:53:09.060]  Living defense
[2:53:09.060 --> 2:53:10.060]  Brought me back
[2:53:10.060 --> 2:53:11.060]  I wanted to
[2:53:11.060 --> 2:53:12.060]  Just quote from the Bible
[2:53:12.060 --> 2:53:13.060]  Jesus is saying
[2:53:13.060 --> 2:53:15.060]  As to where we are right now
[2:53:15.060 --> 2:53:17.060]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9
[2:53:17.060 --> 2:53:19.060]  Then they shall deliver you up
[2:53:19.060 --> 2:53:21.060]  To be afflicted
[2:53:21.060 --> 2:53:23.060]  And shall kill you
[2:53:23.060 --> 2:53:24.060]  And ye shall be hated
[2:53:24.060 --> 2:53:25.060]  Of all nations
[2:53:25.060 --> 2:53:27.060]  For my name's sake
[2:53:27.060 --> 2:53:28.060]  And then shall many
[2:53:28.060 --> 2:53:29.060]  Be offended
[2:53:29.060 --> 2:53:30.060]  And shall betray one another
[2:53:30.060 --> 2:53:32.060]  And shall hate one another
[2:53:32.060 --> 2:53:34.060]  That's right where we're at, brother
[2:53:34.060 --> 2:53:36.060]  And that's because God's name
[2:53:36.060 --> 2:53:37.060]  Is on the founding of this country
[2:53:37.060 --> 2:53:38.060]  No matter what they say
[2:53:38.060 --> 2:53:40.060]  And that's why the enemy hates it
[2:53:40.060 --> 2:53:42.060]  Because God created this country
[2:53:45.060 --> 2:53:48.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:53:48.060 --> 2:53:50.060]  Paul
[2:54:01.060 --> 2:54:03.060]  The final segment of Alex Jones'
[2:54:03.060 --> 2:54:05.060]  He's doing great
[2:54:05.060 --> 2:54:07.060]  Tom Public is in the studio
[2:54:07.060 --> 2:54:08.060]  He ends up national file
[2:54:08.060 --> 2:54:10.060]  Which does a superb job
[2:54:10.060 --> 2:54:11.060]  And then we've got
[2:54:11.060 --> 2:54:12.060]  the Armstrong story in the
[2:54:12.060 --> 2:54:13.060]  war room
[2:54:13.060 --> 2:54:14.060]  Coming up
[2:54:14.060 --> 2:54:14.740]  I have 가볍 lan
[2:54:14.740 --> 2:54:16.240]  I have 10 it's I have 10
[2:54:16.240 --> 2:54:17.060]  Cause tomorrow
[2:54:17.060 --> 2:54:20.820]  try to take 20, 30 calls and actually take calls for at least two hours.
[2:54:20.820 --> 2:54:22.420]  So look for that.
[2:54:22.420 --> 2:54:29.460]  But man, it's very easy to look at crime statistics and to watch black people
[2:54:29.460 --> 2:54:32.140]  being racist and to get into the whole race thing.
[2:54:32.140 --> 2:54:35.060]  But it's still a minority of black folks that are doing that.
[2:54:35.060 --> 2:54:38.300]  But if they're able to trigger a race war, it's going to be a lot of that going on.
[2:54:38.300 --> 2:54:40.140]  And then it's a very real thing.
[2:54:40.140 --> 2:54:43.460]  If you're a white person being attacked by black racists or a black person being
[2:54:43.460 --> 2:54:47.620]  attacked by white racists, it's a very, very real thing.
[2:54:47.620 --> 2:54:51.900]  But they didn't call it racist until about 100 years ago.
[2:54:51.900 --> 2:54:56.020]  They called it tribalism, like crypts and bloods.
[2:54:56.020 --> 2:54:59.860]  People killing each other over what color their shirt is.
[2:54:59.860 --> 2:55:02.300]  Is it red or is it blue?
[2:55:02.300 --> 2:55:08.660]  And humans are designed during crisis, during mob rule, to kind of go under that
[2:55:08.660 --> 2:55:12.180]  type of system.
[2:55:12.180 --> 2:55:13.420]  We have to transcend that.
[2:55:13.420 --> 2:55:14.980]  We have to be rational.
[2:55:14.980 --> 2:55:18.300]  As Larry Pickney said, we must reason together.
[2:55:18.300 --> 2:55:20.340]  You'd say, well, reason's been thrown by the wayside.
[2:55:20.340 --> 2:55:24.700]  OK, then I might as well just quit the show and go join David Rockefeller.
[2:55:24.700 --> 2:55:26.460]  He's dead now, but it's foundation.
[2:55:26.460 --> 2:55:28.420]  Because I mean, I could probably still go join him.
[2:55:28.420 --> 2:55:29.660]  Let's see.
[2:55:29.660 --> 2:55:31.620]  I'm not trying to show off for you.
[2:55:31.620 --> 2:55:35.140]  I have a spiritual relationship.
[2:55:35.140 --> 2:55:42.140]  And that's, that's, I want to call it sexual, but we are the bride of Christ.
[2:55:42.140 --> 2:55:46.740]  You notice all the stuff on TV is like Satan having sex with us.
[2:55:46.740 --> 2:55:48.180]  That's a kind of a primitive view of it.
[2:55:48.180 --> 2:55:51.140]  But I mean, I am taken.
[2:55:51.140 --> 2:55:53.660]  So see, I'm not trying to impress Bill Gates.
[2:55:53.660 --> 2:55:56.740]  I'm not trying to impress George Soros.
[2:55:56.740 --> 2:56:00.740]  I'm not trying to impress Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton or any of those pedophiles.
[2:56:00.740 --> 2:56:05.820]  I'm minute to minute, millisecond to millisecond, spiritually connected.
[2:56:05.820 --> 2:56:10.140]  And I know what the big chief likes.
[2:56:10.140 --> 2:56:14.620]  And the big chief likes goodness and strength and honor and the opposite of cowardice.
[2:56:14.620 --> 2:56:19.940]  You know, it's been said a million times is true cliches are cliches because they're
[2:56:19.940 --> 2:56:20.940]  true.
[2:56:20.940 --> 2:56:23.180]  God hates cowards.
[2:56:23.180 --> 2:56:30.460]  And God loves children, drunks in the United States of America, as von Bismarck said.
[2:56:30.460 --> 2:56:36.100]  So in the final equation, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not doing this for you.
[2:56:36.100 --> 2:56:38.140]  I'm doing it for me.
[2:56:38.140 --> 2:56:40.980]  And that's why when you call and say, oh, you're so great, you're so wonderful, you
[2:56:40.980 --> 2:56:49.420]  think I'm going to join Satan so I can live 30, 40 years and be worshiped by it.
[2:56:49.420 --> 2:56:51.180]  We must reject Hollywood.
[2:56:51.180 --> 2:56:53.060]  We must reject the media.
[2:56:53.060 --> 2:56:55.060]  We must reject the world.
[2:56:55.060 --> 2:56:58.140]  It's a joke.
[2:56:58.140 --> 2:57:01.100]  It's not even a facsimile of what God has.
[2:57:01.100 --> 2:57:04.260]  And I'll tell you lately, I prayed to God for comfort.
[2:57:04.260 --> 2:57:07.980]  I've said it on here and I've done it because I've been in a lot of pain.
[2:57:07.980 --> 2:57:09.940]  I've never said prayers for myself.
[2:57:09.940 --> 2:57:12.980]  I've always said prayers for other people or I've always said prayers, oh my God, God
[2:57:12.980 --> 2:57:13.980]  has so delivered.
[2:57:13.980 --> 2:57:20.740]  Man, I like to go to sleep now and it's like plugging in to a Valhalla.
[2:57:20.740 --> 2:57:28.180]  And it's just crazy, I've never said prayers for myself.
[2:57:28.180 --> 2:57:32.820]  I started doing it just because I've been so stressed out and God has delivered so much
[2:57:32.820 --> 2:57:37.940]  in that quiet place the most I, I mean, I, I, man, once you see this coming, I mean,
[2:57:37.940 --> 2:57:42.740]  I already knew this, I already, I already understood it.
[2:57:42.740 --> 2:57:44.900]  But I could intellectually understand it.
[2:57:44.900 --> 2:57:50.140]  I have now experienced it and the weird thing is the creator of the universe, you're a little
[2:57:50.140 --> 2:57:53.420]  intimidated by, you know, you don't want to ask for stuff or at least everybody else
[2:57:53.420 --> 2:57:54.420]  asked for stuff.
[2:57:54.420 --> 2:57:56.460]  My secret wasn't ever asked for stuff.
[2:57:56.460 --> 2:58:01.420]  But I finally have asked for things and my goodness, have I not received?
[2:58:01.420 --> 2:58:06.060]  I'm just all praise to God and all these Satanists want to make fun of that and attack it.
[2:58:06.060 --> 2:58:07.180]  It's because you're scared of it.
[2:58:07.180 --> 2:58:08.180]  You don't have it.
[2:58:08.180 --> 2:58:09.180]  I wish you had it.
[2:58:09.180 --> 2:58:14.620]  I have no pleasure knowing that as you go into the infinity, as you go into eternity,
[2:58:14.620 --> 2:58:19.260]  as you go into the great abyss and the great Valhalla and the great, whatever it is you're
[2:58:19.260 --> 2:58:22.620]  creating for yourself, that you didn't join with us.
[2:58:22.620 --> 2:58:25.380]  I mean, wow, you are losers.
[2:58:25.380 --> 2:58:27.500]  I have seen the other side.
[2:58:27.500 --> 2:58:29.140]  I have seen the gates of heaven.
[2:58:29.140 --> 2:58:30.380]  I have seen Valhalla.
[2:58:30.380 --> 2:58:33.220]  I have seen the living water, the living water.
[2:58:33.220 --> 2:58:35.540]  Oh my God, it's incredible.
[2:58:35.540 --> 2:58:38.500]  I mean, it is infinity past infinity.
[2:58:38.500 --> 2:58:40.020]  It is absolution.
[2:58:40.020 --> 2:58:41.020]  It is completion.
[2:58:41.020 --> 2:58:42.020]  It is ethereal.
[2:58:42.020 --> 2:58:44.460]  It is merging with the mind of God.
[2:58:44.460 --> 2:58:51.460]  It is the most beautiful thing you could imagine and then some.
[2:58:51.460 --> 2:58:54.260]  The equation is very simple.
[2:58:54.260 --> 2:58:56.060]  The mega banks control the media.
[2:58:56.060 --> 2:58:57.900]  They control big pharma.
[2:58:57.900 --> 2:59:00.460]  They control academia.
[2:59:00.460 --> 2:59:02.900]  They control the military, industrial complex.
[2:59:02.900 --> 2:59:05.020]  They control big tech.
[2:59:05.020 --> 2:59:09.540]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established
[2:59:09.540 --> 2:59:12.740]  absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[2:59:12.740 --> 2:59:19.660]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[2:59:19.660 --> 2:59:22.580]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[2:59:22.580 --> 2:59:28.140]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it upside
[2:59:28.140 --> 2:59:35.620]  down and used the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[2:59:35.620 --> 2:59:38.380]  that threatens their monopoly of control.
[2:59:38.380 --> 2:59:42.420]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[2:59:42.420 --> 2:59:48.140]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[2:59:48.140 --> 2:59:49.140]  So redouble your efforts.
[2:59:49.140 --> 2:59:59.820]  We're all on this together.
[2:59:59.820 --> 3:00:06.820]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:06.820 --> 3:00:29.060]  Maxine Waters, along with major CNN hosts and others are calling for violence and calling
[3:00:29.060 --> 3:00:31.580]  for dead white people.
[3:00:31.580 --> 3:00:33.220]  And you know what the answer is.
[3:00:33.220 --> 3:00:34.220]  You really do.
[3:00:34.220 --> 3:00:35.220]  You don't like it.
[3:00:35.220 --> 3:00:37.220]  It scares me.
[3:00:37.220 --> 3:00:40.220]  Shootings, gun laws, access to weapons.
[3:00:40.220 --> 3:00:42.940]  Oh, I know when they'll change.
[3:00:42.940 --> 3:00:45.380]  Your kids start getting killed.
[3:00:45.380 --> 3:00:49.340]  White people's kids start getting killed.
[3:00:49.340 --> 3:00:53.460]  Smoking at doobie that's actually legal probably in your state now, but they don't know what
[3:00:53.460 --> 3:00:57.460]  it was and then the kid runs and the pop, pop, pop, pop.
[3:00:57.460 --> 3:00:58.460]  Cop was justified.
[3:00:58.460 --> 3:00:59.460]  Why'd you run?
[3:00:59.460 --> 3:01:01.780]  Oh, we had a baseball game tonight.
[3:01:01.780 --> 3:01:03.020]  Oh, a white kid.
[3:01:03.020 --> 3:01:04.020]  Oh, big family.
[3:01:04.020 --> 3:01:05.020]  What is going on with these police?
[3:01:05.020 --> 3:01:06.020]  Oh, what?
[3:01:06.020 --> 3:01:17.220]  Maybe we shouldn't even have police that kind of mania.
[3:01:17.220 --> 3:01:18.220]  That kind of madness.
[3:01:18.220 --> 3:01:19.220]  That'll be you.
[3:01:19.220 --> 3:01:23.660]  That'll be the majority because it's your people.
[3:01:23.660 --> 3:01:30.100]  And then Maxine Waters just came out and said from Minnesota that you need to be more controversial
[3:01:30.100 --> 3:01:39.140]  you need to occupy the streets, you need to be aggressive, she's the same one that said
[3:01:39.140 --> 3:01:41.140]  go and confront Republicans getting their faces.
[3:01:41.140 --> 3:01:48.980]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant in a department store at a gas
[3:01:48.980 --> 3:02:00.660]  station, you get out and you create a crowd and you put back on them and you tell them
[3:02:00.660 --> 3:02:01.660]  they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.
[3:02:01.660 --> 3:02:04.180]  And then she's the same person that says everybody should be charged with terrorism that entered
[3:02:04.180 --> 3:02:06.500]  the Capitol most of them peacefully.
[3:02:06.500 --> 3:02:15.180]  If this had been Black Lives Matter, you know, acting in the way that the old keepers and
[3:02:15.180 --> 3:02:21.420]  the proud boys and the white supremacists had stormed that Capitol, what do you think
[3:02:21.420 --> 3:02:22.420]  would have happened?
[3:02:22.420 --> 3:02:26.500]  Do you think, you know, in essence they would have gotten away with it?
[3:02:26.500 --> 3:02:31.620]  And you know, I got the kind of responses where, you know, everyone was saying, of course,
[3:02:31.620 --> 3:02:35.940]  we know they said it in so many ways, blood would be all over the place.
[3:02:35.940 --> 3:02:37.340]  They would be killed.
[3:02:37.340 --> 3:02:38.340]  They would be shot.
[3:02:38.340 --> 3:02:39.340]  This is so hypocritical.
[3:02:39.340 --> 3:02:40.340]  It's total fraud.
[3:02:40.340 --> 3:02:46.140]  We decry all of this office of violence, but we have multinational corporations that are
[3:02:46.140 --> 3:02:50.940]  dividing and conquering this country right now, and they want to distract us from destroying
[3:02:50.940 --> 3:02:54.420]  our borders, from destroying our dollar, from selling us out to China, from the slave camps
[3:02:54.420 --> 3:02:55.420]  that Apple runs in China.
[3:02:55.420 --> 3:03:00.460]  And that's why all the big corporations have given $10.6 billion the last year to Black
[3:03:00.460 --> 3:03:02.900]  Lives Matter to make that the huge issue.
[3:03:02.900 --> 3:03:07.420]  And within hours of Maxine Waters calling for violence, the National Guard and Police
[3:03:07.420 --> 3:03:10.020]  just got shot at in Minnesota and were almost killed.
[3:03:10.020 --> 3:03:15.180]  This is a designed civil war they're trying to trigger, and we've got to stop it.
[3:03:15.180 --> 3:03:22.260]  To watch Cuomo say this, to watch Maxine Waters say this, while they activate the CIA illegally,
[3:03:22.260 --> 3:03:26.900]  domestically against Trump supporters, because a few hundred people went to Capitol and a
[3:03:26.900 --> 3:03:30.980]  few hundred people might have gotten the fist fight with the cops, now all of us are guilty
[3:03:30.980 --> 3:03:35.660]  while they burned down cities, police stations all across the country last summer, and now
[3:03:35.660 --> 3:03:40.500]  we're heating up and do it again to hold the city's hostage until local governments,
[3:03:40.500 --> 3:03:44.860]  this is the key, turn control their police departments over to George Soros, who already
[3:03:44.860 --> 3:03:51.020]  has most of the DA's, who already has most of the blue city mayors, who already has many
[3:03:51.020 --> 3:03:56.620]  of the state's attorney generals, who will then prosecute police officers who make a
[3:03:56.620 --> 3:04:01.980]  mistake or who are outnumbered to get attacked, to then bully them to politically align with
[3:04:01.980 --> 3:04:05.180]  the left, and then they'll be totally protected.
[3:04:05.180 --> 3:04:08.620]  When the police attack viciously folks for lockdowns, liberals love it.
[3:04:08.620 --> 3:04:13.340]  When the police shoot a white person wrongly, the media loves it, because it's simple divide
[3:04:13.340 --> 3:04:14.340]  and conquer.
[3:04:14.340 --> 3:04:15.340]  This is the takeover.
[3:04:15.340 --> 3:04:24.260]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm Tom Papert, I will be taking over for this
[3:04:24.260 --> 3:04:29.020]  final hour, you know, you just saw a really important, really thorough report from Alex
[3:04:29.020 --> 3:04:33.900]  Jones, which is of course available at Bandai Video, make sure to share that link, but things
[3:04:33.900 --> 3:04:40.220]  have only gotten more bizarre, more insane in the hour since Derek Chauvin was convicted
[3:04:40.220 --> 3:04:45.100]  of of course all three counts, even though they seem mutually exclusive at first glance
[3:04:45.100 --> 3:04:51.020]  of that he was charged with in the case of George Floyd's death, but that's not enough.
[3:04:51.020 --> 3:04:55.860]  We've already seen it for multiple left-wing rioters and protesters on the streets of Minneapolis.
[3:04:55.860 --> 3:05:01.740]  They went out and said they're still not happy, and none of them are happy.
[3:05:01.740 --> 3:05:04.940]  Nobody involved in this, Maxine Waters still doesn't think this is long enough, of course
[3:05:04.940 --> 3:05:12.260]  the same exact day, a police officer in Columbus, Ohio, ended what would have been a horrific
[3:05:12.260 --> 3:05:16.940]  knife fight between children by employing lethal force against one of the people who
[3:05:16.940 --> 3:05:20.660]  was wielding a knife, and that provoked more rioting.
[3:05:20.660 --> 3:05:26.260]  But even in Minneapolis, the cops life is ruined, you may or may not have a strong appeal
[3:05:26.260 --> 3:05:31.020]  depending on how much faith you have in the criminal justice system, but the Biden regime
[3:05:31.020 --> 3:05:33.780]  is not letting Minneapolis off that easily.
[3:05:33.780 --> 3:05:41.620]  The Biden DOJ is now investigating whether Minneapolis police are racist, up at NationalFile.com,
[3:05:41.620 --> 3:05:45.700]  I'm sure it's up soon at InfowarsandNewswars.com.
[3:05:45.700 --> 3:05:51.620]  This is Merrick Garland, Biden's gun grabber, top gun grabber in the country, he's been
[3:05:51.620 --> 3:05:57.180]  fantasizing about gutting the Second Amendment since the year 2000.
[3:05:57.180 --> 3:06:02.620]  Merrick Garland also said that antifa and black lives matter, their riots are not terrorism
[3:06:02.620 --> 3:06:06.980]  because, and you can't make this up, they happen at night.
[3:06:06.980 --> 3:06:10.300]  You see January 6th, that happened during the days, the government was in the middle
[3:06:10.300 --> 3:06:14.660]  of their job, but if it happens at night, according to Merrick Garland, like what we
[3:06:14.660 --> 3:06:19.180]  see in Seattle and in Portland where they're attacking a poor courthouse, that courthouse
[3:06:19.180 --> 3:06:24.460]  has been under siege for like two years now, well that happens at night, so it's not interfering
[3:06:24.460 --> 3:06:29.220]  with the daily business of the federal government and therefore it's not terrorism, well now
[3:06:29.220 --> 3:06:32.940]  Merrick Garland, Merrick Garland also said by the way that he's going to do everything
[3:06:32.940 --> 3:06:38.020]  he can to make sure that liberal journalists are treated with respect, that's our Attorney
[3:06:38.020 --> 3:06:41.580]  General now, if you thought Jeff Sessions was bad, if you thought Bill Barr was bad,
[3:06:41.580 --> 3:06:46.540]  this guy somehow makes them look good, but this is what he said earlier today, yesterday's
[3:06:46.540 --> 3:06:53.060]  verdict in the state criminal trial does not address potentially systemic policing issues
[3:06:53.060 --> 3:06:58.820]  in Minneapolis, the Justice Department has opened a civil investigation to determine
[3:06:58.820 --> 3:07:04.020]  whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional
[3:07:04.020 --> 3:07:10.580]  or unlawful policing, so already you can see, you know there were a lot of conservatives
[3:07:10.580 --> 3:07:14.900]  out there, Greg Gutfeld at Fox News, I think he was trying to be funny, wasn't funny at
[3:07:14.900 --> 3:07:19.700]  all as far as I'm concerned, but he came out right and said, well I don't think he was
[3:07:19.700 --> 3:07:24.940]  guilty, I don't think he deserves to go to prison, but I'm glad, because now at least
[3:07:24.940 --> 3:07:31.940]  we won't have riots, how naive to think that this is really it, that it's over now, that
[3:07:31.940 --> 3:07:38.780]  it's done, because Chauvin goes to jail, as Nancy Pelosi said, George Floyd gave his life
[3:07:38.780 --> 3:07:43.740]  in the name of justice, but no, it's never going to be done, and Alex Chauvin just talked
[3:07:43.740 --> 3:07:48.900]  about this here on this very broadcast all the time, it's paying the pirate, that jury
[3:07:48.900 --> 3:07:54.100]  paid the pirate, now the pirate, the riot mobs, now they know that all they have to do
[3:07:54.100 --> 3:07:58.420]  is go out and riot and pillage and burn and loot and murder and rape and do everything
[3:07:58.420 --> 3:08:02.740]  else, you can imagine, look at what happened on the streets of Seattle during Chaz, now
[3:08:02.740 --> 3:08:08.500]  they know, all you have to go out there, all you have to do is go out and raise hell, and
[3:08:08.500 --> 3:08:14.700]  you get whatever you want, and Merrick Garland, the top attorney in the country, the Department
[3:08:14.700 --> 3:08:20.740]  of Justice, the Biden regime, Joe Biden himself, they will come out and they will work for
[3:08:20.740 --> 3:08:24.940]  your cause, so there you have it, now they're going to be investigated, it will be staffed
[3:08:24.940 --> 3:08:28.580]  by experienced attorneys, another personnel from the Justice Department's Civil Rights
[3:08:28.580 --> 3:08:33.620]  Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office in the district of Minnesota, the new civil investigation
[3:08:33.620 --> 3:08:40.460]  is separate from any charges, any conviction against Derek Chauvin, so it's not going
[3:08:40.460 --> 3:08:43.780]  to end, they're going to keep doing this, they're going to keep pushing, they're going
[3:08:43.780 --> 3:08:49.900]  to keep restocking the flames of racial hatred in this country, which is really the most
[3:08:49.900 --> 3:08:55.180]  disgusting thing, this country has no racial problem except the fact that you have people
[3:08:55.180 --> 3:08:59.140]  like Maxine Waters, people like Joe Biden, people like Al Sharpton, who go and stoke
[3:08:59.140 --> 3:09:03.140]  this, a mainstream media who go and stoke this, you just saw an hour plus with Larry
[3:09:03.140 --> 3:09:07.940]  Pinkney, a former Black Panther, one of the real Black Panthers, come on the Alex Jones
[3:09:07.940 --> 3:09:14.500]  show to discuss how we all should be working together, how we are all brothers, but that,
[3:09:14.500 --> 3:09:19.140]  that's the message that they don't want you to have, that's the message that the globalist
[3:09:19.140 --> 3:09:20.140]  hate.
[3:09:20.140 --> 3:09:25.900]  Meanwhile, we now know that the Postal Service is spying on Americans, I thought they used
[3:09:25.900 --> 3:09:31.980]  the NSA, apparently now they have the Postal Service and I think this is good news, I think
[3:09:31.980 --> 3:09:39.060]  this is good news, the McCloskies are coming back in the year 2021 with the husband, Closkies
[3:09:39.060 --> 3:09:42.620]  of course the people who kept the Black Lives Matter riot mob from their house armed with
[3:09:42.620 --> 3:09:47.220]  guns, now the husband may be running for Senate, we'll be right back, you're watching the
[3:09:47.220 --> 3:09:50.700]  fourth hour of the Alex Jones show, I'm Sam Papert.
[3:09:50.700 --> 3:09:55.980]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting
[3:09:55.980 --> 3:10:02.140]  patients, hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women and children with
[3:10:02.140 --> 3:10:08.460]  uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many
[3:10:08.460 --> 3:10:10.660]  of the test subjects.
[3:10:10.660 --> 3:10:14.660]  In game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made,
[3:10:14.660 --> 3:10:18.340]  14 years ago we tracked and documented the Bilderberg group's activities and they're
[3:10:18.340 --> 3:10:22.900]  planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus, the film now is more important
[3:10:22.900 --> 3:10:26.660]  than ever, when it shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it, we have it back
[3:10:26.660 --> 3:10:32.620]  in print available now at infowarstore.com, selling them as low as $3.95 apiece, we have
[3:10:32.620 --> 3:10:36.540]  Ironman bulk and there's a zero country code, so anywhere on the planet you can make copies,
[3:10:36.540 --> 3:10:42.900]  in fact I want you to make copies, you are the Paul Revere's, 1776 worldwide, 1776 worldwide,
[3:10:42.900 --> 3:10:50.540]  in game blueprint for global enslavement, available now at infowarstore.com.
[3:10:50.540 --> 3:10:55.500]  Every product you hear me on air advertising, we have it stocked in our warehouse in Austin
[3:10:55.500 --> 3:11:00.340]  Texas, every product, so if you order it, we've got it shipped out in a couple of days,
[3:11:00.340 --> 3:11:04.700]  sometimes the same day, let's just get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that
[3:11:04.700 --> 3:11:10.100]  the supply chain's breaking down and it's future orders, it's product we're trying
[3:11:10.100 --> 3:11:15.180]  to reorder to get back in that we're having trouble with, I mean I'm talking about double,
[3:11:15.180 --> 3:11:20.780]  triple quadruple delivery times, and it's across, not just the supplement, vitamin,
[3:11:20.780 --> 3:11:25.900]  mineral industry, it's across every industry, so the globalists have successfully devastated
[3:11:25.900 --> 3:11:31.180]  the economy, that's what I'm saying, you need to visit infowarstore.com today and get high
[3:11:31.180 --> 3:11:36.020]  quality supplements while you still can, and storeable food at infowarstore.com, because
[3:11:36.020 --> 3:11:40.500]  we have it in stock, it's ready to ship, but with the supply chain breakdowns, prices are
[3:11:40.500 --> 3:11:45.460]  going up, availability is going down, and it's just crazy, so please get products while
[3:11:45.460 --> 3:11:53.580]  you still can and support the infowarstore.com.
[3:11:53.580 --> 3:12:13.540]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:12:13.540 --> 3:12:18.860]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, I'm Tom Pappert, editor-in-chief of nationalfile.com,
[3:12:18.860 --> 3:12:27.060]  filling in for the balance of this hour, and you know, even despite the left already saying
[3:12:27.060 --> 3:12:33.900]  that justice, so-called justice is not enough and we want retribution in the case of Derek
[3:12:33.900 --> 3:12:39.660]  Chauvin, you have the president supposed, the resident of the White House, the president
[3:12:39.660 --> 3:12:44.860]  of the United States, Joe Biden, this feeble old man, going out and delivering his lines,
[3:12:44.860 --> 3:12:52.660]  you have Kamala Harris, his extremely unpopular number two, Kamala Harris who is meeting with
[3:12:52.660 --> 3:12:56.540]  foreign leaders, talking to them on the phone, and then meeting with them at the White House,
[3:12:56.540 --> 3:13:01.180]  because I guess Biden doesn't want to, breathing a sigh of relief.
[3:13:01.180 --> 3:13:08.100]  Let's go see what our highest elected officials in the land think of this miscarriage of justice
[3:13:08.100 --> 3:13:12.860]  after Maxine Water intimidated the jury, after Joe Biden said he hopes they convict, after
[3:13:12.860 --> 3:13:18.860]  all of the insanity, let's go see what Joe Biden thinks of the verdict, now that according
[3:13:18.860 --> 3:13:20.860]  to BLM justice has been served.
[3:13:20.860 --> 3:13:22.860]  Let's go to clip number two.
[3:13:22.860 --> 3:13:34.180]  Today, a jury in Minnesota found former Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, guilty on all
[3:13:34.180 --> 3:13:41.140]  counts in the murder of George Floyd last May.
[3:13:41.140 --> 3:13:48.220]  It was a murder in full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world
[3:13:48.220 --> 3:13:53.180]  to see, the systemic racism the vice president just referred to.
[3:13:53.180 --> 3:13:55.780]  No, it's really pathetic.
[3:13:55.780 --> 3:13:59.340]  That's enough of feeble old dying Joe Biden, he just looks sad.
[3:13:59.340 --> 3:14:03.660]  First of all, if we could just put that image back on screen, no audio, but it looks like
[3:14:03.660 --> 3:14:05.260]  a hostage situation.
[3:14:05.260 --> 3:14:11.260]  Every time I see this, you have Kamala Harris with her black mask on, with angry eyes, and
[3:14:11.260 --> 3:14:13.100]  then you have Joe Biden out in front.
[3:14:13.100 --> 3:14:16.620]  It looks, every time I see this, I swear this is a hostage situation.
[3:14:16.620 --> 3:14:19.780]  This is from a bad made for TV movie set in the early 2000s.
[3:14:19.780 --> 3:14:23.380]  This has to be, no, no, this is the vice president of the United States.
[3:14:23.380 --> 3:14:24.740]  That's what they tell me anyway.
[3:14:24.740 --> 3:14:29.060]  But there it is, it ripped the blinders off.
[3:14:29.060 --> 3:14:35.020]  Now America can see, the world can see how racist and disgusting and deplorable this
[3:14:35.020 --> 3:14:37.180]  country really is.
[3:14:37.180 --> 3:14:39.500]  That's the president of the United States.
[3:14:39.500 --> 3:14:43.020]  Remember when Trump, love him or hate him, think he's a traitor, think he's still a good
[3:14:43.020 --> 3:14:44.700]  president, think he has a lot of potential.
[3:14:44.700 --> 3:14:46.540]  He was always a cheerleader.
[3:14:46.540 --> 3:14:49.500]  He always wanted America to succeed.
[3:14:49.500 --> 3:14:52.220]  He always wanted to give people the benefit of the doubt.
[3:14:52.220 --> 3:14:53.900]  Well, not Joe Biden.
[3:14:53.900 --> 3:14:55.820]  The blinders have been ripped off.
[3:14:55.820 --> 3:15:00.660]  And by the way, I wonder how much of what he was saying was ripped off, frankly, from
[3:15:00.660 --> 3:15:01.660]  the Chinese.
[3:15:01.660 --> 3:15:04.020]  We all know Joe is a serial plagiarist.
[3:15:04.020 --> 3:15:06.780]  He lied about his college education.
[3:15:06.780 --> 3:15:09.260]  He stole another man's identity.
[3:15:09.260 --> 3:15:12.700]  He stole language from his campaign ads and then did it in a speech when he was running
[3:15:12.700 --> 3:15:14.380]  for president in the 80s.
[3:15:14.380 --> 3:15:19.540]  Joe Biden is a serial plagiarist and I think that everything he was saying in that little
[3:15:19.540 --> 3:15:24.260]  lecture to the American people came straight out of the Chinese government's mouth.
[3:15:24.260 --> 3:15:28.060]  Because remember, when they came to the United States and they met the Biden regime, they
[3:15:28.060 --> 3:15:29.060]  did nothing.
[3:15:29.060 --> 3:15:33.980]  They sat up there for 10 minutes and said, America has nothing to say to us.
[3:15:33.980 --> 3:15:37.820]  America is less than us in every single way because they have this horrible problem.
[3:15:37.820 --> 3:15:39.060]  They have racism.
[3:15:39.060 --> 3:15:40.260]  They have sexism.
[3:15:40.260 --> 3:15:42.620]  They have black people being treated unjustly.
[3:15:42.620 --> 3:15:44.620]  That's China lecturing us.
[3:15:44.620 --> 3:15:48.940]  And rather than rebuking this, Joe Biden leans directly into it.
[3:15:48.940 --> 3:15:50.540]  Well, let's see what Kamala Harris said.
[3:15:50.540 --> 3:15:56.940]  Kamala Harris, with the most unpopular Democrat, pretty much, and that ran in 2020, I mean,
[3:15:56.940 --> 3:16:01.220]  I think Marianne Williamson, the crazy crystal lady, got more votes than she did.
[3:16:01.220 --> 3:16:02.220]  And she cackles.
[3:16:02.220 --> 3:16:07.060]  Oh, my God, I swear, the more power this woman gets, the more she looks and sounds like Hillary
[3:16:07.060 --> 3:16:08.060]  Clinton.
[3:16:08.060 --> 3:16:13.060]  Let's go to clip number four and watch Kamala offer a sigh of relief and a cackle.
[3:16:13.060 --> 3:16:20.180]  First, I want to thank the jury for their service and I want to thank Mr. Floyd's family
[3:16:20.180 --> 3:16:22.020]  for your steadfastness.
[3:16:22.020 --> 3:16:25.020]  Today we feel a sigh of relief.
[3:16:25.020 --> 3:16:28.980]  Still, it cannot take away the pain.
[3:16:28.980 --> 3:16:34.740]  A measure of justice isn't the same as equal justice.
[3:16:34.740 --> 3:16:42.140]  This verdict brings us a step closer and the fact is we still have work to do.
[3:16:42.140 --> 3:16:46.300]  We still must reform the system.
[3:16:46.300 --> 3:16:52.620]  Last summer, together with Senator Cory Booker and Representative Karen Bass, I introduced
[3:16:52.620 --> 3:16:55.020]  the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act.
[3:16:55.020 --> 3:16:59.380]  And we all know what Kamala was really doing last summer.
[3:16:59.380 --> 3:17:01.180]  We all know what she was really doing a year ago.
[3:17:01.180 --> 3:17:03.740]  She was bailing rioters out of jail.
[3:17:03.740 --> 3:17:04.740]  You remember that?
[3:17:04.740 --> 3:17:09.060]  The bail fund that she set up with the squad members, that's what Kamala Harris is really
[3:17:09.060 --> 3:17:15.300]  interested in, getting violent alleged offenders out of jail early.
[3:17:15.300 --> 3:17:16.300]  And she admits it.
[3:17:16.300 --> 3:17:17.740]  She says, this is not enough.
[3:17:17.740 --> 3:17:19.460]  We need more.
[3:17:19.460 --> 3:17:26.380]  And now, Jen Pisaki, the press secretary, is offering the new line of propaganda from
[3:17:26.380 --> 3:17:34.220]  the regime, from the White House, saying that this new shooting in Columbus, Ohio, is an
[3:17:34.220 --> 3:17:35.980]  example of racism.
[3:17:35.980 --> 3:17:36.980]  It's all an example of racism.
[3:17:36.980 --> 3:17:39.460]  Do we have that clip ready, by the way, crew?
[3:17:39.460 --> 3:17:44.820]  Let's go ahead and cut to Jen Saki lecturing the American people.
[3:17:44.820 --> 3:17:45.820]  Go ahead.
[3:17:45.820 --> 3:17:50.340]  Hi, then, Taylor Poplars with Spectrum News, three quick questions.
[3:17:50.340 --> 3:17:51.340]  I'll make them quick.
[3:17:51.340 --> 3:17:56.420]  First, has the president been briefed on 16-year-old Makaya Bryant being shot and killed by police
[3:17:56.420 --> 3:18:01.380]  in Columbus, Ohio yesterday and half in moments before the show came out?
[3:18:01.380 --> 3:18:02.380]  Yes.
[3:18:02.380 --> 3:18:10.260]  I said, yes, and let me just say, since you gave me the opportunity, the killing of 16-year-old
[3:18:10.260 --> 3:18:12.820]  Makaya Bryant by the Columbus Police is tragic.
[3:18:12.820 --> 3:18:16.660]  She was a child, we're thinking of her friends and family and the communities that are hurting
[3:18:16.660 --> 3:18:18.140]  and grieving her loss.
[3:18:18.140 --> 3:18:23.260]  We know that police violence just proportionally impacts black and Latino people and communities
[3:18:23.260 --> 3:18:27.900]  and that black women and girls, like black men and boys, experience higher rates of police
[3:18:27.900 --> 3:18:28.900]  violence.
[3:18:28.900 --> 3:18:34.700]  We also know that there are particular vulnerabilities that children in foster care like Makaya face.
[3:18:34.700 --> 3:18:38.500]  And her death came, as you noted, just as America was hopeful of a step forward after
[3:18:38.500 --> 3:18:43.580]  the traumatic and exhausting trial of Derek Chauvin and the verdict that was reached.
[3:18:43.580 --> 3:18:49.740]  So our focus is on working to address systemic racism and implicit bias head-on and, of course,
[3:18:49.740 --> 3:18:55.060]  to passing laws and legislation that will put much-needed reforms into place at police
[3:18:55.060 --> 3:18:56.500]  departments around the country.
[3:18:56.500 --> 3:18:57.500]  And has the president been briefed on?
[3:18:57.500 --> 3:19:02.420]  And nobody dares to ask this witch, or any of these lunatics, what reform would stop
[3:19:02.420 --> 3:19:03.420]  this?
[3:19:03.420 --> 3:19:05.780]  I mean, I'm sure if you've been watching the Alex Shone Show, if you've been watching
[3:19:05.780 --> 3:19:08.980]  American Journal with Harrison Smith, you've seen this video by now.
[3:19:08.980 --> 3:19:12.100]  We don't need to air it and make people watch it again, but it is a fight.
[3:19:12.100 --> 3:19:17.380]  It is a full-on brawl between at least four people from what I can see and which punches
[3:19:17.380 --> 3:19:18.460]  are being thrown.
[3:19:18.460 --> 3:19:20.980]  People are kicking each other in the head.
[3:19:20.980 --> 3:19:25.460]  Somebody pulls out a knife, a very long and menacing-looking knife and makes a direct
[3:19:25.460 --> 3:19:28.060]  stabbing motion toward another person.
[3:19:28.060 --> 3:19:32.380]  This cop, when he gets there, he has no idea if these people are minors.
[3:19:32.380 --> 3:19:34.060]  He has no idea if they've got guns.
[3:19:34.060 --> 3:19:35.060]  He sees a knife.
[3:19:35.060 --> 3:19:36.940]  He has no idea if they're just horsing around.
[3:19:36.940 --> 3:19:40.940]  But when somebody is getting ready to gut somebody with a knife, it certainly doesn't
[3:19:40.940 --> 3:19:43.020]  look like horsing around.
[3:19:43.020 --> 3:19:48.820]  And so he discharged his weapon, apparently, to subdue this person before they could commit
[3:19:48.820 --> 3:19:50.340]  a horrific crime.
[3:19:50.340 --> 3:19:51.980]  And then, of course, we have a national file.
[3:19:51.980 --> 3:19:53.500]  You can see this knife on the ground.
[3:19:53.500 --> 3:19:55.580]  Like, this is not a little pocket knife.
[3:19:55.580 --> 3:19:58.340]  This thing could do some damage, especially to somebody's gut.
[3:19:58.340 --> 3:20:00.460]  I mean, it looks like she's going straight for the stomach.
[3:20:00.460 --> 3:20:02.500]  It's absolutely insane.
[3:20:02.500 --> 3:20:06.180]  So what would Jim Saki have them do different?
[3:20:06.180 --> 3:20:08.340]  Well, there's no answer to that.
[3:20:08.340 --> 3:20:12.500]  I mean, I'm no law enforcement professional, but I put myself in this situation.
[3:20:12.500 --> 3:20:13.500]  You show up.
[3:20:13.500 --> 3:20:14.500]  You get to this house.
[3:20:14.500 --> 3:20:15.500]  You hear there's a fight.
[3:20:15.500 --> 3:20:18.020]  The property owner is asking you to please resolve this fight.
[3:20:18.020 --> 3:20:20.580]  What on earth do you do differently?
[3:20:20.580 --> 3:20:21.820]  What happens in their mind?
[3:20:21.820 --> 3:20:26.300]  Should the officer, maybe this is the solution, just let the person get stabbed and then call
[3:20:26.300 --> 3:20:27.300]  an ambulance?
[3:20:27.300 --> 3:20:32.420]  Well, then, of course, the officer would be a monster for not preventing this poor child
[3:20:32.420 --> 3:20:33.420]  from getting stabbed.
[3:20:33.420 --> 3:20:35.900]  And, of course, they'll make it a massive race thing.
[3:20:35.900 --> 3:20:39.860]  We will know the name of this officer by the end of the week, and this sends a message
[3:20:39.860 --> 3:20:46.820]  to police officers, resign, quit, and make way for the left-wing stasi that's going to
[3:20:46.820 --> 3:20:47.820]  take your place.
[3:20:47.820 --> 3:20:48.820]  We'll be right back.
[3:20:48.820 --> 3:20:54.500]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:20:54.500 --> 3:21:00.300]  because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:21:00.300 --> 3:21:05.020]  and for word of mouth, and we're all this together, and, you know, it gets old having
[3:21:05.020 --> 3:21:08.700]  to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please, bomb, or we won't be here on air.
[3:21:08.700 --> 3:21:09.700]  But it's true.
[3:21:09.700 --> 3:21:13.460]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:21:13.460 --> 3:21:17.420]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors, and they've harassed and almost shut down
[3:21:17.420 --> 3:21:18.420]  everybody else.
[3:21:18.420 --> 3:21:22.380]  They crippled all the other groups, and we're still here, and as this whole new world order
[3:21:22.380 --> 3:21:25.260]  comes out and we open, our credibility's going up.
[3:21:25.260 --> 3:21:26.780]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:21:26.780 --> 3:21:28.900]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:21:28.900 --> 3:21:32.380]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America's still quasi-free.
[3:21:32.380 --> 3:21:37.220]  You can't have info, or it's been proven right, being on air with all the craziness that's
[3:21:37.220 --> 3:21:38.220]  about to unfold.
[3:21:38.220 --> 3:21:40.540]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:21:40.540 --> 3:21:45.620]  So thank you all, and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements
[3:21:45.620 --> 3:21:46.620]  and so much more.

[3:21:48.300 --> 3:21:49.300]  We're thanking you.
[3:21:49.300 --> 3:21:54.300]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[3:21:54.300 --> 3:21:58.860]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including
[3:21:58.860 --> 3:22:04.340]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune
[3:22:04.340 --> 3:22:05.340]  system.

[3:22:49.620 --> 3:22:54.780]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person, and so as bad as things are with
[3:22:54.780 --> 3:22:58.540]  the globalist attack on humanity, of all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want
[3:22:58.540 --> 3:23:02.980]  you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[3:23:02.980 --> 3:23:06.620]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things zero public doesn't get to see, and let me
[3:23:06.620 --> 3:23:12.980]  tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood or
[3:23:12.980 --> 3:23:18.860]  mainstream media or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[3:23:18.860 --> 3:23:23.580]  They don't want to go along with the globalist, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[3:23:23.580 --> 3:23:25.620]  Well that's where infowarst comes in.

[3:23:35.020 --> 3:23:39.740]  for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[3:23:39.740 --> 3:23:44.940]  That's our job, so please keep us on the air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can
[3:23:44.940 --> 3:23:47.620]  meet the shock groups and the information war.
[3:23:47.620 --> 3:23:49.020]  This is infowarstore.com.
[3:23:49.020 --> 3:23:56.100]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been, Alex Jones was
[3:23:56.100 --> 3:24:02.540]  right, but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[3:24:02.540 --> 3:24:05.340]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.

[3:26:52.740 --> 3:26:58.740]  but surely win the information war, but it only happens when you go to infowarstore.com.
[3:26:58.740 --> 3:27:07.700]  So we've been talking about the new fixation, we've gone from George Floyd, Minneapolis,
[3:27:07.700 --> 3:27:15.580]  all the way over to Columbus, Ohio, this article's up at infowars.com, leftist falsely claimed
[3:27:15.580 --> 3:27:21.860]  police shooting of Ohio teen was in response to a knife fight, leftist are now claiming
[3:27:21.860 --> 3:27:25.900]  the police shooting of 16 year old black girl in Columbus, Ohio was unjustified because
[3:27:25.900 --> 3:27:32.020]  the girl was merely involved in a knife fight, despite footage showing she only had a knife
[3:27:32.020 --> 3:27:39.660]  as she tried to stab two victims, and if that's not the most insane part of this, I mean,
[3:27:39.660 --> 3:27:44.420]  this stabbing, it's not a knife fight, first of all, what is a knife fight, is it like
[3:27:44.420 --> 3:27:45.420]  lightsabers?
[3:27:45.420 --> 3:27:52.740]  No, no, this woman, people were getting kicked in the face, people were getting shoved, everybody
[3:27:52.740 --> 3:27:58.820]  seen this screen capture where the woman is getting ready to knife this poor other girl.
[3:27:58.820 --> 3:28:03.060]  Children, these are children knifing each other, the police were called because there
[3:28:03.060 --> 3:28:08.340]  was a violent fight on the property and the property owner couldn't solve it.
[3:28:08.340 --> 3:28:12.500]  The article goes on, as we highlighted earlier, Black Lives Matter supporters initially lied
[3:28:12.500 --> 3:28:18.220]  claiming Machia Bryant was an unarmed victim who called the police for help.
[3:28:18.220 --> 3:28:22.340]  In reality it was one of her victims who called 911 and body cam footage subsequently showed
[3:28:22.340 --> 3:28:27.860]  Bryant using a kitchen knife, very sharp kitchen knife, to stab at two other girls while a
[3:28:27.860 --> 3:28:33.220]  man helped her by kicking one of the girls in the head while she was down.
[3:28:33.220 --> 3:28:38.620]  Now left to serve, certainly asserting police shouldn't have intervened in a knife fight.
[3:28:38.620 --> 3:28:46.100]  Bree Newsom, a BLM activist described the fight as a fight involving knives.
[3:28:46.100 --> 3:28:56.100]  The last thing kids need is cops showing up during their routine knife fights and intervening.
[3:28:56.100 --> 3:28:59.820]  Kathy Griffin also claimed the police shouldn't have gotten involved because a group of teenagers
[3:28:59.820 --> 3:29:02.580]  were having a fight.
[3:29:02.580 --> 3:29:06.300]  A black teenage girl named Machia Bryant was killed because a police officer immediately
[3:29:06.300 --> 3:29:11.620]  decided to shoot her multiple times in order to break up a knife fight.
[3:29:11.620 --> 3:29:16.100]  I have to ask the viewers, and I know that this audience is very much on the side of logic
[3:29:16.100 --> 3:29:23.180]  and reason and sanity and God, but if this was your daughter, either of these people,
[3:29:23.180 --> 3:29:26.860]  you see your daughter lunging at another person with a knife, or worse, you see somebody lunging
[3:29:26.860 --> 3:29:31.940]  at your daughter with a knife, would you not want a police officer to step in and stop
[3:29:31.940 --> 3:29:35.180]  this at any cost?
[3:29:35.180 --> 3:29:41.940]  A taser, from my understanding, is generally used to keep something from getting violent.
[3:29:41.940 --> 3:29:44.620]  Use it to subdue the suspect.
[3:29:44.620 --> 3:29:48.380]  But when the suspect is getting ready to go after somebody with a knife, there's some
[3:29:48.380 --> 3:29:50.100]  people a taser won't even slow down.
[3:29:50.100 --> 3:29:52.180]  You've all seen the videos.
[3:29:52.180 --> 3:29:55.300]  And so that's going to be the left's new argument.
[3:29:55.300 --> 3:30:01.780]  The knife fights are just a normal part of growing up in the United States of America.
[3:30:01.780 --> 3:30:03.660]  You have knife fights, I have knife fights.
[3:30:03.660 --> 3:30:07.140]  We all had a couple of knife fights growing up, come on.
[3:30:07.140 --> 3:30:12.940]  And if a police officer wants to end a knife fight, well, that cop is a racist, hates black
[3:30:12.940 --> 3:30:13.940]  people.
[3:30:13.940 --> 3:30:16.380]  They should rot in jail.
[3:30:16.380 --> 3:30:18.180]  The crew is too good at this, by the way.
[3:30:18.180 --> 3:30:19.660]  They should rot in jail.
[3:30:19.660 --> 3:30:24.060]  TV viewers can see my first knife fight, a children's book that I remember growing up.
[3:30:24.060 --> 3:30:26.060]  I don't know about you.
[3:30:26.060 --> 3:30:27.180]  But that's the new narrative.
[3:30:27.180 --> 3:30:28.500]  There is nothing in this country.
[3:30:28.500 --> 3:30:29.500]  There is nothing sacred.
[3:30:29.500 --> 3:30:32.380]  Now, soon, you're not even going to be allowed to walk down the street because you could be
[3:30:32.380 --> 3:30:35.740]  subject to a knife fight, and if the police show up and end the knife fight, then you
[3:30:35.740 --> 3:30:37.420]  are automatically the bad person.
[3:30:37.420 --> 3:30:41.980]  And by the way, 16, I mean, I'm sorry this happened.
[3:30:41.980 --> 3:30:44.940]  I wish that this girl didn't have to die.
[3:30:44.940 --> 3:30:50.340]  But I think at 16, if you are going to, if you are blinking, plunging actions, lunging
[3:30:50.340 --> 3:30:53.660]  actions with a knife, you know damn well how that's going to end.
[3:30:53.660 --> 3:30:59.060]  You have an adult brain to know that actions have consequences.
[3:30:59.060 --> 3:31:03.300]  Here's a fascinating article coming out of the establishment media, though.
[3:31:03.300 --> 3:31:07.740]  So we have Black Lives Matter allowed to roam in the streets, allowed to do whatever they
[3:31:07.740 --> 3:31:08.740]  want.
[3:31:08.740 --> 3:31:09.740]  They credited the rioting.
[3:31:09.740 --> 3:31:12.780]  They said that we never would have gotten this verdict if not for the rioting, and we're
[3:31:12.780 --> 3:31:17.980]  going to keep on rioting until systemic racism is ended across the police of the world, and
[3:31:17.980 --> 3:31:20.380]  we're just going to get rid of the police, and they don't know what they want.
[3:31:20.380 --> 3:31:22.020]  They just know that rioting works.
[3:31:22.020 --> 3:31:25.500]  And so like a toddler who you reward, you give the toddler what they want when they
[3:31:25.500 --> 3:31:27.620]  cry and throw a fit inside the toy store.
[3:31:27.620 --> 3:31:29.100]  You go ahead and buy them the toy.
[3:31:29.100 --> 3:31:33.380]  Well any time they want another toy, they're just going to start crying and rioting and
[3:31:33.380 --> 3:31:37.260]  throwing Molotov cocktails at police.
[3:31:37.260 --> 3:31:44.580]  Well now, before we do that, let's go listen to Joe Biden talking to the rest of us saying
[3:31:44.580 --> 3:31:46.460]  what your life is going to be like.
[3:31:46.460 --> 3:31:50.860]  Remember Black Lives Matter, they've all got new TVs and they burned down Nike.
[3:31:50.860 --> 3:31:53.300]  They're living the high life.
[3:31:53.300 --> 3:31:57.780]  The American people, though, well, you're not doing a very good job social distancing,
[3:31:57.780 --> 3:32:01.420]  and you better start to get in line if you want to celebrate July 4th, Buster.
[3:32:01.420 --> 3:32:02.700]  Let's go to this clip of Joe Biden.
[3:32:02.700 --> 3:32:09.020]  Hold on our progress and race to the finish line here, but let me close with this.
[3:32:09.020 --> 3:32:14.620]  Back in March 11th, I outlined a vision of what America could look like by the Fourth
[3:32:14.620 --> 3:32:21.820]  of July, an America that was much closer to normal life that we left behind more than
[3:32:21.820 --> 3:32:23.700]  a year ago.
[3:32:23.700 --> 3:32:26.700]  We remain on track for that goal.
[3:32:26.700 --> 3:32:32.180]  In the weeks since then, more than 120 million shots have been given since I announced the
[3:32:32.180 --> 3:32:35.060]  July 4th proposal.
[3:32:35.060 --> 3:32:40.020]  More of our kids are back in school, and after a long and painful year, more grandparents
[3:32:40.020 --> 3:32:42.820]  are able to hug their grandkids again.
[3:32:42.820 --> 3:32:49.780]  It's great progress, but if we let up now and stop being vigilant, this virus will erase
[3:32:49.780 --> 3:32:55.540]  the progress we've already achieved, the sacrifices we've made, the lives that have been put on
[3:32:55.540 --> 3:32:57.940]  hold, the loved ones who have been taken home.
[3:32:57.940 --> 3:32:58.940]  That's right.
[3:32:58.940 --> 3:32:59.940]  Wear that math.
[3:32:59.940 --> 3:33:00.940]  Time.
[3:33:00.940 --> 3:33:01.940]  The progress that we have achieved.
[3:33:01.940 --> 3:33:03.420]  First of all, what are the disparities?
[3:33:03.420 --> 3:33:04.740]  What did they get this guy on?
[3:33:04.740 --> 3:33:08.660]  You saw him in a clip earlier, just a few moments ago, here on the broadcast, talking
[3:33:08.660 --> 3:33:13.420]  about how great it is that the chauvinist is going to die in prison and all likelihood,
[3:33:13.420 --> 3:33:14.900]  and he sounded lucid.
[3:33:14.900 --> 3:33:16.380]  They must have got him on some good uppers.
[3:33:16.380 --> 3:33:18.220]  He must have taken his brain force.
[3:33:18.220 --> 3:33:22.900]  Within that last clip, he can't speak, but he wants you to know that you had to keep
[3:33:22.900 --> 3:33:24.060]  wearing that mask.
[3:33:24.060 --> 3:33:28.580]  You've got to keep doing everything that the God, the King, the prophet of the science,
[3:33:28.580 --> 3:33:29.900]  Anthony Fauci says.
[3:33:29.900 --> 3:33:32.140]  If he says three masks, you wear three masks.
[3:33:32.140 --> 3:33:34.060]  If he says face shield, you wear a face shield.
[3:33:34.060 --> 3:33:39.820]  You do whatever he says otherwise, no 4th of July for you.
[3:33:39.820 --> 3:33:43.460]  And he stutters, and he slurs, and his words are mush.
[3:33:43.460 --> 3:33:45.340]  He looks like he's about to fall asleep.
[3:33:45.340 --> 3:33:50.100]  I swear, whatever they're using to keep this guy awake, it must only work in extremely
[3:33:50.100 --> 3:33:53.580]  small, small, small amounts.
[3:33:53.580 --> 3:33:55.900]  Meanwhile, we've got Bill Gates.
[3:33:55.900 --> 3:33:57.700]  We'll talk about this more on the other side.
[3:33:57.700 --> 3:34:03.060]  Bill Gates is set to address 40 heads of state at a climate summit.
[3:34:03.060 --> 3:34:06.140]  Bill Gates, the world's most powerful doctor.
[3:34:06.140 --> 3:34:08.300]  And meanwhile, you have Anthony Fauci.
[3:34:08.300 --> 3:34:15.180]  Anthony Fauci, he's going to go to the Vatican and talk with the Pope about how to end coronavirus.
[3:34:15.180 --> 3:34:19.980]  Which is really fascinating, because you have Fauci, who is really the prophet of the science,
[3:34:19.980 --> 3:34:22.300]  this new religion created by the left over the past year.
[3:34:22.300 --> 3:34:23.780]  It's called the science.
[3:34:23.780 --> 3:34:28.940]  And Fauci is its prophet, and so Fauci, as the top authority of the science, is going
[3:34:28.940 --> 3:34:33.540]  to go meet with Pope Francis, the top authority of the Church.
[3:34:33.540 --> 3:34:34.540]  So it's very fascinating.
[3:34:34.540 --> 3:34:40.460]  I love these inter-religious meetings, you know, it's a lot like when the Pope goes
[3:34:40.460 --> 3:34:46.700]  to the temple in Iraq and prays to ancient gods of baby murder.
[3:34:46.700 --> 3:34:47.700]  We'll be right back.
[3:34:47.700 --> 3:34:48.980]  You're watching The Alchone Show.
[3:34:48.980 --> 3:34:54.020]  We here at Infowars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[3:34:54.020 --> 3:34:56.460]  is now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:34:56.460 --> 3:35:01.860]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it
[3:35:01.860 --> 3:35:07.020]  has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric
[3:35:07.020 --> 3:35:08.020]  effects.
[3:35:08.020 --> 3:35:13.620]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[3:35:13.620 --> 3:35:17.940]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[3:35:17.940 --> 3:35:22.620]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[3:35:22.620 --> 3:35:23.820]  loosen up a little.
[3:35:23.820 --> 3:35:28.740]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[3:35:28.740 --> 3:35:34.740]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[3:35:34.740 --> 3:35:37.300]  herbs including, but not limited to.
[3:35:37.300 --> 3:35:41.460]  German Kava Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Valerian Roots.
[3:35:41.460 --> 3:35:48.820]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[3:35:48.820 --> 3:35:57.140]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registrars that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[3:35:57.140 --> 3:36:01.620]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[3:36:01.620 --> 3:36:05.060]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[3:36:05.060 --> 3:36:08.020]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[3:36:08.020 --> 3:36:11.820]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or
[3:36:11.820 --> 3:36:16.540]  want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[3:36:16.540 --> 3:36:22.300]  And if you go to InfowarsDomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the
[3:36:22.300 --> 3:36:28.540]  lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund
[3:36:28.540 --> 3:36:29.540]  the Infowar.
[3:36:29.540 --> 3:36:33.980]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get
[3:36:33.980 --> 3:36:34.980]  from them.
[3:36:34.980 --> 3:36:39.020]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists
[3:36:39.020 --> 3:36:41.460]  are destroying what was open and what was free.
[3:36:41.460 --> 3:36:45.980]  So InfowarsDomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[3:36:45.980 --> 3:36:50.100]  InfowarsDomains.com, take action now.
[3:36:50.100 --> 3:36:52.700]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[3:36:52.700 --> 3:36:56.380]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine.
[3:36:56.380 --> 3:37:01.020]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our
[3:37:01.020 --> 3:37:03.540]  family's sakes, but also our community.
[3:37:03.540 --> 3:37:09.140]  CitizenStronghold.com is the best place to go to get high quality body armor at the lowest
[3:37:09.140 --> 3:37:10.140]  price you're going to find.
[3:37:10.140 --> 3:37:14.260]  Again, this is high quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[3:37:14.260 --> 3:37:17.900]  We've worked with them for years, but they can never supply enough to our audience.
[3:37:17.900 --> 3:37:20.020]  They have massively expanded their factories.
[3:37:20.020 --> 3:37:24.420]  It's made right here in America and they're ready to ship it to right now.

[3:37:32.620 --> 3:37:36.540]  They have bad packs that didn't unfold in our full top body armor.

[3:37:41.500 --> 3:37:44.020]  to try to stop the sale of it soon.

[3:37:50.620 --> 3:37:57.060]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:37:57.060 --> 3:38:01.620]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:38:01.620 --> 3:38:03.980]  It's known as the Builderburg.
[3:38:03.980 --> 3:38:07.700]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:38:07.700 --> 3:38:10.980]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:38:10.980 --> 3:38:16.020]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[3:38:16.020 --> 3:38:19.140]  80% of humanity is in hand.
[3:38:19.140 --> 3:38:21.620]  The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago.
[3:38:21.620 --> 3:38:24.020]  It is the blueprint for their plan to figure out the world.
[3:38:24.020 --> 3:38:25.500]  It is the blueprint for the great reset.
[3:38:25.500 --> 3:38:26.500]  It is in-game.
[3:38:26.500 --> 3:38:31.020]  Blueprint for global enslavement, available right now at infowarstore.com with a zero country
[3:38:31.020 --> 3:38:33.700]  code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[3:38:33.700 --> 3:38:37.900]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at infowarstore.com.
[3:38:37.900 --> 3:38:42.140]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it, and if you take that action, I demand
[3:38:42.140 --> 3:38:45.700]  you tell others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well.
[3:38:45.700 --> 3:39:14.700]  It will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[3:39:15.700 --> 3:39:22.820]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:39:22.820 --> 3:39:25.940]  I'm Tom Pappert, filling in for the balance of this segment.
[3:39:25.940 --> 3:39:27.220]  Make sure to share these links.
[3:39:27.220 --> 3:39:28.220]  War Room is coming up next.
[3:39:28.220 --> 3:39:29.580]  Make sure to go to Bandai Video.
[3:39:29.580 --> 3:39:30.580]  Share these links.
[3:39:30.580 --> 3:39:32.340]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[3:39:32.340 --> 3:39:34.780]  Support the Infowar.
[3:39:34.780 --> 3:39:37.420]  So yes, it's happening.
[3:39:37.420 --> 3:39:42.180]  The most fascinating meeting of the minds, all these geniuses in the same room, the Vatican,
[3:39:42.180 --> 3:39:47.780]  to host Fauci, Chelsea Clinton, and vaccine company CEOs.
[3:39:47.780 --> 3:39:50.980]  This is up in national file.com.
[3:39:50.980 --> 3:39:54.740]  The Vatican is co-hosting a health conference in May that will showcase speeches by Bill
[3:39:54.740 --> 3:40:01.220]  and Hillary Clinton's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, vaccine guru, Dr. Anthony Fauci, guru Deepak
[3:40:01.220 --> 3:40:06.220]  Chopra, and the Pfizer and Moderna chief executive officers who are, of course, mass
[3:40:06.220 --> 3:40:09.660]  producing vaccines for the public.
[3:40:09.660 --> 3:40:15.180]  The Pope is, of course, fresh off going and praying and leading an interfaith, supposedly
[3:40:15.180 --> 3:40:21.460]  religious experience at the ancient pagan temple of Ur.
[3:40:21.460 --> 3:40:25.380]  That is, of course, a speech that there were no Jews allowed.
[3:40:25.380 --> 3:40:30.060]  They didn't mention Jesus once, so basically the Pope went to go court the Muslims.
[3:40:30.060 --> 3:40:31.860]  Very, very strange stuff.
[3:40:31.860 --> 3:40:37.540]  And if that's not strange enough, merging Catholicism with the science, the cult of
[3:40:37.540 --> 3:40:38.540]  the science.
[3:40:38.540 --> 3:40:43.380]  Now, Bill Gates is set to address 40 heads of state at a climate summit.
[3:40:43.380 --> 3:40:45.300]  In other words, he's going to give them orders.
[3:40:45.300 --> 3:40:49.220]  He's going to tell them how high Klaus Schwab wants them to jump.
[3:40:49.220 --> 3:40:54.180]  The world's most powerful doctor, Bill Gates, is to be given a platform this week to address
[3:40:54.180 --> 3:40:58.660]  40 heads of state at a climate summit hosted by Joe Biden, according to Reuters, stories
[3:40:58.660 --> 3:41:00.660]  up at infowars.com.
[3:41:00.660 --> 3:41:03.620]  And by the way, I thought that was fake.
[3:41:03.620 --> 3:41:07.900]  I thought, I mean, we all know there's articles out there, you know, that meet the most powerful
[3:41:07.900 --> 3:41:10.060]  doctor, Bill Gates.
[3:41:10.060 --> 3:41:14.940]  But then it turns out, if you go to Google, this is how corrupt our big tech insane asylum
[3:41:14.940 --> 3:41:17.980]  that we're all forced to live in is, if you go to Google and you type in who is the world's
[3:41:17.980 --> 3:41:22.020]  most powerful doctor, it literally will tell you Bill Gates, a man without a medical degree,
[3:41:22.020 --> 3:41:26.900]  a man who didn't graduate college, a man who released viruses, so you had to buy his antivirus
[3:41:26.900 --> 3:41:33.500]  software, a man who now is the single largest non-governmental contributor to the World Health
[3:41:33.500 --> 3:41:36.700]  Organization, the most powerful doctor.
[3:41:36.700 --> 3:41:42.060]  Gates, also a renowned climate expert, because he is selling a book about it, will be the
[3:41:42.060 --> 3:41:47.580]  keynote speaker at the virtual summit, which begins Thursday and will be attended by French
[3:41:47.580 --> 3:41:53.780]  President Emmanuel Macaroni and British Prime Minister Boris the Disappointment Johnson.
[3:41:53.780 --> 3:41:58.380]  Gates will reportedly talk about innovation in clean energy and industries that have yet
[3:41:58.380 --> 3:41:59.500]  to be created.
[3:41:59.500 --> 3:42:04.260]  He's going to predict the future for us, which I guess he's very good at.
[3:42:04.260 --> 3:42:09.780]  Remember a few months ago he said, well wait until the next pandemic, the next one will
[3:42:09.780 --> 3:42:13.780]  really get their attention, basically a veiled threat that if we don't wear a mask, if we
[3:42:13.780 --> 3:42:19.020]  don't lock down, if we don't throw ourselves on the sword of the science, so Democrats
[3:42:19.020 --> 3:42:24.940]  and globalists and communists and horrible individuals and horrible groups can take power,
[3:42:24.940 --> 3:42:28.460]  then they're going to come back at us, they're going to give us something worse.
[3:42:28.460 --> 3:42:33.940]  The announcement comes as Democrats have reintroduced their revamped Green New Deal, which seeks
[3:42:33.940 --> 3:42:39.660]  to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into so-called green initiatives in an effort
[3:42:39.660 --> 3:42:45.900]  to transition to a 100% carbon free economy, as well as meeting 100% of the power demand
[3:42:45.900 --> 3:42:50.940]  from zero emission energy sources like wind and solar, which as you might remember worked
[3:42:50.940 --> 3:42:56.980]  out great here in the state of Texas earlier this year, when the turbines were frozen and
[3:42:56.980 --> 3:43:02.500]  the solar panels were frozen, and the traditional power plants, coal and natural energy, natural
[3:43:02.500 --> 3:43:10.420]  gas, well, you see COVID made it so they couldn't go do their inspections, they just had a Zoom
[3:43:10.420 --> 3:43:17.380]  call instead of an inspection, and so it all froze over, so that's the Green New Deal.
[3:43:17.380 --> 3:43:24.180]  And by the way, the real, as we all know, nobody is after China to join and step up
[3:43:24.180 --> 3:43:28.860]  and do more than the bare minimum when it comes to the Paris climate accords, nobody
[3:43:28.860 --> 3:43:35.220]  is after India to really participate, you see India and China are declared by the globalist
[3:43:35.220 --> 3:43:39.540]  oligarchs to be a developing country.
[3:43:39.540 --> 3:43:45.380]  And so it doesn't matter that China pollutes more than pretty much all of Europe combined,
[3:43:45.380 --> 3:43:51.660]  it doesn't matter that India pollutes the ocean so badly that Japan has had international
[3:43:51.660 --> 3:43:57.460]  issues with them because all the filth goes out into the sea and winds up landing in Japan.
[3:43:57.460 --> 3:44:01.380]  Never mind the fact that, by the way, Japan had a nuclear energy problem where we felt
[3:44:01.380 --> 3:44:07.940]  the repercussions in California, no, India and China consider developing countries,
[3:44:07.940 --> 3:44:10.580]  they can pollute all they want.
[3:44:10.580 --> 3:44:14.620]  But here in the United States, where we actually care about the environment, like President
[3:44:14.620 --> 3:44:19.100]  Trump said, clean air and water, who doesn't want clean air and water?
[3:44:19.100 --> 3:44:22.820]  But here in America, we have to hold ourselves to a higher standard, give China the competitive
[3:44:22.820 --> 3:44:30.460]  edge and force ourselves into a new economic dark age in the name of going green.
[3:44:30.460 --> 3:44:31.460]  And how's this for a story?
[3:44:31.460 --> 3:44:36.740]  The Postal Service is running a covert operations program that monitors American social media
[3:44:36.740 --> 3:44:37.740]  posts.
[3:44:37.740 --> 3:44:42.900]  Is this one of those crazy Alex Jones, Tom Papper, National File, Infowars articles?
[3:44:42.900 --> 3:44:49.660]  No, this is from the mainstream press, news.yahoo.com, the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Postal
[3:44:49.660 --> 3:44:54.780]  Service, remember they have such a thing, but I swear the Postal Service, they figured
[3:44:54.780 --> 3:44:59.820]  out how to make them into something that they're just really not after the after the 2020 election
[3:44:59.820 --> 3:45:03.700]  when they had to militarize them, has been quietly running a program that tracks and
[3:45:03.700 --> 3:45:07.740]  collects American social media posts, including those about planned protests, according to
[3:45:07.740 --> 3:45:09.980]  a document obtained by Yahoo News.
[3:45:09.980 --> 3:45:14.740]  The details of the surveillance effort known as ICOP or Internet Covert Operations Program
[3:45:14.740 --> 3:45:16.820]  have not previously been made public.
[3:45:16.820 --> 3:45:21.100]  The work involves having analysts trawl through social media sites to look for what the document
[3:45:21.100 --> 3:45:28.380]  claims as inflammatory postings and then sharing that information across government agencies.
[3:45:28.380 --> 3:45:35.020]  Articles of course up as you can see at infowars.com, the Postal Service.
[3:45:35.020 --> 3:45:39.660]  Your vote may not arrive or maybe five days later or maybe two days later, they might
[3:45:39.660 --> 3:45:43.060]  just throw it out if they think it's a Trump vote.
[3:45:43.060 --> 3:45:46.820]  Your letter may not arrive on time because, you know, COVID makes it very difficult to
[3:45:46.820 --> 3:45:48.500]  get these things done effectively.
[3:45:48.500 --> 3:45:56.940]  But if you made a post about how George Floyd was arrested for or was in the process of
[3:45:56.940 --> 3:46:01.980]  being arrested for a counterfeit 20, well, that's inflammatory.
[3:46:01.980 --> 3:46:06.220]  And the next time the letter carrier comes to bring you the mail, well, you may just
[3:46:06.220 --> 3:46:07.500]  have a situation on your hands.
[3:46:07.500 --> 3:46:09.020]  You may be arrested by the Postal Service.
[3:46:09.020 --> 3:46:15.900]  Isn't that who arrested Steve Vannon, wasn't it, a post office guy, got on a boat and came
[3:46:15.900 --> 3:46:18.340]  and arrested Vannon on a yacht?
[3:46:18.340 --> 3:46:24.260]  That's the Postal Service under the globalist empire known as the United States.
[3:46:24.260 --> 3:46:27.460]  Analysts with the United States Postal Service, Internet Covert Operations Program, monitor
[3:46:27.460 --> 3:46:32.420]  significant activities regarding planned protests occurring internationally and domestically
[3:46:32.420 --> 3:46:37.140]  on March 20th, 2021, says March 16th government bulletin.
[3:46:37.140 --> 3:46:39.980]  By the way, how many of these fake stories have you gotten?
[3:46:39.980 --> 3:46:45.380]  We've had white people matter protests that don't even exist, that never even happened,
[3:46:45.380 --> 3:46:46.860]  but somehow the media writes it up.
[3:46:46.860 --> 3:46:50.980]  The media was utterly convinced that we're going to be massive protests on, what was
[3:46:50.980 --> 3:46:54.460]  it, March 1st or March 4th in D.C.?
[3:46:54.460 --> 3:46:55.700]  Nobody ever goes to these things.
[3:46:55.700 --> 3:46:59.180]  They're to the point now where all they have to do is just lie and say there's going to
[3:46:59.180 --> 3:47:05.420]  be another insurrection and then people become convinced and neurotic and deathly afraid
[3:47:05.420 --> 3:47:09.900]  because the media told them to be and that's the end of that.
[3:47:09.900 --> 3:47:14.620]  So make sure to go to infowarstore.com, make sure to take advantage of these big deals.
[3:47:14.620 --> 3:47:18.060]  The war room is coming up next, but take the next few minutes.

[3:47:49.940 --> 3:47:55.620]  of these products are just now back in stock and may not be back for a long time when they
[3:47:55.620 --> 3:48:01.220]  sell out because of course the supply chain is collapsing right now at Joe Biden's persistence
[3:48:01.220 --> 3:48:07.220]  and insistence and we do not know when we will be able to get these products back.
[3:48:07.220 --> 3:48:11.980]  Coming up next is Owen Schreuer live at the war room studio right here.
[3:48:11.980 --> 3:48:14.420]  Owen, tell us what's up.
[3:48:14.420 --> 3:48:18.500]  Well you were just touching on the story that's going to lead today.
[3:48:18.500 --> 3:48:22.980]  Not just is it the U.S. Postal Service that's spying on American citizens.
[3:48:22.980 --> 3:48:27.980]  If we're going to be completely honest about this, this is the federal government targeting
[3:48:27.980 --> 3:48:31.620]  and persecuting Trump supporters specifically.
[3:48:31.620 --> 3:48:35.980]  And I believe the reason why that March 20th date was significant in these government documents
[3:48:35.980 --> 3:48:39.500]  because that was when the fake news was saying we were going to have what was at our third
[3:48:39.500 --> 3:48:40.500]  insurrection they said.
[3:48:40.500 --> 3:48:41.500]  Right.
[3:48:41.500 --> 3:48:43.900]  It was like the next planned insurrection of Trump supporters, of course that was all
[3:48:43.900 --> 3:48:44.900]  made up.
[3:48:44.900 --> 3:48:50.580]  That coined the term blue and on where you had liberal media just making things up out
[3:48:50.580 --> 3:48:52.980]  of a whole cloth that Trump supporters were organizing.
[3:48:52.980 --> 3:48:55.060]  Nope, never had anything to do with that.
[3:48:55.060 --> 3:48:59.340]  So it's really incredible and this is why we see people getting arrested that were there
[3:48:59.340 --> 3:49:05.060]  on January 6th, the FBI doing all of this work to try to identify these people, putting
[3:49:05.060 --> 3:49:11.180]  out their photos on the internet harassing grandmas, harassing pregnant single mothers
[3:49:11.180 --> 3:49:12.340]  and all of this stuff.
[3:49:12.340 --> 3:49:16.620]  This is the targeted persecution of Trump supporters by the federal government, Tom.
[3:49:16.620 --> 3:49:21.460]  Wow, big, big news coming up next on the war room and Owen of course it's always a new
[3:49:21.460 --> 3:49:22.940]  government agency doing this.
[3:49:22.940 --> 3:49:27.340]  We got wise to the FBI, we got wise to the NSA, we get wise to all these three letter
[3:49:27.340 --> 3:49:28.340]  agencies.
[3:49:28.340 --> 3:49:29.340]  So what do they do?
[3:49:29.340 --> 3:49:34.140]  They find a four letter agency, the United States Postal Service enlisted to spy on you,
[3:49:34.140 --> 3:49:35.660]  a supporter of President Donald Trump.
[3:49:35.660 --> 3:49:54.340]  Owen Troyer, up next, don't forget to watch the war room.
