[04:23.360 --> 04:29.440]  you see what the eu's doing now with all their censorship reaching into the us and they actually
[04:29.440 --> 04:35.680]  said that he would then control and that only their news would be pushed to everyone and guess
[04:35.680 --> 04:41.840]  what hillary lost they still went ahead with it though and trump needs to do something about this
[04:41.840 --> 04:46.080]  he's talking about the watch and post now they're owned by bezos and now they're liars and now he

[06:20.320 --> 06:23.520]  unbelievable the amount of news and information we have here today
[06:23.520 --> 06:31.280]  i ran is a lot bigger foe than iraq and if you know the history you know the cia
[06:31.920 --> 06:37.920]  put saddam hussein into power as the head of the bass security apparatus they told the bath
[06:37.920 --> 06:43.920]  part of they quit assassinating him in 1970 if they put saddam hussein as the head of security
[06:44.560 --> 06:49.920]  then nine years later the cia funded a coup against the bath his leadership and put saddam
[06:49.920 --> 06:58.400]  hussein in three years later the u.s funded saddam billions of dollars to launch the iran iraq war
[06:58.400 --> 07:05.280]  they killed about two and a half million iranians 900 000 iraqis died in that war and then the u.s
[07:05.280 --> 07:10.160]  turned around under new policies under george herbert walker bush had said us 32 billion dollars
[07:12.160 --> 07:19.520]  and saddam trained by the cia in 1958 to 1960 uh this is all in the congressional record
[07:19.520 --> 07:24.480]  shed i have been loyal to the united states and we just lost 900 000 people that's that's money
[07:24.480 --> 07:30.960]  that you were supposed to forgive via our oil sales but instead they drove the prices down as
[07:30.960 --> 07:36.880]  you remember shed him up went in destabilized the country pulled out and then went back in
[07:36.880 --> 07:41.360]  2003 took him out i'm not saying he's an angel i'm not saying i like him but he was like qaddafi
[07:43.200 --> 07:48.880]  but previously he totally worked for the u.s qaddafi never did he was a real resistance guy
[07:48.880 --> 07:55.280]  of terror as to social let's call him what you want he came out of the cold for eight years
[07:55.280 --> 08:00.320]  invested tens of billions exactly where the u.s and exactly where france used to control libya
[08:00.320 --> 08:05.600]  told him to do it that was his deal he loved obama met with him he was totally set up
[08:06.480 --> 08:12.160]  and was calling us congressmen and others that we've talked to on air saying i have the agreements
[08:12.160 --> 08:17.760]  i have everything i went to france they came here and we're we're friends well why i let you
[08:17.760 --> 08:23.600]  have the whole country i just want to build it up i want i want universities and big buildings and
[08:23.600 --> 08:29.360]  we have a big aquifer they said dude we're destabilizing all africa we're going to destroy you it was
[08:29.360 --> 08:37.520]  very evil now trump says that's all wrong trump says that's wrong he's being pragmatic and saying
[08:37.520 --> 08:41.040]  we want to have stability in the middle east he's gone and told saudi arabia that and they say they've
[08:41.040 --> 08:44.800]  gotten on board with it who knows if that's going to actually pan out but trump's crying
[08:44.800 --> 08:53.680]  i ran is in a different kettle of fish they are the chiites they're 19 of islam they are
[08:53.680 --> 08:59.600]  hereditary that's why the i told us all look alike because they're a form of religious royalty
[09:00.240 --> 09:08.320]  they are a form of monotheistic royalty a royal priest class uh that is insular and and a lex
[09:08.320 --> 09:13.040]  into itself and of course you have all the inbreeding like the british and royalty and the german
[09:13.040 --> 09:18.640]  royalty and you've got the mental illness that comes with that the paranoia but i mean if you
[09:18.640 --> 09:24.080]  look at the i told us there's a reason they look all the same like the czar looked compared to
[09:25.200 --> 09:30.160]  his british cousin the king of england if you ever look at the last czar and the king of england
[09:30.160 --> 09:35.360]  at the time you couldn't differentiate the two apart same height same look same mole same eyes
[09:35.920 --> 09:39.840]  their wives in fact they even did some jokes when they were visiting each other couldn't tell them
[09:39.840 --> 09:46.400]  apart when they wore each other's uniforms and of course world war one came along and the brits
[09:46.400 --> 09:50.160]  set up their own cousins and flushed them down the toilet and put the bolsheviks in power but
[09:50.160 --> 09:57.920]  that's a whole other story yes the uh czars were german royalty which are really the eastern royalty
[09:57.920 --> 10:02.480]  that came in and took over the austrian hungarian empire so you want to go back hungarian romanian
[10:02.480 --> 10:07.360]  mixed with germans yeah there they are there's the king of england and the king of russia indistinguishable
[10:07.360 --> 10:14.560]  like a breed of dog there are german shepherds and other dogs are so bred so close you can't
[10:14.560 --> 10:17.440]  tell them apart even though they're different from different letters different mothers different
[10:17.440 --> 10:23.840]  fathers but i'm digressing when i see a problem i have a lot of history i bring to it and that's
[10:23.840 --> 10:28.640]  what's so frustrating about all of this is that the average person doesn't have the background
[10:28.640 --> 10:35.280]  to understand what's happening so iran has nuclear weapons i confirmed that over the decade ago from
[10:35.280 --> 10:40.560]  high level sources now you see that the news this year that they've really got nukes already um
[10:41.200 --> 10:44.800]  pakistan obviously has over 100 and they have delivery systems as well so does india india's
[10:44.800 --> 10:50.880]  probably got 300 400 israel's got over a thousand now and high tech delivery systems cruise missiles
[10:50.880 --> 10:58.400]  submarine launched air launched icbm medium range everything uh so it's a giant tender box
[10:58.400 --> 11:05.440]  in history no one ever stops weapons proliferation and it's it's happened and so iran is
[11:07.520 --> 11:12.560]  teetering on collapse they've got their oil export they can't even refine their own oil
[11:13.760 --> 11:22.160]  and so they've been funding hezbollah in syria and other areas and the pentagon made a deal
[11:22.160 --> 11:30.400]  when they told obama that they weren't going to back al-qaeda and isis and turn over syria to al-qaeda
[11:30.400 --> 11:35.280]  and isis they believe it's just become a huge quagmire and draw the us into it be worse than
[11:35.280 --> 11:39.440]  vietnam so they told obama if you remember no we're not going to do this was right after bengasi
[11:39.440 --> 11:44.320]  the military basically threatened obama with a coup they said we're not doing this but now
[11:44.320 --> 11:49.680]  five six years later iran made a deal behind the scenes we first broke all this all later came out
[11:49.680 --> 11:56.240]  other sources that once we stabilize you're not going to have a shiai kingdom we're not going to
[11:56.240 --> 12:01.600]  have a sunni kingdom it's going to be run the way it's been run with real elections with a coalition
[12:01.600 --> 12:09.040]  government and Assad agrees to step down after there are real elections we've now moved up to
[12:09.040 --> 12:15.600]  that timetable and even though trump is in charge to a certain extent there's a lot of games going
[12:15.600 --> 12:20.800]  on with the pentagon still backing some al-qaeda groups israel's been caught doing it as well
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.760]  that's just a fact that's going on in the south and the iranians are saying we're not leaving
[12:25.760 --> 12:33.360]  we're not leaving lebanon we're not leaving syria we're not leaving anywhere and so trump has been
[12:33.360 --> 12:40.960]  backing opposition inside iran about 75 of people don't like the mulas more than half their populations
[12:40.960 --> 12:46.560]  under the age of 30 people there's internal polls they do not like the mulas it's a dictatorship
[12:47.280 --> 12:53.280]  who likes royalty anyways but but but that's what that islamic state is now under that particular
[12:53.280 --> 13:00.080]  brand of shiai islam so they are now threatening that's the background they are now threatening
[13:00.800 --> 13:06.160]  to attack the united states the mother of all the wars shidam said that on the eve of the first
[13:06.160 --> 13:12.480]  gulf war and of course the united states just went in and bought off about 80 of his generals
[13:13.280 --> 13:18.080]  so they stood down and would actually be waiting at the convoy lines to be paid off
[13:18.960 --> 13:25.920]  then the united states blew up more than 70 chemical bunkers chemical weapons rained down
[13:27.040 --> 13:32.640]  low dosages but it still created the gulf war syndrome with that top scientist top army experts
[13:32.640 --> 13:37.200]  medical doctors on like doug rocky to break all that down so we ended up having hundreds of thousands
[13:37.200 --> 13:43.440]  die in the next decade from gulf war illness because the order went in by the un that was in
[13:43.440 --> 13:49.440]  control that was a un operation commanding us forces you look it up to to destroy the chemicals
[13:49.440 --> 13:58.480]  in place camicia was the biggest chemical weapons bunker in the world so very bizarre to have the
[13:58.480 --> 14:05.520]  ayatollah the hereditary shiai dictator of iran who they flew in out of abstentia with the ayatollah
[14:05.520 --> 14:13.120]  homani in 79 by the way the cia was really behind that old double cross then and then the iranians
[14:13.120 --> 14:20.000]  flipped on him iran warns trump not to cut off oil exports threatens mother of all wars don't play
[14:20.000 --> 14:28.960]  with the lion's tail this one only lead to regret and then trump tells iran's dictator never
[14:28.960 --> 14:34.400]  threaten the us again or suffer consequences and we've already uh read that tweet to you but let's
[14:34.400 --> 14:38.400]  pull up trump's tweet because it's pretty important we'll probably read that a second time here in
[14:38.400 --> 14:44.720]  a moment to iranian president never ever threatens he's addressing the president and again the the
[14:44.720 --> 14:50.400]  ayatollah's pick who can run for president so it's it's kind of like the communist central committee
[14:52.160 --> 14:57.760]  and polo bureau picks who's allowed to they elect the president i mean it's it's it's pretty much
[14:57.760 --> 15:01.680]  the same thing they're doing here uh but but iran they let them have an election but they choose
[15:01.680 --> 15:07.280]  who can run iranian president never ever threaten the united states again or you will suffer consequences
[15:07.280 --> 15:12.960]  of lives of which few throughout history have ever suffered before you are no longer a country
[15:12.960 --> 15:18.960]  that will stand for your demented words of violence and death be cautious so the us is no longer a
[15:18.960 --> 15:23.280]  country that will put up with that type of stuff we will uh go over all of that president trump's
[15:23.280 --> 15:29.360]  highest approval rating ever in wall street journal mbc poll trump says carter page fives

[15:38.400 --> 15:44.160]  then they went and got a fake warrant to reverse engineer it or to parallel construct it after that

[20:23.280 --> 20:36.320]  i ran is in control of their sizable military iran's paramilitary force hezbollah is stationed
[20:36.320 --> 20:42.080]  all over the world and is infiltrated western countries everywhere and if there is a war
[20:42.080 --> 20:51.760]  with iran undoubtedly there will be a massive serious real terror attacks all over the united
[20:51.760 --> 20:58.240]  states all over europe anyone involved in the attack that's why if iran does launch attacks on
[20:58.240 --> 21:02.560]  our ships where it's most likely to start they've already been doing it and trump says he won't
[21:02.560 --> 21:08.000]  just let them belligerently grab our forces or attack them we have to have a overwhelming
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.040]  response decapitating the iranian leadership immediately and you'll probably have to hit
[21:13.040 --> 21:18.320]  their forces in the field with very very heavy weapons and when i say heavy weapons i'm talking
[21:18.320 --> 21:23.360]  about tactical nuclear weapons so expect that to be used the middle east and if anybody
[21:24.960 --> 21:28.880]  moves in any direction with another nuclear power like they're going to try to block us
[21:28.880 --> 21:33.680]  they're going to end up getting hit so i can tell you right now under u.s military doctrine we are
[21:33.680 --> 21:40.240]  very close to the final death con right now with iran threatening preemptive attacks on the united
[21:40.240 --> 21:46.640]  states they are not saddam hussein whose military was set up by the cia who advised them for decades
[21:46.640 --> 21:51.120]  who had relationships with all of them so they could be paid off to stand down and i'm not saying
[21:51.120 --> 21:56.000]  our military didn't face a lot of stuff in gulf war one or gulf war two militias in fighting groups
[21:56.000 --> 22:03.760]  some of the military fought back chemicals in the air du but a war with iran could very possibly
[22:03.760 --> 22:09.680]  trigger a new world war most analysts believe and that's why trump's been trying to have
[22:09.680 --> 22:15.840]  peace through strength we've broken it all down we're going to break it more down in detail
[22:15.840 --> 22:24.480]  as this information unfolds now let's let's get into the other news here in this segment i want
[22:24.480 --> 22:31.520]  to just have a smattering of news so folks get an idea how i analyze information and how my brain
[22:31.520 --> 22:42.320]  works i've got an article here it's a big scandal in the la times you name it that la authorities
[22:42.320 --> 22:47.680]  recorded privilege attorney client conversations district attorney says and it's a huge scandal
[22:47.680 --> 22:54.160]  and all these convictions and things may be thrown out of court because it says it's illegal
[22:54.960 --> 23:02.960]  illegal is the word illegal see right there of your tv viewer illegal now how does my brain work
[23:02.960 --> 23:11.840]  political ap reuters last week on monday had the headline mewler is listening to
[23:12.640 --> 23:19.360]  maniforts jail calls about his legal defense and then filed in federal court telling
[23:19.920 --> 23:26.240]  because they have two cases against him one obstructing and then the other money laundering
[23:27.200 --> 23:31.200]  so they've charged him in relation to this case that they're listening to everything he's doing
[23:31.200 --> 23:36.880]  and then they use his legal arguments saying we know he doesn't really uh he'll have a defense but
[23:36.880 --> 23:41.920]  he just wants to stall these and wants to have this other case first so we want him in solitary
[23:41.920 --> 23:50.080]  confinement see when i saw those headlines and read that the top of my head blew off and then
[23:50.080 --> 23:58.880]  i talked about it on air and no one even cared it's in the constitution you don't do that and
[23:58.880 --> 24:03.520]  they tried this weird double speaker they go well they didn't listen to his attorneys they listened
[24:03.520 --> 24:10.720]  to him talk to his advisors about his legal strategy you don't listen to people's jail phone calls
[24:12.720 --> 24:17.680]  and you sure don't take it and then put it in a federal filing to a judge
[24:19.520 --> 24:25.120]  saying we want we want you to try this case first because we heard his legal theory is to try this
[24:25.120 --> 24:30.080]  other one first because he believes it will show exculpatory evidence in the other case well that
[24:30.080 --> 24:34.720]  just proves his point and i even called some lawyers i know criminal lawyers some really good
[24:34.720 --> 24:39.200]  ones i have a good criminal lawyer not i've ever needed him but i use him for rob do and they have
[24:39.200 --> 24:44.800]  a large settlement for when the police wrongfully arrested him covering an event in cleveland but
[24:44.800 --> 24:58.080]  that's a another subject was the g20 the point is is that they said absolutely that's crazy
[24:58.080 --> 25:04.720]  send me the article and they couldn't believe it and i'm telling you even sienna has admitted man
[25:04.720 --> 25:09.200]  mulars took the gloves off he's been doing stuff for a year and a half nobody's ever done boy
[25:09.840 --> 25:13.440]  and the federal judges are like yeah you can grab everything in his house doesn't matter if it's not
[25:13.440 --> 25:24.400]  on the warrant and they're charging for offshore bank accounts that are legal and lawful and claiming
[25:24.400 --> 25:31.680]  he didn't declare all his taxes 14 years ago it just shows how out of control it is meanwhile
[25:31.680 --> 25:43.280]  muller is on the tarmac giving uranium to the russians for hillary clinton when she's
[25:43.280 --> 25:50.480]  secretary of state in 2010 for a deal and i went and pulled up the new york times the
[25:50.480 --> 25:55.440]  washington post back when they were somewhat truthful at the time and i've got the articles
[25:55.440 --> 25:59.520]  and anybody could pull them up where they were like man this is really unethical that he's doing
[25:59.520 --> 26:04.800]  this for the secretary of state while her husband's making a deal uranium one for hundreds of millions
[26:04.800 --> 26:08.240]  of dollars that they made and tony podesta made tens of millions
[26:11.600 --> 26:18.960]  but then you go to snopes literally funded by george solrose and they go oh it's not true
[26:18.960 --> 26:26.480]  but don't show any facts it's in the news they admit it look at this can't make it up fact checker who
[26:26.480 --> 26:33.520]  misidentified ice agents nazi tattoo hired by media matters to research alt right it's the same thing
[26:33.520 --> 26:39.440]  they just hire these complete cookballs who just make up whatever they want and they're like an
[26:39.440 --> 26:49.200]  imperial judge or something what they say right out of college is god well let's see him try to weasel
[26:49.920 --> 26:54.640]  out of this one get ready for this this was the daily caller over the weekend it was
[26:54.640 --> 26:59.360]  new york times washington post everywhere remember hillary said she thinks trump's compromise for
[26:59.360 --> 27:05.920]  meeting with putin at a sanctioned official meeting in public and behind closed doors totally normal
[27:05.920 --> 27:11.040]  everybody does that every time that's standard i tweeted it yesterday somebody made a great meme
[27:11.040 --> 27:18.560]  that shows clinton shaking hands bush shaking hands hillary shaking hands obama shaking hands
[27:18.560 --> 27:25.920]  with putin go to real alex jones on twitter guys shaking hands with everybody put shaking hands
[27:25.920 --> 27:33.680]  with everybody but then when trump does it it's called treason by brennan who is an admitted
[27:33.680 --> 27:40.880]  member of the communist party so go to real alex jones on twitter it's a great little meme we put
[27:40.880 --> 27:48.080]  out um on my twitter yesterday i sent it out about uh four o'clock and i'll show people that when we
[27:48.080 --> 27:55.680]  come back but here it is hillary trashes trump over putin meeting suggests he's compromised
[27:57.440 --> 28:04.080]  and then it goes on breaking hillary clinton admits she met secretly with putin in 2014
[28:04.080 --> 28:12.560]  oh and where'd i get this from her own book hard choices and she says she bonded with him
[28:12.560 --> 28:17.680]  for hours in his inner sanctum in a secret meeting that she only revealed in the book
[28:17.680 --> 28:22.320]  so hillary clinton whilst he's at the state department is having secret unsanctioned
[28:24.640 --> 28:29.600]  violations of the logan act and then trump does it all officially and correctly and he's the trader

[32:12.480 --> 32:18.880]  market and consolidate total control dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines and
[32:18.880 --> 32:23.920]  trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future they are launching a civil
[32:23.920 --> 32:29.040]  war against nation states right now collapsing our borders and my only message is this everybody
[32:29.040 --> 32:34.320]  better wake up and realize the fight is now everybody should be very very urgent because the
[32:34.320 --> 32:39.520]  left and the globalists are frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control
[32:39.520 --> 32:44.800]  people those of us that are pro-human don't crave power we already have the power but we have to
[32:44.800 --> 32:50.960]  realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now info wars is on
[32:50.960 --> 33:09.360]  the front line and so are you we are the resistance you're listening to the alex jones show

[33:46.080 --> 33:58.880]  listening to alex jones the amount of demonization and attacks that info wars is under is absolutely
[33:58.880 --> 34:04.320]  exponential and it's because the globalists know we're paying attention they know we have memories
[34:04.320 --> 34:11.200]  they know we're pointing out their lies in real time but i'll tell you something i put a story
[34:11.200 --> 34:19.120]  out yesterday with kit daniels i shot a special report roger stone covered it the story got picked
[34:19.120 --> 34:25.680]  up all over the internet but no one else from breitbart to the daily caller to tucker carlson
[34:25.680 --> 34:32.720]  and i'm i'm gonna send him a text message with the article has picked it up when it's so dynamite
[34:32.720 --> 34:40.640]  it's so critical hillary clinton has come out and said she believes the russians are going to steal
[34:40.640 --> 34:48.880]  the 2018 election with no proof and then she wants obama's executive order not rescinded by president
[34:48.880 --> 34:56.640]  trump protested by all 50 state attorney generals that was even in the hill newspaper last year
[34:57.440 --> 35:03.280]  letters signed by all 50 ag's you ever heard of that happening 20 something of them democrat
[35:03.280 --> 35:08.640]  saying no we don't want this executive order implemented it's total federalization by homeland
[35:08.640 --> 35:19.360]  security they're talking about tsa running the election facilities i'm not getting notice tsa
[35:19.360 --> 35:23.440]  has already been hired to do proms and high school and college football games they actually say
[35:23.440 --> 35:30.400]  homeland security using the tsa and other systems federal marshals will come into all your local
[35:30.400 --> 35:37.040]  voting facilities and make sure the russians don't steal it oh oh you go oh that's okay trump's in power
[35:37.040 --> 35:42.400]  it's unconstitutional it's a separation of powers is there it's the federalist system it's violating
[35:42.400 --> 35:49.280]  that between state and federal it's unconstitutional it's insane it's super dangerous it gets rid of
[35:49.280 --> 35:55.360]  checks and balances it allows centralized fraud and we caught hillary breaking into what five
[35:55.360 --> 36:01.200]  different states they caught her and blocked her no no she stole five states they blocked her at six
[36:01.200 --> 36:06.640]  members state attorney generals came out and said yeah we caught homeland security breaking into
[36:06.640 --> 36:16.960]  computers trying to float it for hillary this all came out so that's what's going on ladies and
[36:16.960 --> 36:24.160]  gentlemen obama signed executive order attempting to federalize elections so they talk about protecting
[36:24.160 --> 36:28.080]  and that's what they're doing they mean taking them over like venezuela so you never have another
[36:28.080 --> 36:35.040]  real election again there it is obama regime moves to federalize elections so you can also type it in
[36:35.040 --> 36:40.400]  all 50 attorney generals state attorney generals shine letter shang do not implement this to trump
[36:41.840 --> 36:46.080]  but trump's so busy so much is going on how can he keep track of it all we have to make it a big
[36:46.080 --> 36:51.600]  issue we have to hammer it so hillary says in in the speech she gave we're gonna play some of it
[36:51.600 --> 36:58.400]  here in a moment that she slams trump at ozzy fest that's not ozzy osbourne it's some manhater
[36:58.400 --> 37:04.640]  event hillary claims trump has compromised and that he and the russians are going to steal the
[37:04.640 --> 37:13.520]  election she she knows the blue wave is bye bye and she knows that america is awake and she knows
[37:13.520 --> 37:20.000]  with sanders and cortege running around saying we're gonna have socialism and communism and
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.720]  we're gonna have free health care and free schooling and free this and free that that
[37:24.720 --> 37:29.600]  people know venezuela doesn't work fundamentally our own crony capitalist system's got its own
[37:29.600 --> 37:35.200]  problems but a lot does trickle down just look at all the wealth are there a bunch of rich king
[37:35.200 --> 37:40.240]  pens that own it all yeah but but they own the facilities and the structures we live in
[37:41.440 --> 37:45.040]  and by the way almost all those billionaires are globalists because they want to consolidate power
[37:45.040 --> 37:51.360]  so they've got all the democrats running around saying stop at cortez stop at sanders stop taking
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.760]  us to the left you've always been communist you've always been socialist they're making their move
[37:56.320 --> 38:02.320]  this is what they want they want free stuff now these aren't smart people their constituents aren't
[38:02.320 --> 38:10.720]  smart so hillary comes out and says you met with putin even though it was a sanctioned
[38:10.720 --> 38:16.400]  event and you're the president but when she was in the state department she violated the logon act
[38:16.400 --> 38:21.680]  and secretly met with him on multiple occasions and then put it in her book like oh i met with
[38:21.680 --> 38:27.520]  him privately about Siberian tigers in his home clearly the cover meanwhile it turns out even the

[39:14.480 --> 39:20.400]  russian collusion because why he's the man running the inquisition of the evil tea party in america

[39:53.680 --> 39:57.760]  his security clearance and still has access at the highest levels to the nsa and all of your data
[39:57.760 --> 40:02.400]  as the former cia director and today senator rand paul will meet with the president and
[40:02.400 --> 40:06.720]  ask to revoke john brennan's security clearance by the way if people don't believe me just type in

[40:15.280 --> 40:22.400]  there it is america's leading neocon attack dog was a communist he's just a villain ladies and
[40:22.400 --> 40:28.560]  gentlemen but but here are the articles breaking hillary clinton admits she secretly met with
[40:28.560 --> 40:35.200]  putin in 2014 i have screenshots of her book and her statements in 2014 and then i backtracked because
[40:35.200 --> 40:40.720]  i knew that that was her cover so i went and looked it all up and there it was her getting her
[40:40.720 --> 40:45.200]  husband to meet with putin six times over the iranium them getting hundreds of millions of dollars
[40:45.200 --> 40:52.400]  unbelievable in the wiki leaks hillary bragged about being invited to putin's inner sanctum in
[40:52.400 --> 41:07.600]  his home where she stayed the night when she was the secretary of state all secret and then years
[41:07.600 --> 41:16.000]  later to cover her butt she puts in her book about we've talked about tigers and bunny rabbits
[41:16.240 --> 41:20.720]  bragged about being invited bill clinton sought state's permission to meet with russian nuclear
[41:20.720 --> 41:29.520]  officials during obama uranium decision 2010 2011 look at that everything they say it was
[41:29.520 --> 41:38.320]  go oh iranium hillary iranium hillary look at the details saying it putin's house sleeping in his guest bedroom
[41:38.400 --> 41:42.720]  the clinton's were like in russia half the time clinton foundation chatter with state
[41:42.720 --> 41:50.000]  department of iranium deal with russia wiki leaks hillary clinton says that you can't
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.480]  trust trump he's an asset he's an agent of putin for having an official meeting
[41:54.480 --> 42:02.800]  isn't that unbelievable but that's how they operate and that's how dumb they think you are
[42:02.800 --> 42:09.120]  and then no one even cares in the news cycle everyone is obsessed with whatever's new so here
[42:09.120 --> 42:12.960]  we are in plain view them trying to take over the election sharing the russians are going to do it
[42:12.960 --> 42:18.160]  again when they didn't do it in the first place the russians did come get uranium hell if we're
[42:18.160 --> 42:21.200]  going to sell it to them if we got traders in the government that's what's going to happen
[42:21.200 --> 42:26.480]  like putin said he respects trump trump is for us interest putin is for russian interest
[42:26.480 --> 42:30.960]  there's a lot of respect there because trump isn't a trader and the russians respect that
[42:30.960 --> 42:34.480]  our country has had america's legs all the way back behind our ears
[42:35.120 --> 42:38.640]  pimping us out of the whole world and it's trying to come to an end so the traders like

[47:34.640 --> 47:40.560]  so much of the news but let me just make this point infinity clear let me just make this point
[47:41.120 --> 47:48.560]  absolutely sterling info wars job is taking critical intel whether it be breaking news
[47:49.120 --> 47:55.360]  secret information controversial info or old info that nobody's paying attention to
[47:55.360 --> 48:01.280]  and ramming it out there and blowing a hole into the news cycle and making people cover it
[48:01.280 --> 48:06.480]  well that's why they hate us because time and time again because of you the audience
[48:06.480 --> 48:11.360]  being activist and being involved in spreading the word by mouth and by email and by facebook
[48:11.360 --> 48:15.840]  and twitter and youtube and calling in to talk radio and c span and going to clinton events
[48:15.840 --> 48:20.320]  and getting in their face legally and lawfully you're changing the world they're scared of your
[48:20.320 --> 48:28.240]  activism they're scared of your will hillary clinton admittedly met in secret with putin
[48:28.240 --> 48:35.040]  repeatedly she got waivers for bill clinton to make uranium deals with him and now it's coming out
[48:35.760 --> 48:40.080]  and you say yeah we already know that but the big news is she said trump can't be trusted
[48:40.080 --> 48:45.440]  for a sanctioned legal meeting with putin and that he's a traitor that the election should
[48:45.440 --> 48:50.560]  be taken over by the democrats so then you point out that she literally met with him illegally
[48:50.560 --> 48:56.160]  and secretly and violated the logan act and we have all the proof from her own book hard choices
[48:56.160 --> 49:01.200]  and then the state department record where they had to get waivers to do it because that was illegal
[49:03.200 --> 49:07.040]  and who around the state department she did so she ordered her underlings to give her husband
[49:07.040 --> 49:12.240]  waivers for hundreds of millions of dollars of weapons grade us uranium and robert muhler
[49:12.240 --> 49:19.280]  delivered the sample that's right out of a james bond movie where you catch specter doing bad stuff
[49:19.280 --> 49:30.160]  and so it needs to be covered paul tweeted it yesterday i tweeted it today i tweeted it again
[49:30.800 --> 49:36.400]  yesterday just get the articles and get it out to everybody and i don't care if info wars gets the
[49:36.400 --> 49:41.760]  credit there's breitbart articles from a year and a half ago info wars articles from a year and a
[49:41.760 --> 49:47.280]  half ago two years ago videos we did with elin schreuer two years ago i don't care about the
[49:47.280 --> 49:53.280]  credit i want these criminals stopped i want these traders out of our country i want them off our back
[49:56.320 --> 50:02.880]  so talk radio everybody this is bomb shell but again they just wear you out with everybody knows
[50:02.880 --> 50:10.080]  hillary was with the russians this is all a big scam i know but she says trump has been caught red
[50:10.080 --> 50:15.760]  handed because he had a public meeting that means he's a trader and brennan calls it treason when
[50:15.760 --> 50:23.040]  these guys literally sold us out to the russians and the chinese 100 times that literally the articles
[50:23.040 --> 50:28.080]  on info wars dot com get it out folks i had a repost from yesterday it's just our article
[50:28.080 --> 50:33.520]  boiling it down showing the history of it and it's even worse than we say most of the time i
[50:33.520 --> 50:39.680]  read our articles i get mad because there's so much even more proof but you just it's dizzying
[50:39.680 --> 50:45.440]  ladies and gentlemen i'm looking at the state department record here in my hand and then john
[50:45.440 --> 50:49.840]  brennan an admitted communist and a wahhabist any evil group he goes and joins it former head of
[50:49.840 --> 50:56.720]  the ci and it sold the country out to everybody he then says that trump is a trader
[51:00.800 --> 51:05.440]  by the way i'm not just loyal to trump i'm loyal the fact that trump keeps telling the truth
[51:05.440 --> 51:09.840]  and taking action and doing a great job and being attacked and i've been persecuted for standing up
[51:09.840 --> 51:16.160]  for trump and the truth and and it just makes it that much more precious the more i get attacked
[51:16.160 --> 51:24.000]  it doesn't make me want to let go the more i pay for this and the more i see us actually turning
[51:24.000 --> 51:30.240]  around i am absolutely so honored to be in this position i am extremely honored to be here i'm
[51:30.240 --> 51:35.680]  very thankful to all of you and i just thank you for your prayers and and i was up at oma hall
[51:35.680 --> 51:41.120]  visiting my wife's family for a couple days her dad's been sick but he's doing good now
[51:41.120 --> 51:48.800]  so she wanted to go visiting heart surgery uh recently and i just got mobbed by these great
[51:48.800 --> 51:55.760]  looking families hispanic black white old young native american mobbed at the airport and just
[51:55.760 --> 52:03.120]  great people great people and it was just so good to run into all of them and i'm not gonna
[52:03.120 --> 52:06.800]  let those folks down i'm not gonna let my children down i'm not gonna let your children down i'm gonna
[52:06.800 --> 52:11.920]  do the best job i can all right let me tell you what's coming up here because there's just so much
[52:15.200 --> 52:18.160]  mike sernovich i should have told you right up at the start of the show obviously
[52:18.800 --> 52:25.520]  deep six the pito fanboy we don't know if he has sex with children but uh let's let's
[52:25.520 --> 52:30.640]  pretty much those off the guy that directed guardians of the galaxy i guess made his bones
[52:30.640 --> 52:35.040]  on twitter talking about how great it is to have sex with children and then a bunch of comedians
[52:35.040 --> 52:40.720]  came out defended him and then we went looked at their twitter's and they all say hey let kids
[52:40.720 --> 52:44.080]  have sex with adults that way they won't get kidnapped and killed that's a namble statement
[52:44.720 --> 52:50.080]  and so they're saying sernovich is bad because he said date rape doesn't exist if a woman later
[52:50.080 --> 52:54.480]  says that you didn't force her but she didn't consent that's just feminist garbage saying all
[52:54.480 --> 52:59.840]  sex is rape they then call sernovich a a rapist when clearly the type of date rape he's talking
[52:59.840 --> 53:04.160]  about where a woman just says i didn't give consent but i didn't stop him that's not rape
[53:05.360 --> 53:09.600]  and so what he's pointing out is the truth it lessens real rape and then it lessens people
[53:09.600 --> 53:15.600]  saying they want to have sex with children and then meanwhile they go oh he's a pizza gate
[53:15.600 --> 53:25.840]  reporter he reported on the new york times the washington post distracting off of the jerry
[53:25.840 --> 53:31.440]  eppstein lolita express airplane with bill clinton on it and weiner and the laptops and the state
[53:31.440 --> 53:36.240]  police reports we broke here that it had little girls naked and all the rest of it before it was
[53:36.240 --> 53:41.440]  even in the news uh former head of blackwater turn head of xc came out said the same thing
[53:41.440 --> 53:51.200]  erik prince and they distracted onto the pizza place and got us to cover it and then said oh
[53:51.200 --> 53:55.120]  look they're wrong about the pizza place classic bait and switch he learned how this stuff works
[53:57.760 --> 54:02.880]  but now we're on to it but then they go oh look the this credited pizza gate so they use pizza
[54:02.880 --> 54:07.280]  gate like pedophilia doesn't exist but it's all over the place record buster happening and they
[54:07.280 --> 54:13.040]  don't know what to do so you've got all these people defending james gunne
[54:15.520 --> 54:21.040]  mike sarin what's coming up then we have uh the editor of west minister coming on to talk
[54:21.040 --> 54:26.400]  about this subject and then linel now let me tell you what i've got here and when you read this you

[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:28.240]  from deep in the heart of fema region six austin texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:33.440]  all right mike cernovich is coming on with some of the most critical information we could cover
[1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:39.280]  if you want victory and that's going through the twitter pages of every major democrat and
[1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:43.840]  liberal you know because i'd say about half of them talk about how they like to have sexual kids
[1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:50.640]  that's their religion you don't get in the club at the high level as a as a movie star as a director
[1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:54.880]  particularly disney's been caught rehiring convicted child rapist that actually raped
[1:00:54.880 --> 1:00:59.120]  ten-year-old boys and girls it's a cult out there the average person doesn't believe it
[1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:04.560]  because we're not into that you know but but these people are sick and so mike cernovich has been
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:09.520]  exposing it he's been demonized he's come up the next segment and they get a lot of so-called
[1:01:09.520 --> 1:01:13.520]  conservatives libertarians want to get brownie points for the leftist media they'll like join in
[1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:18.160]  and go oh yeah cernovich is this or that and then they'll go off some fake quote or some edited quote
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:22.880]  but in this short segment i want to address something right now because it ties into that
[1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:30.640]  it ties into matt gates i remember when roger stone was helping get matt gates elected a couple
[1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:35.840]  years ago matt gates is a smart articulate guy he's been on the show i like what he does
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:41.040]  i've been trying to get matt gates to champion internet freedom and understand that these things
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:45.040]  are utilities that are selectively banning conservatives and libertarians that they're
[1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:48.400]  shadow banning the president's tweets and that and that he could be a champion of that
[1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:55.520]  they have a hearings last tuesday gates sits there and listens to google facebook and twitter
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:02.320]  the youtube subsidiary say that i said no one died at parkland and that my youtube channel was taken
[1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:08.880]  down well number one it was taken down and put back up because i didn't say that but even if i
[1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:12.640]  said that it's my right but i didn't i said there was a police stand down which was confirmed and
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:17.520]  they didn't like that because we had kids on the show and then local news clips we would show
[1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:21.760]  people shooting videos over a news camera that never made it on the news so they were pissed about
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:27.200]  that the videos had millions of views they took them down then they said our video i said that
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:33.600]  they were all crisis actors from california and that nobody died i never said that it was so painful
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:39.280]  because i know gates has been told that that he went and did i'm talking a hundred interviews or
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:44.720]  more he was just he was all over he just he did he loved it he goes oh yeah alex jones is bad but i
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:48.960]  think they should ban people that also threaten to hunt republicans and i confronted him on that he
[1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:53.440]  said you know about how they leave up these sites saying you know good job killing trying to kill
[1:02:53.440 --> 1:03:01.360]  scolese so he equated me with that threw me under the bus mega massively and then went along and here
[1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:08.720]  he is quoted representative matt gates explains his info wars conversion and then it's a weird
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:14.320]  headline and then it just goes into it and him saying oh info wars is hurtful uh info wars
[1:03:17.760 --> 1:03:19.360]  you know uh says things that are bad
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:26.800]  and he goes on and says that content where he said parkland students didn't die and bullied them
[1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:31.760]  has been taken down and so all i'm asking is stuff saying kill republicans take that down too
[1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:37.280]  so man he knows exactly what he's doing he's calculated that going along with them lying
[1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:44.000]  about me will get him ahead no it won't gage here's another thing last time rand paul was on
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.400]  he called him wanted to come on great i've called staff want to give him time to be able back i'd
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:51.600]  call his house if i want to get him on call his wife i can get him on time i want that doesn't
[1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:56.240]  give us ratings have rand paul on having gates on nobody cared about his interview they want to hear
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:02.000]  real people like mike cernovich and in myself so here's the thing gage i'm trying to educate you
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  in congress i'm trying to inform you i don't need you to give me your little magic wand rinky dinky
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:15.600]  decoder wheel thing dude okay so thanks a lot for lying about me and going along with that crap
[1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:23.280]  that i know you've been personally told is it true that i said nobody died at parkland you might as
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:28.720]  well join the southern prairie law center or snopes buddy because if you're trying to make me angry
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:35.760]  you are really doing a good job but i get it throw somebody under the bus police other conservatives
[1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:40.880]  go along with the lies and maybe the left will eat you last you don't get leadership you don't
[1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:46.720]  understand it like president trump does well why don't you throw him under the bus they say he said
[1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:52.480]  all mexicans are criminals he never said it why don't you just go along with those lies to gates
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:58.640]  thanks a lot man thanks a lot you look like a posse made a pile of crap i want to plow into all of
[1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:04.720]  this but i'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[1:05:06.240 --> 1:05:12.400]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material
[1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:19.120]  from info or store dot com you are funding the revolution i mean i cannot say it any clear
[1:05:19.120 --> 1:05:23.440]  and so it is essential that you purchase the products at info or store dot com i don't want to
[1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:27.760]  thank everybody that has but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste with colloidal silver
[1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:32.960]  and with high quality atomic iodine in it you cannot beat that for children and adults we've
[1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:38.240]  got the best mouthwash designed by dr jones that's my dad the colloidal silver and iodine as well
[1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:43.520]  info wars life dot com or triple a two five three three one three nine and your purchase of the
[1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:48.320]  products stands with us stands with america stands with trump stands against the globalists and
[1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:52.480]  their satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are
[1:05:52.480 --> 1:06:04.960]  and they're coming back against us so we need your support
[1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:16.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:21.280]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:30.720]  my center that joins us for the hour he's the best-selling author documentary filmmaker
[1:06:32.080 --> 1:06:39.120]  talk show host and good friend of mine he came out and exposed james gunn the director of
[1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:46.880]  many big films like guardians of the galaxy one and two he was fired after hundreds of tweets
[1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:52.880]  were discovered in public view by mike sarnovich info warspole Watson then magnified that it got
[1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:58.320]  picked up a lot last week and he got fired by disney disney is famous for hiring convicted
[1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:04.960]  pedophiles who have actually raped small children to direct more films with children and they used
[1:07:04.960 --> 1:07:12.000]  the whole me too movement saying that basically a man asking a woman out is rape to smoke screen
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:18.080]  what wine steen and the lelita express and epstein all the rest of the clintons are really
[1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:25.600]  involved in so you don't get in the club at the highest levels now give you or not at least tacitly
[1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:31.120]  approving of the north american manboy love association namble agenda which says let us
[1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:37.920]  have sex with your children let them have age of consent or that's what causes them to be kidnapped
[1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:43.520]  because people can't help themselves and that's what some of the people that attack sarnovich
[1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:49.680]  so-called comedians and others said oh yeah and and so so this is a firestorm and listen we can't
[1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:55.840]  do all this as i've said if you just see a city council member who's a democrat in a big city or
[1:07:55.840 --> 1:08:01.440]  anywhere go record them tell them you got a kid you want to have sex with they'll they'll they'll
[1:08:01.440 --> 1:08:06.560]  they'll want a bite you can call the fbi i'd say about half your democrat leaders are pedophiles
[1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:13.040]  the others know remember project veritas would would five six years ago would just walk into
[1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:19.040]  random acorns and say i got an underage hooker how do i run horse they said we'll set it up for you
[1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:26.960]  right now this year they got video in in new jersey and in illinois of the heads of teacher
[1:08:26.960 --> 1:08:30.800]  union saying yeah we know teachers are having kids the elementary students and others we're just
[1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:34.720]  going to cover it up they're going to get their pension we'll get a move to another school just
[1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:40.000]  like the catholic church it's a very small percentage but they want power they want access
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:48.800]  to your kids so mike cernovich is a hero but he hasn't been completely shadow banned like
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:54.320]  real alec shones or paul watson's been partially shadow banned but now he is you search cernovich
[1:08:54.960 --> 1:08:59.200]  you don't find any of him you only find the attacks he crossed the red line so here's your
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:07.760]  headline investigative journalist mike cernovich shadow banned by twitter for exposing pedophile
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:14.960]  worshipper james gun that's what i'd call him wow that'll be good in congress won't it so here's
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:23.280]  the deal you learn where jack dorsi's heart is when you touch the big prize and you got to learn
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:27.760]  ladies and gentlemen you got to learn i've been in some big movies and i've been out in hollywood
[1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:33.360]  and i got told by folks man you understand they're either into the occult or they're into
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:38.000]  pedophilia or they're into both and he said it's bad it's it's it's the majority of people at the top
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.760]  everybody else has to live under it and put up with it and it's totally out of control and i've
[1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:45.840]  been told that by la pd detectives i've been told that by the highest levels why do you think
[1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:50.560]  everybody in hollywood who isn't evil tries to move to austin or toronto or somewhere else
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:56.960]  because it's so horrible and and you look at these guys they all have that denis hasterd look
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:00.560]  now you can say are they pedophiles all i know is they should be investigated like senator ted
[1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:07.600]  cruz tweeted when he looked at the tweets of mr gunn and others look at that look gun looks just
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:14.320]  like the subway guy compare him to the subway guy compare gun's face it's almost like a clone and then
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:19.680]  put stelter up and i'm not saying stelter's a pedophile he just looks like what they look like
[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:27.120]  and and i'm just yeah yeah yeah but but there's one shot of the subway guy when you fade it in
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:31.600]  when he's actually smiling just like that it looks just like him find it we put you showed it last week
[1:10:32.240 --> 1:10:37.440]  show here's the deal they have to constantly make jokes about it but if you read what nambla says
[1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:41.840]  and you read these tweets this is nambla propaganda they're a member of the un so mike
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:45.440]  service with us for the rest of the hour that's why it's always important to go to his actual
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:49.440]  website like we have info wars dot com and we have news wars dot com more and more you've
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:55.760]  got to go to those you need to go to cernovich dot com c e r n o v i c h at cernovich you've
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:11:02.320]  got to go to his page itself yeah look at that that's the subway guy subway spokesman and founder
[1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:10.400]  boom i mean they got the look man i'm telling you i've seen the arrest warrants i've seen the mug
[1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:18.080]  shots i don't know what the deal is man it's it's like they're usually white guys people want to see
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:23.120]  white people are bad it's it's it there is some hispanic pedophiles too let's do that a few black
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:27.360]  ones but we ever really see a lot of black pedophiles no really you don't so so so mike's i'm
[1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:32.800]  not trying to see white people are bad or something i'm just i'm just basically profiling here
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:38.480]  mike cernovich is also a lawyer we should add that uh i've kind of prefaced things here i appreciate
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:42.720]  your courage what you did you know they demonize you in thousands of newspapers they act like
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:47.840]  you're a horrible person and now they've silenced you how dare you expose somebody just just
[1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:54.640]  dripping over sex with children and defending it how are you dirty rat how dare you not support
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:58.960]  the the the gang raping of children because he makes jokes about raping him too how how do you
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:08.800]  sleep at night as a father yeah it really is amazing to watch the media go look at these conspiracy
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:14.800]  theorists they claim there's all these hollywood pedophiles oh oh they found tweets oh let's attack
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:22.160]  them more um more interesting alex the daily beast actually today in huffington post two days before
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:28.800]  they both published articles where they said it's okay to publish fake news about people you don't
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:33.280]  like this is really the true story of the article so what is happening because i'd like to address a
[1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:38.960]  lot of things people go i found this video of you you didn't find any video of me these people who
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:45.840]  have stalked my family threatened my family edit videos they take audio clips of me and then they
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:52.720]  put them into new videos and then they they play their little games and they lie so i'm saying horrible
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:59.840]  things and people go i'm it isn't me so the daily beast confirms that i am the victim of fake news
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:05.920]  but they go oh ha ha ha it's funny sort of it's got a taste of his own medicine so my message to
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:11.520]  all of the listeners out there is that everything you see about me that's bad is fake even the
[1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:18.080]  hopping in post admits it the the daily beast admits it but it's okay to fake oh i was telling
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:22.400]  you during the break the whole media lies and says that i said parkland didn't happen and then
[1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:26.880]  congressman gates goes along with it and then they and then they edit videos of me saying
[1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:30.800]  hillary killed kids in the middle east with her policy and say that it's pizza gate they are the
[1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:35.920]  the mainstream media exactly remember the new york times last year said it's okay to lie about trump
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:44.480]  yeah so now they're saying it's okay to fabricate and forge videos about you about me about anybody
[1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:49.280]  you don't like so that's why to me people go oh cernovich why don't you address this i'm like
[1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:54.560]  you mean address the hundred fake videos the thousands of fake screen caps that the fake news
[1:13:54.560 --> 1:13:59.840]  media has said well it's okay because cernovich deserves it but by the way out this is appalling
[1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:04.960]  and i want to show people how fake the news is in real time if you go to my pen tweet which
[1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:08.960]  it might be deleted any minute because twitter is shadow banning me and they want to strike back
[1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:15.680]  here are the death threats that i've received by people who fabricate and fake news about me
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:23.280]  one of them said that he performs a self-pleasuring act me holding my daughter another one said
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:30.640]  hope your baby gets i'm not going to say it out loud and says hope limbs are cut off the huffington
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:38.480]  post said that was a crass remark a crass remark out so they're endorsing death threats against
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:44.480]  children they're endorsing a pedophilia content oh that's just crass and and more over here's how
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:52.960]  much they lie they claimed that i sent a threatening letter to a reporter who asked people to send him
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:59.760]  revenge porn of me but then i posted the letter from mark rindhasa and the letter said hey your
[1:14:59.760 --> 1:15:05.840]  reporter is trying to get revenge porn of cernovich you shouldn't do that oh by the way we're not going
[1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:11.360]  to sue you but you know what maybe just don't be jerks we we literally say in the last line of the
[1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:16.560]  letter we are not going to take any legal action at this time by the way he's my he's my lawyer too
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:20.240]  he's a really great guy one of the top lawyers in the country and then there's the letter so they lied
[1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:23.120]  and said you were threatening people we're going to go to break come back with us but the takeaway
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:28.080]  here is this the entire leftist internet is turned against you and is attacking you and the media is
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:33.760]  attacking you for exposing someone who worships raping and torturing and and sex with children
[1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:40.800]  so so you know fire somebody like rosanne bar that says uh that soros is a nazi when he is
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:46.080]  but then when you expose these pedophiles you're the bad guy that is the takeaway meaning the left
[1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:52.160]  has now adopted pedophilia and evil as their culture they love being nasty they have no bottom
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:57.920]  the bottom has fallen out these people are totally reprobate most of you know that heart disease is

[1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:21.520]  trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future they are launching a civil
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:26.640]  war against nation states right now collapsing our borders and my only message is this everybody
[1:19:26.640 --> 1:19:31.920]  better wake up and realize the fight is now everybody should be very very urgent because the
[1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:37.120]  left and the globalist are frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control
[1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:42.320]  people those of us that are pro-human don't crave power we already have the power but we have to
[1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:48.480]  realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now info wars is on
[1:19:48.480 --> 1:20:04.400]  the front line and so are you we are the resistance you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:06.400]  you
[1:20:06.400 --> 1:20:26.400]  you
[1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:38.400]  you
[1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:44.560]  all right i started this interview out like 10 minutes ago 15 minutes ago with mike sardovic
[1:20:44.560 --> 1:20:51.680]  investigative journalist talking about how if all of us go investigate major hollywood stars
[1:20:51.680 --> 1:20:59.120]  major comedians all of their main twitter accounts and their work there's a vein running through the
[1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:04.240]  producers the directors of pedophilia and it's a direct namble of statements north american
[1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:12.080]  man boy love association now last week james gunn got fired on friday after mike sardovic
[1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:20.000]  part of the show here with us found hundreds of tweets that talk about raping children talk
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:25.440]  about how pleasurable it is talk about how good it is talk about how fun it is and congressman
[1:21:25.440 --> 1:21:30.560]  senator ted cruz came out and said i think there should be a criminal investigation of james gunne
[1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:37.520]  so that's what's going on now i'm debating whether to show this or not uh so it's about
[1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:43.600]  a five minute clip but but give it to rob do and blur it out this showed on showtime this showed
[1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:50.800]  on youtube it's not age restricted but when we show it the news will be jones shows have seen video
[1:21:50.800 --> 1:21:55.360]  but i think you have a right to see it so it's coming up next segment give them the one minute
[1:21:55.360 --> 1:22:02.560]  clip part and then blur it it is dan harman one of the top comedians in the world delegitally
[1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:10.560]  to his twitter after a video surfaces was got millions of views dan harman's daryl raping a
[1:22:10.560 --> 1:22:18.080]  baby a a doll but he sneaks in when people are gone and rapes the child simulated rape
[1:22:19.360 --> 1:22:24.080]  you know oh isn't that funny but they all do this so even if they're not into it
[1:22:24.080 --> 1:22:30.400]  it's how you get promoted by the system and it's super sick so this is exactly as i don't
[1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:35.520]  with mike cernovich when he first got on is we've got to get everybody burrowing in he won't be able
[1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:40.480]  to hide what's in his twitter believe me you think this is bad if he did showtime report
[1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:45.280]  and like where have we been as a culture that no one of the left thinks this is funny and
[1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:50.160]  is threatening cernovich's baby daughter that i've met is really sweet with chopping her arms off you
[1:22:50.160 --> 1:22:55.120]  know a guy just got arrested last week from berkeley saying he was from kentucky originally
[1:22:55.120 --> 1:23:00.160]  that he was gonna murder rand paul murder his wife and kill his children like charlie manson
[1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:06.480]  and pull their guts all over the walls it's time that these people understand we're not putting up
[1:23:06.480 --> 1:23:14.000]  with this and twitter as you heard made a big joke and so did the daily beast left the post oh
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:19.360]  they're just threatened to kill your family big deal so they've gone collectively mentally ill
[1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:24.240]  they have no bottom i think you're a smart guy you're a father you're a lawyer you're a you were
[1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:28.480]  self-health lifestyle coach before bestselling books you're no reason to get into politics
[1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:32.320]  you're a smart guy what do you think's happened i mean i'm saying like they've been collectively
[1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:38.000]  possessed but they want to torpedo us uh you know for saying that george soros is a nazi and
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:42.160]  bankrupt us well guess what we're coming after all of them and no amount of shadow banding is
[1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:50.480]  going to work is it mike no i mean we are we're literally in a a war for the collective psyche
[1:23:50.480 --> 1:23:56.640]  of the people and that's why i remember i was i was a nobody in journalism because i'm the gorilla
[1:23:56.640 --> 1:24:02.080]  mindset guy i'm the guy who teaches you how to just create the the world that you want to live in
[1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:08.480]  and that's why i recognize the demonic black magic tactics of the media what they're doing
[1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:15.360]  is they're trying to manifest a world where you can um be pet be a pedophile in hollywood
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:20.720]  that's what they're doing they're persuading people oh ha ha it's just a joke ha ha ha it's just a
[1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:26.080]  joke so they're normalizing it normalizing it normalizing it that way people go oh yeah i mean
[1:24:26.080 --> 1:24:31.680]  actually it's kind of funny oh yeah you're right ha ha yeah this is funny children uh the things
[1:24:31.680 --> 1:24:37.200]  happening them oh yeah lolol that's what they're doing they're another person got punched in the head
[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:42.320]  their mega hat taken ha ha ha they dump hot coffee on you ha ha ha they shot congressman's
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:47.120]  colleagues ha ha ha they broke ram paul's ribs ha ha ha they sell you know kidnapping rape
[1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:52.080]  baron trump and take him to a pedophile exactly it's like their operating system is pedophilia
[1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:59.520]  yeah so they're trying to program people through messaging and say oh it's just a joke it's just
[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:06.320]  a joke and then the brainwashed masses will say oh yeah it's just a joke oh dan harmon is on video
[1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:11.680]  oh it's just a sketch where he breaks and enter you know i don't i've watched 10 seconds almost
[1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:16.560]  threw up yeah he breaks and enters and then there's a child in a bed and his pants are off
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:22.800]  and he humps he he rapes the child it's a doll but it's a simulation of him you know in a movie
[1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:26.640]  they use a fake kid this is in a movie they never showed a pedophile have sex with a kid
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:34.000]  and it's a baby by the way it's a baby so so so he comes in unzips his pants and then rapes a baby
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:41.360]  that that's what again that's what they're trying to just oh lighten up guys lighten up
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:47.680]  ballots what's wrong with you conspiracy theorists you info war you idiots on info wars are conspiracy
[1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:54.800]  theorists who believe that there's pedophiles in hollywood you morons your buffoons james gun
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:26:00.400]  didn't say he likes children to touch him dan harmon isn't on video simulating sexual acts
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:05.040]  with a child you're the idiots you're the morons the media is truth and justice and you don't have
[1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:09.760]  dozens and dozens of major directors caught doing it and standing ovations for roman polanski
[1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:14.080]  it'd be like saying there are no cockroaches in this hotel and you walk in your room and like
[1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:17.920]  can run by you turn the light off for five minutes turn them on there's a thousand they're
[1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:23.120]  like there's no roaches here and you're like roaches are falling off the ceiling well sarah
[1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:29.760]  silverman even tweeted out a vocal warmup which i'm not going to repeat because that'll get edited
[1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:34.160]  in more fake videos exactly no that's what happens we repeat what they've said and they edited
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:40.000]  to us believe me i know yeah but but it mentions it was a vocal warmup that she learned from dan
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:45.920]  harmon about um if you have the gumption to be a pedophile i tell you why don't you cover your
[1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:53.200]  cover your math and say it so sarah silverman tweeted out that a vocal warmup she learned
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:27:00.000]  from dan harmon was about having the gumption to be a pedophile and we could find that twitter i can
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:05.280]  send it you know i can send it to your people um really really insane and sarah silverman
[1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:10.480]  has all kinds of things where she mentions changing a diaper and noticing things about the female

[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:22.480]  when you change your baby's diaper making it sexual again they're just implanting like like
[1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:28.080]  telling five-year-olds you might not be a boy you might not be a girl this is their agenda this is so
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:34.720]  evil and then michael ian black now was saying that he's being harassed he um i don't know if we

[1:33:29.200 --> 1:33:36.160]  mike cernovich is with us cernovich dot com alex jones then four wars dot com the mark of effectiveness
[1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:43.680]  the mark of success is being demonized attacked lied about fabrications made and being censored
[1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:50.400]  and when it comes to being censored it's trump and then my shelf and people like cernovich and
[1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:55.920]  jack posobic and others and i saw all these articles last few days i've been looking get cernovich get
[1:33:55.920 --> 1:34:02.080]  posobic get get poll watch and get them get them you know new york times get alex jones because
[1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:08.560]  here's the deal i'm not some giant moral authority everybody knows i said day one trump's a womanizer
[1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:12.960]  not so much in a long time but he is he never lied about it all i care about is he tells the truth
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:17.120]  about what he's gonna do policy wise the left's always like you republicans you claim you're
[1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:21.360]  these bible thumpers but then your hypocrites no we're not hypocrites don't tell me don't have
[1:34:21.360 --> 1:34:26.080]  some preacher give me sermons about out of wedlock sex all day which i'm not saying is a great thing
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:30.480]  i'm not defending it i'm just not judging people and then you catch him with hookers every night
[1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:37.360]  there's a lot of famous i don't like hypocrites but that's consenting adults don't don't tell me
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:42.080]  all day about how the gays are going to hell and the fire and all this but then you know you catch
[1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:48.160]  half these preachers with a gay boyfriend i care about children and you get your hands near them
[1:34:48.160 --> 1:34:54.000]  you try to sexualize them which the schools are doing all this stuff that is abuse that's evil
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:58.080]  that's what we're talking about and so to all the christian conservatives who i respect a lot
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:03.040]  of them are great people and really mean well let's worry about them targeting the kids first
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:08.400]  because they use the distraction of of of you know gay marriage here or this or that
[1:35:09.920 --> 1:35:14.560]  and i'm not even waiting for that debate they use it as a let the gays get married with the lawyers
[1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:18.160]  take over then they got no i'm not saying that uh uh civil unions are one thing marriage is a
[1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:22.480]  biblical thing it's another i think it's been a man and a woman all i'm getting in here is is that
[1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:28.080]  we miss the whole shooting match while we're over here with the media debating you know some
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:34.320]  baptist church that goes and says that you know the military deserves to die because we don't kill
[1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:38.880]  the queers and all this stuff and as cernovich said i gotta be careful they'll take that quote of me
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:44.400]  and play it on co-bear saying kill the queers i'm quoting the whatever that crazy baptist church
[1:35:44.400 --> 1:35:49.120]  ish and they're so deceptive i say i'm not anti-gay and co-bear plays a little clip a little tv
[1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:53.120]  set saying i'm anti-gay but at a certain point i cover my mouth sometimes just because i know
[1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:57.200]  they're gonna do it but at a certain point they're the ones doing that that should discredit them
[1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:02.080]  so my cernovich is with us hopefully a little bit in the next hour because i'm i'm hot to cover
[1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:07.680]  this till at least five after and give him time to go over it but we've got this shocking clip
[1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:14.800]  that we're gonna play uh of dan harman simulating the rape of a baby uh it's blurred out it's it's on
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:19.600]  showtime it's on youtube right now watch they'll try to take our video down though saying it violated
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:24.880]  terms they remember youtube got caught allowing pedophilia allowing all this promotion just this
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:29.840]  year and when they had the hearings they went you allow alex jones to deny the holocaust and say no
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:35.040]  one died at parkland i never did it either one and you allow pedophilia to see how they mixed
[1:36:35.040 --> 1:36:41.040]  their own stuff in to then censor us but youtube isn't doing that another sign mike cernovich more
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:47.280]  proof of just how this is the culture of hollywood it's not humor it's not comedy they want to police
[1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:54.640]  us and say that you know again if a guy asks a girl out at some form of abuse or microaggression
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:37:00.320]  or rape but then they just want to like demonize and attack you for exposing pedophilia they want
[1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:07.120]  to be the moral police of everything when they're the most immoral right here's what i said if we had
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:14.880]  an honest media in america here is the kind of story they would write james gunn said things
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:20.960]  that nobody who's ever around children should ever say or even think the person who found it was
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:25.840]  mike cernovich oh and we don't think he's a good person either but it doesn't matter if he's a good
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:32.480]  person because what he reported was true so mike cernovich doesn't even matter all that matters is
[1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:37.760]  james gunn did this it is disgusting keep this person away from children that should be the
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:44.240]  story but we don't have an honest media instead the honest media goes james gunn just made a few
[1:37:44.240 --> 1:37:51.520]  jokes now he deleted 10 000 tweets it wasn't a few jokes oh james gunn made a few jokes oh and they
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:57.200]  were old tweets oh and here's old tweets from cernovich which are fake anyway they're so dumb
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:04.240]  they post fake tweets by impersonation accounts because when you search my name you find 100
[1:38:04.240 --> 1:38:11.680]  impersonation accounts so the fake news media is so dumb that they go oh james gunn posted tweets
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:17.680]  about having sex with children uh lighten up people oh by the way they were old oh and here's a bunch
[1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:22.320]  of old tweets from cernovich which aren't even real most of them and so cernovich is bad like
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:27.120]  wait a minute wait a minute how is this honest so yeah yeah this article the daily beast was
[1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:32.160]  incredible alex we let's go back to that daily beast article because there's a line in there
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:41.200]  control f complicating matters so james gunn posted on his twitter that he had he was linking
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:47.680]  to a video about a hundred pubescent girls doing things so you can google pubescent that doesn't
[1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:52.400]  mean a 19 or 20 year old that it has a different meaning i won't even click click the link because
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:39:00.400]  it's illegal well the person he got the video from was convicted of child pornography you can't
[1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:05.440]  make this up so that's even mentioned in the daily beast article but the guy goes well complicating
[1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:13.600]  matters is that the article that cernovich brings up was actually posted by a guy who's a lifetime
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:18.880]  registered sex offender now the guy who gave to james gunn right but they're like well i mean
[1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:24.000]  cernovich is just mudding the walk you mean i'm mudding the water by saying james gunn linked
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:30.480]  to a video up pubescent girls and that the guy he got the video from which he put on his own blog
[1:39:30.480 --> 1:39:36.400]  was convicted of child pornography and is a sex offender i mean come on people right and that's
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:42.400]  how demented these people are let's get into your shadow banning because uh there's an article
[1:39:42.400 --> 1:39:46.720]  on info wars dot com everybody should sign i should have brought this up huge new petition

[1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:35.680]  mail street gives us standing ovation for pedophile roman polanski i mean that we just
[1:40:35.680 --> 1:40:40.000]  should have a list of this stuff because every time people call us crazy we should just refer
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:46.800]  back and say well no no here's actually we should what we should do like a hundred times hollywood
[1:40:46.800 --> 1:40:53.360]  celebrated pedophiles and just have a one-stop shop for people to get but but that's why they're
[1:40:53.360 --> 1:40:59.760]  shadow banning us because they you can do anything you can send death threats to my children they
[1:40:59.760 --> 1:41:05.120]  don't care nobody cares the media thinks it's funny they can threaten you nobody cares but if
[1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:12.160]  you go after pedophilia you are attacking their their means of control hollywood controls every
[1:41:12.160 --> 1:41:18.240]  director every big time person in hollywood they keep revenge pornography of people revenge
[1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:22.800]  pornography of children they even do and then they own that person for the entire life that's
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:28.080]  how they enslave people and then they invite people from the media to their parties they invite
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:34.960]  people for you know risotto and and other kinds of stuff they you know they invite people to from
[1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:41.360]  the media from politics and then they blackmail everybody just like jeffrey upstein blackmail
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:45.840]  everybody right that's why jeffrey upstein was given a free oh yeah so for people who say we
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:50.560]  don't oh yeah you used him for a decade as a confidential informant videotaping at all
[1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:56.880]  yeah and alexander costa people go sternum it's you and jones never criticized trump are you kidding
[1:41:56.880 --> 1:42:04.320]  me alexander costa was the federal prosecutor who gave pedophilia jeffrey upstein a free pass
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:10.640]  and a costa was given a position in the trump administration secretary i believe of labor alexander
[1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:17.360]  costa so i always said that never should have never should have happened and i'm still to this day
[1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:22.960]  have no talents of that kind of stuff for people who enabled jeffrey upstein so anybody who says we
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:29.040]  don't call out trump's administration alexander costa should be driven from public life legally
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:33.280]  and walkily and never have absolutely we come back my sternum if i want to ask you i want to play
[1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:40.960]  this shocking clip we blurt it out of uh quarterly showtime youtube plays this of someone simulating

[1:43:03.440 --> 1:43:09.520]  i've been following you since i was 14 and i'm 32 now i remember back when info was in prison
[1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:14.880]  planet it was just blue text on a white screen and i had to load down the page on my dial-up
[1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:19.360]  internet and i thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the dvds and
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:23.760]  followed all your guests and i've been using your products since the first iteration of survival
[1:43:23.760 --> 1:43:29.680]  shield and since then i'm on the x2 the super male vitality the caveman the real red pill
[1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:35.440]  micho zx body it's all amazing thank you brother yeah and i wanted to say that by following you so
[1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:41.280]  much it's like you're just detoxing the mind you're detoxing the body you're detoxing the spirit
[1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:46.720]  and it's just the more you know god the more you fear god but the more you chase god and i wanted
[1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:52.560]  to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you the crew and the listeners out here 1776
[1:43:52.560 --> 1:44:01.120]  worldwide living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:06.720]  can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we
[1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:12.800]  need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:18.880]  and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a
[1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:25.600]  series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact
[1:44:25.600 --> 1:44:31.280]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our
[1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:37.760]  alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph
[1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:44.800]  was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of
[1:44:44.800 --> 1:44:50.400]  the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:59.760]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it anyone who studied history
[1:44:59.760 --> 1:45:07.600]  and knows how human systems work is horrified we have global hardcore anti-human psychopaths
[1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:13.120]  in control the big corporations they're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control
[1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:18.560]  dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines and trump has come in and is resisting
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:23.120]  that and saying we have a human future they're launching a civil war against nation states

[1:47:43.680 --> 1:47:47.120]  the fact that they would say the most bizarre things i thought they thought it was i was a
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:51.040]  christian from texas and i learned no this is standard and i just said i don't want to be
[1:47:51.040 --> 1:47:56.400]  part of this that's why i've told mic cernovich get out of la man moved to texas or somewhere else
[1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:00.480]  but we're going back to mic cernovich here in a moment i want to ask him where all this is going
[1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:06.880]  with all these big hollywood directors producers comedians obsessed with pedophilia sarah silverman
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:11.600]  all of it they're not trying to be shocking they want to degrade
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:16.480]  something you're willing to stand up for they want your soul they want you to roll over to them
[1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:23.600]  and and and the coin you pay choron to cross the river sticks to give up your soul and to go
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:30.480]  into hell to go into hollywood and and i guess be somebody that soulless crypt is debasing children
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:34.240]  as christ said some of the little ones better to tie a millstone around your neck and cast the

[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:26.720]  and support the m4 now mike we got you for eight minutes here in five more minutes let me ask you
[1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:33.360]  this i was telling the crew when we put this up on youtube and facebook even with a shadow band
[1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:38.160]  we still have you know average 100 000 views per video once it you know tops out in a week or so
[1:50:38.160 --> 1:50:46.320]  so i was saying journalist mike cernovich banned on twitter for exposing pedophiles
[1:50:46.320 --> 1:50:51.680]  or a pedophile promotion they're like well wait he's been shadow banned it's not really well when
[1:50:51.680 --> 1:50:56.960]  you're blocked from in the search term and you're blocked where only people can see you on the page
[1:50:56.960 --> 1:51:02.720]  they basically killed what twitter is and and but but it's the crew's not bad asking me that question
[1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:08.080]  they're right i mean international business time says certain far-right figures no longer
[1:51:08.080 --> 1:51:13.360]  appear in twitter search function well so so the headline is investigative journalist banned from
[1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:20.240]  twitter search for exposing hollywood pedophilia i mean that's it the point is they play the
[1:51:20.240 --> 1:51:25.120]  semantical games like zuckerberg's like we only banned him being searchable no one can see him
[1:51:25.120 --> 1:51:29.920]  but if we totally banned him that's a ban so so it's almost like you know we put you in solitary
[1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:34.480]  confinement on a mountaintop they'll never be seen again but you're not dead well you wish you were
[1:51:34.480 --> 1:51:38.480]  so so they play these games because they're discriminating and the fact that they would
[1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:43.600]  do this to you is perfect for congress perfect for the president i think as as the cause celeb that
[1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:48.720]  you expose gun he had to be fired now all these others and then now you are shadow banned now
[1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:54.400]  you've entered the realm of paul watson and alex jones so uh speak to that we're showing it on tv
[1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:59.600]  explain to people what the shadow ban means and where you think this is going right and for
[1:51:59.600 --> 1:52:07.680]  those watching who are new to me john uh conyers a member of congress resigned from congress after
[1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:13.760]  me mike sternovich found documents showing that he stole taxpayer money after he sexually harassed
[1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:20.560]  a woman so sternovich is real news we reported on big stories all the time so what they're doing is
[1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:26.560]  they are protecting sexual predators so here's how shadow banning works when imagine you know
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:33.440]  you're out in the world and people go oh there's this guy sternovich he um he reports big stories
[1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:38.800]  like the susan rise and masking story which was true he reports big stories like john conyers
[1:52:38.800 --> 1:52:44.160]  he reports big stories like james gunn people go oh sternovich who's that and then they search for me
[1:52:44.160 --> 1:52:50.640]  and they find 15 fake accounts and then these fake accounts are all going i want to do and then
[1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:56.720]  it's horrible things that people go oh wow that videos of gorillas eating poop so so this is how
[1:52:56.720 --> 1:53:01.680]  they counter you just like just like when you search all the stuff we broke you just get edits
[1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:07.760]  and and and memes and fake stuff yeah yeah exactly so what they're doing is but but if i go look at
[1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:13.360]  they if they ban me then they admit that they support john conyers and they admit that they
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:18.160]  support child molesters so they don't want to ban me because then it's too obvious and everybody's
[1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:25.680]  like wait so you banned the guy who exposed james gunn and john conyers wait so why would you ban
[1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:31.600]  that guy right while allowing why isn't james gunn banned for posting why isn't michaelian black
[1:53:31.600 --> 1:53:36.240]  band why isn't pat and oswald blam banned for talking about nambla and sarah silverman and
[1:53:36.240 --> 1:53:43.840]  and trevor noah has his own petto jokes and trevor noah made a joke about um uh chris brown
[1:53:43.840 --> 1:53:47.680]  beating up women he made jokes about domestic violence i retweeted those things let me take
[1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:54.320]  one look at trevor noah he's got the look so why do you ban me for reporting on what they're
[1:53:54.320 --> 1:53:57.920]  actually because you're a real reporter with courage and that's why they want you shut down
[1:53:57.920 --> 1:54:01.920]  it's why they want info or shut down it's why they want rudge report shut down so the question is
[1:54:01.920 --> 1:54:06.160]  it's all admitted now they put in postures up there to defame you so people can't find what
[1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:11.440]  you're really doing uh just like real alex jones how do people then go into twitter people say
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:16.000]  oh just leave that no they want us off this battlefield we have to show their censoring
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:22.160]  to get congress and trump to do something yeah exactly and that's why they're being subtle
[1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:29.280]  and what they're going to do is they're going what they're going to do is they're going to before
[1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:33.280]  the midterms they're going to turn off the internet out so that's why they have they're
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:38.560]  just gonna so they're shadow banning us now and then i totally agree they're ratcheting up to
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:44.000]  basically a virtual ban yeah so they're normal i and then right before the election they'll just
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  delete a hundred accounts all at once and so we have to act now we have to call attention to it now
[1:54:50.800 --> 1:54:55.200]  we i don't know maybe we need a march maybe we need to just get all everybody
[1:54:55.200 --> 1:55:00.080]  maybe we need to organize a march alex at this point because they obviously are planning a big
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:03.920]  event before november so that they can that's right they're going to do something right before the
[1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:08.400]  election and they want us they're going to shut us off saying oh we can't let them say it didn't
[1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:15.760]  happen even though we didn't say that that they're setting the precedent to ban us all so that any
[1:55:15.760 --> 1:55:21.120]  real media isn't there when they pull something big yeah so maybe you know we just need to organize
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:26.800]  a big event get a few thousand is there an austin office at twitter does twitter have an office at
[1:55:26.800 --> 1:55:32.240]  austin yeah they've got offices so does google the point is is they think we're so stupid and here's
[1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:36.640]  the good news they want to play this moral superiority game we're destroying them they're
[1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:41.600]  failing on every front so i don't hillary knows there's gonna be a giant red wave what do you
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:46.400]  expect them to do because i don't even think the false five they're gonna pull is gonna work well
[1:55:46.400 --> 1:55:51.920]  the reason they're shadow banning us is so that they can propagandize people and you know maybe
[1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:56.800]  i need to fly out to austin and maybe we just need to get a bunch of people to show up and let them
[1:55:56.800 --> 1:56:02.720]  know that uh banning us and shadow banning us and defending the you know again i don't want to accuse
[1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:07.760]  anyone at twitter and google it this yet i want to hear their their side of the story but why would
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:14.000]  you shadow ban the person who just reported on truthful tweets about james gunne but not shadow
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:20.480]  ban james gunne if you're going to choose sides why would you choose his side so there's your
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:26.880]  headline why did twitter just choose the side of prominent pedophile promoters over journalists
[1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:31.920]  they need to answer that question that that's up for them to answer because i know that right
[1:56:31.920 --> 1:56:36.960]  after i broke the james gunne story and by the way i'm so tired of people saying i got him fired
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:42.560]  i didn't get anybody fired he got himself fired it's just like they changed the subject on wikileaks
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:48.240]  hillary's calling her black people animals uh hillary is saying she hates her barista supporters
[1:56:48.240 --> 1:56:53.360]  hillary's saying she wants to create race war and rig things and then it becomes who got the info
[1:56:53.360 --> 1:57:00.240]  what about the wikileaks no no james gunne got himself fired yeah this is all his stuff i did
[1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:05.040]  journalism all i did and i did real journalism i'm like the fake stuff that you see out there
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:12.160]  you reported on what he said right so why am i the villain well i mean we know why we know
[1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:18.240]  why i'm the villain i'm the villain because these are protected people pedophiles are the new
[1:57:18.240 --> 1:57:24.400]  protected class there will be a further move to make it so that's illegal to discriminate against
[1:57:24.400 --> 1:57:31.840]  pedophiles that's the last next move well that's it we'll just do five more minutes on this because
[1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:36.240]  this is the big fight they're making all their moves and it actually shocks me that mainstream
[1:57:36.240 --> 1:57:41.360]  media across the board would defend pedophilia and say you're bad for exposing literal pedophile
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:46.480]  warspers and we'll show the shocking clip from showtime with one of these top guys simulating

[2:00:07.040 --> 2:00:16.240]  to the violence of the sun from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:00:24.480 --> 2:00:28.320]  all right final thing with mike sternovich then we've got the editor west minister coming on
[2:00:28.320 --> 2:00:33.440]  about briggs it and the acid attacks on three-year-olds everything else is happening as europe just
[2:00:33.440 --> 2:00:40.080]  sinks into total insanity but but mike again they play this moral game saying that men and
[2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:44.320]  women together is evil and the more mother and father is bad and hurts feelings and we all
[2:00:44.320 --> 2:00:47.840]  need generalist bathrooms because the left's all a bunch of perverts and wants i mean they just want
[2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:53.920]  to play god we just okay we're good we'll do what you say but now their demonization of you and
[2:00:53.920 --> 2:00:59.680]  others for exposing pedophile worship in hollywood seems like the biggest jumping of the shark
[2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:03.440]  i've ever seen but we're talking during the break trump needs to take action i know he's
[2:01:03.440 --> 2:01:07.520]  overwhelmed worried about korea and military things and that he presents distracted on
[2:01:07.520 --> 2:01:11.120]  international issues he's trying to get the economy going but i give him an a plus but
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:15.840]  he needs to get on the internet situation and the and how they're trying to silence him
[2:01:15.840 --> 2:01:21.360]  how he shadow banned what's happening to you me i know some of this gets to the president
[2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:28.720]  what would you say to trump yeah i would tell trump well here's the issue that trump doesn't
[2:01:28.720 --> 2:01:35.920]  really understand how vital his supporters were on the ground and that's because he's been lied to
[2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:42.880]  by mark short johnny days to finals another guy brian hook is another guy they were all lying to him
[2:01:42.880 --> 2:01:49.440]  about um the things that were happening on the level but i would tell trump if you believe the
[2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:54.720]  news is fake then why would you want to give the fake news media a monopoly over the minds of the
[2:01:54.720 --> 2:02:01.520]  american people right that you want the american people to have access to true information to find
[2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:06.080]  out what is really going on in the world and again that's the problem he's he's older he
[2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:09.760]  still reads the newark times he still thinks fox news is the biggest thing in town he didn't know
[2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:14.880]  that before the censorship there were a hundred videos a day with more views than fox news 10
[2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:20.160]  times i mean it was every video we did had a million two million views many of them 30 40
[2:02:20.160 --> 2:02:25.760]  million views they've dialed that way down he just he just he let them take his biggest weapon yeah
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:30.960]  and we should also we want trump to know because trump understands the problem with these perverts
[2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:36.640]  we need to let trump know that the fake news media is defending james gun and the only reason
[2:02:36.640 --> 2:02:43.040]  anybody knows about what james gun did and said is because social media reported on it remember
[2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:49.280]  the real media right the real news they ignored this these tweets around the open for 10 years
[2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:53.520]  not one journalist thought well hey you know maybe i ought to maybe ought to do a little
[2:02:53.520 --> 2:02:57.680]  search on this guy because you and i they said it's so critical i know the campaign knows that
[2:02:57.680 --> 2:03:01.840]  that all the real news comes from the grassroots that's how we're taking control of the narrative
[2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:07.360]  that's what scares them exactly that that's where everything real is is is is that's the incubation
[2:03:07.360 --> 2:03:15.440]  chamber exactly and if it weren't for us and info war and by the way we're nothing we're spokes people
[2:03:15.440 --> 2:03:20.080]  for the great people watching and listening exactly they're the they're the ones that email
[2:03:20.080 --> 2:03:24.000]  disney they're the ones who they're the ones that share the articles even though they're
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:27.520]  going to get censored to attack themselves you know it's the audience that's critical
[2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:30.880]  and the fact that they're doing the research they're giving us info it's symbiotic you're
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:36.320]  absolutely right yeah without them we would just be guys you know talking to a camera but they got
[2:03:36.320 --> 2:03:41.600]  on the email they got on the phone and they were saying hey hey i have kids i take my kids to disney
[2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:47.120]  movies why in the world would you work with someone like james gun who said this stuff why would you

[2:06:42.960 --> 2:06:46.720]  now they're trying to moralize their whole pedophile situation has blown up in their face
[2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:51.120]  they've just shadow banned you after you expose the director gun promoting pedophilia
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:55.840]  now the rest of the media is jumping on it and every hour new stuff is breaking
[2:06:55.840 --> 2:07:02.240]  with dan harman deleting his twitter him doing simulated baby rape um sarah silverman praising
[2:07:02.240 --> 2:07:07.680]  pedophilia if you've got what it takes to be a pedophile uh i mean these people are just
[2:07:07.680 --> 2:07:13.600]  truly evil people that's not funny that's just evil what do you think the endgame is how do we
[2:07:13.600 --> 2:07:20.240]  end up in some alternate hp lovecraft novel where america is run by a bunch of pedophiles
[2:07:20.800 --> 2:07:26.800]  who want to run every blue city is piles of feces needles everywhere i mean what what alternate
[2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:33.040]  dimension have we entered and how do we get out of it well we're entering the post modern world
[2:07:33.040 --> 2:07:39.760]  where you destroy beauty i mean you and i have talked about this so many times where the endgame
[2:07:39.760 --> 2:07:45.520]  for the world that they want to live in 26 pounds of fecal matter in san francisco that was there's
[2:07:45.520 --> 2:07:52.640]  there's everywhere you look in san francisco piles of it piles of it that is the endgame of
[2:07:52.640 --> 2:07:58.160]  post modernism destroy beauty destroy god that's why i tell people even if you don't believe in god
[2:07:58.160 --> 2:08:03.280]  you should go to church and pray and meditate and do things because the endgame is destroy god
[2:08:03.280 --> 2:08:09.120]  destroy the family unit and then that's how the demons are able to pray on children because
[2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:16.080]  it's very easy this is why they attack the family they know that if they want to traffic children
[2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:22.000]  and and and be pedos you have to get away from the nuclear family you have to destroy the family
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:28.480]  that way you have all the people for them to pray on so that's the endgame it is truly truly an action
[2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:34.960]  by pedophiles oh by the way before i go real quick because there's so much has happened out uh remember
[2:08:34.960 --> 2:08:40.960]  when i went to the columbia i gave a columbia university talk and they held an anti-vacant
[2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:46.160]  was signed saying we love pedophiles and people said oh that's a joke right well there was a
[2:08:46.160 --> 2:08:53.440]  fellow named joel davis who the hobby did post um published joel davis organized that protest march
[2:08:53.440 --> 2:08:59.840]  against me he is actually facing federal criminal charges for soliciting sex he said he was into
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:06.640]  anyone zero plus anyone from zero to eight years away i saw that report where uh there are a bunch
[2:09:06.640 --> 2:09:10.720]  of these university people one of them ran a children's rights group was in the philadelphia
[2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:15.280]  news uh is that the same guy that said he wanted to have he already had sex with a nine-year-old
[2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:21.200]  and a 13-year-old but he wanted a two-year-old that that was joel davis yeah joel yeah pull this
[2:09:21.200 --> 2:09:27.440]  guy up because he also uh again was running a human rights deal working with the clintons
[2:09:27.440 --> 2:09:32.320]  so yeah you gosh and now i'm not going to pull it up because we're doing an investigation but
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:36.480]  they're now all of the news going oh here's your school resource officer yeah there he is
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:41.760]  and they're going to do sexual education showing hardcore porn to your children
[2:09:41.760 --> 2:09:47.680]  and and then they go on and say mike sternovich uh they go on and say i love pizza i love pizza
[2:09:47.680 --> 2:09:52.720]  all over the walls behind him i mean they're really sending some messages well it was amazing
[2:09:52.720 --> 2:09:58.560]  too about joel davis is he deleted his instagram which by the way was a breach of his bail agreement
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:04.000]  so i've been in touch with prosecutors about that because when you're a pedo they say you cannot
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:09.200]  be on the internet so he deleted his instagram there was a picture of him at the clinton campaign
[2:10:09.200 --> 2:10:14.400]  and the the media goes oh he had no they fact check and they go he has no connection to clinton
[2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:19.680]  campaign it's like no he had a picture of himself at the clinton campaign on his instagram so that's
[2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:24.960]  how bad the lies are is even when you have their social media posts and they delete them oh no never
[2:10:24.960 --> 2:10:29.680]  happened and then of course if you see that joel davis picture again they just had he's wearing a
[2:10:29.680 --> 2:10:36.400]  disney button right what's going on there was he infiltrating you know that's the whole thing
[2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:40.560]  yeah so you can see this picture of joel davis uh for those you're listening he's wearing a
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:46.640]  hillary clinton button stronger together the media says oh no he he was never a hillary clinton
[2:10:46.640 --> 2:10:51.360]  no leah's oh and you know what else he wrote an article for the huffington post if you google
[2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:58.080]  joel davis huffington post he wrote in so this is actually we can say this truthfully and huffington
[2:10:58.080 --> 2:11:05.840]  post can come after me if they want legally published huffington post author faces child rate
[2:11:05.840 --> 2:11:10.880]  charges sue me huffington post because he's on your website we have a link we have a screen cap
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:16.800]  so the huffington post gave this pedophile a platform that is a fact that that's what we're
[2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:21.200]  up against the media they're all in on it and that's why they're attacking me at the huffington post
[2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:27.520]  because i reported on the fact that they published an article by pedophile so they go well oh
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:33.360]  oh we'll try to kill the message and by the way we've seen salon we've seen hbo we've seen vice
[2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:38.560]  between the new york times say pedophilia is actually not bad standard namblah statement
[2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:44.240]  and and so let me ask you this question what percentage of these people i guess they're just
[2:11:44.240 --> 2:11:50.000]  all the deviance evil having power over people statistic show liberals or what six times more
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:57.200]  likely to steal nine times more likely to virtue signal and not give to charity is this just the
[2:11:57.200 --> 2:12:01.840]  constituency of evil now because liberals weren't like this 20 years ago at least what i thought
[2:12:01.840 --> 2:12:07.280]  i mean what do you think is going on here yeah this is the end result of post marxism
[2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:14.160]  and post structuralism post modernism liberalism so and this is the problem and this is why people
[2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:20.240]  who are on the center left so i want to be very clear i would say only 10 of democrats support
[2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:25.760]  pedophilia 90 of democrats they only watch see it in so they don't know this is happening
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:30.880]  right because they live in a media bubble so if you want their movement is commanded by pedophiles
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:36.880]  they don't under but the so this is why i feel bad for democrats they don't know this
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:43.440]  because they watch they read the hopping in post they were they watch cnn so they don't
[2:12:43.440 --> 2:12:48.480]  know that they're being ordered around and led by pedophilia 90 percent of democrats
[2:12:48.480 --> 2:12:52.160]  outside truly believe it i make a lot of people know i totally agree with you they're anti-war
[2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:56.320]  they're decent people they mean while they believe lies so but what percentage of the top 10 percent
[2:12:56.320 --> 2:13:02.320]  are pedophiles oh i would say um a democrat leadership at least 10 percent of them are
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:08.400]  pedophiles at least and the others are using it to compromise people exactly and black
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:14.800]  mailing people and in covering things up and let's not forget mewler for a decade new epstein
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:21.520]  was kidnapping children flying into sex stuff and use it to compromise i mean mewler is a manifest
[2:13:21.520 --> 2:13:28.960]  monster well and not a muller i was gonna be muller i call him mewler because he's like a dumb
[2:13:28.960 --> 2:13:35.120]  mule but there was um more than that there was a person in san francisco caught with the whole
[2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:42.880]  treasure trove of child pornography and that was covered up also by mewler so that yeah they have
[2:13:42.880 --> 2:13:48.480]  a track record and we've had 16 major democrat mayors including seattle all resigned last year
[2:13:48.480 --> 2:13:54.880]  from being caught me pedophiles oh joel um so there's another guy jacob schwarz who was a cnn
[2:13:54.880 --> 2:13:59.440]  guest you can't i mean this is the whole thing out it's so weird they there's a guy that's why
[2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:03.280]  they go sooner but you're always so excited i'm like well because there's so much i'm like kassandra
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:07.440]  i'm like i know all this stuff no it's very frustrating when we know and it's like it's a
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:12.320]  normal person you're like another pedophile it's like really pedophiles everywhere you don't believe
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:18.720]  it even though you know it it's like who the hell are these people build the blasio's top aid google
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:24.640]  this right now jacob schwarz gac ob s and they've been covering up all his pedophile stuff yeah so

[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:38.720]  and he was a guest on cnn right charged with possessing thousands thousands of images and

[2:14:50.720 --> 2:14:54.880]  and they haven't made him take a plea deal they haven't put him to trial they just keep letting
[2:14:54.880 --> 2:14:59.280]  him run free hoping nobody'll actually know you know what unifies all this they all are weak

[2:20:57.280 --> 2:21:01.760]  notice is islamic they're shutting it down three men arrested over asked attack on three-year-old

[2:21:25.920 --> 2:21:31.920]  muslims are allowed to have sex with kids so you got that weird thing going on that just keeps popping
[2:21:31.920 --> 2:21:37.760]  up so patrick christy thank you for joining us there's so much to cover uh they're at west
[2:21:37.760 --> 2:21:42.720]  monster that we linked to all the time west monster dot com what do you think the main
[2:21:42.720 --> 2:21:47.600]  issue is right now brexit or the islamic invasion and we know phase two is happening
[2:21:47.600 --> 2:21:52.560]  what's front and center for you i mean front and center for me on the day today is the brexit
[2:21:52.560 --> 2:21:56.640]  stuff but it's it's a wider context of what's going on in europe generally it's the breakdown of
[2:21:56.640 --> 2:22:01.120]  europe and the rebellion of people against this kind of centralization of unaccountable power
[2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:07.120]  and the establishment elite but then on top of that we do have uh this this radical islamist
[2:22:07.120 --> 2:22:12.560]  terror that's sweeping the continent in britain for example people don't know this a lot at the time
[2:22:12.560 --> 2:22:18.240]  but britain's led in a higher percentage of returning isis fighters islamic state fighters
[2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:23.680]  so people that were british citizens that have traveled abroad to Syria iraq to fight for isis
[2:22:23.680 --> 2:22:28.320]  which we all know is a death cult you know a horrible death cult they throw people off buildings
[2:22:28.320 --> 2:22:33.920]  they they're paedophiles they're murderers they're depraved people 425 of those have come back into
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:38.800]  britain and none of them to our knowledge so far have been prosecuted that is absolutely ridiculous
[2:22:38.800 --> 2:22:44.160]  but yet we are prosecuting people who go to fight against isis fighters abroad now if you
[2:22:44.160 --> 2:22:50.080]  mirror this across europe the fact is unfortunately now we have this this this this stockpile almost of
[2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:55.360]  of radicals that are just living among the normal european society and that's having an impact that's
[2:22:55.360 --> 2:22:59.440]  why we're seeing these terror attacks that's why we're seeing a general level of fear across the
[2:22:59.440 --> 2:23:05.600]  continent but in britain specifically you may not know this again there are 23 000 people currently
[2:23:05.600 --> 2:23:10.720]  on a terror watch it you know the uk is the size of a small american state pretty much and that's
[2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:15.920]  pretty horrifying for me anyway that's right and i see where they get even better welfare better
[2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:21.520]  sectionate housing our council of states wherever you call them over there uh again patrick christy's
[2:23:21.520 --> 2:23:26.880]  with an astro i just was west monster dot com what do you think the in game is i mean we know
[2:23:26.880 --> 2:23:31.200]  that peter southerland who died this year of the un wanted to merge it with the middle east north
[2:23:31.200 --> 2:23:36.640]  africa but i mean it's giant groups of people i was reading like 90 percent of people in five
[2:23:36.640 --> 2:23:42.000]  years in europe particularly on the continent don't even get a job and then if you do try to get a
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:49.360]  job that's who they deport so they want a bunch of people sitting around on welfare uh why what
[2:23:49.360 --> 2:23:54.160]  what is the e u superstate looking for just have a client group that is totally dependent who'll
[2:23:54.160 --> 2:23:59.200]  burn down cities did they give them the order well there's a couple of uh uh uh factors at play here
[2:23:59.200 --> 2:24:03.360]  i believe alex anyway i think that the european union wants to break down the idea of the nation
[2:24:03.360 --> 2:24:08.320]  state we know that because they want united states of europe they want an e u wide army so they don't
[2:24:08.320 --> 2:24:12.640]  want nations to have their own army they don't want nations to have their own borders of course now on
[2:24:12.640 --> 2:24:18.000]  the continent of europe the mainland continent of europe uh that there is an open border system
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:23.280]  basically and so i think one of the elements of having this aiding and abetting this this migrant
[2:24:23.280 --> 2:24:28.080]  crisis is being called the european union by the way sells inflatable dinghies i don't know if that's
[2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:33.040]  one of those on your screen now they sell inflatable dinghies to libya where of course a lot of the
[2:24:33.040 --> 2:24:38.000]  migrants are coming from now i don't want to get too uh too radical about it but it does
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:42.560]  certainly seem that it would fit in with their idea of breaking down this idea of national
[2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:47.920]  identity national sovereignty in the nation state if you do have a big influx of people from
[2:24:47.920 --> 2:24:53.360]  a complete and utter variety of cultures very different cultures etc and that would go towards
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:57.440]  it would seem you know contributing towards creating a europe wide country as opposed to
[2:24:57.440 --> 2:25:02.800]  anyone with a distinct national identity and so i think that's definitely got a factor to
[2:25:02.800 --> 2:25:06.560]  play in it as well the other element of it is i just think they've bitten off more than they can
[2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:11.520]  chew they they don't have the capabilities they don't have the resources to actively defend their
[2:25:11.520 --> 2:25:16.080]  own borders and so they've given up well i think that's it you see the un saying we'll build the
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:21.920]  refugee centers inside europe not in africa not in uh the middle east they're they're creating the
[2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:28.000]  crisis that will call for the uu army to fix the problem they created this is it there's a very
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:33.280]  interesting factor so i went as you mentioned before i went to turkey i went to to uh refugee
[2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:37.280]  camps on the syrian border on the iraqi border now i spoke to refugees there i spoke to them in
[2:25:37.280 --> 2:25:41.840]  person right from children up the way through to to the adults that were with them they told me
[2:25:41.840 --> 2:25:46.400]  that they would rather stay in those camps on the border of their home country because actually
[2:25:46.400 --> 2:25:50.720]  as far as they were concerned they would quite like to return one day when the fighting stopped
[2:25:50.720 --> 2:25:56.320]  and or if the fighting ever stops of course so this idea that we have to permanently just place them
[2:25:56.320 --> 2:26:01.520]  and place them all the way in the center of europe the heartland of europe for no reason really
[2:26:01.520 --> 2:26:05.200]  i's alien to me and it doesn't seem that there's something that these people a lot of them
[2:26:05.200 --> 2:26:09.600]  particularly want themselves so again of course if i pose the question why do it really that's
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:15.440]  right they're forcing the migration corridors from latin america into the u.s out of north africa
[2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:23.520]  and uh the middle east and central asia into europe as an admitted plan uh as as uh macron has said
[2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:28.800]  as southerland has said as the un have said to quote repopulate europe but when they get there
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:32.800]  they're not trying to make them absorb the culture they're trying to make them keep their own culture
[2:26:32.800 --> 2:26:38.320]  as really a political detonator a checkmate uh for full control this is a very very diabolical
[2:26:38.320 --> 2:26:44.320]  plan and then let's let's not forget it was the e u and obama seven years ago that admittedly with
[2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:50.480]  google launched the arab spring to destabilize many of these countries to take down libya
[2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:56.800]  to then begin the collapse of north africa and the middle east to create the war torn refugees
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:27:04.000]  to start the invasion so it's very premeditated we've certainly had a hand in in the direct causes
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:08.720]  of this migrant crisis from start to finish going back well decades now you know and so we have
[2:27:08.720 --> 2:27:13.200]  our hands to play in that and you touched on an important issue there i think alex and that is
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:17.840]  the issue of integration now it's very very unfortunate but there has been no efforts
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:22.400]  particularly in britain certainly not as much of a concerted effort as i think there should have been
[2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:26.720]  to force through some elements of integration and what that creates of course is societies
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:32.720]  within societies and in britain we allow people to have sharia courts so the rules that they would
[2:27:32.720 --> 2:27:37.920]  choose to live by saying Saudi Arabia etc we allow them to have those courts over here now that creates
[2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:43.440]  a complete separation in society and over time it builds up with hundreds of thousands of people
[2:27:43.440 --> 2:27:48.640]  living in pockets societies within societies as i've said oh they were just nine two years ago
[2:27:48.640 --> 2:27:54.240]  no go zones now it's admitted everywhere well i mean personally look i went to a place in
[2:27:54.240 --> 2:27:58.720]  birmingham a year or so ago i was investigating a terrorist the london british terrorist you may
[2:27:58.720 --> 2:28:02.960]  remember a guy who drove a van down a road outside parliament killed loads of people
[2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:07.920]  stabbed a police officer to death tried to storm the parliament building this guy uh i colored
[2:28:07.920 --> 2:28:11.840]  my suit he was called i went to investigate and i got into his house in birmingham actually i got
[2:28:11.840 --> 2:28:16.000]  into his house and he had flatmates who actually to be fair on them just didn't genuinely didn't
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:20.240]  know anything about it it was like a single room in a pretty squalid flat this guy lived in but i
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:24.960]  spoke to them and i went down and walked down a place in birmingham a road called alam rock road
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:29.920]  and people say it's not a no go zone i'm telling you it is a no go zone it's a no go zone and we
[2:28:29.920 --> 2:28:34.240]  know it is because when i walked down i got racially abused and the white girl that i was with
[2:28:34.240 --> 2:28:39.200]  got racially abused as well they said welcome to alam rock well let's talk about where this is going

[2:35:00.880 --> 2:35:06.560]  this weapon to take us over and then they think they'll control that i think they want to be able
[2:35:06.560 --> 2:35:11.760]  to control it i think this is out of control so as a president so we have the one of the top
[2:35:11.760 --> 2:35:16.480]  investigative journalists at westmonster.com patrick christies on with this big investigative
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:21.280]  journalists be sure and check out his bio and the work he's doing at patrick christies on twitter
[2:35:21.280 --> 2:35:27.120]  before he gets shadow banned but here's a new article on info wars.com and news wars.com by
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:35.520]  ben warren now we know president trump wasn't just responding to the ayatollah of rock and roll over
[2:35:35.520 --> 2:35:43.120]  there the hereditary islamic dictator of the islamic state of iran saying that uh
[2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:50.320]  he you know better watch out mother all battles or whatever we now know the former head of the
[2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:56.800]  republican guard of hezbollah of the islamic revolutionary guard threatened trump in a tweet
[2:35:56.800 --> 2:36:01.760]  and that's what trump was responding to no one's picked us up we've confirmed it it's on news wars.com
[2:36:01.760 --> 2:36:09.200]  iranian politician threatens trump says 50 000 us troops in firing range oh no don't kill our troops
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:15.760]  i mean i don't want our troops to die but what you think like the us is afraid of troops getting
[2:36:15.760 --> 2:36:21.760]  killed i mean put us in the briar patch i don't want a war with iran let's be clear but
[2:36:22.640 --> 2:36:27.680]  this is getting ridiculous i mean we have enough nukes to blow the planet up like 10 times the us
[2:36:27.680 --> 2:36:32.560]  admitted 15 years ago that we have antimatter weapons that can blow up the whole solar system jackass
[2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:41.120]  you sit up with your little your little rpgs and you know have sex with your sister morons excuse me
[2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:46.640]  the iranian politic uh politician reportedly told president trump that 50 000 american troops are
[2:36:46.640 --> 2:36:52.400]  within iran's firing range hours after trump told iran's president to never threaten the united
[2:36:52.400 --> 2:36:59.520]  states again the former islamic revolutionary guard corps commander in chief mozion rezani
[2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:04.400]  appears to have tweeted at trump says he's been more cautious because 30 000 us troops are under
[2:37:04.400 --> 2:37:10.960]  iran's sword oh my gosh we're so scared when more than 50 000 of your forces are under iran's sword
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:16.800]  it's you need to be cautious but instead you make demented threats said the early
[2:37:16.800 --> 2:37:20.880]  monday tweet you know i don't want a real war but that would shut all the leftists and the
[2:37:20.880 --> 2:37:25.200]  communists up real quick it started here's the deal i need to start the war radical islam's
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:28.880]  ally with the globalists there's no doubt disagree with me if you think i'm wrong patrick
[2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:32.720]  christy's of westmonster.com investigative journalist one of the youngest editors in the
[2:37:32.720 --> 2:37:36.880]  uk ever run major newspapers but we're already in this war it's like patrick henry said the
[2:37:36.880 --> 2:37:41.600]  revolutionary war he goes i'm not looking for a war but it's already started you can crouch down
[2:37:41.600 --> 2:37:45.600]  and lick the hand that feeds you but as for me liberty or death i mean we're already in this
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:50.000]  we've already got the european government saying we're invading you with islam we're training your
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:56.880]  15 year old 13 year old daughters have sex with islamist it's on children's tv that girls should
[2:37:56.880 --> 2:38:03.040]  have sex with muslims i mean this is a clear takeover go ahead well i mean i think there are
[2:38:03.040 --> 2:38:07.760]  certain countries out there ram being one of them of course whereby you know they are very very clear
[2:38:07.760 --> 2:38:13.040]  about the kind of society that they would like and they would like to have a global islamist
[2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:17.520]  society and that is what they are open about but you know i think crucially the point here regarding
[2:38:17.520 --> 2:38:21.280]  the trump thing is you know they've burnt the american flag in their parliament over there
[2:38:21.280 --> 2:38:25.200]  they've been making direct threats against the truth what do people want their president to do
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:29.120]  they want him to sit back and say nothing about it a lot was made in the british press over here
[2:38:29.120 --> 2:38:33.680]  about trump's reaction or he responded all in capitals on twitter you know and that's what
[2:38:33.680 --> 2:38:37.520]  he's very alien that we have a politician getting irate about something like that i think that's
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:41.520]  perfectly perfectly natural and the fact is we are having a big debate in britain at the minute
[2:38:41.520 --> 2:38:47.200]  today i wrote an article about these two british citizens that went over to find varieties abroad
[2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:50.800]  now they've been captured over there and there's a big who are because we're saying we want to
[2:38:50.800 --> 2:38:55.040]  send them over to america to face the death penalty because you guys have the death penalty okay and
[2:38:55.040 --> 2:38:58.720]  people are saying no it's against their human rights well i'm sorry i personally believe these
[2:38:58.720 --> 2:39:03.840]  people forfeit their human rights when they go abroad to all join people with people that stay at
[2:39:03.840 --> 2:39:09.200]  home in england and across europe to stay at home and join these islamic state they are a death cult
[2:39:09.200 --> 2:39:13.040]  that has terrible views towards women they're probably the least tolerant out there they are
[2:39:13.040 --> 2:39:17.680]  literally they keep sex slaves you know they blow people up on tubes innocent men women and children
[2:39:17.680 --> 2:39:22.000]  you know they've forfeited their right to human rights in my opinion when they joined that death
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:28.640]  cult no i'm right so why is the left so in love i'm asking this question uh i think because a
[2:39:28.640 --> 2:39:32.640]  weak and but they're weak and pathetic calyx you know i don't understand i can't understand what it is
[2:39:32.640 --> 2:39:36.080]  and the fact is as well i think they're not on the front line a lot of these people a lot of them
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:40.800]  live very sheltered lives a lot of them live very gilded lives especially people in the EU elite
[2:39:40.800 --> 2:39:44.960]  they never live in any of the areas that are targeted by these things they never live in any
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:49.440]  of the areas that face the brunt of this kind of terrorist invasion that we're seeing or they never
[2:39:49.440 --> 2:39:52.720]  face the brunt of it because they never have to deal with it and so they don't think it's real
[2:39:52.720 --> 2:39:56.480]  or they just tell the rest of the people that it's not real they're so weak i think they close
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:40:02.240]  their eyes and ears to ignore it or the rest of the people have to actually deal with it that's
[2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:08.640]  right in fact paul watson's done some demographic studies showing google maps that the most leftist
[2:40:08.640 --> 2:40:14.960]  areas of london are 99 white and then they're and i think it's different colors this is different
[2:40:14.960 --> 2:40:19.680]  cultures third world you know really collapsed countries and and and then like they're the
[2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:26.720]  ones that do not want to be around any of this it's crazy it's crazy for me it's just look it's
[2:40:26.720 --> 2:40:30.880]  got absolutely nothing to do with it you know i've got friends of all different races demographics
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:34.480]  whatever colors creeds whatever you want to say it's not nothing to do with that the fact is
[2:40:34.480 --> 2:40:39.120]  there is unfortunately with elements of uh of islam at the minute they're extremely radical
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:42.800]  okay and they may know burns about that and they are the most right thing is these countries are
[2:40:42.800 --> 2:40:47.280]  collapsing they're under radical islam and then they're bringing all these people in what what is
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:51.520]  europe i agree with you though this they're not going to be able to control this like they dreamed
[2:40:51.520 --> 2:40:56.080]  of bringing in and making everybody integrate and creating a new guilt culture it's not gonna work
[2:40:57.440 --> 2:41:01.040]  but they're not trying and they're not trying in this sense by when you don't bother to
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:04.640]  patrol the borders you have no idea who is coming in and who is coming out and some of the paris
[2:41:04.640 --> 2:41:09.520]  attackers the terrible bataclan attack in paris you'll remember that some of those people came in
[2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:14.240]  hiding among genuine refugees and the fact is as long as the european union and the other powers
[2:41:14.240 --> 2:41:19.440]  that be aren't bothering to check who these people are who all of these people are coming in
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:24.400]  they are they're liable for allowing it to come in but but clearly i would say i would say they
[2:41:24.400 --> 2:41:28.160]  should face charges for for some of the things that have gone on because ultimately it is their fault
[2:41:28.160 --> 2:41:34.080]  you're right let me ask patrick christies when we come back from westmonster.com where he thinks
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:42.240]  it all ends and then ladies and gentlemen coming up uh hosting uh the next hour of the broadcast

[2:48:00.400 --> 2:48:04.720]  gone through on that point for being out there traveling in north africa the middle east covering
[2:48:04.720 --> 2:48:10.960]  him and then what about brexit where tricia mays now saying we may not even have a debate about it
[2:48:10.960 --> 2:48:16.720]  we may just kill it some people are saying it'll cause civil insurrection uh what i mean what would
[2:48:16.720 --> 2:48:22.480]  you say the state of the euro is yeah well well the state of the euro is uh is poor but there's a
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:28.160]  very reassuring element to this alex if you look at the latest elections in germany italy uh in the
[2:48:28.160 --> 2:48:33.760]  check republic for example in hungary as well as an independence movement in catalonia in spain
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:38.880]  the people are saying look enough's enough and for example in italy now you're seeing uh well
[2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:44.880]  right across all those countries have just said anti-establishment new uh anti-elite parties a lot
[2:48:44.880 --> 2:48:50.640]  of them are anti-euro so anti the single currency bar in mind these parties are now winning or coming
[2:48:50.640 --> 2:48:55.040]  up to hold the balance of power sweden as well as another one where they really are surging and that
[2:48:55.040 --> 2:49:00.720]  is the out and out public rejection of this globalist e-wide uh elites and the establishment so
[2:49:00.720 --> 2:49:04.240]  that's a very reassuring thing so before the break is what you asked me what i think the end
[2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:08.560]  game is the end game is i think the people will have the final say so it's not all doom and gloom
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:14.240]  i think that actually realistically people will have the final say and will vote out or vote for
[2:49:14.240 --> 2:49:19.680]  a change of system in terms of the reaction that i've had for some of the things that i've done
[2:49:19.680 --> 2:49:23.920]  i've put stories out there in the past just based on completely as a fact with regard to
[2:49:23.920 --> 2:49:28.960]  migration figures or regards to things i've seen over there in turkey syria etc and people just
[2:49:28.960 --> 2:49:32.960]  tend to just accuse you of lying they say you're lying they tell you a racist this is nothing that
[2:49:32.960 --> 2:49:37.360]  you you know there's nothing that you could say or do as soon as you bring up the topic of
[2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:41.680]  you know immigration or having any kind of control on it whatsoever even a skills based
[2:49:41.680 --> 2:49:46.960]  immigration system you tend to get hounded by other people in the mainstream media or just a lot
[2:49:46.960 --> 2:49:50.480]  of the members of the general public because that is what in a way they're conditioned to feel now
[2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:54.560]  and think now that anyone who doesn't want anything other than the complete law is not to say if you
[2:49:54.560 --> 2:50:00.080]  ask a democrat they go i want no borders at all but i go with mexico has them i mean other you
[2:50:00.080 --> 2:50:06.400]  have to have them they're like no nothing nothing i mean it's just insane yeah absolutely i mean
[2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:10.320]  look if you don't have any borders then why have any countries you know and people want countries
[2:50:10.320 --> 2:50:14.480]  the world cup was just on everyone was supporting their own country weren't they right why don't
[2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:18.320]  we support our own countries on the day-to-day basis and you know in england how bad it's got
[2:50:18.320 --> 2:50:24.000]  our legs during the world cup people were banned from flying the flag of britain the of england
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:29.360]  sorry the the the st george's flag because they thought it might stir up racial tensions i mean
[2:50:29.360 --> 2:50:35.520]  come on what is the world coming to you really no one would even think that but the media says it
[2:50:35.520 --> 2:50:40.560]  to create that idea yeah exactly this is it and they're going they're going on oh look the worst
[2:50:40.560 --> 2:50:44.240]  thing that can happen in england is if we won the world cup because it might stir up the far
[2:50:44.240 --> 2:50:48.640]  right tensions you know what would happen is that for about two days everyone in the country would go
[2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:53.600]  out onto the street drink some beers wave some flags hug each other and you'd all go back to work
[2:50:53.600 --> 2:50:59.120]  that is it right there's no violence there'd be no race but i've even seen the EU a decade ago and
[2:50:59.120 --> 2:51:04.240]  then a few years ago they said we want to get rid of nationalist connotations to national teams
[2:51:04.240 --> 2:51:09.840]  and have them have these these generic names yeah because they want the breakdown of it because
[2:51:09.840 --> 2:51:13.520]  you know why ultimately they want the breakdown is because the european union's control by about
[2:51:13.520 --> 2:51:18.320]  20 or so people apart from the george soros is of this world of course who are right at the top
[2:51:18.320 --> 2:51:24.560]  20 or so unelected officials that are right at the top of this EU pyramid now they are unelected
[2:51:24.560 --> 2:51:28.560]  unaccountable they have meetings behind closed doors they don't even want to have their expenses
[2:51:28.560 --> 2:51:34.160]  claims their finances looked into if you break down all of the nations people have no idea
[2:51:34.160 --> 2:51:38.720]  who's making their decisions for them the process that goes into it and the reasons why these
[2:51:38.720 --> 2:51:43.040]  decisions are taking place they have no idea who's in control and that's what they want as long as
[2:51:43.040 --> 2:51:47.840]  you've got distinct powerful individual countries that can't happen and that's why they're trying
[2:51:47.840 --> 2:51:52.400]  to break it down that's right they want a bunch of just followers that follow corporate propaganda
[2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:56.720]  that have no identity so they can come in and slave you show at a gut level you've traveled all
[2:51:56.720 --> 2:52:03.440]  the world you've covered this for major newspapers where do you think it ends uh how do you think
[2:52:03.440 --> 2:52:07.840]  it's going for me you say badly for the EU badly for but but they're going to try to come back
[2:52:07.840 --> 2:52:13.120]  Patrick Christie's so so at a gut level where do you think this is going yeah look man it's going
[2:52:13.120 --> 2:52:18.080]  to be one of two things it's either going to end in in the kind of the end of a lot of European
[2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:21.920]  societies we know it a lot of western societies as we know it because if we don't get a grip of this
[2:52:22.480 --> 2:52:26.880]  culture and everything is going to be become completely diluted realistically Alex I do
[2:52:26.880 --> 2:52:31.360]  honestly have faith in the people I wouldn't be here if I didn't and we are seeing elections
[2:52:31.360 --> 2:52:35.200]  right across the country I'm sorry right across the country I agree so
[2:52:35.200 --> 2:52:41.040]  everywhere nationalist populist are winning liberal conservative coalitions liberal conservative
[2:52:41.040 --> 2:52:47.840]  coalitions so so how does the EU strike back though well it's interesting we'll have to wait
[2:52:47.840 --> 2:52:53.440]  and see I think I think personally that they're a little bit too limp-wristed to be able to do
[2:52:53.440 --> 2:52:58.800]  anything without the mask slipping too much I think that they we caught them by surprise a lot of
[2:52:58.800 --> 2:53:03.920]  these conservative coalitions as you've said and actually if we hadn't done and if we hadn't
[2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:07.440]  gone mobilized on mass in the way that Brexit and a load of different people have done
[2:53:07.440 --> 2:53:11.040]  across the constant very quickly in the space of a couple of years they would have been able
[2:53:11.040 --> 2:53:16.080]  to stop it I don't think they can stop it now I mean it's going to take something monumental for
[2:53:16.080 --> 2:53:19.760]  them to do it and I you know look I haven't got a crystal ball I can't predict what that is but
[2:53:19.760 --> 2:53:24.720]  I really really do think that the people have outmaneuvered them here and these liberals are too
[2:53:24.720 --> 2:53:29.440]  weak and a bit too too slow moving to catch it and I don't think they're going to stand a chance
[2:53:29.440 --> 2:53:34.960]  against people like us I'm afraid that's right the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray
[2:53:34.960 --> 2:53:39.360]  and I think that's happening here I just don't want us to have that view and not stay vigilant
[2:53:39.920 --> 2:53:42.880]  Patrick Christie's thank you so much from westmonster.com
[2:53:44.640 --> 2:53:48.320]  all right there he goes we're going to have Lionel take over here in just a few minutes
[2:53:49.440 --> 2:53:53.760]  I covered most of the news I didn't do a good enough job on this though Paul Watson came up
[2:53:53.760 --> 2:54:00.320]  with a petition it's on infowars.com a huge new petition launched in shadow banning on social
[2:54:00.320 --> 2:54:04.640]  media censorship and the point is Congress is ready to hear this they're having hearings
[2:54:04.640 --> 2:54:09.920]  the president's ready they are totally banning people that expose pedophilia I mean you get people
[2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:16.400]  fired for pedophilia promotion and and you're still bad and they shadow ban you so these are
[2:54:16.400 --> 2:54:21.840]  fights we want to wait into like oh they'll fight us we're here for the fight yeah I get it they're
[2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:26.880]  going to come after you no I they already did I get it well you're going to have a fight on your
[2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:33.440]  hands I'm not trying to just sit on the sidelines my whole life and you know just eat juicy steaks and
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:39.520]  screw around you know I want to eat juicy steaks but I want to be victorious I want to be free I
[2:54:39.520 --> 2:54:46.560]  want to build a future and so all these men sit on the sidelines God most men I know are just
[2:54:46.560 --> 2:54:53.440]  absolutely go along get along candy ashes but there is a cadre of men of every race color and creed
[2:54:53.440 --> 2:54:57.280]  who are the human race that want freedom in the future and they're the people I salute and want to
[2:54:57.280 --> 2:55:05.040]  thank and appreciate but go sign the petition at change.org and it's our petition just to point
[2:55:05.040 --> 2:55:09.840]  this out we're doing other petition as well and this stuff has a big effect I demand that social
[2:55:09.840 --> 2:55:15.280]  media companies in censorship alternative voices change.org and Paul Watson links to it in the
[2:55:15.280 --> 2:55:21.360]  article on infowars.com and it goes through how you're being shadow banned how you're being censored

[2:59:43.680 --> 2:59:51.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[3:00:08.640 --> 3:00:22.320]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[3:00:22.320 --> 3:00:45.040]  the year is 1995 and info wars launches the last of america's counter globalist probes
[3:00:45.040 --> 3:00:52.160]  in a freak mishap info wars.com and alex jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit
[3:00:52.160 --> 3:00:58.880]  which freezes his life support systems and returns alex jones to earth 25 years later
[3:00:59.600 --> 3:01:04.960]  transdimensionally over the spacetime continuum through full space where people are extremely
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:10.960]  lazy the social engineers are there laughing what we envisioned 100 years ago 20 years ago
[3:01:10.960 --> 3:01:16.720]  is now already awake while the society unravels men run around totally frantic not knowing how
[3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:21.280]  to be men and women run around frantic not knowing how to be women and they don't understand that it's
[3:01:21.280 --> 3:01:26.640]  an animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be informed it's fulfilling
[3:01:26.640 --> 3:01:34.480]  to be involved it's fulfilling info wars tomorrow's news today all right i covered a lot of news
[3:01:34.480 --> 3:01:40.000]  today and linel's coming up always power packed and then the war room with oren shawyer and roger
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:45.280]  stone obviously i think about all the news we broke and that's why they want to shut us down
[3:01:45.280 --> 3:01:50.880]  and why they say we're fake news because we're real news but look at this french news agency
[3:01:50.880 --> 3:01:59.120]  and yahu story that just tells you everything sensors jump into action as china's latest
[3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:05.600]  vaccine scandal ignites and then if you actually read into what it's really doing they've got a
[3:02:05.600 --> 3:02:12.960]  bunch of fake vaccines going out for rabies you name it and there they just censor things here
[3:02:12.960 --> 3:02:18.480]  they have a vaccine damage fund of billions of dollars that since the mid 80s has been paying
[3:02:18.480 --> 3:02:25.280]  out for all the damages and then you say hey vaccines are tainted they've got problems they go
[3:02:25.280 --> 3:02:29.840]  shut up conspiracy theorists there's nothing's nothing ever happened they had the swine flu
[3:02:29.840 --> 3:02:37.360]  in the 70s killed tens of thousands of people the vaccine so i just point this out because you
[3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:45.360]  know what percentage of us vaccines get made in china the last time i saw was over 70 percent
[3:02:45.360 --> 3:02:57.200]  let's just round down 70 percent of the vaccines are made in china are enemy that owns hollywood
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:04.800]  hates america and is engaged in all this garbage so that's how my brain works like i said the

[3:06:27.840 --> 3:06:33.200]  you take over my friend thank you my friend i've got three things i want to say today so listen
[3:06:33.200 --> 3:06:41.120]  and listen good number one i'm tired of hearing every little interstitial moment on fox news or
[3:06:41.120 --> 3:06:46.720]  or on cnn about every little moment hey do you hear the words that clapper knows something about
[3:06:47.520 --> 3:06:52.640]  obama when he was such as hey did you hear the word that the that the feist accord that we have
[3:06:52.640 --> 3:06:59.120]  the documents and that the the carter page feist warrants were based on the dossier that hillary
[3:06:59.120 --> 3:07:06.560]  clinton paid for we know all this would somebody please just indict somebody exactly we broke this
[3:07:06.560 --> 3:07:15.040]  we broke this years ago alex i'm getting sick and tired of every day finding every little ooh
[3:07:15.040 --> 3:07:20.880]  did you see this did you see this look i don't know about you but unless and until hillary clinton
[3:07:20.880 --> 3:07:25.760]  is charged with something unless and until she is charged with anything specifically something
[3:07:25.760 --> 3:07:30.080]  evolved with let's say clinton foundation clinton global initiative clinton health act she went
[3:07:30.080 --> 3:07:34.560]  and that was put on repeatedly she says in her own book but says trump should be arrested for
[3:07:34.560 --> 3:07:44.160]  doing it publicly that's one thing second thing i've got to say is i don't understand what president
[3:07:44.160 --> 3:07:51.520]  trump is waiting for julian assange is a hero i don't care how you say it no i agree trump's
[3:07:51.520 --> 3:07:55.280]  got a party let me say this though what about ran paul called for it this morning now president
[3:07:55.280 --> 3:08:00.880]  exploring he's being with ran paul right now stripping clapper obama all these people they're
[3:08:00.880 --> 3:08:05.360]  out of office they still have access to everything they still got their fingers in the pie here
[3:08:05.360 --> 3:08:10.560]  he's looking to take it from comey brennan all of them i cannot understand how anybody you know
[3:08:10.560 --> 3:08:14.640]  alex when somebody normally is unceremoniously removed from their position you say give us your
[3:08:14.640 --> 3:08:19.840]  your door pass card your parking space i got the hell out of here the id and i understand there's
[3:08:19.840 --> 3:08:25.360]  a certain degree of professional courtesy but the big thing i want to say right now the number one
[3:08:25.360 --> 3:08:31.840]  story is for the longest time people have looked at entertainment hollywood in the like of being
[3:08:31.840 --> 3:08:39.920]  something almost you know unnecessary but harmless all they make movies since the days of of frank
[3:08:39.920 --> 3:08:47.440]  capra all the way to when he became a a a propaganda propaganda agent during the war very good though
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:53.200]  to the time that hollywood and war bonds were working together from the time that that the the
[3:08:53.200 --> 3:09:00.720]  intel cia and and os s and others worked with the mob there is this gordon and not of people
[3:09:00.720 --> 3:09:09.440]  who are seemingly unconnected but who make the strangest bedfellows and hollywood number one
[3:09:09.440 --> 3:09:17.920]  is not only the money source the feeder system propaganda central but it is now the tip of the
[3:09:17.920 --> 3:09:26.320]  the not tip of the spear but the little scab of the purellent fur uncle the sebaceous purellent
[3:09:26.320 --> 3:09:31.600]  boil it's the center of the disease trying to stop america's rebirth it better the wrong side of
[3:09:31.600 --> 3:09:37.440]  history is getting its ass kicked so it gets more virulent than a petulant attempt to stop this
[3:09:37.440 --> 3:09:43.600]  which is going to end up destroying it well what's happening right now is when these seemingly
[3:09:43.600 --> 3:09:51.680]  strange tweets that now that i can't believe that hollywood is this stupid to say that the
[3:09:51.680 --> 3:09:57.520]  james gun you know tweets are just about something that happened a long time ago when meanwhile
[3:09:57.520 --> 3:10:03.360]  following the the rozan rule now the rozan rule says if you tweet something that somebody
[3:10:03.360 --> 3:10:09.120]  believes to be racist that will make you a racist well if you tweet something that involves you
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:14.240]  being a pedophile aren't you a pedophile and to think that others like so mobler and others
[3:10:14.240 --> 3:10:19.360]  are coming forward in the defense right and rozan bar said i love hitler and all this stuff we'd
[3:10:19.360 --> 3:10:23.600]  say okay she's bad get rid of her she didn't even say that they projected hitler onto her a jewish
[3:10:23.600 --> 3:10:29.200]  lady meanwhile these guys are saying we want to do these bad things to kids thousands of times
[3:10:29.200 --> 3:10:33.520]  and then we're told oh just ignore all that and what's happening there's three things let me ask
[3:10:33.520 --> 3:10:37.920]  this alex what would have happened if during the during the course of one of these um uh tweet
[3:10:39.280 --> 3:10:45.920]  sessions uh a minute mr gun had used the dread end word would that have negated oh here
[3:10:45.920 --> 3:10:49.520]  would have been fired immediately as long as you know about kidnapping and raping little girls
[3:10:49.520 --> 3:10:54.480]  it's okay right that's okay that's a quirky kind of behavior that was a long time ago
[3:10:54.480 --> 3:10:59.840]  now three things number one and alex i can tell you this being in here being around these people
[3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:04.800]  they live and you know this too they live in a world that says let me tell you something you
[3:11:04.800 --> 3:11:13.040]  hasty you rusticator your corn poem bibb overall red nick uh you know what kicker i'm hollywood
[3:11:13.040 --> 3:11:19.920]  you don't tell me what to do this is our sense of humor they think they're royalty but this is our
[3:11:19.920 --> 3:11:24.800]  sensibilities in our worldview and we don't want you talking to us about this number two they have
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:31.600]  this thing and it's been said symbolism symbology will be their downfall and wherever they go they
[3:11:31.600 --> 3:11:37.600]  want to share with a sense of imperviousness they're they're impenetrable this is our humor
[3:11:37.600 --> 3:11:43.840]  like it or not they also number three don't recognize the fact that this is permanently recorded
[3:11:43.840 --> 3:11:49.680]  and they further don't understand and i want people to understand this and this may seem inconsistent
[3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:59.040]  and but please do not confuse somebody saying or joking about pedophile offenses with somebody
[3:11:59.040 --> 3:12:09.760]  being an actual convicted child rapist or the like an idea as despicable as it is it's not
[3:12:09.760 --> 3:12:14.720]  that so you asked then why are they so obsessed with promoting i think it's just a sense of
[3:12:14.720 --> 3:12:23.280]  nastiness just to show how rebellious they are alex you have no idea we have been here in the
[3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:29.280]  earth for that and i i've been doing comedy stuff and stand up for for years and i don't know when
[3:12:29.280 --> 3:12:37.200]  it happened but the humor quotient took a bad turn where it became angry and then it's only about
[3:12:37.200 --> 3:12:44.720]  shock it's only about shock precisely and instead of being funny it's do you have an attitude and
[3:12:44.720 --> 3:12:53.680]  listen i i'm you're you're a gentleman and a scholar but i use uh scatological references i tend to
[3:12:53.680 --> 3:12:59.920]  wax caprolalic every now and then but it's never a substitution for wit now what you have is you
[3:12:59.920 --> 3:13:05.360]  have these people oh and then you have sarah silverman who's looking around saying my career
[3:13:05.360 --> 3:13:11.360]  is in the crapper i don't know what to do wait a minute maybe i could have my kathy griffin moment
[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:18.400]  and to think of the thing that she is now pushing her way threat affiliate world she says support
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:26.480]  pedophilia if you have courage right but she's daring to say you folks don't understand that we
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:30.400]  don't know how cool it is to kidnap a kid out of their backyard and rape him to death for a week
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:38.080]  then hang him up by piano are and they also don't understand she thinks that we're just a bunch of
[3:13:38.080 --> 3:13:42.880]  folks with twitter accounts and that we are no match you know alex you i have a friend of mine
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:46.960]  i'm going to say something that's so crude well not really crude but listen to the metaphor
[3:13:46.960 --> 3:13:53.440]  i've got a friend of mine he says and he's a he's an italian filler and he said remember one thing
[3:13:53.440 --> 3:14:02.240]  there's more of us than them we can drown them in our urine meaning that the enormity that if we
[3:14:02.240 --> 3:14:09.680]  decide to if we got off of humanity got off the couch these elites are gone and right precisely
[3:14:09.680 --> 3:14:15.600]  and they have been thinking for too long that they run the show so right now i just want to recap
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:24.000]  three things mr president i am so in support of you i i voted for me i didn't know how you
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:31.200]  do at first but i am magnificently impressed with how you have upset the apple cart and
[3:14:31.200 --> 3:14:38.720]  changed the deep state but i am tired of having to hear the judge napolitano's are the
[3:14:38.720 --> 3:14:45.280]  uh uh joe de genivas and brian you know shon had a bless your heart tell me every day and here's

[3:26:45.520 --> 3:26:51.680]  waiting looking around saying we're going to get and there was chaos and they're bumping into each
[3:26:51.680 --> 3:26:57.120]  other when you're buzzing around or whatever they whatever ants do they hum they buzz whatever they
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:27:02.720]  do if all of a sudden the president announced the first indictment against hillary clinton
[3:27:03.280 --> 3:27:07.520]  the mainstream media would melt wolf blitzer would have a conniption whatever a conniption is my
[3:27:07.520 --> 3:27:11.280]  mother talking about a conniption fit i don't know what that is rachel maddo would have to be
[3:27:11.280 --> 3:27:17.200]  sedated they wouldn't know what to do all of their anti-trump stuff would stop that would be it next
[3:27:18.640 --> 3:27:25.120]  i don't know what the president is talking about or or what excuse me when he brought up the fact

[3:39:02.160 --> 3:39:08.080]  and he's there one day this is in the 40s or 50s just a younger strapping marine out of work and
[3:39:08.080 --> 3:39:15.360]  all of a sudden who pulls in but everybody in hollywood welter pigeon spencer tracy you name it
[3:39:15.360 --> 3:39:22.960]  and all of them are not only closeted not that there's anything wrong with that but in the 40s
[3:39:22.960 --> 3:39:29.520]  and 50s you know jack warner and these guys they they kept a lid on that you did this not this didn't

[3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:46.000]  guys are freaks from jones quafford that has always been hollywood but let me tell you the
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:53.200]  difference there was no internet but this mentality continued and let me tell you also do you know
[3:39:53.200 --> 3:40:01.280]  when it really gets good if you want to see freak city whenever you have any kind of an award
[3:40:01.280 --> 3:40:10.880]  ceremony any kind of an award or anything in new york at the mat or the galas wherever these people
[3:40:10.880 --> 3:40:19.600]  will move in wherever they just assemble and they get to live in this weird bubble that says

[3:40:26.960 --> 3:40:33.600]  and let me also tell you somebody needs to get a hold of harvey weinstein yes i mean i i i can't
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:41.760]  this is personal on a personal note when i prosecuted i saw some stuff that was pretty bad
[3:40:41.760 --> 3:40:51.840]  but nothing absolutely nothing affected any more like juvenile cases dependencies
[3:40:53.840 --> 3:41:01.440]  child sexual predation you don't know what it's like everybody has something maybe somebody in
[3:41:01.440 --> 3:41:07.760]  their family the number of people with that something happened to them but when you really
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:21.600]  understand that something that is so medievally naturally against the the laws of nature are
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:31.440]  now a part of a systematic uh exhibition sport some weird i don't know what you want to call it
[3:41:31.440 --> 3:41:42.880]  some medieval organized spectator sport horror where kids are part of movement and child trafficking
[3:41:42.880 --> 3:41:50.080]  there's a movie out have you seen it it's the new um oh what is his name the new bonicio del Toro
[3:41:50.080 --> 3:41:56.640]  movie uh where he plays the assassin and they asked his father my brother's name uh anyway you'll
[3:41:56.640 --> 3:42:00.080]  know what his name is the name and there's one particular scene where they asked him they said
[3:42:00.880 --> 3:42:06.720]  what's being trafficked today and somebody said you know it used to be drugs but drugs are too much
[3:42:06.720 --> 3:42:13.520]  too much money too much money to to cultivate the cocaine to have the fields to pay off all
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:21.520]  these people no now it's human trafficking and human trafficking and children acting as mules
[3:42:22.160 --> 3:42:33.200]  layer upon layer of child predation it is bigger than anything cicario this how they let this
[3:42:33.200 --> 3:42:40.640]  movie through this is actually very good if ever there was not a movie in support of a second trump
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:48.800]  term this is it the level of depravity is not alex hyping it up this is real this is sick
[3:42:48.800 --> 3:42:55.040]  and we're going to continue talking about it stay tuned anyone who's studied history and knows how
[3:42:55.040 --> 3:43:02.960]  human systems work is horrified we have global hardcore anti-human psychopaths in control the
[3:43:02.960 --> 3:43:08.640]  big corporations they're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control dumb humanity
[3:43:08.640 --> 3:43:13.920]  down ahead of replacing us with machines and trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we
[3:43:13.920 --> 3:43:18.720]  have a human future they are launching a civil war against nation states right now collapsing
[3:43:18.720 --> 3:43:24.240]  our borders and my only message is this everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now
[3:43:24.960 --> 3:43:29.600]  everybody should be very very urgent because the left and the globalist are frantic and launching
[3:43:29.600 --> 3:43:35.040]  their anti-human plan because they crave to control people those of us that are pro-human
[3:43:35.040 --> 3:43:39.920]  don't crave power we already have the power but we have to realize these scum are coming after us

[3:47:04.880 --> 3:47:22.240]  you are listening to an info wars dot com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[3:47:22.240 --> 3:47:35.680]  you are the resistance riders on the storm ethyl merman my friends i gotta stop right now and i've
[3:47:35.680 --> 3:47:45.360]  got to say i know i feel your pain i swear to you you know what it's like knowing what we know
[3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:52.400]  do you have friends of yours that when you go out maybe to eat or something or you talk and you
[3:47:52.400 --> 3:47:58.880]  realize my god they have no idea don't you kind of envy them do i do you think uh
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:09.920]  that we should like talking about pedophilia did you ever think that one day you would wake up and
[3:48:09.920 --> 3:48:19.120]  rather than talking about the military or or war or the economy or whatever it is that you normally
[3:48:19.120 --> 3:48:29.200]  talk about we're talking about how we live in a society where some millionaire whatever is actually
[3:48:29.200 --> 3:48:39.920]  lauding celebrating laughing about this the the the abuse of children and other people who is at
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:52.880]  some of blair or others or sarah silverman are defending tweets that celebrate i mean i do not
[3:48:52.880 --> 3:48:57.520]  understand it have you seen this other fellow who was it ian black or what what's his name the other
[3:48:57.520 --> 3:49:03.600]  the other guys i mean this is this is just i'm thinking about this this can't be happening
[3:49:04.560 --> 3:49:10.720]  who is even arguing this who is saying wait a minute oh you can't can't do that and yet when
[3:49:10.720 --> 3:49:19.920]  somebody brings up and i have said before the pizza gate stuff was handled absolutely poorly
[3:49:19.920 --> 3:49:27.920]  because you can't jump into saying that somebody who by the way certainly requires a little bit
[3:49:27.920 --> 3:49:36.000]  more you know investigation that that's the same as somebody actually being caught doing something
[3:49:36.000 --> 3:49:42.640]  you see there's a difference between probable cause and reasonable doubt give you a perfect
[3:49:42.640 --> 3:49:50.480]  example sometimes whenever we talk about or i talk about 9 11 people say you know on 9 11 on the
[3:49:50.480 --> 3:49:59.760]  days of 9 11 they found these four israeli guys in the white van that were dancing and because
[3:49:59.760 --> 3:50:06.320]  they were dancing israel was responsible for bringing down the towers like wait a minute what
[3:50:06.320 --> 3:50:13.760]  yeah there were four israeli dancing what does that have to do with with with with actual causal
[3:50:13.760 --> 3:50:20.960]  connection well there you go during the oj simpson case which is before your time some maybe
[3:50:21.920 --> 3:50:29.760]  they thought everybody they would say maybe the sun did it the sun well maybe justin
[3:50:30.880 --> 3:50:36.000]  simpson what are you talking about we need to go back to school and say well well before
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:43.280]  we continue with us let's explain a little bit about correlation versus cause let's explain a
[3:50:43.280 --> 3:50:49.840]  little bit between somebody who's doing something that deserves some help policemen detective follow
[3:50:49.840 --> 3:50:59.360]  this guy that is not enough now what gun wrote or whatever is not pedophilia it is theoretically
[3:50:59.360 --> 3:51:07.680]  because that is a mind preference a thought preference a sexual ideation it doesn't necessarily
[3:51:07.680 --> 3:51:16.880]  mean that it is the act itself child sexual battery is not the same as that desire which led to it
[3:51:16.880 --> 3:51:28.240]  parapheria chronophilia heba philia efebophilia of attraction for post pubescent and attraction it
[3:51:28.240 --> 3:51:34.720]  does not mean you have done it we we've mixed the words together it's like when people say
[3:51:34.720 --> 3:51:42.720]  now this is this is just disgusting pedophilia describes something if you have for example
[3:51:42.720 --> 3:51:50.640]  pyromania is not the same as arson if i came to you was that you know i really want to burn
[3:51:50.640 --> 3:51:57.600]  down houses i really want to set houses on fire i really want to do this i want to do this you
[3:51:57.600 --> 3:52:06.720]  can't arrest me for a thought yet now if i burn a house down because of insurance pop premiums
[3:52:06.720 --> 3:52:13.040]  or a proceeds of the like that's a different story so pedophilia pyromania have nothing to do
[3:52:13.040 --> 3:52:18.160]  with the actual act itself just like people always say we should we should impeach trump you mean
[3:52:18.160 --> 3:52:23.440]  convict trump what you mean you want to convict him not want to impeach him you want to just charge
[3:52:23.440 --> 3:52:30.560]  him what you don't even know what impeachment is do you not really so get these words right
[3:52:30.560 --> 3:52:36.960]  and there's something very very scary about this i don't want anybody and this may really
[3:52:36.960 --> 3:52:42.880]  throw you off oh you're gonna say what is this guy talking about i don't want this gun fired
[3:52:44.800 --> 3:52:51.440]  that's not my thing i'm gonna say hey look some of blare james gun you can do whatever you want
[3:52:52.320 --> 3:52:58.240]  keep him i don't i don't want to tell you whom to fire you should be able to say anything you want
[3:52:58.240 --> 3:53:06.080]  but then read it go ahead now i can say whatever i want but my goal is not to fire people shut
[3:53:06.080 --> 3:53:15.280]  people down let me ask you something please do me a favor somebody please tell me and i again i just
[3:53:15.280 --> 3:53:22.720]  want to tell you this i'm not calling for her firing but why is joyry still an ms dnc i know she's
[3:53:22.720 --> 3:53:29.040]  on what the graveyard shift in the weekends she's between colon blow ads and uh the shower rape docks
[3:53:29.040 --> 3:53:36.400]  that block up or whatever it is how is this woman still on the air again i'm not this is a woman
[3:53:36.400 --> 3:53:45.360]  and that expression says it all what uh am joy she was she wrote homophobic statement is loma
[3:53:45.360 --> 3:53:53.920]  phobic statement fat shaming i mean she covered it in a blog she wrote years ago which of course
[3:53:53.920 --> 3:54:02.640]  somebody went in and changed after the fact time bandits went back in time and wrote these
[3:54:02.640 --> 3:54:09.200]  because the wayback machine and the library of congress says no those comments you made miss
[3:54:09.200 --> 3:54:17.200]  reid were were made at the time you made this years ago there there we have a snapshot of that
[3:54:17.200 --> 3:54:23.280]  blog or whatever it was then no no i didn't do that excuse me miss reid you don't understand this
[3:54:23.280 --> 3:54:31.440]  we did it was there time bandits time travelers using Einsteinian dynamics went back in time
[3:54:31.440 --> 3:54:42.080]  and altered it she's still there roseanne gets fired because they set her up
[3:54:43.040 --> 3:54:47.600]  because they wanted her fire look that whole thing i don't know what's happening right now
[3:54:47.600 --> 3:54:53.680]  this whole world i guess the obamas are in netflix and that's finish up valerie jaren here
[3:54:53.680 --> 3:55:01.040]  but roseanne was fired because the story goes that they think she said that uh valerie jaren
[3:55:01.040 --> 3:55:06.960]  looks like an ape that's what they think she said she never said that she never said that
[3:55:06.960 --> 3:55:12.000]  roseanne's problem is she's an idiot in thinking that these folks are going to understand any kind
[3:55:12.000 --> 3:55:19.120]  of references to dystopian plots and the like but it doesn't matter she's gone because they wanted her
[3:55:19.120 --> 3:55:27.040]  gone they wanted her gone and they're so corrupt are these people so monumentally corrupt is
[3:55:27.040 --> 3:55:35.680]  apparently abc and these folks that they're going to take the number one show the number one show
[3:55:35.680 --> 3:55:47.040]  breaking all kinds of records but they want her gone because she's one of them and they're waiting
[3:55:47.040 --> 3:55:56.080]  and waiting and they said we're gonna whatever she says how about this now here you go valerie jaren
[3:55:56.080 --> 3:56:01.920]  planet of the eight that'll do next meanwhile here comes sarah gilbert and this and that
[3:56:01.920 --> 3:56:08.240]  and that show is going to make my mother the car and super train look like the mary tyler more show
[3:56:08.240 --> 3:56:15.360]  in comparison that's how depraved these people are they would kill their own profit bottom line
[3:56:15.360 --> 3:56:23.680]  just to get somebody back so the bottom line in peroration in this valedictory of mine right now
[3:56:23.680 --> 3:56:35.520]  we have so much insanity to deal with so i started off by saying number one president trump please fire
[3:56:35.520 --> 3:56:41.920]  somebody please indict somebody i like watching alex and i like watching david night my good friend
[3:56:41.920 --> 3:56:49.520]  i'm on wednesdays with him and i like watching fox news but i want you to step up and fire people

[3:57:12.240 --> 3:57:21.360]  um this man you're in office in essence because he exposed that which a real media would have done
[3:57:22.000 --> 3:57:31.360]  and finally this pervasive pedophilia this pedorasty that is somehow being shelved and
[3:57:31.360 --> 3:57:40.000]  being reclassified as some kind of quirky off b behavior has got to stop now all right thank
