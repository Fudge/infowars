[03:51.600 --> 03:57.720]  Christian and Jewish graves this is by the way these guys AFP and others have
[03:57.720 --> 04:05.600]  shown it they wear al Qaeda patches and run-up al Qaeda flags as Fox News and LA
[04:05.600 --> 04:09.840]  Times reported and I'm not patriotic you have to understand they're like oh it's
[04:09.840 --> 04:13.840]  because Obama's a Muslim no it's because the globalist run al Qaeda they ran it in
[04:13.840 --> 04:18.560]  the 70s they ran it in the 80s they ran at the 90s against the Serbs they run it
[04:18.560 --> 04:24.600]  now and they'll use the threat of al Qaeda that they control the jihadis they
[04:24.600 --> 04:28.920]  control to menace the United States so they can federalize everything this is
[04:28.920 --> 04:36.360]  an elementary fact so Syria with the Russian troops in it is in it in the
[04:36.360 --> 04:43.160]  it is in a asymmetrical warfare black op infiltration this is always an old way
[04:43.160 --> 04:46.800]  to bring down a country just send in a bunch of special forces to dress up like
[04:46.800 --> 04:51.320]  locals like the MI6 got caught doing an Iraq to kill one group so a civil war
[04:51.320 --> 04:55.480]  starts and watch what's happening in Syria this will be the globalist plan in

[07:11.240 --> 07:15.520]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:15.520 --> 07:19.880]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:19.880 --> 07:23.960]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:23.960 --> 07:28.520]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.520 --> 07:32.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[08:58.320 --> 09:02.000]  we're gonna be breaking down today and we have a special guest joining us that
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.720]  I'll tell you about coming up here in a little while but if you go to info wars.com
[09:08.720 --> 09:15.160]  you can see the story that was the top story earlier this morning and has now
[09:15.160 --> 09:19.880]  moved down to the bottom of the featured news section and I'm gonna have one of
[09:19.880 --> 09:25.440]  my webmasters move it back to the top and red link it because if this won't
[09:25.440 --> 09:31.000]  wake up the West to what's happening nothing will. We're told give up our
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.120]  rights because radical Muslims want to kill us while the government brings in
[09:35.120 --> 09:40.360]  record numbers of Muslims and we don't see terror attacks taking place. We're
[09:40.360 --> 09:45.680]  told that Al Qaeda is literally incredibly evil and powerful and hiding
[09:45.680 --> 09:52.240]  in our basements hiding under tables sneaking out at 3 a.m. like bedbugs to
[09:52.240 --> 10:00.160]  lavish themselves on our flesh. Meanwhile in the real world the 7-7 bombers in
[10:00.160 --> 10:06.520]  London MI6 Fox News London Guardian it came out hidden in plain view it was
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.200]  run by MI6 and they set up Patsy's who were taking part a drill it's all
[10:11.200 --> 10:16.080]  hiding in plain view the underwear bomber the shoe bombers all working with
[10:16.080 --> 10:20.880]  the government set up as mentally ill Patsy's put on the aircraft by the US
[10:20.880 --> 10:29.160]  and British governments on record see span congressional hearings on and on
[10:29.160 --> 10:32.280]  and on they've had over a hundred I mean even the New York Times has had to
[10:32.280 --> 10:36.600]  admit this over a hundred to last through four years fake FBI stings of
[10:36.600 --> 10:41.600]  mentally ill welfare recipients normally under 80 IQ some of a mentally
[10:41.600 --> 10:46.200]  retarded on record not just mentally ill schizophrenics you name it setting
[10:46.200 --> 10:51.440]  them up to bomb buildings bomb the Christmas trees so it's a good PR
[10:51.440 --> 10:55.080]  stunt at Christmas oh look at those Muslims good thing we're taking all
[10:55.080 --> 10:57.840]  your rights away to fight them good thing we're in all those countries
[10:57.840 --> 11:04.480]  meanwhile real Al Qaeda was created by Jimmy Carter via the Taliban continued
[11:04.480 --> 11:09.000]  through the 80s used in the 90s by the Clintons against Serbia in the south
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.680]  not on the side here the Albanian Muslims of the Serb Christians the point
[11:13.680 --> 11:17.600]  is they didn't start the fight they sent them in and basically took the
[11:17.600 --> 11:23.280]  equivalent of their Southwest and created into a new NATO globalist
[11:23.280 --> 11:26.800]  narcotics trafficking enclave where they kill the Christians that won't leave
[11:26.800 --> 11:30.400]  Kosovo and sell their organs and it comes out mainstream news but his back
[11:30.400 --> 11:38.520]  of the paper so all of this is going on and we saw a six seven month bombardment
[11:38.520 --> 11:44.160]  of Libya tens of thousands killed over 40,000 total blacks lined up and murdered
[11:44.160 --> 11:48.320]  hacked up with machetes by jihadis predominantly out of Saudi Arabia
[11:48.320 --> 11:54.080]  flying Al Qaeda flags and wearing the black patch of Al Qaeda on their
[11:54.080 --> 12:01.200]  shoulders and we saw it in Reuters AP LA Times Fox News we told you first with
[12:01.200 --> 12:04.080]  our guests like Webster Tarpley you had the courage to actually go over there
[12:04.080 --> 12:08.480]  you also went to Syria earlier this year I don't want to get Tarpley on maybe
[12:08.480 --> 12:14.160]  tomorrow or Friday about the situation geopolitically and get off the domestic
[12:14.160 --> 12:19.800]  stuff it's so divisive it doesn't go anywhere but the point is is I want to
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.920]  get him on about you know geopolitical issues all of this is unfolding all of
[12:24.920 --> 12:32.120]  this is happening and if you live in reality it's not even hidden the system
[12:32.120 --> 12:37.000]  doesn't even hide that they gave Tripoli over to Al Qaeda and the Muslim
[12:37.000 --> 12:44.280]  Brotherhood that's a globalist run and that they gave now the surrounding
[12:44.280 --> 12:52.040]  border regions in Turkey and in Jordan and in other areas to real Al Qaeda the
[12:52.040 --> 12:56.800]  same folks that do interviews saying yes I fought the Americans for you know five
[12:56.800 --> 13:00.880]  six years in Iraq and I still like to kill them I've seen these newscast but
[13:00.880 --> 13:05.160]  I'm going to kill Gaddafi first and then I'm going to kill Assad and then I will
[13:05.160 --> 13:11.160]  kill you and they're putting them in charge in places like Egypt I mean
[13:11.160 --> 13:14.960]  congressmen are now finally talking about this so this is something where the
[13:14.960 --> 13:21.680]  system thinks you're so stupid that a they're gonna use the magic skeleton key
[13:21.680 --> 13:25.320]  that can open any door they need of Al Qaeda to take our liberties Europe's
[13:25.320 --> 13:28.560]  liberties Australia they take their freedoms the name of Al Qaeda it's like
[13:28.560 --> 13:32.200]  this imaginary you like telling kids better be good of the boogeyman will

[14:34.160 --> 14:42.760]  can barely walk this is what America is okay it's done on purpose and meanwhile
[14:42.760 --> 14:48.240]  we have photos and videos and mainstream news in Europe but it's back of the
[14:48.240 --> 14:54.080]  paper even there where al Qaeda and jihadis are knocking down Jewish and
[14:54.080 --> 14:59.680]  Christian headstones in Libya and in Syria we've got links to stories where
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.840]  they're urinating on things defecating on things going in Christian churches
[15:04.840 --> 15:09.480]  burning them down blowing them up ransacking them and then clownishly
[15:09.480 --> 15:14.080]  dressing up in you know the priests where those sacrament outfits over their

[16:04.480 --> 16:08.400]  where British and US troops would capture the Taliban al Qaeda and would be
[16:08.400 --> 16:12.480]  told let them go and would be told give them chest of gold and fly them into
[16:12.480 --> 16:16.240]  Pakistan to start the next destabilization campaign called the
[16:16.240 --> 16:21.720]  airlift of evil even Newsweek reported on it just like it's reported our troops
[16:21.720 --> 16:26.000]  are ordered to grow the opium this isn't debated people say well if this

[26:50.560 --> 26:55.560]  guess he is British so that is I guess kind of the he's a great guy the point
[26:55.560 --> 27:00.000]  is it's it's always restrained with Watson even though it's it's it's horrible
[27:00.000 --> 27:07.360]  to us see it Syrian rebels ransacked Christian churches and you can see the
[27:07.360 --> 27:12.440]  defacing the gravestones the urinating on them links to Libya murdering the

[27:34.800 --> 27:40.640]  money and our troops and our advisors going to do this when the al-Qaeda groups
[27:40.640 --> 27:45.720]  are in uniforms with al-Qaeda flags and patches saying we're gonna kill all the
[27:45.720 --> 27:52.080]  Jews and we're gonna kill Christians that don't leave and they've actually been
[27:52.080 --> 27:59.760]  killing Christians blowing them up and stuff so again and it is only a certain
[27:59.760 --> 28:05.120]  group of Muslims in reality that are into this stuff and really will do this
[28:05.120 --> 28:07.760]  stuff that's why all over the Muslim world you got ancient churches people
[28:07.760 --> 28:13.240]  live side-by-side in peace until the jihadis funded by British intelligence
[28:13.240 --> 28:17.120]  when they wanted to take over some of the governments that were industrializing
[28:17.120 --> 28:21.160]  look up Lawrence of Arabia they created Saudi Arabia all of it it's on record
[28:21.160 --> 28:25.360]  those that don't know history didn't repeat it then Hitler took over that
[28:25.360 --> 28:30.440]  network of the Muslim Brotherhood and the headquarters and all the rest of it
[28:30.440 --> 28:36.080]  of those different systems what was left of the Ottoman Empire and then after
[28:36.080 --> 28:39.680]  World War two British and US intelligence took it over and they were
[28:39.680 --> 28:44.040]  trying to build skyscrapers build power plants sell their own oil they had
[28:44.040 --> 28:49.320]  secular poets and people like Mosaic in charge of Iran and they said no meet
[28:49.320 --> 28:56.800]  Mr. Jihadi from Saudi Arabia he's coming in he's gonna blow up things and then
[28:56.800 --> 28:59.280]  we're gonna blame it on you and then we're gonna take over and that's all
[28:59.280 --> 29:05.040]  declassified and so the Muslim extremist billions of dollars spent this is
[29:05.040 --> 29:09.160]  even in the Washington Post but they say it was an accident from the 50s right
[29:09.160 --> 29:14.280]  through the 90s for setting up madrasas with children's books saying
[29:14.280 --> 29:18.200]  murder America killed the Christians three-hanger nades plus three machine
[29:18.200 --> 29:24.360]  guns it creates six weapons I mean look this up and now they're killing
[29:24.360 --> 29:28.240]  Christians and Jews everywhere but and it's like oh yeah so we gotta be in all

[33:59.640 --> 34:05.440]  smoke on the water fire in the sky
[34:05.440 --> 34:20.060]  oh yeah all right enough of that oh man you know Robert plant lives in Austin
[34:20.060 --> 34:27.560]  lives are almost full-time I've confirmed out on Lake Travis I think I'm
[34:27.560 --> 34:30.840]  gonna try to get Robert play on the show all right side issue side issue I must
[34:30.840 --> 34:35.720]  stop right there almost shut up right there okay what else is going on here
[34:35.720 --> 34:41.160]  today by the way Billy Corgan of smashing pumpkins new hit album out that
[34:41.160 --> 34:44.280]  bombshell interview we haven't even had time to write articles about yet he
[34:44.280 --> 34:48.600]  covers TSA new world order world government the matrix reality system
[34:48.600 --> 34:52.200]  all of it I've never heard him go this far that interview is up on the lower
[34:52.200 --> 34:56.220]  right-hand corner at info wars dot com very exciting to see this awakening
[34:56.220 --> 35:00.360]  happening and he's been a listener for many years discovered that years ago but
[35:00.360 --> 35:04.280]  to actually talk to him privately hang out with him when he's here in Austin
[35:04.280 --> 35:07.720]  but he's never really gone public with all this stuff and he really began to do
[35:07.720 --> 35:14.100]  it with us yesterday on air pretty big interview fact I titled it the real
[35:14.100 --> 35:18.640]  Billy Corgan colon down the rabbit hole but I think I might change it to Billy
[35:18.640 --> 35:23.480]  Corgan you know smashes the matrix or something I don't know pretty powerful
[35:23.480 --> 35:29.760]  interview he's a smart guy you know other media taxing okay and again he's not
[35:29.760 --> 35:32.760]  you know ten years ago is what you call kind of a liberal because he wants
[35:32.760 --> 35:35.360]  freedom and stuff he's figured out well that's controlled and the rides
[35:35.360 --> 35:39.240]  controlled I mean it's just very exciting to see that awakening taking
[35:39.240 --> 35:44.360]  place a lot of other people awake as well but they never have the nerve to
[35:44.360 --> 35:52.200]  come on the air and that's okay I understand I understand that I'm gonna
[35:52.200 --> 35:59.040]  shut up at that point oh man I tell you I know too many secrets interesting
[35:59.040 --> 36:02.680]  things people would like to know but I'm only told this stuff because I keep my
[36:02.680 --> 36:06.920]  trap shut and then people even tell me stuff that isn't confidence but then
[36:06.920 --> 36:09.560]  like makes it in confidence you know I mean then I can't ever talk about it
[36:09.560 --> 36:14.840]  very interesting things okay that's enough here's the point I want to make
[36:14.840 --> 36:19.200]  right now I'm up here having fun trying to have some gallows humor joking
[36:19.200 --> 36:22.920]  around a little bit just hearing that deep purple made me happy now I'm in a
[36:22.920 --> 36:26.800]  pretty darn good mood and I've got all this very serious news here in front of
[36:26.800 --> 36:32.200]  me I mean look at this they've got al-Qaeda and jihadis and Muslim
[36:32.200 --> 36:36.880]  Brotherhood people running around murdering and killing Christians and
[36:36.880 --> 36:42.240]  Jews blowing up churches dressing up in orthodox and Catholic priest outfits
[36:42.240 --> 36:47.520]  desecrating things robbing things urinating on things kicking over
[36:47.520 --> 36:51.400]  gravestones and I'm supposed to like this I mean and I'm supposed to give up
[36:51.400 --> 36:55.120]  all my rights because these people are coming to get me but the stinking
[36:55.120 --> 37:00.640]  criminal banker run government is the one controlling them on record I mean
[37:00.640 --> 37:07.000]  it's too much it's too much and now it's confirmed there's all sorts of special
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.920]  forces just like Libya from the West leading jihadis into Damascus and a
[37:12.920 --> 37:16.520]  siege of the presidential compound and they're going in and blowing up and
[37:16.520 --> 37:21.760]  shooting up TV stations I mean this is how you take over the US is one of the
[37:21.760 --> 37:25.920]  few countries you can't do this to because everybody's armed if somebody
[37:25.920 --> 37:31.120]  tries this stuff people are gonna kill them but if they ever got control of the
[37:31.120 --> 37:36.680]  TV as long as something says Fox CNN on it or CBS if you could put you could put
[37:36.680 --> 37:41.960]  an alien up there in a general's outfit going I am I am general Gwipel snap I
[37:41.960 --> 37:47.400]  now rule you George Washington is a stinking pig if you want to collaborate
[37:47.400 --> 37:51.680]  please line up and you have all the city city leaders lining up and
[37:51.680 --> 37:56.560]  and the green alien would bend over and say now prove you submit kiss my
[37:56.560 --> 38:00.480]  rumpus and the average sellout yuppie would say we've always been ruled by
[38:00.480 --> 38:04.800]  the Gwipel snap aliens from the Quickel snack star system and it's a
[38:04.800 --> 38:08.400]  conspiracy theory to say they aren't the legitimate government and we need the
[38:08.400 --> 38:14.360]  UN taking over of course that's satire before the New York Times I've had this
[38:14.360 --> 38:19.360]  happen I've joked around and then it ends up in the newspaper that I'm being
[38:19.360 --> 38:24.000]  serious but I mean you get the point guys does that make sense in there I mean
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.080]  my point about you have aliens come in take over the TV stations and the US
[38:28.080 --> 38:33.240]  could resist them but they wouldn't if they had say on America's Got Talent
[38:33.240 --> 38:38.800]  Howard Stern introduced the alien alien leader you will get to judge who the
[38:38.800 --> 38:42.120]  winner is tonight people say well that's it I support the alien leader it is
[38:42.120 --> 38:48.120]  Shakespearean in its absurdity it is Shakespearean in its absurdity yes sir I
[38:48.120 --> 38:52.440]  would say it was Vonnegut Kurt Vonnegut I would say Vonnegut Vonnegutian
[38:52.440 --> 39:00.480]  Vonnegutian Vonnegutian okay you know what I'm high on right now adrenaline I
[39:00.480 --> 39:06.400]  swam two miles this morning and I went out to the lake and I said look you're
[39:06.400 --> 39:12.120]  not gonna swim half speed you're fat you're degenerate you're weak what is the
[39:12.120 --> 39:16.480]  point of jumping in this lake if you're not gonna swim hard so I swam hard to the
[39:16.480 --> 39:21.000]  point of stopping for a moment to vomit in the lake now I'll be arrested for
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.320]  1021 violations and I feel absolutely turbocharged right now I don't even know
[39:26.320 --> 39:30.960]  I should be on air right now because I feel like a trillion dollars I really do

[41:59.320 --> 42:03.640]  me over the edge here okay let's get into a daily caller article exactly my
[42:03.640 --> 42:08.680]  thoughts yesterday I never even got to this Arizona congressman administration
[42:08.680 --> 42:15.760]  has declared war on Arizona and they have already all over the country most
[42:15.760 --> 42:19.400]  cities 800 plus will not arrest illegals for drunk driving no insurance but
[42:19.400 --> 42:22.680]  citizens have the book thrown at them and I've talked to people inside the
[42:22.680 --> 42:26.160]  prosecutor's office who've come to my office high-level off record and said oh
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.000]  it's worse than you think they get they tell them to give $10 fines to the
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.120]  illegals no ID even needed that's why all these criminals from Mexico come up
[42:35.120 --> 42:38.800]  here you know like the railway serial killer who'd killed dozens of people and
[42:38.800 --> 42:42.840]  he would get arrested all the time but had all these fake names now they're
[42:42.840 --> 42:46.480]  announcing they're gonna make a bunch of illegals legal no judge no jury no
[42:46.480 --> 42:52.240]  Congress violent the law Obama is and now they're telling Arizona we don't
[42:52.240 --> 42:56.720]  care what you arrest illegals for we're never picking them up rape robbery
[42:56.720 --> 43:00.640]  anything I mean this already goes on in Houston reports hundreds of thousands
[43:00.640 --> 43:05.800]  you heard me right look it up hundreds of thousands a year in that county metro
[43:05.800 --> 43:09.000]  area when I saw the headline years ago I couldn't believe it over several hundred
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.880]  thousand released and many of them aggravated felons and it said arson
[43:13.880 --> 43:20.080]  rape robbery I mean if you're an illegal alien you can come here and grab kids
[43:20.080 --> 43:25.800]  off the street go kill them women off rob banks five six welfare checks you are
[43:25.800 --> 43:30.720]  God but if you're a citizen you are the lowest dirt of the planet I don't care
[43:30.720 --> 43:35.960]  what color you are I don't care if you're you're you're black white Hispanic
[43:35.960 --> 43:43.120]  Asian if you're an illegal alien in this country right now you are God God and if
[43:43.120 --> 43:49.360]  you try to come here legally you are trash so there is that report and they
[43:49.360 --> 43:52.600]  are announcing oh listen we're gonna make the illegals legal and when you
[43:52.600 --> 43:55.800]  arrest them for crimes and want them deported we ain't picking them up Jack
[43:55.800 --> 43:59.680]  this has already been going on I'm glad it's out in the open now this is the
[43:59.680 --> 44:04.600]  totally lawless criminal government we have let me continue though I gotta say
[44:04.600 --> 44:08.040]  it when people do the right thing I've got to give them credit
[44:08.040 --> 44:15.880]  Boehner the Speaker of the House the Speaker of the House Boehner says they
[44:15.880 --> 44:21.240]  will go ahead with contempt vote against Mr. Fast and Furious they say the
[44:21.240 --> 44:24.200]  House will move forward with a contempt of Congress voting attorney general
[44:24.200 --> 44:28.440]  Eric Holder over the botched gun trafficking operation known as fast
[44:28.440 --> 44:32.760]  and furious that's like saying Jeffrey Jeffrey Dahmer grabbed teenagers off
[44:32.760 --> 44:36.360]  the street and killed them and it was a botched it wasn't only got botched as he
[44:36.360 --> 44:43.400]  got caught I mean right here it wasn't the only reason they got botched is
[44:43.400 --> 44:47.440]  because they got discovered it goes on here is another one the new American
[44:47.440 --> 44:52.320]  yes a gun control agenda behind Fast and Furious the memos that have been out
[44:52.320 --> 44:56.720]  for eight months are now public I mean they're now good I can't believe this
[44:56.720 --> 45:00.800]  is actually covering it there may be a real war inside the power structure we
[45:00.800 --> 45:04.640]  can use this to really get a bunch of these people in prison it could happen
[45:04.640 --> 45:09.160]  like Nixon but Nixon was an angel cake compared to Obama people like but wait a
[45:09.160 --> 45:13.160]  minute it's left for a paradigm lesson lesson if Mitt Romney does anything like
[45:13.160 --> 45:17.120]  this if he gets in I'm gonna say throw him in jail this keeps him honest this
[45:17.120 --> 45:21.200]  scares these tyrants this backs him off before they run off and start World War
[45:21.200 --> 45:29.400]  3 good good arrest all of them they are not invincible arrest John Corzine's
[45:29.400 --> 45:36.320]  remit global go after them arrest them arrest them arrest them it's time and
[45:36.320 --> 45:40.520]  push Obama into staging a false flag we're gonna expose it you this time
[45:40.520 --> 45:43.200]  we're watching our people are everywhere when you put the
[45:43.200 --> 45:46.200]  underwear bomber drugged out of his mind on the plane witnesses said he could
[45:46.200 --> 45:52.400]  hardly talk and was drooling your little Manchurian idiot that the State
[45:52.400 --> 45:55.240]  Department admits they were ordered to get on the plane and give him the visa
[45:55.240 --> 45:59.240]  didn't even have a passport we have you now you understand we have you and
[45:59.240 --> 46:03.120]  there's nothing going to stop us because we don't have any choice they're

[46:24.560 --> 46:29.280]  you can't miss the targets are 360 around you you can only fight when
[46:29.280 --> 46:32.080]  you're cornered that's when you've got the moral authority that's when you've
[46:32.080 --> 46:35.080]  got it all people think that's a ridiculous statement good don't let any
[46:35.080 --> 46:39.760]  of them surrender don't let any of them escape that's the whole point draw them

[55:07.160 --> 55:13.280]  understand they got reeducation camps for you it's not for the Muslims that
[55:13.280 --> 55:19.480]  they scapegoat the hardcore globalist Muslims work for them figure it out it's
[55:19.480 --> 55:25.600]  for you it's for you there's so many globalist and collaborators I said we
[55:25.600 --> 55:28.400]  released all the nonviolent people out of prison and just put them in prison
[55:28.400 --> 55:31.840]  give them there to give them their jury trial everything but put on I mean I
[55:31.840 --> 55:35.000]  guarantee you I could get up before a jury put these different globalist
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.560]  different banker heads different politicians up put Obama on the stand
[55:38.560 --> 55:42.800]  did you write the letter saying the UN commands our military I'd read from the
[55:42.800 --> 55:48.400]  Constitution that is treason jury how do you find judge you give us the
[55:48.400 --> 55:53.400]  sentencing or jury give us the sentencing it's real easy I could convict as a
[55:53.400 --> 55:57.680]  prosecutor all of them right now I can go in there in one hour in front of the
[55:57.680 --> 56:03.680]  jury and destroy all these people their crimes are so public I'm ranting I'm
[56:03.680 --> 56:07.000]  sorry Dean in California go ahead what was your other point sir
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.840]  one last thing 1776 we really need to reawaken this and coming up on 4th of
[56:12.840 --> 56:19.160]  July here's what I'm doing I'm wearing your 1776 shield shirt I'm going to be
[56:19.160 --> 56:24.360]  out there at our local town 4th of July celebration I'm going to be handing out
[56:24.360 --> 56:29.960]  your cards I have flyers and giving people the links to all of your movies
[56:29.960 --> 56:35.000]  Obama deception follow the Republic Invisible Empire Endgame it's going to
[56:35.000 --> 56:39.760]  say wake up to the tyranny engage your fellow Americans and remember the spirit
[56:39.760 --> 56:46.720]  of 1776 absolutely that's why they I saw an article I didn't get to in the Army
[56:46.720 --> 56:53.360]  Times of all places bad-mouthing the war of 1812 and saying we lost and making
[56:53.360 --> 56:57.960]  fun of the US and I went my memory is most historians said we won that and it
[56:57.960 --> 57:01.200]  was a very righteous war against our people being kidnapped on the high seas
[57:01.200 --> 57:05.800]  and stuff and pressed and I went and refresh my memory and most historians I
[57:05.800 --> 57:10.160]  saw the votes on the historical sites 9 out of 10 even in foreign sites say we
[57:10.160 --> 57:16.480]  won that and here was army slash publications saying we lost a war and
[57:16.480 --> 57:22.440]  that we were stupid and the president was stupid I just the traitorousness
[57:22.440 --> 57:25.640]  that I see out there I appreciate your call God bless you it's just
[57:25.640 --> 57:32.040]  unbelievable let's talk to Lawrence in Virginia you're on the air welcome good
[57:32.040 --> 57:37.320]  afternoon Alex hey buddy I have a question and a comment actually a
[57:37.320 --> 57:41.920]  statement first um do you really believe that there's actually going to be an
[57:41.920 --> 57:47.040]  election in November between Romney and Obama I think anything is possible they
[57:47.040 --> 57:50.160]  are getting ready that's what I was gonna cover later for the collapse of
[57:50.160 --> 57:53.440]  society there's no doubt they've never been more dug in and ready for it I
[57:53.440 --> 57:57.160]  mean I'm telling you if people aren't getting pins and needles if people don't
[57:57.160 --> 58:00.160]  have the hair all over the back of their neck standing up there and they don't
[58:00.160 --> 58:11.280]  have any any connection to discernment or reality that's for sure yeah um what
[58:11.280 --> 58:15.360]  what what I what I wanted to bring up actually was about the TV I think I think
[58:15.360 --> 58:21.040]  other people said it before but people really did turn this thing off I talked
[58:21.040 --> 58:24.840]  to people that watch it all the time and it when you listen to them speak it's
[58:24.840 --> 58:32.080]  like they're they're parroting a news anchor it's crazy totally brainwashed no
[58:32.080 --> 58:35.560]  that's what they do they're in a subconscious sleep level stay there
[58:35.560 --> 58:46.080]  this is important back in one minute this is GCN the Genesis communications
[58:46.080 --> 58:53.400]  radio network hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now
[58:53.400 --> 58:57.040]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[58:57.040 --> 59:00.520]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[59:00.520 --> 59:04.160]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and
[59:04.160 --> 59:08.000]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[59:08.000 --> 59:11.560]  our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of
[59:11.560 --> 59:17.040]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[59:17.040 --> 59:21.080]  supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part
[59:21.080 --> 59:25.080]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get
[59:25.080 --> 59:29.160]  enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at

[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.880]  collapse where they'll pose the saviors let's get them really creepy we're
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.840]  continuing your calls now I got a guest on for about 40 minutes or so that will
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.920]  continue with calls right through to the end of the show and a bunch of other
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:45.720]  world news we haven't gotten to yet but right now let's go back to Lawrence in
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:50.200]  Virginia Lawrence you were talking about you got cut off by the break people
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.640]  that are big TV watchers the average adult thinks four and a half hours a day
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.880]  the average child's over six the average video game a video game
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.880]  player is an additional three plus I mean the number changes here it gets
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.000]  worse that's the numbers are a few years old I should look up the latest
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.360]  numbers but I've seen numbers of some people that watch up to you know 14
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:14.040]  hours a day of TV or video games combined it is insane and they are in a
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:18.560]  dreamlike state and they repeat whatever they see on television thinking that
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.760]  makes them smart it's only one echelon of people that even watch the news and
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.800]  they think they're smart just for watching it and they will regurgitate
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:31.360]  what they heard like they're showing off that they're smart still others that
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.520]  don't even watch the news they just get the messages from TV that's why the
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:41.200]  dramas the sitcoms the fiction is just laced anti-family anti you know you
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:47.800]  name it anti-gun and for those of us that are awake it's like watching clowns
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:54.080]  on PCP like lemmings run off the edge of a cliff go ahead well people tell me
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:59.640]  things like well I I don't let it control me I only watch certain things
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:04.360]  for get this information or that and you know they've never read stuff like
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:09.920]  Edward Bernays information and I don't think any of us are smarter than them
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:15.200]  they've been practicing this for over a hundred years you know you you try to
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.360]  it's like trying to outsmart the devil no exactly you've just got to know it's
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.400]  super dangerous and there are a bunch of liars listen I track what they do
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:27.200]  constantly and it's such a spaghetti of deception it's like a cauldron that
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.080]  they're they're not even in control they're like riding the beast just like
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:36.360]  the Bible says the new world order is like a whore riding the out of control
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:44.000]  beast you see what I'm saying exactly I think people really need to turn that
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.240]  thing off I stopped watching years ago of course I didn't increments first I
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:52.200]  stopped watching news around Clinton when Clinton was president because he was
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:58.320]  lying all the time and I just I just I got I ended I don't watch that thing
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.680]  anymore I get my information from the internet I read a lot I think people need
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.960]  to read more you can't really judge anything and you have to read a lot of
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.680]  different things if you just read one thing you're gonna get one one opinion
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.520]  well what's gonna happen is over time you're gonna learn who's lying on
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.040]  purpose who does an overall good job that makes some mistakes that's what we
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:27.800]  do who who tells the truth but puts a spin on it and you know you learn you
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.800]  learn where people stand just by watching what they do by their fruits you
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:37.360]  will know them and for anybody who sits there I mean I saw some so-called
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.640]  libertarian leader yesterday I've never even heard of at the porcupine fest
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:46.320]  say you know don't engage in conspiracy theories and then they defined
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.040]  conspiracy theories as thinking the government tries to take power or do
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.720]  corrupt things and I'm like well I mean what moron in any culture doesn't know
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.360]  you better keep the government under control or it'll grow out of control like
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:06.880]  cancer and it just shows how over the top everything's gotten and just how
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.840]  desperate the power structure is to try to get people back into trust in the
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.320]  system look the general public doesn't trust the system anymore they just feel
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:20.000]  powerless and don't pay attention and so really aren't in the game we've got to
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.640]  get people in the game to realize you're not gonna have to save the world by
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:29.120]  yourself you've got to do just little things little things that will bring
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.720]  down the new world order together all of us doing little things good to hear
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.960]  from you appreciate your call Lawrence we'll get to Chris Bob Ray Jason and

[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:14.920]  because there's a war on for your mind you know for all the bad things that are
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:19.760]  happening it's a cycle throughout history of tyranny comes in the people get
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.880]  oppressed they fight back people get morals again because they realize
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:29.480]  morals are about survival taken care of your children then people become
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:34.920]  decadent because once you have liberty you get plenty you become decadent over
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:39.480]  a few generations corruption creeps back in and the tyranny comes back in and
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:44.120]  the cycle happens over and over again and we've entered a very dangerous point
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.120]  in the cycle right now where the power structure realizes the pendulum wants to
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:53.040]  swing back towards freedom and truth and decency and honor and quality and
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:59.600]  beauty and so they're trying to push it back the other way we're in a fight here
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:06.000]  now for the next 30 minutes or so then I'm gonna go to your phone calls we are
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.360]  joined by a filmmaker and you know this came in a few months ago before it was
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.760]  officially coming out and Weldon said hey do you want to carry this it's a new
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.320]  vaccine film and I said we already carry some presentations by Dr. Sherry
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.520]  Tenpenny who's by the way in this we already carry some books and he said
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:25.520]  okay he watched he said you I think you need to watch this and it's one I don't
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:31.240]  know one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve plus big
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:41.960]  film festivals it's the greater good and it is a film by the way that we carry an
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.440]  info wars.com see support us and the filmmakers when you get it and get a
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:49.360]  free citizen rule book this is something you should give to every school
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:56.680]  library donate it to every public library you want to fight the new world
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.160]  order folks that's a great way to get my films other people's films I authorize
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.520]  you to make copies of my films by the way just libraries won't tend to take
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:08.960]  them though if it's a bad copy but side issue the point is you know a bad looking
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.160]  cover because they think it's bootleg or something we allow you to bootleg but
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.360]  they won't side issue the point is you should air these on access television
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:19.960]  you should give it to people that you see that have children and you have
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:25.480]  neighbors you see that the woman is pregnant I I can't help it I see
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:29.040]  pregnant women now in grocery stores even with her husband and I'll come over
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:33.120]  and I'll say man isn't it great I've got three children hey you might want to
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:36.400]  look into vaccines because they even tell pregnant women to take vaccines now
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.280]  and until four years ago they always said don't take them because of auto
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.400]  immune problems and miscarriages and a lot of times they go yeah we heard that
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.760]  it was always bad to take shots my sister's a nurse this has happened about
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.960]  a week ago the lady said and she says until a few years ago they said don't
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.360]  take them but now they're saying we should but she's saying I shouldn't thank
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.640]  you and if somebody does say hey man you're on business I've never had that
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.560]  happen just say okay I warned you and again that's not getting in somebody's
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:10.360]  business if you know that until about three and a half four years ago it was a
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:14.240]  big PR rollout saying especially pregnant women all the inserts before and
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:17.920]  by the way they still say it said don't take this when you're pregnant or and
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.200]  then now they say we'll talk to your physician because they've always known
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.320]  this I mean doctors nurses listening they're like yeah that's always been the
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:30.440]  case again the system is fleeing forward in that they know there's massive
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.880]  opposition the media admits that they admit all these medical people are
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:39.040]  coming out all this is unfolding and so their answer is well they got national
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:44.280]  maps the higher educated area of the country the lower the vaccine rates and
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:49.160]  the news says these these wealthy well-to-do at college educated people
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:56.080]  have gone crazy no ladies and gentlemen we've gone from one in 25,330
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.840]  something years ago with autism to one in 58 now and it's a cocktail of things
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:05.480]  but the point is this stuff is deadly and it's not just the mercury that goes
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:09.240]  by the blood brain barrier because it's directly injected into the body it's
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:13.800]  the adjuvants dr. Blalock brain surgeon and others are broken down and they
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:18.280]  have studies on this they know enough of me because I want to give her at least
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:21.640]  30 40 minutes before we go to your calls it's just that I want you to
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:25.480]  understand this is so life and death and this is finally the tool just like a
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:30.560]  noble lie is great to expose false flag terror finally a high quality

[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:30.720]  trailer for the greater good this has to be in the hands of every nurse every
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:35.120]  doctor force them morally to face what's happening every family getting ready to
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.520]  have children you need to see the greater good very well produced key
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.680]  testimony about the cover-up the fact they know it's killing and maiming people
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:50.360]  consciously the CDC's own documents this is the proof here is the trailer two
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:58.280]  years ago vaccine completely changed my life I would do anything to get my life
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:03.640]  history teaches us how effective vaccines vaccines are the best choice for
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.040]  almost all children I don't think it's that black and white vaccines in some
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.320]  way have been a victim of their own success the government they're trying
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.840]  to protect society but these motivations interfere with you know safety
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:19.240]  issues in the last few decades the numbers of doses of vaccines have more
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.760]  than triple we are seeing a rise in the number of children with disabilities what
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.160]  if these shots that are supposed to protect kids actually hurt your child
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:31.600]  after the shots I started getting sick I've had two strokes partial paralysis
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.640]  partial vision and I'm having seizures I would have never dreamt that this was a
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:42.520]  side effect of a vaccine many of these have the potential to be neurotoxic the
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:46.600]  research is incomplete and the certainty is not scientific a number of
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.800]  prescription drugs that have been licensed as safe have been found to be
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:56.080]  unsafe social fabric it is better to insist on vaccination than to allow free
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:00.320]  rain the people who are approving the vaccines are taking the word of the
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.440]  pharmaceutical companies the majority of vaccine research is paid for by the
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:09.720]  vaccine manufacturers themselves we're the only country other than New Zealand
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:14.280]  that allows advertising on TV for pharmaceutical drugs you can't sue the
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:18.080]  drug company that made the vaccine that's not science that's politics Texas
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:22.920]  governor Rick Perry has ordered that schoolgirls must get the Gardasil shot we
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:26.680]  can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way the only thing that we
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.600]  oppose is forced vaccination sadly some people don't do what's best for their
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:37.440]  children unless it's mandated we're not zealots we're not some people that are
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.880]  looking for a conspiracy or a fight a vaccine program it's one size fits all
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.800]  we worry about the future you could have 30 40 50 different vaccines mandated
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:52.360]  and absolutely no accountability you have a prescription for disaster I have
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:59.000]  a child and then I follow the rules and I damage this time that's hard I just
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.680]  want everybody to lay down their arms and figure out what is making them so
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:10.800]  sick the greater good available at info warshop.com but
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:15.560]  again it goes from the perspective of showing both sides that's what makes it
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:21.240]  so effective but here's the issue they have the clips that I talked about four
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.840]  years ago in Maryland where they said it's the law you'll be arrested if you
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.400]  don't take shots with all the black people like it's a concentration camp
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:35.440]  being herded in to be shot up with darking police dogs and I got the state
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:40.080]  attorney who says that on my show he started laughing and admitting it wasn't
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.520]  a law and that he doesn't give his kids the shots like it was cute and cool and
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:49.000]  they've got that clip from years ago I couldn't find in the film that's why
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  it's so powerful all right I've given you the pitch get it out to everybody
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.200]  this is coffin nails to their lies and I will say what the film doesn't I have
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.360]  all the Rockefeller documents the Sterilin Senate the cancer viruses it's
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.480]  on purpose okay it's that simple the Rockefeller took over medicine 80 90
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.440]  years ago they funded Hitler Kaiser Wilhelm Institute its eugenics better
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.840]  learn about it better find out then they sell you the treatments that they
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:24.120]  control as well all right I want to go to Leslie who is our guest Leslie
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:29.520]  Manukian and she is the writer of the film and producer I know that's a big
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.640]  intro with me ranting we're gonna go to break here in a few minutes but you've
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:37.080]  got the floor tell us about this film and any comments about my points I just
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:43.720]  made well thank you so much for the fantastic introduction and for having
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:48.000]  me on the show Alex it's really a pleasure to be here I couldn't agree with
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.600]  you more that this is one of the most important issues that we face today on
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:18:00.120]  the planet and you know you talk about the really cavalier attitude of this
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.080]  public health official saying that you know he doesn't give him to his own kids
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:07.040]  but he's rounding up literally 2,000 families we're not giving their kids
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.520]  chickenpox vaccine or something like that and I think we all really have to
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:16.640]  ask ourselves what have we come to where are we and are these policies based
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.280]  on sound science are these have these these compounds that we're injecting
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:26.760]  into our 12-hour old infant safe is there a reason to be doing this and I
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:30.120]  think the answer to all those questions is really that the science doesn't
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:34.240]  support it that the science isn't there and that these policies are not based
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:41.320]  on on a sound foundation of science and if that's not the case then how can we
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:45.800]  possibly be endorsing this in particular given that we require children in
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:50.040]  many states to have them before they can go to school or for other public
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:54.520]  health services which are paid through taxes so I think we're really in a
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:19:00.440]  place where you know people need to start questioning what we're doing and
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:05.480]  why and why God gave us immune systems in the first place and what we can do to
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:10.320]  keep those those strong and healthy and whether or not we need the government to
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.400]  tell us how to behave or how to keep our immune system functioning well it says
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.480]  you point out if some pandemic came out and then they had something that was
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:21.160]  proven to be effective that's one thing but hundreds of vaccines they want to
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:25.920]  bring online and imply like Perry did that it's the law when it wasn't the law
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:30.600]  and through fraud like in Maryland or Texas people line up believing they're
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:34.520]  being forced to well and this is a thing I live in the state of Idaho and in
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:40.000]  Idaho we have a a law that says very clearly that any person can choose for
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.640]  any reason they seem appropriate not to vaccinate themselves for their child but
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:48.280]  that does not stop the school district every year from taking out large
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:52.760]  advertising the newspaper stating that children must be immunized before they
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:56.120]  come to school Lisa bingo let's come back and talk about that fraud and break
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:03.080]  down the film a home run of truth a little over a year ago I began to do a
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:07.200]  lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:11.720]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.600]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:18.840]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:23.920]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight

[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.160]  award-winning film now available on DVD Anthony Kaufman of the Wall Street
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:20.200]  Journal wrote a new documentary about childhood immunizations the greater
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:27.160]  good could intensify debate around the potential dangers of vaccines yeah yeah
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:32.560]  it's like a handing two-year-olds loaded shotguns I mean this is just amazing
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:40.360]  that that they've gotten away with this and our guest Lisa who is Leslie who's
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:47.640]  joining us right now was just breaking down if she's the writer and producer of
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:54.520]  this film she was just breaking down the deception how they how they say it's
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:58.120]  the law and then I get the guy on a go you know it's not the Lonnie laughs it
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:02.440]  goes yeah I know I don't give my kids shots I mean this is sick how in every
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.040]  town you're listening and they lie to you and say it's the law please continue
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:11.800]  we you know what Alex I think the most interesting thing is that we never
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.320]  actually studied the safety of mercury before it was put into childhood
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.760]  vaccines we never studied whether it was safe to put in contact lens solutions
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:23.200]  or in antacids or any other places that's been put aluminum's been put in
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.040]  there too we never studied the safety of aluminum and it's been used as an
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:32.440]  adjuvant to immune system stimulant for 80 years in vaccinations and what's
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.360]  really interesting to me now is that in the last three to five years there's a
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.880]  growing group of scientists who are actually starting to do this research
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.680]  despite the fact that it's very very risky for their careers and their
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:50.120]  futures and they are finding that the aluminum vaccine is causing cognitive
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:55.840]  impairment brain damage neuron cell death in animal models autoimmune
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:00.760]  syndrome all sorts of immune dysfunction and these authors have written
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:05.840]  that the potential for just aluminum just the aluminum component on its own to
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:11.680]  cause profound impact on the brain and the immune systems of human beings is
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:18.080]  profound and yet the CDC and FDA say that it's perfectly safe and this is
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.280]  what I find the most astounding is that this has been going on for not just a
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:25.440]  few years but nearly a hundred years and yet no one's bothered to stop it well I
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:29.920]  saw mainline studies out of England and the US a decade ago where they were
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:36.320]  saying three shots for the flu three vaccines doubled the chances for Alzheimer's
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:41.400]  in studies they did they know they know aluminum cans and aluminum cookware
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.880]  I mean there there are 45 year olds getting Alzheimer's now neurological
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:51.640]  disorders off the charts cancer off the charts everything we do in western
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:56.960]  culture the bisphenol a is now in big studies linked to brain tumors linked to
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:03.040]  women going into puberty early men becoming feminized this industrial
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:09.280]  society the way it's been deployed is killing us without a doubt and if you
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:13.920]  look at the in the fertility rates the sperm counts of men in the last 50 years
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.960]  a decline of 50% at least if you look at you know how difficult it is for women
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:24.360]  to conceive same thing and there's clearly a role that vaccines play and
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:27.720]  the vaccine that the toxins that vaccines contain in disrupting our
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:33.160]  endocrine systems our hormonal system so you know I don't know how far the
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:36.400]  average person wants to go down that rabbit hole I mean clearly your viewers
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:42.480]  and listeners are far more up to speed on those issues than the massive you
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:47.680]  know the general public but they're they're clearly question-raised when
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:51.520]  we start taking vaccines that have aluminum and mercury in them that or
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.880]  mercury that's been banned in the United States and give them to the entire world
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:59.320]  outside the US and other developed countries it really has to give you
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:03.080]  pause about what the policies are really about and when we know that these
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.160]  things are disrupting our hormonal balances and then you combine them with
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:10.240]  all the pesticides and as you say that the phenol A and all the other
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.400]  contaminants in our food supply the GMO food you know on and on and on these
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:19.400]  things are clearly having a major impact on our ability to procreate our
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:25.080]  ability to think independently on our ability to stand up for ourselves and
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:31.360]  our ability I think to really question what's going on and vaccines are you
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:36.480]  know without going too far down that rabbit hole clearly are causing damage
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.640]  and I think the point of our film is that not that we know all of this it's
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:44.560]  proven not that it's unequivocal but that there is a growing body of science
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:51.680]  out there that has question on vaccines all I know is women's breast cancer is
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:56.360]  up 2,000 plus percent pediatric cancer depending on which type over 10,000
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:01.240]  percent autism thousands and thousands of percentage from 25,000 to one in
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:05.960]  68 one and 57 I mean it varies the numbers everywhere where it's
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:12.680]  industrialized neurological disorders skeletal disorders what's going on is
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:17.560]  killing us and let's talk about the autism thing the CDC and FDA the vaccine
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:22.360]  authorities in general continue to assert that there is no science leaking
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:28.920]  mercury to autism and yet an independent scientist did a review of all of the
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:32.760]  available science empirical research looking into the mercury autism link and
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:36.440]  she found that the body of science favor to link 3 to 1 not the reverse stay
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:39.520]  there we're gonna come back and break down some more of those numbers there's
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:44.360]  been other big studies as well where nations that have higher vaccine rate
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:50.400]  have higher rates of all sorts of diseases we'll be right back we're on the

[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:23.080]  when you're driving my way if you break the law you'll hear from me I know I'm
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:27.880]  working for the state I'm a highway patrol
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:33.840]  well you know me when you see me close my doors painted white my sirens are
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:39.280]  screaming in my flashing red light I'll work all day and I'll work all night just
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:44.160]  to keep a law on order not to do was right if I write you on a ticket then you
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:50.200]  better drive slow I'm just doing my job earlier I was looking around for the
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:55.920]  proper quote in Providence by memory was correct it was a Marine Corps general
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:00.720]  known as the professor because he studied so much military doctrine and was so
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:06.560]  successful in World War two and the Korean War they were surrounded at the
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:14.480]  Chosin Reservoir in Korean War early in December 1950 to be precise they were
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:19.880]  surrounded he succeeded in breaking through and leading a 70 mile march to
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:23.160]  safety it was reportedly more than 20 times their numbers I just went and
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:29.520]  looked it up on the history site who he was from my memory and he said sir we
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.840]  are surrounded excellent we can attack in any direction as that wasn't really
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:38.880]  even a sarcastic point if you've got a smaller force but have more high power
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:43.040]  workable weapons this is the communist Chinese that we're fighting didn't have
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:48.280]  very good weapons that matter of its 10 20 30 times the number now you can attack
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:52.720]  in any direction go any direction you want and of course some would look at
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.200]  it as I mean obviously it's a bad place to be in but now you're committed now
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:02.840]  there's not any games now you know you've got a fight and that's the position
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:07.240]  we have to put ourselves in you know I get emotional about this because I sit
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:11.600]  here calmly researching this year after year and when I pop this in the DVD
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:16.640]  player and because I would go from memory and say oh yeah the state attorney I had
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:20.840]  him on lining up thousands of black people crying with dogs barking at him
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:26.440]  saying it's the law you got to take shots and I got him on and said hey you
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:29.000]  know it's not the law to take shots you know you should have told him about the
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:35.680]  waiver he said oh you should be a lawyer I mean the interview is out there oh you
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:38.840]  if in fact now that we know his name is in the film so I've forgotten we ought
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.360]  to look it up and find that whole interview so it's amazing it was on
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.720]  seeing and they're going it's the law to take shots kids crying was shown all
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:49.960]  over the country to make you think it's the law and a total fraud and I get the
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:52.680]  guy on he's like yeah you ought to be a lawyer I want to be a lawyer because I
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:57.480]  know a little bit about reality and he's like yeah I don't vaccinate my kids
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:02.040]  it started laughing like it's funny that he knows it's bad he doesn't do it to
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:05.960]  his kids but he goes out with police standing behind him and goes we can do
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:10.040]  this the easy way or the hard way you will take it or you will go to jail and
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:15.640]  and we we tried to get our media people out there to talk to the families lined
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.600]  up with the police dogs and the riot cops and the police are like get back
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:24.160]  don't talk to them so they could engage in a fraud and shoot them up again does
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:28.280]  that give you any idea how wicked these governments are what else are they lying
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:33.480]  to you about it you bet I get emotional about that because in Nazi Germany we
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:36.640]  use that example lock that's where it happened medical tyranny Soviet Union
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:46.960]  same deal going back to our guest the maker of the documentary film the
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:53.080]  greater good Leslie Manukian available at info warshop.com for 10 minutes I'm
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:57.920]  gonna shut up because I'll keep asking questions you've got the floor why should
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:01.960]  people see this film what will they see in the film who should people show this
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:07.040]  to can people air it on access television I mean how do they how do they show
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:13.040]  this to people and save lives well at this point it's interesting to me we
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.720]  were asked that who's your target audience who do you want to see the film
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:21.600]  we want everybody to see the film because there are somewhere between 200
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:27.760]  and 400 vaccines in development right now and the vaccine authorities want
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.880]  every man woman and child on the planet to have vaccines every year of their
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.640]  life basically from cradle to grave that's what's being recommended with the
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:41.120]  flu vaccine and there are many others that are coming down the pipe so you
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:45.000]  know people often think that oh I had my kids my kids are 10 my kids are 12 they're
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.960]  grown I don't have to worry about this anymore this issue actually affects all
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:54.280]  of us and as you so rightly mentioned early on in the show neurodegenerative
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:58.040]  diseases are on the rise and not just a little bit but they're reaching
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:03.520]  epidemic proportion most adults nowadays when in their elderly years develop
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:08.920]  some kind of dementia and that's not the way it's always been and it's not
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:12.880]  supposed to be that way and so you know the reason we made the film is because
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:16.440]  we wanted to reach everybody and help people to understand that this is an
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:20.560]  issue they should all care about for their for their children's health but
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:24.480]  also for their own but also very importantly for them to understand
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:29.120]  that this issue is not nearly as black and white as they've been told by the
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:33.600]  mainstream media you know we are constantly told that there's no science
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:37.960]  showing that vaccines cause any harm we're constantly told that there's no
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:43.080]  evidence that vaccines are linked to autism asthma allergies learning
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:48.480]  disabilities speech delays on and on and on gut issues all this stuff asthma and
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:53.560]  the reality is that I've compiled a document of over a hundred studies
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:59.480]  papers letters to editors and things like that that show that vaccines can
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:03.320]  cause inflammation of the brain and permanent damage that they can cause
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:08.160]  learning disabilities and behavioral problems that they can cause immunological
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.560]  problems that they can cause gut problems that they can cause a whole
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.080]  spectrum of autoimmune disease and as I said earlier we're not you know all this
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.640]  research doesn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that vaccines are causing all
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:23.520]  these things but they certainly are enough to show that we should all have
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:27.280]  great great reason for concern and we should all want to figure out what the
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:31.480]  heck is really going on and whether or not more harm is being being done than
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:37.080]  good by using these vaccines so broadly and I think the other really important
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:40.200]  issue that we raised with the film that I think is so vital for all of us to
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:44.680]  understand is who should decide what we put into our bodies do you want the
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:49.240]  government choosing how you keep yourself well or do you want to make that
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:53.600]  choice yourself and if we don't have the freedom to choose what we inject into
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:58.080]  our own bodies and do our children's bodies then are we really free it is no
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:03.840]  secret in science that vaccines injure and kill some people no secret and given
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:10.840]  that how can we possibly you know yield that right of self-determination to
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:16.520]  some nondescript faceless bureaucrat in another place I just you know so this is
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.720]  one of the major issues that we've tried to raise with the film is helping
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:25.320]  people to understand that vaccines are not candy but there is a downside and to
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:28.480]  me Alex this whole idea that vaccines are candy that they're just it's like
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:32.160]  drinking water is the reason why those people will line up in Maryland to go
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:36.040]  and get the shots under threat of imprisonment and find because they just
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.080]  think there's no downside they believe what they've been told and so we really
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:43.360]  hope the film helps people to understand that it's not black and white you like
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:47.480]  you've been told it's far more nuanced and maybe you'll choose that you want to
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:51.280]  get the polio vaccine maybe that's what some people choose maybe others will
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:55.000]  choose they don't want any vaccines but the point is that unless you're informed
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.240]  and you really understand what the issues are what the true long-term health
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:04.520]  ramifications are then you're not free to make those choices and we need to have
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:11.080]  that information Leslie you pause there for me to interject I've had countless
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:14.560]  scientists doctors on some of them are in your film and I understand you're
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:20.520]  trying to be sound reasonable here and measured but I have talked personally on
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:26.280]  air to more than 500 over the years and to hundreds on the street every time I'm
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:30.640]  on vacation or something there's an autistic child sitting there you know
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.160]  but in the pool and I'll say hey you wanted me asking when did your son
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:38.520]  become autistic 18 months he was running around talking totally happy got the
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:42.920]  third round of shots had a convulsion in the station wagon driving home I know
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:46.480]  they used to arrest people till this came out when they would take the shot
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:49.760]  and they would collapse sometimes in the hospital they'd say oh you must have
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:52.960]  beaten them they had blood on the brain because of an autoimmune response they
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:58.080]  knew full well what they were doing they know they know that I mean the studies
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.680]  are legion and I look at the Rockefellers and all and the Bill and
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:07.280]  Melinda Gates who say get rid of grandma euthanized people eugenics forced
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:11.360]  abortion but oh we want you to take shots to live longer we care about you
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:18.080]  this is shedding a precedent for a very dangerous big pharma group most of which
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:21.680]  came right out of Germany and actually funded Hitler people study it I'm not
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:25.720]  kidding you can't make this up he was like their little creation who want
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:31.880]  medical tyranny to force this on us I have Nobel Prize winner Bertrand Russell
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:35.920]  wrote repeatedly we're gonna inject people and call them vaccines to brain
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:39.840]  damage them to make them more more manageable I mean look it up he says
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:44.600]  we're gonna change the diet diet injections and injunctions so that the
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:48.480]  public will be sheep like compared to the ruling lane so I've done the study
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:52.640]  my film in game blueprint for global enslavement covers it this is a pre
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:58.160]  meditated program you take Bayer pharmaceutical for 11 years knew they
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:02.400]  were shipping HIV hepatitis blood to hemophiliacs and the documents came out
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:05.600]  they knew and did it on purpose you have chemical biological radiological
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:10.480]  testing on foster children on troops killing them so so who is this in the
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.920]  government that did this and then when they get caught over the last 60 years
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:19.360]  they never get in trouble they never get in any trouble they net because listen
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:24.200]  my dad was top of his class in high school as a junior he was in this
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:28.200]  advanced program they called him in the University of Texas took him behind
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:33.600]  closed doors the top testers of 160 it was like six of them and gave them the
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:36.840]  speech that I'm giving you but but telling him you're gonna be part of
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:40.520]  this okay and my dad's not that special if you're in the top of your class in
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:47.080]  Texas or out or New Mexico or New York you're getting this speech today that's
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:52.520]  what I'm telling people this is a giant covert eugenics program I know your film
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:55.720]  doesn't get into that you're wanting it to be you know very balanced I think it's
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:58.840]  that's why it's the key to get out there but any comments on what I'm talking
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:04.440]  about well first of all I think I would just comment that I actually am from the
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:07.960]  system you know I went to one of the best universities in the nation and I got
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:11.080]  an MBA from the University of Chicago and I worked at Goldman Sachs for a
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:15.760]  period of years and then worked in finance for 13 years and I witnessed
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:22.600]  firsthand a lot of overt and some not so or overt corruption I actually had the
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:27.000]  CEO of a pharmaceutical company come in and tell me that their blockbuster drug
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.200]  that they were about to release was showing that it was causing death and
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:35.920]  some of the patients it was treating and that the FDA was going to make him put a
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.040]  warning on their packaging because of this but the good news was they still
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:43.440]  thought they'd be able to do seven billion in peak sales that kind of stuff
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:50.120]  is not isolated it's not unique it's going on all the time I think the real
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:56.320]  issue is Alex that the average person doesn't get that doesn't understand that
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:01.600]  and doesn't haven't connected the dots yet and so I you know I come from a
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:06.840]  place of wanting to educate people and bring them into the fold as easily as I
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:13.840]  possibly can and this is such an emotive issue that if we are too frightening
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:21.320]  to Frank then I really worry that the message gets lost and so you know I have
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:26.320]  a lot of sympathy and appreciation for all those things that you just said and
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:32.120]  but I think when it comes to the issue of vaccines that it's we will do much
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:36.320]  more to further the message and bring more people into the fold to understand
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.720]  that they should want to have freedom about what they put in their bodies and
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:47.360]  to make these choices then by being more you know inflammatory I guess and
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:54.120]  given that we are having a huge impact there was a report just last week maybe
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:46:01.160]  the week before that the federal government studied up the vaccination
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:05.200]  rate in Portland Oregon and found that in the last five or six years I forget
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:09.320]  what the exact period was but it was in a recent period in the early 2000s that
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:13.480]  the non-vaccinators rose from two and a half percent of the population to nine
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:18.000]  and a half percent of the population now that was in I think the Sacramento be
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.480]  two days ago yeah and it was been all over the place the last couple weeks but
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:27.400]  the place that they studied was Portland Oregon and my point is that that that
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:31.320]  one city has seen the number of people not vaccinating go from two and a half
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:35.240]  to nine and a half percent in the last several years people are starting to
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:39.720]  wake up to this and in order to bring more people in what we really want to do
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:43.080]  is change a lot what we really want to do is help wake people up what we
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:47.200]  really want to do is empower people and we strongly felt as filmmakers that we
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:51.920]  do that by not beating them over the head but no I agree with you I I mean I
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:56.200]  agree with this is something for the Joe Schmo out there questioning Leslie
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:00.080]  Manukian again the writer and producer of the greater good available at info
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:03.880]  warshop.com or their site greatergoodmovie.org I could tell you
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:07.920]  I've seen the film great filmmaker for somebody that I hadn't done a lot of
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:12.280]  media before I could tell you had a lot of passion for this and it's a labor of
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:19.120]  love. What woke you up to this is a good question. Well you know like I said I was
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:22.600]  working on Wall Street for a long time and I had that experience I mean I was
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:27.200]  I headed up Alliance Capitals European Growth Portfolio Management Business in
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:31.680]  London for a period of years and it was my job to interview CEOs of multinational
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:38.760]  corporations and for many years I would sort of witness this stuff but not really
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:43.560]  it didn't really hit me until that CEO came in and told me that he was going to
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:47.400]  do seven billion of peak sales and kill a bunch of people in the process and I
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:52.520]  just realized that I was playing for the wrong team and shortly after that I met
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:56.760]  a man in London who told me that vaccines could cause harm and I literally
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:00.560]  thought the guy was nuts I said you know you're out of your mind vaccines are
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:04.600]  the greatest invention of humankind there's no doubt in my mind that these
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:08.680]  things are great and he said listen that's the one perspective read this book
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:12.760]  he gave me Neil Miller's book vaccines are they really safe and effective and I
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:18.720]  read it extremely skeptical I'm an analyst by nature I was super skeptical
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:21.640]  but at the end of the book I went and I looked in the back and there were over
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:27.160]  900 footnotes to peer reviewed medical literature and mainstream news pieces
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:34.160]  and I thought 900 over 900 references can this be true can this be real I didn't
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:37.120]  want to believe it but I committed to myself right then and there and this is
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:40.840]  about 11 years ago that someday I was gonna make a movie on this and I was
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:46.120]  gonna go and do my own research read the science myself and go and look these
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:50.920]  people in the eyes look CDC and FDA and vaccine developers and patent holders in
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:55.560]  the eyes and ask them myself what's really going on here and you've done
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:59.240]  that and they look scared when you're talking to them you've had a homerun the
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.080]  greater good again get this out to everybody and a little bit of time we've
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:07.720]  got left I want to go back though because I'm guessing because I've had
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:11.680]  experiences similar to this where you thought oh he's joking I'm gonna make
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:14.560]  seven million and kill a bunch of people but I've interviewed genetic
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:17.440]  engineers who were making three million dollars a year they're like hey this
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:21.960]  potato is sterilizing the rats but we're getting it approved and they're
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:25.760]  like yeah there's too many people that's you that's really the plan and then
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:29.200]  they think it's a joke but then it gets approved I mean do you think he was
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:33.400]  joking when he said I'm gonna make seven million and kill people or did you go do
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:38.680]  research and realize it wasn't really a joke I realize that all that mattered to
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:45.360]  him with corporate profits and that that is really what is the driver of
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.800]  everything in the world today I mean I guess I got to the point where I
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:54.760]  recognize that there is no separation between state and the corporate world
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:59.400]  anymore and that the only way that we are going to change that is if average
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:05.920]  citizens stand up and hold their ground and this this was the first step for me
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:08.920]  in that process making this film to empower people so that they could stand
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:12.280]  up for themselves so that they could go to the lobby in California and say we're
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.840]  not going to support this bill that they've got in front of California now
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:20.120]  that'll require every person to get a vaccine exemption from a authorized
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:25.640]  medical provider every single year you know I just I recognize that this guy
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:30.160]  was just delusional but that not just he was delusional but was there were all
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:34.240]  the other people who were part and parcel of it well well listen Leslie

[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:49.560]  for holding welcome what do you think of that last guest she was awesome she was
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:53.320]  awesome just first off I want to appreciate you for everything you do man
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:57.840]  you're a true patriot get a quick question for you I know it's gonna be
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:01.320]  kind of a difficult one to answer but with things speeding up the way they are
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:04.520]  how much longer do you feel like we have before the globalist globalists are
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:11.040]  gonna implement a full-scale collapse well many areas like Greece and I have
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:19.560]  already collapsed into total bedroom but six months a year in the globalist won't
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:23.880]  do this right away or they'll back off a little if they don't think we're gonna
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:26.920]  go along with it but everywhere where they think they've got their people in
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:30.760]  place like Spain and Greece and other areas they're gonna drop the hammer all
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:34.520]  the way I mean they hate the public they want to impoverish that's their stated
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:42.280]  eugenicist a post-industrial view in fact I'm gonna cover that coming up after
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:45.920]  calls but I mean it's the banks are getting ready the big mega banks that
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:48.920]  are just fronts for the private interests that own them they're getting
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:54.200]  ready to to bring down the zombie banks and when that happens when when
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:57:00.520]  Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and other Ponzi scheme shell corporations are blown it
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:06.120]  is gonna be it's gonna make right now it's 50-50 that it's gonna be road
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:09.840]  warrior level depression we're already in a depression but it's a slow
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:14.440]  sliding one from recession into depression and of course that's on the
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:19.800]  good side it is I mean now all the main analysts are saying you better give us
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:22.960]  everything or we're gonna give you a total depression well we've already
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:27.600]  given them everything but their plan is the depression so I mean look at this
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:33.760]  article out of CNBC big banks craft living wills in case they fail and then
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:36.840]  here's another one avoiding a global catastrophe Larry Summers who helped
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:40.400]  engineer all this and he talks about things completely melting down well I
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:45.360]  mean it's mathematically impossible unless we write off the trillion the the
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:50.600]  1.5 quadrillion 1,500 trillion even hard to say that number unless we write
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:54.280]  all that off and unless we explain that's not our debt and arrest all these
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:58.360]  people they're going to bring us into total global collapse that they're
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:03.640]  gonna organize and poses saviors with a prostitute decepticon collaborator
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:09.440]  Vici French media telling us they're the saviors and it is gonna get absolutely
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:13.320]  hellish with stage terror attacks new wars they're gonna throw everything at
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:18.240]  us they have been massing basically on our border the new world order has it in
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:22.280]  every city every town against us they are surveilling us they are trying to
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:27.380]  create attack forces death squads and they are just building up the armored
[01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:32.200]  bunkers the pillboxes the machine guns the shotguns the hollow point ammo the
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:37.840]  drones for all out war against us and let me tell you they're gonna get their
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:40.360]  butts kicked

[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:19.360]  from Illinois welcome thanks for taking my call Alex how you doing buddy good I
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:26.400]  just want to know I joined the Mormon Church in 1975 and I was ordained to
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:33.080]  Bishop in 1988 and I woke up to the New World Order by reading Ezra Taff
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:39.600]  Benson's book and enemy have done this and also Cleon Scouson's book The Naked
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:44.680]  Communist and later I started listening to Chuck Carter on the radio and he
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:52.120]  woke me up even further and then I got Jack McClam's Vampire Killer 2000 and
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:02:01.440]  I started listening to you about 1988 or 98 I'm sorry I voted for Ron Paul so that
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:07.560]  might give you an idea of where I'm coming from I like I say I've been
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:15.520]  listening to you since 97 or 98 you were on WI&I out of Murphy'sboro, Illinois but
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:19.980]  and I enjoyed most of yes you have one but you had a guy owned by the name of
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:25.680]  Francis Boyle I think it was and he was talking about Romney this and Romney
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:30.680]  that and he had me going for a while until he he said that Romney was a
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:35.240]  bishop in the church and then he had these you know all these connections and
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:40.000]  blah blah and then he said then he was a made a archbishop in the church there's
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.960]  not even any such position as archbishop in our church well I have a lot of
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:50.960]  guests on and I don't even remember a professor Boyle saying that but I mean I
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:56.160]  don't know a whole lot about the Church of Latter-day Saints but I know some
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:03:02.320]  stuff I mean was Romney a bishop in the church yes okay but I mean I mean I mean
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:08.480]  my issue with Romney is that most the Mormons I know are anti-New World Order
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:13.400]  and awake more than pretty much anybody I talked to all I know is I've got videos
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:16.920]  of Romney endorsing abortion when he was governor and now he says he's against it
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:22.760]  and and you know Obamacare so I'm just talking about Romney himself he says
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:26.880]  some good things today but my question is could I believe them or would I be
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:31.640]  gullible if I think that well you know the Romney empowered did one thing but
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:35.800]  the Romney that wants conservatives to electing says another so I mean you've
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:39.680]  got the floor for a minute and a half I mean what's your point on Romney okay
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:43.800]  well like I told you I voted for Ron Paul
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:47.920]  Harry Reid's also a member of our church but I wouldn't vote for him he's the last
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:55.960]  man on earth yeah he's pretty bad yeah but with Romney I you know the Book of
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:04:02.480]  Mormon which was translated by Joseph Smith in the 1820s talks about the New
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:08.480]  World Order and so all Mormons who are Mormons know about the New World
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:12.480]  World Order and they're against it because they know that Satan is at the
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:18.360]  head of it and I believe that there's a possibility that Romney is one of those
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:23.440]  Mormons and I believe that when they were talking about Ron Paul spending him
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:29.160]  and his wife spending a lot of time with Romney and his wife I'm hoping in the way
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:34.080]  that Ron Paul got through to him and that maybe they're working on some things
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:39.120]  that will be good for us and that will appreciate but if they are they can't
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:42.640]  come out and say it right now because you know what would happen well I'll say
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:47.320]  this if Romney got in and did good things I would support it so there you
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:52.160]  have it I mean I mean I would I'll support anybody who does good things who
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:57.240]  does the right thing I just know who finances Romney and if he double crosses
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:00.760]  the New World Order they're gonna come after him

[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:06.360]  survivalseedbank.com ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN
[02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:18.040]  radio network all right coming up there is a cornucopia of mainstream news
[02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:22.800]  financial articles should get ready for a collapse the globalist banks are
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:26.760]  getting ready for total collapse well it's a mathematical certainty that it's
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:29.200]  designed to collapse I'm gonna be breaking that down at the bottom of the
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:34.800]  hour also Issa says gun control agenda behind fast and furious well he he
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:40.160]  doesn't say that that's what the memo show was to blame the second amendment
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:44.040]  I've been telling you this for over a year since it broke a year and a half I
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:50.440]  told you about fast and furious six years ago and now on YouTube they're
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:54.160]  pulling the c-span clips of the press conferences from two and a half three
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:58.980]  years ago with Holder and Big Sis and Apollo Tano bragging about their gun
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:01.760]  running operation and how they were running it because they've been caught
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:10.480]  perjuring themselves it's open and shut they go to jail and I wouldn't believe
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:14.800]  that Issa would actually go after them they are so far and so is Boehner so
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:19.940]  that's a good thing I mean I would have been happy of the Democrats would have
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:23.760]  been trying to actually impeach Bush but they didn't you've got to punish crime
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:27.920]  you've got to punish unconstitutional activity regardless of who it comes out
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:32.440]  of because then it scares the criminals and the bureaucrats to behave
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:37.760]  themselves it's very elementary psychology Ray in California Ray you're on
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:44.600]  the air go ahead Alex yes okay I wanted to say was the first off that the plan
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:49.160]  of the New World Order is containment for extermination that's the first thing
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:56.280]  I want to say if you support containment you can eliminate extermination okay
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:59.760]  I'm going with this no yeah I mean just restate what you said because I kind of
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:02.440]  misunderstanding I mean I'm not quite understanding the first thing you said
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:07.400]  about extermination the plan of the New World Order is basically breaking it
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:10.920]  all down as containment for extermination they want to mean everything
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:19.200]  then they want to exterminate okay God brings life darkness brings death and
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:24.120]  these people are like devil worship or extremists they're you know like the
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:27.720]  skull and bones they're into death that's what they called the brotherhood of
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:33.400]  death okay and the skull and bones are more than you think and more than the
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:39.520]  Yale they had like sub chapters in China and Russia no I know that it's a
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:45.000]  chapter of the Illuminati it's a it's chapter 3 2 2 but it was the first big
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:50.160]  mothership out of the German Bavarian Illuminati set up in 1832 by the Russell
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:56.280]  Trust with public opium monopoly money yeah there's nothing to prior to the
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:01.160]  18th century both the Masons and the Catholic Church were against the New
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:04.800]  World Order they infiltrated the Catholic Church in the Masons during the 18th
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:10.240]  century in the early 19th century you know that right well I mean it's it's all
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:15.680]  open for debate well it's on YouTube there's history about okay it's on YouTube
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:20.160]  it must be true well I mean there's there's things out there okay talking
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:23.000]  about that during the 18th century they infiltrated the Catholic Church in the
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:28.040]  Masons and they wanted to make the Freemasons into Illuminati nations you
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:32.040]  know that's George Washington's letters that are in the National Archives you can
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:36.280]  pull them up they have those all scanned in written in his own hand on record his
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:44.280]  letters yeah so anyways the next point I wanted to bring up is that I believe
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:49.920]  the things have changed in 2006 destiny changed because the fact is that I think
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:55.880]  the original plan Mike contentioned the original plan was that Bush was forced
[02:11:55.880 --> 02:12:00.400]  to attack Afghanistan Iraq into a front to from objective on Iran Iran was the
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:06.200]  trigger okay and what happened was he failed to do that and how we know he
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:10.680]  failed to do that maybe do you believe that movies have communicate things to
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:14.720]  the public well a lot of movies are put out by people I know but they're
[02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:19.920]  generally more independent smaller films but even with some big actors you
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:23.880]  know they have Illuminati stuff in it like scanner darkly the Rick look later
[02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:27.560]  put out that I'm in with Keanu Reeves went on a rider and Woody Harrelson and
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:31.000]  others and who's the actor I've met him a couple times and though I'm shooting a
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.560]  film we'll hung out with him but then no no who's I hung out with all the other
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:38.840]  folks a lot but I didn't really hang out with him much who's the guy that plays
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:42.760]  Iron Man yeah Robert Downey Jr. I was great actor I was for get his name for
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:45.760]  some reason because I always end up calling you Morton Downey Jr. that's
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:52.480]  all you know the the talk show guy but you know that film they've got Illuminati
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:55.920]  symbolism everywhere because it's in Philip K. Dick's book and the message is
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:00.360]  the Illuminati the secret corporation is drugging you to burn out your brain to
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:05.480]  make you a slave zombie and they sit there and I even I also consulted on the
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:10.760]  film I didn't just you know I wasn't just in it it's overtly Illuminati and
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:15.360]  it's exposing it but then you've got big-budget things where it's pro
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:21.440]  Illuminati so everything in films is not programming but obviously on Fox
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:25.920]  television on the lone gunman spinoff of X files where the government hijacks a
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:30.600]  jumbo jet to fly into the World Trade Center as a pretext to attack Afghanistan
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:36.040]  and uses a terrorism drill as a pretext to claim hijackers are on board when
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:40.760]  it's really remote controlled that's exactly what they did six months later
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:45.120]  and then Dean Haglin the star of the show came to my house and said the CIA
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:50.400]  approached them and had implanted those those plots on them so yeah when you got
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:55.280]  something like that it is a hundred percent pre-programming to prepare the
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:59.440]  subconscious mind but also to have like a public bragging rights because the
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:03.120]  Illuminati is into magic whether it's real or not they believe the lesser
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:07.080]  magic if they brag about it up front and let you know they're gonna do it
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:11.400]  somehow even if it's deceptively done it gives them more power when they do the
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:16.640]  big act but you got 30 seconds finish up okay the next point is at the end of
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:20.880]  the movie W and the Oval Office where Bush senior comes in the talk to George
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:27.440]  W. Bush Jr. and Bush senior talk says that Bush Jr. two or years down the drain
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:32.040]  based on paraphrasing in other words he's saying that the message was that
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:35.400]  Bush Jr. screwed up by not attacking Iran during 2006 to start to dig to the
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:39.440]  Holocaust three three and a half billion people are still alive and they think
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:42.080]  they pissed off darkness so they're trying to put the destruction of the plan
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:47.360]  on the fast track that's my point now I agree with you they want to that's why
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:51.760]  Cheney tried to start World War three with the Russians with the attack on
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:54.960]  South Ossetia these people are they're putting al-Qaeda in everywhere and it's
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:58.520]  just like give your rights up al-Qaeda but al-Qaeda is good and it's just like
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:04.240]  al-Qaeda al-Qaeda it's like Woody Woodpecker it's just totally insane in
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:08.080]  the contradiction that's there Jason in mass you're on the air thanks for
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:12.520]  holding hey thanks Alex I just wanted to let you know that you know you really
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:16.600]  helped me unplug from the matrix and you know now that I'm awake I'm looking
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:20.440]  looking at all your documentaries and everything and just seeing what's going
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:27.360]  on out there and my point was is that you know when the president or whoever
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:32.140]  executes the martial law you know I think one thing I mean we need everyone to
[02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:37.080]  awaken but it's more for the fact that we need police and the military to
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:40.920]  awaken because I mean these are the guys who you know if there is ever a
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:44.320]  revolution or what's going on these are gonna be the guys that we're gonna go
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:49.840]  again and you know it's up to the families and everyone else to really
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:53.960]  get into these guys heads and let them know what's going on I mean they're
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:57.160]  attacking our own choke soldiers you know well that's why they're doing all
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:01.320]  this fake community policing where they get to know you and are real friendly
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:04.800]  but put handcuffs on you for no reason so when they come get you you don't
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:09.360]  resist and and that's why they want to get everybody arrested for no
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:13.440]  seatbelts and stuff now the police have been told they have quotas so that you're
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:16.960]  in the system they want you to be used to go into jail even though you're not a
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:23.080]  criminal to get you primed we want to stop that we want to circumvent that
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:28.120]  and head that off now but you're right one of our main focuses is to try to
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:30.840]  wake up military police and because they're in the middle of it they're
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:34.800]  some of the easiest to wake up I found who you who's hard to wake up is a
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:39.560]  soccer mom who believes in the system or some mainline yuppie worker who thinks
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:43.560]  they're part of the establishment and thinks anybody that cares is weak and
[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:48.240]  that you know it's cute and fun to not care and only being of themselves they
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:54.320]  are hard to get to or if a republicans in then people get partisan and oh you
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:59.800]  know the agenda can't be bad my guys in we win or if it's democrats oh Obama's
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:04.080]  in come on he you know he's their guy he's not bad you know that partisanship
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:09.960]  but that's not working anymore and again they're not going to call it martial
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:13.600]  law they're gonna call it civil emergency and and so they're already
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:18.840]  rolling out a type of martial law we're already in the pot it's bubbling it's
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:23.680]  just not boiling completely throughout yet and so they're but they're excited
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:27.280]  I mean have you noticed they're accelerating at all now yeah I mean
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:30.080]  especially around like you know you're on your area about you know all the
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:33.680]  tanks rolling out in St. Louis and you know seeing them implement all these
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:38.040]  you know these strategic areas you know and it's just you know it's one of those
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:41.160]  things where you know I mean these guys really need to wake up I mean they go
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:45.000]  you know these guys that they're saying that they're working for I mean these
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.760]  guys the families and everything are exposed to eugenics they're exposed to
[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:52.320]  all this stuff too oh yeah the bankers are gonna take everything they've got
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:56.440]  again police and bureaucrats and people that were incorporate people that work
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:00.280]  in the system which is like half the public or more you gotta understand the
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:04.240]  globalist plan to shut things down in phases you're not on the winning team
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:08.840]  they wouldn't let you on their team you're nothing but a schmuck a dupe a
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:13.920]  sucker to them Henry Kissinger quoted Bob Woodward he said the military are
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:19.960]  dumb animals cannon fodder that we use and he was quoted by others saying
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:24.080]  similar things so they'll have parades and tell you they care about you they
[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:28.960]  think you're dumb animals so I'm gonna tell you this right now I'm street smart
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:35.080]  I've got a decent intelligence but I'm not some super genius I'm smart and I
[02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:38.680]  didn't decide to join evil because I realized it's a con game because I
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:44.040]  could I couldn't even really join evil because it's a scam it's a con plus I
[02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:49.120]  don't want to join evil and my instincts my gut my spirit burns with
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:54.720]  energy and desire to crush these people it so I can't even control myself my
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:19:00.600]  my bones I think they say an Ezekiel burn isn't an Ezekiel in the Bible I
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:04.000]  compare myself to a prophet but it's a similar feeling he's saying look God you
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.240]  got me doing all this they said they're gonna kill me but I can't shut up can
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:10.920]  you make me shut up I they said they're gonna kill me but I can't shut up I
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:14.960]  can't shut up and you know what it's that feeling it's not oh I've got courage
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:19.880]  that I'm gonna go fight evil folks what's gonna win this is not being able to
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:24.400]  control yourself not being able to help going out and taking action thank you for

[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:47.320]  year welcome hello Alex hey buddy hear me yes sir hey how you doing just three
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:51.400]  things you're always talking about co-op you know how the globalists like the
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:59.920]  co-op for instance say the Occupy movement globalist co-opted yes okay
[02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:05.200]  well why not why not co-op the globalist movement of one world
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:10.320]  government and say yeah we want it but we wanted implemented under the American
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:15.440]  Constitution well that's what Lord Monkton has said just as a point of
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:18.440]  debate because they're not gonna ever do that go oh well you're now admitting
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:22.080]  you're world government and it's authoritarian and the EU elects
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:26.240]  parliament's but they have no authority the bureaucracy does run by big banks
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:30.920]  and you brag your dictators you see it's not even so much arrogance they've got
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:34.240]  to admit it now because we've exposed it but but they're like well we're the
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:39.720]  experts oh really okay well how about we let nations vote if they want to be
[02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:45.240]  part of this and they're like oh no no no can't do that so yeah I mean you got
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:49.920]  to be careful anything global is so far away it's gonna become far reaching the
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:55.240]  far away imperial seat I'm I don't think we'll ever have global government and I
[02:25:55.240 --> 02:26:00.840]  think you could have an alliance of free nations with a sacred code of liberty
[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:06.600]  freedom private property family anti eugenics education on monetary issues
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:10.800]  and that would be the society that went to the stars but we don't have an
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:14.280]  alliance of the good countries the truth is the bankers started taking over
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:17.960]  about a hundred years ago all over the world they already had England and
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:23.360]  Europe to great extent before that for over 200 years and they would actually
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:28.200]  go set up the enemy not not not controlling them but set them up and
[02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:34.360]  fund them through subsidiaries to then knock them down I mean that's smart they
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:40.680]  play the part of the savior but actually create the threat and and of course
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:45.000]  they write books about that Carol Quigley's written books others have so
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:48.360]  it's all right there how they operate I mean look at how what do you think of
[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:52.680]  them publicly giving Libya and now parts of Syria to Al Qaeda to slaughter
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:56.760]  Christians and Jews and it's in the newspapers but it's kind of like well
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:02.760]  that's just what happens well it's outrageous and you know all my neighbors
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:06.480]  you had bring it up and you know they just they don't say a word they don't

[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:48.440]  promoting it yet because it's been beta but it's starting to work really well
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:53.200]  had a few bugs there's a ton of folks in Illinois go search the Illinois groups
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:58.880]  in there and get involved just start it go do an access show go get a local
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:04.160]  radio show it's easier than you think take action let's talk to another caller
[02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:13.680]  here who's up next Ricardo and New Yorker on the air welcome hi Alex thanks
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:19.160]  for taking my call thank you I have I have two quick things I'd like to say
[02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:27.320]  first about the stop ticketer obama contest I think the campaign I think
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:32.120]  this campaign is really good but I don't think it's enough because like you
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:37.480]  know people are gonna some people are just gonna see those posters and vote for
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:42.760]  Romney so I was thinking after after this campaign is over we shouldn't you
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:50.240]  know watch one against Romney well Romney is not the president yet I didn't
[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:55.880]  launch one against Obama because he wasn't in office yet but if Romney gets
[02:28:55.880 --> 02:29:00.120]  in and starts trying to restrict the Second Amendment or he's agreeing with
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:04.600]  Obama on legalizing illegals I saw that or things like that we probably will
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:11.120]  mainly Obama is trying to go after the guns right now Obama is the front man
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:16.160]  saying we're under UN command the military and so he's the guy with the
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:20.560]  power he's got the Justice Department he's who's dangerous he's who it's it's
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:24.840]  dangerous to go up against and so he's the big dog he's the big front man stay
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:28.680]  there I'm gonna come back and explain more of this to you it's about getting
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:33.120]  people out on the streets I said it could be whatever poster you want as long
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:40.440]  as it's exposing Obama and his crimes but I mean I cut my teeth exposing
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:46.960]  Clinton then Bush now Obama I mean they're all puppets I've talked about it at

[02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:42.240]  okay Ricardo in New York and I'm gonna go into big news blitz then back into
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:51.760]  your calls he was asking if the Obama dictator contest is the best idea well
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:57.120]  you heard how that started last Monday on air not this Monday but last Monday
[02:33:57.120 --> 02:34:03.120]  like nine days ago Obama was announcing that he would just make the illegal
[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:06.600]  aliens legal he's now announcing that they won't have eyes pick up illegal
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:12.480]  aliens when they even commit felonies in Arizona he's got the UN giving orders
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:19.240]  and NATO giving orders to Congress and he's the supposed president who's now
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:24.480]  become this trader-in-chief and so I said that's it we need to put out
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:29.400]  provocative signs and I didn't see some newscast well I saw some of the videos
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:33.840]  sent in where it showed news cameras there but I never saw those news reports
[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:37.760]  so people should send those in now we're into phase two I said you got four days
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:45.880]  till Friday post the signs and legal awful areas make your own poster or use
[02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:51.480]  our posters that we've made Obama dictator to get people thinking about
[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:55.200]  this because they understand a president being a dictator because that's how he's
[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:58.200]  acting that's how he's behaving they don't understand things like the private
[02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:03.880]  fellow reserve and the plan is to get enough of these up to get media coverage
[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:07.520]  of it because they did this with the Obama posters it was in well over a
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:12.520]  hundred newspapers a whole bunch of TV stations it was on news in Ireland Japan
[02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:22.680]  Norway all these different places this news came out hey guys I just forgot to
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:25.280]  do it during the break because I've got my children at work with me today I hate
[02:35:25.280 --> 02:35:29.160]  to honey-do everybody here but can I have a pollen burst please with a full
[02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:33.640]  glass of water thank you I plus I got a bunch of work and I need my afternoon
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:37.800]  caffeine thank you oh there you are thank you I tell you what awesome I've got
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:40.240]  them I just need water in here because what's gonna happen is I'll never have
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:43.000]  time to get out there and get it I'm starting to cough thank you by the
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.360]  third hour sometimes I just get busy during the breaks and talking to my
[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:50.360]  children or running around out there and didn't go get my water I'm gonna put a
[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:54.400]  little water cooler I'm serious right over here on those little floor units
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:58.080]  like a little bench I can just get all the water I want that are running you
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:03.880]  guys ragged once a day to hit me some water he lies a big sarcastic um he's
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:08.840]  isn't like a Tabasco event I had a few days ago and sure we probably could have
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:12.880]  thought of a better thing but it's pretty darn good I mean what do you have
[02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:18.240]  like Romney and Obama's faces split and then just say the two parties are a
[02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:23.880]  dictatorship or something people already know that I mean we've had programs
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:28.920]  where we put up during flu season when that hoax was going that that it was all
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:37.720]  a giant hoax and that hey honey you're distracting me in the control room I
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:41.400]  told you you can come to work but you can't come running around the office
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:46.400]  like that it's the summer my children are home school they're very good but
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:50.440]  they're very excited at work and what my oldest daughter is running around out
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:54.160]  there and I mean it's distracting when she comes in for putting her face up on
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:59.960]  the glass there thank you so much guys by the way this is this is a product
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:02.920]  placement I didn't do the product placement on purpose but I might as well
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:07.080]  pollen burst is the best energy drink I've ever had full of B vitamins trace
[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:11.560]  minerals and then a little bit of caffeine and I get so much more energy
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:15.760]  instead of having afternoon coffee now they said like five six cups a day now
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:20.320]  I just have a cup in the morning maybe a cup when I get to the office and then
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:23.880]  it's pollen burst and if I got to work till like midnight or do coast to coast
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:32.360]  AM or something I'll have like a 9 p.m. pollen burst that hits the spot thank

[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:06.280]  want to sit here and over elaborate I got a bunch of news here to go to in your
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:17.040]  calls to answer his question Ricardo in New York but I guess I could have a week
[02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:21.320]  where we say what's your idea for a contest all I know is this worked really
[02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:24.240]  well last time because the media comes out and says there shouldn't be a first
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:27.280]  amendment you shouldn't talk about Obama and then other people say well I'm
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:32.160]  gonna post signs and it was really a big deal and had a big effect I don't know I
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:36.800]  mean we we had Google bombs for a year and could make the number one search
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:40.240]  term whenever we want until they change the algorithm to block that that that
[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:44.040]  tool it and we're still in the top Google search is just organically
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:48.960]  sometimes but you know they've blocked us being able to do that I mean you've
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:53.000]  got all the power people say well I wish we could get together I wish we could
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:58.120]  do more you're going to have to do it I mean planet info wars calm get organized
[02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:03.960]  there create your I mean we have an area for activism where you give us ideas and
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:11.240]  ideas to each other and do that there it is resistance activism it's all right
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:15.680]  there there's whole areas but Ricardo what are your ideas I mean what's
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:26.160]  effective here well I don't know I really agree with what you're saying
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:33.800]  it's just that was some like some constructive you know you know I hear
[02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:38.480]  you I hear you buddy I just want to have you you know because you I am wanted to
[02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:42.600]  be able to have you have a response there because remember I can't magically do
[02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:48.880]  everything I can come up with certain ideas I can get certain things done but
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:54.720]  I'm not all powerful okay let's go to another caller and then I'll get to the
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:40:00.720]  news Richard in New York you're on the air hi Alex this is part of the clergy
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:06.680]  unresponse team I told you about the Harriman ritual room throne room up at
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:13.240]  the Harriman estate compound but I'd like to tie in something about the Tom
[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:19.240]  Cruz film about the eyes wide shut we're absolutely up against real-life
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:26.000]  Satanists but in that movie is a clue to the Harriman complex when Tom Cruz buys
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:34.760]  a cape and a mask from a costume shop there's a little I worked in the movie
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:42.120]  industry and in also with a news show that has a stopwatch in it on Sunday
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:49.720]  nights but when Tom Cruz buys that costume there's a little neon sign that
[02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:57.840]  says rainbow now the guy that has the satanic ritual ceremony owns that
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:03.640]  company now I believe it was Shawn Stone that said seven months ago that he
[02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:09.880]  believed when Tom Cruz is headed across the bridge he's going to nyak New York I
[02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:13.760]  know well let me tell you Shawn Stones one to know I'm just gonna leave it at
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:19.840]  that I mean let me tell you let me let me I tell you what Shawn Stone I wish
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:24.400]  he'd tell you everything he's seen do you imagine what that what he's seen well
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:29.200]  I'm gonna give you a little hint that the Harriman I know that area like the
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:34.640]  back of my hand and we've got our people all over that place and there's no way
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:38.720]  that that kind of ceremony could have taken place in nyak without us knowing
[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:46.600]  about it but a postman a long time ago from the Tuxedo Park Harriman area told
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:52.320]  me and I had no idea what he was talking about at the time that that area was
[02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:58.760]  known as end of the rainbow now one of our guys hopped over the fence and got
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:03.520]  inside of the Harriman complex and I described part of that to you you could
[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:11.640]  easily produce that inside of that area and no one would know now I'm gonna tie
[02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:15.840]  in something else about Warren Bodecker and the theft of Warren Bodecker's
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:20.960]  stuff we know that the New World Order globalists want to remove the property
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:24.960]  from the middle class and destroy the middle class and give the property to
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:29.480]  the elites I believe that mr. Warren Bodecker stuff they're gonna find out
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:36.080]  that the judge probably has hidden real estate off of his financial forms and
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:41.040]  ethics forms etc now this got my partner murdered in New York Sonny's shoe he's
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:46.040]  got a blog spot that people can go to on the net the guy that's produced that is
[02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:50.320]  not telling the entire truth well listen here's the deal you got to send me some
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:53.920]  info on that it's too convoluted sir I don't know about that case out in
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:58.000]  Montana I'm just trying to help a world war two hero veteran who's losing his
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:04.160]  house you know for all I know the trustee is a nice person and and you know
[02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:07.760]  he got set up by some people that brought him to the trustee but the whole
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:12.640]  point is well what happened there is wrong and we're investigating it no no
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:18.280]  I hear you but I appreciate your call I appreciate your call we're now gonna go
[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:21.960]  ahead and take one more call and then I'm going to get into the news here okay
[02:43:21.960 --> 02:43:28.520]  let's go ahead and talk to Brian in California you're on the air hi Alex
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:36.040]  John I wanted to say that Obama declared martial law a month ago under
[02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:39.400]  executive order blocking prosperity of persons threatening the peace security
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:42.920]  or stability of Yemen the second paragraph it says I hereby declare a
[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:48.080]  national emergency well they do that every year we've always since 1933 in
[02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:52.280]  the War Powers Act been under martial law that's why I try to explain it's but
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:56.880]  a physical martial law is being slowly incrementally turned up that's why the
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:00.760]  sergeant of arms gets a visit from the White House every year it's on C-span
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:03.920]  they say we're here with a letter from the president and then they declare the
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:09.880]  emergency and then that's how the TSA sticks their hands down your pants it's
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:14.360]  how the national security state does all this so yes I remember covering that and
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:19.360]  every year he issues a new emergency I mean this is what we live under is
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:25.640]  emergency rule COG rule yes I think Ron Paul knew about it and that's why he
[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:29.320]  stepped down when he did because it was about the same day that this came out
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:34.400]  that he stepped down well let me just expand on that sir did you hear what I
[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:41.120]  said since the War Powers Act 1933 they declared a national emergency and we
[02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:44.840]  never left it that's how he could order and I say it's the illegal order because
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:49.280]  it's fraud everyone turned their gold in and they gave him paperback and then
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:54.120]  basically doubled the price of the gold the next few years the Firestone family
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:58.760]  got caught setting up dummy corporations in Europe to buy their gold back
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:05.640]  Roosevelt declared martial law under the reorganization Emergency Powers Act of
[02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:12.920]  1933 and so Ron Paul stepped down because Ron Paul wasn't going to win the
[02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:18.440]  election and I like Ron Paul I like Rand Paul they're good guys overall I don't
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:22.420]  like seeing them go into more of a political mode when they were always the
[02:45:22.420 --> 02:45:25.800]  purist it's not that I get mad if someone's political overall if they've
[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:33.040]  always been political and I appreciate your call sir my issue was that I
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:37.120]  watched the letters going out to constituents and out to myself because
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:41.560]  I've given them both money and it's like we're still gonna win get in there get
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:45.400]  the delegates and I'm like but then Rand comes on my show and says yeah well
[02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:49.960]  now it's gonna be Romney and it is an honor to be considered for VP remember a
[02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:55.480]  few months ago and I'm like hmm okay I'm being polite and then it's like keep
[02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:59.400]  everybody going along going along going along and then get right to the point and
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:03.240]  say okay well remember Paul made that announcement that he was longer in a
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:05.880]  campaign in states they went but that doesn't really mean we're dropping out
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:10.560]  that was kind of like oh I mean it was just he was like a double double talk
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:14.920]  stuff and I understand Ron Paul got run ragged Ron Paul did thousands of stops
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:22.200]  Ron Paul's got mainline Republican politicos running his operation now and
[02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:27.480]  that's great okay I just don't have to be all hot and bothered politically about
[02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:32.840]  the polls anymore I that's great I agree with most their votes I even understand
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:36.880]  why Ram came out against GMO labeling because I get he's always said the feds
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:42.080]  he wants to get rid of the FDA notice they so push all this poison on us
[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:46.520]  special interest control he says let the states do it and we should do it in the
[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:51.960]  states and he's voted to not let the feds block states having labeling now you
[02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:56.240]  can debate that and say well GMO is so bad we deserve a right to know and while
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:47:00.800]  we're going to have an FDA they might as well demand labeling I see that I mean
[02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:05.600]  I understand the thought process though of a libertarian purist to say don't let
[02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:09.400]  the feds label it but instead the big companies are lobbying to not have
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:15.160]  states not label it so I don't have any ill will towards Ron Paul or towards
[02:47:15.160 --> 02:47:18.440]  Ron Paul I just know the direction they're going and I told you the
[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:21.720]  direction they were going and I you see their statements by their people that
[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:25.720]  speak for him you know Jack Hunter and people who just says well we want
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:29.440]  Republicans to like us and we want to we want to we want to be liked and we
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:34.360]  want to get mainline Republican support well great hell support NDA a support
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:40.520]  endless war support torture support more prisons support the drug war if you
[02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:44.320]  want to make you know the so-called mainline Republicans like you okay
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:50.120]  great I just don't have to get into a worship fest over it I'm not interested
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:54.600]  in having them on my radio show anymore it's gone I mean that I guess if they
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:57.600]  contacted us which they have before to get on I go okay and I'll ask them a
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:48:00.720]  few questions and I'd try to be positive say hey you're doing this you're doing
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:05.680]  that ran Paul's doing a lot of good stuff going after the TSA you know going
[02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:14.600]  after a lot of things but the magic's gone the magic's gone and so that's
[02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:19.400]  great that's good and I hope of a little political analysts they've got
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:23.680]  working for them have a great wedding with the GOP I hope it's it's great and
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:29.920]  they can all wear nice little white rides made the gowns up there I'm not
[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:35.960]  going to the party okay so that's all I have to say about that I mean I don't
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:38.480]  even want to get into Ron Paul like I hope people just don't even don't even
[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:44.240]  bring it up okay because I'm glad I did what I did kind of going going wild a
[02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:48.960]  few weeks ago because it was real it was me it's who I am because it's personal
[02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:54.400]  when things like that happen but you know I mean I'm glad I did what I did
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:59.840]  because it was real but I you know the duality I wish I wouldn't have gotten so
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:08.400]  angry because it's just what do you expect you know I realize I am a
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:15.800]  weirdo I mean I try to not compromise I I you can't compromise with pure evil and
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:21.120]  I understand why people do and that's fine I think it's a big mistake it's
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:29.240]  more of a sadness it's more of a sadness and but it shouldn't get any of us down
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:35.040]  Ron Paul's retiring and Rand Paul is still a great senator when it comes to
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:39.840]  the Second Amendment and a lot of issues and so that's great it's just that we
[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:45.400]  get mad and angry because it was so pure and then it gives others that
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:48.840]  exaggerate and make stuff up about him excuses I've looked into some of the
[02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:53.080]  stuff being said you know like governor walkers related to the Walker family I
[02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:59.620]  looked it up that's not true or you know Ron Paul is a mason who wants us all to
[02:49:59.620 --> 02:50:04.800]  use drugs I mean it's just pure baloney and and you know people then oh look
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:08.560]  how bad Ron Paul is you know he's works for GMO companies he doesn't want you
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:11.880]  to be able to label it that's not why he did it he says the feds don't have that
[02:50:11.880 --> 02:50:17.200]  jurisdiction get rid of it and here it is I've got all this news I'm gonna come
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:22.680]  back and hit Biden it's a depression for millions and millions of Americans
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:27.000]  BuzzFeed has that video well Biden occasionally tells the truth and then
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.040]  I've got what I mentioned you last week as it dovetails with all this Larry
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:34.240]  Summers Washington Post avoiding a global catastrophe and then it says big

[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:53.720]  bankrupt stocked in the fall for bankruptcy again you can keep bailing it
[02:50:53.720 --> 02:50:57.360]  out the money never goes to bail it out the tickets the cops right don't go to

[02:54:10.960 --> 02:54:15.560]  remember they told us three years ago that there was a session in it though even
[02:54:15.560 --> 02:54:20.200]  with the cook economic numbers it showed we've been at a depression and as the
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:23.920]  depression gets deeper well now Biden comes out and says it's a depression for
[02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:27.120]  millions and millions of Americans and now as they start hinting they're
[02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:31.560]  gonna do QE3 soon well look for gold to go up when they actually do that they've
[02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:37.120]  been trying to hammer it down because it exposes the fiat currency it is going
[02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:46.560]  to just exacerbate everything and people on fixed incomes are going to really see
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:50.400]  their purchasing power shrunk now again I mentioned this last week but it
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:55.480]  dovetails with this other news avoiding a global catastrophe Lawrence
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:59.020]  Summers this is the guy more than anybody who helped engineer they in a
[02:54:59.020 --> 02:55:05.400]  glass teagle the derivatives the housing bubble everything with Clinton and he
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:11.560]  goes on to admit that raising taxes stalls the economy but that they've got
