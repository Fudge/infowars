[00:40.800 --> 00:44.320]  Pernas repeating in an interview what he had told his attorney three years ago
[00:44.320 --> 00:47.720]  while still being held by the u.s. that when he was originally picked up and
[00:47.720 --> 00:52.240]  stored in Afghanistan for two months interrogators hung him by his arms from
[00:52.240 --> 00:56.360]  a ceiling of a freezing aircraft hangar for five days with doctors coming by
[00:56.360 --> 00:59.960]  periodically to assure his captors it was okay to keep on hanging him there
[00:59.960 --> 01:04.280]  Pernas says his interrogators demanded he admit he was an operative of and
[01:04.280 --> 01:09.280]  associate of Muhammad Ata the 9-11 plotter the torture assembly is old
[01:09.280 --> 01:15.560]  news the new news is Kernes was from Germany so remember the attempt to link
[01:15.560 --> 01:19.760]  9-11 to Iraq by way of Muhammad Ata and some apocryphal meeting he was supposed
[01:19.760 --> 01:24.760]  to have had with the Iraqi intelligence service in Prague April 2001 I'll get
[01:24.760 --> 01:29.880]  some German-born Muslim to admit he knew Ata and you're halfway home to putting
[01:29.880 --> 01:34.520]  Ata at a meeting with Iraqi agents even if it never happened number two mortgage

[01:51.360 --> 01:56.880]  number one New Casey said what gate almost ignored in the coverage of his
[01:56.880 --> 02:00.640]  speech to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco pleading for telecom immunity
[02:00.640 --> 02:05.600]  Attorney General Michael Mukasey also said quote before 9-11 that's the call
[02:05.600 --> 02:09.120]  that we didn't know about we knew that there has been a call from some place
[02:09.120 --> 02:13.320]  that was known to be a safe house in Afghanistan and we knew that it came to
[02:13.320 --> 02:18.560]  the United States we didn't know precisely where it went what the
[02:18.560 --> 02:22.720]  government knew about some phone call from a safe house in Afghanistan into the
[02:22.720 --> 02:28.840]  U.S. about 9-11 before 9-11 and even though it had the same FISA courts and
[02:28.840 --> 02:32.680]  the same right to act against international targets in 2001 as it does
[02:32.680 --> 02:37.360]  now you didn't do anything about it well this would seem to leave only two
[02:37.360 --> 02:40.480]  options either the Attorney General just admitted that the government for which
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.800]  he works is guilty of malfeasant complicity in the 9-11 attacks or he's
[02:44.800 --> 02:50.120]  lying I'm betting on lying if not somebody in Congress better put that man

[09:34.320 --> 09:38.160]  guests lined up for you today and a big surprise guest by the way early in the
[09:38.160 --> 09:43.360]  show tomorrow I'm just gonna let you know that and also next Monday huge
[09:43.360 --> 09:49.000]  announcement biggest announcement in the history of this radio show in the
[09:49.000 --> 09:57.520]  history of what I've been doing on talk radio period coming up next Monday
[09:57.520 --> 10:05.360]  starting in the second hour of the show I will make the announcement USA 2008 the
[10:05.360 --> 10:11.960]  Great Depression food stamps are the symbol of poverty in the US in the
[10:11.960 --> 10:17.720]  era of credit crunch a record 28 million Americans are now relying on them to
[10:17.720 --> 10:25.040]  survive a sure sign that the world's richest country faces economic crises we
[10:25.040 --> 10:30.680]  knew things were bad on Wall Street but on Main Street it may be worse startling
[10:30.680 --> 10:36.080]  official statistics show that as a new economic recession stocks the United
[10:36.080 --> 10:41.520]  States a record number of Americans will shortly be depending on food stamps
[10:41.520 --> 10:47.560]  just to feed themselves and their families dismal projections by the
[10:47.560 --> 10:51.120]  Congressional Budget Office in Washington suggest in the fiscal year
[10:51.120 --> 10:57.160]  starting October 28 28 million people in the US will be using government food
[10:57.160 --> 11:01.560]  stamps to buy essential groceries the highest level since the food assistance
[11:01.560 --> 11:08.840]  program was introduced in the 1960s the increase from 26.5 million in 2007 is
[11:08.840 --> 11:13.440]  due partly to recent efforts to increase public awareness of the program and
[11:13.440 --> 11:20.480]  also to switch from paper coupons to electronic debit cards but also above
[11:20.480 --> 11:24.800]  all it is the pressures being exerted on ordinary Americans by an economy that
[11:24.800 --> 11:30.400]  is suddenly beset by troubles housing foreclosures accelerating job losses and
[11:30.400 --> 11:40.080]  fast-rising prices all add to the squeeze meanwhile this is the
[11:40.080 --> 11:48.280]  Associated Press today analysts predicts corn rationing in 2008 a BB&T
[11:48.280 --> 11:53.520]  capital markets analysts said Monday corn rationing may be necessary this year
[11:53.520 --> 11:56.840]  it's already happening with wheat following a US Department of Agriculture
[11:56.840 --> 12:04.320]  reporting predicting farmers would plant fewer far fewer acres of corn in 2008
[12:04.320 --> 12:10.560]  yeah that makes a lot of sense corns at all time high the demand is just get
[12:10.560 --> 12:16.400]  absolutely stratospheric and let's cut back on what we're growing according to
[12:16.400 --> 12:22.000]  the March perspective planting reports farmers intend to plant about 86 million
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.800]  acres of corn this year down 8% from 2007 when the amount of corn planted was
[12:27.800 --> 12:34.280]  the highest since World War two that goes on to what how the investors are
[12:34.280 --> 12:40.960]  betting now remember you don't really see the corn rationing at the store it's
[12:40.960 --> 12:46.280]  rationing to the factories that make the cereals and make the breads and the
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.920]  thousands of prepared foods that have it as fillers in it and so you will see it
[12:51.920 --> 12:57.200]  manifested by higher prices and yes sometimes you'll just go in if it's
[12:57.200 --> 13:00.760]  later in the evening and there won't be bread on the shelves or your favorite
[13:00.760 --> 13:05.560]  bread won't be there I mean some people are hyping this saying you know there'll
[13:05.560 --> 13:08.920]  be absolute food shortages you won't be able to get food I don't agree with that
[13:08.920 --> 13:15.480]  it's just you're gonna pay a lot more for food there's not gonna really be any
[13:15.480 --> 13:26.560]  fuel rationing it's just that it's gonna be a lot more to buy your gas and as the
[13:26.560 --> 13:32.640]  hyperinflation sets in in the next 24 months increasingly getting worse every
[13:32.640 --> 13:36.960]  month it's gonna bankrupt a lot of people I mean there are a lot of people
[13:36.960 --> 13:43.360]  living hand-to-mouth a lot of people making $8-9 an hour in this country some
[13:43.360 --> 13:52.120]  people make it even less and you cannot live on that unless you are living in a
[13:52.120 --> 13:59.120]  communal house 1015 to a house like the illegal aliens are and I'm not knocking
[13:59.120 --> 14:02.920]  them and saying they're bad people they're desperately fleeing Mexico
[14:02.920 --> 14:10.400]  incredibly tyrannical starvation riots tyranny the richest elite per capita on
[14:10.400 --> 14:15.560]  the planet feeding off the 99% below them but they do hurt this nation they
[14:15.560 --> 14:19.960]  come here and they drive down wages but I'm already digressing you're gonna have
[14:19.960 --> 14:25.080]  the 30 plus million illegal aliens Mexico in a big recession pushing more of
[14:25.080 --> 14:30.160]  them up here driving it down even deeper getting all the free health care that
[14:30.160 --> 14:36.080]  the hospitals give oh did you know hospitals from LA to Dallas Texas have
[14:36.080 --> 14:39.440]  been instructed for decades to give free health care to illegal aliens that's
[14:39.440 --> 14:42.960]  what's bankrupting them in the schools and everything else all of this
[14:42.960 --> 14:47.280]  compounding and hundreds of unfunded federal mandates on the states ordering
[14:47.280 --> 14:51.280]  the states do this ordering the states to do that
[14:53.560 --> 14:58.880]  50-something million people on social security and that number growing growing
[14:58.880 --> 15:05.480]  every day it'll be 60 million by the end of the decade all of it compacting
[15:05.480 --> 15:10.760]  that's right 60 million on social security 10 million more in just two years
[15:10.760 --> 15:15.080]  and their checks had its value cut in half the last four years just with the
[15:15.080 --> 15:21.400]  inflation we had before now it's accelerating now it's deepening the
[15:21.400 --> 15:26.440]  inflation is getting worse compounded per year you add that into the equation
[15:26.440 --> 15:32.680]  you add a world recession that's beginning and I got new stack to the
[15:32.680 --> 15:36.720]  rafters and I'm not even I'm looking at article number one here London
[15:36.720 --> 15:46.080]  independent bread milk eggs prices spiked draining locals wallets China's stocks
[15:46.080 --> 15:51.640]  tumbled 4.1 percent to new 11 month low Reuters China's main stock index tumbled
[15:51.640 --> 15:58.560]  4.13 percent to a new 11 month closing low today after a central bank repeated
[15:58.560 --> 16:04.960]  its commitment to tight monetary policy so we're seeing restrictions and credit
[16:04.960 --> 16:08.080]  the same thing in the Europe same thing in the US now let's explain what's
[16:08.080 --> 16:13.880]  happening the big central banks and the private banks they own are being given
[16:13.880 --> 16:23.840]  unlimited liquidity unlimited funds over 200 billion dollars a month and we're
[16:23.840 --> 16:32.600]  now eight months into this it's trillions and that's just government and
[16:32.600 --> 16:38.960]  sovereign wealth funds pumping that in there the companies are taking the
[16:38.960 --> 16:43.040]  pension funds that were left they were already fully leveraged but just taking
[16:43.040 --> 16:49.040]  the scraps trying to prop things up full bailouts of the fortune 100 banks and
[16:49.040 --> 16:54.960]  brokerage firms who'd bought into real companies and have now infected those
[16:54.960 --> 17:02.480]  bought into real commodities holders bought into manufacturing bought into
[17:02.480 --> 17:11.360]  military bought into entertainment communications mining the leveraging is
[17:11.360 --> 17:18.920]  in the billions to one it just it's total la la land it's not even real it
[17:18.920 --> 17:25.200]  it's just total fantasy unlimited liquidity for all of them with you the
[17:25.200 --> 17:29.320]  taxpayer that's going to fit the bill not just paying in taxes to pay it off but
[17:29.320 --> 17:34.080]  also in the destruction of your dollar
[17:37.200 --> 17:44.200]  meanwhile US ambassador says NAFTA no matter what the North American Free Trade
[17:44.200 --> 17:48.280]  Agreement will stand regardless of who wins the coming presidential election
[17:48.280 --> 17:51.720]  south of the border the United States ambassador to Canada said Monday David
[17:51.720 --> 17:56.720]  Wilkins told the trade group in Canada that NAFTA survival does not depend on
[17:56.720 --> 18:00.680]  whether Democrats or Republicans control the White House despite all the
[18:00.680 --> 18:03.760]  political rhetoric in my opinion our relationship will remain strong there
[18:03.760 --> 18:07.440]  will be no major changes because they own all the candidates I would add to our
[18:07.440 --> 18:11.320]  trade policies with our friend Canada said Wilkins yeah the Canadians the
[18:11.320 --> 18:16.160]  Mexicans the people in the US none of the people I mean it's 90 plus percent in
[18:16.160 --> 18:20.880]  every poll don't like NAFTA I've seen polls of 99% and the government just
[18:20.880 --> 18:26.320]  says shut up have you noticed we have armed military trained police civilian

[19:06.040 --> 19:09.200]  dependent on which party is in power either in Canada or the US our
[19:09.200 --> 19:12.680]  relationship transcends politics yeah the private corporations run us and
[19:12.680 --> 19:15.880]  they've merged us we read the SPP documents the comments come after a
[19:15.880 --> 19:19.080]  debate in Ohio last month were Democratic candidates Barack Obama and
[19:19.080 --> 19:24.760]  Hillary Clinton threatened it was raw from NAFTA if it wasn't renegotiated now
[19:24.760 --> 19:27.920]  here's the scam they're gonna come in and they're gonna say they're gonna fix it

[24:30.600 --> 24:35.160]  have a second amendment but they have a right to ban all your guns oh oh they're
[24:35.160 --> 24:42.120]  pro-gun here I'm handing mine in that's their favorite operation
[24:42.120 --> 24:48.160]  Mukasey the corrupt little judge involved in 9-11 cover-ups and his own
[24:48.160 --> 24:51.600]  officers filed complaints people that guarded him and he made the federal
[24:51.600 --> 24:55.880]  marshals clean toilets at his house and get his wife's groceries and basically
[24:55.880 --> 25:00.480]  grovel to him it just shows a little slime bag he is the guy's completely
[25:00.480 --> 25:06.200]  rich and won't even hire his own maid he would you he would make the when the
[25:06.200 --> 25:11.200]  federal marshals would get first-class tickets to fly with him but but Mukasey
[25:11.200 --> 25:15.240]  would have to pay for his own he would make them switch them out with him which
[25:15.240 --> 25:19.040]  is illegal but just a little petty dirtbag crook
[25:19.040 --> 25:26.520]  Mukasey admits government knew of call about 9-11 before 9-11
[25:26.520 --> 25:31.800]  echelon spy network would have intercepted cataloged all transmissions
[25:31.800 --> 25:38.560]  the guy was speaking before a big group of people and he came out and admitted
[25:38.560 --> 25:43.680]  that echelon the NSA was listening to it but he said oh but the law didn't let
[25:43.680 --> 25:48.000]  us track it in the u.s. that's a complete lie under the FISA court they just
[25:48.000 --> 25:56.160]  after the fact months later they have to come and get blanket authorizations and
[25:56.160 --> 26:02.600]  what was the numbers out of 18,000 plus they'd refuse less than 10 in decades
[26:02.600 --> 26:08.400]  they basically never refused them less than 10 times out of 18,000 and
[26:08.400 --> 26:15.000]  something just it's not even a warrant but see first they set up decades ago
[26:15.000 --> 26:24.080]  something that already destroyed the fourth amendment you know but you go to
[26:24.080 --> 26:29.520]  a judge later but that's not if he gets up and lies like the public are
[26:29.520 --> 26:36.880]  complete morons and I guess they are so but all of us are and he gets up let me
[26:36.880 --> 26:45.640]  just read the quote quote we knew that there had been a call from someplace
[26:45.640 --> 26:50.040]  that was known to be a safe house in Afghanistan and that we knew that it
[26:50.040 --> 26:54.680]  came to the United States we didn't know precisely where it went reports the
[26:54.680 --> 26:59.040]  San Francisco Chronicle Mukasey is then reported to have grimaced swallowed
[26:59.040 --> 27:03.520]  hard and seemed to tear up as he reflected on the weakness in America's
[27:03.520 --> 27:09.080]  anti-terrorism strategy probably thousand one attacks we got 3,000 we've got
[27:09.080 --> 27:15.000]  3,000 people who went to work that day and didn't didn't come home to show for
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.840]  that he said struggling to maintain his composure this is the guy that helped
[27:18.840 --> 27:23.280]  cover up how the FBI cook the bomb train the drivers gave him the detonators for
[27:23.280 --> 27:26.720]  the first World Trade Center attack this is the guy who helped cover up the
[27:26.720 --> 27:32.560]  insider trading on 9-11 I mean if we went into how bad Mukasey is it would
[27:32.560 --> 27:39.800]  take hours but you can go look it up to yourself just absolute complete poppy
[27:39.800 --> 27:47.240]  conch theater from Mr. Mukasey and Paul Watson is a big article detailing the
[27:47.240 --> 27:53.200]  history of this today up on prisonplanet.com how it's admitted the NSA was
[27:53.200 --> 27:56.640]  watching them all that Muhammad out and others went to the Malaysian Terror
[27:56.640 --> 28:00.800]  Summit that Mr. Springman the head of the embassy and others wouldn't let them
[28:00.800 --> 28:03.760]  back in they were ordered to let them in they knew where they were staying the
[28:03.760 --> 28:07.520]  FBI was paying for their houses their car their cars their credit cards in
[28:07.520 --> 28:14.200]  Florida San Diego Dallas Chicago Minneapolis St. Paul they were US
[28:14.200 --> 28:21.120]  government assets bare minimum trained at US bases that's all admitted but then
[28:21.120 --> 28:30.480]  Mukasey's up we might have intercepted a call from Afghanistan but we weren't
[28:30.480 --> 28:38.520]  able to track it because we didn't have the tool to cry we need we need to get
[28:38.520 --> 28:49.560]  rid of the men they were trained at the Pensacola base in the defense language
[28:49.560 --> 29:02.280]  school and up in Oklahoma and then the the Spook Nick Berg who later got his
[29:02.280 --> 29:08.920]  head staged sawed off in a staged event with white-skinned anglos chopping his
[29:08.920 --> 29:16.080]  head off in a staged event he gave a laptop to one of the lead hijackers in
[29:16.080 --> 29:20.240]  Oklahoma he was at a training base with it daily Oklahoma reported but as you
[29:20.240 --> 29:26.360]  say it's an accident how kind of
[29:26.360 --> 29:32.280]  disgusting Mukasey we know you're in with the murderers and it's disgusting
[29:32.280 --> 29:38.920]  what you've done stop bombing us Mukasey stop killing us so you can pose as our
[29:38.920 --> 29:49.480]  savior stop being a murderer we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[32:02.440 --> 32:06.680]  Mattson a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on cardivate in our mind there isn't
[32:06.680 --> 32:10.480]  such a great big mystery to disease anymore this basic tenet of yeast in the
[32:10.480 --> 32:13.360]  gut and metals and the lyric covers at least seven eighty percent of the
[32:13.360 --> 32:16.560]  disease that we think when we do our program you know herbal formulas like
[32:16.560 --> 32:20.680]  cardivate and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for
[32:20.680 --> 32:24.520]  regular job a few months later we know we're doing something right it's a well
[32:24.520 --> 32:28.720]  thought out formula I mean the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at
[32:28.720 --> 32:32.560]  the same time and liver function is dead on it you'll find I think that it'll
[32:32.560 --> 32:36.320]  work more than just on on heart problems and circulation problems it'll work on

[33:14.960 --> 33:21.360]  by the way I don't come on and call the Attorney General a murderer lightly he
[33:21.360 --> 33:25.720]  clearly covered up making him an accessory after the fact to the bombing of
[33:25.720 --> 33:33.280]  the World Trade Center in 1993 making him an accessory he clearly covered up
[33:33.280 --> 33:38.160]  many other events and helped frame patsies in New York he's definitely an
[33:38.160 --> 33:45.320]  operative of the criminal crew that staged the attacks on 9-11 there's no
[33:45.320 --> 33:52.560]  doubt I want to be clear here that Hollywood whether it's the born ultimatum
[33:52.560 --> 34:00.120]  or conspiracy theories I put out by Mel Gibson they always make it that it's a
[34:00.120 --> 34:04.000]  rogue group and government that's doing it and the rest of government's good and
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.120]  the guys on top are good and they come and they always you know defeat the
[34:08.120 --> 34:12.760]  lower-level echelon that's engaged in the crime the drug dealing the murder the
[34:12.760 --> 34:16.720]  torture the mind control the child kidnapping all the things they put in
[34:16.720 --> 34:21.600]  Hollywood now because it's been in the newspapers but they always phrase it as
[34:21.600 --> 34:26.560]  if it's a small group doing it now in a way that's true it is a small group
[34:26.560 --> 34:32.960]  doing but it's not a subgroup it's the group on the top it is a compartmentalized
[34:32.960 --> 34:39.040]  group it is a small group 99% of FBI agents are not involved in narcotics
[34:39.040 --> 34:47.600]  trafficking probably 75 80% of CIA is not involved in narcotics trafficking 95%
[34:47.600 --> 34:52.400]  of the CIA is not not involved in the sex trade and snuff films and all the
[34:52.400 --> 34:58.280]  things that fit into that but there is a group that is and it's right at the top
[34:58.280 --> 35:02.920]  and every time it's the people at the top running this and they have trusted
[35:02.920 --> 35:09.760]  little cadres that carry out their operations the problem is that they
[35:09.760 --> 35:16.160]  don't have a big enough army to carry out the 9-11 attacks they'd like to
[35:16.160 --> 35:21.000]  carry out and pose as saviors to run the larger kidnapping ops to even run the
[35:21.000 --> 35:29.320]  murder for hire I mean they just don't have enough hitmen to go out and do the
[35:29.320 --> 35:33.800]  knife the long knives like they'd like to because believe it the first group
[35:33.800 --> 35:37.720]  they're gonna purge is their own people that will come and then it will be people
[35:37.720 --> 35:42.520]  like me folks think Alex Jones will be in the first wave no I will be in the
[35:42.520 --> 35:47.440]  second or third wave if they go to full martial law it will be FBI deputy
[35:47.440 --> 35:51.160]  directors and it will be CIA deputy directors it'll be anybody that didn't
[35:51.160 --> 35:55.760]  play ball or who wasn't corrupt and totally evil or who was corrupt and
[35:55.760 --> 36:00.920]  evil but made somebody mad and you know cheated some underling who's now above
[36:00.920 --> 36:09.320]  them or someone who was parallel to them and then it's now above them in
[36:09.320 --> 36:14.400]  tyranny in which I've studied is not a happy place for really anybody including
[36:14.400 --> 36:19.280]  the very people at the top and that's why the elites have been smarter in the
[36:19.280 --> 36:26.200]  past they were into soft power which is real power but the people running things
[36:26.200 --> 36:29.800]  just can't help themselves and psychopaths always want to get caught so
[36:29.800 --> 36:33.400]  they always get reckless and they're getting reckless they're getting wild
[36:33.400 --> 36:36.480]  you know you study most psychopaths they'll kill one woman every six months
[36:36.480 --> 36:42.080]  do it very handily be very careful to do it on quiet roads to not be seen to get
[36:42.080 --> 36:46.240]  rid of the evidence and five years later they're going crazy killing three women
[36:46.240 --> 36:50.680]  one night running around drunk and they finally get pulled over by the cops and
[36:50.680 --> 36:54.480]  get caught and we've kind of reached that phase of just driving around drunk
[36:54.480 --> 36:58.000]  with dead women in the trunk the globalist driving around with women's
[36:58.000 --> 37:07.880]  lipstick on and a red wig like Ronald McDonald and God help us God help us I
[37:07.880 --> 37:14.200]  mean we got total psychopaths running everything you think I'm happy this is
[37:14.200 --> 37:18.120]  going on you think it it's fun to come up here and talk about this and endanger
[37:18.120 --> 37:22.640]  my life every day I wish this wasn't the case every day I want to stop it from
[37:22.640 --> 37:29.440]  setting off nukes are releasing bird flu you know what has so many of the top
[37:29.440 --> 37:33.720]  futurist and multi-billionaire computer company owners say they talk about how
[37:33.720 --> 37:38.400]  the elite are suicidal nihilist we cover this in in-game blueprint for global
[37:38.400 --> 37:45.520]  enslavement you need to find out what suicidal nihilist are so they want to go
[37:45.520 --> 37:53.280]  on a willing and when there's no more willing to their lives when they can't
[37:53.280 --> 37:58.600]  continue to force their will on something and do something reckless and daring
[37:59.240 --> 38:07.520]  then they just start killing people in mass and blowing things up
[38:07.520 --> 38:11.360]  oh I never said the New World Order were cowards I never said they were stupid
[38:11.360 --> 38:16.000]  either they're just absolutely demon-possessed even if you don't believe
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.320]  in God there's no other way to describe them I mean what do you call this they
[38:20.320 --> 38:26.760]  are incredibly daring incredibly smart incredibly wicked you even try to grasp
[38:26.760 --> 38:32.880]  their dark intellect is it makes you believe in God because then you realize
[38:32.880 --> 38:35.520]  when you really study it and really meditate on it that there's something
[38:35.520 --> 38:40.480]  else to it there's some other force there and some would argue well that's the
[38:40.480 --> 38:44.080]  evil people's group consciousness you know working in tandem the scientific
[38:44.080 --> 38:47.640]  studies show that is real it's like radio waves are being broadcast by our
[38:47.640 --> 38:52.800]  minds no one understands it but but it's real or you go to the next level and
[38:52.800 --> 38:57.600]  say it is God and the devil I tend to believe that is the case but whatever
[38:57.600 --> 39:01.600]  you whatever name you put on however you conceptualize it there's something
[39:01.600 --> 39:11.320]  going on here there's some guiding force it's almost like a dimension to evil a
[39:11.320 --> 39:23.400]  bending of the light a dark genius a dark logic a wicked mathematics because you
[39:23.400 --> 39:26.720]  start studying the subtleties in the in the in the perfection of how their
[39:26.720 --> 39:35.360]  wickedness works in tandem it's kind of like a fire ant I went over to my parents
[39:35.360 --> 39:38.880]  house a couple nights ago they got a pool and I was swimming and some fire
[39:38.880 --> 39:42.080]  ants had gotten in the pool they're they're actually water semi water
[39:42.080 --> 39:48.480]  amphibious ant from Brazil but I digress that came here in the 50s into
[39:48.480 --> 39:54.560]  Houston port in wood but side issue and I got a couple of them on me and then
[39:54.560 --> 39:58.640]  they simultaneously one stung me on the chest one stung me on the arm one stung
[39:58.640 --> 40:04.400]  me on the leg simultaneously of course that's a pheromone they're releasing but
[40:04.400 --> 40:08.720]  simultaneously they all stung me that's how they operate they get in place the
[40:08.720 --> 40:12.680]  simultaneously staying so whatever it is that's how the new world order works in
[40:12.680 --> 40:18.040]  tandem it's like it's a it's a hive entity a hive mind
[40:19.480 --> 40:23.640]  alright I'm really digressing now ladies and gentlemen let me get into what I
[40:23.640 --> 40:26.200]  promised to spend some time on today and we're going to spend a lot of time on
[40:26.200 --> 40:35.800]  this in the third hour the best way to do this is to first off say this there is
[40:35.800 --> 40:45.360]  not a finite supply of water it is renewable 75% of the earth surface is
[40:45.360 --> 40:53.320]  saltwater another 2% or so is freshwater above ground 1% below ground 1% but
[40:53.320 --> 40:55.840]  that's what's been discovered it's probably even more there's probably
[40:55.840 --> 41:02.240]  more like 80% water on the surface but water is renewable if you're living out
[41:02.240 --> 41:06.120]  in the desert or you're living somewhere yes you do have shortages or mega cities
[41:06.120 --> 41:09.360]  built in the desert or off the desert like LA are gonna have problems but
[41:09.360 --> 41:13.600]  overall water is totally renewable and the globalist wrote documents 30 years
[41:13.600 --> 41:16.120]  ago saying they were going to propagandize you that it wasn't which
[41:16.120 --> 41:19.880]  with reasonable things like you know don't water during the day water at
[41:19.880 --> 41:28.760]  night and then only watered on Sundays at night and then oh we're gonna find you
[41:28.760 --> 41:31.760]  and now we're gonna arrest you and see it's about training you to do what they
[41:31.760 --> 41:42.360]  say or England where it rains about 120 days out of the year heavily they are
[41:42.360 --> 41:50.040]  gonna make you pay exorbitant prices and it's all about control and it's the same
[41:50.040 --> 41:53.720]  thing with diamonds they are low on the totem pole of semi precious they're not
[41:53.720 --> 41:59.360]  even I on the scale of precious they're they're junk the problem is they're
[41:59.360 --> 42:08.800]  geographically isolated to Arkansas fury as a Canada Brazil Africa Australia and
[42:08.800 --> 42:16.480]  one family owns and controls over 90% of it but they created scarcity there and
[42:16.480 --> 42:19.080]  they tell you diamonds are scarce you'll believe it they tell you water
[42:19.080 --> 42:24.840]  scarce you'll believe it and they can control you but my point is they're
[42:24.840 --> 42:28.600]  saying water is a big crisis but that's what threatens us as the water or they
[42:28.600 --> 42:35.800]  say carbon dioxide one of the basic two building blocks of all life on earth that
[42:35.800 --> 42:40.080]  in previous times in our history has been 14 times higher scientists believe
[42:40.080 --> 42:43.600]  in optimum from studies they've done in controlled environments these have been
[42:43.600 --> 42:47.560]  done over the last 200 years one of the most studied things out there and in
[42:47.560 --> 42:54.080]  agriculture is that you can have 10 times the level of carbon dioxide and it
[42:54.080 --> 43:00.200]  just makes plants live longer grow better it creates more oxygen humans all
[43:00.200 --> 43:04.240]  forms of animal life like higher oxygen the earth is action and oxygen and
[43:04.240 --> 43:11.400]  carbon dioxide starved mode one of the lowest ever recorded they've got ice
[43:11.400 --> 43:15.280]  cores going back 500,000 years by the way one of the lowest ever recorded
[43:15.280 --> 43:22.160]  oxygen slash carbon dioxide levels and they've got people running in fear
[43:22.160 --> 43:28.720]  hyperventilating I mean just freaking out over carbon dioxide that it's gonna
[43:28.720 --> 43:34.120]  heat us up it's gonna kill us it's all over and even if you believe all of that
[43:34.120 --> 43:39.320]  put out by the new world order to set up new systems to micromanage and control
[43:39.320 --> 43:44.680]  you and tax you and tax all human activity in life carbon footprint you
[43:44.680 --> 43:48.360]  believe the fraud their solutions of putting restrictions on Europe in the
[43:48.360 --> 43:52.800]  U.S. only no restrictions on China India and 160 other countries it will
[43:52.800 --> 43:57.080]  actually move it from cleaner societies to the ones with no controls and will
[43:57.080 --> 44:00.120]  actually boost it there's major studies on that so there you're the whole
[44:00.120 --> 44:04.640]  debates over my point is you're freaking out over that
[44:04.640 --> 44:10.040]  meanwhile I've talked a lot about this we're gonna do whole shows on this there
[44:10.040 --> 44:15.640]  are thousands of factories randomly splicing DNA of pigs and monkeys and
[44:15.640 --> 44:21.360]  humans and insects and plants and insects and 20 30 40 50 60 100 200
[44:21.360 --> 44:29.040]  different cross species injections with DNA guns that fire it into the bacteria
[44:29.040 --> 44:33.680]  and fire viruses in and it's already given rise to super viruses and it's
[44:33.680 --> 44:36.840]  already given rise to super bacteria and there's already been all sorts of
[44:36.840 --> 44:41.280]  releases and crises and problems and cover-ups and murders of hundreds and
[44:41.280 --> 44:46.640]  hundreds of microbiologists and the very DNA of the planet the true biosphere is
[44:46.640 --> 44:56.440]  being altered in a way it's never been in its slow development in the past and
[44:56.440 --> 45:02.600]  any day this can release a super virus that kills 20% 100% who knows I mean
[45:02.600 --> 45:06.680]  their government's working on mouse pox that kill 100% of mammals that come in
[45:06.680 --> 45:10.560]  contact with it and that's being done in level two labs in Australia the US
[45:10.560 --> 45:16.680]  England God knows where and the University there what six years ago in
[45:16.680 --> 45:23.400]  Australia put the exact genetic code and how to engineer a mouse pox for any
[45:23.400 --> 45:31.320]  mammal that has 100% kill rate and the government accidentally I'm joking when
[45:31.320 --> 45:39.360]  I say that but they say accidentally put out the code for that exactly how to do
[45:39.360 --> 45:47.760]  it very easily now you begin to realize what we face while you run around
[45:47.760 --> 45:54.320]  gibbering about carbon dioxide okay now let me move on to something else here
[45:54.320 --> 45:57.960]  this is the New York Times been talking about this since Sunday we have a guest
[45:57.960 --> 46:01.720]  on in the third hour on the subject asking a judge to save the world and
[46:01.720 --> 46:07.120]  maybe a whole lot more more fighting in Iraq Somalia and chaos people in this
[46:07.120 --> 46:10.760]  country can't afford their mortgages and in some places now they can't even
[46:10.760 --> 46:16.480]  afford rice none of this nor the rest of the grimness on the front page today
[46:16.480 --> 46:21.040]  will matter a bit though if the two men now this is back like it's two men in
[46:21.040 --> 46:28.560]  this article it's the former head and a physicist of the royal society on the
[46:28.560 --> 46:31.920]  most prestigious on everybody in the world it's new scientists scientists
[46:31.920 --> 46:42.280]  it's hundreds of prominent physicists but see how they minimize that there none
[46:42.280 --> 46:47.960]  of this will matter a bit though if two men pursuing a lawsuit in federal court
[46:47.960 --> 46:51.640]  in Hawaii turn out to be right they think a giant particle accelerator that
[46:51.640 --> 46:55.960]  will begin smashing protons together outside Geneva this summer might produce
[46:55.960 --> 46:59.520]  a black hole or something else it might spell the end of the earth and maybe the
[46:59.520 --> 47:03.080]  universe now it was the same physicist and a bunch of other physicists that
[47:03.080 --> 47:07.160]  theorize that superconducting super colliders would produce limited black
[47:07.160 --> 47:13.840]  holes that they hoped would decay and in most cases they believe in the in the
[47:13.840 --> 47:17.800]  equations will decay and fall apart before they get enough energy to go to
[47:17.800 --> 47:21.560]  mass and begin sucking the earth in
[47:24.000 --> 47:29.160]  you see a you split an atom they start reacting in the uranium or plutonium and
[47:29.160 --> 47:36.920]  then they start violently expanding you have an explosion that's 1900 technology
[47:36.920 --> 47:42.760]  Max Planck and others they theorize their equations laid it out Einstein
[47:42.760 --> 47:46.280]  added to it popularized it but was plank and others the German scientists that
[47:46.280 --> 47:48.880]  are admitted to be the ones that developed it and then in the 40s they
[47:48.880 --> 48:00.160]  made a bombs with it 1945 was how many years ago 60 plus a bombs okay so see
[48:00.160 --> 48:06.520]  this is the opposite this is a bomb that sucks everything into it and
[48:06.520 --> 48:11.760]  explodes inward much smaller than the head of a pin when it's sucked in the
[48:11.760 --> 48:16.680]  entire solar system
[48:17.360 --> 48:25.880]  understand see it's 2008 this is in 1945 with an a bomb this is black holes
[48:25.880 --> 48:31.640]  ladies and gentlemen and guess what now they've made black holes see first they
[48:31.640 --> 48:35.120]  were worried about it and the equation showed it would happen and then Hawking
[48:35.120 --> 48:39.680]  came out a physicist who they've kind of popularized and he is a smart guy but
[48:39.680 --> 48:42.320]  he's admitted he's been wrong a few times but he was right about this he said
[48:42.320 --> 48:45.680]  well don't worry when they make black holes in these they're gonna fall apart
[48:45.680 --> 48:53.160]  they're gonna decay most of the time and they do decay but the equations show
[48:53.160 --> 48:57.160]  that there's gonna be that there is a chance a good chance that they will not
[48:57.160 --> 49:00.960]  decay that they'll get going it's kind of when you're set to start in a fire
[49:00.960 --> 49:07.480]  they'll catch fire and then no more acting cool no more a new Illuminati
[49:07.480 --> 49:14.320]  ceremonies you know no more no more fun no more acting tough no more parading
[49:14.320 --> 49:19.040]  around with your FBI badges no more wearing hippie sandals and running
[49:19.040 --> 49:25.320]  around you know taking people's ranches and farms for the earth this will put
[49:25.320 --> 49:31.960]  a put a kibosh on your party real fast okay let's see the new the new world
[49:31.960 --> 49:42.960]  order wants to play God and they always they always do it close to half the
[49:42.960 --> 49:47.920]  scientist thought that when they detonated over a hundred hydrogen bombs in
[49:47.920 --> 49:56.080]  the atmospheres in the atmosphere nearly 1960s in the u.s. that it was that it was
[49:56.080 --> 50:01.800]  chance it would set the atmosphere on fire it didn't set the atmosphere on
[50:01.800 --> 50:11.560]  fire but it did with EMP blowout transistors all over the planet randomly
[50:12.680 --> 50:16.880]  they thought when they did they did the a bomb half the scientists thought it was
[50:16.880 --> 50:20.800]  going to set the atmosphere on fire because there are equations showing it
[50:20.800 --> 50:29.320]  could but instead it's kind of like when they blow up an oil rig that's on fire
[50:29.320 --> 50:35.040]  use a bomb to blow it out that's what happens so see they go ahead even when
[50:35.040 --> 50:38.560]  they think it's gonna do this well we're gonna get more into this on the other
[50:38.560 --> 50:43.280]  side this is just one black holes are only one small facet of all the things
[50:43.280 --> 50:49.720]  that the that the math shows are probably going to happen but we've got a
[50:49.720 --> 50:54.520]  bad carbon dioxide cuz plants breathe that it's very evil
[50:54.520 --> 50:59.040]  our beloved republic is on her knees the forces of globalism are destroying
[50:59.040 --> 51:03.440]  national sovereignty worldwide but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope the
[51:03.440 --> 51:07.080]  first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up it is essential
[51:07.080 --> 51:10.800]  that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new
[51:10.800 --> 51:14.720]  world order master plan we have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize
[51:14.720 --> 51:19.480]  the people to meet this threat in the info war prison planet TV is a powerful

[53:08.160 --> 53:12.680]  objective being world domination or thousands of years their dark order
[53:12.680 --> 53:17.880]  grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream of
[53:17.880 --> 53:25.920]  exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand for the first time in history the
[53:25.920 --> 53:30.200]  elite's plan for world government is blown wide open you will learn the
[53:30.200 --> 53:34.440]  secret that drives the entire new world order agenda build a bird is making great
[53:34.440 --> 53:38.120]  progress for the world most people have no idea they're not after money they have
[53:38.120 --> 53:41.760]  all the money they need they're after power that's their after these order in
[53:41.760 --> 53:47.360]  game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or info wars dot com or watch it online right
[53:47.360 --> 53:53.520]  now at prisonplanet.tv in game blueprint for global enslavement you have been
[53:53.520 --> 54:19.520]  warned
[54:19.520 --> 54:26.600]  I got an idea I'm gonna go there since they're all over here the long star
[54:26.600 --> 54:33.000]  state should be renamed Texaco we're back live ladies and gentlemen
[54:33.000 --> 54:45.760]  Texas hello Mexico I'm gonna swim the Rio Grande at El Paso now you're not if
[54:45.760 --> 54:52.080]  they set off one of these black holes I'm leaving tonight I ain't gonna pack I'm
[54:52.080 --> 54:57.600]  only taking the clothes on my back so let me continue reading this New York Times
[54:57.600 --> 55:07.440]  article the world physicist have spent 14 years and 8 billion dollars building
[55:07.440 --> 55:13.040]  the large hardened collider in Europe in which the collider protons will create
[55:13.040 --> 55:19.120]  energies and conditions last seen a trillionth of a second after the big
[55:19.120 --> 55:25.600]  bang oh the big bang your equations show a big bang let's recreate those
[55:25.600 --> 55:31.360]  conditions that's that's very smart researchers will sift the debris from
[55:31.360 --> 55:37.800]  the primordial reactions for clues to the nature of mass and new forces and
[55:37.800 --> 55:44.000]  symmetries of nature but Walter L. Wagner and don't even mention their
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.120]  physicist in this article and Louis Sancho contend that scientists at the
[55:48.120 --> 55:54.840]  European Center for Nuclear Research or CERN have played down the chances that a
[55:54.840 --> 55:59.400]  collider could produce among other horrors a tiny black hole which they
[55:59.400 --> 56:02.840]  say could eat the earth now they said this decades ago and now they've created
[56:02.840 --> 56:10.040]  black holes in these but they fall apart they don't get to the the mass they need
[56:10.040 --> 56:15.800]  to start going or it could spit out something called a strangelet that would
[56:15.800 --> 56:21.680]  convert our planet into a shrunken dense dead lump something called strange
[56:21.680 --> 56:29.120]  matter and like the core of the dead son a black dwarf brown dwarf their suit
[56:29.120 --> 56:34.520]  also says the CERN or the superconductive supercollider has failed to
[56:34.520 --> 56:38.200]  provide an environmental impact statement as required under the National
[56:38.200 --> 56:43.160]  Environmental Policy Act although it sounds bizarre the case touches on a
[56:43.160 --> 56:46.520]  serious issue that has bothered scholars and scientists in recent years
[56:46.520 --> 56:50.800]  namely how to estimate the risk of new groundbreaking experiments and who gets
[56:50.800 --> 56:57.040]  to decide whether or not to go ahead the lawsuit filed March 21st in Federal
[56:57.040 --> 57:01.000]  District Court Donald Lulu since a temporary restraining order providing
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.360]  and prohibiting the superconducting supercollider or the large hardened
[57:06.360 --> 57:11.720]  collider from proceeding with accelerator until it is produced a
[57:11.720 --> 57:16.640]  very detailed safety report and an environmental assessment it names the
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.680]  Federal Department of Energy the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory the
[57:20.680 --> 57:25.240]  National Science Foundation Federation and the CERN as defendants yeah our
[57:25.240 --> 57:29.800]  government basically paid for this in Europe as usual they were building in
[57:29.800 --> 57:37.200]  in Texas now they turned it into an underground anti-terror facility up in
[57:37.200 --> 57:43.640]  Waukesha Hatchey north of here up by David J. Smith Church moves watch
[57:43.640 --> 57:49.440]  magazine look the whole point here well there's several points number one I
[57:49.440 --> 57:54.960]  went and found new scientist I went and found major physics organizations in
[57:54.960 --> 58:00.600]  societies I went and found the heads of major societies across the board
[58:00.600 --> 58:06.000]  quantum mechanics engineers saying physicists saying yeah there you know
[58:06.000 --> 58:11.280]  there is a chance that this could really cause a problem we know we're dealing
[58:11.280 --> 58:18.440]  with incredibly explosive forces here a hundred plus years ago they came up with
[58:18.440 --> 58:25.400]  a bomb equations did you know in 1916 HD Wells wrote a book where they had
[58:25.400 --> 58:33.440]  atomic bombs you see it's 2008 I didn't even get into the Air Force's
[58:33.440 --> 58:50.240]  adding that any matter weapons it is a big idea a new world order in the near
[58:50.240 --> 58:56.080]  future earth is dominated by a powerful government is known as the builder
[58:56.080 --> 59:01.760]  bird but their objective being world domination or thousands of years their
[59:01.760 --> 59:06.840]  dark order group now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great
[59:06.840 --> 59:15.200]  dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand for the first time in history
[59:15.200 --> 59:20.000]  the elites plan for world government is blown wide open you will learn the
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.760]  secret that drives the entire new world order agenda
[59:22.760 --> 59:26.520]  the Americans make great progress toward the world government most people have no
[59:26.520 --> 59:29.360]  idea they're not after money they have all the money they need they're after
[59:29.360 --> 59:35.840]  power order in game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or info wars.com or

[59:41.520 --> 1:00:09.600]  enslaved you have been warned waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:17.480]  Texas Alex Jones micro vero for his monthly visit was talking about the drums of
[1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:24.520]  war with Iran the economy New Casey in his 9-11 stumble various suspicions that's
[1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:31.280]  coming up finishing up with the subject I was just now getting into out of the
[1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:35.280]  New York Times asking a judge to save the world where they get into super
[1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:41.440]  conducting super colliders in different types of systems that are similar where
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:46.440]  a lot of the equations being put out by top physicists are showing that it could
[1:00:46.440 --> 1:00:53.360]  have very very dangerous results very implosive results a black hole would be
[1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:58.400]  implosive instead of a an atomic or hydrogen explosion you would have an
[1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:04.480]  implosion a sucking in and then as it gets more mass dragging more into it if
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:08.920]  a black hole ever gets purchased that is gets a toehold in one of these reactors
[1:01:08.920 --> 1:01:14.520]  and they've already made quite a few yeah you won't feel anything it will suck
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:20.440]  the earth up in less than a second and it will reach the Sun in just a few
[1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:29.040]  minutes and the rest is history what is it seven minutes and change to the Sun
[1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:40.160]  so just wanted to let you know that but again this doesn't matter let's go ahead
[1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:44.520]  and have random genetic engineering which could cause massive problems wipe
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:50.160]  out whole sets of life forms already doing it in the lab let's just ignore
[1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:56.400]  all that let's ignore the engineers that brought you a bombs and hydrogen bombs
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:01.440]  sixty something years later doing things billions of times more dangerous
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:10.920]  conservatively New York Times talking about how it could destroy the entire
[1:02:10.920 --> 1:02:15.960]  solar system and then I thought I'd dig out some older articles the Air Force
[1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:21.800]  gave a briefing about antimatter bombs and then reclassified it back in 2004
[1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:30.200]  Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons program was talented publicly then came
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:35.360]  official gag order these would set off a chain reaction that would explode the
[1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:40.320]  earth in less than a second the US Air Force is quietly spending millions of
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:44.920]  dollars investigating ways to use a radical power source antimatter the
[1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:52.000]  airy mirror of ordinary matter in the future weapons and they have isolated
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.080]  any matter they have created our official Suns they've done it all 20 30 years
[1:02:56.080 --> 1:02:59.840]  ago that we know of you imagine what they've got underground these nuts are
[1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:04.840]  doing this every day the admitted colliders are doing this on a daily
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:13.240]  basis around the world in Japan and Europe and Russia and the US but I mean
[1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:16.720]  take Austin Texas there's an experimental nuclear reactor in north
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:21.760]  Austin they're not doing anything that dangerous compared to black holes and
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:26.040]  antimatter but they're doing a lot of secretive stuff over there and you tell
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:29.440]  the average person on the street we've got a reactor in Austin they'll tell you
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:38.080]  no we don't Austin's in liberal town and you're a liar you can type a nuclear
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:41.480]  reactor Austin Texas into Google and you'll be there and it's the JJ Pickle
[1:03:41.480 --> 1:03:45.800]  Research Center a gigantic facility in north Austin guarded by men with
[1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:49.680]  machine guns doesn't exist though you tell these yuppies I mean they're all
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:54.120]  about oh you say there's a reactor in Austin an experimental one oh nope
[1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:59.200]  doesn't exist shut up okay fine doesn't exist just had your way didn't you you
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:06.880]  want again thanks to overwhelming delusional power invincible ignorance
[1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:13.280]  we even got mean phone calls before you shouldn't talk about how there's a
[1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:17.080]  reactor terrorists might go after it you mean in the government know the
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:22.000]  terrorists run the reactor it's one reason to move out of Austin I'm
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:27.280]  strongly considering moving like 80 miles outside this town then they'd call
[1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:36.840]  it a compound though oh man so yeah let's ban humans exhaling carbon dioxide
[1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:42.280]  they're classifying it as a deadly toxic waste globally carbon dioxide it's
[1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:47.720]  evil let's ban it plants breathe it humans exhale it and then let's just not
[1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:51.360]  worry about all this other serious stuff genetic engineering all the rest for

[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:54.240]  one of the first big sites to expose events foster murder then he was called
[1:08:54.240 --> 1:08:59.200]  the right-wing extremist then exposing George Bush as a puppet he's called a
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:03.600]  leftist know we're just Americans who don't like corruption now we've got a
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:09.520]  lot of war drums a lot of circling Iran a lot of mashing trips trying to L
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:13.520]  solder for well he had a ceasefire year and a half ago then it broke another for
[1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:21.040]  six months he never starts it the Shiites they're always trying to then come in
[1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:27.640]  and sneak attack him some say it was a prelude to go into Iran we'll talk about
[1:09:27.640 --> 1:09:31.040]  the war we'll talk about the economy we'll talk about the domestic police
[1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:35.200]  state mucasie stumbling and saying they had NSA transmissions but that they
[1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:41.920]  couldn't follow them in fact queue up that John queue up that to the third
[1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:49.360]  part that will that that last minute with the countdown host Keith
[1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:54.640]  Oberman where he's laying an out saying somebody needs to basically indict or
[1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:58.720]  question mr. mucasie because it is an amazing statement he may will cover
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:02.640]  that too I haven't talked to Mike yet so let's ask him on air micro vero what do
[1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:06.680]  you think of those subjects I just threw out we should get into first orders or
[1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:10.120]  some other subject you want to cover first well it's a lot of stuff happening
[1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:14.360]  right now the economy certainly remains a very large part of the story the
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:20.140]  outsider the situation this last week I think is worth noting because as you
[1:10:20.140 --> 1:10:24.360]  point out he did not start this escalation it came from Maliki now we
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:27.800]  have the u.s. government attempting to distance itself and saying well Maliki
[1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:32.800]  acted on his own and we didn't encourage him or or authorize him to do that which
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:36.520]  kind of reveals that the u.s. does still see itself as kind of running the place
[1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:41.640]  with any pretensions of democracy for Iraq notwithstanding but you're
[1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:45.360]  absolutely right this latest statement that the u.s. government was
[1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:50.080]  intercepting phone calls related to 9-11 before it actually happened again
[1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:55.240]  it's just more fodder for the for those who realize that there's something very
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:11:01.360]  funny about that official story let's get into mckaysie first then here is a
[1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:06.480]  little piece of what Keith oberman said last night and number one you case he
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:11.200]  said what gate almost ignored in the coverage of his speech to the common
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:14.760]  wealth Club of San Francisco pleading for telecom immunity attorney general
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:19.440]  Michael mckaysie also said quote before 9 11 that's the call that we didn't know
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:23.160]  about we knew that there has been a call from some place that was known to be a
[1:11:23.160 --> 1:11:27.400]  safe house in Afghanistan and we knew that it came to the United States we
[1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:33.120]  didn't know precisely where it went what the government knew about some phone
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:39.320]  call from a safe house in Afghanistan into the u.s. about 9 11 before 9 11 and
[1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:43.200]  even though it had the same FISA courts and the same right to act against
[1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:49.360]  international targets in 2001 as it does now you didn't do anything about it well
[1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:52.480]  this would seem to leave only two options either the attorney general just
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:55.560]  admitted that the government for which he works is guilty of malfeasant
[1:11:55.560 --> 1:12:01.280]  complicity in the 9 11 attacks or he's lying I'm betting I'm lying if not
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:05.680]  somebody in Congress better put that man under oath right quick you could send
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:11.680]  him to get more I suppose micro vero comments on that it's getting more and
[1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:16.560]  more bold yeah it is and I would favor the get more option here because
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:19.240]  unfortunately a lot of these guys when you get him under oath they're still
[1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:23.960]  gonna lie anyway and the bottom line is when you get to the core issues of 9
[1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:30.000]  11 regardless of what the ultimate truth really is the fact is the existence of
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.920]  lies and cover-up and deceptions delegitimizes the entire country and it's
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:39.040]  a scandal which nobody is going to allow out so I don't even think you know
[1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:42.920]  hearings under oath are going to do anything it's just a more attempt to
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:47.080]  obfuscate the situation I think the bottom line is we the people know we
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:51.920]  were lied to about 9 11 we accept that you know we gotta stop arguing over the
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:55.520]  minutiae and looking for more proof of what we already know to be true and we
[1:12:55.520 --> 1:12:59.360]  have to face up to what are we going to do with the government that we have caught
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:04.160]  lying to us time and time again not just about 9 11 but about Iraq about al-qaeda
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:07.800]  about all these things we have a government that lies to us with every
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:12.400]  single breath it takes we have to do something I need to dig it out but
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:15.960]  there's a new New York Times poll we're more than half of New Yorkers do believe
[1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:19.880]  it's an inside job now I mean not just that they're being lied to but that it's
[1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:23.960]  an inside job and of course we have the poll two years ago or 36% of Americans
[1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:27.440]  believe inside job 60 something believe they're being lied to I mean the
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:32.120]  establishment has to know we've beaten them in the info war they lied we have
[1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:37.040]  the truth the people know their killers now yeah absolutely you know and it was
[1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:40.120]  easy for us to beat the mainstream media because we do have the truth on our
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:43.920]  side and the people want the truth ultimately there's another statistic
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:48.800]  came out this last week newspaper advertising revenues are at a 50 year
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:53.240]  low people are not reading the newspapers anymore because the newspapers are
[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:58.480]  full of average advertising for white sales and government lies and
[1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:01.120]  deceptions and people just don't want to bother with that anymore well here's
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:06.520]  another example I mean I put an ad in the paper last year and I paid like 350
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:13.720]  bucks for a tiny ad you know maybe an inch and a half long inch wide and I
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:18.440]  got I think three phone calls and they were worthless and then I put one in
[1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:23.760]  Craigslist for free and got like 300 plus yeah absolutely the the internet is
[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:27.240]  now the high ground in the war for the minds of America and there's a story I
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:31.120]  just put up on what really happened this morning where the government admits it is
[1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:35.960]  going out it's trying to find bloggers that they can they can hire or bribe or
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:41.720]  or out of some misguided idea of patriotism convince them to put out the
[1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:46.360]  government's version of story on their blogs in order to try and get ahead of
[1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:50.840]  the ball on the internet back control of the public dialogue that's not going to
[1:14:50.840 --> 1:14:54.280]  work but I mean as long as they waste time on things that won't work that's
[1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:57.960]  wonderful I mean cent com admitted two years ago they have thousands of troops
[1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:02.120]  at their desk and they're the ones they're so dumb they even use their own
[1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:06.040]  handles and then you go find their myspace and there they are and they'll
[1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:10.360]  openly say I'm in the military I can't wait to kill you but but but they're the
[1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:15.120]  house slave kind of because the majority of troops support Ron Paul support
[1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:19.080]  liberty it's only the little house slaves that actually sit in the propaganda
[1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:22.840]  belly who were selected because they were weak minded to begin with and so the
[1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:26.440]  enemy's personnel is so stupid because you've got to be stupid to serve them
[1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:32.200]  that their their propaganda is so ham-fisted that it it's showing everyone
[1:15:32.200 --> 1:15:37.120]  I think it's wonderful Mike yeah I agree because you know once the public becomes
[1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:41.560]  aware that these games are being played it becomes very obvious when they see it
[1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:45.640]  you know the reason and I've been saying this all along one of the worst
[1:15:45.640 --> 1:15:49.840]  problems that the government faces is they've never really conceptually gotten
[1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:53.200]  a handle on the internet and alternative media and they're still trying to play
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:56.600]  the propaganda game by the rules that worked at the height of the Cold War in
[1:15:56.600 --> 1:16:00.880]  the nineteen fifties in the nineteen sixties back when media was all one way
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:05.360]  where the government says the TV and radio broadcast and the public accepts
[1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:10.120]  and there was no feedback but in the age of the internet the whole dynamic of
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:14.880]  information flow has changed and the government has never quite gotten a
[1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:19.200]  handle on that and that's why these Cold War era propaganda tricks they're
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:22.840]  trying to play now not only don't work they call attention to themselves and
[1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:26.360]  this is the reason you have these polls where the New Yorkers half of them
[1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:30.080]  believe a 9-11 was an inside job and that number is going to keep on going up
[1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:34.520]  because you know that the facts are obvious when you look at them
[1:16:34.520 --> 1:16:40.960]  objectively I want to get into the war and to tell back into mucasian we're
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:43.560]  talking about that article you just reported on another admission of them
[1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:48.280]  engaging in covert propaganda and now overt propaganda and we talk about a
[1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:53.160]  collapse a Soviet Union style collapse I I agree that's going to happen but I
[1:16:53.160 --> 1:16:57.360]  don't see them going quietly into the night they're gonna go wild and set off
[1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:02.520]  a nuke or release bird flu or something crazy yeah I would tend to agree with
[1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:06.240]  that yeah they're cornered now and cornered animals are always the most
[1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:11.000]  most dangerous and we've got it we've got a bunch of leaders who realize that
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:14.520]  they're looking at war crimes trials they're trying to play every card they've
[1:17:14.520 --> 1:17:19.000]  got they're trying to go back into a threat of terror they're trying to pull
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:24.200]  the the God gambit you know God has told us to go do this and if you oppose us
[1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:27.440]  you're standing up against God and it's just they're playing every card what
[1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:32.000]  about the white al-qaeda I mean four months ago the British intel and then
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:37.680]  the fox put out this vague thing about 1500 white al-qaeda's they're everywhere
[1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:40.640]  they're gonna kill you and then at the end said this this isn't a confirmed
[1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:46.320]  report just totally made up on his face and now that that little demonic he
[1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:49.840]  just he just radiates weakness and that's what I call a chicken neck I'm
[1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:56.520]  sorry but but Hayden the guy that heads up the CIA did head up the NSA and now
[1:17:56.520 --> 1:17:59.400]  he says white al-qaeda is everywhere and is going to kill us I mean this is
[1:17:59.400 --> 1:18:03.640]  really getting stupid well what they're attempting to do is to justify the
[1:18:03.640 --> 1:18:07.920]  surveillance on ordinary Americans because people are starting to stand up to
[1:18:07.920 --> 1:18:11.800]  all the surveillance in the spine and the wire tapping the emails and why are
[1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:15.800]  you watching us we're not the enemy but you're treating it like the enemy the
[1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:19.360]  enemy is over there and there and and if you believe the propaganda it's the
[1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:22.720]  Arab Muslims are but it's over that why are you looking at us and now they're
[1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:26.640]  trying to create this idea well there are al-qaeda in America and they look
[1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:29.760]  just like you and that's why we've got to look at all of you and it's just
[1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:34.200]  another way of attempting to sell this idea that we should submit to constant
[1:18:34.200 --> 1:18:38.520]  scanning constant surveillance but it's comic book I mean this is like a bad
[1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:44.400]  comic book it's so transparent it really really is and of course we all know
[1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:48.160]  about Adam Perlman the so-called American al-qaeda apparently we've got
[1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:51.680]  another one just surfaced in New York he's been running this blog with all
[1:18:51.680 --> 1:18:55.320]  this hate America you know Muslims should kill America stuff and it turns
[1:18:55.320 --> 1:19:00.320]  out his real name is Joseph Cohen and it's another fraud they can't even find
[1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:05.960]  you've got the Intel Center uploading it and top wired magazine you know top
[1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:09.920]  computer people look at it and they're placing the Intel Center bug in the
[1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:15.000]  same video letter as the al-qaeda bug I mean Adam Gadon grandson of the ADL
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:20.320]  head how dumb do they think we are well obviously they think we're a lot
[1:19:20.320 --> 1:19:24.200]  dumber than we really are because they keep trying to play these tricks we
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:27.120]  keep exposing it and they keep scratching your heads and saying wait a
[1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:30.480]  minute this wasn't supposed to get caught out we're supposed to be these really
[1:19:30.480 --> 1:19:35.160]  smart people who are going to own the world and they keep falling on their

[1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:35.760]  capability of coming in and inflicting serious serious harm so anytime you get
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:42.600]  a anything that that that looks like it's an assault you know it is somebody's
[1:25:42.600 --> 1:25:48.000]  trying to pick a fight and psychiatrists call this let's you and him fight and
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:52.760]  this is a human trait of exerting one's own power by tricking other people to
[1:25:52.760 --> 1:25:56.760]  hurt each other and kill each other up for you and and keep your own hands
[1:25:56.760 --> 1:26:01.920]  clean the British call that the great game yeah very much so and you know
[1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:05.920]  uh... of course israel has a long record of playing these kind of deceptions
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:09.400]  uh... going back to the bombing of the king david hotel the levon affair the
[1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:13.440]  attack on the u s s liberty and so when you see these propaganda videos coming
[1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:17.040]  out that are being made by somebody that's known to be the grandson of an
[1:26:17.040 --> 1:26:21.280]  a d l board member you have to take what is this guy really trying to do and it's
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:26.920]  obvious he's trying to build anger in america to go kill Muslims
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:31.880]  and ultimately because we have never actually been invaded by Muslims
[1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:35.360]  this is something we have to ask who really stands to benefit
[1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:39.760]  uh... by america's war on all by the way the uh...
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:42.040]  adam perlman al-qa'don
[1:26:42.040 --> 1:26:45.000]  even gotten trouble once and got arrested for going to mosque to beat up
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:45.920]  Muslims
[1:26:45.920 --> 1:26:50.040]  but he's suddenly just a lot of them all i'm with al-qaeda
[1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:54.520]  uh... yeah absolutely it's it's it's a fake uh... they can't find real muslim
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:57.840]  terrorists that are going to pay the things that they need
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:01.880]  american people to think muslims are saying yeah you dirty americans will die
[1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:02.720]  soon
[1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:04.640]  ha ha ha
[1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:06.720]  and you do that very well
[1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:08.000]  ha ha ha ha ha
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:12.160]  you know what i i mean i could put a beard on and do that too
[1:27:12.160 --> 1:27:16.120]  yeah anybody can and uh... in in some of the videos that we've seen the the the
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:17.960]  beard are obviously phony
[1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:21.760]  uh... they did that the guys don't even look like a problem over time the more
[1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:22.680]  they make these
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:26.160]  these videotapes the less like the real opama look i think they're trying to
[1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:27.160]  migrate him
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:30.080]  into a new or younger more dangerous looking
[1:27:30.080 --> 1:27:33.680]  uh... version and hope that nobody notices that he's changing over time
[1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:37.320]  uh... but the reality is most people are now aware that opama bin laden
[1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:41.160]  himself died in december of two thousand one of medical issues
[1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:46.080]  and uh... uh... you know every opama sent then has been a fake of one form or
[1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:48.400]  another and like i said in the last segment
[1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:51.080]  the the problem from the point of view of the u.s. government is they're playing
[1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:53.240]  the game by the rules that worked
[1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:56.480]  in the nineteen fifties in nineteen sixties and they just
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:27:58.160]  don't
[1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:01.160]  uh... you know uh... back in the fifties and sixties they would be happy if they
[1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:01.840]  fooled
[1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:05.000]  ninety five percent of americans into going along with the agenda
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.440]  because that other five percent that weren't full
[1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:10.240]  were harmless and helpless and couldn't do anything about it but that has
[1:28:10.240 --> 1:28:11.200]  changed
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:16.040]  the instant one person spot the fraud and put out exactly why they think it's a
[1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:16.880]  fraud
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:18.400]  everybody who reads it
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:20.400]  looked at it and says oh yeah
[1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:24.160]  and the instant the government is exposed on a single lie
[1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:27.880]  all of a sudden everybody is looking at everything the government has ever said
[1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:28.840]  with a new
[1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:32.640]  very critical i and they've been exposed they've been exposed in thousands of
[1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:34.760]  lies is another transparent line
[1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:36.960]  every week there's a new al-qaeda tape
[1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:40.360]  that always serves the interest of the western bankers
[1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:41.360]  and
[1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:44.560]  that never even says where it comes from is just as a message board has a new
[1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:45.600]  tape
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:49.640]  uh... and then the news acts like it's authentic and suddenly all the standards
[1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:53.720]  of journalism for the a p and roiders don't exist anymore
[1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:56.720]  well the reason for that is very simple every time they would put out uh...
[1:28:56.720 --> 1:28:58.640]  this new al-qaeda website
[1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:01.800]  computer experts would track down the fight and they find it was located in
[1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:02.880]  west virginia
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:04.480]  or in texas
[1:29:04.480 --> 1:29:07.800]  or some other place inside the united states they couldn't
[1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:11.840]  hide where the actual server was so now they won't announce them anymore they
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:13.120]  won't name them
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:16.360]  and uh... ostensibly this is to keep impressionable mind
[1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:18.360]  from going to the al-qaeda website
[1:29:18.360 --> 1:29:21.280]  and becoming terrorist themselves but the reality is
[1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:24.840]  they can't put out a convincing web service well it's real simple than the
[1:29:24.840 --> 1:29:30.000]  expert they blow up the video of adam gadan the a d l guy
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:31.120]  and
[1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:33.600]  it's in the same pixels
[1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:37.280]  you see you lay it over the video is a different
[1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:40.480]  and it's just absolutely fake folks they're uploading it
[1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:41.720]  they should all be arrested
[1:29:41.720 --> 1:29:43.120]  we're on the march

[1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:49.280]  the people don't want it they are still we had Betrayus say last week that he
[1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:54.920]  wanted to you know do something against Iran because he thought they launched the
[1:37:54.920 --> 1:37:58.200]  attacks on the green zone then you have Bush bragging that they ordered the
[1:37:58.200 --> 1:38:02.880]  attack then when it failed in Basra he said he wasn't part of the attack we've
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:07.160]  got a massing troops do you really think they've got the Hutzpah or the
[1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:12.120]  bravada to do it well I don't even think it has anything to do with Hutzpah and
[1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:18.040]  bravado I think the plan is that if they can start a whole new war in Iran that
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:21.120]  they might get back their their popularity and their poll numbers that
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:25.200]  they got after the invasion of Iraq immediately after in other words they're
[1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:28.560]  trying to create a whole new crisis to distract from all the other crisis that
[1:38:28.560 --> 1:38:31.800]  are that are definitely turning against them but I'm looking at this last
[1:38:31.800 --> 1:38:36.960]  situation in Basra and before it kicked up first part of the month of March they
[1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:40.080]  were saying that everything was really quiet in Iraq and that proved the surge
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:44.000]  was working and then as soon as we have all this violence escalating Bush is
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:47.800]  back on TV say the service proves the surge is working because now they're
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:52.040]  striking back against it and it was like no matter what happens you know it's a
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:55.880]  good thing for us it proves the surges working blah blah blah blah blah and it
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:38:59.880]  really their their their their their lying to look good at the moment and
[1:38:59.880 --> 1:39:03.760]  they're really not even paying attention to what they said before because they
[1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:06.560]  were assuming that the rest of us aren't paying attention to what was said
[1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:12.640]  before and again this reveals they don't understand how the information
[1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:16.960]  processing of the American people and the rest of the world is changing in the
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:21.280]  current age and that it you know it they they're they're totally reactive here
[1:39:21.280 --> 1:39:25.440]  they're in crisis management and I think the desire to go into Iran is first of
[1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:30.280]  all to prove that they can still do it to prove that they and not the American
[1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:34.240]  people are running the country but mostly I think they are convinced that if
[1:39:34.240 --> 1:39:37.800]  they can start a new war in Iran that all of a sudden the American people are
[1:39:37.800 --> 1:39:41.240]  going to fall into line behind them and say yes we've got a big war we must
[1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:45.400]  march off and send our children to die in Iran and and so forth and so on
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:50.920]  ultimately though if Bush keeps pushing we could find ourselves at war with
[1:39:50.920 --> 1:39:57.360]  Russia or China or both and I don't think that's a situation any of us want well
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:00.440]  I agree with you that they see it as failing forward like all the Republican
[1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:05.960]  memos have said either we're gonna have a new war or Saddam is is is going to be
[1:40:05.960 --> 1:40:10.480]  captured but that didn't work or bin Laden is going to be captured or a new
[1:40:10.480 --> 1:40:15.080]  9-11 and then we had Republicans writing all these memos and then it came out in
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:21.160]  the news oh we want terror attacks I mean first off they do need to fail forward
[1:40:21.160 --> 1:40:25.000]  but I see that is blowing up in their face do you think they realize that a
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  and then be why do we have people like Gary Hart coming out and writing letters
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:34.080]  to Iran saying will stage terror attacks you better do what we say it just it
[1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:41.520]  just seems like it's a mix of panic plus total hubris yeah absolutely and that's
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:46.040]  a bad combination because sooner or later when you have a political leadership
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:50.760]  that is that in love with their own agenda and philosophy and their their
[1:40:50.760 --> 1:40:55.240]  their self-image and that out of touch with their own people sooner or later
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:58.560]  they're going to make the big mistake that brings it all down I mean if you go
[1:40:58.560 --> 1:41:03.280]  back and you look at chow chescoe or Charles the first or Louis the 16th
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:08.000]  these were rulers who miscalculated and they made the mistake of pushing just a
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:12.640]  little too far and it all came apart well they miscalculated they miscalculated
[1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:17.400]  they tried to have a nine the long knives against the Shiites tried to arrest
[1:41:17.400 --> 1:41:22.080]  and kill them from Baghdad to Basra and then the Shiites fought back and the
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:25.560]  news didn't even report that it was all over the foreign press and just said
[1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:30.720]  those dirty Shiites they snuck attack us no the globalists ran a sneak attack on
[1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:35.320]  them yeah Maliki started the whole situation and he put it he found
[1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:39.880]  himself you know with his hand in a bear trap and tried to pull back and you
[1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:43.560]  know Iran comes in playing peacemaker which makes the u.s. look even worse and
[1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:48.760]  al-sadr says yeah we'll we'll back off as long as you don't attack us again and
[1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:54.320]  what that basically means is Maliki is now seen as no longer in control of all
[1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:59.840]  of Iraq and it turns out that Bush's boyfriend a betray us known as portray
[1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:06.000]  us it turns out that he really thought that al-sadr stood down because he was
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:12.520]  weak instead al-sadr had built up their their their system absolutely and the
[1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:15.920]  the consensus coming out of Iraq right now is there are parts of Iraq that are
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:20.320]  under Maliki's control there are parts of Iraq which de facto are under al-sadr's
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:24.280]  control and everybody knows which is which and they know not to go into the
[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:28.960]  other side and this is probably going to deteriorate into the same situation we
[1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:33.320]  had in Mogadishu a few years back to go back to the whole Black Hawk down
[1:42:33.320 --> 1:42:38.040]  situation where everything's factionalized and broke up and we wound up
[1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:41.680]  you know the u.s. wound up very embarrassed in that situation
[1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:47.400]  iraq is deteriorating there's no two ways about it this whole surge idea was
[1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:51.560]  working in the first place only because we were bribing the people on the other
[1:42:51.560 --> 1:42:55.920]  side not to shoot at us and obviously it's a huge amount and it was it and it
[1:42:55.920 --> 1:42:59.960]  was working the deaths have been cut in about half still a complete disaster five
[1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:06.400]  plus years in and then they had to break their own deal i mean i think that's a
[1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:09.480]  consistent problem with the united states they'll make a deal with one group
[1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:12.960]  and then they'll say oh that's no longer operative and they go make a
[1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:16.640]  different deal and that's one of the reasons why no foreign government on
[1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:19.480]  earth will really trust the united states anymore well that's it there's
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:23.640]  nothing worse than an individual or a cop or a company or government that
[1:43:23.640 --> 1:43:28.760]  knowingly lies and cheat you people just stop dealing with you
[1:43:28.760 --> 1:43:33.480]  well you know bush is violated and just outright ignored so many treaties and
[1:43:33.480 --> 1:43:37.120]  that's considered the highest commitment between nations is when you sign a
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:41.000]  treaty and for bush to have set so many of them aside that the nuclear
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:45.560]  non-proliferation treaty the strategic arms limitation talks the geneva
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:50.000]  convention all of these things are no longer part of the united states and the
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:53.600]  rest of the world is saying okay well the u.s. is not the moral leader they use
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:59.000]  to be you know we're gonna be decades recovering from this if we recover from
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  it at all also cheney and bush and rumsfeld came out and bragged about
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:10.880]  torture and press conferences will never forget seeing rumsfeld openly say it in
[1:44:10.880 --> 1:44:15.560]  a pentagon press conference in 2002 they thought they could sell everybody on
[1:44:15.560 --> 1:44:19.120]  their mindset because they they have to recruit people so they have to kind of
[1:44:19.120 --> 1:44:23.240]  be public about what they want to do and they've hung their shingle out and
[1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:26.600]  they said hey we want marshal law we want police state we want hundred year
[1:44:26.600 --> 1:44:32.560]  war we want to take your rights and the people are rejecting it and and and in
[1:44:32.560 --> 1:44:38.600]  a way they're trying to sell evil is good i think proved everybody that would
[1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:41.600]  that that you and i and others were telling them the truth because this
[1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:46.120]  stuff sounded crazy ten years ago or five years about absolutely when i
[1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:49.640]  started what really happened you know fifteen years ago now i mean i was
[1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:54.040]  ostracized and criticized i was uh... of literally kicked out of uh...
[1:44:54.040 --> 1:44:57.880]  uh... out of hollywood for saying the things i was saying now all of a
[1:44:57.880 --> 1:45:01.080]  sudden you know uh... people are coming back to me they think but you know you
[1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:05.320]  were right all along they really were planning this stuff and uh...
[1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:08.920]  at you know and and it really doesn't make me feel all that much better for
[1:45:08.920 --> 1:45:13.680]  them to be saying now you you were right because if they realized i was but we
[1:45:13.680 --> 1:45:17.320]  were right back then we might have had a little more success in in kind of
[1:45:17.320 --> 1:45:21.120]  heading off some of the stuff that happened uh... that that we didn't
[1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:24.480]  want to happen like the torture uh... but you know at least people are waking
[1:45:24.480 --> 1:45:26.720]  up now and i think because of that
[1:45:26.720 --> 1:45:30.680]  uh... you know there's a good chance we may be able to derail this russian to
[1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:32.240]  world war three
[1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:36.800]  i hope so i just know this uh...
[1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:39.360]  you know for people out there listening don't think we're completely out of the
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:40.480]  woods
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:43.840]  the people running our country are very bold i mean they flew planes in the
[1:45:43.840 --> 1:45:45.000]  buildings they
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  they killed three thousand of us
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:50.200]  uh... because it's a military decision just like a military leader will put
[1:45:50.200 --> 1:45:52.400]  three thousand of us troops in a valley to
[1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:55.720]  pull in the enemy to show themselves and knowing it will sacrifice
[1:45:55.720 --> 1:45:57.040]  his three thousand
[1:45:57.040 --> 1:46:00.080]  uh... that's happened many many times even greater numbers in some cases so
[1:46:00.080 --> 1:46:02.280]  they was a military mindset
[1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:03.840]  that did that
[1:46:03.840 --> 1:46:06.960]  out of the military industrial complex allied with uh...
[1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:09.520]  uh... the international bankers
[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:13.680]  we don't understand they are very bold like they are bold and
[1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:16.720]  uh... i just i just hope and pray
[1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:20.080]  that somehow people in government stop them
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:23.680]  well i'd like to see that but you know i kind of have that same idea fifteen
[1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:27.320]  years ago when uh... all i was focused on with the vince foster case i could
[1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:28.040]  thinking
[1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:29.960]  if i just put out the facts
[1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:33.640]  you know that people within the fb i would say hey yeah there's really uh...
[1:46:33.640 --> 1:46:37.640]  there's really a crime that took place here it didn't happen unfortunately
[1:46:37.640 --> 1:46:41.600]  uh... our government really is corrupted all the way through uh... but the in
[1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:44.760]  addition to the idea of of being bold a lot of our leaders are just
[1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:46.440]  outright sociopathic
[1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:49.360]  they literally cannot
[1:46:49.360 --> 1:46:50.720]  their actions cost
[1:46:50.720 --> 1:46:53.360]  uh... paint other people they they can't feel that
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:55.680]  the other part of it is there is
[1:46:55.680 --> 1:46:57.940]  within some circles of government
[1:46:57.940 --> 1:47:01.800]  an agenda for deep population if you look what's happening right now with the
[1:47:01.800 --> 1:47:02.520]  food
[1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:04.560]  uh... shortages starting to happen
[1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:08.320]  uh... everybody's going to be screaming population is a problem and that's all
[1:47:08.320 --> 1:47:12.720]  goes back to henry kissinger's national security study two hundred
[1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:14.760]  which during the nixon era
[1:47:14.760 --> 1:47:18.900]  we can control world population if we can deliberately cause
[1:47:18.900 --> 1:47:23.120]  famine food is a weapon for us a weapon in the ninety six u n
[1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:25.180]  food summit saying the same thing
[1:47:25.180 --> 1:47:28.920]  and and that's the big issue there is a larger international force playing
[1:47:28.920 --> 1:47:30.580]  bush in the neocons
[1:47:30.580 --> 1:47:32.680]  kind of as their meat puppets
[1:47:32.680 --> 1:47:37.680]  uh... but now i do see even that elite groups thing is seeing that there
[1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:40.360]  the work they put forward the neocons
[1:47:40.360 --> 1:47:41.720]  has been a failure
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:45.420]  and now they're trying to extricate themselves from what they've started
[1:47:45.420 --> 1:47:49.000]  and it appears that the neocons are running along on their own steam
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:50.880]  refusing to be uh...
[1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:53.840]  the drawn back in the degree of analysis
[1:47:53.840 --> 1:47:58.680]  uh... yeah i would but you know if it's not always that clear cut there are a
[1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:02.280]  lot of overlapping factions and a lot of temporary alliances
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:06.400]  i think a lot of support the neocons did have is leaving them because they've
[1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:07.760]  become too visible
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:11.680]  they've uh... really lost the support of the majority of the american people who
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:12.600]  recognize
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:16.080]  there's nothing really conservative about the neoconservative movement
[1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:19.520]  that it's the it's basically fascism under a new name
[1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:22.960]  and americans have really turned their backs on that especially because we've
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:24.880]  been bankrupted by those wars
[1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:29.560]  started with life and what i'm talking about the elites
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:36.560]  i'm talking about the bill berger at the trilateral commission cf bar
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:40.120]  i think that's the same group of people i think their support for the neocons is
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:44.360]  definitely on the way because the neocons have not been able to deliver
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:47.120]  what they were going to deliver which is u s war
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:49.040]  on eight nations in the mid-eighth
[1:48:49.040 --> 1:48:52.400]  we're bogged down in the first two it's a fight to start the third
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:57.520]  no way is this going to sustain to reach all of the eventual targets
[1:48:57.520 --> 1:49:00.440]  uh... that was in the right it's not as easy
[1:49:00.440 --> 1:49:03.160]  as the armchair generals said it would be
[1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:06.600]  that's absolutely it so now they're looking for another device
[1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:09.760]  that's one of the reasons why i think believe it or not the same forces are
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:11.320]  kind of behind this whole
[1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:14.800]  global warming thing where they want to tell us carbon taxes
[1:49:14.800 --> 1:49:15.920]  they want to uh...
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:19.960]  uh... justify complete control over our lives in terms of how much energy we're
[1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:23.240]  using how they got two tracks they've got we're gonna take your rights to fight
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:24.520]  the bogeyman al-qaeda
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:26.880]  we're gonna take your rights to fight the bogeyman
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:29.880]  uh... mister evil carbon dioxide
[1:49:29.880 --> 1:49:33.520]  yeah that that's basically it it's constantly creating a new enemy for you
[1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:36.840]  to be afraid of so that they can take your money and your rights away in
[1:49:36.840 --> 1:49:38.280]  order to protect you
[1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:42.840]  from uh... you know the mythical ozama carbon meanwhile mike their genetic
[1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:46.200]  engineering uncontrolled deadly dangerous they've got particle
[1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:48.200]  accelerators smashing heavy
[1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:51.280]  elements together and uh... the majority of physicists
[1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:54.920]  say it's very dangerous what's wrong with this elite
[1:49:54.920 --> 1:49:58.960]  well deal the elite there in love with their own power and ability to do things
[1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:01.960]  and uh... you know they basically look back to history
[1:50:01.960 --> 1:50:05.840]  and they say everything that bad goes on we can stick on somebody else
[1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:08.400]  but in the case of the genetic engineering
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:11.960]  and possibly with this accelerator uh... in europe
[1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:15.520]  we're dealing with technology that that have the potential really to wreck the
[1:50:15.520 --> 1:50:17.920]  entire world and not just an area
[1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:18.960]  chair noble
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:22.800]  as terrible as it was was confined to a small area you put up a chain link
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:23.880]  fence around it
[1:50:23.880 --> 1:50:25.800]  nobody goes in
[1:50:25.800 --> 1:50:29.560]  disasters over we've had industrial accidents with die oxen
[1:50:29.560 --> 1:50:32.760]  where they have to basically stay there i want to get your take on this my
[1:50:32.760 --> 1:50:34.760]  brother i promise we're gonna get to dan
[1:50:34.760 --> 1:50:37.760]  during others keep mike a few minutes into the next hour we can do that
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:39.960]  what really happened dot com he's a great guy
[1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:42.400]  we really are always honored to have joined us once a month
[1:50:42.400 --> 1:50:49.400]  and he's also here on the gc radio network will be right back
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:53.520]  our beloved republic is on her knees
[1:50:53.520 --> 1:50:57.160]  the forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide
[1:50:57.160 --> 1:50:59.600]  but in liberties darkest hour there is hope
[1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:02.640]  the first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up
[1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:06.080]  it is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's
[1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:08.440]  understanding of the new world order master plan
[1:51:08.440 --> 1:51:11.920]  we have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet
[1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:16.120]  this threat in the info war prison planet dot tv is a powerful weapon in the

[1:52:52.760 --> 1:52:56.200]  all right then let me get this straight i'm civil liberties takes place in the
[1:52:56.200 --> 1:53:00.040]  future right like star wars yeah that's right slightly in the future
[1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:04.400]  wait a second i thought star wars took place a long long time ago
[1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:08.960]  all right einstein but it is kind of like star wars anyway just like star wars
[1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:13.400]  there's an evil empire and some people have started an armed rebellion to fight
[1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:14.480]  the evil empire
[1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:18.880]  okay so don't tell me the government's the bad guys again yeah that's right
[1:53:18.880 --> 1:53:22.640]  also your characters like luke skywalker not exactly
[1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:27.880]  i know you're too bad not really but my character does help the rebellion to stop
[1:53:27.880 --> 1:53:31.960]  the government's evil tracking system which is happening now in the real world
[1:53:31.960 --> 1:53:36.000]  just like in uncivil liberties wait a second they can't track us it's a free
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  country
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:42.440]  exactly uncivil liberties a political thriller ripped from today's headlines

[1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:51.720]  all right back to mike revero and then to dan drew david james and john
[1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:55.520]  mike is briefly then we'll write the calls super science
[1:54:55.520 --> 1:54:57.880]  it's here is two thousand and eight
[1:54:57.880 --> 1:55:02.520]  max plankton others a hundred years ago drew up equations for a bombs
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:05.760]  sixty five years ago they detonated one
[1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:08.960]  uh... and now we've got things much more advanced in the scientist i've been
[1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:10.160]  reading over it
[1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:13.480]  prestigious physicists are saying there is a good chance
[1:55:13.480 --> 1:55:17.880]  that doing this is you could really cause massive disasters
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:20.680]  and they don't care they just say they're going to do it and they're not
[1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:23.440]  going to stop
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:27.320]  the psychology of that is bizarre
[1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:32.000]  uh... yeah it really really is because we're getting to an area where
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:36.080]  uh... the technologies do have a potential to threaten
[1:55:36.080 --> 1:55:40.040]  birth as a whole and the example i like to use is not from the uh... nuclear
[1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:40.840]  physics
[1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:42.840]  uh... but from genetic research
[1:55:42.840 --> 1:55:45.640]  because when you have an accident like a chair noble
[1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:49.560]  uh... as terrible as it is it's confined to just one place you put fences
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:52.760]  around it you say nobody can go in there for the next thousand years
[1:55:52.760 --> 1:55:56.720]  and that kind of the end of it and you live in and learn and you move forward
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:55:58.800]  but in the case of uh... genetic
[1:55:58.800 --> 1:55:59.800]  tinkering
[1:55:59.800 --> 1:56:02.840]  where a lot of these products are being put out before the
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:05.760]  they're fully understood how they're going to affect the environment
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:06.960]  and we start
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:12.040]  getting these synthetic jeans migrating into uh... natural plant
[1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:14.080]  and we get unpredictable effects
[1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:17.400]  there is uh... apparently back in nineteen ninety nine
[1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:18.920]  it was already known
[1:56:18.920 --> 1:56:21.080]  the genetically modified plant
[1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:24.520]  we're killing the larvae of monarch butterfly
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:28.480]  and now of course we have the situation where the b's that we depend on to
[1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:30.400]  pollinate our food crop plants
[1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:33.080]  are starting to die off apparently uh...
[1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:37.160]  statistics out of north dakota is they've lost half their b population the
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:39.480]  last year
[1:56:39.480 --> 1:56:43.000]  uh... unlike a nuclear accident which is confined to one area
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:47.040]  if you get a bad gene like a gene that sterilize life forms
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:50.880]  after so many generations and it gets out into the wild it will spread
[1:56:50.880 --> 1:56:55.520]  everywhere on earth or nanotech by the biological nanotech the classic
[1:56:55.520 --> 1:56:56.600]  grey goo
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:57:00.880]  or something that you know attacks the basic uh... oxygen
[1:57:00.880 --> 1:57:04.840]  uh... absorption of all blood cells killing all animals
[1:57:04.840 --> 1:57:07.920]  i mean it's just like five years ago the big government university of australia
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:09.160]  released
[1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:11.360]  the coding and and the recipe
[1:57:11.360 --> 1:57:16.200]  to build a mouse pox that kills any mammal you engineer it for one hundred
[1:57:16.200 --> 1:57:17.240]  percent
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:20.480]  and they just put out the ingredient list why do you think they're doing that
[1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:21.720]  mike
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:26.120]  well it was a very reckless thing to do and i i know sometimes that uh...
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:27.840]  university scientists
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:31.840]  you know don't see the world as necessarily an evil place and then
[1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:35.360]  needs to be careful but yeah they they put these formulas out there
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:38.520]  and uh... now we've got our scientists up in there in the uh... arctic they're
[1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:41.360]  digging up the spanish flew to play with again
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:44.840]  which by the way is hideously misnamed because it did not come from spain it
[1:57:44.840 --> 1:57:46.800]  came from u.s. military bases
[1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:51.440]  uh... but with regard to the situation with the collider in it
[1:57:51.440 --> 1:57:52.760]  uh...
[1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:56.280]  i'm i'm surprised to hear them say that it could conceivably make a quantum
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:57:57.320]  black hole
[1:57:57.320 --> 1:57:59.600]  i'm even more alarmed where they're saying
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:04.800]  that they just assume that any quantum black hole made would simply evaporate
[1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:07.520]  because this is based on a very
[1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:09.560]  flawed
[1:58:09.560 --> 1:58:12.720]  theory of the universe i don't know if we have enough time to really get into it
[1:58:12.720 --> 1:58:15.720]  you know what shirt shirt no no this is important as we got a guest come up in
[1:58:15.720 --> 1:58:17.240]  about twenty minutes but i
[1:58:17.240 --> 1:58:19.920]  i want to get to these calls i promise we'll get to dan drew
[1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:21.920]  david james and john be ready
[1:58:21.920 --> 1:58:25.080]  but uh... i'm gonna get my reveros take on this
[1:58:25.080 --> 1:58:26.180]  yeah hawking
[1:58:26.180 --> 1:58:33.180]  just says he hopes everything will be okay
[1:58:33.180 --> 1:58:35.800]  thank you for listening to gcn

[1:58:41.880 --> 1:58:44.320]  it is a big idea
[1:58:44.320 --> 1:58:46.120]  a new world order
[1:58:46.120 --> 1:58:47.920]  in the near future
[1:58:47.920 --> 1:58:50.920]  uh... this time
[1:58:50.920 --> 1:58:53.920]  it's known as
[1:58:53.920 --> 1:58:56.680]  but their objective
[1:58:56.680 --> 1:58:59.720]  for thousands of years their dark order group
[1:58:59.720 --> 1:59:04.080]  now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream of
[1:59:04.080 --> 1:59:10.160]  exterminating eighty percent of humanity is at hand
[1:59:10.160 --> 1:59:11.920]  for the first time in history
[1:59:11.920 --> 1:59:15.640]  the elites plan for world government is blown wide open
[1:59:15.640 --> 1:59:19.520]  you will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda
[1:59:19.520 --> 1:59:22.080]  bill bergis make great progress for the world
[1:59:22.080 --> 1:59:25.320]  most people have no idea they're not after money they have all the money they need
[1:59:25.320 --> 1:59:27.400]  they're after power

[1:59:44.120 --> 1:59:46.440]  waging war on corruption
[1:59:46.440 --> 1:59:53.440]  alex jones on the gcm radio networks
[1:59:55.880 --> 1:59:57.640]  government cover-ups
[1:59:57.640 --> 1:59:59.200]  you want answers
[1:59:59.200 --> 2:00:00.760]  well so does he
[2:00:00.760 --> 2:00:05.760]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:00:05.760 --> 2:00:08.120]  live from austin texas
[2:00:08.120 --> 2:00:10.280]  alex jones
[2:00:10.280 --> 2:00:14.320]  we're already in the hour number three your calls here momentarily
[2:00:14.320 --> 2:00:18.320]  but a physicist coming on to talk about the dangers of this
[2:00:18.320 --> 2:00:19.440]  heavy
[2:00:19.440 --> 2:00:22.960]  reactor this super conducting super collider
[2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:24.240]  over in europe
[2:00:24.240 --> 2:00:26.920]  they've just completed and about to start playing with the building blocks the
[2:00:26.920 --> 2:00:28.440]  universe
[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:33.040]  a lot of prestigious for sister warning it's very dangerous
[2:00:33.040 --> 2:00:36.640]  they have already made black holes in some of these laboratories but these are
[2:00:36.640 --> 2:00:40.800]  even bigger and more dangerous types that they admit can be made
[2:00:40.800 --> 2:00:43.800]  talking to microvaro finishing up with your take on that mike and we're gonna
[2:00:43.800 --> 2:00:45.240]  go calls
[2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:49.560]  well but basically the the idea that black holes are going to evaporate i'm
[2:00:49.560 --> 2:00:52.360]  not sure what they're creating in the laboratory and one of the things to keep
[2:00:52.360 --> 2:00:53.200]  in mind is
[2:00:53.200 --> 2:00:55.680]  at the energy levels that they're talking about
[2:00:55.680 --> 2:00:59.920]  that this device is operating they may not be finding new subatomic particles
[2:00:59.920 --> 2:01:01.920]  they may be creating them
[2:01:01.920 --> 2:01:05.240]  uh... and and there's a disconnect no no that's what they say no they say they
[2:01:05.240 --> 2:01:06.480]  want to make them
[2:01:06.480 --> 2:01:09.920]  they admit this new my mega reactor does that
[2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:14.160]  and and the idea is these these particles may not exist in nature so what
[2:01:14.160 --> 2:01:15.760]  the value of creating them
[2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:19.400]  uh... is uh... you know we can't really not only say they've already made new
[2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:22.880]  ones you know twenty thirty years ago going back over forty they'd
[2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:26.160]  that they have those other systems that where they may have made new elements
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:27.760]  but but go ahead mike
[2:01:27.760 --> 2:01:32.160]  yeah i did the the idea is that you you know this is a very dangerous device
[2:01:32.160 --> 2:01:36.520]  week when you start getting into the idea of creating black black holes
[2:01:36.520 --> 2:01:39.680]  i i challenged the idea that somehow they just evaporate
[2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:44.000]  uh... because uh... the reason that it's claimed they simply evaporate
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:48.360]  is because if you subscribe to the theory of the big bang in that moment
[2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:51.240]  where the universe came into being
[2:01:51.240 --> 2:01:55.140]  the uh... math entity was so great they should have been all
[2:01:55.140 --> 2:01:58.080]  with huge clouds of little tiny black hole
[2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:02.220]  you know plant-sized one centimeter size one subatomic sized one
[2:02:02.220 --> 2:02:05.680]  and eventually the whole universe would become instead of one gigantic black
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:09.920]  hole at the beginning a lot of smaller black holes over the universe we didn't
[2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:11.560]  see this happen to the question is
[2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:14.720]  where do all these black holes that had to attend the creation of the universe
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:18.000]  go to make it all well they simply evaporated
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:21.720]  but this is kind of like the theory of epicycles when they began to look at the
[2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:25.760]  planet and realize they didn't follow the path that the earth centered
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:29.520]  uh... universe theory said they should instead of going back and looking at that
[2:02:29.520 --> 2:02:33.120]  first theory they made up the theory of epicycles which ultimately turned out to
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:34.080]  be fake
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:38.160]  if they create a real black hole in this collider
[2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:42.040]  i'm not reassured it's going to simply evaporate and of course there's no way
[2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:44.000]  to hang on to something like that
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:47.400]  if they drop they create a real black hole and they drop it
[2:02:47.400 --> 2:02:50.760]  basically that you know that that's the death warrant on the earth it may take a
[2:02:50.760 --> 2:02:53.960]  while it's going to go to the core of the earth and suck the planet into it
[2:02:53.960 --> 2:02:58.120]  yeah and it's really risky for them to be doing this
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:01.560]  uh... and i know they've made the claim that they've created tiny black holes
[2:03:01.560 --> 2:03:03.800]  that uh... vanished instantaneously
[2:03:03.800 --> 2:03:05.800]  i'm not sure they really did
[2:03:05.800 --> 2:03:09.960]  because you know once you have a map that is in a black hole state
[2:03:09.960 --> 2:03:15.400]  by what means is that master energy ever able to escape it
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:18.840]  so you can ask your physicist guest about that and uh... i would love to be
[2:03:18.840 --> 2:03:19.880]  enlightened
[2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:21.200]  but i am not
[2:03:21.200 --> 2:03:25.040]  absolutely reassured that a genuine black hole created in the laboratory is
[2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:28.320]  simply going to pop out of existence
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:31.960]  you know they talk about them decaying if they don't get enough mass sucked into
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:32.720]  them
[2:03:32.720 --> 2:03:35.480]  but you would imagine that the big bang was gonna be plenty of
[2:03:35.480 --> 2:03:38.200]  matter to be sucked into the black holes
[2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:40.440]  to make them larger more powerful
[2:03:40.440 --> 2:03:44.080]  plus if it if it got so dancing then exploded
[2:03:44.080 --> 2:03:47.680]  why didn't it immediately start contracting again but i uh...
[2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:50.880]  again you know that there are a lot of reasons to really question that whole
[2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:52.240]  big bang theory
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:03:56.320]  and by extension to question any assumptions made on the basis of it
[2:03:56.320 --> 2:03:59.800]  but uh... you know again i'm not paid to be a physicist or i haven't well i know
[2:03:59.800 --> 2:04:01.600]  that these things as well
[2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:06.600]  and i mean again ht wells ninety five years ago wrote books about a bombs
[2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:09.780]  it shows that a lot of the stuffs on the books before they do it
[2:04:09.780 --> 2:04:12.960]  and a lot of visitors saying it's gonna make black holes and they believe it's
[2:04:12.960 --> 2:04:16.440]  going to destroy the earth and they're saying yeah it'll probably make one but
[2:04:16.440 --> 2:04:20.800]  but it'll just decay because of his the equation show this
[2:04:20.800 --> 2:04:25.040]  uh... well you know the equation showed that uh... epicycles would work too but
[2:04:25.040 --> 2:04:29.160]  the equations don't reflect reality they just reflect this model
[2:04:29.160 --> 2:04:33.080]  and sometimes the models are accurate and sometimes they are not i mean don't
[2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:37.000]  forget we went to a rock with all these pentagon computer mathematical models
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:39.760]  how easy it was going to be to win there
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:43.000]  well they use a lot of models on the global warming front to stay there i

[2:08:08.960 --> 2:08:12.960]  okay we're back live ladies and gentlemen
[2:08:13.120 --> 2:08:19.200]  taking your calls dan in new york city you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:08:19.200 --> 2:08:24.400]  um on yeah on the subject of life extension technology um
[2:08:24.400 --> 2:08:27.840]  to extend life you obviously need to be free of disease so
[2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:32.000]  i just wanted to know your opinions on the uh... clinical research of uh...
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:36.720]  dr royal reyman rife and in the ability to be able to cure most microbial
[2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:39.760]  diseases um by hitting them with uh... resident
[2:08:39.760 --> 2:08:43.040]  frequency that it was that he would so so called
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:47.440]  was claimed to do back in the 1930s okay let me give you my answer to that
[2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:52.000]  i am not a physician either western medicine or eastern medicine
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:55.840]  i have interviewed hundreds and hundreds of medical experts who've
[2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:00.240]  actually proven what they talk about uh... let me be clear
[2:09:00.240 --> 2:09:03.520]  uh... royal reyman rife was a weirdo
[2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:07.600]  uh... he certainly was a talented individual
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:14.880]  but uh... i'm not saying that he was wrong i'm not saying he was right
[2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:19.440]  uh... i certainly we know that they have frequencies and might be able to use
[2:09:19.440 --> 2:09:22.960]  frequencies uh... and there even are some treatments
[2:09:22.960 --> 2:09:27.120]  medically uh... with different types of sonars and things to try to break things
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:31.920]  up but there's no doubt that many of the quacks
[2:09:31.920 --> 2:09:35.360]  that then sell for two thousand three thousand four thousand dollars and they'll
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:39.680]  sell cds for a thousand dollars you plan a computer that flashes lights on the
[2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:43.360]  screen and plays music i'm not here to be predatory
[2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:46.400]  i push things i believe in guns gold food
[2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:50.240]  uh... silver uh... water filters uh...
[2:09:50.240 --> 2:09:53.680]  you know when everybody knows that aloe vera is good for your good for you
[2:09:53.680 --> 2:09:57.920]  i mean i grew up you know getting burns uh... and then learned and made it feel
[2:09:57.920 --> 2:10:01.440]  better when ice cube didn't and and so uh...
[2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:04.640]  because the mainstream media lies and spends so much
[2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:08.400]  we then tend to think that all the alternative media is telling the truth
[2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:11.200]  and what it is is a lot of people
[2:10:11.200 --> 2:10:14.640]  taking advantage of the well-meaning
[2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:18.560]  patriots now do should we censor these these quacks no
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:22.400]  uh... because once you start censorship then they can use that on good people
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:26.800]  uh... but i am people criticize me get upset when i say it's absolute bull
[2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:31.280]  it is absolutely bull these little things you stick on cell phones a little
[2:10:31.280 --> 2:10:35.360]  sticker that supposedly blocks the cell phone radiation at or or changes the
[2:10:35.360 --> 2:10:40.000]  frequency total bull and uh...
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:41.360]  i'm sick of it
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:43.280]  and i might revere
[2:10:43.280 --> 2:10:46.080]  well absolutely agree there's a lot of uh... there's a lot of
[2:10:46.080 --> 2:10:47.760]  flummary going on out there
[2:10:47.760 --> 2:10:50.720]  uh... but as far as the issue of life extension into the
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:54.160]  uh... i think we place too much emphasis on getting rid of all microbial
[2:10:54.160 --> 2:10:55.440]  diseases because
[2:10:55.440 --> 2:10:57.760]  it's part of our natural process
[2:10:57.760 --> 2:11:00.080]  that uh... you know our immune system
[2:11:00.080 --> 2:11:03.920]  need these small infections in order to strengthen itself and make it more able
[2:11:03.920 --> 2:11:04.720]  to deal
[2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:07.520]  with uh... more serious diseases down the road
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:10.880]  and it's kind of interesting there's an anecdotal correlation
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:14.800]  uh... for people who have lived the longest into their to the hundreds
[2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:18.240]  to have gone through uh... you know period of extreme ill health when they're
[2:11:18.240 --> 2:11:21.840]  very very young same thing with rats same thing with rats
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:26.000]  your starvation yet yet folks it's your genetic code that kills you
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:29.120]  we're designed to die to make room for the next group
[2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:32.400]  we're also mammals we have a lot higher exchange level
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:35.680]  of hormones that's why sharks don't get cancer we do
[2:11:35.680 --> 2:11:39.920]  uh... we're dynamic creatures were warm blooded mike you want to explain that
[2:11:39.920 --> 2:11:43.760]  yeah they basically uh... yeah we're programmed to self-destruct
[2:11:43.760 --> 2:11:46.720]  because life forms that don't self-destruct
[2:11:46.720 --> 2:11:51.280]  uh... tend to exhaust their food supply and become extinct very very quickly
[2:11:51.280 --> 2:11:55.600]  and so uh... we have evolved a population control measure
[2:11:55.600 --> 2:11:58.800]  which is that you know we eventually die off and and
[2:11:58.800 --> 2:12:02.720]  make way for the uh... one to come afterwards let me explain folks
[2:12:02.720 --> 2:12:06.080]  let me explain it is a design for the species
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:09.760]  you see we we are here for the species health that's why people that think
[2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:12.800]  they're islands under themselves are fools
[2:12:12.800 --> 2:12:17.280]  we are designed in the species you're not happy till you're helping the species
[2:12:17.280 --> 2:12:21.200]  you were designed to serve the species mike
[2:12:21.200 --> 2:12:25.120]  yeah and the other thing to remember is that uh...
[2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:28.960]  if there really was a way to extend life significantly it's never going to be
[2:12:28.960 --> 2:12:32.000]  allowed under the general public that would trigger an immediate
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:37.120]  population explosion and a a malthusian it's going to be kept secret they are
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:40.560]  getting radical extension systems but they're finding more and more
[2:12:40.560 --> 2:12:44.080]  that the elites are going to be able to extend life but not indefinitely but
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:47.200]  they will be able to genetically mess with our dna
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:51.280]  uh... and to turn off the mechanisms that do that mike
[2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:54.880]  yeah but again it will not have to be done at the cellular level pre
[2:12:54.880 --> 2:12:59.760]  uh... pre gestation correct uh... i'm not a hundred percent certain it's
[2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:02.880]  going to remain that way we're starting to see gene therapies that allow for
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:07.040]  modification in matured uh... organism i meant that's the massive
[2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:09.920]  extension but i mean to really have something that doesn't die for thousands
[2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:12.240]  of years with the current template we've got
[2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:16.240]  you're gonna have to have uh... manipulation at the you know before
[2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:19.840]  the zygote level with the sperm in the egg to make those genetics
[2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:24.400]  work together yes that's correct we're already digressing let's go to drew
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:27.840]  in florida you're on the air drew
[2:13:27.840 --> 2:13:31.360]  hello yesterday go ahead you're on the air they're good sir
[2:13:31.360 --> 2:13:34.480]  well you guys have some great topics where to begin
[2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:38.400]  i called to talk about nine eleven and one topic here to my heart is actually
[2:13:38.400 --> 2:13:41.520]  the creation of the universe uh... so i'd
[2:13:41.520 --> 2:13:46.000]  love to ask questions about that but i i think i need to stick to nine eleven
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:49.680]  my question is early in two thousand six
[2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:53.520]  i unfortunately became involved with investigating katrina
[2:13:53.520 --> 2:13:57.040]  more specifically i became interested in research regarding
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:00.800]  the levy system i come to find out through several people at the army
[2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:04.720]  corps of engineer that basically the levies were detonated
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:08.400]  all right well they blow them up they blow them up in the twenties before
[2:14:08.400 --> 2:14:13.680]  right with my thing is i actually had didn't have a problem with that
[2:14:13.680 --> 2:14:18.800]  what i found out was a company very specifically a company called cd i
[2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:22.960]  controlled demolition incorporated with the company that physically did the
[2:14:22.960 --> 2:14:25.680]  actual detonation well i don't know about that but i'd like to hear your
[2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:27.840]  proof we know they did oklahoma city
[2:14:27.840 --> 2:14:30.880]  and the world trade center but i think my point is
[2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:35.840]  i knew nothing about cd i before two thousand and six nothing
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:40.480]  i never even knew what that was then it took me about five minutes with a
[2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:43.440]  research to know that they have their creepy little pause
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:47.040]  in absolutely every single questionable demolition
[2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:52.160]  over the last hundred years then i realized
[2:14:52.160 --> 2:14:55.840]  what were they doing in my question this is really a big question
[2:14:55.840 --> 2:15:00.080]  what was cd i controlled demolition incorporated doing
[2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:04.000]  in new york city for six weeks prior to nine eleven
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:07.600]  i'd like your thoughts on that well they even bought a major uh... steel
[2:15:07.600 --> 2:15:11.760]  smelting facility six months before in new york
[2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:16.240]  and what even contracting with truck companies previously for masses of steel
[2:15:16.240 --> 2:15:20.480]  and they are always the company uh... that is hired to cover up the crime
[2:15:20.480 --> 2:15:24.240]  scenes and then post-arm guards around at microbarrow
[2:15:24.240 --> 2:15:28.800]  yeah absolutely they came in and uh... going back to the oklahoma city bombing
[2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:32.000]  uh... there was uh... that strange double pulse
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  on the seismic wave that uh... came out from the original bombing of the mirror
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:39.120]  building and then when the control demolition
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:42.640]  uh... took the remains of the building down i noted how they deliberately
[2:15:42.640 --> 2:15:46.880]  brought it down in two chunks to try and create a
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:51.040]  similar double pulse wave but all they really did was confirm that there had to
[2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:54.160]  be two separate events uh... regarded to the oklahoma
[2:15:54.160 --> 2:15:56.960]  building when uh... when the first attack took place
[2:15:56.960 --> 2:16:00.720]  which seems consistent with the idea that there were in fact cutter charges
[2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:02.960]  inside the mirror building that were detonated
[2:16:02.960 --> 2:16:06.880]  about uh... five seconds before the main truck bomb went off
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:09.200]  uh... but yeah they're they're definitely involved in all of these
[2:16:09.200 --> 2:16:13.440]  situations they were right there in new york uh... and uh... yeah they they're
[2:16:13.440 --> 2:16:16.480]  very much seem to be part and parcel to a lot of these very questionable
[2:16:16.480 --> 2:16:21.200]  cleanups i have now trace c d i over the last two years
[2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:25.840]  to over two dozen mysterious detonations from china
[2:16:25.840 --> 2:16:31.520]  to russia to the congo indonesia all over north america
[2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:34.880]  and i knew not well go back how does you track them i want to hear your proof
[2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:37.920]  how does you track them and we know who they are we know they're very wicked
[2:16:37.920 --> 2:16:42.720]  but i mean how did you track them back uh... to uh... the levees
[2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:48.000]  well i was there i was at the levee system i was there with several people
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:52.880]  who told me they can't tell me under some kind of the borrow strict oath
[2:16:52.880 --> 2:16:57.920]  which okay whatever and then the name c d i kept coming up
[2:16:57.920 --> 2:17:01.920]  well that didn't mean anything to me it didn't mean anything until after i
[2:17:01.920 --> 2:17:06.160]  realized where this company and well listen write it up in an article
[2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:10.160]  with proof and we'll post it appreciate the call uh... david in montana you're
[2:17:10.160 --> 2:17:13.440]  on the air last call we have time for for microvaro
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:17.520]  howdy uh... well i don't want to get your subject but i did want to talk to
[2:17:17.520 --> 2:17:21.600]  you about something about the second amendment case is being heard by the
[2:17:21.600 --> 2:17:25.600]  supreme court yeah it's a gun they're gonna rule for gun control spin it as a
[2:17:25.600 --> 2:17:30.080]  pro-gun ruling i'll go ahead uh... montana secretary
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:34.640]  of state brad johnson has sent a letter to the supreme court
[2:17:34.640 --> 2:17:37.680]  that guns are legal in his state under the compact
[2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:41.920]  which each party agreed to when montana joined the union in eighteen eighty nine
[2:17:41.920 --> 2:17:43.840]  what's his name i want to get him on
[2:17:43.840 --> 2:17:48.000]  brad johnson he's the montana secretary of state
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:52.240]  now that letter was signed by multiple
[2:17:52.240 --> 2:17:55.920]  house and senate reps here in montana along with
[2:17:55.920 --> 2:18:00.960]  our washington dc rep denny reberg and included in that letter
[2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:06.400]  says that if the supreme court ruling says that the second amendment writes
[2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:11.360]  apply only collectively it would violate the contract under which montana has
[2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:14.160]  entered the union at the state
[2:18:14.160 --> 2:18:17.680]  meaning that you know it would it would uh... we got a job
[2:18:17.680 --> 2:18:21.280]  mike you know them going after our guns they just aren't gonna stop pushing are
[2:18:21.280 --> 2:18:25.120]  they mike you know they aren't because uh... you know if in order to
[2:18:25.120 --> 2:18:28.240]  to feel secure in their power they're gonna have to render the american people
[2:18:28.240 --> 2:18:31.280]  completely helpless and that's more than just constant surveillance and
[2:18:31.280 --> 2:18:33.360]  listening to our phone calls and reading our mail
[2:18:33.360 --> 2:18:37.280]  they've got to take away the guns uh... otherwise you know at some point when
[2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:40.640]  we do get angry uh... you know we're gonna fight back
[2:18:40.640 --> 2:18:44.240]  right now the u.s. government is in so much debt the only way they can even
[2:18:44.240 --> 2:18:48.320]  think to to float their loans along is to put an eighty to ninety percent
[2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:52.720]  aggregate tax rate on every american citizen and we're already dying here to
[2:18:52.720 --> 2:18:56.000]  fifty percent aggregate rate so yeah they're trying to figure out some way
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:19:00.080]  to to trick us into giving up the guns
[2:19:00.080 --> 2:19:03.360]  but they're really saying the economy's melting down there now admitting it that
[2:19:03.360 --> 2:19:07.440]  that means it'll probably accelerate the precipitation of the collapse
[2:19:07.440 --> 2:19:10.160]  uh... i would i would definitely say that there's nothing they can do that's
[2:19:10.160 --> 2:19:13.840]  going to turn the economy around because economies are always based on making
[2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:17.680]  products and we gave that ability away over the last thirty years we're not
[2:19:17.680 --> 2:19:20.400]  going to get it back overnight that's right they can save wall street with
[2:19:20.400 --> 2:19:23.920]  only nothing left that is the absolutely right and they're gonna save
[2:19:23.920 --> 2:19:28.160]  wall street at our expense what really happened dot com mike it's always

[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:38.800]  l wagner he was quoted heavily in the new york times
[2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:42.480]  article asking a judge to save the world or more
[2:24:42.480 --> 2:24:50.000]  in their science section he's got degrees in physics and biology
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:54.560]  working with other physicists concerned about not just superconducting
[2:24:54.560 --> 2:25:00.320]  super colliders but other devices that the different
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:05.360]  nuclear engineers and others are doing raw research with and i
[2:25:05.360 --> 2:25:09.760]  remember 20 years ago reading scientific papers with top
[2:25:09.760 --> 2:25:12.880]  physicists worried about these they could create black holes or they could
[2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:15.760]  create any matter chain reactions they could create
[2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:20.640]  unknown particles and it's just russian roulette and they're doing thousands
[2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:25.040]  of tests a year on these different colliders alone
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:28.320]  and so we are honored to have mr wagner on with us
[2:25:28.320 --> 2:25:32.160]  he and a colleague are suing because they haven't even done basic environmental
[2:25:32.160 --> 2:25:37.200]  assessments that you'd need to put a septic tank in at your house
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:44.240]  much less to have these star trek type systems working it is 2008 remember
[2:25:44.240 --> 2:25:47.040]  by 1910 max plank and others have come up with
[2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:54.880]  equations for abombs so uh we're in 2008 so this is very advanced now
[2:25:54.880 --> 2:25:58.320]  and again we are joined by walter wagner
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:02.240]  a graduate of uc berkeley thank you for coming on with a certain
[2:26:02.240 --> 2:26:05.840]  certainly alec thank you first off tell us a little bit about yourself how you
[2:26:05.840 --> 2:26:09.360]  got interested in this and why you're taking action against it and then
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:12.400]  there's a lot of big wigs that are saying this is dangerous as well not just
[2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:16.400]  you well there are a number of people other than myself who have
[2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:20.960]  raised the same concerns and similar concerns they don't
[2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:25.040]  come to the forefront of the attention of the media as
[2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:29.440]  as i have but that doesn't mean they don't have the same concerns
[2:26:29.440 --> 2:26:34.240]  my background started off at uc berkeley i was a physics major there
[2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:37.920]  initially my senior year i switched to became a biology
[2:26:37.920 --> 2:26:42.240]  major primarily for economic reasons i could graduate sooner that way
[2:26:42.240 --> 2:26:45.600]  i went back into work in physics and cosmic radiation physics
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:50.400]  at berkeley for a couple years i had some interesting experimental results
[2:26:50.400 --> 2:26:54.560]  found a particle that's right you're famous you found you found a new
[2:26:54.560 --> 2:26:58.640]  particle yeah that's that's correct it it
[2:26:58.640 --> 2:27:02.240]  made the news media at the time was all over the world
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:05.600]  it was published a peer reviewed article and so forth
[2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:09.760]  and it's not been confirmed as yet as of yet at least not satisfactorily
[2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:14.640]  confirmed uh but uh doesn't detract from that was a high altitude balloon
[2:27:14.640 --> 2:27:18.800]  correct that is absolutely correct picking up a space space particle before
[2:27:18.800 --> 2:27:23.680]  it decayed um exactly exactly the the particle
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:27.600]  that was detected we believed it was a magnetic monopole
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:30.880]  it was a cosmic ray the particle track that we saw that was completely
[2:27:30.880 --> 2:27:33.680]  different from all the tens of thousands of other cosmic ray tracks we
[2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:37.040]  previously seen interesting please continue
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:42.400]  well anyway i i after that i decided to uh almost on a lark to do law school for
[2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:47.520]  uh see what that was like uh and uh so i spent three years struggling through
[2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:50.560]  law school and then got out of that decided not what i wanted to do i went
[2:27:50.560 --> 2:27:55.520]  back into work in physics and worked in uh nuclear medicine out of a
[2:27:55.520 --> 2:27:59.040]  nuclear medicine department in health physics where we were using
[2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:04.880]  large varieties of radioactive materials and medical research
[2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:09.120]  uh and uh i overviewed the program for about 400
[2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:12.880]  authorized users uh to make certain that they were following
[2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:15.840]  the rules regulations properly they understood the physics of the other
[2:28:15.840 --> 2:28:20.160]  radioactive materials and so you've worked in a wide wide range of
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:22.800]  fields when did you start getting concerned about
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:26.320]  these giant superconducting super colliders and some of the tests they
[2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:30.560]  were doing it was about 1987 uh first became concerned
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:34.160]  about it i had initially been very much in favor of building a
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:38.400]  larger uh machines back then they were not colliders they were uh
[2:28:38.400 --> 2:28:41.440]  fixed target accelerators where you have just a single beam running into a
[2:28:41.440 --> 2:28:45.920]  target uh and then i started uh thinking about
[2:28:45.920 --> 2:28:51.120]  what ultimately could happen uh is or started considering the possibility
[2:28:51.120 --> 2:28:56.400]  that if you continue to increase the energy of these beams uh that
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:29:00.400]  eventually you might be able to create a very small tiny black hole
[2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:04.400]  and uh i didn't know what that threshold would be that it would take
[2:29:04.400 --> 2:29:08.800]  to do that um i had let me just stop you are these the same type of black holes
[2:29:08.800 --> 2:29:12.080]  uh that they collect well stay there we'll come right back because i have
[2:29:12.080 --> 2:29:15.040]  ap scientists create artificial black hole in lab
[2:29:15.040 --> 2:29:18.880]  and it says they were using a collider to do this you i found out
[2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:22.480]  like 15 years ago had said that this might happen and now they're saying
[2:29:22.480 --> 2:29:26.080]  they've actually made them or is that a different type of black hole
[2:29:26.080 --> 2:29:29.440]  we'll be right back with our guests talk about the dangers
[2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:33.200]  of these type of systems on the other side of this quick break right here on

[2:33:41.200 --> 2:33:45.360]  but we need to be careful and we're talking to a gentleman who's a
[2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:48.320]  physicist biologist worked in many different fields
[2:33:48.320 --> 2:33:52.000]  and they follow a lawsuit to block uh... the biggest
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:54.880]  superconducting supercollider in the world i guess
[2:33:54.880 --> 2:33:59.120]  the that's the modern name uh... from the primitive cyclotrons
[2:33:59.120 --> 2:34:02.240]  uh... but where they can even create new elements
[2:34:02.240 --> 2:34:06.000]  please continue sir just the basics of these why you believe they're dangerous
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:08.800]  there's a lot of other experts that also think
[2:34:08.800 --> 2:34:12.160]  uh... that is dangerous as well yes uh...
[2:34:12.160 --> 2:34:16.880]  well maybe they are cyclotrons and uh... what they have done uh... now is
[2:34:16.880 --> 2:34:20.320]  they've uh... instead of running the uh... beam of the
[2:34:20.320 --> 2:34:23.840]  of the cyclotron into a fixed target they now run the beam into each other
[2:34:23.840 --> 2:34:27.680]  head on and they are increasing amount of energy that's available for new
[2:34:27.680 --> 2:34:31.840]  particle production and that's the entire purpose of this is to try to
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:36.800]  create new particle uh... and this uh... lhc
[2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:41.440]  machine is going to be the most energetic particle collider ever built
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:45.040]  it's basically it's about the size of the superconducting supercollider that
[2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:49.760]  was under construction there in texas uh... that was in uh... stopped uh...
[2:34:49.760 --> 2:34:53.920]  for financial primarily reasons uh... it's it's uh...
[2:34:53.920 --> 2:34:57.600]  being built by the same people in essence it's the uh... Fermilab
[2:34:57.600 --> 2:35:02.480]  people who have constructed the magnet why did darpa and the defense department
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:06.160]  decide to not do it in the u.s. why did they move to the u
[2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:09.760]  uh... i i think it was financial reasons
[2:35:09.760 --> 2:35:13.520]  uh... they had to start from scratch uh... digging the tunnel and so forth
[2:35:13.520 --> 2:35:17.600]  uh... the one in uh... there was already an existing tunnel from a previous
[2:35:17.600 --> 2:35:22.560]  electron positron collider uh... already in existence in switchlet so they
[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:26.560]  uh... they scrapped that machine took out all of the it's uh...
[2:35:26.560 --> 2:35:30.240]  works and they've uh... used the same tunnel so that saves a quite a lot of
[2:35:30.240 --> 2:35:33.920]  money and uh... so but they're using the exact
[2:35:33.920 --> 2:35:38.160]  same superconducting magnets uh... built by Fermilab
[2:35:38.160 --> 2:35:42.160]  and that that's one of the reasons why Fermilab is named as one of the
[2:35:42.160 --> 2:35:45.840]  defendants and that's what gives uh... the u.s. courts jurisdiction over the
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:49.760]  case uh... but the back to the uh... colliders by
[2:35:49.760 --> 2:35:52.800]  colliding these beams head on into each other you are able to
[2:35:52.800 --> 2:35:56.080]  create or generate far more energy available
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:36:00.320]  for particle production and they are hoping to create new kinds of particles
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:03.840]  it's sometimes called the god machine because one of the particles
[2:36:03.840 --> 2:36:07.680]  uh... that they are looking to create is uh... has been called the
[2:36:07.680 --> 2:36:12.560]  god particle of the Higgs boson uh... there are other particles that they
[2:36:12.560 --> 2:36:16.400]  think they might be able to create tell the listeners what a Higgs boson is
[2:36:16.400 --> 2:36:22.240]  oh uh... it's it's a there's a field uh... it's a field theory that would
[2:36:22.240 --> 2:36:26.320]  uh... scribe of the reason for all other particles having
[2:36:26.320 --> 2:36:31.040]  the property of math and uh... so they they believe that there is a
[2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:34.400]  fundamental carrier for that field called the Higgs boson
[2:36:34.400 --> 2:36:37.920]  and now let's boil this down uh... with primitive
[2:36:37.920 --> 2:36:41.280]  hundred-year-old equations hundred-year-old ladies and gentlemen
[2:36:41.280 --> 2:36:45.600]  they are able to make a bombs with sixty-year-old equations are able to
[2:36:45.600 --> 2:36:48.320]  create hydrogen bombs and that is colliding
[2:36:48.320 --> 2:36:51.840]  particles with each other and so we bring this to another scale
[2:36:51.840 --> 2:36:55.440]  now not just firing particles into blocks of lead or gold or whatever
[2:36:55.440 --> 2:36:59.520]  now they're accelerating them unknown into each other please continue
[2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:05.200]  uh... yes uh... the uh... the l.a.t.c. is going to accelerate lead atoms
[2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:09.520]  uh... and run run away to each other head-on uh... much like two cars running
[2:37:09.520 --> 2:37:13.760]  into head-on each other head-on they will be caused to stop right there at the
[2:37:13.760 --> 2:37:18.080]  center of the machine uh... relatively stationary relative to earth
[2:37:18.080 --> 2:37:22.480]  and that's the problem uh... in nature with these high energy particles
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:26.720]  come streaming in and hit uh... the upper atmosphere for example
[2:37:26.720 --> 2:37:30.480]  anything that's new that's created keeps on going through the earth at the
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:33.760]  speed of light and uh... it has a very very short
[2:37:33.760 --> 2:37:37.280]  period of time transiting the earth about a quarter of a second
[2:37:37.280 --> 2:37:40.240]  uh... and and uh... under the theories of
[2:37:40.240 --> 2:37:44.080]  some of these particles uh... for example the micro black hole
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:47.200]  it it takes a long while for them to start accreting
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:51.920]  uh... atoms uh... days hours uh...
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:57.520]  and by creating one of that rest it gives it that opportunity to do that it
[2:37:57.520 --> 2:38:00.960]  would be captured by earth gravity would remain in the earth let's explain
[2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:04.640]  we have we have high mass particles being accelerated each other
[2:38:04.640 --> 2:38:08.640]  they're going to be sitting there able with their own gravitational pull to
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:12.960]  begin accruing mass well they would not so much from
[2:38:12.960 --> 2:38:16.880]  its own gravitational attraction accrete mass it would just be by physical
[2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:20.640]  contact by touching something anything it would touch would become part of it
[2:38:20.640 --> 2:38:22.880]  it would become part of the black hole
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:27.280]  and so in nature if they travel travel through the earth and they touch a
[2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:30.960]  single atom in the process of doing that it will capture that atom and then
[2:38:30.960 --> 2:38:34.240]  exit through the earth and will be done the way because it's it's been
[2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:38.320]  accelerated naturally by the it's going at the speed of light
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:41.920]  naturally here we're trying to create them at rest
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:46.480]  uh... not moving and uh... now does this tie in to them
[2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:51.040]  because i said again i saw you back in the late uh... eighties early nineties
[2:38:51.040 --> 2:38:54.400]  uh... mid nineties but you know talking about this could make black holes back
[2:38:54.400 --> 2:38:57.200]  then and others agreeing with you other physicists
[2:38:57.200 --> 2:39:00.560]  uh... now they claim that they've made black holes or is that a separate
[2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:04.400]  uh... thing that as that the rick and they've created they said they've created
[2:39:04.400 --> 2:39:08.000]  something that has the similar properties to a black hole
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:12.880]  uh... but uh... it wasn't a black hole per se it was actually a quart glue on
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:16.000]  plasma which would be a precursor to a creation of
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:18.480]  a different kind of a particle called a strange look
[2:39:18.480 --> 2:39:21.920]  and that's another possibility that they uh... it could create
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:25.600]  uh... strange looks uh... by the colliding the lead nuclei into each other
[2:39:25.600 --> 2:39:27.680]  that's something that doesn't occur in nature
[2:39:27.680 --> 2:39:31.360]  in nature you have a high energy proton striking the earth
[2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:36.800]  uh... and uh... what the this LHC machine will do is will have high energy
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:40.160]  lead nuclei running into each other head on that just never happens in nature
[2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:42.880]  now now i'm just a novice here but i've been reading over what other scientists
[2:39:42.880 --> 2:39:46.960]  and physicists are worried about what about it just creating new particles
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:50.400]  that react to me and they they say they don't know what it's going to make
[2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:54.240]  uh... if they continue to smash these into each other's that infant item
[2:39:54.240 --> 2:39:57.120]  what about creating i mean i know the air forces on record saying
[2:39:57.120 --> 2:40:01.440]  they've isolated any matter than they classified that
[2:40:01.440 --> 2:40:05.440]  well we don't know what other kinds of new particles that could be created that
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:10.080]  you're absolutely correct uh... you know i put on my thinking cap and i came up
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:12.720]  with the idea that maybe it'll create a black hole
[2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:16.080]  this is confirmed by a number of other theorists who said yes this is not so
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:18.320]  too far-fetched idea it might make it
[2:40:18.320 --> 2:40:21.120]  a black hole we don't know that it will but we don't know that well hawking
[2:40:21.120 --> 2:40:24.960]  agreed with you but he said it would fall apart why does he say that
[2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:28.960]  well he's got a theory that uh...
[2:40:28.960 --> 2:40:32.960]  quantum fluctuations in the vacuum would allow for some of the
[2:40:32.960 --> 2:40:37.840]  uh... a particle fall into a macro black hole while the other one escapes
[2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:41.440]  and that this could possibly allow them to evaporate
[2:40:41.440 --> 2:40:45.680]  and that uh... what the basically the safety review
[2:40:45.680 --> 2:40:48.880]  that was done previously for the elite c
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:51.600]  said well we don't have to worry about these micro black holes because we know
[2:40:51.600 --> 2:40:52.800]  they will evaporate
[2:40:52.800 --> 2:40:56.080]  well we don't know that they will evaporate that's a theory or an idea
[2:40:56.080 --> 2:40:59.360]  but hawking has admitted that he's been wrong about theories before
[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:02.320]  yes he has admitted that and and there are a number of theorists who believe
[2:41:02.320 --> 2:41:06.000]  that uh... this theory is wrong a flat out wrong not just you know it's a nice
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:08.960]  idea but it's flat out wrong for a number of other reasons
[2:41:08.960 --> 2:41:12.640]  uh... whether it's wrong or not i'm not i'm i don't know that i could say for
[2:41:12.640 --> 2:41:16.800]  a certain time tell us about a stranger tell us about a stranger
[2:41:16.800 --> 2:41:22.080]  uh... okay a stranger that is a kind of a particle that is one of the ones that
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:24.480]  they think they might be able to create
[2:41:24.480 --> 2:41:28.240]  uh... when you plan these two out of the beach other
[2:41:28.240 --> 2:41:32.000]  it creates what's called a quark blue oplasma the proton the neutrons are made
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  out of uh... quarks uh... quarks and down quarks
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:40.400]  uh... but when you put a plan together you they have about a thousand times
[2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:43.680]  more energy than the rest mass of the particle itself
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:47.600]  that allows it to create a lot more kind of quarks
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:51.440]  some of the kinds of quarks that would create that would be strange quarks
[2:41:51.440 --> 2:41:55.280]  it's believed that these can then rearrange themselves and form a new
[2:41:55.280 --> 2:41:59.200]  kind of a nucleus a new kind of atom called a stranger that's made out of
[2:41:59.200 --> 2:42:02.720]  up down and strange quarks and this new kind of atom is
[2:42:02.720 --> 2:42:09.120]  more stable than a normal atom and in other words if it touches a normal atom
[2:42:09.120 --> 2:42:13.600]  it will fuse with it release energy and become even larger and more stable
[2:42:13.600 --> 2:42:17.760]  this would allow for a chain reaction for it to continue to fuse with more and
[2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:20.400]  more atoms the process would uh...
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:23.600]  first be very slow it might take decades for this to
[2:42:23.600 --> 2:42:29.200]  uh... accumulate to the size of a p but eventually it would uh... it too would
[2:42:29.200 --> 2:42:32.000]  fall to the center of the earth because anything it touches it
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:34.800]  because part of it can't stop it from falling
[2:42:34.800 --> 2:42:38.400]  and so eventually it would grow larger larger inside the center of the earth
[2:42:38.400 --> 2:42:42.240]  and cause the our planet to explode they might not even discover it it could
[2:42:42.240 --> 2:42:45.280]  form in the hundreds of miles of tunnels anywhere
[2:42:45.280 --> 2:42:49.040]  and that's possible if it's neutral in charge when it's formed we would
[2:42:49.040 --> 2:42:53.600]  never detect it oh wonderful and and and the problem is i've been
[2:42:53.600 --> 2:42:57.040]  reading all weekend over the equations what other physicists are saying they
[2:42:57.040 --> 2:42:59.520]  they agree with you and become even more horrible
[2:42:59.520 --> 2:43:03.440]  scenarios and it seems that the more tests they do numbering in the thousands
[2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:07.760]  per collider the he just starts increasing the probability that
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:11.040]  something's going to happen well uh... that
[2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:15.920]  our concern is that there is no refutation of these theories that
[2:43:15.920 --> 2:43:18.640]  it's basically a plain russian roulette
[2:43:18.640 --> 2:43:21.280]  uh... and we don't know how many chambers there are
[2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:23.760]  uh... how many bullets we're putting in the chambers
[2:43:23.760 --> 2:43:29.120]  uh... and uh... so it's uh... it's uh... hoping that
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:33.600]  nothing goes wrong well it's the same thing but what while we look for
[2:43:33.600 --> 2:43:36.400]  more information about the universe you know that's what's called the god
[2:43:36.400 --> 2:43:39.040]  machine because they these people believe that this is more
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:42.480]  answer all of their questions well who are after a few questions
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:46.480]  to uh... and some questions it certainly won't answer all the other
[2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:50.080]  questions other scientists are working on why i say this it's too dangerous in
[2:43:50.080 --> 2:43:53.600]  the future of the species i mean if they want to develop some super
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:57.520]  expensive program in the future and take it out to the asteroid belt or
[2:43:57.520 --> 2:44:00.800]  something which still i know would make a safe but i mean they just don't need to
[2:44:00.800 --> 2:44:02.320]  be doing this on the planet
[2:44:02.320 --> 2:44:07.600]  you've got the same thing with gmo and the the these dna guns randomly firing
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:10.000]  into things already giving rise to super viruses
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:14.160]  they've got prehistoric viruses now i've had again double prize winners on about
[2:44:14.160 --> 2:44:17.040]  this coming out they just cover it up quietly
[2:44:17.040 --> 2:44:20.560]  and what is it about the scientific community that they're just pale male
[2:44:20.560 --> 2:44:24.080]  wildly just playing god had like sticking there
[2:44:24.080 --> 2:44:28.080]  you know what's in light sockets well it's a it's a certain degree you know
[2:44:28.080 --> 2:44:31.040]  that's one of the reasons we filed one of the affidavits was from a
[2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:35.680]  psychologist who actually has a background in uh... biochemistry
[2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:39.760]  and uh... and uh... astrophysics and but he's also professionally a
[2:44:39.760 --> 2:44:44.160]  psychologist and he's analyzed the psychology of it it's a desire in
[2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:48.320]  large part not only just to uh... find knowledge of the desire for selfishness
[2:44:48.320 --> 2:44:51.280]  to find out this knowledge for yourself it's gambling
[2:44:51.280 --> 2:44:55.360]  and and and willing to risk other people's lives to do it
[2:44:55.360 --> 2:44:58.960]  yeah i hadn't read his findings but it's power mad
[2:44:58.960 --> 2:45:04.000]  playing god control freak gambling yeah i agree
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:07.200]  and uh... that that's why we we filed a suit
[2:45:07.200 --> 2:45:11.520]  and that's why we want to have a thorough safety study that we can then
[2:45:11.520 --> 2:45:15.360]  evaluate criticize and take back to the court to hear the other flaws we've
[2:45:15.360 --> 2:45:18.240]  found in this safety well here's the problem if you don't stop them now
[2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:20.560]  it'll be bigger and bigger and bigger colliders and
[2:45:20.560 --> 2:45:23.600]  more and more energy and and then there are a lot of other weird
[2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:26.160]  uh... subatomic systems too aren't there
[2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:29.840]  there are already plans on the drawing board for even larger colliders they
[2:45:29.840 --> 2:45:32.800]  aren't even satisfied with you know they figured it well we won't find
[2:45:32.800 --> 2:45:35.200]  everything we need to know we need to make a bigger one
[2:45:35.200 --> 2:45:38.640]  so yes there are already plans for additional colliders in there
[2:45:38.640 --> 2:45:43.680]  and uh... international linear collider and so forth
[2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:47.360]  well i love technology and i want us to go to space and i believe a lot of money
[2:45:47.360 --> 2:45:49.600]  should be spent on it the problem is we have this
[2:45:49.600 --> 2:45:53.040]  our main sciences were taken over by your genesis two hundred years ago
[2:45:53.040 --> 2:45:55.840]  they have this elitist attitude they're in control now
[2:45:55.840 --> 2:45:59.680]  and frankly the they're nuts i mean you study the main line elite there they
[2:45:59.680 --> 2:46:00.240]  are
[2:46:00.240 --> 2:46:05.520]  nuttiered in the fruit cake and uh... i know you've been around them and and
[2:46:05.520 --> 2:46:08.560]  i mean i just don't understand why they're endangering everything
[2:46:08.560 --> 2:46:12.480]  humanity has built just just just just crazily i mean
[2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:16.240]  again look at chernobyl look at the atomic bomb that is
[2:46:16.240 --> 2:46:19.920]  ancient stuff comparatively our technologies doubling every
[2:46:19.920 --> 2:46:23.520]  few years what do you see this going well uh... i
[2:46:23.520 --> 2:46:26.480]  you know i don't want to necessarily criticize these people who have been
[2:46:26.480 --> 2:46:31.040]  bad scientists in that sense uh... i i think that they were well intentioned
[2:46:31.040 --> 2:46:34.080]  but misguided they they had they had a certain
[2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:39.120]  belief system uh... and uh... as that's been shown to be faulty they are
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:41.840]  hesitant to depart from that belief system
[2:46:41.840 --> 2:46:47.040]  but that's why we have to judge them with this lawsuit uh... it is arrogant
[2:46:47.040 --> 2:46:51.200]  it is arrogant to ignore all these other physicists and people just very arrogant
[2:46:51.200 --> 2:46:55.680]  to say that we're right and you're wrong when i have every bit as much if not
[2:46:55.680 --> 2:47:00.080]  more academic background than do they well let's talk about let's talk about
[2:47:00.080 --> 2:47:03.520]  some of the other prestigious physicists a big list of my hand
[2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:07.200]  uh... and and you know but top people in the royal academy and others
[2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:10.640]  you know twenty years ago saying they were worried about these uh...
[2:47:10.640 --> 2:47:12.640]  accelerators
[2:47:12.640 --> 2:47:16.960]  well i i have a necessary look through the list uh... as to
[2:47:16.960 --> 2:47:21.760]  who all uh... has come out saying that they don't think it's a good idea
[2:47:21.760 --> 2:47:24.880]  uh... and uh... like you said this is twenty years ago so
[2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:28.800]  they may have changed their views or they may have uh... passed away and so forth
[2:47:28.800 --> 2:47:32.640]  uh... i have to go with the people here now who are able to
[2:47:32.640 --> 2:47:36.960]  uh... talk about david five i've been speaking with physicists in germany
[2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:40.720]  who have excellent academic background credentials and coffee radiation
[2:47:40.720 --> 2:47:43.840]  physics astrophysics who share the same concerns
[2:47:43.840 --> 2:47:48.320]  what i found is that generally speaking nobody really wants to stick their
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:53.040]  neck out uh... and go against a gargantuan institution
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:47:57.200]  like fair because it's the academic kiss of death
[2:47:57.200 --> 2:48:01.520]  so to speak if you do that uh... publicly yet privately i've had a
[2:48:01.520 --> 2:48:04.560]  number of communications from a large number of people saying yes we really
[2:48:04.560 --> 2:48:07.920]  support what you're doing so that's that's what keeps you going now i mean
[2:48:07.920 --> 2:48:12.240]  uh... i was grateful to be able to get seven of us to follow affidavits
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:16.400]  support of this tell me about your colleague who's working on this with
[2:48:16.400 --> 2:48:20.880]  you uh... dr sancho is the uh... uh... professor or
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:24.560]  formerly a better professor in spain uh...
[2:48:24.560 --> 2:48:28.240]  believe it was the university of brasilona uh... he works in system science
[2:48:28.240 --> 2:48:32.240]  which is a uh... a trying to integrate the the fields of
[2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:37.840]  science physics and biology uh... and he is extremely uh...
[2:48:37.840 --> 2:48:41.760]  well-read and theoretical physics and these uh...
[2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:46.320]  he independently i suppose uh... came up with these concerns uh... regarding
[2:48:46.320 --> 2:48:50.000]  uh... the uh... collider and when he started reading about
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:54.800]  to me on the number of blogs i've posted on the internet uh... he got in touch
[2:48:54.800 --> 2:48:57.680]  with me uh... a couple years ago when we started
[2:48:57.680 --> 2:49:01.840]  communicating extensively about this yeah i want to get him on and get his take
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:04.640]  on things uh... he speaks pretty good english doesn't he
[2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:08.240]  is fairly good english he has a slight accent uh... he's from spain
[2:49:08.240 --> 2:49:10.880]  oh i can care less but we just want to have him on the show so hopefully i can
[2:49:10.880 --> 2:49:14.880]  get your number from you uh... yeah i can get you his
[2:49:14.880 --> 2:49:17.840]  number fantastic i want to get him on
[2:49:17.840 --> 2:49:21.120]  sure well i mean i want to get him on with you in the near future for a full
[2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:26.480]  hour uh... other concerns other facets that uh... people should know about sir
[2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:30.240]  uh... yeah uh... a couple of things uh...
[2:49:30.240 --> 2:49:34.240]  initially when this issue first came up in nineteen ninety-nine uh... i had
[2:49:34.240 --> 2:49:38.160]  with that letter to scientific american and i raised the prospect that it might
[2:49:38.160 --> 2:49:41.440]  be able to create micro black holes but i really didn't know
[2:49:41.440 --> 2:49:44.480]  and i wanted to get some additional input from other people
[2:49:44.480 --> 2:49:48.880]  uh... and uh... it was sort of roundly uh... say this guy's a nut for saying
[2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:52.560]  that it might create a micro black hole that's impossible we know from our
[2:49:52.560 --> 2:49:54.720]  knowledge of physics that this can't happen
[2:49:54.720 --> 2:49:58.400]  and so forth well within two or three years the number of theoretical papers
[2:49:58.400 --> 2:50:02.080]  came out saying that yes indeed under some conditions of physics uh... this
[2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:05.520]  might well happen that you might be able to create a micro black hole
[2:50:05.520 --> 2:50:08.720]  and at that point they turned around and said well we're going to try to create
[2:50:08.720 --> 2:50:11.520]  micro black holes this will be some interesting physics
[2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:15.440]  and none of it you know it was like so so your question spurred them trying to
[2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:19.280]  make these yeah it turns out that it did
[2:50:19.280 --> 2:50:23.040]  uh... well it's spurred out a justification for what they were doing
[2:50:23.040 --> 2:50:27.280]  is that it was already underway and but they started using this as a
[2:50:27.280 --> 2:50:30.960]  justification to continue their funding stay there final segment i want to hear
[2:50:30.960 --> 2:50:33.520]  more about this i mean that's these nuts
[2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:37.280]  oh you can make black holes let's do it oh yes
[2:50:37.280 --> 2:50:42.640]  wonderful i'll really be powerful yeah and you'll live one micron of a second
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:49.120]  we'll be right back
[2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:55.200]  it is a big idea a new world order in the near future
[2:50:55.200 --> 2:50:58.240]  earth is dominated by a powerful world government

[2:53:57.440 --> 2:54:01.520]  we're gonna get mr. Wagner's colleague mr. Sancho on in the next few weeks we'll
[2:54:01.520 --> 2:54:06.480]  get both of them back up for a full hour to explore this in a
[2:54:06.480 --> 2:54:08.960]  deeper way
[2:54:10.160 --> 2:54:14.000]  to want to make the point that about half the this is mainstream news
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:17.440]  half the people working on the a-bomb the physicists thought it would ignite
[2:54:17.440 --> 2:54:20.080]  the atmosphere but they went ahead with it
[2:54:20.080 --> 2:54:23.680]  now if they weren't right but the point is that even though they thought it
[2:54:23.680 --> 2:54:26.720]  would ignite the atmosphere and burn the surface of the earth
[2:54:26.720 --> 2:54:31.520]  they still did it and we know they blew hole in the ozone layer with the
[2:54:31.520 --> 2:54:34.640]  hydrogen bombs they detonated they detonated hundreds in the high and
[2:54:34.640 --> 2:54:38.640]  low atmosphere our own government did
[2:54:39.280 --> 2:54:43.600]  going back to Walter L. Wagner I want to give out the website
[2:54:43.600 --> 2:54:46.800]  it's got a lot of documentation a lot of information on it
[2:54:46.800 --> 2:54:53.520]  give that out placer yeah that's LHCdefense.org
[2:54:53.520 --> 2:54:57.760]  L as in Larry H as in Harry C as in Charlie
[2:54:57.760 --> 2:55:03.200]  Defense D E F E N F E dot org and that stands for large
[2:55:03.200 --> 2:55:07.200]  large hadron collider absolutely so
[2:55:07.200 --> 2:55:11.680]  LHCdefense.org okay we got a few minutes left
[2:55:11.680 --> 2:55:16.160]  other things that the equations and theories show that this could
[2:55:16.160 --> 2:55:21.840]  potentially form yeah there some people think it might create a magnetic
[2:55:21.840 --> 2:55:26.160]  monopole and that might thereafter
[2:55:26.160 --> 2:55:29.840]  engage in a catalytic catalyzing the protons
[2:55:29.840 --> 2:55:35.600]  of the our normal atoms and create converting all of
[2:55:35.600 --> 2:55:40.080]  matter into some other kind of matter I don't know too much about that theory
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:43.920]  there's another theory out there that it could cause a collapse
[2:55:43.920 --> 2:55:48.320]  or a penetration of an energetic barrier between our universe and a
[2:55:48.320 --> 2:55:52.800]  what's called a deciderspace universe that underlies our universe and that's
[2:55:52.800 --> 2:55:57.520]  you know highly theoretical but but but they predicted that when probes flew
[2:55:57.520 --> 2:56:01.520]  over Saturn that those dimensions would manifest in a hexagon on its ice
[2:56:01.520 --> 2:56:05.600]  cap and it did well I don't know that they
[2:56:05.600 --> 2:56:08.960]  predicted that that's what occurred but they certainly they do have to observe
[2:56:08.960 --> 2:56:12.800]  that that hexagon up there is very unusual pattern
[2:56:12.800 --> 2:56:17.120]  I'm very much in favor of all kinds of science
[2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:20.800]  and scientific endeavors I really want to see uh we've got a satellite launch
[2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:25.040]  coming up in May called the glass glast satellite
[2:56:25.040 --> 2:56:27.840]  it's going to have the potential for being able to search for for what's
[2:56:27.840 --> 2:56:32.480]  called hawking radiation uh and it might be able to help answer
[2:56:32.480 --> 2:56:35.360]  some of the questions that need to be answered first before we operate the
[2:56:35.360 --> 2:56:39.440]  LHC uh there's a new cosmic ray detector in
[2:56:39.440 --> 2:56:44.080]  Argentina called the Pierre Alger AUGER
[2:56:44.080 --> 2:56:47.840]  and uh it came online a couple years ago it's uh
[2:56:47.840 --> 2:56:52.320]  purely passive like any of observatory here in Hawaii we have lots of
[2:56:52.320 --> 2:56:56.640]  observatories on our mount mount a care for observing the universe
[2:56:56.640 --> 2:57:00.320]  very much in favor of acquiring more knowledge and information for us
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:05.360]  but uh has to be done in a safe manner all right up on info wars dot com we
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:08.400]  have a link to your website I hope people will
[2:57:08.400 --> 2:57:12.080]  support what you're doing any news on how effective you'll be in
[2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:15.760]  blocking them firing us up
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:20.400]  well that's always speculative when you take something before a judge uh I
[2:57:20.400 --> 2:57:24.560]  believe though that with the news media attention this is
[2:57:24.560 --> 2:57:28.320]  drawing and the fact that they have not come out with this most recent safety
[2:57:28.320 --> 2:57:32.400]  study they promised us a safety study by January 1
[2:57:32.400 --> 2:57:37.360]  they didn't deliver on January 31 I emailed them they sent me an email
[2:57:37.360 --> 2:57:41.440]  back saying they would be available by the end of February
[2:57:41.440 --> 2:57:45.280]  they didn't deliver so now they're way behind
[2:57:45.280 --> 2:57:48.480]  the gun on this and I think the reason they were not delivered is they
[2:57:48.480 --> 2:57:51.440]  recognize that there is some fundamental flaws
[2:57:51.440 --> 2:57:54.560]  and they haven't been able to come up with a way around it yet so you're
[2:57:54.560 --> 2:57:57.760]  spurring a real debate regardless inside the institution
[2:57:57.760 --> 2:58:02.160]  yeah absolutely and uh they're going to uh
[2:58:02.160 --> 2:58:06.000]  because they don't have that out I think the judge is going to grant a TRO
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:10.000]  all right uh we really appreciate uh you coming on
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:13.200]  Dr. Wagner and we'll talk to you again in the near future and your colleague
