[00:00:04.827 --> 00:00:09.669]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:11.249]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:12.790]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.992]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.992 --> 00:00:21.053]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.103 --> 00:00:38.604]  I am here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:44.645]  I love my American Airlines flight being delayed for five hours.
[00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:47.306]  Almost five hours in Los Angeles yesterday.
[00:00:47.306 --> 00:00:49.326]  Got home about 3.30 in the morning.
[00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:56.028]  Not complaining, but if I'm a bit sluggish here at the beginning of this transmission, bear with me.
[00:00:56.028 --> 00:00:57.448]  I will get warmed up.
[00:00:58.732 --> 00:01:01.373]  In fact, I've kind of tracked past radio broadcasts.
[00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:06.475]  I tend to rant more when I actually am tired and people seem to enjoy those.
[00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:07.675]  I know I don't.
[00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:17.158]  I'm very upset about watching the walls close in on our society inside the scientific dictatorship.
[00:01:17.158 --> 00:01:25.621]  Every day the news gets more important, more in focus with what we're dealing with, with this global tyranny.
[00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:27.422]  I want to open the phones up again today.
[00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:38.179]  For folks to talk about all the amazing things that are happening in our world.
[00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:48.010]  So many times I start the show with the intentions of taking your calls, and we've been doing that, but I want to take a lot of your phone calls today.
[00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:50.724]  The total free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:50.724 --> 00:01:50.804]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:50.804 --> 00:01:52.104]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:57.447]  I was out in California consulting for and appearing in Jesse Ventura's TV show that's set to air in December and January.
[00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:47.413]  called Conspiracy Theory and I interviewed Jesse it's about a ten minute video interview that I'll be airing either either tomorrow or Monday but uh... I was talking to Jesse and he he did what a lot of people have done I said well when I interviewed you back in October of last year you talked about how
[00:02:49.232 --> 00:02:56.396]  Candidate Obama was already flip-flopping on his anti-war stance.
[00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:58.877]  And he said, yes, I don't like either party.
[00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:01.899]  And I said, well, he's already increased the troops in Afghanistan.
[00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:07.842]  And he said, no, he's discussing increasing troops in Afghanistan.
[00:03:07.842 --> 00:03:15.366]  And I pointed out to him, because we all fall for this, that that was a classic example of psychological warfare.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:35.469]  Right out of a British psych warfare manual that was declassified decades ago that I happened to read in a psychology journal many years ago, and that was one of the tactics they engage in.
[00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.271]  You see, he's increased the troops already twice.
[00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:45.755]  Publicly once, sent 30,000 troops, then secretly sent, and it's now broke earlier this week on Monday,
[00:03:47.835 --> 00:03:55.099]  13,000 more troops, while he's having a public debate about 40 to 48,000 more troops.
[00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.620]  You gotta love that.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.801]  And this is just the basic Army handbook.
[00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:03.523]  I mean, there were conservatively 40,000 at one time U.S.
[00:04:03.523 --> 00:04:08.346]  observers in 1960, and there were 6,000 deaths of observers from 60 to 64 in Vietnam.
[00:04:19.056 --> 00:04:37.769]  When the war was absolutely in full swing by 1961, but we didn't really have an official war and it still was a police action until 1964, four years later, when the Pentagon staged the Gulf of Tonkin event.
[00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:39.511]  And then I bought a Wall Street Journal
[00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:51.539]  Because I was waiting in the airport for five hours and read most of it, and they actually admitted the truth in there, but hid it in plain view about the health care bill.
[00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.081]  The insurance companies wrote the stinking thing.
[00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:58.784]  The only reason they're pulling out now is because, well, I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:08.070]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:16.782]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks and we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:17.102 --> 00:05:23.390]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.454]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.454 --> 00:05:32.841]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:35.143]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:35.143 --> 00:05:36.905]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.905 --> 00:05:39.428]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.428 --> 00:05:44.173]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:44.173 --> 00:05:47.877]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.877 --> 00:05:51.000]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.902]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:52.902 --> 00:05:55.004]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:06:01.044 --> 00:06:07.071]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:12.958]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:19.126]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:21.407]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.407 --> 00:06:23.887]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:23.887 --> 00:06:37.071]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:38.732]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.592]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.592 --> 00:06:46.814]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:55.769]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:57.351]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.351 --> 00:07:00.914]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.914 --> 00:07:02.916]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:06.159]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:09.703]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:19.817]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[00:07:19.817 --> 00:07:22.039]  Rely instead on oxysilver.
[00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:27.744]  Oxysilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:07:27.744 --> 00:07:30.366]  Oxysilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol.
[00:07:30.806 --> 00:07:33.166]  Far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:38.147]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[00:07:38.147 --> 00:07:41.248]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:07:41.248 --> 00:07:46.789]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:50.049]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.

[00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.711]  Order OxySilver today.
[00:07:57.711 --> 00:07:59.071]  This call could save your life.
[00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.704]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.704 --> 00:08:06.489]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:19.551]  It is Thursday, October 15, 2009.
[00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:23.173]  We've got four hours laying out before us today.
[00:08:23.173 --> 00:08:25.194]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:25.194 --> 00:08:30.117]  I've got Stuart Rhodes, the founder of Oath Keepers, joining us to talk about a host of issues.
[00:08:30.117 --> 00:08:35.180]  The deployment of regular Army, National Guard, Marines on the streets of the United States.
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:43.525]  The military and police, as well as private snatch-and-grab forces in military uniforms grabbing people a few weeks ago off the streets of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[00:08:44.761 --> 00:08:54.963]  Neocon Media said it was a hoax, but the G20 confirmed that those were private contractors dressed as military kidnapping people.
[00:08:54.963 --> 00:08:56.503]  That's right!
[00:08:56.503 --> 00:09:09.146]  And we'll also discuss provocateurs out there trying to get a war started between the American people and the paramilitary forces that they have arrayed inside the country.
[00:09:09.146 --> 00:09:13.107]  And whoever fires first loses, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:14.923 --> 00:09:16.484]  We're going to be discussing that coming up.
[00:09:16.484 --> 00:09:24.568]  Also, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts will be joining us to talk about Obama's Peace Prize, the expansion of the wars, the Orwellian state that we're living in.
[00:09:24.568 --> 00:09:27.650]  I'm going to take a lot of your phone calls today as well.
[00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:28.330]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:40.977]  As I said in the first segment, I just got back at three o'clock in the morning last night with a five hour delayed flight out of
[00:09:42.774 --> 00:09:45.514]  Good old Los Angeles.
[00:09:45.514 --> 00:09:55.116]  I'm finally done, or almost done, consulting on and appearing in Jesse Ventura's television show, Conspiracy Theory.
[00:09:55.116 --> 00:10:00.977]  That'll be coming out in December and January is when the episodes are going to air.
[00:10:00.977 --> 00:10:05.858]  That looks to be a very interesting television show.
[00:10:05.858 --> 00:10:08.418]  That's a big weight off my shoulders.
[00:10:08.418 --> 00:10:12.259]  And yes, we are dropping the info weapon
[00:10:14.417 --> 00:10:18.399]  Next Wednesday, October 21st, Fall of the Republic.
[00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:32.047]  And this film is another attempt to alert the American people, the people of the world, to how all sovereign nation states are being imploded by design, by the global crime syndicate known as the New World Order.
[00:10:32.047 --> 00:10:34.248]  So I'm very excited about the release of that film.
[00:10:34.248 --> 00:10:39.011]  And I want to thank all of you out there that have got the buzz going near fever.
[00:10:45.151 --> 00:11:08.448]  Later in the broadcast, I bought a Wall Street Journal in the airport and opened it up and saw multiple articles that were actually truthful, but it was reported in just a dry, matter-of-fact way what I already knew.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.483]  And what many of the listeners of this broadcast already knew.
[00:11:12.483 --> 00:11:17.066]  But if you watch the national debate, you would never even get an inkling of.
[00:11:17.066 --> 00:11:20.069]  Either from the Republican side or the Democratic side.
[00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:22.531]  Which is all part of the controlled debate.
[00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:23.372]  The limited debate.
[00:11:25.188 --> 00:11:37.838]  If you watch the news, you would believe that Republicans and conservatives and insurance companies and hospitals and doctors are all together against the government-run health care bill.
[00:11:37.838 --> 00:11:46.305]  And it does have rationing death panels and it does have a tax on businesses that give their employees too good an insurance.
[00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:49.748]  If you're given full coverage insurance without a deductible, you're given a 40% tax.
[00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:52.902]  On your health care.
[00:11:52.902 --> 00:11:54.363]  I mean, it's right there in the bill.
[00:11:54.363 --> 00:11:57.185]  In one of the five versions.
[00:11:57.185 --> 00:12:17.239]  But we all hear that the Senator Olympia Snowe was the one Republican, and that now the Senate Committee has certified it, and the government accounting offices have certified it as a good bill, even though they're certifying a bill they haven't seen.
[00:12:17.239 --> 00:12:21.122]  There's five different versions, and they're constantly adding new things in committee.
[00:12:22.858 --> 00:12:27.902]  And then we heard, oh, the insurance companies pulled out of the deal.
[00:12:27.902 --> 00:12:46.336]  Now, it is the mantra spouted and chanted by the controlled left that the insurance companies and HMOs are behind the fight against government healthcare.
[00:12:50.942 --> 00:13:04.130]  In fact, any time I criticize one of the five government plans, and they're all basically the same, some are worse than others, that are all being like five decks of cards all integrated into each other,
[00:13:05.046 --> 00:13:10.390]  With constant baiting and switching and, okay, I'll put an amendment on this bill to take out the rationing.
[00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:14.213]  Oh, we'll put an amendment in there where we won't penalize seniors.
[00:13:14.213 --> 00:13:20.458]  Oh, we'll put an amendment in here that, you know, you don't have to pay $5,000 a year in penalties if you don't go out and buy insurance.
[00:13:20.458 --> 00:13:21.959]  You've only got to pay $2,000 a year.
[00:13:21.959 --> 00:13:25.442]  And then they bait and switch and add it back into another version.
[00:13:26.923 --> 00:13:32.406]  But if you watch the news, you would believe that the insurance companies are fighting this bill.
[00:13:32.406 --> 00:13:40.891]  Well then why is it suddenly big news this week that the insurance companies are saying that they may pull out of the bill?
[00:13:40.891 --> 00:13:47.754]  How are they pulling out of a bill, or out of legislation, a package of legislation, that they're against?
[00:13:47.754 --> 00:13:48.935]  And you read the Wall Street Journal,
[00:13:50.638 --> 00:14:02.104]  It just calmly reports the facts with the statements by the head lobbyist that represents the insurance companies, the health insurance divisions of the United States, the consortium head.
[00:14:02.104 --> 00:14:03.405]  He's the spokesman.
[00:14:03.405 --> 00:14:16.872]  And he says, oh, well, we helped write these bills and we support these bills, but we're pulling out because we don't like the fact that the penalty's being cut from $5,000 to $2,000 if you don't get insurance.
[00:14:19.861 --> 00:14:23.962]  The insurance companies wrote the stinking thing.
[00:14:23.962 --> 00:14:26.462]  Obama is Mr. Wall Street.
[00:14:26.462 --> 00:14:29.863]  This is nothing but a corporate boondoggle.
[00:14:29.863 --> 00:14:32.503]  A looting, just like the banker bailout.
[00:14:32.503 --> 00:14:36.924]  And he's prancing around and the left loves him and thinks he's Che Guevara.
[00:14:36.924 --> 00:14:41.525]  Look, I'm no fan of communism, but communism this is not.
[00:14:41.525 --> 00:14:45.426]  When you see the cover of Newsweek and it says, we're all socialists now.
[00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:46.406]  Boulderdash.
[00:14:46.406 --> 00:14:47.986]  We've all been robbed now.
[00:14:49.502 --> 00:15:01.647]  It's like when I'm against the global carbon tax and I get emails and comments and big hit pieces written on me and anybody else that criticizes it does saying, you work for oil companies!
[00:15:01.647 --> 00:15:09.111]  When it is ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, and every other major oil company is lined up
[00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:11.786]  I mean, open a magazine up.
[00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:18.088]  It's ExxonMobil and Dutch Rochelle and BP with ads for the carbon tax.
[00:15:18.088 --> 00:15:20.849]  I mean, I was in LAX.
[00:15:20.849 --> 00:15:22.890]  I was in wing four of the airport.
[00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:24.190]  Go in there.
[00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:33.794]  And every billboard, I mean, every one I saw, except for one little kiosk for plugless charging.
[00:15:33.794 --> 00:15:38.096]  There were some kiosk TV screens advertising
[00:15:39.915 --> 00:15:46.639]  Wireless charging, where you just, you're so lazy, you don't even plug your phone in, you just throw it onto a plate.
[00:15:46.639 --> 00:16:04.110]  So I did see some of those ads, on little kiosks, but the big billboards, when you're walking down the concourse, every one of them was banks, and IBM, and Siemens, the German company, saying global carbon tax is good, we want carbon taxes.
[00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.171]  I buy magazines randomly on the rack,
[00:16:07.327 --> 00:16:09.268]  Before, half the ads were drug ads.
[00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:14.270]  Now, a third or half the ads are carbon tax ads.
[00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.071]  Oil companies telling you how great it is.
[00:16:16.071 --> 00:16:21.333]  Then I come out and say, I don't want a carbon tax, and I get to be told I work for the oil companies.
[00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:24.215]  Listen, moron liberals, okay?
[00:16:24.215 --> 00:16:29.017]  Can you open a magazine up and see the NFL advertising green carbon taxes?
[00:16:31.475 --> 00:16:34.039]  And the entire Fortune 500's behind it.
[00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:36.742]  They're not doing this because it's a tax on them.
[00:16:36.742 --> 00:16:39.206]  It's a tax on you and they're behind it.
[00:16:39.206 --> 00:16:46.937]  And the insurance companies are now threatening to pull out of supporting the bill.
[00:16:46.937 --> 00:16:47.678]  The different bills.
[00:16:48.973 --> 00:16:55.736]  Because it doesn't put a big enough fine on you if you don't go buy insurance from them.
[00:16:55.736 --> 00:17:00.318]  They're just gonna raise insurance rates on the American people.
[00:17:00.318 --> 00:17:03.939]  And I had a chance to watch Glenn Beck Tuesday night in my hotel room in Los Angeles.
[00:17:03.939 --> 00:17:05.660]  Watched the whole show.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.100]  Very talented guy.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.781]  Very well done.
[00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:10.762]  I admire his skill.
[00:17:10.762 --> 00:17:13.563]  And I also admire his skill at deception.
[00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:25.593]  Because he's telling you that Obama is Mao Zedong, putting pictures of Mao Zedong up on the bulletin board, up on the chalkboard, and talking about how he's a radical and a communist.
[00:17:25.593 --> 00:17:27.154]  No, he's not.
[00:17:27.154 --> 00:17:29.015]  Oh, he's got the street thugs that are.
[00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:30.796]  They're always the enforcers for the bank.
[00:17:30.796 --> 00:17:43.546]  This guy is somebody to bring the left into wars, into police state, and into carbon taxes, and into the insurance companies being given liability protection, and
[00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:47.347]  Close to a trillion dollars of your money.
[00:17:47.347 --> 00:17:51.653]  And then they're allowed, because of liability protection, to lower the amount of coverage you get.
[00:17:51.653 --> 00:17:54.397]  I mean, this is so amazing.
[00:17:54.397 --> 00:17:58.263]  And then the Wall Street Journal just reports it like it's a good thing, though.
[00:17:58.263 --> 00:17:58.643]  They're like,
[00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:26.936]  Well, the insurance companies are threatening to pull out because the provisions they wrote are being watered down because Obama's having trouble getting it passed with the freshman Democrats and Republicans whose constituents are scared to death, rightly so, of having a $5,000, and you know it's going to go up from there, a $5,000 penalty, and Obama just wants it to be $2,000 because he can't get it passed.
[00:18:28.464 --> 00:18:31.809]  So the insurance companies are the greedy bastards.
[00:18:31.809 --> 00:18:34.233]  They're the ones that had government get involved in healthcare.
[00:18:34.233 --> 00:18:35.956]  They're the ones that are taking over everything.
[00:18:35.956 --> 00:18:37.579]  They're the ones involved in capitation.
[00:18:37.579 --> 00:18:41.325]  They're the ones running the HMOs, giving everybody crappy care.
[00:18:41.325 --> 00:18:42.086]  They make me sick!
[00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:55.394]  And how do you explain to a moron Republican that no, Obama isn't a communist, and this isn't some leftist scheme, and no, the Republicans aren't good?
[00:18:55.394 --> 00:19:01.020]  Because the Republicans are in there supporting, quietly, the insurance company provisions.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.022]  It's so sick.
[00:19:03.022 --> 00:19:05.405]  I mean, it's just like Obama has increased the troops.
[00:19:06.749 --> 00:19:07.029]  I think?
[00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:23.561]  And the general public thinks, oh, Obama's looking at sending more troops.
[00:19:23.561 --> 00:19:28.023]  That's the little semantical lawyer games they play.
[00:19:28.023 --> 00:19:29.983]  And I'm just a straight shooter from Texas, folks.
[00:19:29.983 --> 00:19:31.864]  I can see a scam coming from a mile away.
[00:19:31.864 --> 00:19:36.026]  This stuff is so elementary, I don't understand how these tricks fool everybody.
[00:19:36.026 --> 00:19:42.849]  The insurance companies are behind the bills to take over health care, to rape the hell out of us.
[00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:44.710]  The banks are behind the bailout bill.
[00:19:45.663 --> 00:19:46.666]  And they now admit that.
[00:19:46.666 --> 00:19:48.831]  The banks are flush with all these trillions.
[00:19:48.831 --> 00:19:49.934]  They're not loaning.
[00:19:49.934 --> 00:19:51.277]  The economy's falling apart.
[00:19:51.277 --> 00:19:53.643]  I mean, it's so diabolical.
[00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:57.000]  To watch them do this right out in the open.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.902]  All right, I'll get into that a lot more later.
[00:19:58.902 --> 00:19:59.763]  Your call straight ahead.
[00:19:59.763 --> 00:20:00.723]  Stay with us.

[00:20:03.986 --> 00:20:05.328]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:20:05.328 --> 00:20:07.249]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[00:20:07.249 --> 00:20:16.057]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:20:16.057 --> 00:20:21.322]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.

[00:21:03.568 --> 00:21:03.908]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.908 --> 00:21:08.952]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.952 --> 00:21:10.573]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.573 --> 00:21:11.314]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.314 --> 00:21:11.734]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.734 --> 00:21:12.835]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.835 --> 00:21:15.797]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.

[00:22:00.365 --> 00:22:07.026]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:15.148]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.148 --> 00:22:23.310]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:28.051]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:33.614]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.614 --> 00:22:37.976]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:37.976 --> 00:22:39.057]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:23:42.365 --> 00:23:44.727]  The Heart and Body Extract is just so great.

[00:24:04.229 --> 00:24:08.353]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:08.353 --> 00:24:10.374]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:24:10.374 --> 00:24:15.719]  We're going to your phone calls, and then I'm going to get into this stack of key news.
[00:24:15.719 --> 00:24:18.502]  Woman disabled by flu shot reaction.
[00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:24.181]  That's out of Fox News, of all places.
[00:24:24.181 --> 00:24:27.242]  Recruited by MI5, that's British Intelligence.
[00:24:27.242 --> 00:24:30.804]  The name's Mussolini, Benito Mussolini.
[00:24:30.804 --> 00:24:40.048]  Documents reveal the Italian dictator got his start in politics in 1917 with the help of financing with a MI5 wage.
[00:24:42.162 --> 00:24:48.566]  And of course, Hitler got his start through British intelligence funding, that's been declassified.
[00:24:48.566 --> 00:24:51.548]  That's why it's so hard to beat the globalists.
[00:24:51.548 --> 00:25:00.133]  They created Saddam, they created Bin Laden, they created Fidel Castro, all on record.
[00:25:00.133 --> 00:25:01.654]  They create their own enemies.
[00:25:03.712 --> 00:25:12.560]  And I'll be talking about that with Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers later today because they are, just like they did in the mid-90s, infiltrating all the patriot groups and trying to stir up violence.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.785]  They're on the Info Wars and Prison Planet comment sections on articles going, Alex is a wimp!
[00:25:17.785 --> 00:25:18.986]  He doesn't call for violence!
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:27.183]  I'm trying to get people to comment and call for violence on there so they can have the national media demonize me and then come after us.
[00:25:27.183 --> 00:25:29.624]  And they've been caught doing that over and over again.
[00:25:29.624 --> 00:25:33.985]  These are standard operating procedures for the Pentagon.
[00:25:33.985 --> 00:25:35.686]  It's extremely criminal, but they don't care.
[00:25:35.686 --> 00:25:45.430]  And I just want to warn everybody, folks, this stuff's really coming to a head, so... Just look out.
[00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.131]  Steven in Indiana, you're on the air.
[00:25:47.131 --> 00:25:47.431]  Welcome.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.640]  Hello?
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.821]  Yes.
[00:25:50.821 --> 00:25:52.102]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:25:52.102 --> 00:25:54.463]  Yeah, there was a strange static there for a second.
[00:25:54.463 --> 00:25:55.843]  Yeah, let me just stop you.
[00:25:55.843 --> 00:26:02.927]  We have the Talos phone system, and so when they go to you, it goes... That's the signal for you being on air.
[00:26:02.927 --> 00:26:05.088]  It goes... when they take your phone call.
[00:26:05.088 --> 00:26:05.528]  Go ahead.
[00:26:05.528 --> 00:26:05.868]  Sorry.
[00:26:05.868 --> 00:26:06.669]  Okay, that's what that is.
[00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:07.549]  Thanks.
[00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:10.751]  Yeah, I just wanted to share a couple of quick things with you, Alex.
[00:26:10.751 --> 00:26:13.312]  I know you got a lot of other callers.
[00:26:13.312 --> 00:26:13.572]  Anyway,
[00:26:14.484 --> 00:26:21.649]  Uh, in uh, Kroger, where I'm at, uh, they were giving away, well, not giving away, but for a fee, they were offering flu shots recently.
[00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:26.432]  So when I heard this over the, like, the loudspeaker in there, I was like, what the heck?
[00:26:26.432 --> 00:26:32.256]  And then if you take it, um, a lot of big grocery store chains are giving you a $50 coupon.
[00:26:32.256 --> 00:26:33.617]  Really?
[00:26:33.617 --> 00:26:34.357]  I didn't know that.
[00:26:34.357 --> 00:26:35.578]  You talk about bribery.
[00:26:35.578 --> 00:26:41.622]  But, um, yeah, I went up to the guy who was giving me shots outside the pharmacy.
[00:26:41.622 --> 00:26:44.084]  He was sitting at a table with this woman and I kind of looked at him.
[00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.631]  And I said, well, I didn't have any documentation to prove it, unfortunately.
[00:26:47.631 --> 00:26:53.333]  But I said, you know, these shots are actually making people sick, and in some cases, you know, killing them.
[00:26:53.333 --> 00:26:59.056]  And he gave me this odd look of disbelief, of course, because, you know, he's just going by what he's told.
[00:26:59.056 --> 00:27:02.717]  And so I saw him give one woman a shot.
[00:27:02.717 --> 00:27:05.358]  And luckily, I came across a guy there.
[00:27:05.358 --> 00:27:09.020]  And he said that, I said, I'm not taking those shots.
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.741]  I know too much about him from what I've been, you know, found out.
[00:27:11.741 --> 00:27:14.302]  And he said, and we started talking about your show.
[00:27:15.208 --> 00:27:35.212]  You know, interesting enough, we were on the same wavelength, and we ended up talking for two minutes, and then recently I just had a home inspection from, of course, the Housing Authority here, and the guy who was doing the inspection, oddly enough, was listening to your show, and brought it up, and of course he said, oh yeah, Alex Jones, yeah, I was
[00:27:37.495 --> 00:27:41.436]  I found out from a friend so many news about you.
[00:27:41.436 --> 00:27:43.936]  The word's getting out.
[00:27:43.936 --> 00:27:44.396]  People know it.
[00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:44.877]  Sure.
[00:27:44.877 --> 00:27:57.779]  Stephen, where you live, is it a zoning rule like many cities and counties in different states have where even if you're not in government housing, they do come out and quote inspect your home?
[00:27:57.779 --> 00:28:01.379]  Well, I can't say for sure about that, Alex.
[00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:03.980]  Interesting enough though, I haven't
[00:28:04.673 --> 00:28:10.376]  But they started doing, uh, I don't, you know, I asked a guy about, you know, about housing authority, how it was founded.
[00:28:10.376 --> 00:28:12.397]  And I was looking this up on, on the net.
[00:28:12.397 --> 00:28:15.538]  So somebody just showed up at your house without a warrant and said, let me in.
[00:28:15.538 --> 00:28:17.539]  I'm going to inspect your house.
[00:28:17.539 --> 00:28:19.160]  Oh, they do this yearly anyways.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:19.960]  Yeah.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.321]  Well, that's being done nationwide.
[00:28:21.321 --> 00:28:27.124]  Listen, I appreciate your call going back to the flu vaccine.
[00:28:27.124 --> 00:28:31.606]  All you had to do was walk up to the counter and say, Hey, in, in, in one of the shot bottles,
[00:28:33.861 --> 00:28:35.902]  Why don't you read the insert?
[00:28:35.902 --> 00:28:41.384]  And you could have pulled the insert out in front of him and read where it said thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative.
[00:28:41.384 --> 00:28:43.765]  You could have read where it says Guillain-Barre.
[00:28:43.765 --> 00:28:47.986]  You could have read to him where it said may cause fertility problems.
[00:28:47.986 --> 00:28:50.827]  That's on the inserts.
[00:28:50.827 --> 00:28:51.588]  Okay?
[00:28:51.588 --> 00:28:55.069]  So, the proof was right there on the table.
[00:28:55.069 --> 00:28:57.730]  We're gonna go to break and come back and talk to Adam, Ryan,
[00:29:01.272 --> 00:29:05.934]  Sergei and others when we get back in the next segment.
[00:29:05.934 --> 00:29:12.937]  But yes, I remember seeing a story out of Illinois and it said several counties have this.
[00:29:12.937 --> 00:29:16.978]  Oh, it had to be eight years ago or so.
[00:29:16.978 --> 00:29:19.499]  I made a big deal out of it at the time and had locals on from the town.
[00:29:19.499 --> 00:29:21.140]  I forget the name of the particular town.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:26.702]  But it described a man and woman, husband and wife, retirees, waking up at 6 a.m.
[00:29:26.702 --> 00:29:29.183]  in the morning with police officers standing in front of them.
[00:29:30.348 --> 00:29:33.629]  And the police said, oh, we're here with the housing authority.
[00:29:33.629 --> 00:29:40.930]  We do inspections to make sure under zoning you don't have more than your occupancy living in this home.
[00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:43.771]  And they said, we're going to go check and see how many toothbrushes you have.
[00:29:43.771 --> 00:29:46.832]  Your house is zoned for three people, but there's only two here.
[00:29:46.832 --> 00:29:51.233]  But if we find more than three toothbrushes, we're going to fine you.
[00:29:51.233 --> 00:29:52.613]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.613 --> 00:29:55.153]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.153 --> 00:29:57.854]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.972]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.972 --> 00:30:09.295]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.295 --> 00:30:11.337]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.337 --> 00:30:16.340]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.520]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.641]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.641 --> 00:30:20.522]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.522 --> 00:30:21.603]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.603 --> 00:30:23.804]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.804 --> 00:30:25.145]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.145 --> 00:30:26.686]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.686 --> 00:30:27.727]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:30:27.887 --> 00:30:29.208]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:30:29.208 --> 00:30:31.931]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.931 --> 00:30:35.514]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.514 --> 00:30:39.337]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:40.579]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.579 --> 00:30:41.459]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.459 --> 00:30:42.580]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.321]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.321 --> 00:30:44.322]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.582 --> 00:30:47.644]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.644 --> 00:30:55.167]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:55.167 --> 00:30:56.228]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:56.228 --> 00:31:07.033]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.033 --> 00:31:13.997]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.597 --> 00:31:21.179]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:23.180]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.661]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.661 --> 00:31:36.645]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.245 --> 00:31:38.907]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.907 --> 00:31:40.769]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:40.769 --> 00:31:47.676]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.676 --> 00:31:55.944]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.944 --> 00:31:57.525]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.525 --> 00:31:58.707]  The people strike back.
[00:32:01.542 --> 00:32:03.283]  Food Security from eFoodsDirect.
[00:32:03.283 --> 00:32:05.845]  The most valuable protection your family can have.
[00:32:05.845 --> 00:32:07.326]  It's a scary world we live in.
[00:32:07.326 --> 00:32:11.709]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[00:32:11.709 --> 00:32:15.391]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[00:32:15.391 --> 00:32:23.197]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's $12 trillion debt, which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[00:32:23.197 --> 00:32:27.159]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.
[00:32:27.159 --> 00:32:31.362]  And the solution for every one of these threats to your family is food security from eFoodsDirect.
[00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:31.742]  We're good.
[00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:05.210]  Oh Lordy, my troubles so hard.
[00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:09.551]  Oh Lordy, my troubles so hard.
[00:33:09.551 --> 00:33:13.971]  Don't nobody know my troubles with God.
[00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:18.632]  Don't nobody know my troubles with God.
[00:33:18.632 --> 00:33:23.013]  Oh Lordy, my troubles so hard.
[00:33:23.013 --> 00:33:26.714]  Oh Lordy, my troubles so hard.
[00:33:30.373 --> 00:33:36.216]  We are back live, continuing to take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:36.216 --> 00:33:41.319]  I wonder if this is going to turn out to be fake.
[00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:44.981]  Headline, Kenya born Obama, all set for U.S.
[00:33:44.981 --> 00:33:45.321]  Senate.
[00:33:45.321 --> 00:33:53.065]  It's from the webarchive.org, which normally only archives real articles.
[00:33:53.065 --> 00:33:58.648]  But the establishment will plant fake disinfo to discredit people.
[00:34:00.299 --> 00:34:04.062]  And I find it very surprising that this wouldn't have been discovered by now.
[00:34:04.062 --> 00:34:06.064]  Kenyan-born Obama all set for U.S.
[00:34:06.064 --> 00:34:13.710]  Senate with millions of people Googling the term Kenya-born Obama or Obama born in Kenya.
[00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:16.432]  This would have been found previously.
[00:34:16.432 --> 00:34:16.792]  I don't know.
[00:34:16.792 --> 00:34:18.233]  I think it stinks to high heaven.
[00:34:18.233 --> 00:34:20.135]  But it reads like a real article.
[00:34:20.135 --> 00:34:22.376]  And I've seen plenty of operations like that.
[00:34:23.393 --> 00:34:25.613]  So we'll cover that, too, a little bit later.
[00:34:25.613 --> 00:34:28.474]  Let's continue going to your phone calls right now.
[00:34:28.474 --> 00:34:30.014]  Let's talk to Adam in Texas.
[00:34:30.014 --> 00:34:31.974]  Adam, you're on the air.
[00:34:31.974 --> 00:34:33.015]  Hi, Alex.
[00:34:33.015 --> 00:34:41.576]  I just want to thank you for kind of hitting the nail on the head in your assessment of the health care bill.
[00:34:41.576 --> 00:34:44.897]  It's very obvious from the very beginning when H.R.
[00:34:44.897 --> 00:34:48.457]  3200 was put on the web for us to read 1,000 plus pages.
[00:34:48.457 --> 00:34:52.838]  You come to the creation of the health exchange
[00:34:53.581 --> 00:35:14.740]  That whole section alone put up the red flag that this was not about universal health care, but a way to get the insurance companies to come in, have government subsidized access to the 40 million uninsured that are in the country.
[00:35:15.325 --> 00:35:18.547]  They're playing a back-and-forth game.
[00:35:18.547 --> 00:35:32.596]  Yeah, they'll just pay tax money as a subsidy to the uninsured who will then be given crappy care where they water it down and give liability protection and basically get rid of the Hippocratic Oath in the system we've had.
[00:35:32.596 --> 00:35:36.178]  Meanwhile, people that actually have insurance will pay extra tax
[00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:39.600]  To the insurance companies.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.740]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:51.383]  But meanwhile, it gives left cover to Obama to have the Republicans coming out and attacking the plan when it's actually the insurance companies that wrote it.
[00:35:51.383 --> 00:36:00.506]  And again, the insurance companies are publicly saying they may pull out now if the fine isn't big enough, if you don't go out and get insurance.
[00:36:00.506 --> 00:36:04.967]  So, this is just a corporate welfare scam.
[00:36:06.274 --> 00:36:20.019]  The reason why they're saying that is because they know that the American public will perceive, oh, well, it must be a good bill if both the Republicans and the insurance companies are against it, thereby playing on the left-right paradigm.
[00:36:20.019 --> 00:36:21.720]  And it's even deeper than that.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.381]  This bill was not only written by the insurance companies.
[00:36:25.381 --> 00:36:31.023]  The seed and the impetus of this bill comes from the Federal Reserve in their white papers
[00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:35.215]  that are up and on the web anyone can go to Federal Reserve St.
[00:36:35.215 --> 00:36:49.894]  Louis any of these other Federal Reserve websites read those white papers those white papers extrapolate what payments they can get out of the US populace in order to continue
[00:36:50.464 --> 00:36:52.866]  The payment of the debt, of the U.S.
[00:36:52.866 --> 00:36:54.908]  debt to the Federal Reserve.
[00:36:54.908 --> 00:36:56.450]  And they mention healthcare.
[00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:57.631]  On healthcare.
[00:36:57.631 --> 00:36:59.233]  Yes, they say that.
[00:36:59.233 --> 00:36:59.893]  You're absolutely right.
[00:36:59.893 --> 00:37:01.174]  I've seen those.
[00:37:01.174 --> 00:37:03.056]  In fact, I should dig those back up.
[00:37:03.056 --> 00:37:04.137]  I saw those weeks ago.
[00:37:04.137 --> 00:37:10.443]  And we should post those on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with a blurb at the top pointing out.
[00:37:10.443 --> 00:37:11.925]  But yes, that's all this is.
[00:37:11.925 --> 00:37:13.506]  And they've done this in Europe and other places.
[00:37:14.418 --> 00:37:19.199]  The same year we got the Federal Reserve, we got the income tax, 1913.
[00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:22.100]  And they've talked about new ways to tax people.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:28.662]  And how they're going to do that is carbon taxes on your homes, your cars, on every facet of business.
[00:37:28.662 --> 00:37:37.745]  They're going to do it through new health care taxes that are nothing but a giant new slush fund of money for government to loot and pay to the banks.
[00:37:37.745 --> 00:37:40.466]  All this is, is a whole new area of taxes
[00:37:41.366 --> 00:37:54.670]  And as usual, they get some of the slovenly population that wants something free to line up and say, oh yes, give us some more welfare when all welfare is ever used for is shackles to control people.
[00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.631]  But that's only a small part of it.
[00:37:56.631 --> 00:38:06.774]  It is the total takeover of our society and sets up government control of health care for a medical tyranny here inside the United States.
[00:38:06.774 --> 00:38:10.815]  We have to stay away from is getting away from that argument and trying to
[00:38:11.365 --> 00:38:19.089]  Blame skyrocketing health care costs on illegal aliens using the medical facilities.
[00:38:19.089 --> 00:38:35.196]  They actually, if you read the studies that are published by schools in Texas, Arizona, California, not anything on the East Coast, they are one half of one percent of the total budget of any medical health care facility on the border.
[00:38:35.196 --> 00:38:36.257]  They are not the problem.
[00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:44.397]  This is being done because they're trying to extrapolate money out of the American populace, the American taxpayer.
[00:38:44.397 --> 00:38:55.648]  They want them to live longer, to work longer, so that they can just pool as much money surreptitiously as they can on the premise that, well, we're going to give you some health care,
[00:38:56.187 --> 00:39:00.148]  And you're going to feel good, but we're going to take more money out of your check.
[00:39:00.148 --> 00:39:02.009]  We're going to take more money out of your check.
[00:39:02.009 --> 00:39:04.210]  I hear you, Adam, and I appreciate your call.
[00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:13.032]  As for the global elite wanting us to live longer, actually, they want us to live to about 60 and then die, and they want us, by law, to only be able to have one child, and that's just for starters.
[00:39:13.032 --> 00:39:13.653]  That's stated.
[00:39:13.653 --> 00:39:16.313]  That's stated.
[00:39:16.313 --> 00:39:18.214]  Let's talk to Ryan in Indiana.
[00:39:18.214 --> 00:39:19.675]  Ryan, you're on the air.
[00:39:19.675 --> 00:39:20.655]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[00:39:20.655 --> 00:39:20.975]  Good, buddy.
[00:39:21.431 --> 00:39:28.033]  What do you know about January 26th and Obama having to be in federal court in California?
[00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:29.093]  Tell me about it.
[00:39:29.093 --> 00:39:35.615]  Well, I hear and I've gone through several documents to try to confirm that this is true.
[00:39:35.615 --> 00:39:40.076]  In fact, I have the name of the judge right here, David Carter.
[00:39:40.076 --> 00:39:49.618]  Federal Judge David Carter has accepted the case, so we actually have to prove that he was in fact eligible to be president in the first place, which, if you know simple math, he wasn't.
[00:39:50.302 --> 00:39:59.145]  You know, if you were born to a foreign national, then the other parent has to have 10 years of residency, 5 years of which have to be after the age of 14.
[00:39:59.145 --> 00:40:03.066]  His mother being 18 disqualifies that.
[00:40:03.066 --> 00:40:04.787]  And at the time, that was the law.
[00:40:04.787 --> 00:40:13.490]  I'm told, I've read it's not the law now, but yes, it's all a red herring because he, it's 50-50.
[00:40:15.259 --> 00:40:32.929]  Where he was really born, but some evidence shows he probably was born in Hawaii, but regardless, the one American parent, as you said, had to be residing here for a certain period of time, and she was too young to have been able to do that, so he is illegitimate.
[00:40:32.929 --> 00:40:44.075]  But isn't it strange that the other candidate he ran against was also born in the Panama Canal zone, and they tried to say, oh, well, he was born at a base, but those bases didn't exist then.
[00:40:44.915 --> 00:40:52.723]  So, according to the letter of the law, John McCain wasn't eligible, but it's kind of like Dick Cheney really lived in Texas.
[00:40:53.689 --> 00:41:05.217]  The same state as George W. Bush in 2000 when they were running, but then he lied and said he was really from Montana, though he didn't have residency there, and so they violated the Constitution there.
[00:41:05.217 --> 00:41:09.861]  I mean, it's just, why can't we have candidates that don't violate the Constitution?
[00:41:09.861 --> 00:41:14.484]  It's as if they're picking candidates to set the precedent to do that.
[00:41:14.484 --> 00:41:22.350]  But, you know, overall, Obama is a liar, he's run by the bankers, he's lied about everything, he has all these corrupt mafia people around him.
[00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:32.477]  He came up with Blagojevich under Axelrod, and of course, on top of that, Rahm Emanuel as his handler.
[00:41:32.477 --> 00:41:37.540]  I mean, he's a horrible guy, but in the final equation he's still just a puppet running nothing.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:41.022]  He's a front man who they mean to build up and then destroy.
[00:41:41.022 --> 00:41:48.768]  And so, there's almost a political gravitational pull towards the left-right paradigm and bashing these puppets.
[00:41:48.768 --> 00:41:50.349]  And I certainly do it as well, but
[00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:59.233]  You know, I'm not... Is this the case launched by Alan Keyes' lawyer, or who's launched this court case?
[00:41:59.233 --> 00:42:02.536]  Well, I believe the people I've seen... Actually, hold on.
[00:42:02.536 --> 00:42:05.537]  I can bring up the document right in front of me.
[00:42:05.537 --> 00:42:06.438]  Let's see.
[00:42:06.438 --> 00:42:09.660]  I might have closed it while we were talking, but I can bring it right back up.
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:18.246]  While I'm looking for that, there was also an article in my... The town I grew up in, Rensselaer, Indiana, they had a distribution of H1N1 vaccine.
[00:42:18.246 --> 00:42:21.908]  We'll begin soon in Jasper County, with no author.
[00:42:22.526 --> 00:42:23.607]  Let's back up for a minute.
[00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:24.928]  What did the headline say?
[00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.512]  I got it right here if you want to hear the whole thing.
[00:42:54.512 --> 00:42:55.692]  Why would he shake?
[00:42:55.692 --> 00:42:58.574]  They're distributing H1N1 all over the place right now.
[00:42:58.574 --> 00:43:00.135]  That's my point.
[00:43:00.135 --> 00:43:01.716]  Why would he be so scared?
[00:43:01.716 --> 00:43:04.638]  I'm telling him some of these facts.
[00:43:04.638 --> 00:43:06.659]  H1N1 is not good for the people that live here.
[00:43:06.659 --> 00:43:09.041]  There was no concern for the people of our community.
[00:43:09.041 --> 00:43:11.383]  There was more concern that I knew about any of this.
[00:43:11.383 --> 00:43:13.124]  Listen, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:17.527]  There is a mass-induced paranoia.
[00:43:17.527 --> 00:43:20.049]  First they trigger 9-11, get everybody scared.
[00:43:20.049 --> 00:43:23.672]  They tell you it's for people in foreign caves that we're setting up the police state.
[00:43:23.672 --> 00:43:32.079]  Then they announce, no actually it's for the American people and gun owners and libertarians and conservatives and people that don't like the Federal Reserve and they teach all the police departments that...
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:44.564]  Right-wing terrorists are about to bomb all the police departments and they do improvised explosive device training and they put military liaisons and all the big police departments and set up threat fusion centers and
[00:43:46.357 --> 00:43:47.618]  All over the place now.
[00:43:47.618 --> 00:43:54.081]  They've recruited InfoGuard spies and businesses who were all just completely paranoid.
[00:43:54.081 --> 00:44:02.945]  They've recruited the plumbers and the cable people and the telephone man and they're all spying on you admittedly and the Girl Scouts and the Boy Scouts and
[00:44:04.278 --> 00:44:11.584]  First, they train you to be searched, and take your shoes off, and take your jacket off, and answer questions, and can't have fluids.
[00:44:11.584 --> 00:44:19.050]  And then now, oh, we want to have checkpoints outside the airports, and then checkpoints at the bus terminals, and checkpoints at the train stations.
[00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:24.194]  And they just expand out all this paranoia.
[00:44:24.194 --> 00:44:26.816]  And then local businesses get insurance breaks.
[00:44:28.123 --> 00:44:38.695]  All over the country, if they'll have an anti-terror drill where they hire local police or local private security firms to come in and do a mock attack on the business.
[00:44:38.695 --> 00:44:45.862]  All about creating this perception and they get citizen groups to watch the local surveillance cameras and everyone gets involved.
[00:44:48.502 --> 00:44:51.344]  Last night at about 3.30, I was out of gas.
[00:44:51.344 --> 00:44:59.791]  You know, my plane came in right before 3, got in my car, drove home, pulled into a Rudy's BBQ to get gas.
[00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:02.614]  At about 3.30.
[00:45:02.614 --> 00:45:04.515]  On 3.60.
[00:45:04.515 --> 00:45:08.298]  And I get out, I actually shot video of this on my iPhone.
[00:45:08.298 --> 00:45:15.624]  Need to figure out how to email it to myself and get it posted on the site.
[00:45:15.624 --> 00:45:16.125]  But, uh,
[00:45:22.733 --> 00:45:30.058]  My windows are up as I pull in and I hear a loudspeaker, like a bullhorn, like the police are addressing me.
[00:45:30.058 --> 00:45:33.141]  I look around me, nobody's in the well-lit parking lot.
[00:45:33.141 --> 00:45:38.285]  I get out, put my card in, and I'm sitting there.
[00:45:38.285 --> 00:45:46.971]  So I was almost out of gas and I've run out many times, so I've just learned to pull over and not chance it.
[00:45:46.971 --> 00:45:49.253]  And every minute, on the minute it would announce,
[00:45:50.919 --> 00:45:53.900]  You are in the Rudy's BBQ parking lot.
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:58.441]  You can only pay by card.
[00:45:58.441 --> 00:45:59.782]  Pay at the pump.
[00:45:59.782 --> 00:46:04.964]  You are under surveillance by closed circuit television.
[00:46:04.964 --> 00:46:09.125]  And I mean, it was so loud, it was like a drill sergeant screaming at me.
[00:46:09.125 --> 00:46:12.106]  And there's a neighborhood 50 yards behind it.
[00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:24.250]  I mean it's built in a neighborhood on the side of 360s and I mean do neighbors like the giant loudspeakers like it's a concentration camp blaring?
[00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:30.017]  And I know in New York and other areas they have these loudspeakers where they boom
[00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:33.802]  And in England, they even have the image of a mean face.
[00:46:33.802 --> 00:46:36.583]  It's like a telescreen shouting at you.
[00:46:36.583 --> 00:46:40.385]  And if you stand too long at a corner, you're not allowed to loiter, it screams messages.
[00:46:40.385 --> 00:46:42.006]  And all over the U.S.
[00:46:42.006 --> 00:46:46.267]  and England and Europe, they've put in this, they call it the mosquito system.
[00:46:46.267 --> 00:46:50.529]  And it's an ultra-low frequency that hurts people's ears under the age of 30.
[00:46:50.529 --> 00:46:52.570]  It actually damages hearing.
[00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:53.650]  It's an acoustic device.
[00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:55.171]  In fact, people won't believe me.
[00:46:55.171 --> 00:46:58.232]  Well, you guys search engine, mosquito system stops loiters.
[00:46:58.232 --> 00:46:59.353]  I think that's a headline.
[00:47:01.761 --> 00:47:04.402]  And I was there trying to, you know, pump the gas.
[00:47:04.402 --> 00:47:07.464]  I was there trying to give them, you know, 40 bucks of my money.
[00:47:07.464 --> 00:47:09.305]  And it was just blaring at me every minute.
[00:47:09.305 --> 00:47:11.766]  Blaring at me, blaring at me.
[00:47:11.766 --> 00:47:16.689]  And I guess I won't go back to Rudy's.
[00:47:16.689 --> 00:47:18.029]  I mean, I guess that's the only thing I can do.
[00:47:18.029 --> 00:47:23.072]  And people can say, oh, well, that's for your safety.
[00:47:23.072 --> 00:47:24.793]  And it's not in a high crime area.
[00:47:24.793 --> 00:47:27.714]  And I've read that's going in all over the place.
[00:47:27.714 --> 00:47:31.076]  And normally you'd pull in, it would go, we've got hot coffee and donuts inside.
[00:47:32.546 --> 00:47:36.607]  They have that outdoor advertising, that audible advertising, but that's always subdued.
[00:47:36.607 --> 00:47:39.788]  I mean, even in the airport, it's like, your attention, please.
[00:47:39.788 --> 00:47:42.148]  Please don't leave any unattended bags.
[00:47:42.148 --> 00:47:45.549]  Please, if someone tries to give you a bag, don't take it.
[00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:50.250]  It's all part of the Orwellian-ness, but this was just shouting at me so loud.
[00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:51.990]  I mean, just blaring loud.
[00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:56.932]  I mean, I pulled up with the windows up, and as I'm pulling in, I'm like, who's talking?
[00:47:56.932 --> 00:47:58.352]  Through the windows, I could hear it.
[00:48:00.083 --> 00:48:01.484]  With an aggressive voice.
[00:48:01.484 --> 00:48:05.966]  Okay, well, I won't be going to Rudy's to buy a barbecue ever again.
[00:48:05.966 --> 00:48:10.329]  I guess is what I've got to do because I don't patronize Big Brother.
[00:48:10.329 --> 00:48:14.151]  That's like, well, that's for your safety when you're in a parking lot at night.
[00:48:14.151 --> 00:48:19.374]  Well, they don't have a lot of robberies in parking lots at night in Texas because people got guns.
[00:48:19.374 --> 00:48:23.016]  But that's another issue.
[00:48:23.016 --> 00:48:28.219]  It's just this nanny, nanny state with everyone shaking in fear and everyone crying and
[00:48:29.703 --> 00:48:32.746]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:48:32.746 --> 00:48:42.475]  I mean, everywhere I go, it's Girl Scouts training with Homeland Security and loudspeakers blaring, you're being watched, as if any moron doesn't know that you're being watched.
[00:48:42.475 --> 00:48:47.999]  I mean, I guess if you work at night, you're bad.
[00:48:47.999 --> 00:48:51.082]  But what about the people in the neighborhood?
[00:48:51.082 --> 00:48:54.745]  I mean, a blaring... But this is the new America.
[00:48:54.745 --> 00:48:56.247]  Is sonic weapons
[00:48:58.106 --> 00:49:01.770]  Quote, in areas where people congregate on the streets of New York and London.
[00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:05.754]  I mean, what is the deal?
[00:49:05.754 --> 00:49:10.839]  And they report in New York that if a woman sits on a bench too long, they come up and give her tickets.
[00:49:10.839 --> 00:49:12.761]  You're only allowed to sit on a bench if you're waiting for a bus.
[00:49:12.761 --> 00:49:16.185]  A few minutes, the police say, go ahead and walk around in circles, then you can sit back down.
[00:49:16.185 --> 00:49:17.567]  They're making all these rules to make...
[00:49:21.298 --> 00:49:25.322]  $100,000 fines at the garage sales, fines if you're selling eggs or watermelons.
[00:49:25.322 --> 00:49:28.285]  It's just, it's just total harassment.
[00:49:28.285 --> 00:49:36.853]  And then all these people that get henpecked by the government and the media and the culture, they then get their petty positions and they want to boss you around and peck on you.
[00:49:36.853 --> 00:49:40.837]  And there's all these petty people that want power.
[00:49:40.837 --> 00:49:43.039]  I was going through the checkpoint at LAX.
[00:49:43.039 --> 00:49:44.220]  This really happened.
[00:49:45.350 --> 00:50:13.036]  Because I listen to what's going on, and I'm, you have to take your camera and your laptop out, so I took it out of my bag, so we've gone through, I was putting it back on, putting my shoes back on, putting my belt back on, my act of contrition, my act of submission, and I listen to these two guys talking while they're at the x-ray machine, and the guy's going, yeah, I'm going for Sergeant, I admit it, I want the power, I want it, and the guy's like going, I know what you mean, I like it, it's good,
[00:50:14.161 --> 00:50:15.784]  And I was like, did I really hear that?
[00:50:15.784 --> 00:50:25.079]  I mean, I just, then I forgot to zip my bag and picked it up and all my stuff dumped out because, I mean, do other people observe what's going on around them?
[00:50:25.079 --> 00:50:26.922]  I mean, do other people observe the insanity?
[00:50:27.807 --> 00:50:33.869]  I mean, it was like something out of a nightmare science fiction movie where, you know, you're at the checkpoint and they're going, I like the power!
[00:50:33.869 --> 00:50:35.570]  I'm going for Sargent!
[00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:36.410]  I admit it!
[00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:37.911]  I want power!
[00:50:37.911 --> 00:50:38.531]  I enjoy it!
[00:50:38.531 --> 00:50:45.394]  I mean, they were saying stuff like that, so I tune in and start listening to it, and I couldn't help it at the food lines.
[00:50:45.394 --> 00:50:47.975]  There's something about people in Stormtrooper outfits that are obese.
[00:50:47.975 --> 00:50:51.456]  I mean, I'm a little overweight, but I'm sitting there taking iPhone pictures of them.
[00:50:51.456 --> 00:50:53.037]  I gotta file a report on all this.
[00:50:54.197 --> 00:50:56.158]  Oh my God, help me.
[00:50:56.158 --> 00:51:01.021]  I just... Beam me up, Scotty, I tell ya.
[00:51:01.021 --> 00:51:04.443]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:51:04.443 --> 00:51:08.086]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:51:08.086 --> 00:51:12.688]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:51:12.688 --> 00:51:17.291]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:51:17.291 --> 00:51:20.193]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly.
[00:51:20.473 --> 00:51:23.437]  It emits no fumes and produces electricity for free.
[00:51:23.437 --> 00:51:26.981]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:51:26.981 --> 00:51:31.666]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:51:31.666 --> 00:51:38.094]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:51:38.094 --> 00:51:39.976]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:51:40.456 --> 00:51:43.679]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[00:52:01.337 --> 00:52:07.379]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.379 --> 00:52:13.260]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:19.402]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:19.682 --> 00:52:21.723]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:21.723 --> 00:52:24.184]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:24.184 --> 00:52:37.370]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:39.051]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.051 --> 00:52:40.912]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:40.912 --> 00:52:47.135]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:52:56.082 --> 00:52:57.664]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.664 --> 00:52:58.846]  The people strike back!
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:09.826]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[00:54:11.976 --> 00:54:16.139]  At the 8 after, I am going to start getting into this huge stack of important news.
[00:54:16.139 --> 00:54:18.721]  Woman disabled by flu, shock reaction.
[00:54:18.721 --> 00:54:20.923]  Dollar loses reserve status to yen and euro.
[00:54:22.964 --> 00:54:24.765]  That's the headline of the New York Post.
[00:54:24.765 --> 00:54:31.407]  They're not talking about will they kill the dollar, they're talking about how they're going to kill it, and they're starting it.
[00:54:31.407 --> 00:54:34.909]  They're not eating around the edges anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:34.909 --> 00:54:40.471]  And that's the thing for all the people sucked into this whole police state and the New World Order.
[00:54:40.471 --> 00:54:46.093]  All of you fools that are going along with it and think it's cute and funny, you have no idea.
[00:54:46.093 --> 00:54:50.055]  No idea just how real this is and just how bad it's going to be for you.
[00:54:51.113 --> 00:54:54.216]  And it's going to be bad for everybody else that doesn't want it.
[00:54:54.216 --> 00:55:02.982]  Sergey in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:55:02.982 --> 00:55:04.744]  Okay, Sergey.
[00:55:04.744 --> 00:55:05.884]  Have a good one.
[00:55:05.884 --> 00:55:07.045]  Jay in Nebraska.
[00:55:07.045 --> 00:55:07.946]  Jay, you're on the air.
[00:55:07.946 --> 00:55:10.168]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:10.168 --> 00:55:12.149]  Hey, Jay.
[00:55:12.149 --> 00:55:20.636]  I appreciate your work right up the side of Archibald Roberts that I discovered in 1991 with his most secret science.
[00:55:23.482 --> 00:55:24.803]  Okay, take that as a compliment.
[00:55:24.803 --> 00:55:26.404]  Well, thank you.
[00:55:26.404 --> 00:55:29.125]  Go ahead.
[00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:39.972]  Yes, you know, my question is, do you have any suggestions for people that end up having the inoculation on how to clean their body out afterwards?
[00:55:39.972 --> 00:55:52.560]  I mean, for me, I've actually had a shot with some aerosol in the past, and the only thing I found that helped me at all clear my head and my body out was kelp and a micro plant powder.
[00:55:54.127 --> 00:55:57.251]  Look, I'm not a doctor and I appreciate your call.
[00:55:57.251 --> 00:56:08.645]  I mean, we have doctors on who talk about getting lots of sleep, drinking lots of clean water, eating a lot of vegetables, not eating a lot of fried foods, getting your mind right.
[00:56:10.219 --> 00:56:24.788]  And I try to be healthy, but I work so much, and I'm not really the person to be up here pontificating on what people can do, but there are a lot of detox things that people can do, dealing with all the thimerosal and other things that are in people's bodies.
[00:56:24.788 --> 00:56:26.309]  Tony in Niagara Falls.
[00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:28.010]  Tony, you're on the air.
[00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:29.271]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[00:56:29.271 --> 00:56:29.511]  Good.
[00:56:29.511 --> 00:56:31.633]  It's nice to talk to you again.
[00:56:31.633 --> 00:56:38.297]  I talked to you over the summer about the deer camp, if you remember, up here in Niagara Falls by the border.
[00:56:38.297 --> 00:56:39.638]  You guys have got like a militia camp?
[00:56:41.122 --> 00:56:44.564]  Yeah, we have a deer camp down in Southern Tier.
[00:56:44.564 --> 00:56:47.487]  I just wanted to give you some updates on what's going on up here.
[00:56:47.487 --> 00:56:51.710]  Things have changed quite a bit since I talked to you last over the summer.
[00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:56.854]  Six weeks ago in Greece, New York, they had a military training exercise.
[00:56:56.854 --> 00:57:01.678]  They have environmental police in Buffalo, New York now, and SUVs go driving around.
[00:57:01.678 --> 00:57:03.179]  I don't know exactly what they're doing.
[00:57:03.179 --> 00:57:05.401]  They're going to be the home inspectors.
[00:57:05.401 --> 00:57:07.442]  They all say what they're going to do.
[00:57:07.442 --> 00:57:08.043]  It's not pretty.
[00:57:08.775 --> 00:57:21.706]  Yep, and on Channel 7 News, every time that they do a big bust or anything nowadays, if you go into their archives on wkbw.com, you can see that the military are working alongside the police in full uniforms.
[00:57:22.932 --> 00:57:27.513]  It's just changing from black to white since the last time I talked to you up here.
[00:57:27.513 --> 00:57:29.454]  It's changed extraordinarily.
[00:57:29.454 --> 00:57:42.297]  Yeah, actually, in upstate New York, but also in central New York, we have confirmed at least four towns, including Schenectady, that have openly announced they're putting troops on the streets.
[00:57:43.577 --> 00:57:45.859]  National Guard and regular Army.
[00:57:45.859 --> 00:57:47.921]  They're calling for it in Alabama.
[00:57:47.921 --> 00:57:54.786]  Suddenly, I get the videos every other day to the point of I've been desensitized and it's not even a big deal now, which is what they meant.
[00:57:54.786 --> 00:57:56.268]  The psych warfare chiefs meant.
[00:57:56.268 --> 00:57:59.130]  I mean, even if you're against this, you get conditioned.
[00:57:59.130 --> 00:57:59.730]  That's the point.
[00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:02.413]  Condition the troops, the police, the public.
[00:58:02.413 --> 00:58:07.276]  Suddenly, Army, Marines, National Guard are out running checkpoints.
[00:58:07.276 --> 00:58:08.097]  It's really happening.
[00:58:09.558 --> 00:58:13.881]  It is hellish, and that's because they're going to fully implode the economy by design.
[00:58:13.881 --> 00:58:22.406]  So you're saying on the local TV station, they just show the news with bust, and then show military with the police, but then don't even make a big deal about it.
[00:58:22.406 --> 00:58:23.647]  They just show it.
[00:58:23.647 --> 00:58:29.310]  Yep, don't even mention that they are military, but you can tell they're full military, because I was a vet, as you know, myself.
[00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:33.813]  And you can tell that they're military working alongside the police, but they do not mention it whatsoever.
[00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:38.861]  Also, um, the chemtrail thing, um, there hasn't been a lot of chemtrail- We got him.
[00:58:38.861 --> 00:58:41.043]  We got him right.
[00:58:41.043 --> 00:58:45.967]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:48.879 --> 00:58:54.602]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.602 --> 00:58:56.602]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.602 --> 00:59:05.126]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.126 --> 00:59:10.688]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.688 --> 00:59:12.289]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.529 --> 00:59:19.051]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.051 --> 00:59:30.095]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.095 --> 00:59:30.875]  That's right.
[00:59:30.875 --> 00:59:33.436]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.436 --> 00:59:35.036]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:59:36.977 --> 00:59:37.257]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.607 --> 01:00:08.369]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.369 --> 01:00:10.130]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:11.731]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.731 --> 01:00:13.633]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.633 --> 01:00:17.456]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.456 --> 01:00:21.740]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:27.565]  Alright, we're eight minutes away from a news blitz and I'm gonna cover the news.
[01:00:27.565 --> 01:00:29.126]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:34.091]  Tony in Niagara Falls, you were finishing up about chemtrails in your area of the country.
[01:00:34.932 --> 01:00:38.273]  Yep, for a while now I've heard about chemtrails, but never seen any.
[01:00:38.273 --> 01:00:42.775]  But it's starting to happen more and more as the summer progresses, throughout the summer.
[01:00:42.775 --> 01:00:48.217]  And there's been lots and lots of growing problems with vegetables.
[01:00:48.217 --> 01:00:53.258]  I mean, you touch tomatoes, you touch squash and things, and they disintegrate in your hands.
[01:00:53.258 --> 01:00:54.979]  There's been so much rain this year.
[01:00:55.635 --> 01:00:59.318]  Um, that we have not seen this much rain in a very, very long time.
[01:00:59.318 --> 01:01:10.366]  And we would get weather reports saying that it's sunny, it's gonna be sunny all week, and then you'll see for like the weekend chemtrails all over the place, and then all week long we would have nothing but rain.
[01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:13.828]  And also one other point is the trains.
[01:01:13.828 --> 01:01:21.133]  Um, all throughout the state, the tracks are filled with trains that are not been moved for at least a month, month and a half.
[01:01:21.133 --> 01:01:24.476]  And when you start noticing that trains aren't moving, there's definitely a problem.
[01:01:30.615 --> 01:01:40.082]  The economy is shutting down and then meanwhile they keep telling you the economy's doing great, everything's wonderful.
[01:01:40.082 --> 01:01:50.791]  That's meant to make you feel like that you're a failure and that you're the only person who's losing their job or having a cut in wages or who can't make ends meet.
[01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:51.731]  Prices are going up.
[01:01:52.793 --> 01:01:54.795]  This is all by design as the U.N.
[01:01:54.795 --> 01:02:00.780]  Director of Environmental Affairs, Maury Strong, stated in 1992 that they would destroy U.S.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.943]  industrial capacity by design.
[01:02:03.943 --> 01:02:07.847]  Thanks for the call, Tony.
[01:02:07.847 --> 01:02:12.271]  Let's take a call from Montana.
[01:02:12.271 --> 01:02:13.251]  How do you pronounce your name?
[01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:13.732]  L-A-F-E?
[01:02:13.732 --> 01:02:15.994]  It's Leif.
[01:02:15.994 --> 01:02:17.936]  Leif, welcome.
[01:02:17.936 --> 01:02:18.416]  Thank you.
[01:02:18.416 --> 01:02:19.257]  How are you doing?
[01:02:20.666 --> 01:02:30.802]  I want to thank you for coming up to Hardin and exposing the tricks that they were playing in not only Hardin, but in the state of Montana and the United States.
[01:02:30.802 --> 01:02:33.927]  I feel you're one of the great sources that gets this news out to the nation.
[01:02:35.433 --> 01:02:37.875]  It shows the tricks that these people are doing.
[01:02:37.875 --> 01:02:38.916]  What's the latest?
[01:02:38.916 --> 01:02:51.525]  I haven't looked into Hardin with the felon who was trying to hire another felon to come in and the town leaders trying to turn everything over to him, including the police department.
[01:02:51.525 --> 01:02:53.386]  Where is that now?
[01:02:53.386 --> 01:02:54.947]  They're all under investigation.
[01:02:54.947 --> 01:02:58.330]  Two Rivers, the individuals of Two Rivers, and the APF.
[01:02:59.594 --> 01:03:02.516]  And any sources that might be involved are all under investigation.
[01:03:02.516 --> 01:03:08.681]  The Attorney General in Montana has broadened the scope to anyone who may have been involved.
[01:03:08.681 --> 01:03:14.245]  Is Becky Shea still running around saying it's all legitimate and is the head of Two Rivers?
[01:03:14.245 --> 01:03:17.748]  I saw him on Monday in the news saying, I would do it all over again.
[01:03:17.748 --> 01:03:19.289]  This was a great deal.
[01:03:19.289 --> 01:03:22.091]  I did nothing wrong.
[01:03:22.091 --> 01:03:24.613]  He is still holding on to that.
[01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:30.434]  There, uh, Big Eric, I believe his name is.
[01:03:30.434 --> 01:03:38.137]  His corruption is being exposed more every day because of the involvement of you and your crews.
[01:03:38.137 --> 01:03:45.059]  A lot of the locals are taking a harder look, but they're governing and police officials.
[01:03:45.059 --> 01:03:49.340]  Well, Harden, as I've said, is a microcosm of the rest of the country.
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:53.522]  I mean, it seems crazy to have a Serbian felon driving around in police cars taking over a
[01:03:55.103 --> 01:04:02.727]  And most of us locals see that as how subtle they can be, especially to a financially strapped area, that they can come in subtly and say, we're your saviors.
[01:04:25.066 --> 01:04:27.107]  This is what's best for you.
[01:04:27.107 --> 01:04:31.349]  Yes, the new economy will be putting you in the jail.
[01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:33.570]  Yes, oh absolutely.
[01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:37.112]  I believe this brought awareness to more people.
[01:04:38.123 --> 01:04:41.846]  Nationwide and worldwide, not just, pardon, in the state of Montana.
[01:04:41.846 --> 01:04:42.346]  You're right.
[01:04:42.346 --> 01:04:47.569]  I really just want to thank you for exposing this so that people may see the subtleties.
[01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:49.711]  Well, Leif, Leif, I want to thank you.
[01:04:49.711 --> 01:04:50.231]  God bless you.
[01:04:50.231 --> 01:04:50.812]  We'll be back.
[01:04:50.812 --> 01:04:53.814]  Talk to Randy, Jim, Donna, Ronnie, and many others.
[01:04:53.814 --> 01:04:53.934]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:53.934 --> 01:04:55.815]  But first, I'm going to cover a bunch of news.
[01:04:55.815 --> 01:04:56.055]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.376 --> 01:05:05.683]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.683 --> 01:05:10.209]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.209 --> 01:05:12.492]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:14.114]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.114 --> 01:05:15.156]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.376 --> 01:05:23.798]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:05:23.798 --> 01:05:31.260]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:05:37.282 --> 01:05:43.304]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:03.652]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:06:03.652 --> 01:06:07.274]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:06:07.274 --> 01:06:11.856]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:11.856 --> 01:06:17.439]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:17.739 --> 01:06:22.502]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.502 --> 01:06:26.124]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:06:26.124 --> 01:06:30.947]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:30.947 --> 01:06:37.511]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:06:37.511 --> 01:06:39.452]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:06:39.992 --> 01:06:44.574]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:07:07.436 --> 01:07:13.320]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:19.805]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:07:19.805 --> 01:07:21.806]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:07:21.806 --> 01:07:24.248]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:07:24.248 --> 01:07:35.156]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:07:37.446 --> 01:07:39.108]  It's not about left or right.
[01:07:39.108 --> 01:07:40.970]  It's about a one world government.
[01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:47.877]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:07:56.146 --> 01:07:57.727]  The Obama Deception.
[01:07:57.727 --> 01:07:58.909]  The people strike back.

[01:08:06.292 --> 01:08:13.617]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:13.617 --> 01:08:19.041]  We've got Stuart Rose, the founder of Oath Keepers, coming up later in the broadcast, talking about a host of issues.
[01:08:19.041 --> 01:08:24.264]  Now the feds are trying to infiltrate provocative violence in the country with the anti-New World Order movement.
[01:08:24.264 --> 01:08:25.265]  It's not going to work.
[01:08:25.265 --> 01:08:26.566]  They certainly are attempting it.
[01:08:29.431 --> 01:08:30.832]  We know they're tricks.
[01:08:30.832 --> 01:08:31.793]  This isn't 1995.
[01:08:31.793 --> 01:08:36.256]  We've also got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming up in the last hour today.
[01:08:36.256 --> 01:08:44.043]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls here in just a few minutes, but I wanted to go through some of today's important top stories.
[01:08:44.043 --> 01:08:46.825]  Dollar loses reserve status to Yen and Euro.
[01:08:48.217 --> 01:08:49.377]  This is the New York Post.
[01:08:49.377 --> 01:09:05.881]  Ben Bernanke's dollar crisis went into a wider mode yesterday, that'd be on Wednesday, as the greenback was shockingly upstaged by the euro and yen, both of which can lay claim to the world's title as the currency favored by central banks as their reserve currency.
[01:09:05.881 --> 01:09:07.221]  That's actually a true statement.
[01:09:07.221 --> 01:09:12.922]  It's also in the Wall Street Journal and several other publications I have here in front of me of what happened in the last two days.
[01:09:14.721 --> 01:09:20.604]  The media is trying to say the Arabs are doing this, or the Chinese are doing this, or the Russians are doing this.
[01:09:20.604 --> 01:09:27.587]  And certainly, they are the biggest holders of the greenback.
[01:09:27.587 --> 01:09:35.351]  But they're sitting there asking the private central banks that control the planet, why are you devaluing?
[01:09:35.351 --> 01:09:38.393]  And they're actually continuing to buy Treasury notes.
[01:09:38.393 --> 01:09:41.074]  So the dollar's going down while Treasury actually goes up a little.
[01:09:42.614 --> 01:09:49.056]  And so they're actually holding on saying, please stop, please stop devaluing it, please stop doing this.
[01:09:49.056 --> 01:09:56.479]  We're all holding trillions of dollars and trillions of treasury notes.
[01:09:56.479 --> 01:09:58.700]  Why are you doing this?
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:03.782]  And then our media says, the dirty Arabs, the dirty Arabs, they're killing the dollar, they're killing the dollar.
[01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:06.443]  But then simultaneously admitting the central banks
[01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:15.930]  The private Federal Reserve, the private families, and the Bank of England, same group, they are openly starting to move away from the dollar themselves.
[01:10:15.930 --> 01:10:19.412]  They are signaling the end.
[01:10:19.412 --> 01:10:22.454]  Just like Geithner did four months ago.
[01:10:22.454 --> 01:10:23.875]  By the way, that's in Fall of the Republic.
[01:10:23.875 --> 01:10:26.077]  We show how they're going to kill it.
[01:10:26.077 --> 01:10:27.478]  Just finished the film three weeks ago.
[01:10:27.478 --> 01:10:32.741]  And notice, right as the film's going to come out, they're going to be doing it right in front of everyone.
[01:10:35.287 --> 01:10:47.198]  That's kind of like how I went on air six months before, five months before, three months before, but two months before went on air and said, call the White House, tell them don't blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset Osama bin Laden.
[01:10:50.655 --> 01:10:54.196]  A bold move, but I mean I could clearly see what they were doing.
[01:10:54.196 --> 01:10:57.418]  Dollar loses reserve status to Yen and Euro.
[01:10:57.418 --> 01:11:11.984]  Ben Bernanke's dollar crisis went into a wider mode yesterday as the greenback was shockingly upstaged by the Euro and Yen, both of which can lay claim to the world title as the currency favored by central banks as their reserve currency.
[01:11:11.984 --> 01:11:14.885]  So you see, but that's a deceptive first
[01:11:16.417 --> 01:11:25.002]  First line of the article because Ben Bernanke is the head of the biggest regional consortium of the private banks.
[01:11:25.002 --> 01:11:27.083]  He's the head of the Federal Reserve.
[01:11:27.083 --> 01:11:36.928]  So it's saying, oh, Ben Bernanke's crisis got worse when his private owners started moving away from the dollar.
[01:11:36.928 --> 01:11:42.251]  Over the last three months, banks put 63% of their new cash into euros and yen, not the greenbacks.
[01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:50.114]  And that's JP Morgan Chase, that's the brokerage firms, Goldman Sachs, I mean, they're the ones!
[01:11:50.114 --> 01:11:57.337]  But they'll tell the good ol' boys the Arabs did it, and good ol' boys will say, nuke them then, I'm tough!
[01:11:57.337 --> 01:12:02.720]  I hate Arabs.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:11.765]  Over the last three months, see it started at the last G20, banks put 63% of their new cash into Euros and Yen, not the greenback.
[01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:15.132]  And within two years, it's going to be a tiny fraction.
[01:12:42.162 --> 01:12:48.146]  Bernanke could go down the economic history as the man who killed the Greenback on the operating table.
[01:12:48.146 --> 01:12:53.048]  Yeah, because he wasn't a surgeon operating, he was an executioner.
[01:12:53.048 --> 01:12:56.551]  Bernanke was the executioner flipping the switch for the lethal injection.
[01:12:56.551 --> 01:13:03.034]  He wasn't the doctor on the operating table.
[01:13:03.034 --> 01:13:08.538]  That's like saying Stalin was the patron of free market or something.
[01:13:12.239 --> 01:13:13.200]  I shouldn't laugh, man.
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.443]  This is gonna be one hellish depression.
[01:13:15.443 --> 01:13:18.747]  And they got the troops in place to crush ya.
[01:13:18.747 --> 01:13:21.850]  And to take everything we got and make our kids their slaves.
[01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:27.477]  And bring in the new green economy.
[01:13:27.477 --> 01:13:30.821]  But all you people that love tyranny, you're gonna get... It's like...
[01:13:31.909 --> 01:13:36.951]  Kind of like the old-fashioned thing they would do when you're 10, 11, 12 years old, and your dad would catch you smoking cigarettes.
[01:13:36.951 --> 01:13:45.654]  My parents never did this, but all the old-timers did it to their kids to try to cure them of smoking, and it worked in many cases.
[01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:49.496]  My mom quit smoking, I guess when she was about 28.
[01:13:49.496 --> 01:13:52.997]  I was four years old, and she went to schick.
[01:13:54.955 --> 01:14:06.341]  It was in Dallas, and it was in a room with dirty mirrors and piles of cigarette butts everywhere, and ashes all over the floor, and you sit in there and chain smoke for three days, and you know what?
[01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:06.842]  It cured her.
[01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:08.843]  She hates cigarettes.
[01:14:08.843 --> 01:14:10.504]  Me, I'd probably love going to the Schick Center.
[01:14:10.504 --> 01:14:14.826]  That sounds like a bottle of tequila.
[01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:15.607]  I'm joking, folks.
[01:14:15.607 --> 01:14:22.931]  The point is, it sounds like hell, actually.
[01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:40.213]  But wait, I was going into an analogy about too much of something and then got off into that story and then forgot about Bernanke.
[01:14:40.213 --> 01:14:45.857]  I guess the parallel is the tyranny.
[01:14:45.857 --> 01:14:52.402]  People are just going to be force-fed this and force-fed this and force-fed this until
[01:14:53.936 --> 01:15:00.521]  People revolt, and that'll be the excuse to crack down even more.
[01:15:00.521 --> 01:15:08.506]  Currently, dollars account for about 62% of the currency reserves at central banks, the lowest on record, said the International Monetary Fund.
[01:15:08.506 --> 01:15:12.169]  Bernanke could go down in history as the man who killed the greenback on the operating table.
[01:15:18.663 --> 01:15:19.604]  You know, I hate that.
[01:15:19.604 --> 01:15:26.548]  I'll tell a story and I'll actually go back to my memory and focus in and then I forget the point I was making previously.
[01:15:26.548 --> 01:15:27.668]  What was the point I was making?
[01:15:27.668 --> 01:15:38.134]  You guys remember before I was getting into the old-timers would catch their kids smoking cigarettes and make them go in a closet and smoke a whole package until they got sick?
[01:15:38.134 --> 01:15:39.955]  And I was talking about Bernanke.
[01:15:39.955 --> 01:15:41.476]  Who the hell knows what I was talking about?
[01:15:41.476 --> 01:15:45.558]  Oh, man.
[01:15:45.558 --> 01:15:46.299]  What's the point?
[01:15:48.939 --> 01:15:57.103]  Just having to sit here and hear about how Bernanke's trying to save us while it's the very central bank that's killing the dollar.
[01:15:57.103 --> 01:16:04.807]  After printing up trillions of new dollars and new bonds to stimulate the economy, the Federal Reserve Chief is now boxed into a corner.
[01:16:04.807 --> 01:16:07.008]  Oh, he can't help it.
[01:16:07.008 --> 01:16:09.569]  He can't help getting all this power.
[01:16:09.569 --> 01:16:14.092]  Battling two separate monsters that could devour the economy.
[01:16:14.092 --> 01:16:18.094]  Ravenous inflation on the one hand, and a perilous recession on the other.
[01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:24.773]  He's in a crisis worse than the meltdown ever was, said Peter Schiff, President of Euro-Pacific Capital.
[01:16:24.773 --> 01:16:29.117]  I fear that he could be the Fed Chairman who brought down the whole thing.
[01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:38.566]  Investors in central banks are snubbing dollars because the greenback is kept too weak by zero interest rates and a flood of greenbacks in the global economy.
[01:16:41.394 --> 01:16:43.056]  They grumble that they loaned the U.S.
[01:16:43.056 --> 01:16:45.678]  record amounts to cover its mounting debt.
[01:16:45.678 --> 01:16:48.941]  I mean, you gave the money to the private banks, you didn't loan us anything.
[01:16:48.941 --> 01:16:53.965]  But are getting paid back with a currency that's worth 10% less in the past three months alone.
[01:16:53.965 --> 01:16:57.429]  In a decade, it's down nearly one-third.
[01:16:57.429 --> 01:17:04.655]  And see, as this telescopes towards the end, it comes to a point where it loses more value in a month than it's lost in the last hundred.
[01:17:04.655 --> 01:17:05.836]  See how that works?
[01:17:05.836 --> 01:17:07.578]  We're now approaching that moment of truth.
[01:17:08.953 --> 01:17:13.196]  Don't worry, they'll give you some Arabs to kill and you'll love it.
[01:17:13.196 --> 01:17:19.741]  Yesterday, the dollar had a mixed performance, falling slightly against the British pound.
[01:17:19.741 --> 01:17:29.688]  Economists believe the market rebellion against the dollar will spread until Bernanke starts raising interest rates from around zero to high single digits and puts the flood of currency spewed from U.S.
[01:17:29.688 --> 01:17:31.570]  printing presses.
[01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:32.931]  You've got to cut that.
[01:17:32.931 --> 01:17:36.553]  That's secure, but it's also going to stifle any U.S.
[01:17:36.553 --> 01:17:37.734]  economic growth, says Schiff.
[01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:41.651]  They took the $23.7 trillion.
[01:17:41.651 --> 01:17:45.652]  If they would have pumped $23.7 trillion, and again, that's almost a three-month-old number.
[01:17:45.652 --> 01:17:46.893]  They still haven't given out the new numbers.
[01:17:46.893 --> 01:17:53.395]  It'll be above $28 trillion on the graph as we follow it, when they give the new numbers out.
[01:17:53.395 --> 01:18:05.199]  It's already above that, no doubt, but let's just say $23.7 trillion, that old number.
[01:18:05.199 --> 01:18:06.640]  If they would have put that into the economy,
[01:18:08.072 --> 01:18:22.903]  It would have been a bad precedent, making government the sugar daddy, but if they would have just written everybody a check for a couple thousand dollars or more, by the time the banks leverage it, it would have been hundreds of thousands of dollars per person.
[01:18:22.903 --> 01:18:28.107]  It would have caused bad inflation, but it would have actually built real economy.
[01:18:28.107 --> 01:18:36.634]  Instead, you get the death of Main Street, the banks loaning none of the money and whoring it all to buy other banks and insurance companies and vertically integrate infrastructure.
[01:18:37.082 --> 01:18:37.983]  And that's all that's happening.
[01:18:37.983 --> 01:18:41.024]  It's really very simple.
[01:18:41.024 --> 01:18:53.591]  And then you as the taxpayer get put on the line for paying the taxes to back all of this currency and credit issuance.
[01:18:53.591 --> 01:18:55.952]  You get to pay for all that.
[01:18:55.952 --> 01:18:58.853]  With interest.
[01:18:58.853 --> 01:18:59.554]  It really is.
[01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:12.159]  The biggest fraud in history, as Professor Black says in Fall of the Republic, by an order of magnitude.
[01:19:12.159 --> 01:19:14.461]  An order of magnitude.
[01:19:14.461 --> 01:19:18.464]  A exponential increase.
[01:19:18.464 --> 01:19:24.168]  I guess an order of magnitude would be instead of a million, we're talking about a billion.
[01:19:24.168 --> 01:19:26.230]  Instead of a billion, we're talking about a trillion.
[01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:28.352]  An entire quantum leap
[01:19:29.673 --> 01:19:45.437]  Just the total swindling by absolute made-off Kinley-type criminals, and they got the Army standing by, and the military works for them, and everybody thinks it's patriotic to walk through body scanners and have their kids told to spy on them.
[01:19:45.437 --> 01:19:49.798]  Not everybody, but a lot of idiots do, and so we're gonna get hurt real bad.
[01:19:50.575 --> 01:19:52.276]  They're just gonna continue it.
[01:19:52.276 --> 01:19:53.958]  They built their FEMA camps.
[01:19:53.958 --> 01:19:55.839]  They federalized the police.
[01:19:55.839 --> 01:19:59.482]  They want to run paramilitary snatch-and-grab operations against the American people.
[01:19:59.482 --> 01:20:01.103]  They beta-tested it in Pittsburgh.
[01:20:01.103 --> 01:20:07.568]  eCigarettesNational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:20:07.808 --> 01:20:09.490]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:20:09.490 --> 01:20:14.056]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:20:14.056 --> 01:20:21.746]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:20:21.746 --> 01:20:24.209]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[01:20:24.369 --> 01:20:26.610]  And has no dangerous second-hand smoke.
[01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:28.552]  So it's safe for the people around you.
[01:20:28.552 --> 01:20:32.854]  And will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.

[01:20:55.266 --> 01:20:59.447]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:21:14.907 --> 01:21:21.491]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:21.491 --> 01:21:23.453]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:23.453 --> 01:21:25.954]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:25.954 --> 01:21:36.942]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:21:37.535 --> 01:21:39.197]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.197 --> 01:21:41.059]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:41.059 --> 01:21:47.986]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:23:02.256 --> 01:23:07.559]  Hey everybody, this is Stephen Baldwin, and if your daily vitamin is in pill form, you're wasting a lot of your money.
[01:23:07.559 --> 01:23:10.720]  Put all that stuff away and call my friends at Chews for Health.

[01:23:15.643 --> 01:23:19.545]  Antioxidants, sea vegetables, and super fruit complexes.
[01:23:19.545 --> 01:23:22.306]  And being a chewable, it's more quickly absorbed into your system.
[01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:25.408]  Not pass through it like all those pills you've been taking.
[01:23:25.408 --> 01:23:26.709]  Save yourself some money.
[01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:30.211]  Do what I did and get 16 useful ingredients in one product.
[01:23:30.211 --> 01:23:31.552]  You won't regret the decision.

[01:23:58.587 --> 01:24:06.549]  Thanks.
[01:24:06.549 --> 01:24:11.491]  Talk about weird London Guardian reports, as well as Time Magazine.
[01:24:11.491 --> 01:24:18.613]  CERN physicist suspected of al-Qaeda links charged, he's a French physicist, working in the
[01:24:20.572 --> 01:24:23.134]  Gigantic Particle Accelerator.
[01:24:23.134 --> 01:24:26.216]  Physicists admit it could create a strangelet.
[01:24:26.216 --> 01:24:27.898]  It could create a black hole.
[01:24:27.898 --> 01:24:30.439]  But they say there's a low probability that it'll kill everybody.
[01:24:30.439 --> 01:24:32.681]  Ah, you know.
[01:24:32.681 --> 01:24:36.724]  In the 20s, they came up with equations to create A-bombs and hydrogen bombs.
[01:24:36.724 --> 01:24:45.050]  And similar equations show that this sucker could destroy the planet or the entire solar system or more.
[01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:46.511]  A twinkling of an eye.
[01:24:46.511 --> 01:24:47.212]  But they don't care.
[01:24:47.212 --> 01:24:49.794]  And then meanwhile, they say Al-Qaeda.
[01:24:51.249 --> 01:24:53.691]  Al Qaeda is CIA, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:53.691 --> 01:25:03.478]  They're just using this as an excuse to set up the police state crackdown and make the Hadron Collider and its activities secret from the public so no one can get an idea what's going on in it.
[01:25:03.478 --> 01:25:10.082]  They use that to put up a fence, a grid of control and national security.
[01:25:10.082 --> 01:25:12.644]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[01:25:12.644 --> 01:25:19.268]  Now, could this guy be some lone crazy scientist that wants to wreak havoc?
[01:25:20.259 --> 01:25:25.603]  With the Mega Gigantor Particle Accelerator.
[01:25:25.603 --> 01:25:30.186]  See, they're not just going to be slamming heavy particles into lead blocks.
[01:25:30.186 --> 01:25:33.388]  They're going to speed particles up and run them into each other.
[01:25:33.388 --> 01:25:34.409]  Just to see what happens.
[01:25:34.409 --> 01:25:35.230]  Oh, let's see.
[01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:37.411]  Let's accelerate uranium and plutonium.
[01:25:37.411 --> 01:25:47.098]  Let's accelerate other heavy particles into each other and see what they do.
[01:25:47.098 --> 01:25:47.879]  Hmm.
[01:25:47.879 --> 01:25:48.119]  Yes.
[01:25:49.755 --> 01:25:50.696]  We don't know what it'll do.
[01:25:50.696 --> 01:25:56.420]  It could be destructive, but we could also make all these great discoveries, so we're gonna do it.
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:59.402]  Woman disabled by flu shot.
[01:25:59.402 --> 01:26:03.045]  This is from Fox News in Washington, D.C.
[01:26:03.045 --> 01:26:04.967]  An Ashburn, Virginia woman
[01:26:06.826 --> 01:26:11.067]  "...is in the fight of her life after suffering a very rare side effect to the seasonal flu shot."
[01:26:11.067 --> 01:26:13.968]  I mean, I admit it's side effects in the insert.
[01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:16.468]  "...a vast majority of doctors say flu shots are safe.
[01:26:16.468 --> 01:26:21.809]  In this case, the FDA says they found nothing wrong with a particular batch, but sometimes there are complications."
[01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:28.471]  That's apparently what happened to Desiree Jennings, and now her life will never be the same.
[01:26:28.471 --> 01:26:31.351]  A 26-year-old Desiree Jennings was a pitcher of health.
[01:26:31.351 --> 01:26:32.952]  She's a Washington Redskins cheerleader.
[01:26:34.352 --> 01:26:35.534]  And a avid runner.
[01:26:35.534 --> 01:26:43.263]  Her life changed forever on August 23rd when she says she got a seasonal flu shot at a local grocery store, which has H1N1 in it.
[01:26:43.263 --> 01:26:47.027]  That's right, not just the supposed H1N1 shot, but it all has it.
[01:26:47.027 --> 01:26:51.432]  I was training for a half marathon then, said Jennings, crying.
[01:26:51.432 --> 01:26:52.854]  It just all went so fast.
[01:26:53.951 --> 01:26:57.274]  You've had an autoimmune response, lady, most likely from the doctors we've interviewed.
[01:26:57.274 --> 01:27:05.901]  You need to not eat any MSG, any aspartame, because that can help continue to cause a cascade effect, triggering what's happening in your body.
[01:27:05.901 --> 01:27:07.783]  Now that may be the problem, who knows?
[01:27:07.783 --> 01:27:09.064]  It's one of the most common.
[01:27:09.064 --> 01:27:12.206]  10 days after receiving the shot, she came down with the flu.
[01:27:12.206 --> 01:27:14.268]  After that, her health spiraled downwards.
[01:27:14.268 --> 01:27:17.330]  She started passing out and had to be hospitalized twice.
[01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:18.892]  Brain swelling.
[01:27:18.892 --> 01:27:19.993]  That's the number one side effect.
[01:27:21.357 --> 01:27:25.360]  Just hope the body doesn't start eating the brain stem.
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:34.669]  We went to an urgent care place, but they couldn't even let her get out of the truck because she was seizing in the back so bad.
[01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:35.950]  Ah, seizure!
[01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:40.954]  If you'd have been a toddler getting there around the shots, they would have CPS'd you, taken you, and arrested your parents.
[01:27:40.954 --> 01:27:44.037]  See, they don't just hurt you and give you seizures.
[01:27:44.037 --> 01:27:45.098]  They then take your children.
[01:27:46.684 --> 01:27:55.149]  Unless you're blessed and the child has the convulsion within minutes of the shot, which does happen quite often, then the doctors cover it up because they don't want liability.
[01:27:55.149 --> 01:28:03.853]  But if you have it in the car or you put the baby down and say, goodnight sweetie, I love you, and the baby says, goodnight mommy, in the morning you're never going to talk to baby again.
[01:28:03.853 --> 01:28:10.397]  If baby doesn't die, baby's going to drool and going to be in diapers for the rest of her or his life.
[01:28:10.397 --> 01:28:13.399]  And when you take her to the doctor, the police officers are going to come.
[01:28:14.491 --> 01:28:17.092]  Because this is how the globalists operate.
[01:28:17.092 --> 01:28:21.394]  Stupid morons with no medical training, told you've shaken the baby.
[01:28:21.394 --> 01:28:26.555]  Because when they CAT scan the baby, there's going to be brain swelling and blood on the brain.
[01:28:26.555 --> 01:28:30.297]  Oh, but the cheerleader could talk.
[01:28:30.297 --> 01:28:34.538]  The 26-year-old cheerleader could talk.
[01:28:34.538 --> 01:28:36.219]  And so she couldn't be CPS'd.
[01:28:39.741 --> 01:28:40.902]  So she was having seizures.
[01:28:40.902 --> 01:28:44.404]  They called an ambulance immediately, says her husband, Brendan Jennings.
[01:28:44.404 --> 01:28:50.407]  Doctors at Fairfax and John Hopkins diagnosed her with a rare neurological disorder called dystonia.
[01:28:50.407 --> 01:28:55.110]  See, she happened to run into true doctors who wouldn't just lie and cover it up for liability.
[01:28:55.110 --> 01:28:58.372]  They think it was caused by severe reaction to the flu shot.
[01:28:58.372 --> 01:29:01.674]  Desiree now has difficulty speaking and walking and even eating.
[01:29:04.571 --> 01:29:05.312]  Well, what's wrong?
[01:29:05.312 --> 01:29:08.656]  I mean, it's good for all the brain-eaten children out there.
[01:29:08.656 --> 01:29:10.078]  What's wrong?
[01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:12.841]  During an interview with Fox 5, she had several seizures.
[01:29:12.841 --> 01:29:15.965]  The effects were irreversible.
[01:29:15.965 --> 01:29:16.666]  That's right.
[01:29:16.666 --> 01:29:19.530]  It hits your brain stem and hit, hit it hard.
[01:29:21.499 --> 01:29:27.422]  The symptoms will get worse if I use my voice or walk when the brain signals are misfiring, says Jennings.
[01:29:27.422 --> 01:29:32.444]  Desiree reported her health problems to the Food and Drug Administration, thinking there might have been something wrong with her vaccine.
[01:29:32.444 --> 01:29:34.586]  But the FDA told her no!
[01:29:34.586 --> 01:29:37.327]  No, that's just a side effect!
[01:29:37.327 --> 01:29:43.670]  And we wish you were a child, because then we could kidnap you and get a bunch of medical funds out of you on the taxpayers' back.
[01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:44.490]  Ha ha ha!
[01:29:44.490 --> 01:29:46.051]  The plan's working perfectly!
[01:29:46.051 --> 01:29:48.072]  Ecoscience strikes again!
[01:29:48.072 --> 01:29:49.053]  We soft-killed ya!
[01:29:51.525 --> 01:29:55.449]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.449 --> 01:30:01.154]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.154 --> 01:30:04.176]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.176 --> 01:30:09.501]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.501 --> 01:30:11.563]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.563 --> 01:30:16.547]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.547 --> 01:30:17.488]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.728 --> 01:30:18.849]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.849 --> 01:30:20.730]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:21.811]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.811 --> 01:30:24.013]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.013 --> 01:30:25.354]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.354 --> 01:30:26.875]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.875 --> 01:30:32.139]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.139 --> 01:30:35.722]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.722 --> 01:30:39.205]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.545 --> 01:30:40.766]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.766 --> 01:30:41.667]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.667 --> 01:30:42.769]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.769 --> 01:30:43.710]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:44.811]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.811 --> 01:30:47.854]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.854 --> 01:30:50.057]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:50.057 --> 01:30:51.058]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:05.515]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.515 --> 01:31:10.041]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.041 --> 01:31:12.324]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.324 --> 01:31:13.946]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:13.946 --> 01:31:14.968]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.208 --> 01:31:23.631]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:23.631 --> 01:31:31.094]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:31:31.094 --> 01:31:37.116]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[01:31:37.116 --> 01:31:42.698]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:43.118 --> 01:31:47.280]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:53.462]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[01:31:53.462 --> 01:31:54.743]  866-762-9238.
[01:31:54.743 --> 01:31:58.044]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:32:01.055 --> 01:32:02.356]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:02.356 --> 01:32:07.940]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:12.963]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:12.963 --> 01:32:18.547]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:32:18.547 --> 01:32:23.230]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:23.749 --> 01:32:30.873]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.873 --> 01:32:31.994]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:31.994 --> 01:32:35.056]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:32:35.056 --> 01:32:38.678]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.678 --> 01:32:41.880]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:44.882]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.882 --> 01:32:45.142]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:45.142 --> 01:32:45.382]  Remember,
[01:32:53.803 --> 01:32:57.724]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:57.724 --> 01:33:04.745]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:33:04.745 --> 01:33:08.526]  They don't want to see us do nothing.
[01:33:08.526 --> 01:33:18.828]  All they want us to do is keep on busting and fighting.
[01:33:36.209 --> 01:33:48.794]  How do you care about sports, or money, or status, or going to cocktail parties, and trying to look smart, look handsome, look pretty, and social climb?
[01:33:48.794 --> 01:33:59.918]  How can you be worldly and petty when you know that hundreds of thousands of children a year, conservatively, from 1 in 25,000 30 years ago to 1 in 96,
[01:34:03.672 --> 01:34:12.876]  Are being completely brain damaged by vaccines via the autoimmune response from the adjuvant that is added.
[01:34:12.876 --> 01:34:19.038]  And I've had countless medical doctors, top neurologists, top brain surgeons on this show.
[01:34:19.038 --> 01:34:22.840]  And the drug company inserts admit it and they know it.
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:25.681]  And here's mainstream news reporting.
[01:34:25.681 --> 01:34:29.582]  The Food and Drug Administration says this is just a side effect.
[01:34:29.582 --> 01:34:33.204]  Ma'am, you're paralyzed and are going to have seizures for the rest of your life and maybe die.
[01:34:36.181 --> 01:34:44.464]  And if you have a child, it normally reaches the toxicity level at 18 months at the third round of shots.
[01:34:44.464 --> 01:34:47.945]  Most of the autistic children became brain damage at 18 months.
[01:34:47.945 --> 01:34:52.546]  They're walking, talking, happy, laughing, singing along to Sesame Street.
[01:34:52.546 --> 01:34:54.507]  It's over with the third round of shots.
[01:34:54.507 --> 01:35:01.569]  And then the families fight to keep their kids after the medical system has savagely attacked their brain and nervous system.
[01:35:02.478 --> 01:35:04.039]  You can have an autoimmune response.
[01:35:04.039 --> 01:35:05.140]  You can have all sorts of other responses.
[01:35:34.258 --> 01:35:39.102]  We're going to go over this woman disabled by flu shot reaction, and this is happening all over the place.
[01:35:39.102 --> 01:35:54.092]  Reuters came out, as you know, a month ago and said, with the parent company, of course, involved heavily with the flu vaccine, and said, oh, there's going to be millions dying, but that's normal to have millions dying of autoimmune problems and heart attacks, because it can also cause autoimmune response in the heart valves.
[01:35:54.092 --> 01:35:56.094]  The heart seizes up, and that's in the inserts.
[01:35:57.128 --> 01:36:01.851]  But they admit it does it in the inserts, but then publicly say it's impossible, it's not gonna happen.
[01:36:01.851 --> 01:36:06.714]  If you die or get disabled, it wasn't the shot, even though you think it happened when you took the shot.
[01:36:06.714 --> 01:36:08.936]  They're preemptively saying this can't happen.
[01:36:08.936 --> 01:36:16.221]  The problem is the medical doctors, who have actually read the literature, go, oh yes, this is the shot.
[01:36:16.221 --> 01:36:19.903]  Until they get the AMA call saying, no, you're not to practice medicine.
[01:36:19.903 --> 01:36:21.324]  We're telling you it wasn't the shot.
[01:36:22.588 --> 01:36:26.169]  Because Big Pharma and the eugenicist vaccine makers are taking over.
[01:36:26.169 --> 01:36:37.313]  We're going to talk about that and take your calls and get into a ton of other news that I haven't gotten into concerning the economy, the government takeover of health care, and a lot more.
[01:36:37.313 --> 01:36:47.177]  But I want to go now to our interview, our once a month visit with the Coloblue for the next few minutes here, because
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.183]  Well, if you're drinking tap water, you're insane.
[01:36:51.183 --> 01:36:55.147]  And most filter systems will reduce the number of dead bacteria.
[01:36:55.147 --> 01:36:58.491]  The water systems only chlorinate and kill the bacteria.
[01:36:58.491 --> 01:37:08.141]  You're drinking all the dead particulates and different bacteria that are carrying viruses and other things, and the chlorine doesn't kill the viruses.
[01:37:08.141 --> 01:37:10.784]  I mean, if you're drinking tap water, you're just asking for cancer.
[01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:14.170]  If you're in a fluoridated major city.
[01:37:14.170 --> 01:37:17.212]  Because the term fluoride is hundreds of chemicals.
[01:37:17.212 --> 01:37:19.094]  And I use an Ecolablue.
[01:37:19.094 --> 01:37:19.955]  It's a great system.
[01:37:19.955 --> 01:37:22.617]  It looks like a water cooler without a water bottle on the top.
[01:37:22.617 --> 01:37:24.118]  And it grabs the water out of the air.
[01:37:24.118 --> 01:37:27.941]  Their basic unit gets 7.5 gallons a day on average.
[01:37:27.941 --> 01:37:29.823]  And it's just an amazing system.
[01:37:29.823 --> 01:37:32.104]  For the first time, Ecolablue is selling the Ecolablue 28 for only $1,000.
[01:37:32.104 --> 01:37:33.145]  And that's 20% off
[01:37:40.515 --> 01:37:50.267]  A super deal, and to tell us about how long this deal is running is Lisa Pelton, the Director of East Coast Sales for AcolaBlue.com.
[01:37:50.267 --> 01:37:52.070]  Lisa, good to have you here with us.
[01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:53.011]  How are you today, Alex?
[01:37:54.614 --> 01:38:16.087]  I'm doing okay except I'm reading about all these people dying and getting sick from the flu shot and I can't seem to be able to warn enough people and it's it's I guess because I have a conscience I don't even think of myself as a good guy and I'm at a fundamental level I know that of all this carnage is going on by design it's it's it's it's it's very very upsetting to not be able to stop it.
[01:38:16.087 --> 01:38:21.871]  Well you know what Alex I have to tell you first of all you are my greatest influence
[01:38:22.358 --> 01:38:26.081]  And that's the reason why I'm here today talking to you about Okolo Blue.
[01:38:26.081 --> 01:38:35.648]  Because I was sitting in the city, listening to you, and realized that I needed to fix one of the fundamental necessities of my family's life.
[01:38:35.648 --> 01:38:38.291]  And that was water.
[01:38:38.291 --> 01:38:41.573]  And you led me to Okolo Blue, so I want to thank you for that.
[01:38:41.573 --> 01:38:42.954]  I didn't even know that.
[01:38:42.954 --> 01:38:44.175]  What a small world.
[01:38:44.175 --> 01:38:46.037]  That's right.
[01:38:46.037 --> 01:38:50.680]  And so, one of the things that Okolo Blue provides for you is
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:57.442]  Pure clean drinking water and cooking water right out of the air.
[01:38:57.442 --> 01:39:02.363]  So you don't have to rely on tap water for anything.
[01:39:02.363 --> 01:39:04.123]  A simple process.
[01:39:04.123 --> 01:39:05.104]  It's a great deal.
[01:39:05.104 --> 01:39:08.825]  It has a seven stage filtration process.
[01:39:08.825 --> 01:39:13.666]  Gets rid of all the things that we don't need to deal with right now.
[01:39:13.666 --> 01:39:16.527]  Plus UV sterilization.
[01:39:16.527 --> 01:39:18.687]  And this deal is for you today Alex.
[01:39:18.687 --> 01:39:18.827]  20% off.
[01:39:21.561 --> 01:39:24.764]  If you're a listener, give the coupon ALEXJONES.
[01:39:24.764 --> 01:39:27.667]  The sale runs through Monday, October 19th.
[01:39:28.891 --> 01:39:51.903]  Okay, so they go to Ecolablue.com, they can look at the whole wide range of products, but particularly on the Ecolablue 28, the big standard mainstay kind of Ford LTD of your models, but it's got Cadillac system, stainless steel tank that it holds the water in, $1,000, that's 20% from some previous prices, looks like it's more than
[01:39:52.403 --> 01:39:53.104]  That's correct.
[01:39:53.104 --> 01:39:53.484]  It's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:39:53.484 --> 01:40:01.449]  This is an absolutely perfect foundation for your family, Alex, to fight not only the things that are in our water,
[01:40:21.556 --> 01:40:26.421]  But one of the largest scams on humanity, and that's bottled water.
[01:40:26.421 --> 01:40:28.883]  So, it's a solution.
[01:40:28.883 --> 01:40:32.507]  And we deal in solutions.
[01:40:32.507 --> 01:40:33.127]  Absolutely.
[01:40:33.127 --> 01:40:35.610]  Well, I really do hope that people will get the Ecola Blue.
[01:40:35.610 --> 01:40:40.635]  You're not only a great sponsor that makes this show possible, it's a system that I really believe in, that's why.
[01:40:41.997 --> 01:40:47.182]  I got on a Call of Blue, used it, liked it, checked out some other systems, didn't like them as much.
[01:40:47.182 --> 01:40:48.644]  You guys had the best one.
[01:40:48.644 --> 01:40:56.912]  Called you, and it turned out folks at the company were listeners, so that's a really great cold call we made for an advertiser.
[01:40:56.912 --> 01:41:03.819]  Normally advertisers come to us, but this is an advertiser we went after because we believe in the product so much.
[01:41:03.819 --> 01:41:04.800]  It's the same thing with the
[01:41:06.533 --> 01:41:08.735]  Great folks at Calvin Pierce Soap.
[01:41:08.735 --> 01:41:10.336]  We actually went after them.
[01:41:10.336 --> 01:41:11.657]  And we're just glad to have you.
[01:41:11.657 --> 01:41:17.221]  Again, go to acolablue.com and people can put in the code.
[01:41:17.221 --> 01:41:19.743]  It's Alex Jones lowercase, right?
[01:41:19.743 --> 01:41:21.504]  That's correct.
[01:41:21.504 --> 01:41:24.106]  And that is a 20% discount today.
[01:41:24.106 --> 01:41:25.207]  And give that number out.
[01:41:25.207 --> 01:41:26.328]  Give that number out to people again.
[01:41:26.328 --> 01:41:27.029]  It's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:41:27.029 --> 01:41:27.429]  One more time.
[01:41:27.429 --> 01:41:27.489]  1-800-691-6043.
[01:41:39.650 --> 01:41:47.276]  And you've also got little converter systems that you can get at Acolabloo.com that then hook up to a solar panel.
[01:41:47.276 --> 01:41:53.662]  And I know a lot of people are using their Acolabloo and powering it off of solar panels.
[01:41:55.290 --> 01:41:56.411]  And it's a great system.
[01:41:56.411 --> 01:42:10.317]  It uses more energy at first, once it's doing its first batch of water, but once it's built up the condensation, and I don't know how to explain it, but it's been explained to me, the science of it, then it takes even less energy to run the Ecola Blue.
[01:42:10.317 --> 01:42:14.079]  And if folks want bigger units, you guys also have those, don't you?
[01:42:14.079 --> 01:42:19.382]  Yeah, we have whole house systems as well as commercial systems, Alex.
[01:42:19.382 --> 01:42:22.263]  The Ecola Blue 28 costs about 20 cents a gallon.
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:29.184]  Initially, if you're running it off your electricity, that's what you're going to end up paying.
[01:42:29.184 --> 01:42:35.309]  And you compare that to one little 16-ounce bottle of water that you're buying at the convenience stores these days.
[01:42:35.309 --> 01:42:40.113]  Also, the solar panels get you completely off the grid.
[01:42:40.113 --> 01:42:43.696]  Perfect for disaster preparedness.
[01:42:43.696 --> 01:42:44.717]  Absolutely, folks.
[01:42:44.717 --> 01:42:46.458]  Visit AkolaBlue.com today.
[01:42:46.458 --> 01:42:47.840]  You've got until Monday.
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:49.981]  What time, Lisa?
[01:42:49.981 --> 01:42:53.384]  It would be 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
[01:42:55.037 --> 01:42:55.977]  Okay, fantastic.
[01:42:55.977 --> 01:42:57.978]  Give that number out one more time.
[01:42:57.978 --> 01:42:58.638]  It's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:42:58.638 --> 01:43:03.800]  And Alex, thanks for doing the job you're doing.
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:04.921]  Oh, thank you for the support.
[01:43:04.921 --> 01:43:06.281]  Thank you for the great product.
[01:43:06.281 --> 01:43:07.162]  Colorblue.com.
[01:43:07.162 --> 01:43:10.043]  Thank you, Lisa Pelton.
[01:43:10.043 --> 01:43:11.683]  Okay, here's what I'm going to do now.
[01:43:11.683 --> 01:43:16.805]  I'm going to go to Randy, Donna, Ronnie, Scott, Karen, and many others that are holding.
[01:43:16.805 --> 01:43:20.947]  I do have a bunch of other news I want to get to with what's happening with Wall Street.
[01:43:21.912 --> 01:43:24.935]  Wall Street profits are at record highs.
[01:43:24.935 --> 01:43:26.557]  All time record highs.
[01:43:26.557 --> 01:43:35.746]  JPMorgan Chase records and files a record third quarter profits.
[01:43:35.746 --> 01:43:37.788]  They've never had profits this big.
[01:43:37.788 --> 01:43:39.470]  All the big banks, record profits.
[01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:43.014]  They got your $23.7 trillion in taxpayer money.
[01:43:43.014 --> 01:43:44.896]  They leveraged it through derivatives again.
[01:43:47.722 --> 01:43:49.483]  We're going to be covering that.
[01:43:49.483 --> 01:43:53.346]  I want to get into what's happening in Afghanistan and more on the health care bill.
[01:43:53.346 --> 01:44:10.378]  As the Wall Street Journal admits, and it's not the Wall Street Journal admitting, they've got the quotes from the head lobbyist, the head lobbyist for the health care industry, the spokesman, saying, oh yes, we basically wrote these different bills and we are supporting it.
[01:44:10.378 --> 01:44:13.000]  Now, you always hear in the news they're neutral.
[01:44:14.448 --> 01:44:26.038]  And then the controlled left media says, oh yes, the insurance companies say they're neutral, but they really don't want this.
[01:44:26.038 --> 01:44:27.359]  Well, no, that's another lie.
[01:44:27.359 --> 01:44:28.600]  They wrote it.
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:33.564]  But now they're saying they may pull out if Obama, and they list the things they don't like.
[01:44:33.564 --> 01:44:34.785]  This is quotes from them!
[01:44:34.785 --> 01:44:41.631]  I mean, I already knew this from watching the lobbying funding and who was writing the bill and the different lobbyists, but to see them
[01:44:44.033 --> 01:44:45.274]  Reportedly, it was a press conference.
[01:44:45.274 --> 01:44:47.355]  I guess there's video of it out there somewhere.
[01:44:47.355 --> 01:45:00.762]  It's got the name of the lobbyist, all of it, the head lobbyist, the spokesman for the healthcare industry, for the healthcare insurance industry, excuse me, saying, we want bigger fines on people to make them get insurance.
[01:45:00.762 --> 01:45:08.566]  I mean, that's all this is, is forcing you to give them money and then allowing them to lower the standard of care and be given liability protections.
[01:45:08.566 --> 01:45:10.948]  It's another tax, folks, and it's so bad.
[01:45:12.022 --> 01:45:15.504]  Because who do you think owns those big insurance companies, the private central banks?
[01:45:15.504 --> 01:45:18.085]  That's why the Federal Reserve is calling for this as well.
[01:45:18.085 --> 01:45:22.848]  They want in your life, and they can bring in a medical tyranny, which they're now doing.
[01:45:22.848 --> 01:45:24.329]  Randy in Chicago.
[01:45:24.329 --> 01:45:25.269]  You're on the air, Randy.
[01:45:25.269 --> 01:45:27.150]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:45:27.150 --> 01:45:31.452]  Greetings from the lion's den, so to speak, out here.
[01:45:31.452 --> 01:45:31.973]  God bless you.
[01:45:31.973 --> 01:45:32.473]  What's on your mind?
[01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:45.716]  Basically, I listen to the show every day and pretty much I got a visit today from the DWM, from the Department of Water, and I was just so compelled to call in and report this to you guys.
[01:45:45.716 --> 01:45:53.079]  We just got an automatic meter reading device installed on our meter system for our water.
[01:45:53.683 --> 01:45:58.926]  That's right, Chicago, Austin, LA, New York, hundreds of cities are getting them.
[01:45:58.926 --> 01:46:06.251]  They came here about three months ago, did NASCS, and it tracks off of the voltage what you're using, what you're doing.
[01:46:06.251 --> 01:46:10.653]  It's an incredibly sophisticated computer technology that knows the different
[01:46:13.129 --> 01:46:16.571]  Drawing systems off your power grid.
[01:46:16.571 --> 01:46:18.852]  It knows what a toaster is.
[01:46:18.852 --> 01:46:23.855]  It first assesses, okay, that's a washer, that's a toaster, that's a TV, that's a refrigerator.
[01:46:23.855 --> 01:46:30.299]  And it tracks what you're doing and they say they will turn your power off to teach you to conserve.
[01:46:30.299 --> 01:46:32.480]  They will tell you what the temperature of your house is going to be.
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:35.642]  This is all announced and going in nationwide.
[01:46:35.642 --> 01:46:37.283]  Tell me, Randy, what happened?
[01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:39.612]  Well, pretty much.
[01:46:39.612 --> 01:46:42.313]  We got a forewarning that they were coming today.
[01:46:42.313 --> 01:46:46.575]  He pretty much just left like about 30, 45 minutes ago.
[01:46:46.575 --> 01:46:52.558]  And, you know, the guy came in and went up on our, you know, storage area to install the device.
[01:46:52.558 --> 01:46:55.519]  Now I'm looking at the device, of course, you know, there's nothing wrong with it.
[01:46:55.519 --> 01:47:00.141]  So, you know, I asked him, I'm like, okay, well, what's wrong with the old one?
[01:47:00.141 --> 01:47:04.163]  And of course, you know, you get the, I don't know, I'm just, you know, following orders.
[01:47:04.861 --> 01:47:21.032]  You know, pretty much to install this, and the most interesting thing, because I asked for a pamphlet or some type of information for this, and the interesting thing, and I highlighted it right here, it says this equipment allows the Department of Water Management, the DWM, to collect media readings by radio signal.
[01:47:21.707 --> 01:47:25.830]  So it's to the point where they don't even have to knock on your door and say that we're reading your media.
[01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:32.376]  They just drive up and collect whatever type of information that they feel compelled to, you know, to basically pull from you.
[01:47:32.376 --> 01:47:40.822]  And who knows what's next as far as electronic meters or gas meter and so forth and so forth.
[01:47:40.822 --> 01:47:46.207]  Absolutely, and they sell to the public in the name of wireless reading, and that's been going on for the last decade.
[01:47:46.207 --> 01:47:49.950]  But the new systems, and I have seen articles out of Illinois where they're doing it,
[01:47:51.573 --> 01:48:03.417]  Track everything you're doing, and this is an Enron model of falsely manufactured artificial scarcity.
[01:48:03.417 --> 01:48:08.958]  And to boil it down, California is the model for the rest of the country.
[01:48:08.958 --> 01:48:19.642]  And they went in, and obviously the governor, Gray Davis, was a bad guy, and Schwarzenegger met with Ken Lay and others, this was in the news,
[01:48:20.919 --> 01:48:25.382]  They devised a plan to have the recall before it was even public.
[01:48:25.382 --> 01:48:28.224]  They had mainline Republicans as the heads of it.
[01:48:28.224 --> 01:48:41.854]  They then stood down, let Schwarzenegger win, knowing Republicans would put up with everything like gun control, open borders, more taxes, if the person had an R before their name.
[01:48:41.854 --> 01:48:45.036]  They knew he would go along with the global green taxes, all of it.
[01:48:46.178 --> 01:48:50.761]  So California could pass the laws to then beta test them for the rest of the country.
[01:48:50.761 --> 01:48:53.522]  Now, you're saying, what does that have to do with meter readers?
[01:48:53.522 --> 01:48:58.245]  California has already put in $5 million.
[01:48:58.245 --> 01:49:02.908]  And they say they're going to have $10 million in by next year.
[01:49:02.908 --> 01:49:05.089]  And $10 million is basically all the houses in California.
[01:49:05.089 --> 01:49:07.811]  There's only, what is it, $37 million in the state.
[01:49:07.811 --> 01:49:11.893]  So there's right around $10 million, maybe a little bit more, homes in the state.
[01:49:13.892 --> 01:49:25.036]  And they admit there, it tracks everything you do, and they said to teach you about the environment, we're gonna control what your thermostat is, we're gonna set it at 80, you don't need more than that.
[01:49:25.036 --> 01:49:39.360]  But going back to Enron devising this plan over a decade ago, even before they got Schwarzenegger online, remember the rolling blackouts in 2000, 2001, 2002, and it came out in documents that Enron
[01:49:43.055 --> 01:49:43.635]  We're good to go.
[01:50:01.274 --> 01:50:06.017]  People will then believe there's really no power and they will accept a tripling of prices.
[01:50:06.017 --> 01:50:09.919]  And some days they would steal close to a billion dollars.
[01:50:09.919 --> 01:50:12.020]  And they would steal billions and billions a week doing this.
[01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:15.582]  People who live in California remember.
[01:50:15.582 --> 01:50:20.465]  And then they got rid of Gray Davis saying he was behind it, he was actually fighting it, the one good thing he was doing.
[01:50:20.465 --> 01:50:27.089]  Then they put Schwarzenegger in the name of fighting it when he had been part of the inside deal and was actually invested in it.
[01:50:27.089 --> 01:50:28.750]  And that's how these people operate.
[01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:30.151]  I mean, it's so diabolical
[01:50:31.027 --> 01:50:33.487]  That they're now going to do this nationwide.
[01:50:33.487 --> 01:50:38.568]  I mean, does that sound like freedom to you, Randy?
[01:50:38.568 --> 01:50:45.710]  I'm a religious documentary listener, watcher, and everything, and in rhyme, and I saw the documentary and everything.
[01:50:45.710 --> 01:50:48.370]  It's just all crazy, and keep up the good work.
[01:50:48.370 --> 01:50:49.390]  Keep doing what you're doing, Alex.
[01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:51.490]  You got an advocate here in Chicago.
[01:50:51.490 --> 01:50:53.571]  All right, God bless you, my friend.
[01:50:53.571 --> 01:50:55.791]  I'm glad people are waking up, but is it fast enough?
[01:50:55.791 --> 01:50:58.332]  I mean, we got incoming here.
[01:50:58.332 --> 01:50:59.432]  This is the real deal.
[01:50:59.432 --> 01:51:00.192]  They're taking over.
[01:51:01.385 --> 01:51:06.067]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[01:51:15.623 --> 01:51:16.063]  I think so.
[01:51:32.361 --> 01:51:32.721]  I think so.
[01:52:01.494 --> 01:52:07.296]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.296 --> 01:52:14.279]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:21.414]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:21.414 --> 01:52:23.435]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:23.435 --> 01:52:25.937]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:25.937 --> 01:52:36.904]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:37.521 --> 01:52:39.182]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.182 --> 01:52:41.042]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:41.042 --> 01:52:47.944]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:53:00.988 --> 01:53:03.729]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:53:05.213 --> 01:53:05.473]  I think so.
[01:53:21.681 --> 01:53:21.921]  I think so.

[01:54:21.448 --> 01:54:27.812]  You know, Stalin wasn't a joke, Pol Pot wasn't a joke, Mao wasn't a joke, Hitler wasn't a joke.
[01:54:27.812 --> 01:54:31.074]  Government enslaving you and your family isn't a joke.
[01:54:31.074 --> 01:54:36.118]  The British government taking hundreds of thousands of poor people and putting them on ships.
[01:54:36.118 --> 01:54:38.779]  In many cases, 20-30% of them would die on the voyage.
[01:54:38.779 --> 01:54:41.601]  It wasn't just black slaves getting brought over to America.
[01:54:41.601 --> 01:54:48.426]  They would take the white slaves under the name of the law and put them in forced labor camps where the kids even grew up in Australia.
[01:54:51.266 --> 01:54:52.426]  That's what government does.
[01:54:52.426 --> 01:54:56.348]  It makes you slaves.
[01:54:56.348 --> 01:55:02.090]  And I'm going to continue with your calls, Donna, Ronnie, Scott, Karen, Sue, and others.
[01:55:02.090 --> 01:55:03.110]  Here's the deal.
[01:55:03.110 --> 01:55:06.972]  I have exhausted myself making Fall of the Republic.
[01:55:06.972 --> 01:55:11.313]  It is the most important and informative and powerful film I've ever made.
[01:55:11.313 --> 01:55:15.875]  Each film gets a little better each time, but this one is a quantum level better and more informative.
[01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:18.676]  They're all excellent in different ways, but this really is a good film.
[01:55:20.037 --> 01:55:23.820]  And it's up to you whether it's going to have a whimper or a big bang.
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:26.722]  And I think it's online to have a big, big bang.
[01:55:26.722 --> 01:55:28.843]  But start your engines.
[01:55:28.843 --> 01:55:31.185]  If you order it now, it pretty much isn't a pre-order.
[01:55:31.185 --> 01:55:36.769]  As we start shipping out next Tuesday and Wednesday, it comes out officially October 21st, Fall of the Republic, Volume 1.
[01:55:39.736 --> 01:55:46.563]  And there's a lot of Obama in there, but really Obama's on the cover, and the subtitle is The Presidency of Barack Obama.
[01:55:46.563 --> 01:55:53.810]  To get mainline Republicans to watch it, to think they're watching a Democratic bashing film, and then really we just break the paradigm.
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:57.741]  I'll be honest with the audience.
[01:55:57.741 --> 01:56:01.002]  I mean, it is about how he's a puppet, but how all presidents are puppets.
[01:56:01.002 --> 01:56:12.645]  And the left will watch it because they hate me, and they're George Soros funded, and they think that we're racist or something, you know, kind of the camp followers.
[01:56:12.645 --> 01:56:16.946]  And then they'll find out, oh my gosh, this is a paradigm shift, and they wake up.
[01:56:16.946 --> 01:56:19.887]  I mean, this is like a silver bullet to a werewolf.
[01:56:19.887 --> 01:56:22.968]  It's like a wooden stake to Count Dracula.
[01:56:24.622 --> 01:56:30.544]  This film is the truth, and it is a savage weapon against the enemy, if you will employ it.
[01:56:30.544 --> 01:56:34.245]  I mean, I've made the giant weapons depot for you.
[01:56:34.245 --> 01:56:40.168]  If you'll step up to the armory and take the weapon and open fire on the enemy, we're unstoppable.
[01:56:40.168 --> 01:56:48.991]  I mean, I've already got the White House listing me as an enemy, attacking me, pulling out all the stops everywhere and hit pieces almost every day now in major publications.
[01:56:48.991 --> 01:56:51.132]  And they always source the Obama deception.
[01:56:51.132 --> 01:56:52.112]  They are upset about it.
[01:56:53.772 --> 01:56:57.615]  And I'm not here risking my life to lose.
[01:56:57.615 --> 01:56:58.536]  I'm doing my duty.
[01:56:58.536 --> 01:57:01.598]  I'm stepping up to the plate against these people.
[01:57:01.598 --> 01:57:05.181]  And I'm asking you to step to the plate, too.
[01:57:05.181 --> 01:57:07.363]  I'm begging you, folks.
[01:57:07.363 --> 01:57:14.568]  I mean, they really do every day shoot kids up, and they have seizures, and it brain damages them, and most of the time they take the people's kids after they hurt them.
[01:57:14.568 --> 01:57:15.449]  That freaks me out.
[01:57:20.776 --> 01:57:29.118]  The more and more I realize, almost even doing this radio show, almost even getting up here and just calmly talking about it, almost lessens how serious it is.
[01:57:29.118 --> 01:57:31.779]  Just going about my business, almost, I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[01:57:31.779 --> 01:57:36.680]  I feel like I should do more, but I'm exhausted.
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:38.361]  I'm just going to ask you to do more.
[01:57:38.361 --> 01:57:39.501]  I can't do it all, folks.
[01:57:39.501 --> 01:57:40.842]  I need your help.
[01:57:40.842 --> 01:57:41.602]  You need my help.
[01:57:41.602 --> 01:57:43.462]  I need your help.
[01:57:43.462 --> 01:57:44.963]  Many hands make light work.
[01:57:44.963 --> 01:57:47.123]  For God's sakes, count the cost.
[01:57:47.123 --> 01:57:48.464]  This is real, folks.
[01:57:49.637 --> 01:57:54.458]  Order the Obama Deception at Infowars.com on the online video bookstore.
[01:57:54.458 --> 01:57:55.638]  Call and get it if you want.
[01:57:55.638 --> 01:57:55.698]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:55.698 --> 01:57:55.818]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:55.818 --> 01:57:58.279]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:57:58.279 --> 01:57:59.699]  Because getting the film out is the mission.
[01:57:59.699 --> 01:58:00.079]  It is the weapon.
[01:58:00.079 --> 01:58:00.799]  It is the victory.
[01:58:00.799 --> 01:58:01.980]  It is the truth.
[01:58:15.971 --> 01:58:21.853]  And by purchasing it, of course, and all the sponsors, you know, it's hard to fund this operation.
[01:58:21.853 --> 01:58:26.534]  I wish I could just give the film out for free, and we do to a certain extent.
[01:58:26.534 --> 01:58:32.996]  Regardless, get the film, get DVD burners, make hundreds and hundreds of copies, give it to everyone you know now.
[01:58:32.996 --> 01:58:33.936]  Get aggressive.
[01:58:33.936 --> 01:58:36.397]  Fill the garage with duplication equipment.
[01:58:36.397 --> 01:58:37.597]  Get aggressive.
[01:58:37.597 --> 01:58:38.797]  Take these people on.
[01:58:38.797 --> 01:58:39.458]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:39.458 --> 01:58:44.119]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.803 --> 01:58:55.045]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:55.045 --> 01:58:57.046]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:57.046 --> 01:59:05.571]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.571 --> 01:59:11.134]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:11.134 --> 01:59:12.735]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.975 --> 01:59:19.497]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.497 --> 01:59:30.539]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.539 --> 01:59:31.320]  That's right.
[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:33.880]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[01:59:37.401 --> 01:59:37.861]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.846 --> 02:00:08.607]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.607 --> 02:00:10.347]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.347 --> 02:00:11.948]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.948 --> 02:00:12.848]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.848 --> 02:00:17.690]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.690 --> 02:00:28.214]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.214 --> 02:00:31.655]  We got Stuart Rhodes coming up at the 8 after the second segment.
[02:00:31.655 --> 02:00:34.436]  Open phones today, talking about a host of issues with him.
[02:00:34.436 --> 02:00:35.897]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is coming up as well.
[02:00:38.018 --> 02:00:39.759]  Right now let's go to Donna in Ohio.
[02:00:39.759 --> 02:00:41.559]  Donna, welcome to the Airwaves.
[02:00:41.559 --> 02:00:43.780]  Hi Alex, so nice to talk to you again.
[02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:45.720]  Nice to speak to you.
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:49.162]  I know that you're getting wore out and everything, I could tell a little bit.
[02:00:49.162 --> 02:00:53.863]  So I took it upon myself to help you out.
[02:00:53.863 --> 02:01:02.386]  So everywhere I go, I tell everybody that you're on 900 AM up here in Ohio.
[02:01:02.386 --> 02:01:05.747]  And of course you don't stay on long enough for me, but
[02:01:06.295 --> 02:01:20.739]  Anyways, I've been telling everybody about the flu shot and where, you know, I don't come home a lot, you know, when you're, me and my mom go out and we stay out extra hours.
[02:01:20.739 --> 02:01:25.460]  And my mom looks at me when I start talking and she goes, do I have to find a chair?
[02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:28.001]  And I said, yes, you should go find a chair.
[02:01:28.001 --> 02:01:34.823]  I was just out, was talking, went shopping at Macy's and the girls all took out, you
[02:01:35.356 --> 02:01:39.057]  Pencils and papers and everything and I hope they're listening to you right now.
[02:01:39.057 --> 02:01:40.778]  I told them what was in the flu shot.
[02:01:40.778 --> 02:01:49.160]  I went to Target and I talked to the pharmacist and she said she knows what's in that flu shot and nobody should take it.
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:02:04.385]  Now two of my best friends took it after I gave them information at the kazoo and she told me that, well they're sick, they're real sick right now, and she told me that she went out and came back home
[02:02:05.334 --> 02:02:08.456]  And her husband started acting weird.
[02:02:08.456 --> 02:02:14.680]  He had, uh, they have a big sliding glass door in the, from the kitchen.
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:24.246]  And then, you know, it's cold up here in Ohio, so he was outside on the front porch with a coat on and the house was real cold on the inside.
[02:02:24.246 --> 02:02:30.709]  And he'll look at you now and he'll say, in the middle of your conversation, he'll say, what's your name again?
[02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:32.971]  I'm going, oh no.
[02:02:33.564 --> 02:02:38.910]  But my brother, who's a policeman, called me up and he's starting to hear things.
[02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:41.953]  And he told me, don't go around him for about three months.
[02:02:41.953 --> 02:02:45.717]  So I don't know where he got that at, but that's what he told me.
[02:02:53.945 --> 02:02:55.367]  The one they've been giving out the last two weeks.
[02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:57.289]  They're about to start the other injection.
[02:02:57.289 --> 02:02:59.011]  The nasal is live.
[02:02:59.011 --> 02:03:05.499]  It's called the live H1N1 nasal delivery vaccine is its name, technical name.
[02:03:05.499 --> 02:03:06.981]  And it says it's live virus.
[02:03:06.981 --> 02:03:08.303]  It breeds and then spreads.
[02:03:08.303 --> 02:03:10.405]  I mean, they just admit they're spreading it.
[02:03:10.405 --> 02:03:11.046]  I mean, it's...
[02:03:12.515 --> 02:03:17.038]  Again, they're so bold and insane in the way they do it.
[02:03:17.038 --> 02:03:22.882]  I mean, people are dying, they're getting maimed, they're having seizures, and it's all funny and cute.
[02:03:22.882 --> 02:03:25.604]  And then you warn your neighbors and they giggle and laugh at you.
[02:03:25.604 --> 02:03:29.387]  I mean, they're just... Man, I tell you, this is one sick country.
[02:03:29.387 --> 02:03:32.950]  I mean, that's all I can say.
[02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:34.791]  A lot of it is, it's not even that I'm tired.
[02:03:34.791 --> 02:03:38.153]  I am tired today because I didn't get to bed until about 4 a.m.
[02:03:38.153 --> 02:03:41.536]  It's that I'm humbled by the knowledge.
[02:03:42.768 --> 02:03:56.413]  And I have such an overwhelming amount of knowledge and understanding now that it's coming so much faster to me and it's so accurate that it's like a brain boost.
[02:03:56.413 --> 02:03:59.754]  I'm just completely blasted by knowledge now.
[02:03:59.754 --> 02:04:01.615]  I don't know how to describe it.
[02:04:01.615 --> 02:04:05.536]  And I guess once you get to a certain point of immersion in something,
[02:04:08.467 --> 02:04:14.969]  I don't know, it's just even trying to, and then marveling at the evil, marveling at the carnage.
[02:04:14.969 --> 02:04:27.774]  I've gotten to the point now where even the evil globalists, they're more like a mad dog or something, you don't even know what to do with them.
[02:04:27.774 --> 02:04:29.475]  I don't know, it's just indescribable.
[02:04:29.475 --> 02:04:36.578]  It's like Jesus said, forgive them Father, they know not what they do, because it is just to know
[02:04:37.617 --> 02:04:44.443]  That they are doing so many horrible things everywhere and it's just intensifying all around us.
[02:04:44.443 --> 02:04:46.605]  Just... It blows me away.
[02:04:46.605 --> 02:04:47.706]  The word is blown away.
[02:04:47.706 --> 02:04:49.908]  I am just blown away.
[02:04:49.908 --> 02:04:52.990]  And I appreciate your call, Donna.
[02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.391]  Keep it up.
[02:04:53.391 --> 02:04:57.534]  You're probably saving a lot of lives up there.
[02:04:57.534 --> 02:04:59.236]  In Ohio with the soft kill weapons.
[02:05:00.697 --> 02:05:04.079]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.079 --> 02:05:07.701]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.701 --> 02:05:12.283]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.283 --> 02:05:17.866]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:18.166 --> 02:05:22.929]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.929 --> 02:05:26.551]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.551 --> 02:05:31.374]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.374 --> 02:05:37.938]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.938 --> 02:05:39.879]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.379 --> 02:05:43.563]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.563 --> 02:05:48.068]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:05:48.068 --> 02:05:49.870]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:05:49.870 --> 02:05:50.230]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.230 --> 02:05:50.290]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.290 --> 02:05:50.851]  Don't wait.
[02:05:50.851 --> 02:05:51.331]  Call today.
[02:06:00.842 --> 02:06:08.587]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:06:08.587 --> 02:06:14.671]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:06:14.671 --> 02:06:17.633]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:06:17.633 --> 02:06:23.537]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:23.897 --> 02:06:25.478]  This book will work for anyone.
[02:06:25.478 --> 02:06:27.959]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:27.959 --> 02:06:33.602]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.602 --> 02:06:35.663]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.663 --> 02:06:37.424]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.424 --> 02:06:39.945]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:39.945 --> 02:06:44.688]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.688 --> 02:06:48.389]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.389 --> 02:06:50.531]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:06:51.511 --> 02:06:53.392]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:53.392 --> 02:07:01.094]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:07:01.094 --> 02:07:04.095]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.095 --> 02:07:09.437]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.437 --> 02:07:11.477]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.477 --> 02:07:16.479]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.479 --> 02:07:17.419]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.659 --> 02:07:18.780]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:20.681]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.681 --> 02:07:21.741]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.741 --> 02:07:23.942]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.942 --> 02:07:25.283]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.283 --> 02:07:26.824]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.824 --> 02:07:32.087]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.087 --> 02:07:35.669]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:39.131]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.491 --> 02:07:40.712]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.712 --> 02:07:41.613]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.613 --> 02:07:42.713]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.713 --> 02:07:43.634]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.634 --> 02:07:44.735]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.735 --> 02:07:47.797]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.797 --> 02:07:49.998]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.998 --> 02:07:51.099]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:51.099 --> 02:07:54.021]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.559 --> 02:08:23.022]  We're going to take the phone calls throughout this hour, and Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers, the founder of it, is with us.
[02:08:23.022 --> 02:08:26.683]  He was an aide to Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:08:26.683 --> 02:08:28.984]  He was a paratrooper in the Army.
[02:08:28.984 --> 02:08:32.506]  He decided to start Oath Keepers, which has really taken off.
[02:08:33.366 --> 02:08:37.288]  All over the nation, on the streets, not even when I'm at events.
[02:08:37.288 --> 02:08:39.990]  But I see people handing out Oath Keeper material.
[02:08:39.990 --> 02:08:43.712]  I see people handing out flyers about the carbon tax and world government.
[02:08:43.712 --> 02:08:52.777]  I went to Dutch Rochelle last week to pay for some gas in Austin, and there on the counter were Anti-Federal Reserve flyers.
[02:08:54.309 --> 02:08:57.091]  And I said to the guy behind the counter, I said, where did this come from?
[02:08:57.091 --> 02:09:05.096]  And he said, oh, the owner of this gas station, not the franchise itself, but the franchise owner of that particular shell put those out.
[02:09:05.096 --> 02:09:22.548]  And so everywhere you're seeing activism, and it's transcending the controlled left-right paradigm, and Oath Keepers is getting the military to say, we will follow our oath to protect and defend the Constitution and to not violate our oath, to not put Americans in FEMA camps, to not confiscate their guns.
[02:09:23.308 --> 02:09:29.410]  Now, big national media have written scores of articles attacking myself and Stuart Rhodes.
[02:09:29.410 --> 02:09:33.851]  They always include me into Oath Keepers, even though I'm not a military veteran.
[02:09:33.851 --> 02:09:37.132]  And they say, this group wants to overthrow the President.
[02:09:37.132 --> 02:09:39.592]  This group wants to have a war.
[02:09:39.592 --> 02:09:50.155]  This group, when Oath Keepers is about saying, we're not going to let criminals in government overthrow our country, and we are peacefully speaking out against violence.
[02:09:51.934 --> 02:09:57.480]  So there's a real attempt here to distort what's really happening.
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:02.645]  And we're seeing a lot of goading on the forums, a lot of pushing, and it's come out countless times.
[02:10:02.645 --> 02:10:14.558]  A big court case just got lost by a government employee in Canada, where it turned out that by day, he was a hate crime fighter, arresting people that
[02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:24.555]  Criticize any group in any way, or fining them, or feeing them, or... But by night, he was a Nazi actually out doing the events.
[02:10:24.555 --> 02:10:26.436]  This is how they work.
[02:10:26.436 --> 02:10:29.117]  Like they bombed Oklahoma City to blame it on the Patriot Movement.
[02:10:29.117 --> 02:10:30.498]  And that's all the evidence is there.
[02:10:30.498 --> 02:10:32.299]  I've had police on that investigated it.
[02:10:32.299 --> 02:10:33.200]  The bombs in the building.
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:35.441]  You know, the whole story.
[02:10:35.441 --> 02:10:43.946]  The way the New World Order is going to operate is, they're going to attack their own police and military to then get them to attack the American people and launch this war.
[02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:47.321]  We're trying to stop that from happening.
[02:10:47.321 --> 02:10:50.022]  We're going to talk about that today with Stuart Rose.
[02:10:50.022 --> 02:11:01.046]  We're going to talk about Oath Keepers is going to be linking up with 9-12 that Glenn Beck is one of the progenitors of.
[02:11:01.046 --> 02:11:02.646]  But the people in it are good.
[02:11:02.646 --> 02:11:06.508]  And I understand that a lot of people don't want to bash Glenn Beck.
[02:11:06.508 --> 02:11:06.768]  I just
[02:11:08.203 --> 02:11:32.552]  I guess we could have a moratorium on Beck and say, okay, Beck, if you ever come back and say there aren't FEMA camps again, or that maybe the veterans are dangerous and crazy, or maybe we should use troops against the American people, or Ron Paul's bad, you know, I've seen him at key junctures do this, and if you don't think the establishment doesn't want to lead our movement against the New World Order, you've got another thing coming.
[02:11:32.552 --> 02:11:37.074]  It's like the NRA authored the 1968 Gun Control Act.
[02:11:37.074 --> 02:11:37.554]  Did you know that?
[02:11:38.467 --> 02:11:40.670]  It's actually a pro-gun control group.
[02:11:40.670 --> 02:11:50.081]  It's members aren't, so I'm really concerned about that, but I think it's great to have our people not infiltrate, but go in with the true message into 9-12.
[02:11:50.081 --> 02:11:57.510]  I think oath keepers are just fabulous, as long as they keep their code of not going along with martial law, police state,
[02:11:59.091 --> 02:12:07.833]  And the 10 points that they swear that they're going to uphold.
[02:12:07.833 --> 02:12:15.475]  So a very, very complex issue here, but I'm glad that our audience has embraced Stewart Rhodes and Oath Keepers from its embryonic phase.
[02:12:15.475 --> 02:12:20.477]  I'm very honored to see Oath Keepers from its maiden voyage expand out into what it is today.
[02:12:20.477 --> 02:12:21.417]  There is an extra
[02:12:22.383 --> 02:12:23.644]  Thank you sir, honored to be here again.
[02:12:23.644 --> 02:12:24.324]  Appreciate it.
[02:12:47.381 --> 02:12:50.702]  I'll let you touch on the 9-12 thing real quickly.
[02:12:50.702 --> 02:13:10.029]  Whatever the involvement of Beck was, I talked to the national coordinator for 9-12, and in fact, she'll be, her name is Natta Davis, and Patrick Jenkins, founder of 9-12, is going to be at our convention this next weekend in Las Vegas, October 24th and 25th, as the first Goalkeeper convention.
[02:13:10.029 --> 02:13:14.111]  But I got a good sense from talking to her that her, she really is grassroots driven,
[02:13:14.811 --> 02:13:17.292]  Listen, I want to be clear.
[02:13:17.292 --> 02:13:18.912]  I hope you go on Glenn Beck.
[02:13:18.912 --> 02:13:20.452]  I hope Glenn Beck, like
[02:13:42.208 --> 02:13:46.390]  Saul of Tarsus gets knocked off his horse and wakes up and becomes a good guy.
[02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:49.632]  He just won't be on air very long, at least the level he is.
[02:13:49.632 --> 02:13:57.156]  I just know he's an operative, and I know he's there to get everybody's confidence and betray everyone, because he's proven it.
[02:13:57.156 --> 02:14:00.078]  And I've listened to him and watched him with great detail.
[02:14:00.078 --> 02:14:04.860]  Overall, I think some of what he's doing is positive, but he's only doing that so he can double back later.
[02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:09.323]  So I don't want to just get into this here and say, how dare the 9-12 Project get involved.
[02:14:09.323 --> 02:14:10.003]  This is good.
[02:14:10.003 --> 02:14:11.324]  This is the true patriots.
[02:14:12.845 --> 02:14:19.572]  Beck tried to take over what we started, now we're going back and taking over what is rightfully ours.
[02:14:19.572 --> 02:14:22.735]  The tea parties, 9-12, everything else.
[02:14:22.735 --> 02:14:28.181]  And I think, you know, on the surface we should be friendly towards Beck, and I didn't even mean to get off into that.
[02:14:28.181 --> 02:14:35.869]  You just told me off-air that it looks like you guys are going to be part of the next big 9-12 event, and so I think that's very, very important.
[02:14:36.796 --> 02:14:46.998]  Well, what they approached me about was that they want to do a big summit of all the different liberty leaders to come together, and all the different organizations, and they're targeting April for that, April 15th or 19th.
[02:14:46.998 --> 02:14:51.719]  But I just talked to her again and encouraged her to think about doing one a lot sooner, because we're running out of time.
[02:14:51.719 --> 02:14:58.540]  And so I propose that we do one on December 15th and 16th, which is Bill of Rights Day, and the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party.
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:02.241]  Hold a symposium of national liberty leaders, everybody.
[02:15:02.853 --> 02:15:03.193]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:15:24.043 --> 02:15:25.084]  No.
[02:15:25.084 --> 02:15:27.485]  Well, I was invited to that.
[02:15:27.485 --> 02:15:31.488]  I didn't go because I was too busy working on the film.
[02:15:31.488 --> 02:15:33.029]  And I think it's a fine idea.
[02:15:33.029 --> 02:15:39.452]  It's just having only a select coterie of leaders together, I don't think is the way I would go.
[02:15:39.452 --> 02:15:47.537]  To have a huge throng of different people together, as long as... But see, 9-12's setting it up.
[02:15:47.537 --> 02:15:48.798]  They're going to direct it, I guess.
[02:15:49.420 --> 02:15:52.544]  No, she's open to having my input.
[02:15:52.544 --> 02:15:57.371]  It's not going to be just, you know, it's got to be a certain elite.
[02:15:57.371 --> 02:16:00.035]  It's everyone from across the country, all different craftsmen.
[02:16:00.035 --> 02:16:00.495]  No, I know.
[02:16:00.495 --> 02:16:04.100]  I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I hope that the big event is directed
[02:16:06.132 --> 02:16:10.078]  By all the groups that are there and not just the 9-12 Project.
[02:16:10.078 --> 02:16:14.203]  It's not about 9-12, it's about getting everyone together.
[02:16:14.203 --> 02:16:16.527]  Call it an Oath Keeper Summit.
[02:16:16.527 --> 02:16:20.452]  It's about our oath to the Constitution and it's about getting together and working together.
[02:16:20.672 --> 02:16:23.294]  Hey, regardless, we need to get together and I absolutely agree with you.
[02:16:23.294 --> 02:16:24.695]  That's exciting.
[02:16:24.695 --> 02:16:27.638]  Let's shift gears now into all the attack pieces.
[02:16:27.638 --> 02:16:31.020]  There's so many, I don't even read them all now when I see the headlines.
[02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:34.403]  But I notice you and I are being attacked together.
[02:16:34.403 --> 02:16:43.791]  You'll have like a 5, 10, some cases ADL, 15 page report, Southern Poverty Law Center, George Soros groups, and they always put you and I together.
[02:16:45.632 --> 02:16:49.054]  They think associating with you scares me.
[02:16:49.054 --> 02:16:50.135]  And vice versa.
[02:16:50.135 --> 02:16:52.697]  I guess they think that's some kind of a plus.
[02:16:52.697 --> 02:16:56.360]  But it works in our favor, I think.
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:00.623]  Sure, but they're also trying to imply that we're calling for revolution and violence.
[02:17:00.623 --> 02:17:04.866]  Meanwhile, they've got their operatives out trying to stir up violence.
[02:17:04.866 --> 02:17:06.987]  They're kind of in a 1990s model.
[02:17:06.987 --> 02:17:08.869]  I don't see this working today.
[02:17:08.869 --> 02:17:10.630]  I think people are looking right through them.
[02:17:11.721 --> 02:17:19.970]  Well, and also the message of Oath Keepers is that you do not have to violate the Constitution to save it.
[02:17:19.970 --> 02:17:25.717]  And this is what's different between us and other countries, like Nazi Germany, where the oath was to the Fuhrer.
[02:17:25.717 --> 02:17:28.540]  Their only chance of ever saving Germany would be to
[02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:29.420]  We're good to go.
[02:17:52.748 --> 02:17:53.668]  Then we win.
[02:17:53.668 --> 02:17:54.769]  But how can they do it without?
[02:17:54.769 --> 02:17:56.209]  They'd have to bring in foreign troops.
[02:17:56.209 --> 02:17:57.249]  Well, sure, sure.
[02:17:57.249 --> 02:18:05.111]  I mean, to boil it down, somebody's got to say it's wrong to train to confiscate guns, it's wrong to build FEMA camps, that's all admitted now.
[02:18:05.111 --> 02:18:10.853]  It's wrong to put military on the streets of America for regular police actions and not just emergencies.
[02:18:10.853 --> 02:18:14.154]  All of this is clearly authoritarian, un-American.
[02:18:14.154 --> 02:18:15.714]  History shows it's bad.
[02:18:15.714 --> 02:18:18.235]  We know the federal government's been hijacked by foreign banks.
[02:18:18.795 --> 02:18:38.994]  And just shake our heads, kind of wake ourselves up, put our heads in a bucket of ice water and go, wait a minute, foreign offshore banks run by people like Ken Lay and Madoff have come in, taken over, and are engaged in crime, and now the criminals are trying to direct the military and police to break their oaths
[02:18:39.594 --> 02:18:41.835]  To protect the corrupt elite?
[02:18:41.835 --> 02:18:42.295]  No!
[02:18:42.295 --> 02:18:44.316]  Just follow the Constitution!
[02:18:44.316 --> 02:18:45.897]  Start saying no!
[02:18:45.897 --> 02:18:56.481]  But the establishment, by increments, trains police and military to violate the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, a little bit by a little bit, but before they know it, they've been completely twisted.
[02:18:57.495 --> 02:19:03.941]  Right, and then there's defenders standing on the streets and dispersing people, protesters, and using sound cameras on them.
[02:19:03.941 --> 02:19:12.108]  So that's the whole point of our message is to counteract that and to teach them about the Constitution and get them back to square one of being defenders
[02:19:13.578 --> 02:19:15.819]  But there's that powerful peer pressure mode.
[02:19:15.819 --> 02:19:23.142]  I mean, I would imagine of the thousands of police and military batoning women running for no reason, having police dogs bite old women.
[02:19:23.142 --> 02:19:24.383]  I mean, there's video of this.
[02:19:24.383 --> 02:19:29.986]  Driving through empty neighborhoods, sound canoning a kid as they walked out their front door with a football.
[02:19:29.986 --> 02:19:34.148]  I mean, just, you're not allowed on the streets of Pittsburgh or Oakland, Pennsylvania.
[02:19:34.148 --> 02:19:40.511]  We come back, I want to talk about that because I'm sure some of those troops and police were good people, but in that mass psychology of war,
[02:19:41.511 --> 02:19:53.723]  And with all the psychological brainwashing they've gone through, the hypnotic suggestions of their training, when the time came, I mean, they were looking for blood.
[02:19:53.723 --> 02:19:55.385]  They wanted the blood of the American people.
[02:19:55.385 --> 02:19:58.628]  We'll talk about that with Stuart Rose, the founder of Oathkeeper, straight ahead.
[02:20:01.263 --> 02:20:17.412]  When you're ready to purify your family's drinking water and save money, when you're ready to remove contaminants like chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, pharmaceutical drugs, and even iron and rust from your water and save money, when you're ready to enjoy crisp, clean water and save money, go to PureWaterFreedom.com.

[02:20:29.780 --> 02:20:32.621]  Our under sink reverse osmosis system is only $249.

[02:20:42.688 --> 02:20:43.068]  I think so.
[02:21:01.164 --> 02:21:03.345]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:03.345 --> 02:21:04.186]  Spy on me?
[02:21:04.186 --> 02:21:04.526]  Yeah.
[02:21:04.526 --> 02:21:09.569]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:21:09.569 --> 02:21:11.189]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:21:11.189 --> 02:21:11.930]  Startpage?
[02:21:11.930 --> 02:21:12.350]  Yeah.
[02:21:12.350 --> 02:21:13.451]  Startpage.com.
[02:21:13.451 --> 02:21:16.412]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:21:16.412 --> 02:21:20.274]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:21:20.274 --> 02:21:23.076]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:21:23.416 --> 02:21:26.038]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:21:26.038 --> 02:21:27.619]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:21:27.619 --> 02:21:27.920]  Right!

[02:21:37.027 --> 02:21:40.810]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[02:22:01.687 --> 02:22:03.727]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:03.727 --> 02:22:06.688]  In no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[02:22:06.688 --> 02:22:09.229]  Certainly not in my 17 years in the industry.
[02:22:09.229 --> 02:22:11.649]  Nearly 100 banks have been shuttered this year.
[02:22:11.649 --> 02:22:14.810]  As many as 200 more banks are suspect by year's end.
[02:22:14.810 --> 02:22:17.251]  The FDIC is operating in the red.
[02:22:17.251 --> 02:22:18.331]  Who pays for that?
[02:22:18.331 --> 02:22:19.531]  Is your money safe?
[02:22:19.531 --> 02:22:23.592]  The dollar has lost over 95% of its value in the last 60 years.
[02:22:23.592 --> 02:22:26.933]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[02:22:26.933 --> 02:22:28.213]  Ours is not immune.
[02:22:28.213 --> 02:22:30.394]  The time is now to be proactive.
[02:22:30.394 --> 02:22:31.194]  Anything tied to the

[02:22:34.492 --> 02:22:36.493]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:22:36.493 --> 02:22:37.293]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[02:22:37.293 --> 02:22:38.293]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:23:01.465 --> 02:23:06.086]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[02:24:03.652 --> 02:24:06.353]  Stuart Rhodes is our guest.
[02:24:06.353 --> 02:24:08.614]  Stuart-Rhodes.blogspot.com.
[02:24:08.614 --> 02:24:13.856]  You can also go to the Oath Keepers website, OathKeepers.org.
[02:24:13.856 --> 02:24:16.497]  We'll tell you about the Big Las Vegas event, their first annual meeting.
[02:24:16.497 --> 02:24:17.917]  You'll want to be there.
[02:24:17.917 --> 02:24:19.998]  Stuart's a founder and director of Oath Keepers.
[02:24:19.998 --> 02:24:20.718]  He served as a U.S.
[02:24:20.718 --> 02:24:22.079]  Army paratrooper until he disabled.
[02:24:22.859 --> 02:24:25.741]  And a rough terrain parachuting accident during a night jump.
[02:24:25.741 --> 02:24:29.925]  He is a former firearms instructor and former member representative of Ron Paul's DC staff.
[02:24:29.925 --> 02:24:34.068]  Stewart currently writes the monthly Enemy at the Gates column for SWAT Magazine.
[02:24:34.068 --> 02:24:35.669]  So they're reaching out to those people.
[02:24:35.669 --> 02:24:37.311]  Stewart graduated from Yale Law School.
[02:24:39.093 --> 02:24:45.656]  Where his paper, Solving the Puzzle of Enemy Combatant Status, won Yale's Miller Prize for Best Paper on the Bill of Rights.
[02:24:45.656 --> 02:24:46.937]  He assisted teaching U.S.
[02:24:46.937 --> 02:24:54.141]  military history at Yale, was a Yale research scholar, and is writing a book on the dangers of applying the laws of war to the American people.
[02:24:54.141 --> 02:24:59.584]  And he's a great leader, and we're honored to have men of his caliber fighting the globalist takeover.
[02:24:59.584 --> 02:25:02.986]  And he's another testament to taking action.
[02:25:02.986 --> 02:25:05.127]  Oathkeeper's been around how long?
[02:25:05.127 --> 02:25:07.308]  I mean, it's everywhere now, it's exploding.
[02:25:09.636 --> 02:25:17.098]  First official meeting on the Green Election this last year, this year, April 19, 2009.
[02:25:17.098 --> 02:25:18.798]  So it's less than a year old?
[02:25:18.798 --> 02:25:20.358]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:25:20.358 --> 02:25:25.019]  We're in our baby infancy stage, but it's growing like wildfire.
[02:25:25.019 --> 02:25:31.100]  We have directors now in about half the states, and our goal is to have strong Oath Keeper chapters in every county.
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:33.001]  Because we've got to protect the country from the county up.
[02:25:33.792 --> 02:25:46.199]  Well Stuart, I'm going to be honest with you, and I'm not telling you to get into politics because what you're doing is more important than the grassroots right now, but I'm not impressed with some of the people running under the Ron Paul banner.
[02:25:46.199 --> 02:25:50.101]  I'm not impressed with how they compromise.
[02:25:50.101 --> 02:25:53.803]  I'm not talking about Ron Paul himself, but some of the people kind of running on his coattails.
[02:25:53.803 --> 02:25:59.907]  You are the type of person, that's what's good about Oath Keepers, we'll find more high caliber people who we should run for Congress.
[02:26:01.032 --> 02:26:07.661]  Well, I don't think I've ever worked for office because I think I'm much better at going and finding folks.
[02:26:07.661 --> 02:26:13.569]  For example, there's a candidate in Orange County for sheriff there, Bill Hunt, who we're putting behind.
[02:26:17.026 --> 02:26:22.368]  And I think he's a pretty committed patriot in the lines of Sheriff Mack.
[02:26:22.368 --> 02:26:25.029]  And that's where I would start as a sheriff, right here in the county.
[02:26:25.029 --> 02:26:28.171]  And Kent Harris up in Uniquay County, Tennessee, we were just there.
[02:26:28.171 --> 02:26:29.872]  In fact, Chuck Balton was there, too.
[02:26:29.872 --> 02:26:36.734]  And his son, Tim Balton, were there for a patriot rally up in Uniquay County in the northeastern corner of Tennessee.
[02:26:36.734 --> 02:26:38.515]  And that's a pretty squared away sheriff, too.
[02:26:38.515 --> 02:26:40.196]  And there was a bunch of folks there, open carrying.
[02:26:40.766 --> 02:26:43.528]  And the Sheriff there endorsed and supported that.
[02:26:43.528 --> 02:26:44.509]  He wants people to do that.
[02:26:44.509 --> 02:26:46.330]  He wants to exercise their rights.
[02:26:46.330 --> 02:26:49.572]  So, those are all good things.
[02:26:49.572 --> 02:26:56.817]  Yeah, the open carry is really going to defeat the gun grabbers, because as you know, they advertise all over TV that owning guns is illegal.
[02:26:56.817 --> 02:27:00.179]  Then they base all those TV shows in New York where they are.
[02:27:00.179 --> 02:27:05.243]  And so, all over the country, people are getting the... I mean, have you seen the John Elway Homeland Security video?
[02:27:05.243 --> 02:27:07.985]  They're showing citizens where he's... Yeah, I did see that, yeah.
[02:27:08.325 --> 02:27:14.427]  Well, for those that don't know, they show gold and say terrorists in their home may have gold or they may have firearms.
[02:27:14.427 --> 02:27:16.408]  Call the police if you see firearms.
[02:27:16.408 --> 02:27:22.950]  I mean, we've got to start wearing our guns openly to just educate the sheeple that guns aren't illegal.
[02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:26.251]  Yeah, but they don't even know that open carry is legal in most states.
[02:27:26.251 --> 02:27:37.195]  And that's why folks are doing that, is to put the point across that, hey, I'm not violating any code, I'm not violating any statute by standing here with a safely holstered firearm.
[02:27:37.947 --> 02:27:42.968]  Well, Stuart, I can't stress enough how much your organization is scaring the globalists.
[02:27:42.968 --> 02:27:50.890]  I mean, they admit they are scared of the police and military being recruited by the patriots and just learning what it is to be an American, rediscovering that.
[02:27:50.890 --> 02:27:55.792]  We're going to go to break, and I want to come back and let you have the floor and then take some calls, but you started getting into G20.
[02:27:57.296 --> 02:28:09.365]  Watching the videos of police dogs biting old women coming out of shops with bags, sound canoning peaceful neighborhoods, going into the university at night saying you can't be out, chasing women down, Billy clubbing them.
[02:28:09.365 --> 02:28:11.826]  I mean, that is tyranny.
[02:28:11.826 --> 02:28:13.307]  Well, it's kind of like having Katrina.
[02:28:13.307 --> 02:28:15.389]  You had police brought in from all over the country.
[02:28:15.962 --> 02:28:16.403]  I don't know.
[02:28:36.062 --> 02:28:37.262]  You know, it's like having a hammer.
[02:28:37.262 --> 02:28:40.183]  All you have is a hammer, and everything looks like a nail.
[02:28:40.183 --> 02:28:42.824]  And so once you're in that riot mode, it's hard to get them out of that.
[02:28:42.824 --> 02:28:43.564]  Well, exactly.
[02:28:43.564 --> 02:28:50.487]  You get macho men, warriors who are designed to go charging into other men with swords and axes, hacking each other.
[02:28:50.487 --> 02:28:53.968]  That normal part of the brain kicks in, but it's college kids.
[02:28:53.968 --> 02:28:58.469]  They have a few hired anarchists, throw a few things, and then they go on a police rampage.
[02:28:58.469 --> 02:29:00.710]  They are being psychologically manipulated.
[02:29:01.724 --> 02:29:12.648]  Exactly, and that's why, I mean, like with Luke Rudowsky's attempt to talk to Dr. Oak, it's necessary to do that, but by that point it's oftentimes too late because they're locked into that mode.
[02:29:12.648 --> 02:29:14.969]  You've got to reach them, you've got to reach them before they get to that point.
[02:29:14.969 --> 02:29:18.531]  And you've got to talk to them about how it's not proper to go from L.A.
[02:29:18.531 --> 02:29:23.173]  or wherever they're from and go to another city and become nationalized.
[02:29:23.173 --> 02:29:25.114]  That's the first line right there.
[02:29:25.114 --> 02:29:25.914]  They shouldn't be doing that.
[02:29:27.324 --> 02:29:28.545]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:28.545 --> 02:29:44.195]  I want to speak about how they bring these swarms of police from all over the nation to New Orleans or to Pittsburgh or to other areas and then G20 private security in police uniforms grabbing citizens off the street into unmarked cars.
[02:29:44.195 --> 02:29:51.380]  We'll get Stewart Rhodes' take on that straight ahead.
[02:29:51.380 --> 02:29:52.781]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.781 --> 02:29:54.282]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.291 --> 02:30:00.893]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.893 --> 02:30:05.135]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.135 --> 02:30:07.135]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.135 --> 02:30:15.658]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.658 --> 02:30:21.200]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:22.821]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:23.061 --> 02:30:29.586]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.586 --> 02:30:40.635]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.635 --> 02:30:42.016]  That's right, clean water.
[02:30:42.316 --> 02:30:43.958]  Right from the air you breathe.

[02:31:00.734 --> 02:31:06.061]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:06.061 --> 02:31:10.587]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.587 --> 02:31:12.870]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:14.492]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.492 --> 02:31:15.514]  There is a solution.

[02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:13.624]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:23.481]  Stuart Rhodes is our guest.
[02:33:23.481 --> 02:33:29.024]  Your phone calls, Ronnie, Scott, Karen, Mark, Bob and others are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:33:29.024 --> 02:33:39.249]  Stuart, I was making the point as we went to break about how they're clearly turning the military and the police loose on the people.
[02:33:39.249 --> 02:33:44.872]  They're clearly training them that it's macho and cool to do all of this.
[02:33:44.872 --> 02:33:47.354]  That's why Oath Keepers is here, to go out and reach out to them.
[02:33:50.103 --> 02:34:04.231]  And I also want to get your take just on all the other announcements we're seeing and all the different reports of urban warfare drills and the military coming out on the streets and running checkpoints.
[02:34:04.231 --> 02:34:06.232]  What are the military sources you have saying?
[02:34:06.232 --> 02:34:07.812]  Are they really starting to get upset about this?
[02:34:07.812 --> 02:34:09.253]  Excuse me?
[02:34:09.253 --> 02:34:11.294]  I couldn't hear you.
[02:34:11.294 --> 02:34:16.057]  Are your military sources getting upset about the deployment of military forces on the streets?
[02:34:17.065 --> 02:34:18.827]  Oh, you bet!
[02:34:18.827 --> 02:34:25.875]  Here's the thing though, that's a powerful, as powerful as any conditioning that's been attempted on the military has been done to them.
[02:34:25.875 --> 02:34:27.176]  I mean, it's been going on for decades.
[02:34:27.176 --> 02:34:31.822]  That was the whole, ever since the 90s, that was the whole point of Lieutenant Commander Cunningham's survey.
[02:34:32.462 --> 02:34:33.524]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:34:51.964 --> 02:34:53.625]  Um, you know, the founders are no dummies.
[02:34:53.625 --> 02:34:55.166]  They put it there for a good reason.
[02:34:55.166 --> 02:35:00.008]  They remind them of their oath, and an old white book goes up over their heads, and they're like, oh yeah, but what does that mean?
[02:35:00.008 --> 02:35:07.252]  That means I have to read the Constitution to understand it, and then once I understand where the lines are drawn, I have to stand.
[02:35:07.252 --> 02:35:10.134]  And so that's the thing that's grabbing them.
[02:35:10.134 --> 02:35:11.154]  And it's working.
[02:35:11.154 --> 02:35:11.975]  That's what we saw.
[02:35:17.930 --> 02:35:19.511]  Yeah, we're losing your phone.
[02:35:19.511 --> 02:35:27.554]  Are you on a Skype phone or voice over IP phone, Stuart?
[02:35:27.554 --> 02:35:31.735]  Yeah, we might need to just cancel ever doing Skype phone systems.
[02:35:31.735 --> 02:35:32.835]  Or maybe our system.
[02:35:32.835 --> 02:35:35.116]  That's what ours is.
[02:35:35.116 --> 02:35:39.598]  But we'll try to get him back on the show today.
[02:35:39.598 --> 02:35:41.359]  That's why he obviously couldn't hear me earlier.
[02:35:41.359 --> 02:35:44.740]  I also wanted to talk about a story
[02:35:46.317 --> 02:35:57.361]  Written last Thursday, titled, Former White House Speechwriter Suggests Military Coup Could Oust Obama.
[02:35:57.361 --> 02:36:11.606]  And this is being pushed.
[02:36:11.606 --> 02:36:12.146]  That's why
[02:36:13.413 --> 02:36:30.517]  We need to become aware of what's being said and what's being done, because the establishment itself is talking about a military coup in America, and normally when you have a military coup, to get out of one tyranny, it only creates another tyranny.
[02:36:32.256 --> 02:36:37.858]  And the article is, former White House speechwriter suggests military coup could oust Obama.
[02:36:37.858 --> 02:36:43.219]  Former White House speechwriter John L. Perry has courted controversy by suggesting that the U.S.
[02:36:43.219 --> 02:36:52.442]  military uphold their oath to defend the Constitution against enemies, against domestic enemies, could stage a bloodless coup to oust President Obama.
[02:36:52.442 --> 02:36:57.283]  That continues the illusion that Barack Obama is running anything.
[02:36:57.283 --> 02:37:00.084]  Barack Obama is a corporate lawyer
[02:37:01.758 --> 02:37:07.400]  Who has proven himself to be one of the biggest puppets in modern history in any nation.
[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:09.040]  He reads off a teleprompter.
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:13.362]  So it's always this illusion that it's Obama violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:37:13.362 --> 02:37:16.002]  And if we could just get rid of Obama, everything would be okay.
[02:37:16.002 --> 02:37:16.863]  No!
[02:37:16.863 --> 02:37:22.824]  We've got to audit the Federal Reserve and then abolish it and arrest the bankers.
[02:37:22.824 --> 02:37:23.905]  If you don't get rid of them,
[02:37:25.134 --> 02:37:26.675]  Things only get worse.
[02:37:26.675 --> 02:37:28.835]  Going back to Stuart Rhodes.
[02:37:28.835 --> 02:37:30.176]  Stuart, lost you there.
[02:37:30.176 --> 02:37:48.403]  I was bringing up the article Paul Watson wrote about Newsmax's story with the former White House speechwriter John L. Perry, saying that in an article originally posted at Newsmax, website Perry wrote, there's a remote, although gaining possibility, America's military will intervene in a last resort to resolve the Obama problem.
[02:37:48.403 --> 02:37:49.924]  Don't dismiss it as unrealistic.
[02:37:50.464 --> 02:38:07.130]  Military intervention is what Obama's exponentially accelerating agenda for fundamental change towards a Marxist state is inviting upon America a coup, and it's not an ideal option, but Obama's radical ideal is not acceptable or reversible, writes Perry.
[02:38:08.877 --> 02:38:17.965]  They're trying to spin these type of articles as if this is something Oath Keepers wants, when meanwhile it's former Bush people that are actually talking about this.
[02:38:17.965 --> 02:38:24.431]  And doesn't that reinforce the myth that Obama actually runs anything, when instead Ron Paul
[02:38:25.171 --> 02:38:32.314]  is running a counter-coup with the In The Fed movement to remove the illegitimate corporate dictatorship.
[02:38:32.314 --> 02:38:41.838]  That's who we need to be talking about kicking out, but through legal parameters, once we educate the public that they're a bunch of criminal Kinley-Madoff types.
[02:38:43.208 --> 02:38:47.812]  Right, well the Newsmax article didn't mention a few of them in particular, but here's the problem with that.
[02:38:47.812 --> 02:38:49.313]  What it's proposing is a false solution.
[02:38:49.313 --> 02:38:57.740]  You don't violate the Constitution to say that a military coup would be as wildly unconstitutional as anything any president could do.
[02:38:57.740 --> 02:38:59.401]  And so that's not the way to go.
[02:38:59.401 --> 02:39:07.748]  If the people themselves, if anyone's going to revolt or overthrow a corrupt, cabal government, it's the people, not the military.
[02:39:08.388 --> 02:39:23.113]  And so that's our answer to that, is that the oath is to the Constitution, and nowhere in the Constitution of the military is some general in sunglasses authorized to get upon himself to scrap the civil government and assume military command of the country.
[02:39:23.113 --> 02:39:24.113]  It doesn't exist.
[02:39:24.113 --> 02:39:27.234]  And so we're writing a rebuttal to that piece that'll be on our website.
[02:39:27.234 --> 02:39:28.155]  Absolutely.
[02:39:28.155 --> 02:39:34.257]  In 1775, 1776, for those that don't know, they went and got the elected representatives
[02:39:35.237 --> 02:39:35.457]  Of course!
[02:39:53.086 --> 02:39:54.567]  And I've studied it in depth.
[02:39:54.567 --> 02:40:04.495]  We already have a military coup, as Thomas Barnett writes, but it's a good one, they think, where the global corporations now control our military through the National Security Council.
[02:40:04.495 --> 02:40:08.658]  And so, you don't replace one military coup with another military coup.
[02:40:08.658 --> 02:40:13.682]  You point out how it's illegal and illegitimate, and we remove the coup of the Federal Reserve.
[02:40:14.735 --> 02:40:16.317]  Well, back to what you said about the founding generation.
[02:40:16.317 --> 02:40:17.879]  I mean, look at the Declaration of Independence.
[02:40:17.879 --> 02:40:21.704]  You don't see George Washington's name on there, or any of his officers.
[02:40:21.704 --> 02:40:23.146]  He didn't call the shots.
[02:40:23.146 --> 02:40:24.608]  He was a humble servant.
[02:40:24.608 --> 02:40:27.732]  In fact, he signed off on every correspondence to Congress.
[02:40:27.732 --> 02:40:28.573]  Humble servant.
[02:40:28.573 --> 02:40:29.294]  You're a humble servant.
[02:40:29.835 --> 02:40:34.300]  So, he put himself under the command of the civil leaders of the revolution.
[02:40:34.300 --> 02:40:37.144]  And so that's where we have to follow the same model.
[02:40:37.144 --> 02:40:40.528]  You don't have the military as soon as power is in control.
[02:40:40.528 --> 02:40:48.918]  But you're right, it's also that if you do a military coup, that could be falling right into the hands of people who would love to disrupt the Constitution.
[02:40:49.298 --> 02:40:54.825]  So they offer you this one problem here, and then they offer the solution, and the false solution is a military coup.
[02:40:54.825 --> 02:40:57.248]  And you wind up going from the frying pan to the fire.
[02:40:57.248 --> 02:40:58.971]  You still scrap the Constitution, it's gone.
[02:40:58.971 --> 02:41:02.455]  And so now you're dependent upon whoever happens to be the general in charge.
[02:41:02.455 --> 02:41:04.017]  You know, so that's not how it's done in our republic.
[02:41:07.179 --> 02:41:07.880]  Absolutely.
[02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:13.004]  Again, Stuart Rhodes obviously in a busy office today as we speak with him.
[02:41:13.004 --> 02:41:26.297]  I've thrown out a lot of issues I want to discuss, and I've got some calls that I want to go to, but you're going to write a rebuttal to the article written by the former White House speechwriter John L. Perry for Newsmax.
[02:41:26.297 --> 02:41:30.500]  We'd love to publish that at Infowars.com as soon as we get that, Stuart Rhodes.
[02:41:31.201 --> 02:41:36.026]  But other issues that you're looking at right now, the military.
[02:41:36.026 --> 02:41:37.567]  What is their mood?
[02:41:37.567 --> 02:41:38.989]  What are the police saying?
[02:41:38.989 --> 02:41:46.156]  When you write these articles about the New World Order for SWAT Magazine, what are the paramilitary local police saying?
[02:41:47.287 --> 02:41:49.868]  Well, overwhelmingly, we get a positive response.
[02:41:49.868 --> 02:41:58.051]  Of course, we're getting the people who like our message the most, but I think quite a few people in rank-and-file military and police are waking up.
[02:41:58.051 --> 02:42:05.294]  And I even heard from the grapevine that some generals who are behind what we're doing are aware of those keepers and are in agreement.
[02:42:07.831 --> 02:42:10.992]  It's all about waking them up to what's going on in the big picture.
[02:42:10.992 --> 02:42:16.394]  And once they see it, most of them are meant of honor, and they'll be on our side.
[02:42:16.394 --> 02:42:23.997]  And so that's why you shouldn't think, folks should not think that, oh, they're all going to follow orders, they're all going to do these things.
[02:42:24.757 --> 02:42:25.937]  They're waking up now.
[02:42:25.937 --> 02:42:31.599]  Of course, we get folks who write in after G20 and say, what about that?
[02:42:31.599 --> 02:42:34.579]  If you're all going to keep your open, why did that happen?
[02:42:34.579 --> 02:42:37.080]  Well, it's because we haven't reached those officers yet.
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:37.720]  We just started.
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:39.100]  You've got to give us a little bit of time.
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:41.301]  You've got to help.
[02:42:41.301 --> 02:42:46.522]  Don't just criticize us and say, well, that shows you're failing.
[02:42:46.522 --> 02:42:53.183]  Go out and reach them before they get to the G20, before they get nationalized and sent someplace else across the country.
[02:42:53.834 --> 02:43:14.925]  Well, Stuart, we also know, and this has come out in COINTELPRO documents from the 60s and 70s, it's come out with Hal Turner running around saying, go after the feds, when the FBI admits it worked for them, that there are people always calling for violence and always pushing violence and always saying, we're wimps, we're bad.
[02:43:15.405 --> 02:43:16.846]  Ron Paul isn't doing enough.
[02:43:16.846 --> 02:43:18.466]  Alex Jones isn't doing enough.
[02:43:18.466 --> 02:43:20.087]  Stuart Rose isn't doing enough.
[02:43:20.087 --> 02:43:32.131]  A lot of those people, it's turned out, are operatives paid to be online and to call into radio to just get everyone dissenting instead of saying, in less than a year, look how far Oath Keepers has gone.
[02:43:32.131 --> 02:43:38.654]  In the last few years, look how the Ron Paul revolution's gone towards auditing the Fed, identifying the real shadow government.
[02:43:39.974 --> 02:43:44.858]  Yeah, and also we have people who claim to be on our side who just don't understand the Constitution.
[02:43:44.858 --> 02:43:45.618]  I've had people that
[02:44:04.266 --> 02:44:10.034]  You know, email and say, when are you going to have a military march out of Washington to stop, you know, vaccination of children?
[02:44:10.034 --> 02:44:12.918]  You know, as though we have the authority to go do that.
[02:44:12.918 --> 02:44:19.407]  You know, the mess, here's the thing, is that we are in a mess because the American people were stupid to switch for decades.
[02:44:19.407 --> 02:44:21.470]  And it's not up to the military and police to fix that.
[02:44:22.461 --> 02:44:25.422]  Folks out there are going to have to get off the couch and go out and do it themselves.
[02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:54.896]  If the average person would quit bitching at us for not doing enough, and they would get up off their fat asses, and I'm sorry to talk like that, and get out there and engage the New World Order, our problems would be over very quickly!
[02:44:55.796 --> 02:44:56.076]  That's right.
[02:44:56.076 --> 02:44:57.777]  Well, it's already working though.
[02:44:57.777 --> 02:45:00.319]  You've got people now, nurses refusing the shot.
[02:45:00.319 --> 02:45:03.461]  You've got people who are refusing it because they realize it's dangerous.
[02:45:03.461 --> 02:45:05.062]  And that's because we have the internet.
[02:45:05.062 --> 02:45:05.843]  We have YouTube.
[02:45:05.843 --> 02:45:07.364]  You know, we have your show.
[02:45:07.364 --> 02:45:09.245]  It's already helping, but you're right.
[02:45:09.245 --> 02:45:13.168]  The answer is to get out there and spread the message and help, not to criticize.
[02:45:13.168 --> 02:45:16.850]  You know, you criticize me for not doing enough, you know, or you.
[02:45:16.850 --> 02:45:18.932]  You know, you're right.
[02:45:18.932 --> 02:45:23.555]  But I'm telling you, nine times out of ten, we've tracked their IP addresses and stuff and test.
[02:45:24.717 --> 02:45:26.439]  Most of these people are paid.
[02:45:26.439 --> 02:45:29.982]  They're working for big foundations, or they're working for the government.
[02:45:29.982 --> 02:45:40.912]  The Pentagon admits they're on the web, and they know how to get us fighting, and their best way to operate is to pose as, quote, conspiracy theorists to get us in fighting with each other.
[02:45:40.912 --> 02:45:43.034]  I mean, it's right out of the COINTELPRO playbook.
[02:45:43.612 --> 02:45:56.040]  You know, I saw a thread on Daily Kos, in fact, where one guy was saying that he was advising other readers there to go to conservative sites and pretend they're a conservative and then talk, and then use racist language.
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:57.000]  No, no, no, they do it!
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:57.661]  They've been caught!
[02:46:00.987 --> 02:46:15.740]  Yeah, I mean, you see these ridiculous comments like, like, yeah, blacks are all scum and filth, and then the person still leaves their handle and you go find their MySpace account and it's a black guy.
[02:46:15.740 --> 02:46:17.702]  And, you know, he's a big Obama supporter.
[02:46:17.702 --> 02:46:18.743]  You're absolutely right.
[02:46:18.743 --> 02:46:23.167]  They're doing that.
[02:46:23.167 --> 02:46:24.147]  How do we counter that?
[02:46:24.147 --> 02:46:27.971]  How do we counter that type of deception?
[02:46:29.195 --> 02:46:33.159]  Well, I think, you know, someone's the best antidote, the best antiseptic.
[02:46:33.159 --> 02:46:35.962]  You just expose it, like we're doing right now.
[02:46:35.962 --> 02:46:37.684]  And folks shouldn't buy into it.
[02:46:37.684 --> 02:46:41.989]  They should look with a jaundiced eye at anybody who's calling for violence.
[02:46:41.989 --> 02:46:43.931]  That's how you pick the agent provocateur out.
[02:46:43.931 --> 02:46:45.133]  That's the old joke.
[02:46:45.133 --> 02:46:47.155]  It's the guy who's trying to get you to do something illegal.
[02:46:49.090 --> 02:46:53.233]  Well they've caught agent provocateurs in Denver last year and Canada.
[02:46:53.233 --> 02:47:00.917]  Mainstream news admits the police go and attack their own police for the news cameras and then no one goes to jail.
[02:47:00.917 --> 02:47:07.822]  Shouldn't the commanders that gave those orders get in big trouble for ordering police to engage in false flag operations?
[02:47:09.019 --> 02:47:09.519]  Well, I think so.
[02:47:09.519 --> 02:47:13.463]  I think it's entrapment at the very least, you know.
[02:47:13.463 --> 02:47:16.606]  But, as we know, it's been watered down.
[02:47:16.606 --> 02:47:25.194]  The rules have been, the lines have been blurred and watered down for so long, we're going to have to try to counteract that bit by bit and officer by officer.
[02:47:25.194 --> 02:47:33.001]  In fact, what the police commanders say when they get caught doing this from Canada to Australia to the United States, England, you name it, Italy,
[02:47:34.248 --> 02:47:54.440]  They got caught in Greece this year, I'm sure you probably saw those newscasts, where mainstream news admitted the police were dressed up as anarchists, being ordered by police in alleyways, it was caught on video, in uniform, to go bash out windows of cars and businesses to demonize the mainline protesters, and the police said, oh, that was just a drill!
[02:47:55.160 --> 02:48:03.182]  And so now when they go attack other cops on camera, or the news cameras, so they can attack the peaceful crowd, they go, oh that was just a drill.
[02:48:03.182 --> 02:48:04.543]  That was just an exercise.
[02:48:04.543 --> 02:48:06.783]  Right.
[02:48:06.783 --> 02:48:14.746]  Well, I think the best thing you can do is that when you have that happen in a local police department, it's time for a new chief of police.
[02:48:14.746 --> 02:48:18.207]  And if the mayor won't do that, then it's time to get rid of the mayor of the town.
[02:48:18.207 --> 02:48:19.527]  You know, kind of let him out of office.
[02:48:20.154 --> 02:48:20.994]  Obama was this great savior.
[02:48:20.994 --> 02:48:21.194]  He was
[02:48:44.051 --> 02:48:44.892]  Invincible.
[02:48:44.892 --> 02:48:47.073]  He was going to save the Earth.
[02:48:47.073 --> 02:48:51.436]  And it doesn't matter if they make him head of the United Nations Security Council.
[02:48:51.436 --> 02:48:57.080]  It doesn't matter if they give him all these awards to be the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:02.784]  It seems the whole world is starting to really get wise that Obama's a fraud.
[02:49:02.784 --> 02:49:04.846]  Well, it's like with the G20.
[02:49:04.846 --> 02:49:08.528]  That's where you saw the puppet masters coming together.
[02:49:08.528 --> 02:49:12.491]  And frankly, everyone that protested at 9-12 in D.C.
[02:49:12.491 --> 02:49:13.152]  should have been in G20.
[02:49:14.062 --> 02:49:18.387]  Because that's who's really pulling the strings, you know, but instead they went to the puppets.
[02:49:18.387 --> 02:49:22.931]  So it's going to take, you know, a little bit of time to wake people up, and of course we're running out of time.
[02:49:22.931 --> 02:49:30.399]  But the more they understand that it doesn't make a difference who's in office, but what counts is what agenda they're pushing, and if they're pushing the same agenda, it doesn't make a difference.
[02:49:30.399 --> 02:49:33.623]  But you notice at the... You notice at the DC...
[02:49:34.992 --> 02:49:35.072]  Yes.
[02:49:35.072 --> 02:49:35.232]  Yes.
[02:50:00.812 --> 02:50:04.735]  Well, they said they were part of that multi-jurisdictional security force.
[02:50:04.735 --> 02:50:07.737]  I believe those were police officers.
[02:50:07.737 --> 02:50:12.840]  Yeah, G20 said they were part of their private security force, but so they're secret police.
[02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:14.782]  I mean, what do you think that was about?
[02:50:14.782 --> 02:50:20.165]  Well, I mean, what was it about to just grab a guy off the street like that?
[02:50:20.165 --> 02:50:21.826]  Intimidation is one point.
[02:50:21.826 --> 02:50:27.090]  If you black bag someone off the street, it makes everybody else on the street go, wow, I shouldn't be out here, you know?
[02:50:27.879 --> 02:50:29.380]  So, but again, I was in D.C.
[02:50:29.380 --> 02:50:33.963]  for the 9-12 protest, and the contrast between that and G20 is striking.
[02:50:33.963 --> 02:50:41.027]  And then, of course, one problem is you have rock-throwing, you know, so-called anarchists at the G20, and that causes trouble for the other protesters.
[02:50:41.027 --> 02:50:47.350]  But the answer, of course, for the police is to arrest the rock-throwers, not to pepper-spray and sound-canon everybody.
[02:50:47.350 --> 02:50:47.891]  Exactly.
[02:50:47.891 --> 02:50:53.274]  You got ten foundation-funded brats out there throwing rocks.
[02:50:53.274 --> 02:50:56.856]  You go arrest them, not the 2,000 peaceful people.
[02:50:58.916 --> 02:50:59.777]  But the cops know that.
[02:50:59.777 --> 02:51:01.559]  Those guys work for him.
[02:51:01.559 --> 02:51:06.043]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[02:51:06.043 --> 02:51:10.327]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[02:51:10.327 --> 02:51:21.158]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[02:51:21.158 --> 02:51:22.619]  These key ingredients not only support
[02:51:26.305 --> 02:51:27.065]  We're good to go.
[02:51:55.061 --> 02:52:02.728]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.129 --> 02:52:21.716]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.716 --> 02:52:23.678]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.678 --> 02:52:26.200]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:37.172]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.754 --> 02:52:39.415]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.415 --> 02:52:41.275]  It's about a one world government.
[02:52:41.275 --> 02:52:48.198]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:52:48.198 --> 02:52:56.461]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:56.461 --> 02:52:58.021]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.021 --> 02:52:59.222]  The people strike back.
[02:53:01.192 --> 02:53:04.775]  America is in deep, deep trouble because we don't know our rights.
[02:53:04.775 --> 02:53:11.239]  Let's get real freedom back into America by teaching and promoting the Bill of Rights with the 2010 Freedom Calendar.
[02:53:11.239 --> 02:53:11.719]  Why?
[02:53:11.719 --> 02:53:13.741]  Because our forefathers gave them to us.
[02:53:13.741 --> 02:53:16.783]  Because the Freedom Calendar is true patriotism in action.
[02:53:17.043 --> 02:53:21.467]  And because if you don't know your rights and use them, you may lose them.
[02:53:21.467 --> 02:53:25.130]  The Freedom Calendar is the best educational tool in over 200 years.
[02:53:25.130 --> 02:53:30.875]  It shows in detail how to use your rights, how to answer any bureaucrat, how to use your guaranteed rights for true freedom.
[02:53:30.875 --> 02:53:36.700]  The Freedom Calendar is the easy way to learn the proper use and function of each of our rights, and is perfect for homeschoolers.
[02:53:36.800 --> 02:53:37.180]  I don't know.
[02:54:04.853 --> 02:54:09.077]  You look like an angel.
[02:54:09.077 --> 02:54:13.020]  Walk like an angel.
[02:54:13.020 --> 02:54:15.582]  Talk like an angel.
[02:54:15.582 --> 02:54:19.346]  But I got wise.
[02:54:19.346 --> 02:54:22.288]  You're the devil in disguise.
[02:54:22.288 --> 02:54:25.731]  Oh yes you are, devil in disguise.
[02:54:25.731 --> 02:54:28.053]  I've got time next hour, I'm gonna play it.
[02:54:28.053 --> 02:54:32.317]  Ron Paul slams Neocon Graham for angry white guy attack.
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:47.128]  Neocon Lindsey Graham resorted to race pimping the other night when he attacked Congressman Ron Paul for representing angry white men, to which Paul responded on CNN by pointing out that Graham represents the exact opposite of true conservatism.
[02:54:47.128 --> 02:54:51.430]  He's pro-carbon tax, pro-Sonia Sotomayor.
[02:54:51.430 --> 02:54:58.034]  I mean, the Republican leadership are sickening criminals.
[02:54:58.034 --> 02:55:02.677]  They're violating the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and they're getting more and more desperate
[02:55:03.655 --> 02:55:04.776]  Stuart Rhodes is our guest.
[02:55:04.776 --> 02:55:10.802]  I do want to take some of your phone calls in this segment and the next, and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is going to be joining us.
[02:55:10.802 --> 02:55:15.006]  We're going to go to Ronnie Scott and Karen here in just a moment.
[02:55:15.006 --> 02:55:22.253]  But you do have your event coming up in Las Vegas, the first big annual event out there.
[02:55:22.253 --> 02:55:22.954]  Tell us about that.
[02:55:23.954 --> 02:55:40.361]  It's the first Oath Keepers National Convention, and we'll be having Sheriff Max speak, and we'll be having Lieutenant Commander Guy Cunningham hopefully speaking as well, and we're having a class on command structure by Acting Duty Navy Lieutenant Commander David Gilley.
[02:55:40.361 --> 02:55:45.744]  But the main point is to get together Oath Keeper leadership and those who are interested in helping with Oath Keepers and spreading the message.
[02:55:46.324 --> 02:55:55.293]  It's pretty short notice, but if folks want to come, if you don't want to have a meal, all you want to do is attend the speaker's events, it's only 50 bucks for the whole weekend.
[02:55:55.293 --> 02:56:01.079]  So it's this next weekend, October 24th and 25th in Las Vegas at the Texas Station Hotel.
[02:56:01.079 --> 02:56:05.643]  Oathkeepers.org to find out more.
[02:56:05.643 --> 02:56:08.546]  And you don't have to be former military to be part of it, right?
[02:56:09.261 --> 02:56:12.582]  No, you can go before military or police to help us spread the message.
[02:56:12.582 --> 02:56:16.282]  You can be an associate member of the Vote Keepers, or you don't even have to join.
[02:56:16.282 --> 02:56:21.023]  Just come and learn about what we're doing and help us spread the message.
[02:56:21.023 --> 02:56:21.303]  You bet.
[02:56:21.303 --> 02:56:23.024]  You don't have to spend a dime if you don't want to.
[02:56:23.024 --> 02:56:24.684]  Very, very exciting.
[02:56:24.684 --> 02:56:26.424]  Let's talk to Ronnie in Texas.
[02:56:26.424 --> 02:56:27.425]  Ronnie, you're on the air.
[02:56:27.425 --> 02:56:27.885]  Go ahead.
[02:56:27.885 --> 02:56:30.505]  Thank you, sir.
[02:56:30.505 --> 02:56:34.766]  I'm honored to follow or concurrently we're with Mr. Rhodes of Vote Keepers.
[02:56:35.602 --> 02:56:49.395]  And because I'm here now because I'm able to be here now because I'm in effect banned from today's Office of City Council, which is totally counter to our First Amendment and these flip-flopping power-driven traitors at City Hall.
[02:56:49.395 --> 02:56:54.060]  Sir, do you have a question or comment for Mr. Rhodes?
[02:56:54.060 --> 02:57:00.086]  It's about Afghanistan and the blood of our troops overseas and our cops here at home.
[02:57:01.127 --> 02:57:15.536]  The Afghanis have grown supposedly most of the world's opium, so our brave troops are now guarding those poppies, so as to show our nation's collective preference for one group of illegal drug thugs over some other group of illegal drug thugs.
[02:57:15.536 --> 02:57:22.480]  And that's kind of my comment, but the comment is that, of course, that's the blood of our soldiers watering those crops.
[02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:28.424]  But instead, my suggestion is, overnight, Obama could really earn this Nobel Peace Prize by unilaterally
[02:57:29.734 --> 02:57:37.379]  First, he'd have to defy a couple problematic treaties about drugs, but by declaring absolute freedom for farmers right here at home.
[02:57:37.379 --> 02:57:37.760]  Think of it.
[02:57:37.760 --> 02:57:42.183]  Suddenly, all illegal drug thugs worldwide will totally lose power and influence.
[02:57:42.183 --> 02:57:43.664]  Ronnie, I hear you.
[02:57:43.664 --> 02:57:48.628]  Listen, I'm going to let you go, because I wanted to go to the calls and the people that were for Stuart Rhodes, okay?
[02:57:48.628 --> 02:57:50.529]  Not about legalizing hemp.
[02:57:50.529 --> 02:57:54.052]  We talk about that all the time, and I appreciate your call.
[02:57:56.038 --> 02:57:56.938]  God help us.
[02:57:56.938 --> 02:57:58.479]  Let's talk to Scott in Arizona.
[02:57:58.479 --> 02:58:00.279]  Scott, you're on the air.
[02:58:00.279 --> 02:58:01.859]  Alex Stewart, thanks a lot.
[02:58:01.859 --> 02:58:04.500]  Good day to you.
[02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:07.900]  By the way, one quick insertion along with my question for Stewart.
[02:58:07.900 --> 02:58:12.921]  You had a guy call earlier who was asking about prevention for problems, or if you've already had the flu shot.
[02:58:12.921 --> 02:58:16.302]  Dr. Blalock put out an article on what to do if you've received the shot.
[02:58:16.302 --> 02:58:18.263]  So that guy can go look that up online.
[02:58:18.263 --> 02:58:21.023]  I think it's even on Mercola.
[02:58:21.023 --> 02:58:24.964]  Also, I have spoken to the chief of police here in our town and
[02:58:25.942 --> 02:58:34.704]  He stated that yes, he'd be open for receiving information, such as a lot of the stuff that's been put on your site, Alex, regarding the flu.
[02:58:34.704 --> 02:58:39.486]  He has basically stated that... Alright, I got a break.
[02:58:39.486 --> 02:58:42.786]  I got a break.
[02:58:42.786 --> 02:58:46.307]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.307 --> 02:58:47.448]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.987 --> 02:58:54.368]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.368 --> 02:58:57.989]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:57.989 --> 02:59:02.551]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.551 --> 02:59:08.153]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:59:08.453 --> 02:59:13.217]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.217 --> 02:59:16.840]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.840 --> 02:59:21.664]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.664 --> 02:59:28.230]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.230 --> 02:59:30.172]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:59:30.652 --> 02:59:33.854]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:59:33.854 --> 02:59:38.356]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:59:38.356 --> 02:59:40.077]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:59:40.077 --> 02:59:40.517]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.517 --> 02:59:40.577]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.577 --> 02:59:41.137]  Don't wait.
[02:59:41.137 --> 02:59:41.758]  Call today.
[02:59:41.758 --> 02:59:42.858]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.858 --> 02:59:44.059]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:06.235 --> 03:00:15.403]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is coming up, former editor of Wall Street Journal, former head of policy, Department of Treasury, to talk about the death of the dollar.
[03:00:15.403 --> 03:00:17.505]  What is really happening right now?
[03:00:17.505 --> 03:00:24.771]  Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, is our guest, and I'm attempting to take people's phone calls here for him.
[03:00:24.771 --> 03:00:28.414]  Scott in Arizona, do you have a question for our guest?
[03:00:28.414 --> 03:00:29.175]  Yeah, I do.
[03:00:29.175 --> 03:00:33.639]  I would like for him to address possibly how to maybe take it a step further when it comes to
[03:00:34.352 --> 03:00:55.474]  The Chief of Police, maybe even, and also for whatever it's worth, I know the Chief of Police here talks a lot with the head of the Fire Department, too, and how he might suggest some in-routes to bring more awareness regarding violations of the Constitution, the flu issue, and one last thing to add to that, Alex, I think this would be an excellent, excellent way
[03:00:55.954 --> 03:01:02.737]  For people to get the word out, whether it be copy your DVDs to give them out, or even do like the Sherry Tenpenny flyers.
[03:01:02.737 --> 03:01:08.720]  I've handed them out at our school, but the other thing is, besides handing it out at your schools, Halloween!
[03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:14.343]  Put a copy in every kid's basket and send it home and let the parents pick it out and read it and find it.
[03:01:14.343 --> 03:01:21.947]  It's a national holiday, we can expose this massively if people will go make the copies and put it in every single pumpkin that they get at their front door.
[03:01:22.734 --> 03:01:28.405]  So, but extrapolate if you would please a little further on the Chief of Police and you know talking to the Chief of Police about this.
[03:01:28.405 --> 03:01:31.010]  I didn't know they were handing pumpkins out of people's doors.
[03:01:31.010 --> 03:01:33.394]  Got kids dragging giant bags of pumpkins.
[03:01:33.394 --> 03:01:34.556]  No, I mean you can give them the...
[03:01:35.691 --> 03:01:42.576]  You know, the sugar candies or whatever, and then with it have the candy folded up in a note, a letter to him.
[03:01:42.576 --> 03:01:43.897]  Thanks for the call.
[03:01:43.897 --> 03:01:44.538]  Absolutely.
[03:01:44.538 --> 03:01:51.323]  I mean, if we do what Scott's talking about, all of us should start interfacing with our fellow humans instead of just watching TV all day.
[03:01:51.323 --> 03:01:53.685]  This tyranny will start dissipating.
[03:01:54.508 --> 03:01:54.968]  Absolutely.
[03:01:54.968 --> 03:02:06.253]  On our website you can go and find free PDF downloads of our brochures and push cards and just print them up on your home computer and hand them out.
[03:02:06.253 --> 03:02:11.916]  And our DVD, we're going to start selling on our website too, but you can also get it through $1 DVD project.
[03:02:12.837 --> 03:02:13.577]  We're good to go.
[03:02:37.077 --> 03:02:37.558]  We're good to go.
[03:02:52.820 --> 03:02:54.323]  And call it a tea party!
[03:02:54.323 --> 03:03:01.052]  Call it whatever name you want, so it's what it is, patriotic and mainline.
[03:03:01.052 --> 03:03:08.103]  Call it Veterans Appreciation Day or whatever, but invite the police and the firefighters to come together with the veterans.
[03:03:08.103 --> 03:03:08.884]  Call it what you want.
[03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:12.161]  Yeah, we're the real patriots.
[03:03:12.161 --> 03:03:23.331]  Stop letting the offshore bankers and their little crooked groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center and others run around and say they're the patriots and that because we're pro-America, we're the bad people.
[03:03:23.331 --> 03:03:24.592]  No, we're the real Americans.
[03:03:24.592 --> 03:03:34.380]  And I go back to Ron Paul earlier this year at CPAC, the big Republican convention, and Rush Limbaugh is the keynote speaker.
[03:03:34.380 --> 03:03:35.882]  Ron Paul is one of the other key speakers.
[03:03:37.020 --> 03:03:41.385]  And Ron Paul gets up and says, Republicans are anti-war, this war is a fraud.
[03:03:41.385 --> 03:03:43.108]  He got a standing ovation.
[03:03:43.108 --> 03:03:46.492]  Republicans, by and large, aren't a bunch of warmongers either.
[03:03:46.492 --> 03:03:51.438]  I mean, that's the issue is, we have to take America back.
[03:03:52.515 --> 03:03:52.735]  Right.
[03:03:52.735 --> 03:03:54.956]  Stop waiting for someone else to do it.
[03:03:54.956 --> 03:03:57.097]  In your own local community, get up and do it.
[03:03:57.097 --> 03:04:00.439]  Go do a big party in a local park.
[03:04:00.439 --> 03:04:02.580]  Start some kind of event like that.
[03:04:02.580 --> 03:04:10.483]  But the best way to do it, I think, is to first get them together and get them to understand that you're not their enemy.
[03:04:10.483 --> 03:04:12.724]  And then after that, start talking to them.
[03:04:12.724 --> 03:04:15.906]  Just come out of the blue, to an average cop, up in the world order.
[03:04:15.906 --> 03:04:17.306]  That's the best way to do it.
[03:04:17.306 --> 03:04:20.428]  A little bit of soft sell up front usually works better.
[03:04:21.368 --> 03:04:29.656]  Well, I found it's also good, you know, just the carpet-bombing effect of just handing them DVDs, you know, just giving them to everybody.
[03:04:29.656 --> 03:04:35.221]  The Obama deception, endgame, terror storm, that can break their conditioning as well.
[03:04:35.221 --> 03:04:38.204]  Stuart Rhodes, keep it up, my friend.
[03:04:38.204 --> 03:04:45.391]  The establishment looks like fools trying to demonize you because your organization is absolutely just
[03:04:46.408 --> 03:04:47.449]  Alex, one last thing.
[03:04:47.449 --> 03:04:49.171]  We're doing a big drive for the troops.
[03:04:49.171 --> 03:04:50.994]  We'll have you back on then.
[03:05:01.727 --> 03:05:04.749]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.749 --> 03:05:10.072]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.072 --> 03:05:12.114]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.114 --> 03:05:17.117]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.117 --> 03:05:18.317]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.317 --> 03:05:19.438]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.438 --> 03:05:21.319]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.319 --> 03:05:22.400]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.400 --> 03:05:24.601]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.601 --> 03:05:25.942]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.942 --> 03:05:27.243]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.443 --> 03:05:32.710]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.710 --> 03:05:36.315]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.315 --> 03:05:40.140]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.140 --> 03:05:41.362]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.362 --> 03:05:42.263]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.263 --> 03:05:43.364]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.364 --> 03:05:44.306]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.306 --> 03:05:45.107]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.367 --> 03:05:48.428]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.428 --> 03:05:51.269]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:51.269 --> 03:05:52.030]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.888 --> 03:06:06.215]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:06.215 --> 03:06:08.278]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[03:06:08.278 --> 03:06:10.741]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.741 --> 03:06:13.004]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:13.004 --> 03:06:14.646]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.646 --> 03:06:15.668]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.888 --> 03:06:24.310]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:06:37.814 --> 03:06:43.840]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[03:07:03.652 --> 03:07:06.737]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[03:07:06.737 --> 03:07:09.401]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[03:07:09.401 --> 03:07:13.146]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal foods.
[03:07:13.146 --> 03:07:19.476]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[03:07:19.816 --> 03:07:23.699]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[03:07:23.699 --> 03:07:28.083]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[03:07:28.083 --> 03:07:30.325]  Nutraversal Foods from eFoods Direct.
[03:07:30.325 --> 03:07:31.686]  Your new comfort food.
[03:07:31.686 --> 03:07:34.788]  Incredible taste, easy to prepare, and a long shelf life.
[03:07:34.788 --> 03:07:36.029]  Nutraversal Foods.
[03:07:36.029 --> 03:07:42.734]  More fun while hunting and fishing, bigger tails around the campfire, and the food your kids will want when celebrating the win of a ballgame.
[03:07:42.734 --> 03:07:47.218]  And if it's this great during the good times, imagine how reassuring it will be if times get tough.
[03:07:47.625 --> 03:07:51.066]  New Traversal Foods by eFoodsDirect, your new comfort food.
[03:07:51.066 --> 03:07:52.387]  eFoodsDirect.com 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:52.387 --> 03:07:53.667]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com or call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:53.667 --> 03:07:58.209]  They've run the system, the whole economic system of the world for the last two and a half hundred years.
[03:08:11.798 --> 03:08:16.423]  So why shouldn't they also run the economic system for the next few hundred years?
[03:08:16.423 --> 03:08:19.866]  So is this some sort of a new world order, which Gordon Brown kind of alluded to?
[03:08:19.866 --> 03:08:22.048]  I think a new world order is emerging.
[03:08:22.048 --> 03:08:28.955]  We have to stand up to preserve a republic here and a rule of law, which is under dire threat.
[03:08:29.315 --> 03:08:33.799]  For a couple of hours, you could say Mr. Obama was president of the world.
[03:08:33.799 --> 03:08:45.569]  Obama has made it quite clear by his actions, never mind his words, his actions, as to who owns him, who he works for, and who he serves, and it's not the American people.
[03:08:45.569 --> 03:08:53.716]  Just as George W. Bush betrayed his foolish followers, so must Obama, because his only allegiance is to his offshore masters.
[03:08:54.238 --> 03:08:56.640]  Summers tells Obama what to do.
[03:08:56.640 --> 03:08:58.942]  Summers tells Geithner what to do.
[03:08:58.942 --> 03:09:01.944]  So we had Snow, we had Paulson, now we have Geithner.
[03:09:01.944 --> 03:09:04.286]  All these people cut from the same ball of cloth.
[03:09:04.286 --> 03:09:10.772]  All you folks don't even realize that you're helping people that you're associated with and you should be recusing yourself.
[03:09:10.772 --> 03:09:11.192]  Uh, I...
[03:09:12.333 --> 03:09:18.337]  You know, I behaved with the, uh... You don't think you should have recused yourself?
[03:09:18.337 --> 03:09:30.605]  Every time in history when a group of banks, in conjunction with the government, was given the power to expand the money supply at will, those economic systems always collapsed.
[03:09:30.605 --> 03:09:32.306]  If they make a mistake, they get bailed out.
[03:09:32.306 --> 03:09:35.028]  If everyone else makes a mistake, they get put in jail, called a terrorist.
[03:09:35.028 --> 03:09:37.670]  The tune of $23,700,000,000,000 worth of taxpayer exposure for the bailouts is quite striking.
[03:09:42.153 --> 03:09:51.136]  This is, by probably an order of magnitude, the biggest fraud in history.
[03:09:51.136 --> 03:09:53.917]  Why would you need international bankers?
[03:09:53.917 --> 03:09:56.498]  Why would any government agree to use them?
[03:09:56.498 --> 03:10:04.821]  It's nothing more than a private, hostile, corporate takeover of every sovereign nation on Earth.
[03:10:04.821 --> 03:10:09.522]  So for the first time in history, we really have this new form of an empire.
[03:10:09.522 --> 03:10:10.823]  Fall of the Republic.
[03:10:13.134 --> 03:10:17.336]  Volume 1, The Presidency of Barack Obama.
[03:10:17.336 --> 03:10:24.220]  Available on DVD at InfoWars.com and online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:10:24.220 --> 03:10:28.262]  The destiny of humanity is in our hands.
[03:10:28.262 --> 03:10:28.742]  October 21st, 2009.
[03:10:36.795 --> 03:10:38.256]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:10:38.256 --> 03:10:40.498]  That is the fourth trailer in the series.
[03:10:40.498 --> 03:10:42.059]  We'll have one more on Monday.
[03:10:42.059 --> 03:10:43.980]  Wednesday is the release of Fall of the Republic.
[03:10:43.980 --> 03:10:45.541]  You can pre-order it now.
[03:10:45.541 --> 03:10:51.465]  The orders will ship out in the order they receive my newest and best film, Fall of the Republic.
[03:10:51.465 --> 03:11:01.573]  We are joined until 45 after by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy, Department of Treasury under Ronald Reagan, best-selling author, former Wall Street Journal editor.
[03:11:02.413 --> 03:11:07.996]  And also a great patriot fighting just the corporate looting that's going on.
[03:11:07.996 --> 03:11:10.358]  He's very critical of George W. Bush.
[03:11:10.358 --> 03:11:11.939]  He hoped Obama would be better.
[03:11:11.939 --> 03:11:17.222]  Obviously, he's now pointed out that Obama has already, in many cases, surpassed the tyranny of George Bush.
[03:11:17.222 --> 03:11:25.687]  Now the outrage of Obama being given the Peace Prize when he's actually sent tens of thousands more troops to Afghanistan, continuing the torture, the secret arrest.
[03:11:25.687 --> 03:11:26.488]  We'll talk about that.
[03:11:27.288 --> 03:11:27.488]  Hey Alex!
[03:11:50.652 --> 03:11:51.652]  So much is happening.
[03:11:51.652 --> 03:11:59.476]  Let's get into Obama and where he's going and the Peace Prize and your take on that.
[03:11:59.476 --> 03:12:04.898]  Well, they gave the Peace Prize to a warmonger, didn't they?
[03:12:04.898 --> 03:12:13.362]  This is the guy who started a new war in Pakistan and who has increased
[03:12:14.656 --> 03:12:16.777]  The war in Afghanistan.
[03:12:16.777 --> 03:12:29.924]  In fact, today there's a report on Antiwar.com that he's told the British he was going to send in 45,000 more Americans.
[03:12:29.924 --> 03:12:37.148]  And this was part of his guarantee to them to get them to send a few hundred more troops.
[03:12:39.730 --> 03:12:52.538]  You know, I wrote a column about it and said that it took longer than George Orwell thought to reach his version of 1984, but we've now reached it.
[03:12:52.538 --> 03:12:56.321]  We've given the Peace Prize to the warmonger.
[03:12:56.321 --> 03:13:08.028]  Now, the Nobel Committee claims that, well, they made this decision two weeks after his election because of his rhetoric.
[03:13:08.028 --> 03:13:09.149]  He was talking different.
[03:13:10.339 --> 03:13:13.520]  from Bush.
[03:13:13.520 --> 03:13:23.123]  So they were hopeful that they could somehow give him the Peace Prize and make it harder for him to be a war monger.
[03:13:23.123 --> 03:13:33.066]  That could work, but I think most likely all it's done is to make the slogan that Orwell has in 1984, War is Peace,
[03:13:37.882 --> 03:13:42.144]  The reality for us, so now war is peace.
[03:13:42.144 --> 03:14:00.071]  But it has seemed to have blown up in the Nobel Committee's face and making him the head on the rotating board of the UN Security Council trying to push him as this global peacemaker when clearly he's continuing the exact agenda that we had under George W. Bush
[03:14:01.151 --> 03:14:09.034]  I mean, I think this is one of the straws that broke the camel's back, and I've seen that the Nobel Committee, as you mentioned, is now starting to backtrack and apologize.
[03:14:09.034 --> 03:14:17.037]  And I did hear on local radio news, well, actually, a national news feed, Fox News was reporting that, yes, he's confirmed that he's going to send 40,000 to 48,000.
[03:14:17.037 --> 03:14:18.258]  You're saying anti-war has 45,000.
[03:14:18.258 --> 03:14:19.198]  Whatever it is, over 40,000.
[03:14:19.198 --> 03:14:20.019]  He sent more than 25,000 earlier.
[03:14:20.019 --> 03:14:20.899]  He secretly sent 13,000 more.
[03:14:20.899 --> 03:14:21.339]  That was confirmed.
[03:14:29.062 --> 03:14:55.867]  And so he took 50,000 out of Iraq, but then put 50,000 more contractors in, and so I guess this gives new meaning to the word, you know, words over actions, because we've got Code Pink now endorsing the war, Huffington Post just endorsed more war, and so now it's the liberal thing to do to go into the place that no army's ever defeated.
[03:14:58.782 --> 03:15:00.643]  Right.
[03:15:00.643 --> 03:15:07.927]  And of course, you know, the worst part about it is all the people there who will be killed.
[03:15:07.927 --> 03:15:12.529]  We seldom kill any of the fighters.
[03:15:12.529 --> 03:15:15.570]  Not that we have any right to kill them, because we've invaded them.
[03:15:15.570 --> 03:15:17.211]  They haven't done anything to us.
[03:15:17.211 --> 03:15:24.394]  But we mainly kill women and children and village elders.
[03:15:24.394 --> 03:15:25.215]  It's just sort of a
[03:15:26.517 --> 03:15:27.038]  I think so.
[03:15:47.935 --> 03:15:49.117]  What is the agenda?
[03:15:49.117 --> 03:15:50.038]  What is the agenda?
[03:15:50.038 --> 03:15:52.821]  Why are they expanding into Pakistan?
[03:15:52.821 --> 03:15:55.524]  Is it to encircle Iran and China?
[03:15:55.524 --> 03:15:57.207]  Is it to control the opium?
[03:15:57.207 --> 03:15:58.929]  Is it for weapon sales?
[03:15:58.929 --> 03:16:01.191]  The UNICOL pipelines?
[03:16:01.191 --> 03:16:05.156]  They even admit, I saw CNN with a general admit there was a staged election.
[03:16:05.737 --> 03:16:08.838]  I mean, I have to pinch myself every day.
[03:16:08.838 --> 03:16:10.138]  What is the point?
[03:16:10.138 --> 03:16:13.338]  More troops in Afghanistan means more targets.
[03:16:13.338 --> 03:16:17.159]  Those warlords are always fighting with each other over the opium money.
[03:16:17.159 --> 03:16:18.719]  It's never going to end.
[03:16:18.719 --> 03:16:23.320]  That place has been in war for 2,300 years.
[03:16:23.320 --> 03:16:25.861]  Why are we there?
[03:16:25.861 --> 03:16:30.721]  Well, I can't say I know for sure.
[03:16:30.721 --> 03:16:33.502]  We're there because of 9-11.
[03:16:35.103 --> 03:16:40.048]  Which you and I regard as an inside job.
[03:16:40.048 --> 03:16:46.475]  And that was an excuse to start a war over there, but they really weren't mainly interested in Afghanistan.
[03:16:46.475 --> 03:16:48.977]  They wanted to invade Iraq.
[03:16:48.977 --> 03:16:58.327]  And so it was kind of a beginning of a war that they could spread where they really wanted it.
[03:16:58.863 --> 03:17:06.425]  Now, of course, while we're staying there, probably the Israelis want us involved.
[03:17:06.425 --> 03:17:17.988]  If we pull out of Afghanistan, then we might not attack Iran, or we may pull out of Iraq.
[03:17:17.988 --> 03:17:26.149]  The whole thing that they stirred up with the neoconservatives, you know, would simply pass away and be for naught.
[03:17:26.149 --> 03:17:28.310]  So I think the Israelis want to keep us there.
[03:17:29.190 --> 03:17:34.853]  And, of course, the military itself does, because wartime is when you get the most rapid promotions.
[03:17:34.853 --> 03:17:37.134]  Officers get promoted rapidly.
[03:17:37.134 --> 03:17:42.057]  When they retire, they get much larger pensions.
[03:17:42.057 --> 03:17:50.501]  The higher up they can get promoted, the better their chances to be consultants to the defense industries, to the Pentagon itself.
[03:17:50.501 --> 03:17:56.925]  And so it serves the interest of the officer corps, and, of course, the munitions.
[03:17:57.791 --> 03:17:59.532]  They're armaments industries.
[03:17:59.532 --> 03:18:07.657]  They give tremendous political contributions and, of course, they're getting richer and richer from these ongoing wars.
[03:18:07.657 --> 03:18:16.122]  And now we have Matt Crystal over there saying that he needs 10 more years.
[03:18:16.122 --> 03:18:20.325]  So that turns it into, what, an 18, 19-year-old war.
[03:18:20.325 --> 03:18:25.668]  I mean, a lot of people can get rich, can get promoted, can retire and hire.
[03:18:26.876 --> 03:18:30.239]  Higher pensions.
[03:18:30.239 --> 03:18:35.444]  And also you see the government, there's a lot of momentum now.
[03:18:35.444 --> 03:18:37.406]  How do you back out?
[03:18:37.406 --> 03:18:39.768]  How do you stop?
[03:18:39.768 --> 03:18:41.650]  They can't claim a victory.
[03:18:41.650 --> 03:18:45.253]  There's nothing they can claim.
[03:18:45.253 --> 03:18:46.935]  They don't want a defeat.
[03:18:46.935 --> 03:18:51.199]  If Obama pulls out, we know exactly what the right-wing crazies will do.
[03:18:51.989 --> 03:18:55.010]  And the neocons, they'll say, see, he's a Muslim.
[03:18:55.010 --> 03:18:59.711]  He sold out the country to the Muslims.
[03:18:59.711 --> 03:19:02.392]  He's turned Afghanistan back to al-Qaeda.
[03:19:02.392 --> 03:19:07.273]  So all those just basic political things play in.
[03:19:07.273 --> 03:19:18.555]  But once you make a serious error like going in there, you get so many interest groups and politics that it makes it hard
[03:19:21.109 --> 03:19:21.789]  To get out.
[03:19:21.789 --> 03:19:29.374]  So I think probably we'll just expire there.
[03:19:29.374 --> 03:19:34.677]  It's just going to be continual occupation of Central Asia for the foreseeable future.
[03:19:34.677 --> 03:19:34.997]  You're right.
[03:19:34.997 --> 03:19:37.258]  They're talking about a decade more.
[03:19:37.258 --> 03:19:38.319]  That's 18 years.
[03:19:38.319 --> 03:19:39.119]  It's like Germany.
[03:19:39.119 --> 03:19:41.221]  We've been there since 45.
[03:19:41.221 --> 03:19:42.461]  Never leaving.
[03:19:42.461 --> 03:19:44.482]  Been in Korea for 50 years.
[03:19:44.482 --> 03:19:46.043]  Never leaving.
[03:19:46.043 --> 03:19:47.584]  More than 50 years.
[03:19:47.584 --> 03:19:48.505]  And we pay for it.
[03:19:49.105 --> 03:19:56.989]  And meanwhile, the weapons manufacturers make a bunch of money, our troops get killed, but generals get to pin more ribbons on their chest.
[03:19:56.989 --> 03:20:00.651]  We'll talk about the dollar, and the death of the empire, the fall of the republic.
[03:20:01.727 --> 03:20:05.251]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[03:20:05.251 --> 03:20:07.254]  Now, going green can save money.
[03:20:07.254 --> 03:20:12.820]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.

[03:21:02.108 --> 03:21:08.154]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:08.154 --> 03:21:14.040]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.040 --> 03:21:20.187]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.507 --> 03:21:22.489]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.489 --> 03:21:24.951]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:24.951 --> 03:21:38.141]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:21:38.141 --> 03:21:39.822]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.822 --> 03:21:41.684]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:41.684 --> 03:21:47.909]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:21:56.845 --> 03:21:58.427]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.427 --> 03:21:59.608]  The people strike back!
[03:22:01.354 --> 03:22:08.037]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:22:08.037 --> 03:22:16.141]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:16.141 --> 03:22:21.723]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[03:22:22.063 --> 03:22:24.306]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[03:22:24.306 --> 03:22:29.412]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:29.412 --> 03:22:34.638]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:34.638 --> 03:22:38.343]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:22:38.963 --> 03:22:40.044]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:40.044 --> 03:22:44.566]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:22:44.566 --> 03:22:49.468]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:22:49.468 --> 03:22:52.449]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[03:22:52.449 --> 03:22:54.230]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:54.230 --> 03:22:54.470]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:02.242 --> 03:23:04.243]  Remain in your houses.
[03:23:04.243 --> 03:23:10.006]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:23:10.006 --> 03:23:11.367]  Will they do it?
[03:23:11.367 --> 03:23:13.988]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:23:13.988 --> 03:23:19.911]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:23:20.447 --> 03:23:22.628]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:23:22.628 --> 03:23:26.909]  Executive Order 10-9-90 locks down all highways.
[03:23:26.909 --> 03:23:31.790]  Executive Order 10-9-95 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:23:31.790 --> 03:23:36.711]  Executive Order 10-9-98 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:23:36.711 --> 03:23:41.533]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:23:42.453 --> 03:23:50.875]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:23:50.875 --> 03:23:53.356]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:23:53.356 --> 03:23:56.437]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:23:56.437 --> 03:23:59.357]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:24:26.916 --> 03:24:31.378]  The guys are laughing because during the breaks I do three and four minute radio interviews.
[03:24:31.378 --> 03:24:35.000]  Just did one on 1360 AM in Dallas.
[03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:37.461]  There is no doubt I'm the hardest working man on radio.
[03:24:40.066 --> 03:24:44.489]  And one of the hardest working writers and researchers out there is Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[03:24:44.489 --> 03:24:45.390]  Always honored to have him.
[03:24:45.390 --> 03:24:46.591]  We've got him in this segment and the next.
[03:24:46.591 --> 03:24:47.631]  This is a short segment.
[03:24:47.631 --> 03:24:49.413]  Dr. Roberts, let's get into the dollar.
[03:24:49.413 --> 03:25:04.984]  You know, I got the New York Post saying dollar loses world reserve status and then says, shows the numbers that governments and central banks, even our own central banks, are converting away from the dollar being the main reserve, though they're still buying treasuries at record pace.
[03:25:04.984 --> 03:25:08.407]  And I kind of ignore the New York Post, but then I see it in the Associated Press.
[03:25:09.447 --> 03:25:16.391]  It appears the establishment is trying to kill the dollar while pushing us under the water, saying, oh, I don't want to kill it.
[03:25:16.391 --> 03:25:18.092]  Here, I'm going to push you under.
[03:25:18.092 --> 03:25:19.172]  You're an expert on this.
[03:25:19.172 --> 03:25:27.617]  I can't think of a better expert, you know, running the Treasury Department, doing a great job when you did do it, about where we're going in all of this.
[03:25:27.617 --> 03:25:31.318]  The banks are reporting record profits on the bailout money.
[03:25:31.318 --> 03:25:36.241]  Main Street is evaporating before our eyes, and they're calling this a jobless recovery.
[03:25:36.241 --> 03:25:37.982]  What is really going on, Dr. Roberts?
[03:25:39.338 --> 03:25:41.019]  Okay, well, a whole bunch of things.
[03:25:41.019 --> 03:25:50.706]  But first, for the dollar, what's going on is that since the spring, like in the last six months, it's been rapidly losing value.
[03:25:50.706 --> 03:26:00.373]  And this is independent of any words that any central banker or policymaker would say.
[03:26:00.373 --> 03:26:04.977]  Have you ever heard of the Botswana Pula?
[03:26:04.977 --> 03:26:05.357]  Yes.
[03:26:05.357 --> 03:26:08.119]  The Pula is the currency of Botswana.
[03:26:09.782 --> 03:26:20.344]  And in the last six months, it has gained 14% in value against the dollar, the currency of the hegemonic superpower.
[03:26:20.344 --> 03:26:27.526]  Did you know that Brazil's real has gained 22% against the dollar?
[03:26:27.526 --> 03:26:35.067]  Or, to turn it around, the dollar has fallen 22% against the Brazilian currency?
[03:26:35.067 --> 03:26:38.888]  Fallen 14% against the Botswana?
[03:26:38.888 --> 03:26:39.208]  Pula?
[03:26:40.199 --> 03:26:44.622]  We've fallen 11% against the Russian ruble.
[03:26:44.622 --> 03:26:48.084]  And why is this happening?
[03:26:48.084 --> 03:26:59.292]  It's happening because the accumulation of massive trade deficits over so many years has flooded the world with dollar assets.
[03:26:59.292 --> 03:27:05.256]  And now the world is confronted with very large, massive
[03:27:06.529 --> 03:27:10.072]  Uh, federal budget deficits for this year, for next year.
[03:27:10.072 --> 03:27:17.157]  Indeed, for the next ten years, according to the latest, uh, CBO forecast.
[03:27:17.157 --> 03:27:21.040]  And there's no way to finance those deficits.
[03:27:21.040 --> 03:27:34.970]  Uh, in the past, we've financed our deficits, uh, by having our trading partners, who earn trade surpluses, uh, from our imports, recycling the dollars to buy the Treasury bonds.
[03:27:35.871 --> 03:27:47.460]  The deficits now are much larger than our trade deficit, and so there's no source of financing.
[03:27:47.460 --> 03:28:02.072]  We're getting some help from the fact that all the money we gave to the banks in the bailout, that some of this is being used to buy the Treasury bonds, but the world, for the most part, sees that the
[03:28:03.035 --> 03:28:06.016]  Federal Reserve is going to have to buy the bond.
[03:28:06.016 --> 03:28:08.217]  That means it has to monetize the debt.
[03:28:08.217 --> 03:28:12.678]  It has to take the Treasury bonds and create checking accounts.
[03:28:12.678 --> 03:28:16.499]  So the hyperinflation, in a nutshell, where is it going?
[03:28:16.499 --> 03:28:18.960]  I mean, they've always talked about killing the dollar.
[03:28:18.960 --> 03:28:20.620]  Now they're talking about how it's dying.
[03:28:20.620 --> 03:28:22.601]  I mean, is this the beginning of the end?
[03:28:22.601 --> 03:28:25.321]  Is there any pulling out?
[03:28:25.321 --> 03:28:30.183]  I don't think they're going to be able to avoid the
[03:28:32.179 --> 03:28:36.940]  The decline of the dollar's value, it's already happening.
[03:28:36.940 --> 03:28:41.781]  Look, it's approaching a parity with the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar.
[03:28:41.781 --> 03:28:51.363]  Anytime the dollar loses 14% against the Botswana Pula, you know that the writing is on the wall.
[03:28:51.363 --> 03:28:59.865]  So, I think, right now we're still undergoing deflation from
[03:29:00.925 --> 03:29:14.349]  The collapse of real estate values and commercial real estate values and a lot of just failed small businesses.
[03:29:14.349 --> 03:29:19.631]  But you cannot monetize debt without the inflation rate turning up.
[03:29:19.631 --> 03:29:27.394]  So I think next year we'll probably see the beginnings of inflation.
[03:29:30.050 --> 03:29:37.135]  More pressure will come on the dollar because people will say, hey, I don't want to buy those bonds.
[03:29:37.135 --> 03:29:38.456]  They're not paying anything.
[03:29:38.456 --> 03:29:40.738]  They've got inflation.
[03:29:40.738 --> 03:29:43.600]  And at some point, the Fed is going to be really trapped.
[03:29:43.600 --> 03:29:47.483]  How can they raise interest rates to attract borrowers?
[03:29:47.483 --> 03:29:48.664]  Doctors, stay there.
[03:29:48.664 --> 03:29:49.385]  We've got a break.
[03:29:49.385 --> 03:29:50.466]  Tell us about it when we get back.
[03:29:50.466 --> 03:29:51.807]  This is key.
[03:29:51.807 --> 03:29:53.188]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.188 --> 03:29:55.730]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.730 --> 03:29:58.392]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.374 --> 03:30:05.595]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.595 --> 03:30:07.615]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.615 --> 03:30:16.117]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:16.117 --> 03:30:21.679]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.679 --> 03:30:23.299]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.539 --> 03:30:30.063]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:30.063 --> 03:30:41.110]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:42.491]  That's right, clean water.
[03:30:42.751 --> 03:30:42.971]  We're good.
[03:31:02.173 --> 03:31:07.979]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:07.979 --> 03:31:15.567]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.567 --> 03:31:21.734]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.156 --> 03:31:24.118]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.118 --> 03:31:26.620]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.620 --> 03:31:38.211]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.211 --> 03:31:39.892]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.892 --> 03:31:41.754]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:41.754 --> 03:31:47.960]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:33:23.356 --> 03:33:33.519]  Things are happening that are so big right now, that I've been lately pointing out to listeners, I'm in above my head.
[03:33:33.519 --> 03:33:50.525]  The good news is, I was in LAX, had police come over that were fans again yesterday, leaving Austin, TSA that were fans again, people on the streets of LA, fans everywhere, listeners are saying they talked to their neighbors, they're already listening or have seen my films, and I'm just one little
[03:33:52.361 --> 03:33:55.565]  Gage, Weathervane, and all of this.
[03:33:55.565 --> 03:34:01.671]  And I'm getting so much coverage and so much attention that it's quite humbling, actually.
[03:34:01.671 --> 03:34:03.794]  I'm going to be honest, I don't like it.
[03:34:03.794 --> 03:34:13.705]  I like having an effect against the globalists, but the responsibility, and I'm not cracking under it, I'm just trying to grow up a little bit because, I mean, I never intended
[03:34:15.011 --> 03:34:19.033]  To be, you know, globally getting as big as Ron Paul.
[03:34:19.033 --> 03:34:32.200]  It's very, very humbling, and then I'm trying to make sure I'm accurate, I do a good job, but I guess in what I'm saying here, and I want Dr. Roberts' comment on this, and we'll get back into the dollar, is people are waking up everywhere.
[03:34:32.200 --> 03:34:35.602]  I'm on a bunch of big European radio stations today, U.S.
[03:34:35.602 --> 03:34:40.805]  radio stations, hundreds of interviews coming in a week, I can't even do a tenth of them.
[03:34:40.805 --> 03:34:42.806]  I know Dr. Roberts is in demand everywhere.
[03:34:42.806 --> 03:34:44.527]  I know he's seeing a big awakening.
[03:34:47.034 --> 03:34:50.997]  But at the same time, it doesn't matter if everybody's waking up.
[03:34:50.997 --> 03:34:58.862]  To a certain extent, the establishment is going hell-bent for leather and are committed, and no matter what, it looks like they're going to kill the dollar.
[03:34:58.862 --> 03:35:01.423]  As he said, it's already happening.
[03:35:01.423 --> 03:35:04.585]  Folks, do you know what this is going to look like?
[03:35:04.585 --> 03:35:15.812]  When not just we have inflation, but we can't buy foreign goods anymore because nobody wants our cruddy dollars, and we don't have any industry left, and we got a police state arrogantly stomping around
[03:35:16.873 --> 03:35:21.414]  Dr. Roberts, I'm ranting here, but can you extract something from what I've said and give me your take on it?
[03:35:21.414 --> 03:35:26.015]  I mean, I'm just, I'm getting to the point where I feel overwhelmed.
[03:35:26.015 --> 03:35:41.057]  Yeah, well, all those things you mentioned, or the paths we're going down, I think they're going to get, you know, in this next year, something is going to happen to push up interest rates.
[03:35:41.057 --> 03:35:45.498]  Either domestic inflation from money creation,
[03:35:47.353 --> 03:35:56.039]  Or the inability of the Treasury to borrow at these extremely low interest rates.
[03:35:56.039 --> 03:36:07.127]  And when that happens, then the economy, which is already suffering despite practically zero interest rates, will suffer more.
[03:36:07.127 --> 03:36:11.990]  And the unemployment rate measured the way it was measured when I was in the Treasury is now 21%.
[03:36:14.358 --> 03:36:16.219]  So, it can go a lot higher.
[03:36:16.219 --> 03:36:34.632]  In the meantime, the corporations are continuing to offshore jobs, they're continuing to bring in foreigners on work visas, and the high rates of legal immigration continue, so that there are more and more people competing for fewer jobs.
[03:36:34.632 --> 03:36:41.237]  So, this has to bring even more pressure on the American people.
[03:36:44.440 --> 03:36:45.860]  Well, they're already suffering.
[03:36:45.860 --> 03:36:57.603]  Look, you see, today or yesterday, it was reported that the investment banks are making so much money they're back to those massive bonuses.
[03:36:57.603 --> 03:37:05.664]  And it says that Goldman Sachs is going to give an average payout of 500,000 pounds, British pounds.
[03:37:05.664 --> 03:37:06.524]  That's 800,000 dollars.
[03:37:10.956 --> 03:37:18.022]  To each of its 5,500 London staff.
[03:37:18.022 --> 03:37:26.168]  The senior executives are going to get bonuses of several million pounds, and the top one's 10 million pounds.
[03:37:26.168 --> 03:37:27.529]  That's $16 million.
[03:37:27.529 --> 03:37:37.177]  So they're paying out these kinds of bonuses while New York City, for example, now has record homelessness with 16,000 kids and homeless
[03:37:39.312 --> 03:37:49.380]  Shelters, it's so bad, the city's giving free one-way airline tickets, trying to get the homeless to fly out the city.
[03:37:49.380 --> 03:37:52.102]  Detroit is completely collapsing!
[03:37:52.102 --> 03:37:54.423]  Detroit?
[03:37:54.423 --> 03:37:57.126]  But look, here is the tell-tale sign.
[03:37:57.126 --> 03:38:00.508]  New York's 5th Avenue.
[03:38:00.508 --> 03:38:03.530]  One of the most famous shopping meccas in the world.
[03:38:03.530 --> 03:38:04.751]  It's now got a 15.3% vacancy rate.
[03:38:08.306 --> 03:38:26.299]  On 5th Avenue in prime commercial real estate, John Williams reported today that when you look at retail sales adjusted for inflation, currently they are at the level of 10 years ago.
[03:38:26.299 --> 03:38:33.785]  He says that 10 years worth of retail sales growth has been destroyed.
[03:38:33.785 --> 03:38:36.387]  And he, you know, and I agree with him that this
[03:38:37.547 --> 03:38:39.408]  The crisis is just starting.
[03:38:39.408 --> 03:38:42.629]  It's not really even well underway.
[03:38:57.592 --> 03:39:00.633]  Is or is it going to come quicker?
[03:39:00.633 --> 03:39:10.157]  And what are the people going to do as New York State has passed 84 new taxes I was reading last week in the last year?
[03:39:10.157 --> 03:39:11.718]  The government just keeps growing.
[03:39:11.718 --> 03:39:15.139]  The government keeps adding people.
[03:39:15.139 --> 03:39:20.101]  Everybody I know is having really, you know, seeing cuts in pay or losing their jobs.
[03:39:20.101 --> 03:39:22.082]  And the media is saying the economy's recovered.
[03:39:22.082 --> 03:39:24.283]  I mean, where is this going?
[03:39:27.691 --> 03:39:30.512]  You know, we don't have, you know as well as I do, we don't have a media.
[03:39:30.512 --> 03:39:35.913]  The media serves as the ministry of truth, or the ministry of propaganda, you know.
[03:39:35.913 --> 03:39:42.755]  And whatever it says is unbelievable.
[03:39:42.755 --> 03:39:55.298]  Other than the trouble of the dollar, which is in oversupply, we have another amazing fact, and that is, for all of this decade, they kept the economy going by growing consumer debt.
[03:39:56.127 --> 03:39:57.547]  We've talked about this before.
[03:39:57.547 --> 03:40:03.309]  Well, now the consumers are all drowning in debt, and they can't take on any more.
[03:40:03.309 --> 03:40:07.631]  So, there's no way to expand consumer spending.
[03:40:07.631 --> 03:40:17.874]  You know, in the old days, consumer spending grew with the productivity of the workforce, but we still had industry and jobs here.
[03:40:17.874 --> 03:40:22.155]  So, people would be more productive, their real incomes would go up, they could spend more.
[03:40:22.155 --> 03:40:23.776]  That was the source of economic growth.
[03:40:24.540 --> 03:40:33.562]  For all the 21st century, the source of growth was driving the consumers deeper into debt, so they would borrow the money to keep the spending going.
[03:40:33.562 --> 03:40:36.022]  They would max out the credit cards.
[03:40:36.022 --> 03:40:39.643]  They took out home equity loans and spent the equity.
[03:40:39.643 --> 03:40:52.305]  And now that's stopped, so there's no way to get the consumer economy going except for the bankers, who are going to get these huge bonuses, of course, the armaments industries.
[03:40:54.435 --> 03:40:56.416]  Except the super-rich.
[03:40:56.416 --> 03:40:59.497]  The Americans don't have any income growth.
[03:40:59.497 --> 03:41:00.157]  That's right.
[03:41:00.157 --> 03:41:05.059]  And now they're faced, like you said, with more taxes.
[03:41:05.059 --> 03:41:18.145]  Because the states are broke, the counties are broke, the cities are broke, and the federal government is broke, so they're going to be forced into lower standards of living.
[03:41:18.145 --> 03:41:21.526]  And it's going to be really hard on the very poor
[03:41:22.509 --> 03:41:36.158]  But it's going to be hard on everybody and I don't know whether it will radicalize the people or whether the government will succeed in blaming Al Qaeda or terrorists or Iranians or Russians or whoever.
[03:41:36.158 --> 03:41:41.902]  I don't know what capacity the people have to
[03:41:43.160 --> 03:41:45.181]  Realize what's being done to them.
[03:41:45.181 --> 03:41:47.042]  Well, that was my next question.
[03:41:47.042 --> 03:41:50.384]  Is the media now saying Iran is killing the dollar?
[03:41:50.384 --> 03:41:51.105]  I'm sure you've seen that.
[03:41:51.105 --> 03:41:52.325]  I mean, you just mentioned it.
[03:41:52.325 --> 03:41:54.647]  And they're saying the Russians and Chinese are doing it.
[03:41:54.647 --> 03:41:59.529]  But I read what the Russians and Chinese and the Arabs are saying and the Persians are saying.
[03:41:59.529 --> 03:42:03.692]  They're going, look, all these countries, we keep buying your dollars.
[03:42:03.692 --> 03:42:06.874]  We're losing 10 percent on this in the last year.
[03:42:06.874 --> 03:42:11.016]  Your central banks have engaged in the policies that are doing this.
[03:42:11.016 --> 03:42:11.917]  Please stop.
[03:42:12.837 --> 03:42:18.462]  And then, meanwhile, the Federal Reserve comes out and blames them when they're the very group doing it.
[03:42:18.462 --> 03:42:18.742]  Right.
[03:42:18.742 --> 03:42:22.905]  See, I don't think anybody's trying to kill the dollar on purpose.
[03:42:22.905 --> 03:42:29.871]  I think the dollar's being killed because of the hubris and stupidity of the American policymakers.
[03:42:29.871 --> 03:42:34.995]  And the rest of the world sits there and watches this and says, well, look, they're going to kill it.
[03:42:34.995 --> 03:42:35.716]  They won't listen.
[03:42:35.716 --> 03:42:36.716]  There's nothing we can do.
[03:42:36.716 --> 03:42:41.000]  So let's be prepared and have something to use when they succeed.
[03:42:41.770 --> 03:42:45.172]  And through hubris and stupidity and killing the currency.
[03:42:45.172 --> 03:42:45.832]  Exactly!
[03:42:45.832 --> 03:42:46.592]  That's what they're saying.
[03:42:46.592 --> 03:42:53.715]  They're saying, when America goes down, it's going to be like a hydrogen bomb, devastating all the other economies.
[03:42:53.715 --> 03:42:57.537]  It's just, we're going to be in the middle of the smoldering crater, in the worst position.
[03:42:57.537 --> 03:42:59.598]  Doctor, what will this look like?
[03:42:59.598 --> 03:43:04.000]  Being a top economist, one of the top economists out there in the world, recognized.
[03:43:04.000 --> 03:43:06.721]  I mean, we've seen this in other countries, in other permutations.
[03:43:07.581 --> 03:43:10.603]  Well, I think it's going to be the hardest on the Americans.
[03:43:10.603 --> 03:43:14.125]  Because, as you said, we won't be able to pay for the imports, and we're very import-dependent.
[03:43:14.125 --> 03:43:17.126]  Not just on energy, but on manufactured goods and advanced technology products.
[03:43:17.126 --> 03:43:17.867]  And if you can't pay
[03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:43.455]  For your energy imports, then that disrupts food deliveries and people's ability to get to the jobs.
[03:43:43.455 --> 03:43:53.861]  You know, we have this sort of urban-suburban culture where people drive for an hour one way to jobs and back.
[03:43:53.861 --> 03:43:56.643]  So it's all kinds of problems of brewing there.
[03:43:56.643 --> 03:44:02.447]  I think it won't be all that terrible for other countries.
[03:44:02.447 --> 03:44:04.648]  China, of course, may lose a lot of its
[03:44:06.103 --> 03:44:21.070]  The value of a lot of its foreign exchange reserves, which are in dollars, but I don't know that that will particularly hurt them, because they've got the technology, they've got the industry, the paper isn't that important to them.
[03:44:21.070 --> 03:44:33.916]  And so you may know that Robert Fisk reported from Lebanon last week that China, Russia, including Japan and France, and the Gulf,
[03:44:34.620 --> 03:44:45.167]  Arab oil interests are already devising a substitute for the dollar when it goes.
[03:44:45.167 --> 03:44:48.990]  Now, when it goes, no one really knows.
[03:44:48.990 --> 03:44:52.852]  This gives a timeline of nine years.
[03:44:52.852 --> 03:44:58.736]  I myself don't see how the dollar can possibly survive as a world reserve currency for nine more years.
[03:45:03.706 --> 03:45:15.413]  What is going to happen when the dollar loses its status, it's going to put a brake on the ability of the United States to conduct wars.
[03:45:15.413 --> 03:45:27.719]  And so, we may actually get some peace as a payoff from the collapse of the dollar, because American power will collapse with it.
[03:45:27.719 --> 03:45:32.342]  And I think that's what the rest of the world sees, and I think that's why
[03:45:33.366 --> 03:46:00.042]  They're not particularly disturbed by the decline in the dollar because what they are disturbed by is the American way of being a bully, of being hegemonic, of ordering people around, of purchasing the leaders of foreign countries so that the leaders represent us rather than their own people.
[03:46:01.541 --> 03:46:02.683]  People are tired of that.
[03:46:02.683 --> 03:46:09.830]  You know, all the threats that we are always issuing to everybody, not just to Iran, but to everybody.
[03:46:09.830 --> 03:46:11.952]  Well, look at how they're trying to use the military.
[03:46:11.952 --> 03:46:12.813]  Look at the G20.
[03:46:12.813 --> 03:46:14.495]  Look at how they're openly deploying.
[03:46:14.495 --> 03:46:19.079]  Now the Pentagon wants 379,000 troops domestically.
[03:46:19.079 --> 03:46:24.105]  And in closing here, Doctor, I want to say bye to you in the break because I have a question for you off air.
[03:46:25.717 --> 03:46:34.907]  The establishment is certainly full of hubris, the private banking establishment running all these Ponzi schemes, but at the same time they're gearing up the prisons.
[03:46:34.907 --> 03:46:37.450]  They're telling local police get ready for riots.
[03:46:37.450 --> 03:46:39.031]  They've been doing this the last couple years.
[03:46:39.031 --> 03:46:44.697]  They're clearly getting the infrastructure ready for the implosion in the United States.
[03:46:44.697 --> 03:46:47.280]  So I think that shows there's a method to the madness.
[03:46:48.321 --> 03:46:56.163]  And that they've got some tricks up their sleeves, as the RAND Corporation document said last year, start a big new world war.
[03:46:56.163 --> 03:47:08.727]  Somehow they've got a trick, the Anglo-American establishment, allied with Israel, has tricks up their sleeves, and it looks like that's going to be war or giant false flags.
[03:47:08.727 --> 03:47:10.367]  Your take on that?
[03:47:10.367 --> 03:47:14.629]  Well, the only way they can have war is if foreigners will have to finance it.
[03:47:14.629 --> 03:47:16.069]  We can't finance it with no money.
[03:47:17.290 --> 03:47:22.594]  I mean, the current budget is 50% in the red.
[03:47:22.594 --> 03:47:31.199]  So, I think, you know, I do agree with you that they've got SWAT teams everywhere domestically.
[03:47:31.199 --> 03:47:34.782]  I see them even in these small mountain towns in North Georgia.
[03:47:34.782 --> 03:47:39.105]  They've got SWAT teams, which they don't need for any real reason.
[03:47:39.105 --> 03:47:43.828]  And so, I do think they expect that things are going to
[03:47:44.813 --> 03:47:46.074]  Get rough for them.
[03:47:46.074 --> 03:47:55.222]  And, you know, Gerald Solanti and others are predicting that there are going to be riots and there's going to be a revolution.
[03:47:55.222 --> 03:48:11.396]  And I think if the unemployment continues to rise, which I think it will do next year, there's going to be a lot of unrest and gangs and looting.
[03:48:12.568 --> 03:48:17.471]  Because people are going to be so hard-pressed, you know.
[03:48:17.471 --> 03:48:23.115]  In the old days, the Depression, when people lost their jobs, prices were falling.
[03:48:23.115 --> 03:48:27.558]  It's different if you lose your job and prices are rising.
[03:48:27.558 --> 03:48:36.064]  And so I think they've managed to fix a situation, a great situation, that's too big for them to handle.
[03:48:36.064 --> 03:48:37.745]  And I'm not sure they can handle
[03:48:39.409 --> 03:48:47.443]  The American population, look, just remember they could not successfully occupy Baghdad.
[03:48:47.443 --> 03:48:49.026]  The United States is a big place.
[03:48:49.026 --> 03:48:50.429]  It's a lot bigger than Afghanistan.
[03:48:52.011 --> 03:48:55.594]  That's why they're trying to recruit the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts to spy on people right now.
[03:48:55.594 --> 03:48:59.436]  But I agree, it's not going to go well and it's a disaster.
[03:48:59.436 --> 03:49:09.203]  It's like watching a train wreck as it's starting and we're watching it derail and cars are flipping over and people are flying out and the general public's still in a trance.
[03:49:09.203 --> 03:49:11.505]  I think a lot of them are starting to wake up as I talked about earlier.
[03:49:12.445 --> 03:49:23.780]  Uh, but people are waking up, but they don't know what to do, and I don't know what to do, because we know what the establishment's done, we know what they're setting up, and they don't care.
[03:49:23.780 --> 03:49:24.741]  They're just committed.
[03:49:25.711 --> 03:49:27.131]  Well, it could well be.
[03:49:27.131 --> 03:49:29.772]  We'll find ourselves ruled by the IMF.
[03:49:29.772 --> 03:49:31.713]  We'll be under an IMF austerity plan.
[03:49:56.092 --> 03:50:00.976]  Forcing us to balance our exports, imports.
[03:50:00.976 --> 03:50:02.837]  Forcing us to balance our budgets.
[03:50:02.837 --> 03:50:08.462]  The sort of thing that we've done to lesser developed countries for decades.
[03:50:08.462 --> 03:50:11.484]  So this may be what we face in the future.
[03:50:11.484 --> 03:50:16.548]  The world may say we've had enough of you and your stupidity and all the trouble you've caused everybody.
[03:50:16.548 --> 03:50:20.251]  And now, you're going to do as we say.
[03:50:20.251 --> 03:50:22.013]  Or you're not going to have any gas nor oil.
[03:50:24.818 --> 03:50:26.619]  So that may be our future.
[03:50:26.619 --> 03:50:33.281]  They may put us into the box that we belong in.
[03:50:33.281 --> 03:50:35.102]  Wow!
[03:50:35.102 --> 03:50:39.744]  He's a best-selling author of... Tell us about the newest version of your book, Doctor.
[03:50:39.744 --> 03:50:46.026]  I just had a second printing, so it's still available.
[03:50:46.026 --> 03:50:49.808]  And it will explain to them how the government has turned law
[03:50:50.773 --> 03:50:55.826]  Away from being a shield of the people into a weapon against the people.
[03:50:55.826 --> 03:50:57.490]  All the things you talk about.
[03:50:57.490 --> 03:50:59.295]  And it's the tyranny of good intentions.
[03:51:00.913 --> 03:51:01.974]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:01.974 --> 03:51:02.714]  Hello, friends.
[03:51:02.714 --> 03:51:05.856]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[03:51:05.856 --> 03:51:16.023]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned, pure, handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[03:51:28.291 --> 03:51:33.499]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.

[03:51:43.891 --> 03:51:45.172]  Don't take my word for it.

[03:52:02.657 --> 03:52:08.701]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.701 --> 03:52:14.586]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.586 --> 03:52:20.730]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.070 --> 03:52:23.030]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.030 --> 03:52:25.491]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.491 --> 03:52:38.693]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.693 --> 03:52:40.354]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.354 --> 03:52:42.214]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:42.214 --> 03:52:48.435]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:49.119 --> 03:52:57.393]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.393 --> 03:52:58.975]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.975 --> 03:53:00.157]  The people strike back!
[03:53:01.906 --> 03:53:03.668]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:53:03.668 --> 03:53:05.189]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:53:05.189 --> 03:53:06.510]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:53:06.510 --> 03:53:08.452]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:53:08.452 --> 03:53:17.260]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:53:17.260 --> 03:53:22.505]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:53:22.665 --> 03:53:24.466]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:53:24.466 --> 03:53:31.952]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[03:53:31.952 --> 03:53:36.135]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[03:53:36.135 --> 03:53:38.657]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.

[03:53:52.865 --> 03:53:53.225]  Watch me!
[03:54:09.228 --> 03:54:23.036]  Look, this doesn't have to happen.
[03:54:23.036 --> 03:54:24.557]  We don't have to live under this tyranny.
[03:54:25.714 --> 03:54:27.955]  We can wake up, we can say no.
[03:54:27.955 --> 03:54:30.797]  I know the average person in government isn't evil.
[03:54:30.797 --> 03:54:33.798]  I know the average American out on the street isn't a bad person.
[03:54:33.798 --> 03:54:43.464]  But you've got to get as knowledgeable about the geopolitical things that are happening, the international finance developments, as you are about football and baseball and acting cool.
[03:54:44.364 --> 03:54:46.826]  Believe me, I like going to a football game.
[03:54:46.826 --> 03:54:50.729]  If I start watching sports, I get into it within days and then I'm addicted.
[03:54:50.729 --> 03:54:53.631]  But I have to be addicted with real issues, folks.
[03:54:53.631 --> 03:54:54.912]  We're gonna get hurt real bad.
[03:54:54.912 --> 03:54:56.913]  We're being hurt real bad right now.
[03:54:56.913 --> 03:55:01.136]  But I mean stuff that makes the Great Depression look tame.
[03:55:01.136 --> 03:55:03.878]  90% of this country was agrarian.
[03:55:03.878 --> 03:55:04.979]  90% of this nation was rural.
[03:55:08.064 --> 03:55:14.574]  In 1929 to 1940 during the Great Depression, 90% lived in the country and the majority of them were self-sufficient.
[03:55:14.574 --> 03:55:16.517]  Around 80% were self-sufficient.
[03:55:16.517 --> 03:55:19.021]  The studies I've seen, 90% lived in the country, 10% in the cities.
[03:55:21.888 --> 03:55:33.293]  90% now, or right at 89, there's actually been a flight to the country by some smart people, but 89%, if you want to get technical on last year's numbers, the latest, now live in the cities.
[03:55:33.293 --> 03:55:33.633]  89%.
[03:55:33.633 --> 03:55:41.176]  11% live in the country, but only about half of that 11%, 5.5%, are self-sufficient.
[03:55:41.176 --> 03:55:46.618]  Now, what do you think's going to happen if society collapses like the Great Depression?
[03:55:46.618 --> 03:55:48.459]  People are not as moral as they were then,
[03:55:49.858 --> 03:55:53.299]  People will steal you blind in a minute.
[03:55:53.299 --> 03:55:54.980]  The government isn't going to be there to help you.
[03:55:54.980 --> 03:55:55.840]  They're going to be there.
[03:55:55.840 --> 03:56:02.823]  If you got money and land and two pennies rubbed together, the cops are going to have you by the ankles, shaking the chains out of your pockets.
[03:56:02.823 --> 03:56:06.524]  I mean, that's what they're doing now.
[03:56:06.524 --> 03:56:07.924]  This is not a game.
[03:56:07.924 --> 03:56:12.206]  I keep stressing that and stressing that and stressing it and stressing it.
[03:56:16.533 --> 03:56:18.814]  And I want you to have a sense of urgency.
[03:56:18.814 --> 03:56:20.134]  I mean, I'm totally exhausted.
[03:56:20.134 --> 03:56:29.078]  I got home at 3.30 last night, got in bed at 4, got up at 8 after a hard shoot yesterday with Jesse Ventura.
[03:56:29.078 --> 03:56:30.638]  I'm not complaining, but I'm here.
[03:56:30.638 --> 03:56:31.259]  Four hours.
[03:56:31.259 --> 03:56:35.000]  And then I'm doing two hours of radio after this today.
[03:56:35.000 --> 03:56:37.001]  Two hours of radio.
[03:56:37.001 --> 03:56:43.543]  And I feel guilty when I don't take, literally, lately it's been ten interviews a day we're turning down.
[03:56:43.543 --> 03:56:44.884]  I mean, it's just massive.
[03:56:44.884 --> 03:56:45.644]  I'm only the biggest.
[03:56:46.986 --> 03:56:47.886]  I am exhausted.
[03:56:47.886 --> 03:56:50.127]  I want to go to bed right now.
[03:56:50.127 --> 03:56:51.727]  I want to go eat dinner and see my family.
[03:56:51.727 --> 03:56:53.087]  I'm not going to.
[03:56:53.087 --> 03:56:58.128]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to have it said that I didn't do everything I could.
[03:56:58.128 --> 03:57:02.949]  Now, you don't have to save the world by yourself.
[03:57:02.949 --> 03:57:04.590]  But you better put some flyers up.
[03:57:04.590 --> 03:57:05.750]  You better talk to your neighbors.
[03:57:05.750 --> 03:57:11.231]  You better call in the local talk radio, or start your own show, or do an access show.
[03:57:11.231 --> 03:57:15.092]  Because the people are ready to hear the truth now, but most of them don't know.
[03:57:16.260 --> 03:57:28.103]  Most Americans are so passive, they don't even know who movie stars are, much less sports people, much less their politicians, much less what fractional reserve banking is.
[03:57:28.103 --> 03:57:30.824]  Folks, total collapse of society.
[03:57:30.824 --> 03:57:34.905]  It's guaranteed now that there's basically no way to even get out of it.
[03:57:34.905 --> 03:57:44.068]  All we can hope to do is warn everybody we can about who did it, because these globalists are going to use the crisis they created to bring even more tyranny in.
[03:57:45.967 --> 03:57:47.690]  This is a hot tyranny they've set up.
[03:57:47.690 --> 03:57:48.953]  I mean, a bloody one.
[03:57:48.953 --> 03:57:49.534]  It's a bad one.
[03:57:49.534 --> 03:57:52.219]  We're trying to just save this country and save the dollar.
[03:57:57.594 --> 03:58:02.078]  I'm going to ask you as listeners, please pre-order Fall of the Republic.
[03:58:02.078 --> 03:58:03.579]  Please buy DVD burners.
[03:58:03.579 --> 03:58:05.361]  Please make copies of it.
[03:58:05.361 --> 03:58:06.262]  Pre-order it now.
[03:58:06.262 --> 03:58:07.763]  It will ship out to you first.
[03:58:07.763 --> 03:58:10.826]  It's coming out next Wednesday, six days away.
[03:58:10.826 --> 03:58:12.808]  Six days away from Fall of the Republic.
[03:58:12.808 --> 03:58:14.129]  FalloftheRepublic.com.
[03:58:14.129 --> 03:58:15.270]  Infowars.com.
[03:58:16.351 --> 03:58:19.794]  You'll be able to watch it first at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality.
[03:58:19.794 --> 03:58:20.634]  Burn it to DivX.
[03:58:20.634 --> 03:58:21.715]  Give it to people.
[03:58:21.715 --> 03:58:23.196]  Please!
[03:58:23.196 --> 03:58:32.403]  Because if we don't cause a massive awakening, and it's starting to happen, that makes it even more frustrating because we can really win and beat these people if you take action now.
[03:58:32.403 --> 03:58:33.244]  Call the Republic.
[03:58:33.244 --> 03:58:34.004]  Pre-order it today.
[03:58:34.004 --> 03:58:34.865]  Don't wait.
[03:58:34.865 --> 03:58:36.506]  Spread the word about the show.
[03:58:36.506 --> 03:58:37.507]  Keep warning folks.
[03:58:37.507 --> 03:58:38.768]  We're having a big effect.
[03:58:38.768 --> 03:58:40.189]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:40.189 --> 03:58:41.210]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:43.373 --> 03:58:45.995]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:45.995 --> 03:58:51.499]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.499 --> 03:58:54.881]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.881 --> 03:58:58.504]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.504 --> 03:59:03.067]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:03.067 --> 03:59:08.671]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.951 --> 03:59:13.715]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.715 --> 03:59:17.337]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.337 --> 03:59:22.161]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:22.161 --> 03:59:28.725]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.725 --> 03:59:30.667]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:31.167 --> 03:59:34.348]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[03:59:34.348 --> 03:59:38.850]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[03:59:38.850 --> 03:59:41.011]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[03:59:41.011 --> 03:59:41.071]  877-327-0365.
[03:59:41.071 --> 03:59:42.112]  Don't wait, call today!
[03:59:51.806 --> 03:59:57.277]  Direct from Austin, coast to coast, and in your face!
[03:59:57.277 --> 04:00:00.483]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
