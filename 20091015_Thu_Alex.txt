[00:34.160 --> 00:41.280]  I am here ladies and gentlemen I love my American Airlines flight being delayed
[00:41.280 --> 00:48.320]  for five hours almost five hours in Los Angeles yesterday got home about 3 30
[00:48.320 --> 00:53.240]  in the morning not complaining but if I'm a bit sluggish here at the beginning
[00:53.240 --> 00:59.800]  of this transmission bear with me I will get warmed up in fact I've kind of
[00:59.800 --> 01:04.560]  tracked past radio broadcasts I tend to rant more when I actually am tired and
[01:04.560 --> 01:09.200]  people seem to enjoy those I know I don't I'm very upset about watching the
[01:09.200 --> 01:17.920]  walls close in on our society inside the scientific dictatorship every day the
[01:17.920 --> 01:22.560]  news gets more important more in focus with what we're dealing with this
[01:22.560 --> 01:30.760]  global tyranny I want to open the phones up again today for folks to talk
[01:30.760 --> 01:38.880]  about all the amazing things that are happening in our world so many times I
[01:38.880 --> 01:44.120]  start the show with the intentions of taking your calls and we've been doing
[01:44.120 --> 01:49.800]  that but I want to take a lot of your phone calls today it's a whole free
[01:49.800 --> 01:59.440]  number to join us is 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 and we will get you up
[01:59.440 --> 02:13.000]  and on the air I was out in California consulting for and appearing in
[02:13.000 --> 02:19.780]  Jesse Ventura's TV show that's set to air in December in January called
[02:19.780 --> 02:27.880]  conspiracy theory and I interviewed Jesse it's about a 10-minute video
[02:27.880 --> 02:37.720]  interview that I'll be airing either either tomorrow or Monday but I was
[02:37.720 --> 02:44.480]  talking to Jesse and he he did what a lot of people have done I said well when I
[02:44.480 --> 02:49.760]  interviewed you back in October of last year you talked about how candidate
[02:49.760 --> 02:57.280]  Obama was already flip-flopping on his anti-war stance and he said yes I don't
[02:57.280 --> 03:01.200]  like either party and I said well he's already increased the troops in
[03:01.200 --> 03:06.920]  Afghanistan and he said no he's discussing increasing troops in Afghanistan
[03:06.920 --> 03:13.000]  and I pointed out to him because we all fall for this but that was a classic
[03:13.000 --> 03:22.720]  example of psychological warfare right out of a British psych warfare manual
[03:22.720 --> 03:29.840]  that was declassified decades ago that I happen to read in a psychology journal
[03:29.840 --> 03:36.280]  many years ago and that was one of the tactics they engage in you see he's
[03:36.280 --> 03:42.320]  increased the troops already twice publicly once sent 30,000 troops and
[03:42.320 --> 03:48.680]  secretly sent and it's now broke earlier this week on Monday 13,000 more troops
[03:48.680 --> 03:55.560]  while he's having a public debate about 40 to 48,000 more troops you got to love
[03:55.560 --> 04:00.760]  that and this is just the basic army handbook I mean there were
[04:00.760 --> 04:12.120]  conservatively 40,000 at one time US observers in 1960 and there were 6,000
[04:12.120 --> 04:21.040]  deaths of observers from 60 to 64 in Vietnam when the war was absolutely in
[04:21.040 --> 04:28.720]  full swing by 1961 but we didn't really have an official war and it still was a
[04:28.720 --> 04:34.040]  police action until 1964 four years later when the Pentagon staged the Gulf of
[04:34.040 --> 04:41.800]  Tonkin event and then I bought a Wall Street Journal as I was waiting in the
[04:41.800 --> 04:46.440]  airport for five hours and read most of it and they actually admitted the truth
[04:46.440 --> 04:52.160]  in there but hit it in plain view about the health care bill the insurance
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.800]  companies wrote the stinking thing the only reason they're pulling out now is
[04:56.800 --> 05:01.520]  because well I'll tell you about we get back have you heard that millionaire
[05:01.520 --> 05:05.040]  entrepreneur businessman your congressional candidate and author

[06:33.640 --> 06:40.120]  that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government

[08:35.800 --> 08:40.040]  and police as well as private snatch and grab forces in military uniforms
[08:40.040 --> 08:44.080]  grabbing people a few weeks ago off the streets of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
[08:44.080 --> 08:50.080]  neocon media said it was a hoax but the G20 confirmed that those were private
[08:50.080 --> 08:56.720]  contractors dressed as military kidnapping people that's right and we'll
[08:56.720 --> 09:03.000]  also discuss provocateurs out there trying to get a war started between the
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.320]  American people and the paramilitary forces that they have a raid inside the
[09:07.320 --> 09:15.160]  country and if whoever fires first loses ladies and gentlemen so we're going to

[09:26.760 --> 09:37.440]  1-800-259-9231 as I said in the first segment I just got back at 3 o'clock in
[09:37.440 --> 09:44.640]  the morning last night with a five-hour delayed flight out of good old Los
[09:44.640 --> 09:50.760]  Angeles I'm finally done or almost done consulting on and appearing in Jesse
[09:50.760 --> 09:56.160]  Ventura's television show conspiracy theory that'll be coming out in
[09:56.160 --> 10:01.440]  December and January is when the episodes are going to air that looks to be a
[10:01.440 --> 10:09.040]  very interesting television show that's a big weight off my shoulders and yes we
[10:09.040 --> 10:17.360]  are dropping the info weapon next Wednesday October 21st fall of the
[10:17.360 --> 10:22.480]  Republic and this film is another attempt to alert the American people the
[10:22.480 --> 10:27.480]  world to how all sovereign nation states are being imploded by designed by the
[10:27.480 --> 10:33.120]  global crime syndicate known as the New World Order so I'm very excited about the
[10:33.120 --> 10:37.200]  release of that film and I want to thank all of you out there that have got the
[10:37.200 --> 10:45.440]  buzz going their fever pitch on the internets as George W. Bush likes to
[10:45.440 --> 10:54.960]  call them later in the broadcast I bought a Wall Street Journal in the
[10:54.960 --> 11:02.320]  airport and opened it up and saw multiple articles that were actually
[11:02.320 --> 11:07.960]  truthful but it was reported in just a dry matter-of-fact way what I already
[11:07.960 --> 11:12.880]  knew and what many of the listeners of this broadcast already knew but but if
[11:12.880 --> 11:17.440]  you watch the national debate you would never even get an inkling of either from
[11:17.440 --> 11:21.320]  the Republican side or the Democratic side which is all part of the controlled
[11:21.320 --> 11:27.600]  debate the limited debate if you watch the news you would believe that
[11:27.600 --> 11:32.320]  Republicans and conservatives and insurance companies and hospitals and
[11:32.320 --> 11:38.040]  doctors are all together against the government-run healthcare bill and it
[11:38.040 --> 11:44.320]  does have rationing death panels and it does have a tax on businesses that give
[11:44.320 --> 11:47.880]  their employees too good an insurance if you're given full coverage insurance
[11:47.880 --> 11:53.400]  without a deductible you're given a 40% tax on your healthcare I mean it's right
[11:53.400 --> 11:59.320]  there in the bill in one of the five versions but we all hear that the
[11:59.320 --> 12:05.880]  senator Olympia Snow was the one Republican and that now the Senate
[12:05.880 --> 12:12.160]  committee has certified it and the government accounting offices have
[12:12.160 --> 12:16.840]  certified it as a good bill even though they're certifying a bill they haven't
[12:16.840 --> 12:20.760]  seen there's five different versions and they're constantly adding new things in
[12:20.760 --> 12:25.960]  committee and then we heard all the insurance companies pulled out of the
[12:25.960 --> 12:36.960]  deal now it is the mantra spouted and chanted by the controlled left that the
[12:36.960 --> 12:45.960]  insurance companies and HMOs are behind the fight against government
[12:45.960 --> 12:55.920]  healthcare in fact anytime I criticize one of the five government plans in
[12:55.920 --> 13:01.480]  there all basically the same some are worse than others they're all being like
[13:01.480 --> 13:06.360]  five decks of cards all integrated into each other with constant baiting and
[13:06.360 --> 13:10.320]  switching and okay I'll put an amendment on this bill to take out the rationing
[13:10.320 --> 13:14.520]  oh we'll put an amendment in there where we won't penalize seniors oh we'll put
[13:14.520 --> 13:18.400]  an amendment in here that you know you don't have to pay $5,000 a year in
[13:18.400 --> 13:21.760]  penalties if you don't go out and buy insurance you've only got to pay $2,000 a
[13:21.760 --> 13:27.160]  year and then they bait and switch and add it back into another version but if
[13:27.160 --> 13:31.480]  you watch the news you would believe that the insurance companies are fighting
[13:31.480 --> 13:36.000]  this bill well then why is it suddenly big news this week that the insurance
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.920]  companies are saying that they may pull out of the bill how are they pulling out
[13:41.920 --> 13:46.440]  of the bill or out of legislation a package of legislation that they're
[13:46.440 --> 13:51.960]  against and you read the Wall Street Journal it just calmly reports the
[13:51.960 --> 13:58.000]  facts with the statements by the head lobbyist that represents the insurance
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  companies the health insurance divisions of the United States the consortium head
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.880]  he's the spokesman and he says oh well we helped write these bills and we
[14:06.880 --> 14:14.120]  support these bills but we're pulling out because we don't like the fact that
[14:14.120 --> 14:19.920]  the penalties being cut from $5,000 to $2,000 if you don't get insurance the
[14:19.920 --> 14:23.320]  insurance companies wrote the stinking thing
[14:23.320 --> 14:30.900]  Obama is Mr. Wall Street this is nothing but a corporate boondoggle a looting
[14:30.900 --> 14:34.760]  just like the Banker bailout and he's prancing around in the left loves him
[14:34.760 --> 14:40.320]  and thinks he's Shea Guevara look I'm no fan of communism but communism this is
[14:40.320 --> 14:45.120]  not when you see the cover of Newsweek and it says we're all socialists now
[14:45.120 --> 14:51.120]  boulder dash we've all been robbed now it's like when I'm against the global
[14:51.120 --> 14:56.160]  carbon tax and I get emails and comments and big hit pieces written on me and
[14:56.160 --> 15:01.800]  anybody else that criticizes it does saying you work for oil companies when
[15:01.800 --> 15:07.880]  it is Exxon Mobil Royal Dutch Shell BP and every other major oil company is
[15:07.880 --> 15:15.320]  lined up I mean open a magazine up it's Exxon Mobil and Dutch Roll Shell and BP
[15:15.320 --> 15:22.360]  with ads for the carbon tax I mean I was in LAX I was in wing four of the
[15:22.360 --> 15:29.600]  airport go in there and every billboard I mean everyone I saw except for one
[15:29.600 --> 15:35.800]  little kiosk for plug-less charging there the there was some kiosk TV you know
[15:35.800 --> 15:43.240]  TV screens advertising wireless charging where you just you're so lazy you don't
[15:43.240 --> 15:47.440]  even plug your phone in you just throw it on to a plate so I did see some of
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.480]  those ads a little kiosk but the big billboards when you're walking down the
[15:51.480 --> 15:58.920]  concourse every one of them was banks and IBM and Siemens the German company
[15:58.920 --> 16:05.000]  saying global carbon tax is good we we want carbon taxes I buy magazines
[16:05.000 --> 16:11.000]  randomly on the rack before half the ads were drug ads now a third or half the
[16:11.000 --> 16:16.520]  ads are carbon tax ads oil companies telling you how great it is then I come
[16:16.520 --> 16:20.440]  out and say I don't want a carbon tax and I get to be told I work for the oil
[16:20.440 --> 16:26.320]  companies listen moron liberals okay can you open a magazine up and see and see
[16:26.320 --> 16:32.560]  the NFL advertising green carbon taxes and and and and the entire fortune
[16:32.560 --> 16:37.560]  500's behind it they're not doing this because it's a tax on them it's a tax on
[16:37.560 --> 16:43.520]  you and they're behind it and the insurance companies are now threatening to
[16:43.520 --> 16:50.520]  pull out of supporting the bill the different bills because it doesn't put a
[16:50.520 --> 16:56.200]  big enough fine on you if you don't go buy insurance from them they're just
[16:56.200 --> 17:01.040]  gonna raise insurance rates on the American people and I had a chance to
[17:01.040 --> 17:04.680]  watch Glenn Beck Tuesday night my hotel room in Los Angeles watch the whole show
[17:04.680 --> 17:12.080]  very talented guy very well done I admire his skill and also admire his
[17:12.080 --> 17:18.800]  skill at deception because he's telling you that Obama is mouse a tongue putting
[17:18.800 --> 17:22.160]  pictures of mouse a tongue up on the bulletin board up on the chalkboard and
[17:22.160 --> 17:27.720]  talking about how he's a radical and a communist no he's not oh he's got the
[17:27.720 --> 17:31.560]  street thugs that are they're always the enforcers for the bank this guy is
[17:31.560 --> 17:37.080]  somebody to bring the left into wars into police state and into carbon taxes
[17:37.080 --> 17:45.280]  and into the insurance companies being given liability protection and close to
[17:45.280 --> 17:49.160]  a trillion dollars of your money and then they're allowed because of liability
[17:49.160 --> 17:53.520]  protection to lower the amount of coverage you get I mean this is so
[17:53.520 --> 17:57.640]  amazing and then the Wall Street Journal just reports it like it's a good
[17:57.640 --> 18:01.840]  thing though they're like oh the insurance companies are threatening to
[18:01.840 --> 18:06.320]  pull out because the provisions they wrote are being watered down because
[18:06.320 --> 18:10.240]  Obama is having trouble getting it passed with the freshman Democrats and
[18:10.240 --> 18:16.040]  Republicans whose constituents are scared to death rightly so of having a
[18:16.040 --> 18:22.360]  five thousand and you know it's gonna go up from there a $5,000 penalty and
[18:22.360 --> 18:28.720]  Obama just wants it to be two thousand because he can't get it passed so the
[18:28.720 --> 18:32.600]  insurance companies are the greedy bastards they're the ones that had
[18:32.600 --> 18:35.480]  government get involved in health care they're the ones that are taking over
[18:35.480 --> 18:38.400]  everything they're the ones involved in capitation they're the ones running the
[18:38.400 --> 18:44.480]  HMOs getting everybody crappy care they make me sick and how do you explain to a
[18:44.480 --> 18:51.040]  moron Republican that know Obama isn't a communist and this isn't some leftist
[18:51.040 --> 18:55.720]  scheme and and and and and know the Republicans aren't good because the
[18:55.720 --> 19:00.120]  Republicans are in there supporting quietly the insurance company
[19:00.120 --> 19:07.320]  provisions it's so sick I mean it's just like Obama has increased the troops by

[24:46.720 --> 24:52.000]  been declassified that's why it's so hard to beat the globalist they created
[24:52.000 --> 25:00.240]  Saddam they created bin Laden they created Fidel Castro all on record they
[25:00.240 --> 25:05.240]  create their own enemies and I'll be talking about that with Stewart Rhodes
[25:05.240 --> 25:09.240]  of Oathkeepers later today because they are just like they did in the mid 90s
[25:09.240 --> 25:12.800]  infiltrating all the patriot groups and trying to stir up violence they're on
[25:12.800 --> 25:16.680]  the info wars and prison planet comment sections on articles going Alex is a
[25:16.680 --> 25:22.560]  wimp he doesn't call for violence trying to get people to comment and call for
[25:22.560 --> 25:26.280]  violence on there so they can have the national media demonize me and then
[25:26.280 --> 25:30.320]  come after us and they've been caught doing that over and over again these are
[25:30.320 --> 25:35.040]  standard operating procedures for the Pentagon it's extremely criminal but
[25:35.040 --> 25:39.160]  they don't care and I just want to warn everybody folks this stuff's really
[25:39.160 --> 25:47.000]  coming to a head so just look out Stephen in Indiana you're on the air
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.960]  welcome hello yes hello yes go ahead yeah there was a strange static there for a
[25:53.960 --> 25:59.280]  second yeah we have the Taylor's phone system and so when they go to you it

[26:11.880 --> 26:18.200]  collars and anyway in a Kroger rhyme at they were giving away well she's a
[26:18.200 --> 26:22.680]  giving away but for a fee they were offering flu shots recently so when I
[26:22.680 --> 26:26.640]  heard this over the like the loudspeaker there I was like what the heck and then
[26:26.640 --> 26:31.480]  if you take it a lot of big grocery store chains are giving you a $50 coupon
[26:31.480 --> 26:39.320]  really I didn't know that you talk about bribery but yeah I went up to the guy
[26:39.320 --> 26:42.600]  who was giving me shots outside the pharmacy he was sitting at a table with
[26:42.600 --> 26:45.840]  this woman and I kind of looked at him and I said well I didn't have any
[26:45.840 --> 26:49.280]  documentation to prove it unfortunately but I said you know these shots are
[26:49.280 --> 26:54.400]  actually making people sick and in some cases you know killing him and he can
[26:54.400 --> 26:57.920]  gave me this odd look at up disbelief of course because he you know he's just
[26:57.920 --> 27:02.760]  going by what he's told and so I saw him give one girl one woman a shot and
[27:02.760 --> 27:08.720]  luckily I came across a guy there and he said that I said I'm not taking those
[27:08.720 --> 27:12.520]  shots I know too much about him from I've been you know I've found out and he's
[27:12.520 --> 27:16.720]  and we start talking about your show you know interesting enough we had a you
[27:16.720 --> 27:20.840]  know we were on the same wavelength and I mean the time for two minutes and then
[27:20.840 --> 27:25.880]  recently I just had a home inspection and of course the housing authority here
[27:25.880 --> 27:29.840]  and the guy who's doing inspection highly enough but I was listening to your show
[27:29.840 --> 27:35.640]  and I brought it up and of course he said oh yeah Alex Jones yeah I was a
[27:35.640 --> 27:41.080]  important but you know I found out you know from a friend somebody knows about
[27:41.080 --> 27:44.360]  you so it's you you're a yeah I mean the words get now people know
[27:44.360 --> 27:49.560]  sure Steven were you live I mean is it a zoning rule like many cities and
[27:49.560 --> 27:53.480]  counties in different states have where even if you're not in government
[27:53.480 --> 27:59.400]  housing they do come out and quote inspect your home well I can't say for
[27:59.400 --> 28:04.800]  sure about that but Alex the interesting and that though I haven't but
[28:04.800 --> 28:08.840]  they started doing I don't you know I asked the guy about you know about the
[28:08.840 --> 28:12.480]  housing authority how it was founded and I was looking this up on on the net so
[28:12.480 --> 28:15.600]  somebody just showed up at your house without a warrant and said let me in I'm
[28:15.600 --> 28:20.520]  an inspector house how they do this yearly anyways yeah well that's being
[28:20.520 --> 28:27.160]  done nationwide listen I appreciate your call going back to the flu vaccine all
[28:27.160 --> 28:31.120]  you had to do was walk up to the counter and say hey in one of the shot
[28:31.120 --> 28:37.200]  bottles why don't you read the insert and you could have pulled the insert out
[28:37.200 --> 28:40.960]  in front of him in red where it said the Marisol a mercury based preservative
[28:40.960 --> 28:44.760]  you could have read where it says Gillian beret you could have read to him
[28:44.760 --> 28:51.720]  where it said may cause fertility problems that's on the inserts okay so
[28:51.720 --> 28:56.200]  the proof was right there on the table we're gonna go a break and come back and

[29:18.280 --> 29:21.320]  had locals on from the town I forget the name of the particular town but it
[29:21.320 --> 29:26.840]  described a man and woman husband and wife retirees waking up at 6 a.m. in the
[29:26.840 --> 29:31.680]  morning with police officers standing in front of them and the police said oh
[29:31.680 --> 29:35.720]  we're here with the housing authority we do inspections to make sure under
[29:35.720 --> 29:41.120]  zoning you don't have more than your occupancy living in this home and they

[33:44.400 --> 33:49.760]  for US Senate it's from the web archive.org which normally only archives
[33:49.760 --> 33:58.280]  real articles but it's the establishment will plant fake dis info to discredit
[33:58.280 --> 34:03.200]  people and I find it very surprising that this wouldn't have been discovered by
[34:03.200 --> 34:09.920]  now Kenyan born Obama all set for US Senate with millions of people googling
[34:09.920 --> 34:14.600]  the term Kenya born Obama or Obama born in Kenya this this would have been
[34:14.600 --> 34:18.880]  found previously I don't know I think it stinks to I heaven but it reads like a
[34:18.880 --> 34:24.000]  real article but I've seen plenty of operations like that so we'll cover that
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  too a little bit later let's continue going to your phone calls right now
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.880]  let's talk to Adam in Texas Adam you're on the air hi Alex I just want to thank
[34:33.880 --> 34:39.920]  you for kind of hitting the nail on the head in your assessment of the the
[34:39.920 --> 34:45.440]  health care bill it's very obvious from very beginning when HR 3200 was put on
[34:45.440 --> 34:50.480]  the web for us to read thousand plus pages you barely come you come to the
[34:50.480 --> 34:58.600]  creation of the health exchange that whole section alone put up the red flag
[34:58.600 --> 35:05.000]  that this was not about universal health care but a way to get the insurance
[35:05.000 --> 35:12.000]  companies to come in have government subsidized access to the 40 million
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.920]  uninsured that are in the country they're playing a back-and-forth game
[35:17.920 --> 35:24.120]  yeah they'll just pay tax money as a subsidy to the uninsured who'll then be
[35:24.120 --> 35:29.400]  given crappy care where they water it down and give liability protection and
[35:29.400 --> 35:33.000]  basically get rid of the Hippocratic oath in the system we've had meanwhile
[35:33.000 --> 35:38.520]  people that actually have insurance will pay extra tax to the insurance
[35:38.520 --> 35:44.120]  companies I mean it just goes on and on and but meanwhile it gives left cover
[35:44.120 --> 35:48.840]  to Obama to have the Republicans coming out and attacking the plan when it's
[35:48.840 --> 35:52.560]  actually the insurance companies that wrote it and again the insurance
[35:52.560 --> 35:57.560]  companies are publicly saying they may pull out now if the fine isn't big
[35:57.560 --> 36:02.680]  enough if you don't go out and get insurance so this is this is just a
[36:02.680 --> 36:09.240]  corporate welfare scam and why they're saying that is because they know that
[36:09.240 --> 36:13.720]  the American public will perceive oh well it must be a good bill if both the
[36:13.720 --> 36:18.400]  Republicans and the insurance companies are against it thereby playing on the
[36:18.400 --> 36:23.280]  left-right paradigm and it's even deeper than that this bill was not only written
[36:23.280 --> 36:28.920]  by the insurance companies the seed and the impetus of this bill comes from the
[36:28.920 --> 36:33.920]  Federal Reserve in their white papers that are up in on the web anyone can go
[36:33.920 --> 36:38.640]  to Federal Reserve St. Louis any of these other Federal Reserve websites read
[36:38.640 --> 36:44.680]  those white papers those white papers extrapolate what payments they can get
[36:44.680 --> 36:52.240]  out of the the US populace in order to continue the payment of the debt of the
[36:52.240 --> 36:57.160]  US debt to the Federal Reserve and they mentioned health care on health care
[36:57.160 --> 37:01.480]  yes it they say that you know you're absolutely right I've seen those in fact
[37:01.480 --> 37:05.720]  I should dig those back up I saw those weeks ago and we should post those on
[37:05.720 --> 37:10.520]  info wars.com and prismplanta.com with a blurb at the top pointing out but but
[37:10.520 --> 37:14.840]  yes that's all this is and they've done this in Europe and other places the same
[37:14.840 --> 37:20.320]  year we got the Federal Reserve we got the income tax 1913 and they've talked
[37:20.320 --> 37:24.760]  about new ways to tax people and how they're gonna do that is carbon taxes on
[37:24.760 --> 37:29.520]  your homes your cars on every facet of business they're gonna do it through new
[37:29.520 --> 37:34.960]  health care taxes that are nothing but a giant new slush fund of money for
[37:34.960 --> 37:40.440]  government to loot and pay to the banks all this is is a whole new area of taxes
[37:40.440 --> 37:46.120]  and as usual they get some of the slovenly population that wants something
[37:46.120 --> 37:51.360]  free to line up and say oh yes give us some more welfare when all welfare is
[37:51.360 --> 37:56.040]  ever used for is shackles to control people but that's only a small part of
[37:56.040 --> 38:01.080]  it it is the total takeover of our society and sets up government control
[38:01.080 --> 38:07.200]  of health care for a medical tyranny here inside the United States we have to
[38:07.200 --> 38:12.640]  stay away from is getting away from that argument and trying to blame skyrocketing
[38:12.640 --> 38:20.240]  health care costs on illegal aliens using the medical facilities they actually
[38:20.240 --> 38:25.200]  if you read the studies that are published by schools in Texas Arizona
[38:25.200 --> 38:30.200]  California not anything on the east coast they are one half of 1% of the
[38:30.200 --> 38:35.600]  total budget of any medical health care facility on the border that they are not
[38:35.600 --> 38:41.120]  the problem this is being done because they're trying to extrapolate money out
[38:41.120 --> 38:45.760]  of the American populace the American taxpayer they want them to live longer to
[38:45.760 --> 38:52.200]  work longer so that they can just pull as much money surreptitiously as they can
[38:52.200 --> 38:56.400]  on the premise that well we're going to give you some health care and you're
[38:56.400 --> 39:00.920]  going to feel good but we're going to take money out of your money we're going
[39:00.920 --> 39:03.320]  to take more money out of your check I hear you Adam and I appreciate your call
[39:03.320 --> 39:07.800]  as for the global elite wanting us to live longer actually they want us to live
[39:07.800 --> 39:11.040]  to about 60 and then die and they want us to buy a lot only be able to have one
[39:11.040 --> 39:17.120]  child and that's just for starters that stated that stated let's talk to Ryan
[39:17.120 --> 39:23.520]  and Indiana Ryan you're on the air good buddy what do you know about January 26
[39:23.520 --> 39:28.520]  and Obama happened having to be in federal court in California tell me about
[39:28.520 --> 39:33.400]  well I hear and I've got I've gone through several documents you know to
[39:33.400 --> 39:37.760]  try to confirm this is true in fact I have the name of the judge right here
[39:37.760 --> 39:43.360]  David Carter a federal judge David Carter is accepted the case so we have to
[39:43.360 --> 39:46.480]  have to prove that he was in fact eligible to be president the first place
[39:46.480 --> 39:52.120]  which now if you know a simple math he wasn't you know if you were born to a
[39:52.120 --> 39:56.040]  foreign national then the other parent have to have 10 years of residency five
[39:56.040 --> 40:00.840]  years of which have to be after the age of 14 his mother being 18 disqualifies
[40:00.840 --> 40:05.520]  that you know but at the time at the time that was the law it's I'm told it
[40:05.520 --> 40:13.400]  I've read it's not the law now but yes it's all a red herring because he it's
[40:13.400 --> 40:19.040]  50-50 where he was really born but it some evidence shows he probably was
[40:19.040 --> 40:27.360]  born in Hawaii but regardless the one American parent as you said had to be
[40:27.360 --> 40:30.480]  residing here for a certain period of time and she was too young to have been
[40:30.480 --> 40:34.920]  able to do that so he is a legitimate but isn't it strange that the other
[40:34.920 --> 40:40.640]  candidate he ran against was also born in the Panama Canal Zone and they tried
[40:40.640 --> 40:45.000]  to say oh well he was born to base but those bases didn't exist then so
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.960]  according to the letter of the law John McCain wasn't eligible but it's kind of
[40:49.960 --> 40:57.040]  like Dick Cheney really lived in Texas the same state as George W. Bush in 2000
[40:57.040 --> 41:00.400]  when they were running but then he lied and said he was really from Montana
[41:00.400 --> 41:05.120]  though he didn't have residency there and so they violated the Constitution there
[41:05.120 --> 41:09.040]  I mean it's just why can't we have candidates that don't violate the
[41:09.040 --> 41:14.080]  Constitution it's as if they're picking candidates to set the precedent to do
[41:14.080 --> 41:18.880]  that but you know overall Obama is a liar he's run by the bankers he's lied
[41:18.880 --> 41:23.560]  about everything he has all these corrupt mafia people around him he came up
[41:23.560 --> 41:31.800]  with Lagojevich under Axelrod and of course on top of that Rama manual as
[41:31.800 --> 41:35.800]  his handler I mean he's a horrible guy but in the final equation he's still
[41:35.800 --> 41:39.640]  just a puppet running nothing he's a front man who they mean to build up and
[41:39.640 --> 41:45.960]  then destroy and so there's almost a political gravitational pull towards the
[41:45.960 --> 41:49.960]  left-right paradigm and bashing these puppets and I certainly do it as well
[41:49.960 --> 41:58.000]  but you know I'm not is this the case launched by Alan Keyes' lawyer or who's
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.040]  launched this court case well I believe the people I've seen is actually hold
[42:02.040 --> 42:06.840]  on I can I can I can bring up a document right in front of me let's see I might
[42:06.840 --> 42:09.320]  have closed it while while we were talking but I can bring right back up
[42:09.320 --> 42:13.800]  while I'm looking for that there was also an article in my the town I grew up
[42:13.800 --> 42:18.320]  in rentler, Indiana they had a distribution of H1N1 vaccine will
[42:18.320 --> 42:23.920]  begin soon in Jasper County with with no author claiming responsibility for it
[42:23.920 --> 42:28.680]  and I went in to talk to the editor about this and the guy literally shook
[42:28.680 --> 42:32.920]  the entire time I was talking to him he just sat there and he shook like like
[42:32.920 --> 42:35.520]  someone who just got you know told he's going to jail for the rest of his life
[42:35.520 --> 42:40.760]  you know let's back up for a minute what did the headline say it says
[42:40.760 --> 42:46.000]  distribution of H1N1 vaccine will begin soon in Jasper County I have the
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.480]  paper right here right below it it says the target populations and then you
[42:49.480 --> 42:53.280]  know and it gives an article you know I can you know I got it right here if you
[42:53.280 --> 42:55.840]  want to hear the whole thing but you know why would he shake I mean they're
[42:55.840 --> 42:59.560]  distributing H1N1 all over the place right now that that's my point what
[42:59.560 --> 43:03.560]  you why why would he be so scared that you know I'm telling him you know you
[43:03.560 --> 43:06.680]  know some of these facts of H1N1 is not good for the people to live here and
[43:06.680 --> 43:09.800]  there was no concern for the people of our community there was more concern
[43:09.800 --> 43:14.760]  that I knew about any of this listen I hear you and I appreciate your call there
[43:14.760 --> 43:20.120]  is a mass-induced paranoia first they trigger 9-11 get everybody scared they
[43:20.120 --> 43:22.840]  tell you it's for people in foreign caves that we're setting up the police
[43:22.840 --> 43:26.280]  state then they announced no actually it's for the American people and gun
[43:26.280 --> 43:29.280]  owners and libertarians and conservatives and people that all like the
[43:29.280 --> 43:33.640]  fellow reserve and they teach all the police departments that right wing
[43:33.640 --> 43:36.480]  terrorists are about to bomb all the police departments and they do
[43:36.480 --> 43:41.280]  improvised explosive device training and they put military liaisons and all the
[43:41.280 --> 43:47.120]  big police departments and set up threat fusion centers and all over the place
[43:47.120 --> 43:52.760]  now they've they've recruited infigard spies and businesses who were all just
[43:52.760 --> 43:57.120]  completely paranoid they've they've recruited the plumbers and the cable
[43:57.120 --> 44:01.320]  people and the telephone man and they're all spying on you admittedly in the
[44:01.320 --> 44:06.200]  Girl Scouts and the Boy Scouts and first they train you to be searched and take
[44:06.200 --> 44:10.320]  your shoes off and take your jacket off and answer questions and can't have
[44:10.320 --> 44:14.680]  fluids at the and then now we want to have checkpoints outside the airports
[44:14.680 --> 44:17.600]  and then checkpoints at the bus terminals and checkpoints at the train
[44:17.600 --> 44:25.560]  stations and they just expand out all this paranoia and then local businesses
[44:25.560 --> 44:30.760]  get insurance breaks all over the country if they'll have an anti-terror
[44:30.760 --> 44:35.920]  drill where they hire local police or local private security firms to come in
[44:35.920 --> 44:40.880]  into a mock attack on the business all about creating this perception and they
[44:40.880 --> 44:45.160]  get citizen groups to watch the local surveillance cameras and everyone gets
[44:45.160 --> 44:52.360]  involved and last night at about 3 30 I was out of gas you know my plane came
[44:52.360 --> 44:57.240]  in right before three got my car drove home pulled into a Rudy's barbecue to
[44:57.240 --> 45:07.680]  get gas and about 3 30 on 360 and I get out I actually shot video this on my
[45:07.680 --> 45:12.960]  iPhone need to figure out how to email it to myself and get it posted on the
[45:12.960 --> 45:26.000]  site but I my windows are up as I pull in and I hear a loudspeaker like a
[45:26.000 --> 45:31.640]  bullhorn like the police are addressing me and I look around me nobody's in the
[45:31.640 --> 45:40.720]  well-lit parking lot I get out put my card in and I'm sitting there so it's
[45:40.720 --> 45:44.120]  almost out of gas and I've run out many times so I've just learned to pull over
[45:44.120 --> 45:51.440]  and not chance it and every minute on the minute it would announce you are in
[45:51.440 --> 45:59.160]  the Rudy's barbecue parking lot you can only pay by cat by card pay at the pump
[45:59.160 --> 46:06.000]  you are under surveillance by closed circuit television and I mean it was so
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.440]  loud it was like a drill sergeant screaming at me and there's a
[46:09.440 --> 46:15.600]  neighborhood 50 yards behind it I mean it's built in a neighborhood on the side
[46:15.600 --> 46:21.880]  of 360s and I mean do neighbors like the giant loudspeakers like it's a
[46:21.880 --> 46:26.200]  concentration camp blaring and I know in New York and other areas they have
[46:26.200 --> 46:33.000]  these loudspeakers where they boom and in England they even have the image of a
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.520]  mean face it's like a telescreen shouting at you and if you stand too long
[46:37.520 --> 46:41.840]  at a corner you're not allowed to loiter it screams messages and all over the US
[46:41.840 --> 46:45.720]  in England and Europe they've put in this they call it the mosquito system and
[46:45.720 --> 46:51.680]  it's an ultra low frequency that hurts people's ears under the age of 30 actually
[46:51.680 --> 46:55.280]  damages hearing it's an acoustic device in fact people won't believe me we've
[46:55.280 --> 46:58.960]  got a search engine mosquito system stops loiterers I think that's a
[46:58.960 --> 47:05.160]  headline and I was there trying to you know pump the gas I was there trying to
[47:05.160 --> 47:08.920]  give them you know 40 bucks in my money and it was just blaring at me every
[47:08.920 --> 47:16.880]  minute blaring at me blaring at me and I guess I won't go back to Rudy's I mean
[47:16.880 --> 47:19.240]  I guess that's the only thing I can do and people could say oh well that's for
[47:19.240 --> 47:25.960]  your safety and it's not in a high crime area and I've read that's going in all
[47:25.960 --> 47:30.080]  over the place and normally you'd pull in it would go we've got hot coffee and
[47:30.080 --> 47:34.400]  donuts inside you know they have that outdoor advertising that audible
[47:34.400 --> 47:38.200]  advertising but that's always subdued I mean even in the airport it's like your
[47:38.200 --> 47:42.920]  attention please please don't leave any unattended bags please if someone tries
[47:42.920 --> 47:47.360]  to give you a bag don't take it it's all part of the Orwellian this but this was
[47:47.360 --> 47:53.320]  just shouting at me so loud I mean just blaring loud I mean I pulled up with the
[47:53.320 --> 47:57.120]  windows up and as I'm pulling in I'm like who's talking what what's through
[47:57.120 --> 48:02.480]  the windows I could hear it with an aggressive voice okay well I won't be
[48:02.480 --> 48:07.040]  going to Rudy's to buy barbecue ever again I guess is what I've got to do
[48:07.040 --> 48:11.520]  because I don't patronize big brother that's like well that's for your safety
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.280]  when you're in a parking lot at night well they don't have a lot of robberies
[48:15.280 --> 48:19.600]  and parking lots at night in Texas because people got guns but that's
[48:19.600 --> 48:26.560]  another issue it's just this nanny nanny state everyone's shaking and fear and
[48:26.560 --> 48:33.680]  everyone crying and it's just unbelievable I mean everywhere I go
[48:33.680 --> 48:38.640]  it's Girl Scouts training with Homeland Security and loud speakers blaring
[48:38.640 --> 48:42.320]  you're being watched as if any moron doesn't know that you're being watched
[48:42.320 --> 48:49.080]  I mean I guess if you work at night you're bad but what about the people in
[48:49.080 --> 48:55.360]  the neighborhood I mean a blaring but this is the new America is sonic
[48:55.360 --> 49:01.440]  weapons quote in areas where people congregate on the streets of New York and
[49:01.440 --> 49:07.480]  London I mean what what what is the deal and they report in New York that of a
[49:07.480 --> 49:11.080]  woman sits on a bench too long they come up and give her tickets you're only
[49:11.080 --> 49:13.600]  allowed to sit on the bench waiting for a bus a few minutes of the police they
[49:13.600 --> 49:16.560]  go ahead and walk around in circles then you can sit back down they're making
[49:16.560 --> 49:22.400]  all these rules to make you know the hundred thousand dollar fines at the
[49:22.400 --> 49:26.600]  garage sales fines if you're selling eggs or watermelons it's just it's just
[49:26.600 --> 49:30.840]  total harassment and then all these people that get hin pecked by the
[49:30.840 --> 49:33.560]  government and the media and the culture they then get their petty
[49:33.560 --> 49:38.520]  positions and they want to boss you around and peck on you and there's all
[49:38.520 --> 49:42.800]  these petty people that want power I was going through the checkpoint at LAX
[49:42.800 --> 49:47.320]  this really happened because I listened to what's going on and I'm it's like your
[49:47.320 --> 49:51.320]  camera and your laptop outs I took out of my bag I was so we've gone through I
[49:51.320 --> 49:54.960]  was putting it back on put my shoes back on put my belt back on my active
[49:54.960 --> 50:00.880]  contrition my active submission and I listen to these two guys talking while
[50:00.880 --> 50:06.080]  they're at the x-ray machine and the guy's going yeah I'm going for sergeant
[50:06.080 --> 50:11.000]  I admit it I want the power I want it and the guy's like going I know what you
[50:11.000 --> 50:16.680]  mean I like it it's good and I was like did I really hear that I mean I just
[50:16.680 --> 50:20.680]  then I forgot to zip my bag and picked it up and all my stuff dumped out because
[50:20.680 --> 50:25.320]  I mean hey do other people observe what's going on around them I mean do
[50:25.320 --> 50:28.880]  other people observe the insanity I mean it was like something out of a
[50:28.880 --> 50:32.280]  nightmare science fiction movie where you know you're at the checkpoint they're
[50:32.280 --> 50:37.360]  going I like the power I'm going for sergeant I admit it I want power I
[50:37.360 --> 50:41.520]  enjoy it I mean they were saying stuff like that so I tune in and start
[50:41.520 --> 50:45.560]  listening to it and I couldn't help it at the at the food lines there's
[50:45.560 --> 50:48.240]  something about people in stormtrooper outfits that are obese I mean I'm a
[50:48.240 --> 50:51.680]  little overweight but I'm sitting there taking iPhone pictures of them I got a
[50:51.680 --> 51:00.080]  file a report on all this oh my god help me I just beam me up Scotty I tell you
[51:00.080 --> 51:05.320]  have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power if so this
[51:05.320 --> 51:08.560]  is going to be the most important message you will ever hear solar power
[51:08.560 --> 51:12.320]  generators are now available from solutions from science in Thompson Illinois
[51:12.320 --> 51:16.240]  these emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you
[51:16.240 --> 51:20.920]  need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no
[51:20.920 --> 51:24.960]  fumes and produces electricity for free it's like having an electric power plant

[56:43.440 --> 56:46.840]  southern tier I just want to give you some updates of what's going on up here
[56:46.840 --> 56:51.880]  things have changed quite a bit since I talked to you last over the summer six
[56:51.880 --> 56:57.160]  weeks ago in Greece New York they had a military training exercise they have
[56:57.160 --> 57:01.880]  environmental police in Buffalo New York now in SUVs go driving around I don't
[57:01.880 --> 57:05.000]  know exactly what they're doing they're gonna be the home inspectors they're
[57:05.000 --> 57:09.760]  gonna they all they say what they're gonna do it's not pretty yep and I'm
[57:09.760 --> 57:13.600]  on Channel 7 news every time that they do a big bus or anything nowadays if you
[57:13.600 --> 57:19.120]  go into art their archives on wkbw.com you can see that the military are
[57:19.120 --> 57:24.440]  working alongside the police in full uniforms it's just changing from black
[57:24.440 --> 57:28.240]  and black to white since the last time I talked to you up here it's changed
[57:28.240 --> 57:34.320]  extra but actually yeah actually in upstate New York but also in central New
[57:34.320 --> 57:39.880]  York we have confirmed at least four towns including Schenactady that have
[57:39.880 --> 57:44.320]  openly announced they're putting troops on the streets National Guard and
[57:44.320 --> 57:49.600]  Regular Army they're calling for it in Alabama suddenly I get the videos every
[57:49.600 --> 57:53.200]  other day to the point I've been desensitizing it's not even a big deal
[57:53.200 --> 57:57.040]  now which is what they meant the psych warfare chiefs meant and even if you're
[57:57.040 --> 58:00.680]  against this you get conditioned that's the point condition the troops the
[58:00.680 --> 58:05.960]  police the public suddenly army marines National Guard or outrunning check
[58:05.960 --> 58:10.960]  points it's really happening it is it is hellish and that's because they're

[1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:30.000]  gonna cover the news let's continue with your phone calls Tony and Agri Falls
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:35.680]  were finishing up about the chemtrails in your area of the country yep for a
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:39.000]  while now I've heard about chemtrails but never seen any but I started to
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:42.400]  happen more and more as the summer progressed throughout the summer and
[1:00:42.400 --> 1:00:48.520]  there has been lots of lots of growing problems with vegetables I mean you
[1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:52.200]  touch tomatoes you touch squash and things and they disintegrate in your
[1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:57.400]  hands there's been so much rain this year that we have not seen as much rain
[1:00:57.400 --> 1:01:01.280]  in a very very long time and we would get weather reports saying that it's
[1:01:01.280 --> 1:01:04.840]  sunny it's gonna be sunny all week and then you'll see for like the weekend
[1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:08.880]  chemtrails all over the place and then all week long we would have nothing but
[1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:15.680]  rain and also one other point is the trains all throughout the state the
[1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:19.480]  tracks are filled with trains that are not been moved for at least a month a
[1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:23.280]  month and a half and when you start noticing that trains aren't moving
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:35.000]  there's definitely a problem the economy is shutting down and then meanwhile
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:39.360]  they keep telling you the economy is doing great everything's wonderful
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:44.120]  that's meant to make you feel like that you're a failure and that you're the
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:49.120]  only person who's losing their job or having a cut in wages or who can't make
[1:01:49.120 --> 1:01:55.480]  ends meet prices are going up this is all by design is the UN director of
[1:01:55.480 --> 1:02:00.160]  environmental affairs Maury Strong stated in 1992 that they would destroy
[1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:08.440]  US industrial capacity by design thanks for the call Tony let's take a call
[1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:14.560]  from Montana how do you pronounce your name la fe
[1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:21.400]  it's like life welcome thank you how are you doing good hey I want to thank you
[1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:25.920]  for coming up to harden and exposing the tricks that they were playing and not
[1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:31.560]  only harden but in state of Montana and the United States I feel you're one of
[1:02:31.560 --> 1:02:36.240]  the great sources that gets this news out to the nation this shows the tricks
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:40.120]  that these people are doing you know what's the latest I haven't I haven't
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:46.240]  looked into harden with the felon who was trying to hire another felon to come
[1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:50.440]  in and the town leaders trying to turn everything over to him including the
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:55.480]  police department where is that now they're all under investigation to rivers
[1:02:55.480 --> 1:03:01.200]  the individuals of two rivers and the APF and any sources that might be involved
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:05.200]  are all under investigation the Attorney General in Montana has broadened the
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:11.640]  scope to anyone who may have been involved is running around saying it's
[1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:15.840]  all legitimate and is the head of two rivers I saw him if Monday in the news
[1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:22.200]  saying I would do it all over again this was a great deal I did nothing wrong he
[1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:29.880]  is still holding on to that the sheriff there big here I believe his name is he
[1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:35.040]  is his corruption is being exposed more every day because of the involvement of
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:40.440]  your you and your crews a lot of the locals are taking a hearty harder look
[1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:46.480]  but they're governing and police officials well harden as I've said is a
[1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:51.120]  microcosm in the rest of the country I mean it seems crazy to have a Serbian
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:56.640]  felon driving around in police cars taking over a FEMA facility taking over
[1:03:56.640 --> 1:04:02.320]  a secretive giant detention center that was built but they admitted they wanted
[1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:06.960]  to put enemy combatants in but it's not as bizarre as having foreign offshore
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:11.560]  banks that just come in and rob everybody and then are praised as our dear
[1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:18.560]  leaders and most of his locals see that is how subtle they can be especially to
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:24.080]  a financially strapped area that they can come in suddenly and say we're your
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:29.800]  saviors this is what's best for you yes the new economy will be putting you in
[1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:36.720]  the jail yes oh absolutely and I believe this brought awareness to more
[1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:41.960]  people nationwide and worldwide not just as pardon in the state of Montana you're
[1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:47.080]  right really just thank you for exposing this so the people may see the subtleties

[1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:39.960]  I'm gonna go back to your phone calls here in just a few minutes but I wanted
[1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:45.800]  to go through some of today's important top stories dollar loses reserve status
[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:51.320]  to yen in euro this is the New York Post Ben Bernanke's dollar crisis went
[1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:56.680]  into a wider mode yesterday that'd be on Wednesday as the greenback was
[1:08:56.680 --> 1:09:00.640]  shockingly upstage by the euro and yen both of which can lay claim to the
[1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:04.520]  world's title as the currency favored by central banks as their reserve
[1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:08.280]  currency that's actually a true statement it's also in the wall street
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:11.880]  journal and several other publications I have here in front of me of what
[1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:17.200]  happened the last two days the media is trying to say the Arabs are doing this or
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:21.280]  the Chinese are doing this or the Russians are doing this and certainly
[1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:28.720]  they are the biggest holders of the greenback but they're sitting there
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:34.800]  asking the private central banks to control the planet why are you devaluing
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:39.360]  and they're actually continuing to buy Treasury notes so the dollars going down
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:44.080]  while Treasury actually goes up a little and so they're actually holding on
[1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:49.200]  saying please stop please stop devaluing it please stop doing this you know we're
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:56.680]  all holding trillions of dollars and trillions of Treasury notes why are
[1:09:56.680 --> 1:10:01.680]  you doing this and then our media says the dirty Arabs the dirty Arabs they're
[1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:05.480]  killing the dollar they're killing the dollar but then simultaneously admitting
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:10.720]  the central banks the private Federal Reserve the private families and the
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:14.880]  Bank of England same group they are openly starting to move away from the
[1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:21.760]  dollar themselves they are signaling the end just like Geithner did four months
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:24.760]  ago by the way that's in fall the Republic we show how they're gonna kill
[1:10:24.760 --> 1:10:30.600]  it just finished the film three weeks ago and notice right as the film is
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:35.600]  gonna come out they're gonna be doing it right in front of everyone that's kind
[1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:39.240]  of like how I went on air six months before five months before three months
[1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:43.440]  before but two months before went on air and said call the White House tell them
[1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:46.840]  don't blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset Osama bin
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:53.560]  Laden a bold move but I mean I could clearly see what they were doing
[1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:58.880]  dollar loses reserve status to yen and Euro Ben Bernanke's dollar crisis went
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:02.240]  into a wider mode yesterday as the greenback was shockingly upstage by the
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:06.240]  euro and yen both of which can lay claim to the world title is the currency
[1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:13.720]  favored by central banks as their reserve currency so you see but that's
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:20.520]  a deceptive first first line of the article because Ben Bernanke is the
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:25.440]  head of the biggest regional consortium of the private banks he's the head of
[1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:30.280]  the Federal Reserve so it's saying oh Ben Bernanke's crisis got worse when his
[1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:37.760]  private owners started moving away from the dollar over the last three months
[1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:43.400]  banks put 63% of their new cash into euros and yen not the greenbacks and
[1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:47.640]  that's JP Morgan Chase that's that's the brokerage firms Goldman Sachs I mean
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:53.240]  they're the ones but they'll tell the good old boys the Arabs did it and good
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:12:03.440]  old boys will say nuke them then I'm tough I hate A-Rabs of the last three
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:09.960]  months see it started at the last g20 banks put 63% of their new cash into
[1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:15.200]  euros and yen not the greenback and nearly complete reversal of the dollars
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:19.800]  one-time dominance for reserves according to Barclays capital the dollars
[1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:24.360]  share of new cash and central banks was down to 37% compared to two-thirds a
[1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:29.800]  decade ago currently dollars account for about 62% of the currency reserve
[1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:33.920]  central banks the lowest on records at the International Monetary Fund and
[1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:43.400]  within two years it's going to be a tiny fraction Bernanke he could go down the
[1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:47.520]  economic history as the man who killed the greenback on the operating table
[1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:52.680]  yeah because he wasn't a surgeon operating he was an executioner
[1:12:52.680 --> 1:12:56.640]  Bernanke was the executioner flipping the switch for the lethal injection he
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:05.240]  wasn't the doctor on the operating table that's like that's like saying
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:12.880]  Stalin was the patron of free market or something it's just I shouldn't laugh
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:16.400]  man this is gonna be a one hellish depression and they got the troops in
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:20.880]  place to crush you and to take everything we got make our kids their
[1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:28.760]  slaves and bring in the new green economy but all you people that love
[1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:33.160]  tyranny you're gonna get it's like kind of like the old-fashioned thing they
[1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:36.400]  would do when you're 10 11 12 years old and your dad would catch you smoking
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:40.120]  cigarettes my parents never did this but all the old-timers did it to their
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:44.400]  kids to try to cure them a smoke and it worked in many cases
[1:13:44.760 --> 1:13:52.120]  my mom quit smoking I guess when she was about 28 I was four years old and she
[1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:59.480]  went to shick it was in Dallas and it was in a room with dirty mirrors and
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:04.320]  piles of cigarette butts everywhere and ashes all over the floor and you sit in
[1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:07.160]  there and change smoke for three days and you know what a curator she hates
[1:14:07.160 --> 1:14:14.200]  cigarettes me I'd probably love going to the check center I sounds like a bottle
[1:14:14.200 --> 1:14:19.360]  of tequila I'm joking folks the point is it is
[1:14:21.080 --> 1:14:31.280]  sounds like hell actually but the way I was going into an analogy about too much
[1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:35.560]  is something and then and then got off into that story and then forgot about
[1:14:35.560 --> 1:14:46.880]  Bernanke I guess the parallel is the tyranny people are just gonna be force
[1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:55.160]  fed this and force fed this and force fed this until people revolt and that'll
[1:14:55.160 --> 1:15:02.520]  be the excuse to crack down even more currently dollars account for about 62
[1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:06.040]  percent of the currency reserves at central banks lowest on record said
[1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:10.320]  the International Monetary Fund Bernanke you go down in history as the man who
[1:15:10.320 --> 1:15:14.120]  killed the greenback on the operating table
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:22.120]  you know I hate that I'll tell a story I'll actually go back to my memory and
[1:15:22.120 --> 1:15:27.040]  focus in and then I forget the point I was making previously what was the point
[1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:30.480]  I was making you guys remember before I was getting into the old-timers would
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:34.480]  catch their kids smoking cigarettes and make them go in a closet and smoke a
[1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:40.440]  whole package and they got sick and I was talking about Bernanke who the hell
[1:15:40.440 --> 1:15:49.840]  knows what I was talking about oh man what's the point just having to sit here
[1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:53.080]  and hear about how Bernanke's trying to save us while it's the very central bank
[1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:59.120]  that's killing the dollar after printing up trillions of new dollars and new
[1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:03.760]  bonds to stimulate the economy the Federal Reserve Chief is now boxed into a
[1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:10.120]  corner oh he can't help it he can't help getting all this power battling two
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:15.440]  separate monsters that could devour the economy ravenous inflation on the one
[1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:20.400]  hand and a perilous recession on the other he's in a crisis worse than the
[1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:24.480]  meltdown ever was said Peter Schiff president of Euro-Pacific capital I
[1:16:24.480 --> 1:16:29.560]  fear that he could be the Fed chairman who brought down the whole thing investors
[1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:33.400]  in central banks are snubbing dollars because the greenback has kept two week
[1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:41.480]  by zero interest rates and a flood of greenbacks in the global economy they
[1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:45.600]  grumble that they loaned the US record amounts to cover its mounting debt I
[1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:49.040]  mean you gave the money the private banks you didn't loan us anything but
[1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:52.840]  are getting paid back with a currency that's worth 10% less in the past three
[1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:57.840]  months alone in a decade it's down nearly one-third and see as this
[1:16:57.840 --> 1:17:02.840]  telescopes towards the end it comes to a point where it loses more value in a
[1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:06.040]  month than it's lost in the last hundred see how that works we're now
[1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:10.880]  approaching that moment of truth don't worry they'll give you some Arabs to kill
[1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:16.880]  and you'll love it yesterday the dollar had a mixed performance falling slightly
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:21.760]  against the British pound economists believe the market rebellion against the
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:25.840]  dollar will spread until Bernanke starts raising interest rates from around zero
[1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:29.960]  to high single digits and puts the flood of currency spewed from US printing
[1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:36.200]  presses you got to cut that that's a cure but it's also going to stifle any
[1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:42.000]  US economic group said ship folks they took the 23.7 trillion if they would
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:45.640]  have pumped 23.7 trillion and again that's almost a three-month old number
[1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:48.280]  they still haven't given up the new numbers it'll be above 28 trillion on
[1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:54.000]  the graph as we follow it when they give the new numbers up it's already above
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:18:05.560]  that no doubt but let's just say 23.7 trillion that old number if they would
[1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:10.240]  have put that into the economy it would have been a bad precedent making
[1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:13.720]  government the sugar daddy but if they would just written everybody a check for
[1:18:13.720 --> 1:18:20.240]  a couple thousand dollars or more by the time the banks leverage it would have
[1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:23.920]  been hundreds of thousands of dollars per person it would have caused bad
[1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:28.960]  inflation but it would have actually built real economy instead you get at
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:32.240]  the death of Main Street the banks loaning none of the money and
[1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:35.600]  hoarding it all to buy their banks and insurance companies and vertically
[1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:38.400]  integrate infrastructure and that's all that's happening it's really very
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:46.240]  simple and then you as the taxpayer get put on the line for paying the taxes to
[1:18:46.240 --> 1:18:55.120]  back all of this currency and credit issuance you get to pay for all that
[1:18:55.120 --> 1:19:04.800]  with interest it really is the biggest fraud in history as Professor Black says
[1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:14.200]  in fall the Republic by an order of magnitude an order of magnitude a
[1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:22.760]  exponential increase I guess an order of magnitude would be set of a million
[1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:25.760]  we're talking about a billion set of a billion we're talking about a trillion
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:32.720]  on entire quantum leap just the total swindling by absolute made-off
[1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:37.400]  can lay type criminals and they got the army standing by and the military works
[1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:42.200]  for them and everybody thinks it's patriotic to walk through body scanners
[1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:47.160]  and have their kids told to spy on them not everybody but a lot of idiots do and
[1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:52.600]  so we're gonna get hurt real bad they're just gonna continue it they've built
[1:19:52.600 --> 1:19:56.640]  their FEMA camps they federalize the police they want to run paramilitary
[1:19:56.640 --> 1:20:00.320]  snatch and grab operations against the American people they beta tested it in

[1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:18.400]  physicists suspected of alkydol links charge his French physicist working in
[1:24:18.400 --> 1:24:24.360]  the gigantic particle accelerator physicists admitted to create a
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:28.640]  strange lit they could create a black hole but they say there's a low
[1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:34.240]  probability that it'll kill everybody you know in the 20s they came up with
[1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:39.440]  equations to create a bombs and hydrogen bombs and similar equations show that
[1:24:39.440 --> 1:24:44.360]  this sucker could destroy the planet or the entire solar system or more a
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:51.560]  twinkling of an eye but they don't care and then meanwhile they say alkyda alkyd
[1:24:51.560 --> 1:24:55.760]  is CIA ladies and gentlemen they're just using this as an excuse to set up the
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:59.960]  police state crackdown and make the Hadron collider in its activities secret
[1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:03.880]  from the public so no one can get an idea what's going on in it they use that
[1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:11.920]  to put up a fence a grid of controlled national security absolutely ridiculous
[1:25:11.920 --> 1:25:20.400]  now could this guy be some lone crazy scientist that wants to wreak havoc with
[1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:26.520]  the mega gigantor particle accelerator see they're not just going to be
[1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:31.400]  slamming heavy particles into lead blocks they're going to speed particles up
[1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:35.400]  and run them into each other just to see what happens oh let's see let's
[1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:44.120]  accelerate uranium and plutonium let's accelerate other heavy heavy particles
[1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:50.760]  into each other and see what they do hmm yes we don't know what it'll do it
[1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:54.680]  could be destructive but we could also make all these great discoveries so
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:26:01.160]  we're going to do it woman disabled by flu shot this is from Fox News in
[1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:07.760]  Washington DC an Ashburn Virginia woman is in the fight of her life
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:11.480]  or suffering a very rare side effect to the seasonal flu shot you know they
[1:26:11.480 --> 1:26:15.640]  admit it side effects in the insert a vast majority of doctors say flu shots
[1:26:15.640 --> 1:26:19.200]  are safe in this case the FDA says they found nothing wrong with particular
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:22.480]  batch but sometimes there are complications that's apparently what
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:28.920]  happened to Desiree Jennings and now her life will never be the same at 26
[1:26:28.920 --> 1:26:32.480]  year old Desiree Jennings was a pitcher of health she's a Washington Redskins
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:37.320]  cheerleader hmm and a avid runner her life changed forever on August 23rd when
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:42.680]  she says she got a seasonal flu shot at a local grocery store which has h1n1
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:46.440]  in it that's that's right not just the supposed h1n1 shot but it all has it I
[1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:52.480]  was training for a half marathon then said Jennings crying it just all went so
[1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:56.880]  fast you've had an autoimmune response lady most likely from the doctors we've
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:27:01.880]  interviewed you need to naughty any MSG any aspartame because that can help
[1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:05.000]  continue to cause a cascade effect triggering what's happened in your body
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.320]  now that may be the problem who knows it's one of the most common 10 days of
[1:27:09.320 --> 1:27:13.400]  receiving the shot she came down with the flu no after that her health spiraled
[1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:17.080]  downwards she started passing out and had to be hospitalized twice
[1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:22.560]  brain swelling that's the number one side effect just hope the body doesn't
[1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:27.480]  start eating the brainstem we went to an urgent care place but they couldn't
[1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:33.880]  even let her get out of the truck because she was seizing in the back so
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:37.800]  bad ah seizure if you'd have been a toddler getting there around the shots
[1:27:37.800 --> 1:27:41.400]  they would have CPS you taking you and resting your parents see that's they
[1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:46.000]  don't just hurt you and give you seizures they then take your children
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:50.040]  unless you're blessed and the child has the convulsion within minutes of the
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:52.960]  shot which does happen quite often then the doctors cover it up because they
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:57.480]  don't want liability but if you have it in the car or you put the baby down and
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:01.160]  say good night sweetie I love you and the baby that's good night mommy and the
[1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:05.240]  morning you're never gonna talk to baby again if baby doesn't die baby's gonna
[1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:10.680]  drool and gonna be in diapers for the rest of her or his life and when you
[1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:15.040]  take her to the doctor the police officers are gonna come because this is
[1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:19.880]  how the globalist operate stupid morons with no medical training told you've
[1:28:19.880 --> 1:28:23.600]  shaken the baby because when they can't scan the baby there's gonna be brain
[1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:30.840]  swelling and blood on the brain oh but the cheerleader could talk the 26 year
[1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:40.400]  old cheerleader could talk and so she couldn't be CPS'd so she was having
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:43.560]  seizures they called an ambulance immediately says her husband Brendan
[1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:47.400]  Jennings daughters at Fairfax and John Hopkins diagnosed her with a rare
[1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:52.680]  neurological disorder called dystonia see she happened to run into true doctors
[1:28:52.680 --> 1:28:55.960]  who wouldn't just lie and cover it up for liability they think it was caused by
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:29:01.120]  severe reaction of the flu shot there's a re now is difficulty speaking and walking
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:06.880]  and even eating well what's wrong I mean it's good for all the brain eating
[1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:12.040]  children out there what's wrong during interview with Fox 5 she had several
[1:29:12.040 --> 1:29:17.840]  seizures the effects were irreversible that's right it hits your brain stem and
[1:29:17.840 --> 1:29:24.200]  hit hit it hard the symptoms will get worse if I use my voice or walk when
[1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:28.400]  the brain signals are misfiring says Jennings as we reported her health
[1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:31.080]  problems the food and recommendation thinking there might have been something
[1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:36.680]  wrong with her vaccine but the FDA told her no no that's just a side effect and
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:41.280]  we wish you were a child because then we could kidnap you and get a bunch of
[1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:45.200]  medical funds out of you on the taxpayers back haha the plan's working

[1:33:26.280 --> 1:33:43.200]  how do you care about sports or money or status or going to cocktail parties and
[1:33:43.200 --> 1:33:49.680]  trying to look smart look handsome look pretty and social climb how can you be
[1:33:49.680 --> 1:33:57.080]  worldly and petty when you know that hundreds of thousands of children a
[1:33:57.080 --> 1:34:03.960]  year conservatively from one in 25,000 30 years ago to one in 96 are being
[1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:09.120]  completely brain damaged by vaccines via the autoimmune response from the
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:15.120]  adjuvant that is added and I've had countless medical doctors top
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:20.760]  neurologist top brain surgeons on this show and the drug company inserts
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:26.120]  admitted and they know it and here's mainstream news reporting the Food and
[1:34:26.120 --> 1:34:30.760]  Drug Administration says this is just a side effect ma'am you're paralyzed and
[1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:36.720]  are going to have seizures for the rest of your life and maybe die and if you
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:43.560]  have a child it normally reaches the toxicity level at 18 months the third
[1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:47.320]  round of shots most the autistic children became brain that damaged at 18
[1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:51.480]  months they're walking talking happy laughing singing along to Sesame Street
[1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:56.760]  it's over with the third round of shots and then the family's fight to keep their
[1:34:56.760 --> 1:35:01.200]  kids after the medical system has savagely attacked their brain and nervous
[1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:05.640]  system of the sickening soft kill weapon the mindless doctors are in la la
[1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:10.160]  land under a brainwashed trance not understanding what they're seeing but
[1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:13.600]  more and more medical doctors know what they're seeing and it's just admit it
[1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:19.640]  yeah the shots eating your brain you can have an autoimmune response you can
[1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:21.920]  have
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:36.120]  all sorts of other responses now we're gonna go over this woman disabled by
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:39.880]  flu shot reaction and this is happening all over the place Reuters came out as
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:43.240]  you know a month ago and said with the parent company of course involved
[1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:47.040]  heavily with the flu vaccine and said oh there's gonna be millions dying but
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:50.160]  that's normal to have millions dying of autoimmune problems and heart attacks
[1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:54.360]  because it can also cause an autoimmune response and the heart valves the heart
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:59.080]  ceases up that's in the inserts but but they admit it doesn't the inserts but
[1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:02.960]  then publicly say it's impossible it's not gonna happen if you die or get
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:06.080]  disabled it wasn't the shot even though you think it happened when you took the
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:09.840]  shot they're preemptively saying this can't happen the problem is the medical
[1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:14.960]  doctors who have actually read the literature go oh yes this is the shot
[1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:20.040]  until they get the AMA call saying no you're not to practice medicine we're
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:24.840]  telling you it wasn't the shot because big pharma and the eugenicist vaccine
[1:36:24.840 --> 1:36:28.960]  makers are taking over we're gonna talk about that and take your calls and get
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:33.320]  into a ton of other news that I haven't gotten into concerning the economy the
[1:36:33.320 --> 1:36:38.880]  government takeover of health care and a lot more but I want to go now to our
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:46.680]  interview our once a month visit with a cola blue for the next few minutes here
[1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:52.200]  because well if you're drinking tap water you're insane and most filter
[1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:56.920]  systems will reduce the number of dead bacteria the water systems only chlorinate
[1:36:56.920 --> 1:37:04.160]  and kill the bacteria you're drinking all the dead particulates and different
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:07.400]  bacteria that are carrying viruses and other things and the chlorine doesn't
[1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:10.440]  kill the viruses I mean if you're drinking tap water you're just asking for
[1:37:10.440 --> 1:37:15.400]  cancer and if you're in a fluoridated major city because the term fluorides
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:20.240]  hundreds of chemicals and I use in a color blue it's a great system it looks
[1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:23.480]  like a water cooler without a water bottle on the top and it grabs the water
[1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:26.760]  out of the air their basic unit gets seven and a half gallons a day on average
[1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:31.440]  and it's just an amazing system for the first time a color blue is selling the
[1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:42.120]  color blue 28 for only $1,000 and that's 20% off a super deal and to tell us
[1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:47.240]  about how long this deal is running is Lisa Pelton the director of East Coast
[1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:55.320]  sales for a cola blue calm Lisa good to have you here with us I'm doing okay
[1:37:55.320 --> 1:37:58.840]  except I'm reading them all these people dying and getting sick from the flu shot
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:03.720]  and I can't seem to be able to warn enough people and it's it's I guess
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:07.120]  because I have a conscience I don't even think of myself as a good guy and I've
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:10.440]  had a fundamental level I know that of all this carnage is going on by design
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:15.160]  it's it's it's it's it's it's very very upsetting to not be able to stop it
[1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:21.280]  well you know what Alex I have to tell you first of all you are my greatest
[1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:25.200]  influence and that's the reason why I'm here today talking to you about a color
[1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:30.960]  blue because I was sitting in the city listening to you and realized that I
[1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:35.840]  needed to fix one of the fundamental necessities of my family's life and that
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:41.840]  was water and you led me to a color blue so I want to thank you for that I

[1:41:52.440 --> 1:41:58.960]  it off of solar panels and it's a great system it uses more energy at first
[1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:02.600]  once it's doing its first batch of water but once it's built up the
[1:42:02.600 --> 1:42:05.040]  condensation and I don't know how to explain it but it's been explained to

[1:43:15.400 --> 1:43:19.880]  that are holding I do have a bunch of other news I want to get to with what's
[1:43:19.880 --> 1:43:25.400]  happening with Wall Street Wall Street profits are at record highs all time
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:35.680]  record highs JP Morgan Chase records and files a record third quarter profits
[1:43:35.680 --> 1:43:39.760]  they've never had profits this big all the big banks record profits they got
[1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:44.480]  your 23.7 trillion in taxpayer money they leveraged it through derivatives
[1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:50.800]  again we're gonna be covering that I want to get into what's happening in
[1:43:50.800 --> 1:43:55.160]  Afghanistan and more on the health care bill as the Wall Street Journal admits
[1:43:55.160 --> 1:43:58.240]  and it's not the Wall Street Journal admitting they've got the quotes from
[1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:03.800]  the head lobbyist the head lobbyist for the health care industry the spokesman
[1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:09.400]  saying oh yes we basically wrote these different bills and we are supporting it
[1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:15.000]  now now you always hear in the news they're neutral and then and then the
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:23.120]  controlled left media says oh yes the insurance companies say they're neutral
[1:44:23.120 --> 1:44:28.240]  but they're they really don't want this well no that's another lie they wrote it
[1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:33.160]  but now they're saying they may pull out if Obama and they list the things they
[1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:37.800]  don't like this is quotes from them I mean I already knew this from watching the
[1:44:37.800 --> 1:44:41.120]  lobbying funding and who was writing the bill in the different lobbyist but to
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:46.280]  see them reportedly it was a press conference I guess there's video of it
[1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:50.360]  out there somewhere it's got the name of the lobbyist all of it the head lobbyist
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:53.240]  the spokesman for the health care industry for the health care insurance
[1:44:53.240 --> 1:44:58.800]  industry excuse me saying we want bigger fines on people to make them get
[1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:03.760]  insurance I mean that's all this is is forcing you to give them money and then
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:08.240]  allowing them to lower the standard of care and we give liability protections
[1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:13.040]  just it's another tax folks and it's so bad because who do you think owns those
[1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:16.120]  big insurance companies the private central banks that's why the Federal
[1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:20.320]  Reserve is calling for this as well they want in your life and they can bring
[1:45:20.320 --> 1:45:24.640]  in a medical tyranny which they're now doing Randy in Chicago you're on the
[1:45:24.640 --> 1:45:30.400]  air Randy are you doing Alex greetings from the lion's den so to speak out
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:36.400]  here God bless you what's on your mind basically I listen to the show every day
[1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:41.480]  and pretty much I got visit today from the DWM from the Department of Water and
[1:45:41.480 --> 1:45:47.280]  I was just so compelled to call in and report this to you guys we just get an
[1:45:47.280 --> 1:45:53.800]  automatic meter reading device installed on our meter system for our water that's
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:58.880]  right Chicago Austin LA New York hundreds of cities are getting them that
[1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:04.040]  they came here about three months ago didn't ask us and it tracks off of the
[1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:07.760]  voltage what you're using what you're doing it's an incredibly sophisticated
[1:46:07.760 --> 1:46:15.120]  computer technology that knows the different different drawing systems of
[1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:20.040]  off your power grid it knows what a toaster is it first assesses okay
[1:46:20.040 --> 1:46:24.360]  that's a washer that's a toaster that's a TV that's a refrigerator and it tracks
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:29.080]  what you're doing and they say they will turn your power off to teach you to
[1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:32.440]  conserve they will tell you what the temperature your house is going to be
[1:46:32.440 --> 1:46:36.960]  this is all announced and going in nationwide tell me tell me Randy what
[1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:42.360]  happened well pretty much we got four warning that they were coming today I
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:47.880]  mean pretty much just left like about 30 45 minutes ago and you know the guy
[1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:52.680]  came in and went up on our you know storage area to install the device now
[1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:56.240]  I'm looking at the device of course you know there's nothing wrong with so you
[1:46:56.240 --> 1:47:00.400]  know I asked them I'm like okay well what's wrong with the old one and of
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:04.920]  course you know you get the I don't know I'm just you know following orders you
[1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:08.160]  know pretty much to install this and the most interesting thing because I asked
[1:47:08.160 --> 1:47:12.640]  for a pamphlet or some type of information for this and the interesting
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:16.640]  thing and I highlighted it right here says this equipment allows the Department
[1:47:16.640 --> 1:47:22.160]  of Water Management to DWM to collect media readings by radio signal so it's
[1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:25.000]  the point where they don't even have to knock on your door and say that we're
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:28.400]  reading your media they just drive up and collect whatever type of information
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:33.000]  that they feel compelled to you know to basically pull from you and who knows
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:37.320]  who knows what's next as far as is like trying to eaters or gas meter and so
[1:47:37.320 --> 1:47:43.760]  forth and so forth absolutely and they sell to the public in the name of a
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:46.640]  wireless reading and that's been going in for the last decade but the new
[1:47:46.640 --> 1:47:51.800]  systems and I have seen articles out of Illinois where they're doing it track
[1:47:51.800 --> 1:48:00.720]  everything you're doing and this is an Enron model of falsely manufactured
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:07.040]  artificial scarcity and to boil it down California is the model for the rest of
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:14.360]  the country and they went in and and obviously the governor great Davis was
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:19.520]  a bad guy and Schwarzenegger met with Kenley and others this was in the news
[1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:25.600]  they devised the plan to have the recall before it was even public they had
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:31.840]  mainline Republicans as the heads of it they then stood down let Schwarzenegger
[1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:37.120]  win knowing Republicans would put up with everything like gun control open
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:42.280]  borders more taxes if the person had an hour before their name and they knew he
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:46.280]  you know he would go along with the global green taxes all of it so
[1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:50.320]  California could pass the laws to then beta test them for the rest of the
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:55.560]  country now you're saying what does it do with meter readers California has
[1:48:55.560 --> 1:49:02.160]  already put in 5 million and they say they're gonna have 10 million in by
[1:49:02.160 --> 1:49:05.240]  next year and 10 million is basically all the houses in California there's
[1:49:05.240 --> 1:49:09.120]  only what is it 37 million in the state so there's so there's right around 10
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:15.560]  million maybe a little bit more homes in the state and they admit there attracts
[1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:19.320]  everything you do and they said to teach you about the environment we're gonna
[1:49:19.320 --> 1:49:24.600]  control what your thermostat is we're gonna set it at 80 you don't need more
[1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:32.480]  than that and but but going back to Enron devising this plan over a decade
[1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:37.560]  ago even before they got Schwarzenegger online remember the rolling blackouts in
[1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:43.680]  2000 2001 2002 and it came out in documents that Enron would just turn
[1:49:43.680 --> 1:49:49.200]  the power off to the whole state doing backroom deals with the different
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:52.440]  energy companies different power plants they would claim there was a power
[1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:55.880]  shortage and they said their internal documents because if we turn the power
[1:49:55.880 --> 1:50:01.520]  off every day for a few minutes or an hour you know different variants people
[1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:05.520]  will then believe there's really no power and they will accept a tripling of
[1:50:05.520 --> 1:50:10.080]  prices and some in some days they would steal close to a billion dollars they
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:13.480]  would still billions and billions a week doing this people live in California
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:18.080]  remember and then they got rid of great Davis saying he was behind it he was
[1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:20.880]  actually fighting it the one good thing he was doing then they put
[1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:24.320]  Schwarzenegger in the name of fighting it when he had been part of the inside
[1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:28.920]  deal and was actually invested in it and that's how these people operate I mean
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:34.000]  it's so diabolical that they're now going to do this nationwide I mean does
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:37.800]  that sound like a freedom to you Randy
[1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:43.680]  I'm a religious document documentary listener watcher and everything and in
[1:50:43.680 --> 1:50:47.920]  Ron and I saw the documentary everything is just all crazy and and keep up the

[1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:31.440]  wasn't a joke, government enslaving you and your family isn't a joke, the British
[1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:35.320]  government taking hundreds of thousands of poor people and putting them on ships
[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:40.000]  many cases 20-30% of them would die on the voyage it wasn't just black slaves
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:43.440]  getting brought over to America they would take the white slaves under the
[1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:47.760]  name of the law and put them in forced labor camps where the kids even grew up
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:57.240]  in Australia and that's what government does it just it makes you slaves and I'm
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:02.280]  gonna continue with your calls Donna Ronnie Scott Karen Sue and others here's
[1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:07.760]  the deal I have exhausted myself making fall the Republic it is the most
[1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:11.960]  important and informative and powerful film I've ever made each film gets a
[1:55:11.960 --> 1:55:15.120]  little better each time but this one is a quantum level better and more
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:18.240]  informative they're all excellent in different ways but I mean this really is
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:23.160]  a good film and it's up to you whether it's gonna have a whimper or a big bang
[1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:29.000]  and I think it's online to have a big big bang but start your engines if you
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:32.200]  order it now it pretty much isn't a pre-order as we start shipping out next
[1:55:32.200 --> 1:55:35.920]  Tuesday and Wednesday it comes out officially October 21st fall the
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:42.600]  Republic volume one and there's a lot of Obama in there but really Obama's on
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:46.840]  the cover and it's the subtitle is the presidency of Barack Obama to get
[1:55:46.840 --> 1:55:51.040]  mainline Republicans to watch it to think they're watching a democratic
[1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:56.320]  bashing film and then really we just break the paradigm I'll be honest with
[1:55:56.320 --> 1:56:00.440]  the audience I mean it is about how he's a puppet but how all presidents are
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:04.720]  puppets and the left will watch it because they hate me and you know they're
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:08.560]  George Soros funded and you know they think that we're racist or something you
[1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:14.320]  know the kind of the camp followers and then they'll find out oh my gosh this is
[1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:18.840]  a paradigm shift and that they wake up I mean this is like a silver bullet to a
[1:56:18.840 --> 1:56:26.080]  werewolf it's like a wooden stake to Count Dracula this film is the truth and
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:32.120]  it is a savage weapon against the enemy if you will employ it I mean I've made
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:35.840]  the giant weapons depot for you if you'll step up to the armory and take the
[1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:41.240]  weapon and open fire on the enemy we're unstoppable I mean I've already got the
[1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:45.560]  White House listing me as an enemy attacking me pulling out all the stops
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:49.160]  everywhere and hit pieces almost every day now in major publications and they
[1:56:49.160 --> 1:56:54.520]  always source the Obama deception they are upset about it and I'm not here
[1:56:54.520 --> 1:57:00.080]  risking my life to lose I'm doing my duty I'm stepping up to the plate against
[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:05.720]  these people and I'm asking you to step through the plate to I'm begging you
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:10.160]  folks I mean they really do every day shoot kids up and they have seizures and
[1:57:10.160 --> 1:57:13.160]  it brain damages them and most the time they take the people's kids after they
[1:57:13.160 --> 1:57:17.320]  hurt them that freaks me out
[1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:24.040]  you know more and more I realize almost even doing this radio show almost even
[1:57:24.040 --> 1:57:27.440]  getting up here and just calmly talking about it almost lessens how serious it
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:31.760]  is just going about my business almost I don't know what I'm supposed to do I
[1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:37.600]  feel like I should do more but I'm exhausted I'm just gonna ask you to do

[2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:29.000]  find a chair and I said yes you should go find a chair I was just that was
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:36.800]  talking with shopping at Macy's and the girls all took out pencils and papers and
[2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:40.000]  everything and I hope they're listening to you right now I told him what was in
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  the flu shot I went to Target and I talked to the pharmacist and she said

[2:01:49.880 --> 2:01:57.600]  best friends took it after I gave them information of the kazoo and her hut she
[2:01:57.600 --> 2:02:02.240]  told me that well they're sick they're real sick right now and she told me that
[2:02:02.240 --> 2:02:09.600]  she went out and came back home and her husband started acting weird he had they
[2:02:09.600 --> 2:02:15.680]  have a big sliding glass door in the from the kitchen and then you know it's
[2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:21.120]  cold up here in Ohio so he was outside on the front porch with a coat on and the
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:26.320]  house was real cold on the inside and he'll look at you now and he'll say in
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:32.040]  the middle of your conversation he'll say what's your name again I'm going oh
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:37.920]  no but my brother who's a policeman called me up and he's starting to hear
[2:02:37.920 --> 2:02:42.400]  things and he told me don't go around him for about three months so I don't
[2:02:42.400 --> 2:02:48.400]  know where he got that at but that's what he told me well no John Hopkins
[2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:54.160]  Mayo Clinic the insert you can go there and read at the insert for the the one
[2:02:54.160 --> 2:02:56.200]  they've been given out the last two weeks they're about to start the other
[2:02:56.200 --> 2:03:03.760]  injection the nasal is live it's called the live h1n1 nasal delivery vaccine is
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:08.120]  its name technical name and it says it's live virus it breeds and then spreads
[2:03:08.120 --> 2:03:14.200]  I mean they just admit they're spreading it I mean it's again they're so bold and
[2:03:14.200 --> 2:03:18.880]  insane in the way they do it I mean people are dying they're getting maimed
[2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:23.640]  they're having seizures and it's all funny and cute and then you warn your
[2:03:23.640 --> 2:03:27.960]  neighbors and they giggle and laugh at you I mean they're just man I tell you
[2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:33.400]  this is one sick country I mean that's all I can say and you know a lot of it
[2:03:33.400 --> 2:03:38.160]  is it's not even I'm tired I am tired today and I get to bed about 4 a.m. it's
[2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:44.920]  that I'm humbled by the knowledge and I have such an overwhelming amount of
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:50.480]  knowledge and understanding now that it's coming so much faster to me and it's
[2:03:50.480 --> 2:03:56.760]  so accurate that I'm it's like a brain boost I'm like it's going I'm just
[2:03:56.760 --> 2:04:02.120]  completely blasted by knowledge now I don't know how to describe it and I and
[2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:08.840]  I guess once you get to a certain point of immersion in something I don't know
[2:04:08.840 --> 2:04:14.240]  it's it it's just even trying to and then marveling at the evil marveling at
[2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:23.240]  the carnage I I've gotten to the point now where even the evil globalist they're
[2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:26.080]  more like a mad dog or something you don't even know what to do with them and
[2:04:26.080 --> 2:04:30.880]  but yeah I don't know it's just in the scrub it's like Jesus said forgive them
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:38.320]  father they know not what they do because it is just to know that they are
[2:04:38.320 --> 2:04:42.120]  doing so many horrible things everywhere and it's just intensifying all
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:50.280]  around us just it blows me away the word is blown away I am just blown away and

[2:07:55.640 --> 2:08:01.040]  number 1-800-409-5633
[2:08:01.400 --> 2:08:09.720]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[2:08:09.720 --> 2:08:20.480]  we're going to take the phone calls throughout the shower and Stuart Rhodes
[2:08:20.480 --> 2:08:24.720]  of Oath Keepers the founder of it is with us he was an aide to Congressman Ron
[2:08:24.720 --> 2:08:31.200]  Paul he was a paratrooper in the army he decided to start Oath Keepers which is
[2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:36.800]  really taken off all over the nation on the streets not even when I'm at events
[2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:40.800]  but I see people handing out Oath Keeper material I see people handing out
[2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:44.720]  flyers about the carbon tax and world government I went to Dutch roll shell
[2:08:44.720 --> 2:08:51.120]  last week to pay for some gas in Austin and there on the counter were anti
[2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:56.120]  Federal Reserve flyers and I said to the guy behind the counter I said is that
[2:08:56.120 --> 2:08:59.880]  where'd this come from he said oh the owner of this gas station not not the
[2:08:59.880 --> 2:09:04.000]  franchise itself the franchise owner you know of that particular shell put
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:08.240]  those out and so everywhere you're seeing activism and it's transcending
[2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:13.760]  the controlled left right paradigm and Oath Keepers is is getting the military
[2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:17.840]  to say we will follow our oath to protect and defend the Constitution and to
[2:09:17.840 --> 2:09:22.000]  not violate our oath to not put Americans in FEMA camps to not confiscate
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:27.880]  their guns now big national media have written scores of articles attacking
[2:09:27.880 --> 2:09:31.280]  myself and Stuart Rhodes they always include me into Oath Keepers even though
[2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:35.840]  I'm not a military veteran and they say this group wants to overthrow the
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:42.280]  president this group wants to have a war this group when Oath Keepers is about
[2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:48.160]  saying we're not gonna let criminals in government overthrow our country and we
[2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:53.920]  are peacefully speaking out against violence so there's a real attempt here
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:59.120]  to distort what's really happening and we're seeing a lot of goading on the
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:04.360]  forums a lot of pushing and it's come out countless times big court case just
[2:10:04.360 --> 2:10:10.480]  got lost by a government employee in Canada where it turned out that by day
[2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:17.160]  he was a hate crime fighter arresting people that criticize any group in any
[2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:22.280]  way or finding them or feeding them or but by night he was a Nazi actually
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:27.800]  outdoing the events this is how they work like they bombed Oklahoma City to
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:30.560]  blame it on the Patriot movement and that's all the evidence is there I've
[2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:34.000]  had police on that investigated it the bombs in the building you know the whole
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:38.040]  story the way the new world order is gonna operate is they're gonna attack
[2:10:38.040 --> 2:10:42.960]  their own police and military to then get them to attack the American people
[2:10:42.960 --> 2:10:48.080]  and launch this war we're trying to stop that from happening we're going to talk
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:51.880]  about that today with Stuart Rose we're gonna talk about Oath Keepers is gonna
[2:10:51.880 --> 2:11:01.280]  be linking up with 912 that Glenn Beck is one of the progenitors of but the
[2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:05.760]  people in it are good and I understand that a lot of people don't want to bash
[2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:11.320]  Glenn Beck I just I guess we could have a moratorium on Beck and say okay Beck if
[2:11:11.320 --> 2:11:15.400]  you ever come back and say there aren't FEMA camps again or that maybe the
[2:11:15.400 --> 2:11:18.480]  veterans are dangerous and crazy or maybe we should use troops against the
[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:26.440]  American people or Ron Paul's bad you know I've seen him at key junctures do
[2:11:26.440 --> 2:11:29.640]  this and if you don't think the establishment doesn't want to lead our
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:34.600]  movement against the new world order you're gonna then come in it's like the
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:39.800]  NRA authored the 1968 gun control act did you know that it's actually a pro gun
[2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:44.480]  control group it's members aren't so I'm really concerned about that but I think
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:49.120]  it's great to have our people not infiltrate but go in with the true message
[2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:54.200]  in denying 12 I think Oath Keepers are just fabulous as long as they keep their
[2:11:54.200 --> 2:12:00.960]  code of not going along with martial law police state and and the 10 you know
[2:12:00.960 --> 2:12:08.360]  the the 10 points that they swear that they're gonna uphold so very very
[2:12:08.360 --> 2:12:13.360]  complex issue here but I'm glad that our audience has embraced Stuart Rhodes and
[2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:17.400]  Oath Keepers from its embryonic phase I'm very honored to see Oath Keepers from
[2:12:17.400 --> 2:12:22.840]  its maiden voyage expand out into what it is today there is an extra 20 minute
[2:12:22.840 --> 2:12:27.800]  extra in fall the Republic that is the Oath Keepers they're also going to be in
[2:12:27.800 --> 2:12:36.360]  fall the Republic too but the extra in fall the Republic is a well we went to
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:41.280]  Lysington Green interviewed Stuart many others it's very very powerful let's now
[2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:44.920]  go to Stuart Rhodes Stuart good to have you here with us today thank you sir
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:49.440]  arm to be here again appreciate it I would touch on the 912 thing real
[2:12:49.440 --> 2:12:54.920]  quickly whatever the involvement of Beck was I talked to the National
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:13:00.240]  Coordinator for 912 and in fact she'll be to her name is is out of the other
[2:13:00.240 --> 2:13:03.680]  matter Davis and Patrick Jenkins founder of 912 is going to be at our
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:08.320]  convention this next weekend in Las Vegas October 24th and 25th is the is the
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:11.920]  first Oath Keeper convention but I got a good sense from talking to her that
[2:13:11.920 --> 2:13:16.320]  her sheet that really is grassroots driven and it's not about you know
[2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:21.720]  GOP party hacks really kind of nonsense it's about being nonpartisan and she
[2:13:21.720 --> 2:13:25.480]  factually she said that she's going to encourage folks to run independence in
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:30.200]  local races to break the block of the two-party system and what counts is
[2:13:30.200 --> 2:13:33.000]  whether you're a constitutionalist not whether you're you know are a
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:36.840]  Democrat or deep behind you listen different listen I want to be clear I
[2:13:36.840 --> 2:13:44.280]  hope you go on Glenn Beck I hope Glenn Beck like Saul of Tarsus gets knocked off
[2:13:44.280 --> 2:13:47.480]  his horse and wakes up becomes a good guy he just won't be on air very long
[2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:53.040]  at least the level he is I just I just know he's an operative and I know he's
[2:13:53.040 --> 2:13:56.200]  there to get everybody's confidence and betray everyone because he's proven it
[2:13:56.200 --> 2:14:00.720]  and I've listened to him and watched him you with great detail overall I think
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:03.760]  some of what he's doing is positive but he's only doing that so he can double
[2:14:03.760 --> 2:14:07.120]  back later so I don't want to just you know get into this here and say how
[2:14:07.120 --> 2:14:13.000]  dare the 912 project get involved this is good this is the true patriots Beck
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:18.280]  tried to take over what we started now we're going back and taking over what
[2:14:18.280 --> 2:14:23.920]  is rightfully ours the tea parties 912 everything else and I think you know on
[2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:27.000]  the surface we should be friendly towards Beck and I didn't even mean to
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:30.800]  get off into that you just told me off air that it looks like you guys are
[2:14:30.800 --> 2:14:35.520]  going to be part of the next big 912 event and so I think that's very very
[2:14:35.520 --> 2:14:39.280]  important but what they approached me about was that they want to do a big
[2:14:39.280 --> 2:14:42.280]  summit of all the different liberty leaders to come together and all the
[2:14:42.280 --> 2:14:45.840]  different organizations and they're targeting April for that April 15th or
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:49.680]  19th but I just talked to her again and encouraged her to think about doing one
[2:14:49.680 --> 2:14:53.200]  a lot sooner because we're running out of time and so I suppose if we do one on
[2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:57.040]  on the surface 1516 which is Bill of Rights Day and the anniversary of the
[2:14:57.040 --> 2:15:01.640]  Boston Tea Party hold it hold us like a symposium of national liberty leaders
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:04.920]  everybody doesn't make a difference who they are just come together and talk
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:09.640]  and then plan not just come together to protest but get together to plan and
[2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:13.160]  coordinate it's the time we do that I know other other folks who try to do
[2:15:13.160 --> 2:15:17.560]  that Bob Schultz of we the people at his condom is having his condo in
[2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:20.680]  Congress but the more we get together like this the better so I encourage
[2:15:20.680 --> 2:15:25.480]  any liberty organization leaders and also you come come down well I was
[2:15:25.480 --> 2:15:31.840]  invited to that that I didn't go because I was too busy working on the film and I
[2:15:31.840 --> 2:15:36.040]  think it's a fine idea it's just having only a select coterie of leaders
[2:15:36.040 --> 2:15:41.400]  together I don't think it's the way to is the way I would go to have a huge
[2:15:41.400 --> 2:15:47.480]  throng of different people together as long as but see 912 setting it up
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:52.680]  they're gonna direct it I guess no she's open to having my input so it's
[2:15:52.680 --> 2:15:56.200]  gonna be you know it's not gonna be just you know you have to be a certain
[2:15:56.200 --> 2:16:00.400]  elite if it's everyone from across the country all different grass no I know
[2:16:00.400 --> 2:16:05.680]  I'm just saying I'm just saying I hope that that the big event is directed by
[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:10.520]  by all the groups that are there and not just the 912 project it's not about
[2:16:10.520 --> 2:16:14.320]  912 it's about getting your petal point is to get everyone together I mean
[2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:17.840]  Colorado Keepers Summit that I mean it's about it's about a road to the
[2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:20.760]  Constitution and it's about getting together and working to defend hey
[2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:23.440]  regardless we need to get together and I absolutely agree with you that's
[2:16:23.440 --> 2:16:28.040]  exciting let's shift gears now into all the attack pieces I'm I'm there's so
[2:16:28.040 --> 2:16:31.800]  many I don't even read them all now when I see the headlines but I notice you and
[2:16:31.800 --> 2:16:38.080]  I are being attacked together you'll have like a 510 some cases ADL 15 page
[2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:42.920]  reports other probably Law Center George Soros groups and they always put you and
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:58.800]  together sure but they're also trying to imply that we're calling for
[2:16:58.800 --> 2:17:02.600]  revolution and violence meanwhile they've got their operatives out trying to
[2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:08.640]  stir up violence they're kind of in the 1990s model I don't see this working
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:13.000]  today I think people are looking right through them well and also the message
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:19.280]  message of both keepers is that you do not have to violate the Constitution to
[2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:22.080]  save it and this is what's different between us and other other other
[2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:26.600]  countries like Nazi Germany where the oath was to the Fuhrer the only only
[2:17:26.600 --> 2:17:30.680]  chance that over-saving Germany would be the rebel against their oath and and
[2:17:30.680 --> 2:17:34.360]  violate their own oath and kill Hitler in our country the oath is to the
[2:17:34.360 --> 2:17:38.920]  Constitution so that's why our message to police and military is only to
[2:17:38.920 --> 2:17:43.720]  refuse the unlawful orders and to stand down they can't be done without them
[2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:46.640]  and we even get criticism from folks who are like well I want to know what you're
[2:17:46.640 --> 2:17:50.280]  going to do that is what you won't do and I'm missing the whole point if the
[2:17:50.280 --> 2:17:54.480]  police and military don't do anything then we went but how can I do without
[2:17:54.480 --> 2:17:57.800]  that they have to bring in foreign troops well sure sure I mean I mean to
[2:17:57.800 --> 2:18:02.320]  boil it down somebody's got to say it's wrong to train to confiscate guns it's
[2:18:02.320 --> 2:18:06.480]  wrong to build FEMA camps that's all admitted now it's wrong to put military
[2:18:06.480 --> 2:18:10.200]  on the streets of America for regular police actions and not just emergencies
[2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:15.800]  all of this is clearly authoritarian un-American history shows it's bad we
[2:18:15.800 --> 2:18:19.120]  know the federal government's been hijacked by foreign banks and just
[2:18:19.120 --> 2:18:23.080]  shake our heads kind of wake ourselves up put our heads in a bucket of ice
[2:18:23.080 --> 2:18:27.680]  water and go wait a minute foreign offshore banks run by people like Ken
[2:18:27.680 --> 2:18:34.960]  Lay and Madoff have come in taken over and are engaged in crime and now the
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:38.400]  criminals are trying to direct the military and police to break their
[2:18:38.400 --> 2:18:44.600]  oaths to protect the corrupt elite no just follow the Constitution start
[2:18:44.600 --> 2:18:49.440]  saying no but the establishment by increments trains police and military
[2:18:49.440 --> 2:18:53.600]  to violate the Constitution of Bill of Rights a little bit by a little bit but
[2:18:53.600 --> 2:18:58.320]  before they know it they've been completely twisted right there's been
[2:18:58.320 --> 2:19:02.400]  there's been a standing on the streets and and dispersing people protesters and
[2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:06.760]  using down camp so that's the whole point of our method is to counteract that
[2:19:06.760 --> 2:19:11.520]  and to teach them about the Constitution and get them back to square one of
[2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:15.680]  being defenders of the Republic but there's that powerful peer pressure mode
[2:19:15.680 --> 2:19:19.760]  I mean I would imagine of the thousands of police and military but tonning women
[2:19:19.760 --> 2:19:23.880]  running for no reason having police dogs bite old women and there's video of
[2:19:23.880 --> 2:19:28.120]  this driving through empty neighborhoods sound canoning a kid if they walked out
[2:19:28.120 --> 2:19:31.240]  their front door with a football I mean just you're not allowed on the streets
[2:19:31.240 --> 2:19:35.440]  of Pittsburgh or Oakland Pennsylvania we come back I want to talk about that
[2:19:35.440 --> 2:19:38.720]  because I'm sure some of those troops and police were good people but in that
[2:19:38.720 --> 2:19:45.400]  mass psychology of war and and and with all the you know psychological
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:49.960]  brainwashing they've gone through the hypnotic suggestions of their training
[2:19:49.960 --> 2:19:54.520]  when the time came I mean they were looking for blood they wanted the blood
[2:19:54.520 --> 2:19:57.600]  of the American people we'll talk about that with Stuart Rose the founder of

[2:24:32.440 --> 2:24:35.480]  SWAT magazine so they're reaching out to those people
[2:24:35.480 --> 2:24:41.200]  Stuart graduated from Yale Law School where his paper solving the puzzle of
[2:24:41.200 --> 2:24:44.760]  enemy combatant status won Yale's Miller Prize for best paper on the Bill of
[2:24:44.760 --> 2:24:49.240]  Rights he assisted teaching U.S. military history Yale was a Yale research

[2:24:56.600 --> 2:25:00.760]  his caliber fighting the globalist takeover and he's another testament to
[2:25:00.760 --> 2:25:05.800]  taking action what Oath Keepers been around how long and it's I mean it's
[2:25:05.800 --> 2:25:11.440]  everywhere now it's exploding first official meeting on the green
[2:25:11.440 --> 2:25:17.920]  election to this last year this year April 19 2009 so it's less than a year
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:23.760]  old oh yeah yeah we're we're we're in our baby infancy but that's a big stage but
[2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:27.720]  it's growing like wildfire we have directors now about half the states and
[2:25:27.720 --> 2:25:31.560]  we're our goals to have stronger for chapters in every county because we got
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:35.160]  to reach the country for the county up that's there I'm gonna be honest with
[2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:38.720]  you and I'm not telling you to get into politics because what you're doing is
[2:25:38.720 --> 2:25:43.240]  more important the grassroots right now but I'm not impressed with some of the
[2:25:43.240 --> 2:25:48.320]  people running under the Ron Paul banner I'm not impressed with how they
[2:25:48.320 --> 2:25:52.320]  compromise I'm not talking about Ron Paul himself but some of the people kind of
[2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:55.880]  running on his coattails you are the type of person that's what's good about
[2:25:55.880 --> 2:25:59.560]  Oath Keepers we'll find more high caliber people who we should run for
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:04.000]  Congress well my I don't think I've ever worked for office because I think I'm
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:09.880]  much better at going and finding folks and and for example there's a candidate
[2:26:09.880 --> 2:26:15.080]  Orange County for Sheriff there Bill Hunt who we're putting putting our
[2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:21.240]  we're getting behind and I think he's a pretty committed patriot in lines of
[2:26:21.240 --> 2:26:24.400]  Sheriff Mack and that's what that's where I would start as a sheriff race in
[2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:27.760]  the county and can't hear us up in Uniquay County Tennessee we were just
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:31.200]  there in fact Chuck Baldwin was there too and his son Tim Baldwin were there
[2:26:31.200 --> 2:26:35.800]  for a for a picture rally up in Uniquay County in the north eastern corner of
[2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:39.120]  Tennessee and that's a pretty squared away sheriff too and there was a bunch of
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:43.560]  folks there open caring and the sheriff there endorsed and supported that he
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:47.320]  want people to do that once they exercise their rights so those were all
[2:26:47.320 --> 2:26:52.320]  good songs yeah the open carry is really going to defeat the gun grabbers
[2:26:52.320 --> 2:26:56.920]  because as you know they advertise all over TV that owning guns is illegal then
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:27:01.080]  they base all those TV shows in New York where they are and so all over the
[2:27:01.080 --> 2:27:04.880]  country people are getting the have you seen the John Elway Homeland Security
[2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:09.000]  video they're showing citizens yeah we see that yeah well for those that don't
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:13.200]  know they show gold and say terrorists in their home may have gold or they may
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:17.960]  have firearms call the police if you see firearms I mean we got we've got to
[2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:21.880]  start wearing our guns openly to just educate the sheeple that guns aren't
[2:27:21.880 --> 2:27:25.800]  illegal yeah but they'll even know that open carry is legal in most states and
[2:27:25.800 --> 2:27:29.680]  that's why and that's why folks are doing that is to put the point across
[2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:34.920]  that hey I'm not violating any code I'm not violating any statutes by standing
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:40.840]  here with the with a safety holster or you know I can't stress enough how much
[2:27:40.840 --> 2:27:44.160]  your organization is scaring the globalist I mean they admit they are
[2:27:44.160 --> 2:27:48.240]  scared of the police and military being recruited by the patriots and just
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:51.040]  well learning what it is to be an American rediscovering that we're gonna
[2:27:51.040 --> 2:27:54.120]  go to break and I want to come back and let you have the floor and then take some
[2:27:54.120 --> 2:27:58.840]  calls but you started getting into G20 watching the videos of police dogs
[2:27:58.840 --> 2:28:03.160]  biting old women coming out of shops with bags sound canoning peaceful
[2:28:03.160 --> 2:28:06.400]  neighborhoods going into the university at night saying you can't be out
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:12.400]  chasing women down Billy clubbing them I mean that is tyranny well it's kind of
[2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:15.000]  haven't happened Katrina yet you had police brought in from all over the
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:19.360]  country they're brought in and they don't know the local people at all that
[2:28:19.360 --> 2:28:22.880]  they had no sympathy for them and then they're putting that right that right
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:25.880]  control mode they're told that they're here to keep the peace and they're
[2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:29.480]  told this can be violent protesters and so they're kind of prime for that kind
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:33.760]  of behavior and then and then you know they go walk into the riot mode and they
[2:28:33.760 --> 2:28:37.840]  overreact and they and they you know it's like having a hammer all you
[2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:40.960]  have is a hammer and everything looks like a nail and so once you're in that
[2:28:40.960 --> 2:28:44.680]  riot mode it's hard to get him out of that well exactly you get macho men
[2:28:44.680 --> 2:28:49.160]  warriors who are designed to go charging into other men with swords and axes
[2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:53.240]  hacking each other that normal part of the brain kicks in but it's college kids
[2:28:53.240 --> 2:28:57.400]  they have a few hired anarchists throw a few things and then they go on a police
[2:28:57.400 --> 2:29:02.760]  rampage they are being psychologically manipulated exactly and that's why I
[2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:08.360]  mean like with Luke Rudowski's attempt to talk about the road it's necessary
[2:29:08.360 --> 2:29:11.360]  to do that but by that point it's oftentimes too late because they're
[2:29:11.360 --> 2:29:14.440]  walking to that mode you gotta reach them you gotta reach it before they get
[2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:18.400]  to that point and you gotta talk to them about how it's not proper to go from LA
[2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:22.400]  or wherever they're from and go to you know just go to the city and become
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:27.480]  nationalized that's the first line right there they shouldn't be doing that long
[2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:31.360]  segment coming up I want to speak about how they bring these swarms of police
[2:29:31.360 --> 2:29:36.360]  from all over the nation to New Orleans or to Pittsburgh or to other areas and
[2:29:36.360 --> 2:29:42.240]  then G20 private security in police uniforms grabbing citizens off the
[2:29:42.240 --> 2:29:46.240]  street into unmarked cars we'll get Stewart Rhodes take on that straight
[2:29:46.240 --> 2:29:57.440]  ahead we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[2:33:02.320 --> 2:33:26.120]  Stuart Rhodes is our guest your phone calls Ronnie Scott Karen Mark Bob and
[2:33:26.120 --> 2:33:31.840]  others are coming up here in just a few minutes. Stuart I was making the point as
[2:33:31.840 --> 2:33:37.080]  we went to break about how they're clearly turning the military and the
[2:33:37.080 --> 2:33:40.720]  police loose on the people they're clearly training them that it's macho
[2:33:40.720 --> 2:33:46.800]  and cool to do all of this that's why Oakkeepers is here to go out and reach
[2:33:46.800 --> 2:33:53.600]  out to them and also want to get your take just on all the other announcements
[2:33:53.600 --> 2:33:59.520]  we're seeing and all the different reports of urban warfare drills and the
[2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:04.520]  military coming out on the streets and running checkpoints. What are the
[2:34:04.520 --> 2:34:07.520]  military sources you have saying are they really starting to get upset about
[2:34:07.520 --> 2:34:13.800]  this? Excuse me if I can hear you. Are your military sources getting upset about
[2:34:13.800 --> 2:34:19.120]  the deployment of military forces on the streets? Oh you bet I mean here's the
[2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:22.740]  thing though the oath is being antidote it's a powerful as powerful as any
[2:34:22.740 --> 2:34:26.120]  conditioning that's been attempted on the military has been done to them I'm
[2:34:26.120 --> 2:34:29.600]  just going off a decade that was a whole I mean ever since the 90s that was a whole
[2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:33.960]  point of Lieutenant Commander Cunningham survey of the of the Marines
[2:34:33.960 --> 2:34:37.520]  between on Paul this was that he saw that a disturbing trend of conditioning
[2:34:37.520 --> 2:34:41.560]  the military to accept orders from foreign foreign officers and and to
[2:34:41.560 --> 2:34:45.520]  become involved in domestic domestic policing but those conditions have been
[2:34:45.520 --> 2:34:49.000]  going on for a long time but the antidote is to remind them that their oath to the
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:53.720]  Constitution and it's incredibly powerful the founders are no dummy they
[2:34:53.720 --> 2:34:56.560]  put it there for a good reason you remind them of their oath and all white
[2:34:56.560 --> 2:34:59.720]  bulk was off over their heads and they're like oh yeah what does that mean
[2:34:59.720 --> 2:35:03.120]  they mean because I have to read the Constitution to understand it and then
[2:35:03.120 --> 2:35:07.520]  once I understand what the laws but the lines are drawn I have to stand and so
[2:35:07.520 --> 2:35:11.720]  that's the thing that that's grabbing them and it's working and that's what we
[2:35:11.720 --> 2:35:21.960]  saw yeah you we're losing your phone or are you on a skype phone or voice over
[2:35:21.960 --> 2:35:31.560]  IP phone start yeah we might need to just cancel ever doing skype phone systems
[2:35:31.560 --> 2:35:38.880]  or it may be our system that's what ours is but we'll try to get him back on the
[2:35:38.880 --> 2:35:43.000]  show today that's why you obviously couldn't hear me earlier I also wanted
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  to talk about a story written last Thursday titled former White House
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:36:03.360]  speechwriters suggest military coup could oust Obama and this is being pushed
[2:36:10.760 --> 2:36:16.200]  that's why we need to become aware of what's being said what's being done
[2:36:16.200 --> 2:36:21.320]  because the establishment itself is talking about a military coup in America
[2:36:21.320 --> 2:36:27.480]  and normally when you have a military coup to get out of one tyranny it only
[2:36:27.480 --> 2:36:34.440]  creates another tyranny and the article is former White House speechwriters
[2:36:34.440 --> 2:36:39.680]  suggest military coup could oust Obama former White House speechwriter John L
[2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:44.040]  Perry has courted controversy by suggesting that the US military uphold
[2:36:44.040 --> 2:36:48.480]  their oath to defend the Constitution against enemies against domestic
[2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:53.760]  enemies could stage a bloodless coup to oust President Obama that continues the
[2:36:53.760 --> 2:36:58.760]  illusion that Barack Obama is running anything Barack Obama is a corporate
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:05.040]  lawyer who has proven himself to be one of the biggest puppets in modern
[2:37:05.040 --> 2:37:09.640]  history in any nation he reads off a teleprompter so it's always this
[2:37:09.640 --> 2:37:13.440]  illusion that it's Obama violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution it's and
[2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:17.160]  if we could just get rid of Obama everything would be okay no we've got
[2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:23.000]  to audit the Federal Reserve and then abolish it and arrest the bankers if you
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:28.360]  don't get rid of them things only get worse going back to Stuart Rhodes
[2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:32.400]  Stuart lost you there I was bringing up the article Paul Watson wrote about
[2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:37.480]  Newsmax's story with the former White House speechwriter John L Perry saying
[2:37:37.480 --> 2:37:41.920]  that in an article originally posted at Newsmax website Perry wrote there's a
[2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:45.760]  remote although gaining possibility America's military will intervene in a
[2:37:45.760 --> 2:37:49.960]  last resort to resolve the Obama problem don't dismiss it as unrealistic
[2:37:49.960 --> 2:37:54.200]  military intervention is what Obama exponentially accelerating agenda for
[2:37:54.200 --> 2:37:59.880]  fundamental change towards a Marxist state is inviting upon America a coup
[2:37:59.880 --> 2:38:05.240]  and it's not an ideal option but Obama's radical ideal is not acceptable or
[2:38:05.240 --> 2:38:11.800]  reversible writes Perry they're they're trying to spin these type of articles as
[2:38:11.800 --> 2:38:15.960]  if this is something oathkeepers wants one meanwhile it's former Bush people
[2:38:15.960 --> 2:38:20.640]  that are actually talking about this and doesn't that reinforce the myth that
[2:38:20.640 --> 2:38:26.640]  Obama actually runs anything when instead Ron Paul is running a counter coup
[2:38:26.640 --> 2:38:31.800]  with the in the Fed movement to remove the illegitimate corporate dictatorship
[2:38:31.800 --> 2:38:36.720]  that's who we need to be talking about kicking out but through legal parameters
[2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:41.400]  once we educate the public that they're a bunch of criminal can lay made-off
[2:38:41.400 --> 2:38:46.160]  types right what was in Newsmax article didn't mention up to be particular but
[2:38:46.160 --> 2:38:49.520]  here's a problem is that what it's proposing is false solution you don't
[2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:54.320]  violate the Constitution to save it and a military coup is wildly unconstitutional
[2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:59.600]  as anything any president could do and so that's not the way to go it's the
[2:38:59.600 --> 2:39:05.240]  people themselves if anyone's going to revolt or or overthrow a corrupt cabal
[2:39:05.240 --> 2:39:09.320]  in government is the people not the military and so that's that's what
[2:39:09.320 --> 2:39:13.400]  that's our answer to that is that there was to the Constitution and nowhere in
[2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:17.680]  the Constitution of the military is in general sunglasses authorized to get
[2:39:17.680 --> 2:39:22.280]  upon himself to scrap the civil government and assume military command of
[2:39:22.280 --> 2:39:25.760]  the country it doesn't exist and so we're writing a bottle to that piece
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:32.720]  it'll be absolutely in 1775 1776 for those that don't know they went and got
[2:39:32.720 --> 2:39:39.320]  the elected representatives of the 13 colonies to come and meet representing
[2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:44.560]  the people to then vote you don't have a guy with four stars or five stars with
[2:39:44.560 --> 2:39:48.760]  sunglasses on and I want to point out the nationals and you've written papers
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:53.280]  on this you can speak to it we've had jag officers on about it as well and I've
[2:39:53.280 --> 2:39:57.360]  studied it in depth we already have a military coup as Thomas Barnett writes
[2:39:57.360 --> 2:40:01.480]  but it's a good one they think we're the court global corporations now control
[2:40:01.480 --> 2:40:06.240]  our military to the National Security Council and so you don't replace one
[2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:10.080]  military coup with another military coup you point out how it's illegal and
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:15.120]  illegitimate and we remove the coup of the Federal Reserve well back to what you
[2:40:15.120 --> 2:40:17.960]  said about the founding generation we look at the definition of penance you
[2:40:17.960 --> 2:40:22.160]  don't see George Washington's name on there or any of his officers he didn't
[2:40:22.160 --> 2:40:25.560]  call the shots he was a humble servant if I can find out that every
[2:40:25.560 --> 2:40:30.720]  correspondent to Congress it the humble servant your humble servant so he put
[2:40:30.720 --> 2:40:34.760]  himself under the command of the civil leaders of the revolution and so that's
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:39.160]  where we have this policy model you don't have the military assume powers
[2:40:39.160 --> 2:40:43.440]  is from control so but you're right it's also it's also that if you were to do a
[2:40:43.440 --> 2:40:47.440]  military coup that could be falling right into the hands of the people who
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:51.040]  would love to trap the Constitution so they'd offer you this this one problem
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:54.360]  here and then they offer the solution and the full solution is a military coup
[2:40:54.360 --> 2:40:57.920]  and he wanted up going for the frying pan to the fire he still scrap the
[2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:01.120]  Constitution it's gone that's how you're dependent upon whoever happens to be the
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:08.440]  general in charge you know so that's not how it's done absolutely again Stuart
[2:41:08.440 --> 2:41:13.520]  Rhodes obviously in a busy office today as we speak with him I've thrown out a
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:18.520]  lot of issues I want to discuss and I've got some calls that I want to go to but
[2:41:18.520 --> 2:41:23.560]  you're gonna write a rebuttal to the article written by the former White
[2:41:23.560 --> 2:41:27.800]  House speechwriter John L Perry for Newsmax we love to publish that at
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:33.000]  info wars.com as soon as we get that Stuart Rhodes but but other issues that
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:38.240]  you're looking at right now the military what is their mood what are the police
[2:41:38.240 --> 2:41:41.640]  saying when you write these articles about the New World Order for SWAT
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:48.600]  magazine what are the paramilitary local police saying well overwhelmingly we we
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:51.840]  get a positive response of course we're getting the people who like our message
[2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:56.760]  most but but I think I think what a few people rank and file military and police
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:42:00.760]  are waking up and I've even heard through the grapevine that some there are some
[2:42:00.760 --> 2:42:04.760]  generals who are behind what we're doing are aware of those keepers and are in
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:10.200]  agreement and so you know it's all about waking them up to what's going on in a
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:15.440]  big picture and once they see it most of them are men of honor and and they'll be
[2:42:15.440 --> 2:42:19.240]  on our side and so that's that's why you shouldn't you shouldn't think folks
[2:42:19.240 --> 2:42:23.400]  should not think that oh they're all gonna follow orders they're all gonna do
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:27.760]  these things they're waking up now you know of course we get folks who prove
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:32.320]  right and after G20 and say what about that you know I can if you're all you
[2:42:32.320 --> 2:42:35.200]  know if you're all gonna keep your open why did that happen well because we have
[2:42:35.200 --> 2:42:38.320]  reached those officers yet you know it's we just started you got to give us a
[2:42:38.320 --> 2:42:41.440]  little bit of time so and you got to help but you got to help you know don't
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:45.720]  just don't just criticize us and say well that shows you're failing you know
[2:42:45.720 --> 2:42:51.080]  go out and reach them before they get to the G20 before they get to get
[2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:54.560]  nationalized and send someplace else across the country well sir we also
[2:42:54.560 --> 2:42:58.160]  know that and this has come out and go and tell pro documents from the 60s and
[2:42:58.160 --> 2:43:03.080]  70s it's come out with Hal Turner running around saying go after the feds
[2:43:03.080 --> 2:43:08.840]  when he wasn't the FBI admits worked for them that right that that there are
[2:43:08.840 --> 2:43:13.080]  people always calling for violence and always pushing violence and always
[2:43:13.080 --> 2:43:17.680]  saying we're wimps we're bad Ron Paul isn't doing enough Alex Jones isn't
[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:21.040]  doing enough Stuart Rose isn't doing enough a lot of those people it's
[2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:25.880]  turned out our operatives paid to be online and the call into radio to just
[2:43:25.880 --> 2:43:30.280]  get everyone dissenting instead of saying in less than a year look how far
[2:43:30.280 --> 2:43:35.040]  Oathkeepers is gone in the last few years look how the Ron Paul revolution's gone
[2:43:35.040 --> 2:43:40.240]  towards auditing the Fed identifying the real shadow government I mean we are we
[2:43:40.240 --> 2:43:45.600]  are having huge victories and this is basic military psychology where the
[2:43:45.600 --> 2:43:50.200]  establishment's telling us we're losing we have no hope oh you're pathetic or
[2:43:50.200 --> 2:43:54.760]  you're an agent you're an agent they're just doing all of this to get people to
[2:43:54.760 --> 2:44:00.400]  hesitate yeah well and also we have people who claim to be our side who just
[2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:05.080]  don't understand the Constitution I've had people that you know email and say
[2:44:05.080 --> 2:44:08.360]  when are you gonna have a military march on Washington to stop you know
[2:44:08.360 --> 2:44:12.400]  vaccination of children you know is that we have the authority to go do that
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:16.240]  you know the mess here's the thing that is that we are in a mess because the
[2:44:16.240 --> 2:44:20.480]  American people were stupid to switch for decades and it's none of the military
[2:44:20.480 --> 2:44:24.400]  and police to fix that folks out there are gonna have to get off the couch and
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:28.000]  go out and do it themselves well we need an asymmetrical approach if people will
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:32.560]  just put up flyers everywhere and hand out DVDs and go into every pharmacy and
[2:44:32.560 --> 2:44:36.960]  every school with the insert for the vaccine saying it causes gillian
[2:44:36.960 --> 2:44:41.720]  berets saying it causes brain damage saying it can sterilize you saying it
[2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:45.840]  can give you cancer it's on it if the average person would quit bitching at us
[2:44:45.840 --> 2:44:50.280]  for not doing enough and they would get up off their fat asses and I'm sorry to
[2:44:50.280 --> 2:44:53.840]  talk like that and get out there and engage the New World Order our problems
[2:44:53.840 --> 2:44:57.200]  will be over very quickly that's right well it's all it's all it's already
[2:44:57.200 --> 2:45:00.640]  working though you've got people now new nurses refusing the shot you've got
[2:45:00.640 --> 2:45:03.920]  people who are refusing it because they realize it's dangerous and that's
[2:45:03.920 --> 2:45:07.160]  because we have the internet they have you to you know have your show you know
[2:45:07.160 --> 2:45:10.960]  it's already helping but you're right the answer is they get out there and
[2:45:10.960 --> 2:45:15.400]  spread the message and help not to criticize you know you criticize me for
[2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:20.240]  not doing enough you know are you you're right but I'm telling you nine times out
[2:45:20.240 --> 2:45:25.360]  of ten we've tracked their IP addresses and stuff and test most these people
[2:45:25.360 --> 2:45:29.480]  are paid they're working for big foundations or they're working for the
[2:45:29.480 --> 2:45:33.120]  government the Pentagon admits they're on the web and they know how to get us
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:38.720]  fighting and their best way to operate is to pose as quote conspiracy theorist
[2:45:38.720 --> 2:45:42.360]  to get us in fighting with each other I mean it's right out of the Cointel
[2:45:42.360 --> 2:45:46.760]  pro playbook I saw Fred on daily coast in fact where we're one guy was saying
[2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:51.120]  that he was he was advising other readers there to go to conservative
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:55.080]  sites and pretend they're a conservative and then talk and then use racist
[2:45:55.080 --> 2:45:59.600]  language yeah no no they do it they've been caught
[2:46:00.080 --> 2:46:07.040]  yeah I mean you see these ridiculous comments like like yeah blacks are all
[2:46:07.040 --> 2:46:11.720]  scum and filth and then the person still leaves their handle and you go find
[2:46:11.720 --> 2:46:16.520]  their their MySpace account and it's a black guy and and you know he's a
[2:46:16.520 --> 2:46:23.480]  big Obama supporter you're absolutely right they're doing that how do we
[2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:29.600]  counter that how do we counter that type of of of deception well I think I
[2:46:29.600 --> 2:46:33.520]  think you know some lines the best and the best the best aspect you just to
[2:46:33.520 --> 2:46:37.720]  expose it like we're doing right now and and folks shouldn't buy into it they
[2:46:37.720 --> 2:46:41.360]  should look they should look with a journalist died anybody who's calling
[2:46:41.360 --> 2:46:44.280]  for violence I think that's a pick the age of revocateur out that's the old
[2:46:44.280 --> 2:46:49.400]  joke it's the guy who's trying to get you do something illegal yeah well they've
[2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:54.560]  caught agent revocateurs in Denver last year in Canada mainstream news admits the
[2:46:54.560 --> 2:47:00.000]  police go and attack their own police for the news cameras and then no one goes
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:04.960]  to jail shouldn't the commanders that gave those orders get in big trouble for
[2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:10.160]  ordering police to engage in false flag operations why I think so I think it's
[2:47:10.160 --> 2:47:15.560]  entrapment of very the very least you know but as we know it's been
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:19.080]  watered down but the rules have been but the lines have been blurred and watered
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:23.000]  down for so long we're gonna have to try to counteract that bit by bit an
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:27.760]  officer by officer in fact what the police commanders say when they get caught
[2:47:27.760 --> 2:47:32.560]  doing this from Canada to Australia to the United States England you name it
[2:47:32.560 --> 2:47:36.640]  Italy they got caught in Greece this year I'm sure you probably saw those
[2:47:36.640 --> 2:47:40.840]  newscasts were mainstream news admitted the police were dressed up as anarchists
[2:47:40.840 --> 2:47:46.080]  being ordered by police in alleyways it was caught on video to in uniform to go
[2:47:46.080 --> 2:47:51.920]  bash out windows of cars and businesses to demonize the mainline protesters and
[2:47:51.920 --> 2:47:56.640]  the police said oh that was just a drill and so now when they go attack other
[2:47:56.640 --> 2:48:01.360]  cops on camera for the news cameras so they can attack the peaceful crowd they
[2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:07.480]  go oh that was just a drill that was just an exercise right well I think they
[2:48:07.480 --> 2:48:11.280]  think the best thing you can do is that when you have it happening in a local
[2:48:11.280 --> 2:48:15.520]  police department it's time for a new chief of police and if the mayor won't
[2:48:15.520 --> 2:48:18.680]  do that but it's time to get rid of the mayor of the town you know kind of
[2:48:18.680 --> 2:48:22.280]  letting him out of office and it's also time to like to let the good Sheriff too
[2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:27.600]  so that's the best short-term remedy aside from from reaching out to
[2:48:27.600 --> 2:48:33.720]  individual officers is to be a corrupt official who's not not complying with
[2:48:33.720 --> 2:48:39.480]  the Constitution you need to go to a lot of office or have them have them can't
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:45.960]  Obama was this great savior he was invincible he was gonna save the earth
[2:48:45.960 --> 2:48:51.080]  and it doesn't matter if they make him head of the United Nations Security
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:55.840]  Council doesn't matter if they give him all these awards to be the Nobel Peace
[2:48:55.840 --> 2:49:00.000]  Prize winner it seems the whole world is starting to really get wise that Obama's
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:07.040]  a fraud well it's like the G20 you know that that's where you saw the puppet
[2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:11.040]  masters coming together and you know frankly everyone that protested 912 in
[2:49:11.040 --> 2:49:15.360]  DC should have been a G20 because that's that's his really cool in the
[2:49:15.360 --> 2:49:19.400]  strength you know that instead they went to the puppets so it's gonna take you
[2:49:19.400 --> 2:49:22.200]  know a little bit of time to wake people up and by course we're running out of
[2:49:22.200 --> 2:49:25.560]  time but the more they understand it doesn't make a difference to the office
[2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:28.600]  that we count this is what agenda they're pushing and they're pushing the
[2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:32.960]  same agenda doesn't make a difference but you notice at the better you notice
[2:49:32.960 --> 2:49:38.520]  at the DC event there wasn't as much security but when the real masters came
[2:49:38.520 --> 2:49:42.120]  into town in Pittsburgh it was off the charts in fact that was an earlier
[2:49:42.120 --> 2:49:46.800]  question I had for you that I forgot to get back to after the break steward did
[2:49:46.800 --> 2:49:52.400]  you see the videos of people dressed in army uniforms grabbing people protesters
[2:49:52.400 --> 2:49:56.480]  off the street and putting them in cars and driving away and then yes and then
[2:49:56.480 --> 2:50:00.920]  later the G20 came out and said those were our private security people well
[2:50:00.920 --> 2:50:04.560]  they said they're part of that multi-jurisditional security force I
[2:50:04.560 --> 2:50:10.040]  believe those are police officers yeah G20 said they were part of their private
[2:50:10.040 --> 2:50:14.440]  security force but but so their secret police I mean what do you think that was
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:20.080]  about well I mean what was it about to grab the guy off the street like that
[2:50:20.080 --> 2:50:24.200]  intimidation is what was one point if you black back someone off the street it
[2:50:24.200 --> 2:50:28.400]  makes everybody else on the street go wow I should be out here you know so but
[2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:33.000]  again I was in DC for the 912 protest and the contrast between that G20 is
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:36.720]  striking of course one problem is you have to have rock throwing you know so
[2:50:36.720 --> 2:50:40.600]  called anarchists at the G20 and that causes trouble for the other protesters
[2:50:40.600 --> 2:50:44.880]  but the answer of course for the police is to arrest the rockbearers not to not
[2:50:44.880 --> 2:50:49.760]  to pepper spray and sound can everybody exactly you got 10 foundation
[2:50:49.760 --> 2:50:56.520]  funded brats out there throwing rocks you go arrest them not the 2,000 peaceful
[2:50:56.520 --> 2:51:02.760]  people but the cops know that those guys work for them for thousands of years
[2:51:02.760 --> 2:51:06.400]  Native American healing has been practiced in North America the Native

[2:56:28.400 --> 2:56:33.760]  we received thank you sirs I'm honored to follow or concurrently we're with Mr.
[2:56:33.760 --> 2:56:39.920]  Rhodes of both keepers and because it's the I'm here now because I'm able to be
[2:56:39.920 --> 2:56:44.240]  here now because I'm in effect banned from today's Austin City Council which is
[2:56:44.240 --> 2:56:47.960]  totally counseled you countered our first amendment these flip-flip and power
[2:56:47.960 --> 2:56:52.040]  driven traders at City Hall but that's sorry other question or comment for Mr.
[2:56:52.040 --> 2:56:58.280]  Rhodes it was it's about Afghanistan in the blood of our troops overseas in
[2:56:58.280 --> 2:57:04.000]  their cops here at home and that is the Afghanis have have grown the supposed
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:07.600]  they supposedly most of the world's opium so our brave troops are now
[2:57:07.600 --> 2:57:11.840]  guarding those poppies so as to show our nation's collective preference for one
[2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:15.760]  group of illegal drug done for some other group of illegal drug bugs and that's
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:20.200]  kind of my comment but the comment is that of course that's our blood of our
[2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:24.600]  soldiers watering those crops but instead my suggestion is overnight Obama
[2:57:24.600 --> 2:57:30.200]  could really earn this Nobel Peace Prize by unilaterally defy first he'd have
[2:57:30.200 --> 2:57:34.400]  to defy a couple problematic treaties about drugs but by declaring absolute
[2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:38.960]  freedom for farmers right here at home think of it suddenly all illegal drug
[2:57:38.960 --> 2:57:43.440]  dogs worldwide will totally lose power and influence Ronnie Ronnie I hear you
[2:57:43.440 --> 2:57:46.360]  listen I'm gonna let you go because I wanted to go through the calls and go
[2:57:46.360 --> 2:57:50.600]  people that were for Stewart Rhodes okay not about legalizing hemp you know we
[2:57:50.600 --> 2:57:57.120]  talk about that all the time and I appreciate your call God help us let's
[2:57:57.120 --> 2:58:01.280]  talk to Scott in Arizona Scott you're on the air Alex Stewart thanks a lot
[2:58:01.280 --> 2:58:07.160]  good day to you by the way one quick insertion along with my question for
[2:58:07.160 --> 2:58:11.160]  Stewart you had a guy called earlier was asking about prevention for problem
[2:58:11.160 --> 2:58:14.680]  or if you've already had the flu shot Dr. Blaylock put out an article on what
[2:58:14.680 --> 2:58:18.480]  to do if you've received a shot so that guy can go look that up online I think
[2:58:18.480 --> 2:58:24.440]  even on Mercola also I have spoken to the chief of police here in our town
[2:58:24.440 --> 2:58:30.960]  and he he stated that yes he'd be open for receiving information such as a lot
[2:58:30.960 --> 2:58:38.480]  of the stuff that's been put on your side Alex regarding the flu he has
[2:58:38.480 --> 2:58:53.600]  got a break have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical
[2:58:53.600 --> 2:58:57.560]  power if so this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear
[2:58:57.560 --> 2:59:01.920]  solar power generators are now available from solutions from science and Thompson
[2:59:01.920 --> 2:59:05.720]  Illinois these emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power
[2:59:05.720 --> 2:59:09.960]  when you need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly
[2:59:09.960 --> 2:59:14.160]  emits no fumes and produces electricity for free it's like having an electric
[2:59:14.160 --> 2:59:18.640]  power plant running quietly in your own home run some pumps shortwave radios
[2:59:18.640 --> 2:59:22.880]  computers and even keep food from spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice
[2:59:22.880 --> 2:59:26.840]  storms brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to suffer through painful
[2:59:26.840 --> 2:59:31.440]  power outages again when the power goes out you'll be ready with a solar power
[2:59:31.440 --> 2:59:37.120]  generator from solution from science go to my solar backup calm and get off the
[2:59:37.120 --> 2:59:48.480]  grid today that's my solar backup calm or call 877-327-0365 877-327-0365
[2:59:48.480 --> 3:00:04.840]  don't wait call today waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[3:00:04.840 --> 3:00:10.520]  dr. Paul Craig Roberts is coming up former editor of Wall Street Journal
[3:00:10.520 --> 3:00:15.520]  former at a policy department treasure to talk about the death of the dollar what
[3:00:15.520 --> 3:00:19.120]  is really happening right now Stuart Rhodes founder of Oathkeepers is our
[3:00:19.120 --> 3:00:24.940]  guest and I'm attempting to take people's phone calls here for him Scott
[3:00:24.940 --> 3:00:29.920]  Arizona do you have a question for our guest yeah I do I would like for him to
[3:00:29.920 --> 3:00:34.880]  address possibly how to maybe take it a step further when it comes to the chief
[3:00:34.880 --> 3:00:38.280]  of police maybe even and also for whatever it's worth I know the chief of
[3:00:38.280 --> 3:00:43.120]  police here talks a lot with the head of the fire department too and how he
[3:00:43.120 --> 3:00:48.480]  might suggest some some in routes to bring more awareness regarding violations
[3:00:48.480 --> 3:00:53.560]  of the Constitution the flu issue and one last thing to add to that Alex I
[3:00:53.560 --> 3:00:56.600]  think this would be an excellent excellent way for people to get the
[3:00:56.600 --> 3:01:00.120]  word out whether it be coffee or DVDs to give them out or even do like the
[3:01:00.120 --> 3:01:04.840]  sherry 10 penny flyers I've handed them out at our school but the other thing is
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:10.160]  besides handing it out at your schools Halloween put a copy in every kid's
[3:01:10.160 --> 3:01:13.540]  basket and send it home and let the parents pick it out and read it and
[3:01:13.540 --> 3:01:18.080]  find it it's a national holiday we can expose this massively if people will go
[3:01:18.080 --> 3:01:21.440]  make the copies and put it in every single pumpkin that they get at their
[3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:25.520]  front door so but I've extrapolate if you would please a little further on the
[3:01:25.520 --> 3:01:28.640]  chief of police and they know talking to the chief police about I don't know
[3:01:28.640 --> 3:01:32.120]  they were handing pumpkins out of people's doors that kids dragging giant
[3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:37.680]  bags of pumpkins no I mean you can give them the you know the sugar candies or
[3:01:37.680 --> 3:01:42.280]  whatever and then with it have the candy folded up in a note a letter to them
[3:01:42.280 --> 3:01:46.400]  thanks for the call absolutely I mean if we do what Scott's talking about all of
[3:01:46.400 --> 3:01:50.560]  us to start interfacing with our fellow humans instead of just watching TV all
[3:01:50.560 --> 3:01:56.360]  day this tyranny will start dissipating absolutely and our website you can go
[3:01:56.360 --> 3:02:04.320]  and find free PDF downloads of our brochures and push cards and just print
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:08.640]  them up on your computer and hand them out and our DVD we're going to start
[3:02:08.640 --> 3:02:12.960]  selling our website too but but you can also go through $1 DVD project he'll
[3:02:12.960 --> 3:02:18.080]  hear the ultimate DVD you buy and burn it take a moment burn it copy it and send
[3:02:18.080 --> 3:02:21.920]  it out we don't care about you copy our stuff go for it and spread it around
[3:02:21.920 --> 3:02:24.960]  everywhere because we'll let them know about our keepers that's the best thing
[3:02:24.960 --> 3:02:28.680]  to do is get them to our website really read other officers talking to them
[3:02:28.680 --> 3:02:32.480]  face-to-face on our website you know in text and on video that's the best that's
[3:02:32.480 --> 3:02:36.160]  the strongest way but nothing to do in your local community is throw a big
[3:02:36.160 --> 3:02:40.360]  barbecue throw a party and buy it all local police all the local firefighters
[3:02:40.360 --> 3:02:44.800]  and all the veterans and get them to know each other and become friends that's
[3:02:44.800 --> 3:02:48.320]  the strongest thing you can do right now in your community is to make sure that
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:52.920]  you break down that wall separation between the veterans and the police and
[3:02:52.920 --> 3:02:57.800]  call it a tea party call it call it you know whatever name you want so it you
[3:02:57.800 --> 3:03:02.760]  know so it's what it is patriotic and main line call it you know veterans
[3:03:02.760 --> 3:03:06.640]  appreciation there whatever but invite the police and the firefighters to
[3:03:06.640 --> 3:03:11.480]  come together with the veterans you know call what you want yeah we're the real
[3:03:11.480 --> 3:03:15.640]  Patriots stop letting the offshore bankers and their little crooked groups
[3:03:15.640 --> 3:03:19.080]  like the Southern Prairie Law Center and others run around and say they're the
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:23.760]  Patriots and that because we're pro America we're the bad people no we're
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:29.600]  the real Americans and I go back to Ron Paul earlier this year at CPAC the big
[3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:34.920]  Republican Convention and Rush Limbaugh is the keynote speaker Ron Paul is one
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:39.480]  of the other key speakers and Ron Paul gets up and says Republicans are anti
[3:03:39.480 --> 3:03:44.760]  war this war is a fraud he got a standing ovation Republicans by and large
[3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:50.240]  aren't a bunch of warmongers either I mean that's the issue is we have to take
[3:03:50.240 --> 3:03:54.960]  America back right stop waiting for someone else to do it so you know in
[3:03:54.960 --> 3:03:59.880]  your own local community get up and do it go go do a big party in a local park
[3:03:59.880 --> 3:04:03.240]  you know starting to start some kind of event like that but the best way to do
[3:04:03.240 --> 3:04:07.680]  it I think is to is the first you get them together and and get them to
[3:04:07.680 --> 3:04:12.280]  understand that you're not doing any and and then after that start talking to
[3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:16.000]  them this amount of blue you know to an average cop up a new world order that's
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:20.320]  what I do it is that you know will the soft sell-up up front usually works better
[3:04:20.320 --> 3:04:25.120]  and well I found it's also good you know just the carpet bombing effect of this
[3:04:25.120 --> 3:04:30.640]  handing them DVDs you know just giving them to everybody the Obama deception
[3:04:30.640 --> 3:04:35.720]  in-game terror storm that can break their conditioning as well Stuart Rhodes
[3:04:35.720 --> 3:04:40.720]  keep it up my friend the establishment looks like fools trying to demonize you
[3:04:40.720 --> 3:04:47.960]  because your organization is absolutely just cut a hundred percent of the
[3:04:47.960 --> 3:04:52.880]  Constitution and Miller writes and we appreciate you and keep it up thank you

[3:08:03.880 --> 3:08:07.960]  they've run the system the whole economic system of the world for the
[3:08:07.960 --> 3:08:14.280]  last two and a half hundred years so why shouldn't they also run the economic
[3:08:14.280 --> 3:08:17.960]  system for the next few hundred years so is this some sort of a new world order
[3:08:17.960 --> 3:08:22.120]  which Gordon Brown kind of alluded to I think the new world order is emerging we
[3:08:22.120 --> 3:08:27.920]  have to stand up to preserve a republic here and a rule of law which is under
[3:08:27.920 --> 3:08:32.920]  dire threat for a couple of hours you could say mr. Obama was president of
[3:08:32.920 --> 3:08:37.760]  the world Obama's made it quite clear by his actions never mind his words his
[3:08:37.760 --> 3:08:44.240]  actions as to who owns them who he works for and who he serves and it's not the
[3:08:44.240 --> 3:08:49.720]  American people just as George W. Bush betrayed his foolish followers so must
[3:08:49.720 --> 3:08:55.360]  Obama because his only allegiance is to his offshore masters Summers tells Obama
[3:08:55.360 --> 3:09:00.800]  what to do Summers tells Geithner what to do so we had snow we had Paulson now
[3:09:00.800 --> 3:09:04.480]  we have Geithner all these people cut from the same bowl the cloth all you
[3:09:04.480 --> 3:09:08.320]  folks don't even realize that you're helping people that you're associated
[3:09:08.320 --> 3:09:16.680]  with and you should be recusing yourself I you know I behaved with the you don't
[3:09:16.680 --> 3:09:21.080]  think you should have recused yourself every time in history when a group of
[3:09:21.080 --> 3:09:25.320]  banks in conjunction with the government was given the power to expand the money
[3:09:25.320 --> 3:09:31.320]  supply at will those economic systems always collapse if they make a mistake
[3:09:31.320 --> 3:09:34.520]  they get bailed out if everyone else makes a mistake they get put in jail call
[3:09:34.520 --> 3:09:39.000]  the terrorists the tune of 23 trillion seven hundred billion dollars worth of
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:45.960]  taxpayer exposure for the bailouts is quite striking this is by probably an
[3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:52.760]  order of magnitude the biggest fraud in history why would you need international
[3:09:52.760 --> 3:09:57.640]  bankers why would any government agreed to use them it's nothing more than a
[3:09:57.640 --> 3:10:05.120]  private hostile corporate takeover of every sovereign nation on earth so for
[3:10:05.120 --> 3:10:10.240]  the first time in history we really have this new form of an empire fall of the

[3:10:48.040 --> 3:10:54.000]  and best film fall of the republic we are joined till 45 after by dr. Paul
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:58.440]  Craig Roberts former head of policy department of Treasury under Ronald
[3:10:58.440 --> 3:11:03.560]  Reagan best-selling author former Wall Street Journal editor and also a great
[3:11:03.560 --> 3:11:08.400]  patriot fighting just the corporate looting that's going on he's very
[3:11:08.400 --> 3:11:12.560]  critical of George W. Bush he hoped Obama would be better obviously he's now
[3:11:12.560 --> 3:11:16.840]  pointed out that Obama's already many cases surpassed the tyranny of George
[3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:20.840]  Bush now the outrage of Obama being given the peace prize he's actually sent
[3:11:20.840 --> 3:11:24.960]  tens of thousands more troops to Afghanistan continuing the torture of
[3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:29.200]  the secret arrest we'll talk about that the deterioration in the dollar where
[3:11:29.200 --> 3:11:34.200]  all of this is going is the headline correct in major newspapers that I read
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:40.600]  earlier saying that already government central banks are moving to the majority
[3:11:40.600 --> 3:11:45.280]  in buying euros and other currencies as the reserve we are joined by dr. Paul
[3:11:45.280 --> 3:11:51.160]  Craig Roberts doc it's good to have you here with us today hey Alex so much is
[3:11:51.160 --> 3:11:57.120]  happening let's get into obama and where he's going in the peace prize and your
[3:11:57.120 --> 3:12:06.520]  take on that well they gave the peace prize to a war monger didn't they this
[3:12:06.520 --> 3:12:15.000]  is the guy who started a new war in Pakistan and who has increased the war
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:24.320]  in Afghanistan in fact today there's a report on anti-war.com that he's told
[3:12:24.320 --> 3:12:31.920]  the British he was going to send in 45,000 more Americans and this was part
[3:12:31.920 --> 3:12:39.800]  of his guarantee to them to get them to send a few hundred more troops so you
[3:12:39.800 --> 3:12:45.120]  know it's the I wrote a column about it and said that it took longer than George
[3:12:45.120 --> 3:12:53.000]  Orwell Fault to reach his version of 1984 but we've now reached it we've given
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:59.480]  the peace prize to the war monger now the noble committee claims that well they
[3:12:59.480 --> 3:13:05.600]  did it they made a decision two weeks after his election because of his
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:14.120]  rhetoric he was seeing he was talking different from Bush and so they were
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:20.680]  hopeful they could somehow give him the peace prize and make it harder for him
[3:13:20.680 --> 3:13:28.760]  to be a war monger that could work but I think most likely all it's done is to
[3:13:28.760 --> 3:13:39.480]  make make the slogan that Orwell has in 1984 war is peace the reality for us so
[3:13:39.480 --> 3:13:44.320]  now war is peace but it has seemed to have blown up in the Nobel
[3:13:44.320 --> 3:13:50.520]  Committees face and making him the head on the rotating board of the UN
[3:13:50.520 --> 3:13:55.560]  Security Council trying to push him as this global peacemaker when clearly he's
[3:13:55.560 --> 3:14:01.800]  continuing the exact agenda that we had under George W. Bush I mean I think this
[3:14:01.800 --> 3:14:04.440]  is one of the straws that broke the camel's back and I've seen that the
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:08.640]  Nobel Committee as you mentioned is now starting to backtrack and apologize and
[3:14:08.640 --> 3:14:13.880]  I did hear on local radio news a national news feed Fox News was
[3:14:13.880 --> 3:14:19.200]  reporting that yes he's confirmed that he's gonna send 40 to 48,000 you you're
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:24.360]  seeing anti-war as 45,000 whatever it is over 40,000 he sent more than 25,000
[3:14:24.360 --> 3:14:31.200]  earlier he secretly sent 13,000 more that was confirmed and so he's he he took
[3:14:31.200 --> 3:14:38.440]  50,000 out of Iraq but then put 50,000 more contractors in and so I guess this
[3:14:38.440 --> 3:14:44.000]  gives new meaning to the word you know words over actions because we've got
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:49.640]  Code Pink now endorsing the war Huffington Post just endorsed more war and so now
[3:14:49.640 --> 3:14:57.880]  it's the liberal thing to do to go into the place that no army's ever defeated
[3:14:57.880 --> 3:15:06.280]  right and of course you know the the worst part about it is all the people
[3:15:06.280 --> 3:15:12.920]  there who'll be killed we seldom kill any of the of the fighters not that we
[3:15:12.920 --> 3:15:16.280]  have any right to kill them because we've invaded them they have done things
[3:15:16.280 --> 3:15:24.440]  like us but we mainly kill women and children and village elders and it's
[3:15:24.440 --> 3:15:32.120]  just sort of a crazed act of murder that's all it is like it was in Iraq you
[3:15:32.120 --> 3:15:37.360]  know if you count the displaced and the dead they lost the fifth of the
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:43.520]  population and allegedly we did this to benefit them well how do you benefit
[3:15:43.520 --> 3:15:49.240]  people when you bring nothing but death and destruction what is the agenda what
[3:15:49.240 --> 3:15:54.200]  is the agenda why are they expanding into Pakistan is it to encircle Iran and
[3:15:54.200 --> 3:15:59.000]  China is it to control the opium is it to keep them for weapons sales the
[3:15:59.000 --> 3:16:04.240]  unicol pipelines they even admit I saw CNN with a general admit it was a
[3:16:04.240 --> 3:16:09.680]  staged election I mean I mean I have to pinch myself every day what is the point
[3:16:09.680 --> 3:16:14.640]  more troops in Afghanistan means more targets those warlords are always
[3:16:14.640 --> 3:16:18.800]  fighting with each other over the opium money it's never going to end that
[3:16:18.800 --> 3:16:24.120]  place has been in war for two and two thousand three hundred years why are we
[3:16:24.120 --> 3:16:35.600]  there well I I can't say I know for sure we're there because of 9-11 which you
[3:16:35.600 --> 3:16:43.040]  and I regard as an inside job and that was an excuse to start a war there but
[3:16:43.040 --> 3:16:47.680]  they really weren't mainly interested in Afghanistan they wanted to invade Iraq
[3:16:47.680 --> 3:16:57.520]  and so it was kind of a beginning of a war that they could spread where they
[3:16:57.520 --> 3:17:03.200]  really wanted it now of course while we're staying there probably the
[3:17:03.200 --> 3:17:13.200]  Israelis want us involved if we pull out of Afghanistan then we might not attack
[3:17:13.200 --> 3:17:21.080]  Iran or we may pull out of Iraq the whole thing that they stirred up with the
[3:17:21.080 --> 3:17:26.600]  neoconservatives you know would simply pass away and be for naught so I think
[3:17:26.600 --> 3:17:30.880]  the Israelis want to keep us there and of course the military itself does
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:36.520]  because wartime is when you get the most rapid promotions officers get promoted
[3:17:36.520 --> 3:17:42.640]  rapidly they get when they retire they get much larger pensions the higher up
[3:17:42.640 --> 3:17:47.400]  they can get promoted the better the chances to be consultants to the defense
[3:17:47.400 --> 3:17:53.040]  industry is to the Pentagon itself and so it serves the for it serves the
[3:17:53.040 --> 3:17:58.840]  interest of the officer corps and of course the munitions makers the armaments
[3:17:58.840 --> 3:18:04.000]  industries they give tremendous political contributions and of course
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:09.880]  they're getting richer and richer from these ongoing wars and now we have
[3:18:09.880 --> 3:18:17.120]  my crystal over there saying that he needs 10 more years so that turns it
[3:18:17.120 --> 3:18:23.920]  into what a 18 19 year old war I mean a lot of people can get rich can get
[3:18:23.920 --> 3:18:31.800]  promoted can retired hire high pensions and and also you see the government it
[3:18:31.800 --> 3:18:39.680]  is a lot of momentum now and how do you back out how do you stop there's not
[3:18:39.680 --> 3:18:45.880]  they can't claim a victory they there's nothing they can claim they don't want to
[3:18:45.880 --> 3:18:51.160]  feed if Obama pulls out we know exactly of what the right wing crazies will do
[3:18:51.160 --> 3:18:57.000]  and the neocon they'll say see he's a Muslim he sold out the country to the
[3:18:57.000 --> 3:19:04.200]  Muslims he's he's turned Afghanistan back to Al Qaeda so all those just basic
[3:19:04.200 --> 3:19:10.320]  political things play in well wouldn't you make a serious to serious era like
[3:19:10.320 --> 3:19:18.600]  going in there you get so many interest groups and politics that it makes makes
[3:19:18.600 --> 3:19:29.760]  it hard to get out so I think probably we'll just expire there it's just gonna
[3:19:29.760 --> 3:19:34.960]  be continual occupation of Central Asia for the foreseeable future you're right
[3:19:34.960 --> 3:19:39.240]  they're talking about a decade more that's 18 years it's like Germany we've
[3:19:39.240 --> 3:19:46.160]  been there since 45 never leaving been in Korea for 50 years never leaving more
[3:19:46.160 --> 3:19:51.000]  than 50 years and we pay for it and meanwhile the weapons manufacturers
[3:19:51.000 --> 3:19:55.280]  make a bunch of money our troops get killed but generals get to pin more
[3:19:55.280 --> 3:19:59.200]  revenues on their chest we'll talk about the dollar and the death of the

[3:21:12.880 --> 3:21:17.400]  would like to see the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that
[3:21:17.400 --> 3:21:21.240]  Obama is working for the best interest of the American people while Obama's
[3:21:21.240 --> 3:21:25.920]  already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue
[3:21:25.920 --> 3:21:30.160]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:21:30.160 --> 3:21:35.320]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's
[3:21:35.320 --> 3:21:41.760]  fascist it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government this

[3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:36.640]  interviews just did one on 1360 a.m. in Dallas there is no doubt I'm the hardest
[3:24:36.640 --> 3:24:42.200]  working man radio and one of the hardest working writers and researchers out
[3:24:42.200 --> 3:24:45.780]  there Dr. Paul Craig Roberts always honored to have him we've got him in
[3:24:45.780 --> 3:24:48.880]  this segment the next is a short segment Dr. Roberts let's get into the dollar
[3:24:48.880 --> 3:24:53.400]  you know I got the New York Post saying dollar loses World Reserve status and
[3:24:53.400 --> 3:24:57.480]  then says chose the numbers that governments and central banks even our
[3:24:57.480 --> 3:25:02.120]  own central banks are converting away from the dollar being the main reserve
[3:25:02.120 --> 3:25:05.920]  though they're still buying treasuries at record pace and I kind of ignore the
[3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:10.080]  New York Post but then I see it in the Associated Press it appears the
[3:25:10.080 --> 3:25:14.600]  establishment is trying to kill the dollar while pushing us under the water
[3:25:14.600 --> 3:25:18.400]  saying oh I don't want to kill it here I'm going to push you under you're an
[3:25:18.400 --> 3:25:21.360]  expert on this I can't think of a better expert you know running the Treasury
[3:25:21.360 --> 3:25:26.480]  Department doing a great job when you did do it about where we're going in all
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:31.800]  of this the banks are reporting record profits on the bailout money Main Street
[3:25:31.800 --> 3:25:35.880]  is evaporating before our eyes and they're calling this a jobless recovery
[3:25:35.880 --> 3:25:41.400]  what is really going on Dr. Roberts okay well a whole bunch of things but first
[3:25:41.400 --> 3:25:46.200]  with the dollar what's going on is that since the spring you know like in the
[3:25:46.200 --> 3:25:52.280]  last six months it's been rapidly losing value and this is independent of any
[3:25:52.280 --> 3:26:01.720]  words that any central banker or or policymaker would say if you've heard if
[3:26:01.720 --> 3:26:08.960]  you ever heard of the Botswana Pula yes Pula is the currency of Botswana and
[3:26:08.960 --> 3:26:16.840]  in the last six months it has gained 14% in value against the dollar the
[3:26:16.840 --> 3:26:24.080]  currency of the hegemonic superpower did you know that the Brazil the real has
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:32.120]  gained 22% against the dollar or turn it around the dollar has followed 22%
[3:26:32.120 --> 3:26:41.360]  against the Brazilian current fallen 14% against the Botswana Pula fallen 11%
[3:26:41.360 --> 3:26:48.880]  against the Russian ruble and why is it this happening it it's happening because
[3:26:48.880 --> 3:26:57.400]  the accumulation of a massive trade deficits over so many years has flooded
[3:26:57.400 --> 3:27:04.080]  the world with dollar assets and now the world is confronted with very large
[3:27:04.080 --> 3:27:11.120]  massive federal budget deficits for this year for next year indeed the next 10
[3:27:11.120 --> 3:27:18.280]  years according to the latest CBO forecast and there's no way to finance
[3:27:18.280 --> 3:27:25.720]  those deficits in the past we've been asked that deficits by having our
[3:27:25.720 --> 3:27:33.600]  trading partners who earn trade services from our imports recycling the dollars
[3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:39.840]  to buy the treasury bonds but the deficits now are much larger than our
[3:27:39.840 --> 3:27:48.720]  trade deficit and so there's no source of financing we're getting some help the
[3:27:48.720 --> 3:27:54.080]  fact that all the money we gave to the banks and the bailout that some of this
[3:27:54.080 --> 3:28:00.880]  is being used to buy the treasury bonds but the world for the most part sees that
[3:28:00.880 --> 3:28:06.880]  the Federal Reserve is going to have to buy the bonds that means it has to
[3:28:06.880 --> 3:28:11.840]  monetize the day it has to take the treasury bonds and create checking
[3:28:11.840 --> 3:28:16.640]  accounts which is the hyperinflation in a nutshell where is it going I mean
[3:28:16.640 --> 3:28:20.080]  they've always talked about killing the dollar now they're talking about how it's
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:25.560]  dying I mean is this the beginning of the end is there any pulling out I don't
[3:28:25.560 --> 3:28:32.920]  I don't think they're going to be able to avoid the decline of the
[3:28:32.920 --> 3:28:38.080]  dollars value it's already happening you know I just look it's approaching a
[3:28:38.080 --> 3:28:44.800]  parody with the Swiss Frank Canadian dollar anytime the dollar loses 14%
[3:28:44.800 --> 3:28:51.760]  against the Botswana pooler you know that the writing is on the wall so I
[3:28:51.760 --> 3:29:01.000]  think what you know right now we're still undergoing deflation from the
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:07.680]  collapse of real estate values and commercial real estate values and and a
[3:29:07.680 --> 3:29:17.400]  lot of just failed small businesses and but you cannot monetize debt without
[3:29:17.400 --> 3:29:24.400]  the inflation rate turning up so I think next year we'll probably see the
[3:29:24.400 --> 3:29:33.400]  beginnings of inflation more pressure will come on the dollar because people
[3:29:33.400 --> 3:29:38.560]  will say hey I don't want to buy those bonds they're not paying anything they've
[3:29:38.560 --> 3:29:43.560]  got inflation and at some point the Fed is going to be really trapped you know
[3:29:43.560 --> 3:29:49.600]  how can they raise interest rates to attract dollars we got a break tell us
[3:29:49.600 --> 3:29:54.280]  about it when we get back this is key we're on the March the Empire's on the

[3:33:29.280 --> 3:33:36.560]  out listeners i'm in above my head the good news is i was in lax had police

[3:33:49.280 --> 3:33:56.960]  and i'm just one little gauge weather vane and all of this and i'm i'm getting
[3:33:56.960 --> 3:34:01.680]  so much coverage and so much attention that it's quite humbling actually i'm
[3:34:01.680 --> 3:34:05.360]  going to be honest i don't like it i like having an effect against the
[3:34:05.360 --> 3:34:10.800]  the globalist but the responsibility and i'm not cracking under it i'm just
[3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:16.000]  trying to grow up a little bit because i mean i never intended to be you know
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:20.960]  globally getting as big as ron paul it's very very humbling and and and then
[3:34:20.960 --> 3:34:26.240]  i'm trying to make sure i'm accurate i do a good job but i guess and what i'm
[3:34:26.240 --> 3:34:28.640]  saying here and i want dr roberts comment on this we'll get back into the
[3:34:28.640 --> 3:34:32.000]  dollar is people are waking up everywhere
[3:34:32.000 --> 3:34:35.120]  i'm on a bunch of big european radio stations today
[3:34:35.120 --> 3:34:38.880]  us radio stations hundreds of interviews coming in a week i can't even do
[3:34:38.880 --> 3:34:42.960]  a tenth of them i know dr roberts is in demand everywhere
[3:34:42.960 --> 3:34:49.920]  i know he's seeing a big awakening but at the same time it doesn't matter if
[3:34:49.920 --> 3:34:53.520]  everybody's waking up to a certain extent the establishment
[3:34:53.520 --> 3:34:57.040]  is going hell bent for leather and are committed and no matter what
[3:34:57.040 --> 3:34:59.680]  there looks like they're going to kill the dollar as he said it's already
[3:34:59.680 --> 3:35:02.960]  happening this folks do you know what this what this
[3:35:02.960 --> 3:35:07.360]  is going to look like when not just we have inflation but
[3:35:07.360 --> 3:35:10.880]  we can't buy foreign goods anymore because nobody wants our cruddy dollars
[3:35:10.880 --> 3:35:14.160]  and we don't have any industry left and we got a police state
[3:35:14.160 --> 3:35:19.120]  arrogantly stomping around dr roberts i'm ranting here but but i mean can you
[3:35:19.120 --> 3:35:21.760]  extract something from what i've said and give me your take on it i mean i'm
[3:35:21.760 --> 3:35:25.920]  just i'm getting to the point where i feel overwhelmed
[3:35:25.920 --> 3:35:29.120]  yeah well all those the things you mentioned earlier
[3:35:29.120 --> 3:35:33.440]  all the paths were going down i think uh...
[3:35:33.440 --> 3:35:37.200]  they're going to get to a neck you know in this next year
[3:35:37.200 --> 3:35:40.480]  something is going to happen to push up interest rates
[3:35:40.480 --> 3:35:44.320]  uh... either domestic inflation from
[3:35:44.320 --> 3:35:51.520]  from money creation or the inability of the of the treasury to borrow
[3:35:51.520 --> 3:35:59.680]  at these extremely low interest rates and when that happens then
[3:35:59.680 --> 3:36:04.080]  the economy which is already suffering despite practically zero interest
[3:36:04.080 --> 3:36:08.960]  rates will suffer more and the unemployment rate
[3:36:08.960 --> 3:36:14.240]  measured the way it was measured when i was in the treasuries now 21 percent
[3:36:14.240 --> 3:36:17.600]  so it can go a lot higher in the meantime
[3:36:17.600 --> 3:36:22.640]  the corporations are continuing to offshore jobs they're continuing to
[3:36:22.640 --> 3:36:28.560]  bring in partners on work pieces and the high rates of legal immigration
[3:36:28.560 --> 3:36:31.280]  continue so that there are more and more
[3:36:31.280 --> 3:36:38.400]  people competing for fewer jobs so this has to bring even more
[3:36:38.400 --> 3:36:42.160]  pressure on the on the american people and
[3:36:42.160 --> 3:36:47.840]  and uh they're already suffering look you see
[3:36:47.840 --> 3:36:51.920]  today or yesterday it was reported that the
[3:36:51.920 --> 3:36:55.520]  investment banks are making so much money they're back to those massive
[3:36:55.520 --> 3:37:00.400]  bonuses and it says that goldman sax
[3:37:00.400 --> 3:37:06.720]  is going to give an average payout of five hundred thousand
[3:37:06.720 --> 3:37:10.880]  pounds british pounds that's eight hundred thousand dollars
[3:37:10.880 --> 3:37:14.880]  to each of its five thousand and five hundred
[3:37:14.880 --> 3:37:21.120]  london staff the senior executives are going to get bonuses of several
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:27.040]  million pounds and the top ones ten million pounds that's 16 million
[3:37:27.040 --> 3:37:30.560]  dollars so they're paying out these kinds of bonuses
[3:37:30.560 --> 3:37:34.000]  while new york city for example now has
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:39.200]  reckoned homelessness six with sixteen thousand kids and homeless
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:45.840]  shelters it's so bad the city is giving free one-way airline tickets
[3:37:45.840 --> 3:37:49.280]  trying to get the homeless to fly out the city
[3:37:49.280 --> 3:37:53.360]  detroit is completely collapsing detroit
[3:37:53.360 --> 3:37:58.160]  um but look here here is the telltale sign new york's
[3:37:58.160 --> 3:38:02.320]  fifth avenue one of the most famous shopping
[3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:06.080]  mechas in the world it's now got a 15.3 percent
[3:38:06.080 --> 3:38:12.080]  vacancy rate on fifth avenue in prime commercial
[3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:18.640]  real estate um john williams reported today that when you
[3:38:18.640 --> 3:38:22.160]  look at retail sales adjusted for inflation
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:26.160]  currently they are at the level of 10 years ago
[3:38:26.160 --> 3:38:33.600]  he says that 10 years worth of retail sales growth has been destroyed
[3:38:33.600 --> 3:38:37.200]  and he you know and i agree with him that this
[3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:41.600]  this the crisis is just starting it's not really even
[3:38:41.600 --> 3:38:45.120]  well on the way and that's the question for you sir
[3:38:45.120 --> 3:38:48.160]  so the slide you're saying and everybody else is now saying
[3:38:48.160 --> 3:38:51.360]  you were talking about dollar in trouble three years ago they weren't now it's
[3:38:51.360 --> 3:38:54.720]  mainstream news is it a slow slide into third world
[3:38:54.720 --> 3:38:59.920]  oblivion or is or is it going to come
[3:38:59.920 --> 3:39:02.720]  quicker and what are the people going to do
[3:39:02.720 --> 3:39:07.920]  as new york state has passed 84 new taxes i was reading last week
[3:39:07.920 --> 3:39:12.400]  in the last year uh the government just keeps growing the government keeps
[3:39:12.400 --> 3:39:16.160]  adding people uh everybody i know is having
[3:39:16.160 --> 3:39:19.920]  really you know seeing cuts in pay or losing their jobs
[3:39:19.920 --> 3:39:23.280]  and the media is saying the economy's recovered i mean it
[3:39:23.280 --> 3:39:28.960]  where is this going well you know we don't have you know
[3:39:28.960 --> 3:39:32.480]  as well as i do we don't have a media the media serves as the ministry of
[3:39:32.480 --> 3:39:36.480]  truth or the ministry of propaganda you know and
[3:39:36.480 --> 3:39:40.960]  whatever it says is is unbelievable
[3:39:42.640 --> 3:39:47.440]  other than the trouble of the dollar which is in over supply
[3:39:47.440 --> 3:39:52.880]  we have another amazing fact and that is for all of this decade they kept the
[3:39:52.880 --> 3:39:57.600]  economy going by growing consumer debt we've talked about this before well
[3:39:57.600 --> 3:40:01.040]  now the consumers are all drowning in debt
[3:40:01.040 --> 3:40:07.520]  and they can't take on anymore so there's no way to expand consumer spending
[3:40:07.520 --> 3:40:13.040]  you know in the old days consumer spending grew with the productivity of
[3:40:13.040 --> 3:40:17.760]  the workforce so we still had industry and jobs here
[3:40:17.760 --> 3:40:21.440]  so people would be more productive their real incomes would go up they could
[3:40:21.440 --> 3:40:24.400]  spend more that was the source of economic growth
[3:40:24.400 --> 3:40:27.600]  for all the 21st century the source of growth was
[3:40:27.600 --> 3:40:31.920]  driving the consumers deeper into debt so they would borrow the money
[3:40:31.920 --> 3:40:35.920]  to keep the spending going they would max out the credit cards they
[3:40:35.920 --> 3:40:39.520]  they took out home equity loans and spent the equity
[3:40:39.520 --> 3:40:44.160]  and now that stopped so there's no way to get the consumer
[3:40:44.160 --> 3:40:49.040]  economy going except for the bankers who are going to get these huge bonuses
[3:40:49.040 --> 3:40:56.240]  of course the armaments industries but except the super rich
[3:40:56.240 --> 3:41:01.040]  the americans don't have any income growth that's right we now have their
[3:41:01.040 --> 3:41:05.520]  face like you said with more taxes because the
[3:41:05.520 --> 3:41:09.360]  states are broke the counties are broke the cities are broke
[3:41:09.360 --> 3:41:14.720]  and the federal government is broke so they're going to be forced
[3:41:14.720 --> 3:41:19.360]  into lower standards of living and it's going to be
[3:41:19.360 --> 3:41:24.000]  really hard on the very poor but it's going to be hard on everybody and i
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:27.680]  don't know whether it'll radicalize the people or whether
[3:41:27.680 --> 3:41:31.440]  there's the government will succeed in blaming
[3:41:31.440 --> 3:41:37.440]  al-qaeda or terrorist or iranians or russians or whoever
[3:41:37.440 --> 3:41:43.040]  i don't know what what capacity the people have to
[3:41:43.040 --> 3:41:46.880]  realize what's being done to them well that was my next question
[3:41:46.880 --> 3:41:50.880]  is the media is now saying iran is killing the dollar i'm sure you've seen
[3:41:50.880 --> 3:41:53.920]  that i mean you just mentioned it and they're saying the russians and chinese
[3:41:53.920 --> 3:41:56.320]  are doing it but i read what the russians and chinese
[3:41:56.320 --> 3:42:00.480]  and and and the arabs are saying and the persians are saying they're going look
[3:42:00.480 --> 3:42:03.520]  all these countries we keep buying your dollars
[3:42:03.520 --> 3:42:08.160]  we're losing 10 on this in the last year your central banks are
[3:42:08.160 --> 3:42:10.960]  have engaged in the policies that are doing this
[3:42:10.960 --> 3:42:15.200]  please stop and then meanwhile the federal reserve comes out and blames
[3:42:15.200 --> 3:42:18.320]  them when when they're the very grip doing it
[3:42:18.320 --> 3:42:21.520]  right see i don't think anybody's trying to kill the dollar
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:26.400]  on purpose i think the dollar is being killed because of the hubris and
[3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:31.360]  stupidity of the american policy makers and the rest of the world sits there
[3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:34.800]  watches this and says well look they're going to kill it
[3:42:34.800 --> 3:42:38.240]  they won't listen there's nothing we can do so let's be prepared and have
[3:42:38.240 --> 3:42:43.840]  something to use when they succeed in through hubris and stupidity in
[3:42:43.840 --> 3:42:47.360]  killing the currency and exactly that's what they're saying they're saying
[3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:51.280]  when america goes down it's going to be like a hydrogen bomb
[3:42:51.280 --> 3:42:54.880]  devastating all the other economies it's just we're going to be in the middle of
[3:42:54.880 --> 3:42:58.800]  the smoldering crater in the worst position doctor what what will this
[3:42:58.800 --> 3:43:01.760]  look like being a top economist we're one of the top
[3:43:01.760 --> 3:43:05.200]  economists out there in the world recognized i mean we've seen this in
[3:43:05.200 --> 3:43:09.840]  other countries other permutations what's the best guess timeline on where
[3:43:09.840 --> 3:43:13.040]  this is going because you know two years ago you hope they would pull out
[3:43:13.040 --> 3:43:16.560]  they're clearly it looks like you're saying aren't going to so what's the
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:19.360]  trajectory and and what do you expect us to look like
[3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:23.760]  in two years well i think it's going to be the hardest on the americans
[3:43:23.760 --> 3:43:27.280]  because as you said we wouldn't we won't be able to pay for the imports and we
[3:43:27.280 --> 3:43:30.880]  are very import dependent not just on energy but on
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:34.560]  manufactured goods and advanced technology products
[3:43:34.560 --> 3:43:38.400]  and if you can't pay for your energy imports
[3:43:38.400 --> 3:43:43.440]  then that disrupts food deliveries and people's ability to get to the jobs you
[3:43:43.440 --> 3:43:47.920]  know we have this sort of urban suburban
[3:43:47.920 --> 3:43:53.680]  culture where people drive for an hour one way to jobs and back and
[3:43:53.680 --> 3:43:57.520]  so it's all kinds of problems are brewing there i think
[3:43:57.520 --> 3:44:01.760]  it's not it won't be all that terrible for other countries
[3:44:01.760 --> 3:44:05.920]  uh china of course may lose a lot of its uh
[3:44:05.920 --> 3:44:09.840]  the value of a lot of its foreign exchange reserves which are in dollars
[3:44:09.840 --> 3:44:13.760]  but i don't know that that will particularly hurt them because they've
[3:44:13.760 --> 3:44:18.320]  got the technology they've got the industry they
[3:44:18.320 --> 3:44:24.160]  the paper isn't that important and so you may know that robert fisk reported
[3:44:24.160 --> 3:44:29.040]  from lebanon last week that china russia
[3:44:29.040 --> 3:44:35.520]  including japan and france and the uh and the gulf arab oil
[3:44:35.520 --> 3:44:43.280]  interest are already devising a substitute for the dollar
[3:44:43.280 --> 3:44:49.760]  when it goes now when it goes no one really knows this gives a
[3:44:49.760 --> 3:44:54.560]  timeline of nine years i myself don't see how the dollar
[3:44:54.560 --> 3:45:00.480]  could possibly survive his world reserve currency for nine more years
[3:45:00.480 --> 3:45:05.600]  and so i think well what is going to happen
[3:45:05.600 --> 3:45:09.040]  when the dollar loses its status it's going to
[3:45:09.040 --> 3:45:15.200]  put a break on the ability of united states to conduct wars
[3:45:15.200 --> 3:45:23.760]  and so we may actually get some peace uh as a payoff from the collapse of the
[3:45:23.760 --> 3:45:27.520]  dollar because american power will collapse with it
[3:45:27.520 --> 3:45:31.120]  and i think that's what the rest of the world sees
[3:45:31.120 --> 3:45:37.600]  and i think that's why they're not particularly disturbed
[3:45:37.600 --> 3:45:42.000]  by the by the decline of the dollar because they
[3:45:42.000 --> 3:45:45.440]  what they are disturbed by is the american
[3:45:45.440 --> 3:45:49.680]  way of being a bully of being hegemonic of
[3:45:49.680 --> 3:45:56.240]  ordering people around of purchasing the leaders of foreign countries so that
[3:45:56.240 --> 3:46:00.560]  the leaders represent us rather than their own people
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:05.120]  and the people are tired of that you know all the threats that we are always
[3:46:05.120 --> 3:46:09.680]  ishrink to everybody not just to Iran but to everybody
[3:46:09.680 --> 3:46:12.960]  well look at how they're trying to use the military look at the g20 look at
[3:46:12.960 --> 3:46:17.920]  how they're openly deploying now the pentagon wants 379,000 troops
[3:46:17.920 --> 3:46:21.280]  domestically and and in closing here doctor i want to
[3:46:21.280 --> 3:46:25.600]  say bye to you in the break because i have a question for you off air
[3:46:25.600 --> 3:46:28.720]  the establishment is certainly is full of hubris the private banking
[3:46:28.720 --> 3:46:33.520]  establishment running all these Ponzi schemes but at the same time they're
[3:46:33.520 --> 3:46:37.280]  gearing up the prisons they're telling local police get ready for riots
[3:46:37.280 --> 3:46:39.520]  they've been doing this the last couple years they're
[3:46:39.520 --> 3:46:43.680]  clearly getting the infrastructure ready for the implosion in the united
[3:46:43.680 --> 3:46:48.080]  states so i think that shows there's a method to the madness
[3:46:48.080 --> 3:46:51.680]  and that they've got some tricks up their sleeves as the rand corporation
[3:46:51.680 --> 3:46:55.680]  documents said last year start a big new world war
[3:46:55.680 --> 3:47:00.320]  uh somehow they've got a trick the anglo-american establishment
[3:47:00.320 --> 3:47:04.800]  uh ally with israel has tricks up their sleeves
[3:47:04.800 --> 3:47:08.640]  and it looks like that's going to be war or giant false flags
[3:47:08.640 --> 3:47:13.600]  your take on that well i know the only way they can have war is the foreigners
[3:47:13.600 --> 3:47:17.120]  have to finance it we can't finance it with no money
[3:47:17.120 --> 3:47:22.480]  i mean the the current budget is 50 percent in the red
[3:47:22.480 --> 3:47:27.840]  so i think you know i i i i do agree with you that uh
[3:47:27.840 --> 3:47:31.040]  they've got SWAT teams everywhere domestically
[3:47:31.040 --> 3:47:34.640]  i see them even in these small mountain towns in north georgia they
[3:47:34.640 --> 3:47:38.320]  they've got SWAT teams which they don't need for any
[3:47:38.320 --> 3:47:42.160]  real reason and so i do think they expect
[3:47:42.160 --> 3:47:47.200]  that uh things are going to get rough for them and you know
[3:47:47.200 --> 3:47:52.960]  gerald salante and others are predicting that they're going to be rods
[3:47:52.960 --> 3:47:58.960]  and there's going to be a revolution and i think if the unemployment continues
[3:47:58.960 --> 3:48:05.120]  to rise uh which i think it will do next year
[3:48:05.120 --> 3:48:10.240]  there's going to be a lot of unrest and and
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:14.640]  gangs and looting because people are going to be so hard pressed
[3:48:14.640 --> 3:48:19.760]  you know in the old days the depression
[3:48:19.760 --> 3:48:22.960]  when people lost their jobs prices were falling
[3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:27.360]  it's different if you lose your job prices are rising
[3:48:27.360 --> 3:48:32.960]  and so i think they've managed to fix a situation create situation that's
[3:48:32.960 --> 3:48:39.280]  too big for them to handle and i'm not sure they can handle
[3:48:39.280 --> 3:48:42.160]  the american population look just remember they could not
[3:48:42.160 --> 3:48:47.280]  successively occupy back that
[3:48:47.280 --> 3:48:51.840]  united states is a big place it's a lot bigger than half that
[3:48:51.840 --> 3:48:54.880]  that's why they're trying to recruit the boy scouts and girl scouts to spy on
[3:48:54.880 --> 3:48:57.840]  people right now but i agree it it's not going to go well
[3:48:57.840 --> 3:49:02.400]  and it's a disaster in the may it's like watching a train wreck as it's starting
[3:49:02.400 --> 3:49:06.000]  and we're watching it derail and cars are flipping over and people are flying
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:09.840]  out and the general public's still in a trance i think a lot of them are
[3:49:09.840 --> 3:49:12.960]  starting to wake up as i talked about earlier uh
[3:49:12.960 --> 3:49:16.640]  but people are waking up but they don't know what to do and i don't know what to
[3:49:16.640 --> 3:49:20.400]  do because we know who the what the establishment's done
[3:49:20.400 --> 3:49:25.600]  we know what they're setting up and they don't care they're just committed
[3:49:25.600 --> 3:49:29.120]  and they're doing it and they're wrecking all our futures
[3:49:29.120 --> 3:49:32.640]  right in front of us and i think like ron paul has said we just got to
[3:49:32.640 --> 3:49:37.680]  identify who did it so that they don't use this crisis to get even more power
[3:49:37.680 --> 3:49:41.920]  and then hopefully this crisis like a fever will will will will get rid of
[3:49:41.920 --> 3:49:44.640]  this disease and then we can rebuild our country
[3:49:44.640 --> 3:49:48.880]  kind of like after the collapse of russia your final comment on that doctor
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:53.120]  well it could well be we'll find ourselves ruled by the imf we'll be under
[3:49:53.120 --> 3:49:59.040]  an imf austerity plan forcing us to balance our exports
[3:49:59.040 --> 3:50:04.320]  imports forcing us to balance our budget the sort of thing that we've done
[3:50:04.320 --> 3:50:09.760]  to uh lesser developed countries for decades so this may be
[3:50:09.760 --> 3:50:13.760]  what we face in the future the world may say we've had enough of you and your
[3:50:13.760 --> 3:50:17.600]  stupidity and all the trouble you cause a good body and now
[3:50:17.600 --> 3:50:24.640]  you're going to do as we say or you're not going to have any gas nor
[3:50:24.640 --> 3:50:29.200]  so that may be our future when they may put us into the box
[3:50:29.200 --> 3:50:32.400]  that we belong in
[3:50:33.200 --> 3:50:38.880]  wow um he's the best-selling author of tell us about the newest version of

[3:52:05.680 --> 3:52:10.160]  barack obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give them a stake

[3:52:14.400 --> 3:52:19.040]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the
[3:52:19.040 --> 3:52:22.880]  best interest of the american people well obama's already fudging
[3:52:22.880 --> 3:52:27.440]  yeah fudge since d1 in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical
[3:52:27.440 --> 3:52:32.320]  mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of
[3:52:32.320 --> 3:52:38.480]  extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[3:52:38.480 --> 3:52:42.080]  it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government
[3:52:42.080 --> 3:52:47.040]  this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told
