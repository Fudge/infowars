[00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:14.205]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.167]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:28.498]  So it's Thanksgiving and I wanted to be here to talk to all of you about Thanksgiving.
[00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:31.701]  I'm thankful for this planet.
[00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:33.042]  I'm thankful for consciousness.
[00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:41.642]  But I'm most thankful, the God creator of everything, and the fact that we exist.
[00:00:41.642 --> 00:01:01.092]  And the moment we realize that we're part of that giant, eternal compendium, and the chapters that come that we'll write together, because the only thing an omnipresent God can do, that's original, is to create new beings that have free will.
[00:01:01.092 --> 00:01:02.613]  And that's what's happened.
[00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:10.610]  We're God's children, and we're away from home.
[00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:20.273]  Put down here, in deep space, in these avatar bodies, to decide what we're gonna do.
[00:01:20.273 --> 00:01:31.657]  And once you are broken with the enemy, once the spell is over, you look at Hollywood, you look at all these corrupt cultures, and you think, that is horrible!
[00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:34.398]  Why did I ever even think that was interesting?
[00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:38.570]  Even though there's some good movies, it ruins it, you know?
[00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.932]  You're like, this came out of a mother that's really bad.
[00:01:41.932 --> 00:01:50.516]  And even though she's had a billion children, my God, all of it's tainted.
[00:01:50.516 --> 00:02:02.121]  So, on Thanksgiving, I think we ought to get down on our knees before God and thank God for our consciousness, our potential for free will, because that could be stolen.
[00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.262]  And just for the kinship we have,
[00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:20.050]  No matter what color you are, where you came from, if you believe in God, and you believe in justice, and you understand that you're very thankful for all those ancestors that came before you.
[00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.171]  I've talked about this a lot, but this is really the big secret.
[00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:29.392]  Time travel's real.
[00:02:29.392 --> 00:02:31.613]  But time travel doesn't happen the way you think it does.
[00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:39.669]  We're getting some machine that spins around, you go way out in the future, you go back in the past.
[00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:51.060]  Time travel is the fact that genetically, however long humans go back, wherever we came from, and I've got more than an idea, but that's not a book that's meant to be open at this time.
[00:02:52.788 --> 00:03:01.558]  You are genetically and energetically and electricity wise and bodily, every mother, every father, you had a connection to them.
[00:03:01.558 --> 00:03:02.919]  It's like electricity.
[00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:09.447]  It's connected each person to each person back, all their dreams, all their hopes, their sins.
[00:03:11.581 --> 00:03:12.582]  They're good deeds.
[00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:16.524]  All of it is transmitted energetically into the future.
[00:03:16.524 --> 00:03:28.530]  So whether our ancestors originated on another planet, another dimension a trillion years ago, or whether we've been here like twisted Bible verses that people take out of context, say 6,000 years, it doesn't matter.
[00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.473]  We are leaping into the future with all of our ancestors and all their hopes and dreams.
[00:03:33.473 --> 00:03:38.256]  And as long as we continue on with that pure vision,
[00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:41.983]  We are unextinguishable.
[00:03:41.983 --> 00:03:43.724]  We live forever.
[00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:46.666]  And that's only one level of it.
[00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:52.329]  Each individual soul, obviously, then that meets with God goes up to a whole other dimension.
[00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.831]  But everything is multifaceted in the universe.
[00:03:54.831 --> 00:04:07.559]  So at this level, there's the genetic code and the experience we have and the genetic inter-dimensional spiritual broadcast that is imprinted on the trails we leave.
[00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:10.638]  And that itself is a consciousness.
[00:04:10.638 --> 00:04:12.920]  Think about how magic God is, how cool that is.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.706]  Like, every level is its own consciousness, and we move on to the next level, but God doesn't cheat people.
[00:04:20.706 --> 00:04:29.032]  He leaves behind the good stuff for everybody to then experience their consciousness, and what they went through, if you'll just dial into it through free will.
[00:04:29.032 --> 00:04:31.194]  There's already been maps made.
[00:04:31.194 --> 00:04:33.136]  They're all waiting for you.
[00:04:33.136 --> 00:04:33.816]  Our ancestors 5,000 years ago.
[00:04:35.618 --> 00:04:36.980]  All of them are waiting.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:45.849]  And they wrote on the cave walls, because they loved you, and they knew who you were, and they wanted you to see them, and they wanted to be with you forever.
[00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.052]  And that's what the Satanists are trying to block.
[00:04:48.052 --> 00:04:53.137]  So I give Thanksgiving for God, for Jesus, for my ancestors, and for all of you on Thanksgiving.
[00:04:53.137 --> 00:04:56.381]  And I just hope this ship, Earth, goes to the next level.

[00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.150]  My pests.
[00:06:03.846 --> 00:06:09.749]  My calling, my name is Maxine.
[00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:14.771]  I grew up a black woman in a racist, sexist city.
[00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:21.254]  But despite the odds being against me, I made it.
[00:06:21.254 --> 00:06:24.175]  I have a right to my anger.
[00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.597]  I call it rebellion.
[00:06:42.123 --> 00:06:59.632]  The disproportionate numbers of black males that are in prisons around this country are in prisons because they don't have the wealth by which to get fancy lawyers who will go in and ensure that they buy justice for them as white folks can do in America.
[00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:01.052]  This is punishment.
[00:07:01.052 --> 00:07:06.334]  This is being very harsh on the most vulnerable people in our society.
[00:07:06.334 --> 00:07:14.216]  To include liquor stores in this group of stores that you would not like to have the welfare recipients use.
[00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:20.878]  Waters has been charged with ethics violations for asking regulators to help a bank in which her husband had a financial interest.
[00:07:20.878 --> 00:07:22.859]  She denies breaking any house rules.
[00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:28.921]  What people have seen on television in recent days is outlandish behavior.
[00:07:29.461 --> 00:07:30.742]  We're good to go.
[00:07:53.947 --> 00:07:55.749]  Guess what this liberal will be all about?
[00:07:55.749 --> 00:08:07.918]  This liberal will be all about socializing, basically taking over and the government running all of your companies.
[00:08:26.898 --> 00:08:28.740]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:34.404]  After all I'd done to pave the way for a woman president.
[00:08:34.404 --> 00:08:40.509]  That I still lived in a sexist nation that couldn't handle a woman president.
[00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:43.532]  But then, it occurred to me.
[00:08:43.532 --> 00:08:46.194]  We didn't lose the election.
[00:08:46.194 --> 00:08:49.957]  The Russians stole it.
[00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:53.100]  And I'm telling everybody.
[00:08:54.697 --> 00:09:02.820]  I believe that there was a connection between Donald Trump's campaign and the Russians and the Kremlin.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:09.263]  Absolutely was in collusion with the Kremlin and Putin in Russia.
[00:09:09.263 --> 00:09:16.886]  Our intelligence agencies have already confirmed that the Russians did hack into the DNC.
[00:09:16.886 --> 00:09:19.347]  This is a bunch of scumbags.
[00:09:19.347 --> 00:09:20.307]  That's what they are.
[00:09:20.307 --> 00:09:21.587]  Those are very strong words, Congresswoman.
[00:09:21.587 --> 00:09:23.068]  Who are all organized around making money.
[00:09:24.138 --> 00:09:26.300]  Bing, bing, bing, bong, bong, bing, bing, bing.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.424]  You have an investigation going on where the president is implicated.
[00:09:31.424 --> 00:09:34.606]  Just to be clear, there has been no actual evidence yet.
[00:09:34.606 --> 00:09:35.747]  No, it has not been.
[00:09:35.747 --> 00:09:36.928]  No, it has not.
[00:09:36.928 --> 00:09:39.090]  Can't people see what's going on?
[00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.053]  Why do you think they hacked into our election?
[00:09:43.053 --> 00:09:49.018]  They hacked into the election because they have to make sure that Donald Trump got elected.
[00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:29.544]  I built my career on appealing to the people that women of color can accomplish things too.
[00:10:29.544 --> 00:10:35.786]  But I'll be damned if a white man tries to virtue signal their way up the ladder.
[00:10:35.786 --> 00:10:42.207]  And as far as I'm concerned, the Tea Party can go straight to hell.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.581]  Yeah!
[00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:05.041]  You don't scare us.
[00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:08.603]  We're going to fight against you and your policies.
[00:11:08.603 --> 00:11:10.464]  We're going to struggle.
[00:11:10.464 --> 00:11:12.825]  We're going to do everything necessary.
[00:11:12.825 --> 00:11:15.166]  I'm not afraid of anybody.
[00:11:15.166 --> 00:11:16.467]  This is a tough game.
[00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.828]  I'm a strong black woman.
[00:11:18.828 --> 00:11:19.188]  See them?
[00:11:19.188 --> 00:11:21.089]  Look at them in their eyes.
[00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:23.050]  Look at them in their eyes.
[00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:23.650]  Fight.
[00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.250]  Get them.
[00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.791]  Go back to Europe!
[00:11:25.791 --> 00:11:27.132]  Go back to Europe, racist!
[00:11:27.132 --> 00:11:28.773]  Look at them in their eyes, alright?
[00:11:28.773 --> 00:11:29.993]  This one, too.
[00:11:29.993 --> 00:11:31.434]  Look at another one.
[00:11:32.523 --> 00:11:35.506]  You can't be intimidated.
[00:11:35.506 --> 00:11:36.987]  You can't be frightened.
[00:11:36.987 --> 00:11:42.692]  As far as I'm concerned, the Tea Party can go straight to hell.
[00:11:42.692 --> 00:11:52.661]  Hey Maxine Waters, why don't you quit worrying about the Tea Party and look at your own district and the hellhole that's been created there while you were the representative from that district, Maxine.
[00:11:57.606 --> 00:12:04.874]  Maxine Waters is not only a traitor to our nation, but she's not right in the head.
[00:12:04.874 --> 00:12:11.401]  In fact, the only people who are crazier than Maxine Waters are the people who support her.
[00:12:20.939 --> 00:12:27.123]  At this stage of my life, I get a little confused sometimes.
[00:12:27.123 --> 00:12:32.386]  And it sounds like I'm bat-shitting crazy.
[00:12:32.386 --> 00:12:35.147]  But there's a method to my madness.
[00:12:35.147 --> 00:12:38.770]  Because this struggle, it ain't no joke.
[00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.171]  And my millennials, they stay wild.
[00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.453]  Woke.
[00:12:43.453 --> 00:12:52.240]  Maxine Waters, the Democratic Congresswoman calling for President Trump's impeachment, getting a standing ovation before presenting the award for best fight against the system.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.845]  You are very vocal in supporting an investigation that could lead to President Trump being impeached.
[00:12:57.845 --> 00:13:01.388]  We've got to stop his ass!
[00:13:03.391 --> 00:13:09.700]  I think the millennials have adopted me because they really do believe I speak truth to power.
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:17.151]  And I discovered one thing, just tell the truth.
[00:13:17.151 --> 00:13:19.093]  I have not called for impeachment.
[00:13:23.029 --> 00:13:31.398]  The president is a liar, his actions are contemptible, and I'm going to fight every day until he's impeached.
[00:13:31.398 --> 00:13:34.281]  I have not called for an impeachment yet.
[00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:36.903]  I say it over and over again, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.
[00:13:36.903 --> 00:13:41.828]  And I will fight every day until he is impeached!
[00:13:50.134 --> 00:13:56.739]  Should we wait to call for impeachment until we have the answers to that question?
[00:13:56.739 --> 00:13:59.581]  I have not called for impeachment.
[00:13:59.581 --> 00:14:01.863]  You said I'm going to fight every day until he's impeached.
[00:14:01.863 --> 00:14:02.684]  That's what you tweeted.
[00:14:02.684 --> 00:14:06.987]  You know people don't like to hear the word impeachment, but we know you like saying it.
[00:14:07.327 --> 00:14:09.049]  He lies every day.
[00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:12.473]  He's in bed with Putin and the Russians about oil.
[00:14:12.473 --> 00:14:18.781]  And everybody around him are allies with the Kremlin and with the oligarchs of Russia.
[00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:21.364]  They're going to take us down.
[00:14:21.364 --> 00:14:22.546]  This is extraordinary.
[00:14:22.546 --> 00:14:24.248]  This woman is delusional.
[00:14:24.588 --> 00:14:30.153]  I really do believe that much of what you saw coming out of Trump's mouth was a play from Putin's playbook.
[00:14:46.387 --> 00:14:51.730]  I think that when you saw him absolutely calling Hillary crooked.
[00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:52.930]  Crooked Hillary!
[00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.491]  Lock her up, lock her up, all of that was developed.
[00:14:55.491 --> 00:15:01.114]  I think that was developed strategically with people from the Kremlin, with Putin.
[00:15:01.114 --> 00:15:04.536]  You obviously have been very critical of James Comey in the past.
[00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:06.497]  You said that he had no credibility.
[00:15:06.497 --> 00:15:11.059]  I assume that you support the President's decision then to fire his FBI director.
[00:15:11.719 --> 00:15:13.000]  No, I do not.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.820]  Necessarily.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.382]  The FBI Director has no credibility.
[00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:23.306]  But if you said that FBI Director James Comey had no credibility, wouldn't you support the fact that the President then carried Trump?
[00:15:23.306 --> 00:15:25.528]  Now President Trump made the decision to get rid of him?
[00:15:25.528 --> 00:15:26.008]  No.
[00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:27.109]  No, not necessarily.
[00:15:29.597 --> 00:15:36.162]  If Hillary Clinton had won the White House, would you have recommended that she fire FBI Director James Comey?
[00:15:36.162 --> 00:15:37.824]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:15:37.824 --> 00:15:46.711]  If she had won the White House, I believe that given what he did to her and what he tried to do, she should have fired him.
[00:15:46.711 --> 00:15:49.893]  Yes, the FBI Director has no credibility.
[00:15:49.893 --> 00:15:52.255]  We want a diplomatic solution.
[00:15:52.255 --> 00:15:56.118]  We do not want war in North Korea.
[00:15:59.461 --> 00:16:04.263]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:10.126]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:16:10.126 --> 00:16:16.650]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:20.572]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[00:16:20.672 --> 00:16:26.935]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to minutemanstove.com.
[00:16:26.935 --> 00:16:29.396]  That's minutemanstove.com.
[00:16:29.396 --> 00:16:33.018]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[00:16:33.018 --> 00:16:40.242]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[00:16:40.382 --> 00:16:45.264]  And what if this social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[00:16:45.264 --> 00:16:46.104]  There is.

[00:16:59.108 --> 00:17:05.457]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:08.521]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:08.521 --> 00:17:14.069]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:18.211]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:19.472]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:19.472 --> 00:17:20.472]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:27.016]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:27.016 --> 00:17:29.117]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:17:29.117 --> 00:17:32.218]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.
[00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:35.480]  So you want to be sure it's the purest for you and your family.

[00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:03.877]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.877 --> 00:18:05.638]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.638 --> 00:18:16.923]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.703 --> 00:18:26.751]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.751 --> 00:18:32.837]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.837 --> 00:18:37.421]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:40.543]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.543 --> 00:18:42.284]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.284 --> 00:18:52.269]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.269 --> 00:18:54.911]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.911 --> 00:18:59.634]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:17.738]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:17.738 --> 00:20:24.543]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the end for war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:20:24.543 --> 00:20:26.765]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:34.320]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:39.745]  Imagine a world...
[00:20:52.093 --> 00:20:54.675]  Where reality has no bounds.
[00:20:54.675 --> 00:20:59.497]  A time and place dictated by feelings and emotion.
[00:20:59.497 --> 00:21:11.144]  A land where all logic, reasoning, and common sense has been recklessly abandoned in a self-serving effort to please one's own beliefs.
[00:21:11.144 --> 00:21:18.749]  Only here can an individual hold two completely divergent ideas and consider it to be rational.
[00:21:18.749 --> 00:21:21.871]  Only here can be described as the Twilight Zone.
[00:21:51.468 --> 00:21:55.314]  The President of the United States is racist.
[00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.016]  He's a punk.
[00:21:57.016 --> 00:21:58.558]  He's a dog.
[00:21:58.558 --> 00:21:59.440]  He's a pig.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.766]  And he can suck my f**king d**k. He's a con, a botanist, a mutt.
[00:22:03.766 --> 00:22:07.892]  Kiss my motherf**king ass, you big punk f**ksucker.
[00:22:08.192 --> 00:22:11.914]  The President of the United States is a weak man.
[00:22:11.914 --> 00:22:14.235]  He's not only unfit to be President.
[00:22:14.235 --> 00:22:19.858]  In my book, his lack of empathy, his lack of leadership, his lack of courage, he's unfit to be human.
[00:22:19.858 --> 00:22:25.461]  He is clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country.
[00:22:25.461 --> 00:22:26.602]  This is CNN.
[00:22:31.596 --> 00:22:36.980]  Donald J. Trump is President of the United States.
[00:22:54.247 --> 00:22:56.968]  Look at this, this is crazy.
[00:22:56.968 --> 00:22:59.829]  Look at the anger, the hate.
[00:22:59.829 --> 00:23:02.069]  You're a f***ing anti-American!
[00:23:02.069 --> 00:23:04.450]  I'm an anti-American?
[00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.650]  You stupid bastard!
[00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:11.212]  I'm a f***ing patriot!
[00:23:18.408 --> 00:23:20.429]  Oh my, what's your problem, ma'am?
[00:23:20.429 --> 00:23:22.569]  Hi, have I seen you before somewhere?
[00:23:22.569 --> 00:23:26.971]  Mindless zombies.
[00:23:26.971 --> 00:23:28.391]  I could drop every single one of you.
[00:23:28.391 --> 00:23:30.572]  Look at this guy, this guy's a joke.
[00:23:30.572 --> 00:23:32.812]  The good old white days are over with!
[00:23:32.812 --> 00:23:35.633]  The good old white days are over with!
[00:23:35.633 --> 00:23:38.654]  Ain't no more of them days, bro!
[00:23:38.654 --> 00:23:41.455]  You white people, you think you're better than us?
[00:23:44.306 --> 00:23:45.608]  We have to fight back!
[00:23:45.608 --> 00:23:47.591]  There will be casualties on both sides!
[00:23:47.591 --> 00:23:51.539]  Protesters followed Trump supporters to their cars as they left the convention center.
[00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:56.688]  Around the corner and away from police protection on San Carlos Street, a mob mentality took over.
[00:23:59.497 --> 00:24:01.179]  These were pure attacks.
[00:24:01.179 --> 00:24:05.663]  Trump supporters, men, women, even the elderly, left this building last night and walked right into danger.
[00:24:05.663 --> 00:24:08.125]  They're throwing things at the guy who has a Trump shirt on.
[00:24:08.125 --> 00:24:10.067]  Oh, he just got knocked in the back of the head.
[00:24:10.067 --> 00:24:12.028]  He just got punched in the face.
[00:24:12.028 --> 00:24:12.949]  And now they're rushing him.
[00:24:36.943 --> 00:24:37.747]  Yeah.
[00:25:12.884 --> 00:25:22.269]  First, tell me, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role in the Trump campaign?
[00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:29.252]  Boy, there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[00:25:29.252 --> 00:25:38.217]  It's gonna get more Twilight Zone from here.
[00:25:38.217 --> 00:25:41.879]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:25:47.623 --> 00:25:57.250]  We're saying, if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.371]  It got ugly.
[00:25:58.371 --> 00:26:00.453]  Violence erupting at the events.
[00:26:00.453 --> 00:26:01.674]  Fight broke out.
[00:26:01.674 --> 00:26:05.857]  Fists flying between Trump supporters and anti-Trump supporters.
[00:26:05.857 --> 00:26:11.241]  Yeah, I want to warn the folks watching at home, you're about to see some very violent footage.
[00:26:11.241 --> 00:26:12.082]  You want to fight?
[00:26:12.082 --> 00:26:13.743]  You better believe you can!
[00:26:18.615 --> 00:26:22.677]  You say he's not your president, then you shouldn't be here!
[00:26:22.677 --> 00:26:25.639]  Jones has been bringing us together!
[00:26:25.639 --> 00:26:26.719]  You got that?
[00:26:26.719 --> 00:26:28.600]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:26:33.001 --> 00:26:34.182]  Good evening, everybody.
[00:26:34.182 --> 00:26:43.088]  It may be time to declare war outright against the deep state and clear out the rot in the upper levels of the FBI and the Justice Department.
[00:26:43.088 --> 00:26:48.212]  The media is rushing to slander and discredit those of us that are exposing this.
[00:26:48.212 --> 00:26:50.454]  I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up!
[00:26:50.754 --> 00:26:51.595]  This isn't a game!
[00:26:51.595 --> 00:27:01.484]  There are new concerns that anti-Trump FBI officials formed even a secret society at the FBI to subvert the president after his election.
[00:27:01.484 --> 00:27:02.404]  Stop there.
[00:27:02.404 --> 00:27:06.568]  A secret society that has secret meetings offside of the Justice Department?
[00:27:06.568 --> 00:27:06.848]  Correct.
[00:27:06.848 --> 00:27:07.249]  Really?
[00:27:07.249 --> 00:27:08.350]  Secret societies?
[00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:09.651]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:27:09.651 --> 00:27:11.332]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[00:27:11.332 --> 00:27:13.715]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[00:27:15.689 --> 00:27:20.573]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday to get back at you.
[00:27:20.573 --> 00:27:24.015]  It's one giant incestuous circle of corruption.
[00:27:24.015 --> 00:27:25.777]  Look, the CIA is a rogue agency.
[00:27:25.777 --> 00:27:28.519]  The White House and the President are citing simple rules.
[00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:33.562]  We have to start getting ready for insurrection and civil war because they're really pushing it.
[00:27:33.562 --> 00:27:41.849]  What are we going to do if they kill the President and then order their local governments and their local federal branches to come arrest thousands of resistance leaders?
[00:27:43.396 --> 00:27:45.558]  They kill Trump, they remove Trump.
[00:27:45.558 --> 00:27:48.600]  It will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.081]  This is a FEMA high-level event.
[00:27:50.081 --> 00:27:51.142]  This is a national emergency.
[00:27:51.142 --> 00:27:52.803]  Important instructions will follow.
[00:28:07.227 --> 00:28:17.954]  In compliance with the United Nations, the Department of Homeland Security has declared martial law.
[00:28:17.954 --> 00:28:20.535]  City officials have called for military help.
[00:28:20.535 --> 00:28:23.217]  Planes and troops are expected to arrive within the next two days.
[00:28:24.568 --> 00:28:26.830]  You've just witnessed a warning.
[00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.112]  A warning from the future.
[00:28:29.112 --> 00:28:46.204]  A warning that part of the Republic will become so brainwashed and mentally ill that they volunteer their own energy for the destruction of their own country, livelihood, and prosperity, while being tricked into believing they were righteously saving the world.
[00:28:46.204 --> 00:28:49.407]  A lesson in liberal logic from the Twilight Zone.
[00:28:59.252 --> 00:29:06.716]  Attention parents and grandparents, have you ever wanted to give a gift that would have lasting value and provide spiritual benefits long after Christmas is over?
[00:29:06.716 --> 00:29:10.057]  A gift you could even call an investment in the next generation?
[00:29:10.057 --> 00:29:14.179]  If so, this is going to be the single most important message you'll hear this holiday season.
[00:29:14.179 --> 00:29:25.265]  Hi, I'm Bill Hyde, and I want to tell you about an exciting gift, one you can give your kids or grandkids that's going to teach Christian history, build up their faith, provide extraordinary role models, and it's all done with a distinctive Christian worldview.
[00:29:25.425 --> 00:29:30.850]  I'm talking about the award-winning Movies for the Mind CD sets, based on the extraordinary adventures of G.A.
[00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:31.992]  Henty Audio Series.
[00:29:31.992 --> 00:29:32.612]  The best part?
[00:29:32.612 --> 00:29:37.177]  You can finally give a Christian gift to the kids that's not boring, dull, or cheesy.
[00:29:37.177 --> 00:29:41.200]  The audio adventures also build vocabulary, focus, and attention span.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.105]  But they're not sold in stores, and you can't get the adventures at any big internet retailers either.
[00:29:46.105 --> 00:29:46.766]  So to learn more,
[00:29:46.966 --> 00:29:50.528]  Even get below wholesale pricing and a whole bunch of Christmas bonuses.

[00:31:00.382 --> 00:31:06.023]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[00:31:06.023 --> 00:31:07.644]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[00:31:07.644 --> 00:31:08.284]  It's a good thing.
[00:31:08.284 --> 00:31:11.865]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[00:31:11.865 --> 00:31:14.245]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[00:31:14.245 --> 00:31:15.746]  I learned what the best was.
[00:31:15.746 --> 00:31:20.887]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[00:31:20.887 --> 00:31:21.427]  It's amazing.
[00:31:21.587 --> 00:31:24.169]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:31.013]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotsApply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[00:31:31.013 --> 00:31:32.675]  He has a glut of them.
[00:31:32.675 --> 00:31:35.096]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[00:31:35.096 --> 00:31:36.777]  When it's discounted usually $200, it's $127.
[00:31:36.777 --> 00:31:41.801]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[00:31:45.203 --> 00:31:47.346]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[00:31:47.346 --> 00:31:49.669]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:50.270]  It's amazing.
[00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:55.998]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:32:00.188 --> 00:32:09.476]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:32:09.476 --> 00:32:12.339]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:32:12.339 --> 00:32:18.385]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:32:19.045 --> 00:32:25.310]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:31.614]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:32:31.614 --> 00:32:38.539]  Now, due to the establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.301]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:13.317 --> 00:33:15.537]  Infowars.com Studios.
[00:33:15.537 --> 00:33:20.419]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.419 --> 00:33:26.760]  President Trump is speaking live in the last six, seven minutes, detailing what happened in the election last night.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.881]  It's still ongoing in three states on the west coast in Arizona.
[00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:35.842]  So we'll be looking at all of that after Ted Nugent leaves us in about
[00:33:36.702 --> 00:33:55.358]  Twenty minutes from now I want to get his take on it because he's out there in the grassroots in Texas and Michigan and many other areas and as he said two years ago it's gonna be the Rust Belt Pennsylvania and Michigan and places like that that are gonna decide the 2020 election and boy has he been proven right there.
[00:33:55.358 --> 00:33:58.861]  We'll be going over all the numbers today and so much more but
[00:33:59.722 --> 00:34:02.284]  Not getting voter motor passed in the House.
[00:34:02.284 --> 00:34:04.885]  The RINOs really, really blew it, as Michael Savage has said.
[00:34:04.885 --> 00:34:11.149]  And the other big one was the total censorship of conservatives, nationalists, patriots.
[00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:16.292]  The completely platforming, not even letting people, you know, promote things on Facebook, you name it.
[00:34:16.292 --> 00:34:18.573]  That is an in-kind donation to the Democrats.
[00:34:18.573 --> 00:34:21.575]  And it's a major Federal Elections Commission violation.
[00:34:21.575 --> 00:34:25.838]  So, the Republicans always sit back with the Democrats, engage in corruption.
[00:34:27.335 --> 00:34:28.996]  And that becomes aiding and abetting.
[00:34:28.996 --> 00:34:35.260]  Like Beto O'Rourke got caught at the highest levels of his campaign siphoning off money to give to the caravan.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.641]  Caravans that were already arriving, not just the big one.
[00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:40.803]  And so we have to fight the violation of free speech.
[00:34:40.803 --> 00:34:44.846]  We have to fight the Chinese meddling in the election, which was public.
[00:34:44.846 --> 00:34:50.109]  We have to have the Republicans go on the offense against the Democrats, just like the Democrats just did.
[00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:51.550]  But we have real meat and potatoes here.
[00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:52.431]  That's my view.
[00:34:53.499 --> 00:34:58.463]  On all this, you know, 20-something seats in the House, three new Senate seats.
[00:34:58.463 --> 00:35:09.571]  So it's a trade-off, but they're going to use those committees now, the one that Maxine Waters heads up that deals with the financing of the country, to try to sabotage the Dems.
[00:35:09.571 --> 00:35:13.474]  They have 34 in the House and three in the Senate.
[00:35:13.474 --> 00:35:15.976]  And it's a pretty big win for them there.
[00:35:15.976 --> 00:35:19.779]  Some GOP are trying to spin it that, oh, well, Obama lost 60-plus in the House.
[00:35:21.132 --> 00:35:22.253]  And a whole bunch of senators.
[00:35:22.253 --> 00:35:24.035]  Well, yes, that's great.
[00:35:24.035 --> 00:35:25.596]  That's a bigger defeat.
[00:35:25.596 --> 00:35:33.704]  This could have been a lot worse, but the fact that Trump has had his legs cut out from under him with all the internet censorship is a big deal.
[00:35:33.704 --> 00:35:37.708]  Joining us is Ted Nugent to give us his aftermath take he privately told me.
[00:35:38.228 --> 00:35:41.269]  That he was, you know, putting a good face on it, but he had a bad feeling.
[00:35:41.269 --> 00:35:49.033]  So did I. But again, I think the illegals and folks voting in dead people's names, which is confirmed everywhere in many places, pushed him over the top.
[00:35:49.033 --> 00:35:51.434]  Plus a record spending.
[00:35:51.434 --> 00:35:53.275]  So, Ted, thanks for coming on with us, Mr. Nugent.
[00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.970]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:55.671]  My pleasure.
[00:35:55.671 --> 00:36:09.735]  I'm kind of sharing a dynamic rollercoaster ride of emotions here with you today, but it's a happy November 7th to everyone anyway, and I suppose we need to keep our chin up and keep our spirit positive.
[00:36:09.735 --> 00:36:22.339]  Today is my son Theodore Tobias Nugent's 42nd birthday, and we shared a wonderful morning in the sacred Michigan swamps together with some great, great American entrepreneurs, working hard, playing hard families during the
[00:36:22.839 --> 00:36:50.676]  There's a very important deer season up here, so that's keeping my spirit buoyant and alive, but when I consider the politics of the once greatest, most productive, work ethic, pride in excellence state of Michigan turn into a toxic, embarrassing, vulgar, cultural suicide liberal hellhole like California in 2018,
[00:36:52.503 --> 00:37:11.138]  And Alex, I could literally cry tears of blood to witness the once great state of Michigan literally look on the chalkboard of suicidal guarantees of California and then vote for them all.
[00:37:11.138 --> 00:37:22.067]  I hesitate but am forced to admit that if Michigan can go from the number one most productive, proud state in the nation
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:28.303]  To an embarrassing suburb of Chicago, suburb of California.
[00:37:28.303 --> 00:37:31.586]  I'm gonna fill your thunder, so can Texas.
[00:37:31.586 --> 00:37:36.569]  Well, thank God I'm a Texas resident and I'll be going home to Texas soon.
[00:37:36.569 --> 00:37:52.760]  Because we proved that the smokescreen and the deceit and the fake news, hate and lies of the left that Robert O'Rourke scammed Texas with was defeated and that a great, great constitutionalist like Ted Cruz
[00:37:53.805 --> 00:37:56.531]  Defeated this California wannabe.
[00:37:56.531 --> 00:37:58.174]  That is another high for me.
[00:37:58.897 --> 00:38:28.084]  But I'm in the swamps of Michigan right now, Alex, and I suppose, metaphorically speaking, a lot of my fellow Americans are in the swamps of Michigan right now because when you adhere to the agenda of the left, where you don't even have to be an American to vote in America, where you don't believe that America should have secure borders, where you know that gun-free zones are where the most innocent lives are slaughtered, and these freaks want more of them!
[00:38:29.352 --> 00:38:32.653]  I, I, this is Planet of the Cuckoos next.
[00:38:32.653 --> 00:38:38.975]  Click, click, clockwork orange, twilight zone insanity, and I don't recognize these people.
[00:38:38.975 --> 00:38:44.257]  I don't recognize them as thinking, conscientious, moral beings.
[00:38:44.257 --> 00:38:45.478]  Well Ted, that's my next question.
[00:38:46.198 --> 00:38:53.063]  That's my next question, because you look at Michigan, which I've had family that lived up there in the 50s, 60s, you name it.
[00:38:53.063 --> 00:38:53.863]  I know all about it.
[00:38:53.863 --> 00:38:56.825]  You know, vacation up there, the Great Lakes, all of it's beautiful.
[00:38:56.825 --> 00:39:11.655]  It was as American, red-blooded, kick-ass, John Wayne, Chuck Yeager, as Texas was, and then it got taken over, just like Vermont was, and now it is the bluest of the blue chess pools.
[00:39:11.655 --> 00:39:14.017]  So when I look at Michigan and how sad it is,
[00:39:14.557 --> 00:39:16.178]  And how it's been destroyed in many areas.
[00:39:16.178 --> 00:39:18.320]  Still has its great beauty and a lot of great people in the country.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:27.408]  I'm saying Texas only put amazing Ted Cruz, perfect for Texas, total constitutionalist patriot, only beating by three points.
[00:39:27.408 --> 00:39:29.089]  That to me is frightening.
[00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:30.471]  And that's what the New York Times brags.
[00:39:30.471 --> 00:39:36.696]  They think in the next decade, if we don't do something, we're going to go the way of California and in the way of Michigan.
[00:39:36.696 --> 00:39:38.818]  And so how do we reverse this nightmare?
[00:39:38.818 --> 00:39:39.879]  How do we get on the offense?
[00:39:40.919 --> 00:39:42.660]  You know, Alex, I always have answers.
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:47.604]  If you notice that whenever you and I have a dialogue and an interview, I've always got answers, don't I?
[00:39:47.604 --> 00:39:48.084]  Yes.
[00:39:48.084 --> 00:39:52.567]  I mean, I'm an eternal maniacal optimist.
[00:39:52.567 --> 00:39:56.570]  I believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.
[00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:58.612]  I believe in the Ten Commandments of the Golden Rule.
[00:39:58.612 --> 00:40:09.600]  I believe in loving your neighbor and helping your family and neighbor and being in the asset column and making sacrifices and taking risks so that you are a productive member of your community so that you can help others when they need it.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.662]  And I know these people, I know they're everywhere, but guess what?
[00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:15.843]  We're outnumbered.
[00:40:15.843 --> 00:40:33.451]  The people who believe that we should turn Michigan into a San Francisco feces and needle zone outnumber conscientious, positive, constitutional, free Michiganiacs.
[00:40:33.451 --> 00:40:34.492]  I'm helpless.
[00:40:35.529 --> 00:40:37.770]  To describe why or how.
[00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:44.291]  I worked so hard for the great John James, and the Bill Schuette, and the Tom Leonard, and the Lena Epstein.
[00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:56.235]  I worked so hard for these Republicans whose battle cry was the Constitution, and rugged individualism, and productivity, and work ethic, and living within your means, and saving for a rainy day.
[00:40:56.235 --> 00:41:00.256]  And Alex, it was rejected.
[00:41:00.256 --> 00:41:00.556]  I am
[00:41:01.543 --> 00:41:06.347]  Alex, I'm gonna admit, my name is Ted Nugent.
[00:41:06.347 --> 00:41:08.509]  I don't know what else to do!
[00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:33.816]  I'm in that position as well, but I tell you what, we need more people to do what you're doing, what I've done, what Trump is doing, is get really aggressive and not let these people push us around and understand that they're like cancer and have to be dealt with and do outreach, try to take leftists out and deprogram them, try to take them, shoot them, try to take them camping.
[00:41:34.136 --> 00:41:47.625]  I think if you really look at the average leftist, they're super domesticated, they're scared, they don't know what's going on, and then they're controlled by a criminal elite themselves who usually don't even pay taxes, but lecture those of us that do that we're not paying enough.
[00:41:47.625 --> 00:41:54.349]  I really think we have to go to political war against them, because we just live our lives and then come out every two years and vote.
[00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:55.650]  We're going to have to go on the offense.
[00:41:56.368 --> 00:42:05.479]  Well, Alex, as I just expressed an uninhibited, honest, and genuine, sincere statement of hopelessness, let me take the next step.
[00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:07.341]  And I know you're ready for this.
[00:42:07.341 --> 00:42:09.023]  As I told my once great friend,
[00:42:11.926 --> 00:42:13.287]  We're good to go.
[00:42:30.043 --> 00:42:31.564]  You're absolutely right.
[00:42:31.564 --> 00:42:33.786]  And Ted, you do know what to do.
[00:42:33.786 --> 00:42:36.648]  You've been leading this thing since the 1960s.
[00:42:36.648 --> 00:42:38.490]  That's why it's so great to have you on.
[00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:43.414]  One more segment as we look at the aftermath of the still ongoing election, when we come back.

[00:46:04.125 --> 00:46:09.851]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:17.738]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:46:17.738 --> 00:46:20.881]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:46:21.081 --> 00:46:26.343]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[00:46:38.266 --> 00:46:39.647]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:11.189 --> 00:47:14.470]  ...meter mark and a hundred meter dash, and you got that kind of a lead.
[00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:16.991]  Yes, because you were born white.
[00:47:16.991 --> 00:47:21.092]  Here's what it looked like along Waverly Lane in North Fort Worth early Thursday morning.
[00:47:21.092 --> 00:47:28.994]  Cell phone video and pictures taken of the area show the signs reading, it's okay to be white, posted onto lampposts and other pieces of public property.
[00:47:29.734 --> 00:47:33.036]  District 4 Councilman Kerry Moon isn't taking it lightly.
[00:47:33.036 --> 00:47:42.340]  I condemn any type of literature sign that is posted that may be offensive to some folks.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:48.263]  Well, the councilman said this kind of activity is considered a Class C misdemeanor and those responsible could face a citation.
[00:47:48.263 --> 00:47:58.048]  He also said instead of ripping the signs down, neighbors should call police immediately and leave those signs up since they are considered to be evidence and then just let the police investigate the situation.
[00:47:58.508 --> 00:48:00.069]  It's concerning, at the least.
[00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:01.791]  They're wondering why.
[00:48:01.791 --> 00:48:03.152]  I'm really Trump's demographic.
[00:48:03.152 --> 00:48:03.292]  Yeah.
[00:48:03.292 --> 00:48:05.153]  You're a Michigan angry white guy.
[00:48:05.153 --> 00:48:08.415]  I'm an angry white guy, over 50, with a high school education.
[00:48:08.415 --> 00:48:19.904]  We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized, right up to the right.
[00:48:19.904 --> 00:48:21.765]  And we have to start doing something about them.
[00:48:21.765 --> 00:48:24.147]  There is no travel ban on them.
[00:48:24.947 --> 00:48:27.308]  There's no ban on, you know, the Muslim ban.
[00:48:27.308 --> 00:48:29.169]  There is no white guy ban.
[00:48:29.169 --> 00:48:30.330]  So what do we do about that?
[00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:37.514]  So if I could just speak to my fellow angry white American guys who are semi-uneducated like me.
[00:48:37.514 --> 00:48:38.655]  Dudes!
[00:48:38.655 --> 00:48:40.696]  Give it up!
[00:48:40.696 --> 00:48:44.118]  We've been running the show for 10,000 years!
[00:48:45.018 --> 00:48:48.959]  America was never great for anyone who wasn't a white guy.
[00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:52.620]  What do you say to the people who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.221]  Oh my goodness, poor white people!
[00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:54.721]  Please, stop!
[00:48:54.721 --> 00:48:56.201]  I'm gonna stop.
[00:48:56.201 --> 00:48:57.421]  Get out, brother!
[00:48:57.421 --> 00:49:01.243]  Get out, you little white little f***er!
[00:49:01.243 --> 00:49:03.423]  You're a whitey, aren't ya?
[00:49:03.423 --> 00:49:05.884]  It's okay to be white is now a hate crime.
[00:49:05.884 --> 00:49:07.384]  Okay, so what's the correct position?
[00:49:07.384 --> 00:49:08.745]  That it's not okay to be white?
[00:49:08.745 --> 00:49:10.965]  Don't worry, you're already in the correct position.
[00:49:10.965 --> 00:49:11.545]  Tuck.
[00:49:11.545 --> 00:49:13.406]  Bending over backwards for white Nashville.
[00:49:13.746 --> 00:49:17.049]  Take your privilege somewhere else, please.
[00:49:17.049 --> 00:49:18.690]  You're a white male!
[00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:19.451]  No Trump!
[00:49:19.451 --> 00:49:20.212]  No wall!
[00:49:20.212 --> 00:49:23.294]  I don't know what to say at all!
[00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:24.295]  No Trump!
[00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:25.276]  No wall!
[00:49:25.276 --> 00:49:27.157]  No USA at all!
[00:49:27.157 --> 00:49:28.098]  No Trump!
[00:49:28.098 --> 00:49:28.879]  No wall!
[00:49:28.879 --> 00:49:30.781]  Kill this enemy!
[00:49:30.781 --> 00:49:31.761]  No Trump!
[00:49:31.761 --> 00:49:32.482]  No wall!
[00:49:32.482 --> 00:49:36.105]  There aren't a lot of free countries.
[00:49:36.105 --> 00:49:38.027]  Usually people end up falling to tyranny.
[00:49:39.645 --> 00:49:42.926]  So it's a long way to the top if you want to keep this country free.
[00:49:42.926 --> 00:49:48.107]  And that's why I love Ted Nugent, especially getting to meet him in person and spend some time with him a few times over the years.
[00:49:48.107 --> 00:49:53.548]  You can feel the energy, you can feel the spirit, and it's the spirit of America.
[00:49:53.548 --> 00:50:04.590]  And he talks about how he sees that around the country and black people and Hispanics and white folks and old people, young people, people that love freedom and they get that there is an attempt to domesticate us and control us.
[00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:08.333]  And that there's an attempt to conquer this country.
[00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:14.979]  And that's why you can hear it in his voice, that he's so concerned about what happened last night, not spinning it like some Republicans.
[00:50:14.979 --> 00:50:16.380]  And that's okay, I get it.
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.503]  Okay, it's the smallest losses ever in a midterm since 1868.
[00:50:19.503 --> 00:50:21.564]  2010, Obama lost 63 in the House.
[00:50:21.564 --> 00:50:22.205]  Clinton in 94, 52.
[00:50:22.205 --> 00:50:22.665]  Eisenhower in 58.
[00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:31.171]  Well, the fact is we're promoting freedom.
[00:50:50.532 --> 00:51:02.256]  ...and prosperity, and just a year and a half, two years into Trump being in, everything's turning around, and the fact that these people reject America and the real culture of Democrats is they really hate the country.
[00:51:02.256 --> 00:51:03.197]  So I'll tell you what we do.
[00:51:03.197 --> 00:51:06.398]  We go out and really expose who the average leftist is.
[00:51:06.758 --> 00:51:18.545]  They're either total idiot followers, domesticated, never been out of their condo apartment, God love them, or they're a bunch of scumbag, ultra-rich, controlling people and they have a manager class that literally hate this country.
[00:51:18.545 --> 00:51:20.326]  Ted Nugent, what do we do about them?
[00:51:20.326 --> 00:51:24.229]  You just heard that chant, no borders, no walls, no USA all.
[00:51:24.229 --> 00:51:31.273]  I say literally, you are against the country existing, that isn't free speech, get your ass out of here, you're a damn enemy.
[00:51:32.285 --> 00:51:39.613]  Well, let me see if I can take a deep breath here after getting the wind knocked out of me in the once great state of Michigan.
[00:51:39.613 --> 00:51:49.023]  But assuming the talking heads were right, that the number one issue for the Democrats was health care, which is liberal code to mean free health care for at least some people of their choosing.
[00:51:49.623 --> 00:51:58.449]  There were other Democrats who championed free college, and other Democrats championed, I guess, free everything, including my dog's kennel scooper.
[00:51:58.449 --> 00:52:09.297]  Have you ever noticed that it's the Democrats who want to give away free stuff to everyone who will vote for them, as if there is an endless pile of taxpayer dollars from which to plunder?
[00:52:09.297 --> 00:52:15.962]  Does the Democrats' free stuff mantra make you think back to when your parents told you that nothing is free?
[00:52:16.682 --> 00:52:19.946]  Do you wonder how and who is going to pay for all this free stuff?
[00:52:19.946 --> 00:52:24.451]  Should Starbucks be forced to provide a free cup of coffee every morning to those who don't have any money?
[00:52:24.451 --> 00:52:26.012]  How about restaurants?
[00:52:26.012 --> 00:52:30.457]  Should they be forced to provide free meals to anybody that doesn't want to pay?
[00:52:30.457 --> 00:52:36.504]  I just want to know when the fedzilla gravy train of waste and torch tax dollars ends.
[00:52:36.924 --> 00:52:37.284]  We're good.
[00:52:57.369 --> 00:52:58.270]  I don't
[00:53:19.047 --> 00:53:20.368]  We got back to Florida.
[00:53:20.368 --> 00:53:22.110]  We got a couple of victories here.
[00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:23.892]  But that's not good enough for me.
[00:53:23.892 --> 00:53:33.484]  The biggest threat isn't that we completely lost Michigan, but that some of the solid red states like Texas were close.
[00:53:33.484 --> 00:53:36.989]  How can you be close to Robert O'Rourke?
[00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:38.810]  In Texas!
[00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:39.852]  This is insanity.
[00:53:39.852 --> 00:53:42.394]  So, you're right, we do know what to do, Alex.
[00:53:42.394 --> 00:53:44.396]  We need to raise more hell.
[00:53:44.396 --> 00:53:55.467]  We need to shout from the mountaintop of our everyday lives what the Constitution, the Bill of Rights identifies and outlines, and start demanding that kind of accountability from our elected employees.
[00:53:55.467 --> 00:53:56.408]  And here in the state of Michigan,
[00:53:56.548 --> 00:53:57.968]  And what you said is critical.
[00:53:57.968 --> 00:53:59.489]  The Democrats have said, get out there, bully.
[00:53:59.489 --> 00:54:01.309]  Don't let them eat in restaurants.
[00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:03.189]  Don't let them go to grocery stores.
[00:54:03.189 --> 00:54:04.130]  Don't let them go to gas stations.
[00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.870]  And they do it to me.
[00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:06.810]  When they do it, I get right back in their face.
[00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:10.871]  We don't want to be criminal bullies, but in our lives with leftists and globalists and minions,
[00:54:24.574 --> 00:54:32.299]  We need to either get them to wake up and understand what's happening or we need to stop associating with them and not do business with them and say, listen, we're not your slaves.
[00:54:32.299 --> 00:54:35.141]  And if you want to have a political and economic fight, you're going to get one.
[00:54:35.141 --> 00:54:38.464]  This is a war and they're organized to take us over.
[00:54:38.464 --> 00:54:39.304]  And you get it.
[00:54:39.304 --> 00:54:39.724]  I get it.
[00:54:39.724 --> 00:54:41.025]  They used to call us extreme.
[00:54:41.025 --> 00:54:44.308]  They don't anymore because they say the Republicans are radicalizing.
[00:54:44.308 --> 00:54:46.189]  It's because the left is radical.
[00:54:46.189 --> 00:54:47.310]  We were never radical.
[00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:50.432]  Freedom is radical compared to tyranny, but they're coming after us.
[00:54:50.432 --> 00:54:51.813]  We don't have a choice.
[00:54:52.591 --> 00:54:56.273]  I have a message for my fellow Texans, who I love dearly.
[00:54:56.273 --> 00:54:59.395]  I mean, the best Texans are the best people in the world.
[00:54:59.395 --> 00:55:01.617]  And that goes for everybody all across this country.
[00:55:01.617 --> 00:55:05.920]  I've got friends in Canada that are as Texans as Texans.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:14.145]  But, we've talked about this every time since the first time we shared a microphone, Alex, from the first time we shared a coffee at the Nuja Ranch.
[00:55:14.145 --> 00:55:19.909]  The biggest curse in America today isn't the Liberals.
[00:55:19.909 --> 00:55:21.250]  It isn't the Democrats.
[00:55:22.117 --> 00:55:24.099]  It's the apathy in our own camp.
[00:55:24.099 --> 00:55:32.246]  I guarantee that Texas is the bellwether for the liberal crusade to destroy America and turn us into Venezuela.
[00:55:32.246 --> 00:55:46.818]  And that Texas are so cocky, which I love, so confident, which I love, that so many of them literally will look you in the eye and say, well, ain't no way we're going to take over Texas.
[00:55:46.818 --> 00:55:49.540]  And they don't even vote.
[00:55:51.912 --> 00:56:05.438]  If the real Hellraisers, the real Independents, the real—remember the Alamo Texans—if every one of them would have voted, we would have won with Ted Cruz in a landslide.
[00:56:05.438 --> 00:56:08.020]  But many of them took it for granted.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.560]  You can't mess with Texas.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:10.961]  They didn't even vote Alamo.
[00:56:11.041 --> 00:56:12.022]  No, I agree.
[00:56:12.022 --> 00:56:13.164]  Listen, I can't tell you.
[00:56:13.164 --> 00:56:22.114]  There's a lot of great Texans, and I'm from Texas, going back to the start of Texas, and the real Texas spirit is a special Americana thing, but so many people, they just take it for granted.
[00:56:22.114 --> 00:56:24.637]  They're like, I'll never put up with that.
[00:56:24.637 --> 00:56:25.238]  BS!
[00:56:25.238 --> 00:56:27.260]  This is a super bad wake-up call.
[00:56:28.101 --> 00:56:36.753]  But let me tell you, Austin, where my family's from, is literally like San Francisco, and it's now got the needles and feces downtown.
[00:56:36.753 --> 00:56:40.258]  And so, I'm telling everybody, folks, the rest of the city's beautiful.
[00:56:40.258 --> 00:56:42.561]  These people are coming to conquer you.
[00:56:42.561 --> 00:56:44.925]  You better start getting in their damn faces.
[00:56:46.277 --> 00:57:00.527]  Yeah, bottom line is if you believe enough in the American dream and that you choose your own path in life and you do the best that you can do, if you believe in that, you can't just do it unto yourself.
[00:57:00.527 --> 00:57:02.528]  You have to demand that from everyone around you.
[00:57:02.848 --> 00:57:16.894]  And when you see slovenly behavior, when you see liberal denial and fake news and political correct scourge, when you see it, you can't just walk away and shrug your shoulders and go, oh well, nothing I can do.
[00:57:16.894 --> 00:57:19.055]  Well, there is something you can do.
[00:57:19.055 --> 00:57:22.516]  We need to be firm and confrontational.
[00:57:22.516 --> 00:57:23.296]  The great H.L.
[00:57:23.296 --> 00:57:30.579]  Richardson out of Northern California, a great senator, he wrote the book that guided the Newt Gingrichs and the Ronald Reagans.
[00:57:30.579 --> 00:57:31.540]  The book is titled,
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:37.561]  Monday through next Sunday, we are bringing back the biggest sales in our history.

[00:58:24.206 --> 00:58:24.967]  It's an amazing system.
[00:58:25.467 --> 00:58:26.748]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars.
[00:58:26.748 --> 00:58:27.908]  They're trying to defund us.
[00:58:27.908 --> 00:58:34.892]  So I said, everything must go by the end of the year so that we'll at least have the cash to continue operating for a while.
[00:58:34.892 --> 00:58:40.015]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.

[00:58:50.529 --> 00:58:53.592]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food.
[00:58:53.592 --> 00:58:56.534]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:58:56.534 --> 00:58:59.477]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:58:59.477 --> 00:59:03.520]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply.
[00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:06.470]  Most respected companies out there.
[00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:14.252]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[00:59:36.601 --> 00:59:39.142]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.

[00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:56.050]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.934 --> 01:00:29.505]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.505 --> 01:00:39.012]  California skies are the most polluted in the world right now with epic million acre fires raging.
[01:00:39.012 --> 01:00:41.474]  And the sky is gray.
[01:00:41.474 --> 01:00:42.635]  California skies.
[01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:50.011]  This part's important.
[01:00:50.011 --> 01:00:53.612]  I found a church.
[01:00:53.612 --> 01:00:57.333]  I got on my knees.
[01:00:57.333 --> 01:01:04.915]  This part's key right here.
[01:01:04.915 --> 01:01:08.136]  Crank it up.
[01:01:08.136 --> 01:01:09.376]  California Dream.
[01:01:22.338 --> 01:01:37.164]  Now, you know, occasionally I see an article, I see a news story that I already know up one side and down the other.
[01:01:37.164 --> 01:01:50.830]  But I see it and it makes me ashamed that I haven't covered it more and discussed it more and talked about what the final destination is, what the end game is of all the apparent
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:02:02.102]  Deindustrialization and sabotage and corruption where the establishment will go way out of its way to do something corrupt and evil instead of doing something good.
[01:02:02.102 --> 01:02:07.143]  Where are they leading us in this scorched earth policy?
[01:02:07.143 --> 01:02:09.764]  What is our destination?
[01:02:09.764 --> 01:02:14.005]  Where is the world government taking us?
[01:02:14.005 --> 01:02:19.906]  And I saw this article, we've linked it up on InfoWars.com from the Daily Mail.
[01:02:23.797 --> 01:02:35.701]  And it gives a headline out here, whistleblower, teacher, makes shocking claim that most are autistic.
[01:02:35.701 --> 01:02:36.301]  That's the headline.
[01:02:36.301 --> 01:02:37.581]  You say, well, most of what?
[01:02:37.581 --> 01:02:48.844]  And it goes on to say that basically mentally retarded or brain damaged children who don't even know who they are, are being taught in the public schools that if you're a boy, you're a girl.
[01:02:48.844 --> 01:02:49.985]  And if you're a girl, you're a boy.
[01:02:49.985 --> 01:02:50.165]  Why?
[01:02:52.739 --> 01:03:06.263]  Under Cold Springs Harbor Eugenics in this country, the Royal Academy in England, and under the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute under Hitler, anyone that is seen as mentally defect must be sterilized.
[01:03:06.263 --> 01:03:17.986]  But it's not fashionable to sterilize the mentally retarded or the mentally feeble, as the Nazis called it, those with bad racial hygiene.
[01:03:17.986 --> 01:03:21.127]  And so what you do is you just say, oh, we're teaching
[01:03:22.748 --> 01:03:33.836]  The Down Syndrome children and the autistic children, that they're really another sex, and then isn't it cute, they don't go to the Special Olympics, they just get their genitals cut off.
[01:03:33.836 --> 01:03:36.919]  But it's so cool, it's like a class thing.
[01:03:36.919 --> 01:03:38.480]  And that's really what this is.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:43.984]  But you see, there's a bigger issue here than that, that dwarfs it by multi-levels.
[01:03:46.383 --> 01:03:58.449]  Why, if you go to the CDC's own numbers, in 1960, about 1 in 33,000 had autism spectrum disorders.
[01:03:58.449 --> 01:04:08.374]  The last numbers that came out in 2015 for the United States, the numbers are similar for Canada, show 1 in 58.
[01:04:08.374 --> 01:04:11.236]  We are the leaders in the world
[01:04:13.075 --> 01:04:20.702]  In autism spectrum disorders, except for one country, South Korea.
[01:04:20.702 --> 01:04:25.046]  What does South Korea do to a level even higher than us?
[01:04:25.046 --> 01:04:26.968]  Well, they do a couple things.
[01:04:26.968 --> 01:04:33.354]  They use even more Roundup glyphosate on their crops, their biggest crop being soybeans.
[01:04:33.354 --> 01:04:35.075]  And they take more vaccines than anybody else.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.883]  And they have more screen time than anybody else.
[01:04:38.883 --> 01:04:40.604]  And they have more 5G than anybody else.
[01:04:40.604 --> 01:04:42.486]  I guess it's more than two things.
[01:04:42.486 --> 01:04:43.668]  But this is a fact.
[01:04:43.668 --> 01:04:51.696]  They're now reporting that in some classrooms, 30% of the children by age 5 or 6 cannot even talk.
[01:04:51.696 --> 01:04:53.538]  The Holocaust is here.
[01:04:53.538 --> 01:04:54.899]  Did anybody notice?
[01:04:54.899 --> 01:04:56.341]  Did anybody say no?
[01:04:56.341 --> 01:04:57.302]  We'll break it down straight ahead.
[01:04:58.579 --> 01:05:02.820]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:06.282]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars.
[01:05:06.282 --> 01:05:08.062]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[01:05:08.062 --> 01:05:11.323]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[01:05:11.323 --> 01:05:18.105]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[01:05:18.105 --> 01:05:23.187]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[01:05:23.527 --> 01:05:29.654]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[01:05:29.654 --> 01:05:32.617]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:05:32.617 --> 01:05:33.718]  I want to keep going.
[01:05:33.718 --> 01:05:37.562]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[01:05:37.562 --> 01:05:39.564]  I want to push all the way.
[01:05:39.564 --> 01:05:40.865]  I've committed to do that.
[01:05:40.865 --> 01:05:41.946]  I've prayed for that.
[01:05:41.946 --> 01:05:43.588]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[01:05:43.588 --> 01:05:46.011]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[01:05:46.511 --> 01:05:47.833]  I will never falter.
[01:05:47.833 --> 01:05:50.155]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:51.096]  I physically will.
[01:05:51.096 --> 01:05:57.844]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWars4.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:15.547]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:15.547 --> 01:06:22.171]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:22.171 --> 01:06:25.312]  Riders on the storm.
[01:06:25.312 --> 01:06:27.994]  Riders on the storm.
[01:06:27.994 --> 01:06:29.455]  To this world we're born.
[01:06:29.455 --> 01:06:31.016]  Riders on the storm.
[01:06:31.016 --> 01:06:34.078]  To this world we're from.
[01:06:34.078 --> 01:06:35.739]  Riders on the storm.
[01:06:35.739 --> 01:06:37.840]  Like the part where he talks about
[01:06:38.659 --> 01:06:44.544]  Take a long holiday.
[01:06:44.544 --> 01:06:46.265]  Let your children play.
[01:06:46.265 --> 01:06:48.627]  If you give this man a ride... If you give this man a ride...
[01:07:13.582 --> 01:07:14.663]  Here's the key.
[01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:17.043]  If you give this man a ride.
[01:07:17.043 --> 01:07:24.705]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[01:07:24.705 --> 01:07:29.846]  You know, I start a lot of broadcasts and I gallop right into the incredible news and I don't build it up.
[01:07:29.846 --> 01:07:32.806]  There should be like 20th Century Fox music playing.
[01:07:36.647 --> 01:07:39.149]  Because this is important stuff.
[01:07:39.149 --> 01:07:44.132]  This is everything we ever talked about now, writ large, all of it being confirmed daily.
[01:07:44.132 --> 01:07:48.574]  Because we're now in the thick of 2018, about to go into 2019.
[01:07:48.574 --> 01:07:50.536]  We're in the future.
[01:07:50.536 --> 01:07:52.877]  It's happening.
[01:07:52.877 --> 01:07:59.581]  And boy, let me tell you, the globalists, they kept their promises on what they were going to do to us and the type of world government they were going to build.
[01:07:59.581 --> 01:08:05.585]  But there's a big old fat juicy fly on the ointment and his name is Donald J. Trump.
[01:08:07.096 --> 01:08:19.761]  There's a couple other big ol' fat juicy flies called nationalism and populism and the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and the right to keep and bear arms and free speech and just red-blooded instinct.
[01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:25.923]  And Impo Wars and our great audience and all the other constellation of wonderful people out there.
[01:08:25.923 --> 01:08:30.145]  Too numerous to mention but Matt Drudge and Tucker Carlson and you.
[01:08:35.091 --> 01:08:42.194]  You know, I've got all this exclusive video that two of our reporters shot in the last five days in San Diego, there at the border crossing with a caravan slamming in.
[01:08:42.194 --> 01:08:44.075]  That's coming up.
[01:08:44.075 --> 01:09:00.582]  Joe Biggs, who sent the tweet on Friday to Swalwell, Swallowswell, the Democrat, the darling, when he said it, we're going to confiscate all your semi-autos, and if you don't turn them in, we're going to nuke you.
[01:09:00.582 --> 01:09:01.243]  He really said that.
[01:09:01.963 --> 01:09:04.104]  So Joe Biggs is going to join us for the next hour as well.
[01:09:04.104 --> 01:09:07.584]  We've got all this news.
[01:09:07.584 --> 01:09:16.447]  There's so much of it, but I was sitting there on Friday night doing research.
[01:09:16.447 --> 01:09:23.828]  And then I came into the office Saturday morning and I saw Greg Reese in here and some of the other crew.
[01:09:23.828 --> 01:09:28.569]  And they called me over and they said, have you seen these findings?
[01:09:28.569 --> 01:09:30.230]  And I said, yes, I saw those findings.
[01:09:31.661 --> 01:09:33.743]  20 plus years ago.
[01:09:33.743 --> 01:09:37.345]  And I'd forgotten this.
[01:09:37.345 --> 01:09:43.690]  Even though I made a film called America Destroyed by Design in 97 that actually predicted it.
[01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:44.851]  But I didn't predict it.
[01:09:44.851 --> 01:09:46.072]  They said they were going to do it.
[01:09:46.072 --> 01:09:50.435]  It's like saying they're going to have Shakespeare in the park at a local park.
[01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:52.336]  And you read it a month before in the newspaper.
[01:09:52.336 --> 01:09:57.340]  And then I predict Shakespeare in the park on whatever date is going to be there.
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:00.462]  And you go, you tell your girlfriend, look, I'm really psychic, baby.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.461]  They're having Shakespeare in the park.
[01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:06.941]  And she's like, no, you read it in the newspaper.
[01:10:06.941 --> 01:10:19.105]  And that's what's so frustrating is there are newspapers and then there are globalist publications where they communicate with each other and act like we're a bunch of dumb animals and thought that what we said or did would never matter.
[01:10:19.105 --> 01:10:22.146]  That was their undoing where they admit the whole plan.
[01:10:22.146 --> 01:10:26.067]  And I'm sitting here simply going, wow, look at their plan.
[01:10:26.067 --> 01:10:30.108]  You know, they've got the search for extraterrestrial life.
[01:10:30.108 --> 01:10:31.409]  This is an allegory, a, a,
[01:10:33.746 --> 01:10:35.946]  Okay, parallel.
[01:10:35.946 --> 01:10:45.288]  I'm not getting into aliens or whether they exist or not, but they're beaming with lasers out to deep space and to other solar systems.
[01:10:45.288 --> 01:10:46.309]  Here we are.
[01:10:46.309 --> 01:10:48.889]  There's six and a half billion, seven million of us.
[01:10:48.889 --> 01:10:55.991]  There's six and a half billion when they send the signals out and this is what we do and here's our language and here we are and here's how we operate.
[01:10:55.991 --> 01:10:56.911]  Who knows if they're nice?
[01:10:56.911 --> 01:10:58.331]  Who knows if they're bad?
[01:10:58.331 --> 01:11:01.592]  The people sending out the messages are kind of projecting on what's out there.
[01:11:02.682 --> 01:11:03.863]  What they think is going to come back.
[01:11:03.863 --> 01:11:06.864]  They're projecting their own selves onto that.
[01:11:06.864 --> 01:11:07.825]  Or maybe they have a death wish.
[01:11:07.825 --> 01:11:09.206]  I don't know.
[01:11:09.206 --> 01:11:10.126]  It remains to be seen.
[01:11:10.126 --> 01:11:26.755]  But, if you were sending a message out, and you got a message back, that you could decode, how it'll take them 20 light years to get here, but when they get here, here's the weapons they're going to use, and they're going to destroy the planet.
[01:11:26.755 --> 01:11:28.796]  You might mount some defense against it.
[01:11:32.816 --> 01:11:42.019]  And so that's what's frustrating to me is, we're not facing aliens from outer space, or from some interstellar region.
[01:11:42.019 --> 01:12:00.804]  We're facing elite humans, and by elite I mean who are in control, who have taken on the mantle of total social engineers, and who have decided the general public is worthless crap, and who have a planetary program to cut off resources, consolidate control, release bioweapons that are
[01:12:04.031 --> 01:12:20.419]  attenuated and dialed back to put us into a position of circling the wagons before the real bioweapons come in and before we're just removed from the face of the earth.
[01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:27.783]  Because the establishment has made the decision since the days of Ian Fleming with OSS and MI6 writing books about it like Moonraker
[01:12:28.683 --> 01:12:32.365]  He wrote that in the late 50s and made it into a movie in the early 80s.
[01:12:32.365 --> 01:12:42.130]  Where the global government and leader are going to release a bioweapon to knock out 99% of the population so they can come back and take it all over and build a Garden of Eden.
[01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:43.371]  You're like, well that's a moon raker.
[01:12:43.371 --> 01:12:46.893]  But you see, this is their real plan.
[01:12:46.893 --> 01:12:53.216]  And now the universities say we need to post it to the human world and it's going to be a great thing and you'll thank God for Airborne Ebola.
[01:12:53.216 --> 01:12:54.657]  You see it now all over.
[01:12:55.811 --> 01:12:58.032]  What I covered decades ago has become old news.
[01:12:58.032 --> 01:13:02.674]  It's become passé.
[01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:23.742]  And so that's what I'm trying to get people to look at and to think about and to understand is that there's a whole other dimension to this where there were people that came up with equations that were proven to be accurate in the 1890s that were later turned into atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project.
[01:13:24.784 --> 01:13:36.271]  So if 1890s equations created atomic weapons and atomic power, and then hydrogen power, and hydrogen weapons, what has come after that?
[01:13:36.271 --> 01:13:40.754]  Well, antimatter, fission, fusion we know, and it's been leaked as a message to the Chinese and others.
[01:13:40.754 --> 01:13:43.496]  And don't worry, they're over there building it themselves.
[01:13:43.496 --> 01:13:52.182]  We could be destroyed like that if one of these reactors goes sideways, they get a strange lit, or a fission-fusion reaction, or a cyclotronic explosion.
[01:13:53.323 --> 01:13:58.908]  Or a superconducting super colliding black hole creation.
[01:13:58.908 --> 01:14:09.618]  There are thousands of possible permutations with mathematical equations that have been proven doctrinally the third dimension to be absolutely real, not theory.
[01:14:09.618 --> 01:14:14.243]  Atomic bomb dropping on your city and vaporizing you is not theorem once it's tested.
[01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:30.627]  And so, we stand at the precipice of God-like power, and we're more savage, and more corrupt, and more petulant, and more evil than we've ever been.
[01:14:30.627 --> 01:14:31.627]  And then I look at the numbers.
[01:14:31.627 --> 01:14:33.967]  1 in 33,000 had autism in the 1960s.
[01:14:33.967 --> 01:14:35.247]  1 in 58 has it in North America.
[01:14:35.247 --> 01:14:38.428]  It's even worse in South Korea.
[01:14:44.998 --> 01:14:46.938]  No breast cancer to speak of in Brazil.
[01:14:46.938 --> 01:14:50.559]  23 years ago, glyphosate is introduced.
[01:14:50.559 --> 01:14:54.180]  Their breast cancer rate is as high as ours now.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:15:02.662]  Glyphosate grows breast tumors.
[01:15:02.662 --> 01:15:06.863]  I could give you a thousand other points and a thousand beyond that.
[01:15:06.863 --> 01:15:12.504]  And I have an article here that again, I don't just believe this article, this huge 22 page report,
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:21.856]  I know it's true because I've read the Tavistock Institute documents and I know the plan.
[01:15:21.856 --> 01:15:24.581]  Up to a third of the children are now mentally retarded or autistic.
[01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:30.350]  About 25% are on Prozac-type drugs.
[01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:40.992]  And now, they're coming in, and even teachers are blowing the whistle, and taking mentally retarded children and telling them, you're really a girl, you're really a boy, and chopping their genitals off.
[01:15:40.992 --> 01:15:47.873]  And it's all government-based, eugenic sterilization like Hitler did, but it's all trendy because you call it transgenderism.
[01:15:47.873 --> 01:15:49.594]  But it's worse than that.
[01:15:49.594 --> 01:15:56.955]  The system makes you retarded, makes you autistic with the chemicals, then it sterilizes you, essentially killing you.
[01:15:57.839 --> 01:15:59.059]  Hear that?
[01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:04.440]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:07.341]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.341 --> 01:16:10.922]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:16:57.463 --> 01:17:02.246]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.

[01:17:28.763 --> 01:17:32.685]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.685 --> 01:17:34.225]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:34.225 --> 01:17:37.186]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:42.748]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[01:18:58.106 --> 01:19:07.396]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:19:07.396 --> 01:19:10.259]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:19:10.259 --> 01:19:16.306]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:19:16.986 --> 01:19:23.231]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:19:23.231 --> 01:19:29.535]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:19:29.535 --> 01:19:36.460]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:19:37.601 --> 01:19:39.223]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:22.472 --> 01:20:31.820]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting world-wide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:34.462]  Okay.
[01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:49.114]  What I'm about to cover is something that potentially will guarantee save thousands and thousands and thousands of lives in just the next year or so.
[01:20:49.114 --> 01:20:49.595]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:51.121 --> 01:20:58.566]  It will also save tens of billions of dollars.
[01:20:58.566 --> 01:21:11.115]  But it will also let us rediscover something like fire or the wheel or the theory of thermodynamics that we've lost in many cases.
[01:21:11.115 --> 01:21:16.199]  Or the idea of a constitutional republic.
[01:21:16.199 --> 01:21:19.161]  It was a big debate 30 years ago.
[01:21:19.161 --> 01:21:20.462]  And a big debate 20 years ago.
[01:21:21.909 --> 01:21:27.811]  By major firefighting associations, and the Bureau of Land Management, the National Forest Service, and state governments.
[01:21:27.811 --> 01:21:33.853]  And Texas is one of the few states that said, we're not going to comply with federal land management.
[01:21:33.853 --> 01:21:38.535]  Plus, Texas only has a few percentage points of its land being federal, places like Big Bend.
[01:21:38.535 --> 01:21:39.055]  We're less than 10%.
[01:21:39.055 --> 01:21:44.257]  Some states like Utah are almost 90%.
[01:21:44.257 --> 01:21:46.598]  And so here's the bottom line.
[01:21:46.598 --> 01:21:49.719]  Trump comes out in the last few weeks as California burns.
[01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:53.471]  The worst fires in modern history.
[01:21:53.471 --> 01:21:59.255]  And says you're supposed to have fire mitigation programs that stop that.
[01:21:59.255 --> 01:22:04.559]  And so the media at press conferences said, it was all over the news, said, look at this idiot.
[01:22:04.559 --> 01:22:05.319]  What's he talking about?
[01:22:05.319 --> 01:22:07.201]  He's blaming firefighters.
[01:22:07.201 --> 01:22:13.185]  He said, yeah, you gotta rake the brush, you gotta cut it, you gotta have gaps.
[01:22:13.185 --> 01:22:19.910]  Now all Trump was saying is what the National Firefighting Association, the National Logging Association,
[01:22:21.198 --> 01:22:37.028]  And others for 30 years have been saying, until 30 years ago, under George Herbert Walker Bush is when it started, he signed on the UNESCO, UN Wildlands Treaty, we're going to show you that treaty in a moment, and the maps of it.
[01:22:37.028 --> 01:22:48.416]  Everywhere in the world, not just here, but in ancient Africa, and Native Americans, have you ever driven around in the countryside anywhere and see old houses, old churches, and they've got like a one or two foot
[01:22:49.343 --> 01:22:49.903]  I don't know.
[01:23:14.318 --> 01:23:17.439]  You use what they call fire breaks.
[01:23:17.439 --> 01:23:20.981]  Now, I know for the general audience you're like, yeah Alex, two plus two equals four.
[01:23:20.981 --> 01:23:25.202]  I'm talking to the general public who's tuning in for the first time.
[01:23:25.202 --> 01:23:30.404]  Because I've got the stacks of articles on the show you saying, celebrities and firefighters are angry at Trump.
[01:23:30.404 --> 01:23:35.066]  They don't quote any real firefighters, they just quote some idiot celebrities.
[01:23:35.066 --> 01:23:41.509]  The National Forest Service still puts two foot wide spaces every couple hundred yards.
[01:23:41.509 --> 01:23:42.009]  They use a plow.
[01:23:43.817 --> 01:23:48.161]  And there's famous South African examples where hundreds of millions of acres have been saved by a single road.
[01:23:48.161 --> 01:23:50.243]  We can show that photo for TV viewers.
[01:23:50.243 --> 01:24:04.677]  Just type in firebreak into a search engine and you'll get, even Wikipedia is accurate on this, and it will show you 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, the National Forestry Service and others.
[01:24:06.303 --> 01:24:20.970]  Saying, if you've got dead brush, pile it up, use it, burn it, use it for nitrogen on your crops, and build fire breaks, humps, around your crops or around your house, at least about two feet high and three feet wide.
[01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:24.731]  So, this was what we had before fire departments.
[01:24:24.731 --> 01:24:29.934]  Dear TV viewer, plow around to prevent forest fires.
[01:24:29.934 --> 01:24:34.356]  See your fire warden, US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, State Forest Service.
[01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:46.845]  And if you drive around anywhere in the country and you see older crops, new crops don't have this, you'll see a hump, a mound about two feet high, three feet wide, all around it.
[01:24:46.845 --> 01:24:48.787]  You're like, why is that around a field?
[01:24:48.787 --> 01:24:50.189]  They got a fence outside.
[01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:52.652]  What does that keep out?
[01:24:52.652 --> 01:24:53.574]  It keeps fire out.
[01:24:54.753 --> 01:24:58.075]  Does it keep deer out, or bunny rabbits out, or skunks out?
[01:24:58.075 --> 01:24:58.895]  It keeps fire out.
[01:24:58.895 --> 01:25:04.058]  And I know for rural audiences, you're like, Alex, you're talking to us like how we put our socks on.
[01:25:04.058 --> 01:25:06.480]  Hey, that's the separation.
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.923]  Those of us that come from farming and ranching families, those of us that come from the land, we get all this, okay?
[01:25:11.923 --> 01:25:17.927]  For people that grew up in big high-rises, they hear Trump going, they have bad fire mitigation, they need to put in
[01:25:19.639 --> 01:25:21.160]  Firebreaks.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:22.180]  I need to do control burns.
[01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:25.362]  And the media can go, look at this crazy kook, he's nuts.
[01:25:25.362 --> 01:25:29.064]  Now the media knows, he's saying 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:25:29.064 --> 01:25:31.765]  Submarines need doors on them.
[01:25:31.765 --> 01:25:35.187]  Humans breathe oxygen, water's wet.
[01:25:35.187 --> 01:25:41.290]  But that's really the dichotomy of the incredible, invincible ignorance of the leftists and the general public.
[01:25:41.290 --> 01:25:42.211]  They're all over.
[01:25:42.211 --> 01:25:45.032]  Colbert, CNN, making fun of the president.
[01:25:45.032 --> 01:25:47.133]  Oh, he says, rake the brush.
[01:25:47.133 --> 01:25:48.594]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:25:50.418 --> 01:26:04.024]  The Aborigines in Australia, the government of Australia, the government of Japan, the government of Indonesia, the government of Russia, the government of China, they all build fire bricks.
[01:26:04.024 --> 01:26:12.268]  You go out in the Texas Hill Country, built by Poles and Germans mainly, and every house has a two foot tall, three foot wide hump of rock.
[01:26:13.888 --> 01:26:16.389]  You go to China, they got the exact same thing.
[01:26:16.389 --> 01:26:21.771]  Because it stops fire when there's a lightning strike at 2 a.m.
[01:26:21.771 --> 01:26:23.432]  and you wake up and your house is on fire.
[01:26:23.432 --> 01:26:26.133]  You build a fire break, your house doesn't burn down.
[01:26:26.133 --> 01:26:27.394]  And look, this is so fundamental.
[01:26:30.353 --> 01:26:36.235]  Even the Autobahn Society admits that hundreds of millions of acres have burned down since the policy of no firebreaks.
[01:26:36.235 --> 01:26:40.216]  And they came out, the biggest environmental group, and said, we need to build them.
[01:26:40.216 --> 01:26:43.697]  Trump, two years ago, got control and said, put firebreaks back in.
[01:26:43.697 --> 01:26:44.717]  And the Feds have been doing it.
[01:26:44.717 --> 01:26:45.617]  The BLM's been doing it.
[01:26:45.617 --> 01:26:48.218]  The average BLM employees, absolutely.
[01:26:48.218 --> 01:26:48.978]  They have all the equipment.
[01:26:48.978 --> 01:26:52.359]  They've been wanting to do it.
[01:26:52.359 --> 01:26:55.000]  California, though, said no two years ago.
[01:26:56.098 --> 01:27:00.460]  There isn't one fire break, one controlled burn, until a, quote, emergency happens.
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:08.724]  Then they get bulldozers out trying to build one when the fire's coming in 50 mile an hour winds, and then firefighters die.
[01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:21.390]  And that's what's so frustrating is that even on InfoWars.com, I shot a special report about this yesterday, and I showed all the articles, all the documents, all the statements, and I saw half the comments going, ah, shut up, you want to hurt the earth, you kook, you know, blah, blah.
[01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:22.851]  When this is a fact,
[01:27:24.073 --> 01:27:25.414]  The Earth's always had lightning.
[01:27:25.414 --> 01:27:26.934]  It's always had giant fires.
[01:27:26.934 --> 01:27:32.577]  Humans learned how to use the fallen wood to cook with or for fertilizer when you burn it.
[01:27:32.577 --> 01:27:34.838]  It makes great nitrogen.
[01:27:34.838 --> 01:27:46.363]  Every year, I live here in Texas, every year after the summer, in the fall, we have amazing sunsets and sometimes you cough because there's so much smoke in the air if the wind goes north.
[01:27:46.363 --> 01:27:48.904]  And that's the Mexicans and the Guatemalans
[01:27:50.282 --> 01:27:57.533]  Grabbing all the dead wood and all what's left of the corn, 90% of it isn't good corn, it's the leaves and everything.
[01:27:57.533 --> 01:28:03.964]  And they pack it all up and they burn it and they spread it over the field, their fertilizer.
[01:28:03.964 --> 01:28:05.326]  They don't need to buy fertilizer.
[01:28:08.072 --> 01:28:23.279]  So they get fertilizer, and if there's a lightning strike, imagine if a corn farmer in say Central Mexico left four feet of corn, just cut the top off the corn, and just left big old dead corn plants out there.
[01:28:23.279 --> 01:28:23.639]  Dry!
[01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:27.015]  In the sun for months, and then lightning strikes.
[01:28:27.015 --> 01:28:28.956]  What happens to your farmhouse?
[01:28:28.956 --> 01:28:30.157]  It strikes, it burns.
[01:28:30.157 --> 01:28:34.340]  Huge waves of fire grow, and then jumps, roads, everything, and your whole area burns.
[01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:41.226]  They don't have wildfires in Mexico, folks, because they got farmers everywhere that control the land.
[01:28:41.226 --> 01:28:42.046]  We used to have them, too.
[01:28:43.207 --> 01:28:48.811]  They took him away, and now we're in a tinderbox, and Trump is telling the truth, and they're acting like he's a crazy person.
[01:28:48.811 --> 01:28:56.316]  When we come back, we'll show you the shocking evidence that other Democrats, on purpose to sabotage America, have blocked real fire management.
[01:28:57.774 --> 01:28:58.994]  Hear that?
[01:28:58.994 --> 01:29:04.376]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:04.376 --> 01:29:07.277]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:07.277 --> 01:29:10.858]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:29:10.858 --> 01:29:18.420]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:23.022]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.

[01:29:25.443 --> 01:29:26.603]  Faketv.com
[01:29:27.555 --> 01:29:31.178]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[01:29:31.178 --> 01:29:38.543]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[01:29:38.543 --> 01:29:43.446]  And what if this social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[01:29:43.446 --> 01:29:44.267]  There is.
[01:29:44.267 --> 01:29:45.848]  It's RightSocial.net.

[01:30:34.597 --> 01:30:35.978]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars.
[01:30:35.978 --> 01:30:37.038]  They're trying to defund us.

[01:33:14.735 --> 01:33:26.143]  I've got a good woman at home Who thinks I do no wrong
[01:33:30.794 --> 01:33:38.051]  He just ain't always around And you know that's when
[01:33:38.641 --> 01:33:40.983]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Sunday edition.
[01:33:40.983 --> 01:33:42.044]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:42.044 --> 01:33:43.124]  We're here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:43.124 --> 01:33:45.166]  I'm back at 11 a.m.
[01:33:45.166 --> 01:33:45.686]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:45.686 --> 01:33:47.227]  Central weekdays.
[01:33:47.227 --> 01:33:48.368]  David Knight's 8 a.m.
[01:33:48.368 --> 01:33:49.549]  doing an incredible job.
[01:33:49.549 --> 01:33:53.672]  Also, of course, Owen Schroyer and the rest of the crew, The War Room, 3 p.m.
[01:33:53.672 --> 01:33:55.413]  every day.
[01:33:55.413 --> 01:33:58.195]  Okay.
[01:33:58.195 --> 01:34:00.537]  There is a global corporate policy.
[01:34:00.537 --> 01:34:02.939]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[01:34:02.939 --> 01:34:04.580]  This is the biggest deal.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:05.180]  You understand this?
[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:05.821]  You understand everything.
[01:34:06.769 --> 01:34:20.211]  To artificially suppress infrastructure that nation states have built that is designed to give the general public wealth and jobs and success.
[01:34:20.211 --> 01:34:25.872]  The globalists leave all their dams, all their fields, all their structures alone.
[01:34:25.872 --> 01:34:35.094]  But by controlling regulation, they leave your areas open to unfair trade competition, to tornadoes,
[01:34:36.158 --> 01:34:37.479]  To fires.
[01:34:37.479 --> 01:34:38.659]  This is what they're doing.
[01:34:38.659 --> 01:34:40.460]  And this is the big secret.
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:44.542]  And Trump understands this.
[01:34:44.542 --> 01:34:50.805]  From the beginning of recorded history, humans have built fire breaks and had control burns.
[01:34:50.805 --> 01:34:51.325]  All U.S.
[01:34:51.325 --> 01:34:55.027]  military bases have fire burns built around them.
[01:34:55.027 --> 01:34:59.009]  They do control burns to cut the brush back every year.
[01:34:59.009 --> 01:35:01.049]  The government until the early 90s
[01:35:02.881 --> 01:35:04.782]  They've told the public to do this.
[01:35:04.782 --> 01:35:06.883]  They've now removed it.
[01:35:06.883 --> 01:35:13.467]  They've put federal and state regulations in, in states like California, blocking it.
[01:35:13.467 --> 01:35:16.308]  And now they wonder why California is going up in flames.
[01:35:16.308 --> 01:35:19.390]  It's being done by design, like NAFTA and GATT.
[01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:22.712]  And all these deals are meant to sabotage America.
[01:35:22.712 --> 01:35:24.733]  China builds a new dam every few months.
[01:35:24.733 --> 01:35:25.934]  We haven't had one in decades.
[01:35:27.287 --> 01:35:31.369]  China builds three new coal power plants a month.
[01:35:31.369 --> 01:35:34.490]  We might get one a year and over a thousand shut down.
[01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:37.291]  We are being slated for de-industrialization.
[01:35:37.291 --> 01:35:38.992]  This is an admitted plan.
[01:35:38.992 --> 01:35:42.433]  Now let me go to some of these news articles.
[01:35:42.433 --> 01:35:44.934]  Because Trump is going out there to California.
[01:35:44.934 --> 01:35:45.874]  He's there for the last day.
[01:35:45.874 --> 01:35:54.278]  And he is talking about how great our firefighters are and how wonderful people are standing up and getting federal funds in there.
[01:35:54.278 --> 01:35:54.638]  That's good.
[01:35:56.581 --> 01:36:01.187]  But the controlled corporate media is like, firefighters and celebrities are mad at him for blaming firefighters.
[01:36:01.187 --> 01:36:05.172]  He blamed land management, not the firefighters.
[01:36:06.789 --> 01:36:10.632]  Trump dismisses climate change questions about wildfires.
[01:36:10.632 --> 01:36:12.994]  I want great climate.
[01:36:12.994 --> 01:36:17.257]  As if fires are a cause that have always happened by climate change.
[01:36:17.257 --> 01:36:18.578]  Change is always happening.
[01:36:18.578 --> 01:36:21.920]  The idea is pay the UN carbon taxes and they'll fix it.
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.823]  The idea is that, oh, there's all these fires because of climate change.
[01:36:24.823 --> 01:36:29.646]  No, it's because there's always been huge fires until humans cut fire breaks.
[01:36:29.646 --> 01:36:33.269]  President Trump's tweet on California wildfires angers firefighter celebrities.
[01:36:33.269 --> 01:36:34.050]  Total lie.
[01:36:34.050 --> 01:36:34.250]  CNN.
[01:36:35.506 --> 01:36:36.046]  Not a surprise.
[01:36:36.046 --> 01:36:37.648]  Now here's the Washington Times.
[01:36:37.648 --> 01:36:42.272]  Loggers support Trump's claim that wildfires caused by poor forest management.
[01:36:42.272 --> 01:36:45.434]  They have the big National Association of Loggers saying that today.
[01:36:45.434 --> 01:36:48.977]  But don't believe the Washington Times.
[01:36:48.977 --> 01:36:54.722]  Here's even Wikipedia linking through, showing the whole history of firebreaks for thousands of years.
[01:36:54.722 --> 01:36:56.463]  Just search the term firebreak.
[01:36:56.463 --> 01:37:03.249]  Here's a TV viewer, a South African firebreak, again where the road forms a firebreak and saves millions of acres.
[01:37:04.912 --> 01:37:09.276]  The National Fire Service saying build those, but here's where it really gets important.
[01:37:09.276 --> 01:37:12.598]  Here's where it really gets important.
[01:37:12.598 --> 01:37:21.205]  We've got the San Francisco Chronicle fighting fire with fire, going back over 100 plus years
[01:37:23.393 --> 01:37:29.476]  Building firebreaks, using control burns, the only way to stop fire, and clearing out the brush, and having no problem.
[01:37:29.476 --> 01:37:42.143]  And it's a big article, and it goes over all the diagrams, all the photos, all the history, and what they've done, and now the fact that the fires are exploding, because they won't let them do it.
[01:37:42.143 --> 01:37:50.548]  Even autobahn.org, serious leftist environmental group, says, with few options, the BLM is mowing firebreaks to battle sagebrush blazes across the West.
[01:37:52.148 --> 01:37:53.990]  This lightning strikes, catches on fire.
[01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:56.053]  If you don't go fire breaks, it grows and grows.
[01:37:56.053 --> 01:37:58.696]  It's always happened.
[01:37:58.696 --> 01:38:00.418]  So there's control burns and there's fire breaks.
[01:38:03.297 --> 01:38:11.460]  So, that's the facts, and our president can't even get into a position to point out 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:13.960]  He's bad for saying stop this.
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:19.022]  He got BLM to stop it two years ago when he got in, but the state of California owns most of the land.
[01:38:19.022 --> 01:38:30.966]  Let's put some diagrams up from 1992, the UN Biological Diversity Treaty that President George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to, but that the Senate never ratified.
[01:38:30.966 --> 01:38:31.686]  Let's put that on screen.
[01:38:32.708 --> 01:38:37.152]  Half the country's in red, little or no human use.
[01:38:37.152 --> 01:38:52.126]  And then, once they've done that, we can zoom in there in California and overlay the red area, no human use, to exactly where the national wildfires are happening in California.
[01:38:53.450 --> 01:39:02.595]  And by them 30 years ago saying no more controlled burns, no more firebreaks, they even closed old roads and said we're rewilding and let them grow up to get rid of firebreaks.
[01:39:02.595 --> 01:39:11.640]  You look at exactly where the UN said under treaty they wanted to get people off the land and you see exactly now where the fires are.
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:15.203]  Take away the firebreaks, take away land management, you know it'll burn out.
[01:39:15.203 --> 01:39:19.285]  All the homes and towns there will be taken over and then later you can buy them up for nothing.
[01:39:21.397 --> 01:39:28.677]  Here is Greg Reese's report on just how serious this is and how suspicious some of this is with evidence of arson.
[01:39:28.677 --> 01:39:29.358]  Let's go to that report.
[01:39:34.128 --> 01:39:36.308]  At around 9.45 p.m.
[01:39:36.308 --> 01:39:42.970]  on Sunday, October 8th of 2017, the Tubbs Fire began in Northern California.
[01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:48.251]  And by the time the sun came up, over a thousand homes were destroyed.
[01:39:48.251 --> 01:39:58.033]  Videos and photographs show how this so-called forest fire seemed to spare the wild and somehow jump from house to house.
[01:39:58.033 --> 01:40:02.274]  CNN reported that the so-called forest fire jumped to the freeway.
[01:40:03.734 --> 01:40:11.961]  Hundreds of photographs show cars with melted trails of aluminum alloys from what must have been an unprecedented amount of power.
[01:40:11.961 --> 01:40:15.924]  The average forest fire burns at 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:40:15.924 --> 01:40:21.328]  Aluminum alloys will melt at temperatures between 1,200 and 2,000 degrees.
[01:40:21.328 --> 01:40:25.491]  But many of these cars were nowhere near a forest fire.
[01:40:25.491 --> 01:40:26.912]  Some cars were flipped over.
[01:40:28.033 --> 01:40:30.294]  The heat must have been intense.
[01:40:30.294 --> 01:40:41.157]  Not only was it able to melt aluminum alloy, but consistently, every home that caught fire was leveled to white powdery ash in less than 12 hours.
[01:40:41.157 --> 01:40:44.898]  By October 31st, the Tubbs fire had destroyed 5,643 buildings.
[01:40:44.898 --> 01:40:45.578]  PG&E, Pacific Gas and Electric.
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:58.126]  PG&E was found responsible for 16 of the fires, over $10 billion in damages.
[01:40:58.126 --> 01:41:03.750]  All of this while producing $1 billion a year in profits for the Rothschild Investment Group.
[01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:10.156]  PG&E warned the public that the fires will not just continue, but will grow larger every season.
[01:41:10.156 --> 01:41:14.600]  They warned their investors that future liability will force PG&E into bankruptcy.
[01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:22.003]  In June, utility officials told state lawmakers that they needed protection to survive the coming fire season.
[01:41:22.003 --> 01:41:32.449]  And on August 31st, California state legislature passed a utility bailout bill to protect PG&E, its shareholders, and Rothschild Investment.
[01:41:33.369 --> 01:41:39.458]  At sunrise on Thursday, November 8th, the Camp Fire wildfire began in California.
[01:41:39.458 --> 01:41:46.207]  It has all the same anomalies as the Tubbs Fire, and is already twice as devastating.
[01:41:46.207 --> 01:41:48.931]  Many people are asking the same question.
[01:41:48.931 --> 01:41:49.692]  Is this an attack?
[01:41:50.613 --> 01:42:01.976]  In 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers admit to the development of directed energy weapons and microwave technology.
[01:42:01.976 --> 01:42:10.079]  In 2017, Lockheed Martin shoots drones out of the sky with an invisible laser beam that burns them from the inside out.
[01:42:10.079 --> 01:42:12.099]  The technology exists.
[01:42:12.099 --> 01:42:13.840]  The evidence is there.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:14.420]  But the motive?
[01:42:15.692 --> 01:42:24.941]  Perhaps it could be found in the United Nations Agenda 21, wherein certain areas of the country are proposed to be off limits to human use.
[01:42:24.941 --> 01:42:32.948]  It just so happens that these strange California fires seem to all be within the proposed no human use areas.
[01:42:33.889 --> 01:42:38.872]  New regulations and insurance policies are preventing homeowners from rebuilding.
[01:42:38.872 --> 01:42:46.197]  And meanwhile, they claim it is the new normal, and are now claiming it is a phenomenon of global warming.
[01:42:46.197 --> 01:42:53.201]  One thing is for certain, the governor of California has already assured that the people will pay for all of the damages.
[01:42:53.201 --> 01:42:56.063]  This is Greg Reese, reporting for InfoWars.com.

[01:43:57.199 --> 01:44:01.164]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:01.164 --> 01:44:04.468]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:44:04.468 --> 01:44:10.737]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:10.737 --> 01:44:13.500]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:44:14.241 --> 01:44:18.044]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:44:18.044 --> 01:44:24.530]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:29.494]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.242 --> 01:44:34.163]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:44:34.163 --> 01:44:41.364]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:41.364 --> 01:44:46.065]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:44:46.065 --> 01:44:52.266]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:52.266 --> 01:44:56.247]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:58.089 --> 01:45:07.379]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:45:07.379 --> 01:45:10.262]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:45:10.262 --> 01:45:16.289]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:45:16.969 --> 01:45:23.213]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:45:23.213 --> 01:45:29.518]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:45:29.518 --> 01:45:36.442]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:45:37.583 --> 01:45:50.608]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:45:50.608 --> 01:45:54.869]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:45:54.869 --> 01:45:57.550]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:03.144]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:03.551]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:21.457 --> 01:47:25.461]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:47:25.461 --> 01:47:27.483]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:27.483 --> 01:47:34.189]  So I'm gonna break something down right now that is about as profound as it can get.
[01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:38.734]  It's like rediscovering mathematics or fire or gunpowder.
[01:47:38.734 --> 01:47:40.355]  It's a big deal.
[01:47:43.564 --> 01:47:51.989]  For all of recorded history, humans have built little mound walls around their homes, around their crops, in case lightning struck and fires came in.
[01:47:51.989 --> 01:47:53.209]  Humans learned to fear fire.
[01:47:53.209 --> 01:47:55.471]  There's always been giant wildfires.
[01:47:55.471 --> 01:47:58.072]  Some cases it would burn hundreds of millions of acres.
[01:47:58.072 --> 01:47:59.793]  Archaeologists have shown.
[01:47:59.793 --> 01:48:01.594]  Whole civilizations would be burned down.
[01:48:01.594 --> 01:48:04.096]  Whole cities.
[01:48:04.096 --> 01:48:07.377]  So they would build mounds of dirt, mounds of rock.
[01:48:07.377 --> 01:48:08.218]  They would also build
[01:48:10.137 --> 01:48:14.578]  Areas where they would just use fire in a controlled area to burn away the underbrush.
[01:48:14.578 --> 01:48:18.318]  And President Trump has been saying California should do that because 30 years ago, under a U.N.
[01:48:18.318 --> 01:48:19.139]  treaty, the U.S.
[01:48:19.139 --> 01:48:26.720]  stopped on state and federal land having controlled burns or having firebreaks.
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:35.121]  They even started closing, you've heard about this, thousands and thousands of roads, millions of miles of roads, which formed firebreaks as well.
[01:48:35.121 --> 01:48:36.342]  Many of them were built for that.
[01:48:36.342 --> 01:48:38.562]  So I'm telling you about something that's like
[01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:40.731]  Newtonian physics.
[01:48:40.731 --> 01:48:44.014]  I'm talking about something that just is a fact.
[01:48:44.014 --> 01:48:55.384]  In fact, the original Greenbelts in Austin, Texas, that were built 50, 60 years ago, when my mother was in high school, they had bulldozers and things out in the middle of the hill country back then.
[01:48:55.384 --> 01:48:57.646]  Now it's all built up city here in Austin.
[01:48:57.646 --> 01:49:00.048]  And they were building firebreaks.
[01:49:00.048 --> 01:49:05.894]  So when I go down what they call the Hill of Life off 360 sometimes, it's about, you know, three-tenths of a mile down and up,
[01:49:06.926 --> 01:49:09.827]  It's this big, wide, 40 foot across.
[01:49:09.827 --> 01:49:14.249]  That was a firebreak that was built back in the 60s.
[01:49:14.249 --> 01:49:15.289]  So here's what's profound.
[01:49:15.289 --> 01:49:19.951]  And I've spent a lot of time on this today because if people can get this, they can get it all.
[01:49:19.951 --> 01:49:20.991]  Now there's a whole lot of awesome.
[01:49:20.991 --> 01:49:24.872]  That is the firebreak.
[01:49:24.872 --> 01:49:35.536]  That Trump comes out and tells us things that are like telling you put your jacket on when it's 10 below or brush your teeth.
[01:49:37.014 --> 01:49:38.575]  And the media goes, he's crazy.
[01:49:38.575 --> 01:49:40.675]  He's saying, cut brush.
[01:49:40.675 --> 01:49:41.636]  Cut roads.
[01:49:41.636 --> 01:49:45.537]  He thinks roads will fix it.
[01:49:45.537 --> 01:49:53.280]  You gotta ask yourself, what type of people are going against dams and firebreaks and family and free market and things that work?
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:58.162]  Big global corporations that want you to not have a successful economy and a successful system.
[01:49:58.162 --> 01:49:59.302]  So here's the key to everything.
[01:49:59.302 --> 01:50:02.904]  I'm gonna show it right now.
[01:50:02.904 --> 01:50:03.484]  Let's show
[01:50:04.690 --> 01:50:15.142]  The United Nations Biological Diversity Maps that were shown to Congress in 1992, they did not pass this, but George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to it, and it was still implemented, even though it wasn't ratified.
[01:50:15.142 --> 01:50:19.467]  Now all the areas in red are zero human activity.
[01:50:20.027 --> 01:50:23.349]  Little to no human use, core reserves, and corridors.
[01:50:23.349 --> 01:50:25.931]  Now let's zoom in for TV viewers on California.
[01:50:25.931 --> 01:50:32.415]  The exact map of where the giant fires are in the last few years, where everything's been burned down.
[01:50:32.415 --> 01:50:34.757]  Notice, it's so exact!
[01:50:36.989 --> 01:50:57.317]  It's the state and federal land where for 30 years trees and bushes and tumbleweeds and grass and leaves have been piling up so that when lightning strikes it creates infernos of 200 foot high fire that jump highways, everything else.
[01:50:57.317 --> 01:51:06.361]  So we just, TV viewer, we just overlaid the UN map of what will be off limits to humans with the map of what
[01:51:08.035 --> 01:51:19.285]  The BLM and the state of California have said for 30 years you cannot cut a fire break, you cannot do a controlled burn, you cannot remove one tree or it's a felony.
[01:51:19.285 --> 01:51:20.506]  Like a tree's a bald eagle.
[01:51:20.506 --> 01:51:24.309]  Tree falls over, can't harvest it, can't use it.
[01:51:24.309 --> 01:51:26.291]  And then you wonder why this has happened.
[01:51:26.291 --> 01:51:28.113]  And then you ask the next question, well what's going on here?
[01:51:29.738 --> 01:51:34.621]  Well, actually, I covered my first film in 1997, America's Robot Design.
[01:51:34.621 --> 01:51:40.405]  The IMF, the World Bank, they said, all over the world, we'll take away traditional fire breaks.
[01:51:40.405 --> 01:51:47.870]  And fire management, and in the areas we want, we'll allow fire management in the rest of California, in the rest of other western states.
[01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:48.770]  It's all selective.
[01:51:48.770 --> 01:51:51.852]  They create the maps.
[01:51:51.852 --> 01:51:59.217]  You look at the BLM and the state maps, federal and state maps of California, of where they don't let people
[01:52:01.405 --> 01:52:04.347]  Burn!
[01:52:04.347 --> 01:52:11.253]  And it's all the areas where there's poor people or farmers living, where they'll jump and burn you out and they can buy you up.
[01:52:11.253 --> 01:52:12.394]  Take Klamath Falls, Oregon.
[01:52:12.394 --> 01:52:14.816]  Northern California is right on the border there.
[01:52:14.816 --> 01:52:16.598]  They have huge mountains there.
[01:52:16.598 --> 01:52:24.564]  Huge dams built in the 50s and 60s to create reservoirs for that fruit basket and all the...
[01:52:26.201 --> 01:52:31.003]  Vegetables that come out of Northern California, Southern Oregon.
[01:52:31.003 --> 01:52:32.784]  Well, what did they do?
[01:52:32.784 --> 01:52:47.712]  Well, that Biological Diversity Treaty of 1992 that W's daddy signed on to, Herbert Walker, they laid it all off limits and said a sucker fish in those high lakes was endangered even though it was invasive and was from Asia.
[01:52:47.712 --> 01:52:49.933]  How could it be endangered if it was from Asia and isn't?
[01:52:49.933 --> 01:52:53.615]  So they wouldn't let the farmers, even though it was full of water up in the high mountain lakes,
[01:52:54.736 --> 01:53:02.740]  Have the water from the dams for decades till almost all of them, 90 plus percent have moved out.
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:06.562]  And now the big banks are moving in and buying it up.
[01:53:06.562 --> 01:53:09.023]  And they're going to have a city there.
[01:53:09.023 --> 01:53:13.406]  So they see California as prime area and they've got ways to get rid of farmers.
[01:53:13.406 --> 01:53:19.189]  All they do is say, you can't have that high mountain water from the snow runoff we built dams for.
[01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:20.189]  It's a fish.
[01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:22.270]  They didn't even pick a fish that was in danger.
[01:53:22.270 --> 01:53:23.611]  They just said sucker fish.
[01:53:25.336 --> 01:53:26.416]  That's the same thing.
[01:53:26.416 --> 01:53:37.580]  They've got computer maps, and they know lightning strikes, and they know there's high winds in California in the high desert, and they say, nobody can cut any more fire breaks or clean out brush.
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:39.601]  It's a felony if you carry out one piece of wood.
[01:53:40.575 --> 01:53:44.316]  And then you wonder why the fires get worse and worse and worse.
[01:53:44.316 --> 01:53:47.638]  And it's burning down all the houses through that whole corridor.
[01:53:47.638 --> 01:53:58.942]  And now the Democrats are announcing a plan to buy up your property for lower than cost, set part of it aside for wild land, which only makes the property they keep even more valuable.
[01:53:58.942 --> 01:54:00.683]  Think, oh, how nice they are.
[01:54:00.683 --> 01:54:01.343]  They did this in Austin.
[01:54:01.343 --> 01:54:07.045]  They took over 500,000 acres from farmers and ranchers that I knew outside Austin 30 years ago.
[01:54:07.045 --> 01:54:08.446]  It's part of the reason I got involved politically.
[01:54:09.793 --> 01:54:11.314]  First, they'd say you can't use it.
[01:54:11.314 --> 01:54:12.254]  They put fines on you.
[01:54:12.254 --> 01:54:14.856]  You'd sell for every 10 cents on the dollar.
[01:54:14.856 --> 01:54:16.197]  They didn't even wait five years.
[01:54:16.197 --> 01:54:18.478]  Two, three years later, they took the restrictions off.
[01:54:18.478 --> 01:54:25.802]  They built million dollar, $10 million homes, golf courses all over around Austin.
[01:54:25.802 --> 01:54:28.704]  But they took it under the Edwards Aquifer Recharge District.
[01:54:28.704 --> 01:54:31.245]  It had nothing to do with water.
[01:54:31.245 --> 01:54:33.887]  They took it and they built high-rises on it.
[01:54:33.887 --> 01:54:36.368]  But they did it in the name of rewilding.
[01:54:38.843 --> 01:55:00.667]  So this is the total issue of a microcosm, to give you a window in, and Trump comes along and goes, we own hotels in Europe and they tell us by law we gotta put firebreaks and cut the woods back and put berms up, and the military does that, and everybody I know that's a farmer does that, but now there's a law, that's bad management.
[01:55:00.667 --> 01:55:04.228]  They go, you crazy person!
[01:55:04.228 --> 01:55:05.828]  There's no such thing as a firebreak.
[01:55:06.972 --> 01:55:07.572]  Think about it.
[01:55:07.572 --> 01:55:12.334]  We can't even have firebreaks, except in the rest of California that Globalist own.
[01:55:12.334 --> 01:55:13.195]  They got firebreaks.
[01:55:13.195 --> 01:55:14.295]  They do that all.
[01:55:14.295 --> 01:55:15.816]  It's the areas they don't control.
[01:55:15.816 --> 01:55:19.137]  They can selectively say, no firebreak, no firebreak, no firebreak.
[01:55:19.137 --> 01:55:20.558]  You're just thinking, well, that's bad management.
[01:55:20.558 --> 01:55:22.659]  That's not bad management.
[01:55:22.659 --> 01:55:25.220]  They're going to burn you out.
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:28.421]  And they just did it.
[01:55:28.421 --> 01:55:33.023]  And then Trump shows up and says, we ought to start doing this again.
[01:55:33.023 --> 01:55:35.024]  And they act like he's got 12 heads.
[01:55:36.482 --> 01:55:40.605]  And it's molesting babies on the 4th of July.
[01:55:40.605 --> 01:55:42.347]  And that, my friends, is the rest of the story.
[01:55:42.347 --> 01:55:46.890]  Now, you know Eric Swallowswell out of California has called for total ban on all semi-autos.
[01:55:46.890 --> 01:55:48.111]  That's really the big news.
[01:55:48.111 --> 01:55:50.073]  Then he said we'll use nukes on people who don't submit.
[01:55:50.073 --> 01:55:56.778]  Joe Biggs, who first got in a Twitter argument with him, former Infowars.com reporter, will be joining us next hour.
[01:55:56.778 --> 01:55:57.499]  But don't forget this.
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:08.126]  Just like our information's game-changing, the products we bring you are game-changing, and I bring you only the best water filtration systems, gravity-fed.
[01:56:08.126 --> 01:56:11.689]  And out of the dozens of brands, there's only two that are really top-of-the-line.
[01:56:11.689 --> 01:56:13.310]  And that's Alexa Pure and Pro Pure.
[01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:16.853]  They're both apples and oranges, but some are better at this, some are better at that, but they're both top-of-the-line.
[01:56:16.853 --> 01:56:19.255]  It's very hard to tell which one's the best.
[01:56:19.255 --> 01:56:22.197]  We sell both at infowarsstore.com.
[01:56:22.197 --> 01:56:24.899]  And I'm the biggest national distributor of both.
[01:56:24.899 --> 01:56:28.422]  But Alexa Pure has the Alexa Pure Pro.
[01:56:29.485 --> 01:56:33.506]  And they bought 10,000 too many, projected out to the end of the year.
[01:56:33.506 --> 01:56:35.047]  They have 2,000 left.
[01:56:35.047 --> 01:56:37.827]  They don't want to pay tax on inventory.
[01:56:37.827 --> 01:56:41.808]  They are selling them to us at $95, $96.
[01:56:41.808 --> 01:56:43.349]  That's their cost.
[01:56:43.349 --> 01:56:45.830]  We're selling them for $126.
[01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:48.630]  We make like 30 bucks.
[01:56:48.630 --> 01:56:50.251]  Leading competitors aren't even as good.
[01:56:50.251 --> 01:56:52.992]  They're $300, $400 for the big, nice stainless steel.
[01:56:52.992 --> 01:56:54.972]  The Pro's their biggest unit.
[01:56:54.972 --> 01:56:55.712]  We normally sell it at $245.
[01:56:55.712 --> 01:56:56.352]  $246 is a great deal.
[01:56:59.008 --> 01:57:01.711]  Discounted, we sell it at $200.
[01:57:01.711 --> 01:57:04.354]  I even said, I don't want to do this deal because it undercuts the market down the road.
[01:57:04.354 --> 01:57:05.155]  We sell it at this price.
[01:57:05.155 --> 01:57:07.857]  People aren't going to appreciate how good these units are.
[01:57:07.857 --> 01:57:09.399]  They said, well, listen, Alex, it's a favor.
[01:57:09.399 --> 01:57:11.241]  You're a biggest seller.
[01:57:11.241 --> 01:57:12.422]  We ordered too many of these.
[01:57:12.422 --> 01:57:13.944]  We don't want to pay the tax on it.
[01:57:13.944 --> 01:57:17.728]  It's kind of like you hear car dealership ads at the end of the year, which are real, where they go, oh, $5,000 off stuff.
[01:57:17.728 --> 01:57:20.170]  Biggest seller of the year because we don't want to pay inventory.
[01:57:21.195 --> 01:57:30.201]  This is the same deal, and they've got like a thousand left of these at InfoWareStore.com, and then they're going to go back to full price, which is still a great deal, $240.
[01:57:30.201 --> 01:57:34.884]  But, I mean, no one's ever got a deal like this.
[01:57:34.884 --> 01:57:35.885]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:57:35.885 --> 01:57:38.967]  Alexa Pure Pro Water Protection System, InfoWareStore.com.
[01:57:38.967 --> 01:57:40.548]  It's a great Christmas gift as well.
[01:57:40.548 --> 01:57:43.570]  Cut out the glyphosates, the chemicals, well water, tap water, you name it.
[01:57:43.570 --> 01:57:45.111]  Everybody's going to be full to their water.
[01:57:45.111 --> 01:57:45.932]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:53.292]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[01:57:53.292 --> 01:57:54.893]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[01:57:54.893 --> 01:57:55.533]  It's a good thing.
[01:57:55.533 --> 01:57:59.115]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[01:57:59.115 --> 01:58:01.496]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[01:58:01.496 --> 01:58:02.997]  I learned what the best was.
[01:58:02.997 --> 01:58:08.140]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:08.680]  It's amazing.
[01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:11.423]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[01:58:11.423 --> 01:58:18.291]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:19.933]  He has a glut of them.
[01:58:19.933 --> 01:58:22.255]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[01:58:23.797 --> 01:58:27.281]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[01:58:27.281 --> 01:58:28.302]  It's $127!
[01:58:28.302 --> 01:58:32.466]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[01:58:32.466 --> 01:58:34.588]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[01:58:34.588 --> 01:58:36.930]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[01:58:36.930 --> 01:58:37.531]  It's amazing.
[01:58:37.531 --> 01:58:43.557]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:58:48.841 --> 01:58:56.304]  Monday through next Sunday, we are bringing back the biggest sales in our history.
[01:58:56.304 --> 01:59:00.586]  Black Friday InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:59:00.586 --> 01:59:06.128]  Up to 50% off on storable food, super high quality, that is huge.
[01:59:06.128 --> 01:59:08.449]  All InfoWars Life supplements, 50% off.
[01:59:10.991 --> 01:59:18.835]  127 or 49% off Alexa Pure Pro Gravity Fed Filters, Alexa Pure Breeze, Air Filtration.
[01:59:18.835 --> 01:59:20.036]  Now at 40% off.
[01:59:20.036 --> 01:59:21.356]  That's right at Lost Leader.
[01:59:21.356 --> 01:59:22.597]  Again, to get rid of inventory.
[01:59:22.597 --> 01:59:23.538]  So take advantage of that.
[01:59:23.538 --> 01:59:24.818]  It's an amazing system.
[01:59:24.818 --> 01:59:26.199]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars.
[01:59:26.199 --> 01:59:27.260]  They're trying to defund us.
[01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:29.681]  So I said, everything must go by the end of the year.
[01:59:29.981 --> 01:59:34.243]  So that we'll at least have the cash to continue operating for a while.
[01:59:34.243 --> 01:59:39.365]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:39.365 --> 01:59:44.327]  Support the InfoWars, get great products, get your Christmas shopping done early, and battle the globalists.
[01:59:44.327 --> 01:59:46.588]  A total 360 win at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:46.588 --> 01:59:51.890]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:54.551]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.133 --> 02:00:09.334]  Joe Biggs.
[02:00:09.334 --> 02:00:16.816]  Coming up, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:00:16.816 --> 02:00:22.098]  Yeah, next segment, Swallowswell out in California was saying ban all semi-autos.
[02:00:22.098 --> 02:00:26.160]  So Joe Biggs, former InfoWars.com reporter, great patriot, veteran, said, man, this is going to cause a war.
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:28.300]  Well, Swallowswell said, we'll nuke your ass.
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:32.442]  Joe's coming up next segment, but here's a report from Paul Watson, the truth about Brexit.
[02:00:32.442 --> 02:00:32.942]  It's powerful.
[02:00:33.916 --> 02:00:38.397]  Let's be honest, this whole thing was designed to fail from the very beginning.
[02:00:38.397 --> 02:00:42.639]  Theresa May never intended to dignify the referendum result.
[02:00:42.639 --> 02:00:46.540]  I warned that they were going to stab us all in the back from day one.
[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:49.541]  Theresa May deliberately negotiated a crappy deal.
[02:00:49.961 --> 02:00:54.884]  Knowing it would be rejected so as to create the pretext for cancelling Brexit.
[02:00:54.884 --> 02:01:05.730]  If you enter into a negotiation with no limits on the length to which you'll compromise, that's not a negotiation, that's a capitulation, that's surrender from the start.
[02:01:05.730 --> 02:01:09.251]  This has been one long process in managed surrender.
[02:01:09.251 --> 02:01:17.116]  My right honourable friend, and she is unquestionably honourable, said that we would leave the customs union.
[02:01:17.116 --> 02:01:19.237]  Annex 2 says otherwise.
[02:01:20.066 --> 02:01:24.972]  My Right Honourable Friend said that she would maintain the integrity of the United Kingdom.
[02:01:24.972 --> 02:01:28.135]  A whole protocol says otherwise.
[02:01:28.135 --> 02:01:34.142]  My Right Honourable Friend said that we would be out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
[02:01:34.142 --> 02:01:34.703]  Article 174 says otherwise.
[02:01:38.223 --> 02:01:43.148]  That's what my right honourable friend says, and what my right honourable friend does no longer match.
[02:01:43.148 --> 02:01:44.250]  This is not Brexit.
[02:01:44.250 --> 02:01:46.272]  This is a failure of government policy.
[02:01:46.272 --> 02:01:47.353]  It needs to be rejected.
[02:01:47.353 --> 02:01:55.842]  I mean, for God's sake, her chief negotiator, the guy cutting the deal, Ollie Robbins, was a staunch communist who defended Stalin.
[02:01:55.842 --> 02:01:57.044]  What did you expect?
[02:01:57.264 --> 02:02:03.587]  Now, Theresa May is threatening no Brexit whatsoever if her f***ing sandwich of a deal gets rejected.
[02:02:03.587 --> 02:02:04.427]  Which it will!
[02:02:04.427 --> 02:02:06.228]  And that was the plan all along.
[02:02:06.228 --> 02:02:10.469]  I knew this is what would happen because it's a tried and tested EU model.
[02:02:10.469 --> 02:02:14.291]  Give people the illusion of choice, the facsimile of democracy.
[02:02:14.291 --> 02:02:15.091]  Let them vote.
[02:02:15.091 --> 02:02:18.833]  But if their vote defies the EU, just sabotage the process.
[02:02:19.173 --> 02:02:23.760]  Or make them vote again and again and again until you get the result you want.
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:34.556]  Citizens across the continent voted to reject the Maastricht Treaty, to reject the Nice Treaty, to reject the EU Constitution, to reject the Lisbon Treaty, to reject the Euro bailout.
[02:02:34.756 --> 02:02:42.185]  Every time the votes were ignored, emphasizing the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the European Union.
[02:02:42.185 --> 02:02:50.075]  We are being asked to sign up to a deal that doesn't really give us Brexit, that portrays the greatest democratic exercise in this country.
[02:02:50.075 --> 02:02:54.120]  But I have to say, tonight, I'm feeling more optimistic.
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:56.821]  I'm seeing the resignations.
[02:02:56.821 --> 02:03:04.822]  I think we're getting close to the end of the worst and most duplicitous Prime Minister in British history and that will give us a chance for a fresh start.
[02:03:04.822 --> 02:03:11.584]  This is also about punishing the UK to intimidate other European countries out of pursuing their own form of Brexit.
[02:03:11.584 --> 02:03:16.745]  This is nothing less than a complete and total betrayal of democracy.
[02:03:16.745 --> 02:03:17.085]  We didn't
[02:03:17.225 --> 02:03:21.712]  Vote to sign up to everything under a different name and be the EU's bitch.
[02:03:21.712 --> 02:03:24.136]  We voted to leave the EU.
[02:03:24.136 --> 02:03:27.221]  This deal de facto keeps us in the EU.
[02:03:27.221 --> 02:03:32.249]  But with no say and no influence, it turns us into a slave state.
[02:03:32.469 --> 02:03:36.773]  And on top of that, we're handing over £39 billion for the privilege.
[02:03:36.773 --> 02:03:38.755]  We're the prostitutes in this exchange.
[02:03:38.755 --> 02:03:41.138]  We're the ones getting bent over and screwed.
[02:03:41.138 --> 02:03:42.519]  Yet we're paying them.
[02:03:42.519 --> 02:03:47.424]  This deal is so awful that we'd be better off staying in the EU.
[02:03:47.424 --> 02:03:49.186]  And that was the plan all along.
[02:03:49.386 --> 02:03:54.409]  Now they're going to push for a second referendum which includes the option of cancelling Brexit.
[02:03:54.409 --> 02:04:00.732]  An option that will serve as a death sentence for the very notion of Great Britain as a democratic country.
[02:04:00.732 --> 02:04:10.678]  Having stuck in the knife, May and her globalist cabal are now twisting it by putting the country at risk of the chilling prospect of being ruled by Jeremy Corbyn.
[02:04:10.678 --> 02:04:16.581]  A terrorist sympathiser who thinks that Venezuela's socialist dystopia is a model for the world.
[02:04:16.721 --> 02:04:18.583]  The choice is now clear.
[02:04:18.583 --> 02:04:28.131]  We stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom, or we vote for a vassal state with the breakup of the United Kingdom.
[02:04:28.131 --> 02:04:28.932]  That's the choice!
[02:04:28.932 --> 02:04:33.676]  Theresa May never represented the interests of the United Kingdom to begin with.
[02:04:34.056 --> 02:04:36.537]  So how on earth is she still in power?
[02:04:36.537 --> 02:04:37.558]  This is it.
[02:04:37.558 --> 02:04:45.722]  This is our last chance to appoint a leader whose loyalties lie with their country, not with a gaggle of odious technocrats in Brussels.
[02:04:45.722 --> 02:04:50.905]  This is the last chance for Britain to avoid disappearing down a hard left hellhole.
[02:04:50.905 --> 02:04:55.007]  This is the last chance for Britain to avoid the constitutional crisis.
[02:04:56.578 --> 02:04:58.919]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[02:06:32.103 --> 02:06:53.392]  Ladies and gentlemen, Eric Swallowswell, the globalist Democrat out of California, on the Intelligence Committee, that said that Tucker Carlson was a Russian agent with no proof, just an absolute un-American criminal, covering up for Hillary and the real Russian collusion, Uranium One, Mueller delivering uranium on tarmacs.
[02:06:53.392 --> 02:06:58.494]  He has come out and said, we want to ban all semi-autos, and all over the country.
[02:06:59.428 --> 02:07:02.089]  We've got a report coming up after Joe Biggs leaves us.
[02:07:02.089 --> 02:07:03.850]  The police are saying they don't want to do this.
[02:07:03.850 --> 02:07:07.071]  They're being sent to people's houses at 5 a.m., 4 a.m.
[02:07:07.071 --> 02:07:09.531]  to confiscate legal guns and people don't know what's happening.
[02:07:09.531 --> 02:07:12.332]  They're getting killed and cops are getting killed.
[02:07:12.332 --> 02:07:15.854]  Well, if this really sets off a chain reaction, we're going to have a big problem.
[02:07:15.854 --> 02:07:16.894]  I don't want anybody to get killed.
[02:07:16.894 --> 02:07:18.535]  It's law-abiding.
[02:07:18.535 --> 02:07:22.156]  But when tyrants write the laws, I guess tyranny's law, so it's your duty to resist it.
[02:07:22.912 --> 02:07:24.453]  We're coming to that point.
[02:07:24.453 --> 02:07:29.155]  But Eric swallows well or swallows well as he's known, he swallows tyranny well or tries to get us to.
[02:07:29.155 --> 02:07:35.677]  Joe Biggs tweeted him when he said ban all the semiotas and he said, hey we'll nuke your ass, submit, we are the board.
[02:07:35.677 --> 02:07:38.779]  Here's Dan Bongino and others covering it on Fox News.
[02:07:38.779 --> 02:07:41.300]  Calling for a certain, a ban on certain guns.
[02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:49.063]  Well social media erupted in response with one user replying in part, so basically Congressman Swalwell wants a war because that's what you would get.
[02:07:49.656 --> 02:07:54.439]  The congressman responding with a tweet saying, I mean, this may be the single dumbest tweet in the history of the Twitters.
[02:07:54.439 --> 02:07:55.660]  I mean, who tweets this?
[02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:56.801]  No less a United States congressman.
[02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:12.971]  Just some background on this, though, Jedediah.
[02:08:12.971 --> 02:08:22.257]  Congressman Swalwell, months ago, had proposed the idea of legislation to confiscate firearms from legal gun owners to take away weapons.
[02:08:22.257 --> 02:08:25.358]  So there's actual background to this story.
[02:08:25.358 --> 02:08:28.820]  So the story came up again, and that's how he got in this back and forth.
[02:08:28.820 --> 02:08:31.562]  But, I mean, he wants to run for president in 2020.
[02:08:31.562 --> 02:08:32.903]  What's his slogan going to be?
[02:08:32.903 --> 02:08:36.124]  Like, Swalwell 2020, we've got the nukes?
[02:08:36.124 --> 02:08:38.265]  I mean, this is the liberal mindset that we should...
[02:08:39.326 --> 02:08:53.460]  So Joe Biggs joins us for the rest of the hour, and we'll cover the waterfront with Joe, military veteran, InfoWars reporter, correspondent, and he still corresponds, but he's doing his own thing at americantriggerpullers.com out in Florida, spending more time with his family, which we respect.
[02:08:54.656 --> 02:09:01.580]  I want to go over the Twitter storm against him, to say you don't use nukes on a civilian population unless it's a whole country in rebellion.
[02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:03.641]  You don't nuke L.A.
[02:09:03.641 --> 02:09:07.703]  because a million people won't turn their guns in out of six million.
[02:09:07.703 --> 02:09:11.746]  Just the arrogance of this guy really blew up in his face.
[02:09:11.746 --> 02:09:17.909]  We had nukes but couldn't beat the Vietnamese in a 15-year war in Vietnam.
[02:09:17.909 --> 02:09:18.970]  There's so many angles.
[02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:21.731]  But then he tried to walk it back.
[02:09:21.731 --> 02:09:28.873]  But to me, Joe, I'm glad you engaged him and got him to say this, but really it's the fact that he wants to ban all semi-autos.
[02:09:28.873 --> 02:09:36.515]  According to their definition, that's more than half the firearms out there that only kill a few hundred people a year in illegal activity.
[02:09:36.515 --> 02:09:39.576]  The media hypes each event, but we're 330 million people.
[02:09:39.576 --> 02:09:44.197]  It's still one of the most rare ways to die is to be shot by a semi-automatic rifle.
[02:09:44.197 --> 02:09:45.458]  We don't lessen those that are killed.
[02:09:46.500 --> 02:09:48.468]  I'm certainly glad you engaged him on Twitter.
[02:09:48.468 --> 02:09:50.958]  You've been really kicking butt on Twitter, Joe.
[02:09:52.324 --> 02:09:59.230]  Yeah, I've gotten in spats with this guy numerous times on Twitter, arguing over gun control and things like that.
[02:09:59.230 --> 02:10:05.795]  Before, on Friday, I picked up my phone and I was like, I'm going to cruise through and see what I see on here.
[02:10:05.795 --> 02:10:17.785]  My buddy John Cardeo, he's a reporter out of Florida, he posted this old article that Swalwell, he did this op-ed, talking about how he wanted to go in and take guns from people.
[02:10:18.886 --> 02:10:21.107]  I saw that and my skin started to boil.
[02:10:21.107 --> 02:10:25.690]  My blood started to boil and I got angry and I threw my phone down on the bed and I said, I'm not even going to engage this.
[02:10:25.690 --> 02:10:29.092]  And I walked in the living room and I got so mad I ran back in my room.
[02:10:29.092 --> 02:10:29.813]  I grabbed my phone.
[02:10:29.813 --> 02:10:30.373]  I was like, you know what?
[02:10:30.373 --> 02:10:30.813]  Screw this.
[02:10:30.813 --> 02:10:31.734]  I got to talk to this guy.
[02:10:32.561 --> 02:10:33.862]  And I just started going off.
[02:10:33.862 --> 02:10:42.007]  I was like, man, I was like, if you were to actually do something like this, I mean, you're going to create more problems than the good that you think you're going to get out of it.
[02:10:42.007 --> 02:10:48.672]  I said, you would literally cause a war because what you're doing is, is you're a person who says you're, you know, you're sworn to uphold the constitution.
[02:10:48.672 --> 02:10:53.555]  And here you are telling me that I can't have something that is my constitutional right.
[02:10:53.555 --> 02:10:56.117]  But meanwhile, you'll go to bat for Acosta.
[02:10:56.117 --> 02:10:58.098]  It's Acosta's first amendment right.
[02:10:58.098 --> 02:11:02.181]  Donald Trump is violating the constitution by not allowing Acosta
[02:11:02.521 --> 02:11:06.124]  To go and sit in that White House press briefing.
[02:11:06.124 --> 02:11:10.967]  But it's okay in the same breath to go, I'm gonna take your guns away and there's nothing you can do about it.
[02:11:10.967 --> 02:11:12.869]  And if you don't, I'm gonna nuke your ass.
[02:11:12.869 --> 02:11:15.531]  I mean, that's just completely and totally ridiculous.
[02:11:15.531 --> 02:11:18.693]  Especially coming from a sitting congressman in California.
[02:11:18.693 --> 02:11:20.814]  I mean, how does this guy even still have a job?
[02:11:20.814 --> 02:11:22.396]  Why aren't people calling for this guy?
[02:11:22.396 --> 02:11:27.619]  And not only is he a congressman, he also plans to run for president in 2020.
[02:11:27.619 --> 02:11:29.321]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[02:11:29.921 --> 02:11:33.505]  Well, you're right, Joe Biggs, and people say, oh, he was just joking.
[02:11:33.505 --> 02:11:42.653]  No, he went on in more tweets and was like, well, hypothetically, we have more power than you, as if the people are separate from the government, as if you, you, you, let's say you nuked
[02:11:44.517 --> 02:11:46.819]  I mean, all the cities in Austin are now blue.
[02:11:46.819 --> 02:11:51.762]  Let's say you nuke Georgetown, a conservative city north of Austin, because they won't turn their guns in.
[02:11:51.762 --> 02:11:54.124]  You radiate thousands of miles around you.
[02:11:54.124 --> 02:12:08.194]  Just the idea that he sees the government as separate from the people, and he talks about using a war crime, just illustrates that this ruling class has all these weapons we paid for, and now it's worried about the peace shooters we have.
[02:12:08.194 --> 02:12:09.315]  They want total dominance.
[02:12:10.165 --> 02:12:21.432]  Well he told me, he finally replies and he goes, well because we have nukes, there's no way that a bunch of peasants, you know, like regular people, civilians, would even think about rising up with guns.
[02:12:21.432 --> 02:12:23.533]  And I go, have you even heard of insurgency?
[02:12:23.533 --> 02:12:24.974]  Have you seen what's happened in Iraq?
[02:12:24.974 --> 02:12:26.975]  Have you seen what's happened in Afghanistan?
[02:12:26.975 --> 02:12:37.542]  We have nuclear deterrent, yet it's not stopping people from continuously attacking our troops, continuously getting into battles and wars all the time on a daily basis.
[02:12:37.602 --> 02:12:44.705]  Bottom line, nuclear weapons are only good for mutually assured destruction or absolute, total genocide.
[02:12:44.705 --> 02:12:47.486]  And look, the Japanese wouldn't give up at the end of World War II.
[02:12:47.486 --> 02:12:52.028]  I'm not happy about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but I get we lost 300,000 troops in that fight.
[02:12:52.028 --> 02:12:53.729]  And we told them, give up, we have a super weapon.
[02:12:53.729 --> 02:12:54.370]  They didn't believe it.
[02:12:54.370 --> 02:12:55.630]  We dropped one on them.
[02:12:55.630 --> 02:12:56.751]  We dropped another the next day.
[02:12:56.751 --> 02:12:57.591]  They finally got it.
[02:12:57.591 --> 02:12:59.612]  But that was a tinker toy bomb.
[02:12:59.992 --> 02:13:01.273]  Compared to what they've got now.
[02:13:01.273 --> 02:13:05.835]  So here's the left that always says nukes are bad, but now they're foaming at the mouth to use it.
[02:13:05.835 --> 02:13:14.500]  Let's look at some of these incredible Twitter responses with former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and Infowars.com former reporter Joe Biggs here.
[02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:16.421]  Let's look at some of these.
[02:13:16.421 --> 02:13:16.782]  Wow!
[02:13:16.782 --> 02:13:20.063]  Still can't believe a member of our government said he'd nuke U.S.
[02:13:20.063 --> 02:13:22.245]  civilians refusing to hand over the guns.
[02:13:23.328 --> 02:13:32.536]  We've got Colonel Rob Maness, retired, says, well, Ed Swallowswell just disqualified himself from President of the United States, which he wants in 2020.
[02:13:32.536 --> 02:13:39.663]  Any elected official that would imply using the United States nuclear weapons against its own citizens to deprive them of their rights is insane.
[02:13:39.663 --> 02:13:41.945]  Not to mention he knows zero about warfare.
[02:13:41.945 --> 02:13:44.707]  Yeah, that's not the type of weapon you use for that.
[02:13:44.707 --> 02:13:47.410]  And again, it just shows their total ignorance even about how firearms work.
[02:13:48.210 --> 02:13:50.571]  Here's what Glenn Greenwald, a real liberal, said.
[02:13:50.571 --> 02:14:01.776]  Eric Swalwell is simply an idiot who's built a large-scale media hashtag resistance following by being the member of Congress willing to issue the most inflammatory, reckless, and extreme decrees about Russia and Trump.
[02:14:01.776 --> 02:14:04.297]  The easiest way to get noticed by the Dems.
[02:14:04.297 --> 02:14:06.558]  And there's a bunch of other ones that we can pull these up.
[02:14:06.558 --> 02:14:08.638]  There's one that shows Vietnamese troops fighting U.S.
[02:14:08.638 --> 02:14:11.460]  troops, which I'm not happy about, but happened.
[02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:14.221]  We had nukes and couldn't beat them because we were trying to conquer them.
[02:14:14.941 --> 02:14:19.446]  Reminds me of which side of the military he would be on, this imaginary war, says Scott Adams.
[02:14:19.446 --> 02:14:20.167]  Here it is.
[02:14:20.167 --> 02:14:21.808]  The government has nukes, it'll be a short war.
[02:14:21.808 --> 02:14:24.071]  Hiroshima, Nagasaki, August 6th, 1945.
[02:14:24.071 --> 02:14:26.093]  Vietnam War, November 1st, 55, April 30th, 1975.
[02:14:26.093 --> 02:14:27.694]  Years after the United States stated
[02:14:31.438 --> 02:14:37.788]  That had nukes and more advanced weaponry and still lost the Vietnamese farmers because it was their country.
[02:14:37.788 --> 02:14:39.771]  And again, I'm sad that all happened.
[02:14:39.771 --> 02:14:43.357]  I'm not siding with them, but that's just the fact.
[02:14:43.357 --> 02:14:45.640]  This guy has really jumped the shark, Joe Biggs.
[02:14:46.957 --> 02:14:53.001]  Yeah, I mean, I think he's nuked his chances at a presidential career in the future, you know.
[02:14:53.001 --> 02:14:54.903]  And it sparked a big debate again, which is good.
[02:14:54.903 --> 02:15:00.187]  It's always good to have these conversations, minus the threat of nuclear war by a sitting congressman.
[02:15:00.187 --> 02:15:03.769]  But this lady that works for Newsweek, she tweeted me.
[02:15:03.769 --> 02:15:08.773]  She goes, almost every single person I've ever heard of with an AR-15 has been a mass murderer.
[02:15:09.333 --> 02:15:10.894]  I mean, that's insane.
[02:15:10.894 --> 02:15:15.557]  Like, this is the kind of stuff that the left's spreading about law-abiding gun owners.
[02:15:15.557 --> 02:15:16.377]  I saw the numbers.
[02:15:16.377 --> 02:15:22.421]  They estimate 50 million Americans own an AR-15 M4 variant of some type.
[02:15:22.421 --> 02:15:25.063]  And what, we may have like 50 killers?
[02:15:25.063 --> 02:15:28.745]  So, 50 million are guilty, 60 million are guilty for a few people.
[02:15:30.998 --> 02:15:33.920]  Well, look, how many Islamists just drive trucks into people every day?
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:36.121]  We read about in Europe with almost no coverage.
[02:15:36.121 --> 02:15:38.042]  20 dead, 50 dead, 100 dead.
[02:15:38.042 --> 02:15:39.683]  We don't blame trucks.
[02:15:39.683 --> 02:15:41.864]  We blame the person driving the truck.
[02:15:41.864 --> 02:15:44.346]  The fact that there are these mentally ill people is one reason for us to have guns.
[02:15:44.346 --> 02:15:47.587]  By the way, what was the peak year for gun crime in the United States in gun deaths?
[02:15:47.587 --> 02:15:47.847]  1987.
[02:15:47.847 --> 02:15:48.828]  Look it up.
[02:15:48.828 --> 02:15:49.048]  1987.
[02:15:49.048 --> 02:15:50.729]  Up to a thousand deaths a day.
[02:15:55.387 --> 02:15:59.010]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[02:15:59.010 --> 02:16:06.355]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[02:16:06.355 --> 02:16:11.259]  And what if this social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[02:16:11.259 --> 02:16:12.099]  There is.
[02:16:12.099 --> 02:16:13.681]  It's RightSocial.net.
[02:16:13.681 --> 02:16:15.042]  RightSocial.net.
[02:16:15.042 --> 02:16:18.364]  A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order.

[02:16:21.887 --> 02:16:23.228]  RightSocial.net.
[02:16:23.228 --> 02:16:24.509]  The right place to be.
[02:16:25.586 --> 02:16:27.548]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:16:27.548 --> 02:16:32.851]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:16:32.851 --> 02:16:34.453]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:16:34.453 --> 02:16:42.799]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:16:42.799 --> 02:16:48.503]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[02:16:50.485 --> 02:16:52.748]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[02:18:00.776 --> 02:18:04.238]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:18:04.238 --> 02:18:06.019]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:18:06.019 --> 02:18:09.281]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:18:09.281 --> 02:18:16.065]  They just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:18:16.065 --> 02:18:21.148]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[02:18:21.488 --> 02:18:27.592]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:18:27.592 --> 02:18:30.574]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:18:30.574 --> 02:18:31.675]  I want to keep going.
[02:18:31.675 --> 02:18:35.498]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:18:35.498 --> 02:18:37.519]  I want to push all the way.
[02:18:37.519 --> 02:18:38.800]  I've committed to do that.
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:39.881]  I've prayed for that.
[02:18:39.881 --> 02:18:41.542]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:18:41.542 --> 02:18:43.964]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:18:44.444 --> 02:18:45.765]  I will never falter.
[02:18:45.765 --> 02:18:48.107]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:18:48.107 --> 02:18:49.048]  I physically will.
[02:18:49.048 --> 02:18:56.135]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then fullrestore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:18:56.135 --> 02:19:06.584]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:19:06.704 --> 02:19:08.787]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:19:08.787 --> 02:19:11.652]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:19:11.652 --> 02:19:13.134]  It's made in the USA.
[02:19:13.134 --> 02:19:19.985]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:19:19.985 --> 02:19:21.227]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[02:19:22.028 --> 02:19:31.735]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.735 --> 02:19:48.567]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:48.567 --> 02:19:51.729]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:19:51.869 --> 02:19:59.322]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:19:59.322 --> 02:20:01.926]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:11.565 --> 02:20:13.306]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:20:13.306 --> 02:20:26.332]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:26.332 --> 02:20:33.295]  Well, undoubtedly the biggest story of the last 48 hours since Friday afternoon is Joe Biggs,
[02:20:34.733 --> 02:20:47.596]  Simply tweeting back at Eric Swalwell, this Democrat, globalist, anti-gun commie, and saying, you want to ban all the semi-autos in an NBC interview?
[02:20:47.596 --> 02:20:48.717]  People are going to fight back.
[02:20:48.717 --> 02:20:49.437]  He goes, shut up.
[02:20:49.437 --> 02:20:50.077]  We got nukes.
[02:20:50.077 --> 02:20:51.577]  We'll dominate you.
[02:20:51.577 --> 02:20:55.378]  So no one cares that the Democrats are now more and more admitting they want to ban guns.
[02:20:55.378 --> 02:21:01.540]  But the fact that he said use nukes, even Huffington Post, even a bunch of leftist publications, Joe,
[02:21:02.833 --> 02:21:10.198]  Came to actually your defense and other people's defense and said, yeah, this is pretty fascistic to talk like this.
[02:21:10.198 --> 02:21:15.021]  What do you think the mindset is of this guy that, you know, he talks like this?
[02:21:16.186 --> 02:21:21.848]  Well, it's pretty horrifying, like I said, when you know that this guy is looking to run to be president in 2020.
[02:21:21.848 --> 02:21:40.653]  It's horrifying to think that a guy could run for the highest office and have that type of mindset, to be so anti-American, to be so anti-Constitution, and would want to take those rights away from people, and try to put police and military, these predicaments where they have to go do things like that.
[02:21:42.014 --> 02:21:50.486]  Thankfully, I know most police officers or most military would never go along with something like that, but you would always still have some, you know, some turncoats.
[02:21:50.486 --> 02:21:57.857]  But it's just frightening to think that a guy like that, that could reach that, you know, potential high office, has that type of mindset when dealing
[02:21:58.457 --> 02:22:02.662]  Again, you can't be trusted with a firearm, but he can be trusted with nukes he wants to use on you.
[02:22:02.662 --> 02:22:04.524]  Do people get the separation of power here?
[02:22:19.079 --> 02:22:19.660]  I don't know, man.
[02:22:19.660 --> 02:22:21.601]  This guy is a few far and beyond.
[02:22:21.601 --> 02:22:22.542]  He doesn't make any sense.
[02:22:22.542 --> 02:22:30.609]  I mean, that probably goes down in history as one of the dumbest things a politician has definitely ever said on Twitter.
[02:22:30.609 --> 02:22:32.731]  We'll put that.
[02:22:32.731 --> 02:22:35.293]  But it's just frightening in that you're seeing the shift with the left.
[02:22:35.293 --> 02:22:41.959]  I mean, we saw after the Parkland shootings here in Florida, you saw those kids come out on that stage and they said, you know what?
[02:22:42.583 --> 02:22:44.064]  They say that we're going to take guns.
[02:22:44.064 --> 02:22:45.885]  You know, you give us an inch, we're going to take a mile.
[02:22:45.885 --> 02:22:47.205]  We're going to take the guns.
[02:22:47.205 --> 02:23:00.832]  And now you see these politicians, these left-wing politicians, who are kind of trying to shift what they believe in their target audience, which are these kids that are starting to go far, far more left, Stalin.
[02:23:00.832 --> 02:23:03.214]  And they're starting to use that rhetoric now.
[02:23:03.214 --> 02:23:05.915]  Instead of saying, oh, we don't want to ban your guns, they're coming out and
[02:23:06.817 --> 02:23:08.539]  Well that's what's crazy is, I remember reading
[02:23:18.334 --> 02:23:25.716]  Democratic Party documents, CFR documents saying, once we register then we'll ban, we'll do it incrementally, but we gotta keep it secret.
[02:23:25.716 --> 02:23:31.117]  And now, they're just, in the Boston Globe, it's time to get rid of the Declaration of Independence.
[02:23:31.117 --> 02:23:32.878]  It's time to get rid of the First Amendment.
[02:23:32.878 --> 02:23:34.138]  It's time to get rid of the Second Amendment.
[02:23:34.138 --> 02:23:35.518]  It's time to disarm.
[02:23:35.518 --> 02:23:37.479]  You know, it's time to just arrest conservatives.
[02:23:37.479 --> 02:23:38.179]  These people...
[02:23:39.364 --> 02:23:41.386]  I don't want the Democrats to be villains.
[02:23:41.386 --> 02:23:44.388]  I'm not even a Republican, I'm just a patriot.
[02:23:44.388 --> 02:23:45.569]  What has happened to them, Joe?
[02:23:45.569 --> 02:23:47.331]  It seems like they've radicalized.
[02:23:47.331 --> 02:23:50.274]  Because I remember you were here like six years ago, started working on Infowars.
[02:23:51.354 --> 02:23:53.475]  And you come back from Iraq and all the rest of it.
[02:23:53.475 --> 02:23:56.396]  And I remember back then you even thought like I was a little extreme maybe.
[02:23:56.396 --> 02:23:57.197]  Okay, it's not that bad.
[02:23:57.197 --> 02:24:00.458]  And then later you got more radical than I was in my memory service.
[02:24:00.458 --> 02:24:02.099]  But what is the problem?
[02:24:02.099 --> 02:24:08.882]  Because now this stuff's so radical, it's like anti-foes at Tucker Carlson's house saying, we know where you live, we're going to get your kids.
[02:24:08.882 --> 02:24:10.703]  And then CNN defends it.
[02:24:10.703 --> 02:24:14.285]  I mean, at a certain point it's like, what the hell is going on here?
[02:24:15.037 --> 02:24:19.622]  It's getting so hostile it's forcing both sides to kind of become radicalized in a sense.
[02:24:19.622 --> 02:24:24.827]  You know, you've got the right going far right and you've got the left going far left and the people in the middle are getting trampled over.
[02:24:24.827 --> 02:24:34.577]  You know, it's almost like you've got to either stick your guns, you've got to be a hardcore constitutionalist, you've got to stand up for your First Amendment rights regardless, your guns, everything that you want.
[02:24:36.138 --> 02:24:40.161]  If you don't, you know, you're just a centrist guy.
[02:24:40.161 --> 02:24:40.802]  You're nothing.
[02:24:40.802 --> 02:24:41.582]  You're crap.
[02:24:41.582 --> 02:24:42.163]  You're a joke.
[02:24:42.163 --> 02:24:43.424]  You can't make up your mind.
[02:24:43.424 --> 02:24:46.046]  Let me ask you this.
[02:24:46.046 --> 02:24:49.669]  I mean, I know you're a guy that loves people black, white, brown, you name it.
[02:24:49.669 --> 02:24:52.831]  The media, the leftist media is like everywhere.
[02:24:52.831 --> 02:25:00.977]  I've got a report on Infowars.com where they're teaching kids in school that whites at public schools are inherently bad.
[02:25:00.977 --> 02:25:03.799]  It's all over the news that they're trying to create a race war
[02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:08.824]  And it's so incredibly sad to see everything Martin Luther King and others worked for being betrayed.
[02:25:08.824 --> 02:25:10.906]  Why do you think the left is going with this agenda?
[02:25:10.906 --> 02:25:13.008]  Because we're not about race-based politics.
[02:25:13.008 --> 02:25:16.972]  We're about freedom-based and ideas and free market unifying us.
[02:25:16.972 --> 02:25:22.177]  But the left is going with classical cultural Marxism and it's just so nasty.
[02:25:23.305 --> 02:25:25.645]  Yeah, I think it's going to get bad, I'd say, in about 10 years.
[02:25:25.645 --> 02:25:46.069]  Right now, we think it's bad, but like you said, this indoctrination, the stuff that they're teaching our kids, you know, the things that my daughter, when she's old enough to go into school here pretty soon, is going to start, they're going to start teaching these crazy things, and you know, it's going to be one of those things at home where you've got to sit down and you've got to reverse engineer this crap that they're trying to teach you, or to teach your kids and stuff.
[02:25:46.069 --> 02:25:51.270]  And I mean, I saw that video that Paul Joseph Watson did about that, where they're teaching these kids that, you know, white people are bad.
[02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:59.757]  That's horrible, and that's why I'm saying in about 10-15 years, this is when we're really going to see a lot of clashes and a lot of... just a lot of oil outcry.
[02:25:59.757 --> 02:26:00.377]  Well, that's it.
[02:26:00.377 --> 02:26:03.560]  I mean, the left has tested and tested, and we've put up with it.
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:05.882]  So now, they talk about the KKK.
[02:26:05.882 --> 02:26:06.782]  That's a bunch of losers.
[02:26:06.782 --> 02:26:11.266]  This is real powerful groups in public schools on YouTube.
[02:26:11.266 --> 02:26:16.770]  They're teaching this type of stuff, and it's just... it's just disgusting.
[02:26:16.770 --> 02:26:17.031]  So, Joe,
[02:26:21.601 --> 02:26:27.149]  You know, we talk about 15 years, 10 years from now, and we talk about fighting it and telling our kids this is wrong.
[02:26:27.149 --> 02:26:28.251]  And I'm the same way.
[02:26:28.251 --> 02:26:30.294]  I'm busy and my kids pick this stuff up.
[02:26:30.294 --> 02:26:32.637]  Even though I'm Alex Jones, they still pick up the BS.
[02:26:32.637 --> 02:26:36.042]  So I'm not like high and mighty or going, hey, we have to dip it in the bud.
[02:26:36.042 --> 02:26:36.783]  But what about.
[02:26:37.324 --> 02:26:40.288]  What Lou Dobbs talked about a few weeks ago that almost got him banned.
[02:26:40.288 --> 02:26:44.574]  Hey, the UN gets State Department money to fund these migrant hordes.
[02:26:44.574 --> 02:26:45.715]  Cut the funding.
[02:26:45.715 --> 02:26:47.718]  Or hey, cut the funding to schools that teach this.
[02:26:47.718 --> 02:26:53.425]  Instead of fighting the propaganda, how about we say as taxpayers, you don't get the funding to do all this crap.
[02:26:53.425 --> 02:26:54.387]  I think that's the answer.
[02:26:55.987 --> 02:26:56.667]  Yeah, it's a good way.
[02:26:56.667 --> 02:26:58.369]  You cut the money off and then they can't do that.
[02:26:58.369 --> 02:27:04.853]  They can't continue to grow and they can't continue to push out that propaganda and that left-wing extreme rhetoric that they're doing.
[02:27:04.853 --> 02:27:06.954]  You know, it's intense now.
[02:27:06.954 --> 02:27:09.355]  I mean, here, I used to live in Florida.
[02:27:09.355 --> 02:27:14.819]  I joined the Army in Florida in 2003, and this is really my first time back in, you know, a long time.
[02:27:14.819 --> 02:27:16.059]  And boy, has Florida changed.
[02:27:16.059 --> 02:27:18.461]  I mean, this used to be a pretty red state.
[02:27:18.461 --> 02:27:19.882]  I mean, it's on that purple
[02:27:20.242 --> 02:27:21.683]  It's the bullying!
[02:27:21.683 --> 02:27:23.264]  The left is like we're in Cuba!
[02:27:23.264 --> 02:27:25.965]  They just take like you're not allowed to be wearing a pro-gun shirt.
[02:27:25.965 --> 02:27:28.447]  And so now I catch myself doing it every day.
[02:27:28.447 --> 02:27:30.048]  I didn't used to but now I'm going to.
[02:27:41.007 --> 02:27:41.987]  Yeah, it's insane.
[02:27:41.987 --> 02:27:49.210]  I mean, like, last night, I decided to test the waters, and I wore one of my shirts that says, Make Democrats Cry Again.
[02:27:49.210 --> 02:27:50.871]  And this guy goes, what does that mean?
[02:27:50.871 --> 02:27:51.511]  What does that mean?
[02:27:51.511 --> 02:27:53.132]  Does that mean that you like Trump?
[02:27:53.132 --> 02:27:56.273]  Do you think that it's funny that he's destroying our country?
[02:27:56.273 --> 02:27:57.234]  I go, destroying our country?
[02:27:57.234 --> 02:27:59.715]  We have a booming economy.
[02:27:59.715 --> 02:28:01.475]  Unemployment, you know, through the roof.
[02:28:01.475 --> 02:28:03.796]  I mean, we're doing so good right now.
[02:28:03.796 --> 02:28:05.717]  Well, they're the ones that want to destroy it.
[02:28:05.717 --> 02:28:07.298]  These are conquerors.
[02:28:07.298 --> 02:28:09.619]  And those that are with them are camp followers who are
[02:28:10.259 --> 02:28:12.660]  Look, it's true, Joe.
[02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:14.961]  Democrats are not Americans.
[02:28:14.961 --> 02:28:15.961]  America's never been great.
[02:28:15.961 --> 02:28:17.021]  It'll never be that great.
[02:28:17.021 --> 02:28:17.802]  Cuomo.
[02:28:17.802 --> 02:28:23.844]  They literally have signed on to globalism, and we want to go, oh, free market, open ideas, free speech.
[02:28:23.844 --> 02:28:26.785]  They have their free speech, but they're not Americans.
[02:28:26.785 --> 02:28:29.166]  When I say that, folks, that's so profound.
[02:28:29.166 --> 02:28:31.187]  Dianne Feinstein and Michael Moore aren't Americans.
[02:28:31.187 --> 02:28:32.107]  They're globalists.
[02:28:32.107 --> 02:28:33.547]  Obama hates America.
[02:28:33.547 --> 02:28:37.629]  We'll come out with Joe Biden and talk about what do we do about a good 30% of the public
[02:28:38.509 --> 02:28:45.115]  Actually, their modus operandi, their operating system, their ethos is hating America.
[02:28:45.115 --> 02:28:47.557]  What do we do?
[02:28:47.557 --> 02:28:50.200]  We better take action or they're gonna win.
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:51.321]  We're down the line right now.
[02:28:55.347 --> 02:29:00.148]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[02:29:00.148 --> 02:29:06.009]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[02:29:06.009 --> 02:29:12.530]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[02:29:12.530 --> 02:29:16.571]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[02:29:16.571 --> 02:29:22.812]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to MinutemanStove.com.
[02:29:22.812 --> 02:29:24.572]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[02:29:25.092 --> 02:29:31.436]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:29:31.436 --> 02:29:34.478]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:29:34.478 --> 02:29:40.402]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:29:40.402 --> 02:29:44.205]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:29:44.205 --> 02:29:45.466]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:29:45.466 --> 02:29:46.807]  Who do we fight for?
[02:29:46.807 --> 02:29:53.011]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:29:53.011 --> 02:29:54.452]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:29:56.614 --> 02:30:02.261]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[02:30:02.261 --> 02:30:03.863]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[02:30:03.863 --> 02:30:04.503]  It's a good thing.
[02:30:04.503 --> 02:30:08.108]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[02:30:08.108 --> 02:30:10.490]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[02:30:10.490 --> 02:30:11.592]  I learned what the best was.
[02:30:11.972 --> 02:30:17.115]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[02:30:17.115 --> 02:30:17.836]  It's amazing.
[02:30:17.836 --> 02:30:20.397]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[02:30:20.397 --> 02:30:27.242]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[02:30:27.242 --> 02:30:28.923]  He has a glut of them.
[02:30:28.923 --> 02:30:31.224]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[02:30:32.745 --> 02:30:35.586]  Well, it's discounted usually $200.
[02:30:35.586 --> 02:30:37.267]  It's $127.
[02:30:37.267 --> 02:30:41.428]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making $20-something bucks on them.
[02:30:41.428 --> 02:30:43.569]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[02:30:43.569 --> 02:30:45.890]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[02:30:45.890 --> 02:30:46.490]  It's amazing.
[02:30:46.490 --> 02:30:52.512]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:30:56.374 --> 02:31:04.086]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[02:31:04.086 --> 02:31:04.567]  It's you!
[02:31:05.672 --> 02:31:08.154]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:31:08.154 --> 02:31:09.535]  You are the InfoWard.
[02:31:09.535 --> 02:31:12.458]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:31:26.810 --> 02:31:38.197]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:31:38.197 --> 02:31:46.183]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:31:46.183 --> 02:31:53.227]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:31:53.227 --> 02:31:55.969]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[02:31:57.975 --> 02:32:03.619]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:32:03.619 --> 02:32:06.761]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:32:06.761 --> 02:32:09.443]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:32:09.443 --> 02:32:13.726]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:32:13.726 --> 02:32:21.091]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:32:21.091 --> 02:32:23.633]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[02:32:27.074 --> 02:32:29.275]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:32:29.275 --> 02:32:32.316]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[02:32:32.316 --> 02:32:44.242]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:32:44.242 --> 02:32:46.523]  It's the David Knight Show!
[02:32:46.523 --> 02:32:49.624]  Never miss your show, any day.
[02:32:49.624 --> 02:32:50.445]  I mean, what?
[02:32:50.445 --> 02:32:51.425]  I mean, never!
[02:32:59.375 --> 02:33:15.179]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:15.179 --> 02:33:24.722]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.722 --> 02:33:25.002]  You know,
[02:33:26.305 --> 02:33:32.650]  I don't want to defend Trump like I do, because I don't want to be so completely committed to somebody.
[02:33:32.650 --> 02:33:36.894]  But, always, he's right.
[02:33:36.894 --> 02:33:40.637]  And always, the mainstream media represents what he's saying or doing.
[02:33:40.637 --> 02:33:42.899]  He says, build firebreaks!
[02:33:42.899 --> 02:33:47.182]  They got rid of the policy 30 years ago, it's burning down the West.
[02:33:47.182 --> 02:33:49.344]  And all the firefighter associations say he's right.
[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:52.361]  He says we gotta have a border with Mexico.
[02:33:52.361 --> 02:33:53.942]  There's a lot of criminals coming in.
[02:33:53.942 --> 02:33:55.183]  They say he hates all Mexicans.
[02:33:55.183 --> 02:33:58.044]  Never said it.
[02:33:58.044 --> 02:34:11.171]  And then I look at what they're currently doing in our own media sides with Communist China against America.
[02:34:11.171 --> 02:34:18.956]  And I look at how the left, when you tune into what they're writing or saying in public schools or college,
[02:34:20.060 --> 02:34:24.464]  It is the most Nazi.
[02:34:24.464 --> 02:34:28.387]  They call us Nazis all day and I thought, that's dumb they call us Nazis.
[02:34:28.387 --> 02:34:29.268]  They know that's not true.
[02:34:29.268 --> 02:34:33.011]  That's because they're the Nazis.
[02:34:33.011 --> 02:34:39.597]  I mean, I have a long time family friend going back to when I was a little kid.
[02:34:39.597 --> 02:34:45.562]  My best friend died about 10 years ago, but my best friend's mom, big family friend on all these trips with us and
[02:34:47.634 --> 02:34:57.822]  One of her granddaughters was part African-American or whatever, and I'm good friends with her, and she went to Southwest Texas University the last few years.
[02:34:57.822 --> 02:35:10.211]  She's graduating right now, and they literally come into class and say, Alex Jones is a white supremacist, and Alex Jones is a Nazi, and Alex Jones is fake news, and she's known me her whole life.
[02:35:11.297 --> 02:35:15.242]  Camped out with me, and been on boats with me, and eaten dinner with me probably 50 times.
[02:35:15.242 --> 02:35:19.847]  And she got pissed, and they said, listen, you shut your ass up, you get your, lose your degree.
[02:35:19.847 --> 02:35:27.336]  Well, that took her from being a liberal, for the good things liberals claim, to absolutely being against them.
[02:35:27.336 --> 02:35:28.898]  And I'm not going to say her name.
[02:35:28.898 --> 02:35:30.140]  She's a beautiful young woman.
[02:35:31.974 --> 02:35:32.995]  But that's the thing.
[02:35:32.995 --> 02:35:35.156]  She's like, I know Alex Jones.
[02:35:35.156 --> 02:35:39.219]  That professor said, a white woman, you shut your ass up right now.
[02:35:39.219 --> 02:35:40.460]  He's a Nazi.
[02:35:40.460 --> 02:35:42.542]  She said, no, he's not.
[02:35:42.542 --> 02:35:44.263]  What you just said about him is a lie.
[02:35:44.263 --> 02:35:53.329]  And that's why they want to censor us and silence us so they can say whatever they want about us and not be challenged.
[02:35:53.329 --> 02:35:59.814]  You know, Joe Biggs, taking our guns is a big deal.
[02:35:59.814 --> 02:36:00.835]  Because slaves are disarmed.
[02:36:02.748 --> 02:36:16.692]  It's always the sign of war, but the taking of the First Amendment and the way they've targeted conservatives and nationalists that becomes a campaign contribution of the Democrats.
[02:36:16.692 --> 02:36:18.933]  This is the only reason the Republicans didn't keep the House.
[02:36:18.933 --> 02:36:21.093]  They kept the Senate, which is historic.
[02:36:21.093 --> 02:36:22.574]  And we have to take action.
[02:36:22.574 --> 02:36:26.835]  And that's our biggest deficit is the average Republican doesn't know how this cyber stuff works.
[02:36:27.827 --> 02:36:33.649]  They won't even take Republican ads on Facebook or Twitter, on most of them, for Congress people.
[02:36:33.649 --> 02:36:34.670]  But they'll take Democrats.
[02:36:34.670 --> 02:36:37.951]  The fact that they let them do that is total discrimination.
[02:36:37.951 --> 02:36:39.571]  They go, oh, it's a private company.
[02:36:39.571 --> 02:36:42.233]  So newspapers won't take Republican ads either?
[02:36:42.233 --> 02:36:44.793]  Or if you're black, you can't rent a hotel room?
[02:36:44.793 --> 02:36:52.817]  This is so fundamental, and we've been free so long, the average conservative wants to play the part of kind of like, we're the establishment.
[02:36:52.817 --> 02:36:53.957]  We're not.
[02:36:53.957 --> 02:36:55.157]  We're the underdog.
[02:36:55.157 --> 02:36:56.318]  We better start acting like it, Joe.
[02:36:57.657 --> 02:37:00.919]  Yeah, I mean, you gotta look at the entire political spectrum right now.
[02:37:00.919 --> 02:37:02.660]  It's all changed after we elected Trump.
[02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:13.645]  I mean, you know, the typical boring, total line, you know, Christian, I'm married and I have a wife, you know, and I've got a dog and three kids and I was a vet.
[02:37:13.645 --> 02:37:18.588]  Like, that same kind of mentality these politicians use in all their videos doesn't work anymore.
[02:37:19.028 --> 02:37:24.191]  You know, people on the right need to realize that it's all shifting and changing.
[02:37:24.191 --> 02:37:34.658]  And if you really want to reach some of these younger people that are in college right now, and they're being brainwashed to go left, and there's many of them that are starting to think for themselves, and they're going, I want to go right, but it looks boring.
[02:37:34.658 --> 02:37:37.920]  I mean, Republicans at the end of the day are milquetoast most of the time.
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:39.361]  They're so boring.
[02:37:39.361 --> 02:37:42.703]  But you see a guy like Trump, man, he's so different, he's so energetic.
[02:37:43.123 --> 02:37:44.825]  A friend of mine the other day asked... Because he's a populist.
[02:37:44.825 --> 02:37:46.486]  He's not... I don't know exactly.
[02:37:46.486 --> 02:37:50.991]  There's nothing more boring than liberals obsessed with what Halloween costume you're wearing.
[02:37:50.991 --> 02:37:52.652]  Why are we letting them be the cool people?
[02:37:52.652 --> 02:37:53.213]  They're not.
[02:37:53.213 --> 02:37:54.254]  They're super uncool.
[02:37:56.011 --> 02:37:56.451]  Exactly.
[02:37:56.451 --> 02:37:59.773]  I mean, we need to really rethink our approach to politics.
[02:37:59.773 --> 02:38:08.437]  We need to really rethink our approach to how we push out our messages as conservatives, as Republicans, as right-wingers, whatever you are.
[02:38:08.437 --> 02:38:12.479]  We've really got to change that narrative and we need to come out there attacking hard.
[02:38:12.479 --> 02:38:14.961]  I mean, look at Brian Kemp's ads.
[02:38:14.961 --> 02:38:20.363]  He is the only right-wing person that I saw, the guy that ran for governor in Georgia and finally won.
[02:38:22.024 --> 02:38:23.445]  His ads were amazing.
[02:38:23.445 --> 02:38:24.786]  They were hilarious.
[02:38:24.786 --> 02:38:26.227]  You could relate to it.
[02:38:26.227 --> 02:38:29.009]  At the end of the day, I mean, I thought about the ad throughout the day.
[02:38:29.009 --> 02:38:35.913]  And I live in Florida and I'm thinking about, you know, this guy that's running for governor in Georgia because his ads really hit home.
[02:38:35.913 --> 02:38:41.697]  You know, he's like, yeah, I got a gun because when my daughter starts dating, I want to make sure that there's a good guy coming around.
[02:38:41.697 --> 02:38:51.224]  Or I drive a truck because at least, you know, in case I come up around, you know, a bunch of migrants that are illegals, I can take them to the border patrol station and have them deported or whatever like that.
[02:38:51.224 --> 02:38:51.424]  You know,
[02:38:51.864 --> 02:38:58.173]  He's using these current events... He took the fake political correctness that will obviously we're not doing that and made it a joke.
[02:38:59.008 --> 02:39:02.811]  Yeah, exactly, and that's good, and that's what people on the right are going to have to start doing.
[02:39:02.811 --> 02:39:05.593]  Everyone's like, we have to be in the high ground, we have to take the high ground.
[02:39:05.593 --> 02:39:13.099]  Well, there's a war going on, there's people in the trenches, and the only ones that are coming out right now, the ones that are, you know, taking control, are the ones willing to get down there and get dirty.
[02:39:13.099 --> 02:39:13.920]  No, I totally agree.
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:23.127]  The whole blue blood thing, which is why I used to be neutral politically, the Republican blue bloods are the nastiest, dumb, and they're beyond racist.
[02:39:23.127 --> 02:39:25.929]  If you don't know their granddaddy's granddaddy, you aren't in the club.
[02:39:25.929 --> 02:39:26.650]  They're classist.
[02:39:27.270 --> 02:39:28.783]  And that's not what America is about.
[02:39:30.250 --> 02:39:32.291]  The people just joined us.
[02:39:32.291 --> 02:39:36.593]  In the last few minutes we've got left for you in this segment, I've got some big news coming up in the next segment.
[02:39:36.593 --> 02:39:43.355]  You challenged Eric Swallowswell, and he said I'll nuke your ass if you don't turn your guns in.
[02:39:43.355 --> 02:39:45.476]  This is one of the defining moments in America.
[02:39:45.476 --> 02:39:49.498]  There's a lot of stuff out there, but I agree, this is one of the dumbest tweets ever.
[02:39:49.498 --> 02:39:55.660]  This has really gone viral, so I congratulate you on reaching out to him and getting him to arrogantly say that.
[02:39:55.660 --> 02:39:57.581]  What do you think Chapter 2 is of this?
[02:39:58.353 --> 02:40:02.574]  Well, I'm actually trying to reach out to him and see if he'll have a sit-down and talk.
[02:40:02.574 --> 02:40:23.722]  I'd like to really pick his brain and wonder why, or kind of get to understand why he thinks that that's a, you know, a correct response to this, and really find out if he truly does believe in the Constitution, if it's something he's really going to uphold, or is he just going to be a radical New Leftist who's going to come in and try to reshape what this great country was founded on?
[02:40:25.754 --> 02:40:34.864]  For those that just tuned in, he says he'll use nuclear weapons on those that don't turn their guns in, which, militarily, all of it's pure bull, but, he's, oh, it's a joke.
[02:40:34.864 --> 02:40:35.805]  No, it's not a joke.
[02:40:35.805 --> 02:40:38.728]  It's about, they've got the weapons, we don't.
[02:40:38.728 --> 02:40:40.149]  It illustrates everything.
[02:40:40.149 --> 02:40:41.651]  This is totally crystal clear.
[02:40:43.416 --> 02:40:46.717]  Yeah, it's just, it's something that needs to be talked about.
[02:40:46.717 --> 02:40:51.498]  And a guy like that, quite frankly, shouldn't even have the job that he has right now making a statement like that.
[02:40:51.498 --> 02:40:52.959]  Think about if Donald Trump said that.
[02:40:52.959 --> 02:41:03.302]  If Donald Trump even joked about using nuclear weapons against dissidents, against people who didn't like him, against fake news, he would, as soon as they took control of the House, he'd be gone.
[02:41:03.843 --> 02:41:25.443]  You know, they'd be like, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach, impeach,
[02:41:26.864 --> 02:41:31.947]  And you do anything at all, you're guilty without, you know, having your time in court.
[02:41:31.947 --> 02:41:33.487]  And it's just ridiculous.
[02:41:33.487 --> 02:41:38.110]  You lose your job, you lose your TV show, you can lose everything, you know, your social media accounts.
[02:41:38.110 --> 02:41:38.490]  Well, that's it.
[02:41:38.490 --> 02:41:40.171]  That was your time, everybody.
[02:41:40.171 --> 02:41:40.871]  Join us.
[02:41:40.871 --> 02:41:42.272]  Don't have Alex Jones on.
[02:41:42.272 --> 02:41:43.753]  Don't have Joe Biggs on.
[02:41:43.753 --> 02:41:46.194]  Don't talk about Trump being good or we'll attack you.
[02:41:46.194 --> 02:41:48.895]  This is pure bullying and Americans have their line in the sand.
[02:41:48.895 --> 02:41:50.196]  They should say no to it.
[02:41:50.196 --> 02:41:52.397]  americantriggerpullers.com.
[02:41:52.397 --> 02:41:54.418]  Joe Biggs, how do folks find you on Twitter?
[02:41:55.764 --> 02:41:56.865]  At Rambo Biggs.
[02:41:56.865 --> 02:41:59.346]  R-A-M-B-O-B-I-G-G-S.
[02:41:59.346 --> 02:42:00.267]  Alright, great job.
[02:42:00.267 --> 02:42:11.954]  Thanks for spending so much time with us and really great to see you to get Swallow's Well, Eric Swallow's Well, to come out and say, we're going to take your guns, this is futile, turn them in and we're going to nuke you.
[02:42:11.954 --> 02:42:12.875]  What an incredible moment.
[02:42:12.875 --> 02:42:13.295]  Thanks, Joe.
[02:42:13.295 --> 02:42:15.156]  I got a beard now.
[02:42:15.156 --> 02:42:17.998]  You like my beard?
[02:42:17.998 --> 02:42:18.718]  Yeah.
[02:42:18.718 --> 02:42:20.099]  I take mine off and you grow one.
[02:42:20.899 --> 02:42:28.041]  No, my son, you know Rex, we were in Hawaii like eight months ago, and he goes, Dad, he goes, can you grow a beard?
[02:42:28.041 --> 02:42:29.301]  And I said, yeah, son, I'll grow a beard.
[02:42:29.301 --> 02:42:30.702]  He said, grow a beard.
[02:42:30.702 --> 02:42:35.463]  And now, I got a wife, I love her, but the ladies like it so much, I can't stop.
[02:42:35.463 --> 02:42:36.283]  I'm sorry, I had no idea.
[02:42:36.283 --> 02:42:37.783]  I'm in the beard pool now, I apologize.
[02:42:37.783 --> 02:42:40.844]  I'll grow a big, long, giant one like Santa Claus.
[02:42:40.844 --> 02:42:42.164]  Thanks, Joe Biggs.
[02:42:42.164 --> 02:42:44.005]  All right, when we come back,
[02:42:44.926 --> 02:42:48.812]  We are going to hit some of the key intel we've not covered yet.

[02:42:55.447 --> 02:43:03.831]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.831 --> 02:43:05.312]  Believe me, I know.
[02:43:05.312 --> 02:43:10.014]  I spend hours in front of a screen, and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:10.014 --> 02:43:15.017]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:43:15.237 --> 02:43:35.397]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:43:55.236 --> 02:44:04.543]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:44:04.543 --> 02:44:07.406]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:44:07.406 --> 02:44:13.451]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:44:14.111 --> 02:44:20.374]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:44:20.374 --> 02:44:26.657]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:44:26.657 --> 02:44:33.600]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:44:34.740 --> 02:44:47.771]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:44:47.771 --> 02:44:52.034]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:44:52.034 --> 02:44:54.717]  X3, now available at emplowerslife.com.
[02:44:56.579 --> 02:45:04.047]  Monday through next Sunday, we are bringing back the biggest sales in our history.
[02:45:04.047 --> 02:45:08.332]  Black Friday InfoWars store sale, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[02:45:08.332 --> 02:45:13.858]  Up to 50% off on storable food, super high quality, that is huge.
[02:45:13.858 --> 02:45:16.200]  All InfoWars life supplements, 50% off
[02:45:18.723 --> 02:45:26.571]  127 or 49% off Alexa Pure Pro Gravity Fed Filters, Alexa Pure Breeze, Air Filtration.

[02:45:27.772 --> 02:45:29.154]  That's right at Lost Leader.
[02:45:29.154 --> 02:45:30.335]  Again, to get rid of inventory.
[02:45:30.335 --> 02:45:31.296]  So take advantage of that.
[02:45:31.296 --> 02:45:32.557]  It's an amazing system.
[02:45:32.557 --> 02:45:33.838]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars.
[02:45:33.838 --> 02:45:34.999]  They're trying to defund us.
[02:45:34.999 --> 02:45:37.442]  So I said, everything must go by the end of the year.
[02:45:37.742 --> 02:45:41.985]  So that we'll at least have the cash to continue operating for a while.
[02:45:41.985 --> 02:45:47.088]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.

[02:45:54.013 --> 02:45:56.535]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:45:56.535 --> 02:45:59.617]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[02:45:59.617 --> 02:46:01.158]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[02:46:02.521 --> 02:46:05.486]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:46:05.486 --> 02:46:09.532]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patreon supply.
[02:46:11.115 --> 02:46:20.239]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:46:20.239 --> 02:46:25.601]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[02:46:25.601 --> 02:46:27.882]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[02:46:27.882 --> 02:46:31.383]  MFORWARDSTORE.COM on MFORWARDS SELECT storable foods.
[02:46:31.383 --> 02:46:32.864]  They've got special diet foods.
[02:46:32.864 --> 02:46:36.846]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[02:46:36.846 --> 02:46:39.066]  They've got so many great products there.
[02:46:39.066 --> 02:46:40.147]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[02:46:40.607 --> 02:46:42.588]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[02:46:42.588 --> 02:46:45.189]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[02:46:45.189 --> 02:46:50.130]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[02:46:50.130 --> 02:46:59.354]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[02:46:59.354 --> 02:47:02.015]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.024 --> 02:47:24.229]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.229 --> 02:47:27.331]  You know, somebody's got big plans for this planet.
[02:47:29.056 --> 02:47:33.397]  And, you know, I want humans to have a place in that future.
[02:47:33.397 --> 02:47:35.178]  I want a pro-human future.
[02:47:35.178 --> 02:47:38.079]  Big tech companies say, oh, humans are done.
[02:47:38.079 --> 02:47:39.219]  Silicon Age is coming.
[02:47:39.219 --> 02:47:40.539]  We're obsolete.
[02:47:40.539 --> 02:47:44.241]  Yeah, we're gonna wipe everybody out in a bioweapon attack.
[02:47:44.241 --> 02:47:45.001]  But it's okay.
[02:47:45.001 --> 02:47:46.241]  We're superior.
[02:47:46.241 --> 02:47:49.382]  That's official globalist doctrine.
[02:47:49.382 --> 02:47:52.923]  But it's not discussed on the news.
[02:47:52.923 --> 02:47:56.304]  You know, it's weird how the globalists say, oh, the public are idiots.
[02:47:56.304 --> 02:47:57.124]  Don't worry about them.
[02:47:57.124 --> 02:47:58.625]  Let's just say it out in the open.
[02:48:00.834 --> 02:48:05.758]  And then when we cover it, they try to shut us down and say, don't say that.
[02:48:05.758 --> 02:48:09.501]  So see, at least the public's now listening.
[02:48:09.501 --> 02:48:11.883]  Here's the thing.
[02:48:11.883 --> 02:48:21.891]  I'm not a person that thinks of my competition in how much money I've got or how big a string of women I got.
[02:48:21.891 --> 02:48:28.737]  Doesn't mean I don't like money, doesn't mean I don't like women, but it's an intellectual endeavor.
[02:48:32.625 --> 02:48:41.471]  And my greatest frustration is that I really care about humanity.
[02:48:41.471 --> 02:48:43.613]  I really care about our future.
[02:48:43.613 --> 02:48:51.378]  I really can see the potentiality of our larger destiny.
[02:48:51.378 --> 02:49:02.046]  And I've seen the fallen, twisted servants of evil come after me and try to shut us down because we have the cure to their disease.
[02:49:04.534 --> 02:49:09.017]  And I don't sit back when I'm driving home at night and think, man, you're really a badass.
[02:49:09.017 --> 02:49:21.224]  You know, you, you, you've got David Rockefeller's organizations and Henry Kissinger's organizations and the Clintons and the EU all after you.
[02:49:21.224 --> 02:49:27.367]  I actually sit back and go, my God, isn't this choice really easy?
[02:49:27.367 --> 02:49:31.790]  How am I one of the prime movers in the resistance against this?
[02:49:31.790 --> 02:49:33.771]  So here's the big secret.
[02:49:38.050 --> 02:49:50.378]  I'm not up here saying these things on air trying to impress you.
[02:49:50.378 --> 02:49:58.643]  I'm not up here saying these things proudly like, wow, I've got kryptonite to the globalists.
[02:49:58.643 --> 02:50:06.788]  I'm actually pretty upset because I'm projecting onto you that you are just like me.
[02:50:08.217 --> 02:50:20.940]  And the globalists have bet and said, you're not, you're dumb, you're stupid, you're backstabbing, you want your 30 pieces of silver, you don't want the universe, you're gonna sell out here now at this level and never go forward.
[02:50:20.940 --> 02:50:25.061]  Well, a lot of you may do that, but I'm looking for the people that aren't.
[02:50:25.061 --> 02:50:30.902]  And it doesn't mean I've got all the answers and that I'm your guru.
[02:50:30.902 --> 02:50:35.083]  There are no gurus.
[02:50:35.083 --> 02:50:36.063]  All there are are cults.
[02:50:39.212 --> 02:50:47.255]  The priest class setting itself in front of your relationship with God and your creator.
[02:50:47.255 --> 02:50:53.418]  So I'll say this as clear as I've ever said it to everybody out there watching and listening.
[02:50:53.418 --> 02:50:59.741]  There is a war on for your soul and your consciousness.
[02:50:59.741 --> 02:51:04.103]  And that doesn't mean we're gonna toddle into the nearest church and find God there.
[02:51:04.103 --> 02:51:06.624]  In fact, most of the time, you're gonna find the devil
[02:51:07.574 --> 02:51:13.839]  Because the devil puts himself in front of the gate to get to the universe and God.
[02:51:13.839 --> 02:51:18.243]  And all the symbols you see, the all-seeing eye, everything else, the rising sun.
[02:51:18.243 --> 02:51:19.424]  Oh, those are the devil's sign.
[02:51:19.424 --> 02:51:20.705]  No, they're not.
[02:51:20.705 --> 02:51:22.246]  God created mathematics.
[02:51:22.246 --> 02:51:23.207]  God created everything.
[02:51:23.207 --> 02:51:28.351]  The devil has seized control of all the symbols to make you think that the devil is God.
[02:51:28.351 --> 02:51:31.373]  The devil is not God.
[02:51:31.373 --> 02:51:35.977]  So, there are people
[02:51:37.537 --> 02:51:48.962]  Who are missing a connection to God, who are seeking to suppress your consciousness and your mind so that they can rule over you.
[02:51:48.962 --> 02:51:51.183]  And that's a fact.
[02:51:51.183 --> 02:51:55.024]  No one can deny that.
[02:51:55.024 --> 02:52:04.128]  And for me, it's a very frustrating fact that there are these horrible world government forces
[02:52:04.997 --> 02:52:14.943]  that are doing everything they can to suppress knowledge and technological development and honorableness and goodness and healthiness.
[02:52:14.943 --> 02:52:25.309]  Because at this point in culture, if people pushed healthiness and goodness and family and God and Christ, we would already be next galaxy over.
[02:52:25.309 --> 02:52:27.070]  It'd be over.
[02:52:27.070 --> 02:52:33.534]  And there's a real force, spiritually, intergalactically,
[02:52:35.017 --> 02:52:37.019]  Interdimensionally?
[02:52:37.019 --> 02:52:58.236]  However you quantify that, that is doing everything it can in its crib to strangle humanity and to mutate humanity and to whisper in our ear and kill our own instinct to want to be with God.
[02:52:58.236 --> 02:53:03.060]  And so I'm not pleased that I am the vanguard, that my crew is the
[02:53:05.919 --> 02:53:07.880]  of the resistance.
[02:53:07.880 --> 02:53:16.262]  This is so on its face, prima facie, easy to accept, easy to know, easy to go with.
[02:53:16.262 --> 02:53:17.743]  God's already got it all planned out.
[02:53:17.743 --> 02:53:25.285]  We just have to go with free will and choose God's plan.
[02:53:25.285 --> 02:53:31.187]  And so that's why I'm really frustrated is because there really isn't a choice here.
[02:53:31.187 --> 02:53:33.728]  There's oblivion and death or there's eternal life.
[02:53:36.260 --> 02:53:52.483]  God's created a stairway to heaven through free will, but you aren't going to be let into the next dimension unless you've chosen to not be a horrible, deceitful, manipulative devil.
[02:53:54.844 --> 02:54:02.510]  So a lot of people kind of rise up in their awareness and they figure out there's a scam going on and people are being manipulated and they go, oh great, this is great.
[02:54:02.510 --> 02:54:06.154]  If I dumb these people down, if I screw them over, I'm ascendant.
[02:54:06.154 --> 02:54:11.998]  No, you're lower than they are.
[02:54:11.998 --> 02:54:16.842]  You're winning in a fallen system.
[02:54:16.842 --> 02:54:20.986]  So if you sit back and you look at why is InfoWars so banned?
[02:54:20.986 --> 02:54:21.847]  Why is it so hated?
[02:54:22.921 --> 02:54:27.623]  It's the same reason Trump is hated and defiled.
[02:54:27.623 --> 02:54:37.568]  Because Trump doesn't want to see the world burn so that he can sit on top of the ashes and feel powerful.
[02:54:37.568 --> 02:54:46.172]  Trump feels better and more successful when things are successful, when things are beautiful, when things are strong.
[02:54:46.172 --> 02:54:51.435]  And those that don't think they can meet that mark, they're fundamentally against that.
[02:54:52.918 --> 02:54:58.219]  And that's when you realize the fallen only can pull down the universe.
[02:54:58.219 --> 02:55:11.202]  They don't have the idea of expanding it because that's very scary to lower intellects, to see other people informed, to see other people racing ahead, to see other people having great experiences.
[02:55:11.202 --> 02:55:14.923]  They are cut off from that consciousness.
[02:55:14.923 --> 02:55:17.664]  And so to them, it's like death.
[02:55:21.912 --> 02:55:36.576]  So in the two minutes and 20 seconds we have left, I just want to let the listeners know that you've done an amazing job supporting InfoWars, and our affiliates have, and so has the crew.
[02:55:36.576 --> 02:55:41.918]  But I don't want to make it about InfoWars in the final equation.
[02:55:41.918 --> 02:55:48.620]  I want to make it about the fact that in a world of 7 billion plus
[02:55:51.209 --> 02:55:56.173]  You found InfoWars and you resonated with InfoWars.
[02:55:56.173 --> 02:56:11.866]  And not because InfoWars was the highest level of human outreach, but because all of us together were looking for a better world and trying to be good and coming together.
[02:56:11.866 --> 02:56:20.413]  And it's that idea of us communicating, of us having community, of us having brethren, of us having kinship,
[02:56:21.093 --> 02:56:28.035]  Of us communicating, of us edifying each other, of us coming together and even having a chance to communicate.
[02:56:28.035 --> 02:56:30.936]  That is the ultimate sin of the globalists.
[02:56:30.936 --> 02:56:37.018]  And that, when you read their writings, their leaked documents, they say we can't let them have comment sections on articles.
[02:56:37.018 --> 02:56:42.420]  They're communicating, they're getting reinforcement, they're getting stronger.
[02:56:42.420 --> 02:56:44.680]  We have to suppress that.
[02:56:44.680 --> 02:56:46.321]  But even if you're in a jail cell alone,
[02:56:47.574 --> 02:56:50.182]  And you know God and you know justice.
[02:56:50.182 --> 02:56:52.488]  You're already connected to the universe.
[02:56:52.488 --> 02:56:54.434]  These controllers don't have anything over you.
[02:56:56.101 --> 02:56:58.603]  They're not the elite, they're the fallen people.
[02:56:58.603 --> 02:57:03.146]  And we're sad they won't join us, but we can't let them suppress us.
[02:57:03.146 --> 02:57:05.847]  We can't let them stand against what we're doing.
[02:57:05.847 --> 02:57:09.130]  We can't let them hurt the innocents anymore.
[02:57:09.130 --> 02:57:13.833]  These young souls that are so ready to be part of infinity with us.
[02:57:13.833 --> 02:57:17.355]  And so, it's all a big joke on the other side.
[02:57:17.355 --> 02:57:21.698]  They kill these bodies, you look back later and laugh.
[02:57:21.698 --> 02:57:23.739]  These bodies are nothing.
[02:57:23.739 --> 02:57:26.021]  Like a pair of clothes, but they're all trash.
[02:57:27.221 --> 02:57:27.901]  We're good to go.
[02:57:45.601 --> 02:57:51.244]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[02:57:51.244 --> 02:57:52.844]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[02:57:52.844 --> 02:57:53.485]  It's a good thing.
[02:57:53.485 --> 02:57:57.086]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[02:57:57.086 --> 02:57:59.467]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[02:57:59.467 --> 02:58:00.548]  I learned what the best was.
[02:58:00.968 --> 02:58:06.093]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[02:58:06.093 --> 02:58:06.834]  It's amazing.
[02:58:06.834 --> 02:58:09.396]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[02:58:09.396 --> 02:58:16.242]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[02:58:16.242 --> 02:58:17.904]  He has a glut of them.
[02:58:17.904 --> 02:58:20.226]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[02:58:21.567 --> 02:58:23.289]  Well, it's this child using 200.
[02:58:23.289 --> 02:58:24.470]  It's 127!
[02:58:24.470 --> 02:58:30.436]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[02:58:30.436 --> 02:58:32.558]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[02:58:32.558 --> 02:58:34.880]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:35.501]  It's amazing.
[02:58:35.501 --> 02:58:41.526]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:58:46.704 --> 02:58:50.966]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:58:50.966 --> 02:58:54.428]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:58:54.428 --> 02:58:56.209]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:58:56.209 --> 02:58:59.230]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:58:59.230 --> 02:59:06.253]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:59:06.253 --> 02:59:11.336]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[02:59:11.656 --> 02:59:17.779]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:17.779 --> 02:59:20.760]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:59:20.760 --> 02:59:21.861]  I want to keep going.
[02:59:21.861 --> 02:59:25.682]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:25.682 --> 02:59:27.703]  I want to push all the way.
[02:59:27.703 --> 02:59:29.004]  I've committed to do that.
[02:59:29.004 --> 02:59:31.725]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:59:31.725 --> 02:59:34.646]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:59:34.646 --> 02:59:35.967]  I will never falter.
[02:59:35.967 --> 02:59:37.988]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:59:38.288 --> 02:59:48.873]  I physically will, but I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at 4Wars4.com, to give you my absolute, total commitment.
[02:59:48.873 --> 02:59:51.554]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.930 --> 03:00:05.853]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:00:05.853 --> 03:00:09.416]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:09.416 --> 03:00:13.779]  Alright, so finishing up on the so-called hack.
[03:00:14.721 --> 03:00:23.990]  We're still going to warn the 1,600 people or so that may have had some information in a screen scrape grabbed.
[03:00:23.990 --> 03:00:28.755]  But again, the way it's going out, the way it was encrypted, very, very low probability of that.
[03:00:28.755 --> 03:00:32.519]  But the issue is, normally these hacks go on for years.
[03:00:32.519 --> 03:00:38.464]  What was it, 88 million Yahoo financial accounts that got
[03:00:39.480 --> 03:00:42.303]  Exposed over what, five, six years?
[03:00:42.303 --> 03:00:44.005]  22 million plus U.S.
[03:00:44.005 --> 03:00:46.587]  government employees, their families, everything scraped.
[03:00:46.587 --> 03:00:48.870]  That went on for years.
[03:00:48.870 --> 03:00:56.458]  This happens for less than one day, and magically, the media is notified about it.
[03:00:56.458 --> 03:00:59.441]  So again, everything points towards it being put on there.
[03:01:00.987 --> 03:01:04.850]  So they could engage in economic sabotage and just try to embarrass us.
[03:01:04.850 --> 03:01:06.491]  And you read these sickening articles.
[03:01:06.491 --> 03:01:08.532]  This is just one of them that I'm giving a flavor for.
[03:01:08.532 --> 03:01:15.917]  Then we're going to go back to break and come back with our special guest.
[03:01:15.917 --> 03:01:22.922]  They go on here in this Fast Company article to tell you what they're really going for here.
[03:01:22.922 --> 03:01:26.124]  It would seem that selling products directly on the site
[03:01:27.196 --> 03:01:34.999]  Is one of the only reliable ways for Jones to bring in revenue, and now it seems even that was hampered.
[03:01:34.999 --> 03:01:39.680]  For now, Jones tells ZDNet the problem is fixed.
[03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:50.144]  So instead of chancing their data privacy, those buying InfoWars products are merely putting their bodily health at risk.
[03:01:53.226 --> 03:01:56.289]  And that's what the average article's like.
[03:01:56.289 --> 03:01:57.710]  I'm a criminal.
[03:01:57.710 --> 03:01:59.431]  I'm scum.
[03:01:59.431 --> 03:02:00.292]  I'm ripping you off.
[03:02:00.292 --> 03:02:03.134]  You could get hurt taking my products.
[03:02:03.134 --> 03:02:09.219]  I've got this shoddy shopping cart that's got this malware on it, and this is all going on.
[03:02:09.219 --> 03:02:13.623]  Meanwhile, one in five shopping carts at any one time is infected with the stuff.
[03:02:13.623 --> 03:02:15.705]  We have a bunch of big companies, people watching it.
[03:02:15.705 --> 03:02:16.906]  They scanned it, said, yeah, it's
[03:02:18.041 --> 03:02:19.742]  Not there.
[03:02:19.742 --> 03:02:26.466]  Because it was put into code so that they could point at it and say, don't shop with Alex Jones.
[03:02:26.466 --> 03:02:27.787]  And then we knew what the articles would be.
[03:02:27.787 --> 03:02:29.228]  Don't shop with him!
[03:02:29.228 --> 03:02:32.710]  They're everywhere trying to take our payment processors away.
[03:02:32.710 --> 03:02:38.373]  They're everywhere trying to bankrupt us and shut us down so we can't stand up for the Republic and basic freedom.
[03:02:38.373 --> 03:02:40.515]  And now this.
[03:02:40.515 --> 03:02:46.318]  Again, most tax go for months, sometimes years of this type.
[03:02:46.318 --> 03:02:47.099]  But magically,
[03:02:48.860 --> 03:02:53.323]  Magically, the hack came out of the Netherlands and then Lithuania, supposedly.
[03:02:53.323 --> 03:02:55.365]  You can bounce it from anywhere.
[03:02:55.365 --> 03:03:05.132]  But, thank goodness, security researchers in the Netherlands caught it pretty much instantly when it started happening and then reported it to the media so that we could get it fixed.
[03:03:05.132 --> 03:03:11.297]  We're really very thankful to the folks over in the Netherlands, whatever's going on here.
[03:03:11.297 --> 03:03:13.218]  But, this is classic.
[03:03:13.218 --> 03:03:15.380]  If you go to the Vault 7 that WikiLeaks released,
[03:03:16.940 --> 03:03:35.416]  It's the leftist inside the CIA, not the whole agency, and other intelligence agencies have tools way beyond all this, and how to frame people, how to do fake hacks, to then discredit people, and it's the exact way to do this, and folks understand how these operations are run.
[03:03:35.416 --> 03:03:38.919]  This is a reign of terror, and I'm not worried about Infowars.
[03:03:38.919 --> 03:03:42.643]  I'm worried about the whole country and the whole world, because the election stealing
[03:03:44.261 --> 03:03:56.928]  It's ongoing, the fraud that we're seeing, the censorship, the calls for overthrowing President Trump and having civil emergency and martial law, and then the Democrats run around and say that that's not happening?
[03:03:56.928 --> 03:03:58.429]  And the media says that?
[03:03:58.429 --> 03:04:00.150]  It is just a new world.
[03:04:00.150 --> 03:04:02.291]  Now, we have a special guest joining us.
[03:04:02.291 --> 03:04:06.173]  He happens to be a Democrat, but there are some still good Democrats out there.
[03:04:06.173 --> 03:04:07.994]  And I'm familiar with some of his work.
[03:04:07.994 --> 03:04:09.295]  I haven't read the book yet, but look forward to it.
[03:04:09.295 --> 03:04:10.375]  I've heard it's a great book.
[03:04:10.375 --> 03:04:13.397]  Robert Mueller, errand boy for the New World Order.
[03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:19.142]  And we'll talk to John Milkovich when we come back on the other side.
[03:04:19.142 --> 03:04:24.705]  And we're going to get into who Mueller really is and what he's done in the past.
[03:04:24.705 --> 03:04:29.587]  Helping Whitey Bulger carry out hits and murders, that's Mueller's job.
[03:04:29.587 --> 03:04:34.089]  Transferring uranium to the Russians for Hillary, that's Mueller's job.
[03:04:34.089 --> 03:04:36.170]  Framing people for the anthrax attacks, that's Mueller's job.
[03:04:36.170 --> 03:04:39.612]  He's a really nasty dude.
[03:04:39.612 --> 03:04:41.153]  And so we're going to talk to Louisiana State Senator
[03:04:42.233 --> 03:04:46.721]  On the other side, about this book, and again, here's another person that has courage.
[03:04:46.721 --> 03:04:49.866]  If you write something about this gangster, well, they might come after you.
[03:04:54.386 --> 03:05:01.848]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.
[03:05:01.848 --> 03:05:11.110]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.
[03:05:11.110 --> 03:05:20.172]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as astaxanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[03:05:21.127 --> 03:05:32.556]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[03:05:32.556 --> 03:05:41.663]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[03:05:42.123 --> 03:05:44.845]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.
[03:05:44.845 --> 03:05:48.529]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[03:05:48.529 --> 03:05:51.071]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:06:06.150 --> 03:06:16.020]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:16.020 --> 03:06:22.666]  You know, I really hate tyranny.
[03:06:22.666 --> 03:06:24.508]  What about you folks?
[03:06:24.508 --> 03:06:24.728]  Show!
[03:06:27.170 --> 03:06:48.121]  Yesterday we had Roger Stone, and we had one of his lawyers on, Tyler Nixon, and he'd been called before the grand jury, and there, lo and behold, guess who walks into the room, all secretly, no one had known, because the media's told to not report on it, and then they follow orders.
[03:06:48.121 --> 03:06:51.322]  Guess who the lead prosecutor is under Mueller?
[03:06:51.322 --> 03:06:54.324]  It's Hillary Clinton's personal attack dog lawyer.
[03:06:55.182 --> 03:06:57.303]  And you're like, that's an incredible conflict of interest.
[03:06:57.303 --> 03:07:01.325]  That's over the top.
[03:07:01.325 --> 03:07:02.165]  Crazy!
[03:07:02.165 --> 03:07:03.686]  Why not make Hillary the judge?
[03:07:03.686 --> 03:07:04.286]  Well, why not?
[03:07:04.286 --> 03:07:07.628]  I mean, Hillary's talking about running for president again.
[03:07:07.628 --> 03:07:13.671]  Because the Republicans have rolled over and let the deep state Dems start stealing all these elections, so why not?
[03:07:13.671 --> 03:07:17.553]  And that's the point I've been getting at as we've entered a brave new world.
[03:07:17.553 --> 03:07:21.895]  And you know, if you go back 10, 15 years ago, there were Democrats I liked, there were Republicans I liked.
[03:07:22.836 --> 03:07:24.796]  I didn't like Republican Blue Bloods.
[03:07:24.796 --> 03:07:28.457]  I didn't like George Herbert Walker Bush, the establishment.
[03:07:28.457 --> 03:07:32.498]  But now, this is another subject for our guest.
[03:07:32.498 --> 03:07:42.161]  The National Democratic Party, led by Hillary Clinton still and Debbie Washburn Schultz and Nancy Pelosi, just seems to have no bottom.
[03:07:42.161 --> 03:07:51.083]  Now our guest, John Milkovich, is humbled and honored to represent Louisiana, Senate District 38.
[03:07:52.742 --> 03:08:05.002]  The priorities of this term include strengthening the Second Amendment, protections, defending traditional marriage, fighting abortion, working to get rid of Common Core, protecting the right of citizens including principals, teachers, and coaches to express their faith.
[03:08:05.002 --> 03:08:06.304]  You're like, wow, this sounds like...
[03:08:08.069 --> 03:08:09.069]  Congressman Scalise or something.
[03:08:09.069 --> 03:08:11.650]  Well, there are districts where conservatives have to run as Democrats.
[03:08:11.650 --> 03:08:12.811]  That's the secret here.
[03:08:12.811 --> 03:08:20.814]  He's passionate about working to prevent an unfair share of the tax burden from being imposed upon small businesses and families of senior citizens.
[03:08:20.814 --> 03:08:28.657]  He wrote the book Robert Mueller, errand boy for the New World Order in opposition to the witch hunt that has been perpetrated against the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
[03:08:28.657 --> 03:08:32.118]  And now they're segwaying out of the Russiagate thing as that fraud comes to a close.
[03:08:33.371 --> 03:08:34.211]  I don't
[03:08:53.957 --> 03:09:00.345]  But I guess we should get to the book itself and who is Robert Mueller because this is a window in to these people.
[03:09:00.345 --> 03:09:03.829]  We're all sick of Russiagate, but we're sick of the mainstream media's coverage of it.
[03:09:03.829 --> 03:09:05.010]  Who is Robert Mueller?
[03:09:05.010 --> 03:09:06.852]  He's a really bad guy.
[03:09:06.852 --> 03:09:12.118]  State Senator, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:09:12.118 --> 03:09:13.540]  What made you decide to write this book?
[03:09:14.734 --> 03:09:16.657]  Listen, it's great to be here, Alex.
[03:09:16.657 --> 03:09:28.731]  Look, I think we start with the fact that whether you like him or not, or agree or disagree with everything that he's done, I think the reality is, is that Donald Trump is an outsider.
[03:09:28.731 --> 03:09:33.958]  And Robert Mueller's come after him tooth and nail, obviously with an agenda to take him out.
[03:09:34.802 --> 03:09:36.063]  Is he a man of the type of moral integrity
[03:09:50.954 --> 03:09:56.135]  And character that we can entrust with this historically and constitutionally monumental task.
[03:09:56.135 --> 03:09:58.856]  And the answer is absolutely not.
[03:09:58.856 --> 03:10:07.357]  If you look at his career over a period of 30 years, he's been orchestrating cover-up after cover-up after cover-up, which is modus operandi.
[03:10:07.357 --> 03:10:16.399]  It's persecuting the innocent, letting the guilty go free, covering up for globalist insiders and high roller, international high rollers.
[03:10:16.399 --> 03:10:19.900]  And because Donald Trump is an outsider,
[03:10:20.543 --> 03:10:39.032]  Because he believes in American sovereignty, because he's standing up for the preservation of America and fighting against the economic and cultural erosion of America, of course he is in the sights of Mueller and his globalist directors.
[03:10:41.144 --> 03:10:42.305]  Let's get into some of the book.
[03:10:42.305 --> 03:10:44.047]  I mean, I haven't read it yet, but I've scanned over it.
[03:10:44.047 --> 03:10:49.832]  And believe me, I know a lot more about Mueller than I want to know, but I actually learned some things just recently spending 10 minutes scanning it over.
[03:10:49.832 --> 03:11:00.281]  But this guy is covering up 9-11 and the murder of John O'Neill, who was a good FBI agent, and just everything he does.
[03:11:00.281 --> 03:11:01.803]  This guy is super bad news.
[03:11:01.803 --> 03:11:03.024]  BCCI.
[03:11:03.024 --> 03:11:04.305]  Let's start and run through the book.
[03:11:06.231 --> 03:11:07.692]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[03:11:07.692 --> 03:11:14.738]  And by the way, I really want to thank you for the work that you're doing on behalf of the American public, on behalf of our republic.
[03:11:14.738 --> 03:11:19.902]  I think we all need to be praying for your safety and continued health and good work.
[03:11:19.902 --> 03:11:22.564]  Listen, we can start with Whitey Bulger.
[03:11:22.564 --> 03:11:24.605]  He's the Irish mafia.
[03:11:24.605 --> 03:11:31.090]  And not only was Whitey Bulger operating a reign of terror in Boston, but he was assisted by FBI agents.
[03:11:31.090 --> 03:11:35.534]  Well, who is in the geographic and temporal epicenter of Whitey Bulger's
[03:11:36.827 --> 03:11:38.588]  FBI's reign of terror.
[03:11:38.588 --> 03:11:40.429]  Robert Mueller, he's either the Assistant U.S.
[03:11:40.429 --> 03:11:41.749]  Attorney or the U.S.
[03:11:41.749 --> 03:11:43.770]  Attorney from 82 to 87.
[03:11:43.770 --> 03:11:49.213]  What did he do to stop Whitey Bulger or the federal agents that were protecting him?
[03:11:49.213 --> 03:11:54.615]  And according to many, several reporters, they were actually helping Whitey Bulger commit and cover up murders.
[03:11:56.316 --> 03:12:06.780]  Robert Mueller did lift a finger, didn't say a word, didn't indict anyone, didn't arrest anyone, didn't prosecute anyone, didn't investigate anyone, didn't even expose anyone.
[03:12:06.780 --> 03:12:14.363]  He basically took a powder so that the FBI and a Boston mobster could terrorize the city.
[03:12:14.363 --> 03:12:15.263]  Let's move on to
[03:12:15.723 --> 03:12:16.865]  Pan Am 103.
[03:12:16.865 --> 03:12:22.553]  Pan Am 103 was, according to rank-and-file CIA agents, a closed-and-shut case.
[03:12:22.553 --> 03:12:29.543]  This was a medjabril, assisted by the Iranians and the Syrians, that took out this flight, murdered 270 people.
[03:12:31.365 --> 03:12:48.336]  And, in fact, Robert Bayer, a CIA agent, said, look, well, there was not even a question among CIA agents at the time, said it was unanimous among the rank-and-file CIA people that this was a hit behind which, in which Iran and Syria were involved.
[03:12:48.336 --> 03:12:50.357]  But what happens is Bush Sr.
[03:12:50.357 --> 03:12:54.620]  says, look, we're going into the Gulf War, we don't want to get Iran and Syria mad.
[03:12:54.620 --> 03:12:55.140]  Let's blame Libya!
[03:12:56.901 --> 03:12:57.822]  Let's blame Libya.
[03:12:57.822 --> 03:13:05.306]  So they, Alex, arrested two Libyan intelligence officers who had nothing to do with the Pan Am bombing.
[03:13:05.306 --> 03:13:07.188]  Sent one of them to prison.
[03:13:07.188 --> 03:13:08.789]  One of them was actually acquitted.
[03:13:08.789 --> 03:13:10.069]  And who goes free?
[03:13:10.069 --> 03:13:12.271]  Ahmed Jibril goes free.
[03:13:12.271 --> 03:13:16.834]  The international drug ring, CIA, is operating with.
[03:13:16.834 --> 03:13:18.875]  And by the way, there's CIA fingerprints
[03:13:19.822 --> 03:13:22.904]  On the Pan Am 103, there was a U.S.
[03:13:22.904 --> 03:13:36.251]  Army Major Charles McKee who was flying from Europe to America to blow the whistle on a CIA drug-assisted ring that was trafficking heroin into America on December 21st, 1988.
[03:13:36.251 --> 03:13:39.152]  When that plane blew up, so did Charles McKee.
[03:13:39.152 --> 03:13:44.075]  And the investigation by people that the professional investigators into for the Israeli
[03:13:44.901 --> 03:13:56.744]  Investigative agency, private agency said that, look, the CIA control gave the final go ahead for the flight to continue when officers on the ground could have stopped it.
[03:13:56.744 --> 03:13:59.264]  And there goes 270 people, there goes U.S.
[03:13:59.264 --> 03:14:03.105]  Army Major, highly decorated Major Charles McKee and his federal agents.
[03:14:03.105 --> 03:14:05.846]  We're going to blow the whistle on the CIA drug wing.
[03:14:05.846 --> 03:14:09.927]  So, bottom line, the federal agents had
[03:14:10.828 --> 03:14:15.512]  The, you know, had the goods on who did that bombing.
[03:14:15.512 --> 03:14:21.596]  And because of politics, the investigation was redirected, rerouted.
[03:14:21.596 --> 03:14:23.898]  Who gets brought in to help the cover up?
[03:14:23.898 --> 03:14:25.119]  Robert Mueller.
[03:14:25.119 --> 03:14:27.661]  Let the guilty persecute the innocent.
[03:14:27.661 --> 03:14:29.322]  Let the guilty go free.
[03:14:29.322 --> 03:14:32.205]  And there are CIA fingerprints on that.
[03:14:32.205 --> 03:14:32.945]  And what was the evidence?
[03:14:32.945 --> 03:14:35.307]  And I want to be brief because I know we have much to cover.
[03:14:35.307 --> 03:14:36.208]  But Alex,
[03:14:37.085 --> 03:14:44.810]  There was federal agents that had intercepted conversations between Iran and Ahmed Jibril contracting to take out an American airliner.
[03:14:44.810 --> 03:14:52.135]  They had even intercepted the goods that Iran paid Jibril a million before the bombing, 10 million after the bombing.
[03:14:52.135 --> 03:14:53.856]  Jibril was bragging about it.
[03:14:53.856 --> 03:14:58.319]  His terrorist cell got caught with bombs about a month or two before the bombing.
[03:14:58.319 --> 03:15:00.881]  It was just like the bomb that was used to take Pan Am 103.
[03:15:00.881 --> 03:15:04.243]  Look, this is a close and shut case for conscientious federal agents.
[03:15:04.243 --> 03:15:06.885]  But instead, they let it happen and Mueller
[03:15:07.045 --> 03:15:07.645]  Stay right there.
[03:15:07.645 --> 03:15:09.346]  We're going to go to break and come back to this history.
[03:15:09.346 --> 03:15:14.348]  Robert Mueller, Aaron Boyle of the New World Order with State Senator of Louisiana, John Milkovich.

[03:15:17.169 --> 03:15:23.631]  And remember listeners, they're trying to censor us, they're trying to block us, they're trying to shut us down because we're talking about these things.
[03:15:25.104 --> 03:15:29.825]  Once we're shut down, they can then really demonize us and come after us physically.
[03:15:29.825 --> 03:15:30.306]  You name it.
[03:15:30.306 --> 03:15:34.007]  So, it's a really important InfoWars stay here for a lot of obvious reasons.

[03:15:53.792 --> 03:15:54.992]  Hear that?
[03:15:54.992 --> 03:16:00.374]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:16:00.374 --> 03:16:03.275]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[03:16:53.567 --> 03:16:54.788]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:54.788 --> 03:16:58.729]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.729 --> 03:17:00.270]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:00.270 --> 03:17:03.211]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:03.211 --> 03:17:08.773]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:08.773 --> 03:17:09.973]  I can help you, too.

[03:17:23.238 --> 03:17:27.100]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:17:27.100 --> 03:17:32.103]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[03:17:32.103 --> 03:17:36.926]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[03:17:43.950 --> 03:17:46.451]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[03:17:54.229 --> 03:18:03.520]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:18:03.520 --> 03:18:06.384]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:18:06.384 --> 03:18:12.431]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:18:13.092 --> 03:18:19.358]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:18:19.358 --> 03:18:25.663]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:18:25.663 --> 03:18:32.689]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:18:32.689 --> 03:18:32.889]  But!
[03:18:33.730 --> 03:18:46.764]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:18:46.764 --> 03:18:51.008]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:18:51.008 --> 03:18:53.711]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[03:18:59.204 --> 03:19:01.546]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:19:57.859 --> 03:20:00.424]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:15.839 --> 03:20:20.661]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:20.661 --> 03:20:35.147]  We're going to get back into Robert Mueller and his real history, which is public, but most people don't know it, to understand why he's this operative for the deep state, for the Clintons and others, and why he's so dangerous and so arrogant.
[03:20:35.147 --> 03:20:38.388]  The prosecutor they're using is Hillary Clinton's attack dog.
[03:20:38.388 --> 03:20:41.350]  There's an article on Infowars.com about that right now.
[03:20:42.270 --> 03:20:44.151]  But my producer was asking this.
[03:20:44.151 --> 03:20:46.512]  For a lot of folks that don't know, you have a very conservative background.
[03:20:46.512 --> 03:20:47.933]  You're in Louisiana, though.
[03:20:47.933 --> 03:20:51.955]  I know a lot of places you can't get elected as a Republican just the way they've gerrymandered things.
[03:20:51.955 --> 03:20:59.038]  So briefly, tell folks for a minute or two how you fell down the rabbit hole and why you are a Democrat.
[03:21:00.396 --> 03:21:03.418]  Well, I'll start by saying this.
[03:21:03.418 --> 03:21:11.202]  Alex, I'm very disappointed in the lack of moral compass of many of the National Democrats in Washington, D.C.
[03:21:11.202 --> 03:21:27.010]  You know, in the Old South, Democrats a generation ago were people that were for a fair shake for working families, believed in God, against abortion, and just, you know, wanted working families to have access to justice and a fair shake.
[03:21:27.770 --> 03:21:41.177]  Unfortunately, the Democratic Party, especially on the national level, has moved towards atheism, evolution, abortion, amorality, taking away our Second Amendment rights.
[03:21:42.419 --> 03:21:49.384]  And perhaps above all or one of the most significant factors is government programs are the solution for every problem.
[03:21:49.384 --> 03:21:50.985]  I don't believe any of those things.
[03:21:50.985 --> 03:22:01.792]  I do, as an old-fashioned person, I still believe that it's important for working families to get a fair shake in the justice system and in the taxation system, in the courts and the media.
[03:22:01.792 --> 03:22:06.656]  But I share your disappointment at what's going on at the national level in Washington.
[03:22:08.917 --> 03:22:13.881]  There are some districts and areas around the country where you've got some Democrats that are more conservative than most conservatives.
[03:22:13.881 --> 03:22:17.363]  You just never see them in the national spotlight because the media doesn't want people to know that.
[03:22:17.363 --> 03:22:20.606]  So it's good to know there are still a few Democrats out there now.
[03:22:20.606 --> 03:22:24.268]  And there's also some Republicans that act like the worst leftists.
[03:22:24.268 --> 03:22:25.889]  So people like John McCain.
[03:22:26.894 --> 03:22:30.957]  Let's get back into Robert Mueller, because a lot of people want to jump off a cliff when they hear about Robert Mueller.
[03:22:30.957 --> 03:22:32.678]  They're sick of it, they know it's bull.
[03:22:32.678 --> 03:22:34.740]  That's not the story, as you were saying.
[03:22:34.740 --> 03:22:39.003]  You're detailing, just in the few minutes we had, all the proof of cover-up after cover-up.
[03:22:39.003 --> 03:22:54.235]  He's the guy that's brought in, and your book just runs through it all, and then into all the laws they broke to illegally surveil Trump, and then they use the new Russia investigation as a cover for all the illegality there, and then the lack of prosecution.
[03:22:55.422 --> 03:23:07.784]  Of Mueller, of Hillary, just the brazenness where these people are supposedly more powerful than the President, all because they've got so many dead bodies under their belt.
[03:23:07.784 --> 03:23:09.384]  Well, they need to be taken to task.
[03:23:09.384 --> 03:23:12.205]  We've talked about Whitey Bulger, Pan Am 103.
[03:23:12.205 --> 03:23:14.265]  We know that President Bush Sr.
[03:23:14.265 --> 03:23:25.167]  brought Mueller in to basically sweep criminal activity under the rug, under the carpet, and make sure that the major players in BCCI got a slap on the wrist.
[03:23:26.259 --> 03:23:26.379]  Yeah.
[03:23:29.590 --> 03:23:33.193]  ...asked these questions about Robert Mueller's morality.
[03:23:33.193 --> 03:23:54.509]  After 9-11, he helps whisk the Bin Ladens and ranking Saudis, who actually had some potential culpable knowledge about 9-11, helps take them, fly them out of America, yet he goes ahead and crows hundreds of hapless immigrants to New York City who had nothing to do with 9-11, and basically helps supervise their abuse in New York City jails.
[03:23:54.509 --> 03:23:56.371]  So we question Robert Mueller's morality.
[03:23:56.371 --> 03:23:57.692]  We question his math.
[03:23:58.112 --> 03:24:10.663]  He makes a major prosecutorial attack on Paul Manafort for apparently a few million dollars of tax monies or monies that were spent but yet when it's the BCCI folks
[03:24:12.421 --> 03:24:18.707]  Committing fraud, money laundering, supporting drug operations to the tune of billions of dollars.
[03:24:18.707 --> 03:24:19.568]  Where's his math?
[03:24:19.568 --> 03:24:32.221]  So he's going to fly off the handle over a few millions, but when the stakes, financially, economically, are thousands of times higher, he goes ahead and gets tired and is willing to take orders from the people that don't want the higher-ups.
[03:24:32.681 --> 03:24:34.202]  Uh, held to account.
[03:24:34.202 --> 03:24:47.433]  So we question his morality, we question his math, we question his memory, and specifically, and a lot in my book, in fact, I acknowledge specifically the work of your outstanding colleague, Jerome Corsi.
[03:24:47.433 --> 03:24:52.417]  He shows that not only did Robert Mueller, according to State Department cables, hand-deliver
[03:24:53.587 --> 03:24:58.450]  Highly enriched uranium to tarmac in Russia, according to Jerome Corsi.
[03:24:58.450 --> 03:25:10.076]  In addition to that, he basically took a dive and allowed the Clintons to accumulate and later transmit to the Russians 20% of America's uranium interest.
[03:25:10.076 --> 03:25:17.900]  So, if we want to talk about real Russian collusion, not fake news Russian collusion, but real, Mueller's right in the middle of it.
[03:25:18.420 --> 03:25:19.401]  Let's expand.
[03:25:19.401 --> 03:25:24.243]  That's severly confirmed about the uranium, but he claims, well, Hillary ordered him, so it was okay.
[03:25:24.243 --> 03:25:24.963]  It's just crazy.
[03:25:24.963 --> 03:25:26.424]  You've got real tarmac meetings.
[03:25:26.424 --> 03:25:30.766]  Let's remember, Corsi believes he will be indicted Friday by Mueller.
[03:25:30.766 --> 03:25:35.889]  So you write a book about Mueller and crushing Wadid State, and you get indicted by him.
[03:25:35.889 --> 03:25:37.810]  I mean, how obvious is this?
[03:25:37.810 --> 03:25:44.493]  And then the Democrats talk about Trump's war on the press, when Obama put hundreds of whistleblowers and journalists in prison for nothing.
[03:25:44.493 --> 03:25:45.354]  These people are sick.
[03:25:46.564 --> 03:25:47.205]  You're right.
[03:25:47.205 --> 03:25:49.407]  No, it is an outrage.
[03:25:49.407 --> 03:26:08.023]  And, you know, Mueller, he not only allowed, stood by, stood down, stood down is a good term, to allow the Clintons and the Russians to go ahead and make transactions on 20% of America's uranium interest, he also allowed the Clintons to receive
[03:26:08.809 --> 03:26:08.969]  That's
[03:26:28.305 --> 03:26:34.607]  A teenage son who had been shot in the back and killed by a submachine gun, wielded by a federal agent.
[03:26:34.607 --> 03:26:45.631]  We know that federal agent shot Randy Weaver's wife in the head as she was standing in the doorway of their Ruby Ridge cabin, holding her, I think, 10-month-old daughter.
[03:26:45.631 --> 03:26:54.154]  And what was Mueller's, and of course, I want to be clear, Mueller was not in charge of that investigation or that assault.
[03:26:55.094 --> 03:27:04.739]  According to the New York Times, Mueller's response afterwards was not, why are federal agents shooting up a family in Ruby Ridge, Idaho?
[03:27:04.739 --> 03:27:11.162]  His response is, how dare anyone criticize federal agents for shooting an unarmed woman while she's holding a 10-month-old baby?
[03:27:11.162 --> 03:27:11.802]  Oh yeah, no.
[03:27:11.802 --> 03:27:16.404]  Mueller thinks he's God, and they worship him in D.C., all the little sycophants and cowards.
[03:27:16.404 --> 03:27:17.225]  Let's continue on.
[03:27:18.404 --> 03:27:20.085]  9-11.
[03:27:20.085 --> 03:27:24.589]  He basically, he was brought in by President Bush Jr.
[03:27:24.589 --> 03:27:26.150]  one week before 9-11.
[03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:30.273]  And if that's coincidental, I think the viewers have to decide for themselves.
[03:27:30.273 --> 03:27:38.660]  What we do know is that he came in and instead of investigating 9-11, he covered up 9-11.
[03:27:38.660 --> 03:27:45.686]  True investigative efforts to, for example, go out to San Diego and detail the fact that an FBI
[03:27:47.047 --> 03:27:54.892]  The truth was the hijackers were being protected.
[03:27:54.892 --> 03:27:56.373]  Mueller comes in.
[03:27:56.373 --> 03:27:57.614]  John O'Neill was exposing it.
[03:27:57.614 --> 03:28:03.959]  He dies on 9-11, a good FBI agent, deputy head of counterterrorism, or deputy director head of counterterrorism.
[03:28:03.959 --> 03:28:10.344]  So we'll come back and talk about all that and then Mueller came in and covered up the good FBI agents saying we were ordered to stand down.
[03:28:11.044 --> 03:28:13.225]  We'll talk about it more when we come back.
[03:28:13.225 --> 03:28:16.165]  We haven't even gotten into the current stuff.
[03:28:16.165 --> 03:28:20.847]  The anthrax cover-up, all the patsies, the bizarre deaths there.
[03:28:20.847 --> 03:28:22.607]  It just goes on and on.
[03:28:22.607 --> 03:28:23.467]  Robert Mueller.
[03:28:23.467 --> 03:28:27.708]  Oh, and where do people find Robert Mueller, Aaron Boy for the New World Order, John?
[03:28:27.708 --> 03:28:29.149]  Well, Alex, thank you.

[03:31:00.083 --> 03:31:01.684]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[03:31:01.684 --> 03:31:02.324]  It's a good thing.
[03:31:02.324 --> 03:31:05.926]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[03:31:05.926 --> 03:31:08.346]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[03:31:08.346 --> 03:31:09.387]  I learned what the best was.
[03:31:09.787 --> 03:31:14.931]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[03:31:14.931 --> 03:31:15.651]  It's amazing.

[03:31:18.213 --> 03:31:25.077]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[03:31:25.077 --> 03:31:26.739]  He has a glut of them.
[03:31:26.739 --> 03:31:29.040]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[03:31:30.561 --> 03:31:34.062]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[03:31:34.062 --> 03:31:35.102]  It's $127.

[03:31:39.403 --> 03:31:41.383]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.

[03:32:50.511 --> 03:32:52.052]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:23.590 --> 03:33:27.652]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:33:27.652 --> 03:33:30.213]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.213 --> 03:33:48.201]  Boy, they got really mad right before my de-platforming when it came out in the news that Robert Mueller was using Jeffrey Epstein, the procurer of young girls for sex, on these rape islands they have.
[03:33:49.434 --> 03:33:52.496]  And that Mueller was using him as an informant to set people up.
[03:33:52.496 --> 03:34:01.083]  So I said, by extension, if you know something's going on, you let it happen, that he is aiding and abetting the rape of children.
[03:34:01.083 --> 03:34:04.045]  Which we know they use these sex crimes to control people.
[03:34:04.045 --> 03:34:10.270]  And boy, the media said, Jones says Mueller is raping children.
[03:34:10.270 --> 03:34:11.851]  Now I said, no, he didn't do that.
[03:34:11.851 --> 03:34:15.214]  He just knows what's going on, which is the same thing.
[03:34:15.214 --> 03:34:19.037]  So you can add that to the repertoire of everything he's involved in.
[03:34:20.259 --> 03:34:24.303]  I'm just, everybody's so scared of this dirty, ugly, stupid killer.
[03:34:24.303 --> 03:34:28.527]  And his family involved in the Kennedy assassination and all the rest of it.
[03:34:28.527 --> 03:34:34.012]  This guy is a, you know, big establishment, super rich fat cat.
[03:34:34.012 --> 03:34:34.752]  And you know what?
[03:34:34.752 --> 03:34:36.354]  He'll face God.
[03:34:36.354 --> 03:34:37.935]  He'll face God.
[03:34:37.935 --> 03:34:39.737]  There is a heaven, there is a hell.
[03:34:39.737 --> 03:34:40.738]  He will face God.
[03:34:40.738 --> 03:34:42.780]  God will bring judgment on Robert Mueller.
[03:34:44.744 --> 03:34:57.531]  I don't have fun poking criminals like this, but everybody else needs to learn not to be cowards, because they get off on this and how, oh, you can't talk bad about his majesty, you can't talk bad about him.
[03:34:57.531 --> 03:35:09.377]  There is an epic disconnect between the Robert Mueller described by the mass media and officialdom as a model of public propriety, and the Robert Mueller documented by independent researchers,
[03:35:10.509 --> 03:35:16.635]  Chronic collaborator with career characterized by cover-up, corruption, and unconceivable conduct.
[03:35:16.635 --> 03:35:23.181]  An ever-willing instrument of the deep state.
[03:35:23.181 --> 03:35:24.702]  You need to read the book, folks.
[03:35:24.702 --> 03:35:35.452]  Because we're here understanding who these monsters are and the arrogance of Mueller believing that he could go and take on Trump and the populist movement and all this.
[03:35:35.452 --> 03:35:36.293]  Well, guess what they are?
[03:35:37.841 --> 03:35:42.125]  They're stealing elections everywhere, they're calling for war, they're out of control!
[03:35:42.125 --> 03:35:43.986]  They're crazy people!
[03:35:43.986 --> 03:35:55.777]  And, continuing through his history, we've got State Senator John Milkovich, johnmilkovichforsenate.com is his website, and he's written Robert Mueller, Aaron Boer for the New World Order.
[03:35:55.777 --> 03:36:02.402]  It's important to drill in and to see who runs these ridiculous witch hunts.
[03:36:03.416 --> 03:36:08.418]  And again, to have his main prosecutor in the wet shot be Hillary Clinton's former personal attack dog.
[03:36:08.418 --> 03:36:09.499]  Why not just have Hillary do it?
[03:36:09.499 --> 03:36:13.000]  I mean, these people are so arrogant, John.
[03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:15.341]  Well, they've gotten away with a lot.
[03:36:15.341 --> 03:36:17.022]  And I appreciate you touching on
[03:36:18.400 --> 03:36:21.641]  Mueller's culpability in the cover-up of the events of 9-11.
[03:36:21.641 --> 03:36:41.668]  We know that not only did he post 9-11 try to stop, in fact, a former state senator, Senator Graham from Florida, basically said that, look, we want to go to San Diego and find out what an FBI informant is doing providing cover and shelter for a Saudi terrorist.
[03:36:42.308 --> 03:36:43.829]  And Mueller tried to stop him.
[03:36:43.829 --> 03:36:58.415]  We know also that when the 9-11 Commission was hearing witnesses' testimony, that Mueller was sending minders to that testimony to try to intimidate federal agents and witnesses of new things from telling what they knew.
[03:36:58.415 --> 03:37:08.099]  He, and we know that Mueller, that the FBI agents that were blowing the whistle on a, that were trying to stop a oncoming
[03:37:09.820 --> 03:37:16.263]  Terrorists attacked, they were punished, lost their security clearance, essentially some of them drummed out of the FBI.
[03:37:16.263 --> 03:37:21.705]  However, the agents that are willing to lie, take orders, do the wrong thing, they get promoted, they get raises, they get money.
[03:37:21.705 --> 03:37:23.326]  Let's talk about anthrax.
[03:37:23.326 --> 03:37:26.267]  Anthrax, of course, five people died, a horrible thing.
[03:37:26.267 --> 03:37:30.449]  Coincidentally or not, two of the anthrax samples were directed to senators that were
[03:37:30.789 --> 03:37:31.550]  We're good.
[03:37:48.602 --> 03:37:56.750]  You know, that mid-easterners in caves do not have the technology and the science and the capability to produce anthrax.
[03:37:56.750 --> 03:37:58.791]  They don't have the giant centrifuges.
[03:37:58.791 --> 03:38:05.738]  They don't have the systems to produce it to microscopic levels and then make it be aerosolized.
[03:38:06.650 --> 03:38:07.251]  There you go.
[03:38:07.251 --> 03:38:08.672]  That's exactly right.
[03:38:08.672 --> 03:38:23.247]  And in addition, Alex, after the scientists blew that first theory out of the water, then Mueller, people are saying that this has to be an American lab that's doing work with American intelligence, American military.
[03:38:23.247 --> 03:38:28.532]  Well, that looks bad if we have an American lab that's doing black ops, killing people with anthrax.
[03:38:28.952 --> 03:38:30.693]  So Mueller said, well, we can't have that.
[03:38:30.693 --> 03:38:37.338]  That's going to look too bad if we get the proof that an American lab that's doing intelligence work is actually killing people.
[03:38:37.338 --> 03:38:46.144]  And by the way, Anthrax, some people think part of the agenda behind this, insofar as it could have been a black op, was to encourage the
[03:38:46.804 --> 03:38:54.066]  The passage of legislation would take away American liberties, the Patriot Act and associated... So anyway, what happens?
[03:38:54.066 --> 03:38:56.926]  They try the caveman theory, that doesn't work.
[03:38:56.926 --> 03:39:01.467]  The arrow starts pointing toward American labs, that's getting very politically incorrect.
[03:39:01.467 --> 03:39:02.228]  So what do they do?
[03:39:02.228 --> 03:39:06.729]  They pick on a scapegoat, Bruce Ivins, and what does the scientific evidence show?
[03:39:06.729 --> 03:39:07.169]  The best, top
[03:39:08.309 --> 03:39:14.551]  Biochemists in the world that work with these types of spores say, there's no way one man could have done it.
[03:39:14.551 --> 03:39:33.658]  Richard Spurzel, one of the top spore biochemical experts who works with the UNITED NATIONS said, look, it would take me a year, over a year, with my own lab, all the resources, and my own team, to try to come up with this highly weaponized, aerosolized anthracnose.
[03:39:33.658 --> 03:39:37.279]  And now we know where it came from, Fort Detrick, Maryland, at the big supply base.
[03:39:38.328 --> 03:39:38.548]  Right.
[03:39:38.548 --> 03:39:40.910]  They pointed at Ivins.
[03:39:40.910 --> 03:39:41.891]  He didn't have the team.
[03:39:41.891 --> 03:39:42.892]  He didn't have the know-how.
[03:39:42.892 --> 03:39:44.374]  He didn't have the technology.
[03:39:44.374 --> 03:39:52.661]  Scientific analysis of his anthrax sample showed that they were clearly scientifically, chemically distinct from the anthrax that was used.
[03:39:52.661 --> 03:39:54.183]  And the guy has no motive.
[03:39:54.183 --> 03:39:55.204]  Why did they pick on him?
[03:39:55.204 --> 03:39:57.786]  This is a theory that I mentioned in the book.
[03:39:57.786 --> 03:40:00.809]  He did have some emotional problems from a difficult childhood.
[03:40:01.269 --> 03:40:09.635]  He had a therapist that was an ex-drug addict or present drug addict who the FBI leaned on and she was willing to sell out her own patient.
[03:40:09.635 --> 03:40:18.381]  So all of a sudden they can discredit him, basically impugn him, scandalize him, slander him before the case ever gets to court.
[03:40:18.381 --> 03:40:24.485]  The bottom line is Bruce Ivins ends up dead before the case ever goes to court, which that's very fortuitous because
[03:40:25.505 --> 03:40:28.787]  Mueller's investigation and prosecution and his evidence was falling apart.
[03:40:28.787 --> 03:40:46.155]  By the way, the FBI agent that led this investigation sued the FBI because he said the investigation was not, it wasn't a cover-up, and that they covered up evidence that showed that I've done it.
[03:40:46.155 --> 03:40:47.415]  So, but anyway.
[03:40:47.415 --> 03:40:49.536]  I'll repeat that because you're skyping.
[03:40:49.536 --> 03:40:51.117]  The official story is he committed suicide?
[03:40:53.294 --> 03:40:57.175]  Okay.
[03:40:57.175 --> 03:40:57.735]  Okay.
[03:40:57.735 --> 03:41:10.459]  Well, the former FBI agent, Alex, that was leading the Anthrax investigation at Least Anomaly, he actually sued the FBI for trying to shut down a real investigation.
[03:41:10.459 --> 03:41:16.261]  He said that the FBI, under Mueller's leadership, sabotaged the Anthrax investigation.
[03:41:16.261 --> 03:41:18.161]  He filed a whistleblower suit.
[03:41:18.161 --> 03:41:20.142]  And of course, Bruce Ivins
[03:41:20.922 --> 03:41:27.848]  Conveniently died right when Mueller's anthrax investigation was about ready to be subject to public scrutiny.
[03:41:27.848 --> 03:41:31.712]  Yeah, they crammed a bunch of Tylenol down his throat.
[03:41:31.712 --> 03:41:33.914]  And a bunch of other people died too.
[03:41:33.914 --> 03:41:37.918]  And we'll never even have time in the time we have left next seven to get into the modern stuff he's done.
[03:41:37.918 --> 03:41:41.901]  The point is, he is the most corrupt FBI
[03:41:43.379 --> 03:41:46.540]  Director probably ever, and that's saying a lot.
[03:41:46.540 --> 03:41:48.960]  And he is a globalist.
[03:41:48.960 --> 03:41:52.601]  You can see which one about J. Edgar Hoover, he was not out to get rid of the country.
[03:41:52.601 --> 03:41:55.541]  And Mueller just is a monster.
[03:41:55.541 --> 03:41:57.682]  And is that what spurred you?
[03:41:57.682 --> 03:42:07.524]  Because you kind of described that on the inside of the book, that studying how bad this guy is, then watch the media, you would think that he's second only to Jesus Christ.
[03:42:07.524 --> 03:42:09.264]  But in reality, he is a horrible thug.
[03:42:10.806 --> 03:42:21.154]  He is, and of course we haven't even gotten to Alex, the fact that he repeated the lie to the United States Congress to help get us in war, the weapons of mass destruction.
[03:42:22.589 --> 03:42:25.972]  Uh, story, uh, put on, uh, fake news.
[03:42:25.972 --> 03:42:27.433]  This is a super bad dude.
[03:42:27.433 --> 03:42:35.520]  He's always brought forward to, to really betray people and to launch wars that kill a lot of innocent people.
[03:42:35.520 --> 03:42:39.784]  And again, that was go, Oh Jones, you say you care about our military, but you're saying these wars are wrong.
[03:42:39.784 --> 03:42:40.985]  Our military didn't like them either.
[03:42:40.985 --> 03:42:42.446]  I'm not, I'm for the military.
[03:42:42.446 --> 03:42:44.068]  I'm not for people lying to bring them to war.
[03:42:44.688 --> 03:42:49.750]  And then to take out regimes and put stuff even worse in, which is part of the plan to collapse the Middle East into Europe.
[03:42:49.750 --> 03:42:53.191]  We'll be back with some of the current stuff old Mueller's up to.
[03:42:53.191 --> 03:43:00.334]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it,
[03:43:00.954 --> 03:43:02.476]  That it lowers IQ.
[03:43:02.476 --> 03:43:05.358]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:43:05.358 --> 03:43:12.065]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:43:12.065 --> 03:43:18.331]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:43:18.331 --> 03:43:23.937]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:43:24.617 --> 03:43:31.639]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:43:31.639 --> 03:43:45.722]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:43:45.722 --> 03:43:49.963]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:43:49.963 --> 03:43:52.664]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[03:43:53.390 --> 03:43:55.751]  We all know the importance of fish oils.

[03:45:54.382 --> 03:45:59.645]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:45:59.645 --> 03:46:08.330]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:46:08.330 --> 03:46:10.291]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:46:10.291 --> 03:46:13.753]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:46:13.753 --> 03:46:16.395]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:46:16.395 --> 03:46:17.936]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:46:18.656 --> 03:46:31.073]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, Infowars.com,
[03:46:32.236 --> 03:46:35.958]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:46:35.958 --> 03:46:37.119]  We'll win.
[03:46:37.119 --> 03:46:39.941]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:46:39.941 --> 03:46:47.185]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:46:47.185 --> 03:46:50.887]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[03:46:50.887 --> 03:46:52.448]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:46:52.448 --> 03:46:53.129]  We need your support.
[03:46:53.129 --> 03:46:57.271]  I'm counting on you.
[03:46:57.271 --> 03:46:59.893]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:06.306 --> 03:47:07.750]  You are the resistance.
[03:47:27.945 --> 03:47:31.550]  Alright, final segment with John Milkovich and then I'll go.
[03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:34.675]  Well, if you're a Democrat or Republican, if you're a Christian, you have discernment.
[03:47:34.675 --> 03:47:39.421]  You know, our guest is a Democrat from Louisiana, but he's a pro-Second Amendment guy and a patriot.
[03:47:39.421 --> 03:47:42.325]  Now, it was our pleasure with his work, the book Robert Mueller.
[03:47:43.186 --> 03:47:44.607]  John Milkovich.
[03:47:44.607 --> 03:47:46.908]  He's written Robert Mueller, Aaron Boer, The New World Order.
[03:47:46.908 --> 03:47:48.848]  People can find that on his website.
[03:47:48.848 --> 03:47:54.851]  You'll have to come back or go on one of our other shows and do a whole hour just on Part 2, the moderate stuff, which a lot of us know about.
[03:47:54.851 --> 03:47:58.092]  But just in a minute or two, or three minutes or so, we have time left.
[03:47:58.092 --> 03:47:59.493]  Other points you want to say about Mueller?
[03:47:59.493 --> 03:48:02.934]  Because I'm not going to say, oh, we're tough guys, we're macho guys, we're going up against Mueller.
[03:48:04.577 --> 03:48:08.138]  I was told, I've basically been in D.C.
[03:48:08.138 --> 03:48:20.463]  at some of the biggest law firms and groups, and they literally say, man, you're crazy, Robert Mueller is a killer, he's vengeful, all these people, I know Hillary's evil, I know Mueller's evil.
[03:48:20.463 --> 03:48:27.345]  It's all these men that just think it's tough to act tough, but when it comes time to have moral courage, they have done it.
[03:48:27.345 --> 03:48:27.965]  I can't help it.
[03:48:27.965 --> 03:48:29.206]  In fact, my guts
[03:48:30.051 --> 03:48:38.655]  You know, at a certain level, don't like going up against Hillary and flying airplanes everywhere saying Hillary for president, lock her up, we launched all that.
[03:48:38.655 --> 03:48:41.136]  At a gut level, I know it's dangerous.
[03:48:41.136 --> 03:48:46.598]  But at another gut level, we're going to lose our entire culture and our society if we don't start standing up.
[03:48:46.598 --> 03:48:49.119]  I mean, there's no end to these crazy people.
[03:48:49.119 --> 03:48:52.820]  My line in the sand is they want to teach five-year-olds that they're not a boy or girl.
[03:48:52.820 --> 03:48:56.382]  My line in the sand is they want to say my kids belong to the state.
[03:48:56.382 --> 03:48:59.143]  My bottom line is they want to say churches can't preach the gospel.
[03:48:59.483 --> 03:49:01.065]  I mean, my God, these people are crazy!
[03:49:01.065 --> 03:49:07.171]  I mean, doesn't Robert Mueller and all these crooks know they just can't keep trying to enslave us forever?
[03:49:07.171 --> 03:49:09.753]  So, bottom line, I'm going to get a few other points to you.
[03:49:09.753 --> 03:49:11.515]  What was your lie in the sand?
[03:49:11.515 --> 03:49:14.718]  Because I know you do a lot of stuff that's, quote, controversial to the establishment.
[03:49:18.133 --> 03:49:27.257]  I came across multiple articles and documentaries by different journalists talking about specific episodes of corruption by Robert Mueller.
[03:49:27.257 --> 03:49:30.518]  But I kept coming after episode, after episode, after episode.
[03:49:30.518 --> 03:49:35.660]  At one point I thought, you know, someone needs to try to bring the corruption together.
[03:49:35.660 --> 03:49:37.361]  We have not exhausted it.
[03:49:37.361 --> 03:49:46.124]  We haven't even talked today about the fact that Mueller went to the United States Congress and the American people and lied and said we need wall-to-wall, 24-7,
[03:49:48.326 --> 03:49:50.408]  Total surveillance of all Americans.
[03:49:50.408 --> 03:49:58.296]  We need your phone conversations, your emails, your faxes, your texts, in order to stop 9-11, which was another lie.
[03:49:58.296 --> 03:50:03.541]  And now they've used that to politically persecute patriots and outsiders.
[03:50:03.541 --> 03:50:06.444]  Really, independence is what Trump is, trying to fix the country.
[03:50:06.444 --> 03:50:09.587]  Really, I mean, Trump, from my research, is really getting up there at bat.
[03:50:10.348 --> 03:50:15.177]  He believes if he just turns the economy back on and acts like a decent president that America would unify.
[03:50:15.177 --> 03:50:16.479]  But sadly, I'm not sure.
[03:50:16.479 --> 03:50:22.028]  America may be so diseased by the mainstream media that I'm not sure we're not too far gone at some point.
[03:50:22.028 --> 03:50:22.549]  It's very sad.
[03:50:23.669 --> 03:50:36.132]  Well, and I do think that what's happening, and there is the epic, what we call an epic disconnect between the Robert Mueller that's presented in the mainstream media and his biography.
[03:50:36.132 --> 03:50:41.554]  His biography is corruption, callousness, and carelessness with the truth.
[03:50:42.094 --> 03:50:58.885]  So, when you look at that dichotomy, so that's number one, the absolute discrepancy or chasm between the presentation and the reality, and secondly, the fact that where do we find that he has the moral or
[03:51:00.326 --> 03:51:07.808]  Moral credibility or integrity or character to conduct an investigation of this constitutional and historical magnitude.
[03:51:07.808 --> 03:51:08.768]  He does not.
[03:51:08.768 --> 03:51:19.650]  It's hard to conceive of anyone in America that would be less ethically qualified to conduct this investigation into President Trump.
[03:51:19.650 --> 03:51:22.711]  And I'll reiterate and I think you this is a theme of your
[03:51:24.171 --> 03:51:28.253]  Your media presentation, Alex, I applaud you for it.
[03:51:28.253 --> 03:51:30.874]  Donald Trump is an outsider.
[03:51:30.874 --> 03:51:37.056]  The globalists don't like him because he's standing up for an independent, sovereign, and free America.
[03:51:37.056 --> 03:51:39.357]  Mueller is no patriot.
[03:51:39.357 --> 03:51:40.938]  He's an anti-patriot.
[03:51:40.938 --> 03:51:45.699]  He's trampling the Constitution in investigation after investigation after investigation.
[03:51:45.699 --> 03:51:47.380]  The truth is collateral damage.
[03:51:53.146 --> 03:51:57.849]  It's like a football game that never ends, but I care a thousand times more.
[03:51:57.849 --> 03:52:02.593]  And we just see Trump trying to bring the country back, trying to bring people together.
[03:52:02.593 --> 03:52:06.455]  And then everything that the mainstream media says about him is really what they're doing.
[03:52:06.455 --> 03:52:09.958]  And just the increasing the lies and increasing the hate.
[03:52:09.958 --> 03:52:16.162]  It just surprises me that they've found enough people to be obstructionist and to lie like this.
[03:52:16.162 --> 03:52:19.885]  It just really scares me about how truly immoral
[03:52:21.397 --> 03:52:23.759]  The media class is.
[03:52:23.759 --> 03:52:36.532]  You know, Alex, this is my perception, and I may be wrong, you may disagree with me, but there is a generational chasm in perceptions about President Trump.
[03:52:36.532 --> 03:52:42.758]  Our generation, and I hate to say publicly how old I am, but let me say I'm certainly north of 40.
[03:52:44.628 --> 03:52:51.789]  Is seeing this president and this presidency much different than people that are in their teens, twenties, and thirties?
[03:52:51.789 --> 03:52:59.971]  And of course, I think it's the educational system in America that's been given to Common Core, and the socialists have taken over, and the agendas, and my goodness, we have to be in the classroom.
[03:52:59.971 --> 03:53:13.273]  Well sure, because after all the corruption, the whole corrupt system's coming after him, and it's so obvious he's a lion surrounded by hyenas, and then people are just, some of them are rejecting it, even though it's obviously good for them.
[03:53:14.970 --> 03:53:27.353]  I just think in our age group, there is a strong, critical mass of people that understand that this president, for all of his mistakes and errors, and the only perfect man that we know of was nailed to a tree, we know that.
[03:53:27.353 --> 03:53:31.314]  But I really get the fact that he loves America.
[03:53:31.314 --> 03:53:39.276]  And I think we need to pray for the president to connect with ethnic minorities to a greater degree than ever before, and I think he's doing that.
[03:53:39.276 --> 03:53:40.817]  I can tell you, he's been a Christian.
[03:53:42.008 --> 03:53:46.156]  But his faith has gotten much stronger, and he's been changed by all this.
[03:53:46.156 --> 03:53:49.923]  And his wife, obviously, is a driving force in that.
[03:53:49.923 --> 03:53:51.626]  They always act like she isn't supportive.
[03:53:51.626 --> 03:53:52.307]  It's the opposite.
[03:53:53.058 --> 03:53:53.758]  Okay.
[03:53:53.758 --> 03:53:56.079]  He wasn't going to run except Melania said, you got to do it.
[03:53:56.079 --> 03:53:57.600]  Okay.
[03:53:57.600 --> 03:53:59.121]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:53:59.121 --> 03:54:03.042]  And Trump did get recruited by patriots who knew what was going on five years ago.
[03:54:03.042 --> 03:54:04.643]  They said, you got to do it.
[03:54:04.643 --> 03:54:07.064]  They were looking at taking Obama out.
[03:54:07.064 --> 03:54:11.686]  And then they made the decision to try to relaunch the Republican, turn the economy on and all this stuff.
[03:54:11.686 --> 03:54:12.867]  And it's just, it's going to be a mess.
[03:54:12.867 --> 03:54:15.108]  I'm telling you a civil war folks, we don't fix this peacefully.
[03:54:15.888 --> 03:54:20.973]  And that's why I'm willing to stick it out there because the future is so horrible.
[03:54:20.973 --> 03:54:23.195]  I mean, we're talking nuclear war and stuff.
[03:54:23.195 --> 03:54:25.237]  Hillary was going to start wars.
[03:54:25.237 --> 03:54:27.038]  We've got three minutes left.
[03:54:27.038 --> 03:54:29.260]  You were getting into Lyft during the break.
[03:54:29.260 --> 03:54:30.602]  Praying for the president.
[03:54:30.602 --> 03:54:31.663]  Where all this is going.
[03:54:31.663 --> 03:54:37.648]  Gut-level state senator, author of Robert Mueller, errand boy for the New World Order, John Milkovich.
[03:54:37.648 --> 03:54:38.289]  Closing comments.
[03:54:39.059 --> 03:55:02.807]  Well, you know, Alex, I want to thank you so much for your very courageous contributions to the public debate and bring into the fore the fact that there is corruption in this country and that some of the people that are represented, as I say in the book, that Robert Mueller is depicted as an on-time press white shirt, Eagle Scout, Dudley Do-Right, just the opposite is true.
[03:55:02.807 --> 03:55:06.788]  And thank goodness for you and others like you that have the courage.
[03:55:06.788 --> 03:55:08.569]  We're able to go ahead and really
[03:55:09.528 --> 03:55:15.895]  Expose the fact that he's a schemer, he's an operator, and he has been for at least 30 years.
[03:55:15.895 --> 03:55:18.118]  And I want to close with this, if I may.
[03:55:18.118 --> 03:55:21.882]  You know, this book could be depressing because we see this man has this amazing power.
[03:55:22.426 --> 03:55:24.407]  So powerful and yet so very corrupt.
[03:55:24.407 --> 03:55:26.167]  It's very threatening to the Republic.
[03:55:26.167 --> 03:55:43.854]  But the really encouraging thing about this is the fact that so many writers and investigators, and by the way we quote your investigative team, and federal agents and soldiers and veterans and the victims, the families of the victims of 9-11 have come forward and brought this information.
[03:55:43.854 --> 03:55:45.115]  I think this is a great book.
[03:55:45.635 --> 03:55:53.284]  Not because I was involved, but because of all the people that sacrificed much and risked everything to bring these facts to the fore.
[03:55:53.284 --> 03:55:59.050]  And that's what we try to do, is compile the very courageous findings and investigative results of other folks.
[03:56:00.632 --> 03:56:02.913]  We're going to continue to pray for you, Alex.
[03:56:02.913 --> 03:56:07.655]  We're going to continue to pray for our president, for Roger.
[03:56:07.655 --> 03:56:08.355]  I've never met him.
[03:56:08.355 --> 03:56:10.376]  I'm referring to him by his first name.
[03:56:10.376 --> 03:56:11.156]  I've never met him.
[03:56:11.156 --> 03:56:14.217]  And Dr. Corsi.
[03:56:14.217 --> 03:56:20.600]  You know, it's very important that y'all have had the backbone to bring these issues to the fore.
[03:56:20.600 --> 03:56:21.020]  Well, thank you.
[03:56:21.020 --> 03:56:25.002]  When I say depressing, it feels good to know you're there and the book's there and people are standing up.
[03:56:25.002 --> 03:56:25.402]  It's just
[03:56:27.143 --> 03:56:28.724]  It's beyond depressing.
[03:56:28.724 --> 03:56:30.205]  It's like it's an object.
[03:56:30.205 --> 03:56:36.450]  It's a creature in our way that's threatening our whole existence that is an abomination.
[03:56:36.450 --> 03:56:41.373]  And then they add the sickening gravy or the icing of the worship of him.
[03:56:41.373 --> 03:56:43.515]  And I see grown men scared of him.
[03:56:43.515 --> 03:56:52.962]  And the fact that he's tried to set me up about liberty to get into it, all of it, and that they obsess over me, and I know I'm totally innocent, and that he's delivering uranium on tarmacs.
[03:56:54.626 --> 03:56:55.607]  To the Russians.
[03:56:55.607 --> 03:56:56.568]  To the Russians.
[03:56:56.568 --> 03:56:57.648]  To the Russians.
[03:56:57.648 --> 03:56:59.229]  To the Russians.
[03:56:59.229 --> 03:57:01.071]  Is that Russian collusion?
[03:57:01.071 --> 03:57:03.252]  Taking highly enriched uranium?
[03:57:03.252 --> 03:57:06.434]  Don't hold your breath waiting for the mainstream media to report that.
[03:57:06.434 --> 03:57:09.276]  I just want to see him indicted.
[03:57:09.276 --> 03:57:14.780]  And you know, if I have to put myself in danger to make sure that he gets brought to justice, so be it.
[03:57:14.780 --> 03:57:15.961]  But I'll tell these guys something.
[03:57:17.401 --> 03:57:20.062]  You know, they really have been breaking the rules of chivalry.
[03:57:20.062 --> 03:57:23.682]  And I really am concerned for everybody if this goes much further.
[03:57:23.682 --> 03:57:27.883]  Because I can tell you, there are a lot of people that aren't going to put up with this stuff anymore.
[03:57:27.883 --> 03:57:29.403]  It's just that simple.
[03:57:29.403 --> 03:57:31.244]  Thank you so much, Senator, for coming on.
[03:57:31.244 --> 03:57:32.124]  I look forward to speaking to you again.
[03:57:32.124 --> 03:57:33.364]  God bless.
[03:57:33.364 --> 03:57:34.424]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:57:34.424 --> 03:57:35.745]  Thank you very much.
[03:57:35.745 --> 03:57:37.845]  We'll be back with Roger Stone, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:57:37.845 --> 03:57:40.006]  We are living in epic times.
[03:57:40.006 --> 03:57:42.046]  That word gets overused, but this is an epic time.
[03:57:43.544 --> 03:57:51.010]  Monday through next Sunday, we are bringing back the biggest sales in our history.

[03:58:18.248 --> 03:58:19.509]  It's an amazing system.
[03:58:19.509 --> 03:58:20.889]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars.
[03:58:20.889 --> 03:58:21.970]  They're trying to defund us.
[03:58:21.970 --> 03:58:24.391]  So I said, everything must go by the end of the year.
[03:58:24.691 --> 03:58:28.935]  So that we'll at least have the cash to continue operating for a while.
