[00:00.000 --> 00:15.520]  Yes Christmas 2016 has come and gone and now we are accelerating at blast speed
[00:15.520 --> 00:20.440]  in fact we ought to go out with old and sire I don't know what that means but
[00:20.440 --> 00:25.560]  talking about all the old folks you knew all the friends life all the years that
[00:25.560 --> 00:31.720]  have come and gone because we're full steam ahead into 2017 and they're
[00:31.720 --> 00:36.120]  always ramming through all sorts of legislation and pardons and you know
[00:36.120 --> 00:40.680]  late-night executive orders in and around Christmas in the new year so
[00:40.680 --> 00:46.160]  infowars.com is covering all of that in live time as we speak I am taping this
[00:46.160 --> 00:50.320]  well ahead of this Monday retransmission I'll be back word-willing
[00:50.320 --> 00:56.680]  tomorrow on Tuesday live for the full four hours I think I'm doing on Monday
[00:56.680 --> 01:01.600]  but this is quite a retransmission we had Max Kaiser despite the fact he had a
[01:01.600 --> 01:05.560]  lot going on his life and family wise the day he was here I was surprised he
[01:05.560 --> 01:08.560]  stayed in town was on the show he was obviously going through a lot he's a
[01:08.560 --> 01:12.680]  great guy Max Kaiser was in studio with us in the first hour that he stayed
[01:12.680 --> 01:16.680]  another day and brought Adam Curry who's actually a big anti-new-world order guy
[01:16.680 --> 01:21.720]  not just the most famous MTV host when it was first founded so I had Max Kaiser
[01:21.720 --> 01:25.880]  and Adam Curry in studio then Anthony Kumiya and Gavin McGinnis did a great
[01:25.880 --> 01:30.120]  job Kumiya hosted an hour Gavin McGinnis was a guest on the show but they were
[01:30.120 --> 01:34.000]  both honest I always enjoy hearing from them so they were on the retransmission
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.480]  and they were obviously on McGinnis was on December 5th Kumiya December 8th
[01:38.480 --> 01:44.760]  Adam Curry December 9th Max Kaiser December 8th so that is all coming up
[01:44.760 --> 01:48.440]  here in just a few minutes I can't even see that clock okay it's counting down
[01:48.440 --> 01:51.960]  good we're doing good these look at the atomic clock not the not the counter up
[01:51.960 --> 01:58.160]  there on that clock but look I've got a lot to be thankful for how much of the
[01:58.160 --> 02:01.320]  world has taken back its destiny from the globalist I mean it's exciting what
[02:01.320 --> 02:04.760]  America's doing what the UK's doing what Spain's doing Italy's doing Brazil's
[02:04.760 --> 02:09.920]  trying to do it's always a battle between good and evil but the fact that we
[02:09.920 --> 02:13.560]  do have so many good things in this world is why I passionately expose the
[02:13.560 --> 02:17.600]  bad things it's not because I'm obsessed with those bad things it's because I'm
[02:17.600 --> 02:23.320]  obsessed with the good things and desperately want to protect myself my
[02:23.320 --> 02:26.920]  family and that means the culture in general I have a lot of empathy for the
[02:26.920 --> 02:30.680]  average person because I understand how other people get treated is how I get
[02:30.680 --> 02:36.320]  treated and I look at Islam which is the orthodox Islam run around killing
[02:36.320 --> 02:39.320]  people and running folks over the rest of it and having their own little kids go
[02:39.320 --> 02:42.640]  suicide bomb and there's a footage we covered last week of the little kids
[02:42.640 --> 02:46.080]  with little girls their mother getting ready to go blow themselves up and how
[02:46.080 --> 02:51.640]  sad they are I didn't want these wars on the Muslims I knew it was meant to stir
[02:51.640 --> 02:54.960]  them up and then bring them into Europe and cause a class of civilizations so
[02:54.960 --> 02:58.440]  that the globalists can play both sides against each other in solid a power but
[02:58.440 --> 03:02.440]  Islam is bullied by the most radical factions of it and the left won't even
[03:02.440 --> 03:06.760]  to cry it because they see it as a natural ally against the West and so I've
[03:06.760 --> 03:10.960]  got to expose the student with the clock that looks like a briefcase bomb and
[03:10.960 --> 03:14.520]  won't say why it's counting down in a publicity stunt you know I've got to
[03:14.520 --> 03:19.600]  pose and oppose the Muslim guy that you know gets the tens of millions of years
[03:19.600 --> 03:23.440]  on YouTube going on airplanes and counting down in Arabic and you know
[03:23.440 --> 03:28.360]  scaring the hell out everybody and doing it on purpose but I blame more than
[03:28.360 --> 03:33.280]  him and his stunts and his fear mongering on MSM that run stories every
[03:33.280 --> 03:37.520]  time saying this poor innocent Muslim got kicked off the plane when you can see
[03:37.520 --> 03:41.160]  the videos black people white people his Spanish you name it freaking out when
[03:41.160 --> 03:47.720]  it goes like a lot of people know they get ready and you know when they're
[03:47.720 --> 03:51.600]  about to do their deal that's what happens Allah Akbar well there's trucks
[03:51.600 --> 03:53.720]  running down the road people getting shot I'm not saying this guy's gonna do
[03:53.720 --> 03:57.720]  something like that but it's all a big joke to him monetizing YouTube and
[03:57.720 --> 04:01.160]  gaming everyone like the kid with the briefcase that you open up it's got
[04:01.160 --> 04:05.240]  wires and clocks and it's counting down and what is that he says I will not tell
[04:05.240 --> 04:08.440]  you cops man what is that son I will not tell you well we're arresting you
[04:08.440 --> 04:12.260]  then get the bomb squad oh my god the evil people don't like the Muslims the
[04:12.260 --> 04:15.560]  Muslims don't let you come to their countries and exercise your religion or
[04:15.560 --> 04:20.040]  freedom then they come here that's why all these Muslim countries are 99% Muslim
[04:20.040 --> 04:25.400]  or more Saudi Arabia you name it because they're not being compatible with us and
[04:25.400 --> 04:28.960]  the globalists are bringing them in to bring down our free civilization I want
[04:28.960 --> 04:32.160]  to reform the Muslims I don't want to kill them they're people too I want to
[04:32.160 --> 04:34.920]  watch those little girls with their mommy making them go blow themselves up
[04:34.920 --> 04:39.600]  and their daddy I want to save those little girls
[04:39.600 --> 04:44.640]  just think about it they see Christmas trees and little kids out want to run
[04:44.640 --> 04:47.640]  them over and the left's like well they deserve to be run over and you know the
[04:47.640 --> 04:51.280]  Russian ambassador deserve to be killed because you know he's being mean to the
[04:51.280 --> 04:58.040]  jihadis that's our sick left they're the real filth we'll be back stay with us
[04:58.040 --> 05:01.760]  it was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady
[05:01.760 --> 05:05.200]  of course has to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit by
[05:05.200 --> 05:09.200]  consolidation of power first and then corruption it's necessary consequence
[05:09.200 --> 05:12.800]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite the 1% of the 1%
[05:12.800 --> 05:16.120]  consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in
[05:16.120 --> 05:19.560]  government unfortunately we didn't heed his advice we now live in a neo-
[05:19.560 --> 05:23.360]  feudalistic society which were treated as indentured servants who only exist to
[05:23.360 --> 05:26.640]  serve the needs of the establishment political office no longer represents
[05:26.640 --> 05:29.920]  the voice of the people but rather the initiation process politicians go
[05:29.920 --> 05:33.640]  through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy simply put we the people are
[05:33.640 --> 05:37.040]  responsible for civilization and culture yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite
[05:37.040 --> 05:39.840]  who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the
[05:39.840 --> 05:43.840]  world we falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme
[05:43.840 --> 05:47.120]  against the other conservative versus liberal but things will change once
[05:47.120 --> 05:50.760]  more of us realize this truth as Thomas Jefferson also said in light of the
[05:50.760 --> 05:54.160]  people generally and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish

[07:50.320 --> 07:55.080]  that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so revolutionary today
[07:55.080 --> 07:58.600]  then for war store.com
[08:01.080 --> 08:07.840]  is the US involved with any procuring of weapons transfer of weapons buying
[08:07.840 --> 08:17.600]  selling anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya to Turkey it is a
[08:17.600 --> 08:24.600]  big idea a new world order. How is it that this organization is so well funded so
[08:24.600 --> 08:29.320]  organized? Lamek state linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya
[08:29.320 --> 08:35.040]  seizing new economically vital areas of the country. The leader of ISIS in Libya is
[08:35.040 --> 08:40.160]  none other than Abdul Hakeem Bel-Hajj and of course he was on to the teeth by
[08:40.160 --> 08:45.240]  NATO. A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order. The
[08:45.240 --> 08:48.800]  Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military
[08:48.800 --> 08:53.400]  exercise Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up creating an ominous
[08:53.400 --> 08:57.920]  alliance against the United States. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
[08:57.920 --> 09:01.680]  is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the US government is
[09:01.680 --> 09:05.800]  negotiating with Iran. Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli
[09:05.800 --> 09:10.480]  jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on Iran. We have an unprecedented
[09:10.480 --> 09:16.520]  opportunity to build a new world order. I set up a foundation in Ukraine and
[09:16.520 --> 09:21.880]  created an important part in events now. Ukraine is set to receive the first
[09:21.880 --> 09:26.840]  tranche of international monetary fund aid package. We had broker the deal to
[09:26.840 --> 09:34.120]  transition power in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is on the move. Only when this
[09:34.120 --> 09:39.440]  transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the
[09:39.440 --> 09:45.600]  opportunities presented by this new and involving world order. It's known as the
[09:45.600 --> 09:56.880]  Bilderberg Group. Could their objective be world domination? From the front lines
[09:56.880 --> 10:02.600]  of the information war this is the info war and I'm your host Alex Jones and a
[10:02.600 --> 10:06.040]  guy I've been interviewing for I don't know like 13, 14 years Max Kaiser is our
[10:06.040 --> 10:11.960]  guest. He's been on BBC, he's been on RT, Al Jazeera, US television, a famous
[10:11.960 --> 10:18.200]  successful stockbroker in his own right in New York. Back on CBS TV back in
[10:18.200 --> 10:22.960]  the 80s with all his shenanigans. Not aging very much though. The portrait of
[10:22.960 --> 10:26.160]  Darian Gray there or whatever his name is. But seriously you're here I guess to
[10:26.160 --> 10:29.800]  interview me for your RT. Yeah you're a tough man to get a hold of Alex Jones.
[10:29.800 --> 10:33.600]  You know I mean here you are redefining media in America. You've redefined alt
[10:33.600 --> 10:36.560]  media in America. You've brought over the message of the masses to the
[10:36.560 --> 10:39.680]  population altered the course of the recent election. Alex Jones. So we're
[10:39.680 --> 10:42.360]  here to interview Alex Jones of course. No one else can get an interview with you.
[10:42.360 --> 10:45.200]  All the mainstream media you're snubbing them rightfully so because they're
[10:45.200 --> 10:48.120]  all toggle nights. They're out of touch. They don't know what they're doing. So
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.920]  only my show Kaiser Report on RT was able to get an interview with Alex Jones.
[10:51.920 --> 10:55.840]  Well I wasn't gonna brag about that but I mean why they don't do real interviews.
[10:55.840 --> 11:00.260]  They talk to you for three hours, edit it to act like their journalist and
[11:00.260 --> 11:04.400]  twist it. What's the point? Well we're seeing the death of mainstream media
[11:04.400 --> 11:08.680]  which is fantastic because all these corporations all turned into this
[11:08.680 --> 11:12.680]  oligopoly where they just five or six corporations own all the media output
[11:12.680 --> 11:14.800]  in America. And it's in the WikiLeaks like you always said though it's a
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.600]  talking point. It comes out from the corporation to the White House or whatever
[11:18.600 --> 11:21.240]  and then it just gets repeated by everybody. Well yeah that's why the so
[11:21.240 --> 11:23.920]  called fake news because there's no competition. There's not enough
[11:23.920 --> 11:28.400]  diversity in media. So you end up with five or six media outlets rushing to be
[11:28.400 --> 11:31.760]  the first to report on a story. Look the new and alternative media isn't perfect
[11:31.760 --> 11:35.440]  because it's so huge and so diverse but to have the big six kilometer it's now
[11:35.440 --> 11:39.240]  it's five pointing at everything but them and saying it's all fake when
[11:39.240 --> 11:42.600]  they're so discredited. This is desperate. Look at Brian Williams. I mean he was
[11:42.600 --> 11:46.960]  caught floating fake news and he's a fake news caster and they booted him from
[11:46.960 --> 11:50.040]  his prime time. Can I say I was an astronaut maybe the first man on the
[11:50.040 --> 11:55.400]  moon? Well that's it's your show Alex. I would not want to interfere with
[11:55.400 --> 11:59.120]  anything you have to say. Let's see the equivalent of that. He was shot down by
[11:59.120 --> 12:06.480]  RPG in Iraq. Not true. Right. So they manufacture news you know. Noam Chomsky
[12:06.480 --> 12:09.800]  wrote a famous book Manufacturing Consent how the mainstream media is
[12:09.800 --> 12:15.360]  co-opted for the corporate agenda and that is the or that is a textbook on how
[12:15.360 --> 12:20.160]  to create fake news. Now the old media space and what Infowars has done has
[12:20.160 --> 12:29.080]  been to bring a news source to America but also introduce what I would call the
[12:29.080 --> 12:36.560]  the acid meme to shoot down the fake news of the mainstream media. So when they
[12:36.560 --> 12:42.080]  jump on some of these stories that are let's say Pepe the Frog for example
[12:42.080 --> 12:47.480]  which turned into a Hillary Clinton bashing killing meme that generated
[12:47.480 --> 12:51.360]  from 4chan and generated from the internet. It was picked up by- It caused a
[12:51.360 --> 12:55.720]  Streisand effect. Right. It caused a Streisand effect. She buys into it and she
[12:55.720 --> 12:59.400]  looks stupid but because she's not really in touch with how the media works in
[12:59.400 --> 13:03.960]  America anymore she sets herself up to look stupid. People who are actually
[13:03.960 --> 13:08.040]  involved in media every single day who quote multiple media sources go to
[13:08.040 --> 13:13.040]  international media sources. They saw the gestation of that fake meme. Exactly.
[13:13.040 --> 13:17.440]  It's not that any of us are perfect but we just go to the wide
[13:17.440 --> 13:21.560]  spectrum different views. We're not in the regurgitation echo chamber. They're
[13:21.560 --> 13:25.880]  in. They're claiming we're in an echo chamber. We're in a total free-for-all.
[13:25.880 --> 13:30.440]  I've been on RT. I've done a thousand shows for RT. Russia today comes out of
[13:30.440 --> 13:35.360]  Moscow. They claim that Russia's behind all of these interrupts. Have you ever
[13:35.360 --> 13:39.200]  gotten a talking point? I've never been asked to talk to any of these sources.
[13:39.200 --> 13:42.640]  New York Times has never asked me to say it to be a talk to them or any
[13:42.640 --> 13:45.200]  mainstream media outlet. You would think that they would want to talk to me. You've
[13:45.200 --> 13:48.400]  told me that. I've got the number one. You've told me the Russians never give you
[13:48.400 --> 13:52.520]  any talking points. It's like unheard of. Everybody I know that's been on RT says
[13:52.520 --> 13:56.160]  I've probably been on there 200 times. They've never told me don't cover this
[13:56.160 --> 13:59.400]  or do that. You try to go and see it in. It's like three hour interrogation.
[13:59.400 --> 14:03.880]  BBC is the worst. You put you through three or four interrogations
[14:03.880 --> 14:07.560]  before you go on and a lot of times they just steal your stuff and give it to
[14:07.560 --> 14:10.400]  some other producer and they don't even know. That's what they do. They get you
[14:10.400 --> 14:14.400]  there and they'll have three guests only planning one and then interrogate you.
[14:14.400 --> 14:18.440]  Find out what you're going to say and I learned you've got to actually lie to him.
[14:18.440 --> 14:22.160]  I never lie but this is a military operation against him. I would lie just to
[14:22.160 --> 14:26.120]  get on. I started saying I'm not going to lie to get on. I had to lie to them
[14:26.120 --> 14:29.760]  about what I was going to do to Pierce Morgan. Well it's amazing how remember
[14:29.760 --> 14:35.120]  you were on to get on live. The big big was live. Andrew Neal show in on BBC
[14:35.120 --> 14:39.640]  where you got you know he made a gesture you know like you were a crazy
[14:39.640 --> 14:46.440]  person but now who's who's who's looking crazy. I mean the BBC has been aghast
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.240]  at the Brexit vote the rise of Nigel Farage and they were the Italians just
[14:51.240 --> 14:54.480]  voted to start getting out of the EU. Right they're totally caught flat-footed
[14:54.480 --> 14:56.920]  because they're not in touch with actually what's happening in in the
[14:56.920 --> 15:00.480]  media space what's happening in the news and they totally misunderstood what
[15:00.480 --> 15:04.680]  you're all about and what you're doing and so now we have the Trump effect and
[15:04.680 --> 15:08.280]  the Trump effect is a remarkable phenomenon in American history. This is
[15:08.280 --> 15:13.400]  basically and we're gonna see now the Constitution in action because I think
[15:13.400 --> 15:18.200]  Trump is going to approach this presidency in a way that we haven't seen
[15:18.200 --> 15:22.000]  maybe ever. He's gonna just take he doesn't he's not beholden to anyone. He's
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.520]  gonna take a look at every single deal every single relationship and it's up
[15:25.520 --> 15:29.000]  for review. That's like he said everything should be a deal-by-deal basis not
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.080]  some secret multinational agreement we then don't get to even look at and then
[15:33.080 --> 15:36.960]  we follow and by the way I was I tend to exaggerate when I'm putting myself down.
[15:36.960 --> 15:40.640]  I wouldn't even call it lying. It's like you try to call in to talk radio if you
[15:40.640 --> 15:43.640]  don't say what they agree with they won't you get past the call screener so
[15:43.640 --> 15:47.200]  you've kind of got to put out a topic they want to hear to actually get on or
[15:47.200 --> 15:51.760]  c-span or anything and and so you basically have to play dumb before you
[15:51.760 --> 15:56.040]  can get on CNN or Fox but they've learned that of course they always break they
[15:56.040 --> 16:00.120]  always attack first I said yes I won't attack if he doesn't attack so then he
[16:00.120 --> 16:03.720]  attacks so then I attack now that's not really lying it's just what I'm saying
[16:03.720 --> 16:07.920]  is they are super deceptive so you've got to get into deception mode to even
[16:07.920 --> 16:13.640]  get on their channels because it's so scripted. You've got to get into having
[16:13.640 --> 16:19.080]  a way to break through their their wall their monopolization of the media and
[16:19.080 --> 16:22.640]  you've successfully done that and you've brought over the transom a guy like
[16:22.640 --> 16:25.640]  Donald Trump so now Donald Trump is president of the United States. I don't
[16:25.640 --> 16:29.120]  want to take credit for Trump but what's crazy is I'm just gonna leave it at this
[16:29.120 --> 16:33.400]  the Trump folks give me credit and then you know mainstream media makes jokes
[16:33.400 --> 16:37.200]  and goes oh yeah Trump's just manipulating Jones no they have the
[16:37.200 --> 16:41.720]  metrics I mean they're there with the numbers they know we have a monthly
[16:41.720 --> 16:45.640]  reach just on Facebook of a billion people. I don't know why anyone
[16:45.640 --> 16:48.760]  wouldn't think that you were directly involved but I'm not trying to brag about
[16:48.760 --> 16:52.600]  me you're huge as well I mean RT has what 18 million viewers routinely for
[16:52.600 --> 16:56.840]  your show the point is is that and your show is just about global news and
[16:56.840 --> 17:03.320]  information. Yeah but you know we we have been censored heavily in the UK on
[17:03.320 --> 17:06.440]  our show you know the regulator let's talk about that yeah the regulator in the
[17:06.440 --> 17:11.960]  UK off-com routinely censors us we in other words Russia today and RT they
[17:11.960 --> 17:16.440]  they never censor us they never give us any editorial guidance whatsoever
[17:16.440 --> 17:20.000]  we're free to be journalists. And let's be clear I've read UK news they're
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.400]  pushing to get RT off TV there. They're always pushing that always pushing to get
[17:23.400 --> 17:26.480]  RT off the air because it represents competition and they hate competition
[17:26.480 --> 17:29.080]  they don't want any competing views whatsoever they want only the government
[17:29.080 --> 17:32.080]  line. Well I saw the number 18 million a week for your show is that
[17:32.080 --> 17:36.040]  conservative? Well yeah it grows pretty rapidly as you know the station itself
[17:36.040 --> 17:38.880]  gets 70 million viewers a month now I think it's think it's number two. You're
[17:38.880 --> 17:45.200]  one of the hottest shows. Well we get 20 25 million viewers a week I guess per show
[17:45.200 --> 17:50.680]  it's very widely bigger than 18 million that's grown okay but I just want to
[17:50.680 --> 17:55.520]  point out it's the info that's popular and they're there all arrogant like
[17:55.520 --> 17:59.560]  they're movie stars at CNN when their average show has 200,000 viewers they're
[17:59.560 --> 18:03.160]  a paper tiger facade can we say the mainstream media has now officially died?
[18:03.160 --> 18:08.440]  You know who's officially I think on the ropes are the young Turks. I mean I'm
[18:08.440 --> 18:11.560]  at the young Turks incident leading up to this election I think was classic
[18:11.560 --> 18:15.400]  Alex Jones because the young Turks were so snide they were so arrogant they were
[18:15.400 --> 18:19.560]  so full of themselves they had so so much confidence that their girl Hilary
[18:19.560 --> 18:23.600]  was gonna win. Alex Jones just did the Alex Jones saying and walked onto the
[18:23.600 --> 18:26.200]  set and said you know there's other there's another country out there it's
[18:26.200 --> 18:29.360]  not just happening in your studio there's other people out there with other
[18:29.360 --> 18:33.920]  concerns and they were very dismissive of you and they look completely
[18:33.920 --> 18:37.400]  uninformed and out of touch and what we've noticed on our show you know a lot
[18:37.400 --> 18:41.560]  of people a lot of celebrities said if Trump is going to win the presidency
[18:41.560 --> 18:44.520]  they're gonna leave America you know I said if Trump's gonna win the presidency
[18:44.520 --> 18:48.360]  I'll come back to America you know I'm we're back we're doing we're doing
[18:48.360 --> 18:52.200]  reports all over America to talk to people who voted for Trump because the
[18:52.200 --> 18:55.480]  mainstream media did not talk to anyone. I want to skip this break so we have more
[18:55.480 --> 19:00.240]  time max why do you think suddenly they say restaurant traffic something like
[19:00.240 --> 19:04.800]  40% suddenly factory orders were up in a record number suddenly Japan's gonna
[19:04.800 --> 19:09.200]  invest 50 billion in high tech next year suddenly Ford says we'll come
[19:09.200 --> 19:13.360]  completely back because we have a president who isn't out to sell us out.
[19:13.360 --> 19:17.640]  Confidence you know business relies on confidence America is a country built on
[19:17.640 --> 19:23.600]  the notion of fake it to you make it you know it's the land of the entrepreneur
[19:23.600 --> 19:27.120]  and Donald Trump's an entrepreneur and he awakens the entrepreneur he's
[19:27.120 --> 19:31.160]  Americana he is Americana so it's like a horse and carriage when I say when I
[19:31.160 --> 19:36.800]  compare him to oh well look at Stephen Jobs for a second here's a guy who took
[19:36.800 --> 19:40.800]  products that were made by the US government everything in an iPhone is
[19:40.800 --> 19:44.960]  comes out of the US government DARPA program he didn't invent anything you
[19:44.960 --> 19:49.760]  can't write a line of code but he's a great promoter and he designed package
[19:49.760 --> 19:53.920]  a great package to great products that the taxpayer essentially funded and he
[19:53.920 --> 19:56.920]  packaged it beautifully something called the iPhone and Apple's the biggest
[19:56.920 --> 19:59.400]  company in the world same thing Boeing did right now they've got hundreds of
[19:59.400 --> 20:03.080]  billions of dollars offshore and Trump is Trump I'm pretty sure it comes gonna
[20:03.080 --> 20:10.080]  say look either open a factory in the US to build iPhones or you're gonna be
[20:10.080 --> 20:13.520]  you're gonna lose that 250 billion dollars parked offshore it's your choice
[20:13.520 --> 20:17.840]  in other words doesn't kind of deal he's gonna do he's saying look bro you know we
[20:17.840 --> 20:22.440]  built your whole deal you know you're you're going to come back here look all
[20:22.440 --> 20:30.280]  American success has its root the American coast-to-coast structural
[20:30.280 --> 20:35.000]  infrastructural connectivity of the highway system the internet system and
[20:35.000 --> 20:39.160]  a common currency in a common government the American system and so
[20:39.160 --> 20:43.760]  corporations who don't pay heed to that we're not willing to recognize that who
[20:43.760 --> 20:48.320]  take everything offshore after they build a value here Trump is saying uh-huh
[20:48.320 --> 20:52.160]  you know you're gonna have to pay you're gonna make of these leftist unions and I
[20:52.160 --> 20:56.400]  know it's not left or right but after he saves 1,080 of the jobs he couldn't
[20:56.400 --> 21:00.560]  save 320 and the head of the union that Trump's been so gracious to comes out
[21:00.560 --> 21:05.160]  and bitches and said you lied keep them all before he's even in office he said
[21:05.160 --> 21:08.560]  once I get in you know if people are doing unfair stuff I'll do you know you
[21:08.560 --> 21:13.480]  know one-part deals that put tariffs on you and now the left is all bitching
[21:13.480 --> 21:17.560]  taking his victory turning it into a defeat but then some leftists that are
[21:17.560 --> 21:21.400]  being more honest are saying we need to back off this is actually populism the
[21:21.400 --> 21:25.440]  American people want this the country's falling apart let's not kill America so
[21:25.440 --> 21:28.720]  I think they went to the point of actually wanting to kill the Golden
[21:28.720 --> 21:32.560]  Goose the globalist corporations actually thought that they could mount our
[21:32.560 --> 21:36.680]  head on the wall but the people the intelligence agencies the info wars
[21:36.680 --> 21:40.560]  audience and others basically staged a counter coup against these people and
[21:40.560 --> 21:46.320]  they are panicking right now they are hysterical that's all you want you know
[21:46.320 --> 21:52.480]  the union leaders of course are going to be lobbying for their union advocates
[21:52.480 --> 21:57.880]  to for for union needs union agenda that's fantastic sure but how do they
[21:57.880 --> 22:02.560]  bitch when they the same union couldn't keep the business there Obama didn't
[22:02.560 --> 22:05.960]  even care Trump keeps 80 plus percent of the business and they're not happy I
[22:05.960 --> 22:11.160]  think he's he's just gonna basically continue along the path of creating a
[22:11.160 --> 22:14.960]  much more fertile environment for jobs high-paying jobs I'll tell you what's
[22:14.960 --> 22:19.400]  gonna be interesting though is that you know the fact is that real wages in
[22:19.400 --> 22:23.760]  America have gone down for years however because of globalization prices for stuff
[22:23.760 --> 22:29.200]  like DVDs and high you know televisions and clothing have gone down faster so
[22:29.200 --> 22:34.280]  even though the average American quality of life has let's say gone down in some
[22:34.280 --> 22:38.000]  regards or wages have gone down you what you don't feel it that much wages have
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.160]  gotten cheaper because the prices of products at Walmart have have gone by
[22:42.160 --> 22:45.680]  the way that's the one thing that Karl Marx really got right have dropped faster
[22:45.680 --> 22:48.880]  so let me finish so so if in other words if Trump says let's bring in higher
[22:48.880 --> 22:52.560]  wages and your real incomes are gonna go up well that means that probably the
[22:52.560 --> 22:56.000]  prices for stuff are gonna go start going higher than wages will start going
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.480]  higher so in a lot of ways you your income may go up a lot but your quality
[23:00.480 --> 23:05.000]  of life might not go up but we still need the industrial base to be a sovereign
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.400]  nation and to be self-respecting people we have to have a world built where
[23:09.400 --> 23:13.960]  humans are involved in things or we basically rot and die I think the
[23:13.960 --> 23:16.880]  industry that's gonna get hit is the defense industry I mean we saw it
[23:16.880 --> 23:21.240]  already with the the discussion about Air Force One he's willing to take on the
[23:21.240 --> 23:24.320]  defense contractor who built Air Force One and saying that you know it's over
[23:24.320 --> 23:27.800]  priced and stock you know took a hit as a result that's clearly where he's gonna
[23:27.800 --> 23:31.360]  be able to start paying down America's debt America's got 20 trillion dollars
[23:31.360 --> 23:35.840]  with the debt yeah it's not anti-american to say we should be paying a
[23:35.840 --> 23:41.160]  billion dollars for a fighter jet that the F-15 they admit is better no I mean a
[23:41.160 --> 23:46.400]  25 30 year old plane is better than this billion plus dollar plane that is a
[23:46.400 --> 23:51.640]  piece of crap yeah that's where he's yes he's gonna pay down look I'm always
[23:51.640 --> 23:55.600]  anti-banker and bankers are horrible I hate bankers I hate the gulmas acts hate
[23:55.600 --> 23:59.920]  JPMorgan hate Jamie Diamond but if they if under the right leadership they can
[23:59.920 --> 24:06.680]  be turned into a legion of debt diminisher so another I was about to say so
[24:06.680 --> 24:09.440]  you agree with my view because I see what Trump's doing he's grabbing a lot of
[24:09.440 --> 24:13.080]  key players but not to sell out he has them now doing his will he's got the
[24:13.080 --> 24:16.440]  hit man he's got the worst so he's turning them into his ring rights that's
[24:16.440 --> 24:20.040]  what I think is gonna happen in other words if you go to a top anchor and you
[24:20.040 --> 24:23.800]  say look America got 20 trillion in debt you bring it down to 10 trillion and
[24:23.800 --> 24:26.960]  we'll give you a 1% fee that's a hundred billion dollar fee they'll do it no
[24:26.960 --> 24:31.840]  bankers gonna say no right it's like in the 1970s a New York City was bankrupt
[24:31.840 --> 24:35.560]  and they got Felix right and over there at Felix Lazard and he created the
[24:35.560 --> 24:38.800]  municipal assistant corporation bond the Mac bond and they saved New York so the
[24:38.800 --> 24:42.440]  banker was co-opted to do something positive for that city and it rebuilt
[24:42.440 --> 24:47.480]  that city and a Trump actually came in during that period and he bought developed
[24:47.480 --> 24:51.000]  the hotel near Grand Central Station that had become derelict etc and that
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.800]  was his era so now you say to these guys look we've got to pay down this debt I'm
[24:55.800 --> 24:59.760]  gonna give you unfettered access to any deal you want to make anywhere at any
[24:59.760 --> 25:05.040]  time in any country and we'll give you a big fee and as a result the soundness
[25:05.040 --> 25:09.680]  of the economy goes up and the ability to create high-paying jobs go go up this
[25:09.680 --> 25:13.680]  is something in Barack Obama when he took office it was a global financial
[25:13.680 --> 25:17.960]  crisis and he simply threw the ball over guys like Larry Summers and Tim
[25:17.960 --> 25:21.640]  just want to regular consolidate the economy only screwed us so let's write
[25:21.640 --> 25:25.720]  a real coprophagist they are the real coprophagists they're the ones that
[25:25.720 --> 25:29.800]  created the derivatives the scams all of it so what do you make of Obama saying
[25:29.800 --> 25:35.360]  eight months ago seven months from the election there's no magic wand to bring
[25:35.360 --> 25:40.280]  jobs back bull if the Chinese have a 15% corporate income tax lower than ours
[25:40.280 --> 25:45.120]  then jobs aren't gonna be here I mean he tells the Japanese I'm gonna equal it
[25:45.120 --> 25:48.480]  with China they go okay we're not gonna build in China we're gonna move 50
[25:48.480 --> 25:51.760]  billion here it's not rocket science I love how the Heritage Foundation all
[25:51.760 --> 25:55.800]  these fake right-wing libertarians who aren't libertarians they go we've got
[25:55.800 --> 26:00.120]  to stop Trump he's doing crony capitalism and then I don't know what's
[26:00.120 --> 26:02.760]  wrong with Sarah Palin I mean I guess she is done like people said I like her
[26:02.760 --> 26:08.880]  as a person she goes he's being a crony no if if if Mexico has dirty plants and
[26:08.880 --> 26:13.360]  then we can't even have plants that's not fair we have to equalize things out so
[26:13.360 --> 26:17.480]  how is it crony capitalism to say we're gonna lower our tax to the same rate as
[26:17.480 --> 26:22.400]  you to bring jobs back how is that unfair how is that not free trade that is
[26:22.400 --> 26:26.400]  free trade like Trump's gonna take any meeting that makes economic sense if the
[26:26.400 --> 26:31.200]  left in America organize themselves adequately and walked into the White
[26:31.200 --> 26:36.760]  House and explain to Donald Trump how building huge solar arrays in the desert
[26:36.760 --> 26:41.840]  in America would create jobs and lower the cost of energy he would be a
[26:41.840 --> 26:46.200]  convert to solar energy the caprio was there yesterday pushing that okay I was
[26:46.200 --> 26:50.520]  on a one by the way you give him a good deal he's gonna he's not beholden to
[26:50.520 --> 26:54.360]  anyone he's not gonna be like it'd be two-faced and say oh that sounds great
[26:54.360 --> 26:57.920]  but and then in the back room like I'm I'm totally he really does work for
[26:57.920 --> 27:00.480]  America he'll take a good deal but then what are you doing a good deal the
[27:00.480 --> 27:03.400]  lot listen you're a good deal you're an international guy you live all the world
[27:03.400 --> 27:06.320]  but I mean you big stockbroker lived in New York for a long time I know you know
[27:06.320 --> 27:11.560]  you know Alec Baldwin you know a lot of the Soros is all of them what do you know
[27:11.560 --> 27:15.040]  about Trump because everybody I know that's not even Baldwin is a friend of
[27:15.040 --> 27:19.080]  Trump's and I'm a friend of Stephen Baldwin's Stephen Baldwin is a friend of
[27:19.080 --> 27:25.320]  Trump does the Trump imitation I mean he hates him but but I was I was I was but
[27:25.320 --> 27:28.480]  I'm asking you what do you know from New York about Trump because people that
[27:28.480 --> 27:32.800]  have known him for 40 years say he's the real deal I think that he is
[27:32.800 --> 27:36.760]  recognized as your kind of typical New Yorker who likes to do deals he's a
[27:36.760 --> 27:41.760]  product of the 80s he's a product of a bull market he's since he's since he won
[27:41.760 --> 27:45.800]  the election the stock market said a trillion dollars in in value that's a
[27:45.800 --> 27:50.600]  trillion so that's the Trump effect that yeah exactly because so that's a
[27:50.600 --> 27:56.800]  trillion dollars that's a lot of money you know and so I think that it gives him
[27:56.800 --> 28:01.720]  a lot of leverage to go do deals and he can go to these countries around the
[28:01.720 --> 28:04.960]  world say open up shop in America let's get some high-paying jobs in America and
[28:04.960 --> 28:09.400]  with the quid pro quo could be greater access to this market or that market the
[28:09.400 --> 28:11.960]  country that seems to be completely tone-deaf to what's going on here it's
[28:11.960 --> 28:15.080]  Great Britain they're actually shutting themselves off from the global trade
[28:15.080 --> 28:18.440]  grid and that makes no sense to me whatsoever Trump is saying you know
[28:18.440 --> 28:23.360]  what America's been insular for too long kowtowing to a special interest let's
[28:23.360 --> 28:26.680]  open her up let's open this sucker up I'm very excited by the Trump presidency I
[28:26.680 --> 28:31.040]  think we're gonna see America a rebirth of America why do you think the elites
[28:31.040 --> 28:34.680]  were so scared of him because they can't control them they can't control me
[28:34.680 --> 28:39.280]  this own man and so that's quite scary and I would think of you as a classical
[28:39.280 --> 28:42.640]  liberal your anti-war but your laws a fair when it comes a lot of things pro
[28:42.640 --> 28:46.880]  lesbian you've made a lot of accurate predictions you've invented a lot of
[28:46.880 --> 28:51.000]  things like the virtual stock market system and your famous journalist and
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.640]  you know you absolutely hated George Bush I hated him too you're disappointed
[28:54.640 --> 28:59.280]  by Obama he put Enron in jail Jeff Skilling and Ronnie prosecuted the
[28:59.280 --> 29:03.320]  banksters George W. Bush well I've never seen you more enthusiastic about a
[29:03.320 --> 29:07.520]  political figure than Trump because it gets back to this is the greatest
[29:07.520 --> 29:11.520]  success of the of the of the Constitution and the founding fathers
[29:11.520 --> 29:16.040]  we've seen in quite some it is a populist rebellion because anyone ideally
[29:16.040 --> 29:20.360]  the Constitution is written in such a way that any one of modern intelligence
[29:20.360 --> 29:25.160]  or adequate intelligence who's who's you know fairly successful can walk in off
[29:25.160 --> 29:29.040]  the street and be president I say that's the way it's designed it's all checks
[29:29.040 --> 29:32.600]  and balances it's a people by the and the so-called permanent bureaucracy thought
[29:32.600 --> 29:35.320]  they'd taken over forever right that's wrong and they just got their big fat
[29:35.320 --> 29:39.640]  butts handed to stay there let's talk about the panic though the so-called
[29:39.640 --> 29:43.120]  liberals I mean it's cult like I thought right wingers were mad when I was
[29:43.120 --> 29:48.440]  against the Iraq war these people are flipping out we'll be right back we're
[29:48.440 --> 29:56.920]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:56.920 --> 30:02.600]  a staunch anti-Federalist Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution fearing
[30:02.600 --> 30:05.960]  it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states
[30:05.960 --> 30:09.560]  that had created it but that it would become a tool to destroy individual
[30:09.560 --> 30:13.880]  liberty his warnings ignored have now come to pass he said you're not to
[30:13.880 --> 30:18.160]  inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great and
[30:18.160 --> 30:22.560]  powerful people but how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be
[30:22.560 --> 30:26.400]  the direct end of your government Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a
[30:26.400 --> 30:30.240]  people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their
[30:30.240 --> 30:34.800]  rulers may be concealed from them today everything the government does at every
[30:34.800 --> 30:39.320]  level is concealed from us we have trade deals to manage our economy that not
[30:39.320 --> 30:42.880]  even our elected representatives are allowed to see later in life Patrick
[30:42.880 --> 30:46.240]  Henry look back and said when the American spirit was in its youth the
[30:46.240 --> 30:50.560]  language of America was different liberty sir was the primary object today
[30:50.560 --> 30:55.160]  our primary concern is safety and comfort when we should be demanding

[36:53.320 --> 36:57.320]  fantastic now let's get serious let's not I've been asking some of the
[36:57.320 --> 36:59.960]  questions and I want you to get into but what do you make of the Washington post
[36:59.960 --> 37:03.800]  you brought this up first yeah they had to retract today and they admitted their
[37:03.800 --> 37:07.360]  fake news list was fake and that there's no proof that Russians were behind
[37:07.360 --> 37:14.440]  info wars or that Breitbart or drudge and they even admitted no proof that RT
[37:14.440 --> 37:18.360]  was engaged in fake news because of lawsuit threats what do you make of the
[37:18.360 --> 37:22.320]  Washington Post retracting here it is right here well the mainstream media is
[37:22.320 --> 37:26.400]  collapsing because they've actually built their entire you know but just
[37:26.400 --> 37:30.160]  justify their existence on pushing fake stories for years and now you've got
[37:30.160 --> 37:33.600]  other you've got basic remember when that plane landed in the Hudson River and
[37:33.600 --> 37:37.080]  people were tweeting from the wing of the plane and what was really happening in
[37:37.080 --> 37:41.040]  real time and that was a huge death kneel for the mainstream media no no one
[37:41.040 --> 37:44.360]  got a news crew out there to cover it by the time the news showed up it was all
[37:44.360 --> 37:48.280]  over so it really is just technology technology is a huge factor in the
[37:48.280 --> 37:54.160]  disintermediation we were using laptops ten years ago to live stream the
[37:54.160 --> 37:57.720]  mainstream media started doing in a year ago we just shot a Kaiser report
[37:57.720 --> 38:01.840]  yesterday on our and our phone in the street you know 12 and a half minute
[38:01.840 --> 38:05.160]  interview we sent it off to the editor it'll be on the air tomorrow now how do
[38:05.160 --> 38:09.120]  you compete with that with a news team you're paying presenters and broadcasters
[38:09.120 --> 38:12.640]  and camera people you know you can't compete with it so they they're lashing
[38:12.640 --> 38:16.280]  out they're saying it's fake if it's not if you don't overspend on it is fake you
[38:16.280 --> 38:19.560]  know and use Trump's logic is like I'm not gonna overspend on Air Force one
[38:19.560 --> 38:22.880]  doesn't make it any more of an airplane airplane has to be functional guess by
[38:22.880 --> 38:27.240]  the way the word is he's kept it just a paint one of his planes up and say I'll
[38:27.240 --> 38:30.380]  pay for if it saves money why not he'll turn the inauguration into a money
[38:30.380 --> 38:34.120]  profit it'll be profitable he'll sell so many sponsorships to the inauguration
[38:34.120 --> 38:37.840]  word is a moneymaker the word is he's gonna turn down the half million he's
[38:37.840 --> 38:40.960]  gonna turn down the paycheck yeah I think you already said that he's
[38:40.960 --> 38:47.120]  thinking about it absolutely like what he's going to bring back fiscal you know
[38:47.120 --> 38:51.160]  prudence as it should be now as I was saying before the break that's another
[38:51.160 --> 38:54.600]  reason they're scared he is known as a tight tight one he's gonna cut them all
[38:54.600 --> 38:57.880]  off from their free money now I've you know was before the break I was saying
[38:57.880 --> 39:01.640]  America's designed by the founding fathers you got the checks and balances
[39:01.640 --> 39:05.480]  in the free press that any reasonable person can come off the farm for four
[39:05.480 --> 39:09.400]  years right years do their duty as a president I say so go back to work and
[39:09.400 --> 39:13.120]  anybody should be able to do this job it's not the job you don't need an
[39:13.120 --> 39:16.960]  omnipotent super genius to do this job just follow the instructions it's called
[39:16.960 --> 39:21.880]  a Constitution no special executive orders no diverging from in fact it is
[39:21.880 --> 39:25.880]  that special so-called elite that's cloistered themselves and tried to make
[39:25.880 --> 39:29.720]  Washington like the Forbidden City to make it quote so complex nobody else
[39:29.720 --> 39:33.320]  can run it right so let's get back to what this is all about the fact is you've
[39:33.320 --> 39:37.560]  got government buying for the people and this is what I Trump I think to look
[39:37.560 --> 39:41.240]  back and what to pair him to maybe a Teddy Roosevelt who came in it was a
[39:41.240 --> 39:45.720]  trust buster he was considered a betrayed his class he came from a rich
[39:45.720 --> 39:51.400]  family but he broke up the the oil the barons a true Maverick yeah he was a
[39:51.400 --> 39:54.600]  progressive he was the original progressive was Teddy Roosevelt I was
[39:54.600 --> 39:57.560]  actually now considered to be a progressive and he broke up you know
[39:57.560 --> 40:01.120]  the the robber barons as they were he was a real progressive breaking him up I
[40:01.120 --> 40:04.720]  love how the modern left and I thought this earlier please please give me a
[40:04.720 --> 40:09.360]  view I've had people at restaurants come up and go I don't like you and show me a
[40:09.360 --> 40:13.680]  gun because of Trump I was at the gym today and there'd be women 20 feet away
[40:13.680 --> 40:17.280]  and they'd look at me now I'm all over the news and they would actually stumble
[40:17.280 --> 40:21.880]  away like they were scared because they're just demonizing so it's a
[40:21.880 --> 40:25.600]  minority of people that still believe it but man the one I don't know what are
[40:25.600 --> 40:29.040]  you saying believe the mainstream media but I people drive by and go f you Alex
[40:29.040 --> 40:33.880]  Jones now I mean the so-called liberals are whacked out of their brains and are
[40:33.880 --> 40:38.680]  so mad that I supported Trump but you've become the new Walter Cronkite and this
[40:38.680 --> 40:42.680]  is a new Vietnam War you know they you you're now the mainstream media you're
[40:42.680 --> 40:48.000]  now being seen as the face of what they perceive to be a problem so this is the
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.320]  risk of being successful is that you've become the thing that you were
[40:53.320 --> 40:56.760]  protesting against I never wanted to be a celebrity but I'll just announce it
[40:56.760 --> 40:59.920]  it's horrible well I mean I'm happy to do it for the country but let me tell you
[40:59.920 --> 41:03.240]  you go somewhere and everybody's looking at you and maybe eight of them like you
[41:03.240 --> 41:06.920]  but two of them want to kill you it's not fun well you get recognized over to
[41:06.920 --> 41:13.120]  how do you deal with I I hide behind Stacy basically Stacy you know she has
[41:13.120 --> 41:17.760]  enough training and martial arts to protect you do wear a hat she carries
[41:17.760 --> 41:21.280]  a small I'm gonna start doing like I'm gonna start doing like drudge does I'm
[41:21.280 --> 41:25.280]  just I'm really gonna buy a big hat and start wearing sunglasses I've been fed
[41:25.280 --> 41:29.920]  up man but but this is what we were talking about last year Alex Jones is
[41:29.920 --> 41:33.920]  that you know this is all gonna work out as as you said it would but then you
[41:33.920 --> 41:38.680]  would be the face of this so this is basically now your new reality you know
[41:38.680 --> 41:44.080]  this is the new reality about shown so but this is the responsibility you've
[41:44.080 --> 41:48.280]  got four years at least now of this Trump presidency to carry the ball you
[41:48.280 --> 41:53.040]  know to make sure people are not being bamboozled by the the imposters and the
[41:53.040 --> 41:56.720]  bamboozlers you know that's you the tip of the spear well the spear just went
[41:56.720 --> 42:00.800]  into the rhinoceros of mainstream media that's now dying and you're pulling the
[42:00.800 --> 42:04.680]  spear out and they're like yeah I did it but that's right you did do it but we
[42:04.680 --> 42:07.680]  did the listeners did it you did it everybody did it but we are now I'll
[42:07.680 --> 42:11.280]  just say we've been singled out for the few people it's like Trump banning me
[42:11.280 --> 42:15.800]  drudge but they can't really get to him I said I'm not bitching I'm just like I
[42:15.800 --> 42:19.640]  don't get it if Hillary would have won I'd have been okay get ready for even
[42:19.640 --> 42:24.000]  higher ratings you know we did the right thing or you know we're gonna oppose her
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.160]  now and try to get her impeached and and you know try to but but quite frankly
[42:28.160 --> 42:32.200]  would just be a new fight I wouldn't be mad at Democrats like cussing at him no
[42:32.200 --> 42:35.560]  but you're the now you're the top dog you're the top dog people are gonna you're
[42:35.560 --> 42:38.400]  the guy to knock off okay that that's what happens when you become number
[42:38.400 --> 42:43.120]  well NPR on the hour is lying about well you're the guy to knock off but I mean I
[42:43.120 --> 42:46.960]  think you should you know take a moment but don't they get there so discredited
[42:46.960 --> 42:50.040]  that when they try to knock us off just like they did Trump it empowers us no
[42:50.040 --> 42:54.400]  because you have to understand it's all very you talk about social Darwinism I
[42:54.400 --> 42:57.640]  mean this is gonna be a classic example of social Darwinism because now you've
[42:57.640 --> 43:01.520]  got the they don't get the world's moved on as as Spiro Agnew referred to them
[43:01.520 --> 43:06.160]  the nuttering Nabobs of negativism are now going to be focusing on the top dog
[43:06.160 --> 43:11.920]  Alex Jones and you're gonna be the target of a ferocious attacks going
[43:11.920 --> 43:16.440]  forward but that's the price of being having put Trump in the White House
[43:16.440 --> 43:20.400]  essentially I just don't get well I'm certainly part of the audience was the
[43:20.400 --> 43:23.440]  audience did it I mean Trump told me that personally but they've got the
[43:23.440 --> 43:30.160]  numbers I don't wake go Texas you know you the injustice of Waco spawned Alex
[43:30.160 --> 43:36.000]  Jones and for 25 years even pointing this out and then finally the mainstream
[43:36.000 --> 43:41.280]  media became so tone-deaf and so out of touch that the voters said you know what
[43:41.280 --> 43:46.080]  let's just kick the bums out maybe Alex Jones is right now they've got something
[43:46.080 --> 43:49.360]  about me but it is surreal because we're all part of it but it is it is really
[43:49.360 --> 43:55.200]  one of the main main focal points take the Pope you know he first got in even
[43:55.200 --> 43:57.920]  though it was a lot of controversy I thought oh he's gonna help the poor oh
[43:57.920 --> 44:01.200]  he's done such I don't want to dislike this guy but he's now joined in saying
[44:01.200 --> 44:04.720]  get rid of fake news he's now joined in doing all the stuff and now he says
[44:04.720 --> 44:10.140]  Pope pontificates on fake news calls it a sin and lies into sexual arousal from
[44:10.140 --> 44:15.120]  extra men I learned a new word the propogist it's a court the prophecy
[44:15.120 --> 44:22.280]  coprophilia right the prophecy okay so movie with divine called flamingos by
[44:22.280 --> 44:26.560]  John Waters I know I did not okay it's a famous underground movie where this
[44:26.560 --> 44:33.000]  enormous woman slash man she's she's on the sidewalk and she's she's actually
[44:33.000 --> 44:38.360]  eating a dog feces okay and this is a famous underground documentary film
[44:38.360 --> 44:44.440]  about Hillary is a film is a film called flamingos starring divine who is a
[44:44.440 --> 44:52.520]  huge trend transsexual or transgender star at that time so this is where so
[44:52.520 --> 44:57.280]  the prophecy by the being mentioned by the Pope it's very interesting isn't
[44:57.280 --> 45:00.720]  that kind of blasphemous it's like coming out of his mouth even I'm learning
[45:00.720 --> 45:05.720]  about this stuff now and then and then meanwhile there's pink flamingos I'm
[45:05.720 --> 45:08.720]  sorry pink flamingos John water let's scroll down it shows some of the shots
[45:08.720 --> 45:12.280]  from the movie and and if you go to YouTube there's you'll find the video
[45:12.280 --> 45:16.400]  from the clip from that film simulated turd gobbling where she's actually a
[45:16.400 --> 45:20.200]  gobbling turd on the street but the reason I raise actually apparently she
[45:20.200 --> 45:26.320]  actually you know a dog poop but hold on I'm as why the pope that's where the
[45:26.320 --> 45:31.280]  pope is going I know the pope brain is divine of Catholic of Catholicism is
[45:31.280 --> 45:35.240]  it's a new pope is actually the divine of Catholicism over there in the Vatican
[45:35.240 --> 45:39.520]  is the new John Waters film called pink flamingos and the pope that should be
[45:39.520 --> 45:43.400]  the sequel by John Waters get John Waters on the phone he lives in Baltimore
[45:43.400 --> 45:46.440]  Maryland I believe have him do the sequel to pink flamingos right now with
[45:46.440 --> 45:49.960]  the pope starring in it the pope could be the pope and drag the pope and he's
[45:49.960 --> 45:53.480]  always are wearing the cape and the pointed hat and he's got he's already
[45:53.480 --> 45:57.360]  got the panties on he comes with his own his own wardrobe it's just that's when
[45:57.360 --> 46:01.160]  I'm thinking but that's what I'm saying he's here's the deal I know the media
[46:01.160 --> 46:05.320]  tomorrow NPR all of them will say I said the pope eats poop and I'm gonna be
[46:05.320 --> 46:09.560]  gross here he took us there the point is them they'll never say he said it see
[46:09.560 --> 46:14.000]  you know that's why they're fake news I watch watch tomorrow they're gonna say
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.160]  I blast themed all Catholics which I love Catholics that's not true I'm telling
[46:18.160 --> 46:22.240]  you he's the one saying we eat poop but we're not allowed to say about him there's
[46:22.240 --> 46:26.800]  only one Alex Jones Alex Jones you can't you can't be frightful or fearful
[46:26.800 --> 46:29.160]  that you're gonna wake up in the morning and there's gonna be another Alex
[46:29.160 --> 46:32.680]  Jones you see the face here yeah you see the face here you this is the pope
[46:32.680 --> 46:35.880]  figuring out somebody else ate his poop well he wanted it for himself what's
[46:35.880 --> 46:39.680]  what's remarkable about this statement from the pope is that isn't it the
[46:39.680 --> 46:44.040]  previous pope who's actually been involved in a sexual scandal that's why
[46:44.040 --> 46:48.200]  he left the that's how he got in was it was reportedly the previous everything
[46:48.200 --> 46:52.000]  out of the Sun from he resigned the previous pope memory just he resigned and
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.120]  no one could really explain exactly why except there were rumors that he was up
[46:56.120 --> 47:01.800]  and this was after just a few years ago that he had the Murphy report in Ireland
[47:01.800 --> 47:05.920]  where Ireland actually closed their embassy in the Vatican due to the
[47:05.920 --> 47:11.120]  Catholic priest pedophile scandal and you had this enormous wave of Catholic
[47:11.120 --> 47:16.240]  priests involved in pedophilia and it was challenging the the the the Vatican
[47:16.240 --> 47:20.480]  and the pope and they were in trouble they were in genuine trouble and the
[47:20.480 --> 47:26.640]  pope at that time a German fellow rat rat zinger rat you know he was allegedly
[47:26.640 --> 47:31.640]  involved in some sexual sexualated scandals he stepped down and they
[47:31.640 --> 47:34.840]  bring in this new pope who you got a hand to the Catholic church they know how
[47:34.840 --> 47:38.480]  to survive because this new guy was a populist he was he sounded knees
[47:38.480 --> 47:43.080]  kissing poor people's feet and he's bringing a common to water so he thought
[47:43.080 --> 47:47.640]  maybe they pooped now now we're learning something new from this pope I was on
[47:47.640 --> 47:52.440]  unaware that he was so conversant in Capropagy and Pinklefinger listen I
[47:52.440 --> 47:55.600]  work at all hands you you know what this man I didn't even know what that was I
[47:55.600 --> 48:00.600]  use it on my show once because I all I like to get a lot of words and on my
[48:00.600 --> 48:06.600]  show every show in France you know I was able to get a lot of words and I was
[48:06.600 --> 48:12.120]  the first person probably to get the word bukkake mentioned on an international
[48:12.120 --> 48:16.840]  TV that's right because the French have okay national a speech police they don't
[48:16.840 --> 48:19.920]  claim it censorship they claim is defense of the first language what's it
[48:19.920 --> 48:22.840]  called the defense of the French language thing the Academy de France say
[48:22.840 --> 48:26.440]  yeah yeah that's it I said that basically Ben Bernanke was engaging in
[48:26.440 --> 48:31.920]  monetary bukkake where he was essentially you know ejaculating you
[48:31.920 --> 48:37.360]  know trillions of dollars worth of you know financial semen etc and that got
[48:37.360 --> 48:40.840]  through because let me ask you this what world are we in where the pope is
[48:40.840 --> 48:46.360]  admonishing us as poop eaters we're in a post Catholic you know the Catholic
[48:46.360 --> 48:51.760]  Church already collapsed once you know a few centuries ago due to the advent of
[48:51.760 --> 48:56.040]  the printing press now the new Catholic Church is it's collapsing again due to
[48:56.040 --> 48:59.160]  the advent of alt media so they've already that this is the movie we've seen
[48:59.160 --> 49:03.160]  this movie a movie before so you had of course the cat the reformers in the
[49:03.160 --> 49:09.560]  Catholic Church you know who who famously or you know posted on the the wall
[49:09.560 --> 49:13.360]  the Vatican on the door Martin Luther you know he had that moment in
[49:13.360 --> 49:17.120]  Catholicism where it was totally reformed and now this is you're you know
[49:17.120 --> 49:21.280]  we're the new Martin Luther and this is the new outdated Pope the Catholic
[49:21.280 --> 49:27.360]  Church is is trying desperately to yeah they're gonna reform by becoming
[49:27.360 --> 49:30.880]  like communist but he's in this rich armored compound saying open the borders
[49:30.880 --> 49:33.800]  of Europe but they're not bringing migrants into Catholic Church was
[49:33.800 --> 49:37.840]  challenged by Gutenberg's printing press and knowledge was it was it was passed
[49:37.840 --> 49:41.720]  the Internet of that day they didn't have the exclusive exclusivity on
[49:41.720 --> 49:44.960]  knowledge on knowledge now think about the church these days when the emergence
[49:44.960 --> 49:49.920]  of virtual reality how are they gonna push their agenda as Catholics into a
[49:49.920 --> 49:53.720]  world where people are you know this technological revolution is taking on a
[49:53.720 --> 49:56.920]  whole new dimension and they're they're just can't keep up so they're they're
[49:56.920 --> 50:00.200]  lashing out as well but that's they've already collapsed once they're gonna
[50:00.200 --> 50:04.800]  collapse again all you know the mainstream media is collapsing the banking
[50:04.800 --> 50:09.160]  system is being refinanced that's my question we come back to Trump where is
[50:09.160 --> 50:13.880]  the economy because a mixed motion emotions about this last my question is
[50:13.880 --> 50:17.880]  you really are smart on economics we come back from break the world was
[50:17.880 --> 50:20.360]  already treated on the edge of collapse all the signs were there was admitted
[50:20.360 --> 50:23.960]  you know German banks about to go under and then now here comes Trump and
[50:23.960 --> 50:27.840]  suddenly all of the world stuff's upticking and just the optimism of
[50:27.840 --> 50:31.640]  not having a bunch of Goldman Sachs banks wanting us to implode so they can
[50:31.640 --> 50:36.040]  consolidate control what happens with mr. prosperity shows that how do those two
[50:36.040 --> 50:40.840]  like hot air and cold air when they hit are they're gonna be tornadoes yeah I
[50:40.840 --> 50:46.600]  think yeah exactly I think we're gonna see so here we're gonna hail storms I

[57:12.920 --> 57:16.520]  by some people and I checked it was like there's like yes Putin wants to come on
[57:16.520 --> 57:19.680]  but he wants to talk about hunting because you're from Texas and I was just
[57:19.680 --> 57:22.840]  like I noticed you like to go bare-chested now I mean I think Putin
[57:22.840 --> 57:25.960]  started I did that as a joke that whole bare-chesting thing I did it to troll
[57:25.960 --> 57:29.920]  the media liberal is crazy because Putin dares to be a heterosexual so
[57:29.920 --> 57:33.720]  they're actually go out of show on a horse in some way out shows on horse you
[57:33.720 --> 57:37.240]  know Putin's heterosexual and so therefore I'm not bragging but aren't
[57:37.240 --> 57:41.680]  those some big pecs and people are saying awesome pecs you know those are

[57:56.320 --> 57:59.880]  classified as you know I shouldn't have been laughing because I was laughing I
[57:59.880 --> 58:02.800]  didn't know I did it to troll him and then the media was like in a whole bunch
[58:02.800 --> 58:06.360]  of newspapers they go he's a role model he's bringing peace around the world
[58:06.360 --> 58:11.360]  he's a statesman you know and and so I am a Russian agent and and and Trump
[58:11.360 --> 58:14.000]  figures that you know what the the greatest way I scrolled out of the one
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.760]  for me and one of the apes there's one we did plenty of the apes to the way to
[58:17.760 --> 58:23.320]  save a trillion dollars is to cut a deal with Putin to fight terrorism as a
[58:23.320 --> 58:27.000]  joint task force save a trillion dollars bring back more jobs thanks for
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.040]  dropping the Putin thing on me but can we please get into the economy yeah I
[58:31.040 --> 58:35.640]  thought we're out of time no we're going there's more over time he goes on and

[58:50.400 --> 58:55.560]  force life comm bio true selenium we've had so many requests over the years for
[58:55.560 --> 59:00.960]  selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bio
[59:00.960 --> 59:05.640]  available selenium from mustard seed extract when you take selenium in the
[59:05.640 --> 59:09.480]  body it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body it
[59:09.480 --> 59:14.600]  helps balance the thyroid gland it helps detoxify selenium is another one of
[59:14.600 --> 59:18.880]  those absolute must-have the highest concentration of selenium is in the
[59:18.880 --> 59:22.000]  thyroid gland but it's actually used all over the body as a matter of fact
[59:22.000 --> 59:27.800]  there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium so it
[59:27.800 --> 59:33.480]  really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs I'm taking it
[59:33.480 --> 59:38.960]  now every day this is so key bio true selenium is the product the best selenium
[59:38.960 --> 59:41.680]  that we could bring you we believe it's the best out there at a very very low
[59:41.680 --> 59:45.520]  price exclusively available in infowarslife.com or by calling toll free
[59:45.520 --> 59:49.720]  triple eight two five three three one three nine
[59:50.040 --> 59:55.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:55.480 --> 01:00:08.960]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.840]  now I've got hundreds of news articles I haven't even gotten to yet so I'm not
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:28.840]  going back to this for lack of material you know why this show so popular we
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.760]  cover a lot of great information but when we fall on our face we fall on our
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.360]  face as well because it's teleprompter free and I don't even know who Adam
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.880]  Corolla is but I have that name in my head and I know from childhood watching
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.560]  him right through high school and college who Adam Curry is and I've even
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.920]  listened to some of his radio shows off and on he's got like his own network and
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:54.360]  on show I was calling him Adam Corolla who is Adam Corolla what does he do it's
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.600]  Adam Curry but that's the great part there's no central programmers above me
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:03.320]  and that's the joke that Tucker Carlson was just making earlier that is there
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.680]  some you know centralized Putin calling him to give him orders because he had a
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:14.560]  congressman on a Democratic congressman on saying to his face you're a Russian
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:20.160]  agent and then they have no evidence that Russia is controlling the alt-right
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.000]  as Hillary defines us and even the Washington Post had to retract that
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.240]  yesterday because it's outrageous libel it's outrageous slander it's outrageous
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:36.400]  defamation so James and Stephen and Brian and David and Hector Hector's been
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.800]  holding the longest so I'll go to James and others Stephen Hawaii we're gonna go
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.400]  to you pretty early on to bring in wildcard points and stuff with our guest
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:52.960]  Adam Curry and of course Max Kaiser now I'll just call him Max Flamingo why not
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.200]  just get the name completely wrong after we were obsessing on the fact that the
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:02.120]  pubs co-star on the new Pink Flamingos movie we discussed that that satire
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:06.480]  folks as the Pope made horribly disgusting statements yesterday that I
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.440]  won't even repeat on air and that dignify about the type of stuff that goes
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.600]  through his his mind I won't sit here and talk about how he talked about how
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:20.360]  people enjoy eating feces and having sexual pleasure from it as I just did
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:27.200]  that's a Greek form of arguing there that we just engaged in we're gonna go to
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.160]  your phone calls after the break since I mentioned it here is Mr. Fake news Brian
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:35.280]  Williams and it's so surreal that Hillary to play the clip last hour saying we
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.720]  need Congress to pass the law to shut down the fake news we'll decide what it
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.920]  is it's very dangerous this is the biggest liar of our lifetimes who said
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:50.000]  she was in combat attacked well like Brian Williams running around lying to us
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.720]  but here's Williams with this other weasel and then they go out to real fake
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.600]  news sites and then come and interview them and then the fake news sites come
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.880]  on and go yes I'm fake and so's Alex Jones they even have the fake news sites
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.240]  out going we work with Alex Jones we like him he's fake like us this is the
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.200]  games they play trying to deceive people because they are the fake news industry

[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:26.560]  know up there on the edge of edge of hell and you had the demons and then
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:32.800]  the devil was the king and then his his bride was the queen you would have
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:36.280]  Brian Williams the king and Hillary the queen they should get married and
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:41.920]  together make little deceitful creatures together so here ladies and
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:51.520]  gentlemen is the king of fake news don don don Brian Williams and lately there's
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:56.080]  been a lot of coverage in the real news about the growing and booming business
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:01.320]  of creating fake news our own Jacob Soboroff just spoke exclusively to the
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.960]  creator of one of the most widely shared fake news stories and the lead-up to

[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.400]  Brian Williams and he's he's this stolen valor guy I expect to see him in a
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.520]  Walmart parking lot wearing congressional Medal of Honor and getting
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.160]  donations or something you know he has like a one leg blown off but it's fake

[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.600]  spokesman against fake news is Brian Williams is this all an alternate
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:59.400]  reality a dark satire written by Kurt Vonnegut from heaven despite all the
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.040]  status rhetoric that gun control works here's five reasons why it won't number
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.640]  one California has many of the most restrictive gun laws in the country yet
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.520]  those laws did absolutely nothing to stop the San Bernardino shooting number
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.560]  two Paris France also has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the world
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:18.000]  but those laws also did nothing to stop November 13th ISIS attacks number three
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.760]  it's estimated that someone in Chicago is shot every 2.8 hours despite the city's
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.280]  strict gun laws number four Mexico also has restrictive gun laws just like
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:31.400]  Chicago yet over 160,000 people have been murdered in the country's drug war
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.440]  since 2007 the only people who are actually stopping the Mexican cartels
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.120]  are private citizens who are openly defined Mexico's gun laws to form
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:43.200]  self-defense malicious number five president Obama has been arming and
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.080]  funding ISIS link Syrian rebels for quite some time in fact Obama approved
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:51.280]  the rearming of these so-called moderate rebels on October 1st the same day he
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.520]  called for gun control in response to the community college shooting up in

[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.120]  what's so great about it they call that fake news but then I can pull up the
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.840]  Chinese show you know national TV where they're growing humanoids inside cows
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:03.400]  and have cows that have you know that produce human milk but this is now
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.240]  coming out of mainstream you've been saying this for years so yeah it was
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.600]  in it was in like scientific stuff scientific American 20 years ago
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:15.440]  that's what's crazy I cover stuff it's like totally admitted and then it's like
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.800]  it's like a 1950 going he claims there's something called automobiles it's like
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.040]  yeah they've been around 50 years man you know it's not like I'm saying

[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:07.160]  teleprompter free seriously are there any teleprompters here because they now
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:10.200]  accuse me of claiming there's teleprompters in here I don't see any
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:14.120]  teleprompter yeah there are a call list over there yeah that's the call list

[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.600]  so we can take calls to go maybe 20 minutes to the next hour fantastic all
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.600]  right and then I'll and then I'm gonna hand the baton to Leanne McAdoo to take
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:29.240]  over for the rest of that and also play a clip from our great reporter who's
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.480]  out there exposing a lot of stuff that's happening on the road the Trump
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:35.760]  events now instead of me talking and first asking my questions what is front
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:40.520]  and sit him front and center on your radar screen fake news fake news is
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:44.760]  number one which as you know the no agenda show is the podcast that I do
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.360]  we've been tracking this for a long time and we feel that this is now the
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:53.040]  opportune moment especially in connection with pizza gate which is being used as
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.440]  you know oh it's dangerous so licensing is on its way licensing of
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.360]  journalists licensing of all kinds of things that's what I that's what we
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.800]  really believe is gonna happen and then you're the accepted group because you
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.720]  toe the line yeah oh yeah that's how China does it they license journalists
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:11.400]  and even when they get out of line they arrest you for fake news max and I were
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:15.280]  talking the other day neither of us are verified on Twitter and I think that's
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.360]  where it's really going to start he has 25 million viewers a week
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:21.760]  conservatively one of the biggest networks in the world not verified the
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.640]  invented virtual trading on the stock market yeah bodies with George Soros
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:31.200]  Bitcoin Meister doesn't get any credit about the real the real the real guys
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.040]  here that's right on verify but it gives me plausible deniability because this way
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:38.320]  I can say it's not really me tweeting tilt the mic towards your face but I
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.800]  think that that is the first step is this verification thing you know because
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.640]  you look at this journalists who have 500 followers and they work some station
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.920]  somewhere and they get verified I think I'm the real Adam Curry I'm pretty sure
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.440]  I am but I now I don't want it because that will be in the market well back in
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.400]  the day I was dumb never really got on Twitter early but then I had to really
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.040]  have people call him and get mad even have a lawyer write a letter they go
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:03.160]  okay fine give us a copier passport your driver's license and some type of bill
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.760]  and we'll see and then they finally did yeah so but now I'm told people that
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:11.480]  are even more famous than I am or you and they just won't even respond to you
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.880]  when you want to get verified yeah but I don't want it now I'm not interested
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:19.960]  continue that's a big big truth bomb I hadn't thought of that right that they
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.680]  are gonna push licensing well of course they are I mean this is how in Europe
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:28.760]  the European Parliament just passed a resolution and this is all about fake
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.680]  news and the whole idea is to fund a journalist a journalist with education
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.640]  fund NGO NGOs to really work and to create lists to block off our sites it's
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:41.880]  already happening to us of course it is by the way let's say it that's what Matt
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.760]  drudge came here you're going said that's what he always hypes on he said stop
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:49.260]  being on Facebook and Twitter they're gonna end up censoring you build your
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:54.720]  own platform everybody go to websites again have lots of independent things
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.080]  like lots of little independent shops and restaurants it's the same thing not
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:04.480]  big box stores you know go to no agenda show dot com go to curry dot com I built
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.640]  a platform called start join it's good crowdfunding platform with its own
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:13.360]  cryptocurrency called start coin so to your point Alex and building a platform
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.600]  with its own currency to fight the new world order that's what I'm doing that's
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:24.080]  how I'm contributing to this revolution good I mean what more can I say about it
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.720]  now there is the drudge says their internet ghettos and that was over a
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:30.080]  year ago in the studio it really is internet ghettos now that's related with
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.360]  the Jews first they first said okay you can't advertise you can't have your
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:37.280]  businesses in this area then now you got to be in this ghetto now watch this poor
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:40.720]  dirty people let's work take them and send them to a work camp but it's
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.880]  undeniable they kill you it's undeniable now we see the president of
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.480]  president-elect Trump we see what happened with Brexit we see what's
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.400]  happening with Italy I think these types of platforms alternative to the
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.720]  mainstream is more important than ever right now and people are definitely
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.520]  finding it and Facebook is kind of becoming a graveyard in a way I mean I
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.920]  have to have an account just to see what's going on but I really is none of
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:08.600]  this well I famously said I use it like a toilet I mean I don't expect it to
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.680]  always be there and it's just kind of like a hole in the ground out back you
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:16.240]  at the farmhouse but we put our info out there but we don't expect it to be
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:20.480]  there tomorrow it may very well not be I mean online communities always end up
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:24.680]  broken they always I mean we've seen a geocities AOL eventually it'll go away
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:28.720]  they've captured a critical mass and that's something like two billion monthly
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:34.880]  users and it's going to they're rolling out aircraft to hover over places without
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:39.200]  internet connectivity to create more users so clearly this is an incredible
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.960]  force to be reckoned with and as we're leading up to the election you know the
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.880]  Mark Zuckerberg the CEO and his connections in Washington were helping to
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.560]  filter news oh he was already censoring massively and then after Hillary
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:55.640]  lost the media said the the dinosaur media it's your fault you didn't censor
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:59.320]  more and so now he's doing it mm-hmm right well this is this is the epic
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.600]  battle that's taking place is mainstream media who just like the record
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:07.360]  business for years denied denied denied and you know if you saw 2000 records
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:11.120]  your top 10 on billboard just that's how bad it is well it's really it's that
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:19.160]  bad to wow I could put up an album and sell a hundred dollars I would I would
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:23.840]  definitely buy that the little bells the lonely soldier mama stole my Christmas
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:30.120]  tree all the classics I want to do it let's do it why am I got run over my
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.960]  reindeer that's it that's it that's that's that's I'm in a rupping this
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.000]  guy's saying smart stuff of course he is I forgot what I was talking about Adam
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  Curry you were saying the music industry didn't listen they were arrogant they
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.200]  didn't get it so now news and news the they fought they fought they fought
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.960]  Google was complicit and by killing Google Reader which RSS which is still a
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.920]  great distribution mechanism gives you in fact a feed very much like a Twitter
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:58.680]  or Facebook feed when Google Reader was purposely destroyed the whole idea of
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:02.960]  aren't RSS kind of fell apart but it's slowly coming back now and you see the
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.560]  epic battle between the mainstream against Silicon Valley all day now I
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:11.480]  hear on on mainstream is well you know these guys are dangerous now and so
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.800]  this is going to be an interesting budding of heads to see what happens
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.600]  there I tell you what's exciting I actually have a fellow showing up about
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:23.360]  215 today when we go off air and and and the ladies take over who is the owner
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:28.400]  of one of the larger second tier about to become first-tier cord cutting
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.320]  companies and he gets what's happening it's all about content content content
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.040]  like Redstone said back in the 30s when he went from just it being about the
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:41.640]  theaters to the actual content before it was just the theater movies were like
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.640]  some secondary deal you just went to the big fancy theater and drinks or
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.200]  whatever and so I see there's all sorts of other things they're gonna bite the
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.600]  mainstream dinosaur media in the but we're the least of their problems it's
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:56.720]  gonna be all these other distribution platforms yes and not only that but
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:01.280]  different business models you have a phenomenally interesting and I think
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:06.320]  obviously successful business model with your entire info worth life and all
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.560]  your all the problem I mean that's how I got turned on you I got Berkey water
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:16.040]  filter got my one acre crisis seed garden thank you meals ready to eat super
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:20.720]  female vitality no when I take yeah by the way it actually works better for men
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:24.920]  for whatever reason but men don't want to buy that formula potty squatty is a
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.360]  innovative product that changes people's lives you know you know everyone needs a
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:33.040]  max let's be serious garden and we sell really cool products starting again
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.400]  with a marijuana verse we sell really good products and fund ourselves yeah
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.040]  that's an original idea and more and more people are gonna adopt that where
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.560]  you sell direct products to your audience and don't have some corporate
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:47.120]  sponsor and we get a drone delivery service you know get the drones on the
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:50.920]  roof so people as you were continuing so where do you see this Adam Curry where
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:56.400]  do you see this going well so obviously we have our own distribution it may get
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.440]  a little complicated you know they may start to shut things down but I think
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.400]  it is look at how WikiLeaks everyone got around it you know that's kind of
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.440]  unstoppable the internet in that regard I think is so pretty sure that's where
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.840]  they're starting is just stealth banning oh sorry you can't share info or links as
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:13.680]  of yesterday on Facebook on Reddit Facebook it's selective only some of our
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:18.160]  links it's on Reddit it's just yeah you can't right so but you have a million
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:24.000]  votes it won't go up that's right but that's why advertising online I don't
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.760]  see a future in that and the mainstream hasn't even NPR other like PBS public
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:33.160]  media have no idea how to actually work with the public to create programming
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:37.600]  and that include like our show we're all a listener funded so we have financial
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.480]  support we have people we call our audience producers you know get us
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.640]  clips get us exactly and the audience which is a big part of info wars yes
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:49.560]  they exactly it's like a symbiotic thing yes thinking of that we're gonna come
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:53.480]  back and take phone calls they continue on with Adam Curry and Max Kaiser both

[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:26.160]  redstone brainwasher children medium Max Kaiser's here I want to start taking
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.160]  calls now instead of later because we've got time into the next hour with these
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:32.160]  guys but I want to what are some of the other areas you guys want to get into
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:37.840]  after we take calls go max well first of all you mentioned Axl Rose before I
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:44.800]  just want to mention you know of the the group the what would what group was that
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:50.280]  guns and roses Stacey Herbert has an excellent Axl Rose impression just want
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:54.640]  to put that out you're always being ironic on my show and not yours can we
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:25:01.640]  have the serious max it's I think it's it obviously the topic du jour is the
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.720]  this idea fake news as Adam mentioned it it's total censorship and how they're
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:10.040]  dressing up their most draconian book burning attack on free speech the
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:15.560]  world's ever seen it just the bravada of it yeah I mean so but dairy under
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.640]  McCarthyism there there was something called the communists and you had the
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.240]  you know the committee to save America from the communist now it's the evil
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.320]  patriots that want to make America great again we got to shut them up because
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.520]  they're Russian agents who the hell believes that but fake news is is
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:35.220]  oxymoronic and that news is by definition extemporaneous and open to
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:38.080]  revision that said they say it's the first draft of history so a lot of what's
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.880]  reported as news later it's like well you know at the in the heat of the battle
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:46.120]  we we looked at it after six months and we revised what was then considered news
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:50.280]  and this is more of the historical document so to say that's fake news is
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:54.720]  again it's an oxymoron all news to some degree would have a some degree of
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.880]  subjectivity to it would have some degree of but these are the people saying
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:02.600]  kill Donald Trump is not pure it's not a pure it comes out all propaganda whole
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:07.360]  cloth and pure news has in many in many times has errors in it you try to do the
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:10.440]  best that you can but to say it's fake news it's the same we don't want any
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:14.840]  news we don't want their introduction idea that we want propaganda we want
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:19.200]  only propaganda it comes from one source and if you don't report what we say it's
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:23.400]  like Britain where we do most of our shows is become a totalitarian propaganda
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:27.960]  state where the state is now dictating everything that comes out in any major
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:32.360]  news source we're constantly harassed as I was 20 saying yes if I off-com the
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:38.000]  regulator who gets actually on into our face and says and gives us scripts the
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.720]  UK regulator gives us scripts to read on our show and then they accuse us of
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:47.680]  propaganda the regulator gives us scripts that are detailing our position on
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:52.800]  energy companies in the UK that state-sponsored propaganda that's right
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:56.700]  after a pull pot and all of this grew out of the notices all this grew out of
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:00.080]  national security oh you can't talk about where nuclear weapons are stored
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:03.920]  next it's you can't say you're for Brexit or you can't say you're against it you
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.200]  just have to have no view you can't you can't break it for six months you can't
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:10.800]  say anything negative about the migrant situation they can't say illegal mention
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:16.320]  Brexit for six months they threaten to take RT off the air in the UK and that
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.520]  and that's what the regulator said okay and that's that's the kind of
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:23.360]  restrictions we deal with there's no free speech in the UK the UK is pretty high
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:26.760]  up on the global free speech and by the way they want a law passed here the same
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:30.600]  as England that quote if something's foreign media while they invited in then
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:34.800]  you're an American on that international platform everything's global then you
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.760]  can't ever make comments about anything domestic well how are you supposed to do
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:42.800]  the news then I'm sure you covered the repeal of the Smith month act yes your
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.160]  show and people need to hear that I think that in the I think was the mid
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.920]  70s there was a bill an act a law that said the US government may not
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:54.880]  propagandize its citizens they repealed it three years ago in the National
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.760]  Defense Authorization Act and the reasoning behind it was well we do so
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:02.480]  much propaganda on the internet that it's going to eventually flow into the
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:05.880]  US so so just so we don't get in trouble you might as well just take it off the
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.480]  table and this is only a couple years they said we're gonna put out fake news
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.600]  they said even deceptive stories we do put out the voice of America they do
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.400]  put out fake so they're saying we're fake when they admit they're fake and
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:20.400]  passed a law that they can lie to us correct voice of America is an American
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:25.200]  propaganda arm for American propaganda it's it was out you couldn't broadcast
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.840]  voice of America in America due to anti-prop anti-propaganda laws then they
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.520]  changed the law and now you can broadcast voice of America inside America
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:36.000]  because our pro-propaganda there is no anti-propaganda laws anymore in America as
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.480]  I mentioned to you a while ago when I was doing my show in Paris I was
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:43.140]  approached from somebody from Voice America to do an on-air hissy fit
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:51.640]  resignation on RT and I was at the same time when that other girl and I told
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:55.320]  you know it's of course we know it's not really voice of America it's central
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:29:00.360]  intelligence they were flashing some big money around you don't get it I was a
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:04.400]  stockbroker in the 80s you can't bribe me you know when that was that sack of
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:07.380]  money you've got to come with a truck full of money or go home but he is
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:16.160]  bribeable you know the budget of Voice of America does not wouldn't wouldn't
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:20.920]  take me to the place I would need to go to undermine my own show you freaking

[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:56.880]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:03.200]  the Constitutional Convention 1787 was held strict secrecy and at the end of
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:06.480]  the proceeding citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:09.880]  produced behind closed doors while Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall a
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:14.480]  lady asked him well doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy to which he
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:18.760]  responded a republic if you can keep it but today not only have we lost a
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:22.320]  republic but most people don't even know what a republic even is for one thing
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:26.200]  a republic is not a democracy the republic operates under the rule law
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:29.480]  which protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:32.480]  rights of the minority under a public the government and its citizens all
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:35.840]  abide by the same laws regardless of political power or lack thereof
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:39.360]  democracy on the other hand only leads the mob rule fueled by the unrestrained
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:43.120]  whims of the public in a democracy the individual or any groups of individuals
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:46.360]  composing the minority have no protection against the unlimited power of the
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.600]  majority it is a case of majority over man in other words under democracy two
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:53.760]  wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner but under a republic the sheep's
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:57.600]  right to life is predicted by the rule law this is Kit Daniels with info wars

[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:07.120]  I was like okay they really are coming for us they admit they are I think it's
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:10.680]  a major miscalculation I'm not trying to be overconfident they were already
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:14.840]  planning to censor after the election Hillary said the alt-right will be
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:18.800]  discredited when they lose we have to shut them down well she wasn't even
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.800]  looking at the real polls now we're gonna have the president in there is not
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:25.240]  perfect I'm sure but isn't going to be for censorship of the media that got him
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:29.360]  into power any other media I hope how do you see this playing out well there's
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:33.120]  something else that isn't happening and we actually covered this yesterday on
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:41.000]  the show my partner and I do John C. Dvorak and that is the tort laws so now
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  there's gonna be you can see a lot of reporting about if someone creates fake
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  news or propagates fake news what legal recourse do you have against those
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.840]  people so I think you're going to see a number of key lawsuits where someone
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:58.360]  post something online and they're gonna get so I agree I think they're drumming
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:01.600]  it up and trying to maybe frame me as the test subject I've been picking up
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.600]  on that because they just keep saying things I didn't say well you are
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:07.480]  definitely the poster child of fake news today I mean they're putting you in
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.840]  everywhere which I think is fantastic I mean what a what an exposure I mean
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.320]  people are good people that's being honest so do you think they picked me
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:17.720]  because they think I'm weak or because I'm hurting them I mean I mean we are
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:21.880]  growing we are hurting them they all miscalculated and thought connected me to
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:26.320]  Trump would discredit him but their own numbers show I don't I think in general
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:29.280]  the people who produce the shows that will do that like you know it's the news
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:33.580]  networks you know CNN and MSNBC I think it's just because you're dynamic and
[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:37.600]  interesting to look at and if you live in a separate dimension which a lot of
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.840]  people do today and they have their own reality I think they believe things are
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:44.880]  true and I can't stop that oh that's all Hillary was really gonna win oh big time
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.640]  big time and they look at you when you're vocal and you're you know and of
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:52.120]  course it's always the moment where you're kind of energized that they put
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:56.520]  in there and that everyone is oh my god look at these people that's just a
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:59.920]  visual thing I don't think they're really thinking about and I agree I I think
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:04.200]  it's a disconnect too because it's not that we think Trump's perfect it's it's
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:08.160]  that Hillary's a real warmonger the V just like we rejected Jeff Bush
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:11.560]  everybody and then she stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders I think
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.600]  Sanders might have beaten Trump very possibly Joe Biden might have beaten
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:20.080]  Trump yeah I mean you know very possible very possible because he's got that
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:27.080]  whole blue-collar appeal he's everyone loves Joe yeah yeah I knew Hillary was
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:30.720]  gonna lose about a month before the election when Joe was giving speeches
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.960]  Biden and having to go look I know why you don't like her and I don't blame me
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:41.400]  okay I mean everybody's like yeah the crowd's like yeah like whoa man
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:45.840]  one Hillary stumbled away from parachuting Biden into the race all she
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:48.280]  had to do is just stumble one more time and she would have been carried out I
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:52.880]  think he was on deck I think so I think you kind of stumbled away into the
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.600]  finish line and then but again max the arrogance of running someone who was in
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.320]  the hospital for over a year in 2012-2013 we have the sources they didn't
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:04.440]  want to say definitively because it gets into records issues and things but she
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:08.080]  had a brain tumor removed I have this from high really high level people yeah
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:11.440]  and then the sucker reportedly is growing back hmm where does she
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:17.040]  laparoscopic surgery remove the brain tumor from with from the passing the
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:21.400]  instruments through the anus up through the alimentary canal into the back of
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:25.520]  the head are you and they captured the tumor it's actually out back through the
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:30.040]  the anus and it's not well reported but you know getting back to the legal
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:33.400]  aspect of things you know where they are that was fake news that was pretty
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:38.200]  that was really that's that's higher hey I said a month before the secret
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:41.920]  service told us she's falling down she has a black ambulance and then you
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.000]  everybody saw it happen I really got there from a secret service by the way
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.120]  was shaking when I saw him in Cleveland so we're gonna give the next few weeks
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:52.800]  and then these are secret service and then we got the info these guys are
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.800]  shaking because they're so conditioned not to tell the stuff well how does that's
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:59.800]  real news brother it's called Barrett criticize fake news when he made his
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:04.680]  bones as a satirist which is like he plays a fake right-winger right he is a
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:08.160]  fake news person but I was coming out against so-called fake news Ryan
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.640]  Williams why are they using Brian Williams the poster the king of fake
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:15.080]  news as the new crusader against well I know Brian Williams I've known him for a
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:20.360]  while and he when I was in New York living in New York New Jersey he would
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.840]  do human interest pieces for the local NBC station on like breast augmentation
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:28.800]  this guy is just a total robot he'll do whatever you tell him to do he really
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:32.240]  he's not a journalist as far as I'm concerned he's a hack yeah he's just a
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:36.760]  dude it looks apart he looks the broadcast yes you know it's a great
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:40.320]  movie about this he looks like a serial killer but it looks like a guy who does
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:44.680]  the news on TV he fills the role couldn't he star in the new American
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:49.400]  psycho easily easily that hammer guy on Fox I mean I'm not saying timbers bad but
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:53.720]  he looks scarier than Christian Bale did I agree with you that guy looks very
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:57.000]  scary I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley but back to Clinton I think
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.560]  what is happening I don't have you have you ever had Charles Ortele on no but
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:06.080]  I've heard of one yeah so he's a guy who he's a financial analyst and he really
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:09.160]  took apart the Clinton Foundation and there yeah let's get Charles Ortele on
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:14.480]  you definitely need to get this guy on there is so much fraud and abuse that he
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:18.160]  has identified and of course he's not getting on the air anywhere now and if I
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:23.480]  think that just the tentacles of that organization were so spread out
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:28.320]  throughout the political system and other large circles that everyone's
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:31.640]  deathly afraid they were afraid to do anything against the Clintons I really
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:35.520]  sure I mean I mean at the top they're all scared mercenaries but what about the
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.480]  minions that did you see the video of her give the speakers today saying we
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:41.600]  better have the government since people then her own minions were like squealing
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:46.320]  like like like like their mommy had just been killed yeah well these people have
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:51.160]  been terrorized are very very frightened and have grabbed on to mommy as you say
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:54.960]  I think that it's like Nora Desmond from Sunset Boulevard where you know the film
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:59.200]  the famous film Billy Wilder directed in the end where she's I'm ready for my
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:03.320]  close-up mr. DeMille and it's a demented ex-movie star going down the stairs and
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:06.560]  having a nervous breakdown that's where Hillary is in her political life great
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:10.880]  analogy thank you and what's the one where there's the two sisters and one's
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:16.360]  crazy dearest yeah no no no who's afraid of a baby something no whatever happened
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:18.720]  to baby Jane we're exactly whatever happened to baby Jane whatever happened
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:22.880]  to baby we're dating ourselves gentlemen that's Hillary as quick let's do
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:26.320]  some of the modern movies that's a hell yeah we're cars drive downhill for 30
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.960]  minutes running over boulders and don't blow a tire boom oh no it's worse than a
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:34.160]  cartoon at least you know with like Looney Tunes when the rock falls on the
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.400]  cody and doesn't kill him that it's not real well let me let me introduce I mean
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.360]  there's something Mickey Mouse I don't get that let me tell you why I'm
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.440]  introducing Mickey Mouse because Mickey Mouse is the reason why you have these
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:46.760]  draconian copyright laws in America every time Mickey Mouse is ready to
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:51.080]  enter the public domain they pass the copyright extension act and do the Walt
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:55.040]  Disney's corporate influence Sonny Bono famously did one the last time so a
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:41:00.160]  copyright last for now for lifetime plus I think 70 73 73 or 75 years so you
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:05.960]  have an in a sense perpetual copyright which means that ideas are owned by the
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:09.520]  corporations and this is where they attack they'll attack new media this is
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:12.520]  where they'll tell that's what drugs thought they would do you'll say on
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:17.040]  your show a phrase that they will claim is protected by copyright law and then
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:22.360]  that's how they will like Pope Francis is a turd burglar possibly Disney might
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:25.360]  suggest that they well the McDonald's corporation could say they own a
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.480]  hamburger and you're violating the hamburger name by saying turd burglar
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.920]  and therefore they have to you get an issued DMCA digital millennium copyright
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:38.920]  action and take our bonus they'll take it down but that's exactly right so even
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:42.160]  yet close enough to the name they'll say that's a copyright violation and they're
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:46.640]  expanding that under TPP that what that what does it is fake news
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:49.720]  you know Hillary said she's against it even if she gave speeches saying she
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:53.680]  helped write TPP expands the copyright card I want to take some phone calls
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.920]  it's amazing we have Max Kaiser Max Kaiser dot com let's go to James Steve
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:05.920]  Brian David Hector and a lot of folks let's go to Hawaii first and so let's
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:13.280]  talk to Steven you're on the air thanks for calling hi Alex hey buddy hey man
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:17.720]  I'm a huge fan then I even have your Bohemian Grove video from back in the
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:22.120]  80s I've been following you for years I want to say I appreciate what you do and
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:26.280]  I ask you guys to keep it up I got three things I want to mention for you real
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:31.240]  quick about the mainstream media it's not just the news that's being fake and
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:35.640]  pushing messages right now what people aren't paying attention to is it's also
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:41.040]  the regular television shows for instance just yesterday supernatural a
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:44.960]  television show where you know a couple of guys go around they're fighting
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:50.720]  evil fighting demons things like that they have to exercise Lucifer out of the
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:57.000]  president of the United States that's not like anything listen half the time I
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.880]  stop on some new cartoon it's guys in tri-quarter hats trying to blow up the
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.080]  chemical plant and poison the public and then Green Lantern has to beat them
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:08.680]  exactly I would say 20% of the propaganda is now in news mainstream news but
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:12.720]  yes Adam and Max what about the propaganda placement they call it
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:18.400]  behavior placement or product placement is all over the place and look I'm not
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:21.640]  against any gay people I don't even care the point is it's just everywhere gay
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:25.640]  gay gay gay gay we know it's a push message or it's anti-family or it's
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:30.400]  anti-gun or it's anti-america or the terrorist is you know bad because he
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:35.520]  believes that there's a world government I mean it's just crazy the message I think
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:39.600]  the public's rejecting it but what's your comments on that well we actually talk
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:45.080]  about this in a way the other day and if you look at what Norman Lear did and he
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:48.600]  still has a big influence that you know things the Lear Foundation or something
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:52.000]  and they write storylines for Hollywood and they're very open about it you know
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.440]  they they put storylines in the modern family and it could be about global
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:00.800]  warming or other social issues but really back in the days we had Archie
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:06.120]  Bunker and Archie Bunker became this grout we was a grouchy guy who hated the
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:10.920]  government and traditionally those guys were Democrats but Norman Lear made
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:15.800]  Archie Bunker a Republican and for years that became the face of what
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:19.120]  Republicans look like on television I think that's kind of where the switch
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:24.200]  went from you know the Republican Party who I freed the slaves you know they
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:28.560]  were kind of on the good side of things and then Archie Bunker became the face
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:34.320]  of the a-hole Republican I think that really set up and you're right in the
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:38.040]  60s there's all these hundreds of letters most of them were online from LBJ
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:41.280]  he wrote a lot of them from the Cattleman Suite down at the Driscoll wheel
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:45.040]  his mistress there didn't really live with his wife out at the ranch ladybird
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.920]  but little factoid and he was writing letters saying the Republicans pass the
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:53.200]  Civil Rights Act we gotta do something about this damn eyes and hour all those
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:57.880]  stuff you know we're gonna get you know get the inwards on welfare to control
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:01.920]  them they'll be voting Democrat for a hundred years I got a plan and then here
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:06.240]  comes Archie Bunker a decade later to get people to flip to think no no the
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:09.760]  old racist curmudgeons they're not Democrats they're Republicans and as you
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:14.880]  said they've accredited with one show more than anything with 30 million
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:18.640]  viewers 40 million viewers every episode they convinced everybody of a total
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.240]  upside-down world yeah so why is it not working now when they say anybody that
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:26.000]  wants to own a gun as a racist or anybody that is against Obamacare as a
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.040]  racist I think to a degree it is working and I mean it's it's definitely I
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:34.560]  think that yeah I can I can only say I think people do believe that but there's
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:39.520]  a a segment of the population that is more switched on and that is because of
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:44.160]  alternative forms leading up to this Trump election very closely on Twitter
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:48.880]  which was fascinating with Scott Adams the creator of Dilbert but he started
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:52.240]  writing and tweeting about persuasion and persuasion technologies and
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:56.200]  persuasion technology come out of something called neuro linguistic
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:00.480]  programming and also comes out of the casino industry which is very good at
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:06.080]  persuading people to part with their money using technology using very
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:09.720]  advanced psychometrics like filling casinos with certain sense that get
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:13.480]  people to you know uncomfortable to losing their money or they program
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:17.280]  machines and slot machines to win at the exact moment when somebody's about to
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:20.640]  give up and walk away from the slot machine and remember Trump is in the
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:23.800]  casino business he comes out of the casino business and he would be very
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:27.280]  familiar with that technology and how that works and that whole idea of
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:32.560]  persuasion technology getting people to you know you talk about fake news this
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:36.480]  would be fake empathy you need to create fake empathy sure it's it's it's
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:40.720]  Pavlovian in fact speak of the devil it's just broken info wars.com
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:45.880]  Merkel failing this should go all over the web folks this is huge I heard this
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:48.680]  today and I meant to cover it but I just forgot I was so busy but now they've
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:54.000]  had to retract fake news Newsweek retracts claim Trump supporters booed John
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.960]  Glenn I believe I was in total error that Trump supporters booed Glenn so now
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:02.120]  they first put it out to hurt him knowing everybody's sad about John Glenn
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:05.760]  the first American in the space and you know all the rest of it dying at 94
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:11.240]  or whatever yesterday Godspeed John Glenn and then later they admit okay they
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:17.200]  didn't really do it in fact they were like oh John oh he died not boo oh is
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:21.680]  we're sad not boo but this shows how desperate they are you know when Bruce
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:27.080]  Springsteen comes appears anywhere people in the audience still need to be
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:34.760]  explained that people are saying bruise and not boo so this is so typical it's
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:39.320]  it's a very it's an old tactic to just put out this false information that
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:42.440]  that's that is fake news by saying that they and they're the masters of it I
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:47.600]  mean take take take the head of the mr. son the head of the soft bank one of
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:51.200]  the biggest Japanese banks trillions as you know he he comes and says I like
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:54.840]  your new plan 50 billion invested in high-tech next year he walks up the
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:58.400]  elevator gives Trump credit and then even the Wall Street Journal he thinks
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:03.760]  more friendly says Trump kept claiming credit just everything is twisted it's
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:07.680]  not even that it's like it makes you like Trump because they're lying about
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:11.040]  him so much even if her stuff Trump does I don't like well the thing that is just
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:15.880]  obviously you know happening is exactly the same type of attitude that a lot of
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:21.360]  people harbored towards President Obama is now being harbored and expressed by
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:26.080]  the very same people who thought that was disgusting yes and we have a phrase
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:29.000]  in the Netherlands which is what you say being yourself with the copter the
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  health which means you are what you could use someone else of I thought that
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.160]  meant why are you putting mayonnaise on my french fries well that was a problem
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:39.880]  to let's talk to James and Arizona you're on the air with quite a trio I've
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:45.000]  got to say you're truly Alex Jones Max Kaiser and of course we have the former
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  top MTV star and so many other things you've done since then got your own
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:54.120]  powerful successful radio show right now Adam Curry joining us here in studio
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:49:00.400]  let's go to James and Arizona you're on the air hey Alex I've been watching you
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:05.720]  for a while found out about you during your rant with Pierce Morgan on gun
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:10.440]  control of that um that was a big moment for us we got we got millions of new
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:15.640]  listeners off that oh yeah I can definitely tell and it wasn't because he
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.680]  had a big audience you got picked up it was so big that was it was a great
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:23.160]  appearance it chased Pierce out of the country yeah I'm sorry I apologize call
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:28.800]  go ahead James no that's all right as a millennial I've actually been taking a
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:34.800]  look at this all fake news paradigm and I think the propaganda may have actually
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:38.680]  worked a little too well regarding Hillary Clinton because they were trying
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:43.200]  to as liberals would do when I was in high school that they were trying to
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:48.520]  propagate communism and socialism and since they did that to such a degree you
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:53.400]  have the complete and total socialist and you have the people who are the
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:58.240]  counterculture the free market and you only have those two paradigms now so oh
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.520]  I agree it's become very avant-garde and cutting edge to buck the system because
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:07.360]  it's so clear the entire power structure Republican leadership Democratic
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:11.680]  leadership the Pope the communist Chinese the Saudis everyone's saying we
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:15.560]  can't you know make America great again what do you guys make of that I lived in
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:20.880]  a lot of countries and this is the best one and I won't give up on the idea that
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:23.920]  we can make it work yeah that's the thing it's easy to bash America leave in
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:28.480]  other country I lived in the Netherlands I lived in Belgium I lived in the UK the
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:34.160]  UK by the way I enjoyed my time there you want some racists it's the most racist
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:37.400]  people I've ever met in the UK and they do it with well that's true it with a
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:41.520]  smile a smile understated we get a lot of grief in the United States when young
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:45.640]  especially around the world you know you you guys invented slavery and all the
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:49.320]  stuff like me okay well maybe you should take a look at your own country well

[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:28.600]  the EU named us and said shut us down oh Hilary gave a speech yesterday and said
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:32.320]  Congress needs to pass laws already passed the house to literally do stuff
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:37.000]  50 times worse than McCarthy I mean I cannot it's the best of times worst of
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.120]  times and sure it's fun to get attacked by all these people they're so discredited
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:44.540]  that it just mainly turns people on to you but there's still the unstable people
[01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:47.400]  I'm running into that literally see me and go to the other side of the street
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:52.320]  now and look at me like I am a murdering demon because of all the weird stuff they
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.840]  edit together and you know the things they do like in PR videos goes like
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:59.600]  Joan says Hillary chops up children herself and murders them wash and
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:03.360]  post go to the article Joan says Hillary is responsible for killing children by
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:07.440]  funding rebels in Syria that actually rape and murder and chop up children I
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:12.240]  mean it you know they it's a new level of deception it's very very serious and so
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:14.720]  let me ask you this question before we go back to calls I mean you're kind of
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:17.520]  some short segments here towards the end of start of the hour so I apologize for
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:22.320]  that isn't the danger that we get so used to knowing we're right about a lot
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:25.720]  of these things that we laugh at the enemy but don't realize they're still
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:30.080]  in central control and then they just move forward and start a new war or
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:35.240]  cause an economic collapse or whatever the case may be well I would say I have
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:39.880]  high hopes for a new president so maybe some of that will go away but Alex
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:44.760]  you're no different than than Russia and Putin you are just another enemy they
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:49.880]  and an enemy is needed and it's you I'm really happy it's you because I know
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:53.680]  you're a good guy I'm not worried about it but that they need an enemy and I
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.000]  think that's what's taking place here and that's all they got so they go for
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.040]  the biggest guy and we'll use you over and over again but I think you're right
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:04.800]  when you did the Pierce Morgan show you got a lot of extra listeners and people
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:10.400]  glom on and oh yeah we had like we had like 10 million terrestrial listeners a
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:14.840]  week maybe a million and a half visitors the site that was good show it was like
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:19.600]  three four times that by the time the election hit and now it's double at least
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.680]  what it was for the election it's scary I think that's why they're attacking it's
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:26.680]  because they say we can practice on this guy and target and figure out what works
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:30.040]  on him then we'll work on everybody else I think that's what that's possible
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:34.080]  they're just targeting but they'll be foolish to take you down then what Max
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:40.960]  Kaiser he's no opponent well I let's stop saying I'm big Max has probably a
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:45.120]  bigger show than I did yeah no doubt does the New York Times ever contact me to
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:48.400]  comment about no that's because you clearly cross over liberal and
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:53.120]  conservative and clearly are right on so many you're an authentic liberal you're
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:56.360]  an authentic liberal so they're scared to take you on they're they're on the
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:02.400]  ignore you face well I mean I have a big show on RT have been a thousand
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:06.480]  episodes and it's seen all over the world not a single media outlet in America
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:11.960]  has contacted me to comment on this influence so-called of RT the Russians
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:15.200]  run everything let's not call the big American yeah yeah I mean if you're
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:18.480]  really curious about what's going on there call me but they never have it
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:21.000]  shows that they've never done any research they've never done they just got
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.520]  the piece of paper from up top that said criticize Russia and Putin and don't do
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:29.160]  anything any other investigation into it maybe you shouldn't tell people then
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:33.240]  that Putin told you to say haven't well I let's not give any cannon fuck maybe I
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:38.160]  was just trying to you know I'm sure it's all right back in 70 seconds with
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:42.000]  your phone calls I promise I hate the fact that most the answer the end and

[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:05.480]  their synthetic sugars are also terrible for you but it when you cut those
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:11.120]  sweeteners out of your diet and refined flour you know potatoes cut starch out
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:15.520]  cut the pies and the cakes your body you know is gonna naturally turn to stuff
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:19.240]  that's good for you I agree you are even worse you're in a freaking walk you know
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:22.760]  in Texas I got a lot of guacamole down here guacamole fantastic you know get
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:27.640]  what about a we both have ADHD will you please get into the economy what do you
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:30.880]  want to know about the economy it's weird we got truck with one system and the
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:33.840]  globals are trying to implode things to consolidate it how are the two gonna
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:38.080]  collapse you know this conquest collapse economy rent seeking economy the
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:41.720]  gulag you talk about yeah versus this prosperity train how do those two
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:46.520]  collide it's gonna be as we were alluding to there's gonna be a lot of
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:50.480]  you know wind shear or there's gonna be a lot of opposing forces obviously the
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:55.400]  stock market is at at all-time highs pushing 20,000 he sat at $1 trillion
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:00.140]  in value there it's been an unbelievable move Warren Buffett is down the 400
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:05.440]  billion club with his company Berkshire Hathaway Apple Computer Google is now
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:10.720]  called alphabet and the Japanese said we love the new attitude 50 billion day
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:18.040]  one yeah but you know the markets you know you know me a culpa you know we you
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:22.400]  know the idea was that this would be a market loser you know you'd have an
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:26.800]  immediate downtick in markets with a Trump victory and I think just about
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:30.400]  every pundit in the world was of that mind I didn't think that okay fair enough
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:35.440]  and you had this enormous rally on on the back of the Trump victory and it
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:38.800]  shows you I'll say this is a lot bigger than I thought it'd be yeah it's a huge
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:42.240]  rally and what's going on people just know they're gonna get their taxes cut
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:45.400]  so they're gonna spend more if you hear all the restaurants are seeing surges
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:49.720]  they're they're gonna cut taxes it's a very they mean they're comparing it to
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:53.440]  Reagan but here's a big difference you know Reagan when Reagan came into office
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:58.600]  interest rates were very very high they were 17 18 19 percent on on interest
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:03.600]  rates and you had been Paul Volcker and then Volcker came in and they started
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:07.720]  bringing interest rates down for 25 30 years and as a result of bond markets
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:11.920]  been doing great for 25 or 30 years well now when Trump's coming into office
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:15.880]  you know the bond market you know you have interest rates of 1% or 2% the bond
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:21.000]  markets already at rock bottom you know it's you know interest rates already at
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.240]  rock bottom levels and so the idea that you're gonna have that kind of move down
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:29.720]  and rates again to sustain this move it is really hard to imagine that's
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:33.440]  possible so I think you're gonna you're definitely gonna I would say this you
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:36.760]  know by the election sell the inauguration that that's how I would
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:41.280]  play this I think on the on the election people exuberantly got back in
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:45.040]  there so they're gonna deregulate saying buy up until the 20th sell on the 20th
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:48.320]  yeah I think on the inauguration you're gonna have you know pull back are you
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:52.440]  saying sell by Friday the 20th yeah I think I think you know first of all
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:58.080]  don't do what I'm saying because in the last two or three years my my stock
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:03.600]  market analysis has been extremely inconsistent because it's just been some
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:06.840]  you know they're talking about fake news for a second well even a leader losing
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:11.440]  control fake news comes from something called fake prices no fake prices you
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:14.760]  know there's an old saying on Wall Street called price precedes news and
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:17.200]  typically markets are discounting mechanisms and you'll see the price
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:20.440]  movement in stocks or bonds or commodities and then the news will come
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:23.160]  out because the insiders are very sensitive and they talk to each other
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:25.560]  sure they want to know what's gonna happen before so they make their moves
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:30.960]  price price precedes news now I would say that fake prices precede fake news so
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:33.520]  when people talk about fake news they don't understand it's because it's the
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:37.560]  result of fake prices all the false government statistics that have come
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:41.600]  out all the market manipulation the precious metals all the kind of insider
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:45.480]  sure you've got fake news reporting on fake economic numbers right and you have
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:50.460]  robots who are trading on this fake prices and then that spills over into
[02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:56.160]  fake news so I mean I'm like so so so so fulfilling prophecy it is it always is
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:05:01.560]  in markets but more and more men give your body the support it needs with

[02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:10.440]  came in last night at half past ten that baby of mine was
[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:14.120]  international journalist host of the hit tv show the kaiser report max kaiser's
[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:17.240]  in studio well this is not an interview me for a film he's making and
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:21.400]  also his weekly tv show on rt anthony cumming of famous syndicated radio talk
[02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:25.160]  show host does his own daily broadcast his own network with hundreds of millions
[02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:30.520]  of blisters total a year twice a month or so comes in and does
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:34.120]  the thursday fourth hour and sometimes i say hey
[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:37.400]  you want me to hold over a little bit and babble with you he says absolutely and
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:40.440]  so he's invited us on a little bit just to finish up
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:43.160]  because there's so much to get to here and i want to get his take on this not
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:46.040]  because it's about me but because it's next level
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:49.800]  i like steven gobert i think he's funny but he's posing as a news anchor so you
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:53.240]  can get away with more and it's very very leftist okay fine
[02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:55.960]  but he does this 11-minute piece what i haven't played it today we're gonna play
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:59.960]  some of the not only news tonight kaiser attacking me demonizing me
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:03.720]  he says wiki leaks is fake he actually says fake alex jones is fake and red
[02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:06.360]  it's fake and then he goes and shows a bunch of theories
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:10.440]  that i didn't say or twist them they use a washington post quote where i say
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:13.800]  hillary kills children she chops them up and rapes them
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:16.360]  but of course the full quote when you actually go to the video they link to
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:20.680]  as i said by funding al-qaeda and isis rebels in libya and syria now the
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:24.440]  washington post admitted that but mpr ran it yesterday
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:27.480]  nationally and locally his plug got unplugged
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:31.400]  i am i am fine it's all right we don't freak out like mainstream media
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:34.840]  so we're gonna we're gonna get a teleprompter in here
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:37.720]  it's okay that someone's unplugged me you're gonna plug him to get her into
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:40.520]  the kumia we're gonna do a new show called i'll show you where the whole
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:43.960]  what about doing a show alex jones unplugged unplugged but let's get
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:47.000]  serious for a minute where's my plug and so
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:51.640]  mpr ran it with a quote of meat on local and national i actually have the
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:55.160]  clips from and i never got to him today where they say
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:59.720]  alex says she chops up and rapes children yeah and it's edited me talking
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:02.440]  about she says i don't know this all this pedophile stuff's real
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:05.480]  but i know she funded the murder rape and torture of children by funding
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:08.920]  radical islamists that's general flinn that's declassified
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:13.320]  that's come out in the news so all i'm saying is it's next level twisting
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:16.760]  next level lying where i have family calling me last night going
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:21.400]  did you say she chops up kids i go and find the damn thing took me an hour
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:25.320]  and sure enough it's an out-of-context quote so how do you counter lies of this
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:29.160]  magnitude well i what about abu gray prison i
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:32.840]  mean it was totally normalized the torture in state
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:38.040]  and rape of these prisoners by americans and apparently some of those tapes were
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:41.000]  sent to dick cheney and his wife that are watching them
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:46.280]  as part of their sexual pro proclivities uh you know that was the beginning of
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:49.560]  the psychosexual escapades in american politics so
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:53.240]  you know now they're trying trying to turn that on the media the alternative
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:57.160]  media the new media calling wiki leaks fake that's just documents
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:01.400]  but you know wiki leaks again is probably the single greatest influence
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:05.480]  that killed hillary clinton's president
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:09.800]  and you know why co-bear's man he came out in the wiki leaks have you heard this
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:13.320]  yeah here it is right here he's in a whole bunch of them
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:17.320]  saying and his producers are being directed by hillary and podesta
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:20.040]  look the problem with doing i wonder it's not funny anymore you know the problem
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:23.400]  with doing comedy news like if you have john stewart john stewart stepped out
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:26.760]  at the perfect time because he left steven colbert to
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:30.440]  implode you know the problem with doing comedy and trying to do news and comedy
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:35.640]  and fake news comedy is that eventually you know it it eats you alive
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:39.480]  because essentially colbert will never be taken seriously at the end of the day
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:43.560]  because he is really a comedian and this is what kills a lot of comics in the
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:47.800]  end uh because you can't escape the fact that you're a clown
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:52.920]  and no one should take you seriously and so now he's upset because he's he's not
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:55.640]  to be taken seriously in fact on election night he was saying
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:58.440]  there are you being funny goes no i can't do it anymore right and it's like
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:01.480]  dude why didn't you just become a news anchor he should step down then if he
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:05.320]  can't be a comedian anymore well he's genuinely pissed in this telling me to
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:08.520]  effing grow up well he should step down because he's not
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:11.240]  funny anymore uh his job is to make people laugh
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:14.680]  that's his job he's a clown if he can't make people laugh and sure sure well he
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:17.640]  said there was no way trump would win to be a landslide so who's the fake news
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:21.000]  anthony kumia who runs his own network will put it up on screen for everybody
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:24.120]  i've just got the great gavin mcginnis and many others on uh we're honored to

[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:56.760]  a meltdown's happening alex i am so proud by the way
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:13:01.880]  that you are now the number one scourge of the left you're the guy
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:04.840]  it we've seen it happen over the years with other people
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:08.520]  rush back when uh clinton was president and bright bar and everything
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:12.360]  you have taken talk about that new level you are now
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:16.680]  the brand new absolute scourge to the left i love it
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:20.840]  don't know what to do about it it's fast it's fascinating to watch
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:24.520]  and it's fantastic but what do i do because i mean i'm sure you have people
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:27.080]  come up to you on the street but you have and you call them idiots like they
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:30.280]  aren't you get fired i'm having people literally
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:33.960]  run from me in these displays or say they want to kill me now
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:37.480]  for no reason i'm just sitting there and it's not very liberal
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:41.080]  well you are uh you you kind of are the face
[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:47.640]  of of alternative media of the the media that was giving the people the truth
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:51.960]  during the 18 months of campaigning that we saw while they were uh
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:55.320]  lying to everybody and then when push comes to shove and
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:00.360]  and the election happens and we see who was actually right and who was wrong
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:03.320]  they like to dub everyone that was right as like he's
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:07.560]  fake news uh and so you're the face of that
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.000]  to them but meanwhile to america and to the people that
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:14.600]  uh voted for uh for trump uh you were the guy
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:18.360]  that had it right it's crazy and here's a silly analogy
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:21.160]  it's like if you have this car they sell you the mainstream media you try to
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:24.600]  start it the engine falls out like a like an old uh
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:29.000]  three suges cartoon as you drive off the lot and black smoke and it stalls
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.600]  that's mainstream media lies nothing's true twisted talking points
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:36.360]  proven as a fraud info wars or compound media or max kaiser
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:41.640]  a drug report put the key in starts great going 80 down the highway
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:46.120]  they call that fake they call delivering and being accurate and having giant
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:49.080]  audiences fake so i'm glad that the fake news
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:52.040]  calls us fake but but i'm gonna hand the baton to you and get a final comment
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:55.240]  from uh our friend max kaiser here but both of you at first
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:58.280]  anthony where do you see this going then i mean because they really have
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:01.000]  collapsed now they said they want state-run media
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.720]  will they be able to actually do this it is so like i said it's fascinating
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:08.600]  fascinating and fun to watch this whole thing because
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:12.920]  they don't know what to do all they can do is what they've been doing
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:16.680]  and what that did was get everyone in the country
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:21.720]  to absolutely not trust them anymore and they see everybody going to these
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:26.600]  other sources to find their news and they're in panic mode and you got people
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:31.400]  like you mentioned a colbert who uh was the fake
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:36.040]  conservative guy on comedy central and was unbelievably popular
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:39.800]  and now he's himself and no one could stand the guy
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:43.720]  so they don't know what to do they're scrambling
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:48.280]  meanwhile guys like you and i and gavin and your guests here and everybody
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:50.920]  else that's giving people what they want
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:54.280]  are they have to be labeled so this will continue but
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:58.280]  i think we saw a grand awakening of people in america
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:03.400]  and they're not as stupid as they were even a year ago as far as the media is
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:07.400]  concerned and we say they're lying to us and now we know it
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:11.240]  i read and take max i would call max classical liberal but he's been like in
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:14.120]  trump when it was on popular for a year by the way how did you get away with
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:17.640]  that with your liberal audience i mean it you don't care
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:20.280]  yeah they don't care i mean looking at the logic of it but i mean you know
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:23.720]  henry herself says she had two personas one for the public and one for private
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:27.560]  she's totally inauthentic she had her speeches for goldman sacks where she
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:30.840]  gave one speech and then she gave her speeches for the public whereas
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:33.400]  trump gives kind of the same speech to everybody
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:37.240]  and your show is you're authentically alex jones i mean
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:40.280]  yeah you're down here in texas you're kind of a redneck if i can use that
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:43.080]  expression without causing too much uh i don't care
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:47.000]  consternation but that you're authentically who you are and
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:50.920]  you know we are free to dismiss some of what you're saying and
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:53.560]  we're free to embrace some of what you're saying too but you know there's a
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:56.280]  word is it go with them i don't feel like you you know when you
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:59.160]  hang up the microphone you go and you're a completely different person no that
[02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:01.960]  you're not you're the same guy on air who's off air
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:05.240]  and so this is the awesome asking what what happens to them now
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:08.360]  i think that they go the way of the dodo they're being
[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:12.760]  they're they are becoming extinct you know the the media there's only 24 hours a
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:15.560]  day people can only watch so much media per day per person
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:18.840]  and if you're not being watched uh you know you're not going to get the support
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:22.520]  sure they go extinct but they're saying they want to shut us down
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:25.400]  and already in europe and on facebook we're starting to block our articles
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:28.840]  it's on drudge today so i want everybody to know they bring us down i'm just
[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:31.400]  going along vacation till the revolution's won
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:34.600]  they're going to shut everybody down so everybody to know if they can shut
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:38.200]  banning down drudge right martin infor's those that's who they're listening
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:40.840]  and i tell you i don't like actually it's weird to be number one being attacked
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:44.120]  because it is happening i've reached number one status and it's kind of fun
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:47.960]  but kind of not fun because i'm like these are serious criminals you know
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:51.560]  i mean these people's like overthrow governments what do i do but i guess it's
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:54.120]  just if they're having a mess with me though it shows how pathetic they are
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:57.080]  well there's a tremendous move toward localism so i think people's media
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:00.040]  becomes very local just like everything else is becoming more local economies
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:02.440]  are becoming more local media is becoming more local
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:05.160]  and there will always be room for honest discourse all right i'm gonna hand the
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:07.720]  baton this guy because i'm hogging the hour and i'm honored he's here doing

[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:31.800]  territory uh just like we saw with donald trump an
[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:37.960]  absolute non-politician and uh he comes in and takes over yeah i've never held

[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:04.440]  and i see how horrible this is as far as uh
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:08.120]  who has been in charge over uh the past few years so
[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:11.800]  that's what so they don't know what to do about that
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:17.160]  it freaks them out that they have these people that are coming into
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:23.400]  their little uh their little playroom and as far as the media's media goes
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:27.720]  absolutely got alex jones uh saying things that uh
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:32.360]  the the mainstream media won't say and won't talk about because again

[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:31.560]  it's so much fun uh the attention alex has gotten over the the course of this
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:37.000]  election has been astounding um and so entertaining to uh to watch
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:41.080]  like we were talking about before when alex was on they don't know what to do
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:45.640]  they are at a complete loss the mainstream media
[02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:51.800]  as to what to do about this distrust that has come up over the fact that
[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:56.840]  they were completely lying to us well for years and years we all knew this
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:26:00.440]  we would say wow the media is lying media is lying and they always had some
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:05.080]  form of plausible deniability uh somebody could always argue the point
[02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:09.720]  and and convince some people others were completely convinced that uh
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:14.280]  that the media was indeed lying to us i was always in that
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:19.080]  boat i thought the media was very dishonest for a long time
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:27.080]  and wouldn't just take it at face value so uh we get to the campaign and now
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:33.000]  it's blatantly obvious their goal to get hillary clinton elected
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:36.680]  they threw out any bit of integrity
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:40.280]  journalistic integrity uh it just went out the window
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:45.000]  they said this is so important to get this woman elected
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:51.160]  that we don't even care if everyone notices that we're lying to them it's
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:55.080]  obvious that's what happened it was that important
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:27:02.040]  and they also had no uh defense against this new
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:08.120]  alternative media that was going on it was always a joke to them to have
[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:14.840]  bloggers and video bloggers and and people writing articles it was a goof
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:18.360]  right oh you got you got this going on the internet oh that's
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:22.440]  that's cute and everything but the truth of the matter is that was getting
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:27.880]  traction and the more distrust there was in mainstream media
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:32.040]  over the course of the uh 18 months of this campaigning that went on
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:38.040]  uh alternative media gained traction and people started saying it's so
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:41.720]  obvious they're lying to us now where can i go
[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:48.040]  to get uh the truth or at least to get facts that are coming out so i can
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:54.040]  uh compute it myself and and and draw a conclusion on my own
[02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:58.280]  instead of being fed your opinions by mainstream media
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:01.720]  so they just didn't know what to do they sacrificed any
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:05.720]  integrity they thought we still believed that they had
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:09.960]  uh by trying to get hillary elected and then
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:14.040]  the bottom fell out the the plan was supposed to be
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:19.800]  hillary gets elected and now it's the same kind of quid pro quo between the
[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:25.000]  administration and the media and that was it now everyone's
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.800]  gotta watch the media the mainstream media if you
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:31.240]  want to hear what the president's saying more lies but
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:36.440]  you know as time goes on uh their their trust will come back
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:40.600]  well that didn't happen did it uh donald trump gets elected
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:45.000]  he chooses on many occasions uh to just go to twitter
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:51.480]  and go to youtube uh hit social media up hit alternative media up and spread
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:55.800]  his word that way and how interesting is that
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:29:00.920]  that the media put all their money all their money on that one bet
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:04.120]  that they would back hillary clinton make it blatantly obvious they were
[02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:07.880]  lying to the american people about the election
[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:13.080]  and lo and behold they crapped out as you say uh in
[02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:17.160]  atlantic city or or vegas they uh they threw the dice
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:21.880]  and lost and uh i couldn't be happier and people that are uh
[02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:26.920]  part of this alternative media uh couldn't be happier because
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:30.920]  people's their their trust is not going back to mainstream media
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:36.120]  and i don't know what will happen i i think uh as as alex's guest said they
[02:29:36.120 --> 02:29:38.920]  might go to the dodo bird the way of the dodo bird
[02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:42.840]  um but it is interesting to watch we're at a very
[02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:45.720]  important crossroads as far as how people get their uh
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:52.360]  information be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex
[02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:58.680]  jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.680 --> 02:30:03.000]  president obama is guilty of high crimes misdemeanors you may not know about
[02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:06.280]  until now for one thing he illegally gave obama care
[02:30:06.280 --> 02:30:09.640]  exemptions to unions that supported the passage of obama care
[02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:13.320]  that's right obama gave some of his favorite organizations exemption from
[02:30:13.320 --> 02:30:16.760]  some of obama care's requirements because many of them were unions and
[02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:20.280]  other groups that pressured the public to support the socialist program
[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:23.960]  once these groups realized just how bad obama care really was
[02:30:23.960 --> 02:30:27.480]  they wanted exemptions from the very same law they forced on everyone else
[02:30:27.480 --> 02:30:31.800]  which obama gave them president obama also had the irs grant special
[02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:35.320]  illegal favors for his brother's so-called charity the daily color
[02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:38.680]  reported the iris had taken the unprecedented step of approving a

[02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:48.760]  retroactive approval for the organization's tax exempt status

[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:34.680]  um yeah i i loved when alex was also talking about us steven cold bear
[02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:41.320]  and uh that whole ilk uh we talked about the media being um liars
[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:45.880]  and uh losing their their journalistic integrity what little they had left
[02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:49.800]  anyway um these late night talk shows and things like
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:53.400]  it'll well everything on comedy central uh the daily show
[02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:59.320]  uh is just a bastion of left-wing ideology um
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:03.480]  to hear yeah that's great steven cold bear
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:09.880]  tells alex jones to grow the f up that's uh that's something
[02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:13.640]  that's something here's a guy that had a very successful career on comedy
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:17.720]  central uh funny guy when he was playing
[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:22.200]  a sort of a bill o'reilly type that was his character
[02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:26.200]  and um then we we uh we see he goes over to
[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:31.800]  late night and uh he stinks he's not funny at all
[02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:37.480]  and and it's because i think the only reason he was able to be funny
[02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:43.000]  was he was portraying somebody that could have a sense of humor
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:46.600]  the left is incapable of having a sense of humor
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:49.800]  and these are the people that are supposedly the artists
[02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:55.960]  and entertainers uh that that uh give us all that wonderful uh uh
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:59.320]  entertainment movies and comedy and what and and
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:04.200]  in their real lives they are incapable of humor
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:08.040]  they're incapable of understanding sarcasm
[02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:13.160]  and context they hear something and lose their minds
[02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:18.040]  uh it's it's genuinely fun to watch um especially
[02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:21.560]  in this uh this time now because we kind of see
[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:25.880]  things are changing things are changing i i don't know where they're going to go
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:30.680]  from this point but um that pendulum is definitely starting to
[02:35:30.680 --> 02:35:37.320]  go the other way and um i like it uh donald trump of course
[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:44.040]  president elect uh choosing his cabinet and uh well
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:50.040]  the media hates it don't they and democrats and liberal they hate it
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:56.440]  they cannot every appointment they have something to say about it
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:36:03.560]  it's racist sexist homophobic misogynistic all wrapped up into uh
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:07.160]  one guy donald trump and he's picky he's choosing his cabinet
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:11.080]  and uh the latest thing here's the latest thing that they're losing their
[02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:16.520]  minds over too many military people they don't like the
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:23.640]  fact that donald trump has been choosing uh generals generals
[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:28.200]  as part of his cabinet and they're freaking out about it
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:32.280]  now i guess one of the stats is uh good old richard nixon
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:38.600]  back uh in in the day as they say um he had uh 12 people in his cabinet seven
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:42.760]  of which were military where they were they were
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:49.080]  former military men and uh you know so far donald trump uh
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:56.200]  two i think two working on three maybe and they're losing uh their minds
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:37:01.000]  so we got uh john kelly john kelly a marine general
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:05.880]  john kelly uh to lead the department of homeland security
[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:11.160]  wouldn't you want this i i hear the complaints sometimes
[02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:15.960]  and i am beside myself as to why they're complaining
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:22.600]  don't you want a military man to be a head of homeland security
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:28.920]  somebody that understands the enemy understands the people that wish that we
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:34.200]  weren't secure uh it makes no sense to me
[02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:39.240]  to uh start getting on on trump's appointments
[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:46.280]  in this way he that's who you want uh another one of course of course mad dog
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:52.280]  mattis mad dog mattis uh for defense secretary and
[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:57.160]  here's another one defense secretary you you absolutely want this
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:38:01.720]  we have been under uh obama's regime
[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:06.440]  for eight years and i think so many people have grown used to
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:14.280]  being castrated as a nation gelded uh they start saying things like
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:18.680]  oh having uh military people these generals in in place in the cabinet
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:22.920]  will uh uh people want to they'll want to go to war
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:29.000]  they'll stir up uh mad dog and they'll want to go to war and it's like
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:34.200]  these people understand war they've been in war
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:40.280]  they've been commanders they've had people uh under them in their command
[02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:46.040]  they understand the seriousness of war and and that it shouldn't be taken on
[02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:49.560]  lightly and it shouldn't be taken on for the wrong reasons
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:55.480]  uh they they don't look at it like uh how much will it cost
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:39:01.960]  to send my men in there they've been there they are the best people for those
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:07.320]  jobs so to have uh uh people in the media come out and
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:14.280]  just because it's donald trump start uh getting on his case about his appointments
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:21.000]  is so obvious why they're doing it anything donald trump does
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  they will um a bash because they they don't want him to succeed
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:31.640]  is what it is they want him to continue to be portrayed as
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:39.080]  um a womanizing uh unstable uh not smart you know all those things they called
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:43.880]  them for 18 months to try to uh not have him elected
[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:50.920]  they want that continued um why i guess maybe they're gunning for 2020
[02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:58.680]  um or or even the midterm elections in 2018 but look horrible bosses trump to
[02:39:58.680 --> 02:40:05.560]  pick fast food ceo for labor now that this this guy's a ceo of i believe
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:12.760]  carls jr and uh the the guy knows how to run a business
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:18.840]  it's another appointment was uh wilbur ross for the secretary of commerce and
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:22.200]  it's the same thing oh wilbur ross the guy's worth
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:29.640]  two and a half billion dollars well we can as the secretary of commerce
[02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:36.360]  don't you want a guy that's made two and a half billion dollars
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:41.160]  as the secretary of commerce i'll tell you what it sounds like a pretty good
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:44.440]  idea i don't even think you have to delve too
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:47.240]  far into it i don't think you have to be an economics
[02:40:47.240 --> 02:40:51.240]  a major to figure out that a guy that has made himself
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:54.920]  two and a half billion dollars probably knows something about
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:41:01.880]  commerce am i am i being ridiculous here but of course it's
[02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:07.080]  terrible because again the obama administration has trained people and
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:10.760]  especially when you think of eight years this is eight years
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:14.360]  that he's been in office so kids in their 20s
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:22.040]  early 20s were barely into puberty when he uh took over
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:26.280]  so they've had their entire adult life so far teens
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:29.480]  and adult life their little portion of their 20s
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:37.720]  if you will um to look at at obama as well this is the way things go right
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:41.240]  so then you have somebody like trump come in and say no we ought to have
[02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:45.480]  generals in this position we ought to have a successful businessman
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:51.000]  in this position and they lose their minds because they're told by the way
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:57.800]  that military men are evil killers and they're told that rich people are
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:42:01.960]  evil and and they just stomp on the poor to
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:06.040]  make their money and never do their fair share as far as
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:09.800]  taxes goes and contributing to this country
[02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:12.440]  so so they they look at this and then the media
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:17.400]  feeds it to them and they go oh my god why is he appointing these people
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:23.560]  when if you took a second and used common sense you'd go
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:27.240]  well that that seems to make sense you would want to
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:33.800]  a general in charge of homeland security you would want a general in charge of
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:38.440]  the defense department you would want a successful businessman
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:44.440]  in charge of commerce and then you come to the end of the housing and urban
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:51.160]  development HUD well Ben Carson
[02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:54.440]  what does he know about housing and urban development
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:57.960]  well you know what maybe nothing maybe nothing
[02:42:57.960 --> 02:43:01.160]  but there have been plenty of people that have been experts
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:05.640]  in housing and urban development that have stunk
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:11.480]  uh uh their their own king obama came into the presidency with
[02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:17.160]  barely any experience and not as far as foreign policy goes
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:20.920]  and the first thing they wanted to do was rip on donald trump for having no
[02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:25.400]  foreign policy experience well you loved obama when he
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:29.400]  did it uh ben Carson secretary of housing and urban
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:34.760]  development here's a guy that obviously knows how
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:41.480]  to um build himself up get himself out of he got himself out of the
[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:47.080]  ghetto when he was growing up educated himself became a
[02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:50.680]  neurosurgeon don't think that's easy to do
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:54.200]  i'm not sure i'm no brain surgeon so i don't know if it's even easy
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:58.680]  to be a brain surgeon but that's what he did
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:06.040]  i think i think somebody of his qualifications can learn
[02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:13.240]  what housing and urban development needs and how he can provide what it
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:17.240]  needs don't you think i think donald trump uh
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:22.200]  has been delegating responsibility uh his entire life
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:25.960]  that's why when people said oh my god donald trump for president what's he
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:29.640]  gonna do what's he he's gonna put the right people in the right
[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:34.360]  place that's what he's done his entire career
[02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:38.360]  he's never i i've never seen one shot of him uh with a
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:43.880]  a welder's torch and uh pulling down his mask and and welding something on a
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:46.520]  building but i see plenty of buildings uh that he's
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:50.200]  put up never seen him with a rivet gun never seen him
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:56.200]  tarring a roof but it all gets done because he's delegated that responsibility
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:01.480]  and that's exactly what he's doing now if donald trump is qualified
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:06.200]  to do anything we don't know how he's going to be as president of the united
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:09.560]  states because he's never been president he doesn't have a
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:13.720]  political background but if there's one thing we know he's good at
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:17.800]  it's getting the right people in the right jobs
[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:23.480]  to finish something to get something done uh that i don't think can even be
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:28.920]  denied because that's been his career over the years
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:33.880]  so when he picks a cabinet and every time he picks a new name
[02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:39.560]  they they have a problem with it uh it just shows again how
[02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:43.400]  dishonest this media is that we have in this country
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:47.320]  how they are continuing to lie to us for their own
[02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:54.520]  means so they can get something uh as that goes on uh yeah
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:58.360]  ben carson not qualified could you imagine
[02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:03.800]  could you imagine if a democrat like hillary would have won the presidency
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:07.800]  she goes to a point an african-american to the housing and urban
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:13.560]  urban development and republicans and conservatives turn around and say
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:17.880]  oh my god not qualified terrible pick
[02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:22.040]  how quickly do you think the word racist would come out
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:28.120]  i say immediately i'd say immediately the word racist comes out
[02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:34.120]  so uh again the hypocrisy on that left is astounding
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:37.880]  from everything from the uh coverage of the election
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:43.720]  to the recount is anyone even paying attention to the recount anymore i don't
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:49.880]  know is jill stein still uh trying to uh bs everybody
[02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:53.800]  and say uh that she did done this even if hillary won
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:58.760]  even if hillary clinton won i would still be behind this recount
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:03.080]  but we're only counting states that uh trump won and important states that
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:06.440]  trump won yeah and i'll be speaking in front of a
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:11.160]  trump uh uh tower i'll be doing that so if hillary
[02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:15.880]  won she'd drive to chap uh quah uh and uh stand in front of
[02:47:15.880 --> 02:47:18.920]  clinton's house and do that is that what you would have done
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:24.040]  it's again the hypocrisy the phoniness the lying
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:31.000]  doomed recount effort is fading yes it is and she still can't quite explain why
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:35.480]  she did it it's i'll tell you why i'll tell you why
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:39.320]  because hillary and everyone that supported hillary
[02:47:39.320 --> 02:47:46.600]  needed somebody to grab that grenade and uh and and throw themselves on top
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:49.560]  of it she was the one chosen to do this
[02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:53.080]  recount because hillary couldn't do it herself
[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:58.360]  she was minutes minutes before the election saying how
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:04.680]  donald trump said uh he wouldn't pledge to accept the results of the election
[02:48:04.680 --> 02:48:08.440]  because they knew they were winning oh did they know they were winning so
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:11.320]  donald trump wouldn't say yeah i'm going to accept these
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:15.320]  he's got to wait till it's over i want to see if there's been any shenanigans
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:20.760]  or bamboozling or something like that so he wasn't going to pledge to accept
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:26.360]  an election before it happens and oh my god hillary was like
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:29.160]  well this is an end of democracy as we know it
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:33.400]  this man's a lunatic not accepting the election
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:37.720]  ding there's the election and let's completely switch it over
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:41.400]  my god there must have been some kind of hacking
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:46.600]  the russians did it this one day and there we are
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:51.240]  in a recount by people not accepting a legal
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:58.760]  democratically run election right after they said how dare he not accept
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:06.200]  a legal democratically run election i i just hope it's not me and
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:09.880]  alex and some of the other people say i hope everyone
[02:49:09.880 --> 02:49:14.680]  is really soaking this in because as it is funny
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:20.440]  it is also so dangerous to have a population that
[02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:25.640]  just accepts this stuff and and takes it at face value
[02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:30.520]  forgets forgets how they lied to us and starts
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:34.280]  thinking they're telling you the truth again
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:38.440]  don't fall into that trap they've always been lying
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:42.280]  it it was blatantly obvious during this election
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:46.760]  and they will continue to do it they will just continue to lie to us
[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:53.560]  another one of my favorites is the who is that the
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:56.840]  oh there he is the environmental protection
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:50:01.960]  agency scott pruitt thank god a guy that just does not believe in global
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:05.240]  warming or climate change or whatever you want to call it
[02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:10.600]  my personal thoughts i think men here on this planet does affect the
[02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:13.480]  environment just like every other animal
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:20.760]  crawling around on this rock does we we we impact the environment in some way
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:25.160]  uh whether it's life-threatening or not
[02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:29.160]  is debatable now when they say well scientists say yes scientists say we
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:32.440]  affect the climate i agree with that do i think it's
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:37.720]  imperative we change it tomorrow no i don't
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:41.560]  uh anthony kumia in for info wars and uh we'll be

[02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:33.800]  original seven mercury uh astronauts uh has passed 95 years old was he
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:37.080]  damn that's a that's a pretty good contract
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:44.040]  i'd say 95 as senator after that he went uh he went up i think on
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:48.680]  one of the shuttle missions at some point when he was pretty um
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:52.600]  pretty old i mean the guy was right there at the beginning
[02:55:52.600 --> 02:55:59.400]  of the manned space program here in america we were fighting
[02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:04.280]  against the russians for supremacy in space
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:08.200]  and uh there it is yeah the transcontinental flight speed record
[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:12.200]  before being the first american to orbit the earth in 62 36 years later at the
[02:56:12.200 --> 02:56:15.320]  age of 77 in 1998 becoming the oldest man in
[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:18.280]  space as a member of the seven astronaut crew of the
[02:56:18.280 --> 02:56:24.680]  space shuttle discovery uh just an amazing career uh personal note
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:29.240]  i attended john h glenn high school in elwood
[02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:37.000]  my high school named after uh john glenn and um it is kind of sad to see
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:45.560]  uh because he got to see the amazing strides we made
[02:56:45.560 --> 02:56:50.920]  especially early on going from uh him as a mercury astronaut
[02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:57.000]  uh watching men walk on the moon the shuttle program uh all the
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:00.920]  the amazing strides we made in manned space flight and then
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:05.960]  at the end of his life he gets to see us having to hitchhike
[02:57:05.960 --> 02:57:12.840]  a ride with the russians on the uh ancient uh soya's
[02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:18.440]  capsules and it had to be a little disappointing for uh for the man
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:22.520]  for john glenn uh because he was one of the
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:28.440]  just a pioneer and in a time where it was just about hey we need to get this
[02:57:28.440 --> 02:57:33.640]  done and uh there's no ifs ands or buts about it
[02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:37.560]  get in the capsule and we're just gonna light it up and see what happens
[02:57:37.560 --> 02:57:45.160]  just a bunch of really brave uh men and uh i i think some of the millennials
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:49.080]  and college students should look at some of these amazing men
[02:57:49.080 --> 02:57:53.400]  like john glenn and like uh some of the people we saw
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:59.960]  at pearl harbor yesterday um honoring the soldiers that fought in world war
[02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:04.200]  two uh i don't think there's enough of that appreciation

[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:11.160]  they made and just the courage they had to
[02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:16.360]  to do things to make this country great and i think we might be seeing that
[02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:23.560]  change uh again with a president trump um i hope

[03:07:34.680 --> 03:07:38.840]  and the gut which many experts are now saying could be the biggest
[03:07:38.840 --> 03:07:43.080]  revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these studies up for yourself
[03:07:43.080 --> 03:07:47.320]  this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view
[03:07:47.320 --> 03:07:52.760]  to any optimum health regimen stock up on survival shield x2 today at info wars
[03:07:52.760 --> 03:07:59.320]  life dot com or by calling 888-253-3139
[03:07:59.320 --> 03:08:05.480]  crashing through the lies and disinformation
[03:08:05.480 --> 03:08:33.080]  it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:08:33.080 --> 03:08:37.000]  well joining us all about 45 after or so is gavin mcginnis
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:41.240]  who is just hilarious uh he's a comedian he's in major movies
[03:08:41.240 --> 03:08:44.840]  he founded uh vice which then got sold off to hbo
[03:08:44.840 --> 03:08:49.800]  and uh he is somebody exposing this incredible insanity of social justice
[03:08:49.800 --> 03:08:53.160]  warriors now since he was on a few weeks ago
[03:08:53.160 --> 03:08:55.880]  right after the election i guess almost a month ago now he was on
[03:08:55.880 --> 03:09:01.720]  about two days after it's getting so crazy it's like some form of performance
[03:09:01.720 --> 03:09:05.000]  art where a woman shows up at university dressed like
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:08.680]  trumps everyone starts screaming like body snatchers that have discovered
[03:09:08.680 --> 03:09:11.960]  you're a human uh or you know you see that
[03:09:11.960 --> 03:09:15.960]  university finds out that a professor met with trump so the students all get
[03:09:15.960 --> 03:09:20.200]  together and say fire them they're auditioning to work in some
[03:09:20.200 --> 03:09:27.400]  malice youth camp and then the level of anti white stuff
[03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:31.640]  going on that you see in the news every day with a straight face
[03:09:31.640 --> 03:09:35.640]  just saying inherently white people are bad
[03:09:35.640 --> 03:09:40.440]  it is the purest racism the world's ever seen but it's run by the elites
[03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:44.040]  and i wanted to ask gavin who was very very happy when we had him on the day
[03:09:44.040 --> 03:09:48.280]  after the election in fact he said he hadn't slept he had a beer in hand
[03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:52.280]  can't blame him and he was saying look celebrate that i
[03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:55.960]  am celebrating great things are happening but the media has only
[03:09:55.960 --> 03:10:00.280]  intensified what they were doing they're only getting more shrill
[03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:05.080]  they were caught lying about polls being run by the white house and hillary
[03:10:05.080 --> 03:10:08.040]  uh caught basically demonizing the american people
[03:10:08.040 --> 03:10:11.560]  it's in the wiki leaks they want to keep us desperate and sad and alone
[03:10:11.560 --> 03:10:17.080]  i mean this is really villainous stuff this is organized crime at the top so
[03:10:17.080 --> 03:10:21.000]  how do you reach through to their minions who are useful idiots and are
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:24.600]  basically in my view in a cult they've been brainwashed into this
[03:10:24.600 --> 03:10:28.760]  victimization cult where you don't get a better job or a better house or
[03:10:28.760 --> 03:10:31.960]  write a better book or have better friends or even go help people as a
[03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:35.800]  missionary no you just sit around bitching all
[03:10:35.800 --> 03:10:40.440]  day with your worthless college degree don't ask gavin again as a smart guy
[03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:43.400]  where he sees this going or if he agrees with me that
[03:10:43.400 --> 03:10:48.040]  they're only intensifying the insanity they get caught being the fake news
[03:10:48.040 --> 03:10:53.080]  they now list thousands of sites in some cases from unknown sources that the
[03:10:53.080 --> 03:10:56.760]  washington post runs with to say that we're fake
[03:10:56.760 --> 03:11:00.200]  google starts delisting info wars dot com
[03:11:00.200 --> 03:11:04.600]  they're having cnn msnbc attack pieces every day against us
[03:11:04.600 --> 03:11:07.800]  misrepresenting what we've said what we've done
[03:11:07.800 --> 03:11:14.120]  is this a smart tactic or is the definition of mental illness doing
[03:11:14.120 --> 03:11:17.960]  the same thing over and over again expecting different results and if this
[03:11:17.960 --> 03:11:21.160]  is a miscalculation by them which i think clearly it is
[03:11:21.160 --> 03:11:24.520]  where does it go next i mean we've clearly gavin seen the death of the
[03:11:24.520 --> 03:11:27.400]  mainstream media now obama tells rolling stone
[03:11:27.400 --> 03:11:32.360]  we're going to have state-run media uh and and the state department's going to
[03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:36.440]  run domestic info wars well sorry we're 20 years
[03:11:36.440 --> 03:11:38.920]  ahead of them gavin what do you think's happening
[03:11:38.920 --> 03:11:42.680]  i mean it is scary if i'm in a good mood if it's before lunch i laugh at them
[03:11:42.680 --> 03:11:46.040]  and watch them desperately try to catch up to reality
[03:11:46.040 --> 03:11:50.440]  if i'm in a bad mood i get a little nervous because i look at the canary in
[03:11:50.440 --> 03:11:54.840]  the coal mine in britain and canada with the bbc and the cbc
[03:11:54.840 --> 03:11:57.880]  and you see that the state-run media is effective
[03:11:57.880 --> 03:12:02.360]  i mean you talk to a canadian citizen today and they think justin trudeau
[03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:06.520]  their zoolander prime minister is doing a great job and is very intelligent
[03:12:06.520 --> 03:12:10.040]  and you talk to a lot of brits not the majority but you talk to a lot of brits
[03:12:10.040 --> 03:12:14.280]  and they go oh brexit was a catastrophe we are a racist country
[03:12:14.280 --> 03:12:18.680]  and you realize wow this propaganda really does chip away
[03:12:18.680 --> 03:12:22.360]  at someone's ability to rationally think for themselves
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:25.960]  but the beauty of the american phenomenon right now as paul joseph
[03:12:25.960 --> 03:12:29.960]  watson keeps pointing out is our numbers have gone through the roof
[03:12:29.960 --> 03:12:34.440]  we won the election we are the ones who had the right answers
[03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:38.920]  and i think the left after all these lies the liberals who are watching it
[03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:41.960]  went yeah you guys have been wrong in a lot of stuff
[03:12:41.960 --> 03:12:45.400]  i'm gonna look up and see if trump actually said that
[03:12:45.400 --> 03:12:50.600]  and once you start once you open that pandora's box there's no coming back
[03:12:50.600 --> 03:12:54.120]  it is a paradox i mean i think trump is basically only delivering
[03:12:54.120 --> 03:12:56.680]  i meant to get into it last hour but i guess here's a good place to raise it
[03:12:56.680 --> 03:13:00.280]  only at your take on this even the washington post came out last week and
[03:13:00.280 --> 03:13:03.640]  said you know m4s and right bar will be trump's biggest problem because if he
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:05.720]  doesn't 100 deliver they're gonna turn on him
[03:13:05.720 --> 03:13:08.840]  they're salivating that the new populist movement
[03:13:08.840 --> 03:13:13.080]  is gonna turn on trump no we're not we don't expect him to be perfect
[03:13:13.080 --> 03:13:17.080]  but at the same time we need to keep his feet to the fire and give him support
[03:13:17.080 --> 03:13:22.040]  so that we're his base so that this avalanche of awakening only continues
[03:13:22.040 --> 03:13:26.280]  but this whole sorrows line that trump has betrayed us
[03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:29.560]  it kind of fits into the whole social justice warrior mentality that
[03:13:29.560 --> 03:13:33.000]  we can't ever win we can't ever actually have a success
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:36.040]  when he's already brought carrier back ford's already coming back
[03:13:36.040 --> 03:13:39.720]  apple says okay we're looking at coming back the stock market's exploding
[03:13:39.720 --> 03:13:42.760]  he's standing up to the communist chinese and their arrogance i mean all i'm
[03:13:42.760 --> 03:13:46.440]  seeing is him deliver is he hiring a bunch of former insiders well who do you
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:50.040]  think knows how to run the fricking ship if i was if i'd bought a submarine
[03:13:50.040 --> 03:13:52.920]  i'd hire a submarine captain that had run the damn thing before they'd say
[03:13:52.920 --> 03:13:55.240]  well that guy wants work for this bad government
[03:13:55.240 --> 03:13:58.440]  all i care about is he does what i tell him to do now now
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:01.480]  we'll see if he goes sideways but your take on that
[03:14:01.480 --> 03:14:04.440]  well aren't they conceding by the way that info wars and bright part are
[03:14:04.440 --> 03:14:08.360]  incredibly powerful they they accidentally do this all
[03:14:08.360 --> 03:14:11.960]  the time they they go out on an attack and they end up giving you all this
[03:14:11.960 --> 03:14:14.600]  credibility and i remember you said once you said if trump
[03:14:14.600 --> 03:14:16.760]  betrays us we're going to drag him out of the white house
[03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:22.760]  by his heels now msnbc cnn all these other media sources
[03:14:22.760 --> 03:14:26.280]  they thought they had the power to do that they thought they had the power to
[03:14:26.280 --> 03:14:30.200]  build a wall around the white house and keep trump out and they failed
[03:14:30.200 --> 03:14:33.640]  and now god there's such sore losers we're just watching them
[03:14:33.640 --> 03:14:38.120]  flail and fail i mean my team is the mats we didn't get into the world series
[03:14:38.120 --> 03:14:43.080]  the idea of still bitching about it weeks after that and demanding a recount and
[03:14:43.080 --> 03:14:46.520]  demanding that the cubs you know show watch some of the
[03:14:46.520 --> 03:14:50.360]  footage or some of the pitches it's just downright embarrassing and you're
[03:14:50.360 --> 03:14:53.880]  seeing this with the entire left like look at celebrities
[03:14:53.880 --> 03:14:57.560]  captain america running around with his shirt that says
[03:14:57.560 --> 03:15:00.680]  you know dumb idiot is stan or whatever his shirt said
[03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:04.760]  just soar losing because they've all been in a bubble
[03:15:04.760 --> 03:15:08.440]  the mainstream media thought they controlled the world the celebrities
[03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:11.480]  thought people revered them and cared about their opinion and they just got
[03:15:11.480 --> 03:15:14.440]  a slap in the face and you and i get slapped in the face all
[03:15:14.440 --> 03:15:17.720]  the time so we just go and we get mad at ourselves for leaving ourselves open
[03:15:17.720 --> 03:15:22.120]  in that slap they just go ah what the hell was that
[03:15:22.120 --> 03:15:27.000]  that guy slapped police i saw a woman uh on the internet recently this fat
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:30.680]  latina woman and she was saying i just walked by a trump table and a man
[03:15:30.680 --> 03:15:34.840]  shook his fist at me and the police didn't do anything
[03:15:34.840 --> 03:15:38.280]  and you go first of all could you be more delicate
[03:15:38.280 --> 03:15:42.280]  and secondly what kind of nazi state do you want to live in
[03:15:42.280 --> 03:15:47.000]  where people get arrested for going oh well also i bet she didn't tell the
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:50.360]  rest of the story i bet she shot her mouth off at the trump person
[03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:53.400]  yes well she claims she just rolled her eyes but yeah
[03:15:53.400 --> 03:15:56.920]  she started a fight and he contained himself that's the best they can do
[03:15:56.920 --> 03:16:01.000]  and then they just start purporting all these fake hate crimes have you ever
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:04.520]  seen more badly drawn swastikas in your life they're always like backwards and
[03:16:04.520 --> 03:16:08.680]  look like a three-year-old lobotomy patient did it i mean
[03:16:08.680 --> 03:16:12.360]  i mean i'm liberals it's very simple you start with an s
[03:16:12.360 --> 03:16:15.800]  and then you do the other s lying on its back okay
[03:16:15.800 --> 03:16:19.560]  you know it's not two things going down and you don't just draw right angles
[03:16:19.560 --> 03:16:24.200]  until you're done that's not how it works oh and here's the crazy part they
[03:16:24.200 --> 03:16:28.360]  cops not that the cops are perfect but the cops in almost every case go and
[03:16:28.360 --> 03:16:31.720]  interview who first reports it and it turns out they get caught and have to
[03:16:31.720 --> 03:16:35.160]  admit it almost every black church that's burnt almost every
[03:16:35.160 --> 03:16:38.760]  uh uh you know kkk cross almost every dorm
[03:16:38.760 --> 03:16:43.560]  swastika it turns out to be liberals that just wanted attention
[03:16:43.560 --> 03:16:47.080]  they have built this narrative on racism and evil white men that's
[03:16:47.080 --> 03:16:50.120]  that's why i'm anything bad about america is because of that
[03:16:50.120 --> 03:16:55.400]  now the problem with that demand is if you don't have the supply you have to
[03:16:55.400 --> 03:16:58.680]  start conjuring it up so they say that clansmen are galloping through
[03:16:58.680 --> 03:17:01.480]  universities on their horses and throwing news is everywhere
[03:17:01.480 --> 03:17:04.440]  that isn't happening so their narrative starts to crumble
[03:17:04.440 --> 03:17:08.520]  so what do you do to maintain the narrative you censor information
[03:17:08.520 --> 03:17:12.040]  and stop the truth coming out that's what that's what all the commies did and
[03:17:12.040 --> 03:17:15.240]  it works great and the second thing you have to do is
[03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:19.160]  make fake hate crimes not enough clansmen around put on your own hood
[03:17:19.160 --> 03:17:22.280]  make sure we don't see your black hands by the way and then go gallop around
[03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:26.600]  yourself going i'm in the clan i'm ron america
[03:17:26.600 --> 03:17:29.880]  well that's my next point is even when my dad was a kid in these texas the clan
[03:17:29.880 --> 03:17:34.600]  were known as the buck toothed moron idiots the most uncool people were in
[03:17:34.600 --> 03:17:37.720]  but there were some when he was growing up now it's like
[03:17:37.720 --> 03:17:41.240]  literally white trash on welfare with one tooth
[03:17:41.240 --> 03:17:45.480]  literally they can hardly talk and and then they act like it's just this
[03:17:45.480 --> 03:17:48.920]  epidemic of kkk running around and what are their crimes
[03:17:48.920 --> 03:17:52.280]  what have they done i mean if we're gonna be so scared of a group i'd like to see
[03:17:52.280 --> 03:17:56.440]  their effects coke dealers have a much more dangerous track record
[03:17:56.440 --> 03:17:59.240]  record well they call people to go rob folks to get more money
[03:17:59.240 --> 03:18:02.840]  exactly who street race people have illegal street races
[03:18:02.840 --> 03:18:07.160]  probably have a way higher body count than the clan but for some reason
[03:18:07.160 --> 03:18:10.760]  we're focused on this thing from a hundred years ago and by the way liberals
[03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:13.400]  if you want to play this game you're working you're gonna have a lot more
[03:18:13.400 --> 03:18:16.600]  skeletons in your closet see that's the thing they always do too they go
[03:18:16.600 --> 03:18:20.680]  all right we hate the clan david duke uh trump didn't disavow david duke fast enough
[03:18:20.680 --> 03:18:24.280]  all right we can play that game let's bring up robert bird let's show hillary
[03:18:24.280 --> 03:18:28.040]  kissing robert bird oh i want anyone who's ever hurt a trans person
[03:18:28.040 --> 03:18:31.800]  to instantly go to jail okay well you're gonna have a lot of blacks and hispanics
[03:18:31.800 --> 03:18:35.880]  in jail they keep going for this bad guy and they keep getting deeper and
[03:18:35.880 --> 03:18:38.200]  deeper in the week let me ask you this what do you
[03:18:38.200 --> 03:18:41.320]  think their next level is because we're we're confident we're dominating you're
[03:18:41.320 --> 03:18:44.040]  dominating you know hearts and minds we just
[03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:47.320]  we'll love freedom classical libertarians classical liberals whatever you
[03:18:47.320 --> 03:18:50.280]  want to call us you know just pro freedom people
[03:18:50.280 --> 03:18:53.480]  but they're saying arrest climate change deniers they're saying
[03:18:53.480 --> 03:18:56.680]  arrest alex jones he's calling for violence never done it uh they're now
[03:18:56.680 --> 03:19:01.000]  misrepresenting they're saying we want a bureau of control but as you said
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  we're euphoric but at the same time they mean business they've been successful
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:08.760]  before uh what do you think's coming next you're
[03:19:08.760 --> 03:19:12.920]  right there should be trepidation we can't we can't rest on our laurels but
[03:19:12.920 --> 03:19:16.840]  we won and the trouble with previous to november 9th was
[03:19:16.840 --> 03:19:20.360]  these social justice wars would get someone fired and and by the way i'm
[03:19:20.360 --> 03:19:22.840]  not just talking about a few blue-haired freaks at a college
[03:19:22.840 --> 03:19:27.000]  i'm talking about hr and every place you've ever worked i'm talking about
[03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:29.640]  women in the fire department i'm talking about women
[03:19:29.640 --> 03:19:32.760]  getting be able to skip the pull-ups requirement for the marines
[03:19:32.760 --> 03:19:36.920]  it's everywhere this crap and the problem with the before was
[03:19:36.920 --> 03:19:41.400]  you go to the very very very top and there'll be obama saying we have to make
[03:19:41.400 --> 03:19:44.280]  nasa support muslims contribution to
[03:19:44.280 --> 03:19:47.880]  mathematics and i think the redskins should change their name
[03:19:47.880 --> 03:19:51.000]  so he would justify all their erratic behavior
[03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:57.320]  now we have a tough guy the bully the jock from school going yeah yeah
[03:19:57.320 --> 03:20:02.040]  we're not doing that and so once the top you know doesn't agree with them they
[03:20:02.040 --> 03:20:05.240]  lose their foundation and by the way watching all these mainstream media
[03:20:05.240 --> 03:20:08.360]  things flounder trying to attack us and trying to shut us down
[03:20:08.360 --> 03:20:12.920]  their numbers are pathetic their numbers you get anderson cooper having
[03:20:12.920 --> 03:20:17.560]  numbers like 200 000 people in demo i mean you and i would both consider that a
[03:20:17.560 --> 03:20:20.760]  horrible flop we're in the millions and i love it when
[03:20:20.760 --> 03:20:25.400]  when paul watson puts up his numbers and then attaches it to a rejection from a
[03:20:25.400 --> 03:20:28.040]  mainstream media source because they want our numbers
[03:20:28.040 --> 03:20:31.400]  so bad and we got these numbers by being honest which they are not
[03:20:31.400 --> 03:20:35.720]  physically capable of i remember i got into talk radio when i was 22
[03:20:35.720 --> 03:20:38.440]  on the weekend it got good right they put me on weeknights
[03:20:38.440 --> 03:20:44.680]  and after about two years i had 200 000 listeners if you count the city
[03:20:44.680 --> 03:20:47.960]  and then surrounding areas so the demo came in they said it's unbelievable
[03:20:47.960 --> 03:20:52.120]  and they said over your two hours at night you're now having 200 000 listeners
[03:20:52.120 --> 03:20:54.840]  so that was unheard of was the top ratings in the city
[03:20:54.840 --> 03:20:58.280]  then the politicos came in and tried to shut me down but that should have told
[03:20:58.280 --> 03:21:03.400]  them something then let's explain that alex jones at 22 had 200 000 listeners
[03:21:03.400 --> 03:21:07.320]  in at anyone night people in new york city folks with 18 million people or
[03:21:07.320 --> 03:21:09.400]  whatever it is there are some shows with a million
[03:21:09.400 --> 03:21:12.440]  listeners at night imagine that there are shows like that all over the
[03:21:12.440 --> 03:21:17.240]  country imagine the delusion with anderson cooper 200 000
[03:21:17.240 --> 03:21:22.040]  viewers all over the world maybe a half million it's a joke but they
[03:21:22.040 --> 03:21:26.520]  they still sit up there do you think they realize they're a total facade or
[03:21:26.520 --> 03:21:29.640]  do they are they still delusional gavin mcginnis is our guest
[03:21:29.640 --> 03:21:33.240]  that's a great question and i wonder that myself especially with celebrities
[03:21:33.240 --> 03:21:36.760]  i look at them in the newsstand going to get their starbucks and i think
[03:21:36.760 --> 03:21:40.760]  do you know how much i'm laughing at you do you know how much we're laughing at
[03:21:40.760 --> 03:21:45.400]  george cloney with his hand on his head going uh trump's not going to win we're
[03:21:45.400 --> 03:21:48.920]  not going to we're not going to be uh hatred there's not going to be divisiveness
[03:21:48.920 --> 03:21:52.440]  that's not what america's about do you know how comical you seem to be now and
[03:21:52.440 --> 03:21:56.360]  they really are they're like the monarchs all these academics
[03:21:56.360 --> 03:22:03.240]  uh oh you didn't stutter enough is he gonna get trump's uh trump's not hold on let me read my notes
[03:22:03.240 --> 03:22:06.440]  uh trump's not gonna win we don't put up with that
[03:22:06.440 --> 03:22:12.440]  racism it's so boring oh he's not gonna win i'll explain it one more time to
[03:22:12.440 --> 03:22:16.920]  you pedants but it's incredibly simple it's not gonna win and and the the
[03:22:16.920 --> 03:22:20.120]  monarchy's been shut off we've all said you want to charge us this for the
[03:22:20.120 --> 03:22:23.880]  salt tax actually you know what we're gonna have our own little barter system
[03:22:23.880 --> 03:22:26.840]  over here and we're not going to go through you and you see this with
[03:22:26.840 --> 03:22:30.200]  with youtube stars too and comedy and everything else they've just gone
[03:22:30.200 --> 03:22:34.120]  you know what you've hogged the infrastructure for so long that we built
[03:22:34.120 --> 03:22:37.560]  our own roads and we don't need you and need you anymore and they come back
[03:22:37.560 --> 03:22:41.160]  pleading and telling them no it's just so where do they go next though because
[03:22:41.160 --> 03:22:44.920]  doesn't create the perfect storm to have dying dinosaur media dying corrupt
[03:22:44.920 --> 03:22:48.840]  corporate run monopoly government uh it'll lead you know just voted to say no
[03:22:48.840 --> 03:22:52.120]  to the EU taking control of their government the first step towards
[03:22:52.120 --> 03:22:54.760]  getting out uh everywhere this is happening
[03:22:54.760 --> 03:22:58.680]  and they just again they just respond even more cultishly
[03:22:58.680 --> 03:23:02.200]  if acting like this got them towards total rejection
[03:23:02.200 --> 03:23:06.280]  what does it do then send them into overdrive i mean i've seen this happen to
[03:23:06.280 --> 03:23:10.200]  the magazine industry they they their prices were too high
[03:23:10.200 --> 03:23:14.200]  the money for ads the money got to the the information got too easy to get
[03:23:14.200 --> 03:23:18.360]  elsewhere i watched it die we watched tower records die we watched vinyl die
[03:23:18.360 --> 03:23:22.200]  we're watching mainstream media die and it is
[03:23:22.200 --> 03:23:26.520]  beautiful it's like going to the did going to see someone who killed your
[03:23:26.520 --> 03:23:29.960]  family in the death penalty i'm just watching every electrical volt
[03:23:29.960 --> 03:23:33.320]  go through their blood and just going i was at a project very past this
[03:23:33.320 --> 03:23:37.240]  christmas party and everyone there had a Nigel's
[03:23:37.240 --> 03:23:40.440]  garage grin that was ear to ear it was
[03:23:40.440 --> 03:23:44.760]  they were they were all high naturally there was a massive dance floor
[03:23:44.760 --> 03:23:48.200]  you never seen an office party with a dance floor before everyone was dancing
[03:23:48.200 --> 03:23:51.880]  James O'Keeffe was floating about six inches off the ground just
[03:23:51.880 --> 03:23:54.920]  hey man how's it going uh grab a drink enjoy yourself
[03:23:54.920 --> 03:23:59.080]  i mean it is that's another thing you go to liberal parties you go to liberal
[03:23:59.080 --> 03:24:02.920]  parties they're super uptight they're super scared everybody's in little
[03:24:02.920 --> 03:24:05.960]  nerd groups really what it is is nerds took over
[03:24:05.960 --> 03:24:09.560]  said they were cool and then told us we all had to bow down to them
[03:24:09.560 --> 03:24:12.760]  yeah i like it those parties too when there's a black guy there because they
[03:24:12.760 --> 03:24:15.560]  all mob him because they they hate that they don't have
[03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:18.920]  enough black friends and black people don't like them
[03:24:18.920 --> 03:24:22.360]  it really is a sad state of affairs seeing these people try to enjoy
[03:24:22.360 --> 03:24:25.320]  themselves and i feel like we've been trained
[03:24:25.320 --> 03:24:28.600]  with so much austerity that we enjoy the attrition
[03:24:28.600 --> 03:24:32.520]  we like a good fight so we can disagree with you you can fight we're happy to
[03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:34.600]  debate you can get in there i saw the young turks
[03:24:34.600 --> 03:24:38.520]  we're talking about you crashing their uh crashing their show and they said
[03:24:38.520 --> 03:24:43.800]  the police didn't even do anything and he was laughing
[03:24:43.800 --> 03:24:47.480]  by the way it's worth their liars for anybody that didn't know
[03:24:47.480 --> 03:24:52.360]  folks thought like it was but you know some studio behind gates and arm guards
[03:24:52.360 --> 03:24:57.000]  you know in la no it's a big air conditioned garage with plastic tarps
[03:24:57.000 --> 03:25:02.280]  put up where there's literally 300 400 uh people or groups crammed in with
[03:25:02.280 --> 03:25:05.000]  little studios they're in the middle of the hall
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:08.520]  i'm walking by their producers are waving me over i'm like in a chinese
[03:25:08.520 --> 03:25:11.080]  buffet i could eat and vomit for the rest of my life
[03:25:11.080 --> 03:25:14.360]  more media i go do like six seven interviews i'm drawing roger stone
[03:25:14.360 --> 03:25:16.760]  let's go he goes no let's do ten more down here
[03:25:16.760 --> 03:25:20.920]  i see him i go let me jump up here and say hi so i jump up and say hi because
[03:25:20.920 --> 03:25:25.080]  they'd already invited me on and they freaking flip out but then
[03:25:25.080 --> 03:25:28.360]  as soon as they see roger stone 20 feet away they go he he's trying to take
[03:25:28.360 --> 03:25:31.480]  he's trying to take over and if you look at him they go you're not coming on
[03:25:31.480 --> 03:25:34.520]  roger stone roger stones i wouldn't freaking come on your show
[03:25:34.520 --> 03:25:38.360]  i mean the point is it's like these it's like the ugly girl in school i'm not
[03:25:38.360 --> 03:25:41.240]  trying to be mean but i've noticed that what is it with ugly girls in high
[03:25:41.240 --> 03:25:44.600]  school that would always tell their ex-boyfriend that you hit on them when
[03:25:44.600 --> 03:25:48.120]  you didn't it's like some drama so so so chinker whatever
[03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:52.280]  his name is is like up there like job of the hut and then
[03:25:52.280 --> 03:25:55.880]  cusparian uh runs over and screams get out of here you
[03:25:55.880 --> 03:26:00.040]  fat effort when she's the one that basically says arrest fat shamers
[03:26:00.040 --> 03:26:03.720]  yeah and they spat on you too they were spitting on you complaining that you
[03:26:03.720 --> 03:26:07.320]  were assaulting them it really is pathetic and it really is
[03:26:07.320 --> 03:26:11.160]  fun to watch them in fact it's we call it a young turks porn
[03:26:11.160 --> 03:26:15.080]  watching that election footage of them slowly collapse when they realize
[03:26:15.080 --> 03:26:18.680]  and there's a great part too where he goes everybody was supporting her
[03:26:18.680 --> 03:26:23.640]  everybody the media jz Beyonce and he and he goes what happened you go
[03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:27.560]  clearly your idea of everybody is a nobody
[03:26:27.560 --> 03:26:30.920]  you know and you get the carrier jobs come thousand jobs
[03:26:30.920 --> 03:26:34.360]  the retort is well they're going to lose those jobs soon anyway
[03:26:34.360 --> 03:26:38.520]  and optimization is going to be replaced 85 percent of jobs
[03:26:38.520 --> 03:26:42.920]  and then he takes a call from taiwan and they go he's starting a war with china
[03:26:42.920 --> 03:26:48.280]  he went to meet the president of taiwan no he didn't and if we did start a war
[03:26:48.280 --> 03:26:50.440]  with china we would destroy them by the way
[03:26:50.440 --> 03:26:54.120]  pappy cannons run the numbers on this very beautifully long ago
[03:26:54.120 --> 03:26:57.560]  well that's right i mean china is teetering on the edge of collapse they
[03:26:57.560 --> 03:27:01.320]  have something like seven thousand riots a month that they admit
[03:27:01.320 --> 03:27:04.440]  they have the most corrupt ruling elite living in total opulence while they
[03:27:04.440 --> 03:27:07.880]  feed on their people and then did you see a few weeks ago where
[03:27:07.880 --> 03:27:11.240]  the chinese communists were in the news in the wall street journal in the
[03:27:11.240 --> 03:27:14.280]  new york times saying you better shut down fake news
[03:27:14.280 --> 03:27:18.040]  we own your debt we're now being dictated to by this
[03:27:18.040 --> 03:27:22.760]  tottering uh empire of corruption well that worked with north korea remember
[03:27:22.760 --> 03:27:26.200]  the the interview that movie with uh james franco
[03:27:26.200 --> 03:27:32.040]  they an anonymous email that someone assumed came from north korea made us
[03:27:32.040 --> 03:27:35.720]  shut down the theaters and banned the movie it was only available on demand
[03:27:35.720 --> 03:27:39.080]  that was a couple years ago and that was obama's america
[03:27:39.080 --> 03:27:42.760]  capitulation no we're not doing that anymore if we got that
[03:27:42.760 --> 03:27:45.640]  threat today and it was signed from north korea
[03:27:45.640 --> 03:27:49.400]  trump would make sure that movie was shown in every theater in the country
[03:27:49.400 --> 03:27:53.080]  and the arm guard we had arm guards there to make sure everyone was safe
[03:27:53.080 --> 03:27:56.920]  we need to defend our rights for free speech because we tried it their way we
[03:27:56.920 --> 03:28:00.760]  tried it the left way and it reeked of stalinism and that is more
[03:28:00.760 --> 03:28:03.880]  oppression and less freedom and by the way when we have less freedom
[03:28:03.880 --> 03:28:07.960]  they're the ones who get screwed first you and i can survive any environment
[03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:11.240]  it's the wimps that are going to be crushed when they institute their own

[03:28:41.800 --> 03:28:45.080]  because you have any idea how racist the caribbean is towards black people i mean
[03:28:45.080 --> 03:28:48.440]  it's more racist than we are now just and i'm not bashing the caribbean nations

[03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:43.960]  a lot of people and i make this point every time i have another talk show
[03:33:43.960 --> 03:33:48.280]  host on say why do you have other talk show host on
[03:33:48.280 --> 03:33:54.120]  another talk radio slash tv folks don't do that especially in your same genre
[03:33:54.120 --> 03:33:57.720]  because i don't look at demographics i'm not in a genre i'm trying to change the
[03:33:57.720 --> 03:34:01.880]  world cnn msnbc the new york times every time i've
[03:34:01.880 --> 03:34:05.800]  been interviewed by them they say don't you understand what you say is just
[03:34:05.800 --> 03:34:10.520]  crediting it's not in the mainstream i'm not trying to be mainstream
[03:34:10.520 --> 03:34:13.400]  where we're been over a barrel by the communist chinese and they tell us what
[03:34:13.400 --> 03:34:17.160]  movies we can have i don't want to be in the place where
[03:34:17.160 --> 03:34:20.680]  our borders totally wide open and you let people with leprosy in
[03:34:20.680 --> 03:34:25.320]  might as well at least treat them i don't want to be in your mainstream where
[03:34:25.320 --> 03:34:28.840]  the word mother and father they're teaching kindergartners is bad because
[03:34:28.840 --> 03:34:32.840]  somebody else might not have one i don't want to live in your basket case
[03:34:32.840 --> 03:34:37.160]  fruit creek cake land where foreign banks have robbed the country so they've
[03:34:37.160 --> 03:34:40.920]  got a rearguard action of just turning people into mental
[03:34:40.920 --> 03:34:44.760]  midgets basket cases so they never figured out how they were screwed over
[03:34:44.760 --> 03:34:48.360]  because that's what this is a psychological warfare
[03:34:48.360 --> 03:34:51.640]  i'm not trying to go back either the renaissance
[03:34:51.640 --> 03:34:56.520]  1776 came out of the magna carta and the guttenberg press and everything we see
[03:34:56.520 --> 03:35:01.160]  today i want more of that i want to go forward
[03:35:01.160 --> 03:35:05.320]  when they say oh the 1776 declaration of independence
[03:35:05.320 --> 03:35:09.080]  that i'm totally independent as long as i'm not hurting somebody
[03:35:09.080 --> 03:35:12.280]  no government leader no religious leader can say i've got to follow their
[03:35:12.280 --> 03:35:17.640]  cult this is this is the cutting edge of true liberalism
[03:35:17.640 --> 03:35:20.920]  but i don't use that term because the modern liberal is is like ab mcginnis
[03:35:20.920 --> 03:35:24.600]  said is like a Stalinistic freak and by the way
[03:35:24.600 --> 03:35:29.160]  when you read the communist manifesto and you read das kapital and you read
[03:35:29.160 --> 03:35:33.000]  what they set up as commas are in the soviet union over the next 50 years
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:36.920]  it is word for word political correctness
[03:35:36.920 --> 03:35:41.080]  comes from russia the stuff they did in mao's china
[03:35:41.080 --> 03:35:46.760]  they're literally following in here so gavin mcginnis is our guest but get this
[03:35:46.760 --> 03:35:50.120]  straight i'm trying to shock people with the
[03:35:50.120 --> 03:35:52.680]  truth i'm trying to shake people out of their catatonic
[03:35:52.680 --> 03:35:55.480]  state i'm trying to change the world and a lot of
[03:35:55.480 --> 03:35:58.680]  folks go well we're supposed to be patriots that sit out in the woods
[03:35:58.680 --> 03:36:02.280]  getting our guns ready for civil war not ever succeeding
[03:36:02.280 --> 03:36:07.640]  and and if trump succeeds it means he sold out liberty in the last 300 years
[03:36:07.640 --> 03:36:11.480]  keeps succeeding that's what this is all about what we're
[03:36:11.480 --> 03:36:15.400]  promoting is prosperity and choice and private property
[03:36:15.400 --> 03:36:18.040]  and do what you want as long as you don't hurt somebody
[03:36:18.040 --> 03:36:22.840]  that's really sexy compared to what these people are selling
[03:36:22.840 --> 03:36:26.600]  they're unlistable the lecturing the word control
[03:36:26.600 --> 03:36:31.400]  in pr is like a jim jones brainwashing cult
[03:36:31.400 --> 03:36:34.840]  no emotion to just soothe you into oblivion
[03:36:34.840 --> 03:36:38.680]  you have mcginnis can't stop watching him watching him on the treadmill watching
[03:36:38.680 --> 03:36:42.120]  you know uh listen to him i'm not jogging or whatever if you can call it jogging
[03:36:42.120 --> 03:36:45.640]  yeah and then my son listens to it as well and it's addictive
[03:36:45.640 --> 03:36:49.320]  because it's real it's unscripted i saw a rant you did
[03:36:49.320 --> 03:36:52.040]  a thanksgiving rant if you could repeat that here i didn't tell you i was gonna
[03:36:52.040 --> 03:36:54.440]  do this where you laid out statistics i'm well aware i'm
[03:36:54.440 --> 03:36:56.760]  they're very accurate where whites are some of the most
[03:36:56.760 --> 03:37:00.040]  un upwardly mobile people ever now a lot of them are living off
[03:37:00.040 --> 03:37:04.680]  family wealth they're total joke but then there's this cosmology that whites are
[03:37:04.680 --> 03:37:08.280]  like these braniac demons and the average white person i know
[03:37:08.280 --> 03:37:12.600]  quite frankly is the most liberal brainwashed sad excuse for a person you
[03:37:12.600 --> 03:37:15.880]  can imagine with their thumb up there you know what
[03:37:15.880 --> 03:37:19.320]  going around moral justice you know signaling
[03:37:19.320 --> 03:37:23.400]  virtue signaling to everybody like a middle patient i and then i'm hearing
[03:37:23.400 --> 03:37:27.640]  these masterminds are doing something so it's just crazy
[03:37:27.640 --> 03:37:31.080]  if you can repeat that ran to be great but separately other points you'd like to
[03:37:31.080 --> 03:37:34.280]  add the next six seven minutes we have left with gavin mcginnis of compound
[03:37:34.280 --> 03:37:38.520]  media well their whole ethos is based on power
[03:37:38.520 --> 03:37:42.680]  so we had a coach recently he was there they're playing rap music in the in the
[03:37:42.680 --> 03:37:45.720]  gym and in the change rooms and he i don't know if we can swear on your
[03:37:45.720 --> 03:37:49.160]  show but he comes in he goes i don't want to hear that music with n word this
[03:37:49.160 --> 03:37:51.400]  and n word that but he used the actual expletive
[03:37:51.400 --> 03:37:54.840]  and uh i hate that kind of music and i don't want to hear it in here
[03:37:54.840 --> 03:38:00.520]  he gets fired for using that word while saying don't use the n word
[03:38:00.520 --> 03:38:04.680]  he gets yeah so that's i mean i heard about in germany
[03:38:04.680 --> 03:38:08.200]  i heard that if you want to make stickers that have no swastika like it's
[03:38:08.200 --> 03:38:11.160]  the swastika crossed out you can't make them because you have to make the
[03:38:11.160 --> 03:38:15.000]  swastika first to cross it out so no that's illegal
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:18.120]  and so that's the kind of parameters we have that's the
[03:38:18.120 --> 03:38:21.800]  the guidelines we have to abide by but then everyone else you know every rap
[03:38:21.800 --> 03:38:25.560]  song every i had a teacher a buddy of mine he teaches troubled kids out in
[03:38:25.560 --> 03:38:28.600]  bushwick in east new york he told him he doesn't want them saying that word
[03:38:28.600 --> 03:38:31.960]  they didn't even know it was a bad word to them it's a word like the
[03:38:31.960 --> 03:38:35.240]  or something so they would change it to neighbor and ninja
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:38.360]  anyway the the reason that that we have these different rules because it's
[03:38:38.360 --> 03:38:40.760]  about power so we're the only ones that can be racist
[03:38:40.760 --> 03:38:45.080]  because we're the ones in power and you go okay so it's about power and wealth
[03:38:45.080 --> 03:38:48.040]  is that it we're the exception because we're the powerful and the wealthy
[03:38:48.040 --> 03:38:53.720]  but we're not we're number 16 down on the chart you got
[03:38:53.720 --> 03:38:59.640]  lebanese americans african africans like canyons are making more money than
[03:38:59.640 --> 03:39:01.800]  whites because they don't have chips on their
[03:39:01.800 --> 03:39:04.920]  shoulders i'll tell you it's super refreshing to actually be around a lot
[03:39:04.920 --> 03:39:07.800]  of africans from africa they're just outgoing they got business they got
[03:39:07.800 --> 03:39:10.760]  things to do they want to do things they don't have freaking chips on their
[03:39:10.760 --> 03:39:13.960]  shoulders the only thing i don't like about people from africa is
[03:39:13.960 --> 03:39:17.400]  they're racist they hate black people and they're like
[03:39:17.400 --> 03:39:21.800]  you cannot go around black people they will kill you they are dangerous crazy
[03:39:21.800 --> 03:39:24.120]  people and you go i don't like when you talk
[03:39:24.120 --> 03:39:27.400]  that way around by fellow african americans american african
[03:39:27.400 --> 03:39:31.000]  i consider it quite rude but the whole idea of you don't know what it's like
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:34.120]  to get into an elevator and see all these old ladies grab their purse because
[03:39:34.120 --> 03:39:37.960]  they think you're going to rob them and they go nor does a chinese person
[03:39:37.960 --> 03:39:41.800]  nor does a japanese person you understand that we're not at the top
[03:39:41.800 --> 03:39:45.560]  anymore and your whole paradigm of powerful people can take
[03:39:45.560 --> 03:39:49.080]  endless abuse means you have to go abuse these lebanese americans because
[03:39:49.080 --> 03:39:52.120]  they're the ones kicking ass and taking names you know in the death of the west
[03:39:52.120 --> 03:39:55.800]  pappy canon said it beautifully he said you know the west didn't start slavery
[03:39:55.800 --> 03:39:58.920]  it ended it and we had a balance sheet of zero
[03:39:58.920 --> 03:40:01.960]  after the civil war we're done with capitulation we're done with
[03:40:01.960 --> 03:40:05.720]  complaining uh hearing complaints about the past we're not
[03:40:05.720 --> 03:40:09.640]  uh unique anymore when it comes to victimhood you had a bad life the irish had
[03:40:09.640 --> 03:40:13.160]  a bad life stop whining trump is here now
[03:40:13.160 --> 03:40:17.800]  daddy's home and you have to do your homework
[03:40:17.800 --> 03:40:22.760]  now speaking of chinese americans people say oh are you anti-asians you don't
[03:40:22.760 --> 03:40:26.040]  like to comment chinese no they're oppressed by them but i was reading
[03:40:26.040 --> 03:40:31.240]  even cnn had the statistics said last year that the majority of people coming
[03:40:31.240 --> 03:40:36.120]  to the us now are not even mexican it's chinese women are now the biggest
[03:40:36.120 --> 03:40:39.800]  group and they come here and its middle class are wealthy
[03:40:39.800 --> 03:40:43.400]  chinese yeah why wouldn't you want 20 30 000 freebirth
[03:40:43.400 --> 03:40:47.080]  now you got a kid that's a u.s citizen now you've got a way to get all those
[03:40:47.080 --> 03:40:51.240]  benefits well why would rich chinese want that because that's why they're rich
[03:40:51.240 --> 03:40:55.240]  why wouldn't you come here and get a 30 000 free benefit and have your baby
[03:40:55.240 --> 03:40:58.440]  for free because we can't be racist i mean you know you're asian
[03:40:58.440 --> 03:41:02.920]  so there it is chinese flock to us to give birth to us citizens and then we
[03:41:02.920 --> 03:41:06.760]  pay for it 20 to 80 000 see i said 30 000
[03:41:06.760 --> 03:41:10.520]  being conservative that says 20 to 80 so the average is like you know 40
[03:41:10.520 --> 03:41:14.360]  or more think about this this is i mean this is
[03:41:14.360 --> 03:41:18.760]  suicide this is crazy i can't go to china and have a free baby
[03:41:18.760 --> 03:41:23.000]  no no you can't i think you need 50 grand cash to leave china and these women
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:26.280]  are getting on these planes when they're eight and a half nine months pregnant
[03:41:26.280 --> 03:41:29.480]  if anything should stop this stupid anchor baby rule
[03:41:29.480 --> 03:41:33.000]  it's the way the chinese are abusing it but you know what i was thinking about
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:36.280]  this week and i was putting up christmas decorations busting my ass
[03:41:36.280 --> 03:41:40.760]  and i've got three kids and i get from so i get trouble from far right all
[03:41:40.760 --> 03:41:45.080]  writers they go oh you work for a jew and you you race mix
[03:41:45.080 --> 03:41:48.760]  and then you get trouble from uh the far left where they go i feel sorry for
[03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:52.200]  your daughter you're such a sexist and i'm thinking in both cases these
[03:41:52.200 --> 03:41:55.400]  outliers they're not putting up christmas decorations
[03:41:55.400 --> 03:41:59.240]  and the beauty of the modern west post trump is
[03:41:59.240 --> 03:42:03.400]  i don't want to hear from you unless you're breeding western children
[03:42:03.400 --> 03:42:07.400]  unless you're putting up christmas decorations unless you can we can do the
[03:42:07.400 --> 03:42:11.640]  the hanukkah too as long as you are part of the judeo christian
[03:42:11.640 --> 03:42:15.400]  equation you're making babies and you're here with the rest of us
[03:42:15.400 --> 03:42:19.720]  participating then i want to hear from you your vote matters the rest of you on
[03:42:19.720 --> 03:42:23.640]  the fringes alone single playing video games
[03:42:23.640 --> 03:42:27.720]  not breeding not not being part of the american experience
[03:42:27.720 --> 03:42:31.320]  get the hell out of here we're done with your warning and that is both extremes
[03:42:31.320 --> 03:42:34.760]  on the political spectrum well i was about to break that down misery loves
[03:42:34.760 --> 03:42:37.880]  company and i'm sorry people demographically that are unhappy i don't
[03:42:37.880 --> 03:42:41.640]  most of them are white women they waited till 45 they didn't have kids
[03:42:41.640 --> 03:42:44.760]  they're totally freaked out and they totally
[03:42:44.760 --> 03:42:48.680]  then double down and submit to the state and and like make the state their
[03:42:48.680 --> 03:42:51.160]  husband and so if the state's more powerful
[03:42:51.160 --> 03:42:53.880]  they live vicariously through it even though the state
[03:42:53.880 --> 03:42:57.720]  overall really isn't even helping them and i think that's why they're so upset
[03:42:57.720 --> 03:43:02.200]  is they realize their god the state didn't deliver them
[03:43:02.200 --> 03:43:05.960]  their next messiah hillary rottem clinton you know stumbling around like a
[03:43:05.960 --> 03:43:08.680]  zombie and let me ask you this i live in austin
[03:43:08.680 --> 03:43:12.440]  texas it's a blue state yeah i've had major problems with republicans as well
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:15.640]  but they've been a lot more tolerant you know back when i was anti george bush
[03:43:15.640 --> 03:43:19.240]  for all the wars i was just a libertarian i have had democrats
[03:43:19.240 --> 03:43:22.680]  following out of restaurants and show me their gun and this happened in front of
[03:43:22.680 --> 03:43:24.920]  witnesses people say why don't you pull your camera out the guys showing me a
[03:43:24.920 --> 03:43:27.160]  gun and then by the time i was getting ready he
[03:43:27.160 --> 03:43:30.440]  walked around the corner people walk up and yell at me once was caught on tape
[03:43:30.440 --> 03:43:33.160]  because i was recording and go f u alex jones
[03:43:33.160 --> 03:43:37.320]  and man they see me now and then i've had
[03:43:37.320 --> 03:43:41.000]  people that are my friends who then say have a wife in one case
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:45.640]  and they say sorry uh you know we got invited to your
[03:43:45.640 --> 03:43:51.080]  holiday party or to your your your pre thanksgiving party we can't come
[03:43:51.080 --> 03:43:55.880]  because you support trump i'm like thank you don't let the door hit you on
[03:43:55.880 --> 03:44:00.280]  your ass i was just being nice but but i mean this is like a cult again
[03:44:00.280 --> 03:44:04.920]  cults always demand you break ties with anybody who isn't in the cult
[03:44:04.920 --> 03:44:07.880]  and you know what else cults do is they punish you when you leave
[03:44:07.880 --> 03:44:12.360]  and that's what we get with that movie uh the red pill where this feminist goes
[03:44:12.360 --> 03:44:15.960]  out to crush this men's rights group and mocks them for all their stupid
[03:44:15.960 --> 03:44:19.400]  arguments she debates them she goes these are actually
[03:44:19.400 --> 03:44:22.520]  really good points and then she becomes red pilled
[03:44:22.520 --> 03:44:25.880]  so now the feminists are out to get her we've got this guy julie
[03:44:25.880 --> 03:44:31.000]  s lalonde i'm starting to name names by the way we need to identify these these saboteurs
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:33.720]  they she's shutting down this theater they just shut it down in auto at the
[03:44:33.720 --> 03:44:38.200]  mayfair theater because julie has decided that she has to punish
[03:44:38.200 --> 03:44:41.960]  her fellow feminist scientologist for flying the coop
[03:44:41.960 --> 03:44:45.480]  and isn't it funny by the way that we're the fascists right we're the ones who
[03:44:45.480 --> 03:44:48.840]  have to have our home's named in a trust so they can't
[03:44:48.840 --> 03:44:51.880]  find our homes we're the ones who have to have a gun under the bed
[03:44:51.880 --> 03:44:54.680]  we're the ones who have to have a gun in another room we're the ones who are
[03:44:54.680 --> 03:44:58.120]  losing friends because we dared to violate their thought
[03:44:58.120 --> 03:45:02.120]  the thought policing and you go you sure sound like the fascist to me because
[03:45:02.120 --> 03:45:05.720]  i've never done that to anyone i don't want to know where my
[03:45:05.720 --> 03:45:07.720]  enemies live i don't want to harass their children
[03:45:07.720 --> 03:45:12.680]  but you look at dana lash's instagram feed and every picture of her kids is
[03:45:12.680 --> 03:45:16.120]  carefully hidden because these bastards are psychotic
[03:45:16.120 --> 03:45:19.240]  and by the way i don't want to have to get into all this but we now i have to have
[03:45:19.240 --> 03:45:21.800]  full-time security because these people are so serious
[03:45:21.800 --> 03:45:25.720]  they're so real they're so dedicated and then to see the left
[03:45:25.720 --> 03:45:29.960]  uh you gotta have your house and a trust whole same you know same nine yards
[03:45:29.960 --> 03:45:34.440]  you gotta cover your kids because they're so fascist they're so mentally ill
[03:45:34.440 --> 03:45:38.600]  and they're allied with the most radical forms of islam
[03:45:38.600 --> 03:45:43.320]  that throw gay people off buildings murder women sexually mutilate them
[03:45:43.320 --> 03:45:46.680]  won't let them drive cars and our government's backing
[03:45:46.680 --> 03:45:51.400]  the Saudi arabian wahhabist version worldwide and you bring it up to them
[03:45:51.400 --> 03:45:55.880]  and they scream you're an islamophobe and i go out to these anti-trump rallies
[03:45:55.880 --> 03:46:00.360]  and it's a bunch of islamicists foaming at the mouth against america
[03:46:00.360 --> 03:46:03.960]  it's incredible how much they hate this country what happened to the so-called
[03:46:03.960 --> 03:46:07.400]  left they became you know power crops absolute
[03:46:07.400 --> 03:46:11.000]  power corrupts absolutely and they became dictators they became
[03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:14.600]  fascist because they got too much power and if you want to know who's in power
[03:46:14.600 --> 03:46:18.520]  by the way a great litmus test is to see who you can't make fun of
[03:46:18.520 --> 03:46:21.960]  you want to make fun of you want to do piss christ you want to put jesus in
[03:46:21.960 --> 03:46:25.720]  urine no problem you want to make the virgin mariana elephant dung
[03:46:25.720 --> 03:46:28.920]  well we're not going to be nuts about it but you can still put that in a taxpayer
[03:46:28.920 --> 03:46:32.360]  funded museum you mock feminists while your movie's
[03:46:32.360 --> 03:46:36.040]  going to be shut down you you mock muhammad we're going to send
[03:46:36.040 --> 03:46:41.160]  guys there to shoot pamela galler because you dared to question islam
[03:46:41.160 --> 03:46:43.480]  so and by the way justice was beautifully
[03:46:43.480 --> 03:46:48.920]  made it out there in that particular instance but the moral of the story here is you guys are
[03:46:48.920 --> 03:46:54.760]  blind with power and i can prove it because i'm not allowed to make fun of you
[03:46:54.760 --> 03:46:58.440]  in the three minutes we've got left gabin first thanks for coming on the broadcast
[03:46:58.440 --> 03:47:02.280]  um so have me i'm excited to see people only getting more excited now that
[03:47:02.280 --> 03:47:05.880]  trump got in not going back to sleep like used to happen when republican
[03:47:05.880 --> 03:47:09.080]  got elected this is so exciting i think it's key
[03:47:09.080 --> 03:47:12.760]  uh to continue to support trump uh to wait and see what he actually does with
[03:47:12.760 --> 03:47:16.120]  these appointments i think if some of the appointments are bad
[03:47:16.120 --> 03:47:20.040]  yeah knowing his management style he's going to fire them if they don't carry
[03:47:20.040 --> 03:47:23.160]  out his will i think it's probably a smart strategy
[03:47:23.160 --> 03:47:26.920]  just look at how the elite are attacking him look at the demonization
[03:47:26.920 --> 03:47:30.440]  look at how he's actually delivering on americanism not globalism
[03:47:30.440 --> 03:47:33.480]  i mean this guy's light years better than hillary i don't believe in a lesser of
[03:47:33.480 --> 03:47:37.960]  two evils but in the case of trump uh i do see this vitriol
[03:47:37.960 --> 03:47:41.240]  forming out there that oh my god we got betrayed again
[03:47:41.240 --> 03:47:45.880]  when the guy's still 45 days out of office yeah it is crazy isn't it look
[03:47:45.880 --> 03:47:48.920]  we've always been fighting fascists when i was a punk rock teenager i was
[03:47:48.920 --> 03:47:51.560]  fighting nazi skinheads we've always been at war and we've
[03:47:51.560 --> 03:47:55.080]  been running the only difference in the past eight years has been we were
[03:47:55.080 --> 03:47:58.520]  getting bullets from behind us so we're out there fighting and we look back and
[03:47:58.520 --> 03:48:03.320]  we see two two we've got neocons and republicans and even some paleo
[03:48:03.320 --> 03:48:07.960]  conservatives shooting at us now trump has our back now we just
[03:48:07.960 --> 03:48:11.400]  yelled out cover me and the bullets are going in the same direction as us on
[03:48:11.400 --> 03:48:13.960]  either side and we can really focus on it so
[03:48:13.960 --> 03:48:17.720]  i had some good times gloating i'm really enjoying the revenge
[03:48:17.720 --> 03:48:21.560]  but the big picture here is we're fighting the fascists we're fighting
[03:48:21.560 --> 03:48:24.680]  the censors we're fighting the people out to extinguish our freedoms and
[03:48:24.680 --> 03:48:28.440]  someone has our back that's a totally different way to fight and it's a great
[03:48:28.440 --> 03:48:30.840]  way to win that's right and again i said this
[03:48:30.840 --> 03:48:34.520]  three weeks ago they're going to try to cut trump's base out by
[03:48:34.520 --> 03:48:36.760]  saying he's not a hundred percent delivering even before he gets into
[03:48:36.760 --> 03:48:39.560]  office and the washington post last week admitted that
[03:48:39.560 --> 03:48:42.920]  and said our strategy is to cut their base away from him
[03:48:42.920 --> 03:48:46.760]  good luck they think we're so stupid they talk to us like
[03:48:46.760 --> 03:48:50.120]  we're dumb it's their constituents that are stupid
[03:48:50.120 --> 03:48:54.280]  yeah and they use these same old games too like a tucker carlson is great his
[03:48:54.280 --> 03:48:57.880]  new show i call it tucker porn and you just watch him destroy
[03:48:57.880 --> 03:49:02.040]  liberals and they say things like they had this black guy on who was calling the
[03:49:02.040 --> 03:49:07.400]  murder of the Somali terrorist racist he goes uh yeah but aren't you a suspected
[03:49:07.400 --> 03:49:10.680]  white supremacist and you can see tucker just go
[03:49:10.680 --> 03:49:14.840]  with his face say no we're not doing that you said that word so much you
[03:49:14.840 --> 03:49:18.280]  diluted it now to nothing so all your old tropes are dead
[03:49:18.280 --> 03:49:22.200]  all your old tricks are done you're just oh i love how they'll bring the race
[03:49:22.200 --> 03:49:25.160]  thing up like they've got the ultimate weapon and they've got you like
[03:49:25.160 --> 03:49:28.120]  aren't you a white supremacist and i'm like yeah and i'm an
[03:49:28.120 --> 03:49:32.840]  easter bunny too don't you get it moron you're the one bringing race into things
[03:49:32.840 --> 03:49:36.120]  it's their death knell it really is and all the other big trick by the way is
[03:49:36.120 --> 03:49:40.040]  what about your children what if your son was blah blah blah what if someone
[03:49:40.040 --> 03:49:43.320]  what if your mother was raped or something they they try to make you
[03:49:43.320 --> 03:49:45.800]  irrational by bringing your family into it you just go
[03:49:45.800 --> 03:49:49.640]  we're not doing that anymore i'm not playing your stupid games because
[03:49:49.640 --> 03:49:53.800]  you lost you know i remember i was a young man and this girl rosanna saricino
[03:49:53.800 --> 03:49:57.160]  she dumped me and i was drunk lying asleep on the kitchen floor i couldn't get
[03:49:57.160 --> 03:50:00.760]  over it my friend pat banister just picked me up by the lapels and she goes
[03:50:00.760 --> 03:50:06.600]  he goes it's over it's over it's over he said it about 20 times and i feel
[03:50:06.600 --> 03:50:09.080]  like we just have to grab half of america and go
[03:50:09.080 --> 03:50:14.120]  you lost you lost you lost
[03:50:14.120 --> 03:50:19.080]  wake up i totally agree with you and if you look at it i'm not a person to
[03:50:19.080 --> 03:50:22.600]  gloat and rub faces in it but in their little false world it's all about them
[03:50:22.600 --> 03:50:26.680]  gloating and having triumph over us so it's important to explain you have no
[03:50:26.680 --> 03:50:29.480]  power you're a joke you're not real intellectuals

[03:54:19.640 --> 03:54:23.640]  preparations for civil unrest that we know someone the globalists have been
[03:54:23.640 --> 03:54:26.760]  trying to prepare before and during the inauguration of
[03:54:26.760 --> 03:54:30.440]  trump is it 45 days out now i need to actually check the
[03:54:30.440 --> 03:54:35.560]  calendar so we're we're watching all of that unfold
[03:54:35.560 --> 03:54:39.400]  right now 45 days my memory served correct
[03:54:39.400 --> 03:54:45.000]  also we're going to look at what the media has turned into pizza gate
[03:54:45.000 --> 03:54:48.520]  we just called it the wiki leaks and all the weird child stuff that was in
[03:54:48.520 --> 03:54:51.640]  there and law enforcement believes that there's some things going on there with
[03:54:51.640 --> 03:54:54.360]  children everybody then in in the in mainstream
[03:54:54.360 --> 03:54:58.040]  media began to focus on one little area of reddit talking about
[03:54:58.040 --> 03:55:02.040]  some pizza parlor and then we looked at it and now the
[03:55:02.040 --> 03:55:05.800]  media is turning into this big deal saying that we are the progenitors the
[03:55:05.800 --> 03:55:10.520]  creators of it's just not true and this is just standard what they do it's
[03:55:10.520 --> 03:55:13.960]  why they have no viewers why they have no listeners but i've got a lawyer coming
[03:55:13.960 --> 03:55:16.440]  on who was reportedly in the pizza place
[03:55:16.440 --> 03:55:20.600]  comet pizza yesterday when some guy came in with a gun and reportedly
[03:55:20.600 --> 03:55:23.640]  fired off the shotgun or something nobody was hurt
[03:55:23.640 --> 03:55:28.040]  and he's been on cnn saying it's my fault and you know it just gets old
[03:55:28.040 --> 03:55:31.080]  uh i'm getting criticized all over the internet for three weeks
[03:55:31.080 --> 03:55:36.840]  and i'm covering up pizza game okay and cnn knows that full well i'm not
[03:55:36.840 --> 03:55:42.200]  covering up pizza gate and i'm not behind pizza gate
[03:55:42.200 --> 03:55:46.440]  julian assange released the tens of thousands of protestant emails tens of
[03:55:46.440 --> 03:55:49.720]  thousands and a whole bunch of them have got some really creepy stuff and i'm
[03:55:49.720 --> 03:55:53.160]  like we'll be meeting you at the farmhouse we'll have three children
[03:55:53.160 --> 03:55:57.240]  six seven and eight they're very pleasing they'll be in the hot tub
[03:55:57.240 --> 03:56:01.400]  waiting for your entertainment that's not the pizza place that's some
[03:56:01.400 --> 03:56:05.480]  farmhouse out in the middle of new york i mean it's weird okay
[03:56:05.480 --> 03:56:11.320]  i spent days reading thousands of these damn things i can't do it anymore
[03:56:11.320 --> 03:56:18.760]  no one's looking into that though it's all just obsessing on ping pong pizza
[03:56:18.760 --> 03:56:23.560]  because three weeks ago cnn the new york times the washington post
[03:56:23.560 --> 03:56:28.280]  picked that as the fake news paradigm you've got all this whole world
[03:56:28.280 --> 03:56:32.760]  this whole world of the pedestrian emails and super bombshell stuff there
[03:56:32.760 --> 03:56:36.360]  paper play money laundering i mean it's bad
[03:56:36.360 --> 03:56:40.200]  how do you kill that you focus on one little spot to get everyone looking at
[03:56:40.200 --> 03:56:45.080]  ping pong pizza i don't know what's going on at ping pong pizza
[03:56:45.080 --> 03:56:48.440]  the guy may just have a really bad taste in art because let me tell you it's
[03:56:48.440 --> 03:56:52.040]  creepville and there's some creepy people maybe they just have rock guys that
[03:56:52.040 --> 03:56:55.560]  play songs and talk about their preference being children
[03:56:55.560 --> 03:56:58.680]  there's video of that i mean before all this happened i get why folks are
[03:56:58.680 --> 03:57:02.040]  flipping out and people are pissed and they've seen the child sex cover up all
[03:57:02.040 --> 03:57:06.920]  over the world i'm telling you though that i was
[03:57:06.920 --> 03:57:10.440]  told by david ike like 15 years ago that jimmy savel was slitting kids throats
[03:57:10.440 --> 03:57:13.640]  in front of prime ministers had a torture dungeon and that most of bbc at
[03:57:13.640 --> 03:57:16.840]  high levels are pedophiles i said david you can't say that on my
[03:57:16.840 --> 03:57:21.720]  show you can't be a david was proven right it all came out later
[03:57:21.720 --> 03:57:25.400]  but i can't i just i think he's incredible he believes what he's saying
[03:57:25.400 --> 03:57:28.920]  i think he's a good guy i don't know if i can buy into all of it
[03:57:28.920 --> 03:57:34.600]  the point is is that he was proven right we should get david ike back on
[03:57:34.600 --> 03:57:40.040]  all i know is this stuff's crazy so i've got a real media
[03:57:40.040 --> 03:57:43.000]  operation here and i just can't sit here
[03:57:43.000 --> 03:57:46.440]  indefinitely that's what freaks me out about some of the listeners
[03:57:46.440 --> 03:57:50.120]  is that i'm saying we don't know exactly what's going on pizza gate is real and
[03:57:50.120 --> 03:57:54.840]  that there's something weird going on but pizza gates bigger than that the fbi
[03:57:54.840 --> 03:57:58.280]  says that pizza and things is used as code words
[03:57:58.280 --> 03:58:01.480]  in pedophilia and and and trafficking kids that doesn't mean if you have a
[03:58:01.480 --> 03:58:06.680]  pizza place you're involved i ate pizza yesterday
[03:58:06.680 --> 03:58:11.960]  it doesn't mean that because something's a triangle
[03:58:11.960 --> 03:58:15.000]  in pedophilia symbols a big triangle a little triangle
[03:58:15.000 --> 03:58:18.920]  meaning big man little boy doesn't mean that somebody at a pizza place has
[03:58:18.920 --> 03:58:22.840]  triangles and that means that it's kids because that's the symbol of pizza
[03:58:22.840 --> 03:58:26.920]  but i see where all this is going we've got the lawyer who was there and
[03:58:26.920 --> 03:58:30.680]  saw the guy come in and shoot things who thinks it's all my fault joining us
[03:58:30.680 --> 03:58:33.240]  so i look forward to that and he'll be on with us
