[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:29.280]  what we see happening is powerful financial institutions globally that are able to create
[00:29.280 --> 00:36.280]  money out of thin air for themselves using communist systems of political management
[00:36.280 --> 00:44.880]  against not just the people of the United States but the world but it's not a communist conspiracy
[00:44.880 --> 00:53.760]  it is liberation theology class warfare tactics being used by crony capitalists that are best
[00:53.760 --> 01:04.160]  described as fascist I absolutely must get to all the news today there is so much of it so
[01:04.160 --> 01:10.160]  important we have former congressman Bob Barr who was way ahead in polls and was clearly going
[01:10.160 --> 01:17.880]  to win in Georgia and did not win and a tea party favorite one so for the people of Georgia I guess
[01:17.880 --> 01:24.240]  he wasn't even hardcore enough for them though he made some mistakes in Congress he is not an
[01:24.240 --> 01:32.160]  unknown quantity and fought against the NSA spying the police state gun control I mean he I'd give
[01:32.160 --> 01:38.880]  Bob Bar an A plus rating and I take the Bob Bar I've known for 17 18 years probably over the guy
[01:38.880 --> 01:45.040]  that beating but hey that's fine it just shows perception and even smell like Bob Bar got beat
[01:45.040 --> 01:52.400]  out by a tea party candidate Bob Bar is going to be joining us to talk about Ferguson the clear race
[01:52.400 --> 01:56.880]  riots the Democratic Party is trying to start and where he thinks that's going on a host of other
[01:56.880 --> 02:05.400]  issues so former congressman Bob Bar also formerly a federal prosecutor and also formerly in special
[02:05.400 --> 02:14.560]  operations of the CIA he will be joining us coming up today to also look at Obama's imperial
[02:14.560 --> 02:23.080]  presidency Barr had sworn to begin impeachment proceedings when he got into office that's why I
[02:23.080 --> 02:30.280]  was very happy you know who started impeachment last time with David Shippers who we also have
[02:30.280 --> 02:37.360]  a broadcast was Bob Bar so I wanted him to get back into Congress because I knew he would go
[02:37.360 --> 02:45.640]  after Obama you can't just leave Obama in there he's going to pull a bunch of dirty tricks the
[02:45.640 --> 02:53.600]  globalists want to go with this liberation theology racial division move and it is thoroughly
[02:53.600 --> 03:01.000]  disgusting the NFL the congressional black caucus putting the hands up big demonstrations all over
[03:01.000 --> 03:09.080]  where it's being implied that all police killed Brown and I was watching videos in New York
[03:09.080 --> 03:14.760]  other cities as people walk by the police hatefully looking at them like they were just
[03:14.760 --> 03:22.920]  total scum I'm the guy that made four films against the police state I'm the guy that constantly
[03:22.920 --> 03:29.840]  criticizes bad police you don't change it though just saying kill them all you play right into the
[03:29.840 --> 03:35.680]  globalist plan to get them into their own gang mentality and it is outrageous what's happening
[03:35.680 --> 03:42.080]  this is a huge double cross because when they're done demonizing the police they're going to play
[03:42.080 --> 03:47.440]  out scenarios of civil war and attacks on police departments that are going to legitimize the
[03:47.440 --> 03:57.320]  paramilitary use of police against the Republic and then the real civil war kicks off so this is
[03:57.320 --> 04:02.040]  an attempt as I've been saying for 15 years since I figured this out but intensely the last six
[04:02.040 --> 04:07.800]  or seven that they're going operational with the globalist building up the police state and then
[04:07.800 --> 04:12.960]  blaming the average cop for that when it's everybody's to blame and then playing a soft against
[04:12.960 --> 04:17.960]  each other in a war and I know like a parrot I covered that five six times an hour yesterday
[04:17.960 --> 04:22.560]  because I'm so worried about it I'm not going to obsess on that I'm going to mainly just look at
[04:22.560 --> 04:29.720]  the race payments going on how outrageous it is it's truly sickening and CNN Time Magazine MSNBC
[04:29.720 --> 04:35.560]  saying hey it's good to riot it's legitimate loose fair con others saying yeah go ahead and target
[04:35.560 --> 04:45.360]  whites that's crazy you like the Bosnian guy who I guarantee has no connection to slavery in this
[04:45.360 --> 04:52.560]  country barely speaks English getting his head clubbed in by hammers I mean my black folks I
[04:52.560 --> 05:01.240]  mean really fair con really he deserved to have his head clubbed in when you're out on the road
[05:01.240 --> 05:09.480]  the last place you want to be is on the road but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were

[08:17.320 --> 08:25.720]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the
[08:25.720 --> 08:39.440]  info wars.com studios it's alex jones it violates my belief in what america can be to hear young
[08:39.440 --> 08:50.400]  people feeling marginalized and distrustful even after they've done everything right that's not who
[08:50.400 --> 08:58.680]  we are that is president obama in a press conference yesterday i was monitoring all the
[08:58.680 --> 09:06.680]  major morning shows on cable and broadcast tv this morning nbc cbs cnn msnbc 100 percent
[09:06.680 --> 09:18.200]  hyping and race baiting where the only issue in america is black versus white and the people
[09:18.200 --> 09:25.520]  versus the police no discussion of the banking complex the military industrial complex the
[09:25.520 --> 09:34.880]  legal law firm complex and accounting firm complex that is tax-free above the law that has
[09:34.880 --> 09:48.560]  publicly militarized and globalized and federalized our police and are the authors of the vicious
[09:48.560 --> 09:55.840]  police tactics and policies that have been put forward they're installing the same tactics in
[09:55.840 --> 10:04.920]  europe in australia in the united states in canada someone questions the police so they choke them
[10:04.920 --> 10:11.600]  to death in the case up in new york where riots are promised if the cops aren't indicted and in
[10:11.600 --> 10:18.120]  that case i mean they really do killing they really do grabbing he's not resisting him he's
[10:18.120 --> 10:29.400]  just talking to him and four white cops killing deader than a hammer we're gonna talk about that case coming up so there are certainly these types of cases
[10:29.400 --> 10:44.680]  of eric gardener choked to death executed in my view murdered and then of course you have
[10:44.680 --> 10:57.720]  thomas kelly a white guy son of a cop i should add killed exactly the same way well his head was
[10:57.720 --> 11:02.600]  beaten in over about 15 minutes and he was choked they're not sure what exactly killed him his neck
[11:02.600 --> 11:07.400]  was broken and he just begged for daddy over and over again and let me tell you something right now
[11:08.040 --> 11:12.280]  the cops don't care if you're white you're black you're Hispanic they've been trained in their
[11:12.280 --> 11:17.480]  threat continuum that if something looks like a gun shoots you and that if you don't follow their orders
[11:17.480 --> 11:23.080]  they have a right to kill you and i've heard austin police chief on air just say look even if a
[11:23.080 --> 11:27.320]  police officer's order is not right and is illegal follow it and you won't get hurt
[11:30.360 --> 11:37.160]  and that's just a standard attitude police didn't behave like this in the past when they did there
[11:37.160 --> 11:42.680]  were serious repercussions and so there is a us against them mentality there is a marine
[11:42.680 --> 11:47.880]  corps killer mentality being put into the police where they've been trained the public is the enemy
[11:47.880 --> 11:56.520]  basically now you get the federal government run by the unesco social engineers we are under un
[11:57.080 --> 12:04.440]  social engineering under a 1961 treaty and it's expanded in other treaties that's why it's all
[12:04.440 --> 12:12.520]  standardized worldwide to have a paramilitary police force that will finally suppress dominate
[12:12.520 --> 12:24.040]  and disarm the people and so to get this party started they now want to blame it on what the
[12:24.040 --> 12:30.040]  general public can see the helicopters the checkpoints this is the face scanning cameras
[12:30.040 --> 12:38.600]  the black uniforms the swat teams the illegal checkpoints they now know that we're on the
[12:38.600 --> 12:43.400]  verge of this and so they're trying to play us off against each other as i've said over and over
[12:43.400 --> 12:54.040]  again are there real legitimate issues absolutely and in some police departments they're bucking
[12:54.040 --> 13:02.920]  the global trend and and trying to engage in real community policing and not kleptocratic
[13:02.920 --> 13:11.000]  cancer revenue generation but the real drivers are the big banking institutions and others
[13:11.000 --> 13:20.120]  that own the big five prison companies worldwide who lobby for the police state who lobby for the
[13:20.120 --> 13:27.480]  school to prison pipeline complete with the gangster rap and gangster rock and all the other
[13:27.480 --> 13:33.960]  thug music that's meant to prime the youth and use their natural rebellion as a direct pipeline
[13:33.960 --> 13:42.760]  into the system you want to be rebellious get a job young wear a sports jacket become successful
[13:42.760 --> 13:52.200]  become a family man build a community become part of the system and turn it off and there
[13:52.200 --> 13:57.000]  are a lot of people working in the system and i know governmental and corporate who are there
[13:57.560 --> 14:03.560]  quietly every day sabotaging globalist operations and that's what frustrates the globalist and
[14:03.560 --> 14:08.840]  why they want a centralized system where every bureaucrat every corporate officer
[14:08.840 --> 14:16.840]  right down to the local level must follow a worldwide standardized corporate private
[14:16.840 --> 14:23.400]  zoning program down to your speech and down to whether you can have a fireplace or what
[14:23.400 --> 14:27.720]  type of light bulbs or toilet you can have to how many children you can have and it's called
[14:27.720 --> 14:38.920]  U.N. Agenda 21 of the Treaty of 1992 that Congress did not ratify but that has been implemented
[14:39.480 --> 14:47.480]  by George Herbert Walker Williams Jefferson Clinton George W. Bush and Barack Hussein Obama
[14:51.960 --> 14:56.040]  you want to know who the enemy is it's these global treaties we didn't ratify
[14:56.040 --> 15:01.640]  that Obama is now putting us under and congress isn't even allowed to read the new trans specific
[15:01.640 --> 15:09.000]  partnership treaty wiki leaks leaked one section of it and it was total regulation and censorship
[15:09.000 --> 15:16.600]  of the web and let me tell you wiki leaks is a front for google and others who don't want governments
[15:16.600 --> 15:22.600]  to take over the web because google has been artificially intelligent for a long time and is
[15:22.600 --> 15:27.560]  now taking over the physical plane right now putting their hubs in and taking over every
[15:27.560 --> 15:33.240]  major company out there just so you know so there's a fight inside the AI system and i'm here to give
[15:33.240 --> 15:40.920]  you a newsflash government already lost that's the only reason google released one of the 30 parts
[15:40.920 --> 15:48.520]  of that partnership i've talked to folks that have been at these events as aids and it is a total
[15:48.520 --> 15:53.000]  global governance official takeover happening right now but that's a whole another subject
[15:54.600 --> 15:58.440]  so how do you divert people while all this is happening while the standard of living goes down
[15:58.440 --> 16:03.400]  for the average person while the industrialization takes place while everything is done to ensure
[16:03.400 --> 16:09.160]  we can't have meaningful jobs in a future with the media teaching school kids they're worthless
[16:09.160 --> 16:15.720]  and then humans are a cancer with the medical tyranny that the the laced poison and a needle
[16:15.720 --> 16:24.600]  vaccines what do you do while all this dismantling is taking place this siege where only the globalists
[16:24.600 --> 16:30.120]  are allowed to operate and consolidate power well how would the british control india outnumbered
[16:30.120 --> 16:39.160]  about 10 000 to one how would other empires the romans outnumbered 20 30 to one in germany and
[16:39.160 --> 16:50.520]  in uh britainia and other areas in gall in africa north africa how would they do it they would play
[16:50.520 --> 16:55.240]  the different tribes off against each other and i've talked a lot about it i recently
[16:55.240 --> 17:00.280]  reordered it because i couldn't find it a collection of essays written to the roman senate by julia
[17:00.280 --> 17:09.160]  caesar first king of the new roam they had kings before and they had their rise to power when the
[17:09.160 --> 17:15.160]  outlawed kings and then the kings came back and replaced the patrician class but i went back
[17:15.160 --> 17:20.040]  and read that book again a few weeks ago written by julia caesar pretty interesting you know to
[17:20.040 --> 17:24.200]  read what julia caesar actually wrote to read what adolf hitler wrote i've read adolf hitlers
[17:24.200 --> 17:29.880]  two bucks he didn't just write mind comp he wrote one other i forget the name when you buy those things
[17:29.880 --> 17:33.960]  at the bookstore they think you love hitler that's how dumb the public is no i want to know what he
[17:33.960 --> 17:38.760]  said you like reading a book written by jeffery dommer didn't mean i want to put people in the
[17:38.760 --> 17:46.280]  refrigerator i want to understand people like that that's why i've read das kapital and the
[17:46.280 --> 17:57.880]  communist manifesto because i want to understand the enemy but this is all a takeover plan and
[17:57.880 --> 18:02.120]  there's no doubt now they're trying to cause a race war no doubt they're trying to make this
[18:02.120 --> 18:12.680]  the issue that white people and that police are the reason the dollar c valued are the reason
[18:12.680 --> 18:18.520]  there's crime on the streets are the reason that that there's any problems and my issue is
[18:20.040 --> 18:25.400]  there is injustice a lot of police departments are above the law that's wrong but the globalist
[18:25.400 --> 18:33.640]  are triggering the injustice they helped build and are now pointing the people in a racially based
[18:33.640 --> 18:41.800]  way at whites and police in an attempt to destabilize the nation and it is a crime we've got browns
[18:41.800 --> 18:46.600]  stepfather they're talking about indicting him for saying burn down the city well i mean it's
[18:46.600 --> 18:52.680]  pretty clear what he said and if he doesn't get indicted well then next time somebody else i guess
[18:52.680 --> 18:58.680]  can say burn the city down Ferguson police chief a lot of discussion about charging brown stepfather
[18:58.680 --> 19:04.920]  with inciting riot violent educators will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law well
[19:04.920 --> 19:11.160]  you pretty much have to do that or a real civil war is going to start and and let me just give

[24:24.360 --> 24:31.320]  people stealing the lottery tickets this is legitimate because white people are inherently
[24:31.320 --> 24:36.280]  bad it doesn't matter that only a very small percentage of white people in these countries
[24:36.280 --> 24:41.320]  ancestors had slaves it doesn't matter if the guy getting clubbed to death in st lewis
[24:41.320 --> 24:47.000]  didn't even speak english hardly and uh was from bosnia with no connection to black slavery
[24:47.720 --> 24:55.240]  it's all legitimate time magazine headline when it's time to riot in defense of rioting
[24:56.120 --> 25:05.400]  seeing in same thing msnbc this is because america was founded on racism well yeah if you went to
[25:05.400 --> 25:10.440]  africa at the time blacks were selling blacks and arabs were selling blacks and whites were still
[25:10.440 --> 25:17.080]  getting sold all over the world and it uh serfdom was an abolishment areas of germania until the 1880s
[25:19.880 --> 25:27.640]  so again imagine a thousand years from now all we'll hear about if we are to survive as a culture
[25:27.640 --> 25:33.400]  is how white people a minority on the planet about seven percent of the population are the essence of
[25:33.400 --> 25:45.800]  evil but notice who's saying that time magazine cnn msnbc the white house exacerbating race baiting
[25:47.080 --> 25:52.440]  trying to get the police attacked which will then legitimize the militarization and the paramilitary
[25:52.440 --> 26:01.800]  tactics that are absolutely horrible works perfectly doesn't it congressional black caucus
[26:01.800 --> 26:11.000]  takes to the floor and puts their hands up saying don't shoot i wonder if the black congressman
[26:11.000 --> 26:14.840]  that they're doing that i wonder how many times they've been attacked by white people physically
[26:16.840 --> 26:20.600]  i mean imagine i walked around with my hands up when i saw black people oh my gosh i've probably
[26:20.600 --> 26:25.480]  been attacked by black people 15 20 times growing up in dallas i've been put in the hospital my hell
[26:25.480 --> 26:33.000]  oh you're black what's your fault you did it a black guy attacked me people like you crazy person
[26:33.000 --> 26:40.120]  i'm not the one that did that and the video i saw in new york of mainly white demonstrators white
[26:40.120 --> 26:48.120]  liberals all walking by looking into police like how dare you you pieces of filth just oh my gosh
[26:48.120 --> 26:58.280]  oh mr brown like like like they did it i am not going to take this fake guilt where i'm not for
[26:58.280 --> 27:06.280]  obama care so you call me racist oh my gosh i'm so scared oh don't worry plan parenthood the
[27:07.480 --> 27:13.160]  literal and i will use the word literally because it literally is the hitler eugenics arm in america
[27:13.160 --> 27:21.000]  it started hitler on record funding rockefeller foundation called keiserville helm institute
[27:21.000 --> 27:28.920]  in germany funded it set it up everything they are calling for marches and trying to oh because
[27:28.920 --> 27:34.520]  they love black people why doesn't lewis farrakhan come out against plan parenthood if he has i
[27:34.520 --> 27:39.800]  haven't heard it why don't you come out against what's oh yeah i mean give me a break this is
[27:39.800 --> 27:45.880]  all completely staged the articles on info wars dot com without a hint of irony plan parenthood
[27:45.880 --> 27:54.280]  joins hashtag black lives matter protest yeah the 52 percent of blacks that aren't born because of
[27:54.280 --> 28:00.920]  abortion i think they do matter but remember that's from a blonde haired blue-eyed white devil
[28:02.680 --> 28:06.520]  of course martin loser king said it's not the color of the skin it's the content of your deeds
[28:06.520 --> 28:12.360]  what you stand for not agree with that in fact they used to legitimize the transatlantic slave
[28:12.360 --> 28:17.320]  trade 500 years ago when they started outlawing slavery in some areas of europe like italy white
[28:17.320 --> 28:21.240]  slaves were being outlawed they said what are we gonna do well the Arabs are running black slaves
[28:21.240 --> 28:25.960]  all over the place but what do we say well we'll say that they're basically the sons of ham and
[28:25.960 --> 28:31.240]  have a mark of cane and that's why they're black and so they're evil and they're devils and so they
[28:31.240 --> 28:37.080]  deserve to be slaves oh and now whites are inherently evil because we're the devil and
[28:37.080 --> 28:42.360]  have the mark of cane that's what the black liberation groups teach i mean can't people come
[28:42.360 --> 28:50.360]  up with anything new but it's always an excuse to abuse somebody in africa the u n will go in
[28:50.360 --> 28:54.760]  is and get one black tribe to kill the other black tribe because they worship a different animal
[28:55.480 --> 28:58.760]  they'll get one animus group to kill another animus group because one group follows the
[28:58.760 --> 29:05.800]  lion and the other group you know follows the monitor lizard of the tortoise this is the type
[29:05.800 --> 29:11.640]  of idiocy that we're dealing with here instead of tribally being based on the ideas of freedom
[29:11.640 --> 29:15.880]  but let's go out to break with president obama we're going to come back from break with president
[29:15.880 --> 29:20.760]  obama he says youth that have tried to do everything right that's right burn buildings down
[29:20.760 --> 29:28.760]  shoot at firefighters shoot cops uh hammer people to death uh everything they're doing everything
[29:28.760 --> 29:34.040]  right and then all this does is smoke screen a case we're going to cover when we come back
[29:36.840 --> 29:42.280]  statin island police kill eric gardener with chokehold and the word is if the police don't
[29:42.280 --> 29:47.080]  get in trouble there's going to be riots uh this is a lot more legitimate case than brown
[29:47.080 --> 29:54.760]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:58.920 --> 34:05.800]  ballings i was the greatest shark they'd ever seen the captain buck the sandbar the captain
[34:05.800 --> 34:13.560]  buck the sandbar and they fell from my sleeve they threw me overboard that's the high woman bringing
[34:13.560 --> 34:22.360]  us in but i could swear you know the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry it was once said
[34:22.360 --> 34:34.040]  and providence does bend as martin luther king said towards those that want justice and freedom
[34:36.840 --> 34:43.400]  this exact quote was justice the universe bends towards justice and i've certainly found that
[34:43.400 --> 34:49.560]  in my life and there's a lot of injustice in this country a lot of bad things happening in this nation
[34:49.560 --> 34:58.840]  obviously and i would say clearly on average in many cities and areas black people are singled out
[34:58.840 --> 35:06.360]  they are pulled over more the statistics show it they do get harassed even by black cops because
[35:06.360 --> 35:15.480]  there is the stereotype promulgated by mtv and the social engineers of the thug culture but unfortunately
[35:15.480 --> 35:24.760]  there are a lot of good hard-working smart good people who get brushed with a broad brush because
[35:25.400 --> 35:30.680]  of the thug culture that has grown in the black community and is growing everywhere else as well
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.440]  i mean as a white guy if i dressed like a thug i'd be treated like one
[35:38.840 --> 35:43.800]  i saw that growing up in high school i liked dressing preppy not because i wanted to be cool
[35:43.800 --> 35:50.440]  and be a prep i just like to have slacks or blue jeans and a polo shirt felt it was easy it was quick
[35:51.320 --> 35:55.960]  and uh you know the trendy is putting on all these elaborate outfits and things great
[35:55.960 --> 35:59.880]  i just don't have time to mess with it i still comb my hair straight back in the morning
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.120]  and about 45 minutes later it dries out and sometimes when i take a shower after working
[36:04.120 --> 36:07.240]  out and i come into the office it's sticking straight up because i comb it straight back
[36:07.240 --> 36:12.120]  everybody always laughs when i walk by i go in the bathroom and barely comb my hair and i'm done
[36:12.120 --> 36:19.320]  so i wouldn't say i'm a prep because i want to be a prep it's just that's the style that i liked
[36:20.280 --> 36:25.640]  got a lot better treatment because of that and i can tell you right now no matter what color
[36:25.640 --> 36:31.240]  you are if you dress like your middle class or wealthy you get left alone so see so much of
[36:31.240 --> 36:38.440]  this isn't even skin color it's how you carry yourself it's how you act and it's what you
[36:38.440 --> 36:44.040]  stand for long term that governs in this country whether you're going to be successful or not
[36:44.040 --> 36:48.120]  now more and more you've got to be a globalist insider they're trying to get rid of the free
[36:48.120 --> 36:56.360]  market that allows anybody to become successful anybody to excel and you could still do that
[36:56.360 --> 37:01.240]  in this country we're still in the top 10 nations be able to start a business and survive we were
[37:01.240 --> 37:09.560]  number one a few decades ago but in some metrics we're behind every industrialized nation when it
[37:09.560 --> 37:16.280]  comes to freedom we still have a lot of economic freedom but when it comes to police state being
[37:16.280 --> 37:24.040]  spied on surveillance due process being run over yes we're in trouble and the foreign banks the
[37:24.040 --> 37:30.680]  multinationals the globalists are the authors they are running the show the funding the grants
[37:30.680 --> 37:36.840]  the training and I told you this Ferguson situation looked like it was staged before it happened
[37:36.840 --> 37:43.720]  two weeks before I said get ready for the media to try to stir up inner city black communities
[37:44.760 --> 37:50.520]  as a diversion after the election and then I said the last few weeks look for the UN to come out
[37:50.520 --> 37:58.280]  with their UN treaty and call for disarming the American people wait for it wait for it and the
[37:58.280 --> 38:06.200]  police state department memorandums seven two seven seven
[38:10.280 --> 38:19.640]  UN attacks US gun rights and more citing Ferguson and cops how many times the last two three weeks
[38:19.640 --> 38:23.880]  when that treaty got announced that they're going to go ahead with it December 24th is a Christmas
[38:23.880 --> 38:28.360]  present and Obama says he'll implement it as his authority without congress
[38:32.120 --> 38:38.600]  think about the magnitude of that freedom from war the united states program for general
[38:38.600 --> 38:44.680]  and complete disarmament in a peaceful world us state department memorandum to line up with
[38:44.680 --> 38:56.440]  UN UNESCO treaty and it lists the treaty numbers 1961 September office of public service bureau of
[38:56.440 --> 39:03.080]  public affairs that's an unofficial treaty we operate under and when they're done with the
[39:03.080 --> 39:12.040]  civil war in America that they planned even then I was first told about seven two seven seven
[39:12.040 --> 39:20.120]  even though it was public by general benton k parton four star general when he retired
[39:21.240 --> 39:25.080]  head of the air force at one point but before that head of air force weapons development
[39:28.600 --> 39:32.520]  parton of course exposed went to Oklahoma the day after and showed they'd blown the building up
[39:32.520 --> 39:37.160]  he'd see it on tv the blast points on the columns we even had the witnesses inside
[39:37.160 --> 39:43.720]  seeing the feds plant the bombs we know their names parton knew clinton blew that thing
[39:46.440 --> 39:50.680]  and parton talked about the briefings they got high level in the 70s and 80s
[39:51.880 --> 39:58.360]  secret briefings basically inside the military internal groups that were aware of this and
[39:58.360 --> 40:05.400]  we're trying to stop it and seven two seven seven and others are public documents where it shows
[40:05.400 --> 40:10.040]  first they disarm the american people then they disarm the police then they disarm the military
[40:10.040 --> 40:17.000]  and it is directly out of the hunger games so when i talk about this it's not from hunger games
[40:17.880 --> 40:23.800]  hunger games is imitating this where you have these regions these sectors and you've got these
[40:23.800 --> 40:30.680]  floating platforms with peacekeepers and everybody else is kept without electricity
[40:30.680 --> 40:38.920]  on the ground at starvation level what's this right here out of the detroit free press
[40:40.120 --> 40:50.440]  detroitnews.com entire detroit public lighting system is down a widespread power outage tuesday
[40:50.440 --> 40:56.440]  has caused evacuations of buildings throughout the downtown including joe lewis arena culminate young
[40:56.440 --> 41:02.840]  municipal center and frank murphy hall of justice the detroit institute of arts and some buildings
[41:02.840 --> 41:10.200]  in wane state university dte energy co scott simons said it looks like the entire detroit
[41:10.200 --> 41:13.640]  public lighting system is down they already announced three months ago they turned off the
[41:13.640 --> 41:17.240]  street lights at night affecting about a hundred buildings and it just goes on
[41:19.800 --> 41:20.760]  still out as we talk
[41:20.760 --> 41:29.720]  this is democratic party politics this is socialism this is corruption this is where
[41:29.720 --> 41:36.360]  it leads this is where it goes this is where al gore laughing at ross perot remember 1994
[41:38.040 --> 41:42.440]  ross perot you're so stupid naft and gat will raise our wages
[41:42.440 --> 41:50.440]  so they deindustrialize you and then say oh let's up the wages after they devol you the dollar
[41:53.320 --> 41:56.760]  they cut your arms off cut your legs off and then give you a wheelchair
[41:59.400 --> 42:00.920]  but that's only to break our back
[42:00.920 --> 42:11.800]  and break our will that's only to bring this system in
[42:14.600 --> 42:19.160]  when they're done the real fun starts so here it is from the united nations
[42:20.440 --> 42:25.640]  but first let's play that clip of obama saying when you do everything you're supposed to which is
[42:25.640 --> 42:32.280]  shooting police and firefighters that have done nothing burning down buildings when you've
[42:32.280 --> 42:36.040]  done everything you're supposed to beating people in the head with hammers till they die
[42:36.840 --> 42:40.920]  and and attacking reporters and getting in people's faces when you've done everything
[42:40.920 --> 42:47.080]  you're supposed to and then you don't get justice what like the grand jury was supposed to ignore
[42:47.080 --> 42:52.520]  the witnesses and who knows that they could be wrong could be a lie the point is the
[42:52.520 --> 42:58.120]  government's manipulating this to get us all fighting with each other that's the elephant marim
[42:58.120 --> 43:07.320]  here's obama it violates my belief in what america can be to hear young people
[43:10.280 --> 43:15.320]  feeling marginalized and distrustful even after they've done everything right
[43:15.320 --> 43:24.920]  uh that's not who we are and i don't think that's who the overwhelming majority of americans want
[43:24.920 --> 43:31.240]  us to be and i think there may be a convergence here where we've got outstanding law enforcement
[43:31.240 --> 43:38.280]  officials who recognize that uh times have changed and want to be responsive i know that
[43:38.280 --> 43:46.680]  uh richard buried let's just stop right there times have changed in implying that this police
[43:46.680 --> 43:54.200]  officer shot brown because you know he's old-fashioned racist or whatever
[43:57.080 --> 44:04.360]  it just goes on and on now continuing i want to go to this next clip this is dick cheney
[44:04.360 --> 44:09.000]  before i get back into the un information to give you details of that dick cheney says isis
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.480]  will nuke the us remember lindsey graham last year when we discovered the missing nukes at
[44:13.480 --> 44:19.080]  dais and they would not deny it and within hours of us reporting it it was on cbs news
[44:19.080 --> 44:25.880]  senator graham saying yes nukes will go off on the east coast from from islamic state he said from
[44:25.880 --> 44:32.120]  the radicals in syria if we don't overthrow Assad acting like he was the radicals when it's the
[44:32.120 --> 44:38.360]  opposite group and i've noticed the council on fine relations making preparations and others for
[44:39.400 --> 44:44.520]  tactical nukes to go off in dallas chicago cleveland and denver because they always love
[44:44.520 --> 44:49.080]  to tell us what they're gonna do before they do it and so back in 2003 and then again recently
[44:50.360 --> 44:53.480]  the head of the heart redmond commission that's a key council on fine relations
[44:54.360 --> 45:00.200]  super body i mean it makes the decisions the redmond commission decided to adopt the
[45:00.200 --> 45:03.560]  ran corporation plan for the police state i mean that's how powerful they are you can watch them
[45:03.560 --> 45:08.200]  discuss you can go the c span archives and watch it it's probably been 20 meetings i know of the
[45:08.200 --> 45:12.360]  heart rubbing commission on television with the council on fine relations that's how i know all
[45:12.360 --> 45:16.680]  this stuff and they just said yeah we're looking for dallas and cleveland to get hit they will be hit
[45:16.680 --> 45:21.240]  that'll be the end of your way alive that'll bring in the new world order i mean these are bizarre
[45:21.240 --> 45:27.160]  quotes we need to pull them up for you they think you're so stupid gary hart writes public letters
[45:27.160 --> 45:30.600]  in the hovegan post about how the government stages terror attacks and how great it is
[45:34.200 --> 45:42.840]  so let's go ahead and play dick cheney saying isis will nuke the us we've now got the
[45:43.720 --> 45:49.880]  terrorist the taliban organization in pakistan uh conducting a big raid on carachi airport
[45:49.880 --> 45:57.320]  why do we care about pakistan may have 50 to 100 nooks and if you combine the terrorist with the
[45:57.320 --> 46:01.240]  the ability to get their hands on a weapon of some kind then obviously we're going to see a very
[46:01.240 --> 46:07.480]  almost seems like it and maybe i'm reading into what you're saying that if we don't get real about
[46:07.480 --> 46:13.800]  the rise in the march of radical islam right now that literally we face the potential of a human
[46:13.800 --> 46:18.200]  catastrophe on a scale that we've not seen before am i reading into that i think that's an accurate
[46:18.200 --> 46:24.440]  statement i think that threat well will increase dramatically and uh as well we already know for
[46:24.440 --> 46:29.400]  example from ecu con the man who put together the pakistan nuclear program and then was under
[46:29.400 --> 46:34.120]  house arrest because he was selling stuff to the libyans uh he has said publicly in the press a
[46:34.120 --> 46:39.640]  couple of years ago that the pakistani's sold nuclear technology to the north koreans and we
[46:39.640 --> 46:43.640]  know the north koreans build a reactor for the syrians which was taken out by the israelis back
[46:43.640 --> 46:51.240]  in 07 so there's a network developing there uh where access uh to that kind of technology obviously
[46:51.240 --> 46:57.400]  becomes increasingly problematic on top of that we've got iran trying to build a new uh nuclear
[46:57.400 --> 47:02.520]  program i see that i see the world the way you do i view this as a real clear and present danger
[47:02.520 --> 47:07.160]  almost the potential for a modern day holocaust that we've not seen maybe maybe in your grandkids
[47:07.160 --> 47:12.120]  lives or my kids lives um pretty scary stuff all right it is scary it is scary all right we're
[47:12.120 --> 47:16.760]  going to come back with course he doesn't tell you that on record the bill clinton administration
[47:16.760 --> 47:23.320]  transferred all of those weapon systems to ecu con laboratories to ecu con and his laboratories
[47:25.160 --> 47:32.120]  i mean that's that's on record look it up that's all over the news 15 years ago of course
[47:33.000 --> 47:40.120]  they don't tell you that our government funded the 200 000 plus al-qaeda fighters
[47:40.120 --> 47:45.320]  to run around in a four-year jihad killing everybody that wasn't a radical bloodsucker
[47:45.320 --> 47:53.400]  inside syria they count on us being ignorant and i am so sick of it now i've told you for
[47:53.400 --> 47:57.800]  three weeks straight since they announced the treaty that ferguson and they were going to stage
[47:57.800 --> 48:03.000]  riots and that they would then call for you in control and state department random 7277 under
[48:03.000 --> 48:09.880]  un unesco law and now the story from the new american magazine is up on info wars dot com
[48:12.280 --> 48:15.960]  again is there police brutality are there racist cops out there on all sides yes
[48:15.960 --> 48:19.000]  is there stuff going on that's wrong yes i'm going to cover a case of that next segment
[48:20.840 --> 48:26.120]  but is this being played is this a scam yes yes yes yes
[48:26.120 --> 48:34.120]  yes you in a tax us gun rights and more citing ferguson and cops and then they
[48:34.120 --> 48:38.520]  quotes bancai moon i mean if you talk back to the cops in south korea folks they literally
[48:38.520 --> 48:45.080]  break your neck pointing to the killing of michael brown by police officer darin wilson
[48:45.080 --> 48:50.680]  along with subsequent unrest in ferguson and policing issues the dictator dominating united
[48:50.680 --> 48:55.240]  nations has launched another brazen assault on american us sovereignty and the gun rights of
[48:55.240 --> 49:01.880]  americans un boss bancai moon who's in south korean the global bodies human rights council
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.160]  and even the un committee against torture all took turns lambassing united states
[49:07.160 --> 49:12.600]  as an alleged stronghold of systematic racism and police brutality to fix the problems the
[49:12.600 --> 49:17.880]  un argued americans need their elected officials must submit the demands of self-styled global
[49:17.880 --> 49:23.880]  authorities close quote including some unconstitutional gun control to further restrict
[49:23.880 --> 49:28.840]  access to firearms the un goes on and you read the article they want the police restricted to
[49:28.840 --> 49:35.480]  see hey we don't want the un controlling our police our police are already under un that's why
[49:35.480 --> 49:43.560]  they act like this look at the unionization cross training okay i forget to tell people about this
[49:43.560 --> 49:49.000]  and it's such a big deal it's it's crazy we are running the biggest special ever on prison planet

[54:24.840 --> 54:31.640]  a lot of people would die and under u n a gcn 21 you're not allowed to have a fireplace or firewood
[54:31.640 --> 54:38.200]  or even a gas space feeder as a backup you just need to die so everything is about not letting
[54:38.200 --> 54:43.720]  us be independent not letting us be self-sufficient letting us be totally under their control you
[54:43.720 --> 54:49.160]  can't have a house you can't have a car you can't have a fireplace sorry africa you can't ever have

[55:01.320 --> 55:08.120]  eyeballs in it just like the republican party there's the headline epa wants to stuff out wood

[59:53.880 --> 01:00:11.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:27.800]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:44.200]  and it had to do with the stepfather of michael brown who said burn this down talking about the
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:50.280]  town of berguson leading into the events of last week last week my question is do you believe
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:57.560]  those comments should be pursued is that inciting a riot we are pursuing those comments and uh
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:01.960]  and uh there's a lot of discussion going on about that right now but i i really can't get into that
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:08.920]  at this time is there an atmosphere where maybe there's a group um in law enforcement maybe in
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:14.760]  the prosecutor's office arguing that oh we should just let it die but wouldn't that just encourage
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.800]  people in the future to act the same way and feel that they could get away with it
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:25.960]  no i i we we can't let uh let all that happened in in ferguson and delwood in the community die
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:32.440]  uh everyone who uh is responsible for taking away people's property their livelihoods their
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:37.160]  jobs their businesses uh every single one of them needs to be prosecuted to the full extent of the
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:41.080]  law what about back in august when this happened to all my colleagues and then did you use the
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:55.000]  videotape then to go after people we did yeah okay you know let's go to this other case because
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.800]  it's funny whenever you have one of these cases it doesn't become a big national story the media
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:08.840]  chose a loser like brown who is strong arming a store over cigars probably to make blunts with
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:16.600]  and thugging out and and and was it too extreme what the cop did i don't know he says he got
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.680]  assaulted and he charged him again whatever the whole world doesn't revolve around this it's like
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:27.640]  a drama cleaning bad stuff happens all the time people i probably know six seven people that have
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:32.600]  like schizophrenic brothers or sisters in fact i had it happen to some distant family not too
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:40.520]  distant but the husband of my great aunt who just died recently you know her second husband after
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:46.280]  her death the point is his daughter had schizophrenia a mental disorder and freaked out and the cops
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:50.520]  came to her house she was unarmed they shot her thinking she was armed i mean we just the whole
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.400]  world gonna be burned down because of it they're just countless examples of mentally ill people
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.840]  that i've known or people that i know that know them who get killed by the police
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:04.040]  that's another thing i wouldn't just call the cops unless you really got an emergency going on
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.600]  because you don't know what's gonna happen you don't know if you're gonna get a bad cop you
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:14.360]  don't know if you're gonna get a stupid cop a scared cop it's a dangerous situation people call the
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:21.160]  cops now if their mcdonald's cheeseburger is cold that was a real case or if their son or daughter
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:27.640]  their five-year-old's not doing what mommy says you call the police well we have the case here
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.120]  we're talking more about it later and statin island of eric gardener
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:42.600]  garner being choked to death and he's just got his hands up talking to police going hey hey hey
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:48.680]  hey i don't you know need to be arrested well well boom they're getting they slam him down and
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.160]  everybody's seen this where you're the person's not resisting the cop and they say get on the
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.000]  ground they throw you down and go ahead and jump on your back with their knees or jump on your head
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:04.040]  or knock your head in the ground i've been arrested a few times uh demonstrating and in every case but
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:09.480]  once they knocked my head into things and shoved me around and put the handcuffs on too tight and
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:16.680]  then one time went down to travis county jail the one time they didn't rough me up the state
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:21.560]  police didn't rough me up and when i get there this little short redhead guy goes oh alex jones
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:27.000]  really think you're something huh turn around and shove my face and nose enough to give me a bruise
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:33.160]  into the wall things like oh you got to do something you got to do something i mean so
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:38.360]  obviously a bunch of cowardly nobodies try to get jobs like that not everybody but there's that
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:43.240]  factor in there there's that element and i don't know why it's allowed to flourish we're all upset
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:48.440]  about that those of us that want justice but brown ain't it and it's all a big globalist

[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:08.040]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:19.000]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:29.000]  well we're joined by the head of liberty guard that's fighting against the police state nationwide
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.960]  and what the tsa is up to he's also former congressman and he's the man that introduced
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:39.960]  the impeachment articles against william jefferson clinton and of course he's former congressman
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:45.320]  bob bar uh he was way ahead in polls and i thought he was going to get in in that district in georgia
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:51.880]  there outside atlanta but he lost to the tea party candidate and it's kind of a paradox because
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:59.160]  i'm a big tea party guy but i knew that bob bar on almost every issue was an outsider he was
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:06.920]  exposing the nsa the police state uh fighting against gun control and you know trying to impeach
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:11.880]  bill clinton whenever the establishment didn't want that so whereas i think the candidate the
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:19.560]  beatings are you know fine person it shows how powerful the huge backlash was against any incumbent
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:25.720]  even though bar wasn't an incumbent had been you know out of congress for a while i wanted bar to
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:31.240]  be in there because he would start the impeachment he said boom first day now obama says he's going
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:37.720]  after the guns using un treaty not uh law he says he's shutting off more power plants he's doing
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:45.960]  naked amnesty uh he is putting our trips under more nato u n control across the board acting
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:51.560]  unilaterally and he's got two years left so i'm going to talk to bob bar first about briefly about
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:57.320]  his election to see if he concurs with what i just said and then i want to get into uh the u n saying
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:03.320]  not just the people of america need to be disarmed but the police as well see only the
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:09.160]  u n under their memorandum seven two seven seven and unesco that they believe is law even if we
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:16.200]  don't ratify it only the u n has the weapons how creepy uh is that and that's the headline
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:22.680]  info wars dot com u n attacks us gun rights and more citing ferguson and the police in my mind
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:28.760]  and we'll talk about this as well there's no doubt that they're trying to cause racial division
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:35.080]  riots in america because that's all obama's got and we'll have bob bar put on his former cia had
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:41.160]  and his former federal prosecutor had to ask where he thinks all this is going but the nfl the black
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:46.520]  caucus in congress holding up their hands don't shoot implying that white people inherently want
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:52.920]  to kill black people and that police inherently are involved in police shootings and are guilty for
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:59.320]  another cop does i mean this is race class warfare right out of the joe stalin book in my view now
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:06.120]  that's a mouthful again congressman former congressman bob bar joins us let's go through
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:12.120]  all those points sir but first off the election that the the the tea party victories uh what do
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:18.680]  you think that uh says to the establishment well first of all alex great to be great to be with
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:23.800]  you and your your listeners once again that's always uh great to uh you'll get into these
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.600]  topics with you because not only do you understand them but your listeners do as well they understand
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:33.640]  the importance of the fundamental principles that that we're talking about here it was uh it was
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:40.120]  it was a strange election uh not only in in my race uh for the eleventh district here in georgia
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:47.480]  but in a couple of other races in georgia and i noticed uh elsewhere as well any anybody who had
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:55.480]  any experience or prior service uh in washington such as i did having served as you mentioned
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:01.640]  as the first to call for uh william jefferson quentin to be impeached back in the mid and late
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:09.560]  uh 1990s um anybody who had any experience up there was labeled as my opponent labeled me
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:16.520]  as the establishment now anybody who knows me knows that uh you know i'm anything but the
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:25.560]  establishment but uh that was uh that was a truly a deciding factor um so you know it uh jack
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:31.720]  kingston for example even though jack kingston former uh you know member of the appropriations
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:37.320]  committee and and he he was and is still a city member of congress he gave up his house seat to
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:42.760]  run for the senate uh and i think uh you know he suffered the same thing even though he truly
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:48.840]  wasn't incumbent but you know there still are a lot of issues out there uh i remain just as
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:55.960]  committed to fighting for the constitution and uh you know the causes that and the principles
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:01.000]  that it represents as you do whether i'm in office or not i certainly would have would have
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:07.960]  enjoyed serving the people of america once again in the house to use the you know the
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:13.240]  background the experience that i have to fight against increases in government power and
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:20.120]  uh limitations on individual liberty i didn't get that chance this time but uh i'm continuing
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:25.560]  to fight the good fight from the private sector well sure i mean it'd be like not voting for ron paul
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:30.280]  of iran again because he'd already been in there i mean i see it as overall a positive sign that
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:37.080]  people are really fed up but it still shows that they're not overall educated though on how to in
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:45.800]  some cases uh go with somebody that has experience and you know will actually go after uh people i
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:51.160]  mean as a prosecutor i would guess that's why you had the the cojones to do that i mean it's
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:57.240]  obviously dangerous to try to impeach a sitting president especially slick willy and these new
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:02.200]  tea party people that have gotten in they better deliver or they're going to be in deep trouble
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:07.400]  with their constituents i think you're you're absolutely correct and you know i love the tea
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:13.320]  party movement i think it's very healthy we have some very strong tea party groups here in georgia
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:20.280]  i mean jenny beth martin uh the head of tea party patriots uh is here in georgia and uh got her
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:28.760]  start in politics working in uh one of my chemist bank campaigns back in 2002 but uh yeah there are
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:34.360]  there are some uh folks that are involved with the tea party that uh you know just don't quite
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:41.160]  understand that we need to use those tea party values uh in conjunction with people who know
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:47.720]  how to move them forward uh you know at the same time as we need people up in washington who who
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:54.760]  had the courage to say no uh to government spending government power at the same time we do need
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:15:01.240]  some people up there who understand how to move our constitutional agenda forward and that's what
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:07.720]  we uh we're missing in a lot of these cases well the real battle begins what do you expect obama
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:14.520]  to now do that he's a lame duck when we're seeing it unprecedented power grabs uh even
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:19.720]  crowdhammers saying it's time to impeach him uh turley who's a liberal says that he's tripled the
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.840]  abuses of bush i mean if he opens the border saw the illegals which he's already done but does an
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:31.800]  executive order if he keeps uh you know shutting off power plants uh and all these other executive
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:39.240]  actions and going after our guns i mean this is outrageous it truly is uh as bad as bill clinton
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:45.080]  was and he was uh he was a bad president there is no way of uh of sugarcoating that certainly but
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:52.680]  as bad as he was he did not have the deep-seated ideological arrogance that is at the core of
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:59.880]  barack obama bill clinton uh was very much a a narcissist i mean as long as you know he was
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:05.400]  happy and got the things that he wanted and was able to use the the perks of power whether it was
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.920]  first as the governor of arkansas to his own benefit and then as president of the united states
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:17.720]  to his own benefit he was uh he was happy uh he was a happy camper you know as long as he could
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:26.040]  have the women and and and so forth and you know travel and and and whatnot uh barack obama is a
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:34.680]  is is a very very different animal this this man is uh has more hubris and arrogance than anybody
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:42.040]  else that i've ever come across in in public life uh he truly believes that he is the chosen one
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:49.960]  that because he was elected and then reelected as president that that puts him in a plane above
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:56.360]  everybody else in the country including even members of his own party uh you talk with members
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:02.280]  uh democratic members of the house and the senate uh in private and a lot of them will say this guy
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:09.160]  this president won't even come up to the hill or get on the phone with us to work with us he simply
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:17.960]  tells us what to do because he's the president now uh as a uh a lame duck so to speak uh you know
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:24.040]  who beginning in in january when no longer have either house of the congress uh under his thumb
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:33.400]  uh he will uh simply shift gears not worry about going to harry reed for for anything uh and simply
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:40.520]  use the power that he believes he has and can wield as president quite regardless of whether
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:46.680]  or not there is any constitutional or or historic basis for what he's doing it is a we are entering
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:53.000]  alex a very dangerous period in american history with this man and that's why i wish that ron paul
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.200]  was still in congress i wish you were there as well because i don't even see any of these new
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:03.560]  people that a lot of them that are great folks challenging baner challenging uh mcconnell
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:10.040]  mean they need to be putting heat on them to go after obama and to rein him in and block him i
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:14.600]  know they follow the lawsuit but uh i mean you're the former congressman and a former federal
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:21.000]  prosecutor what is the proper move in congress right now and what would you be doing to try to
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.920]  pressure bainer and others to take that action reminding them that they have that they in the
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:34.120]  house and in the senate have a constitutional responsibility not a political responsibility
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:40.840]  but a constitutional responsibility to ensure that within the legislative branch and that
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:47.560]  includes appropriations of all funds that are used by the executive branch they have an absolute
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:55.560]  responsibility to ensure that the law uh is being followed that the intent of the legislation
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:01.400]  passed by the congresses and signed by presidents is carried out not just the letter but the intent
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:08.360]  of the law and to remind the speaker and the others in leadership positions uh in the house
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:17.000]  in the senate that there are indeed not only steps that can be taken but must be taken to stop
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.640]  the expenditure of any taxpayer dollars for actions that are unconstitutional by this president
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:31.320]  uh this notion i saw somewhere that uh one of the top republican leaders in the house was saying
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:41.080]  well we we can't stop appropriated funds from being used to for obama to carry out his illegal
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:49.480]  immigration uh orders uh because there are they use funds from fees i mean that's just absolute
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:57.640]  nonsense uh every one of the departments offices uh individual positions in the executive branch
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:06.120]  is funded through appropriations passed by law by the congress uh and no funds can be used under
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:13.000]  a constitution but as have been uh authorized and appropriated by the congress the congress
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:20.280]  absolutely can deny any funds from being used for any particular purpose such as carrying out
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:26.840]  an executive order that is unconstitutional and this notion that well we we can't do it
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:32.760]  is uh it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever elix well they also lie because i've studied i
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:39.640]  know you have as well uh under bush senior and under reagan when they did executive actions
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:45.720]  it was to line up working with congress and with laws passed in congress for the previous
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:51.880]  amnesties that were targeted and much smaller but also criticized this is the president operating
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:59.240]  against the congress just like he's doing on on carbon taxes and and co2 just like he's doing on
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:06.280]  military action just like he's doing uh on gun control i mean on so many issues he's just doing
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:13.400]  whatever he wants and and congress just sort of sits back and says thank you sir may we have another
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:21.160]  sir uh and every time they do that in other words every time the congress does nothing in the face
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:26.840]  of a president essentially thumbing his nose at the congress saying i am not going to follow a law
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:35.880]  passed by congress or i am going to follow uh a course of action uh that congress specifically
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:43.080]  did not authorize simply because i can and there's the congress to do anything every time the congress
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:49.560]  just sits back and does nothing it moves that unconstitutional ball down the field by setting
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:54.520]  a further precedent you know this is why you know one of the things that we're doing at at
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:22:01.880]  liberty guard and i appreciate you're mentioning our liberty guard dot org uh site is we have a
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:11.560]  site called lame duck dynasty dot org to highlight uh the importance right now during this lame duck
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:18.840]  session uh of the citizenry getting involved and putting pressure on the house and senate republican
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:25.400]  leaders to stop this so we're encouraging people not just to go to liberty guard dot org but to uh
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:32.040]  you know lame duck dynasty dot org and helping us out spread the word this is a very dangerous time
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:37.720]  well for those that don't know you got a liberty guard dot org you've got a lot of resources
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:44.280]  legal tips facts again we're not attacking the average tsa person but naked body scanners groping
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:49.320]  children taking our shoes off while our own government funds isis and these other radical
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:54.440]  groups i mean it's all about training us that we don't have rights it's a social engineering program
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:58.680]  plain and simple and i just really appreciate the fact that you've been
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:05.320]  leading the charge now they're trying to get you to pre check in and i'm telling you i like
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:10.840]  the idea of convenience going doing an interview with the tsa uh doing a screening process and
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:16.200]  then i don't have to go through uh all that added security the problem is is that then they'll just
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:22.200]  bring it back on everybody later once everyone gets permission to travel this is the idea they're
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.640]  introducing internal checkpoints while our borders are wide open i mean how can our borders be wide
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:34.280]  open and the border patrol be completing the smuggling process uh as one board patrol agent said
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:40.520]  shipping them in with vouchers but then i have to go through internal checkpoints uh and be you
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:46.920]  know asked questions uh with the screening programs where they do behavioral analysis on me
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:56.360]  yeah but bdo is behavior detection officers uh it's it you know it reminds me particularly the
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:03.160]  way you've accurately described it there alex of the old uh superman bizarro world uh you know
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:08.200]  where superman somehow would go into this dimension this bizarro dimension where everything is the
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:15.400]  opposite of the way it is in the real world you're absolutely correct uh here we are uh with uh not
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:22.040]  only our borders essentially wide open but you know obama and the department of homeland security
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:27.160]  people just standing on our side of the border you know waving people in please come in on the lay
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:35.720]  on the lay uh and then at the same time we're subjecting american citizens who have uh often
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:44.920]  forgotten a constant a legally recognized right to travel uh being denied that fundamental right
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:51.720]  to travel uh simply because uh government agents have decided that they're going to stop you from
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:58.920]  doing so unless you do everything that they tell you to do uh and every time they come up you've
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:05.560]  mentioned alex this uh this pre tsa precheck program they can never even make up their minds on that
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:12.280]  they start that precheck program seems to be working fairly well uh and now uh somebody
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:18.280]  was telling me the other day that well now they're making it random so you sign up for it and you go
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:25.400]  through and sometimes uh it allows you to use it sometimes it doesn't i mean the nonsense absolute
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:31.080]  utter nonsense that you have to go through in order to exercise what the u.s supreme court recognized
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:37.640]  half a century ago uh as a fundamental right and that is the right to travel is absolutely
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:43.720]  meaningless nowadays in the name of so-called security exactly you can't have the federal
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:48.920]  government stick a checkpoint in front of something and say this is the rules i mean i mean you're a
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:53.480]  lawyer you're an expert on these things explain it to me but i've said the common law it's pretty
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:26:00.040]  simple if the airline itself wanted to say once you get to our gate we're going to search you
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:04.440]  you would decide whether or not you wanted to go through that maybe one airline didn't do it one
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:09.880]  airline did but that's free market but you don't have the government itself say it's a privilege
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:15.800]  to travel that's right uh it's it's no longer a right as almost everything that the government
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:23.160]  deals with nowadays it's not right it's a privilege uh i was talking with a local reporter here in
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:30.360]  marietta georgia the other day about a local police department that is is is spending a bunch of money
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:38.600]  to get a new uh license plate uh reader system uh and you know they were saying well gee you know
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:45.160]  now uh you know we can during the holiday shopping season we can send a patrol car through a mall
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:52.440]  parking lot and within a matter of minutes identify any any cars that that might have warrants
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:27:01.560]  outstanding or are stolen uh now wait a minute uh now uh if i want to go to a church uh or i want
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:06.280]  to go to a business or i want to go to a political event or i just want to go out shopping uh i'm
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:12.760]  subject now to having my license plate read or recorded and a record made of that where you went
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:19.800]  and that's that's what it's really all about let's talk about yeah it's it's just outrageous and
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:25.880]  and most of this is being driven by the tail wagging the dog and that is federal monies federal
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:31.800]  monies are being made available uh to local police departments with this whiz bank technology
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:38.520]  so they snap it up and we'll worry about the details later trust us they say well i don't i
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:43.640]  don't trust government well we know that they've been secretly since bill clinton's days putting
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:48.760]  up in test federal license plate reading cameras on major highways now they're proliferating
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:54.760]  all over the place and uh imagine if nazi germany or the or the soviets would have had this type
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:28:00.200]  of technology what they would have done these things always get abused and as you said they've
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:04.760]  caught san francisco using them a few years ago to track where everybody goes and creating records
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.880]  now they want to use them to tax you by the mile they use them at a lot of the toll roads now it's
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:16.680]  proliferating and it destroys any level of privacy we've only got about 10 minutes left with former
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.920]  congressman bob bar then we'll open the phones up and take calls again into some other news but
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:27.400]  we've got about a minute and a half before we go to break sir shifting gears into ferguson i mean
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:34.200]  in my view this is total race spading by the democrats to change the subject uh we've got
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:39.560]  attacks on whites or hammer murders going on ferrican saying you know basically killed people
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:45.400]  the democrats president obama came out yesterday and said these youth have done nothing but done
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:50.840]  the right thing and i mean this is legitimizing a lot of criminal activity and equating it with
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:56.520]  free speech what do you think the end game is here the end game is the same as it is whether
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:06.040]  we're talking about tsa or uh the fec or uh the fec it's all about the big c control one of the
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:11.800]  other aspects of what uh what we see happening uh in in ferguson i know you i know you've looked
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:19.560]  at this notice this also alex in in addition to the uh the rampant uh criminal activity and the
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:25.160]  race spading and so forth that's been going on there uh there was a very interesting sort of
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:32.280]  little little noticed aspect of this there was a uh there was a group of folks called oath keepers
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:37.000]  oh let's talk about them when we come back private citizens i'd love to chat about that and where
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.040]  that's taken us that's right in fact the police tried to basically shut that down how dare private

[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:51.000]  Thank you once again, Alex.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:57.400]  You know, a lot of folks may not have noticed it, but surely after the start of the most
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:07.000]  recent round of riots and lawlessness and Ferguson, there were a number of individuals who appeared
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.760]  to help businesses and on rooftops to help maintain order.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:20.360]  These were private citizens, law-abiding private citizens, many of them military veterans,
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:27.080]  former law enforcement and first responders who simply have taken an oath to protect and
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:29.080]  uphold the Constitution.
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:35.040]  And they went to Ferguson, put themselves at risk, going there on their own to simply
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:40.560]  help local business and property owners protect their businesses.
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:47.120]  And rather than the police authorities in Missouri and Ferguson say, we really appreciate
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:48.120]  this.
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:49.120]  Thank you for helping us out.
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.880]  We obviously need to help.
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.600]  What did they get for their efforts?
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:57.000]  The oath keepers were told to get out of town or they'd be arrested because they didn't
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.640]  have licenses to do what they were doing.
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:08.240]  That is simply helping individual citizens and business owners protect their property.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:14.720]  This is the state of affairs in America and the Western world today.
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:22.400]  Citizens who wish to help maintain order and protect their rights and to carry out their
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:28.280]  God-given responsibility to protect themselves and their fellow citizens, that's not ultimately
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:32.760]  the job of the police, it's the job and the responsibility of individual citizens, are
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:38.080]  now being told by police, not only do we not want your help, but you're going to be arrested
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:44.240]  if you continue to help because it's against public safety.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.920]  We the police are responsible for public safety and anybody who interferes with that by trying
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:52.600]  to protect themselves and others will be arrested.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:57.400]  Well that's what's happening here and again, I've looked at the state laws in Missouri
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.400]  on this.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.680]  We've had Stuart Rose as a constitutional lawyer on the head of oath keepers on the
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:04.840]  nightly news to discuss what happened.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:09.080]  Many business owners asked them and said yes please do come, we've had some of the business
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:14.720]  owners on the gun shops and others, they wanted the oath keepers to be on top of their property
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:22.200]  and I think the police are wrong that even free association, someone says yes please
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:27.360]  be here and help protect me and it's a private citizen doing it, it's not commerce and so
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:33.040]  it's not subject to licensure and I believe that's a fraudulent unlawful order given by
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.360]  the police.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:41.880]  It clearly is, but it's typical of government Alex, we see that so many ways government
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.920]  wants to have its cake and eat it too.
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:51.240]  On the one hand the police don't want to be liable for citizens being harmed so they take
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:59.240]  the position which is actually legitimate one that people don't have a right to be protected
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:04.880]  by the police but then on the other hand they want to control people so they don't want
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:11.080]  to leave the citizenry with the tools in their hands to actually protect themselves so they
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:17.720]  say well yes we don't have a responsibility to protect you because if we did then if we
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:23.520]  didn't we could be liable for it but we're going to be the ones that decide when and
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:33.160]  how to protect you not you and that sets the whole notion of individual responsibility
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:39.000]  and individual God-given rights on its head and places absolute control which is what
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.080]  government wants in the hands of government officials.
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:49.960]  You're right and to have the police freak out and come up and say hey come down basically
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:54.160]  with your hands up you can't be on that rooftop even after they talk to the business owners
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:38:00.040]  and said no no we want them there it's that image of citizens with guns that makes the
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:04.000]  state so upset because they want the monopoly of control.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.720]  I'm sure the average cops appreciate oath keepers but at the same time the bureaucrats they
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:15.760]  want that monopoly just like in the LA riots when the police stood down because they didn't
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:22.600]  want to be called you know police brutality or abusers or racist then it was the Korean
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:27.440]  shopkeepers protecting the whole neighborhood with their shotguns and the media back during
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:32.680]  the 92 riots asked you know should they be arrested should they be allowed to not have
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:38.040]  their businesses burned down I mean the ultimate crime in the society now it's like public
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:43.960]  schools teach kids don't fight back if a bully attacks you get in a fetal position and they
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:50.920]  teach people now that have home invasions don't have a gun played dead or urinate on
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:57.000]  them I mean I'm not trying to be gross here that's what they teach I haven't heard that
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  one before I promise I'm not kidding I know it's not funny but it's so ludicrous and again
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:13.040]  it gets us back to that that that image that I keep coming back to with how strange things
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:21.000]  have begotten to the old bizarre a world hopefully hopefully Alex through you know your work
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:27.200]  and the work of other folks who really understand and are willing to put their their reputations
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:33.280]  and jobs on the line in support of the Constitution we can start to turn this around in the next
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:39.360]  couple of years but darned if we did we we've got to have new and stronger leadership in
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:46.040]  the house in the Senate and we've got to really pay attention and get involved with the with
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:54.000]  the primary the presidential primary coming up because if we if we lose again I'm not
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.240]  sure I'm not sure where we're going to wind up I mean I know I'm going to continue fighting
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:07.240]  and I know you will but we don't have a lot of time left to start turning this thing around
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.600]  so best of times worst of times scenario from my view there's never been more hardcore
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:17.920]  people of all race colors and creeds awake to the basic tenants of liberty and the problems
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:24.680]  of tyranny but of the groups not awake across the board there is just a servile decadent
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:31.760]  mindlessness in society with folks that are just do nothing but play on their iPads all
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:36.760]  day or watch television and I can't imagine where this nation will be in the future if
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:45.160]  those types of people continue to dominate society it's not a not a pretty picture that
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:52.520]  it that it conjures up what we need we we've got to have people who who understand the
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:59.760]  situation who have courage in the backbone to to protect what we have and to start turning
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:08.000]  it around because it it's not going to happen liberty is not a self-fulfilling prophecy
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.560]  we have to work at it constantly our founding our founders understood that liberty is not
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:20.560]  guaranteed we have to fight for it every single day liberty guard dot org bob bar is going
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.640]  to go in just a minute let me ask you one final question in your gut not a prediction
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:31.360]  but just a dead reckoning do you think anyone will stand up against Obama in Congress will
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:36.040]  they let him do the blanket amnesty will they let him try to use executive power against
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:42.400]  the guns and claim the UN gives him authority I mean is there anything Obama can do we were
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:47.320]  talking during the break earlier about the race baiting you said it's so incredibly obvious
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:54.240]  they don't even care I mean when I watch MSNBC it is bizarro world it is so transparent they
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:42:01.120]  are clearly villains exacerbating a problem and now they're defending rioting and time
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:06.440]  magazine I mean they're now beating people's brains out for no reason with hammers racial
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:13.440]  attacks are women being attacked at Papa John's and the media is defending it what is wrong
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:21.080]  with the establishment what is wrong with the establishment is we have had now two and
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:29.480]  three generations of the constitutional dumbing down of this country and this notion that everybody
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:35.800]  is a victim particularly if you're a person of color everybody's a victim and government
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:42.400]  will solve all of the problems for you it's come home to roost it's come a cropper it
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:48.640]  didn't happen overnight you know just as you know one would yearn for the days if we had
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:57.040]  an attorney general who was actually going to Ferguson to assist law enforcement to denounce
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:03.920]  law breakers to denounce rioters and yet we have is we have an attorney general going
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:11.080]  round to churches talking about what we need to do within government to address these problems
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:17.520]  of racial profiling racial profiling has nothing to do with what's going on in Ferguson
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:24.280]  other than from the standpoint of the racial race baiting by Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:32.480]  and and so forth and yet we have the entire institution of the federal government on the
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:39.280]  opposite side this administration is not going to change the leadership in the congress does
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:47.160]  not appear ready willing and able to change but ultimately I still am optimistic I think
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:53.680]  there are enough good people some of the new people in the house in the senate on the republican
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:44:01.760]  side that they will make sure that some things are done I'm not overly optimistic but I do
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:10.200]  believe that that that we are going to see enough people stand up so that we will start
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:14.960]  to turn this thing around and there are cases where the police clearly do beat and shoot
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:20.240]  black people you know to death for no reason and those are real cases a lot of times the
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:24.720]  police get indicted there's also cases where they kill white people the same way it's just
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:29.960]  this case is one of the worst ones to pick when all the evidence points towards brown
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:35.400]  being a thug I'm shatty's dead we're gonna talk about the case of Eric Garter here in
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:39.520]  a minute a choke to death up in New York and Staten Island and it does look like manslaughter
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:45.680]  to me but it's still different black leaders saying you know go out and kill some white
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:51.760]  people it's just wild that there are folks that really want to have a race war in this
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:56.960]  country and it just shows how hatred can be in in in every different quote group Bob
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:02.120]  Barr thank you for the time thank you very much Alex Liberty Guard dot org and I look
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:06.120]  forward to being with you again in the near future sir thanks for coming on with us well
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:12.080]  there goes Bob Barr and I want to talk about this case and then open the phones up Eric
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:20.000]  Garter in Staten Island because these are the kind of cases I see where whites black
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.680]  Hispanics you name it get killed by white cops black cops Hispanic cops it's the training
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:31.000]  and man you know four white guys just grab his black guy that didn't resisting shoving
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:38.080]  down the ground and choke him to death and I guess they must be big UFC fans but they
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:42.720]  don't know what they're doing and I just it's just that image and it's like the white
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:47.200]  state police in Oklahoma who pull over the blocking EMT who does nothing and they start
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:53.560]  choking him and he controls himself and takes it and puts his hands on his side and I just
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:46:00.320]  fits bizarre and you know I get upset watching him kill this guy because he's a human being
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:09.120]  and the cops shoving his head full power into the ground and just killing him and there
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:13.960]  are a lot of wimp types that want to be cops and I do the old days the word was you didn't
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:20.520]  hire wimps because they would end up hurting people they got something to prove you rarely
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:24.520]  see a cops that are really big or tough and you can you know form a military whatever
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:31.840]  just throwing their weight around starting fights it is usually not even so much little
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:37.160]  cops but it's the cops have got something to prove people that were a lot of times bullies
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:41.760]  in high school or whatever and they want that authority and you can just see it instantly
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:45.680]  the way a cops behaving whether they're just trying to do their job or they're on a power
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:51.120]  trip and I think it's manslaughter we're going to play the audio and video of this if you're
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:58.080]  a radio listener info wars.com forward slash show of a Staten Island police killing Eric
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:25.880]  Gardner show let's go ahead and play that clip and then we'll
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:51.240]  get started
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:54.760]  behind your back just like the Kelly Thomas they keep going put your hands
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:58.920]  behind your back as they're all sitting on him beating his brains out just go
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:02.200]  ahead and play the rest of it here it is
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:17.840]  once again Poli's beating up on people I love right here all he did was break up
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:24.080]  a fight and this what happens for breaking up a fight it's crazy
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:30.800]  they killed him good job look at that little fat cop right there
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:37.960]  oh they should throw up and so this is going on
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:49:02.200]  now the way this works is they train the cops to be killers they go out and
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.680]  kill innocent people and the system defends them and they're talking about
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.680]  riots and stuff if the police don't get indicted on this one and I think it's
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:14.280]  manslaughter I mean yeah I think they should indict the ones that did it
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:17.320]  for manslaughter and then they'll think next time or hey you don't want to be
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:23.960]  put in that position you want to be immune don't be a cop but you want to
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:28.400]  kill somebody then you need to face the consequences that means the black
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:31.400]  racists beating white people's heads in with hammers they need to get their
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:34.480]  they need to get blown away you try to run through the hammer and I'm gonna pull
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:39.880]  a gun out and shoot you not gonna play games and it's the same thing shoot at
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:46.200]  firefighters you need to get shot but just because you're in a gang of police
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:50.640]  doesn't mean you get to kill people either it's this gang mob psychology that
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:56.240]  we're dealing with oh I'm very upset but but what they're doing is they're
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:01.120]  taking real concern about this and projecting it on the brown to cause an
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:07.160]  explosion to then end up causing a distraction from what the globalists
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:11.800]  are doing in the big picture and then Obama gets to sit up there and act like
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:14.840]  he's concerned about police brutality and oh that's what he's doing for the
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:19.480]  community he's given back he's sticking with the hood he's sticking with the
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:25.000]  brothers give me a break Obama has got Al Qaeda forces murdering every black
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.480]  person they can find in Libya he's got them murdering non radical Muslims
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:33.480]  everywhere hundreds of thousands of people it's a murder machine Planned
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:38.680]  Parenthood though stands with brown oh because they because they're upset they
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:44.560]  couldn't kill him when he was in his mommy it's just a total sick joke and
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:49.520]  having race war on white people isn't going to stop police being given this

[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:51.000]  Indiana you're on the air Alex how you doing good brother yeah my life in the
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:58.400]  sand was drawn a long time ago when they started to attack my family and my
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:04.440]  loved ones through the poisonous food and other products that are out there
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:08.280]  every single day that everybody takes and they don't realize that it's fully
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:16.440]  killing them we've consolidated our family we're we have multiple acres on
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:21.120]  one mortgage and there's six incomes that are working on one mortgage and
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:26.840]  we're freeing ourselves through the love of our family I wanted to give you one
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:30.880]  anecdotal incident that happened to me when I was child when I was in eighth
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:36.720]  grade I have never been vaccinated and in school they brought me to the
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:41.400]  principal's office with all the principals and had nurse may ask me why
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:46.160]  haven't been vaccinated and I was prompted by my parent to say it's a
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:51.280]  religious objection that's the one thing that they cannot argue with in in
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:55.400]  public school or anything public it's not argue with your relatives they all
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:59.640]  called you in like you've done something wrong with peer pressure when
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:04.240]  there's not even a law there's just a policy that they say you need to get an
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:09.840]  exemption for to create the illusion of a crime being committed they'll even kick
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:13.880]  you out of school fraudulently and then trigger truancy charges that are thrown
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:20.040]  out if you know your rights but it shows the collective criminal fraud going on
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:24.440]  there is a conscientious objector there's a medical exemption and there's a
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:29.200]  religious exemption but their exemptions to a non-law do you understand that I
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:35.120]  absolutely understand that it it's our only defense right now I tell people
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:39.160]  every single day it is not the law of people come to me they come to me and
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:43.680]  say my my I don't know if I want to back say my child or not I'm afraid that I
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:46.760]  won't be able to go into public school because it's against the law the first
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:51.160]  thing I tell them I say it is not against the law it's not against this
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:53.840]  shows how the people perish for lack of knowledge now they can keep a fraud
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:58.520]  going and and the school knows they're involved in a fraud because federal
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:04.000]  funds and state funds are tied more than test scores they're tied to
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:09.920]  vaccination because vaccination is the big conspiracy so so finish the story
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:14.560]  the I mean the principal the nurse they're there what they say to you and
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:18.120]  that was the second prompt to my parents came to the only few things they
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:22.120]  told me to say they began to religion and when they ask you what religion you
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:26.280]  are you tell them that they cannot ask you that that question it's against the
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:30.920]  law if you're protected by the Constitution so how did it end how did it
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:36.600]  have to be indicted by your religion well sorry I mean I mean it's beyond that
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:40.360]  but you know that is a whole smart thing to do is what the illegals do or so
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:43.640]  they don't pay taxes and her brother law but get a bunch of folks together on a
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:47.000]  property like family used to do and have grandparents everybody their
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:52.560]  neighbor's cousins and then pool your resources and live like kings and start
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:55.400]  a black market I mean that's the way to go now it's only to survive for many
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:05:02.120]  people the government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of

[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:58.640]  betting on hyping the brown shooting and they're legitimizing rioting and
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:02.680]  racial attacks I guess believing turning the American people against each other
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:09.960]  will distract us while the globalist rob us seven ways to Sunday UN has now
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:15.520]  attacked US gun rights and more citing Ferguson says they have their new UN
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:19.880]  tree to go after us this is Detroit's entire electrical grid basically goes
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:25.320]  down that's some of the news I've already hit there is a ton of news that I
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:32.120]  have not gotten to yet that I will be covering on a host of issues the
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:37.320]  situation with Russia is intensifying FEMA kept a close eye on Ferguson during
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:42.680]  August protest when it was first going on that's just some of what's coming up
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:46.880]  but I wanted to play the first Lewis Farrakhan clip because there's a new
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:55.120]  clip in a story we have on info wars.com with the latest comments by
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:10:00.120]  Farrakhan some of the most radical he's ever issued let's go ahead and go to
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:09.120]  that first clip from last week or as long as they kill us and go to Wendy's
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:17.440]  and have a burger and go to sleep they're gonna keep killing us but when we
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:32.600]  die and they die then soon we go sit at a table and talk about retired we want
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:45.680]  some of this earth but we'll tear this damn country of us salam aleikum I mean
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:52.800]  do you think the insurance companies care of some stuff gets torn up Obama with
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:57.480]  the Republicans with the insurance companies wrote Obamacare to rob every
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:01.120]  poor person in America and fleece the rest of the middle class and set up
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:06.080]  death panels for heaven's sakes I mean come on Farrakhan let's hear you talk
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:10.880]  about abortion let's hear you talk about what's in the GMO crops I know you do
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:16.280]  some let's hear you get into real issues that are silent creeping death for
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:22.760]  everybody fluoridation of water I know the final call newspaper I've read it
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:31.720]  before has even quoted some of the our reports I mean that's good stuff to
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:36.080]  strengthen the black community or any other community but what Farrakhan's
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:41.960]  doing now just randomly saying you know if whites die this will stop happening
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:47.160]  oh it won't it'll kick off a race war and a bunch of people will die and create
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:51.720]  racism and division but I know the originally nation of Islam was black
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:56.400]  only and wanted its own country and that's still there that's separate as
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:59.800]  idea that's why a lot of the white supremacist groups like the nation of
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:03.720]  Islam because they're like yes whites need to be separate and blacks need to
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:07.800]  be separate look people can do whatever they want in their own lives okay I
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:14.280]  support freedom but I don't want black people to be hurt and I don't want white
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:18.000]  people to be hurt besides most people in this country or aren't even one thing
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:24.320]  or the other anymore it's just pure manipulation and I guess it's easy for
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:28.360]  Farrakhan's base to get up there and talk like that but there's a new clip out
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:35.480]  from Farrakhan now let's go ahead and go to this club you may not want to fight
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:50.840]  but you better get ready teach your baby how to throw the bottle if they can't
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:13:06.280]  bite we're going to die anyway
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:19.560]  let's die for something guys we find it where Farrakhan talks about me in one
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:23.400]  of those clips he's talked about me a couple times it's just it's something
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:29.000]  like Alec Lewis Farrakhan talks about Alex Jones and he's real excited maybe
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:33.320]  he's not a plant maybe he really thinks violence good he gets real excited when
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:38.880]  I blow up at Pierce Morgan and say if you try to take our firearms 1776 will
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:41.600]  commence again well that's how it started to begin with and it will be a
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:46.040]  civil war then any cop carrying out orders to disarm the public in a general
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:50.840]  disarmament is unconstitutional is an act of domination and people can
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:54.160]  legitimately resist that and the police aren't stupid they're not going to try
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:58.200]  it they got federal squads trying in California right now but I don't count
[02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:05.440]  that as the US it isn't gonna fly and I mean I wonder if Farrakhan's got
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:09.120]  cancer again or something or because he looks crazy when he's talking about
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:13.440]  everybody's gonna die anyways and it gets that crazy look in his eye so you
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:18.040]  about to start passing Kool-Aid out or something I mean do you have any idea
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:22.520]  what would happen if intercity people period poor whites blacks Hispanics
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:27.720]  whatever tried to go out and attack rural areas I mean do you have any idea
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:31.800]  how trained with guns are people aren't real areas and how many guns there are
[02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:36.440]  I mean do you really Farrakhan think white people in the countryside are
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:43.080]  scared if the feds come they're ready to kill if a mob of black people come
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:46.040]  they're ready to kill they don't care what color you are they're not looking
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:50.920]  for trouble either I mean that's the most ridiculous asinine statement about a
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:58.600]  race war with white people all you're gonna have is the police mowing black
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:02.400]  people down they are gonna let this thing get out of hand I'm telling you
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:06.080]  they may actually pull the trigger on this and start a big stinking race war
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:12.040]  that is completely pointless for the people but works like a charm for the
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:16.080]  establishment and then afterwards they'll bring the UN in and restore order
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:19.040]  this is how they have their comments revolution and they kick it off with
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:24.040]  race riots in America and they use the disdain for in many cases the out of
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:28.200]  control police you know what about the white homeless unarmed man you know
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:35.800]  booker key earlier this year I forget his name I go maybe you guys print me an
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:39.520]  article on it we played the video probably 20 times here and the cops are
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:43.120]  shooting on boo yeah right yeah and then they shoot him some more and say
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:49.560]  don't you know don't resist as he's dead like that makes it okay don't resist it
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:53.200]  be like going to a gravesite shooting the shooting the ground and going don't
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:58.600]  resist me the you're resisting me you were buried in 1875 boom don't resist me
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:02.800]  and they let the dog come over and bite on him video shows Albuquerque police
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:08.480]  killing homeless man just one more in a long line James Boyd where is Lewis
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:12.880]  Farrakhan here let me tell you there was video like this of them shooting a black
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:18.160]  homeless guy be up in arms I mean I just don't all those cops should be
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:21.880]  indicted and they haven't been and then we get the squad car video of the leader
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:26.800]  cop who got fired off the state police driving up on a squad car talking to his
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:32.440]  buddies on the radio knowing I can't wait to blow this guy's bleepers off I'm
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:40.360]  gonna kill him and they're at they come over and they go why just just just I
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:46.360]  can't wait to kill somebody and that's what a Hispanic cop wants to kill a
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:49.040]  homeless guy I think you wanted to kill him because he was white he just was
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:53.080]  crazy it's like the cops we see all the time every week walking into convenience
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:56.080]  stores they'll just pull a gun out put it somebody's head just to scare the hell
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:17:03.640]  out of them I'm going to shoot him in the bleeper says cop before executing
[02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:08.720]  camper an Albuquerque police officer who killed a mentally ill homeless man last
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:13.840]  March expresses desire to shoot him in the genitalia new dash cam footage
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:18.640]  reveals let's scroll down and then the article goes through it all the video
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:24.800]  obtained by KOB for news details the conversation between APD officer Keith
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:28.920]  Sandy and another case one of the guys was Hispanic I forget I guess he's white
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:32.440]  office wrote before the fatal shooting of James Boyd during the
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:36.160]  conversation Sandy can be heard discussing his desire to shoot Boyd who
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:44.080]  he refers to as a f-ing lunatic in the bleeping with a shotgun and he got to
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:47.680]  alright here's the Farrakhan clip and then I'll go to break and come back and
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:55.280]  go to Ramon and Joey and Ralph and John and Dan everybody else but but here's
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:59.360]  Farrakhan just put it in context how excited he gets whenever there's a
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:03.320]  discussion a revolution so maybe he's for real maybe he really thinks it's
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:08.200]  going to be great because he looks starry eyed in that last video clip you
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:11.680]  can't see it on radio it's on info wars.com when he goes because we're
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:18.560]  all gonna we're all gonna die and he looks crazy let's go to the club and I
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:30.360]  saw a Mr. Alex Jones on television recently with Pierce Morgan of CNN and
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:45.320]  he said before we allow you to take our guns from us 1776 will play out again
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:53.920]  we intend to return America not to a democracy you are lying to the American
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:19:00.320]  people you're robbing them of democracy this is not a democracy this is
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:11.480]  an oligarchy that is leading America into fascism I mean it's just what is
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:17.320]  going on here was Farrakhan has like 10 million followers it's estimated and
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:23.120]  he's talking about go out and kill the white people and then they will stop
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:32.880]  killing us I don't want to kill anybody and he's being allowed to do it I mean
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:38.000]  I made vague comments about resisting the government back in the mid 90s and
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:45.200]  they had groups of people beat me up I fought back FBI following me around
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:50.680]  questioning me everything else and I was like I didn't mean I'm gonna get violent
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:54.480]  but I mean believe me folks you start getting into stuff and you know the

[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:15.360]  bet hey Alex I guess I should call you governor because I voted for you what
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:19.560]  did you vote for me in the election yeah I put you know where you have the
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:26.560]  ability to just fill it in with a name I put your name in there well that's
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:30.960]  interesting I wonder what that does I don't know but if enough people did it
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:35.800]  maybe they'd have to put it make a news story out of it or something but well
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:39.880]  instead they've got news stories in Texas monthly that I'm the long dead Bill
[02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:46.000]  Hicks so we're in a lot of trouble well that's for sure hey my line of the sand
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:52.720]  and it's just been kind of a slow boil I got sideswiped by an illegal and then
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:26:00.720]  I got hit in the rear by my car did by a illegal but you know almost everybody
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:04.800]  I know has been hit by an illegal and almost everybody I know who's been to
[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:08.440]  Mexico has been robbed by the police but we're just supposed to just totally
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:13.240]  adopt a failed collapse country and yeah these illegals drive like psychomaniacs
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:17.560]  they get to drunk drive everything else but then the police no matter what
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:22.120]  color you are will throw the book at citizens because they know where chumps
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:26.360]  they know where chumps and will go pay the tickets and that's discrimination
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:30.720]  that I'm sick of not because I hate people south of the border but because
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:35.640]  they are allowed to walk all over us because we are a nation of chumps I'm
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:40.080]  sorry go ahead yeah all three of those things have happened to me I've been to
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:44.200]  Mexico been hit up by the cops many times but well you deserve it I mean if
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:49.880]  you're white you deserve it well listen the Mexican cops shake down brown
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:54.480]  skinned people even more so I mean I've seen that statistically so it's not like
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:57.520]  they're being racist they actually they didn't get away with shaking Mexicans
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:00.880]  down more than blacks or whites and if you're a Mexican-American look out
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:04.480]  they'll really come after you in my experience down in Mexico but go ahead
[02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:10.400]  sorry just a few years ago though I had to fill out white instead of Hispanic
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:16.520]  but that's all changed now anyway the thing the thing that is kind of kind of
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:22.320]  set me off or or pushed me over the the edge is that I just recently applied for
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:26.880]  a passport and I had one like 20 years ago and lost it used it and lost it
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:32.280]  that's when I was traveling in Central America and Mexico and stuff but they
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:38.400]  have written me back saying that the long-form birth certificate that I
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:45.920]  supplied said that I was born at home and that there's no medical official
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:50.960]  record of my birth so they're they're questioning whether I'm an American or
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:55.800]  not and they're not going to issue me a birth certificate unless I I mean a
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:28:02.240]  passport unless I can produce some kind of official family Bible is or
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:09.760]  you can find out who the doctor was you first saw after that or they can get
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:14.200]  affidavits from family you're gonna have to get a lawyer yeah I tell you what I'll
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:18.280]  I'll get one eventually but it's just oh yeah they've made it to legally be a
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:22.520]  citizen or even if you are almost impossible again I told people 10 years
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:25.800]  ago with TSA because I saw the C-SPAN hearing when they admitted it they
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:30.040]  wanted to break our will make us feel horrible going through TSA then go oh
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:34.600]  come pre-screen with us come have a TSA interview jump through hoops and then
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:38.240]  we'll only search you sometimes and so it's about track it's the same thing
[02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:42.600]  with the open borders you want to come here be illegal cheat the system do
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:47.200]  whatever that's fine but if you want to become a legal citizen takes about 14
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:52.000]  years and now I'm hearing about more and more people where the records get
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:57.480]  lost at the hospital or home births they want you in the system from birth
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:00.920]  that they're gonna say you don't exist good to hear from you I appreciate your
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:05.360]  call Ramon that is really frustrating let's go to John and PA will hold him
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:12.520]  over if need be go ahead how you doing Alex good brother man this this hands up
[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:17.720]  don't shoot salute it's really reminiscent of like what the Nazis
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:21.120]  were doing what the brown shirts were doing because you know they're going
[02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:25.920]  around you know putting this symbol up for some racial outrage that doesn't
[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:29.480]  even exist stay there I don't get your point is you haven't able to finish but
[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:33.920]  I've got mine on this I think it's almost subliminal like we give up we submit
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:37.840]  the new freedom is put your hands up I'm a prisoner because that's what TSA is
[02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:43.000]  is go through your prisoner put your hands up and so it's just sick and then
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.000]  Obama acting like he cares so much because you know he's taking your jobs
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.600]  he might as well say you know he cares about you we're on the mud back the

[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:21.680]  their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities if you got

[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.240]  officers rifle they let them in the area they told them they could come in and
[02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:27.240]  now they're coming in like their trespassers punching and shoving people

[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:20.440]  Derek Green made like a year ago because it illustrates we are against the
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:25.560]  police state but we want to legitimately criticize it expose it and
[02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:30.840]  legislatively change it but also state if you follow UN globalist orders
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:37.080]  outside of law to try to take our guns then it will mean confrontation and
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:43.520]  we're doing that in an organized focused serious fashion you're not gonna
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:49.720]  catch pro-gun groups burning down churches and shooting firefighters you're
[02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:53.240]  gonna catch us strapping guns to our back and going to San Antonio where they
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:56.320]  say it's illegal to open carry and we're gonna do it right in front of the
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:37:01.320]  police just like Rosa Parks and at the front of the bus in civil disobedience
[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:05.760]  and open carry folks are doing that all over the country for our God-given rights
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:12.440]  the true civil rights movement but you get the NFL and MSNBC and all the usual
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:25.040]  suspects involved pushing and trying to get everybody fighting with each other
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:31.880]  that's all the Democrats have it's all they've ever had they need to change the
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:36.200]  subject of course out of 320 million people you can find some tragedies out
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:40.680]  there and they're wrong we should make something out of it but brown appears to
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:46.400]  not be it they tribe of Trayvon Martin they're trying with this it's so obvious
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:53.400]  while they screw us over they're doing this and it's dangerous we have Charles
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:57.240]  Barkley basically speaking to this as well and of course he'll be called to
[02:37:57.240 --> 02:38:04.480]  sell out as well because he doesn't want a civil war either I got more support
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:08.920]  now than I got negativity I know somebody that's like them them them
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:13.280]  jackasses and who are looting those aren't real black people those are
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:18.360]  scumbags no real black people they're not out there looting I just watched a
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:23.000]  great story on CNN where a bunch of folks really amazing folks wouldn't let
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:29.120]  them burn down on a stabler yeah it was a great story you know I was in
[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:34.360]  Philadelphia summer when I saw four black kids went in the store and left
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:38.520]  money when nobody was in the store but unfortunately the way the media portrays
[02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:41.800]  a lot of black people we only put the negative black people on television
[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:46.080]  Mike we don't put the good hard-working black people and I what that's what I
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:50.200]  said and that's what I meant there's a perception among some black people you're
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:54.720]  not a thug a hood rat you don't wear your pants down by your ass you're not
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:59.960]  black enough and they always holding us back plain and simple and I ain't
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:05.160]  shedding up and I ain't backing down well and you never do so let's since you
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:08.080]  brought up Ferguson let's bring that up because we've been talking about it in
[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:14.440]  the first hour this show your reaction to the reaction in Ferguson them not me
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:19.200]  as a white person and I see that as a reflection of black America's mistrust of
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:24.080]  white authority and the American judicial system and I I mean to me it was
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:28.000]  it was gonna happen and because there's just no trust out there how did you see
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:32.200]  that whole situation well I thought it was really unfortunate like I say I
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:38.320]  need to really read the grandeur because you know that Mike we live in a quick
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:44.040]  story media social network situation you know I'm hearing things today I
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:49.880]  haven't heard at all you know that even the black witness has said this kind
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:55.400]  came 20 feet at the officer they were fighting inside the car and two bullets
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:40:00.800]  went off you know I didn't know the kid came I mean the blood splatter so the
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:06.920]  guy came at the cop 20 feet I'm not saying who's right or wrong I'm just
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:11.160]  hearing the true story came out of grandeur investigation yeah the the
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:16.120]  evidence would lead you to believe that the officer acted properly but the
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:20.000]  mistrust black people aren't gonna ever see that and and that's where the
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  problem lies well but let me just say this man I think we have to be we we I
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.160]  know I'm black but I'm gonna try to always be honest if there were to be
[02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:34.000]  really careful with the cops man because it wasn't for the cops we'd be living in
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:39.160]  the wild wild west in our neighborhoods I think we can't pick out certain
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:44.880]  incidents that don't go our way and act like the cops are all bad I hate when we
[02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:49.600]  do that because think about it did you know how bad some of these neighborhoods
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:54.920]  would be if it wasn't for the cops listen and first of all it's always great
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:59.520]  to play Monday morning quarterback it like he shot him a lot like well if
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:02.840]  you've got a gun and you fight with somebody you're not gonna shoot him
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:06.520]  once you don't pull the trigger X amount of time like I say I don't know what
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:10.560]  happened Ferguson nobody knows what happened I want to take the time as a
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:16.600]  responsible person read the grand jury statement like I say I didn't know they
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:21.240]  got to fight inside the car that that what tells me something like wow they
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:26.760]  there's two shots in the car all right and I really like Charles Barkley I mean
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:31.280]  he really is a smart guy who really tries to think everything out and that's
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:37.680]  what I try to do that's what I basically want here but separately the brown
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:41.160]  thing isn't even important compared to what's happening in the world 15 million
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:45.840]  people starve to death a year 15 million children starve to death other 20
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:51.320]  million adults about a third of them in Africa I mean I don't brag about myself
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:54.480]  and stuff but I've researched charities where 90% of it actually goes to people
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:42:00.640]  they dig wells and buy them calves and you know cows and try to get
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:04.760]  electricity into the areas and I give the four or five charities mainly in
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:10.000]  Africa I've never told that story before because I want to actually help those
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:14.600]  people and I fight to keep the GMO that Bill Gates wants to give them close
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:17.840]  quote but that's not because I'm some bleeding heart and have some guilt
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:22.240]  about black people I've donated money to poor kids in the Philippines and poor
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:28.760]  kids in Guatemala but I go out and I do the research on charities that I know
[02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:32.960]  aren't globalist fronts and I know aren't pushing new order agendas and
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:36.600]  saying we'll dig you a well but everybody in the village has got to take
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:44.160]  these vaccines or we'll give each you know family a cow with a heifer
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:47.880]  program my grandma likes that a lot so I've been involved in it as well and
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:52.840]  then you find out there's an agenda behind it and it's not because I'm
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:58.480]  some bleeding heart you're supposed to as a successful person go out and find
[02:42:58.480 --> 02:43:02.720]  people you want to help but when the government says oh just give us your
[02:43:02.720 --> 02:43:06.920]  tax money we'll hand it out and we'll help who we want to help oh let us
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:10.680]  federalize health care that's already screwed up because of federalization and
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:16.400]  of course it's now a train wreck because it's designed to be the special
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:25.360]  interest want big government Microsoft Miller brewing IBM Google all every
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:33.600]  globalist company AT&T Time Warner every one of them except Ford I'm not
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:36.000]  saying Ford's some great corporation just noticed they don't give to a lot of it
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:40.880]  is giving to take the guns to open the borders to cut the wages to shut up
[02:43:40.880 --> 02:43:47.040]  world government to feed you GMO I mean they are in there they are the enemy
[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:52.280]  they are the people devaluing the dollar they're the people that have jacked up
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:55.880]  our gas prices artificially through OPEC for the last 30 years and now because
[02:43:55.880 --> 02:43:59.120]  they want to bankrupt Russia they're lowering the price once rush is
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:03.280]  bankrupted because they lowered the price some by selling oil cheap then it's
[02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:08.360]  gonna go sky high you'll be paying 20 15 10 depending on where you live 10 to
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:12.920]  $20 is where they want it the UN has said different numbers of 14 to 16
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:18.000]  dollars it $10 it varies I mean once they've bankrupted Russia see see why
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:23.560]  am I against bankrupting Russia because it's a massive screw job Russia isn't
[02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:28.520]  starting fights Russia's selling energy cheap the cartel doesn't like it that
[02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:33.360]  should upset you shutting Russia down should upset you we need some competition
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:38.440]  in the world just like shutting down our power plants I'm I obsess on that
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:45.640]  because 59% of our power seven years ago came from coal plants it was 50% a
[02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:52.240]  few years ago now it's something like 37 they are shutting our power off
[02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:58.480]  Detroit lights are off in Detroit they turn this the street lights off months
[02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:04.760]  ago now they don't even have power period we're being shut down here people I
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:09.400]  don't care what color you are we're being screwed over excuse me I said I
[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:13.000]  went to those clips haven't gone to your calls and I'm getting upset I'm getting

[02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:43.000]  instances and one more thing the the 1033 program Obama announced yesterday
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:48.200]  he's not gonna end 1033 he's gonna make sure it's consistent everywhere so he
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:52.720]  just announced the the rollout of military you know stormtroopers everywhere
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:56.320]  and no one's able to see it and we not predict that they're gonna have the UN
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:50:00.280]  come in and then they're gonna say federalized police militarize them as
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:05.440]  the answer. I will tell you New York Liberals have no idea what's going on
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:10.160]  those you know my social circle they they they're out of it. I saw mainly white
[02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:14.720]  people marching and being all mad at the police in New York blaming them for
[02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:18.880]  brown as if every cop in the world is guilty but but the globalist they're
[02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:23.860]  guilty of nothing. Right of course well yeah they you know they just promote
[02:50:23.860 --> 02:50:27.720]  Planned Parenthood and climate change and you know they'll buy into it people
[02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:30.600]  buy into anything man. Oh I tell you that's what I'm worried about is the

[02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:05.480]  You know why I get mad? It's because I'm so frustrated. There's all this news I
[02:54:05.480 --> 02:54:08.520]  wanted to get to that I didn't get to that's so important and there's all
[02:54:08.520 --> 02:54:12.880]  these callers and it's just so simple this is staged. It's so simple they're
[02:54:12.880 --> 02:54:17.600]  stirring everybody up and it just makes me so upset to see the mainstream media
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:22.160]  race baiting like this and then this will only empower the police state. See
[02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:25.040]  that's the rest of the story and I meant to say that today I'm glad the
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:29.200]  caller just mentioned it. I was watching CBS News again with the
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:36.240]  Bilderberg group member Charlie Rose on there and they're talking about the
[02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:40.160]  answer is federalization of police and more funding which is the training is
[02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:47.280]  the black uniforms is the zero tolerance kill everybody training and so on top
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:51.200]  of it Obama oh health care is messed up I'll screw it up ten times worse because
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:56.880]  I love you. It's like they always come in and make it worse and then grandstand
[02:54:56.880 --> 02:55:01.440]  up there and then Planned Parenthood has joined in the demonstrations when
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:08.240]  their mission they were founded to kill black people and I wish Lewis Faircom
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:12.880]  would do some good and talk about that but no no no no it's only get upset
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:21.760]  about a thug Brown he's a thug in my view. Does that mean that then the cops
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:28.760]  are all angels? Absolutely not and I fight that every single day and I don't
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:32.520]  care what color you are and by the way if you're a good cop fighting a corrupt
[02:55:32.520 --> 02:55:37.880]  system we've had Serpa Co on multiple times he's a listener but but other cops
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:43.520]  that aren't as well known we've defended and helped we stand for justice
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:47.480]  because I want justice in my life I'm gonna give you the best justice I can
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:54.200]  and we need to start not liking thugs in this country period I don't care if
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:57.640]  they got a uniform I don't care who they are you see a cop acting like a thug
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:56:01.200]  and I've done this a hundred times on video I'll go over and tell them you're
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:05.240]  acting like a thug and sometimes I get arrested
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:08.960]  they don't have a right to act like that but you know what the public doesn't
[02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:14.720]  have a right to act like that either we're all just people. Dan in Illinois
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:19.800]  thanks for holding her on the air welcome. Yeah I want to thank you for
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:24.880]  being a great host and I enjoy your show and I want to say the way I'm gonna
[02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:29.560]  draw my line in the sand is saying that I disagree with you when you say
[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:34.800]  Benjamin Franklin who was a member of the Hellfire Club said his favorite
[02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:41.200]  Bible quote was God helps those who helps themselves that is not even in the
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:45.680]  Bible that is not an accurate Bible quote. Well absolutely I think you are
[02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:49.520]  right and I don't remember saying exactly what you just said but I'm not
[02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:53.760]  sure now that that history channel shows I researched it about him being in the
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:57.640]  Hellfire Club was true and so when I said that ten years ago and played the
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:02.280]  clip I went and then it turns out that where he lived in England after that was
[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:09.200]  the place where two doctors live that were doing an encyclopedia on the
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:14.480]  anatomy pre-graze anatomy of the encyclopedia and that those dead bodies
[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:19.520]  were from basically you had to grave rob back then when somebody died to be
[02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:22.920]  able to actually do anatomy because that they were superstitious and wouldn't
[02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:27.560]  let the doctors do it so I apologize to Benjamin Franklin I believe that was a
[02:57:27.560 --> 02:57:32.360]  demonization campaign against him but go ahead sir you got the floor. That's
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:39.000]  from poor Richard Armanek that what he was quoting and you got to be saved to
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:44.920]  fight the new world order Alex that's our only hope and I disagree with you
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:49.720]  about the rapture there is a rapture and we will be saved and those who are left
[02:57:49.720 --> 02:57:55.880]  behind are those who's gonna face the Antichrist not the true believers. Well I
[02:57:55.880 --> 02:58:03.960]  sure hope you're right. God's word is right and you got to learn it Alex before
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:08.840]  you got to say it on air you got to study it and get into it and learn it
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:13.360]  this is Bible Dan and I'm the man with the Bible in his hand. Do you have a
[02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:21.960]  YouTube channel? Me? Yeah. I'll start one if you help me out and be my first
[02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:26.080]  guest on my channel. You know maybe I should start doing that to get activists
[02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:29.400]  maybe I'd do that how about you start your channel then we'll see about it
[02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:32.360]  being a guest on there. Alright God bless you I'm gonna do some overdrive and go

[03:00:22.880 --> 03:00:25.800]  are the resistance.
[03:00:26.200 --> 03:00:30.920]  Let's move quick I've been babbling. Ralph in Arizona thanks for calling you're on
[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:41.840]  the air. Yes welcome. Well hello it's my honor to meet you. I have the highest
[03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:47.480]  regard for the work you do. Well thanks for putting up with me brother. Well I
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:53.880]  respect your scholarship I respect the fact that you vet your sources and you
[03:00:53.880 --> 03:01:03.320]  cite and reference everything and this this is important to me. There's a lot
[03:01:03.320 --> 03:01:12.200]  that I'm not going to say but you have asked what is my line in the sand. Is
[03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:19.320]  that correct? Yes sir. All right my line in the
[03:01:20.960 --> 03:01:30.920]  basically okay my line in the sand is basic lawlessness when you have lawless
[03:01:30.920 --> 03:01:37.240]  of government corporations and individuals that breaks down the
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:46.000]  foundation for civil society to function. For that reason I don't think
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:50.720]  you're looking at a revolutionary situation it's more what you'd call
[03:01:50.720 --> 03:01:57.680]  historically a reaction. And as you know Robert Browning said we live in
[03:01:57.680 --> 03:02:06.960]  visions of Rome. In the late Roman Empire there were a series of pretenders
[03:02:06.960 --> 03:02:15.560]  who actually didn't possess the legitimate rights to citizenship who
[03:02:15.560 --> 03:02:23.040]  came in and occupied the consulate and then you from that you that led to a
[03:02:23.040 --> 03:02:30.480]  series of reactions and the re-establishment of order in those cases
[03:02:30.480 --> 03:02:37.680]  reaction was kind of short lived but hopefully not. No you're right I mean we
[03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:41.160]  could have just reactions that restabilize things but the globalists
[03:02:41.160 --> 03:02:45.760]  are trying to create anarchy so they can bring in more control as the answer. I
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:51.240]  think that's really what's happening. Yeah that's right and we must not let
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:03:02.080]  them. That's absolutely the situation. The other line in the sand and this is a
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:11.880]  little bit more exotic is southeast German Prussian Crepplenian psychiatry.
[03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:18.560]  Most people don't know that you know psychiatry in the case of Stalin and
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:26.680]  Hitler. It's always been the handmaiden of tyranny. Are you still with me? I'm
[03:03:26.680 --> 03:03:30.920]  listening to you absolutely and I'm just seeing a new headline. Police blame the
[03:03:30.920 --> 03:03:34.880]  man killed by a hammer for his own murder saying he was at the wrong place
[03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:42.240]  the wrong time. How sick that again they are covering up what really happened.
[03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:46.680]  This is just incredible. Sorry go ahead. Very interesting points you're right and a
[03:03:46.680 --> 03:03:51.280]  lot of the German psychology that came out in the last 200 years also was a
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:58.800]  big part of this modern tyranny we're under. What was that last word? What kind
[03:03:58.800 --> 03:04:04.000]  of psychology? A lot of the psychology that came out of Germany in the last 200
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:10.680]  years has been adopted as forms of oppression. Yeah Emil Crepplen people
[03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:16.840]  don't realize this in the 60s from Gadget series you know it's kind of
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:20.640]  Miley Cyrus they did the same thing you know they start out with a sweet
[03:04:20.640 --> 03:04:26.760]  innocent young girl and then they turn her into it turn them into whatever you
[03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:32.800]  know Hitler's ministry of it a Goebbels ministry of enlightenment came to the
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:38.360]  United States in operation paperclip and you know what you're talking about Ralph
[03:04:38.360 --> 03:04:41.480]  you got a promise to call back I wish people like Ralph would have a YouTube
[03:04:41.480 --> 03:04:44.480]  channel because I mean when he's talking about it's really accurate and then we
[03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:49.840]  got to cut him off I promise or CJ can punch me in the nose doesn't want to
[03:04:49.840 --> 03:04:53.160]  though I'm going to take a bunch of calls tomorrow we did okay today good
[03:04:53.160 --> 03:05:09.400]  show over all but tomorrow I'm taking a bunch of your calls I'm out of time
