[00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.111]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:11.691]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:13.232]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:17.433]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:21.533]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.977 --> 00:00:39.185]  Any time I think it can't get any crazier, it does.
[00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:43.912]  Now I knew what was going to happen.
[00:00:43.912 --> 00:00:48.518]  I knew what was going to unfold under the President's executive order for the Rural Council
[00:00:50.023 --> 00:00:52.904]  I knew what would happen with his new executive order on the waterways.
[00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:59.607]  He can't get Congress to sign a law, the Sea Treaty, to hand over the oceans that the U.S.
[00:00:59.607 --> 00:01:01.228]  controls to the U.N.
[00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:08.031]  So he just sets up an executive group and hands it over.
[00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:09.672]  I knew all of this would happen.
[00:01:09.672 --> 00:01:15.434]  I mean, the Rural Council is headed up by the Pentagon and by Homeland Security.
[00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:25.150]  We've got all of that taking place.
[00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.831]  And we have this bombshell article that's the top of DrudgeReport.com from The Daily Caller.
[00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:35.252]  We have it linked up at Infowars.com as well.
[00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:36.612]  That's a whole other subject.
[00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:46.795]  Now, all the local talk radio that I tune into and the office tunes into, when something's the headline on Drudge, it becomes the issue that people are covering in local radio.
[00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:50.796]  The hosts were like, we used to think Alex Jones was wrong about this U.N.
[00:01:50.796 --> 00:01:54.737]  takeover, Agenda 21, but I'm getting chills.
[00:01:54.737 --> 00:01:55.737]  It's really happening.
[00:01:56.317 --> 00:01:57.838]  And what am I talking about?
[00:01:57.838 --> 00:02:04.224]  Rural kids, parents angry about Labor Department rule banning farm chores.
[00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:06.206]  Well, that does kill the family farm.
[00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:16.415]  If you can't teach your children how to do the work, and if you're not told to do the work, and I've done farm chores, been sent down to the farm most summers, lived down the farm for much of a year,
[00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:18.497]  And that's what you do.
[00:02:18.497 --> 00:02:20.157]  And I also got paid.
[00:02:20.157 --> 00:02:21.818]  And I liked having money.
[00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:24.459]  And I went and worked at nearby ranches when I was 13.
[00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.240]  They said, you know how to drive a tractor?
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.600]  Good.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.102]  Get up there and go shred those fields.
[00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:33.022]  And they don't want children becoming adults.
[00:02:33.022 --> 00:02:39.145]  They want you playing video games, taking Prozac, not going outside, taking your vaccines.
[00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:41.006]  And this is Agenda 21.
[00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:51.814]  This is what the Rural Council has said it's going to do with Homeland Security and the Department of Defense.
[00:02:51.814 --> 00:02:53.154]  This is what we're dealing with.
[00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:59.498]  This is the reality of what's happening in our society.
[00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:01.318]  And it's really waking people up.
[00:03:01.318 --> 00:03:09.503]  Now, as big as this news is, there are two stories at InfoWars.com that are much bigger.
[00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:13.978]  And that are getting no attention and have now rolled off since yesterday evening.
[00:03:13.978 --> 00:03:16.880]  There's so much news, the featured news just rolls off constantly.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.542]  They've rolled off into the Top Stories and Breaking News sections.
[00:03:21.542 --> 00:03:25.364]  Breaking News is the RSS feed, the last day or so's news.
[00:03:25.364 --> 00:03:26.765]  We're going back further in the archive.
[00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:31.408]  And the Top Stories is whatever's in the featured news archives.
[00:03:31.408 --> 00:03:33.209]  Breaking News is red-linked.
[00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.570]  Next to it is Top Stories.
[00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:45.858]  That is such an important group of links to visit because in there you will find all the stuff that gets posted in the afternoon, at night, and at 2 a.m.
[00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:52.342]  because my writers are so obsessed with liberty and fighting the tyranny that sometimes they'll write 10 articles a day.
[00:03:52.342 --> 00:03:54.424]  I don't even have to tell them to.
[00:03:54.424 --> 00:03:57.025]  They understand this is important.
[00:03:57.025 --> 00:03:57.746]  What's going on?
[00:03:58.646 --> 00:04:05.811]  Now that particular thing we have on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, that is the Top Stories link from the Featured News Archives.
[00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:17.018]  If you click on the Breaking News link that's in red, right next to it, it is the RSS feed and it's got everything going back to the beginning of the RSS feed that we started.
[00:04:18.973 --> 00:04:22.614]  And again, you just click on it and it takes you to the RSS feed.
[00:04:22.614 --> 00:04:24.914]  I've never seen it say subscribe like that.
[00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:26.795]  It doesn't do that on my computer.
[00:04:26.795 --> 00:04:32.896]  I just clicked it right in here if you're watching on TV and it just goes directly to the RSS feed for everybody.
[00:04:32.896 --> 00:04:37.377]  It's simply InfoWars.com forward slash RSS.
[00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:40.738]  InfoWars.com forward slash RSS.
[00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:43.619]  And I'll tell you about these two big articles that
[00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:51.399]  We need to punch out into the mainstream and we need people to get out of denial as well.
[00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:58.450]  It's like when we started covering that the NDAA allowed secret arrests, disappearance of citizens, people didn't believe it and said I was making it up until later.
[00:05:00.498 --> 00:05:04.319]  Right now, the average family spends one-fourth of their income on food.
[00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:10.240]  It's time to cut your food budget in half by using the best, most affordable food on the planet from eFoods Direct.

[00:06:00.901 --> 00:06:07.543]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:07.543 --> 00:06:12.685]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:12.685 --> 00:06:21.409]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.310]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:06:25.472 --> 00:06:27.748]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.721]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:43.502]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:43.502 --> 00:06:46.384]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:06:46.384 --> 00:06:50.627]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.311]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:57.311 --> 00:06:58.092]  Got it.
[00:06:58.092 --> 00:06:58.953]  Others don't.
[00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:05.635]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:08.036]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:07:08.036 --> 00:07:17.142]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:17.142 --> 00:07:20.584]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:07:20.584 --> 00:07:22.265]  There's no priming required.
[00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:24.547]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:07:24.547 --> 00:07:27.048]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:07:28.109 --> 00:07:29.629]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:31.050]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.211]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:37.592]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:07:37.592 --> 00:07:41.733]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:07:41.733 --> 00:07:44.474]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:07:44.474 --> 00:07:46.054]  It's what my family uses.
[00:07:46.054 --> 00:07:49.355]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:07:49.355 --> 00:07:54.617]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:07:55.197 --> 00:07:56.659]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:58.040]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.863]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.512 --> 00:08:18.820]  This is going to be another incredibly important and informative worldwide broadcast.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:26.267]  I am so indignant and angry and focused, I'm going to try to control myself today with controlled, focused rage.
[00:08:27.288 --> 00:08:38.824]  Against the globalists, I have come to set brush fires in the minds of men and women, not just here in the United States, and not just in North America, and not just in our hemisphere, but worldwide.
[00:08:38.824 --> 00:08:41.607]  Humanity is awakening to the cancer.
[00:08:42.108 --> 00:08:55.331]  That is the private fractional reserve banking New World Order syndicate that is creating a standardized corporate despotism that's anti-free market and totally monopolistic and eugenics-based worldwide.
[00:08:55.331 --> 00:09:08.135]  It is known as World Government New World Order and I declare and swear on the altar of Almighty God eternal resistance over every form of tyranny.
[00:09:08.135 --> 00:09:09.575]  And I hope you'll pledge that with me.
[00:09:11.448 --> 00:09:13.911]  Now I got some good news.
[00:09:13.911 --> 00:09:24.661]  I walked in here this morning and Rob Dew walked up to me, head of the Nightly News, the head producer of the Nightly News, and he said, are you listening to local radio, FM and AM?
[00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:25.742]  And I said, yeah.
[00:09:25.742 --> 00:09:28.785]  I wanted to hear what he had to say.
[00:09:28.785 --> 00:09:31.088]  They're talking about it, they're waking up, they're saying you're right.
[00:09:32.622 --> 00:09:34.263]  I didn't have time getting ready to tell do.
[00:09:34.263 --> 00:09:36.345]  I listen to San Antonio and Dallas radio.
[00:09:36.345 --> 00:09:38.806]  I monitor it driving in every day.
[00:09:38.806 --> 00:09:44.510]  The power of the Drudge Report is unbelievable.
[00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.011]  I marvel at it.
[00:09:46.011 --> 00:09:57.860]  Drudge, and we show folks, DrudgeReport.com, went with the giant headline from the Daily Caller, and it's now moved from being the top headline.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.421]  Now it says Economic Suicide Pact.
[00:10:01.107 --> 00:10:11.615]  His top headline was, Obama administration to ban farm workers, children working and doing chores on their own farm.
[00:10:11.615 --> 00:10:22.043]  And that became the talking point even on a quasi-trendy liberal show that Dew was tuning into, monitoring.
[00:10:22.043 --> 00:10:23.645]  And had on in the background here at the office.
[00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:27.375]  And they were saying, we're getting chills.
[00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:28.236]  No, no, no.
[00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:31.400]  I'm not just saying what Alex Jones says, I'm getting chills.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.262]  Because one of the guys grew up on a farm.
[00:10:33.262 --> 00:10:37.908]  He's saying your parents can't give you chores?
[00:10:37.908 --> 00:10:39.750]  I've read this and I've worked on farms.
[00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.574]  Not just my family's farm and ranch, but others.
[00:10:42.574 --> 00:10:43.335]  That's where I come from.
[00:10:45.007 --> 00:10:50.010]  And it says you cannot handle any of the raw materials of a farm.
[00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:57.335]  Eggs, grain, milk, mowing, grass, the way this reads.
[00:10:57.335 --> 00:10:58.916]  By the way, it's not a law.
[00:10:58.916 --> 00:11:01.598]  It's a rule.
[00:11:01.598 --> 00:11:02.899]  A rule.
[00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:08.943]  Like Obama said, hey, Congress won't pass a law to shut down all these coal-powered plants that my buddies don't own.
[00:11:08.943 --> 00:11:10.304]  He shuts them down.
[00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:11.285]  Theirs make more money.
[00:11:11.285 --> 00:11:11.985]  That's the plan.
[00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:14.467]  General Electric gets waivers on record.
[00:11:17.287 --> 00:11:18.848]  Power prices exploding everywhere.
[00:11:18.848 --> 00:11:20.429]  They're totally ripping us off.
[00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:20.849]  Why not?
[00:11:20.849 --> 00:11:21.710]  They're mafia.
[00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.991]  It's mafia government.
[00:11:23.991 --> 00:11:26.493]  The environmental movement is the environmental mafia.
[00:11:26.493 --> 00:11:27.713]  Nothing to do with the earth.
[00:11:27.713 --> 00:11:29.174]  It's a power grab.
[00:11:29.174 --> 00:11:38.400]  It's you've got to get authorization to have a grocery store in our neighborhood if we decide to let you because I'm Don Luigi.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.661]  That's what government is now.
[00:11:45.458 --> 00:12:07.592]  That's exactly what it's doing, but it is heartening to know that every radio show I tuned into and that when I walked in here I was being told about it because the people are awake and the biggest internet media system in the world, bigger than mainstream broadcasts, you name it, is DrudgeReport.com.
[00:12:09.147 --> 00:12:10.408]  No brag, just fact.
[00:12:10.408 --> 00:12:21.575]  I'm just telling you a fact and that's why they attack him and demonize him because they cannot stand the fact that they'll link to the Daily Caller that exposes the text of the rule.
[00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:28.679]  They cannot stand that they'll link to InfoWars.com on a TSA story or Dering Bilderberg.
[00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:31.181]  Drudge, the last five years, links to our stories.
[00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:33.923]  Last year it was like 15 or more top stories.
[00:12:35.751 --> 00:12:39.794]  Videos we were posting were getting like three million views a day on the subject.
[00:12:39.794 --> 00:12:46.119]  Totally took over and this year the Washington Post came out and said yeah, Bilderberg's real and it basically appoints presidents.
[00:12:46.119 --> 00:12:50.343]  It decides who can run and basically appoints VPs.
[00:12:50.343 --> 00:12:54.646]  We've gone from doesn't exist to yeah, Bilderberg runs everything.
[00:12:54.646 --> 00:12:57.148]  Washington Post last week.
[00:12:57.148 --> 00:13:01.712]  And sure, it's InfoWars.com, it's the listeners of this show, but it's also
[00:13:03.208 --> 00:13:18.540]  People like Matt Drudge who over the years gets more and more hardcore and has woken up more and more to what's happening and has the courage to actually put out real information and to take info wars that was already on the map
[00:13:19.406 --> 00:13:22.949]  And growing exponentially, and put on a map even more.
[00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:33.998]  I mean every day now, the Wall Street Journal, or the New York Times, or the Associated Press, or the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, every day,
[00:13:34.719 --> 00:13:42.204]  We're now used as news sources and they always say, oh yeah, they are putting black boxes that track you and they are secretly arresting people.
[00:13:42.204 --> 00:13:44.026]  Alex Jones, here's his website.
[00:13:44.026 --> 00:13:46.768]  He did break it, but he's paranoid.
[00:13:46.768 --> 00:13:50.130]  Wall Street Journal today, a black box in your car.
[00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:54.073]  Three paragraphs about InfoWars.com.
[00:13:54.073 --> 00:13:55.574]  Because we originated that.
[00:13:57.745 --> 00:14:02.788]  By listeners sending us tips going, have you seen this in the 21st century?
[00:14:02.788 --> 00:14:04.348]  You entered a 21 bill?
[00:14:04.348 --> 00:14:06.569]  That's what it's called?
[00:14:06.569 --> 00:14:08.730]  21 math?
[00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.712]  I mean that bill is the big kahuna right now.
[00:14:11.712 --> 00:14:14.553]  It was 1800 plus pages long last time I checked.
[00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:16.194]  Filled with every evil you can imagine.
[00:14:16.194 --> 00:14:18.115]  I'm going to get to our top story in a moment.
[00:14:18.115 --> 00:14:20.156]  But the point is we've reached the tipping point now.
[00:14:20.156 --> 00:14:21.417]  Want to talk about tipping point?
[00:14:22.196 --> 00:14:29.078]  We'll put on screen, if you go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, there's now some red links up in the nav bar.
[00:14:29.078 --> 00:14:35.440]  Because everybody kept complaining, hey, your top stories roll off in just a few hours, there's so much in your featured news.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.020]  We're like, okay, read the subsections.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.800]  They've got a lot of it mirrored there.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:46.883]  But if you've got a breaking news, that's the RSS feed, and it's got everything that's going on the site in live time, easy to read and find.
[00:14:46.883 --> 00:14:47.883]  Okay, you can click on that.
[00:14:49.307 --> 00:14:59.613]  Or, right next to it, there is the top story link, and that is all the featured news that we've written or that we've put together.
[00:14:59.613 --> 00:15:06.097]  Okay, so there's the RSS feed that you're looking at on screen right now, InfoWars.com forward slash RSS.
[00:15:06.097 --> 00:15:08.579]  Very important, that's in the breaking news area.
[00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:14.983]  But then right next to it, there's a link that's white that says top news in the nav bar.
[00:15:14.983 --> 00:15:16.204]  We debated which one to have red.
[00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.731]  But top stories, that takes you to the Featured News Archive.
[00:15:20.731 --> 00:15:22.371]  Why do I raise that?
[00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:31.432]  Because these news articles went up, Curt Nemo at about 2 yesterday, or about 1.55, right at the end of the show, I mentioned it, Central Time.
[00:15:31.432 --> 00:15:41.474]  And then about an hour later, Daisy Luther for InfoWars.com, Bill allows IRS to revoke Second Amendment rights by stealth.
[00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:45.295]  And I went and read the bill, and sure enough, it's there.
[00:15:45.295 --> 00:15:46.515]  I'm going to be covering that in a moment.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.140]  And there's another one.
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.142]  Bank of America's war on the Second Amendment.
[00:15:52.142 --> 00:15:53.262]  They announced that last year.
[00:15:53.262 --> 00:16:02.927]  They're saying no bank account with them if you own a gun shop, if you own a shop selling ammo, gun suppliers, gun manufacturers.
[00:16:02.927 --> 00:16:03.888]  It's total discrimination.
[00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:19.095]  You know, they say private businesses have got to hire Muslims, have got to hire Satan worshippers, Catholics have to hire Hindus, Hindus have to hire Muslims.
[00:16:19.095 --> 00:16:29.800]  But, but, but, the mega banks, Federal Reserve, Bank of America, it's one of the shareholders, enemy of this country, only thing American about it is the name.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.622]  Camouflage, it should say Bank of Un-America, or Bank That Hates America.
[00:16:36.038 --> 00:16:37.160]  Bank that hates its customers.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.669]  Five dollar fees for using your own money with an ATM.
[00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:46.535]  They told one of the biggest gun manufacturers in the country, we gave you a year to stop it!
[00:16:47.659 --> 00:16:50.061]  Now get your money and get out of here.
[00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:51.402]  People are like, well, we'll just move on.
[00:16:51.402 --> 00:16:52.683]  No, you won't in the future.
[00:16:52.683 --> 00:16:59.949]  All the big mega banks, the fellow Reserve Bank boys, are consolidating and taking over the banks right now.
[00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:06.014]  Two years ago, when they were trying to pass the Banking Reform Act to give the globalists more power, to reform it more in their corrupt image.
[00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:12.262]  The head of the Texas Banking Association came out and wrote an article that it sounded like I wrote.
[00:17:12.262 --> 00:17:14.823]  This is the big mega foreign banks taking over.
[00:17:14.823 --> 00:17:17.064]  They get all the free money out of the Treasury.
[00:17:17.064 --> 00:17:18.184]  They control the Congress.
[00:17:18.184 --> 00:17:19.725]  They're the ones that created the derivatives.
[00:17:19.725 --> 00:17:21.606]  They're going to shut down our healthy banks.
[00:17:21.606 --> 00:17:28.550]  They're coming after us.
[00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.951]  They mean business.
[00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:32.892]  So the good news is
[00:17:33.945 --> 00:17:39.606]  Three different talk shows I tuned into sounded like this one this morning, including a liberal one.
[00:17:39.606 --> 00:17:41.387]  Quasi-liberal.
[00:17:41.387 --> 00:17:45.308]  You know, they try to act establishment and play both sides of the fence.
[00:17:45.308 --> 00:17:48.769]  And two of the shows were plugging InfoWars.com.
[00:17:48.769 --> 00:17:54.230]  None of the shows were admitting they were at DrudgeReport.com getting the Daily Caller articles.
[00:17:55.205 --> 00:17:57.026]  And they do do a good job of the Daily Caller.
[00:17:57.026 --> 00:18:06.674]  I wish Tucker Carlson, who runs it, wasn't running around saying how evil I was and calling other reporters and saying they work for me when they don't and cussing and saying I'm scary.
[00:18:06.674 --> 00:18:14.660]  Hey, Tucker, I know it's scary that criminal foreign banks funded foreign extremists to at least be part of 9-11.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.520]  And that's scary.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.162]  But I'm not the one that's scary.
[00:18:17.862 --> 00:18:19.306]  The news is scary.
[00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:21.913]  My point is, I give credit where credit's due.
[00:18:21.913 --> 00:18:25.964]  Rural kids, parents angry about Labor Department rule banning farm chores.
[00:18:28.123 --> 00:18:31.567]  So I'm going to give you the rest of the story today on all of this.
[00:18:31.567 --> 00:18:38.474]  Jim Tucker's popping in with breaking news on Bilderberg 2012.
[00:18:38.474 --> 00:18:39.896]  Can he confirm for us?
[00:18:39.896 --> 00:18:40.496]  I don't know yet.
[00:18:40.496 --> 00:18:41.618]  I haven't even talked to him.
[00:18:41.618 --> 00:18:43.059]  Producers set him up.
[00:18:43.059 --> 00:18:45.342]  I haven't talked to him and found out yet.
[00:18:45.342 --> 00:18:50.047]  Is it true it's going to be in Chantilly, the site of the 2008 event where Obama was crowned Supreme Leader?
[00:18:51.394 --> 00:18:54.075]  And the Washington Post was in attendance and said it didn't exist.
[00:18:54.075 --> 00:18:58.356]  Now they admit it exists and admit they have basically a point who gets to run for president.
[00:18:58.356 --> 00:19:00.717]  Ron Paul really wins some states, they just ignore it.
[00:19:00.717 --> 00:19:01.977]  They run things.
[00:19:01.977 --> 00:19:08.259]  But you begin to, now that we've flushed them out, now they're out in the open.
[00:19:08.259 --> 00:19:12.740]  Politically, we've run the quail out from cover.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.842]  Now we can, in the political wars, dismantle them.
[00:19:16.842 --> 00:19:20.883]  They can only carry out a covert takeover that's criminal while concealed.
[00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:29.495]  You engage the enemy in the Info War, you take fire, you take political casualties, you have your name dropped to the mud, it doesn't matter!
[00:19:29.495 --> 00:19:31.397]  Because you're locked with them!
[00:19:31.397 --> 00:19:38.025]  Like... Ahab and the White Whale!
[00:19:38.025 --> 00:19:38.706]  Are you with me?
[00:19:38.706 --> 00:19:41.309]  I know you are, because something else exciting happened.
[00:19:41.309 --> 00:19:41.910]  It's got chills.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.901]  Five different sightings from people I know, including photos.
[00:19:46.901 --> 00:19:52.923]  Shepard areas of Austin, people out holding up Infowars.com signs all over town yesterday.
[00:19:52.923 --> 00:19:53.644]  Beautiful.
[00:19:53.644 --> 00:19:56.185]  This is starting to happen all over the country.
[00:19:56.185 --> 00:19:58.385]  Liberty is rising.
[00:19:58.385 --> 00:19:59.246]  I can feel it.
[00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:06.269]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:20:06.269 --> 00:20:08.670]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:17.775]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:20:17.775 --> 00:20:21.216]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:20:21.216 --> 00:20:22.897]  There's no priming required.
[00:20:22.897 --> 00:20:25.178]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[00:20:25.178 --> 00:20:27.680]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.260]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.681]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:20:31.681 --> 00:20:34.862]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:20:34.862 --> 00:20:38.223]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:20:38.223 --> 00:20:40.143]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[00:20:40.143 --> 00:20:42.384]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:20:42.384 --> 00:20:45.125]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:20:45.125 --> 00:20:46.685]  It's what my family uses.
[00:20:46.685 --> 00:20:50.006]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:45.986]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:45.986 --> 00:22:46.847]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:46.847 --> 00:22:50.111]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:22:50.111 --> 00:22:50.892]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.892 --> 00:22:51.973]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:22:51.973 --> 00:22:52.313]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.313 --> 00:22:52.633]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.803 --> 00:23:06.886]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:09.007]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[00:23:09.007 --> 00:23:12.670]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:17.152]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[00:23:17.152 --> 00:23:20.274]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:24.877]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[00:23:24.877 --> 00:23:30.881]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[00:23:31.221 --> 00:23:33.123]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[00:23:33.123 --> 00:23:40.168]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:23:40.168 --> 00:23:44.432]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95.

[00:23:46.834 --> 00:23:49.856]  For safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[00:23:49.856 --> 00:23:55.600]  Call 877-5-F-A-K-E-TV or go to Faketv.com.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.182]  Faketv.com.
[00:23:57.182 --> 00:23:58.503]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[00:24:01.194 --> 00:24:01.800]  Uh oh.
[00:24:05.051 --> 00:24:06.592]  No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[00:24:06.592 --> 00:24:15.855]  You know, people are asking, why does the government want to pay billions of tax money to ship General Motors to China and Brazil and other countries?
[00:24:15.855 --> 00:24:20.216]  Why do they want to put taxes on us, carbon taxes, but not on other countries?
[00:24:20.216 --> 00:24:21.897]  They want to bankrupt you.
[00:24:21.897 --> 00:24:25.138]  They explain it in Agenda 21.
[00:24:25.138 --> 00:24:30.820]  They want to wreck it so that you're dependent on them so they can rebuild it in their image.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.861]  They don't like you owning private property and being uppity.
[00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:43.037]  Jim Tucker, who's coming up in the next segment, repeatedly says one of the top agendas is shutting down the economy.
[00:24:43.037 --> 00:24:54.766]  Not too fast, because it'll make people rebel, but as quickly as they can, because they throw fits and they say, how can we have 500 people out here protesting us in the middle of the Swiss Alps?
[00:24:54.766 --> 00:24:57.168]  How do they have enough money to protest us?
[00:24:57.168 --> 00:25:01.892]  And they actually say in meetings, I want them bankrupt now!
[00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:19.453]  That is the feudal lord's instinct in every culture, is to have the peasants a foot and a half shorter from generations of malnutrition, snot running out of their noses, digging around on a tiny piece of property they're allowed to produce, and most of it given to the king's men.
[00:25:20.899 --> 00:25:26.945]  The king has dependent soldiers who then police the peasants who produce the food for them.
[00:25:26.945 --> 00:25:28.907]  That's the government model.
[00:25:28.907 --> 00:25:30.628]  That's how it works.
[00:25:30.628 --> 00:25:40.698]  The Club of Rome, the UN, Ted Turner, Prince Philip, Prince Bernhardt, all of them say they want a post-industrial neo-feudal system.
[00:25:40.698 --> 00:25:41.839]  That's their word.
[00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:43.500]  Neo-feudalism, not mine.
[00:25:44.545 --> 00:25:46.566]  I'm credited as coining neo-feudalism.
[00:25:46.566 --> 00:25:48.047]  I did not.
[00:25:48.047 --> 00:25:57.573]  I coined neo-fascistic feudalism, or neo-feudal fascism.
[00:25:57.573 --> 00:26:04.356]  The point, I coined propaganda placement, years later they called it their own name, behavior placement.
[00:26:04.356 --> 00:26:07.138]  The brainwashing is what they call it.
[00:26:07.138 --> 00:26:09.780]  Sometimes they're just honest and say, we gotta brainwash the public.
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.681]  I'm the Attorney General, I've been meeting with the media about brainwashing people.
[00:26:12.681 --> 00:26:13.462]  We've gotta brainwash.
[00:26:14.161 --> 00:26:15.302]  Wanna play the brainwash clip again?
[00:26:15.302 --> 00:26:17.202]  You think I'm joking?
[00:26:17.202 --> 00:26:25.226]  I was listening again last night to these clips we've got where they're saying mercury's good for kids, lead's good for kids, China executes people for melamine in the milk.
[00:26:25.226 --> 00:26:28.067]  Here they just say, hey, your kid's dying, it's good for him.
[00:26:28.067 --> 00:26:38.492]  Again, it's reached this cuckoo level, but it's done on purpose to just overwhelm us and shock us until we can't even compute it anymore.
[00:26:45.578 --> 00:26:48.059]  This is the main issue that we're discussing.
[00:26:48.059 --> 00:26:52.581]  This is what we're talking about here.
[00:26:52.581 --> 00:27:07.827]  Is a bunch of crooks that real power isn't just having the biggest gun or the most powerful system of governance or houses or wealth.
[00:27:07.827 --> 00:27:13.389]  It's no one is allowed to even survive or eat if you say they can't.
[00:27:15.305 --> 00:27:27.750]  I mean, I'm going to get into this more later after Jim Tucker leaves us, and I am staggered by the information, but rural kids, parents angry about Labor Department rule banning farm chores.
[00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:33.933]  And I went and read the subsections, and sure enough, it's right there.
[00:27:33.933 --> 00:27:43.717]  It's a Rural Affairs Rural Council System under Department of Homeland Security, and
[00:27:44.554 --> 00:27:59.543]  The Department of Defense, and we've written articles about this in the past, that they're going to come in, harass the local farms, jail time for any dust off your field, no hay dust allowed, you're going to have to have chips on all your chickens and other farm animals, Big Agra is exempt.
[00:27:59.543 --> 00:28:01.784]  Big Agra is writing all this.
[00:28:01.784 --> 00:28:08.268]  And they go to the EPA and the FDA and the Department of Agriculture and they just have them write rules.
[00:28:08.968 --> 00:28:18.913]  And the bureaucrats are lawmaking outside of law and telling Congress, we'll do what we want even when Congress tells them not to.
[00:28:18.913 --> 00:28:20.254]  It's totally illegal.
[00:28:20.254 --> 00:28:23.916]  Just like Congress says, hey, you can't launch a war without congressional approval.
[00:28:23.916 --> 00:28:24.596]  You got to come to us.
[00:28:24.596 --> 00:28:25.997]  And Obama said, no, I don't.
[00:28:25.997 --> 00:28:28.018]  I got the U.N.
[00:28:28.018 --> 00:28:31.280]  The generals get before the senators, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:28:32.054 --> 00:28:33.334]  The SEC death.
[00:28:33.334 --> 00:28:37.635]  Secretary of Defense, and they say, hey, you gotta come to us to launch this Syria thing.
[00:28:37.635 --> 00:28:39.636]  You should have come to us on Libya.
[00:28:39.636 --> 00:28:41.856]  And they said, no, we don't come to you.
[00:28:41.856 --> 00:28:42.796]  We go to the UN.
[00:28:42.796 --> 00:28:45.097]  And the senator said, excuse me?
[00:28:45.097 --> 00:28:46.317]  That's unconstitutional.
[00:28:46.317 --> 00:28:47.417]  That's illegal.
[00:28:47.417 --> 00:28:55.739]  And Panetta just said, that's the way it is, Jack.
[00:28:55.739 --> 00:28:57.760]  And inside this MAP 21
[00:29:00.492 --> 00:29:02.174]  Transportation bill.
[00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:04.937]  The IRS can revoke your passport.
[00:29:04.937 --> 00:29:07.220]  The IRS can confiscate your guns.
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.762]  Just say you're not allowed to buy guns and have them taken.
[00:29:09.762 --> 00:29:11.404]  No law, no judge, no jury.
[00:29:11.404 --> 00:29:12.886]  They just say you're bad.
[00:29:12.886 --> 00:29:17.311]  That's the new news at InfoWars.com that nobody else is talking about, unfortunately.
[00:29:21.638 --> 00:29:23.219]  And it goes on.
[00:29:23.219 --> 00:29:27.161]  It allows DHS to use and pass around your tax returns.
[00:29:27.161 --> 00:29:30.904]  You know, presidents used to get in trouble for getting people's tax returns then leaking them.
[00:29:30.904 --> 00:29:37.988]  Now it says all the federal agencies get your tax return and can pass it out and give it to media, do whatever they want.
[00:29:37.988 --> 00:29:45.733]  And I mean, these are just, when you see these people on TV, these are known larcenous criminals, okay?
[00:29:45.733 --> 00:29:46.953]  They know they are.
[00:29:46.953 --> 00:29:48.814]  They hate this country.
[00:29:48.814 --> 00:29:49.375]  They hate you.
[00:29:50.031 --> 00:29:53.959]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.959 --> 00:29:56.624]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.757 --> 00:30:10.860]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal-Ben Soap Company.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.941]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[00:30:41.453 --> 00:30:43.434]  This is an amazing deal.
[00:30:43.434 --> 00:30:48.676]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.

[00:31:00.558 --> 00:31:05.101]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:05.101 --> 00:31:06.022]  Number one.
[00:31:06.022 --> 00:31:09.445]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.445 --> 00:31:10.305]  Number two.
[00:31:10.305 --> 00:31:15.189]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:15.189 --> 00:31:15.929]  It's true.
[00:31:15.929 --> 00:31:20.813]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.813 --> 00:31:21.634]  Number three.
[00:31:21.634 --> 00:31:25.216]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:28.919]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:29.119 --> 00:31:29.919]  Number four.
[00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:32.680]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.361]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:37.141]  Number five.
[00:31:37.141 --> 00:31:41.302]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:41.302 --> 00:31:46.344]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:46.344 --> 00:31:50.525]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:50.525 --> 00:31:52.306]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:57.227 --> 00:31:58.208]  877-327-0365.
[00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:04.131]  Right now, the average family spends one-fourth of their income on food.

[00:32:52.129 --> 00:32:54.129]  Start your journey of food independence today.
[00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:05.076]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:33:05.076 --> 00:33:05.997]  A lie!
[00:33:05.997 --> 00:33:07.998]  No man is obsolete!
[00:33:07.998 --> 00:33:09.879]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:33:09.879 --> 00:33:13.101]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[00:33:13.101 --> 00:33:18.565]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[00:33:18.565 --> 00:33:20.246]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:33:20.246 --> 00:33:21.327]  A crawling insect!
[00:33:21.987 --> 00:33:26.409]  Ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[00:33:26.409 --> 00:33:27.910]  I am a human being!
[00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:30.952]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:33:30.952 --> 00:33:33.633]  They have no substance and no dimension!
[00:33:33.633 --> 00:33:35.654]  Like air, like the wind!
[00:33:35.654 --> 00:33:36.795]  I don't care!
[00:33:36.795 --> 00:33:37.855]  I tell you, I don't care!
[00:33:37.855 --> 00:33:39.396]  I'm a human being!
[00:33:39.396 --> 00:33:40.036]  I exist!
[00:33:40.036 --> 00:33:42.578]  And if I speak one thought aloud...
[00:33:43.359 --> 00:33:47.101]  That thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[00:33:47.101 --> 00:33:50.263]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:33:50.263 --> 00:33:57.948]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[00:33:57.948 --> 00:34:05.013]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and mistake has no use for your kind!
[00:34:05.013 --> 00:34:09.096]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:09.096 --> 00:34:10.817]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:13.098 --> 00:34:20.363]  An iron curtain of media censorship of total surveillance is ascending across the Western world.
[00:34:20.363 --> 00:34:26.287]  A small coterie of private Federal Reserve Group banks has imploded Europe.
[00:34:26.287 --> 00:34:28.769]  It is now imploding the United States.
[00:34:28.769 --> 00:34:34.913]  The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and others admit the US and Europe are in a double-dip recession.
[00:34:34.913 --> 00:34:36.394]  It's actually a depression.
[00:34:36.394 --> 00:34:41.198]  Remember, we were pessimist porn dealers years ago explaining that we were in a depression
[00:34:42.938 --> 00:34:49.464]  At least a double-dip recession that we never even came out of, and that it was being done by design.
[00:34:49.464 --> 00:34:51.426]  We've been proven it right again.
[00:34:51.426 --> 00:34:56.030]  Coming up, Bill allows IRS to revoke Second Amendment rights by stealth.
[00:34:57.205 --> 00:35:10.996]  We have the subsection, it just gives the total dictatorial right to take gun permits away, to block you at the Knicks when you buy a gun through a gun shop, or to revoke your ownership and I guess dispatch.
[00:35:10.996 --> 00:35:16.101]  It just gives them carte blanche on page 1323 of the Transportation Legislation 21 map.
[00:35:23.601 --> 00:35:36.010]  Continuing, Bank of America has a war on the Second Amendment, telling major gun manufacturers they're closing their accounts because they do not believe in the civilian ownership of firearms under the U.N.
[00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:45.256]  Treaty that Obama is openly now saying if re-elected he will try to implement even if Congress won't ratify.
[00:35:45.256 --> 00:35:47.338]  The banks are already going with it.
[00:35:47.338 --> 00:35:48.179]  And of course they are.
[00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:50.220]  The Bank of America is part of the Federal Reserve.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.201]  It's part of the coup d'etat.
[00:35:52.365 --> 00:35:54.066]  Unbelievable information.
[00:35:54.066 --> 00:35:57.567]  And yes, one of the top stories in the country right now.
[00:35:57.567 --> 00:36:02.450]  The Department of Defense and Homeland Security with their new EnviroCorp.
[00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:07.012]  This is in the new rural commission that Obama set up last year.
[00:36:08.414 --> 00:36:09.515]  It's in there.
[00:36:09.515 --> 00:36:22.720]  Are now going to do spot inspections and if children are found doing any chores on farms, touching any raw materials, grains, seeds, eggs, milking cows, learning how to be on a farm.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.781]  That they're killing what's left.
[00:36:24.781 --> 00:36:28.343]  2% of our population is original farms.
[00:36:30.484 --> 00:36:31.105]  Small farms.
[00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:33.827]  2% of our population lives on small farms.
[00:36:33.827 --> 00:36:36.248]  They produce a small amount of our food now.
[00:36:36.248 --> 00:36:37.429]  It's Big Agra taking over.
[00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:39.150]  Big Agra's financing this.
[00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:42.393]  This is so devastating.
[00:36:42.393 --> 00:36:46.876]  This is directly out of what Stalin did in the Ukraine.
[00:36:46.876 --> 00:36:48.878]  And it's a big wake-up call to people.
[00:36:48.878 --> 00:36:54.862]  They're talking about $2,000 fines for dust from hay.
[00:36:54.862 --> 00:36:56.083]  But Big Agra is exempt.
[00:36:57.438 --> 00:36:59.479]  Total takeover.
[00:36:59.479 --> 00:37:01.040]  Total tyranny.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:01.881]  Arrested.
[00:37:01.881 --> 00:37:03.441]  Amish being arrested.
[00:37:03.441 --> 00:37:06.903]  Arrested for selling lemonade all over the country.
[00:37:06.903 --> 00:37:09.785]  Flea markets, Homeland Security raiding them.
[00:37:09.785 --> 00:37:11.586]  $15 million fines for garage sales.
[00:37:11.586 --> 00:37:12.387]  I'm not joking.
[00:37:12.387 --> 00:37:14.908]  That's AP Fox News.
[00:37:14.908 --> 00:37:17.810]  I mean, just total bureaucratic hell.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.563]  This is the new economy.
[00:37:20.563 --> 00:37:30.779]  The big megacorporations and banks want America shut down so we fully implode, so they can buy it up, get everybody on welfare, everybody working for a megacorporation or government.
[00:37:30.779 --> 00:37:32.081]  This is the new world order.
[00:37:33.427 --> 00:37:34.868]  And this has always been their plan.
[00:37:34.868 --> 00:37:41.354]  Jim Tucker, author of the Bilderberg Diary, 36 years covering Bilderberg, forcing it out in the news.
[00:37:41.354 --> 00:37:53.926]  I wanted to get you on about the Washington Post last week, who, as you pointed out, always attends every year and never reports on it, admitting Bilderberg's real and admitting that they basically vet vice presidents like Arubio.
[00:37:55.638 --> 00:38:05.985]  Incredible on that front, but of course the big news, sir, InfoWars.com, and this is what intel sources like Gosling, who's been accurate in the past, are saying.
[00:38:05.985 --> 00:38:14.010]  They have shut it down for the three days in May 31st to the 3rd, so four days of June.
[00:38:15.328 --> 00:38:22.331]  The Chantilly, Virginia, where you and I were there, where Obama was knighted, Supreme Leader and Hillary stepped down, and the media wouldn't cover it.
[00:38:22.331 --> 00:38:23.651]  We were there.
[00:38:23.651 --> 00:38:28.053]  Secretive Bilderberg Group set to meet in Virginia May 31st, June 3rd.
[00:38:28.053 --> 00:38:31.735]  Jim Tucker of AmericanFreePress.net joins us.
[00:38:32.976 --> 00:38:37.840]  And to tell us if his intel can either confirm or deny this situation.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.201]  Let's cover that first.
[00:38:39.201 --> 00:38:40.922]  Jim, you're there in Virginia.
[00:38:40.922 --> 00:38:42.824]  You're there in D.C.
[00:38:42.824 --> 00:38:43.784]  or close by.
[00:38:43.784 --> 00:38:46.367]  You work there at the paper that's in D.C.
[00:38:46.367 --> 00:38:49.369]  What is your intel, Jim Tucker?
[00:38:49.369 --> 00:39:00.158]  I am 99% sure that the meeting will be, as you said, May 31, June 3, at the Westfield Marriott, where they met just three years ago.
[00:39:02.799 --> 00:39:26.857]  Tony Gosselin and others, I think it was Tony Gosselin who tried to make a reservation for just one person, just one, and he said he's from Europe, they understood that from his telephone call of course, and he'd like to visit Washington and stay at the Westfields on any weekend in May or June.
[00:39:26.857 --> 00:39:29.399]  Would he have trouble getting reservations for one?
[00:39:29.399 --> 00:39:30.400]  And their answer was,
[00:39:32.048 --> 00:39:36.030]  They're all filled up May 31 to June 3rd.
[00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:42.912]  They can't even take one more reservation for those dates.
[00:39:42.912 --> 00:39:45.293]  But every other weekend is okay.
[00:39:45.293 --> 00:39:49.335]  That and other information coming together makes me 99% sure.
[00:39:49.335 --> 00:40:00.960]  The reason I say 99% is because we've been unable to get our certain Congressman who had been friendly before and would find out for us to confirm it.
[00:40:01.673 --> 00:40:02.273]  We're good to go.
[00:40:24.659 --> 00:40:31.470]  99% odds are very heavy odds and I'll be very surprised if we don't find them at Chantilly.
[00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.594]  So, let's get Patrick to start moving.
[00:40:34.639 --> 00:40:37.360]  Well, Jim, didn't they meet almost four years ago?
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.102]  It'll be four years this June on the campaign trail there.
[00:40:41.102 --> 00:40:43.623]  Hillary and Obama disappeared for a day.
[00:40:43.623 --> 00:40:45.464]  We saw the Secret Service, the motorcades.
[00:40:45.464 --> 00:40:46.544]  We knew they were there.
[00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:48.325]  Your sources confirmed it.
[00:40:48.325 --> 00:40:49.666]  But the media wouldn't cover it.
[00:40:49.666 --> 00:40:51.787]  That shows how controlled they are.
[00:40:51.787 --> 00:40:53.307]  And I want to get into that in a moment.
[00:40:53.307 --> 00:40:56.789]  But didn't they meet there in 2002 and then again in 2008?
[00:40:56.789 --> 00:41:01.091]  So they've met at that hotel twice, haven't they?
[00:41:02.208 --> 00:41:08.950]  I have to pull out my book and double check on it, but they definitely met there.
[00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:18.974]  I think it was after Obama was president-elect, after he won the election, but before
[00:41:21.033 --> 00:41:23.835]  Before the, uh, square again.
[00:41:23.835 --> 00:41:24.075]  No?
[00:41:24.075 --> 00:41:24.795]  Yes.
[00:41:24.795 --> 00:41:26.136]  No, it was, uh, sure, Sherry.
[00:41:26.136 --> 00:41:27.097]  It was right before that.
[00:41:27.097 --> 00:41:28.617]  It was whenever Hillary stepped down.
[00:41:28.617 --> 00:41:30.198]  She stepped down there at Bilderberg.
[00:41:30.198 --> 00:41:31.059]  Uh, so you're right.
[00:41:31.059 --> 00:41:36.322]  But, uh, Jim, going back here, uh, cause I believe they were also there, uh, a few years before that.
[00:41:36.322 --> 00:41:38.083]  They do come here every four years.
[00:41:38.083 --> 00:41:39.664]  It's generally in Virginia.
[00:41:39.664 --> 00:41:41.045]  It's close to the airport there.
[00:41:41.045 --> 00:41:43.846]  Uh, you and I, of course, were there, uh, four years ago.
[00:41:43.846 --> 00:41:45.867]  It'll be four years ago this, this June.
[00:41:45.867 --> 00:41:46.688]  I will be there.
[00:41:47.348 --> 00:41:54.090]  But aren't we learning of its location a little bit earlier this year than we normally do?
[00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.111]  It's rather a big deal.
[00:41:56.111 --> 00:42:02.193]  There's times when I found out in January and February where they're going to be.
[00:42:02.193 --> 00:42:16.077]  There's one notable occasion where we're desperate to not find them, and I got a call from the American Free Press saying, grab your other pair of socks, pack your own, you're flying to France today.
[00:42:17.322 --> 00:42:20.763]  Uh, they'd already made the flights for me and all that stuff.
[00:42:20.763 --> 00:42:23.204]  Uh, they just found out just in time.
[00:42:23.204 --> 00:42:26.465]  It got that close once, so it's been all variations in between.
[00:42:26.465 --> 00:42:33.828]  And then, uh, old sources start to die, and then we have to buy new sources.
[00:42:33.828 --> 00:42:36.909]  So that complicates the whole issue too.
[00:42:36.909 --> 00:42:41.931]  But, as I say, 99% are very good odds, so we better, uh, get there.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:51.682]  I was interested in your comments about the big farmers taking over, and you're absolutely correct.
[00:42:51.682 --> 00:42:59.363]  That's why Archer Daniels Midland has had executives at his Billingburg meetings for years and years and years.
[00:42:59.363 --> 00:43:06.765]  And it does fit their program to equalize the economies of the world.
[00:43:08.926 --> 00:43:30.346]  The developed nations, that they call prosperous nations, should pour money... undeveloped nations, that they call poor nations, all these euphemisms, and our standard of living should go down, the third world standard of living should go up, until we're all equally on a median standard of living.
[00:43:32.521 --> 00:43:33.782]  Throughout the world.
[00:43:33.782 --> 00:43:34.883]  That's their goal.
[00:43:48.632 --> 00:43:52.493]  I don't think I can express myself in a way that would suit polite society.
[00:43:52.493 --> 00:43:53.513]  I would just say I'm outraged.
[00:44:16.685 --> 00:44:17.986]  Unbelievable treason.
[00:44:17.986 --> 00:44:21.829]  Sir, what do you make of the Washington Post last week coming out?
[00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:23.310]  I mean, the significance of this.
[00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:36.379]  You've always pointed out they run defense and offense for Bilderberg, being the chosen media for 60 years to be at Bilderberg, to have them come out and go, yeah, Bilderberg pretty much picks vice presidents and presidents.
[00:44:36.379 --> 00:44:44.304]  Yeah, Rubio's going down to Columbia so he can up his cred for the Bilderberg meeting coming up for VP with Romney.
[00:44:44.304 --> 00:44:45.625]  I mean, that is amazing.
[00:44:45.925 --> 00:44:47.586]  What does that signify?
[00:44:47.586 --> 00:44:48.786]  I'm going to find out tomorrow.
[00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:56.168]  The reason I say this, my home is actually 70 miles out in Orange County, Virginia from Washington.
[00:44:56.168 --> 00:45:00.229]  And I've worked mostly for my home emailing and that kind of jazz.
[00:45:00.229 --> 00:45:07.412]  I'm in Arlington today because of the speech I have to make in Memphis tomorrow.
[00:45:07.412 --> 00:45:09.872]  I have to fly to Memphis tomorrow.
[00:45:14.292 --> 00:45:14.612]  I don't know.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:40.901]  In addition to a bar, they really and truly have a library at the Press Club.
[00:45:40.901 --> 00:45:57.885]  They have some magic they can play, because I can always say, I want the biggest search of possible, for any newspaper, use the term Trilateral Commission, or a Bilderberg, say from April 1st until the present moment.
[00:45:57.885 --> 00:46:04.527]  And they've got this big giant gizmo, and it's always weekly, biggest daily, the periodicals
[00:46:06.242 --> 00:46:12.284]  No, no, I understand that you're not an internet guy, so you haven't read the full Washington Post yet.
[00:46:12.284 --> 00:46:12.925]  Let me give it to you.
[00:46:12.925 --> 00:46:13.725]  It's last week.
[00:46:13.725 --> 00:46:14.845]  It's Al Kamen.
[00:46:14.845 --> 00:46:18.326]  I've got a fitting name, a little crocodile in the New World Order.
[00:46:18.326 --> 00:46:22.468]  And it says, in the loop, shout at a dictator, get some VP cred.
[00:46:23.468 --> 00:46:29.830]  And then it goes on in the article to say, yeah, Bilderberg picks presidents and VPs and looks like a Rubio.
[00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:32.791]  You know, he's the only senator going down to the meeting.
[00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:37.252]  And he says Little Bird told him it's for Bilderberg to try to up his cred.
[00:46:37.252 --> 00:46:38.552]  So that's right there in the article.
[00:46:38.552 --> 00:46:39.513]  You can scroll down and read it.
[00:46:41.781 --> 00:46:43.742]  Guys, scroll back up to the top so I can give Jim the date.
[00:46:43.742 --> 00:46:44.062]  Thank you.
[00:46:44.062 --> 00:46:47.304]  Again, we're showing this to PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:48.485]  Just shrink it down, guys.
[00:46:48.485 --> 00:46:49.625]  You can just give me the date.
[00:46:49.625 --> 00:46:50.966]  Thank you.
[00:46:50.966 --> 00:46:52.747]  I'll give you the date here in just a second, Jim.
[00:46:52.747 --> 00:46:53.347]  Okay.
[00:46:53.347 --> 00:46:54.648]  Or guys, just print it for me.
[00:46:54.648 --> 00:46:55.909]  April 11th.
[00:46:55.909 --> 00:46:56.829]  April 11th.
[00:46:56.829 --> 00:46:58.130]  April 11th.
[00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:02.972]  Okay, I'll read that tomorrow when I get to the press club.
[00:47:02.972 --> 00:47:06.174]  I'll make sure that's... I would have gotten it anyway, but I'll make sure I get it.
[00:47:07.551 --> 00:47:09.312]  I mean, what do you make of that, though?
[00:47:09.312 --> 00:47:10.912]  I mean, I just read it to you.
[00:47:10.912 --> 00:47:17.874]  Why would they go from saying it didn't exist and you were insane and New York Times said it didn't exist and that we were there four years ago?
[00:47:17.874 --> 00:47:29.498]  The New York Times said I was there at Chantilly with you, literally hallucinating, in a park, and that there was no helicopters, Marines in plainclothes, Secret Service, machine guns.
[00:47:29.498 --> 00:47:31.059]  We've got it all on tape.
[00:47:31.059 --> 00:47:34.360]  You know, foreign leaders with their national anthem being played.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.320]  It didn't exist, Jim.
[00:47:36.408 --> 00:47:37.829]  Well we just had a mirage.
[00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:42.172]  Yeah, we're insane!
[00:47:42.172 --> 00:47:47.716]  But down at Puskins Forever State we did too, write a report on Dillard Burke.
[00:47:47.716 --> 00:47:52.000]  They've done that on a number of other stories they don't like over the years.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.744]  I think Sophie was the very last edition, and maybe not even the whole last edition, probably called Chasing It.
[00:48:00.001 --> 00:48:07.685]  But look at the condescension saying it doesn't exist while the editor... Tell folks about the Washington Post and the connection to Bilderberg.
[00:48:07.685 --> 00:48:14.729]  Well, the Washington Post was involved in establishing Bilderberg in 1954.
[00:48:14.729 --> 00:48:26.135]  Now these bankers and international financiers and politicians had been meeting for four centuries.
[00:48:26.135 --> 00:48:27.795]  But didn't they decide we've got to meet?
[00:48:29.628 --> 00:48:30.368]  We're good to go.
[00:48:57.082 --> 00:48:58.462]  I have that meeting.
[00:48:58.462 --> 00:49:09.985]  He shot himself in his bathtub a few years later and then Mrs. Graham came out of the kitchen, literally, as a housewife and became publisher.
[00:49:09.985 --> 00:49:20.227]  Well, they had such a big staff, at least they did then, that anybody's little sister could be publisher because she had that big heavy executive staff that can actually run the newspaper.
[00:49:20.227 --> 00:49:22.087]  So she attended.
[00:49:22.087 --> 00:49:24.188]  Then she started taking her little boy Donald Graham with her.
[00:49:25.322 --> 00:49:32.332]  And then she decided to die, and Donald Grimes has attended every meeting since then.
[00:49:32.332 --> 00:49:35.898]  Never misses a meeting, never reports on it either.
[00:49:35.898 --> 00:49:40.244]  We've identified and photographed her at every meeting they've had.
[00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:53.961]  Well I'm going to say this, I'm coming up there in my InfoWars bus and I want people to join me along the way and I want 10,000 people there at this event.
[00:49:53.961 --> 00:49:56.323]  I want 10,000 people there.
[00:49:56.323 --> 00:49:58.525]  This is the real group to protest.
[00:49:59.065 --> 00:50:03.232]  When they have their public G20 meetings, they shut down Chicago, they shut down everything.
[00:50:03.232 --> 00:50:12.448]  We're Americans, we're going to go protest the parasites who, as you've said Jim, want to bankrupt everybody so we're so poor we can't even protest them.
[00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:34.603]  Yeah, they'll have a heavy debate on European, this year, well as you usually have every year, on the Europeans, Europe's economic problems, demanding more money from the United States, then Obama will pretend he's not going to do it, then he'll do it.
[00:50:35.323 --> 00:50:37.765]  Uh, as far as, as far as money, Europe is concerned.
[00:50:37.765 --> 00:50:38.445]  Absolutely.
[00:50:38.445 --> 00:50:38.905]  Stay there.
[00:50:38.905 --> 00:50:41.547]  One more segment with Jim Tucker and then he's gotta go.
[00:50:41.547 --> 00:50:45.449]  And then we're going to open the phones up.
[00:50:45.449 --> 00:50:47.210]  And I got a surprise in the second hour.
[00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.970]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:50.712]  And then we've got Dr. Joseph Marcola joining us.
[00:50:50.712 --> 00:50:51.653]  That's a big guest.
[00:50:51.653 --> 00:50:52.973]  Hard to get him on.
[00:50:52.973 --> 00:50:55.355]  He's joining us for a full hour via video Skype.
[00:50:55.355 --> 00:50:57.576]  In the third hour, the radio transmission.
[00:50:57.576 --> 00:50:58.376]  Today!
[00:50:58.376 --> 00:50:58.997]  Stay with us!
[00:51:00.931 --> 00:51:06.433]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:51:06.433 --> 00:51:08.854]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:51:08.854 --> 00:51:17.957]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:51:17.957 --> 00:51:21.398]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:51:21.398 --> 00:51:23.078]  There's no priming required.
[00:51:23.078 --> 00:51:25.359]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:51:25.359 --> 00:51:27.860]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.441]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:31.861]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:51:31.861 --> 00:51:35.042]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:51:35.042 --> 00:51:38.424]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:51:38.424 --> 00:51:42.565]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:51:42.565 --> 00:51:45.306]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:51:45.306 --> 00:51:46.867]  It's what my family uses.
[00:51:46.867 --> 00:51:50.188]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[00:52:00.492 --> 00:52:02.133]  Hey there, you've reached Claire.
[00:52:02.133 --> 00:52:03.533]  Leave me a message.
[00:52:03.533 --> 00:52:04.814]  Claire, it's Anne.
[00:52:04.814 --> 00:52:07.775]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product we talked about before?
[00:52:07.775 --> 00:52:08.835]  The all-natural one.
[00:52:08.835 --> 00:52:09.296]  Ambrin?
[00:52:09.296 --> 00:52:10.736]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[00:52:10.736 --> 00:52:18.179]  Not only did Ambrin stop my hot flashes, but since I started the Ambrin program, I have lost so much weight.
[00:52:18.179 --> 00:52:20.000]  Seriously, even my belly fat.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:20.520]  It's gone.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.001]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[00:52:23.001 --> 00:52:23.662]  I feel great.
[00:52:23.662 --> 00:52:24.322]  Give me a call.
[00:52:24.462 --> 00:52:28.123]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[00:52:28.123 --> 00:52:31.903]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[00:52:31.903 --> 00:52:36.324]  Ambarin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off.
[00:52:36.324 --> 00:52:38.485]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[00:52:38.485 --> 00:52:41.565]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[00:52:41.565 --> 00:52:46.006]  So with your hormones in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.

[00:52:58.254 --> 00:53:00.296]  1-800-510-3558.
[00:53:00.296 --> 00:53:05.522]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:53:44.312 --> 00:53:47.693]  I can't tell you how much I look forward to shaking Jim Tucker's hand again.
[00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:17.812]  Maybe have a nice cold brew with him at the bar.
[00:54:17.812 --> 00:54:23.776]  He is a real piece of work, a true character, a true patriot, and we love him.
[00:54:23.776 --> 00:54:25.117]  AmericanFreePress.net.
[00:54:25.117 --> 00:54:25.858]  And I am going.
[00:54:25.858 --> 00:54:28.379]  I mean, we're going to keep our intel on this.
[00:54:28.379 --> 00:54:31.322]  We'll know for sure soon.
[00:54:31.322 --> 00:54:36.585]  But I'm, like you said, 99% that it's in Chantilly, where they met twice before.
[00:54:36.585 --> 00:54:38.647]  I'm going to be there.
[00:54:38.647 --> 00:54:41.609]  The annex you see in the Obama deception, I'm sure will be replayed.
[00:54:43.866 --> 00:54:49.110]  And the Feds don't need to have people break in our rooms or do anything to us or try to get us to commit acts of violence.
[00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:55.535]  We're planning to peacefully cover the event and destroy the Bilderberg Group with info weapons.
[00:54:55.535 --> 00:54:57.517]  The pen is mightier than the sword.
[00:54:57.517 --> 00:54:58.758]  And I'm on the defense.
[00:54:58.758 --> 00:54:59.999]  I want my country back.
[00:54:59.999 --> 00:55:01.580]  I don't want to be usurped.
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.122]  I want farm kids to be able to do chores with their parents.
[00:55:05.418 --> 00:55:09.744]  Because they're saying they want to ban chores in the house and have kids go to the state and divorce the parents.
[00:55:09.744 --> 00:55:11.186]  This is the end of parental rights.
[00:55:11.186 --> 00:55:12.768]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[00:55:12.768 --> 00:55:16.273]  Jim, you grew up on a cotton farm, didn't you?
[00:55:16.273 --> 00:55:19.518]  Yes, I'm a certified redneck.
[00:55:19.518 --> 00:55:20.739]  You picked cotton with your hands.
[00:55:24.847 --> 00:55:36.530]  But, uh, it comes to mind now, it is so important that Obama not have another four years of inhibited because he'll not have to run again to, uh, ruin this country.
[00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:40.211]  Uh, the boy is a self-avowed communist.
[00:55:40.211 --> 00:55:48.833]  He called himself a communist because he's 40 years old, but he announced to the state senate he had, uh, these screwballs who had
[00:55:52.378 --> 00:56:00.686]  It's worse than that.
[00:56:00.686 --> 00:56:01.827]  It's in the New York Times.
[00:56:01.827 --> 00:56:04.489]  He says, I can't wait to get re-elected.
[00:56:04.489 --> 00:56:06.030]  That's the headline.
[00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:10.214]  I'm going to be a dictator and use executive orders and bypass Congress.
[00:56:10.214 --> 00:56:14.778]  He said, I can't wait to get re-elected and quote, bypass Congress.
[00:56:14.778 --> 00:56:16.480]  I mean, it's really happening, Jim.
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:45.631]  Yes, and this country's going to be in very bad shape if that self-avowed communist, he's not calling himself a communist under political pressures, bad politics, but he was in his forties when they were still gathering around him and he tried to appoint some of them to the government positions and then his, the adults around him, although left-wing Democrats say, you don't dare do that.
[00:56:46.634 --> 00:56:50.915]  But again, the mega-bankers want communism to suck out our wealth.
[00:56:50.915 --> 00:56:52.835]  They're exempt from the taxes.
[00:56:52.835 --> 00:56:55.316]  Like GE, they transfer it overseas.
[00:56:55.316 --> 00:56:56.636]  That's the new older plan.
[00:56:56.636 --> 00:56:58.456]  Jim, we've only got two minutes left.
[00:56:58.456 --> 00:57:02.817]  Any new intel on Bilderberg this year, and what's on their agenda?
[00:57:02.817 --> 00:57:09.579]  Well, heavily, of course, the economic crisis, and they're going to have problems with Britain.
[00:57:09.579 --> 00:57:15.900]  Now, we can't always say great things about Britain, but in this case,
[00:57:16.798 --> 00:57:18.820]  We're good to go.
[00:57:36.224 --> 00:57:37.887]  And she refused.
[00:57:37.887 --> 00:57:39.569]  She had nothing to say.
[00:57:39.569 --> 00:57:41.111]  And they never invited her back.
[00:57:41.111 --> 00:57:51.445]  And then they got a trapeze artist from her own party to run against her and defeat her for the job of Prime Minister.
[00:57:52.527 --> 00:57:54.368]  They're that powerful.
[00:57:54.368 --> 00:58:06.616]  But I had the pleasure of talking to her informally at a cocktail party at a press club about a year later, and I asked her reaction to being denounced by Bilderberg, and she said, she used the word tribute.
[00:58:06.616 --> 00:58:14.201]  It's just a rough paraphrase, but she said, uh, tribute to being denounced by Bilderberg, any organization that was
[00:58:16.282 --> 00:58:18.143]  Take away one ounce of sovereignty.
[00:58:18.143 --> 00:58:19.924]  We are all far allies.
[00:58:19.924 --> 00:58:23.905]  We are part of NATO and other allies.
[00:58:23.905 --> 00:58:28.027]  We do not surrender one bit of sovereignty to a world government.
[00:58:28.027 --> 00:58:28.987]  Not one bit.
[00:58:28.987 --> 00:58:29.607]  Amazing.
[00:58:29.607 --> 00:58:34.489]  Jim Tucker, we're going to be seeing you in person in Virginia for Bilderberg 2012.
[00:58:34.489 --> 00:58:37.170]  I'll be there and we'll talk to you before then.
[00:58:37.170 --> 00:58:38.170]  Thank you, sir.
[00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:38.691]  You're welcome.

[01:00:05.492 --> 01:00:10.338]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.338 --> 01:00:11.920]  You want answers?

[01:00:25.091 --> 01:00:31.115]  I tell you, we really are assembling a dream team of great crew members out there.
[01:00:31.115 --> 01:00:36.700]  And I haven't even played on the radio clips of all these amazing reporter contest submissions coming in.
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:42.544]  And you've got like six days or so to get your submission in.
[01:00:42.544 --> 01:00:45.426]  Man, a lot of them are impressive.
[01:00:45.426 --> 01:00:51.430]  And everybody that's tried has done a great job just by taking action and you reach out to people on important issues that you're covering.
[01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.212]  But it's going to be hard to choose the two winners.
[01:00:54.787 --> 01:00:57.748]  One male and one female reporter.
[01:00:57.748 --> 01:01:01.590]  Guys, what's that URL again for people to see all the submissions, the hundreds of videos?
[01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:09.393]  It's InfoWars.com.
[01:01:09.393 --> 01:01:14.375]  You know what, just print that out for me so I can give that out to people on there.
[01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:19.037]  I mean, we link every day to new submissions that are coming in.
[01:01:19.037 --> 01:01:19.617]  Here's the deal.
[01:01:21.462 --> 01:01:30.006]  We're going to open the phones up right now, again for first-time callers, and I would like to hear from you.
[01:01:30.006 --> 01:01:45.294]  Are you concerned that the Rural Affairs Council, set up by executive order under the Department of Defense and Homeland Security, administered by the military and Homeland Security, with the new EnviroPolice, I mean, they're going to come give you fines for dust from hay.
[01:01:45.294 --> 01:01:46.894]  This is on record, I'm not joking.
[01:01:46.894 --> 01:01:47.635]  And take your property.
[01:01:48.698 --> 01:01:59.921]  And you can go, well, Big Pharma next door, Big Agra next door is, you know, got three million chickens in there with lice all over them and chemical waste, and they're like, they're exempt.
[01:01:59.921 --> 01:02:02.422]  We're coming on your property without warrants.
[01:02:02.422 --> 01:02:03.702]  We're taking whatever we want.
[01:02:03.702 --> 01:02:07.763]  I mean, they treat you, they're now armed, by the way.
[01:02:07.763 --> 01:02:13.665]  And if they see your child watering the grass, picking strawberries, doing any farm work,
[01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:21.254]  This is dealing with any of the raw materials from hay to grain to slopping the pigs.
[01:02:21.254 --> 01:02:21.994]  That's it.
[01:02:21.994 --> 01:02:23.215]  You're in labor violation.
[01:02:23.215 --> 01:02:23.895]  You're going to be fine.
[01:02:23.895 --> 01:02:25.496]  You're going to go to jail.
[01:02:25.496 --> 01:02:34.622]  There's no law because the laws they pass say the Department of Agriculture is God.
[01:02:34.622 --> 01:02:39.845]  Here is the URL, Infowars.com forward slash reporter dash contest.
[01:02:41.414 --> 01:02:44.575]  So it's InfoWars.com forward slash reporter dash contest.
[01:02:44.575 --> 01:02:48.637]  And don't forget those red links up at the top of InfoWars.com.
[01:02:48.637 --> 01:02:52.918]  Breaking news and right next to it, top stories.
[01:02:52.918 --> 01:02:59.401]  Key links, because I'm realizing one blind spot, Lister's pointed out, his incredible news just rolls off the site.
[01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:03.022]  People don't click on the featured archive, they don't click on the little RSS feed link.
[01:03:03.022 --> 01:03:04.182]  It's all there.
[01:03:04.182 --> 01:03:09.204]  Everything as it breaks in the RSS feed, you can subscribe to it right there as well.
[01:03:09.204 --> 01:03:10.985]  And then right next to it, top stories.

[01:03:15.439 --> 01:03:19.179]  So important, those two links.

[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:24.401]  But I think people are starting to realize, wow, Alex Jones wasn't trying to be shocking.
[01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:24.621]  No, no, no.
[01:03:34.653 --> 01:03:49.105]  When I went and witnessed urban warfare drills with the Marines trained to take our guns, with role players who say they're from America, and trained to put you on your knees and shoot you in the back of the head, and they're trained to fight the American militia.
[01:03:49.105 --> 01:03:51.107]  And when I saw things like that, you know what?
[01:03:51.107 --> 01:03:55.350]  It really changed my perspective.
[01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:56.671]  And I've seen a lot more since then.
[01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:58.072]  And let me tell you something.
[01:03:58.072 --> 01:03:59.974]  It's worse than I'm saying.
[01:03:59.974 --> 01:04:03.517]  And the only hope we've got is to really wake up to how crazy stuff is.
[01:04:04.997 --> 01:04:06.178]  Get those chills again.
[01:04:06.178 --> 01:04:09.600]  I mean, you can just feel that they're getting ready to nuke a city or something.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:15.503]  I mean, I used to get chills once a week when I've thought about something and just, oh, danger, Will Robinson.
[01:04:15.503 --> 01:04:21.566]  Now it's just like, I mean, it's just, oh, I mean, I mean, it's like sixth sense.
[01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:24.868]  It's like, whoa, whoa, Warren people, whoa.
[01:04:24.868 --> 01:04:26.228]  I mean, they're getting everything lined up.
[01:04:26.228 --> 01:04:34.353]  The reason they're announcing all this is they're getting all the bureaucrats, all the armed gangs of federal and state and local millions ready and telling them, yeah, we secretly arrest people now.
[01:04:34.713 --> 01:04:35.953]  We secretly execute them.
[01:04:35.953 --> 01:04:36.994]  We spy on them.
[01:04:36.994 --> 01:04:38.614]  Yeah, we take their farms.
[01:04:38.614 --> 01:04:41.675]  Everybody stands there at attention, and they're going, OK, we do that now?
[01:04:41.675 --> 01:04:43.415]  Everybody's like, yep, we do that now.
[01:04:43.415 --> 01:04:46.176]  We arrest people for filming us in public and give them life in prison.
[01:04:46.176 --> 01:04:48.397]  The cops are like, OK, all right.
[01:04:48.397 --> 01:04:52.318]  They're just getting everybody ready for total war against the American people.

[01:04:53.398 --> 01:04:54.619]  They're buying five million guns a month.

[01:06:59.302 --> 01:07:01.764]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:01.764 --> 01:07:07.350]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:12.375]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:07:12.375 --> 01:07:12.856]  It's true.
[01:07:12.856 --> 01:07:17.421]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:07:17.941 --> 01:07:23.163]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:07:23.163 --> 01:07:30.265]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:07:30.265 --> 01:07:31.385]  And here's the best part.
[01:07:31.385 --> 01:07:37.747]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:07:44.832 --> 01:07:48.075]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:07:48.075 --> 01:07:49.816]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:08:00.967 --> 01:08:06.391]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.391 --> 01:08:13.976]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:13.976 --> 01:08:17.859]  We are into hour number two.
[01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:19.239]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:19.239 --> 01:08:22.482]  Your phone calls are coming up throughout the hour.
[01:08:22.482 --> 01:08:25.023]  Then we have Dr. Marcola, always informative, joining us.
[01:08:25.023 --> 01:08:26.504]  He's been on with us for years.
[01:08:26.504 --> 01:08:28.986]  In the third hour to cover some big breaking news.
[01:08:28.986 --> 01:08:29.987]  Health, freedom, you name it.
[01:08:32.588 --> 01:08:45.331]  When you see stories like this in MSNBC, Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, and they report it like it's no big deal and cute.
[01:08:45.331 --> 01:08:46.432]  It's shocking.
[01:08:46.432 --> 01:08:49.392]  And you add it together with everything else that's happening.
[01:08:49.392 --> 01:08:52.153]  I've always wanted to tell myself, oh, it's moving incrementally.
[01:08:52.153 --> 01:08:54.214]  We'll have time to battle it.
[01:08:54.214 --> 01:08:55.834]  We'll have time to reverse it.
[01:08:55.834 --> 01:08:59.495]  Well, the globalists know that liberty has grown and the awakening has accelerated.
[01:09:01.431 --> 01:09:08.714]  To such a great extent that they're going to go ahead and just have to totally take over.
[01:09:08.714 --> 01:09:11.436]  That's why they're saying, yeah, we're going to shut down free speech.
[01:09:11.436 --> 01:09:13.557]  Yeah, we probably will shut down talk radio.
[01:09:13.557 --> 01:09:15.218]  Yeah, we will secretly arrest citizens.
[01:09:15.218 --> 01:09:17.278]  Yeah, we do have the CIA watching citizens.
[01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:24.262]  Yeah, you know, the smart meters will control what goes on inside your house.
[01:09:24.262 --> 01:09:26.503]  That's just the way it is.
[01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:28.399]  And you know what?
[01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.580]  Foreign banks are going to run America.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:32.021]  And you are going to pay carbon taxes.
[01:09:32.021 --> 01:09:33.201]  And you know what?
[01:09:33.201 --> 01:09:38.483]  Family farms are going to get inspected and we're going to shut you down for no reason and not let your kids do chores.
[01:09:38.483 --> 01:09:38.863]  And you know what?
[01:09:38.863 --> 01:09:46.566]  We're going to give your kids shots and take their DNA without parental consent, without warrants.
[01:09:46.566 --> 01:09:47.746]  I mean, just everywhere.
[01:09:47.746 --> 01:09:49.587]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:09:49.587 --> 01:09:51.508]  And, you know, I see these articles.
[01:09:53.083 --> 01:09:54.345]  This is out of MSNBC.
[01:09:54.345 --> 01:09:55.507]  They're very excited.
[01:09:55.507 --> 01:09:58.131]  Obama can't hardly wait is the headline.
[01:09:58.131 --> 01:10:04.360]  The New York Times examines how Obama is using his executive powers as he faces a Congress blocking many of his initiatives.
[01:10:05.379 --> 01:10:14.185]  Oh, and it just goes on to say that he can't wait till he gets re-elected, it has the quotes here, so he can do whatever he wants.
[01:10:14.185 --> 01:10:19.489]  What do you call that when you do whatever you want?
[01:10:19.489 --> 01:10:23.912]  The law, the Constitution, says you go to Congress to launch a war.
[01:10:25.649 --> 01:10:35.638]  Obama says, not only will I launch a war, which is what Julius Caesar did, it's what Hitler did, it's what dictators do, but I'm going to do it under the UN command.
[01:10:35.638 --> 01:10:38.580]  It's even beyond having a dictator.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.523]  It's a foreign puppet dictator.
[01:10:41.523 --> 01:10:44.426]  A viceroy.
[01:10:44.426 --> 01:10:49.890]  An imperial legate.
[01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:51.532]  A total power puppet.
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:57.641]  And again, the fact that they're starting to hide all this in plain view means they're getting ready to do it all.
[01:10:57.641 --> 01:10:59.442]  I mean, look what they're already doing.
[01:10:59.442 --> 01:11:02.342]  I mean, it is May Day now.
[01:11:02.342 --> 01:11:04.543]  I've always said, oh, a few more years, we're building it up.
[01:11:04.543 --> 01:11:06.363]  No, I guess we're here.
[01:11:06.363 --> 01:11:11.325]  And let me tell you, to launch all this, they're going to have to have some false flags.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.321]  They're going to be bad.
[01:11:14.321 --> 01:11:23.045]  They're going to kill a lot of people and it's going to be hard to see the killers, the people that did this, who even write memos about how a terror attack will make them look like heroes.
[01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:24.546]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:37.292]  With the establishment whore media up there going along with the official story and shutting down websites like Infowars.com and you better believe DrudgeReport.com and others when they pull the trigger.
[01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:41.835]  The only way to beat this is to admit we have a criminal foreign banker run government
[01:11:42.558 --> 01:11:52.141]  Everybody who said I was wrong now admit I was right, that I wasn't radical, I studied history, I was correct, and you're going to have to quote get radical.
[01:11:52.141 --> 01:12:03.064]  You meet radical globalist eugenicist power grabbers who are involved in a corporate police state internal coup d'etat against the country by being radical.
[01:12:04.045 --> 01:12:05.045]  It's not radical.
[01:12:05.045 --> 01:12:08.227]  The system tells you it's radical to be into guns.
[01:12:08.227 --> 01:12:09.267]  That's just America.
[01:12:09.267 --> 01:12:11.609]  They tell you it's radical to be pro-family.
[01:12:11.609 --> 01:12:17.251]  Or it's radical for the man to be the head of the household, when that's what makes women happy to begin with.
[01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:18.432]  All the studies show.
[01:12:18.432 --> 01:12:21.633]  They tell you that normalcy is radical.
[01:12:21.633 --> 01:12:22.894]  Raw milk is radical.
[01:12:22.894 --> 01:12:25.075]  Mother's milk is radical and bad.
[01:12:25.075 --> 01:12:26.696]  They, ugh, dirty.
[01:12:26.696 --> 01:12:31.198]  But some high fructose corn syrup poison, full of mercury and lead, is good for your baby.
[01:12:31.792 --> 01:12:32.873]  Mercury lead, good.
[01:12:32.873 --> 01:12:34.234]  Mother's milk, bad.
[01:12:34.234 --> 01:12:39.459]  Mom, apple pie, blessings, beauty, health, everything good, bad.
[01:12:39.459 --> 01:12:45.525]  Everything disease, torture, lying, black uniforms, humiliation, taxes, bureaucracy, good.
[01:12:47.594 --> 01:12:59.226]  And now, I mean, I got up this morning, and it was on Infowars.com, and I saw an article one of my writers did about Obama says he can't wait to ignore Congress, and I'm like, oh, did somebody go too far?
[01:12:59.226 --> 01:13:04.711]  Because as a, you know, head editor of everything, sometimes stuff every once in a while is exaggerated.
[01:13:04.711 --> 01:13:08.055]  Generally, though, it's worse than what my writers say.
[01:13:08.055 --> 01:13:10.658]  Generally, I'm like, listen, this is a lot worse than what you said, okay?
[01:13:11.579 --> 01:13:15.361]  I understand it's hard to write how bad it is because it's so incredible.
[01:13:15.361 --> 01:13:21.863]  We've got natural gauges in us to not want to believe this, but it's worse than what you wrote here.
[01:13:21.863 --> 01:13:23.524]  Will you please add this?
[01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:24.804]  But I thought, this just can't be.
[01:13:24.804 --> 01:13:30.287]  And I went and read all these White House advisors and pundits and the president going, oh, just don't worry.
[01:13:30.287 --> 01:13:35.449]  All those quotes of Obama about, I can't wait, you know, it'd be great if I was a dictator.
[01:13:36.987 --> 01:13:39.049]  Similar stuff to Bush, just so long as I'm the dictator.
[01:13:39.049 --> 01:13:44.113]  And to crowds, you know, Congress is holding me back, but I don't have the right to do what I want.
[01:13:44.113 --> 01:13:45.394]  I wish I could help you.
[01:13:45.394 --> 01:13:48.656]  It's their fault.
[01:13:48.656 --> 01:13:51.078]  Congress, by the way, is giving him almost everything he wants.
[01:13:51.078 --> 01:13:55.642]  And when they don't give him carbon taxes that will openly shut America down, he just does it himself.
[01:13:55.642 --> 01:13:59.124]  Or when they say, hey, we want to launch a war in Libya and put al-Qaeda in charge.
[01:13:59.124 --> 01:14:03.128]  We're warmongers like you, but will you just come to us to get authorization?
[01:14:03.128 --> 01:14:04.649]  And he's like, no.
[01:14:06.035 --> 01:14:07.336]  They're like, well, why?
[01:14:07.336 --> 01:14:08.777]  Because I said so, the UN.
[01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:11.599]  See, they just don't like not being at the table.
[01:14:11.599 --> 01:14:13.541]  And now he's just saying, look, you don't even count.
[01:14:13.541 --> 01:14:16.543]  Now the Feds say the states don't count.
[01:14:16.543 --> 01:14:17.604]  Oh, there's no states, right?
[01:14:17.604 --> 01:14:22.128]  I don't know why we have states.
[01:14:22.128 --> 01:14:25.951]  So I saw the article and I couldn't believe it.
[01:14:25.951 --> 01:14:28.693]  And it, it blew me away.
[01:14:31.257 --> 01:14:37.079]  And then I went and read all the quotes, and it's in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, MSNBC.
[01:14:37.079 --> 01:14:43.962]  MSNBC is very, very excited about it, and just thinks that it's absolutely incredible.
[01:14:43.962 --> 01:14:44.702]  Go read it for yourself.
[01:14:44.702 --> 01:14:45.522]  So there they are.
[01:14:45.522 --> 01:14:48.763]  Yeah, we want a dictatorship.
[01:14:48.763 --> 01:14:50.764]  Under any other name, it's still a dictatorship.
[01:14:50.764 --> 01:14:53.345]  A rose is still a rose by any other name.
[01:14:53.345 --> 01:14:57.347]  And yeah, there's a MAP 21 system under Agenda 21, Bill.
[01:15:00.672 --> 01:15:09.022]  That says the IRS can just say you don't have a second right anymore if they feel like it for any reason.
[01:15:09.022 --> 01:15:15.970]  You're just put on a no-gun-buy list, no-gun-own list, which we know the White House Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, said in speeches they would do.
[01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:17.752]  How many times will I play that clip?
[01:15:20.305 --> 01:15:23.707]  And then they also say in there, you won't be able to travel unless the IRS authorizes you.
[01:15:23.707 --> 01:15:24.507]  No judge, no jury.
[01:15:24.507 --> 01:15:27.229]  And I found a bunch of other stuff in there.
[01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:31.011]  And of course they're gonna have the IRS, who's got their fingers in every business.
[01:15:31.011 --> 01:15:35.053]  All this compliance stuff, this indentured servitude, making it work for them.
[01:15:35.053 --> 01:15:36.414]  Hundreds of billions a year.
[01:15:36.414 --> 01:15:38.675]  Hundreds of billions, conservatively.
[01:15:38.675 --> 01:15:41.356]  Last time it was 250-something billion.
[01:15:41.356 --> 01:15:46.059]  They were estimating.
[01:15:46.059 --> 01:15:47.539]  For IRS compliance.
[01:15:47.539 --> 01:15:48.060]  And now,
[01:15:49.599 --> 01:15:51.681]  You're gonna comply on all this other stuff.
[01:15:51.681 --> 01:16:01.869]  And the IRS, who works for the private Federal Reserve, that's the banker's army, backed up by your local federalized SWAT team, and your federalized state police, and then your homeland security.
[01:16:01.869 --> 01:16:09.115]  I knew it would happen, the TSA is now, reports are coming in at shopping malls, and groping people.
[01:16:09.115 --> 01:16:11.397]  Just randomly go, we're the TSA.
[01:16:15.111 --> 01:16:19.315]  And they wave a magic little wand, and your police suddenly can do it.
[01:16:19.315 --> 01:16:25.301]  So the Supreme Court says, yeah, police, even in a custodial arrest, out of the road, can now strip search you.
[01:16:25.301 --> 01:16:28.144]  And they're now hiring people who want to do it.
[01:16:28.144 --> 01:16:36.472]  That's the thing, is that every weirdo pervert is now getting a badge and a gun, and if they can't even pass those requirements, they just become TSA.
[01:16:40.666 --> 01:16:42.528]  I mean, we've got cancer.
[01:16:42.528 --> 01:16:48.374]  The federal government is foreign banker run, enemy beachhead, and they're getting ready to roll up the whole country.
[01:16:48.374 --> 01:16:52.538]  And the American people finally woke up and are buying 5 million guns a month.
[01:16:52.538 --> 01:16:52.698]  But...
[01:16:54.434 --> 01:16:59.899]  The Civil War route is not the way to go, because they're going to blow stuff up and blame it on those of us that defend ourselves.
[01:16:59.899 --> 01:17:03.502]  And in the end, we'll end up winning that physical battle, but the globalists will sit offshore.
[01:17:03.502 --> 01:17:05.063]  They don't care if everything gets wrecked.
[01:17:05.063 --> 01:17:11.388]  They'll come back in later under another incarnation, because what they want to do is wreck the society.
[01:17:11.388 --> 01:17:13.710]  So Obama says he can't wait to get reelected.
[01:17:13.710 --> 01:17:17.153]  By the way, when Mitt Romney gets in, if he does, he'll just use all the new powers, too.
[01:17:17.153 --> 01:17:18.975]  He's bought and paid for by the exact same people.
[01:17:20.677 --> 01:17:25.781]  You think Bush is bad, so you're like, oh, Obama must be better, and then he's horrible, well, Romney must be better.
[01:17:25.781 --> 01:17:26.981]  No.
[01:17:26.981 --> 01:17:28.082]  No.
[01:17:28.082 --> 01:17:30.044]  Just watch.
[01:17:30.044 --> 01:17:34.947]  But the way they're looking, they may just put Obama in regardless and declare him emperor.
[01:17:34.947 --> 01:17:38.530]  And if you're not for it, you're a racist.
[01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:42.252]  So, they're now announcing you cannot help with any family chores.
[01:17:42.252 --> 01:17:44.654]  No judge, no jury, no law.
[01:17:44.654 --> 01:17:48.397]  It's a rule from the Department of Labor and Agriculture.
[01:17:49.289 --> 01:17:50.250]  Oh, and here's another one.
[01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:51.430]  Water in your birdbath.
[01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:52.111]  New York Times.
[01:17:52.111 --> 01:17:53.672]  That will be $300.
[01:17:53.672 --> 01:17:59.555]  No water ever allowed in birdbaths because you don't know when to dump it out to kill mosquitoes.
[01:17:59.555 --> 01:18:04.438]  So now anything that holds water, you're going to be fined, and the bureaucrats are coming on your property without warrants.
[01:18:04.438 --> 01:18:09.380]  They're now teaching bureaucrat code enforcers and others that they don't have to have a warrant.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:11.982]  And teaching you it's a privilege.
[01:18:11.982 --> 01:18:12.302]  Why not?
[01:18:12.302 --> 01:18:13.463]  They told you driving's a privilege.
[01:18:13.463 --> 01:18:14.203]  It's not.
[01:18:14.203 --> 01:18:15.564]  They're now telling you guns are a privilege.
[01:18:16.894 --> 01:18:17.995]  And it goes on and on.
[01:18:17.995 --> 01:18:23.361]  But then the big kahuna today, that this story is getting no traction and it angers me.
[01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:25.503]  We need to get this out to everybody.
[01:18:25.503 --> 01:18:29.627]  Bill allows IRS to revoke Second Amendment rights by stealth.
[01:18:29.627 --> 01:18:31.569]  And here's the issue.
[01:18:31.569 --> 01:18:36.214]  Just like with the NDAA, oh Alex, it doesn't allow secret arrest of citizens.
[01:18:36.214 --> 01:18:38.056]  Months later after it passes, oh yeah it does.
[01:18:39.431 --> 01:18:43.612]  Head of the FBI says, yeah it does, but, you know, gotta ask the President about that.
[01:18:43.612 --> 01:18:46.213]  See, once it's in place, oh yeah, it does do that.
[01:18:46.213 --> 01:19:05.340]  I've read the bill, you can read it, it ties into this whole administrative thing, it ties into what the White House Chief of Staff, Emanuel, now the Chicago mob boss said, that they would just put you on a list, through agencies, and you don't own guns, never convicted, no crime, total tyranny, and we've got the subsection that says it.
[01:19:07.329 --> 01:19:08.469]  But it's not just knives.
[01:19:08.469 --> 01:19:13.471]  They say any permit, any right, any... They can withdraw anything!
[01:19:13.471 --> 01:19:17.572]  They can say you can't travel, take your house, without judges, juries, anything.
[01:19:17.572 --> 01:19:18.812]  I mean, it's more than just guns.
[01:19:18.812 --> 01:19:20.472]  We just focused on that.
[01:19:20.472 --> 01:19:28.594]  Just total, massive, lawless, a declaration that yes, we're criminals, yes, we're coming.
[01:19:28.594 --> 01:19:29.534]  Of course they're criminals.
[01:19:29.534 --> 01:19:31.815]  They let the troops use DU, they know it's a death sentence.
[01:19:31.815 --> 01:19:34.596]  These are mad dog crazies.
[01:19:34.596 --> 01:19:35.256]  You understand that?
[01:19:36.203 --> 01:19:37.584]  Because they've gotten away with so much.
[01:19:37.584 --> 01:19:45.911]  Congressman says he was assaulted during TSA pat-down, and now every time he flies, they know who he is, and grab his testicles and crush them.
[01:19:45.911 --> 01:19:47.552]  That's K-E-N-S-5.
[01:19:47.552 --> 01:19:50.295]  Oh, they're like, you don't like us?
[01:19:50.295 --> 01:19:50.795]  Get over here.
[01:19:50.795 --> 01:19:53.697]  And they just, like, go, ahhh!
[01:19:53.697 --> 01:19:55.098]  And it's like, ugh!
[01:19:55.098 --> 01:19:55.919]  And the police come.
[01:19:55.919 --> 01:19:59.522]  It's a celebration of evil, a human sacrifice of his testicles.
[01:19:59.522 --> 01:20:00.083]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.124 --> 01:20:06.628]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:20:06.628 --> 01:20:09.029]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:20:09.029 --> 01:20:14.733]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.

[01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:40.505]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[01:20:40.505 --> 01:20:42.725]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:20:42.725 --> 01:20:45.466]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.

[01:24:04.147 --> 01:24:05.927]  By the way, I wasn't joking.
[01:24:05.927 --> 01:24:13.069]  Congressman Canseco says now every time he flies it's K-E-N-S San Antonio News 5.
[01:24:13.069 --> 01:24:18.831]  We have our own report at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:24:18.831 --> 01:24:22.151]  Congressman says he was targeted for grope down by TSA.
[01:24:22.151 --> 01:24:26.572]  Representative says he was assaulted by TSA and then punished for complaining.
[01:24:26.572 --> 01:24:28.733]  And now when he flies, he has to fly to D.C.
[01:24:28.733 --> 01:24:32.694]  every week or so, and he comes back and sees his family back to South Texas.
[01:24:33.755 --> 01:24:36.276]  Just south of me here.
[01:24:36.276 --> 01:24:41.838]  They call him aside and know who he is and call the police over and say, you're going to take it or you're not flying.
[01:24:41.838 --> 01:24:43.779]  And he describes it.
[01:24:43.779 --> 01:24:44.919]  That's what everybody describes.
[01:24:44.919 --> 01:24:52.242]  They put your hand on you and they lift up and they grab your sexual organs and start crushing them to make sure it's not a bomb.
[01:24:52.242 --> 01:24:53.462]  And man, they get off on it.
[01:24:53.462 --> 01:24:54.963]  I've sat there at the airport and watched it.
[01:24:55.563 --> 01:24:56.904]  Well, Miss USA talked about it.
[01:24:56.904 --> 01:24:58.864]  The more she cried, the more they got off.
[01:24:58.864 --> 01:25:01.386]  They had to settle one because there was video of it.
[01:25:01.386 --> 01:25:05.367]  They pulled the woman's shirt off, began grabbing her breast, asking her for a date.
[01:25:05.367 --> 01:25:06.288]  She began to sob.
[01:25:06.288 --> 01:25:08.128]  Rape victims are breaking down.
[01:25:08.128 --> 01:25:11.890]  And every pervert out there is just hitting us and hitting us hard.
[01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:13.451]  So, that's America!
[01:25:14.474 --> 01:25:25.921]  And Obama says he can't wait to get re-elected to totally ignore Congress, and they're gonna ban kids doing chores on the farm, which just kills the culture, I mean, and kills parental consent.
[01:25:25.921 --> 01:25:32.244]  All over the country, they're taking DNA from kids without warrants of parental consent and giving them vaccines.
[01:25:32.244 --> 01:25:34.986]  I mean, they just want a shooting war.
[01:25:34.986 --> 01:25:36.347]  I mean, they want it, and they want it now.
[01:25:39.403 --> 01:25:40.324]  And they're gonna start one.
[01:25:40.324 --> 01:25:41.244]  They're gonna blow stuff up.
[01:25:41.244 --> 01:25:41.664]  Guaranteed.
[01:25:41.664 --> 01:25:42.565]  Blame it on us.
[01:25:42.565 --> 01:25:43.306]  They're terrorists.
[01:25:43.306 --> 01:25:46.768]  We have terrorists running things and they got a bunch of idiots working for them.
[01:25:46.768 --> 01:25:49.349]  The average moron working for them doesn't even know all this.
[01:25:49.349 --> 01:25:51.951]  They're like, I'm gonna go and watch a football game.
[01:25:51.951 --> 01:25:54.172]  Bob, Laura, see you tomorrow.
[01:25:54.172 --> 01:25:59.996]  They have no idea they're living in the middle of a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:25:59.996 --> 01:26:02.197]  They give them all these little excuses for why they're doing it.
[01:26:02.197 --> 01:26:04.059]  Okay, I've ranted enough.
[01:26:04.059 --> 01:26:07.661]  Do you guys have that particular phone number and have that queued up that I want ready?
[01:26:11.684 --> 01:26:13.585]  Okay, because we're going to do that later after I take some calls.
[01:26:13.585 --> 01:26:18.609]  We have a surprise coming up.
[01:26:18.609 --> 01:26:21.631]  I just every minute want to wake up from this.
[01:26:21.631 --> 01:26:22.912]  I mean, Ron Paul has described it.
[01:26:22.912 --> 01:26:24.774]  They grab his genitals and begin squeezing him.
[01:26:26.708 --> 01:26:29.730]  And it's been described as being lifted off the ground.
[01:26:29.730 --> 01:26:34.954]  I mean, they get in there and like, let me check and feel it to check what it is.
[01:26:34.954 --> 01:26:37.576]  I mean, get me out of here.
[01:26:37.576 --> 01:26:40.297]  And now they're like, we're going to be on the highway, pal.
[01:26:40.297 --> 01:26:43.099]  And they're teaching the cops.
[01:26:43.099 --> 01:26:45.981]  And I just cannot put up with you anymore.
[01:26:45.981 --> 01:26:51.005]  You narcotics trafficking, child kidnapping, murdering, banker occupation, crime mafia.
[01:26:52.598 --> 01:26:54.679]  Oh, I hate your guts, you filth!
[01:26:54.679 --> 01:26:56.600]  And I hate all the stupid people that go along with you.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.461]  You make me want to throw up.
[01:26:58.461 --> 01:26:59.282]  None of you will be happy.
[01:26:59.282 --> 01:27:02.063]  You've got total depression and total cancer in this country.
[01:27:02.063 --> 01:27:03.944]  And don't worry, you're going to get it.
[01:27:03.944 --> 01:27:07.466]  David in Texas, you're on the air, listening on 90.1 FM.
[01:27:07.466 --> 01:27:10.668]  Go ahead.
[01:27:10.668 --> 01:27:12.529]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:12.529 --> 01:27:14.030]  Alex, I've got a question.
[01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:20.193]  I've been listening to you for a long time, since you've been on Nexus, and I was just kind of jogging your memory.
[01:27:20.959 --> 01:27:30.347]  If you remember a guy calling in, you were talking about President Bush Senior at the time, and I called in and told you that I thought he was the devil.
[01:27:30.347 --> 01:27:35.911]  I was just wondering if you remember that.
[01:27:35.911 --> 01:27:39.174]  Yes sir, and I was wondering if you know what I'm talking about now.
[01:27:41.457 --> 01:27:44.159]  I didn't mean that he was the devil.
[01:27:44.159 --> 01:27:46.160]  I mean that he's working for the devil.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:46.700]  Oh, they are!
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:47.981]  100% it's all real.
[01:27:47.981 --> 01:27:49.322]  Let me tell you.
[01:27:49.322 --> 01:27:51.943]  These people believe, they think Lucifer's God.
[01:27:51.943 --> 01:27:53.064]  They follow it.
[01:27:53.064 --> 01:27:55.045]  That's why they're so horrible.
[01:27:55.045 --> 01:28:00.929]  I mean, I was watching a movie about a reported true story of exorcisms on the treadmill today.
[01:28:00.929 --> 01:28:04.531]  It's called The Rite with Anthony Hopkins.
[01:28:05.964 --> 01:28:09.085]  We actually had a chance to meet one time, but side issue.
[01:28:09.085 --> 01:28:13.025]  And it's a true story based on what reporters said they saw.
[01:28:13.025 --> 01:28:21.827]  And the point is, in all these cultures, what demons act like and what they like to do is what these government leaders do.
[01:28:21.827 --> 01:28:24.588]  I mean, that's what it's like.
[01:28:24.588 --> 01:28:30.489]  I mean, I can't, I watch a legend that I hadn't seen since I was a teenager with Tom Cruise a few weeks ago on the treadmill.
[01:28:31.522 --> 01:28:39.565]  And the little demons that are going out, the little goblins going out to kill the unicorn, the kind of little things they say and what they do and how they like ugliness and hurting good things.
[01:28:39.565 --> 01:28:43.487]  And it's like, I can't watch stuff like that, because I'm like, this isn't movies!
[01:28:43.487 --> 01:28:48.389]  All this stuff comes from what's really gone on, but it's all metaphors.
[01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:50.030]  These people are goblins.
[01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:56.753]  These people are like, oh, so cute and sweet, like to see it rotting meat.
[01:28:56.753 --> 01:28:58.934]  You know, that's who they are!
[01:28:59.693 --> 01:29:01.954]  And I can, it's just like, oh man!
[01:29:01.954 --> 01:29:03.696]  I mean, look at what these governments do!
[01:29:03.696 --> 01:29:06.057]  The horrors!
[01:29:06.057 --> 01:29:07.718]  It's, it's, they're waging, they are!
[01:29:07.718 --> 01:29:11.240]  These, these people are the legions of Satan!
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:15.183]  And they have taken over the churches, and we are in a lot of trouble!
[01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:18.005]  Every church I go to is worship the government!
[01:29:18.005 --> 01:29:22.808]  Well, the individual in government may not be evil, but the, but, but, but they are an instrument of it.
[01:29:22.808 --> 01:29:23.508]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:29:23.508 --> 01:29:25.650]  Right.
[01:29:25.650 --> 01:29:27.211]  Do you want to add anything else, David?
[01:29:28.953 --> 01:29:30.294]  Stay there, I'm going to come back to you.
[01:29:30.294 --> 01:29:32.455]  If you ask me a question, I'm going to run on.
[01:29:32.455 --> 01:29:33.935]  I've got to rampage through these calls.
[01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:38.157]  Adam, David, Bob, Barbara and others.
[01:29:38.157 --> 01:29:42.799]  The President is openly saying he wants to be a dictator.
[01:29:42.799 --> 01:29:47.622]  The bankers are openly destroying this country.
[01:29:47.622 --> 01:29:48.922]  Oh, I can't even look at Big Sis.
[01:29:48.922 --> 01:29:50.343]  She's on screen right there.
[01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:51.743]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.743 --> 01:29:54.265]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.265 --> 01:29:56.946]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.926 --> 01:30:17.405]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:30:17.405 --> 01:30:21.089]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:22.082 --> 01:30:34.854]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:30:34.854 --> 01:30:42.121]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:30:42.802 --> 01:30:53.167]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:32:25.403 --> 01:32:28.065]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:32:28.065 --> 01:32:30.506]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:32:30.506 --> 01:32:31.927]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:32:31.927 --> 01:32:35.088]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:32:35.088 --> 01:32:38.470]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:42.612]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:32:42.612 --> 01:32:45.354]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:32:45.354 --> 01:32:46.934]  It's what my family uses.
[01:32:46.934 --> 01:32:50.116]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:32:50.216 --> 01:32:56.058]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at InfoWars.com.

[01:32:57.979 --> 01:32:58.299]  888-253-3139.
[01:32:58.299 --> 01:33:06.362]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.526 --> 01:33:38.767]  We are Black Lives.
[01:33:38.767 --> 01:33:41.989]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:33:41.989 --> 01:33:43.630]  Alright, let's move quickly to the calls.
[01:33:43.630 --> 01:33:44.991]  David, finish your point.
[01:33:44.991 --> 01:33:48.293]  Yes, I get what you're saying now about he reminds you of the devil.
[01:33:48.293 --> 01:33:49.694]  These people are the devil.
[01:33:49.694 --> 01:33:50.135]  Go ahead.
[01:33:50.135 --> 01:33:52.516]  I wanted to get your opinion.
[01:33:52.516 --> 01:33:55.538]  Do you think we're watching Revelations live?
[01:33:55.538 --> 01:33:58.940]  My opinion is studying Revelations in the Bible.
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:03.083]  I believe that Obama is more than just a puppet.
[01:34:03.083 --> 01:34:05.385]  I think he may be your false prophet.
[01:34:06.078 --> 01:34:08.610]  Setting up a new world order for the Antichrist.
[01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:10.830]  I don't know, the world's so crazy.
[01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:11.591]  I mean, who knows?
[01:34:11.591 --> 01:34:12.792]  I mean, it might as well be.
[01:34:12.792 --> 01:34:14.133]  Isaac, go ahead and get it over with.
[01:34:14.133 --> 01:34:16.355]  But, you know, here's my issue.
[01:34:16.355 --> 01:34:23.541]  Growing up, all I heard was preachers say, you know, Jesus comes back in 1987, 89.
[01:34:23.541 --> 01:34:29.065]  All this stuff constantly is put out there so that people always say, well, I'm not going to do anything.
[01:34:29.065 --> 01:34:30.907]  It's the end of the world.
[01:34:30.907 --> 01:34:35.571]  Or the New Agers think 2012 is the end of the world, so they're all sucking their thumbs.
[01:34:35.571 --> 01:34:37.793]  When you're supposed to be out there confronting the evil.
[01:34:38.453 --> 01:34:42.997]  Now, people in Nazi Germany thought it was the end of the world and thought Hitler was the Antichrist.
[01:34:42.997 --> 01:34:45.639]  Of course, there are many Antichrists, doesn't the Bible say that?
[01:34:45.639 --> 01:34:50.523]  So, this is definitely a model of it, and more and more it's lining up.
[01:34:50.523 --> 01:34:55.847]  But it's going to get a lot worse, where you want to go to school, want a job, you got to put a port in your head where they can plug in.
[01:34:55.847 --> 01:34:57.488]  They're already saying that.
[01:34:57.488 --> 01:34:58.950]  So, it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:34:58.950 --> 01:35:00.231]  There's a lot more to come.
[01:35:01.906 --> 01:35:10.212]  To the point of, if God didn't intervene, there would be no flesh left unharmed, or no flesh left on earth.
[01:35:10.212 --> 01:35:13.074]  See, the globalists are pure deception.
[01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:15.555]  Whether you believe in the devil or not, you know what?
[01:35:15.555 --> 01:35:16.996]  That archetype, they're it.
[01:35:16.996 --> 01:35:18.137]  So, the devil's real.
[01:35:18.137 --> 01:35:19.758]  It's called the New World Order.
[01:35:19.758 --> 01:35:23.621]  Whether you believe in the devil or the Bible or not, the devil's real, folks!
[01:35:24.401 --> 01:35:25.102]  Might as well be.
[01:35:25.102 --> 01:35:28.586]  These people make the devil look like a, you know, a sweetie cake.
[01:35:28.586 --> 01:35:33.131]  I mean, you know, true evil is so much beyond what a good person.
[01:35:33.131 --> 01:35:35.214]  Doesn't mean we're perfect, but our heart's good.
[01:35:35.214 --> 01:35:38.137]  We have a blind spot because we can't even imagine it.
[01:35:39.138 --> 01:35:49.361]  We can't imagine a serial killer wants to grab a sweet little three-year-old girl, rape them and torture them for months, and just sucking off of the horror and the pain.
[01:35:49.361 --> 01:35:54.683]  And for us, that's like just disgusting and enraging and painful.
[01:35:54.683 --> 01:35:56.904]  To them, it's like sunshine.
[01:35:56.904 --> 01:35:58.264]  It's black sunshine.
[01:35:58.264 --> 01:36:00.825]  That's what psychopaths describe it as, like a glowing darkness.
[01:36:01.685 --> 01:36:03.727]  And they must be defeated.
[01:36:03.727 --> 01:36:05.929]  They must be overrun.
[01:36:05.929 --> 01:36:07.290]  They must learn fear.
[01:36:07.290 --> 01:36:09.051]  They must be trampled.
[01:36:09.051 --> 01:36:20.080]  And so, any church that doesn't tell you to go out and engage corruption, and it doesn't have the discernment to know, and tells you, do what the government says, well that means the devil will come, and they'll do what the government says.
[01:36:21.113 --> 01:36:31.197]  Any church doing that, of course, is a denomination run by the Rockefeller Foundation, through the World Council of Churches, and you might as well go join a Satan church.
[01:36:31.197 --> 01:36:32.138]  Literally.
[01:36:32.138 --> 01:36:44.262]  Because they are demon-filled, disgusting, pharisaical pieces of Romans 13, death-loving trash.
[01:36:44.262 --> 01:36:45.103]  I appreciate your call.
[01:36:46.766 --> 01:36:56.437]  I mean, that's what I have to say about these churches, is that you can have people that believe in God, you can have people that are there that are good, but it's always about worshipping the government.
[01:36:56.437 --> 01:37:02.643]  If Romans 13, in the context they teach it, was true, then Hitler should have been followed and supported.
[01:37:02.643 --> 01:37:04.445]  Stalin should have been loved.
[01:37:04.445 --> 01:37:05.707]  Our founding fathers were bad.
[01:37:07.594 --> 01:37:09.015]  It's a lie.
[01:37:09.015 --> 01:37:10.635]  Christ said no to the government.
[01:37:10.635 --> 01:37:12.656]  Every one of the prophets said no.
[01:37:12.656 --> 01:37:13.617]  The lion's den.
[01:37:13.617 --> 01:37:14.677]  The list goes on and on.
[01:37:14.677 --> 01:37:20.479]  And these abomination churches are devils!
[01:37:20.479 --> 01:37:22.100]  They are devils!
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:29.143]  Little, soft puppets that want to keep their 501c3 that they shouldn't even have.
[01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:30.043]  Churches don't need a 501c3.
[01:37:32.245 --> 01:37:37.006]  I know those little devils are listening right now and they're like, well how come we have them?
[01:37:37.006 --> 01:37:45.209]  Because they came to the churches through the Rockefeller Foundation and said here's your form for your tax exemption and tricked them into becoming a charity.
[01:37:45.209 --> 01:37:49.030]  A charity is under government regulations, not a church.
[01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.690]  Not a church.
[01:37:49.690 --> 01:37:51.111]  They play word games.
[01:37:51.111 --> 01:37:52.431]  They deceived you.
[01:37:52.431 --> 01:37:55.652]  They stole your birthright!
[01:37:55.652 --> 01:38:01.334]  We wouldn't be in this position if the churches weren't filled to the rafters.
[01:38:02.386 --> 01:38:10.588]  If there weren't demons dancing around the steeples.
[01:38:10.588 --> 01:38:12.808]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Maine.
[01:38:12.808 --> 01:38:14.649]  Bob, you're on the air.
[01:38:14.649 --> 01:38:15.389]  What's going on?
[01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:18.530]  I was calling from deep in the heart of FEMA Region 1.
[01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:20.210]  You are there, yes.
[01:38:20.210 --> 01:38:26.912]  Hey, just wanted to let you know, um, I listen to you on the internet and also, um, you guys should put something on your website about shortwave.
[01:38:26.912 --> 01:38:28.272]  I don't catch your show during the day.
[01:38:28.272 --> 01:38:30.533]  I catch you on shortwave.
[01:38:30.533 --> 01:38:31.733]  And I also want to let you know,
[01:38:32.256 --> 01:38:39.804]  That, um, the hams, I'm also a ham radio operator, um, we're working on, we got networks going, digital networks.
[01:38:39.804 --> 01:38:43.128]  We get together and we pass information back and forth and news stories.
[01:38:43.128 --> 01:38:47.232]  So when the internet does get shut down, we'll have a way to communicate.
[01:38:47.232 --> 01:38:52.778]  And what I do is sometimes for practice, I'll take some of your news stories and we're circulating them on ham radio.
[01:38:54.386 --> 01:38:55.627]  So your stories are getting out.
[01:39:16.698 --> 01:39:26.985]  Homeland Security, FEMA, Department of Defense openly says without warrants, they're already doing it, they're coming to everybody's farm to teach you, and a lot of times they come with guns drawn.
[01:39:26.985 --> 01:39:32.308]  We had federally funded state game wardens rush onto our property as we're all just sitting there camping.
[01:39:32.688 --> 01:39:47.673]  Bossing everyone around and acting powerful, until one person had seen one of the game wardens in a hunting magazine and knew his name, and suddenly, you know, the guy got all happy because he was being, you know, his narcissism was fed, and suddenly they acted all nice, but, no, you're part of a federal task force!
[01:39:47.673 --> 01:39:54.356]  This country, the federal, you mean the foreign banks that ship little kids out?
[01:39:54.356 --> 01:39:56.356]  And ship drugs in, you mean you work for them?
[01:39:56.356 --> 01:39:57.537]  Like we're all impressed?
[01:39:58.491 --> 01:40:02.113]  Oh my gosh, you work for the... Oh, let me get scared!
[01:40:02.113 --> 01:40:04.313]  Let me bend over to you and worship you.
[01:40:04.313 --> 01:40:07.235]  I mean, it's just... When is enough enough?
[01:40:07.235 --> 01:40:12.137]  God bless you.
[01:40:12.137 --> 01:40:15.178]  I mean, Obama says he's going to be a dictator in the second term.
[01:40:15.178 --> 01:40:16.839]  That's what he said!
[01:40:16.839 --> 01:40:26.603]  And then they have this legislation in the MAP 21 bill to let the IRS take your passport and not let you travel.
[01:40:26.603 --> 01:40:27.243]  Totally illegal.
[01:40:29.056 --> 01:40:35.262]  And they say they'll take your guns if they feel for any reason you're dangerous.
[01:40:35.262 --> 01:40:37.805]  The IRS now is over guns.
[01:40:37.805 --> 01:40:40.888]  I mean, and you're like, well, it won't pass.
[01:40:40.888 --> 01:40:43.090]  It's neck and neck because of the furor.
[01:40:43.090 --> 01:40:45.793]  It was set to pass this week because of the furor.
[01:40:45.793 --> 01:40:46.554]  It's in trouble now.
[01:40:48.202 --> 01:40:56.024]  But there's people on YouTube in the video I shot last night and in the article saying I'm a liar when I'm linked to the bill!
[01:40:56.024 --> 01:41:01.925]  Just like you said I was a liar about NDAA or a liar about your appliances spying on you.
[01:41:01.925 --> 01:41:04.825]  No, I didn't lie about any of it.
[01:41:04.825 --> 01:41:07.706]  I told you the truth over and over again.
[01:41:07.706 --> 01:41:10.846]  Do you realize how dangerous these globalist are?
[01:41:10.846 --> 01:41:12.887]  Do you realize they want to kill us?
[01:41:13.843 --> 01:41:15.084]  You think they hate Iraqis?
[01:41:15.084 --> 01:41:18.128]  Folks, they hate Americans about a hundred times what they hate Iraqis.
[01:41:18.128 --> 01:41:19.650]  The globalists hate everybody.
[01:41:19.650 --> 01:41:21.131]  They even hate each other.
[01:41:21.131 --> 01:41:24.535]  They're a bunch of devils!
[01:41:24.535 --> 01:41:25.877]  Okay, let's say the devil doesn't exist.
[01:41:27.125 --> 01:41:30.186]  They have our troops use DU and they know it soft kills them.
[01:41:30.186 --> 01:41:33.707]  They killed over a million Iraqis with starvation, the rest of it.
[01:41:33.707 --> 01:41:36.989]  They use DU all over Iraq and the Burt Defects have exploded.
[01:41:36.989 --> 01:41:38.629]  They bomb infrastructures everywhere.
[01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:43.091]  The Globalists go in and bomb water treatment plants and electricity and never rebuild it on purpose.
[01:41:43.971 --> 01:41:46.514]  They make the countries take Monsanto, GMO.
[01:41:46.514 --> 01:41:47.796]  They curse all of us.
[01:41:47.796 --> 01:42:00.871]  I mean, whatever you want to call these people that tell us, oh, 52 million aborted babies is good, and let's kill babies up to age three now, and let's kill grandma, Bill Gates is a superhero, and Newsweek.
[01:42:00.871 --> 01:42:01.231]  Remember,
[01:42:04.696 --> 01:42:07.657]  Remember the case for killing Granny cover of Newsweek.
[01:42:07.657 --> 01:42:13.518]  Simultaneously they were saying there's no death panels in this and government won't decide what your doctor does.
[01:42:13.518 --> 01:42:18.719]  Now they have the law, they go yeah death panels are real, we're gonna tell your doctor what they can do.
[01:42:18.719 --> 01:42:23.139]  And again they play this game where we tell the truth, they go oh no that's not true.
[01:42:23.139 --> 01:42:24.500]  You're like yeah here's your proof.
[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:28.780]  They make it all about the debate about what's true or what isn't.
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:31.841]  Instead of you just going out and finding out, you've been lied to.
[01:42:35.069 --> 01:42:50.877]  And anything that drops the trance, anything that takes you from being like a child, and they're the adult, to you're an adult, they're a pervert, you're an adult, you're a good person, they're a criminal, and reversing those roles, that they're your loving guardian.
[01:42:50.877 --> 01:42:55.880]  Yeah, like Nosferatu's a loving guardian of virgins in their bed at midnight.
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:59.782]  Or Hitler's a loving guardian of people, or Stalin's a loving guardian.
[01:42:59.782 --> 01:43:03.864]  No, they're not good, they're not nice, they're bad, they're bad, they're bad!
[01:43:05.814 --> 01:43:09.236]  And that's why I go back to that Jesse Ventura clip.
[01:43:09.236 --> 01:43:12.818]  Because it's one of the most, it's probably the most powerful thing I've ever seen on television.
[01:43:12.818 --> 01:43:13.958]  You know, that's real.
[01:43:13.958 --> 01:43:21.983]  Where he goes to the congressman who has the bill to expand the already existing FEMA camps, and it gives us the full architecture of the camps, how they work, how they operate.
[01:43:21.983 --> 01:43:24.124]  We already reverse engineered it.
[01:43:24.124 --> 01:43:31.228]  He says, I have the bill where you're going to expand these emergency camps for people all over the country, including for political reasons.
[01:43:31.228 --> 01:43:31.768]  And the guy goes,
[01:43:32.745 --> 01:43:34.886]  I do not know what you're talking about.
[01:43:34.886 --> 01:43:38.148]  And his fake Georgia accent in Tennessee.
[01:43:38.148 --> 01:43:41.350]  And Ventura says, well here's the bill right here.
[01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:45.452]  And he goes, you mean the one with the green alien coming out of the machine to eat me?
[01:43:46.761 --> 01:43:53.884]  Ventura looks at him and says, no, this bill, and hands it to him, and he goes, I do not remember that bill.
[01:43:53.884 --> 01:44:09.591]  And the reason I go over that clip over and over again is because when the hoax falls and that aired, it freaked people out so bad and reminded them of all the other condescending stuff that Homeland Security was threatening people.
[01:44:09.591 --> 01:44:12.192]  And there were all, I can't even tell you what went on behind the scenes.
[01:44:12.192 --> 01:44:14.473]  I mean, people,
[01:44:17.196 --> 01:44:21.857]  You know what, I'm told stuff in confidence and I just can't tell you.
[01:44:21.857 --> 01:44:31.879]  I tried to talk him into telling you what went on.
[01:44:31.879 --> 01:44:33.620]  Let's just say some people didn't make it.
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:35.840]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:41.761]  The point is, is that the hoax fell in that clip.
[01:44:41.761 --> 01:44:43.982]  Like he's got a bill and the guy's talking about space aliens.
[01:44:45.598 --> 01:44:47.840]  Saying, why do you believe space aliens are going to eat my brain?
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:53.426]  And Ventura's like, I got a bill about expanding camps.
[01:44:53.426 --> 01:44:56.369]  And I see these trolls saying, oh, they're not coming after our guns.
[01:44:56.369 --> 01:44:57.430]  Oh, no, no.
[01:44:57.430 --> 01:45:01.194]  Rahm Emanuel just said they do it this exact way.
[01:45:01.194 --> 01:45:05.558]  It's like people going, oh, they don't want to have a national draft for a domestic FEMA Corps.
[01:45:05.558 --> 01:45:09.242]  Now it's been announced they're talking about making high school students be part of it for graduation.
[01:45:11.135 --> 01:45:17.240]  And paying them, because they're going to bankrupt things so bad, the new thing is going to be a paid government welfare where you work for them.
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:23.044]  And let me tell you something, I get pulled over by some snot-nosed 18-year-old punk wanting to grab my genitals, it's over.
[01:45:23.044 --> 01:45:27.628]  And they are training them in the new handshake of America, where a pot-bellied pedophile grabs your genitals.
[01:45:28.368 --> 01:45:29.849]  Again, if they can do that, they can do anything.
[01:45:29.849 --> 01:45:34.213]  The psychological warfare chiefs sit back and go, how do we fully break these people?
[01:45:34.213 --> 01:45:35.734]  How do you get inside their comfort zone?
[01:45:35.734 --> 01:45:36.795]  You've got to do something radical.
[01:45:36.795 --> 01:45:38.157]  You've got to go all the way.
[01:45:38.157 --> 01:45:40.138]  I've read the manuals on air.
[01:45:40.138 --> 01:45:41.519]  This is their plan.
[01:45:41.519 --> 01:45:46.203]  They think we're a joke.
[01:45:46.203 --> 01:45:46.924]  But here's the deal.
[01:45:46.924 --> 01:45:50.127]  If we ever start reversing them, it's all over.
[01:45:51.328 --> 01:45:52.729]  That's why they're scared.
[01:45:52.729 --> 01:45:55.850]  That's why they're holding on to a Buck and Bronco 8 seconds.
[01:45:55.850 --> 01:45:56.370]  And you know what?
[01:45:56.370 --> 01:45:59.411]  8 seconds is 800 years in this game.
[01:45:59.411 --> 01:46:00.311]  You're gonna lose.
[01:46:00.311 --> 01:46:01.412]  You miscalculated.
[01:46:01.412 --> 01:46:04.893]  You sacks of pus.
[01:46:04.893 --> 01:46:09.115]  All that matters to me is that you go down, and you will.
[01:46:09.115 --> 01:46:14.657]  You will not hold this species back with your disease and the pus gravy you try to pour all over everything that's good.
[01:46:16.877 --> 01:46:20.918]  You may think death and destruction and burning cities and dead children is beautiful.
[01:46:20.918 --> 01:46:22.059]  I think you're ugly.
[01:46:22.059 --> 01:46:23.519]  I think your mind's ugly.
[01:46:23.519 --> 01:46:34.403]  I think you're trash and I declare absolute 110% total war on every level at you.
[01:46:34.403 --> 01:46:36.184]  It's time to find our humanity again.
[01:46:37.230 --> 01:46:38.391]  Look at this Daily Mail story.
[01:46:38.391 --> 01:46:39.271]  The public is fed up.
[01:46:39.271 --> 01:46:46.095]  Former TSA chief again criticizes airport security checks as he claims current process is doing little to stop terrorists.
[01:46:46.095 --> 01:46:47.036]  You mean the terrorists the U.S.
[01:46:47.036 --> 01:46:49.057]  government gets on the airplanes like the underwear bomber?
[01:46:49.057 --> 01:46:50.258]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:46:50.258 --> 01:46:52.720]  And he says the public is at a breaking point.
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:54.941]  That's what the globalists want.
[01:46:54.941 --> 01:46:56.322]  They want it.
[01:46:56.322 --> 01:47:03.906]  That's why we've got to spend every millisecond now getting the word out before they stage the next false flag.
[01:47:03.906 --> 01:47:05.888]  They're the people that give you the false flags.
[01:47:06.954 --> 01:47:07.894]  It's like rattlesnakes.
[01:47:07.894 --> 01:47:09.615]  They're the ones that bite you.
[01:47:09.615 --> 01:47:13.356]  This criminal government, they're the ones that blow stuff up to pose as saviors.
[01:47:13.356 --> 01:47:14.236]  You ever thought about that?
[01:47:14.236 --> 01:47:17.037]  You ever know how many other governments have been caught doing it?
[01:47:17.037 --> 01:47:18.277]  Our own government caught doing it?
[01:47:18.277 --> 01:47:20.478]  It's not our government.
[01:47:20.478 --> 01:47:22.379]  We got to get that message out.
[01:47:22.379 --> 01:47:25.920]  We got to get the message out about the bankers running the government.
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.720]  And let me tell you something.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:29.561]  You get that message out, they're going down.
[01:47:29.561 --> 01:47:32.141]  That's why Brzezinski said we might as well just kill a million people.
[01:47:32.141 --> 01:47:33.402]  Let's try to control them now.
[01:47:34.426 --> 01:47:34.986]  In his new book.
[01:47:34.986 --> 01:47:37.628]  Because he said in the past we could control them with propaganda.
[01:47:37.628 --> 01:47:38.689]  It doesn't work anymore.
[01:47:38.689 --> 01:47:44.353]  Yeah, you may be able to control some drooling TV sports fan who thinks that's real manly.
[01:47:44.353 --> 01:47:46.955]  Or some woman who's all into herself and could care less.
[01:47:46.955 --> 01:47:49.958]  But there's a large portion that only cares about freedom.
[01:47:49.958 --> 01:47:52.179]  And it's never majorities that win wars.
[01:47:52.179 --> 01:47:53.500]  And you know that.
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.602]  And we got a lot more than our forebears had in 1776.
[01:48:01.516 --> 01:48:05.518]  Let's go ahead, and let's go ahead and go over to David in Georgia.
[01:48:05.518 --> 01:48:08.180]  David, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:09.220]  Hello, Alex.
[01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:11.041]  Hello.
[01:48:11.041 --> 01:48:17.685]  I am a listener on the member, listening to you on the internet on N4s.
[01:48:17.685 --> 01:48:19.106]  Thank you.
[01:48:19.106 --> 01:48:28.671]  I am a retired military veteran, a disabled vet, and I was a delegate to the 8th District Conference
[01:48:29.341 --> 01:48:40.808]  About two weeks ago, and another delegate gave me a Market Watch website copy of something that I haven't heard discussed.
[01:48:40.808 --> 01:48:41.788]  That's Wall Street Journal.
[01:48:41.788 --> 01:48:43.409]  Tell us what it said.
[01:48:43.409 --> 01:48:48.832]  A foreign company will process our votes in November.
[01:48:48.832 --> 01:48:59.058]  A Spanish company, S-C-Y-T-L, has acquired S-O-E, the leading vote processing company in the United States.
[01:49:00.054 --> 01:49:14.381]  This means votes will now be transferred to a central server overseas where they will be counted rather than being counted at the local precinct level.
[01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:19.063]  I was aware that that company was doing some of it, but if they're doing the national, that's globalism.
[01:49:19.063 --> 01:49:23.645]  Have foreign groups run the water, run the voting, ship GM to China.
[01:49:23.645 --> 01:49:27.147]  I mean, it's a globalist plan to bring us down.
[01:49:27.147 --> 01:49:28.147]  Shut down the farms.
[01:49:28.147 --> 01:49:29.108]  What do you make of all this?
[01:49:30.779 --> 01:49:33.120]  Well, I'll read the rest of the article here.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:45.683]  Why is a software company based in Barcelona, Spain, S-C-Y-T-L, now in charge of counting our votes in the upcoming general election on November 6th?
[01:49:45.683 --> 01:49:49.143]  Did the Federal Elections Commission approve this?
[01:49:49.143 --> 01:49:52.344]  Did the Congress of the United States approve this?
[01:49:52.344 --> 01:49:56.705]  Was this done by executive order from the White House?
[01:49:56.705 --> 01:49:59.806]  In the final step, is this the final step?
[01:50:00.609 --> 01:50:07.555]  Of Obama rigging the 2012 election and the formation of a global government.
[01:50:07.555 --> 01:50:10.697]  Why is the AP not covering this?
[01:50:10.697 --> 01:50:13.779]  Why is Fox News not covering this?
[01:50:13.779 --> 01:50:22.786]  What we now have is a socialist CEO running the world's voting and election counts.
[01:50:22.786 --> 01:50:29.592]  Talk about a UN, Marxist, Communist dream come true.
[01:50:30.643 --> 01:50:33.443]  Yeah, I actually found that it was in Market Watch.
[01:50:33.443 --> 01:50:37.384]  Spanish company will count American votes in November.
[01:50:37.384 --> 01:50:38.484]  And there it is.
[01:50:38.484 --> 01:50:40.145]  Well, good job bringing that up, caller.
[01:50:40.145 --> 01:50:41.745]  That's why I need to get to more calls.
[01:50:41.745 --> 01:50:43.065]  Excellent point.
[01:50:43.065 --> 01:50:50.726]  We're going to make a little call to check on the Bilderburgers coming up.
[01:50:50.726 --> 01:50:52.527]  And then we'll continue with your phone calls.
[01:50:52.527 --> 01:50:54.047]  We've got a guest coming up.
[01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:59.248]  But up next, we're going to talk to Barbara and others.
[01:50:59.248 --> 01:50:59.828]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:06.785]  Are you sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:51:06.785 --> 01:51:09.207]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:51:09.207 --> 01:51:18.315]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:51:18.315 --> 01:51:21.758]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:51:21.758 --> 01:51:23.439]  There's no priming required.
[01:51:23.439 --> 01:51:25.721]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[01:51:25.721 --> 01:51:28.223]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:51:29.284 --> 01:51:30.805]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:51:30.805 --> 01:51:32.225]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:51:32.225 --> 01:51:35.387]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:51:35.387 --> 01:51:38.768]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:51:38.768 --> 01:51:40.669]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:42.910]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:45.652]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:51:45.652 --> 01:51:47.232]  It's what my family uses.

[01:54:20.275 --> 01:54:22.336]  Okay!
[01:54:22.336 --> 01:54:28.999]  We are now dialing the Marriott in Chantilly, Virginia to ask them about booking a hotel.
[01:54:31.693 --> 01:54:33.274]  Hey, hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:54:33.274 --> 01:54:48.667]  I'm a radio host and I'd like to book a hotel reservation and I was wondering if I could get one from May 31st until June 2nd there in your lovely hotel.
[01:54:48.667 --> 01:54:50.588]  I'd like three rooms, please.
[01:54:50.588 --> 01:54:52.350]  Let me connect you to the reservation.
[01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:52.770]  One moment.
[01:54:52.770 --> 01:54:53.511]  Okay, thank you.
[01:54:58.635 --> 01:55:02.716]  To ensure high quality service, your conversation may be recorded.
[01:55:02.716 --> 01:55:04.437]  Please see our privacy statement.
[01:55:04.437 --> 01:55:08.078]  And the NSA is recording everything as well.
[01:55:08.078 --> 01:55:11.039]  Take your vaccines.
[01:55:11.039 --> 01:55:15.300]  We want to protect your info, because the NSA takes it all anyways.
[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:17.600]  It's Marriott.
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:21.182]  We know what it takes for you to be revived, refreshed, and re-energized.
[01:55:21.182 --> 01:55:22.882]  Y'all remember what you ate last Friday?
[01:55:22.882 --> 01:55:24.242]  The NSA remembers.
[01:55:24.242 --> 01:55:25.983]  We will make sure you're ready to go.
[01:55:34.515 --> 01:55:35.155]  Well, here we go.
[01:55:35.155 --> 01:55:39.799]  That's some nice elevator music there.
[01:55:39.799 --> 01:55:42.461]  But I'm glad that they're recording this.
[01:55:42.461 --> 01:55:44.543]  So are we.
[01:55:44.543 --> 01:55:47.905]  Broadcasting it is, that is.
[01:55:47.905 --> 01:55:54.391]  Boy, must be a busy day over there at the Marriott Chantilly.
[01:55:54.391 --> 01:55:55.912]  I kind of like that elevator music, though.
[01:55:58.188 --> 01:56:01.752]  Kind of in a classic American style architecture there.
[01:56:01.752 --> 01:56:05.175]  The world leaders would arrive up front and they'd play their national anthem.
[01:56:05.175 --> 01:56:06.757]  But then of course the media said it didn't exist.
[01:56:13.468 --> 01:56:18.252]  Let your mind wander while we put fluoride in the water.
[01:56:18.252 --> 01:56:23.816]  Enjoy fluoride and other chemicals added to the tap water as we give you Chantilly, Virginia government water.
[01:56:23.816 --> 01:56:29.180]  Nearby defense contractors dedicated to Satan worship are just a quick stroll away.
[01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:38.648]  If you're checking in in late May or early June, you won't be able to check in because black op commanders will be meeting, picking your next president.
[01:56:39.835 --> 01:56:44.978]  If world leaders arrive and the media tries to cover it, there will be a news media blackout.
[01:56:44.978 --> 01:56:51.881]  Again, Tucker's saying is pretty much on for that meeting, but I thought you might want to hear it.
[01:56:51.881 --> 01:56:57.864]  Whenever we do these videos calling the FBI, calling the White House, people are like, there's no way he really called them.
[01:56:57.864 --> 01:57:01.046]  That's too scary!
[01:57:01.046 --> 01:57:02.967]  His callers are fake too!
[01:57:02.967 --> 01:57:03.767]  None of it's real!
[01:57:07.198 --> 01:57:09.380]  Oh, they don't care about me.
[01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:11.761]  Let your mind wander.
[01:57:11.761 --> 01:57:14.923]  Have hearty samplings of the fluoride tap water.
[01:57:14.923 --> 01:57:18.526]  Spanish company contracts with 900 U.S.
[01:57:18.526 --> 01:57:19.887]  jurisdictions to count the votes.
[01:57:19.887 --> 01:57:22.288]  Well, Spanish companies run most of the toll roads.
[01:57:22.288 --> 01:57:24.210]  It's globalism.
[01:57:24.210 --> 01:57:26.611]  It's all the old robber barons and royalty.
[01:57:26.611 --> 01:57:28.252]  Government just gives them our infrastructure.
[01:57:28.252 --> 01:57:29.253]  In fact, a lot of them say pay them.
[01:57:29.253 --> 01:57:31.714]  It's like, we'll pay you to take General Motors.
[01:57:31.714 --> 01:57:32.635]  Then move it to China.
[01:57:32.635 --> 01:57:33.255]  Build the Cadillacs.
[01:57:33.255 --> 01:57:33.696]  How's that sound?
[01:57:34.599 --> 01:57:39.762]  We'll pay ya, and our public's so mind-numb watching football they won't care, and they're like, very good.
[01:57:39.762 --> 01:57:44.404]  All you Chinese gotta do is have four... Hello ma'am, how are you doing?
[01:57:44.404 --> 01:57:45.645]  Fine, how are you?
[01:57:45.645 --> 01:57:46.825]  I am super excited.
[01:57:46.825 --> 01:57:48.326]  That's good.
[01:57:48.326 --> 01:57:53.689]  Hey, I need to check in, I need three rooms, the 31st of May through the 2nd of June.
[01:57:53.689 --> 01:57:59.332]  So, sorry, two nights, leaving on the 2nd?
[01:57:59.332 --> 01:58:00.852]  Yes ma'am, do you have any availability then?
[01:58:00.852 --> 01:58:01.993]  Let me see.
[01:58:06.519 --> 01:58:09.401]  Nothing available at this property.
[01:58:09.401 --> 01:58:10.582]  Uh, I'm going to be staying nearby.
[01:58:10.582 --> 01:58:11.963]  Can I come by the bar and have a beer?
[01:58:11.963 --> 01:58:14.805]  Sure.
[01:58:14.805 --> 01:58:15.606]  Really?
[01:58:15.606 --> 01:58:17.007]  Why is nothing available on those days?
[01:58:17.007 --> 01:58:19.529]  Are you just all booked up or is it a conference?
[01:58:19.529 --> 01:58:20.990]  Yeah, it's all booked.
[01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:25.673]  They're giving... There's four Marriott alternatives in the area.
[01:58:25.673 --> 01:58:31.478]  No, but we want to be there with the Bilderberg Group because Obama was there four years ago when I was there.
[01:58:31.478 --> 01:58:32.158]  Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:32.158 --> 01:58:33.059]  You know about them, right ma'am?
[01:58:35.354 --> 01:58:37.856]  Oh good, oh yeah, get me somebody about them.
[01:58:37.856 --> 01:58:41.659]  One moment.
[01:58:41.659 --> 01:58:45.202]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:12.107]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:12.107 --> 01:59:16.191]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:59:16.191 --> 01:59:18.132]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:59:20.598 --> 01:59:25.201]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.

[01:59:29.043 --> 01:59:30.264]  Others don't.

[01:59:48.775 --> 01:59:49.636]  Others don't.
[01:59:54.033 --> 01:59:56.418]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.418 --> 01:59:59.203]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.782 --> 02:00:10.625]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.625 --> 02:00:12.207]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.207 --> 02:00:13.768]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.768 --> 02:00:17.530]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.530 --> 02:00:20.412]  Honey, can you turn that radio down in the background there?
[02:00:20.412 --> 02:00:27.217]  I'm trying to book us a visit with the Bilderberg Group coming up on May 31st into June 2nd.
[02:00:27.217 --> 02:00:29.819]  And I was talking to a nice lady at Marriott.
[02:00:29.819 --> 02:00:31.300]  Ma'am, yes, I want to be there.
[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:33.001]  I want to be part of the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[02:00:33.001 --> 02:00:33.602]  Can I come to that?
[02:00:34.701 --> 02:00:36.401]  I'm sorry, but I'm not finding a builder.
[02:00:36.401 --> 02:00:37.862]  You're saying builder?
[02:00:37.862 --> 02:00:39.722]  Builderberg Conference.
[02:00:39.722 --> 02:00:42.523]  Well, I mean, you're saying you have no rooms available that date.
[02:00:42.523 --> 02:00:44.443]  I know why, because the conference.
[02:00:44.443 --> 02:00:46.283]  But I'm with the conference.
[02:00:46.283 --> 02:00:49.664]  But there isn't one under Builderberg.
[02:00:49.664 --> 02:00:50.524]  Builderberg.
[02:00:50.524 --> 02:00:52.505]  Well, what's the name of the conference you've got then?
[02:00:52.505 --> 02:00:57.026]  Sorry.
[02:00:57.026 --> 02:00:58.926]  What conference has you booked for that time?
[02:01:03.624 --> 02:01:10.246]  Yeah, well, last time there was a Lockheed the day before, and then... Okay, well, I'm sure... Okay, but it's not Bilderberg, because it is Bilderberg.
[02:01:10.246 --> 02:01:12.486]  Maybe they give it... I don't even know which one it is.
[02:01:12.486 --> 02:01:14.267]  Which names do you have there?
[02:01:14.267 --> 02:01:15.587]  No, but I have several.
[02:01:15.587 --> 02:01:16.167]  Well, what are they?
[02:01:16.167 --> 02:01:17.748]  Maybe we can find it.
[02:01:17.748 --> 02:01:21.189]  Do you know another name it could be under?
[02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.689]  Uh, what?
[02:01:21.689 --> 02:01:23.730]  Yeah, it was supposed to be under Bilderberg.
[02:01:23.730 --> 02:01:26.530]  It was supposed to be under Conference.
[02:01:26.530 --> 02:01:28.071]  Uh, Conference Group Discussion.
[02:01:28.071 --> 02:01:32.352]  Now, one moment, please.
[02:01:35.623 --> 02:01:36.243]  Halliburton?
[02:01:36.243 --> 02:01:40.024]  Let me check, one moment.
[02:01:40.024 --> 02:01:49.987]  Maybe... Honey, I'm supposed to go to this conference, and I can't figure it out here.
[02:01:49.987 --> 02:01:54.929]  Well, baby, I'm gonna get you that information here in a minute.
[02:01:54.929 --> 02:01:55.829]  Thank you, sweetie pie.
[02:02:02.378 --> 02:02:06.139]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are trying to book ourselves into the hotel here.
[02:02:06.139 --> 02:02:11.121]  Alright, here's some more elevator music.
[02:02:11.121 --> 02:02:13.162]  Man, I like elevator music.
[02:02:13.162 --> 02:02:17.603]  I actually had one of my friends make me an elevator music CD I play in my car sometimes.
[02:02:17.603 --> 02:02:25.226]  You know, that Snitch Society video I did was pretty good.
[02:02:31.759 --> 02:02:32.860]  All right, that's enough for now.
[02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:33.480]  We're done.
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:34.340]  We're done.
[02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:35.521]  Thank you, ma'am.
[02:02:35.521 --> 02:02:36.641]  Oh, she's there listening.
[02:02:36.641 --> 02:02:37.061]  That's good.
[02:02:37.061 --> 02:02:40.843]  Disconnected.
[02:02:40.843 --> 02:02:41.403]  All righty.
[02:02:41.403 --> 02:02:44.745]  Well, that was pretty silly.
[02:02:44.745 --> 02:02:47.486]  I could have been a little slicker, but I was too busy laughing at her.
[02:02:47.486 --> 02:02:54.949]  I'm like, well, what's the name of it if it's not Bilderberg?
[02:02:54.949 --> 02:02:59.451]  David Rockefeller and the hero Bill Gates.
[02:03:00.746 --> 02:03:05.269]  Sure, they write publications about how they want you to die.
[02:03:05.269 --> 02:03:08.991]  But they've got a shot they want to give you in the thigh.
[02:03:08.991 --> 02:03:13.093]  Cause they want you to be happy.
[02:03:13.093 --> 02:03:17.795]  Sure, they talk about euthanizing grandma.
[02:03:17.795 --> 02:03:22.238]  And sure, they give kids polio with their program.
[02:03:22.238 --> 02:03:29.542]  46,000 in India last year paralyzed children.
[02:03:31.107 --> 02:03:36.671]  Cause Bill Gates is a hero!
[02:03:36.671 --> 02:03:37.211]  Oh!
[02:03:37.211 --> 02:03:44.276]  Sweetie Pie, Billy Gates, he wants you to eat GMO!
[02:03:44.276 --> 02:03:47.659]  La la la la la!
[02:03:47.659 --> 02:03:52.542]  The New World Order loves you!
[02:03:52.542 --> 02:03:53.743]  Oh yeah!
[02:03:53.743 --> 02:03:55.384]  They're friendly too!
[02:03:55.384 --> 02:03:56.385]  Ha ha ha!
[02:03:59.062 --> 02:04:03.526]  Come on in and let your mind wander on fluoride and Prozac.
[02:04:03.526 --> 02:04:08.630]  Enjoy the cancer rate exploding and neurological disorder.
[02:04:08.630 --> 02:04:09.831]  Oh, it's wonderful.
[02:04:09.831 --> 02:04:12.993]  Sports are coming up on SportsCenter.
[02:04:12.993 --> 02:04:14.415]  Oh, yeah.
[02:04:14.415 --> 02:04:17.237]  Obama's announcing he's a dictator.
[02:04:17.237 --> 02:04:18.998]  Oh, they're going to take my guns for no reason?
[02:04:18.998 --> 02:04:20.620]  No law?
[02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:21.540]  Oh, world government?
[02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:23.942]  I'll pay my carbon taxes to them?
[02:04:23.942 --> 02:04:25.624]  They want to ban over-the-counter vitamins?
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:28.901]  Only want to raise property taxes?
[02:04:28.901 --> 02:04:30.241]  Oh.
[02:04:30.241 --> 02:04:31.742]  Kill babies up to age three?
[02:04:31.742 --> 02:04:33.143]  That's reasonable.
[02:04:33.143 --> 02:04:35.264]  I'm not against that.
[02:04:35.264 --> 02:04:37.885]  Oh, it's a wonderful land.
[02:04:37.885 --> 02:04:40.766]  New World Order.
[02:04:40.766 --> 02:04:44.688]  Bill Gates, he loves you.
[02:04:45.697 --> 02:04:59.929]  Sweetie pie, Bill Gates Oh, he loves you, he wants to help you Bill Gates, a friendly guy Take the shots, you'll go to the sky

[02:06:58.297 --> 02:07:05.343]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.343 --> 02:07:09.666]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.666 --> 02:07:10.147]  Number two,
[02:07:10.527 --> 02:07:15.410]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:16.151]  It's true.
[02:07:16.151 --> 02:07:21.034]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:21.034 --> 02:07:21.854]  Number three.
[02:07:21.854 --> 02:07:25.437]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.437 --> 02:07:29.359]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.359 --> 02:07:30.160]  Number four.
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:32.922]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.922 --> 02:07:36.264]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.584 --> 02:07:41.526]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.526 --> 02:07:46.568]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.568 --> 02:07:50.749]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.749 --> 02:07:52.530]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:08:02.287 --> 02:08:09.352]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.352 --> 02:08:20.378]  Well, Dr. Joseph Mercola is a giant when it comes to the huge awakening that's happened, to the additives, the GMO, the fluoride, all of it.
[02:08:20.378 --> 02:08:27.143]  And he has, of course, Mercola.com, an invaluable site for news and information that I visit every few days at least.
[02:08:28.832 --> 02:08:30.734]  A lot of great research there.
[02:08:30.734 --> 02:08:33.496]  He's been passionate about health and technology for most of his life.
[02:08:33.496 --> 02:08:37.399]  A doctor of osteopathic medicine, he treated many thousands of patients over 20 years.
[02:08:37.399 --> 02:08:47.948]  In the mid-90s, he integrated his passion for natural health with modern technology via the internet and developed a website, Mercola.com, to spread the word about natural ways to achieve optimal health.
[02:08:47.948 --> 02:08:51.211]  And he's a best-selling author, researcher, you name it.
[02:08:51.211 --> 02:08:53.112]  And he joins us here
[02:08:54.193 --> 02:09:00.595]  Today for the balance of the hour and I got a lot of questions I want to get into but I want this state
[02:09:01.357 --> 02:09:03.518]  You know, we get the State of the Union from Barack Obama.
[02:09:03.518 --> 02:09:27.513]  I want the state from his view and research and focus on the battle for health and Big Pharma wanting to block that, what seems like an explosive awakening across the board, people wanting labeling to get away from GMO, the system moving to block that, the basic right to be able to see on something if it does have genetically engineered organisms in it or cross-species.
[02:09:27.513 --> 02:09:29.775]  So what is the state of things right now?
[02:09:31.565 --> 02:09:35.929]  How is the Rebel Alliance via Liberty doing versus the Empire striking back?
[02:09:35.929 --> 02:09:46.217]  And then I want to get into what's number one on his radar screen and what, I mean, of course, Mercola.com covered a lot every day, but what he's been really focusing on as of late.
[02:09:46.217 --> 02:09:47.377]  Doc, great to have you with us.
[02:09:47.377 --> 02:09:49.639]  Hadn't been on probably five years.
[02:09:49.639 --> 02:09:51.921]  Yes, thanks for having me on today, Alex.
[02:09:51.921 --> 02:09:54.603]  I really appreciate the opportunity.
[02:09:54.603 --> 02:09:55.524]  Well, you heard the question.
[02:09:55.524 --> 02:09:56.765]  What's the state of things right now?
[02:09:57.995 --> 02:10:02.939]  Well, it's certainly challenged as your readers and listeners certainly know.
[02:10:02.939 --> 02:10:24.556]  But we seem to be making some levels of improvement and one of the biggest initiatives we have is the California Ballot Initiative which has a really strong possibility of eliminating genetically engineered foods from the entire United States just as it was done in Europe and even China.
[02:10:24.556 --> 02:10:27.158]  China doesn't allow these foods in their country.
[02:10:29.804 --> 02:10:34.886]  It seems like the momentum is starting to shift towards common sense, though, and health.
[02:10:34.886 --> 02:10:37.567]  We see the feds raiding people for no reason.
[02:10:37.567 --> 02:10:40.868]  All of that going on.
[02:10:40.868 --> 02:10:44.809]  How do you see the battle going?
[02:10:44.809 --> 02:10:46.410]  Well, from what perspective?
[02:10:50.831 --> 02:11:20.471]  Making efforts in a variety of areas to suppress it even more and it's just really sickening at best to see the examples continuously that Get thrown before us and of how they're effectively able to suppress this information and make You know progress that way, but I think you know really the challenges is to educate people give them information So they can make their own Free choices once they have once they're properly informed
[02:11:21.311 --> 02:11:35.400]  Sure, to boil the question down, it just looks like, well it doesn't look like it's a fact, there's a giant offensive against family farms, against raw milk, against vitamins, against labeling, just against everybody, and I see that.
[02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:55.232]  As a response to the big awakening I'm seeing as a syndicated radio host, I was just asking you, because you're probably one of the most, if not the most, prominent person out there covering these issues in a professional, accurate way, what your read of the situation is as, say, a general in the wellness movement.
[02:11:57.805 --> 02:12:00.246]  Well, it's difficult to give you a really specific answer on that.
[02:12:00.246 --> 02:12:24.540]  You know, we certainly identify very specific examples of the challenges that are being put forth by this, you know, the corporate interest, the collusion and the fascism between major international corporations and the government and how they're able to centrally cherry pick many
[02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:25.641]  Thank you
[02:12:37.151 --> 02:12:37.691]  Thank you.
[02:12:57.412 --> 02:13:10.017]  And now we notice, Doc, they're moving in to try to shut down the web and trying to curtail it and trying to... What's the biggest threats right now to health freedom that's on your radar?
[02:13:10.017 --> 02:13:12.138]  The biggest threats to health freedom?
[02:13:12.138 --> 02:13:16.219]  Well, it would seem to be an unbridled
[02:13:19.536 --> 02:13:21.917]  Continued implementation of what's currently going on.
[02:13:21.917 --> 02:13:24.359]  I think we need to have some big changes really soon.
[02:13:24.359 --> 02:13:27.820]  But I don't perceive it as any single biggest threat.
[02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:29.861]  It's coming from so many different sides.
[02:13:29.861 --> 02:13:39.966]  You know, I think that the economy is really a big one, and certainly you talk about that, but the banking institutions and their complete control over pretty much almost everything.
[02:13:39.966 --> 02:13:43.528]  And, you know, it makes it a real challenge to get anything done.
[02:13:43.528 --> 02:13:45.829]  And, you know, they've certainly
[02:13:46.389 --> 02:13:56.222]  Devastated the economy to date and they continue to print trillions of dollars and that's a real big challenge when you're trying to make serious improvements for your health.
[02:13:56.222 --> 02:13:58.645]  Now what's number one on your plate right now?
[02:13:58.645 --> 02:13:59.727]  What do you think is most important?
[02:13:59.727 --> 02:14:01.829]  And then I've got a whole laundry list of questions.
[02:14:01.829 --> 02:14:02.911]  We're gonna open the phones up for you.
[02:14:04.147 --> 02:14:16.113]  Well, we are very excited about this California ballot initiatives because we believe that this is an opportunity to actually eliminate genetically engineered food just as they did in Europe.
[02:14:16.113 --> 02:14:25.378]  So, it's virtually impossible because of Monsanto's collusion with the federal government and regulatory agencies to pass any type of legislative process.
[02:14:25.378 --> 02:14:28.119]  In fact, just last week you probably were aware and reported on that
[02:14:28.459 --> 02:14:39.191]  Vermont had almost unanimously passed this genetically engineered labeling law, but then Monsanto threatened them with suing the whole state, so they backed off on it.
[02:14:39.191 --> 02:14:39.912]  Why back off?
[02:14:39.912 --> 02:14:45.077]  It's like when the TSA said they'd blockade Texas if we didn't let TSA fondle little boys and girls.
[02:14:45.077 --> 02:14:46.439]  Why not call their bluff?
[02:14:46.439 --> 02:14:48.181]  I mean, why didn't Vermont say bring it on?
[02:14:48.181 --> 02:14:49.242]  The people would back them up!
[02:14:50.242 --> 02:14:52.364]  Well, it's an expense.
[02:14:52.364 --> 02:14:58.230]  They didn't want to invest tens of billions of dollars in legal processes, but that was the justification for it.
[02:14:58.230 --> 02:15:10.262]  But it's just an example that the current process is so sophisticated and cleverly manipulated by Monsanto and other big corporations that it's virtually impossible to have a legislative challenge.
[02:15:11.002 --> 02:15:11.422]  I don't
[02:15:32.998 --> 02:15:33.338]  We're good to go.
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:55.540]  Thank you.
[02:16:12.650 --> 02:16:39.483]  Acting in exactly what you'd expect so they're not going to have a label for California label for the rest of the country they're going to if because of Previous studies have shown that once you put the genetically engineered label on it That's all this legislation is required is for it to label it give people a choice That it's almost like putting the skull and crossbones on it and people 80 to 90 percent people will freely choose not to purchase that item and as you know doc the articles from the late 90s in the Monsanto
[02:16:40.765 --> 02:16:45.112]  Cafeterias where their scientists eat, they demand non-GMO.
[02:16:45.112 --> 02:16:50.360]  And so if they dare try to sue the state because people want something labeled, imagine that in court.
[02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:51.582]  Okay, well then you eat it!
[02:16:51.582 --> 02:16:52.644]  Huh?
[02:16:53.311 --> 02:16:54.452]  Absolutely.
[02:16:54.452 --> 02:17:08.379]  So, we're really excited about this process, but there's about a handful of companies, Mercola.com being one, that have donated about $3 million to date, Lundberg Farms, Nature's Path, Organic Consumers Association.
[02:17:08.379 --> 02:17:19.285]  So, we're expecting Monsanto to put in over $100 million to finance the propaganda campaign in California to defeat this initiative.
[02:17:19.945 --> 02:17:45.892]  And we don't have a hundred million dollars but we do have you know a large volunteer effort and the people who are listening to this so you know Monday we're launching a money bomb against Monsanto so if any of your listeners would be willing to participate in that they can really help this effort to to really fight what I perceive one of the biggest threats to to the very survivability of the human race which is this massive intrusion of food that was never designed to be here and really cross
[02:17:46.492 --> 02:17:54.255]  Doc, I want to talk about that because we see neurological disorders, autism across the board, other diseases exploding, and all the big studies, scientific that are out there,
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:15.242]  With many of these GMO crops, they have organ failure, near total sterility in three generations, in the guinea pigs and rats and things.
[02:18:15.242 --> 02:18:22.443]  And now, we're just a generation or so, you know, 20 years or so in the life cycle into this, and we're seeing a lot of it.
[02:18:22.443 --> 02:18:26.584]  And as you know, they've never really allowed testing of GMO in humans.
[02:18:26.584 --> 02:18:33.926]  And, I mean, when this all starts to come out, will Monsanto get in trouble, or will they just get a slap on the wrist like Dioxin and Agent Orange?
[02:18:35.051 --> 02:18:48.516]  Well, you know, they so effectively control the Federal Regulatory Agencies that at every single level, and we've constructed a graph that's on our site that kind of shows these connections and identifies the specific individuals.
[02:18:48.516 --> 02:18:52.197]  But it's hard to imagine that any significant penalties coming down, just like the bankers.
[02:18:52.197 --> 02:18:54.458]  I mean, these bankers have stole trillions of dollars.
[02:18:54.458 --> 02:18:56.679]  Any single one of them ever went to jail?
[02:18:56.679 --> 02:18:57.379]  No!
[02:18:57.379 --> 02:18:58.600]  Because they control the system.
[02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:00.440]  So I'm not expecting that.
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:04.182]  I mean, we're just hoping that we can allow people the freedom of choice to do that.
[02:19:04.822 --> 02:19:11.245]  But you're right, there's a study that was just recently done that showed that one of the toxins in most genetically engineered foods do one of two things.
[02:19:11.245 --> 02:19:24.390]  They either produce a resistance to a very potent herbicide called Roundup or Glyphosate, and that's the vast majority, maybe 85%, and then the rest of them produce a Bt toxin, which is an insecticide.
[02:19:24.390 --> 02:19:28.492]  And this Bt toxin was actually recently shown in some studies to wind up
[02:19:28.892 --> 02:19:36.915]  In the blood supply of pregnant women and their babies that were born, it's like 85% of them have this toxin in their blood supply.
[02:19:36.915 --> 02:19:41.817]  And we're told that there's no complications, but no one's ever looked at it.
[02:19:41.817 --> 02:19:44.318]  And we know infant mortality is starting to go back up.
[02:19:44.318 --> 02:19:48.039]  Let me see, the pesticide kills bugs, but then we're supposed to eat it.
[02:19:49.273 --> 02:19:56.187]  Again, the plant grows its own pesticide and they have to have refuge areas growing for the bugs of normal food.
[02:19:56.187 --> 02:19:58.151]  Can we just have the refuge corn?
[02:19:58.151 --> 02:19:58.672]  We'll be back.
[02:20:01.443 --> 02:20:06.948]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:20:06.948 --> 02:20:09.370]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:20:09.370 --> 02:20:15.054]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[02:20:15.054 --> 02:20:18.477]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.

[02:20:30.987 --> 02:20:32.407]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:20:32.407 --> 02:20:35.548]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:20:35.548 --> 02:20:38.950]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:43.091]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:20:43.091 --> 02:20:45.832]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:20:45.832 --> 02:20:47.393]  It's what my family uses.

[02:24:05.063 --> 02:24:07.725]  We're about to have big breaking news.
[02:24:07.725 --> 02:24:14.171]  You know, it's one of the biggest stories out there that Obama is going to ban children doing chores for their parents on farms.
[02:24:14.171 --> 02:24:17.735]  That's how the family farm trains the next generation.
[02:24:17.735 --> 02:24:19.937]  The children enjoy the work.
[02:24:19.937 --> 02:24:22.960]  That's why we have summers, is so children can work on the farm.
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:24.561]  This is a total assault.
[02:24:24.561 --> 02:24:28.265]  Now rural Montana religious colonies fight labor law.
[02:24:28.265 --> 02:24:30.206]  They're coming to shut down the Mennonites and Amish.
[02:24:31.067 --> 02:24:33.430]  They've already got CPS circling them.
[02:24:33.430 --> 02:24:42.841]  This is all part of a total domestication and making us eat GMO directly linked to organ failure in every mammal they tested on.
[02:24:42.841 --> 02:24:46.306]  Monkeys, rodents, you name it.
[02:24:46.306 --> 02:24:48.829]  I mean, literally hundreds of studies.
[02:24:48.829 --> 02:24:49.169]  Hundreds.
[02:24:50.106 --> 02:25:00.169]  And going back to Dr. Mercola, who is our guest today at Mercola.com, really great to have you here with us today because I just really respect the work you're doing and also the activism you're involved in.
[02:25:00.169 --> 02:25:03.810]  People should support that money bomb coming up, I guess you said Monday.
[02:25:03.810 --> 02:25:14.994]  But how does the attack on rural communities, organic farming, farmers markets, whole milk, I know you see it out there, the ban, you know, attacking backyard chickens,
[02:25:16.514 --> 02:25:20.095]  Saying you gotta get a license to have a garden?
[02:25:20.095 --> 02:25:32.740]  Why is the system so scared and declaring war, or if you disagree with me, tell me they're not, on any form of true local sustainability in the name of sustainability?
[02:25:32.740 --> 02:25:36.602]  So when your question is the system, you mean the government is scared?
[02:25:36.602 --> 02:25:40.263]  Yeah, I mean big pharma, big agri, all I see is an all-out assault
[02:25:41.821 --> 02:25:47.162]  Against just any choice, any freedom, anything healthy, the farms, everything.
[02:25:47.162 --> 02:25:48.703]  Why are they doing this?
[02:25:48.703 --> 02:26:01.386]  Well, fear, I think, is really the center of the motivation and is a very effective tool that powerful and small groups of people use to manipulate the masses.
[02:26:01.386 --> 02:26:07.348]  So if you can effectively utilize that tool, you can control large numbers of people.
[02:26:07.348 --> 02:26:08.128]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:26:09.241 --> 02:26:22.447]  So they're seeking to instill fear in people from making simple choices and motivate their actions and behaviors based on that fear.
[02:26:22.447 --> 02:26:24.607]  Oh, so they're trying to intimidate people.
[02:26:24.607 --> 02:26:32.911]  All I see it doing is making it avant-garde and cool and people are rushing out and trying to start farming and things.
[02:26:34.625 --> 02:26:42.507]  Well, that's the practical side effect from it, but they're trying to discourage that with these fear tactics.
[02:26:42.507 --> 02:26:43.827]  No, I agree with you.
[02:26:43.827 --> 02:26:48.468]  I agree they're trying to discourage it, but I'm saying I don't see it working.
[02:26:48.468 --> 02:26:49.788]  No, no, I would agree also.
[02:26:49.788 --> 02:27:03.591]  I think that people are smarter than that, and we still have some of the revolutionary spirit still left in this country, and as a result, people are inspired to really react and respond the way that our ancestors did.
[02:27:04.904 --> 02:27:06.024]  Amazing.
[02:27:06.024 --> 02:27:08.985]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up and I want to take some calls.
[02:27:08.985 --> 02:27:17.127]  The toll free number for people to join us if they want to talk to Dr. Mercola is 800-259-9231.
[02:27:17.127 --> 02:27:19.507]  What else do you think is an important battle area?
[02:27:19.507 --> 02:27:23.388]  Obviously getting the GMO labels so we can make a choice.
[02:27:23.388 --> 02:27:25.229]  Wow, revolutionary idea.
[02:27:25.229 --> 02:27:26.469]  What else is front and center?
[02:27:28.229 --> 02:27:35.212]  Well, before I answer that, I just wanted to comment on one of the statements you made with respect to all these research studies showing the dangers of GMOs.
[02:27:35.212 --> 02:27:42.975]  Well, there would be a lot more if it wasn't for the manipulation and the fraud and deceit that these major corporations like Monsanto have implemented.
[02:27:42.975 --> 02:27:55.861]  Do you know, and you may not realize this because it's not widely appreciated, that it is illegal, illegal, Alex, for any research scientist to do an independent study on genetically engineered foods because it's a trademark
[02:27:56.281 --> 02:27:58.163]  Yes, I was aware of that.
[02:27:58.163 --> 02:28:00.546]  Well then how do other countries and people release these studies?
[02:28:00.546 --> 02:28:01.187]  They just don't care?
[02:28:15.976 --> 02:28:16.456]  I don't know.
[02:28:16.456 --> 02:28:18.337]  I mean, it's beyond me.
[02:28:18.337 --> 02:28:28.462]  Certainly, Monsanto throws tens of millions, if not more, dollars at seeking to prevent this type of information from being widely disseminated.
[02:28:28.462 --> 02:28:30.623]  Well, to me, the evidence is clear.
[02:28:30.623 --> 02:28:31.864]  They're starting to lose, though.
[02:28:31.864 --> 02:28:35.706]  For all their bully tactics, for all of it, the momentum is shifting against them.
[02:28:36.383 --> 02:28:37.485]  Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[02:28:37.485 --> 02:28:38.706]  I mean, certainly it did in Europe.
[02:28:38.706 --> 02:28:47.819]  You know, once you give people the freedom of choice to make that decision whether or not they're going to choose to freely consume this type of food or not, they'll choose not to.
[02:28:47.819 --> 02:28:48.660]  If they're informed!
[02:28:49.352 --> 02:28:55.256]  And that's what we're seeking to do with the Citizens' Ballot Initiative California to defeat Monsanto.
[02:28:55.256 --> 02:28:57.857]  And this could be, I mean, this is a very limited window of opportunity.
[02:28:57.857 --> 02:29:01.059]  If we miss this window, I don't know that there'll be another one.
[02:29:01.059 --> 02:29:04.261]  And that this may be the beginning of the end of the food supply in the United States.
[02:29:04.261 --> 02:29:05.902]  So it's a really important issue.
[02:29:05.902 --> 02:29:09.344]  And that's why, you know, we're so excited about this because it really is
[02:29:09.964 --> 02:29:11.325]  It's sort of like their Achilles heel.
[02:29:11.325 --> 02:29:13.947]  It's a classic David versus Goliath battle.
[02:29:13.947 --> 02:29:17.149]  And we are David on steroids and they are Goliath.
[02:29:17.149 --> 02:29:27.217]  And they control the federal regulators and they outnumber us massively in their ability to fund this type of propaganda campaign they're going to throw at us.
[02:29:28.496 --> 02:29:29.716]  Powerful information.
[02:29:29.716 --> 02:29:35.998]  We're going to take calls and cover a lot more with an amazing guest and a hard guy to get on the show.
[02:29:35.998 --> 02:29:38.399]  Dr. Joseph Mercola, Mercola.com.
[02:29:38.399 --> 02:29:40.720]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:42.940]  The battle for freedom is now.
[02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:44.361]  Join it.
[02:29:44.361 --> 02:29:45.941]  Many hands make light work.
[02:29:45.941 --> 02:29:50.603]  Together, we will defeat these Monopoly men tyrants.
[02:29:50.603 --> 02:29:52.023]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.023 --> 02:29:54.544]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.544 --> 02:29:57.225]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:17.989 --> 02:31:21.450]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:31:21.450 --> 02:31:23.131]  There's no priming required.
[02:31:23.131 --> 02:31:25.392]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:31:25.392 --> 02:31:27.913]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:31:28.973 --> 02:31:30.494]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:31:30.494 --> 02:31:31.915]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:31:31.915 --> 02:31:35.077]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:31:35.077 --> 02:31:38.459]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:31:38.459 --> 02:31:40.380]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:42.602]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:31:42.602 --> 02:31:45.343]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:31:45.343 --> 02:31:46.924]  It's what my family uses.
[02:31:46.924 --> 02:31:50.226]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:31:50.226 --> 02:31:55.490]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[02:31:56.050 --> 02:31:59.673]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:31:59.673 --> 02:32:02.115]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.115 --> 02:32:07.720]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:07.720 --> 02:32:12.744]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:32:12.744 --> 02:32:18.309]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:32:18.309 --> 02:32:22.993]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:32:23.513 --> 02:32:30.638]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:32:30.638 --> 02:32:31.759]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:31.759 --> 02:32:38.443]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:38.443 --> 02:32:41.625]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:41.625 --> 02:32:44.747]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:32:44.747 --> 02:32:44.947]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:44.947 --> 02:32:45.228]  Remember,
[02:32:53.573 --> 02:32:57.477]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:57.477 --> 02:33:09.387]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:33:09.387 --> 02:33:17.635]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:18.954 --> 02:33:23.499]  In other news, Kurt Nemo's article just went up at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:23.499 --> 02:33:31.108]  Obama ban on youth farm chores, part of a larger power grab.
[02:33:31.108 --> 02:33:32.589]  You want to understand Agenda 21?
[02:33:32.589 --> 02:33:34.992]  It's all right there in the article.
[02:33:34.992 --> 02:33:36.654]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:33:37.588 --> 02:33:49.395]  They've announced the Pentagon's involved, Homeland Security, flooding out, harassing, and the answer is, don't comply, don't talk to them, shun them, hate them in your community, or it's over.
[02:33:49.395 --> 02:33:53.518]  Okay, this is a federal invasion, which means a foreign banker invasion.
[02:33:53.518 --> 02:33:55.819]  There's a bunch of other incredible news.
[02:33:55.819 --> 02:34:05.706]  It has been confirmed, a caller called about an hour ago and pointed out, and it is in Market Watch, which is part of the Wall Street Journal, it is in the Examiner, it is true.
[02:34:06.587 --> 02:34:18.735]  That 900 major municipalities, in fact most of the country, will cast its ballots and it'll be master aggregated by a Spanish company that hold it, wait for this...
[02:34:21.513 --> 02:34:28.018]  The Spanish company is owned by its chief investment firm, George Soros.
[02:34:28.018 --> 02:34:33.162]  So George Soros, Stalin said, I don't care who casts the ballots, I only care who counts them.
[02:34:33.162 --> 02:34:38.467]  George Soros, to control majority of electronic voting machines.
[02:34:38.467 --> 02:34:42.870]  Bombshell info.
[02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:49.856]  But it doesn't matter, even if they can't get their Lord and Savior Obama in if there's too big a landslide, same big banks finance Mitt Romney.
[02:34:51.297 --> 02:34:55.831]  I mean, it really is dire straits, but the good news is, like Dr. Mercola was just saying,
[02:34:58.001 --> 02:34:59.242]  We're voting with our dollars.
[02:34:59.242 --> 02:35:01.143]  We're supporting alternative media.
[02:35:01.143 --> 02:35:02.644]  We're supporting freedom on the web.
[02:35:02.644 --> 02:35:04.625]  We're supporting organics.
[02:35:04.625 --> 02:35:06.287]  We're supporting labeling.
[02:35:06.287 --> 02:35:09.929]  And we have got to everybody plant a bigger garden.
[02:35:09.929 --> 02:35:11.610]  Everybody filter their water.
[02:35:11.610 --> 02:35:12.991]  Myself, I've been a slob.
[02:35:12.991 --> 02:35:14.232]  I've known about health.
[02:35:14.232 --> 02:35:15.413]  Used to be a sports addict.
[02:35:15.413 --> 02:35:17.334]  Then went the opposite direction.
[02:35:17.334 --> 02:35:19.115]  Got so busy in radio and TV for years.
[02:35:19.115 --> 02:35:19.956]  Stopped working out.
[02:35:19.956 --> 02:35:20.636]  Ate like a pig.
[02:35:20.636 --> 02:35:22.978]  I lost 40-something pounds.
[02:35:22.978 --> 02:35:25.339]  And I still need to lose another 25-30.
[02:35:25.339 --> 02:35:25.960]  And I'm gonna do it!
[02:35:27.681 --> 02:35:36.150]  But the point is that we need to rebel against this system by taking care of ourselves and getting along with our families and being civically involved.
[02:35:36.150 --> 02:35:45.319]  They're going to be at the Houston Metro meeting tomorrow fighting the TSA, who's now doing body searches and bag checks on the streets and in buses.
[02:35:45.319 --> 02:35:48.382]  The feds, out of their jurisdiction, doing what police can't do.
[02:35:49.298 --> 02:35:54.762]  Dr. Mercola, I want to get more into GMO, and I want to ask you other points you'd like to relay.
[02:35:54.762 --> 02:36:04.809]  The fight against fluoride, starting to have victories there before we go to calls, but connecting health freedom that you spearhead with all the other sectors out there.
[02:36:04.809 --> 02:36:10.974]  I mean, really, I think Americans now are having it thrown in their face that this really is tyranny.
[02:36:10.974 --> 02:36:13.175]  This is really happening.
[02:36:13.175 --> 02:36:15.437]  What's your take on just how crazy things have gotten?
[02:36:16.522 --> 02:36:17.784]  Well, I think it's fascism.
[02:36:17.784 --> 02:36:35.266]  I think a big crux of the problem is related to this incredible collusion between these international corporations and the government that essentially they're able to lobby and pass legislations to make it legal to manipulate and deceive people and really implement their agenda, which is to increase their bottom line profits.
[02:36:36.002 --> 02:36:40.984]  So, you know, our big mission is really to help people understand how to take control of their health.
[02:36:40.984 --> 02:36:43.205]  And I'm glad you're making efforts in that direction, too.
[02:36:43.205 --> 02:36:44.826]  But there's very simple strategies.
[02:36:44.826 --> 02:36:57.591]  The more you study health, the more you realize that it's really very basic and simple processes like getting away from sugar, exposing your skin to natural sunshine, exercising, you know, drinking plenty of clean water.
[02:36:57.591 --> 02:37:02.093]  These are simple strategies that really move your body towards health and away from disease.
[02:37:02.093 --> 02:37:05.014]  And the challenge, however, I realize that we're teaching people this for
[02:37:05.194 --> 02:37:05.995]  Well it's very simple.
[02:37:05.995 --> 02:37:07.116]  You're absolutely right.
[02:37:07.116 --> 02:37:07.796]  It's very simple.
[02:37:34.867 --> 02:37:36.588]  Just, it just hit me.
[02:37:36.588 --> 02:37:48.056]  Big Agra merged with Big Pharma openly is lobbying for the Food Safety Act that actually just shuts down local farms and lets Big Agra put out all their poison and get in trouble.
[02:37:48.056 --> 02:37:50.558]  They exempt themselves in the laws.
[02:37:50.558 --> 02:37:53.740]  But most family farms are barely hanging on.
[02:37:53.740 --> 02:38:02.867]  And if the children can't help with the chores, which they enjoy doing, I know I've done it, and learned how to drive the tractor and help get the eggs and, you know, help do stuff.
[02:38:03.567 --> 02:38:10.199]  A, they're not going to be able to carry out that tradition because they won't know how to do it, but B, that's going to bankrupt them.
[02:38:10.199 --> 02:38:13.686]  This is Big Agra shutting down their competition.
[02:38:13.686 --> 02:38:15.349]  This is so criminal!
[02:38:16.445 --> 02:38:17.186]  Absolutely.
[02:38:17.186 --> 02:38:26.957]  The person who runs our company was raised as a farm boy and you know it just imparted tremendous ethical and moral values.
[02:38:26.957 --> 02:38:35.627]  I mean when you're working that hard to provide a living for yourself and your family it makes a big difference and you know really molds a person into really a solid human being.
[02:38:36.949 --> 02:38:47.556]  I tell you, I mean, I've worked on farms just on the summers and then one year down in the country and for a large animal vet and that was, it's really good to be around people that really work.
[02:38:47.556 --> 02:38:54.902]  And then you come around the modern folks, they don't understand getting into the work and actually enjoying it.
[02:38:54.902 --> 02:39:00.626]  So many people I know do not understand the joy of working the land, especially when it's yours.
[02:39:01.446 --> 02:39:06.769]  And they're trying to kill one of the final American traditions that's left.
[02:39:06.769 --> 02:39:10.790]  It is so evil!
[02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:11.211]  I agree.
[02:39:11.211 --> 02:39:12.211]  It's a real challenge.
[02:39:12.211 --> 02:39:16.293]  And when those small farms go, it could be the beginning of the end.
[02:39:16.293 --> 02:39:26.978]  So we really need to take a firm stand against that, because that's a really important part of our ability to provide us with some of the basic foundational tools we need to stay healthy, which is healthy, good food.
[02:39:27.679 --> 02:39:38.526]  Well it's time to get aggressive too and realize that eating healthy, organics, farms, having local communities that support their local farms, is an absolute coffin nail to tyranny.
[02:39:38.526 --> 02:39:54.517]  And that they wouldn't have Animal ID and Premises ID to shut down the farms, they wouldn't do these staged events, a doctor that I'm sure you've seen the news, where to get Animal ID, Premises ID in, they'd give the blue ribbon for the calf or the pig or whatever to the beauty queen or whatever,
[02:39:55.237 --> 02:40:00.901]  And then when she got up or he got up to get the award, they'd say, excuse me.
[02:40:00.901 --> 02:40:03.903]  This was all over the country a few years ago.
[02:40:03.903 --> 02:40:05.984]  They didn't do their premises ID.
[02:40:05.984 --> 02:40:08.566]  They're banned from showing here.
[02:40:08.566 --> 02:40:17.852]  And they were getting money behind the scenes at the local fairground to do this event and take them off the stage with deputies like they were criminal.
[02:40:17.852 --> 02:40:22.355]  It wasn't the law you had to do that, but they were implying they were bad.
[02:40:22.355 --> 02:40:25.057]  I mean, that's the type of dirty tricks, Doc, we're up against.
[02:40:27.359 --> 02:40:38.146]  Really takes an educated group of people to understand this and then take appropriate action and I'm really grateful for the services that you provide to help people understand this process.
[02:40:38.146 --> 02:40:43.270]  But how diabolical is the is because I started seeing a pattern and then later confirmed it was nationwide.
[02:40:43.270 --> 02:40:45.892]  How diabolical is it to do stunts like that?
[02:40:47.725 --> 02:40:50.766]  Yeah, it really hits the limit.
[02:40:50.766 --> 02:40:57.589]  They really will stop at no end, it seems, to achieve their primary goal, which is to increase their bottom line profits.
[02:40:57.589 --> 02:41:00.951]  Well, I mean, is it more than that with Monsanto and others, though?
[02:41:00.951 --> 02:41:03.592]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[02:41:03.592 --> 02:41:09.455]  Yeah, I mean, there's a number of people, and I would include myself in the group, who consider Monsanto to be the most evil corporation on the planet.
[02:41:10.389 --> 02:41:24.716]  They're responsible directly for killing 250,000 farmers in India through suicides because of the crop programs that they've implemented and creating a scenario that really makes them have almost no logical choice except to kill themselves.
[02:41:24.716 --> 02:41:27.278]  I mean, this is the type of evil that they have over there.
[02:41:27.278 --> 02:41:30.039]  Tell folks how they kill themselves.
[02:41:30.039 --> 02:41:34.001]  By consuming the pesticides that they produce, that they buy from Monsanto.
[02:41:36.263 --> 02:41:41.788]  And I've also seen the studies that most of these GMO crops don't even perform like they say they will.
[02:41:41.788 --> 02:41:58.423]  Oh, that's one of the big lies, and it will be used massively in this propaganda campaign, is that the justification for use of these genetically engineered crops is that it's going to feed the world, that it will provide more food for the people and be more efficient and more effective when the truth of the matter is that the primary
[02:41:59.103 --> 02:42:00.004]  We're good to go!
[02:42:28.464 --> 02:42:31.306]  Well, then there's all those mutations in the cotton plants, too.
[02:42:31.306 --> 02:42:34.449]  I was watching on television.
[02:42:34.449 --> 02:42:35.850]  The people are like, they lied to us!
[02:42:35.850 --> 02:42:38.513]  They destroyed us!
[02:42:38.513 --> 02:42:42.717]  And now that I've planted this, the old stuff won't grow in the soil now!
[02:42:42.717 --> 02:42:43.237]  It's dead!
[02:42:43.237 --> 02:42:46.120]  I mean, talk about a plan!
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:48.662]  Yeah, it's very devious and evil.
[02:42:49.919 --> 02:42:56.502]  This is no question in my mind, and that's why we're really putting all this time, effort, and energy to feed their nefarious plans.
[02:42:56.502 --> 02:42:59.984]  And because we've got this limited window where we think we can make a dent.
[02:42:59.984 --> 02:43:05.806]  And if we defeat them in California, that could be the beginning of the end for Monsanto, at least in genetically engineered seeds and plants.
[02:43:05.806 --> 02:43:07.367]  Because they've got plans for...
[02:43:08.207 --> 02:43:10.988]  And by the way, for those that don't know, what is it, almost 90% of corn is now GMO.
[02:43:10.988 --> 02:43:13.689]  Once they get a crop, they take it over, which is they've said food is a weapon.
[02:43:13.689 --> 02:43:15.369]  I want to go to Kohl's, but you're right, this fight in California
[02:43:33.234 --> 02:43:37.597]  They're going to spend a hundred million bucks, but word of mouth, small donations.
[02:43:37.597 --> 02:43:39.239]  What can people do?
[02:43:39.239 --> 02:43:41.340]  Describe the fight simply for folks.
[02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:42.481]  Explain to them what's happening.
[02:43:42.481 --> 02:43:55.030]  A lot of listeners know, but this big battle to simply try to have this move to label if something is cross-species, grows its own pesticide in it, you know, whatever the case is.
[02:43:56.111 --> 02:44:04.941]  Well, we've already, a small group of us have already donated $3 million to collect the nearly 1 million signatures in the state of California to get it on the ballot.
[02:44:04.941 --> 02:44:06.022]  So it will be on the ballot.
[02:44:06.022 --> 02:44:07.584]  Californians will have a chance to vote for it.
[02:44:07.584 --> 02:44:11.108]  There's going to be, as you mentioned, a $100 million campaign of propaganda by Monsanto.
[02:44:11.568 --> 02:44:23.551]  So, if people can go to Organic Consumers Association, which is one of the best non-profit organizations for organic foods, and just go to their home page and there'll be an opportunity there that they can donate directly to the campaign.
[02:44:23.551 --> 02:44:35.374]  But certainly, if anyone listening to this is in California, could volunteer their efforts to go and educate and inform your friends, relatives, and neighbors to let them know about this so they can actually vote yes on this.
[02:44:35.914 --> 02:44:47.945]  And, you know, they're going to require quite a bit of effort to defeat what's already present, because the polls show over 80% of people are already in favor of this initiative.
[02:44:47.945 --> 02:44:47.965]  80%.
[02:44:47.965 --> 02:44:48.986]  So they have to turn around 30%.
[02:44:48.986 --> 02:44:51.988]  This will be a massive effort on their part.
[02:44:51.988 --> 02:44:55.691]  But when you put $100 million, you can sway things a bit.
[02:44:55.691 --> 02:45:00.235]  So we're really going to need all the help, effort, and energy we have, because this is a David and Goliath battle.
[02:45:00.235 --> 02:45:00.696]  It really is.
[02:45:00.956 --> 02:45:07.923]  Well, the electronic voting machines, the studies have had top experts on, like Beth Harris, cannot steal a landslide.
[02:45:07.923 --> 02:45:10.206]  That's why you need a total landslide or they'll steal it.
[02:45:10.928 --> 02:45:18.575]  I mean, you talk about dirty tricks, they will use those electronic machines, and then like have a propaganda campaign so people believe that you've lost.
[02:45:18.575 --> 02:45:27.403]  But the point is, the fight, you will educate people, you will win either way, and this is the beginning of the end for their crimes against humanity.
[02:45:27.403 --> 02:45:36.611]  When we do finally reverse all this, their takeover of government, they need to be held accountable because not just the dioxin, or the Agent Orange, or all the other crimes, Monsanto is
[02:45:38.323 --> 02:45:47.585]  Is truly a wicked company, but what really takes them down is the fact that you can pull up the mainstream articles, folks, just search Monsanto cafeterias GMO free.
[02:45:47.585 --> 02:45:50.625]  Their scientists will not eat what they're producing.
[02:45:50.625 --> 02:45:51.345]  So remember that.
[02:45:51.345 --> 02:45:56.346]  And the elites are all, of course, Doc, I know you know about this, but I actually found it's even in the L.A.
[02:45:56.346 --> 02:46:02.127]  Times and places, and the Chinese elite feed GMO to their people, but they only eat organic.
[02:46:02.127 --> 02:46:04.528]  The European elites are the same.
[02:46:04.528 --> 02:46:06.688]  What do these guys know that the public doesn't?
[02:46:07.886 --> 02:46:09.227]  That's exactly what they've been saying.
[02:46:09.227 --> 02:46:10.368]  They know it's not good for your health.
[02:46:10.368 --> 02:46:11.568]  But you're right.
[02:46:11.568 --> 02:46:16.871]  With respect to this ballot initiative, they can control it through this electronic balloting manipulation.
[02:46:16.871 --> 02:46:20.954]  And that's why we obtained 900,000 signatures.
[02:46:20.954 --> 02:46:25.916]  You only need 505,000 to put a ballot initiative on.
[02:46:25.916 --> 02:46:27.117]  Incredible work.
[02:46:27.117 --> 02:46:30.219]  But we doubled it just to make sure that they didn't manipulate it on us.
[02:46:31.004 --> 02:46:33.506]  Yeah, I should have introduced you as spearheading that.
[02:46:33.506 --> 02:46:38.751]  I know you're not doing this to be prideful, but you've got to be proud of the work you've spearheaded along with others.
[02:46:38.751 --> 02:46:46.978]  Just amazing job, Doc, because it's good to see somebody really putting their money where their mouth is, their energy, and really getting things done.
[02:46:46.978 --> 02:46:50.622]  You are the model of defeating these people.
[02:46:51.383 --> 02:46:59.927]  Well, we are so close, but that's why I'm really on your show and imploring people to participate, because this is a limited window opportunity.
[02:46:59.927 --> 02:47:04.029]  The window is closing, and at some point, we will not be able to defeat these guys.
[02:47:04.029 --> 02:47:06.670]  These evil incarnate.
[02:47:06.670 --> 02:47:11.052]  This is our chance, so that's why I'm so excited to have the opportunity to really take them down.
[02:47:11.052 --> 02:47:11.592]  Oh, you bet.
[02:47:11.592 --> 02:47:12.752]  We're excited to be part of it here.
[02:47:14.727 --> 02:47:20.212]  What do you think of the fake environmentalists that say carbon dioxide's evil, pay Al Gore money?
[02:47:20.212 --> 02:47:30.243]  For me, they divert off of all the real environmental issues like chimera, genetic splicing, all of this stuff that we know is already having a devastating effect.
[02:47:30.243 --> 02:47:32.185]  I mean, you talk about really hurting the planet.
[02:47:33.345 --> 02:47:33.945]  Yeah.
[02:47:33.945 --> 02:47:38.267]  These guys are clever on steroids.
[02:47:38.267 --> 02:47:43.869]  They are using incredibly sophisticated tools and techniques and one of them is what you refer to.
[02:47:43.869 --> 02:47:49.351]  They'll create these ostensibly public health oriented organizations
[02:47:49.711 --> 02:47:59.440]  They're objective and supposedly truth-seeking when actually they're just arms of the corporations and they're spreading these false messages.
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:00.881]  They're going to do the same thing.
[02:48:00.881 --> 02:48:03.023]  They did it when Washington tried to pass it and they did it with Oregon.
[02:48:03.023 --> 02:48:04.884]  They're going to do the same thing in California.
[02:48:04.884 --> 02:48:07.507]  So this is their standard modus of operation.
[02:48:08.527 --> 02:48:12.109]  Yeah, they're running around saying, tax carbon dioxide, that'll save us.
[02:48:12.109 --> 02:48:16.172]  Instead of like, not eating stuff, it's literally destroying us.
[02:48:16.172 --> 02:48:19.174]  Let's go to Red Devil in Illinois.
[02:48:19.174 --> 02:48:21.075]  You're on the air with Dr. Mercola.
[02:48:21.075 --> 02:48:21.435]  Go ahead.
[02:48:21.435 --> 02:48:24.157]  Hi there, Dr. Mercola.
[02:48:24.157 --> 02:48:24.297]  Hi.
[02:48:24.297 --> 02:48:26.519]  I have a question for you.
[02:48:26.519 --> 02:48:33.523]  My stepdaughter, who is turning 16, has contracted fructose malabsorption.
[02:48:33.523 --> 02:48:37.806]  And I'd love for you to speak on anything you can about that to me.
[02:48:38.723 --> 02:48:41.005]  But I'd like to make a statement first.
[02:48:41.005 --> 02:48:49.210]  I just talked to a Selective Serviceman, and they're being briefed on restarting the draft.
[02:48:49.210 --> 02:48:49.990]  But thank you.
[02:48:49.990 --> 02:48:54.954]  Yeah, that's actually been in the news, but it's going to be a new domestic FEMA Corps Tattletail Squad.
[02:48:54.954 --> 02:48:56.575]  That's actually on record now.
[02:48:56.575 --> 02:48:58.036]  Doctor, his medical question.
[02:48:59.133 --> 02:49:06.155]  Well, I think that, I don't know if it was your daughter, I think you said it was, that the fructose malabsorption is actually a very beneficial thing.
[02:49:06.155 --> 02:49:17.857]  And when you look at this condition in animals, these animals live much longer because fructose is one of the most pernicious toxins that you can have in your diet if you have it in large quantities, typically more than 25 grams a day.
[02:49:17.857 --> 02:49:26.859]  So it causes, it will cause large amounts of fat, it causes metabolic syndrome, and in many ways it's a poison not too different metabolically from alcohol.
[02:49:27.399 --> 02:49:29.861]  So it's something that you really want to limit.
[02:49:29.861 --> 02:49:32.382]  So not absorbing fructose is a blessing.
[02:49:32.382 --> 02:49:33.263]  Believe me, it's a blessing.
[02:49:58.140 --> 02:49:59.780]  Well, some of the best are lemons and limes.
[02:49:59.780 --> 02:50:00.741]  There's virtually no fructose.
[02:50:00.741 --> 02:50:02.242]  They're fructose-free.
[02:50:02.242 --> 02:50:04.523]  So you can have virtually unlimited amounts of that.
[02:50:04.523 --> 02:50:05.883]  But some of the berries are also low.
[02:50:05.883 --> 02:50:10.726]  But if you have two quarts of blueberries, you're going to go over your limits.
[02:50:10.726 --> 02:50:12.607]  So you have to have it in moderation.
[02:50:12.607 --> 02:50:17.469]  But if anyone questions that, and many people do, then there is a simple blood test that one can do.
[02:50:17.469 --> 02:50:19.050]  It's called a uric acid.
[02:50:19.050 --> 02:50:19.971]  It's a blood test.
[02:50:19.971 --> 02:50:21.311]  You can easily get it done at your doctor's.
[02:50:21.311 --> 02:50:22.232]  It's really inexpensive.
[02:50:22.632 --> 02:50:29.819]  And if that's over 5.0, it's a suggestion that you're having too much fructose because that's one of the end products of excessive fructose.
[02:50:29.819 --> 02:50:31.881]  Briefly, why is diabetes exploding so bad?
[02:50:33.171 --> 02:50:33.972]  Fructose and sugar.
[02:50:33.972 --> 02:50:42.719]  I mean, Dr. Robert Lustig and Robert Johnson, who were published in his book called The Fat Switch in a month or so, has really explained that in very specific details.
[02:50:42.719 --> 02:50:44.941]  But it's too much sugar.
[02:50:44.941 --> 02:50:46.202]  That's the bottom line.
[02:50:46.202 --> 02:50:47.203]  And carbohydrates.
[02:50:47.203 --> 02:50:48.144]  All right.
[02:50:48.144 --> 02:50:49.305]  Stay there, Dr. Mercola.
[02:50:49.305 --> 02:50:50.486]  Amazing interview.
[02:50:50.486 --> 02:50:52.828]  More phone calls straight ahead.
[02:50:52.828 --> 02:50:55.830]  Big breaking news at Infowars.com.
[02:50:55.830 --> 02:50:58.473]  Obama ban on youth farms.
[02:50:58.473 --> 02:50:59.233]  It's incredible.
[02:50:59.233 --> 02:50:59.714]  Stay with us.

[02:54:38.687 --> 02:54:40.387]  Big headline at Infowars.com.
[02:54:40.387 --> 02:54:41.748]  Please get this out to everybody.
[02:54:41.748 --> 02:54:44.228]  Obama ban on youth farm chores.
[02:54:44.228 --> 02:54:46.449]  Part of a larger power grab.
[02:54:46.449 --> 02:54:47.469]  Agenda 21.
[02:54:47.469 --> 02:54:49.229]  You need to get that article out to everybody.
[02:54:49.229 --> 02:54:50.670]  This is serious.
[02:54:50.670 --> 02:54:53.890]  The Pentagon is over this.
[02:54:53.890 --> 02:54:55.551]  That rural council.
[02:54:55.551 --> 02:54:57.451]  Let's take another call here.
[02:54:57.451 --> 02:55:01.132]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky listening on XM Channel 166.
[02:55:01.132 --> 02:55:02.892]  You're on the air, Chris.
[02:55:02.892 --> 02:55:04.912]  Go ahead.
[02:55:04.912 --> 02:55:06.473]  Hi Alex.
[02:55:06.473 --> 02:55:07.573]  Been looking at the world in a
[02:55:08.274 --> 02:55:12.416]  With a completely different perspective over the last couple of months since I've been listening to your show.
[02:55:12.416 --> 02:55:16.338]  I appreciate what you do.
[02:55:16.338 --> 02:55:30.804]  Growing up on a farm, being involved in agriculture, I've seen Monsanto really has put farmers almost in a conundrum.
[02:55:31.460 --> 02:55:35.781]  With their choice of seed selection.
[02:55:35.781 --> 02:55:38.782]  And they've been victims of the propaganda.
[02:55:38.782 --> 02:55:44.483]  I know when I was going to college, everyone said that BT was farmless.
[02:55:44.483 --> 02:55:49.824]  Now that you've got it in corn, you know, it's not going to hurt a cow or anything that eats it.
[02:55:49.824 --> 02:55:52.385]  And we all thought that was grand.
[02:55:52.385 --> 02:55:56.526]  This was just the second phase of the Green Revolution.
[02:55:56.526 --> 02:55:59.347]  Just like you had kind of laid out beforehand.
[02:56:01.212 --> 02:56:11.562]  You know, now there are no seed companies really putting a whole lot of research into conventional hybrids to offer farmers an option.
[02:56:11.562 --> 02:56:12.102]  No, that's right.
[02:56:12.102 --> 02:56:14.865]  They've totally dominated the market.
[02:56:14.865 --> 02:56:16.626]  Dr. Mercola, comments on what he's saying?
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:22.802]  I couldn't agree more, and that's part of the confusion that these companies use.
[02:56:22.802 --> 02:56:36.726]  Their campaign is to get the confusion between traditional hybridization techniques and the genetically engineering ones, and they want people to believe this is just a newer approach when they're radically different.
[02:56:36.726 --> 02:56:41.568]  Yeah, you're not breeding two of the same variety, same species together.
[02:56:41.568 --> 02:56:44.529]  It's totally different species, but here's the thing.
[02:56:45.149 --> 02:56:49.310]  Monsanto's also buying up the heirloom in hybrid companies, aren't they?
[02:56:49.310 --> 02:56:49.971]  They sure are.
[02:56:49.971 --> 02:56:55.352]  It's in their strategy to dominate and control the entire food supply of the world.
[02:56:55.352 --> 02:56:57.913]  I mean, it's a very compelling business model.
[02:56:57.913 --> 02:57:00.174]  If they're successful, you know, it's kind of like Facebook.
[02:57:00.174 --> 02:57:01.734]  They're going to control everything.
[02:57:01.734 --> 02:57:06.576]  So, you know, it's different industries, of course, but it's a domination strategy.
[02:57:06.576 --> 02:57:10.037]  The head of Facebook called his customers dumb bleepers.
[02:57:10.037 --> 02:57:11.938]  I mean, that's their attitude.
[02:57:11.938 --> 02:57:12.518]  Absolutely.
[02:57:13.801 --> 02:57:15.145]  Zuckerberg has his challenges.
[02:57:15.145 --> 02:57:16.609]  Okay, let's jam in one more.
[02:57:16.609 --> 02:57:17.171]  Thank you Chris.
[02:57:17.171 --> 02:57:17.974]  Great points.
[02:57:17.974 --> 02:57:18.555]  Moving fast.
[02:57:18.555 --> 02:57:19.699]  Tom in Kansas, you're on the air.
[02:57:21.846 --> 02:57:24.007]  Hey, Alex, it's good to talk to you again.
[02:57:24.007 --> 02:57:31.111]  They took you off of KCXL years ago here, just when Rome started to burn, and now I can't get you.
[02:57:31.111 --> 02:57:33.512]  One of my questions was, how do I get you in this area?
[02:57:33.512 --> 02:57:34.372]  I drive for a living.
[02:57:34.372 --> 02:57:46.739]  I'm on a couple of affiliates up there, and I know KCXL carried us for years and then got another station and stuff, and you just gotta listen on XM or Shortwave or Internet or the free iPhone app.
[02:57:47.539 --> 02:57:51.380]  But we've got a few stations up in Kansas and Missouri area.
[02:57:51.380 --> 02:57:53.681]  You can go to GCNlive.com, look at their affiliates list.
[02:57:53.681 --> 02:57:54.702]  They're adding more all the time.
[02:57:54.702 --> 02:57:58.163]  I'm told we just got a big station, what, in Anchorage, Alaska.
[02:57:58.163 --> 02:58:02.864]  So we're growing, but we're number one on the internet when it comes to radio.
[02:58:02.864 --> 02:58:06.706]  We're on XM and over 100 AM and FM's, but that's not nearly enough, brother.
[02:58:06.706 --> 02:58:08.506]  I know.
[02:58:08.506 --> 02:58:13.828]  Listen, I deliver home oxygen for patients with COPD, and I just came from
[02:58:15.751 --> 02:58:16.632]  Absolutely.
[02:58:16.632 --> 02:58:16.992]  There we go.
[02:58:16.992 --> 02:58:18.973]  I mean, Monsanto, if you study them, it's like it's Satan's company.
[02:58:18.973 --> 02:58:21.455]  Do you agree with that statement, Dr. Mercola?
[02:58:21.455 --> 02:58:23.116]  I believe they're evil incarnate.
[02:58:23.116 --> 02:58:23.656]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:23.656 --> 02:58:24.757]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:45.538 --> 02:59:48.440]  Alright, final segment with our guest, Dr. Joseph Mercola.
[03:00:11.078 --> 03:00:11.879]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:11.879 --> 03:00:12.960]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[03:00:12.960 --> 03:00:13.740]  Jamming and calls.
[03:00:13.740 --> 03:00:15.101]  Going quick here with these callers.
[03:00:15.101 --> 03:00:24.749]  But what did you make of the last caller bringing up the fact that, yeah, he just went to a guy who can't breathe and has to have oxygen tanks because of Agent Orange.
[03:00:24.749 --> 03:00:27.831]  And it's just like, oh, but Monsanto, they're our good friend.
[03:00:27.831 --> 03:00:31.054]  Everything they produce is like from the bowels of Satan.
[03:00:32.441 --> 03:00:41.387]  Well, they're actually going to be producing more of that because the glyphosate, which is, I think they're using somewhere between 200 and 300 million pounds a year in the U.S.
[03:00:41.387 --> 03:00:42.948]  alone.
[03:00:42.948 --> 03:00:49.373]  Because of the massive use of this herbicide, they're developing super weeds.
[03:00:49.373 --> 03:00:54.396]  So they've got dozens of different species, over 10 million acres, that are completely resistant.
[03:00:54.396 --> 03:00:58.619]  So as a result of that resistance, they have to use other herbicides.
[03:00:58.619 --> 03:00:59.380]  But that's good though!
[03:00:59.380 --> 03:01:00.721]  Now we've got to buy those from them!
[03:01:01.041 --> 03:01:09.246]  That's bad for us, and there's long-term chronic toxicity from exposure to these things, and certainly lung damage and COPD is one of them.
[03:01:09.246 --> 03:01:10.447]  How loving.
[03:01:10.447 --> 03:01:22.755]  It persists in the environment, which is a real challenge, and that was one of their original assertions, is that this thing was safe, it didn't stick around, but that's just not true, as we're finding in... Oh, they wouldn't lie to us.
[03:01:22.755 --> 03:01:24.677]  I mean, Agent Orange is good for you too.
[03:01:24.677 --> 03:01:28.719]  Harry in Michigan, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:01:28.719 --> 03:01:29.300]  Hello?
[03:01:29.300 --> 03:01:29.600]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:31.062 --> 03:01:34.183]  Hi, how are you guys doing?
[03:01:34.183 --> 03:01:34.723]  Good.
[03:01:34.723 --> 03:01:40.444]  17-year listener and I'm a 65-year-old health junkie.
[03:01:40.444 --> 03:01:43.144]  And I love the tangy tangerine, by the way.
[03:01:43.144 --> 03:01:45.005]  I take the tangerine three times a day.
[03:01:45.005 --> 03:01:48.286]  Infowarsteam.com, thank you.
[03:01:48.286 --> 03:01:51.406]  Yeah, I give you, give the credit where it's due.
[03:01:51.406 --> 03:01:52.626]  Good stuff.
[03:01:52.626 --> 03:01:57.147]  My question is, I'm, I was in Vietnam in 65 and I was exposed to Orange and
[03:02:01.289 --> 03:02:04.410]  I don't eat, I haven't eaten any junk food in years.
[03:02:04.410 --> 03:02:10.473]  I got a 34 inch waist, I'm 190 pounds, 65 years old, 5 foot 10.
[03:02:10.473 --> 03:02:13.415]  And no meds, no nothing.
[03:02:13.415 --> 03:02:13.935]  Great.
[03:02:13.935 --> 03:02:25.380]  But my deal is, I've been purging my system for years now with dehydrated water.
[03:02:25.380 --> 03:02:26.601]  Is there another way of doing that?
[03:02:28.283 --> 03:02:38.289]  Well, you're referring to detoxification and one of the problems with these pesticide exposures and chemicals in general is that they tend to be fat soluble so they stick in your fat.
[03:02:38.289 --> 03:02:41.390]  So one of the most important things is to optimize your body fat.
[03:02:41.390 --> 03:02:43.872]  Sir, can you explain to me what dehydrated water is?
[03:02:43.872 --> 03:02:49.855]  I don't want to touch that one because it sounds like an oxymoron.
[03:02:49.855 --> 03:02:53.497]  I didn't mean distilled water.
[03:02:53.497 --> 03:02:54.018]  I'm sorry.
[03:02:55.444 --> 03:02:56.405]  Oh, it's okay, brother.
[03:02:56.405 --> 03:02:57.447]  God bless you.
[03:02:57.447 --> 03:03:00.491]  No, from what I've, my dad, you know, he's a dentist oral surgeon.
[03:03:00.491 --> 03:03:12.448]  He says, Doc, is it true that, he says, okay, distilled's fine, but not all the time, that it's a powerful, you know, cleanser, and that it'll basically, too much of it, though, it'll start stripping stuff out of you.
[03:03:13.504 --> 03:03:20.972]  Yeah, it tends to remove some of the important minerals, so it's not going to be necessarily good for moving things like Agent Orange and other heavy metals.
[03:03:20.972 --> 03:03:23.074]  So, not heavy metals, but pesticides.
[03:03:23.074 --> 03:03:28.860]  So, what strategies work best for that are things like infrared sauna and exercise where you're sweating.
[03:03:28.860 --> 03:03:35.827]  So, it's just sweating, optimizing your percentage of body fat along your body to excrete these things through your sweat and your urine and your breath.
[03:03:36.267 --> 03:03:36.608]  I think so.
[03:03:55.097 --> 03:04:10.522]  Alex, this is one of the two We Are Change Tampa members who had the honor of guesting on your show last February in Orlando, and I must let you know that Tampa is in Hillsborough County, but Pinellas County is due west, just across Tampa Bay, where some members of We Are Change Tampa are.
[03:04:10.522 --> 03:04:14.204]  We've only got about 30 seconds, so you're talking about people getting fluoride out.
[03:04:14.204 --> 03:04:15.024]  Very, very exciting.
[03:04:16.087 --> 03:04:21.272]  Well, Dr. Mercola, I do agree with you on most issues, but I must take issue on two subjects.
[03:04:21.272 --> 03:04:21.913]  We got a job.
[03:04:21.913 --> 03:04:23.194]  It's not that you disagree.
[03:04:23.194 --> 03:04:25.977]  It's just that we're trying to jam in as many calls as possible.
[03:04:25.977 --> 03:04:27.499]  We're out of time.
[03:04:27.499 --> 03:04:30.482]  But Dr. Mercola says, hey, it won't be a couple of years till he comes back on.
[03:04:30.482 --> 03:04:36.708]  He's going to start joining us every month or so to give us updates on the big fight with Monsanto there in California.
[03:04:36.708 --> 03:04:37.849]  Mercola.com.
[03:04:37.849 --> 03:04:39.271]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[03:04:39.791 --> 03:04:41.152]  Alright, thanks for having me, Alex.
[03:04:41.152 --> 03:04:42.293]  Really appreciate the opportunity.
[03:04:42.293 --> 03:04:42.713]  Thank you.
[03:04:42.713 --> 03:04:43.754]  What a cliffhanger there.
[03:04:43.754 --> 03:04:46.396]  That caller can get back in next time, but he's gotta go.
[03:04:46.396 --> 03:04:49.519]  So we're out of time for this segment.
[03:04:49.519 --> 03:04:55.183]  We'll be back and always online for now at InfoWars.com.
[03:04:55.183 --> 03:04:56.344]  Twitter, Real Alex Jones.
